        "text": "Former United States first daughter Chelsea Clinton got married to her long time boyfriend Marc Mezvinsky in what was being billed as the 'wedding of the millennium' in a beautiful ceremony in the quaint town of Rhinebeck in New York.\n\n\"Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends.\n\n\"We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family,\" Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement issued on Saturday night (local time) after the wedding, details about which were kept closely guarded till the end.\n\n\"On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day,\" Chelsea's parents said.\n\nAmong the guests were former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, film producer Steven Bing, Indian-American hotelier Sant Chatwal, who is close to Clinton family and fashion designer Vera Wang who designed Chelsea's dress, according to People Magazine.\n\nHillary wore an Oscar de La Renta.\n\n\"We want to wish them the best,\" Danson told People, \"they are great kids, very family-oriented.\"\n\nThe guests must have had a personal connection to the bride or the groom to be invited. This is Chelsea's day, not her famous parents' day, the Washington Post reported, earlier in the day.\n\n\"They respect her and what she thinks... They want what she wants,\" said a family friend speaking on condition of anonymity. \"They raised her to be her own person Â independent in thought.\"\n\nChelsea, 30, married Marc Mazvinsky, 32, who works at G3 Capital, a Manhattan hedge fund.\n\nThey were friends as teenagers in Washington, DC, and attended Stanford University together. Clinton completed her master's degree in public health this year at Columbia University.\n\nThe marriage is an interfaith marriage since the bride was brought up as a Methodist Christian and the groom is Jewish.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in Islamabad last week, Hillary expressed her support for the interfaith marriage.\n\n\"Over the years, so many of the barriers that prevented people from getting married, crossing lines of faith or colour or ethnicity have just disappeared,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"Because what's important is: 'Are you making a responsible decision? Have you thought it through? Do you understand the consequences?' And I think in the world that we're in today we need more of that,\" she had said.\n\n\"I was not invited to the wedding because I think Hillary and Bill, properly, want to keep this thing for Chelsea and her soon-to-be husband,\" President Obama had said.\n\nThough he joked, \"You don't want two Presidents at one wedding. All the secret service, guests going through (metal detectors), all the gifts being torn apartÂ \"\n\nChelsea and Marc, who works at G3 Capital -- a Manhattan hedge fund, were friends as teenagers in Washington DC and attended Stanford University together. Chelsea completed her master's degree in public health this year at Columbia University.\n\nThe marriage at the Astor Courts -- which had been declared a 'no-fly' zone with hundreds of security personnel blocking all roads leading to the venue -- was an interfaith wedding since the bride was brought up as a Methodist Christian and the groom is Jewish. The ceremony was conducted by a rabbi and a reverend.\n\nCiting the family, American media reported that the ceremony included a poem by Leo Marks titled, \"The Life That I Have.\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC in Islamabad last week, Hillary had expressed her support for the interfaith marriage.\n\n\"Over the years, so many of the barriers that prevented people from getting married, crossing lines of faith or colour or ethnicity have just disappeared,\" she had said.\n\n\"Because what's important is: 'Are you making a responsible decision? Have you thought it through? Do you understand the consequences?' And I think in the world that we are in today we need more of that,\" she had said.\n\nOn Friday night, Bill and Hillary waved at spectators gathered near the venue as they arrived at the Beekman Arms Inn at the centre of Rhinebeck for a post-rehearsal dinner party.\n\nBill Clinton charmed the locals during a casual stroll through the town ahead of the wedding, saying that he was pleased with his daughter's choice of life partner.\n\n\"I like him (Mark) very much,\" a smiling Clinton said, adding, \"I really do. I admire him. Hillary feels the same way.\"\n\nCasual in jeans and a black golf shirt, the former President shook hands and greeted the crowd like he was back on the campaign trail, according to New York Daily News, which described Chelsea's marriage as the 'Wedding of the Millennium'.\n\nDespite its persistence, the media, which had been swarming the small town, could not dig out too many details about the marriage.\n\nTight security kept the press away from the ceremony. Airspace above Rhinebeck had been closed for 12 hours from 3 pm local time on Saturday for the wedding.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nExclusive: Glimpses of Chelsea Clinton's wedding\n\nImage: Chelsea with father and former US presidentÂ Clinton.
