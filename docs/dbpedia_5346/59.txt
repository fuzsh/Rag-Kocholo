Chelsea Clinton announced the birth of her third child on Twitter early Monday morning.

Clinton, 39, and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, 41, are already parents to four-year-old Charlotte and two-year-old Aidan. This morning, Clinton wrote, she gave birth to the couple’s third child — Jasper Clinton Mezvinsky.

Hilary Clinton chimed in on the celebration of her new grandson, tweeting, “Sharing some happy news this morning! Bill and I are so thrilled.”

Jasper. It’s a gorgeous name. But nu, they couldn’t have gone with something from the Torah?

Mezvinsky, who is Jewish, is scion to a wealthy family of liberal politicians stalked by rumors of scandal. And Clinton, who is not, is scion to a family with similar descriptors but a longer resume. The two knew each other as teenagers, connected romantically years later, and married in 2010. The wedding, treated with extreme scrutiny by this and every other publication, was co-officiated by a rabbi and a Methodist reverend.

The couple appear to be raising their children with some practices from both traditions, not that it’s any of our business. We’re wishing mazal to Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, and, of course, Jasper. And this is a friendly reminder that if they want to keep up with the joneses — in this case, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump — they should start picking out High Holiday-friendly onesies now.
