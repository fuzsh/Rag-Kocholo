It wasn’t a good night for Chelsea Clinton’s mother-in-law.

Former congresswoman Marjorie Margolies failed in her bid Tuesday night to return to Capitol Hill, losing big in her Pennsylvania House race against state lawmaker Brendan Boyle.

The Associated Press called the race for Boyle Tuesday night. With about 78 percent of votes in, Boyle led with 49 percent compared to Margolies’s 25 percent.

Margolies’s son, Marc Mezvinsky, married Chelsea Clinton in 2010. The couple is expecting their first child later this year.

But a late appearance from Bill Clinton and fundraising help from Hillary Clinton weren't enough to lift the former lawmaker to victory in the race to replace Rep. Allyson Schwartz, who relinquished the seat for an unsuccessful run for governor in Pennsylvania.

Margolies served in the U.S. House from 1993 to 1995, but she failed to win re-election – largely because of her deciding vote in favor of then-President Bill Clinton’s budget bill.
