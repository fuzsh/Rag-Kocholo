Chelsea Clinton announced Thursday that she and her husband, Marc, are expecting their first child later this year.

The announcement came during a joint event with her mother, Hillary Clinton, for the Clinton Foundation's "No Ceilings: The Full Participation" project.

"I have one more thing to say very quickly," Chelsea Clinton said near the conclusion of the event. "I just want to thank all of you for being such an inspiration to us and to me in particular. Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year."

"And I certainly feel all the better, whether it’s a girl or a boy, that she or he will grow up in a world with so many strong, young female leaders," she said.

The daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton also took to Twitter to spread the news.

And the grandfather-to-be also tweeted his congratulations.

Chelsea Clinton wed husband Marc Mezvinsky, a hedge fund trader, in 2010.

Probable 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made no secret of hoping to become a grandmother soon.

In an interview last year with Glamour magazine, the younger Clinton said she hoped to make 2014 “the Year of the Baby.”

“And please," she added, "call my mother and tell her that. She asks us about it every single day."

After daughter Chelsea revealed the news Thursday, Hillary Clinton said she is "really excited" about Chelsea's pregnancy.
