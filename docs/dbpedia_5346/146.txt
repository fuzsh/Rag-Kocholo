Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky were married in an interfaith ceremony on July 31, 2010, at the Astor Courts Estate in Rhinebeck, New York. The estate was built by John Jacob Astor IV in the early years of the twentieth century, and sits on the Hudson River, a couple of hours north of New York City.Chelsea’s wedding jewelry included diamond earrings — each earring was made from two clusters of diamonds set to resemble small flowers. Her diamond bracelet repeated a single version of the floral setting.

Chelsea’s strapless silk wedding gown was designed by Vera Wang, one of the couple’s 500 wedding guests. Chelsea’s mother, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wore a gown by Oscar de la Renta.
