        "text": "The creation of a mobile app as a capacity building toolkit\n\nThe scope of the project included the building of a toolkit that would initiate users into filmmaking. Our learnings from research led us to the understanding that a written toolkit would be limited in its effectiveness in capacity building. Instead, a toolkit was created in the form of a mobile app that generated films from footage taken by the user. This unique, internally developed tool did away with the need to edit and storyboard video content, giving every user to potential to be a filmmaker at the tap of a button.\n\nThe generation of relatable content within the context rather than outside of it\n\nGiven the widespread influence of music videos and Bhojpuri (the local language) cinema, it was decided that the format of a music video would be leveraged for at least one film. The team ended up with two such films, both recorded and created in collaboration with community members to articulate the potential of solar energy and the workings of a mini grid system.\n\nIntegration of the platform with communities around the world\n\nThe project was eventually extended to include a phase that would see Quicksand strategise the distribution and dissemination of the platform and the app in multiple countries. This phase would involve more research to strengthen the proof of concept and the eventual proposition of the created outputs to mini grid companies.\n\nOver the course of the project, 10 mini grid communities were visited to learn, co-create and test outputs by the team. The project ended with the handover of a complete app, a dedicated digital platform to host mini grid videos, 22 films around the people’s experiences of the mini grid, and a project report. Of the final 22 films that were made, 11 were made by users with the developed app, with minimal help from the team.\n\nThe human-centred method aided our understanding of the context, including people’s media preferences and experiences with mini grid electricity. The HCD method was also key in the team’s decision behind making a video-making app rather than a written toolkit for filmmaking. It helped the team identify a successful model in engaging the targeted communities, through relatable, simple content and interactions."
