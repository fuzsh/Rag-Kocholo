        "text": "I should open this post by acknowledging my deliberate mistake.\n\nThere are no parentheses in the title of this 1997 Blur song, which I’ve also named incorrectly on purpose. It’s just called ‘You’re So Great’. But there should be brackets and those extra few words.\n\nOne thing is that some of the finest love songs have such parentheses. Nick Cave’s ‘(Are You) The One That I’ve Been Waiting For’ springs to mind, as do R.E.M.’s ‘(Don’t Go Back To) Rockville’ and The Buzzcocks’ ‘Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)’, as well as The Crystals’ ‘He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)’.\n\nBut maybe more relevantly here, “You’re so great and I love you” is what Graham Coxon repeatedly sings to the person who inspired the song. Whom he earnestly, achingly adores.\n\nOne reason you might go for ‘You’re So Great’ over other Blur songs, other than being clever as it’s Graham not Damon, is because it sounds so vulnerable; the character delivering the words is so fragile.\n\nBut that’s not to say that Damon Albarn’s Blur never did it for me.\n\nI just checked a Goosebumps playlist I started a couple of years ago and Blur have as many songs on the list as almost anyone. (That means certain songs mean so much that my spinal cord responds all the time, such as ‘Yuko and Hiro’, ‘To The End’, and ‘No Distance Left To Run’; every Blur song on the list bar ‘You’re So Great’ is by Damon Albarn.)\n\nThey’re up there with A House, Afghan Whigs, Big Star, The Divine Comedy, Nick Drake, Bob Dylan, Julia Jacklin, John Lennon, Smog, Palace, Pavement, Pixies, Pulp, R.E.M., Sufjan Stevens, The Smiths, Teenage Fanclub, Tindersticks, and U2. (OK—quite a few.)\n\nBlur are just one of those continually affecting bands, maybe especially when you have just arrived into your fifties.\n\nThe songs must be still spine-tingling to make the list and that can be because of emotional effects engineered now or thirty years ago. Blur songs are largely touching because they bring me right back to special moments. I’m not sure if the songs have changed much; I’ve written before here about songs and pieces evolving over decades so your relationship with them changes. But they don’t have to.\n\nEmotionally powerful evocation in later life of teenage and twentysomething memories is not nothing.\n\nBlur have been good enough to bring loads of memorable moments into my life, not knowing they were doing it. I met Blur backstage at Féile in 1995, including Graham, who wandered off from my questions, bored. Damon was a little hammered twenty minutes before going onstage but he was a really good Hot Press interviewee. All I remember Damon saying was that ‘Yuko and Hiro’, about a couple whose careers separate them irreparably, wasn’t only about him and Justine Frischmann. But it was a bit.\n\nThis I found and still find a little bit heartbreaking.\n\nI sometimes avoid mentioning when a song moves me just because it reminds me of a past event. I’m going to blame meditation—we should, they say, inhabit the present not the past. When you count your breath you’re counting your breath from now, not from 1993.\n\nBut Blur from 1993 are on the list courtesy of ‘For Tomorrow’. That song is on the list because it’s the lead song from Modern Life Is Rubbish. This was the first of dozens of albums I reviewed as a Hot Press employee over the coming dozen years—so that was not nothing.\n\nMore importantly, a feature of ‘For Tomorrow’ was that when I heard it so did my younger brother, Patrick. My sibship is made of four brothers; I’m second and he’s third. When this album came out I was 19 and he was 15 and it felt, at that time, like we were a generation apart. That’s teenage years for ya! Then I got a pre-release Blur album and after I finished reviewing it he “borrowed” it. He played it endlessly. I moved on to Afghan Whigs, via their genius Gentlemen, which he did in 1995, via Black Love, which Patrick still, bizarrely, thinks is better.\n\nModern Life Is Rubbish was to Patrick what R.E.M.’s Green was to me, at exactly that age. And it was an album that bridged the gap between us. I’m over-simplifying but essentially it was an album that brought us together as close friends, which we’ve been ever since. What an accomplishment; I owe Albarn so hugely.\n\nAnd this must have happened thousands of times for different families and different friends. If I hadn’t heard ‘For Tomorrow’ back then or if Patrick hadn’t clicked with it when he did, I doubt it would do much if I heard it just now. But we did and it always will be a song that makes my hair stand on end.\n\nI did check with Patrick before posting that it was OK to mention all of this in a Psych & Songs piece and he said yes. I also told him I’d mentioned other memorable moments.\n\nOne of them was the Think Tank tour show in the Olympia in 2003. I had just been to see Radiohead (Hail To The Thief tour) and Bob Dylan (my third time at The Never Ending Tour) and in each case I’d stroked my chin in the Point and tried to—not enjoy the performances but appreciate them. But I was quietly glad when each gig ended.\n\nThen Blur, who I didn’t, somewhat snobbily, rate as highly as Dylan or Radiohead, played the Olympia. And I was in the Upper Circle, miles from the band, not expecting much. But they played so joyfully, heart-liftingly, purely kinetically, that they blew the roof off the theatre. One of the gigs of a lifetime, because of ‘Song 2’ and ‘Girls & Boys’ among two dozen others. When I told Patrick I’d be mentioning this gig in the piece, he said: you do remember that I bought those tickets, then I couldn’t go as I was sick, and I gave them to you?\n\nI didn’t remember that. Oh, it’s a long time ago! Thanks again, man.\n\n(Last mention of Patrick here is the parenthetical masterpiece cited above, ‘(Are You) The One That I’ve Been Waiting For’, which was the opening song at his wedding dance. You can’t do better than that.)\n\nSometimes the moments that a band affects you long-lastingly are surprisingly brief as well as emotionally effective.\n\nWhen I started college in UCD in Autumn 1991, there was an October pop disco for first years in the Mansion House. Which I recall I enjoyed more than I had the ‘How Soon Is Now’ nights I’d been putting myself through for a while: “There’s a club if you’d like to go / You could meet somebody who really loves you / So you go and you stand on your own / And you leave on your own / And you go home, and you cry and you want to die”. Not that I could dance; I guess I could drink alcohol, at 17.5, almost legally. But for some reason the only song I remember from the dancefloor that night was ‘There’s No Other Way’ and it seemed so celebratory and fun. I bopped! This was all new.\n\nThings were changing as I was leaving five lonely frustrating years of boy-only secondary school and my life was finding out how to turn around. It would take some time. I actually didn’t know this at the time; it’s only looking back that I see how things improved. That’s not to say that everything improved immediately; I was so obsessed with Smog’s Wild Love and The Doctor Came At Dawn four and five years later that I clearly still needed someone to express utter isolation.\n\nSaying that 1991 was memorable because I was finally about to start having the odd conversation with a female, having not really had any before—it’s kinda painful to recollect but it’s true. ‘There’s No Other Way’ feels like a landmark of this moment that life might change; that I could thank Moz for articulating mournful adolescence but in retrospect began to head for ‘Rubber Ring’: “And when you’re dancing and laughing / And finally living / Hear my voice in your head / And think of me kindly”. Also, Damon’s hair in the video is fabulous.\n\nI started this piece of the opinion that ‘You’re So Great’ was Blur’s best, most moving song. At this point I don’t know if it is. (I have to admit I’ve never heard The Magic Whip or The Ballad of Darren.) And there’s no need to make songs take a place on a podium.\n\nStill, ‘You’re So Great’ is really, really good.\n\nIt was only as I was writing the piece that I realised that one of my reasons for elevating this song above all others by Blur was a mixtape I misremembered. I remembered a collection of love songs that I made on a C90 in 2001, when I met my wife, Sharon, and immediately fell for her. So I went and looked for the cassette, and it doesn’t quite exist. What I remembered was a 1998 tape I called Largely Depressing Songs. Nearly seven years after I supposedly turned that frown upside down.\n\nThese things take time, as Moz sensibly said.\n\nSo I’m a little baffled in 2024 as to how in 1998 I found ‘You’re So Great (And I Love You)’ depressing. Surely declarations of love, which may be brave, which are being committed on an album to an eternal undeletable expression, are positive. Not the opposite.\n\nAs I write I’m reminded of the time I was at home playing Big Star’s sweet ‘I’m In Love With A Girl’ (“I’m in love with a girl / Finest girl in the world / I didn’t know I could feel this way / Think about her all the time / Always on my mind / I didn’t know about love”). So I’m listening and smiling and my Mum says “That song sounds so sad”.\n\nI was dumbfounded: I had never heard it that way. For years afterwards, to be honest until right now, I thought and kind of continue to think—my mum must know, must have known, something about love that I haven’t understood. But then the other way, the more comfortable way of addressing that difference, is that the same song is never the same to two different people, now matter how close they are. Those two people being family, friends, or the same person twenty-six years later.\n\nAnd at this point it doesn’t matter what I thought in 1998 and I may never comprehend why I found ‘You’re So Great’ sad. Listening in 2024, re-reading the lyrics, I’m moved and I’m anything but sad.\n\nI suppose what I can hear is that Graham Coxon could be said to have needed to drink to work up the courage to tell somebody how much he likes her; how much he looks up to her. How much he needs her. As we do, when we’re in love: “And I feel the light in the night and in the day / And I feel the light when the sky’s just mud and gray / And I feel the light when you tell me, it’s okay / ‘Cause you’re so great, and I love you.”\n\nStill, I wrote in an early draft of this piece how relatable this song was. I thought relatability was why it made me shiver. But I don’t know. I’ve always been fond of a few beers and a nice Chablis but I don’t remember having to drink to attenuate my anxiety-causing GABA function to tell Sharon that I loved her. Not only is that phenomenon long-gone but it was barely there; I don’t remember it at all.\n\nSo inasmuch as the song speaks to me now it does differently. It does positively and maybe highly personally. Not in a way that everyone has to hear it. But many people must. Because many of us are endlessly in love and still a little stunned that we have held on to a soulmate.\n\nThere are all those moments, a quarter of a century later, when your life is a set of experiences that you are by now used to, and in that I include that being with your partner is just your normal everyday life.\n\nThen every now and then, pretty often to be honest, you look around and see her, yet again, as if for the first time.\n\nAnd you’re back as you were in 2001 when you walked into the clinic where she was working and you’d just started yourself. And all you can do is beam at her. Because, for the nearly ten thousandth time, if you conservatively calculate the question to have occurred just once a day, you have to ask: how the hell did this happen?\n\nAnd she asks you what’s up and you just tell her how lucky you feel to have ever had her in your life. How much it makes you shake your head that you decided straight away, within two days, that you’d never fail to be together, that your life together has continued with no doubt that it always would, as long as lives can. That I’ve looked up to her for 23 years, a lot longer than Graham Coxon had looked up to his loved one, and that is just how it’s been, still is, and always will be.\n\nYou can’t stop beaming and you explain, not for the first time, and she hugs you and responds in kind and says “You big galoot”.\n\nWhich you are ready to accept.\n\nShe’s so great (and I love her).\n\nPaddy O’Mahony, AKA Bare Bones, has been writing and playing different types of music for 30 years now. He started at 14 by obsessively imitating Eric Clapton—as you do. His 2000s band Joice, in which he was songwriter, singer, guitarist and drummer, came close to getting a Sony contract and he has a musical career that I’ve been embarrassingly unfamiliar with, which he tells me about below.\n\nThese days, as you will hear in Bare Bones’ phenomenal 2024 album Sparrow, Paddy is a composer and a pianist with spine-tingling techniques in each. His piano playing is so beautiful and that’s mostly why I asked him to do this interview. (Thank you Pat Barrett AKA Arrivalists for pointing me towards Bare Bones in May, when I asked you who I should listen to who I’ve never heard of. You hit the nail on the head, as Bare Bones did when he cited Mammal Hands.)\n\nThere’s a section in this interview in which Paddy and I talked about how you might start to pay more attention to instrumental than lyrical music because you’re getting a bit older, and I mentioned the influence of Jóhann Jóhannsson’s, whom I first heard on IBM 1401 in 2007. I forgot that it’s been since I encountered Dustin O’Halloran, in Marie Antoinette in 2006, that I’ve depended more on the piano than on most music to articulate, respond to, soothe and/or celebrate how I’m feeling. I began there, or even earlier on Donal Dineen’s late 90s Radio Ireland show, via Arvo Pärt’s Spiegel im Spiegel, to learn that pianos don’t over-explain: their notes and chords just ask—is this how you’re feeling?\n\nPiano pieces you listen to were recorded just once but they adapt every time you hear them. They recognise that your moods and thoughts change and cannot always be verbally articulated but can be expressed somehow. I need this, as Stipe said. I’ve even travelled over to London to see Lubomyr Melnyk, while Peter Broderick’s, Thelonious Monk’s, Bill Evans’, and Úna Keane’s pieces take up a lot of my time.\n\nOne thing Paddy O’Mahony said about the gold medal position of the piano was memorable enough to become the title of the interview. You can also reasonably argue against this; some of us are trying to finally get into John Coltrane’s sax, Charles Mingus’s bass, and Anne Müller’s cello, for example. Once you hear Christian Löffler’s orchestral and electronic Parallels you crave it, as you do the deceptively gentle guitar and vocals on Sufjan’s Javelin, or Penguin Cafe’s multi-instrument ‘Goldfinch Yodel’, which demands a play just because goldfinches are fighting at your feeder.\n\nBut what Bare Bones said makes sense when you listen to Sparrow just once, immerse yourself in it, as you would in an ocean, and then play it a second and third time, as you have to. You quickly recognise the truth of this simple statement: “Everything is pretty much piano”.\n\nNC: OK. Can we start with this? I’m just curious, as someone who listens all the time to people who write musically, and I can only listen to music not create it. So I’m curious about how you know it’s time to compose a piece and how you compose it.\n\nP O’M: Well that question probably brings me back to when I started writing music, and that was around 14. It’s a difficult one to answer, I’ll be honest, Niall, because it kind of just started.\n\nWhat happened? My first memory of it was that I started as a drummer and percussionist, went through marching band concert performances, and travelled a bit around Ireland and England. That was my formal apprenticeship. Reading music and performing.\n\nAt about 14, I always wanted to play guitar. And my Dad had an older brother, and my Dad brought a second-hand guitar into the house. It was more for my older brother, as he was getting lessons and I wasn’t, but he lost interest in it. And the guitar was sitting idle. So I just took it upon myself to fix it up and figure it out.\n\nThe funny one, because I had been in England with an uncle of mine who was a secondary school teacher, and he was doing his own project at home where he was hand-making a Gibson Les Paul replica. And he was showing me the machine, then the handwork he’d done to shape the body and all of that. I was helping him with the little bits of wiring and trying to figure out how everything went together, and setting up the contacts and all of that kind of stuff.\n\nAnd when I came back home—this will tell you how far back it is now, because there was no VHS, it was Betamax. He sent over a Betamax player with a Betamax tape, and it was Eric Clapton.\n\nAnd when I was over there, we would have been listening to Eric Clapton when we were fiddling with the guitar. So he sent that over and I spent, and this is no word of a lie, at least 12 months playing that Betamax tape of Eric Clapton, and stopping and starting and stopping and starting to figure out what the chords were. And for years, I could play chords, I learned by shapes. Sometimes I didn’t even know what the chords were called. And for me it’s always been about the sound and the tone melodies that I try to write. So that really helped me form a structure around the guitar. And once I kind of had that structure, I just started—I kind of got bored of playing other people’s music.\n\nYou started composing your own music—at what age?\n\nThat was probably around that age, 14 and 15.\n\nThen some local guys that I knew wanted to start an original band; people I knew through the marching band. They were writing songs and they asked me to come down. So I went down and I sat and listened to them. I was very shy, very introverted. I felt there was a little bit of pressure on me to come up with something over that period of weeks. So I just went—”Look, I’m going to take away the sound that we have, and I’m going to try and see if I can bring what I have, and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle”.\n\nSo I think I ended up bringing back three songs to that group after maybe two weeks and then we went on. That grew legs and I fell into writing music, and it was more around creating the sound. Now, it was very alternative; I’m just trying to think of the people I would have been listening to quite a lot at the time. It would have been Pink Floyd and I would have been a big Led Zeppelin fan. Jeff Buckley.\n\nJeff Buckley. So I’m just trying to figure out dates: he was only known in Ireland from ’94, I think?\n\nGrace had come out and it was a big deal; with his voice and his skill-set as a musician, you know. I’ve read loads, I have lots of Jeff Buckley books. He used to go into studio with the songs that he’d written on guitar and again, he was the kind of guy who’d never really followed the rules of playing an instrument. He made up his own structures and chord shapes. And maybe that’s why I was drawn to that.\n\nThen his multi-octave voice, with which, for any listener, he would just blow you away. You know—it was unbelievable.\n\nSo down that route, we ended up bringing the songs back. Then we started to gig and we started to build a bit of a following with the original band. I actually went in playing drums for a little while, because the drummer had left. So I went on to drums, and then on between drums and guitar and I was writing the songs but playing drums. Then a friend of mine came in playing drums and I was able to go back onto the guitar and concentrate on writing stuff. So we went from there, hit the Dublin scene back in the 90s. That was the way, I suppose, if you were trying to make it. You had to put in the groundwork of playing Temple Bar Music Center, Da Club, all of those.\n\nSorry—give me the name of this band, will you? I don’t know the name of this band, but I must have known you.\n\nThe band was called Joice. Now, we wouldn’t have been massive in any way. Over six or seven years, we would have played in Dublin quite a bit, and then on the college scene, in Galway and Cork and Waterford, and it really was that age group we were appealing to. So we did that for a good long time. We did a lot of recording in Dublin, in Sonic Studios, whiich I think was on Capel Street. We would record EPs.\n\nThen we were pushing to try and get a record deal. Some of the lads were in college. I was still in school, believe it or not. I’m surprised my parents actually let me go around the country but I think they saw the passion there and they saw that there was something in it for me.\n\nSo the closest we came to a record deal was an interview with Sony Records in Dublin, which lasted all of 15 minutes. The old cliché of: the A&R man listened to the first 20 seconds of each song and the door was closed. He said—look, there is something there. But I want you to go away, and I want you to do X, Y and Z and come back. Some of us had the determination to do it, and others in the group didn’t.\n\nAnd so it fell away, and we all went different ways. And I’ve been through lots of different original things over the years, myself. Playing guitar mainly and singing. But piano was always something, Niall. You probably see it here sitting in the background.\n\nIs that piano that I see the piano I keep hearing?\n\nThis is the piano. This is my little cabin here. It really is a cabin. My cousin built it for me, 10 or 12 years ago; a carpenter.\n\nI don’t want to sound like a dope but when I see or have any contact with the actual instrument that’s been soundtracking my life, I’m moved, I’m shaking. Well, no, I’m not. I’m shivering, and goosebumps are how you know something’s really hitting you. Even seeing the piano and just seeing its construct and everything like that is very moving for me.\n\nI’ll be honest, every time I come and I sit at it I’m really grateful, is the word I would use. Because for years I’ve wanted to play piano.\n\nThe only formal training I’ve ever had is around drums and percussion. Everything else is self-learned. Piano is probably the trickiest one for me, but it’s something that I always had a love for. I’ve had digital keyboards up in the house and I’ve always tinkered, but I committed to the piano maybe four years ago and worked towards buying this.\n\nSo this is a used upright piano that I bought off a guy in Fethard in County Tipp. He’d be well known in this area, John Shortall. We call him The Piano Man. He does all the piano tunings and knows any concerts going on or musicians coming to town that need to rent an upright or a grand piano. John is the man.\n\nSo I bought the piano from John; he maintained it. He had sold it originally. So it’s only five or six years old. I remember the day I got it, I was in awe, but I wanted to strip it all back and I wanted to see all the mechanics, because something that I hope comes across in the music, one thing I’m really interested in, is dynamics.\n\nI think dynamics are the most important element to any song that I listen to and any song that I write, because it drives the emotion that’s in a song, or the message you’re trying to convey. So if you’re playing the one level all the time it just gets boring for the listener.\n\nAnd it’s nice to be able to bring people on that journey of the different elements: playing quieter, playing louder, and flowing in and out of them to different dynamics. So, the piano is the one instrument that can really do that well, and maybe that’s why I started to go in that direction. I still have my guitars, I still have all the other bits and bobs, but it’s rare I pick them up. Everything is pretty much piano.\n\nIt’s fair to say that the piano is my favorite instrument of the last several years just because of that, being able to to create some form of emotion, and that’s my whole goal when I’m writing music.\n\nWhat I’m writing is based on a mood that I’m in, or something that’s happened, over a period of time, or life, for everyone, you know, stuff that goes on for everyone. I’ve always tended to channel that through music, to write music, and maybe that’s my way of focusing.\n\nI feel that it’s therapeutic, in one sense, which I’m sure with your meditative background, Niall, I’m sure you grasp that. It’s definitely a therapeutic journey. We spoke about Ram Dass the other day*, and I was introduced to him about 10 years ago by a friend of mine, and it was the lectures that were on YouTube. And I was at a funny place in my life, going through different things, and it was just time.\n\nIt was really welcome at the time, and it brought me solace. I started to learn to be able to kind of create space in my head, about being present and, you know, never great at practicing mindfulness or anything like that. But it was more about just being present.\n\nWhen you say that, you mean being here now versus being in the past versus being in the future, psychologically or spiritually. So you’re here right now. You can imagine Ram Dass playing the piano actually. Because I was thinking, having picked up the piano lately, that to play the piano at all you have to be here now. Which is really necessary, which—we can go 40 or 50 years or longer without understanding that. You know. Well, I did.\n\nRam Dass has brought me on a journey, you know. Everyone has stuff that goes on in their world and their life, and just to be able to create that space. And he speaks about this thing called the watcher, the person behind all these thoughts; your ultimate self. And that really clicked with me. Took a little while to get my head around it and grasp it. But when you stop and create a little bit of space and you can see that, that you’re not your thoughts and you are the person watching in silence, all of this has happened in your head, and so that has really, really helped me around writing music.\n\nYou asked earlier about the process and we go about making music and I don’t really have a fixed process—like, I was here last night. What I do try and do is I try and come here every week to the Little Cabin.\n\nI’m in the countryside here in south Tipp, between Clonmel and Cashel. A really quiet area. We bought an old cottage, my wife and I, in 2006. We converted it into a bungalow. We’re still working on it.\n\nNever ends.\n\nIt never ends. It’s continuous but it came with a plot of land and that was the biggest selling factor for us; that we grew up in town, townies, and it was nice just to be able to retreat. My wife’s a graphic designer, and for her and her creative process, to have this kind of quiet space where an odd car might pass the house during the day, along a country road, it’s lovely. So I think it was all these small steps of putting these little things into place to get to where we felt comfortable.\n\nYou know, I suppose what you’re probably getting from this is, it’s all about creating that space and creating, for me, solitude. So I come here to the Little Cabin with the piano religiously every Wednesday night. It’s just something I’ve done for the last four or five years. Nothing might happen some Wednesday nights. I might just come and sit, just fiddling or I’m working on arrangements. Because while I also write the piano, I also can do arrangements and sound design stuff as well. Which is something that I really like and again, it just swallows you up and you get taken off into a whole space.\n\nSo Wednesday night is my night, and then I try and come here a few times during the week, depending on what’s going on: the kids, other work, whatever. So it is no fixed process.\n\nThen last night I came here and I have this thing that I do sometimes, which is a little bit odd maybe to some people. I will just sit at the piano and throw my hands out, and it’s almost like opening a book and see what page you land on. I do that and I did that last night, and I started a piece, and so it’s where I landed. It was the chord and the tone, and I started just to build around that. Normally it’s based on a mood so if I’m tired, or there’s a lot going on with the kids or whatever, I’m looking for something. I’m looking to channel something and sometimes I don’t even know what that is. Sometimes a melody will come and sometimes I just create a melody. There’s no fixed process, which I like, because I like being really flexible and being open to receive, and whatever it is I’m meant to be doing. Without getting all Ram Dass-y about it, but you know, it’s just being open to experience and being open to welcoming whatever it is that wants to come out.\n\nIt’s funny because it almost sounds like your limbs are operating by themselves. That you’re sitting there and obviously you’re emotionally involved, but your emotions are letting your hands do what they need to do. And your hands have learned enough at this point that they know the notes and chords of all kinds that communicate whatever you need to communicate.\n\nI’m getting into something that I don’t understand here but I’m just imagining that as a musician you have these emotions and you really need to get them out. To articulate them is helpful.\n\nAnd you’re at a point where—I’m really fascinated as well by the idea that you learned all these instruments without being taught. That makes me curious about the chord sequence, you know. Is that different? It sounds like it is—it sounds like you’re not using B minor and E minor, that you’re using notes that don’t necessarily come together normally, which is just something that I love the idea of. That you’re expressing something that’s just different.\n\nThere’s definitely an element of that. That has come up with chatting to a few people, particularly when Sparrow was coming out. Because you were getting messages and people were saying, how did you come to this melody? Part of it is almost like a regulation of whatever that emotion is that you’re you’re holding on to. And you want that to come out some way, and that’s sitting there, and it’s present with you, and then, like you said, my hands and my head are going to the piano, and I’m trying to find a tone almost that matches that mood.\n\nAnd then sometimes that would be a sway, if that makes sense, or sometimes it would be very rigid, and then other times it would be quite percussive. I think the percussive part comes because of my drum and brain and background. That always kind of follows through.\n\nSo I’m certainly not by any means a conventional piano player, nowhere near classically trained. Nothing like that.\n\nAnd you know what? I love that I’m not, because, and no disrespect to anybody who is because there’s absolutely fantastic musicians out there, but I just feel that if I was that I’d have to operate in between boundaries and I don’t like that. I like having the complete freedom to explore the sounds and the tones, and, like you said, sometimes I’ll play notes and chords. I don’t even know what they’re called but it’s more about the sound for me. It was never really about the notation.\n\nI look at people I really admire, like Ólafur Arnalds and some of these guys that are out there, and they just have such a classical approach. And you see their hands, and even how they move, and their fingers, how they move, and there’s hours and hours and hours of rehearsal and practice gone into that. Don’t get me wrong, I practice a lot and lots of hours, and time goes into it as well, but I don’t think about any notation. It’s all about the tone. It’s all about matching it with what I’m feeling at that particular moment in time.\n\nThat’s really what it’s all about. I love that idea that what’s going on spiritually and emotionally up here, in your heart and mind, and is not verbalisable, is coming out this way, through your limbs, then connecting with the piano and coming out the piano. The idea that what’s going on here goes in through that machine and comes out the other side, into the air, to be shared. That’s such a mysterious and magical idea, and something that’s appreciated by people who’ve survived on music, you know, and have required it for emotional sustenance for their entire lives.\n\nAnd it’s like pieces of music or a song that that you like, you have to stop and ask yourself: what’s drawn you to it? And nine times out of ten, if there’s lyrics involved, it may be the lyrics that make it home with you or grab your attention in some way. But for me, it’s normally just the tone and the dynamic of it. That’s what’s pulling me in.\n\nIf you look at Sparrow, the album, I love animals, and part of why I live here is because of nature. Even under the cabin, I have a family of hares that live here, and they come out. I was up this morning at half six and looked out, leaving my two dogs out for running around. The family of hares were all scamping around in under the cabin. These little tiny babies! And then there’s the mom and dad. And an odd night, you have the big, bad old fox that comes in and he’s swooped around.\n\nThen behind me here, if I look out this window where I’m playing the piano, at the moment it’s lovely and green; all I can see is the trees and the hedging. But in winter time, when that’s all bare, there’s a cornfield, and it will be ploughed or whatever. And it goes through its several stages throughout the year, colours changing and all of that.\n\nAnd that’s had a real influence on me with Sparrow, just coming up with the name, and if you look at the artwork.\n\nAs you speak I’m just thinking of the artwork, actually.\n\nSo the artwork was done by a guy called Christopher Luke.\n\nChristopher is a multi-talented guy. He lives in Clonakilty. I just got to know him through Instagram. He does a lot of work with Susan O’Neill and Mick Flannery. So I connected with him and we chatted. We had a couple of calls and just got on well. He plays music, but he’s into artwork and he makes films.\n\nSo, he’s never seen that cornfield. I just purely described it to him, what it looked like from my perception. Even when we had video calls like this, chatting to him about what I wanted in terms of the artwork, it was night-time. So he couldn’t see the field. So I described it to him. And he’d seen me with the videos and playing piano, and I always wear a hat because I’m balding. It’s just the age thing (laughs).\n\nAnd I think he took all of that on board and I was absolutely blown away when he came back with that artwork, you know? I just described the field, you know? I’m surrounded by beautiful birds, sparrows in particular; lots of sparrows, lots of swallows over the last number of months. And then you have all other Irish native birds.\n\nI was going to ask you about this. I’m looking at a couple of the questions I wrote and one or two were based on something I read on your Bandcamp page: that you are “infusing [your] work with themes inspired by nature”. Of course, I’m just curious about your bird population. We also are heavily populated by birds. I must admit I feed them nyjer seeds and sunflower hearts, because I just want goldfinches and greenfinches to show up. Siskins if possible. But when I read about your themes inspired by nature “and a myriad of artistic influences” I was curious about profound appreciation for nature and holistic view of art.\n\nAnd I was curious about that holistic view because I often think of the way that Wassily Kandinsky painted sounds, and I believe Joni Mitchell does essentially the opposite; she hears, plays, and sings colors. Not asking you if you do that but I’m just always interested in how visual art, or another art, might influence music.\n\nAnd then my next sub-question was the theme of nature. I’m thinking mostly of the various sounds that birds make at various stages of the year. The musical sounds of birds that are peaking right now, between April and August, which quieten from August and how much you might miss them. I suppose the influence of those kind of things even on how you’re feeling.\n\nAbsolutely. It’s soothing for me. I really love it. And in terms of the names, even I’m probably terrible on that front. I can identify the standard enough birds. Every now and then I would take a picture of a bird, if it’s something a little bit more unusual. Like, we have the birds—I don’t know if you’ve seen the perspex birdhouses that you can attach to your windows. We have them on the house. We put bird feed in it every day. Every morning, they’re waiting on the fence for the feed to go in, and then when they come, because it’s a see-through on the window, you can go right up close and actually see the birds.\n\nI didn’t know there was such a thing. Wow.\n\nMy wife actually got it for me for my birthday. My kids now love it. So they get up in the morning and we feed the dogs and we feed the birds. Again, I wouldn’t know the names, but it’s more just that I love how they communicate with each other and it’s just sitting in silence and watching and listening to them. To me, that’s really regulating.\n\nAnd I have two neurodiverse children, so I’m always encouraging them to—because regulating their emotions can be challenging. Sometimes for them it’s just to engage with nature. Because, you know, I’m always saying to them, this is free, this is natural, this is life. If you tune in, you can gain so much in terms of how you feel day to day.\n\nSo I can come here into the cabin. It’s really quiet at the moment, and I can look out there and see birds. There was an eagle here yesterday. We have bats at night-time. We have a barn owl that comes and visits every now and then and they just glide. That brings me to one of the songs on Sparrow, which is called ‘Passive Glides’.\n\nAha. Beautiful piece.\n\nAnd that’s all about birds. It’s actually written from the point of view of a bird. If you listen, it will probably give you a little bit of context. Now to listen to it again, because it’s particularly around barn owls.\n\nBut all birds, obviously, will fly for a period of time, and then they’ll glide with their wings outstretched. So I had to Google what that terminology was, and it’s called passive gliding. It’s obviously passive, and that’s where the name came from.\n\nSo I tried to build a dynamic in of the bird leaving its nest, taking off, and it’s like propulsion. You can hear the movement of the wings, and it gets intense in the song, and then you can hear the glide. So I’m almost trying to simulate that with music. And actually, I put a thing online when I was writing that song. I was putting up clips of it and I just put it out there, if anyone would like to contribute some bird song.\n\nAnd a couple of people reached out, a couple of artists, people that I connected with online. It was great, because it made people—and this was the feedback from them—it made people stop in their tracks and just go out and be in nature and record the bird song. And I hope, by them doing that, that they also got something from it. That it wasn’t just fulfil Paddy’s song on his app. And most of them came back going, my God, I actually would like to do this more often.\n\nSo it all comes in around that passive gliding and the birds and nature. I won’t say all songs on the album are around nature but most of them have some kind of connection. Like ‘Whispering’. For me, it was really about the effects of the natural world. People are so busy now and everybody’s on their phones and everyone’s disconnected from nature. So ‘Whispering’ was my way of saying: if you disengage from all of this bullshit and noise that’s everywhere, the natural world is talking to you. It’s whispering to you. It’s sending these really quiet messages; but you have to stop to be able to hear, and listen, and if you do that, the reward is massive, cognitively and emotionally. Just to sit with nature. So that’s where that ‘Whispering’ idea came from. Then I was trying to build in the melodies to flow gently with a small bit of dynamic in it, to move from that quieter space and then come back down to it again.\n\nWhen I hear that, what it sounds like is: we’re so used to the phone being on and there’s always music on, of various quality. Then if you silence that, there’s this sound from nature. The sound from nature has clearly not altered; it’s not any louder.** Nature is not trying to sonically compete. It can’t. So it’s whispering but it’s still there. And all you have to do to enrich your life is to quieten the artificial noise for a bit and come to nature and listen; that’s a beautiful idea. If that’s the idea. That’s how it sounds.\n\nNo—you’re right. That’s exactly what it is. And if you think about it, it’s actually really simple, you know? It really is, but people are so busy and they are overwhelmed I suppose by all this sensory input that they’re receiving. That’s my perception of it and I have to cocoon. I call it cocoon because I get overwhelmed as well; I just sensorily overwhelm and auditorily overwhelm as well.\n\nBut where I feel my best is in that quiet solitude of nature.\n\nAnd ‘Retreat’ is another song that’s on there and that’s very much about that. About needing to retreat and needing that solitude and that space. Because I find if I don’t get it, I crave it. If I don’t get it, I am completely discombobulated. Whereas if I can spend some time in nature, even if it’s only 30 minutes just going for a walk, or bringing the dog for a walk, going to the woods, going to the streams or the mountains, or whatever, it’s healing, it really is.\n\nI’m thinking of that walking in the forest, and what that does for you. A native wild forest has a particular sound, a particular atmosphere; it’s got a local climate, nearly. Whatever the climate is outside the forest, it’s not quite the same inside. And that’s one of the most healthy environments. Is it energizing? I’m not sure. I think it probably brings your heart rate down, actually, but it really settles you and heals you just doing that.\n\nIt’s almost like there’s a low level hum or a low level communication that I feel when I’m in that environment, and it’s this unspoken thing. I think if you can experience the quiet for a while, you can carry that with you and that gets me through the day. And it’s just even sometimes my life is very busy, you know, and I crave that solitude.\n\nAnd if I can just get a piece of it, even for 15 minutes, I’m alright, but it’s the day that I can’t that I struggle, so that could come out, then in probably a little bit more of an aggressive piece of music (laughs). It has to come out some way.\n\nI’m just conscious of time, and I have one or two questions that I always have to ask, but I’m just thinking about what you’re saying, and I’m looking outside. We live somewhere not particularly remote, but we are in the country, with lots of trees and plenty of birds, and we have buzzards. It’s always exciting when you hear the buzzards. You always hear the buzzards before you see them. They have a particular call. There’s a family of buzzards near us and I know exactly what tree they live in, and they hatch a baby buzzard every year. So nesting season is a truly exciting time.\n\nBut I just love the difference between being where I am right now, in the kitchen with the wall and door keeping the house quiet—which we need!—and then going outside and just hearing the blue tits and the coal tits and the sparrows. It’s fabulous all year because they never shut up. OK, they don’t sing throughout autumn and winter. The song thrush isn’t as dumbfounding as when you hear it sing in the summer. But the robin keeps singing and all birds keep tweeting at each other. If they’re goldfinches, they keep arguing. And I love that sound.\n\nThe goldfinch—we had them and they were all fighting for space on the little bird feeder for the last while. They can get quite aggressive, can’t they? They can really—put their foot down is the wrong thing to say, but they can put their foot down and it’s entertaining to watch, but I always get a little bit anxious when you see it happen, because you’re trying to figure out: should I intervene? What do I do here? You know? And then I have to put myself back and go, OK, they’re not your children.\n\nSo I just wanted to ask you before we finish—I always have to know what other musicians musicians love. You mentioned Jeff Buckley and Led Zepp, but who do you love that you listen to most now?\n\nI still listen to Jeff Buckley. Less so Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. I still like a little bit of heavy, grungy stuff. I’d be a Pearl Jam fan. I was actually at them in Marlay Park a few weeks ago. I have a group of friends and we’ve loved them since Ten came out in 1991. We’ve been at a lot of their gigs. And Eddie Vedder solo stuff and with Glen Hansard. I’d be a Frames fan and I’d still listen to The Frames quite often, and Glen Hansard’s solo stuff as well. I really like that.\n\nBut I think I’ve gone very instrumental in the last 10 years, and it probably just matches the vein of what I’m trying to do myself. And I’ll throw a few, a few different people at you, and if you don’t know them, certainly you might be interested in going to them anyway.\n\nSo there’s a Danish group, two guys, called Svaneborg Kardyb. I think it’s the two guys’ surnames and it’s as simple as that. But what they are is you have one guy playing a piano and one guy playing drums. And they sit in front of each other or looking at each other, and Svaneborg has a lot of ambient textures going on while he’s playing the piano, but just so beautiful. It is really beautiful.\n\nThere’s two other groups who would be in a kind of a similar vein. You have a group called GoGo Penguin. They’re a UK group. Then another group would be called Mammal Hands. Have you come across them?\n\nEh—no.\n\nWell this music opened up a whole new world. I think I came across GoGo Penguin first. They’re not around all that long, maybe ten years, and I was going back through their stuff and then I ended up coming across Mammal Hands. They’re on the same label or something. And another group then called the Portico Quartet. So a lot of it is very percussive piano, and I think maybe that’s why I was attracted to it. It just has that kind of percussive feel and nice string arrangements and ambient things going on, ambient textures. I love that.\n\nOne more thing.\n\nInstrumental music is where you’ve gone, and I wonder how that worked for you. I remember that happening, so I might tell you how it worked for me and ask how it happened for you.\n\nI remember I was so lyric-focused at first. My first bands, on my schoolbag, in my teens in the late Eighties and early Nineties were R.E.M., Pixies, U2; went on to be American Music Club, Smog, Palace, still so lyrical. Kristin Hersh, who I loved because she sang these mysteriously moving words. They were poetic and you didn’t know what they meant but they meant something. Those songs have never gone away; these words are embedded.\n\nBut in the mid 2000s I had just turned 30, and I started getting into instrumental a bit more. Like Jóhann Jóhannsson, who I got into circa IBM 1401. I understand, maybe correctly, that I needed to change what I listened to because I had more life experience by then so I tended to have a dialogue with the music. Whereas when you’re 15 or 16, you don’t have very much to say back. You’re listening to Michael Stipe singing ‘Untitled’ or ‘World Leader Pretend’ and you’re like, God, this really means something. But then when you’re older, you don’t necessarily need that. You have enough in your experience that the meaning that you hear is based now on the dialogue. Does that make sense to you?\n\nYeah. Absolutely does. And it’s gas—it probably took till you said that and describe it in that way now, because that’s exactly how I feel about it, too. I would have written a lot of lyrics and poetry over the years, and I still delve in and out of that from time to time, the poetry side of it. The lyrics part were always me trying to give out, get rid of something; some sort of negative experience. There was always a very negative thing and an odd time, something a bit happier might come.\n\nBut I think I got to a stage where I got sick of myself, kind of rehashing shite. That’s how I would probably describe it. And you can get caught up in it, I think, as well, and swallowed by it.\n\nSo the instrumental thing was twofold. One, I used to sing in bands, and I am not the greatest singer. I can hold a note and I can carry a song but I absolutely hated singing. It was something that really turned me off. I even stopped gigging because I had to sing. I just got to a stage where I didn’t want to do it anymore. In the last group I was in, I was writing stuff, I was singing, and I was playing guitar. It was five other musicians. We did it for about six years, and it was really good, really interesting, and I enjoyed it, but I got to the stage where I just got sick of it and decided—I’m not doing this anymore.\n\nSo what I did was I took the guitar and I said—I’m going to strip it back and I’m going to start working out really unusual tunings and try to find a new world of instrumental music for myself and try and create that. So I ended up creating my own tunings. Again, didn’t follow any sort of fixed structure. I just played around with what I wanted the strings to sound like, collectively how I wanted to sound.\n\nAnd then again, you hear a lot about drumming and percussion coming in here. I started playing percussive guitar. I was playing very open tunings, but in a percussive way, using the body as a kind of a beat, as well as the strings as melody. And the last gig I actually played was last September. I had the piano, it was mainly the piano, but I brought a guitar just to give it a little bit of variation on the night. And I played three songs that I’d written in a percussive fashion, and it was lovely. It was lovely to do it, and it was almost me saying I still have this, and I know I’ll revisit it, and I’d probably keep revisiting it, because there’s so much more I need to learn and so much more I need to find.\n\nBut the piano for now is definitely the way.\n\nSo I don’t know—does that answer the instrumental thing?\n\nI think once I went into the instrumental world, I completely forgot about writing lyrics anymore. They became unemployed.\n\nBy now it was all: how I was feeling without using words.\n\nBare Bones’ Sparrow, along with EPs Grå, Sleeper, and Petrichor, are available here: https://barebonesmusic.bandcamp.com/album/sparrow.\n\nPaddy O’Mahony’s website is here: https://www.paddyomahony.com/\n\n*Before the interview, while Paddy and I were arranging via email to Google Meet on 5th July, we started chatting about meditation. Meditation is something I now do every day and I find it hugely helpful in a number of ways. Paddy mentioned the legendary Zen meditator and educator Ram Dass and I asked where to start with him. Paddy recommended Ram Dass’s book Be Here Now. He did not recommend Oasis’ album Be Here Now.\n\n** This was not completely accurate: birds have to song louder in certain environments – can I also suggest a listen to The Weather Station’s ‘Parking Lot’, which features a bird that cannot sing adequately to be heard by a potential partner and so lives indefinitely alone.\n\nWe’ll endeavour\n\nTo be here always\n\n‘Good Ship Endeavour’\n\nWe are four, we are your little triumphs\n\nWe are four, we are your little triumphs\n\n‘Little Triumphs’\n\nTo live would be an awfully great adventure\n\n‘A Song For JM Barrie’\n\nIN EARLY FEBRUARY, when Patrick M. Barrett’s plan was to release a remastered vinyl in April of The Hedge School’s 2015 release At The End Of A Winding Day, he messaged me suggesting we could talk about that album and share our conversation here.\n\nThe background for this is that we did the interview for State in 2015 when the second album by The Hedge Schools first came out on Bandcamp. Patrick and I spoke again when The Hedge Schools’s third and final album Magnificent Birds arrived in 2018.\n\nFrom that point Patrick has been a remarkable solo artist, performing as Arrivalists, recording solo singles, EPs and albums at home in the company of his new wife Louise Dredge.\n\nSo I was keen to do an interview because I’ve loved The Hedge Schools’ material since its first release and I admire Patrick’s ongoing output. Still I wasn’t in a position in early spring to meet up, as I’d been on treatment for a neurosurgical illness that can get in the way.\n\nIt then transpired that the plan to release a remastered At The End Of A Winding Day went on hold because Dublin Vinyl, who were going to press the records, went into liquidation in early March. As such, it looked like the vinyl could not happen and Patrick apologised online, although it was far from his fault. However by the end of April, Ray O’Brien of MusicZone in Cork, the renowned record store source of vinyl albums, had taken on the project and, said Patrick, had “saved it”.\n\nAt that point, I was consistently listening to At The End Of A Winding Day in a way that hit me hard—as a husband, a sibling, a son and a Dad; side two especially; the final three songs, arguably, more than any others: ‘Good Ship Endeavour’, ‘October Evenings’, and ‘A Song For JM Barrie’: “To live would be an awfully great adventure”.\n\nReleases like this remind you that there is a shifting dialogue with music that persists for all the time you spend with the songs.\n\nAnd an album like At The End Of A Winding Day largely deals, these days, for me, with how we operate as families of various kinds.\n\nSo when I learned that the vinyl was on the way and I had recovered from symptoms that stopped me writing, I asked Patrick if there was still any scope for us to talk through the album and he said—yep.\n\nWhen I thought through what to focus on in this piece, I first thought we should address the technical matters that Joe Chester and Patrick specialised in. Patrick had kindly bestowed a pre-release vinyl copy of the record on me. So if I wrote about this, a reader and I might grasp the audio difference between the 2015 release and the 2024 reissue and hear it loud and clear: what Patrick called “great moments of joy”.\n\nBut I realised that where I needed to be was dealing with the subject of and expression of enduring familial love—the lyrical content that Patrick’s songs deal with as an ongoing decade-long dialogue. This is mostly what we dealt with, I think, when we spoke on May 6th.\n\nI don’t know enough about production technicalities to do that properly while, in terms of family life, I can hear that At The End Of A Winding Day is the sound of a lover, a son, a brother, and a father. A husband who was not a husband when it first came out and is now. Even I can manage to talk and write about that. There are lessons here about how we live with a family such that they know, indisputably, that we love them, and always will, whether we are still around or not: “We’ll endeavour / To be here always / We’ll endeavour / To be here always”.\n\nNC: Pat, thanks a million for asking me to do this. Before we start, I didn’t want to fail to acknowledge, didn’t your dad pass away just over a year ago? I just wanted to note that because I do know that I didn’t want to not say anything.\n\nPB: Yeah. Well, it was his first. His first anniversary was two days ago, Saturday. Yeah. The old goat.\n\nI just see the way you refer to him and your Mam. How widely acknowledged and well known he was and is in Kilbarrack.\n\nCertainly around Kilbarrack. He was, yeah. He was a formidable figure and not in a bad way or anything, you know, but it’s something. The amount of times that the doorbell would ring at like 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning because somebody in the neighborhood had passed away or whatever else, and the family didn’t know to bury him, you know? Dad would. Dad was the chairman of the residents. He had set up the residents’ association when we moved into Kilbarrack, and then he was the chairman of it for about 15 years.\n\nBut, look, you know, I didn’t always see eye to eye with the man? He was a compulsive gambler. And so a huge part of me going home to look after him and Mam for the last two and a half years was I had to come at him from a place of forgiving, you know what I mean; from a place of forgiveness, and try and just kind of go, look, anything that you didn’t give us as kids, I’m not gonna not give it to you as an adult.\n\nThat doesn’t tarnish the fact that I loved the man, and I was able to express it and was able to tell him, you know, in the last couple of weeks that he was with us. To not be afraid to express that to him, because I think it’s really important to have not left that gone unsaid.\n\nIt’s not a place I would have liked to have been on the far side of it, you know what I mean? So. He was a good man at heart. He had empathy and he had kindness. Despite his own issues.\n\nSorry to launch straight into this but that is so relatable. I’m conscious of an apparent generational shift in parental ability to constantly, repetitively tell their children that they love them—for no apparent reason. Not that our generation didn’t and don’t know our parents loved us, but we’ve mostly been less likely to be told than our kids are—like my three, 9, 12 and 14 years old, and your India, who just turned 18. Do you think that has changed?\n\nI don’t think it has. I think, certainly for Dad’s generation, that was all they knew. It’s that intergenerational trauma that’s kind of like, that’s wandered with them all their lives, you know? And I think we as a generation, we’ve arrived at a place that we know a hell of a lot more about how to look after ourselves, you know?\n\nAnd to not be afraid.\n\nI’m a firm believer in vulnerability being some type of superpower, I really am. And I’m not afraid of wearing the badge and I’m not afraid of showing it. That comes through probably sometimes in the music, but it can be quite evident to a lot of people. And I think that’s one of the reasons why many people gravitate towards the music. So many of the same type of people gravitate towards it. I suppose that’s it, really: you have to be open to feeling things and not to be afraid of that.\n\nBut it’s funny because towards the last, Dad used to always tell a story about one of his brothers, you know. He left one of his brothers, Robert, down at the docks. He put him on a boat in, I think, 1946 or 1947. And his brother turned around to him at the boat when he was putting him on the boat, and he says, Mick, I won’t be back and don’t come looking for me. And about 15 years ago, then, we discovered that Robert had been buried in a pauper’s grave in Manchester.\n\nAnd that generation, there was something really deep about what he was going through as a human to turn around to his youngest brother and say, Look, I won’t be back, mate, and don’t come looking for me. And I often used to think of my Dad kind of with that hanging weapon for so many years, and whether they had the tools to fix that sort of stuff in his generation. I don’t think they did, they just went with it.\n\nAll we found out about him was that he had traveled through – he had basically lived all his life in the Manchester, Birmingham area. He was in London for a while. And then traveled up through Birmingham and Middlesbrough and Manchester.\n\nWell, one of the reasons I really wanted to come back to you after you asked me to talk through the release and I couldn’t was the side two song ‘Good Ship Endeavour’. I’ve always had to play the closing track ‘A Song For JM Barrie’ twice in a row but ‘Good Ship Endeavour’ now wins—three times at least.\n\nLargely because of the image the song opens with of you as a Dad lifting your stepdaughter India as a baby and singing “Sometimes it’s the weight of all / That catches our surprise / Sometimes tears are bound to fall / From your little eyes / We’ll endeavour / To be here always”. As a parent living with grave uncertainty about how long I’ll be here for my children, that pierced my heart.\n\nI always loved ‘Endeavour’ but there was something about the timing of this performance that really hit me. And I don’t know how much we can talk about this or how comfortable you are.\n\nI’ll tell you. Right. Going back to this record, at the time I was writing, and whether you can write about this or not, I don’t know.\n\nAt the time, I was in a relationship where India was involved, who was my stepdaughter. And that relationship ended maybe two years or so after the album first came out. And I think subconsciously at the time, I was writing from a point of view of knowing that the relationship was over, or the relationship with India’s mother was over, but my relationship with India I never wanted to end.\n\nAnd I still, to this day, have an amazing relationship with India. She’ll be 18 years of age in two weeks’ time.\n\nAnd here’s the thing. I think at the time, I was subconsciously writing the end of a relationship while not ever wanting to end the relationship with her. Because she’s an incredible human, you know, an incredible kid. I love her so much. And going back to ‘Good Ship Endeavour’, it’s “We’ll endeavour,” you know. “Sometimes it’s the weight of fall that catches our surprise,” which is basically because I used to revisit how small she was when I went into her life. She was, like, three years of age when I entered her life. And she was 11,12 when we separated.\n\nAnd for me ‘Good Ship Endeavour’ is like, “Sometimes it’s the weight of fall that catches our surprise,” which is me revisiting all those years of actually being with her. And the bigger she became down the years, it’s like you’re growing up. And then “We’ll endeavour to be here forevermore”. Like, you can listen to the lyric in the context of what I’ve just told you now.\n\nAnd I said this to Joe when he was home a couple of weeks ago. We were talking about it, and I said, there’s probably a couple of songs. Like ‘Home’ (“Feel awakened in the morning / Like the early dawn of summer / You are life / You are home/ In the morning / When I’m needed / You’re my life’s blood / And I bleed it / You are life / You are home”). It’s probably exactly the same. I think I was writing them subconsciously, not knowing. Or deep down I knew, but at the time had never voiced it to anybody else apart from the guitar. If that makes sense. And so for me, it’s quite a vulnerable record. Without a shadow of a doubt it is.\n\nVulnerability in music is also courage. It’s a gift to the listener. Because you are articulating something in a room with a guitar to yourself. And that process can help by itself, because you now understand an emotion that’s painful and difficult to understand. Then you make a connection and it’s easier to endure or to bear what you’re going through. Then when you take that and you record it, that means that somebody else who’s had a similar experience of suffering can hear what you’re saying, you know? And it’s not a poem and not just a lyric. We can read what you’re saying but we also hear it and feel it such that it is physical as much as cerebral. It’s the sound. It’s the various layers in which your voice is operating along with the piano, guitar, trumpet, and cello. So one of the things that’s so admirable and enduring about this album and about your other records and songs is the bravery of them – their sharing, their honesty, their un-shy vulnerability.\n\nBeing honest, that sort of vulnerability hasn’t always been my best friend. It’s not as if it’s some sort of invisible cloak that keeps you safe, you know, it’s not. Because in the power of being able to sit and write them or, as you say, if you call it bravery, to be able to sit and write like that, sometimes, you know, those are sliding down the far side of the mountain moments. You know, that way for me.\n\nSo I have to be remarkably conscious of – just taking The Last Of The Written Pages as an example, which is the Arrivalists thing, the first thing that I did, which is a record that I basically made looking after Mam and Dad for two years, plus COVID, you know, but that I had no other way of functioning. I had no other way of processing looking after two old people for the last couple of years of their lives, apart from writing about it, you know? And within that, I’m ultra-aware of the fact that I had three siblings and it wasn’t a case of, like, I just didn’t want to paint something that was very much one sided, you know.\n\nBut at the end of the day, what’s on that record is my point of view, you know? Or my experiences.\n\nAre you saying that if you articulate where you’re coming from, then that can occlude where other people are, can make it seem like they’re not as involved, or…\n\nYeah, it’s like you always have to have a fine line with that sort of stuff, particularly. With that record, let’s say, you know, and even with what I’ve just said to you about ‘Good Ship Endeavour’, I’m always aware of the fact that somebody else is involved in the equation of what I’m talking to you about. So that’s always a fine line, but I don’t know whether what I’ve done for the last couple of years with records and stuff, whether it’s cathartic or whether it’s something that I treat as being cathartic. I deliberately made a choice to not sit and write this year. Just to give myself a break and, you know, and see what happens. I haven’t deliberately picked up the guitar in months. You know, which for me is really strange.\n\nI was gonna ask. That’s actually one of my little questions that I’ve written: are you keeping going? Because I, for some reason, I had that notion. I thought I’d seen you make a reference to it maybe somewhere about how you were maybe quietening. Whether that’s just a point you’re at.\n\nJust turning down the volume, you know. Because, within that, every time you put something out, you have to be really active. You have to be on social media. You have to be doing this, you have to be doing that. And it’s just so tiring, you know. And I’ve stepped into a new role in work where it’s gonna demand a lot of my time. So, I kind of didn’t have the head space for it. You know, and being honest, since myself and Louise got married, I wanted to spend some time, and not be up here in the evening. Because we have a little kind of office room, studio room, which I use in the evenings, you know, that’s where I am at the moment. I didn’t want to be doing that, you know. Let’s sit downstairs and read a book or let’s watch something on the TV. Let’s go for a walk in the evenings when we both come home from work. I think I owed myself that. Certainly after two years of looking after Mam and Dad, you know, so I didn’t. And that’s not to say, you know, I won’t pick up the guitar in December and start working on something.\n\nI’m thinking about how songs evolve. For me right now, ‘Good Ship Endeavour’ is a palpable example. We have kids who are 14, 12, and nearly nine. And I was last week listening to ‘Good Ship Endeavour’ on the mower. We have a tractor mower, that’s the one chore I actually enjoy, but I had to pull over because I was listening to this song, its intimate prayer that a parent gets to stay forever with and look after his child, and it hit me. I remembered Olivia, who is 14, who was at her first proper gig the other night. She saw Olivia Rodrigo and she loved her. And I just remembered so much.\n\nIt feels like seconds ago that she was born in October 2009, and everything changed immediately, permanently. I remember holding her, how she could lie on my left forearm, and putting her first nappy on, being shown by a midwife how to do this and with her in my arms everything being instantly totally different.\n\nAnd one of the things about learning that you are sick, knowing that things are serious, is that you do tend to be a little bit less shy about telling people just how important they are. Anyway, I think that was it when I recently heard “We’ll endeavour to be here always / We’ll endeavour to be here always”—just that—that the song evolved. Largely because when you develop a serious illness, being here always becomes a less realistic prospect.\n\nYeah. You know, I think when you’ve something that’s so precious, you almost feel like it’s more precious than yourself.\n\nAnd that’s, well, that’s probably not always a good place to be. You find the lines there, really, I suppose, but going back to what I was saying about that, I think subconsciously, I was very aware that if I stepped out of that relationship that, you know, the ripples or the peripheral damage of stuff like that. Or, you know, my kind of hymn to her was to basically go—I’ll always endeavour to be here. And, you know, I still am. I didn’t abandon the ship, as the man says.\n\nBut I think that’s so much about the values that my mother gave me, you know? You dig in and you hang on and the beautiful things remain the beautiful things. They might be slightly frayed around the edges, but you’ve done your best. You’ve done your utmost to limit the damage. But going back to what you were saying there, it’s important to let people know. And I do wish that we all had more of an understanding of our lives, you know, apart from crisis moments that you might have in your life, if we actually expressed our love for each other more than just waiting for the crisis. I’m a huge advocate of that.\n\nI think there isn’t a half-hour goes by that I don’t tell Louise that I love her. Because I think it fills you, you know, throughout the day if she’s having a shit day and I tell her I love her, you know, it’s not.\n\nAnd it’s the same with you with Olivia and the other kids, I’m sure it’s the same.\n\nIt’s just like, you know, let them know that. You know, you’re marking them throughout the day, and you’re aware of their presence throughout the day. And that was something that my father was not great at. And I look at my two brothers now who have, Dermot has three kids, John has two, and they are incredible parents. They have incredible relationships with their kids. And I think it all stems from encouragement. It all stems from just letting somebody know that you’re there for them. But I do think as a society, we probably should get a hell of a lot better at telling people.\n\nBut as you say that, I know I was talking about Olivia and Michael and Evan, but Sharon, we’ve been married for a good while now, and it was not until we got together when I was 27, I mean it’s comical how long it took me to figure out how to go out with somebody, and I only figured out because she taught me. So we got together then, and she did so many things, and one of them was to say I love you and it did not have to be a special occasion.\n\nBefore her, growing up, I love you was a fairly rare thing to hear. And you knew that there was no question but that you were loved, but you didn’t hear it. And then Sharon said it frequently, and I remember I got a bit panicky. And she was like—it’s just a thing you say. I mean, that’s one of the best lessons I’ve ever had, that you can just say it and it’s never bad.\n\nYeah. We grew up in a house where, as you said, it was evident that we were loved, but Mam and Dad’s relationship was very functional. There was never any expression of any of that. We didn’t grow up in a house seeing that, which makes me think it’s quite beautiful that the four of us, like, people often say to us that it’s an astonishing turn of events that the four of you are so rounded. Because even Louise, on the day we got married, she was going your family are just fucking amazing, you know, because you’re just so close, the four of yous. And we are, four of us, although we all live in different parts of the planet. We have a bond, and I think that bond was forged because we grew up in a house where things weren’t ideal, you know?\n\nAnd that brought you together to fortify each other.\n\nYeah. The solid unit, you know? Like, if one of us is in trouble, the other three are standing behind them, you know? Ready to go.\n\nAre you very close in age?\n\nBernadette is a year older than me, and Dermot and John are quite close in age. Dermot is—John just turned 51, Dermot is 53. There’s 18 months between the two of them and myself and Bernadette. Yeah, there’s 18 months. A year and a half between the two of us.\n\nOK. I particularly wanted to ask you about this. I’m fascinated when an album unveils itself to you in some way. One of the things I am always fascinated by is the dialogue between listener and record. And I’m always curious about what you musicians are into that’s not your own. I’m wondering about your experience. So then, can you think of good examples of that happening—where an album has changed for you over the years or an album has evolved, or how you hear it is different than it used to be.\n\nI don’t know. Like—I think we all listen to music quite differently, that we all have our different ways of coming at things. I know there are albums that are absolute lighthouse albums, and whose context that I listen to them in. Let’s take for example, it’s probably a really vivid example, that Blue Nile record being 40 years old this week—Walk Across The Rooftops. And I certainly would go back. I certainly would go back to my first time hearing it. And I still have, it’s a bone of contention between myself and my sister because she brought the record home. She brought it home on vinyl. And it’s one of the original—it’s the Linn pressing. It’s a very early pressing. And I remember bringing it home and the two of us sitting at home, we were whatever age, we were listening to it and just going, what is this? This is astonishing, you know? What is this?\n\nYou were young, right?\n\nYeah. Well, if it came out 40 years ago on the first time I heard it, so what am I now, 55?\n\nSo, yeah, swear to God, it’s that age, isn’t it. Olivia was at Olivia Rodrigo this week and she’s 14 and a half. I heard Pixies’ Doolittle and R.E.M.’s Green when I was 14 going on 15. I’d heard other stuff before them, but this was stuff that stayed with me.\n\nYeah, I suppose there are pivotal ages. When I think you may be trying to find a little bit of who you are in the world. You know, if that makes sense. And I just resonated towards the absolute static silence of that Blue Nile record. I absolutely adored it and I adore it to this day.\n\nAnd it’s funny listening back to the test pressings of the vinyl of At The End Of A Winding Day. The man who did them for me is a guy called Neville. And he told me that the test pressings were in. And I said, great, I’ll go over and pick them up. He said, no you won’t, I’ll drop them to you in the house. I was going, that’s very kind of you.\n\nSo he came in and I put it on the turntable. And the gap between track one and track two, which is the title track and then ‘Sleeping Song’, I’d forgotten about. There’s almost a minute of a kind of static noise that Joe had deliberately left on I think the actual tape machine. And we’d left it on and then the ambient guitar lifts up and you can hear the track. But when we were listening to it the other day on the test pressing, I thought there was something wrong with the pressing, because it was going I can’t hear anything. And your man never was just standing back, he was going, no, there is something there. Just wait for it. He says, I’ve listened to it, you know, and then it lifts up to the ambient guitar piece.\n\nBut it’s like going back to that Blue Nile thing. I listened to that record again four or five times during the week, and it still lifts me in the same way. It still moves me in the same way, and it still takes me back to listening to it for the first time, knowing what that felt like. And even at that age, wanting to go, right, I’d love to make music like that, I’d love to make something that sounds like that. And I think probably when we sat down to start working on At The End Of A Winding Day, years and years ago, that was Joe and myself, that was our template. It was like, let’s make a record, like Walk Across The Rooftops, which we didn’t in the end. Well, sonically we didn’t, but maybe there’s a tone there.\n\nBut I think I probably talked to you before about Buchanan’s vulnerability and the way he writes. It’s not an easy place to write from. It’s just not, you know, or I would imagine it’s not.\n\nI don’t know whether that answers your question about listening back to records and stuff. One of my other works is Hope Sandoval’s Bavarian Fruit Bread. I don’t know, do you know that?\n\nI do, but not that well. It’s Hope Sandoval plus the guy from My Bloody Valentine, isn’t it?\n\nYes. Colm Ó Ciosóig. They actually recorded it in the Cauldron studio, where we did the first Hedge Schools record. They recorded bits and pieces of it in there for Colm Ó Ciosóig from My Bloody Valentine. But that’s a record that—it’s just one of those one in the morning records. It’s like the most beautiful glass of red wine and just brings me to a place. Brings me always to the exact same place. Songs like ‘Butterfly Mornings’. And it’s just so stark and so beautiful.\n\nAnd then, you know, Stina Nordenstam’s And She Closed Her Eyes. It’s just like—where do you go with a record? When you’re talking about how does the process of writing start? When you ask me about how does it even start. I mean, I’ve often been baffled about how the process of writing that record started for Stina Nordenstam. How did it even start? It’s just like, what did she go into the studio with—with a song and written on a guitar? I don’t think so. Because when you listen to that, that just sounds to me like a band who spent three years in a room making noise and glued it all together into the most beautiful record. It’s one of my favorite records of all time.\n\nI must go back to her. That must be 30 years ago, is it? I associate her with No Disco.\n\nYeah. And She Closed Her Eyes. My God, what a record that is. Always brings me again to the same place.\n\nAnd I don’t know, when you’re talking about the first time you hear something, it’s quite obvious to me that, like, if something resonates with you to such a degree when you listen to it for the first time, that you’re always gonna go back to that emotion. I think you’re always gonna go back to that emotion. You know?\n\nWhich is, going back to Winding Day, when I’m investing time listening to it recently, which I have quite a lot now, but I’m going back to where I was ten years ago. Are there places where I was sitting in my head ten years ago? That’s not always a nice place to be, you know?\n\nAnd it’s funny because I’ve spoken to Louise about it, and Louise knows where I was at at the time writing that record. Because I think it’s really important to have that kind of openness about—here’s where I was, here’s what this record’s about, you know?\n\nWell. I think when it comes to the way that albums change or don’t change, you know, that’s a function of the listener, really, isn’t it?\n\nYes, absolutely, it is. And I also think it’s where the listener is sitting at a time, Niall. I really do. Like, if you’re having a really bad day or if somebody’s sitting and you’re having a bad day, in many ways you can probably build kind of cobwebs into whatever it is somebody is singing to. You’ll find a junction into something that matters to you, you know?\n\nI’m so glad that you mentioned Paul Buchanan, because I always remember meeting him, just once. I interviewed him 20 years ago when High came out. And I always remember how pleasurable it was. How daunted I was because it was Paul Buchanan, but how undaunted he made you feel. Have you met Paul?\n\nNo. I haven’t, I wish I did. He just strikes me as somebody who’s very unaffected – you know, what he writes about is what you get when you’re talking to him, I would imagine.\n\nYeah. He was unaffected. I met him upstairs in that Ballsbridge Hotel. The Four Seasons. In a room on the top of it, and I went in and he was smiling and it seemed daft to him that journalist after journalist was coming in at the top of this five star hotel. He was very good at putting you at your ease. And I think he had a sense about him that he thought it was silly that he was so revered, but he understood that he was, and he wasn’t gonna lie about that.\n\nThis was 2004, so this was pre-streaming. And I remember as I was leaving, sharing this love for record shops with Buchanan. We had this little nod and pleasurable agreement at the end about how whenever you walk into a record shop everything is there. Everything you’re going to need to know; all your emotions are articulated somewhere in that shop. That lifts my heart even now.\n\nOne of the things I have ended up pondering a lot, since a serious diagnosis, is what’s the best way of using the time you have, no matter how much that is. There are various ways and for me, I believe, if you’re just listening to music, not a moment is wasted. Not a second is wasted. Like, when you and I finish up now, I’m going to have bits to do, but I’m gonna put music on. Because music is always the right thing to do. It’s always conveying to you. It’s teaching you. It’s connecting you with how you feel. It’s explaining to you how you’re feeling, even when there are no words; it’s doing all of that. It’s time never wasted, right to the end. It’s just such a gift, you know?\n\nYeah, it is. It’s the greatest. I think one of the greatest gifts that was given to us as kids is that we all wandered into music in some form or fashion. And Mam and Dad never said no.\n\nAnd I might have said this to you before, but it was never like, okay, what are you doing? It was never questioned. And it is one of the greatest things. It’s one of the greatest gifts of my lifetime, let’s put it that way. And when you talk about, like, there’s been two Arrivalist records, there’s been three Hedge Schools records, you know? And like I said, whether there’ll be more or not, I don’t know, but it is the greatest gift that I have to be able to go: right, OK, well, there can be more. If I want there to be more, there can be more.\n\nAnd I don’t ever take that for granted, you know? It’s a great joy. Some of the most beautiful people who’ve wandered in and out of my life down the years are musicians. And the greatest life-affirming moments that I’ve had are from people who listen to the music, and the music has affected them in such a way that it’s just, like, beyond anything I ever thought when you’re sitting in a studio making a bit of work with somebody. You know. You can only hope that it touches people. And then it does, and then you find yourself going: oh right, OK.\n\nI remember when I was living in Kilkenny. Johnny Holden, who runs Cleere’s, rang me. I was having a run or something around the park. Johnny said, are you in the town? I said—yeah. He says, there’s a woman in Cleere’s wants to see you. And I went, OK—who is she? And he said, she’s some American woman. And her husband came to the bar, and he was looking for you. He said he knew you lived in Kilkenny.\n\nSo I said, Johnny, I’m in my running gear but I’ll be down in five minutes. So I went down and this woman was in the bar and herself and her husband had seen us playing as part of the Arts festival in Kilkenny the year previous or a year and a half previously. And she had bought Magnificent Birds. And she bought At The End Of A Winding Day in Rollercoaster. And the husband sat. I said, how’s it going, pleased to meet yous. And Johnny introduced us. And I sat down with them, they were having a bit of lunch. And she just started crying.\n\nAnd I was going, well, I said, are you okay? And the husband said – she cannot believe how you have just wandered in here, she said, because she was after having cancer, and she was going through chemo, and she had spent a year on the sofa listening to Magnificent Birds and listening to At The End Of A Winding Day. And she said, I’ve never had the ability to float above my body. Then what your records did for me.\n\nAnd I’m sitting there in my running gear and just going, oh my God.\n\nI was in tears. You’ve no concept of how profound stuff can be to people sometimes, you know? And then all of a sudden, it’s like I’m sitting in front of this woman who could do nothing more than just thank me.\n\nIt was so beautiful, you know?\n\nAnd I wandered out of there and I floated home.\n\nAt The End Of A Winding Day is released on vinyl on June 7th.\n\nThe album is available at https://www.musiczone.ie/\n\nArrivalists are at https://thehedgeschools.bandcamp.com/album/its-own-time\n\nWhen I started writing Gold Soundz essays, the method for choosing the song to write about was to randomly pick one from a playlist of songs that give me goosebumps. Although John Lennon’s ‘Love’ is on that list, it was not chosen by Tidal shuffle. ‘Love’ selected itself by being in my ears, head and heart for the entire last ten days, so that I can’t let go of it. “Love is real / Real is love” is a May mantra.\n\nIt’s hard to be sure why a song implants itself like this, particularly one you’ve heard hundreds of times, and writing can help figure that out. Then maybe you can stop listening obsessionally and move on to the next song. Still, right now I want to keep listening to ‘Love’. Every so often you go through a phase with a song when others seem unnecessary: this song does everything that songs are supposed to so it’s the only one I need.\n\nWhich begs the question: what are songs supposed to do? Can one song do it all?\n\nI mean: songs do all kinds of things. They keep us company. They make strangers into friends. They educate and exhilarate. They speed up then slow down your pulse rate. They provide an auditory environment that improves focus and aids writing (thank you Stars of the Lid). They soundtrack a mosh or a Macarena.\n\nBut I’m thinking here about songs that operate on a particular level, that are existential as well as exciting. Not to be too hierarchical but I bow most deeply to songs that tackle core questions we are trying to answer ourselves and can’t. Songs that help us make sense of life when it seems strange and nonsensical. Songs that find peace for us when we can’t find it. One song can do all that for a while and usually this is through our dialogue with the song rather than its monologue. The listener is a co-writer. I listened to ‘Blue And Grey Shirt’ by American Music Club on repeat in late 1992, early 1993, because when Mark Eitzel sang “I sat up all morning / And I waited for you” I knew exactly what he was saying and no-one else said it like him. I needed to listen to his generous song of loneliness to process that awful emotion. The song, which was of love as well as loneliness, was of immense practical emotional help. I haven’t needed it since, but it still means so much and I’ve needed many other songs along the road. John Cusack in High Fidelity asks: Which came first, the music or the misery? It is so obvious that it was the misery. Music is not toxic. It is nothing but healing.\n\nPart of why ‘Love’ is loveable is because of its context. It comes on halfway through John’s 1970 Plastic Ono Band, his first solo album, also known as the Primal Scream album, which has John’s enduring emotional injury arising in childhood as the subject of most of its songs. ‘Love’ comes on and soothes for a while although ‘God’ arrives soon after (“God is a concept / By which we measure our pain”).\n\nThe album starts with ‘Mother’, in which John addresses his mum, Julia, and his dad, Alfred. Alfred, who had left John and Julia when John was three, was alive in 1970. Julia had died in 1958 when John was 17. She had not taken care of him for more than a few weeks since he was five. The lyric of ‘Mother’ begins: “Mother / You had me / But I never had you / I wanted you / But you didn’t want me”. John’s mother was the subject of ‘Julia’ on The White Album too but that was a shimmering declaration of filial love (“So I sing the song of love / Julia”) rather than a song about being abandoned (“Mama don’t go / Daddy come home”).\n\nThe album ends with ‘My Mummy’s Dead’, a song in which John still sounds grievously wounded, although differently. He sings the brutal lyrics in a nursery rhyme melody as if the only way he can sing them is pretend they are fantasy: “I can’t explain / So much pain / I could never show it / My mummy’s dead”.\n\nSo in the midst of all this skin-peeling pain comes the grounding, gratitude and grace of ‘Love’.\n\n‘Love’ is not healing in some straightforward way. It has its own ambiguity: “Love is needing / needing love” is sung by someone who spent childhood years without enough love and who had, when leaving his first wife Cynthia, left his first-born son bereft of paternal love as he was left himself.\n\nStill I think ‘Love’ can be said to be mostly healing because it says: even when you went through all the abandonment John went through since age three, you can fully experience love (“Love is you / You and me / Love is knowing / We can be”). Then, pained though ‘God’ is, John ends that song declaring that he no longer believes in anyone but “Yoko and me / And that’s reality”, and ‘God’ becomes an epiphany in that moment. Even for a Beatle—a person at the highest peak of human achievement—there is no moment more exquisite than the moment union with your soul mate begins. When your perspective on life changes because you experience life through her eyes, not just your own, and your life is so much richer than it was ten minutes ago.\n\nHence, those of us who are not Beatles can experience the pinnacle of happiness, which for John was not his career peak (‘A Day In The Life’ in 1967) but was meeting Yoko in the Indica Gallery in 1966. Like my Mam and Dad meeting in the TV Club in 1966. Like, for me, the July 2001 Monday when I walked into the Pearse St Drug Treatment Centre having just started training there, when I found Sharon working as a nurse and when she smiled at me and the rest of the room blurred and faded from sound and view. Or the moment a few weeks later, about 48 hours into our offically going out, that we each realised we wanted to have a baby, each said so, and neither of us panicked and ran away. Or early 2002, when Sharon and I returned from Paris and I was expecting the pining melancholy I’d always experienced on a return from holiday but I realised: wait it doesn’t matter at all where I am any more—not if she’s there. I don’t have a 1967 Sergeant Pepper moment to compare these to but they were more ‘Oh My Love’ moments anyway: “Oh my lover for the first time in my life / My eyes are wide open / Oh my lover for the first time in my life / My eyes can see”.\n\nWhat ‘Love’ reminds me is that a song meets you emotionally where you are and a fine song may do this once while some songs meet you many times when you are in different places throughout your life.\n\nI am connecting with ‘Love’ in May 2023 in a way that I could not have done at Christmas 1990, when I first heard the Plastic Ono Band album. Back then my notions of love were mostly as you would expect from a socially struggling adolescent listening to The Smiths. The song detailing my “love” life at the time was ‘How Soon Is Now’. The scene from the club where you’d like to go, “So you go and you stand on your own / And you leave on your own / And you go home / And you cry and you want to die”, felt true and not melodramatic. Just as Morrissey’s praise of death by double-decker bus in ‘There Is A Light That Never Goes Out’ felt like a perfect, pure way of sharing a fate with the one you loved while now it seems tragically life-negating. The Morrissey lyric argues against sharing everyday life with a person you love, because they may find it difficult to love you back, because the lightning bolt of early love can’t last and because the daily is dull. Every day is like Sunday, Morrissey would later add. Well, not if you love they’re not.\n\nWhat other songs say is that young love matures, expands, and improves, like the love in Teenage Fanclub’s ‘I Don’t Want Control Of You’: “I don’t want control of you / It doesn’t matter to me / Don’t want this love to stay the same / But grow with every year / And every day I look in a different face / The feelings getting stronger with every embrace”. In 1984’s ‘Grow Old With Me’, a song that’s so beautiful but hard to listen to as John Lennon never got to enact it, John sang“Grow old along with me / The best is yet to be / When our time has come / We will be as one / God bless our love”, an attitude to sticking with, or merging with, your true love that I share now so much more than that of ‘There Is A Light That Never Goes Out’. “Love is living / living love”, sings John Lennon in ‘Love’, and in 1990 I didn’t understand him. I didn’t listen. Now it’s the truest couplet.\n\nIn fairness to Morrissey, ‘There Is A Light That Never Goes Out’ and even ‘How Soon Is Now’ feel lyrically alien in 2023 not because of anything he said forty years ago but because at this time soundtracks to loneliness, Smiths songs that gently squeeze your solitary shoulder, are surplus to requirements. I have stupendously lucked out with an utter lack of loneliness in the last twenty-two years since I met my one true love and I can’t remember what loneliness even feels like. (16-year-old me would be: Wow.)\n\nLike other John Lennon songs, ‘Love’ is one I find more poignant than I might otherwise because he didn’t have long enough and things ended so quickly. It focuses my mind on music’s attempts to find meaning in life including making peace with the difficult fact that life often ends too early. Even in normal length lives, loss does loom. I think I am attached to this song now because it is such a simple gentle statement of what is most important in the life you share with your loved ones. When you recognise that life is not infinite, you find yourself feeling like you were twelve years old two days ago and you find yourself also asking: what is the best way of using the time that is left?\n\nThe answer is in this song and it is stated clearly without drama: it’s to give and receive love. To do so casually day to day, hour to hour. Don’t put off the precise expression of love and make sure that all those you love and value know it. Earlier I wrote that ‘Love’ does exactly what songs are supposed to and for ‘Love’ to provide elegant guidance on how to experience love and maximise its joyful expression seems to be as useful as a song can be. Life doesn’t go on forever and if you were to be in your final hours knowing that everyone you loved will always know that you loved them—as my mum knew last June, to pick a not entirely random example—then that exit is as good as it can be.\n\nIn ‘Love’, John equates loving and receiving love with other acts. Love is touch, touch is love. Love is reaching, reaching love. Love is asking to be loved. I think of his line “Love is touch, touch is love” now, and I gratefully recall some of the many hugs I’ve been glad to have. I think of our youngest child, who, watching Teen Titans or Totoro on the couch or reading The Beano, whether heading off to sleep or just after waking, likes having his head on your chest and his hand on your belly. I don’t know if I’ve paid more attention to this because of an increasing awareness of the hasty passage of precious time, but I do know that there’s no experience more precious than this, and that an everyday event can be the most magical one.\n\nIt was wonderful that John Lennon, who was given so little love as a boy, could develop his ability to love others heading into his thirties. As the years pass, the most important thing about love is how it continues. Its recipients benefit from it not just when it’s given but throughout their lives. Others benefit too. Think of the grandchildren whose Granny and Granda taught Daddy how to love. Love goes on.\n\nI sometimes think about John’s ‘Love’, the acts and states of being that John equated with love, and the song’s haiku brevity, and I wonder—did he leave anything out?\n\nWell. Love is comfort, comfort love. Love is courage, courage love. Love is caring, caring love. But love is not completely straightforward. Love is concern. Love is grief. Love is trepidation. Love is longing.\n\nTo say that these are positives and negatives is to realise that loving someone is not only elevating your life to heights it cannot otherwise attain but also that loving someone is setting you and that person up for mighty loss. At some point sadness like no other will ensue. One could say that the worst thing about a person dying is not what they themselves lose but the pain their passing causes to those who loved and love them.\n\nIn John’s ‘Love’ I hear him sing “Love is you / You and me / Love is knowing / We can be”. I hear the present tense in this but in a song like ‘Love’ I also hear an eternal tense. Though we won’t both be around forever, our love lives on and our relationship remains. Love you gave is love you can still give even after death and it stays imprinted in the person you gave it to. I feel that in what my Mum gave, which I still carry in my bones.\n\nThat’s why giving love right now is the best use of what time you have. Love causes grief but also strengthens those you love so they can be as strong and happy as possible and that’s what I have to believe matters most. John from early on and right through The Beatles felt not good enough until Yoko arrived. When we are loved enough, for long enough, love can ease the feeling of failure that is so familiar, that constant worry that we can never be a good enough person. Love can ease this agitation. Love is real, real is love, sang John, and he covered almost all bases in this perfect song. He could have added one thing: love is peace, peace is love.\n\nWendy Smith and Niall Crumlish talk through how a song, story, and sunlight collaboration begins.\n\nAcoustic Mirror\n\nBy Wendy Smith.\n\nEarly morning on Wednesday 31st August while still in bed before getting ready for work, I checked my Twitter feed. At 7.15 am, I received a direct message from Niall Crumlish. The message started with “Just want to say I’m in hospital, I am going to theatre. I am going there now.”\n\n“Right”, I thought, sipping my first Earl Grey tea of the day, barely awake.\n\nUntil that moment, Niall had been a Twitter acquaintance. I’d read his pieces on his brilliant blog Psychiatry and Songs and admired his writing about music, which details his close listening to a huge range of songs and artists. His knowledge of music is vast.\n\nHe told me he needed surgery. It sounded serious. He said the song holding him up that morning was ‘Life of Surprises’. It was moving to hear the music of Prefab Sprout, my work, Paddy and Mart’s, was woven into his life, including ‘the best elements’ of his life. He was going into theatre singing a line from a Sprout song that he heard in my voice: “Just say that you were happy, as happy would allow / And tell yourself that that will have to do for now”. This was undoubtedly an unexpected moment in Niall’s life, in his work and family life. I wondered what the surgery might mean, what exactly was going on. It seemed significant that Niall reached out to share this moment in such a direct way. I wanted to respond in a meaningful way.\n\nBefore receiving this surprising early morning message, I had often thought Niall would be a good collaborator. We share an intense passion for music, an interest in how music sustains us, how our stories can be told through the music we love and how it helps us make sense of the world.
