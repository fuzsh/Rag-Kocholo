Tijuana.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\n>> I'm taking a party down there Sunday morning.\n\n>> How do you like this guy?\n\nHe gets paid to go fishing while we slave over a hot carburetor.\n\n>> You said it.\n\n>> Hey, Dan, we got room for one more.\n\nWhy don't you come along?\n\n>> When are you gonna get back?\n\n>> Late Monday night.\n\n>> Monday night, that lets me out.\n\nI couldn't get Monday off.\n\n>> You could get away if you wanted to.\n\nYou just don't want to miss spending Sunday with the girlfriend.\n\n>> Helen?\n\nNah, they busted up a couple of months ago.\n\nBy the way, she called you again this morning.\n\n>> She did?\n\n>> I told her you wasn't in for the 19th time.\n\n>> Good, good.\n\n>> How do you like this guy?\n\nThere's a dame I'd trade my right arm for, and he gives her the runaround.\n\n>> Maybe he's found a new dish.\n\n>> I spent four years in the Navy fighting for freedom.\n\nWhy get anchored down now?\n\nBesides, she was getting too serious.\n\n>> There were wedding bells, huh?\n\n>> They were getting louder and louder.\n\nI figure she's too nice to string along.\n\nShe won't take no for an answer.\n\n>> Some dames are sure hard to shake off.\n\nI once knew a blonde.\n\nBoy, she-- >> And her name was Margie.\n\n>> How did you know?\n\n>> We've heard this story a dozen times.\n\n>> A couple of dozen times.\n\n>> Hey, we better be getting back or old man Mackey will blow a fuse.\n\n>> Right.\n\nHere, that's for you.\n\nHey.\n\nSome babe.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> See you later, fellas.\n\nLittle work to do.\n\nYou new here, honey?\n\n>> 65 out of a dollar.\n\n>> What time do you get off tonight?\n\n6:30, 7:00?\n\n>> Don't forget your change.\n\n>> I happen to have my autograph book here with me.\n\nName and address?\n\n>> I'm afraid you've made a mistake.\n\nI don't come with the merchant's lunch.\n\n>> Oh, now don't be like that.\n\nI think you're wonderful.\n\nAnything wrong in that?\n\n>> No, but-- >> Well, then how about you and me tonight, huh?\n\n>> I work tonight.\n\n>> Till when?\n\n>> Till 9:30.\n\nYou like Red Nichols and his outfit?\n\n>> Yeah, I think they're great.\n\n>> They're playing over at the music bar on the pier.\n\nI thought I'd pick you up after 9:30, and we'll go over and give them a listen, okay?\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> See you tonight.\n\n>> 75 out of one.\n\n>> Hey, Chuck.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\n>> I just remembered something.\n\n>> Remembered what?\n\n>> It's five days until payday, and I'm flat busted.\n\nHow are you holding?\n\n>> I'm scratchin'.\n\n>> Me too.\n\nWell, I gotta figure out some way to get some geedis, or how else am I gonna take that gorgeous creature out to the music bar?\n\n>> Why don't you ask old man Mackey for an advance?\n\n>> Oh, that old guy.\n\nHe wouldn't give you the sweat off his glasses.\n\n>> Yeah, he's sure a mean old buzzard.\n\n>> Hey, buzzard.\n\nI'm glad you said that.\n\nBuzz Larson owes me twenty bucks.\n\n>> Why don't you call him up down at the dock?\n\n>> My friend, you have just read my mind.\n\n(Dan whistling) Hello, is Buzz Larson there, please?\n\nOh, hello, Buzz.\n\nHiya, boy, this is Dan.\n\nListen, could you let me have that twenty bucks you owe me?\n\nOh, that's swell.\n\nBelieve me, you're a life saver.\n\nI'll be down tonight and pick it up.\n\nHuh?\n\nTomorrow?\n\nOh, wait a minute, boy.\n\nI need it right away.\n\nYou don't get paid until tomorrow.\n\nYeah, I understand, sure.\n\nOkay, all right.\n\nThanks anyway, kid.\n\nBye.\n\n>> Who left that light on in the washroom?\n\n>> Not me.\n\n>> Well, it was one of you fellas.\n\nYou're all alike.\n\nYou don't care what you do with my money.\n\nYou think I own stock in the power company?\n\n>> So she said to me, \"I want to speak to the supervisor.\"\n\nSo I said, \"One moment, please.\"\n\nAnd then I said, \"Yes, this is the supervisor speaking.\"\n\nHelen Coggin, are you listening to me?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> I don't think you've heard one word.\n\nYou just seem to be walking around in a dream lately.\n\n>> Oh, Millie, I think I'll say goodbye to you here.\n\nThere are some things I have to get.\n\n>> What things?\n\nWhere?\n\n>> Oh, just some things over on State Street.\n\n>> I know where you're going, Helen, and you're making a big mistake.\n\nIf he wants to see you, he knows your telephone number.\n\n>> I know, but I-- >> But nothing.\n\nYou're making a fool of yourself.\n\n>> I don't think I am.\n\nGoodbye, Millie.\n\n>> Well, when you need it fast sometimes, you haven't got time.\n\n>> A lighter.\n\n>> What?\n\n>> A standard lighter.\n\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\nNo, no, not you, Ed.\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nWell, if you haven't got it, you can't lend it to me.\n\nYeah, all right.\n\nThanks a lot, bye.\n\n>> Did you reach Buzz?\n\n>> Yeah, I called him, Ray Chris, and Jimmy Cook, all of 'em.\n\nNone of 'em have it.\n\n>> Too bad.\n\n>> $1.03.\n\n>> Exact change.\n\n>> There you go.\n\nNobody checks my cash except this once-a-week bookkeeper, and he don't come around till Thursday.\n\nI could put it back before Thursday.\n\nI could put it back tomorrow as soon as I get that twenty bucks from Buzz.\n\n(bell ringing) (time clock ringing) >> Dan.\n\nOh, Danny.\n\n>> Oh, hello, Helen.\n\n>> Hello, Danny.\n\nThis is a surprise.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nYeah, how's every little thing?\n\n>> Just fine.\n\n>> That's good.\n\nWell, I'll see you later, huh?\n\n>> Have you been dancing lately?\n\n>> Yeah, I went last Saturday.\n\n>> Do you ever go hiking anymore?\n\n>> Once in a while.\n\n>> Do you remember the Sunday we hiked up Pioneer Canyon?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Didn't we have fun?\n\n>> Yeah, we had lots of fun.\n\n>> Well, Danny, will you give me a ring sometime?\n\n>> Sure, I'll give you a ring, and we'll get together real soon.\n\nWell, I'll see you later.\n\nI'll give you a ring soon.\n\n(horn honking) Taxi, lady?\n\n>> Where's your meter?\n\n>> I'll figure out the fare as we go along.\n\n>> You might overcharge me.\n\n>> I might at that.\n\nHop in, honey.\n\nWhere would you like to go?\n\n>> Let's go downtown, window shopping.\n\n>> How dull can you get?\n\n>> Well, that's what I want to do.\n\nWe can do something else later.\n\n>> You have a deal, honey.\n\n(engine sputtering) (engine rumbling) >> It's still here.\n\n>> Nice-looking coat.\n\nBet they'd suck you at least a thousand bucks for a coat like that.\n\n>> Are you kidding?\n\nWhy, that's mink.\n\nIt's a bargain at two thousand.\n\nIsn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life?\n\n>> Oh, it's not bad.\n\nAre you thinking on buying it?\n\n>> I want that coat, and I'm gonna get it.\n\n>> For two thousand dollars?\n\n>> For whatever it takes.\n\n>> Say, wait a minute.\n\nYou really do want it, don't you?\n\n>> You bet I do.\n\n(upbeat music) (patrons chattering) >> You're kidding.\n\nWait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n>> Huh?\n\n>> Ah, they're blue.\n\n>> Huh uh, brown.\n\n♪ Oh, but there's blues in your big brown eyes ♪ >> Oh, you sing too.\n\n>> Only for you, honey.\n\n>> Shall we go?\n\n>> Closed Mondays.\n\nHow do you like that?\n\n>> Are you sure you didn't happen to know it was closed when you invited me?\n\n>> Now wait a minute.\n\nWould I do a thing like that?\n\nNow I'll take you anyplace you want to go.\n\nName it, and you can have it.\n\n>> All right.\n\nAll right, I know a place where I'd like to go.\n\n>> Boys: Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!\n\n>> Hey, you, get out of here!\n\n>> Bang, bang, bang, bang!\n\n>> I'll catch you.\n\nYou silly brats, you hear me?\n\nI'll save you all the trouble of growing up.\n\nWhat's the matter?\n\nCut that out.\n\nYou want to break the machine?\n\n>> Hello, Nick.\n\n>> Oh, it's you.\n\n>> Gimme a nickel, Danny.\n\nI'll show you how to beat this game.\n\n>> Dan: Wait a minute.\n\n>> One ball.\n\nHey, Nick, pay me.\n\nI hit the jackpot.\n\n>> Here.\n\nThat's all for you.\n\n>> Hey, wait a minute.\n\nGo ahead, honey, play it as much as you want.\n\n>> Take it easy, Danny.\n\nI can handle Nick myself.\n\nI used to work here, didn't I, Nick?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nWould you come back, huh?\n\n>> It's still in the window, Nick.\n\nI saw it yesterday.\n\n>> Are you crazy?\n\nWhat do you think I am, a millionaire?\n\n>> What's going on here?\n\n>> Oh, let's skip it.\n\nCome on, we'll have our pictures taken.\n\nCome on.\n\nSee you later, Nick.\n\n>> Who goes first?\n\n>> We both go.\n\n>> What do you want?\n\n>> Gimme a half a buck's worth of nickels.\n\n>> Okay, Admiral.\n\nNow what do you want?\n\n>> There's only nine nickels there, buddy.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\nWho's cheating who?\n\n>> What?\n\n>> Look, you got your nickel, haven't you?\n\nHit the road.\n\n>> Why, hello, Nick.\n\n>> Look, I've got rules in this house.\n\nThat goes for you too.\n\nIf you want to pull that kind of stuff, go somewhere else.\n\nCome on, beat it.\n\nBeat it!\n\n>> Come on, Vera, let's get out of this crummy joint.\n\n>> Goodbye, Nick.\n\n(upbeat music) (surf crashing) See that big star right there?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> That's Betelgeuse.\n\n>> Who?\n\n>> Betelgeuse.\n\nBetelgeuse Dave used to call it.\n\n>> Dave?\n\nWho's Dave?\n\n>> Oh, a fella I used to know.\n\nHe taught me the names of all the stars.\n\nYou know, I never saw a star until I was 16?\n\n>> How come?\n\n>> I was raised in a steel town in West Virginia, and you couldn't see the sky for the smoke.\n\nSo I ran away.\n\n>> Funny, I ran away from home too.\n\nThat was a long, long time ago.\n\nWhat did you do after you ran away from home?\n\n>> Oh, I was a car hop for a while, waitress in a beer joint, clerk in a five and ten, cashier in a coffee shop.\n\nIt's not what you run away to.\n\nIt's what you run away from.\n\n>> I ran away from a farm and the belt the old man used to whip me with.\n\nThat old man sure was free with that belt.\n\n>> Oh, I ran away from a lot of things.\n\nMa getting drunk all the time and never having any decent clothes to wear.\n\nAnd the boarders, especially those boarders.\n\nThey wouldn't leave me alone.\n\n>> Must have been tough.\n\n>> I learned to handle them after a while.\n\n>> Think you can handle me?\n\n>> Sure.\n\nI can handle you easy.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\nHello, is Buzz there?\n\nHe what?\n\nTook a fishing party, huh?\n\nWhen will he be back?\n\nNo, no, nevermind, I'll... All right.\n\nI'll call him later.\n\nBye.\n\nThe bookkeeper.\n\nWhat's he doing here two days ahead of time?\n\nIf he finds out I'm short, he'll tell the old man.\n\nThe old man's mean enough to send a guy to jail just for laughs.\n\nI gotta get twenty bucks in a hurry.\n\nHow about that salary loan outfit?\n\nThe one that's always yackin' on the radio.\n\nWalk in with an honest face, walk out with a pocket full of dough.\n\nI must have walked in with the wrong face.\n\nA couple of days to check my references.\n\nI haven't got any references, and I haven't got a couple of days.\n\nCan I have it for a dollar down like it says in the window?\n\n>> As soon as we've checked up on your credit.\n\n>> Dan: Credit, oh.\n\nOh, I can't wait that long.\n\n>> Oh, wait a minute.\n\nYou got a charge account in town?\n\n>> No, I...\n\nYes.\n\nYes, I have at the Hub.\n\nAt the Hub where I buy my clothes.\n\n>> I tell you what I'll do.\n\nI'll call their credit manager, and if he says you're okay, you can take the watch right with you, okay?\n\nNow there, let's get it on and show you what it looks like.\n\n>> How much could you let me have on this ticker?\n\n>> $30 do you any good?\n\n>> $30 will be fine.\n\n>> Any better than last week?\n\n>> I don't know yet, Mr. Mackey.\n\nI'll let you know.\n\n>> Oh, about that other matter.\n\nSee if you can't find a way to make it a business deduction.\n\n>> I'll think about it, Mr. Mackey.\n\n>> Hi, George.\n\n>> Hi, Danny.\n\n>> You're here kind of early this week, aren't you?\n\n>> The old man sent for me.\n\nHe had some tax reports for me to get out.\n\n>> Oh.\n\n>> And I figured as long as I was here, I'd get my Thursday work done.\n\nSay, Dan, I just checked the register, and it's $20 short.\n\n>> Well, maybe you could have made a mistake or something.\n\n>> No, I checked it twice.\n\n>> Well, you know sometimes the money gets stuck in the money sack down there.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, here it is.\n\nSee?\n\n>> But I looked in the money sack.\n\n>> You just didn't look good enough.\n\nCan I do anything for you, sir?\n\n>> Are you Dan Brady?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> I'm Moriarity, California Investigation Service.\n\nYou bought a watch yesterday at Jay's Jewelers, didn't you?\n\n>> Yeah, I did.\n\n>> And took it straight to Uncle John's and hocked it?\n\n>> What if I did?\n\n>> Don't play dumb.\n\nWhy would you buy a watch for $100 dollars and hock it the same day for 30?\n\n>> Well, I-- >> Because you don't intend to pay the hundred, that's why.\n\n>> Now wait a minute, don't holler before you're hurt, pal.\n\nI signed up to pay that thing ten bucks a month.\n\nAnd when the month's up, I'll pay him the ten bucks.\n\n>> Oh no, you won't.\n\nBecause Jay Jewelers don't think you're gonna here when the month's up.\n\nThey think you're gonna skip town.\n\nSo you'll pay up now, or Jay's gonna swear out a warrant.\n\n>> A warrant?\n\nWarrant for what?\n\n>> I'll give it to you in words of one syllable, my friend.\n\nWhen you buy something on the installment plan, you sign what they call a conditional sales contract.\n\n>> Dan: Yeah?\n\n>> This contract says that the watch, the radio, or the easy chair don't belong to you until you make your last payment.\n\nIt says that if you sell, mortgage, or hock something you don't own yet, you're guilty of larceny.\n\nAnd a $100 dollar watch is grand larceny.\n\nThat's three years in the penitentiary in this state.\n\n>> Oh, you're kiddin' me, aren't you?\n\n>> Kiddin', me?\n\nNot on your life.\n\nYou signed a contract like this, didn't you?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Read what it says right there.\n\n>> Debt is payable-- >> Within 24 hours or charges will be brought.\n\n>> Look, I can't get a hold of a hundred bucks, I mean, just like that right away.\n\n>> Well, you better dig it up somewhere.\n\nBecause if you don't pay up by noon tomorrow, a little man's gonna call on you with a big warrant.\n\nThat's all, brother, until noon tomorrow.\n\n>> Hey, Chuck.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\n>> What does a guy do when he needs lots of dough?\n\n>> Me, I usually hock my watch.\n\n>> That's a great idea.\n\nMaybe I can get some dough on my jalopy.\n\nI wonder how much they'll give me for it.\n\nNah, no dice.\n\nWhat good is three hundred bucks?\n\nI still owe the finance company 350.\n\n(upbeat music) By half past eight, I'd tried everything I could think of, and I still hadn't raised $100 dollars.\n\nI hadn't raised a buck and a quarter.\n\nSo I threw in the towel and headed for Phil's Place to knock off a couple of beers.\n\nThe longer I sat on that silly stool, the more I felt like slugging somebody.\n\nI could've socked old man Mackey for being so tight, or the guy in the jewelry store for sending Moriarity after me, or the fellow standing next to me at the bar.\n\nBecause he had money in his pocket, and I didn't.\n\n>> How much do I owe you, Phil?\n\n>> 3.60, Shorty.\n\n>> Okay, I gotta get home before the old lady chops my ears off.\n\n>> Haven't you got something smaller?\n\nThis one's a 50.\n\n>> Oh, is it?\n\nWell, how's this one?\n\n>> That's another 50.\n\nHere, let me look.\n\nThere's a five right there on top.\n\n>> Oh, this one.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Just keep the change.\n\nI gotta get home before the old lady slaps me down.\n\nWho?\n\n>> Your wife.\n\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\nYeah, the old lady.\n\nGood night, Phil.\n\n>> So long,

dollar bills, and tonight it's fifties.\n\n>> I won at the crap game.\n\n>> Sure it wasn't bingo?\n\n>> Waiter: Two champagne cocktails.\n\n>> What do you mean bingo?\n\n>> Just thought you might have won it from Shorty McCabe.\n\n>> What gave you that idea?\n\n>> Maybe it was Evelyn.\n\n>> Evelyn?\n\nWho's Evelyn?\n\n>> Bookkeeper in the movie house.\n\nShe saw Shorty lose it in the auto park.\n\n>> What do you know about this?\n\n>> Oh, she just came into Nick's place to phone the cops.\n\n>> Cops?\n\nWhat'd she say?\n\n>> Vera, long time, no see.\n\nHow about a dance?\n\n>> No thanks.\n\n>> Your boyfriend won't mind.\n\n>> No thanks.\n\n>> Can I buy you both a drink?\n\n>> No.\n\n>> No.\n\n>> Isn't there anything I can do for you?\n\n>> Yeah, blow.\n\n>> You heard her.\n\nWhat did she say?\n\n>> Danny!\n\nShe said she saw the guy who did it with a handkerchief around his face.\n\nHe took Shorty for his bankroll.\n\nDidn't he?\n\n>> How do I know?\n\n>> Just thought you might have heard about it.\n\nAnyhow, if it was me and I'd won any $50 bills, I wouldn't go spending them around the pier.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\nWhy not?\n\n>> Because everyone around knows that Shorty carries fifties.\n\n>> Look, I don't know any guy named Shorty.\n\nAnd I won this dough in a crap game, see?\n\n>> Oh, now sure you did.\n\nSure you did, Danny.\n\nLet's dance a little, huh?\n\n>> That's more like it.\n\n>> Only we won't spend the fifties, will we?\n\n>> No.\n\nNo, we won't spend the fifties.\n\n40, 60, 80, 100.\n\nThere's $100 dollars.\n\nThere's your dough.\n\n>> And there's your contract.\n\nSo long, Brady.\n\n>> So long.\n\n(phone ringing) Mackey Motor.\n\nWho?\n\nThis is him speaking.\n\nHow would I like to what?\n\nHow would you like to take a big jump off the pier?\n\n>> No, I don't like to take a jump off the pier.\n\nBut you better come and see me or else.\n\n>> Or else what?\n\n>> Or else something is gonna happen to you.\n\nTo you, Danny boy.\n\n>> What's on your mind?\n\nAnd it better be good.\n\n>> Oh, it's very good.\n\nYou know, last night the prizefighter, big prizefighter, he left something here.\n\nI picked it up, picked it up where you left it.\n\nIt's got a knot in it.\n\nYou know, like you use for a mask or something.\n\n>> I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n>> No?\n\n>> No.\n\nBut I'll take it just for luck.\n\n>> Sure, sure, you keep my handkerchief.\n\nI keep your handkerchief.\n\nSame knot, only your handkerchief got blood on it.\n\n>> So what?\n\n>> Did you ever hear anybody say money talks?\n\n$50 bills, they talk very loud.\n\nBig bills.\n\nWhat do they say?\n\nSay Shorty McCabe, Shorty McCabe.\n\nYeah, that's what it says, Shorty McCabe.\n\n>> What's your angle?\n\nWhat are you trying to tell me?\n\n>> I'm telling you about a holdup.\n\nYou see, Evelyn from the picture show, she saw the man get robbed and she got a very good look at the guy who did it.\n\nShe thinks she can identify him very easy.\n\nNice girl.\n\nYou want me to call her?\n\n>> Wait a minute.\n\nPut it down.\n\nIf you're so sure that I was mixed up in this thing, why don't you call the cops?\n\n>> Cops?\n\nOh no, no.\n\nI'm a businessman.\n\nSee, Danny boy, I think I can do business with you very nice.\n\n>> What kind of business do you think you can do with me?\n\n>> Automobile business.\n\nYou get me a new car, and I don't know nothin'.\n\nJust nothin'.\n\n>> A new car?\n\nI couldn't get a new car if I wanted to.\n\n>> Oh, you can get a new car same way you got the $50 bill.\n\n>> Are you nuts?\n\n>> Nuts, me?\n\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n>> Davis.\n\n>> Chuck: Yes?\n\n>> Here are the plates for the green sedan.\n\nSee that it's ready for delivery in the morning.\n\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n>> Oh, and Davis, don't let me catch you putting in ten gallons of gas this time.\n\nSix is plenty.\n\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n>> Dan: There goes the last new car we'll have this month.\n\nI've got to get it tonight or blow town tomorrow.\n\nEven if I blow town, they'll probably catch up with me.\n\nOh boy, am I in a mess.\n\n>> Hey, Dan.\n\nDan, I was just thinking that if you're not gonna take Helen out anymore, I thought maybe I'd give her a call sometime.\n\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\nWhy don't you do that, Chuck?\n\n(dramatic music) (upbeat carnival music) Hey, fella, this thing is stuck back here.\n\n>> Let me see what it is.\n\n>> It's the green sedan on Second and California Street.\n\nIt's got license plates.\n\n>> That's fine.\n\nWell, I promised you I know nothing.\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n>> Wait.\n\n>> What's the matter?\n\n>> I want the handkerchief.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nYou let go of this and I-- >> All right.\n\nYou let go and I'll let go.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> What are you gonna do with the car?\n\n>> That's none of your business, Danny boy, but I'll tell you I sold it to a gambler friend of mine.\n\nHe's driving it home to Nevada.\n\n>> You see that he does.\n\nI don't want it around town here.\n\nIt's liable to get me in a jam.\n\n>> Don't worry, he's going home tonight.\n\n>> No slip-ups.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> Brady.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\n>> Now I know who took that green sedan.\n\n>> You do?\n\n>> Yeah, I could tell the police about it right this minute.\n\nBut I don't know whether that would help me get back the car or not, you understand?\n\n>> No, I don't.\n\n>> Now I'm not interested in sending anybody to jail, Brady.\n\nI'm interested in getting back that car.\n\n>> I don't know why you're telling me all this, Mr. Mackey.\n\n>> Oh, yes you do.\n\nAn employee of this firm stole that sedan, and I happen to know who it is because he was seen.\n\n>> If you're trying to pin this thing on me, Mr. Mackey-- >> Now don't try to run any bluffs, Brady.\n\n>> How many times do I have to tell you?\n\n>> You don't have to tell me anything.\n\nAll you have to do is to get that car down here parked out in front before I get down tomorrow.\n\n>> What if I haven't got it?\n\nWhat if I don't know where it is?\n\n>> But you did have it, and you do know where it is.\n\n>> Well, I don't anymore!\n\n>> If you can't return the car, you'll have to pay for it.\n\n$3,000.\n\n>> $3,000?\n\nWhy, it only lists for 1,950.\n\n>> You don't think I'd sell to you at list?\n\n>> $3,000, where would a guy like me get any dough like that?\n\n>> Oh, most everybody's got a family someplace.\n\nWhy, folks would go to a lot of trouble to keep a man out of jail.\n\n>> Not mine.\n\n>> Now look, I'll give you 24 hours, Brady.\n\nI want the money or I want the automobile.\n\nNow let me give you some warning.\n\nDon't you try to leave town.\n\n>> $3,000.\n\nIt might as well been three million.\n\nI tried to remember who could have seen me in the green sedan.\n\nNobody had known I had it except Nick.\n\nNick!\n\nMaybe that was who told the old man.\n\nNick hated me.\n\nHe'd cut my throat for a nickel.\n\n>> Hey, what's the matter with you tonight?\n\nYou look like you lost your last friend.\n\n>> How would you like to go to Texas, honey, right now, right away?\n\n>> Are you kiddin'?\n\n>> I'm on the level.\n\n>> Oh, what's the matter with California?\n\nWeather getting too warm?\n\n(dishes clattering) >> I'll tell you about it later.\n\nSo I'm in a worse jam than ever.\n\nMy boss is gonna throw me in the brig if I don't get three thousand bucks or else.\n\nWhere am I gonna get a hold of three thousand bucks?\n\n>> I know where there's three or four thousand dollars.\n\n>> Yeah, the First National Bank.\n\n>> No, not in any bank.\n\nWhere we can get at it.\n\nWhere we can get at it easy.\n\nAll you have to do is to break a little catch lock on a rickety old door.\n\nYou could pry it open with your fingernails.\n\n>> Not with my fingernails.\n\nI'm in too deep already.\n\n>> This is the end of the month.\n\nThat's where Nick keeps the money overnight.\n\n>> Nick.\n\nYou mean Nick at the penny arcade?\n\n>> Uh huh.\n\nThere'll be thousands of dollars there tonight.\n\n>> What would Nick be doing with that kind of dough?\n\n>> He charges people for cashing checks.\n\nToday's a big payday.\n\nA lot of them will bring their checks in in the morning before the banks open, and he doesn't even have a safe.\n\nHe hides it.\n\nI know where.\n\n>> It was Nick who got me into all this.\n\n>> Let Nick get you out.\n\nThen you won't have to go to Texas.\n\nYou can stay here with me.\n\n>> Wait a minute.\n\n>> What's the matter?\n\n>> There's someone watching us from the house.\n\n>> It's only old snoop.\n\n>> Who?\n\n>> The landlady.\n\nShe's always looking for trouble.\n\nYou know, I had a news program on the air the other night, and she busted in to try to tell me I had a man in my room.\n\n>> She's still watching.\n\n>> Well, let's give her something to watch.\n\nI'll stay out here and look out for the watchman.\n\nIf I see him coming, I'll honk the horn.\n\n>> Blow it three times so I'll know it's you.\n\n>> All right, Dan.\n\nGood luck.\n\n(upbeat carnival music) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) (glass shattering) >> Stop or I'll shoot!\n\n(gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (engine sputtering) >> Move over, will you?\n\n>> Let's get out of here quick.\n\n(police whistling) Did you get the money?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> I heard shooting.\n\nWhat happened?\n\n>> The night watchman saw me.\n\n>> You took a big chance tonight, and you got away with it.\n\nYou ought to be tickled to death.\n\n>> Well, I'm not.\n\nI feel like I'm being shoved into a corner And if I don't get out soon, it'll be too late.\n\nMaybe it's too late already.\n\n>> Well, you can stop worrying.\n\nYou're out right now.\n\nYou've got money in your pocket to pay your way out.\n\n>> Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\nI've got the money.\n\nThat'll square everything, all right.\n\n>> I wonder how much there is.\n\n>> It feels like a lot.\n\n>> Let's take it up to my room and count it.\n\n>> All right.\n\n>> Pull down those shades.\n\n500 in each of these packages.\n\nTwo, three, four, five, six, seven!\n\nWhy, that's $3,500.\n\n20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110.\n\n$3,610.\n\n>> Yeah, it's a lot of dough.\n\n>> Why, that's more money than I could make in a year working every day.\n\n(someone knocking) >> It's the coppers.\n\n>> Just like I thought.\n\n>> What's the big idea?\n\nWho said you can come in?\n\n>> I have rules in this house.\n\nThis is a clean, respectable place.\n\n>> Well, you got no right in here.\n\nNow get out!\n\n>> I don't allow no men in the rooms.\n\nNot in my house.\n\nAnd I'm not leaving until he goes.\n\n>> You're leaving right now.\n\n>> Maybe you'd rather I call the cops?\n\n>> Why, you old battle ax!\n\n>> Cut it out, will you?\n\nWe don't want any trouble, especially now.\n\n>> Yeah, but-- >> Maybe I ought to go.\n\nYou think you can take care of everything all right?\n\n>> Oh yeah, sure, Danny.\n\nDon't worry.\n\nI can take care of everything.\n\n>> I'll call you in the morning.\n\n>> I don't want any of your kind around here.\n\nWhen your rent's up, you can move out.\n\n>> Scram!\n\n>> Hello, is Vera Novak there?\n\n>> Hey, you're gonna wear that thing out today.\n\n>> Oh, this is her-- >> Why don't you forget about her?\n\n>> Wait a minute, please.\n\n>> She's just another dame.\n\n>> Will you do me a favor and shut up, please?\n\n>> Sorry.\n\n>> Oh, this is her day off.\n\nShe wouldn't be at the restaurant.\n\nLook, when she comes in, would you tell her to call Dan Brady at Mackey Motor?\n\nIt's very important.\n\nSoon as she comes in.\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\n>> Well, Brady?\n\n>> Well?\n\n>> I didn't see that green sedan when I came down this morning.\n\n>> No, you didn't, did you?\n\n>> Does that mean you can't get it back?\n\n>> It can mean anything you want it to mean.\n\n>> Well, then I assume you intend to pay for the car instead.\n\n>> Oh, do you?\n\n>> How long will it take you to get the money?\n\n>> I've got it already.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Fine, why don't you come right in the office?\n\n>> Well, I haven't got it on me.\n\nI have to pick it up tonight after work.\n\nI can bring it in the morning.\n\n>> Why wait till tomorrow?\n\nI'll come back after dinner tonight.\n\nYou can see me in the office then.\n\n>> It might be 10 o'clock or so.\n\n>> That's all right, Brady.\n\nThat's perfectly all right.\n\nSee you tonight.\n\n(phone ringing) >> Mackey Motor.\n\nHello, Vera.\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nDid you take care of everything all right?\n\nGood.\n\nOh, that's swell, baby.\n\nLook, I'll be over and see you tonight soon as I get off work right after six o'clock.\n\nGoodbye.\n\n(Dan knocking) >> Vera: Is that you, Danny?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Come right in.\n\nIsn't it beautiful, Danny?\n\nOh, Danny, Danny.\n\nI might never have had it if it hadn't been for you.\n\n>> Dan: Where did you get the coat?\n\n>> I bought it.\n\n>> Dan: Bought it with what?\n\n>> With my share of the money.\n\nHere's your end, $1,800.\n\n>> You took half the dough and bought a coat with it?\n\n>> Not just a coat, Danny.\n\nA mink coat.\n\n>> You sold me out.\n\n>> Oh now just a minute.\n\nWho told you where the money was?\n\nWho told you how to get it?\n\nIsn't that worth half?\n\n>> I can't use half.\n\nI need 3,000.\n\n>> Oh, don't be a chump.\n\nNobody expects to get everything they ask for.\n\nMake him an offer.\n\nThat's what I did.\n\n>> What you did?\n\n>> Sure.\n\nThis coat cost $2,000.\n\nI told the furrier 1,800 was all I had, and he could take it or leave it.\n\nHe took it.\n\nOffer this to the old man.\n\nTell him it's all you could raise.\n\nI bet anything he takes it.\n\n(dramatic music) >> Well, Brady, I'm glad you're doing the sensible thing.\n\nThere's only 1,800 here.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> Mackey: Where's the rest of it?\n\n>> I couldn't dig it up.\n\nTake it or leave it.\n\n>> I'll take it.\n\n(phone ringing) >> Operator: Operator.\n\n>> Mackey: Get me the police station.\n\n>> What's the idea?\n\n>> I told you I'd forget about the whole thing for $3,000, but not for 1,800.\n\nNow if you've got the rest of it on you, you'd better pay me now before it's too late.\n\n>> Why you... (dramatic music) >> You can't get away with it!\n\n(Mackey choking) >> You need your cash?\n\nDirty, rotten, good for nothin'... (tires screeching) >> Chuck: Dan.\n\nHey, Danny boy.\n\n>> Hi, Chuck.\n\nHi, Helen.\n\n>> Hey, Danny, I missed you at quitting time tonight.\n\nI want to say goodbye.\n\n>> Goodbye?\n\n>> Yeah, I quit today.\n\nI'm through with that screwball Mackey.\n\nI told you what he tried to pull on me, didn't I?\n\n>> No.\n\nNo, you didn't.\n\n>> Well, you remember the night the sedan disappeared?\n\nWell, the next morning, he called me in his office and tried to tell me I swiped it.\n\n>> He said what?\n\n>> Like I'm telling you, he said I stole the car.\n\nGave me a lot of hooey about somebody seeing me drive away.\n\n>> Wait a minute.\n\nI'm all mixed up.\n\nLet me get this thing straight.\n\nHe said that he saw you drive that car away?\n\n>> And that ain't all.\n\nYesterday, he called me in his office, and he had the screwy idea I should get three thousand bucks from my old man to pay for the sedan.\n\nNow how nuts can a guy get?\n\n>> He didn't know anything at all.\n\nHe was just fishing around, putting the pressure on everybody, hoping something would turn up.\n\n>> Yeah, I should have let him have one talking to me like that.\n\nSome of these days, that old man is gonna get his neck in a sling.\n\n>> Neck in a sling?\n\n(laughs) Yeah.\n\nYeah, he had it coming, though, didn't he?\n\nAlways trying to outsmart everybody, but he got too smart.\n\nYeah, he got so smart, he got his neck in a sling.\n\n(laughs) >> Danny, Danny, what is it?\n\nWhat's the matter?\n\n>> I have a date here.\n\nI'm late already.\n\n(Dan knocking) >> Come in.\n\nWell, how did it go?\n\nDid he take the money?\n\n>> Yeah, yeah, he took it.\n\n>> I told you he would.\n\n>> Pack your things.\n\nWe gotta get out of here.\n\n>> What are you talking about?\n\n>> He tried to call the cops.\n\nI had to stop him.\n\n>> Stop him?\n\nHow?\n\n>> Nevermind.\n\nPack your things.\n\n>> Stop clowning, Danny.\n\nHow?\n\n>> I'm not clowning.\n\nHe tried to call the cops.\n\nI had to take the phone away from him.\n\nHe pulled a gun on me.\n\nI strangled him.\n\n>> On the level?\n\n>> On the level.\n\nLook, they won't find him until the morning.\n\nBy that time, we'll be halfway to Texas, baby.\n\n>> You'll be halfway to Texas, not me.\n\n>> But the cops will be after us.\n\n>> They won't be after me.\n\nI don't have to run away.\n\n>> Look, we're in this thing together.\n\nYou told me to offer him the dough.\n\n>> I didn't tell you to kill him, and I wasn't there when it happened.\n\nSo why should I stick my neck out now?\n\n>> What kind of a dame are you?\n\n>> The kind that watches out for herself.\n\nIf I didn't, who would?\n\n>> You don't care about anybody else, do you?\n\n>> Why, sure I do.\n\nWhy, I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you, Danny.\n\nI certainly wouldn't want to see the cops catch you.\n\nDon't you think you better get started to Texas?\n\nI'll kiss you goodbye if you want me to.\n\n>> I wouldn't dirty my lips.\n\n>> One more flight.\n\n(landlady knocking) Miss Novak, some gentlemen to see you.\n\n>> Officer: You Vera Novak?\n\n>> So what if I am?\n\n>> I've got something for you.\n\n>> Yeah?\n\nWhat is it?\n\n>> A search warrant.\n\nSee what she's got in her purse, Smitty.\n\n>> Smitty: Right.\n\n>> Vera: You won't find him in there.\n\n>> We won't find who in there?\n\n>> You know who, Dan Brady.\n\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\nDan Brady.\n\nWhere will I find him?\n\n>> He's getting out of the state as fast as he can drive.\n\n>> Officer: Why aren't you getting out too?\n\n>> Vera: I didn't have any part of it.\n\nI didn't even know him.\n\n>> Didn't know who?\n\n>> Say, you trying to make me look like a fool?\n\nMackey, of course.\n\n>> Mackey.\n\nWhich Mackey is that?\n\n>> Oh, the one that ran the automobile agency.\n\n>> Ran?\n\n>> Well, he can't keep on running it now that he's dead, can he?\n\n>> Dead?\n\nWho's dead?\n\n>> Mackey, of course.\n\nBrady killed him.\n\nThe girl didn't have any part of it.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\n>> You know where.\n\nAt the auto... Say, are you trying to kid me?\n\n>> Sure.\n\nMaybe it's the other way around.\n\nMaybe you're trying to kid me.\n\nWhy did you start spilling the minute I came in the door?\n\nMaybe it's because you wanted me to think your boyfriend had gone when he hadn't.\n\nHow do I know he isn't still here?\n\n>> Why don't you look under the couch?\n\n>> I don't suppose he'd be that near.\n\n(Vera laughs) No, I didn't think he'd be that close.\n\nSmitty, watch it.\n\n>> Vera: Ha ha ha.\n\n>> Ha ha ha.\n\nWhere does a dame like you get a coat like this?\n\n>> I bought that coat with my own money.\n\nYou take your dirty hands off it.\n\n>> I'll bet you did.\n\n>> I can prove it.\n\nI got a receipt.\n\nHere.\n\nHere.\n\n>> Alaska Furriers, 917 Main Street.\n\nReceived of Vera Novak, $1,800.\n\nWell, looks like Nick had the right hunch, Smit.\n\n>> Nick?\n\n>> What do you suppose brought us here?\n\nLast night, somebody stole $3,600 of Nick's money, and today you paid $1,800 for a fur coat.\n\nLooks like you and your boyfriend split Nick's bankroll right down the middle.\n\n>> I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nGive me back my coat.\n\n>> Don't worry about your coat, sister.\n\nWe'll take it right with us.\n\nBring her along, Smitty.\n\nWe'll check on Mackey on the way down to the station.\n\n>> Serves you right, you hussy.\n\n>> Drop dead.\n\n(dramatic music) >> What are you doing here?\n\n>> I could see you were in trouble, so I got rid of Chuck and came back.\n\n>> You get yourself right back home.\n\nI gotta get out of here quick.\n\n>> What is it, Danny?\n\nWas it the holdup in the auto park?\n\n>> What do you know about that holdup?\n\n>> I saw you hiding in the alley that night, the night that Millie and I walked by.\n\nI couldn't see your features, but I knew that it was you.\n\nBut then I thought maybe I was imagining things.\n\nYou know how it is when you love someone.\n\nYou think you see them 50 times a day.\n\nBut a minute later, you called my name and I turned around, and there you were at the head of the alley.\n\nThen we heard about the holdup in the auto park, and I saw the look on your face.\n\n>> Is that all?\n\n>> That's all.\n\n>> Well, why don't you get out and let me get started?\n\n>> I saw the police come out of the house with her.\n\nAre they after you too?\n\n>> What if they are?\n\nWhat business is it of yours?\n\n>> But I can help you.\n\nI can tell them you were with me all evening, and you'll have an alibi.\n\n>> I don't get it.\n\nWhy do you want to help me?\n\nWhen things were going my way, all I ever gave you was the runaround.\n\nNow that I'm in a jam, why don't you get smart and stay away from me?\n\n>> I've been away from you too long, and it isn't any good.\n\nDon't you think I know I'm dumb to throw myself at a guy that doesn't want me?\n\nDon't you think I know I'm a fool to stand on a street corner for an hour just waiting for you to come out of a door?\n\nI know all that, but I can't help it.\n\nI fell in love with you the first time I saw you, Dan.\n\n>> I'll drive you home.\n\nIt's less than a week since Helen waited for me outside the garage.\n\n\"Have you been dancing lately?\n\n\", she said.\n\nAnd all I had to do was say, \"Swell idea, let's go out tonight.\"\n\nIf I'd have said that, I wouldn't be running away from the cops tonight with a murder hanging over my head.\n\n(siren blaring) >> Helen: No, Dan, no.\n\n>> Hey, buddy, pull over to the curb.\n\nLet's take a look at your driver's license.\n\nBrady, that your name?\n\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n>> You went through a boulevard stop back there.\n\nWill you sign this?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> And take it easy.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nHelen, you kept me from making an awful mistake.\n\n>> If you'll only take me with you, I can help you.\n\nI know I can.\n\n>> Let me lay it on the line.\n\nI'm gonna have to keep running.\n\nI'm gonna have to keep running all my life.\n\nBecause when they catch up with me, they're gonna hang me.\n\n>> Hang you?\n\n>> For murder.\n\nI killed a man tonight.\n\n>> Start the car and then tell me how it happened.\n\n>> Dan: Telling her about it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.\n\nIt was Helen who came up with the idea of Mexico.\n\nWe decided to head for an inland town like Hermosillo where not many tourists come.\n\nA man could be safe for 50 years in a place like that.\n\n(car knocking) >> What's that?\n\n>> That's goodbye to Mexico.\n\nOh, it's the main bearing.\n\nIt'll take a couple of days to fix.\n\n>> Well, then we'll have to hitchhike.\n\n>> And get there by morning?\n\nWe'd never make it.\n\n>> We have to make it.\n\n>> Oh, Helen, I've had the right girl all the time and was too dumb to know about it.\n\nIf we ever get out of this thing-- >> We're gonna get out of it.\n\n>> Yeah, but how?\n\nI've got an idea.\n\nNow this is the baby that's gonna get us there.\n\n>> And what are you gonna do with that?\n\n>> Get us a lift, honey, a lift straight through to Mexico.\n\nCome on.\n\nCareful.\n\nGet in quick.\n\nDon't try any funny stuff.\n\nI don't want to hurt you.\n\nAll right, when the signal changes, get going.\n\nTurn south on the highway, keep her under 50, and don't go through any red lights, you understand me?\n\n>> May I ask where we're going?\n\n>> Just keep driving.\n\nYou'll find out.\n\n>> I suppose you know what you're getting into.\n\nThis isn't a car theft.\n\nIt's kidnapping.\n\n>> No one asked you.\n\nI don't want your advice, you hear me?\n\n>> Well, I happen to be a lawyer.\n\nMaybe-- >> Maybe you can keep your mouth shut too.\n\n>> Helen: No, Dan, let him talk.\n\nHe might be able to help us.\n\n>> She's right.\n\nWhatever it is that you're running away from, this is worse.\n\nKidnapping is a capital offense.\n\nThey can hang you for it.\n\n>> What's the difference?\n\nThey're gonna hang me anyway.\n\nI just killed a man.\n\n>> How about the girl?\n\n>> You leave her out of it.\n\nShe had nothing to do with it.\n\nDo you understand me?\n\n>> I believe that, but will the police?\n\nLook, son, I can see this girl means something to you.\n\nWhy don't you tell me what happened for her sake?\n\nShe'd need a lawyer sooner or later.\n\n>> Maybe you're right.\n\nIf you're sure you can keep her in the clear.\n\n>> If she's innocent, you tell me the whole story, and it's the truth.\n\n>> The truth.\n\nI don't know where to begin.\n\n>> Start at the beginning.\n\n>> Dan: The guy was a lawyer, and maybe he could help Helen.\n\nSo I told him the whole story.\n\nI told him about sticking up Shorty in the auto park and about breaking into the penny arcade in the middle of the night I told him about Vera and Nick and old man Mackey.\n\nI told him everything that had happened from the very beginning to the end.\n\n>> I see.\n\nNow the first thing you want to know is where the girl stands.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> She's in the clear.\n\nThey can't touch her.\n\n>> Oh, but how about Dan?\n\nYou said maybe it wouldn't be murder.\n\nIt might be manslaughter.\n\n>> No, it's murder all right.\n\nI might be able to get him off with second degree.\n\nThey'd have a hard time proving premeditation.\n\n>> Second degree.\n\nThat would mean life, wouldn't it?\n\n>> It could.\n\n>> I'd rather they hung me.\n\n>> There's one discrepancy in your story.\n\nIt's worth checking up on because if we get the right answer, murder's out.\n\nManslaughter too.\n\n>> What do you mean?\n\n>> How do you know he's dead?\n\n>> He's dead, that's all.\n\nHis head fell over on the desk like he was dead.\n\n>> It would do that if he were unconscious.\n\nDid you feel his pulse or listen for a heartbeat?\n\n>> No, I didn't.\n\n>> Men don't die easily.\n\nThey take a lot of killing.\n\nI can imagine Mackey sitting in a police station right now telling the desk man what a narrow escape he had.\n\n>> If he only was alive.\n\nHelen, if he only was alive, I'd give myself up to the first cop that came along.\n\n>> Here's an all-night restaurant.\n\nWhy don't I use their phone and find out how Mackey is?\n\n>> Why don't you keep on driving too?\n\nI tell you how Mackey is.\n\nHe's dead, that's what.\n\nHe's dead.\n\n>> Oh but, Dan, maybe he isn't.\n\n>> He is.\n\nI know he is.\n\nListen, you, I didn't want to kill anybody.\n\nI don't want to kill you now.\n\nBut if you try any more funny stuff, I'll blow a hole right through you.\n\nWhat day is this, Helen?\n\n>> It's Saturday.\n\n>> No it isn't.\n\nIt's Sunday morning.\n\nWe still have a couple of hours before daylight.\n\nWe can still make it.\n\nTurn this car around.\n\n(dramatic music) >> Where are we going now?\n\n>> Remember Buzz Larson?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> He's taking a fishing party way down past San Diego this morning.\n\nIf we can get to the pier in time, I can go with him.\n\n>> To Mexico?\n\n>> Way past the Mexican border.\n\nStep on it, will you?\n\nHope the boat is still here.\n\nYeah, yeah, there it is down there.\n\nWe made it.\n\n>> Helen: We'd better hurry.\n\n>> I'd better hurry, not you.\n\n>> Oh, I'm going with you, Dan.\n\n>> There's no harbor below San Diego.\n\nI'll have to swim in from the sea.\n\n>> I'm going with you, Dan.\n\n>> You've taken too many chances already.\n\nI've got to go on by myself from here on.\n\nI'll send for you as soon as I get a job.\n\nYou know that, don't you, baby?\n\n>> Yes, but oh, Dan, don't go.\n\nI'm so afraid.\n\n>> There's nothing to be afraid of.\n\nHey, wait a minute.\n\nMaybe there is.\n\nHow are we gonna keep this guy from going to the cops till after the boat pulls out of the harbor?\n\n>> I'll keep him away.\n\nGive me the gun.\n\n>> Driver: I wouldn't do that if I were you.\n\n>> Why not?\n\n>> I told you the girl was in the clear.\n\nShe won't be if she takes that gun.\n\nAfter that, she'd be an accessory.\n\n>> Oh, don't listen to him, Dan.\n\nYou've got to get away from here.\n\n>> No, he's right.\n\nYou've got to be kept out of this.\n\nThat's all that's important now.\n\n>> Driver: Would you take my word for something?\n\n>> I might.\n\n>> As a citizen, I have to notify the police.\n\nBut as a friend, I don't have to hurry.\n\n>> Thanks.\n\nWould you do me another favor?\n\n>> If I can.\n\n>> Don't wait until the boat pulls out of the harbor.\n\nLeave now.\n\n>> I'll get her out of here right away.\n\n>> Dan: Thanks.\n\n>> Brady since noon Monday.\n\n>> No, I haven't.\n\n>> And you haven't heard from him either?\n\n>> Nope.\n\nWait a minute, I just remembered.\n\nHe phoned me Monday afternoon.\n\n>> For any particular reason?\n\n>> Yeah, I owed him 20 bucks.\n\nHe said he needed it.\n\n>> There's a news broadcast at six o'clock I want to hear before I talk to the authorities.\n\n>> Reporter: Regarding every airport, every bus depot, and every railroad station in a determined effort to prevent the killer's escape.\n\nAt four o'clock this morning, officers threw roadblocks across both state highways and are now stopping all outbound cars, but at last report, McDonald was still at large.\n\n>> McDonald?\n\n>> Reporter: Meanwhile, police officers Huxton and Chandler are dead and Deputy Sheriff Alan P. Janus was taken to the emergency hospital with two bullets in his thigh.\n\n>> I'll get it a little louder.\n\n>> Reporter: Closer to home, Beach City authorities are seeking garage mechanic Daniel Brady, 26, an employee of the Mackey Motor Company.\n\nLate yesterday evening, watchman Michael J. O'Brien, while making his regular nightly rounds, discovered the unconscious body of Oren Mackey, president of the automobile agency, lying in his office.\n\nMackey regained consciousness at St. Mark's Hospital shortly after midnight and named Brady as his assailant.\n\n>> Then he's alive.\n\n>> Tom, you want to watch yourself if we run into that kid.\n\nHe's dangerous.\n\n>> What's dangerous about him?\n\n>> He's got Mackey's gun.\n\n(dramatic music) >> Officer: You there, stop!\n\nHey, it's Brady.\n\n>> Where did he go?\n\n>> Buzz, wait a minute!\n\nWait a minute!\n\n(gunshot banging) >> Watch yourself.\n\nHe's shooting.\n\n>> I'll go after him.\n\nYou stay on top.\n\n(gunshot banging) >> I heard shooting.\n\n>> Did you see him?\n\n>> No, he didn't come through here.\n\n>> Look, what's that?\n\n>> I'm coming, Dan!\n\nHe's all right!\n\nYou didn't kill him, Dan!\n\n(gunshots banging) (Helen screams) >> Hey, what's going on?\n\n>> What happened?\n\n>> Cops.\n\n>> I heard about it on the radio.\n\n>> Heard about who?\n\nWho?\n\n>> Oh, the guy that killed a couple of cops.\n\n>> What's going on now?\n\n>> I don't know.\n\nThey shot somebody.\n\n(crowd chattering) >> Break it up.\n\nStand back, folks, give him room.\n\n>> There's the guy that got shot right there.\n\n>> Now where'd you say your automobile was?\n\n>> On the pier right over there.\n\n>> Fine, we'll put him in the car, and I'll drive him straight to the hospital if that's all right with you.\n\n>> Certainly.\n\n>> Save a bunch of time instead of waiting for the ambulance.\n\nI wouldn't have shot you, only I thought you had a gun.\n\nWhat'd you do with it?\n\n>> I dropped it.\n\nWhat do you think they're gonna give me?\n\n>> Have you ever been in trouble before?\n\n>> No, no, never.\n\n>> Well, I think we can rule out the watch and the $20 bill.\n\nThey'll probably charge you with the holdup, stealing the car, and breaking into the penny arcade.\n\nThat could add up to anything from one to 10 years.\n\nBut since you're a first offender, my guess is that it will be nearer one than 10.\n\n>> Whatever it is, I'll take it.\n\n>> Whatever it is, I'll be waiting for you, Dan.\n\nIf you want me to.\n\n>> You're a great gal, Helen.\n\n>> I love you, Dan.\n\n>> That goes both ways.\n\n(siren blaring) (dramatic music)"
