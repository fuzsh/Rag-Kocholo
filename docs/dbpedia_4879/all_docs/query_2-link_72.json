Needing money for a date, Rooney borrows $20 from the cash register, starting a chain of events that includes car theft, burglary, and possibly murder. (Yes, that is Jack Elam in the bar scene.) Read more at the IMDB. (The video is interlaced in both the MPEG2 file and the Cinepack. If viewing with VLC, deinterlace with menu-path Video/Deinterlace/Blend.)"
