        "text": "David Bowie Mini BIO\n\n8 January 1947 - 10 January 2016 from Brixton, London, England, UK\n\nBirth Name - David Robert Haywood Jones\n\nNicknames - The Thin White Duke - Ziggy Stardust\n\nHeight - 1.78 m (5' 10\")\n\nDavid Bowie is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers of pop music. Born David Jones, he changed his name to Bowie in the 1960s, to avoid confusion with the then well-known Davy Jones (lead singer of The Monkees).\n\nThe 1960s were not a happy period for Bowie, who remained a struggling artist, awaiting his breakthrough. He dabbled in many different styles of music (without commercial success), and other art forms such as acting, mime, painting, and playwriting. He finally achieved his commercial breakthrough in 1969 with the song \"Space Oddity,\" which was released at the time of the moon landing. Despite the fact that the literal meaning of the lyrics relates to an astronaut who is lost in space, this song was used by the BBC in their coverage of the moon landing, and this helped it become such a success. The album, which followed \"Space Oddity,\" and the two, which followed (one of which included the song \"The Man Who Sold The World,\" covered by Lulu and Nirvana) failed to produce another hit single, and Bowie's career appeared to be in decline. However, he made the first of many successful \"comebacks\" in 1972 with \"Ziggy Stardust,\" a concept album about a space-age rock star. This album was followed by others in a similar vein, rock albums built around a central character and concerned with futuristic themes of Armageddon, gender dysfunction/confusion, as well as more contemporary themes such as the destructiveness of success and fame, and the dangers inherent in star worship.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Bowie was a heavy cocaine abuser and sometime heroin user. In 1975, he changed tack. Musically, he released \"Young Americans,\" a soul (or plastic soul as he later referred to it) album. This produced his first number one hit in the US, \"Fame.\" He also appeared in his first major film, The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). With his different-colored eyes and skeletal frame, he certainly looked the part of an alien. The following year, he released \"Station to Station,\" containing some of the material he had written for the soundtrack to this film (which was not used). As his drug problem heightened, his behavior became more erratic. Reports of his insanity started to appear, and he continued to waste away physically. He fled back to Europe, finally settling in Berlin, where he changed musical direction again and recorded three of the most influential albums of all time, an electronic trilogy with Brian Eno \"Low, Heroes and Lodger.\" Towards the end of the 1970s, he finally kicked his drug habit, and recorded the album many of his fans consider his best, the Japanese-influenced \"Scary Monsters.\" Around this time, he played the Elephant Man on Broadway, to considerable acclaim.\n\nIn 1992, Bowie again changed direction and re-launched his solo career with \"Black Tie White Noise,\" a \"wedding\" album inspired by his recent marriage to Iman. To date, the 1990s have been kinder to Bowie than the late 1980s. He has released three albums to considerable critical acclaim and reasonable commercial success. In 1995, he renewed his working relationship with Brian Eno to record \"Outside.\" After an initial hostile reaction from the critics, this album has now taken its place with his classic albums.\n\nIn 2003, Bowie released an album entitled 'Reality.' The Reality Tour began in November 2003 and, after great commercial success, was extended into July 2004. In June 2004, Bowie suffered a heart attack and the tour did not finish it's scheduled run.\n\nAfter recovering, bowie did not release any new music, but did a little acting. In 2006, he played Tesla in The Prestige (2006) and had a small cameo in the series Extras (2005). In 2007, he did a cartoon voice in SpongeBob SquarePants (1999) playing Lord Royal Highness. He has not appeared in anything since 2008; however, after a ten year hiatus from recording, he released a new album called 'The Next Day.'\n\nBowie has influenced the course of popular music several times and influenced several generations of musicians. His promotional videos in the 1970s and 80s are regarded as ground-breaking, and as a live concert act, he is regarded as the most theatrical of them all.\n\nDavid achieved critically acclaimed recognition of his art and music right up to and since his passing. With his final album Blackstar he left so many questions unanswered and shall always continue to influence generations to come. Thank you David.\n\nVarious Bowie Trivia\n\nHis eyes are both blue. However, one pupil is permanently dilated due to a fight, and as a result, one eye looks darker than the other.\n\nIn 1968 while he was still a struggling artist, Bowie wrote some English lyrics to a French song titled \"Comme d'Habitude\" (\"As Usual\"). His version, \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", never did get recorded, and was rejected purely on the title and quite rightly so as far as David is concerned. But when the French melody caught the attention of Paul Anka, he reworked the lyrics and the song became \"My Way\". Of course, when Frank Sinatra recorded \"My Way\" his way, it turned to gold.\n\nHas one son in 1971 with his then-wife Angie Bowie, originally named Zowie - who later changed it to Joe and who is now known as Duncan Jones.\n\n(August 15, 2000) Daughter, with Iman, Alexandria Zahra Jones born.\n\nIn a magazine interview, he stated that he met his first wife when they were dating the same man.\n\nHas family roots in West Wales.\n\nIn his composition \"Slip Away\", on his album \"Heathen\", he makes cryptic references to The Uncle Floyd Show (1974), a program popular in the late 1970s and 1980s in the New York City area.

In 1999, Reuters placed his net worth at roughly $917 million. In 2003, the Sunday Express claimed his net worth was still in the $900 million (Â£510 million) range but that this placed him second to Paul McCartney.
