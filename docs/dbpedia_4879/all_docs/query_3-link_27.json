        "text": "Starting Friday, Port Huron will be one of 10 cities premiering a new Michigan-made film.\n\nTraverse City-based director JohnPaul Morris is officially releasing his new film \"Quicksand.\" The official release date is Sept. 19, but the movie will be premiering early in select cities including Port Huron. In his director's statement, Morris said he is happy that his first screenplay was a comedy. He said it's taken four years to make, but he and his crew have been laughing the entire time.\n\n\"There's a special terror that comes when you hear a joke 400 times in the editing room, and then get to hear it in the theater for the first time,\" Morris said in a statement. \"Hearing audiences respond to this film, this giant inside joke, has been incredible.\"\n\n\"Quicksand\" will premiere Friday at Sperry's MovieHouse and will continue to play until Sept. 14. The movie will play multiple times a day. Tickets and movie times can be found at www.sperrysmoviehouse.com.\n\nIn addition to Port Huron, \"Quicksand\" will premiere early at theaters in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Holland, Marquette, Escanaba, Iron Mountain, Manistee, Sault Ste. Marie and Frankfort.\n\nThe film has a distribution deal through Gravitas Ventures, which secured its official release date and premiere dates.\n\n\"Quicksand\" follows best friends Ray and Paul, who are co-best men in their friend's wedding. When they lose the ring just days before the ceremony, the two embark on a road trip to get it back that accelerates into an exploration of life, love and how not to die.\n\nIn a statement, Morris called the film a survival guide for your 20's, not only because the plot plays specifically off of friendships and fears from that period of his life, but because he thinks he needed one back then.\n\n\"I started writing the script when I was 26 and we finished production about a month before I turned 30, so it wasn't just a reflection on my 20s but a culmination of them,\" he said.\n\n\"Quicksand\" was primarily filmed in Traverse City, Grand Rapids and parts of the Upper Peninsula. The film was shown at four sold out screenings at the Traverse City Film Festival in 2022. From there, \"Quicksand\" won the Eau Claire International Film Festival, the top audience choice award at Hell's Half Mile, best screenplay at the Grand Rapids Film Festival and was accepted into the Austin Film Festival.\n\nContact McKenna Golat at mgolat@gannett.com or (810) 292-0122."
