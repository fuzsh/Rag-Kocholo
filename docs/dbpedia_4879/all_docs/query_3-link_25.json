        "text": "Mickey Rooney as an auto mechanic who falls for a manipulative blond with expensive tastes. He steals money in order to satisfy his craving for her company. Obviously this causes the Mick a lot of angst, a mental condition of which he was always better than average at portraying in his long screen career. The scenes in which much of the film is set are in a beach area boardwalk amusement park where Peter Lorre runs a shady pinball arcade business and has a connection with Rooney's flame played by Jeanne Cagney. Could have gone darker if the story had focused more on Lorre as he's pretty believable, especially with a switchblade. Still, \"Quicksand\" is in the classic film noir style if not entirely so for the direction the story follows.\n\nQuicksand is a pat story of a dumb guy who does a dumb thing, which causes him to have to do another dumb thing to cover up the first dumb thing, and a dumber thing to cover up the second dumb thing, and so on and so on.\n\nIt's fun to see Mickey Rooney play against type, but he brings almost nothing to the role being neither likable enough to side with nor believable as a desperate man. But Peter Lorre shows up for a brief while (like he always does) and creeps everyone out real good.\n\nAs a fan of stories like this, I found enough to keep me entertained for most of the run time. There's some dodgy voice-over and the end is utterly ridiculous and completely sexist (actually the whole movie is pretty sexist), but whatever. Broads just want mink coats and don't care who Mickey Rooney may or may not have killed, right?\n\nMickey Rooney vs Peter Lorre. The clash I didn't know I needed! Too bad they didn't do more about their rivalry for the climax, but whenever they did encounter, it was pure gold! Especially around that screwy Cagney sister. Really enjoyed this one and it was a effective way for Rooney to wipe off that clean MGM image of his."
