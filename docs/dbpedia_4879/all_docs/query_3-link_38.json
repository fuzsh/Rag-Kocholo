        "text": "MANISTIQUE – The independent Michigan-made film Quicksand will show at Cedar Street Cinema this Friday, Sept. 15 at 7 p.m. This screening comes only a few days before the film’s worldwide release on Sept. 19. There are additional showings in select theaters throughout Michigan as well.\n\nQuick- sand was shot in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, and the Upper Peninsula and was made by Practical – a production company based in Traverse City. This has been a five-year project for director JohnPaul Morris who started work on the screenplay back in 2018. Filming occurred over a three-week period in September 2019. Four years later, to the month, the film is being released in theaters across Michigan, including Marquette, Escanaba, and Iron Mountain.\n\n“We are thrilled to be screening this hometown project at Cedar Street Cinema,” said theater manager Don Erickson. “For me, Michigan is home, and always will be. I’m honored to play a small part in bringing this film to our fellow Michiganders.”\n\nDirector Morris will be available virtually for a special Q&A session immediately after the screening at\n\nCedar Street Cinema in Manistique.\n\nAccording to the film’s website, “Quicksand is a ‘bromantic comedy’ about two best friends who embark on a treacherous road trip to the U.P. after losing their best friend’s wedding ring days before the ceremony. Their quest accelerates into a loud exploration of life, love, and how to not die.”\n\nQuicksand premiered at the Traverse City Film Festival and went on to win the Audience Choice Award at Hell’s Half Mile Film & Music Festival and became an official selection at the Austin Film Festival.\n\nThe film is available for preorder on Apple TV/ iTunes and, if the filmmakers’ hopes become reality, it may be available on larger streaming platforms such as Netflix or Hulu."
