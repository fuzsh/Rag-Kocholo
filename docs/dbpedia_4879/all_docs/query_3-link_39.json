It’s not particularly amazing but I must say this: it was decently watchable.\n\nAs with most ‘one location’ setting, it’s an enforced method to make them feel vulnerable while making them overcome adversity in various ways. We are looking at the classical case where we are learning something from their past, so no surprise here.
