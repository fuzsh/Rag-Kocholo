        "text": "An elderly gentleman attempts to retrieve forgotten memories while battling the progression and regression of the cycles of life.\n\n—\n\nA week prior to his passing, my grandfather shared with me his former aspirations of becoming a filmmaker. After numerous hardships, a narrow escape from the Nazis and an immigration to the US, the dream slowly, but surely, faded away. After his passing, I uncovered an archival trove of dust-covered 8mm film that had seemingly not been viewed by anyone for at least a generation. Mesmerized, what unfolded before me was something most people, myself included, have never witnessed before: the development and utter decline of the human body and mind. Motivated by my grandfather’s unfulfilled dreams of filmmaking, I decided to piece together a film that he had already unwittingly made.\n\nquicksand is not only a personal tribute to my grandfather or father, but to anyone that has ever experienced loss. Whether it be a loss of a loved one, or a loss of memories, quicksand embodies the enigma of life and death.\n\n—\n\nNationally Televised: Slated to be distributed via PBS nationwide\n\nOfficial Selection: Las Vegas Film Festival\n\nOfficial Selection: Lovvet Film Festival\n\nHonorable Mention: Los Angeles Movie Awards\n\n—\n\nimdb.com/title/tt2807940/\n\n—\n\nDirector/Cinematographer/Editor: Lance Oppenheim\n\nProducer: The Opp-Guide\n\nFeaturing: Roy Oppenheim & Walter Oppenheim\n\nMusic: Jóhann Jóhannsson, Sigur Rós & Maxence Cyrin\n\nPost-Production Design: J.D.
