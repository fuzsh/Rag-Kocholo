        "text": "Ron Ruedi and the Hurricanes\n\nRon is truly an East County legend. For over 30 years his amazing talent as a one-man band, singing while playing both the guitar and drums, has been delighting audiences at local events and establishments. He has performed at Rockin Round the Block as well as various car shows in Gresham and has been a fixture at Lydia’s on Sunday nights. He brings tons of oldies and Rock n Roll favorites to the stage. Ron sings hits from BB King, Kool and the Gang, and Roy Orbison, to name just a few. Expect to hear songs from the 50s & 60s to the 90s, in a vast mixture of Surf Rock, Standard Rock ‘n Roll, Blues, R&B and Rockabilly. It will be a special treat to have him take the stage and cut loose for us. So come and do some shopping, eating, and enjoy the show.\n\nView Event →\n\nGREG PARKE\n\nGreg Parke has delighted audiences with his music and spontaneous humor for most of his life. As soon as he was able to walk, he would make his way over to the large console radio in his parents living room, put his ear up to the speaker, and sing along with the popular tunes of the day. At age 7, he built his first guitar out of an old cigar box and some fishing line, and by age 9 he went “pro”. (His first show earned him $5.00, which he used to buy a microphone!)\n\nMusic and performing have continued to be a major focus in his life ever since. Whether he is doing a rendition of a song made popular by another artist, or performing one of his originals, his laid back, relaxed performance style really draws the audience in, and leaves the listener feeling as if the song was performed just for them. It doesn’t matter if he is performing in a small, intimate venue, or in a large concert situation in front of a thousand or more, you get the feeling that he really loves to perform.\n\nHis musical past has covered many styles, all of which are evident in his songwriting and performing. Currently most of his performances are done on acoustic and electric MIDI guitars, allowing Greg to get guitar, bass and keyboard sounds from one instrument. He also uses a “looper”, allowing him to layer sounds, with the end result being a very full sound that is often mistaken for a full band. This is all done in real time, with no pre-recorded backing tracks.\n\nGreg’s musical style has been described as a fusion of modern folk, rock, country and adult alternative, and this is a fairly accurate description. One song might be an original haunting ballad about an old sailor at sea, followed by a well known rock and roll hit, and then move on to Faded Old Flag, a song he wrote as a “thank you” to our soldiers serving all over the world.\n\nGreg provides a wide range of music, ranging from 50’s and classic rock, to current pop, rock and crossover country, as well as originals. Greg also does a special tribute to Canadian singer/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot. Hear such classics such as Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, If You Could Read My Mind, Song The Minstrel Sang, Sundown , Affair on 8th Avenue, and many others. This tribute is especially suited for corporate events, wine tastings, performance centers, or any other type of concert or listening situation. Each performance can be altered to include Gordon Lightfoot songs only, or also include originals and other songs in a similar style.\n\nView Event →\n\nLEW JONES\n\nLEW JONES’ music career spans over three decades. As singer, songwriter and guitar virtuoso, Lew has opened for or shared the stage with Chubby Checker, Clarence Clemons, Shawn Colvin, Donovan, Tim Finn (Crowded House), Buddy Guy, David LaFlame, Los Lobos, Ray Manzarek (The Doors), the Meat Puppets, The Rippingtons, Dan Siegal, and Tower of Power, among others. A winner of The Portland Music Association’s Crystal Award for ‘Outstanding Folk Act’, Lew had a local hit on Ripcord Records with “The Terwilliger Bridge/I think I’m Gonna Rain Tonight in 1978/9 and his song ‘Saint John’s Street’ included on the NOPO Compilation in 2007. In between, he has written and recorded multiple CDs, including 2003’s Sublimation, and reaped extensive international airplay from three ‘Rainbow Samplers’ put out by Poetman Records. Lew has performed at a variety of regional and local events including Seattle’s Bumbershoot and the Portland-based NXNW, Rose Festival, The Bite of Oregon, and The Mayor’s Ball, and his US tours include gigs up and down the west coast and across the country. Lew is also an established poet and popular painter/muralist.\n\nView Event →\n\nCrooked Corner Band\n\nCrooked Corner Band consists of four lifelong musicians who perform original rock and classic selections spanning the last forty years. Very much a vocal band, Crooked Corner displays flawless 3 and 4 part harmony and the kind of musical precision that only comes with this kind of performing experience.\n\nAll the band members have recorded multiple CD’s and toured extensively playing everything from small intimate venues to concert halls and outdoor festivals all over the US and parts of Canada. Come see why they are getting noticed locally and you will become a Crooked Corner fan too!\n\nDave Conway – Lead Vocals and Rhythm Guitar\n\nSinger, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Dave’s passion can be heard and felt in his songs and live performances. His earliest recollection was hearing his brother singing harmonies to a new Beatles record and he just had to get involved with “all that magic”. Born and raised in New York, Dave would gather around the piano with his family and listen to jazz standards of the day. In later years, he relocated to Eugene, Oregon where he would blend his acoustic stylings with the classic rock and folk music scene of the west coast .\n\n“Let the music flow from your heart, it will always shine brightest.” – Dave\n\nWoody Woods – Bass and Vocals\n\nSinger, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer and owner of Pacific Northwest Records , Woody started playing drums onstage with his musical family at age eight. Woody later attended Crane School of Music in upstate NY and has since performed all over the US and Canada playing a wide range of music from folk to jazz and most things in between… Rock, Bluegrass, Blues, Country, you name it. Woody has worked with the Northwest band Full Circle and toured with the late roots-based guitarist/songwriter Tim Krekel. He is excited to be playing with this great group of musicians.\n\n“Where words fail, music speaks.” – Woody\n\nPaul Douglas – Lead Guitar, Keyboards, Violin and Vocals\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Paul was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma and moved to Seattle in 1973. In 1975 he relocated to Oregon to join the regionally iconic sensation “Wheatfield” and as a member of Wheatfield, was inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in 2011. His many musical influences include Eric Clapton, Doc Watson, Dickey Betts and Steve Lukather on guitar, Leon Russell, Floyd Cramer and Ray Charles on piano, Stephane Grapelli, Vassar Clements and Byron Berline on fiddle and many more on a variety of stringed or keyed instruments.\n\n“It’s a privilege to play with great musicians who understand that it’s all about the songs.” – Paul\n\nKenny Sawyer – Drums, Percussion and Vocals\n\nKenny’s been called the Russ Kunkel of Portland drummers… rock steady and tastefully understated but fully capable of kicking it with the best of them. Inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in 2011 as a member of the musically eclectic Portland, Oregon band Wheatfield, his vocal prowess and musical passion for everything from 60’s Beatles to 21st century retro-Americana now provide CCB with the steady and infectious groove that is guaranteed to get you up out of your seat, slap a smile on your face and put a wag in your walk.\n\n“The space between the licks is often more important than the licks themselves.” – Kenny\n\nView Event →\n\nDiane Tehrani - Acoustically Yours\n\nDiana Tehrani founded Acoustically Yours singing and playing guitar as a solo act in 2016. Friend and neighbor Bob French joined Acoustically Yours as lead guitar player in 2019 bringing with him a wonderful finger style of guitar play to compliment Diana’s lead vocals and back up guitar playing.\n\nDiana and Bob share a penchant for non-traditional acoustic songs.\n\nThe 2019 set list includes acoustic tributes to Metalica, Guns and Roses, Motley Crue, and Ozzy Ozborne.\n\nSing along and share a request to two!\n\nView Event →\n\nShanghaied on the Willamette\n\nShanghaied on the Willamette is the lively musical duo of Jonathan Lay and Gordy Euler. We perform songs and tunes \"plundered from land and sea,\" including traditional Celtic, English, and Old-Time American music, especially music of the sea and waterways. We accompany our vocal harmonies with a \"fleet\" of acoustic instruments, including fiddle, bodhran (Irish drum), guitar (6- and 12-string), mandola, tin whistles, harmonicas and banjo.\n\nJonathan, who’s powerful and supple voice can do justice to a gentle ballad or a rough-and-tumble sea chantey, plays guitar, tin whistle, harmonica, and a rollicking bodhran. Gordy is a skilled vocalist and a multi-instrumentalist who easily switches among fiddle, mandola, tin whistle, guitar and banjo. This broad range of sounds allows them to craft exciting and varied arrangements and programs.\n\nOur first performance together was in the 1992 Work Songs of the Sea Festival in Portland, Oregon, and we formed Shanghaied on the Willamette in the fall of that year. Since then we have performed in festivals, pubs, outdoor markets, and concerts in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. (SeeWhere We've Been.)\n\nView Event →\n\nAndrea Wilde and the Bad Wolves\n\nBorn in Liverpool, England, Andrea grew up with the sibling singing tradition emphasizing harmony and a capella performance. Andrea’s mother was from Caernarfon, Wales, and moved to Liverpool with Andrea’s grandmother and grandfather (Nain and Taid) during WWII. As a result, Andrea and her brother, Straford grew up in a Welsh speaking household hearing traditional, Welsh songs from infancy. They began singing in folk clubs throughout the North of England and Andrea was a regular at Liverpool’s Irish Centre. Their love of traditional folk music and a quest for adventure took them from Penzance to the Isle of Skye learning new material and performing along the way.\n\nAfter moving to the United States, Andrea continued to sing with her brother, Straford. They collaborated with Oregon Symphony cellist, Jim Smith in the band Both Wild and performed at folk festivals and music venues throughout the US. Both Wild released a CD recording in 2002 Just Say Nevoth.\n\nIn addition to the endeavor of Both Wild, Andrea pursued a variety of solo opportunities. She produced and hosted Irish, world folk and soul music programs on Portland’s independent KBOO radio. Her native wit and clear articulation earned her a go-to position within the community for hosting and emceeing all manner of music, cultural, charity and civic events. Andrea joined PSU Chorale and earned a longed-for opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall.\n\nIn 2011, Andrea teamed up with Sean Nos dancer, Maldon Meehan with a goal to merge traditional forms of percussive dance and song for stage performance (and their own enjoyment). And thus was the birth of The Stomptowners, a project which continues to grow and please crowds from Portland to beyond. Andrea also hosts a monthly unique event Global Folk Clubshowcasing folk music of diverse origins with a community singing component not unlike the folk clubs of Northern England.\n\nView Event →\n\nJessie Rae\n\nJessie Rae’s music is raw, real, and full of feel. Alive with rough edges and magical moments, Jessie Rae mixes honest lyrics, smooth harmonies, and a bluesy beat, infusing Portland’s indie music scene with a fresh sound. Whether they’re playing original tunes or songs in the public domain, Jessie Rae’s roots in folk, blues, funk and pop is unmistakable. With such a diverse lineage, it’s no wonder Jessie Rae’s sound has been described as “roots pop with a blues edge” and “cool funky folk.” Joan Meyer’s songwriting brings a subtle yet soulful groove to the Jessie Rae sound. From the rootsy tone of Lauren Semler’s slide guitar to the sultry blues of the vocals, Jessie Rae offers a unique sound all its own.\n\nView Event →\n\nWayne Richards and Southern Nights\n\nThe band has been a popular NW attraction for over a decade. The A&E once called their style \"Spicy Americana Originals\" and reviews in Positively Entertainment say that Wayne is a \"consummate performer and story teller\" and that \"the heart and soul of his music ricochets off you like a mountain sunrise welcoming a new day.\"\n\nThe legendary Dave Carter said, \"Take a heart as big as the western sky and then completely invent anew mousetrap around it and you'll have something like a song by Wayne.\" They are funny, up tempo, a little risque and all around good time. The band does original songs and several have won awards. \"Blue\" was the Portland Songwriters Association song of the year, Dallas Song Writer Association voted \"So Easy\" as a winner in their singer songwirter category, and \"Remember Me\" won the Nashville Golden Pen Award. The band includes Paul Hirschmann on lead guitars, Mark Evilsizer on drums, KJ Miller on vocal harmonies, Brent rogers on bass and vocal harmonies, and Wayne Richards on vocals and guitar. Southern Nights is a guaranteed good time!\n\nWayne Richards, 503-516-7879\n\nwrichards@pipeline.com\n\nwww.southernnights.net\n\nwww.myspace.com/waynerichardssouthernnights\n\nView Event →\n\nChristopher Kern and Tropical Wave\n\nFun in the Style of Jimmy Buffet!\n\nWith two Steel Pan Players and a Guitar playing vocalist, Tropical Wave is a smaller version of the nationally recognized Jimmy Buffett tribute band Tropical Storm.

It started as a jam night for a group of friends (all men) with many different instruments and just wanted a place to play. They called it the Thursday Night Gentlemen’s Club. Eventually they had played together long enough to get their sound right and they started booking some small gigs. They played local bars, some private parties, a few weddings and annual shows at Oaks Park. And of course, they continued their Thursday night jams and still have them today.\n\nThe majority of the original members of JG and The Cover Kings are still in the band, as only a few have changed over the years. The most recent and significant change to the band was the addition of a female lead vocalist in Jennifer Gantner. Her father, Curt “Corndog” Nelson was the original lead singer and helped build the band from the beginning. The original name of the band was simply The Cover Kings, but with the addition of a woman, we thought a slight name change was in order. Jennifer inherited her father’s singing talent and frequently joined The Cover Kings onstage at shows around town, both as backup to her dad and as lead on a few songs of her own. She grew up around this group of men and knows them like family.\n\nSadly, Curt passed away in 2015, but his musical legacy lives on through his daughter and his band. The Cover Kings asked Jennifer to be their new lead singer and they played their first show together in June 2016 at Oaks Park.\n\nThe other members of JG and The Cover Kings are:\n\nRick Berk - bass guitar & vocals\n\nPhil Hornik - lead guitar\n\nManuel Mateo - guitar & vocals\n\nPaul Yurick - drums\n\nLonnie Lester - percussion & drums\n\nMark Borgeson - keyboards\n\nMiguel Maldonado - saxophone\n\nAlthough classic rock is the band’s main forte, they also deliver a mix of blues, soft rock, soul, and even a little disco and country. They cover classics such as Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison, Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffett, Hurts So Good by John Cougar Mellencamp, Don’t Get Me Wrong by The Pretenders, Dream by Fleetwood Mac and many others.\n\nJG and The Cover Kings just simply love to play music. They particularly love to play songs that make people happy, get people dancing and want to sing along!\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Hot Club Time Machine\n\nThis lively group of Portland characters lights up the room everywhere they play.

His musical influences have been many, with Steely Dan, Boz Scaggs and Kenny Loggins among the strongest. His blending of fluent jazz/pop guitar stylings, memorable hook-oriented songs and his strong vocal performance make for a rich musical experience.\n\nBernie writes about what he observes - of love gone well and love gone away, of nature and our place in it, of the need for social responsibility, and the many faces of love and kindness.\n\nBernie’s recent performances include the Robin Hood Festival in Sherwood, the Rotary Concert Series in Wilsonville, a variety of farmers markets, and other CD release events.
