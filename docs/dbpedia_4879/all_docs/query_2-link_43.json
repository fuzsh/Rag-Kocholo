        "text": "Italy is reforming its film and TV tax credit. It will channel more funds into national productions by introducing a €18M cap on payouts for international shows and movies and reducing the rebate from 40% to around 30%.\n\nAs foreign producers plan for this shift, the current variety of incentives for feature films, documentaries, and TV series productions remains in place.\n\nINTERNAL TAX CREDIT\n\nAn Italian production company can obtain up to 40% of the eligible costs of the total budget as tax credit for feature films, documentaries and TV series productions. The tax credit is not automatic: not every project can access to it so we offer our expertise before submitting to the whole ministerial process and then managing it.\n\nThere are two phases of application: the first one determines if the project is eligible for the tax credit, the second one starts as soon as it is determined that the project can obtain the credit. From when the second phase starts, a year passes before the credit is transferred to the firm. The PSN Italy team can analyze a project to determine potential eligibility for the credit, processing times and all the necessary costs.\n\nEXTERNAL TAX CREDIT\n\nTo encourage investment in the film industry, there is also a tax credit of 20% for Italian companies outside the industry, which can arrive up to 40% if the film obtains a fund from the state as well. This specific possibility requires that the local film company is involved in development of the project, the sooner the better.\n\nEligibility for both tax credits is subject to approval by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage, MIC.\n\nFUS – Unique Fund for Performing Arts\n\nThe government provides direct funding for projects it determines a priority, following a study of the script, writers, actors, Italian talent, historical & cultural interest, and more. Funding is both for the development stage and the production of the project. Production companies which retain partial rights of a film may apply. The evaluation process usually requires that a producer seeking this funding applies at least one year in advance.\n\nREGIONAL FUNDS / FILM COMMISSION FUNDS\n\nEach Italian region publishes a fund with specific budgets for films, documentaries and TV series every year.\n\nCriteria determining eligible costs and the type of assistance vary from region to region and can be either confirmed or modified each year. It is necessary to have the documentation ready at least six months before the application to the fund, therefore the application needs to be considered long before the starting of the project.\n\nTell us more about your project so we can help determine how to best take advantage of the incentives now available in Italy!\n\nA 2024 update to the film incentive in Greece has streamlined the process while ensuring that a 40% cash rebate remains available for all Greek qualifying expenses related to pre-production, filming, post-production, animation, and CGI.\n\nEligible projects include feature films, scripted TV shows, creative documentaries, animation films, and video games. Advertising spots, reality shows, and sports programs are excluded.\n\nThe minimum Greek spend requirement is €200,000 per feature film projects or up to 16 episodes of TV shows with a minimum spend of 120.000 Euros per episode. For projects with local expenditures exceeding €8 million, the 40% cash rebate will also cover the fees of the international director and two leading actors.\n\nDuring the previous years, 85 international projects have been awarded -and cashed out already- approx. 94.000.000 euros as 40% cash rebate for their production expenses in Greece.\n\nA minimum annual budget of €55 million is now allocated for cash rebate grants, supporting over €175 million in productions annually. The rebate cap per project is set at €8 million, with the potential to increase to €10 million for projects that promote Greece.\n\nOur team has serviced over 30 long form TV and feature film projects, supporting more than 120 shoot days annually with crews of 80 to 120 persons plus cast and extras, along with equipment and gear needs, for clients like Warner, Netflix, Grandview, ITV, RTL Studios, Banijay, Freemantle, Polsat, and more.\n\nWe have the expertise and a dedicated team to manage all cash rebate procedures seamlessly. Moreover, safety and sustainability remain at the core of our operations, ensuring a responsible and secure environment for all involved.\n\nIf you believe Greece could be the ideal location for your next project, reach out to setup a call so we can walk you through the advantages of shooting in our wonderful country!\n\nThe incentive in Czech Republic covers Feature Films, Documentaries and Animation Films of at least 70 minutes in length. Fictional TV Films, 70 mins or longer and TV Series of at least 30 minutes per episode also qualify.\n\nThe present 20% rebate on qualifying Czech costs, crew suppliers etc. is expected to increase soon. There is also what amounts to about 10% on above the line Foreign costs eg Producers, Directors and Actors if paid in CZ by a CZ Servicing Company.\n\nThe minimum Production Spend for a feature film is around 625,000 Euros and 330,000 Euros for a TV episode. The current 6,250,000 euro cap per project is slated for a boost.\n\nThere is a Culture Test to pass as well, but our team can help complete the paperwork necessary to secure funds. The Rebate Application costs around 1,250 euros, and a CZ Registered Company must make the Application. A bank account has to be opened with customary bank charges as well.\n\nThe application is eligible for 4 years. A translated Script Synopsis, plus a translation of the First Episode must be submitted with each application.\n\nIncluded in the Budget will need to be fees for an Audit of the project, plus a fee for the Accountant to reconcile the spend and the Tax Rebate Budget.\n\nSadly, Reality Shows do not qualify!\n\nContact us to discuss the details of your project to put it on the fast track to filming in Czech Republic.\n\nGenerous tax incentives are available on the island of Ireland. The structure of each differs between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and both systems operate independently and under separate rules.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Section 481 applies to feature film, TV Drama (single or series), animation, and creative documentary (it is currently NOT applicable to commercials). It is a tax credit of up to 32% of ‘eligible expenditure’ based on the cost of ALL cast and crew working in Ireland, regardless of nationality, as well as goods, services, and facilities purchased in Ireland. Half of a minimum production expenditure of €250k (€125k) must qualify as local expenditure in order to qualify for the incentive. As Variety says, ‘The increase in Ireland’s tax incentive, Section 481, and other changes, such as a broadening of the eligible spend covered by the tax credit to include the fees for Hollywood talent, will give Ireland one of the most generous production environments in the world.’\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the UK system of tax relief applies. The qualifying criteria vary a little depending on the medium – film (theatrical release), high-end TV, animation, children’s TV, video games. In brief this means that tax relief is available at 25% of qualifying expenditure once a number of conditions are met.\n\nContact us for more information. We’re here to help.\n\nAustria introduced a new tax incentive program in 2023 for international productions under the FISA+ name, overseen by Austria’s Federal Ministry of Digital and Economic Affairs. The rate of the incentive can go up to 35%, which consists of a 30% base rebate for all the eligible costs and an additional 5% as a Green Filming bonus.\n\nThe eligible productions are the ones that are intended for TV, cinema, or a streaming platform, in the fiction, documentary, or VR genre. Ineligible productions are: business and advertising films; filmed theater performances, concerts, or sport events (including broadcasts); talk shows, prize shows; casting shows; TV interviews; competitions; news and lotteries.\n\nThere is no required minimum overall production cost that a project has to meet to be eligible, only a required minimum local spending. For fiction this limit is € 150,000, for documentaries € 80,000, and for animations, VFX projects, and film music productions €25,000. The maximum amount of the grant is € 5 million for films and € 7.5 million for series.\n\nThe productions also have to pass a point-based cultural test. The test consists of 3 main categories: cultural content, crew members, and technical details of the project.\n\nThe additional 5% Green Filming bonus can only be granted together with the base 30% subsidy. Its main target is to encourage an environment-friendly production rather than providing additional funds. This is because the requirements of the bonus involve the hiring of additional crew members and the implementation of strict guidelines in every department which is overseen by the grant’s provider.\n\nThe incentive program doesn’t have a yearly budget cap. So if a project is eligible, it will receive the grant regardless of the time of year or the number of previous supported projects in that given year. The usual length of the evaluation process is 30 days. Payment normally happens in two installments: 30% at the start of the production and 70% after reviewing the final costs.\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to share your plans with us so we can help you to understand if your production is eligible for the subsidy!\n\nSpain offers tax incentives for international shoots in the form of a tax rebate of up to 30%, except for in the Canary Islands where it is 50%. Navarre offers 35% via tax credit.\n\nGeneral Incentive: 30% Tax Rebate\n\n*General incentive of 30% in the first million euros and 25% for the rest of the expenditure made in Spain\n\n*Foreign production types: feature length films, television series, animated films, and documentaries.\n\n*Maximum rebate limit: 20 million Euros for feature film and 10 million Euros per episode of a series.\n\n*Beneficiaries: Spanish companies which are registered in the Film and Audio-visual Arts Institute’s register of audio-visual producers.\n\n*Rebate base: Eligible expenses incurred in Spain.\n\n*Eligible expenses: Creative staff with a registered address in the country or in another European Union member state included.\n\n*Minimum expense incurred in Spain: 1 million Euros and 200.000 euros for Animation and VFX projects\n\n*Procedure: The refund must be applied for by the Spanish company, during the month of July of the year after the end of filming.\n\nNavarre Incentive: 35% Tax Credit\n\nAs Navarre is a chartered territory with its own taxation system, it also has its own Corporation Tax Law which applicable tax benefits are subject to in this community: Article 65.2. Regional Order 24/1996, dated the 30th of December, on Corporation Tax (Text applicable on the 31st of December 2016) Rebate for investments in film and series audiovisual productions.\n\n*Beneficiaries: Companies which are based in Navarre, and which are registered in the Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute’s register of audiovisual producers.\n\n*Shoot duration: At least a week.\n\n*Procedure: The incentive goes up to 35% for a mixed modality rebate of the corporation tax plus fiscal credit. If the tax to be paid is not high enough to cover the total amount of fiscal credit, the rest could be deducted from the Income Tax over the following years for a maximum of 15 years.\n\nCanary Islands Incentive: 50% Tax Rebate\n\nWhen shooting in the Canary Islands, there are special conditions involved if you want to access tax incentives, as the region complies with two of the conditions set by the European Commission to qualify for this tax system – it is an insular and outlying territory. The same common law is applied with a series of mark-ups.\n\n* General incentive: 50% in the first million euros, the minimum qualified expenditure. 54% on the first million Euros when total qualified expenditure exceeds 1.9 million Euros. 45% for the rest of the expenditure made in the Canary Islands.\n\n* Maximum rebate limit: 36 million Euros for feature film and 18 million Euros per episode for a series. There is no limit on the number of episodes.\n\n* Beneficiary: Companies with a registered address in the Canaries, which are registered in the Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute’s register of audiovisual producers, and which are managing the production overseas.\n\nLet’s discuss your project, and how we can work together to secure the rebate for it.\n\nUruguay offers cash rebate incentives for foreign film projects that are completely or partly made in the country. The broad-based reimbursement to qualifying projects are available to producers of commercials, feature films, short films, music videos, animations, documentaries, TV productions and series for all types of media distribution services such as TV, OTT, VOD, Streaming, Theatrical releases, etc.\n\nA minimum production spend of USD 150.000 in Uruguay is required to benefit from the 20% cash rebate for commercials. The rebate cap is USD 100.000. The rebate increases to 25% of eligible costs for all other types of projects spending more than USD 300.000 in the country. The max. cash rebate other types of projects is USD 1.000.000 per project.\n\nRebates are made directly to the foreign producer, though a local production service company must be hired to work locally with the foreign production company. Government paybacks can be expected 3 months after the production wrap and successful presentation of an audit.\n\nAlso worth noting is that production expenses within this framework are VAT exempt.\n\nThese are the fundamental parameters. Precise details are best explored on a case-by-case basis so don’t hesitate to reach out to us with your project’s details. We aim to maximize the savings available to your foreign production in Uruguay.\n\nAs one of the production service companies registered by Uruguay’s Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts (ICAU), we are also positioned to discuss co-productions eligible for Uruguay. It is helpful to note from the outset that selection processes make this approach practical for qualifying productions with all needed documentation prepared for submission at least 3 months prior of starting principal photography in the country. Local film financing options can also be explored.\n\nApplication process (Submission-Evaluation- Approval) totals 30 days.\n\nWrite us with details about your project and the form of assistance you seek. We’re here to help bring your project to shoot with us in Uruguay and to benefit with all our country has to offer.\n\nIsrael provides a cash rebate of 30% to foreign producers of feature films and TV series. The qualified local expenditure ranges from a minimum of 500,000 ILS (≈140,000 USD) to a maximum of 16,600,000 ILS (≈5,000,000 USD).\n\nInternational production companies may apply via an Israeli producer such as the PSN Israel Partner. Production companies must have produced and distributed at least 2 feature films and/or TV series in the past 5 years to qualify.\n\n80% of the rebate will be paid during filming in Israel against invoices upon obtaining the approval of the professional advisor on behalf of the Ministry of Economy & Industry. The remaining 20% will be given after the production is complete.\n\nIndependent of Israel’s incentive is cash back of up to 60% to foreign producers of feature films and TV dramas set in the city of Jerusalem. Producers may only access one incentive per project.\n\nThe Jerusalem fund seeks stories written to showcase the city’s locations and landscapes in a positive light, such as a romantic comedy. Part of a high-profile film, such as an opening scene for a James Bond feature, may also qualify as readily as a TV drama if the whole episode takes place in the city.\n\nScripts seeking to qualify for the incentive will not depict stereotypes of Jerusalem as a place of hatred between Jews and Arabs, a place of Orthodox Jews, a place for bombing, etc.\n\nFor consideration, applicants must submit a film synopsis and inform fund managers of the projected spend in Israel, as well as the portion that is earmarked for Jerusalem. 50% of the total shoot days in Israel must be executed in Jerusalem in order to qualify. Initial feedback on viability is normally provided within a few weeks.\n\nContact us for guidance on how best to qualify your project for incentives in Israel.\n\nBelgium is an attractive multi-layered cake when it comes to film financing, offering multiple attractive incentives to international co-productions on different levels, which can easily be combined.\n\nMost important, there is the Belgian Tax Shelter incentive: it applies to the whole of the country and is open to European co-productions through the European Convention on Cinematographic co-production or to productions set up within the framework of a bilateral co-production agreement between Belgium (or one of its communities) and another state. Such bilateral co-production agreements exist with Canada, China, Israel, Tunisia, and several European countries. Others are currently being negotiated.\n\nThe Tax Shelter incentive is open for film, documentary, animation, and TV drama. Based upon the amount of qualifying production costs spent in the European Economic Area and Belgium, it can provide financing up to 42%.\n\nIn addition, there are also regional economic and cultural funds, both of which are available to qualifying international projects as well, with financing up to 24%. Flanders Audiovisual Fund (VAF) and the Centre du Cinema et de l’Audiovisuel (French speaking community) are the cultural funds. Screen Flanders, Screen Brussels, and Wallimage (Wallonia) are the economic funds, investing mainly in international co-productions to stimulate the local audiovisual industry.\n\nThis means that for qualifying productions, up to 66% of eligible costs can be financed by the Belgian film funds.\n\nAs an EU country, Belgium has also access to the main European sources of funding – i.e. Eurimages and the Creative Europe programme. Speak to us for more details.\n\nThe Lithuanian Film Tax Incentive offers an opportunity to save up to 30% of the film production budget through a private investment scheme.\n\nForeign filmmakers must cooperate with a local production company like ours to submit the application. The local company will assume responsibility for finding a local film donor willing to invest up to 30% of your production budget in exchange of a reduced corporate income tax.\n\nThis win-win sees foreign film production companies receive financial assistance for filmmaking in Lithuania; private donors in return can deduct the amount granted for the filmmaking process from their taxable income. The estimated net profit for the donor participating in the scheme is up to 11,25%.\n\nThe incentive is available for the production of feature films, TV dramas, documentaries, and animated films. It includes domestically produced, co-produced, or commissioned films. At least 80% of eligible film production costs must be incurred in Lithuania. The total amount of eligible spend in Lithuania must exceed 43,000 EUR.\n\nQualification for funding also relies on a project meeting cost and script criteria. Reach out to us with details so we can assist in the assessment to secure funds for your project.\n\nFeature films, series – fiction, animation, and documentary projects are eligible for state rebate of 30% of qualified expenditure in Poland.

All qualified production costs can be included – that is, for the expenses that are spent in Hungary and those foreign expenses that are directly associated with the scenes shot in Hungary. There is no limit to what size the budget can be when applying.\n\nSubsidies are only available for feature films, documentaries, and drama series. They are not eligible for commercials, reality shows, or soap operas.\n\nThere is a ‘cultural test’ which reduces the chance of receiving a subsidy if the production does not portray European locations in the scenes, and if the project is purely about violence. Content that is severely detrimental to minors (i.e., adult movies) is not likely to be accepted either. Productions employing a significant amount of Hungarian crew members increase the odds of receiving a subsidy.\n\nSubsidy funds are, in all cases, delivered after the shoot, often at the end of the year.
