        "text": "The threat of quicksand, of slowly sinking into a gritty sludge as it fills your lungs, is inextricably linked with our DNA. Or at least it feels that way. Quicksand has been around since at least the 1950s, when adventure stories took place in mysterious jungles and deserts. As those stories fell out of fashion, quicksand narratives kept chugging right along thanks to Disney.\n\nCartoons like Aladdin, Darkwing Duck, and Ducktales (just to name a few) all have subplots in which someone sinks into quicksand. It's almost like animators were warning children that these dangerous sinkholes could be around every corner. The Princess Bride gave audiences a variation on quicksand with \"lightning sand,\" which swallows up anyone who steps into its radius with amazing speed.\n\nThink about it: How does quicksand even work? Wet sand doesn't have a suction effect, so there would have to be a kind of bottomless pit beneath the sand where you would presumably fall. Could one pit of quicksand exist? Sure. But it's ludicrous to think the planet is crawling with quicksand pits waiting to swallow everyone up.\n\nWhat goes up must come down. In the case of an elevator, that often occurs when the cables snap and drop someone to a painful doom. Or at least that's what happens in films like Gremlins 2 and, more notably, Speed, where a terrorist rigs the cable wires to snap, dropping the elevator and its riders a few floors before it's caught by the emergency brakes. Moments after the hostages are evacuated, the elevator crashes to the ground.\n\nElevator cables have snapped in the past, but not with the regularity this trope would have audiences believe. Even if an elevator does fail, there are a number of backups and safety procedures in place to keep the people on the elevator relatively unscathed. Feel free to ride elevators in peace - just don't do that thing where you hit all of the buttons on your way out.\n\nEven though the closest most people have ever been to the Amazon is two-day express shipping, it's hard to forget the fear of falling into a river and being chewed down to a skeleton by a bunch of ravenous piranhas. Logically, this kind of demise doesn't make any sense, but after films like You Only Live Twice and The Last Dragon, where piranhas are used as a means of human disposal, it's easy to see where the irrational fear came from.\n\nPiranhas are dangerous; they're creepy little fish. They can detect blood in the water and have a genuine talent for cleaning meat from a carcass. That being said, piranhas can't strip a human body of all its meat in moments. It would take a large school of piranhas quite a while to devour a person, and it's highly unlikely they would do it to a living being. But just to be safe, don't go jumping in any tropical rivers in South America.\n\nDolls with minds of their own aren't just found in horror movies like Child's Play and the Puppet Master series. Toy Story, Monsters University, and Coraline all have dolls that move around on their own. Even if they're not homicidal dolls like Chucky, these clandestine living toys are all existentially horrifying.\n\nObviously, there's no such thing as a doll that can follow you from room to room in the middle of the night, waiting to cut your Achilles' tendon. There aren't even dolls that have their own private lives while you're out of the room. Does that make a room full of dolls any less creepy? Of course not - dolls are scary, and they always will be.\n\nYou're not alone if you felt genuine stress about the Bermuda Triangle in your youth. Stories about disappearing boats, lost time, and creepy creatures have been a staple of this section of the North Atlantic for decades. In the 1970s, the Marvel Comics character Skull the Slayer introduced young audiences to the concept of a time warp in the Bermuda Triangle, a portal that left him stranded in the Savage Lands.\n\nModern pieces of media like The Addams Family and Percy Jackson suggest that not only do monsters and world-ending weather patterns swirl around this area, but that a person can lose their mind and memory if they spend too much time in the Triangle.\n\nThis is all freaky, but it's important to remember that the Bermuda Triangle is off the coast of Florida, and it extends to Puerto Rico. People literally live in the Bermuda Triangle, and they're not getting sucked into vortices or losing their memories on a daily basis. (Unless they are and we just don't know about it.)\n\nCharacters have been losing their hands in their sink's garbage disposal left and right throughout film history. Or at least since the 1980s when the amenity became a normal household appliance. The most famous hand in the garbage disposal scene takes place in Final Destination 2. Hunky soon-to-be corpse Evan Lewis commits the cardinal garbage disposal sin when he slips his hand into the drain to grab his new ring. He doesn't have his arm gnawed off by the disposal's metal teeth, but they do hold him in place while his cheese sticks catch on fire and burn down his apartment.\n\nThere are tons of other examples of this trope: Halloween H2O inverts the trope by having Michael Myers whomp some kid whose arm is stuck in the disposal; in Amityville 4, a well-meaning handyman has his hand mangled by a haunted disposal; and the NBC show Heroes was actually sued by a garbage disposal manufacturer for showing just how dangerous the appliance can be.\n\nThis isn't really a \"dumb fear.\" Someone could absolutely get their hand destroyed by a garbage disposal, but the trick to avoiding that is just not to stick your hand down into your sink's cavernous yet enticing drain."
