        "text": "Shudder survival thriller Quicksand builds an entire premise around its namesake, leaving a bickering, estranged married couple trapped in a pit of despair. Director Andrés Beltrán and writer Matt Pitts approach the B-movie concept with a seriousness that nearly works for their efficient thriller, placing relevance on the emotional stakes for its leads over jungle thrills. It leaves the thrills underplotted in Quicksand, however.\n\nAn opening sequence introduces the unforgiving terrain; a pair of poachers prowl a dangerous area of the Colombian jungle called Las Arenas to hunt and retrieve valuable skin from a venomous snake. Cut to couple Josh (Allan Hawco) and his wife Sofia (Carolina Gaitán) as they head to a medical conference in Bogotá; but the car ride there is rife with friction despite Josh’s best efforts to diffuse the tension. The estranged couple is gearing up for divorce, making this business trip even more uncomfortable. It’s exacerbated by Josh’s eagerness to take a hiking excursion while the more rigid Sofia longs to get business done and return home to the kids. A series of events sees the pair venturing unwittingly out to Las Arenas, where they wind up trapped in quicksand with no way out and no one aware of their location. The icy tension between the pair only heightens the punishment mother nature has in store for them.\n\nBeltrán takes a tactile, practical approach to the setting. Josh and Sofia get sucked into more of a boggy mud pit that makes their physical performances palpable. The grueling exhaustion from the thick muck holding them in place, threatening to pull them under completely, is effective thanks to the tangible component.\n\nOnce the spouses get firmly lodged in place, enmeshed in unforgiving mother nature, the plotting slows to a crawl as the script relies on scant few encounters with slithering animals to submerse Josh and Sofia in a primal marriage counseling of sorts. Each jungle obstacle peels back layers to Jack and Sofia’s history, humanizing the initially icy Sofia and revealing a fuller picture that led to their crumbling relationship. On that front, Hawco’s disarming empathy and Gaitán’s relatable resentment of forced pragmatism lend realism and rooting interest. But the marriage woes take up too much space in this underplotted thriller, leading to a repetitive, superficial pattern. Josh and Sofia ultimately encounter too few obstacles, each getting briskly swept aside to give precedence to deep-seated relationship issues.\n\nIt results in a feature at odds with itself. On the one hand, Beltrán’s commitment to taking the couple’s predicament seriously results in compelling set pieces and a tender approach to characters that ultimately endear. On the other hand, Quicksand never once acknowledges how outlandish this scenario can be. It also never fully embraces it. The hunters and Las Arenas never get explored beyond setting up the plot, even as a side story incorporates them. Nor does the jungle element come through as much as it could. Instead, it’s reduced to a grim and serious marriage metaphor plot device. Even at a brisk 85-minute runtime, Quicksand often feels stretched too thin.\n\nBut it does at least make for a sufficient marriage counseling exercise.\n\nShudder debuts Quicksand on July 14, 2023.\n\nKetchup Entertainment’s Hellboy: The Crooked Man once again takes the franchise in a new direction, with Jack Kesy (12 Strong) taking over the title role this time around.\n\nOddly enough, however, the film’s official UK poster refers to Hellboy: The Crooked Man as “the fourth installment in the global franchise.” Technically true, of course, but usually a franchise reboot of this sort isn’t labeled that way. In any event, check out the UK art below.\n\nHellboy: The Crooked Man comes to UK theaters on September 27, with no United States release date announced at this time. We tip our hats to Total Film for sharing the UK art today.\n\nMike Mignola co-wrote the new Hellboy film with Christopher Golden.\n\nHellboy: The Crooked Man is “set in the 1950s and costars Adeline Rudolph (Resident Evil) as a rookie agent of the BPRD who teams up with Hellboy to protect the residents of Appalachia from the creepy Crooked Man, who is collecting souls for the devil.”\n\nBrian Taylor (Crank, Gamer, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Mom and Dad) directed the movie for Millennium, based on a Hellboy mini-series from 2008. The story is said to “expand Hellboy’s world through one of the most beloved issues of the comic series.”\n\nJefferson White (Yellowstone) stars alongside Kesy and Rudolph as Tom Ferrel, Leah McNamara as Effie Kolb, Joseph Marcell as Reverend Watts, Hannah Margetson as Cora Fisher, and Martin Bassindale as the Crooked Man, among others.\n\n“The Crooked Man is a departure from all previous Hellboy films where Mike Mignola and the creator of the comics will finally shepherd an authentic version of his stories and characters in film form,” said Millennium Media’s President Jeffrey Greenstein. “This is the first in the series of films that will captivate audiences in familiar (and new) ways. Brian Taylor is an expert across the board, and I couldn’t think of a better person to bring this story to life to show our audience this different and original Hellboy slate of films.”\n\nMillennium Media is producing the new movie alongside Dark Horse Entertainment."
