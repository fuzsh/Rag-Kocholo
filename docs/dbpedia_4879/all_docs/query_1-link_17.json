        "text": "You are releasing your film backwards on YouTube and the best practice would be to release it backwards. What the H-E double hockey sticks(HELL) does that mean? ❗ The current model goes something like this… -Release teaser trailer -Release behind the scenes/making of movie -Release snippets or scenes from the movie -Release full trailer -Release film That feels backwards! So do that backwards for a better model. Why does that feel backwards? Because you are emulating an old model to build as much awareness and exposure as possible to get an audience to pay and see your film in one large short burst - the release weekend in cinemas. But that's not how YouTube works. YouTube is a platform of instant gratification, so give the users what they want right away. So here is what I would do instead. -Release film Now that you have the film released, you have a way to point all the attention from the rest of the stuff below, to your film. -Release teaser trailer -Release behind the scenes/making of -Release snippets and scenes from the film -Release the official trailer At the end of each of those videos, you can go ahead and direct the viewer to watch the official film. On YouTube it doesn't matter if the film is there first. That's not the game, the game is long tail. Meaning you are driving consistent and constant attention to the film that is already released...not the film you are about to release. Now this isn't to say you can't or shouldn't have some sort of promo material before hand, but don't put all the promo and marketing upfront, save a majority of it after you post the film. Your goal isn't to build awareness BEFORE the film, it is to drive audience engagement AFTER ther film is released. Then you will drive a whole lot more traffic to your film.\n\nWhy Now Is the Perfect Time to Invest in Film Why now? Why is this the golden moment to invest in films? Imagine you're at the forefront of a shift, a unique intersection where cultural appetite meets technological advancement. Traditional “Hollywood” is currently pivoting away from the superhero era into video game IP’s. And, while this may seem like “the thing” to do, the model is no different than trying to find the next franchise-based trend as once before. Overblown budgets and convoluted processes still orchestrate the status quo. This opens up opportunistic voids to be filled! Independent cinema, with its raw, untethered storytelling, is uniquely positioned to thrive. There’s a reason why recent films like “The Holdovers” and “Sound of Freedom” did so well. The film industry is undergoing a major transformation, propelled by an insatiable demand for diverse, engaging content and facilitated by unprecedented access through digital platforms. As traditional barriers crumble, the opportunity for ROI grows, not just financially but culturally. Cinema Country is at this crossroads, blending the art of cinema with the science of smart methodology and investment. Intrigued by the timing and potential of investing in film? The landscape is ripe with opportunity for those who dare to think differently about their portfolio. Let’s discuss how you can be part of this exciting journey. Reach out, and let’s chart a conversation. #FilmProduction, #BoldDistribution, #IndependentCinema, #Storytelling, #FilmFinancing, #InvestmentOpportunity\n\nThis article is absolutely bonkers. A movie director named Carl Rinsch sells a show to Netflix for around $61 million dollars. Rinsch’s most famous movie is 47 Ronin starring Keanu Reeves. The director spends $44 million on the series then says he needs another $11 million. So far so good…but he takes the $11 million and deposits it into a brokerage account and loses about $5.9 million trading stocks. Then takes what’s left and buys DOGE coin the crypto with the cute Shiba Inu logo. The $4 million becomes $27 million. Thomas Cherian, a spokesperson for Netflix, told The Times that they've written off Rinsch's series, adding that it was \"clear that Mr. Rinsch was never going to complete the project he agreed to make.\" Rinsch declined to answer The Times' questions when contacted for comment. Rinsch and Netflix are currently undergoing confidential arbitration proceedings, per The Times. Rinsch, who The Times said had initiated the arbitration, says Netflix owes him at least $14 million in damages for breaching their contract. How did this happen? Did any of the money get spent on the series? I’d like to see a documentary on this whole situation. https://lnkd.in/gAGvnqpk"
