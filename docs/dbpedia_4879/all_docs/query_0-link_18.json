        "text": "Okay, there’s this thing on YouTube where people will make fake trailers for movies that are never gonna happen and do not exist, and its beyond frustrating, because now I have to carefully vet which channels are real movie trailer channels, and which ones are just speculating. One surefire tell for me is whether or not the trailer is for a sequel to a movie or character that was wildly popular ten years ago, and if the trailer just looks like wish fulfillment, like another Iron Man 4. Trust me if there was going to be another Iron Man with Robert Downey Jr. we would never hear the end of it! That news would be everywhere.\n\nIt helps that I’ve watched so many movies (especially almost all of the MCU films) that I can easily tell when footage has simply been recycled. Also, are there any PoC in the trailer? I noticed that the guys who make these fake trailers never think to put women of color in any them, so they often look like wish fulfillment ideas of the good old days, before Black actresses were invented. These new trailers often completely ignore the existence of the new characters (and sometimes even roles) played by PoC, and sometimes even the old ones, for example Ive not seen a single fake ass trailer for Black Panther, or The Marvels 2. After a while it becomes pretty clear that what the makers of these trailers are actually wishing for, the good old days when all the heroes were white men (and the sidekicks were Black men.)\n\nThe Beast Within\n\nWe don’t often get good werewolf movies. I mean there have been a few in the past ten years, but it’s still nice to see this particular monster make a mainstream comeback. There was a movie earlier this year, called Blackout, which looked promising, but I haven’t watched it yet, and there is another one coming out later this year called Werewolves. Personally, I prefer the more artsy style movies like the French film, Animals or the forthcoming What Remains of Us. I am only mildly curious about this one, but I always hope these films are good. The last werewolf movie I really enjoyed was Wolf of Snow Hollow, a very dark and gory comedy. I also watched last year’s Werewolves Within. I enjoyed it, more or less, but your mileage may vary on that one.\n\nSweet Home Season 3\n\nI’m really looking forward to this next season, since I really enjoyed the first two. The novelty of people surviving a monster apocalypse, while hoping they don’t become actual monsters, hasn’t worn off yet. I love the monsters in this series, which are highly imaginative, and genuinely terrifying, and the story and characters aren’t too bad, either. It’s a fun Saturday afternoon binge or a scary Friday night, leave-the-lights-on, watch. I truly, genuinely, love Horror movies and shows, but I still mostly watch these things in the daytime!\n\nVenom: The Last Dance\n\nI am a huge fan of superhero (and adjacent) movies that just lean into the craziness of the experience. Superheroes are, by nature, patently absurd, and I love it when the plots and characters just know this, and run with it. The Venom series was like that from the very beginning. It doesn’t hurt that Tom Hardy turns in a great performance as both characters.\n\nThat said, I think some of the best superhero movies ever made are the comedies like the first Spiderman trilogy, the last two Thor movies, and the Suicide Squad remake. I’m looking forward to the craziness of the Venom franchise again this Fall.\n\nTokyo Cowboy\n\nOne of the more intriguing little Indie films to be released in 2024 is this little East/West gem of a mashup. Movies about the clashes between the Eastern and Western cultures, along with fish out of water themes, always gets my butt in a seat, and it doesn’t hurt that I immediately liked the hapless lead character.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nI’m not sure if I want to watch a Crime series, (mostly because I just don’t find the intricacies of criminal politicking especially interesting) but I genuinely liked The Penguin from Reeves Batman movie, as played by an unrecognizable Colin Farrell. He’s always a great actor to watch, so I may just end up doing something I almost never do, which is actually sitting down to watch a Crime show that is NOT a documentary.\n\nProject Silence\n\nThis is one of those obscure Korean Horror movies that I will probably never see or hear of again. It seems interesting, if a bit claustrophobic. It does look like a deliciously anxiety producing movie to watch on some dark October night. I will be watching this in the daytime!\n\nThose About To Die\n\nThis is another series Im not sure about. Several times this year, I’ve started series I thought I would finish, and then I didn’t. This may end up being another casualty of my lack of attention. I like the idea of it, and it looks nice, I just don’t know if I want to commit to it. Once again, it’s got some intricate, detailed, political intrigue that one needs to follow to understand the plot, and while I’m not opposed to that, I’m also not particularly keen on it either. I’m not always in the mood to follow these multi-character, multi- plot thread, political series, or rather I will only watch one at a time.\n\nNosferatu\n\nFinally! I’ve been waiting for this trailer. Being a Robert Eggers fan makes this movie one of my most hotly anticipated of the year. Yes, I have seen the original 1922 version and the Klaus Kinski remake, (I prefer the Kinski version, although the 1922 version holds up pretty well). I wouldn’t call Nosferatu a favorite, but I’ve seen it a couple of times, and wonder how this will compare to the previous two. Once again, I expect greatness (and more than a little bit of weirdness) from Eggers. And yeah, I expect to actually be scared, because there hasn’t been a vampire film that’s done that in while. (The Last Voyage of the Demeter in 2023 worked for me.)\n\nRed One\n\nI do not normally watch Christmas movies but the past couple of years I’ve seen some interesting ones, like Krampus, and Violent Night. These are not deep films but they are fun to watch. And this movie actually looks like fun because it has decided to simply lean into every single one of its absurdities, from flying reindeer, to Santa’s security detail, to menacing snowmen. Plus, it’s The Rock. I’m not the biggest fan of The Rock, but he is just funny enough to get me to sit down and watch him act like The Rock, for a couple of hours.\n\nBando Stone and the New World\n\nI genuinely like Donald Glover’s output both musical and dramatic, and this kind of looks like some anxiety provoking fun. I like to think if I laughed during the trailer then the movie can’t be all bad. Although, that has no bearing on whether or not I will see this in the theater. (I probably won’t unless a family member asks me about it.)\n\nYoung Woman and the Sea\n\nAnyone else interested in this little Indie gem? No. Just me. Well, fine then!\n\nHellboy and the Crooked Man\n\nWell, it looks like Hellboy is getting back to its roots of telling a small personal tale. The whole world isn’t at stake or anything. It’s just Hellboy wandering into a bizarre situation and having to fight his way out, this time in 1950s Appalachia. This looks a lot more like Mignola’s artwork in the comic books, although I understand its based on a Richard Corben short story. I though perhaps it would be based on the Effie Colb short, but maybe it isn’t. Either way, I’m intrigued by this smaller, less bombastic version of the franchise.\n\nMegalopolis\n\nAnd last but not least is Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis. I’m really looking forward to seeing this. Several years ago, I got a chance to see Apocalypse Now Redux on the big screen, and it was a real treat. I haven’t seen a movie from Coppola since then that wasn’t on my TV, so I’m looking forward to this and it looks pretty trippy. Trippy is always interesting to me.\n\nHey, its that time again. Time for me to post trailers of movies that I especially like. That doesnt mena I will get a chance to see these movies. I only have so much money and I choose which movies I’m going to see based on how much fun I’m going to have (or how scared I might get if its a Horror movie). Some movies I know I’m going to stream because I want to carefully think about them as I watch them and movie theaters do not allow me to do that.\n\nThis is going to be shocking to some of y’all, but I don’t actually like movie theaters all that much, and it always bothers me when people (usually white men) absolutely insist that the only way to watch a movie is in a dark room with strangers. Some of us have serious anxiety issues, low social batteries, have trouble with loud noises, do not have access to movie theaters that are playing what we want to watch, or just do not have the kind of disposable income that allows us to see everything in IMax. There are other ways to watch things, and quite frankly, the best way for me to watch something is in my very comfortable home, where all my favorite foods are. I’m an advocate for watching a movie however a person feels comfortable watching it. (It also doesn’t hurt to have a massive TV screen, a great soundsystem, and a comfortable easy chair, in my livingroom. Just turn off all the lights and I’m all set.)\n\nAnyway, here’s a short list of movies (and one game) I may be watching in my livingroom this year!\n\nUmbrella Academy Series Finale\n\nI’ve enjoyed this series from the beginning even though I didn’t especially like the graphic novels. The show is “a lot”, but I enjoy spending time with this deeply flawed family, and I’m kind of looking forward to this alternate world fusion that brings together characters from the previous season, called The Sparrow Academy. This airs on Netflix in August.\n\nCuckoo\n\nThis is one of those intriguing little films where I’m not entirely sure if I’m supposed to laugh at it, but this trailer has a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Is it a Horror movie? A Comedy? or a Horror Comedy? I’ll find out sometime in August, when I hope it will be streaming then. I live in a fairly large city but sometimes these little films don’t play here.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance\n\nI love it when a movie simply leans into its own absurdity, and Venom does all of that, and manages to make it look like fun. I also just really like spending time with the the grumbling, crabby, Tom Hardy, and the happily silly Venom.\n\nAlien Romulus\n\nThis movie looks genuinely terrifying, which I fully expect it to be, because I trust Fede Alverez to bring the pain. This is the same guy that brought us one of the scariest Evil Dead movies created in a while, Evil Dead Rising, and that’s saying something from me, because I am generally unimpressed by demonic possession films. Here, Alien Romulus is getting back to its roots, ala the original Ridley Scott film, Alien, and if I get scared just watching the trailer, I’m not sure how I’m gonna handle being in a darkened theater watching it. It might be too much, even for me, a Professional Horror Movie Enthusiast.\n\nKalki 2898\n\nThis is the only Bollywood (Telugu, rather than Hindi and called Tollywood)) film that will probably ever appear on this list. Not because I don’t like Bollywood films, (I think they’re fascinating and I really enjoyed RRR), but becasue I don’t have a whole lot of access to these types of movies outside of streaming platforms, and I’m not always in the mood for musicals. But Bollywood is increasingly getting into SFF films, and since most of them are based on the culture, I’m intrigued despite the singing and dancing, and I’ve already developed crushes on certain actors.\n\nInside Out 2\n\nI have been informed by my niece that we will be seeing this movie next week. I’m not really into Inside Out. I watched the first film and thought it was really cute, but my niece loved it and says she wants to see this. I took my nephew to see Furiosa a week or two ago, and he seemed to enjoy it, although I do not think it was anything like he expected (and it was his first Mad Max movie), but my niece elected not to see it, so I owe her a movie, and this is what she picked. Once again, I think it just looks really cute, but I hope she really likes it.\n\nAssassin’s Creed: Shadows\n\nThis is the only videogame trailer I’ve ever put here and that’s because this new game, from the makers of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, is showcasing one of my all-time favorite Japanese Samurai, Yasuke, the Black (African) Samurai who served under Oda Nobunaga from 1581 to 1582. As is expected, white men showed their whole fool moon ass about the subject online, (it’s the only power move they have left, it seems), but historically, Yasuke was only an outlier regarding his status among the Japanese nobility. It was not entirely uncommon that the Japanese saw Black men, since they came to Japan as slaves of Portuguese missionaries. I’m delighted to see people paying more attention to this character and one day hope to actually get hisstory in a film.\n\nMaXXXine\n\nI only recently saw the movie X, starring Mia Goth. I’m really impressed by Mia (and will watch anything she stars in), but the movie itself wasn’t especially interesting to me. However, the prequel to X, titled Pearl, was awesome, and it’s one of my favorite movies of last year. This looks like a sequel to X, and I’m kind of interested in it, but mostly I just like Ti West’s films, and Mia Goth in particular, plus its Slasher movie. Maxxxine is releasing on July 5th. in theaters.\n\nThe Convert\n\nI’ve been trying to catch any movie that comes out of New Zealand that stars Maori characters and actors, so I’m really looking forward to streaming this at some future date. It came out last year but the US release date is for July 12th. I will not be seeing this one in theaters because it’s not going to be playing anywhere near where I live, and I already have a movie date in July, Deadpool and Wolverine, which looks like a blast. This also looks kinda blasty, but in a historical kind of way, and then there’s the addition of Guy Pearce.\n\nI wrote something similar to this in the past, but I have since thought more on this, and discovered there are quite a few movies I will probably never watch again.\n\nAnd it’s not because these are bad or scary films. It’s because they are very effective in accomplishing the film’s goal, which is mostly causing a lot of discomfort. These are great films, but I’m unlikely to ever watch them again because I got it the first time, or they make me too uncomfortable for them to be a fun watch, they’re just too scary, even for me, (and I’m what I like to call a professional Horror movie watcher), or I have to really be in a very special mood to do so.\n\nSo here, in no particular order, are a bunch of really good films, that I never want or need to watch again!\n\nGet Out\n\nThis is one of those movies that is very, very good, but I had a hard time getting through it the first time. I did like it, but I cannot watch it again, because I got it the first time, and because as a Black woman who has been in a lot of spaces with only white people, it hits just a little too close to home. I see myself in Chris (not the Sunken Place stuff, although that hits pretty hard too, because I’ve been there), but just his general attitude, his bemusement at everyone’s behavior, his wariness, and patience, in a space that isn’t made for you, and makes you feel distinctly uncomfortable, as you wait anxiously for someone to misbehave towards you.\n\nSome of the things that get said to Chris, I’ve actually heard from white people, who meant well, thought they were my friends, and weren’t even trying to hurt me, yet nevertheless, was wrong enough to make me deeply uncomfortable (and not trust them). It is ironic that in their efforts to make me feel more comfortable they ended up accomplishing the exact opposite. Of course, in the movie, Chris is right not to trust his girlfriend’s family, but if I’d seen this movie thirty years ago, I would have been deeply paranoid about visiting the homes of my white friends!\n\nOn the other hand, I do love Jordan Peele’s movies, I’ve watched Nope about five thousand times, and enjoyed it every time I’ve seen it. That is my version of scary but fun, but I think Us can probably be added to this particular list, too. I genuinely really liked it, but there are parts of it that are too scary, and weird, and uncomfortable for me to make a habit of viewing it multiple times. Then again, I’ve watched it exactly twice. I have to be in a real mood to re-watch this again.\n\nSpeak No Evil\n\nOh my lawd!!! but this is one of the most infuriating movies I have ever watched in my life, and I think that was probably the point! I think, at one point, I was screaming at my TV. The is a Finnish or Danish film (I’m not sure which) about a couple of couples that meet while on vacation. One of the couples invites the other to visit them at their home, and the other couple takes them up on their offer. The first couple proceeds to cross every single one of the other’s personal boundaries, without so much as a peep from the second couple, until, by the time of its tragic, yet inevitable end, I was rooting for the two villains. (Not really! They were utterly detestable people.)\n\nIt’s not that I didn’t understand the point of the film, but it’s one of those movies that make you ask, during every single minute of it, what would you do under these circumstances. (I know what I would do because I’ve done it before.) The second couple is so passive, so willing to please, avoid any kind of confrontation, and go along to get along, that they just walk right into the horrible events that happen to them later, and they do so without a word of protest, just as they’ve lived their entire lives. At one point, they actually do make an attempt to escape their fate, but turn around and walk right back into it, because the two of them are people pleasers, who want to be “polite”, and its their complete inability to speak out against anything (Speak No Evil) that seals their doom.\n\nI am a loudmouth who will speak out about anything. I’m Black, and a woman, and I have learned the hard way that I cannot afford to be silent, or people will very happily tell my who I am, supposed to be, or just walk all over me. I have learned that I need to control the narrative of me, and to never allow anyone to become a habitual line-stepper without saying something to them. I was even like that as a child, because I remember being perfectly willing to give even my extended, adult, family members the sharp end of my tongue. I wasn’t mean about it, but I let ’em know. My family just got used to it since I learned that behavior from them! So you can imagine the amount of rage I was feeling at these two grown-ass, seemingly adult human beings, in this movie, who absolutely refused to say anything in defense of themselves, as their boundaries got crossed again, and again, and again. They are the kind of people you want to just slap the living piss out of, not because you hate them, or desire to hurt them, but because you actually like them, and are desperate to wake them up, to save their lives.\n\nI didn’t hate this movie, though. It’s very effective, and the plot is well set up, but it came close to being heavily disliked. I even liked the two main characters but their behavior is infuriating, and their fate, when predators finally catch up to them, was absolutely inevitable.\n\nHereditary\n\nI’m pretty sure this one was on my last list of movies I won’t be watching again, but I’m gonna list it here anyway. I really did like this film. It has some very effective scares in it but it is also incredibly bleak. This is another movie with an inevitable end, where the characters have lost the fight before the movie even started. Not fun-bleak like The Mist, with all of its many creatures, but depressing-scary-bleak. This movie was very good, too good, but not what I would ever consider fun. Its very well made, and well plotted, and the acting is top-notch, and really cemented my utmost respect for Toni Collette, who was simply awesome. By all accounts, it really is the kind of film one could re-watch, but I don’t think I will, or if I do, it will be at some far point in the future, when I’m in a mood.\n\nThe movie deals with themes of generational trauma, evil legacies, and the awful plans of one’s ancestors. It’s not until the end of the movie that you realize that not only did the monster win, but that this family never even stood a chance of winning against it from the word GO. From it’s opening scene to its last, every move this family makes to save themselves and each other is simply doomed, and that was just too much for me.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies\n\nThis movie was just depressing. It is not the kind of movie that gets re-watched. I realize that was the point, because it is about Japan during the war, but that’s not the only thing. Some of the imagery is pretty horrifying. I don’t think I’m ever going to be in a “mood” to watch this ever again. I watched it the first time because a lot of people kept mentioning it as something a person should watch at least once. I did.\n\nOnce was enough.\n\nBanshees of Inisherrin\n\nThis movie made me cry, but in a good way. It’s a great movie, but one of the reasons I won’t watch it again is I think I identified just a bit too much with the lead characters. Its a good example of how personal some movies are. The movie stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason, as close friends, Colm and Padraic, who live on an isolated location, off the coast of Ireland. It all starts when Colm tells Padraic that he no longer wants to be friends with him. Colin’s character, not wanting to be alone, or give up the long term friendship, and having not been given any reason for this sudden shift, simply ignores this request, which starts a feud between the two of them, to the point where Colm threatens self harm if Padric talks to him.\n\nOn a certain level, the movie is deeply, and darkly, funny because the situation devolves into chopped off fingers, burnt houses, and dead animals. I identified with Gleason’s character, Colm, wanting change so badly, wanting his life to be meaningful, and just different than it is, that he was willing to do almost anything. He wants change and meaning in his life, of some kind, but he also doesn’t want either of them to go on doing exactly what the two of them have been doing, for the rest of their lives, on this little island, so he essentially tries to blow up his life, which is something I’ve done myself when I was feeling trapped by my circumstances and needed a change.\n\nColm also thinks Padraic’s best decision would be to leave their truncated and limited life on the island, and go do something meaningful with his life, but he knows Colin’s character won’t ever leave without him, so he thinks he’s setting him free by ending their friendship. But Padraic is okay with the way things are, just wants things to go on the way they always have, and doesn’t want all this drama that Colm has started.\n\nThis is a very uncomfortable movie to watch because there’s so much tension of laughing at these characters but completely understanding the characters. I only needed to watch this once becasue I got it. I liked the film just fine, and it is mildly enjoyable, but I don’t need or want to “get it” again.\n\n12 Years A Slave/American History X\n\nI know all I need to know about the atrocities of slavery and racism, having been inundated with movies, books, and TV series about the subject all my life. I’m just tired of watching these types of movies, and being told, every time one of these movies gets made, that its the most important movie of whatever time period, and I should see it. No, I do not!\n\nI’m a middle-aged Black woman, who has seen all the Slave movies I’m ever going to see. The Hollywood Film Industry is absolutely fascinated with the spectacle of Black pain and degradation, as well as white male redemption arc as aided by the Black people who forgive them, and I’m not fascinated by any of it. I absolutely refuse to watch any more of them! and what’s more, I don’t need to.\n\nQuite frankly, I didn’t need or want to watch either of these movies the first time. I don’t think I got thirty minutes into 12 Years A Slave. There are some movies you just know are going to totally piss you off, so you have to be in some kind of mood to watch it in the first place. Like Grave of the Fireflies, I kind of regret having lost even thirty minutes of my life to it.\n\nAmerican History X, I watched on the strength of Edward Norton’s acting. It’s not a bad film at all and was rather uplifting because of its redemption arc, but there’s no need to subject myself to it again. I know all I kneed to know about that movie.\n\nThe Revenant\n\nI think I mentioned this movie once before. This movie is so harrowing to watch, that I was exhausted by the end of it. I don’t know if it’s because the whole movie takes place in a wintry environment, or if its because of the events that happen in it, but I was tired.\n\nThe movie is based on a true story about a trapper who is betrayed by his “friends” and left for dead in the wilderness when they go back to town and tell the authorities he’s dead. He spends the rest of the movie trying to survive the wilderness, and get back home. One of the most exhausting and terrifying events is watching him get attacked by a bear. This scene seemingly lasts forever. I get that these events speak to the determination and fortitude of his character, but I guess I don’t have enough fortitude to watch this movie again.\n\nParasite\n\nI really liked this film because it had some interesting revelations in the plot, but the movie is deeply depressing. I only needed to watch it one time, but I really did like it, and I wanted to keep engaging with it, so I read everything about it I could find, and watched a bunch of analysis videos.\n\nI was so intrigued by what Bong Joon Ho was trying to tell the audience, I watched several of his interviews. I couldn’t stop thinking about it long after the movie was over, and it still sits on my favorites lists, but I won’t watch this again. This is a darkly comic movie about a poor Korean family (so poor that they live in a kind of apartment half basement) that take to grifting a wealthy family (who live in a high rise house on a hill) so they can get out of poverty. There are parts of the movie that are deeply funny, because events are so exaggerated, that it just skirts the edge of ridiculous. The ending is sad and tragic and hopeless. I wasn’t looking for a happy ending but the end of this movie haunted me on a level I wasn’t expecting.\n\nI got it. I don’t need to watch this again, but that doesn’t actually mean I won’t!\n\nSkinamarink\n\nHoo boy! Okay, this is one of the rare films that is too scary even for me, not because it has some creature in it I’m scared of, but because it sits too close to home some things I was scared of as a child, even though these things didn’t happen to me. Apparently, this movie hit a nerve with a lot of people, especially those who understood it. Some people just thought it was boring, but the people who were frightened by it said it reminded them of certain childhood fears they thought they’d long forgotten about.\n\nThere is the idea of children being put in a dangerous situation, so if that’s something you can’t tolerate this may not be the film for you. Two very young siblings (I think they are like 5 or 6), named Kevin and Kaylee, wake up one night to find themselves alone in the house, their mom and dad are missing, there are no doors or windows, and their toys and other objects in the house keep being moved around. The movie mostly consists of the two of them trying to survive on their own, and make the best of things. The story is told with the Found Footage style, and at no point do you see the faces of any of the characters. The story gets worse when Kaylee eventually disappears, and audiences have all kinds of dark theories about what’s actually happening in the film.\n\nI’m not saying this movie works for everyone. Your mileage may vary. But it did work for me and only because the movie showed some of my worst childhood fears. If you don’t have those kinds of fears then the movie will probably just be nonsensical to you. I thought it was so effective that I simply didn’t want or need to watch it more than one time, although, like Parasite, I found it fascinating enough to research as much of it as I could, because I wanted to know what the director, Edward Ball, was thinking when he made it.\n\nHey y’all, this is gonna be a great year for horror movies! I can feel it. First, there aren’t too many tentpole superhero movies being released this year, and I’ve been seeing some very interesting Horror trailers, not just for streaming, but in theaters as well. I think we might even see a few surprise hits, too.\n\nHere’s my list of my most hotly anticipated Horror movies. The movies at the top of my list are streaming films on Amazon, Netflix, Shudder, and AMC. The second will be movies that I believe are being released in theaters. The last part of the list will be movies I’m not too hot to see but y’all might be interested in checking out. There’s also a small list of movies that sound interesting that I do not have trailers for.\n\nStreaming\n\nThe Animal Kingdom\n\nI don’t know if this is scary but the trailer makes it look really intriguing and that seems to be enough to capture my interest I guess. It is currently not streaming anywhere but I will keep an eye out for it and let you know who has it and when.\n\nParasyte: The Grey\n\nI watched the entire anime series and loved it, so I’m willing to check this out. The flavor of this movie is a little different than the cartoon, because it seems a lot more serious. This is more of a straight up Alien Invasion Horror movie, whereas the anime had a lot more humor, and the protagonist is now a woman. I’m okay with that. They definitely kept all the gore, which I can appreciate. This seems more like a story set in the same universe than a remake of the anime series. I think this is streaming on Netflix on April 5th.\n\nInfested\n\nFor some reason we are getting giant spider movies this year, and although I’m deeply arachnophobic, I’m on board with that. This also looks like fun and reminds me of a cross between Eight Legged Freaks and Tremors. I would never watch such a film in a dark theater though, because when I get creeped out at home, I can turn it off, and it won’t be a waste of my money to never look at it again! I like that more PoC are being seen in Horror movies these days, although it is impossible for me to tell if this movie is American or what. It sounds like everyone is speaking French though. Its streaming on AMC+ on April 26th.\n\nLate Night With the Devil\n\nI’m a huge David Dastmalchian fan, so I’m very eager to see him put his shit down in this movie, where he is the primary character, rather than a side character who gets knocked off. I’m not too keen on possession films, in general, but the premise of this sounds kind of interesting. It will be streaming on AMC/Shudder on March 26th, and April 19th.\n\nOut of Darkness\n\nI’m always up for some Historically based Horror movies, and the setting for this is rather unique. I’m going to check this out and get to y’all on it. This can be rented on Amazon Prime. AppleTV, and Vudu today!\n\nFrom Black\n\nI was not impressed by the trailer, but I did get to see a small clip of one little scene in this movie, and now I’m all in. That scene was genuinely scary so now I have to know what happened. This movie is not going to skimp on the gore either, I can tell you that. This is streaming on Amazon/Shudder today.\n\nHandling the Undead\n\nFrom time to time someone will make a more thoughtful and introspective Zombie movie and I like those. This movie was written by the same guy who wrote Let the Right One In, and I have read it. The book was rather melancholy and the movie seems to have captured some of that same flavor. I’m intrigued. So technically ,this is a 2023 movie that will see a US release this year, and is available on AppleTV, although that is not where I’ll be watching it.\n\nIn Theaters\n\nSting\n\nThis is the other giant spider movie released this year. Unlike the previous film, where I wasn’t entirely sure, this one is definitely supposed to be a comedy. I’m not sure this is a theatrical release or streaming but its coming on April 12th.\n\nLovely Dark and Deep\n\nThis movie looks good and creepy. I can probably take a guess at what it’s about but that’s not going to stop me from looking at it. This is one of those movies I’m not certain is playing in theaters, but I’ve heard it came out on VOD in February.\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One\n\nI love the Quiet Place movies, so I’m really excited to check this one out. This is coming to theaters on June 28th.\n\nThe Watchers\n\nI don’t know much about this movie, even after watching the trailer a couple of times, but I like the lead actress and it looks pretty creepy. This is being released on June14th.\n\nAlien Romulus\n\nI have not been able to find a single trailer for this movie that I trust is a real trailer. There probably isnt one yet but I’m gonna leave this here even though I’m not as enthusiastic about this movie as some of the other films on this list.\n\nI’m not excited to see this exactly, but it is a new film in the Alien franchise, so that arouses my curiosity even if the movie turns out to be waste of my time. I was under the impression this was streaming on Hulu but I’ve also heard its playing in theaters. I don’t know. The date I have for this is August 16th.\n\nNosferatu\n\nThis is another movie I’m very enthusiastic to see later this year. I’m a big Robert Eggers fan, and I liked the original, so I really want to see what he does with this remake of the 1922 version. The release date is December 25th and we don’t got no trailer for this one yet.\n\nOf Note:\n\nMystery Film from M. Night Shyamalan – No one has anything on this one, not even a trailer.\n\nMystery Film by Jordan Peele – I’m always excited to hear that Jordan Peel is working on something. He is also the Producer behind Dev Patel’s new Action film, Monkey Man.\n\nWinnie the Pooh 2 – I’m not into Slasher style movies really but the idea behind this is novel. Maybe some day in the future I may be in the mood to watch this, but not now.\n\nImaginary – This doesn’t look especially scary to me, but I’m sure its up someone’s alley, as its being heavily promoted on YouTube.\n\nThe First Omen – Nah. You cannot improve on the first movie, which was perfection.\n\nThe Strangers – I’m mostly not a fan of Home Invasion movies, but a lot of people really liked the first movie which is why we’re getting a sequel. I don’t hate these types of movies, they’re simply not to my taste.\n\nSpeak No Evil – I saw the original movie on which this was based and that movie frustrated me to no end! I mostly just felt like slapping the holy crap out of most of the characters, since I always have my mouth opne to say something, but the plot hinged very heavily on the idea of people not talking when they should have, in other words “speaking no evil”. I do wonder how the creators are going to change this remake to fit an American aesthetic, because most Americans have no problem speaking their minds.\n\nTerrifier – I’m not that into killer clowns, and this movie seems to be more about spectacle than message, which I do not find attractive. But somebody out there likes it, so they made a second one. There’s a Horror movie to fit every kind of taste.\n\nSmile 2 – I didn’t watch the first movie even though I heard from a lot of people that it’s pretty good. Someday I’ll get around to watching both of these.\n\nReturn to Silent Hill – I was not impressed by any of the Silent Hill movies that showed up after the first film. Shockingly, I have actually played the first iteration of the game, which made me reach the conclusion that Horror games are not for me!\n\nOut Come the Wolves – I know nothing about this movie beyond the basic synopsis that its a about a group of people being attacked by a pack of wolves.\n\nDust Bunny – The basic plot is that a little girl teams up with some kind of hunter to kill the monster that lives under her bed, which she thinks ate her family. I have no trailer, but this sounds interesting. I hope its a comedy.\n\nLater this month I’ll be posting stories about the different types of new Horror available to partake of online, and new Horror authors I’ve been reading the last few years! Stephen King has some real competition out there, or at least a new successor.\n\nAlright guys, I’m about to kick off my favorite month of the year – Spookytober – with a scary little list of the monsters that scared the bejeebus out of me. I’ve listed favorite monsters a couple of times on this blog, but this is really the first time I’ve listed monsters And as a consequence the movies) I don’t watch very often because they are genuinely terrifying to me. Your mileage may vary, of course, because Horror is subjective and depends almost entirely on the mindset of the individual involved.\n\nNow there are a helluva lot of scary movies out there and there’s a few that didn’t make this list but are terrifying just because they’re terrifying. What you will notice that’s absent from this list are the more traditional monsters like vampires and werewolves, and it’s not that I don’t find some of them scary, but there really aren’t enough vampires that are scare me, for example, to make a ten item list. This list focuses on Creature Features, but there’s whole other list to be made for Supernatural and Slasher films, and I might list those later, but here goes: The Most Terrifying Monsters in Horror.\n\nHe Who Kills From Trilogy of Terror\n\nNow the other monsters are not in any particular order but I had to bring this guy in at number one because this was truly the very first monster that actually scared the bricks out of me (and quite frankly he works pretty good at it today). There’s a reason I’ve only watched this movie about three or four times in the last thirty years. I read the short story its based on Prey by Richard Matheson about the same number of times because the movies is extremely faithful to the story. One of the more interesting aspects of this monster is that looked at under the correct light it is deeply funny. I mean, it is just a puppet and you might laugh at it for about five minutes, but by the end of the movie he is a lot less funny, because the movie is filled with some genuinely suspenseful moments.\n\nI first saw this movie late at night when I was supposed to be asleep, and waaay too young to be looking at it, which may be the reason I now have “doll fear”. Now, I didn’t fear my own “plastic” dolls. I got along fine with them, so this wasn’t a hard and fast rule, but this movie definitely contributed to my general fear of wooden puppets, ventriloquist dummies, mannequins, and other humanoid shaped wooden objects that are not supposed to be moving, but are kinda doing that anyway. So yeah, Chucky, Pinocchio, a few of those Japanese puppets, the creature from the 2016 movie, The Boy, and that puppet from the 1978 Anthony Hopkins movie, Magic, they can all catch some of this smoke.\n\nThe Xenomorph from Alien\n\nI remember seeing the first trailer for this movie when I was about nine or ten years old and being very excited about it. The trailer was immediately intriguing to me because it was dark and ominous and told you absolutely nothing at all about the movie. I loved it! And then, when that Summer passed, I kinda forgot about it, until I watched the movie for the first time on late night TV when I was about fourteen, and y’all, I was not ready! Since the trailer didn’t really tell you anything, I had no idea what to expect. Talk about sitting on the edge of your seat!\n\nI was following along with this movie just fine and it was alright, until the last fifteen minutes. I will not spoil it for those of you too young to have watched it yet, but that last scene contains what is possibly one of the greatest jump scares in film history and cemented the Xenomorph as one of the most terrifying monsters in Horror for me.\n\nThe H-Man 1958\n\nI won’t list the original Blob because while that movie was definitely disgusting, it was also kind of funny. The H-Man makes this list because I’ve been terrified of watching this movie ever since I first saw it. I’ve told you about my issues watching acidic, sentient snot devouring people alive and this movie is probably the reason why. I’m serious. Like quicksand, this is an actual problem! In japan this movie is called Beauty and the Liquid People, a very poetic name for what is probably one of the ickiest movies I’ve ever watched. The only other movie about acidic slime that maybe tops this one is the remake of The Blob made in 1987, and while that movie is certainly disgusting, its also kind of fun. This movie wasn’t fun. There’s nothing in this movie that’s played for laughs.\n\nI think I’ve watched this movie about two and a half times over forty years. The last time I tried watching this was about three years ago, and I had to stop, because it was the middle of the night when it aired, and it totally creeped me the hell out so badly, I had to stop! I mean this movie literally makes my skin feel crawly! Yes, I had a hard time falling asleep with the lights on.\n\nThe Thing of The Thing\n\nIt’s not that the monster isn’t scary, but more the idea of the monster is what’s so terrifying. It’s this idea that the monster can look, act, and sound exactly like someone close to you, that you’ve been living in close quarters with, and that its mimicry is so good, that you literally cannot tell the difference between it and someone you think you’ve known for months, is what contributes so well to the movie’s feelings of dread and paranoia. For the first thirty minutes of the movie the monster is only ever referenced, and not shown, but once it does show up, its worth the wait, because Carpenter does a righteous job of its depiction.\n\nThe mood of this movie is incredible. In fact, the 1982 remake of The Thing is sometimes referred to as a perfect Horror movie, which despite its age, has not done badly. The monster, the practical effects, the environment, the cinematography, and characters, all still hold up very well over thirty years later.\n\nThe Medusa from Clash of the Titans\n\nSo, for comparison I watched the Clash of the Titans remake and let’s just say I was less than whelmed by the remake’s depiction of the Medusa. I mean she was alright, and she definitely had them bow and arrow skills but there’s just something about the original Harryhausen version that is both terrifying and wonderful. There’s something about the stop motion that lends itself well to her character that didn’t work well with the computer generated version in the remake. Also the remake decided to make the Medusa conventionally attractive, which is faithful to the original story, but is not scary.\n\nPart of the reason this Medusa is frightening is the general mood and environment, and we can’t forget the novelty of having seen her for the first time. The low lighting and frozen bodies with their terrified expressions, and her disregard as she knocks them over during her pursuit, is simply disturbing. There’s also her facial expressions. She doesn’t just look angry or mean but a little melancholy. She is one of my favorite monsters and I keep imagining what it would be like to encounter such a being. Let’s face it, it would be terrifying!\n\nJean Jacket from Nope\n\nOne of the most terrifying things about the monster from Nope is that it appears more or less harmless ,and turns out to be anything but that. Part of the reason Jean Jacket so terrifying is its general demeanor. It’s really fast moving, and stealthy, and there are things about it that are just a complete mystery. We think its an alien because it resembles stories we’ve been telling ourselves about aliens, (and that attitude is what gets most of the people in the movie killed) but we don’t actually know what it is, where it came from, what its going to do next, how smart it is, or even its purpose.\n\nThere are somethings Jean Jacket does in the movie that are just puzzling and we can’t make any sense out of, like the rain of blood, or the final threat display that shows what it actually looks like. There’s a lot of conjecture among fans about this. So a large part of the terror of this monster is all the things we simply don’t know about it and I’m glad Peele didn’t bother to try to explain.\n\nThe Grey Widowers from The Mist\n\nI think I mentioned before that along with “Doll Fear” I also have “Spider Fear”, its not as bad as when I was younger. I can at least look at them in movies, but these guys are simply horrifying because of their size, acidic webbing, and near human faces. These guys are inhabitants of one of the greatest monster movies ever made (simply because of the sheer number of horrors in it), Frank Darabont’s 2007 Stephen King adaptation of The Mist. I mean, I don’t like spiders because they’re bad enough at the size they are in the Amazon, but these guys spit acidic webbing! WHY?!!! Why would anyone think of that?!\n\nIf you are a fan of Creature Features than this is definitely the movie for you because it has all kinds of great, barely glimpsed, monsters strutting around in the Mist, devouring and chopping up various people who insist on running out into it. There’s the Giant Lobster creature that haunts a parking lot, and the giant mosquito creatures with poisonous venom, and the extra giant sized Kaiju… okay, lets face it, most of the monsters are of enormous size, but still I very much suspect that the Grey Widowers, as they are called by the film’s creators, are the top dogs in this monster ecosystem. I think one of the saddest scenes in the movie is when the lead characters drive past an overturned bus containing the desiccated bodies of school children. Darabont has no problem killing children in this movie, and this also makes The Mist one of the saddest and most shocking Horror movies of the 21st century.\n\nThe Entity from It Follows\n\nI wrote two whole essays about the meaning of the invisible entity that stalks the lead character in this movie becasue there is a lot deeper stuff going on here than the surface plot of an STD monster that stalks and kills people. There are some very concrete reasons why the monster does what it does, and appears the way it appears in the movie. The entity here has some of the same issues that came up for The Thing. It can look like anyone, including people you know, and the victims wouldn’t know that it was dangerous to them unless they’d either been forewarned, or the person it was imitating was standing right next to them. In one instance in the film, a victim was warned, and still wasn’t ready when it attacked him.\n\nMy theory was that the monster shows up as personifications of the things its victims either fear the most (like rape, or growing old), or have the most anxiety about (their relationships with friends and family), and that the longer it tracks its victims it starts to attune itself to their very specific fears, which is why it will show up looking like their mother or their best friend, especially if they have any lowkey anxieties about them. What forms the monster takes can tell us a lot about the victim, and I thought that was kinda terrifying in an existential type of way.\n\nPennywise (from the It remake)\n\nOkay, this entire movie (both parts) was simply deliciously terrifying and kind of awesome. I liked this movie far more than I enjoyed the original movie, which for me was simply meh! I am usually not impressed with remakes, and I was prepared not to like this, but after some thought and a couple of re-watches, I have to admit, this movie was very good, and part of the reason for that is the attention to detail of the monster and our care for the characters. Pennywise is actually very well done and very scary, and I like that his presence is often preceded by the appearance of a red balloon. I distinctly remember reading the original story by Stephen King, and being captivated by the opening scene of the clown in the sewer, and this terrifying scene was wonderfully depicted in this film, almost exactly the way I imagined it.\n\nThe monster is genuinely scary in all of its incarnations, but most especially in the second half of of the movie when it keeps showing up in various spider forms. It also doesn’t hurt that I actually cared about the characters and either rooted for them or condemned them based on their actions.\n\nNormally, I would add a bonus round right here, but I think I’m going to start a new post. Next time my focus will be on the Scariest Traditional Monster films like werewolves and vampires and stuff. I think that’s with a look and allow me to expand this list of most terrifying monsters in Horror Cinema.\n\nThere Was A Lot of Good Stuff This Year\n\nZom 100 (Netflix)\n\nThis is the live action version of the anime that’s currently playing on Netflix. I watched the anime version of this too but I prefer this version. It has the same basic plot as the anime, with little extras added, and I thought, more likable characters.\n\nAkira Tendo is a much put upon and bullied office worker who works too much overtime, never takes vacations, and almost never has any time for himself. He’s bullied by his boss, is in an unrequited love with his female coworker, and generally hates going to work, but then his good fortune comes in the form of a zombie apocalypse. He sees this as a grand opportunity to complete a bucket list of activities before he succumbs to being a zombie.\n\nHe makes a list of all the things he’s always wanted to do and wished he could once do, and sets about actually fulfilling the list. He starts off with relatively easy things like cleaning his apartment, rooftop camping with steaks and fries, lazing around the house drinking beer, and shooting off some fireworks.\n\nWhile out re-upping on beer he meets a bad ass zombie fighting girl he attaches himself to, and the two of them go off to save an old friend of Akira’s with whom he had a falling out after college. Apologizing to his best friend was one of the items on his bucket list, and his friend is so touched by this that becomes one of Akira’s biggest cheerleaders.\n\nI really liked the relationships between these three characters, which thankfully DOES NOT become a love triangle. They’re just friends who care about each other. I also liked how the other two characters decided to join Akira on his bucket list quest, cheer him on, and even add their own wishes to the list. I was surprised that the list wasn’t already finished though. Akira doesn’t have a hundred items, and he and his friends would think of something they hadn’t done yet, and just add it to the list. Sometimes they would get the activity done, like driving an RV to the ocean, or being a superhero for a day, but the list started with only about ten items and by the end of the 2 hour movie there are only about 18 items.\n\nNow, this zombie apocalypse is mostly played for laughs. The zombies are fast when they need to be, or conveniently slow whenever the characters need to pause and say a few lines, like when Akira encounters his first zombie hoard, and they’re chasing him quite quickly, until he needs to stop and reflect for a moment while they make sure to pause or fall down in the background. Yes, the zombies are dangerous but only when the plot requires them to be. So while occasionally Akira seems as if he might be in danger of being bitten he’s mostly safe. The movie is a comedy after all.\n\nUnlike in the anime, Akira’s character arc mostly involves standing up to his bullying boss, whom he encounters later in the film, (and he has seemingly bullied an entire crew of people to work for him during the apocalypse), and gaining the confidence to save his coworkers from him and a great white zombie landshark, which is terrifying, utterly disgusting, and still deeply funny!\n\nI really liked this movie, and hope there’s a sequel, because Akira and his friends weren’t anywhere near a hundred items on the bucket list and were basically making it up as they went along. This is not even remotely a serious movie, and I had quite a lot of fun, cheering Akira and his friends in their ridiculous adventures.\n\nSpiderman: Across the Spiderverse (In Theaters)\n\nI saw this with my niece and nephew when it was released because we are both huge Spiderman fans. Now, I’m more of a classic Peter Parker fan because that’s the Spiderman I grew up with, but Miles Morales has really grown on me. I like him a lot and I enjoyed this movie, even though it’s only the first part of a duo or trilogy.\n\nSince I’m an art nerd, I paid really close attention to the various artistic styles used in the animation and I LOVED IT! Every prominent Spiderman gets an artistic style that reflects their nature. The Indian Spiderman gets really bright red and gold sari-like colors and a smooth drawing style. SpiderGwen gets some soft pastel pinks and blues which are often reflected in her environment and shows her moods, which I thought was a neat subtle trick. There’s the primary villain (who is a result of decisions Miles made during the first movie), who gets a chaotic black and white, polka dot, drawing style, as befitting his character, and another minor villain reflects an old school Leonardo DaVinci style (in keeping with that character’s personal philosophies about what is and isn’t art), and all these different styles just had me sitting there with a big silly grin!\n\nBut the plot doesn’t slack either, as it’s not all style with no substance, and the story successfully juggles a couple of narrative messages. If the first movie was about Miles taking that leap of faith and owning up to being Spiderman, this second film is about his full acceptance of his Spider Identity, what kind of Spiderman he wants to become, and trying to escape the league of Spidermen who have decided he is not worthy since it turns out that this version of Miles was never meant to be Spiderman.\n\nIn deciding what type of Spiderman he wants to be, we get to meet a lot of great Spidermen, some of which I knew from the comic books, including some great cameos from Spidercat, Spiderhorse, and a holographic Spidergirl of the future. But my all-time favorite character was the English Spiderpunk, Hobie Brown, (I also read those comics a long time ago) with the Indian Spiderman (Pavitr) running behind him at a very, very, close pace! I loved these two characters even more than the ones from the first movie, and it’s hard as hell to top Nicholas Cage as Spiderman Noir (Yes, I still want a Spiderman Noir movie.) There’s also Miguel O’Hara as Spiderman 2099, who I distinctly remember from the comics, and a very pregnant, Black version of Jessica Drew, who is also from the comic books. Classic Peter Parker also shows up and we get to meet his babygirl, MayDay Parker, (who got them spiderskills just like her daddy!)\n\nOkay, I better zip it up before I give the whole plot away, but heads up! the lowkey MVP of the entire movie, is Spiderpunk! Pay close attention to everything he says and does, which is easy because, even though he only gets about five minutes of screen time, and Billy Idol sneer aside, he’s easily the funniest, coolest, and realest Spiderman to ever grace a movie screen!\n\nThis movie was so much fun, and not just because of the cameos, but the plot had plenty of little twists and turns, and the film’s message echoed some of the messaging I saw in The Flash movie, (about saving everyone) and I cannot wait to see its conclusion next year.\n\nLast Voyage of the Demeter (In Theaters)\n\nI was really looking forward to this as I said in a post earlier this year and I think it was worth the wait. I cannot say it was an enjoyable film because that would imply that it didn’t scare the pants off me, which is, of course, exactly what I wanted it to do. I really got invested, and I considered it worth both my time and money.\n\nNow, the clearest description I’ve heard of this movie is it’s basically Alien At Sea. This is a classic old school creature feature, with lots of practical effects and an incredible star turn by the Spanish actor Javier Botet, who I’d never heard of, but apparently I’ve been watching him in a lot of monster movies.\n\nThis is the OG Dracula in attendance here. If you walk into this expecting the Dracula from any number of romance-adjacent movies of the past thirty years, you’re gonna be disappointed. This Dracula barely speaks. He kills, slashes, stalks, flies, and skulks, but he doesn’t talk. He’s a monster and a disease. This is not the suave, well spoken, sophisticated gentleman that you’re used to seeing.\n\nI’ve read Dracula multiple times over the years. It’s one of my favorite novels, and the Voyage of the Demeter is one of the early chapters of the book, chronicling Dracula’s journey from Transylvania to London, as told in the Captain’s log, and this version of Dracula is as described in the book. The director remained as faithful as possible to the chapter and the plot is fairly simple. Just like the movie Alien, there’s something on the ship, picking off the crew one by one, and discovering what the monster is and fighting it, is the bulk of the movie. This isn’t just a retread of the Alien movie, although there are some formulaic parallels in keeping with this type of film.\n\nThe mood of the film is exactly as it should be to induce maximum dread, even though you know more about what’s happening than the crew. I could’ve done without a few of the convenient thunderstorms that popped up whenever Dracula was on the move because it made things hard to see at times. I was rooting for the crew though, and the Black character, Clemson, who is the primary, is a made up character just for the movie.\n\nThat there is a setup for a possible sequel is mildly annoying, but to be honest, I wouldn’t mind seeing another more accurate version of the rest of the book. Coppola’s 1992 Bram Stoker’s Dracula is about as close as Hollywood has ever gotten to actually filming the book, and it still has never been topped. I don’t expect a sequel to do that, but I would watch a straight up Horror version of Dracula, that’s a mashup of 30 Days of Night and Aliens!\n\nThe Last Of Us (HBO/Max)\n\nLet me confess, I’ve never played the videogame this series is based on. I’ve heard a lot about how good it is, and I’ve watched a few videos that explain the monsters in it, so I didn’t exactly walk into this series blind. I knew who the two primary characters were and what the goal was. I can say that you do not need to have played the videogame to understand or like this series. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Based on reviews of those who have played the game it is faithful enough to be worth watching but has enough depth and story explanation to be satisfying for those who haven’t.\n\nThe basic premise is that humanity has been overcome with zombie-like creatures that infect human beings through a fungal infection based on the real world Cordyceps infection. Like a lot of zombie adjacent movies and series, there is more than enough body horror to satisfy even the most jaded Horror movie fan, the special effects are excellent, and there is plenty of action and pathos. Once again though, what captured and kept me interested were the characters, and thankfully that’s where most of the focus is.\n\nJoel is a burnt out survivor who finds it hard to get close to others after losing his daughter during the pandemic outbreak, and Ellie is a young girl who is seemingly immune to the virus, that he must escort to a medical facility to determine if there is a cure. In other words, this is your standard zombie road trip movie where people need to travel somewhere or accomplish some goal at the end of the world. Where it excels is in the writing and character. There are certain things expected to happen because we’ve seen this type of plot dozens of times, especially if you enjoy zombie (and zombie-adjacent) movies and shows, but there are also more than a few unexpected gems that make the series more than award-worthy.\n\nFor me and a lot of other critics, the outstanding episode was #3, Long Long Time, not least because the title is one of my favorite Linda Ronstadt songs. It isn’t often that a show about zombies makes me cry but as I said this is where this series excels. I got deeply invested in two characters who, while they were peripheral to the story in the game, are fully fleshed out here, and done in such a way that they didn’t feel like token or tragic characters, and their storyline added to the overall theme of the show. I consider this particular episode one of the finest hours of television I watched this year. It stars Nick Offerman as Bill, and Murray Bartlett as Frank, as the gay couple from the game, in an episode that is universally hailed as the series greatest.\n\nBut the show doesn’t stop there. There are many beautiful moments within the season that made me sit up and take notice. Another of my favorite episodes is the one where Ellie falls in love. Some of my favorite scenes simply show Ellie and Joel walking and talking to each other, including one where he and Ellie feed a pack of giraffes they encounter in Central Park!\n\nI think there is definitely going to be a season two, since so many people seemed to enjoy this, and there is a part two to the game, although the focus there isnt Joel, but Ellie and her adventures. I always hesitate to say something is fun when it made me cry, or scared the bejeezus out of me, but this actually was fun to watch, since it did for me exactly what it promised.\n\nNext Up: More Summer Movies I Loved\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever talked about this here! That’s incredible! I’ve talked about my favorite movies and monsters, examined various landscapes and talked about language, sound editing, and symbolic imagery, but I don’t think I’ve ever talked about the things about horror movies that make me angry, exasperated, or are a complete turnoff if I all I do is see it in the trailer.\n\nHere, in no particular order are the tropes I’m tired of seeing, the most annoying types of characters, and the kinds of events that are a complete turnoff when watching any type of Horror movie.\n\n1. The Unprepared Hiker\n\nI absolutely cannot stand it when I see Hikers in Horror movies who are woefully unprepared for walking around in the middle of no and where. I’m not even talking about phones. I’m talking about basic shit like a compass and a map! We never see any of these future lost bodies consulting maps or using a compass, or hell, checking the weather on their phones which, even if you can’t get a signal to call someone, is at least good for that. These are supposedly experienced hikers with no talents whatsoever for woodcraft.\n\nI’m a Black person and we don’t usually wander around in the woods as a general rule. I mean we could, as there’s nothing really stopping us from doing it, except most of us like the kinds of nature found in cities, and wandering about in the middle of the woods leaves us especially vulnerable to any white people we encounter who want to do us mischief, and I’m not talking about the events of Deliverance. If a serial killer/KKK wannabe wants to do something to me he’s gonna have to find me in my house. I’m not gonna make it easy for him (or her) by stranding myself in the middle of bumfuck Idaho, where my body could potentially never be found!\n\nPersonally, I don’t think anyone of any race should be wandering around in the woods with no destination in mind, when they could simply step out of doors for a few minutes and get all the -mosquitoes, err…I mean nature, they can handle.\n\n2. Technology Is Unreliable\n\nFrom now on, I will be forever reminded of that Geico ad where the teenagers are running from the deranged killer with a chainsaw, and they have the opportunity to get into the running car, or hide in the shed behind a wall of machetes, and they elect to hide in the shed, while the killer just shakes his head at their stupidity (and we’ll get to that in a moment.)\n\nAt first, I was kinda mad at them for not choosing the car, but then I gave it some thought. Hiding behind the machetes is a better choice because we all know that in a Horror movie, that car is completely unreliable. Its just a trap. Sure the car is running now, but as soon as they get behind the wheel, it will shut off, and no one will be able to turn it back on.\n\nCars never run in horror movies. Phones never work unless the killer is the one doing the calling. In fact, any piece of technology that could potentially help the victim will not work in a Horror movie. Any form of transportation will shut down, any form of communication beyond a smoke signal won’t get one, and of course, the killer has cut the phone lines! I have never understood the thing about cars, since the vehicle was working just fine while getting its victims to their “place of assignation”.\n\nThose teenagers would be much better off attempting to defend themselves with the machetes rather than trusting the deceptively running vehicle.\n\n3. The Unheeded Warning\n\nI hate when characters in Horror movies receive multiple warnings of what not to do, where not to go, what not to read, or touch, or look at, and they do it anyway! The first time I saw this was in American Werewolf in London where the protagonist and his best friend commit the unpardonable sins of not just unprepared hiking (because adventure!) but not heeding the warnings from the locals to stay on the road.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I don’t feel that them staying on the road would’ve at all saved them from the monster, but it was still annoying. YOU WERE WARNED! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\n\nIn movie after movie, usually involving hikers and campers, people are given multiple warnings not to go near the Old Johnson Place, or not to cross that bridge, or whistle past the cemetery while juggling a pair of bowling pins, only for the characters to basically say, “Hold my beer!”\n\nI just watched a short film where a character is given multiple warnings to not go near an old barn, and make sure the house lights are off at 11PM, so they could get a discount while staying at some off grid B&B. Well, what do you know? She promptly forgets both of these rules and is subsequently killed (and probably eaten) by the monster, and all I could do was roll my eyes at this because apparently this trope is still alive and well, and I saw it coming.\n\nSee, once I reach the point where I’m rooting for the monster, because the characters are hardheaded and/or stupid, I’m pretty much done with that movie.\n\n4. Unlikable Characters\n\nSpeaking of rooting for the monster, this is something my mother and I used to engage in all the time. We’d watch monster movies and hope sometimes that the monster would win or discuss which unlikable characters would die first.\n\nI think the movie Cabin in the Woods laid out exactly which character tropes are supposed to be included in every Horror movie, (The Final Girl, The Scholar, The Whore, The Jock), and I don’t normally have a problem with these particular tropes because such characters can still be given, well…character. They can be written in a sympathetic way, or at least made likable.\n\nThere’s always the obnoxious dudebro, usually a Jock who thinks he’s a Scholar (Hint: he knows nothing!) and just wants to be in charge because he has a penis. There’s always one, exactly one, Black guy. He’s got no family, and no other friends of color. Sometimes he’s dating one of the white women in the group. He is always angry for no apparent reason, because that is a Black man’s natural state , I guess! Now, normally I don’t USUALLY have a problem with a character being a sexpot, but I do object to bad timing. YOU WANNA KISS HIM NOW?!!!REALLY! THE MONSTER IS STANDING RIGHT THERE. IT’S LOOKING AT YOU!\n\nIn any movie where the monster is more likable and/or sympathetic that the characters, you better be Guillermo Del Toro, or at least it had better be on purpose.\n\n5. The “Blink and You’ll Miss It” Monster\n\nI didn’t post a photo for this trope which is entirely appropriate because you cannot see the monster. This is about movies that are so badly edited (or cheap) that the monster isnt given his due diligence and actually shown on the screen.\n\nNow, its okay if there is a slow buildup to showing a monster that’s been haunting the edges of the story the entire time, like Jaws, or if the monster is invisible. I get it. But when its time to show us the monster and all I get are a bunch of quick edits and growling noises, Imma get a little pissed. What kind of monster is it? Don’t tease me that the characters are seeing something truly horrible and then don’t show it to me!\n\nI do understand budget constraints but I’ve seen a few good movies where that worked out to the viewer’s satisfaction, in movies like It Follows, where the monster literally just looks just like everyone else in the movie and that’s the point. No, what I’m talking about are editors and directors who think they need to show the monster’s frenetic activity by wildly swinging the camera around or a bunch of half a second quick cuts of claws and screaming faces.\n\nGuys, that’s just annoying. Stop it.\n\n6. Cheap Cinematography\n\nThis is sooo annoying! I like a nice crisp picture with sharp outlines, nice contrasts, and some color wouldn’t be too bad, although I will watch black & white films with no issue, but I do not want to have to strain my eyeballs anymore than I have to to see what’s happening on the screen, and I hate a dull washed out image. It makes the movie feel cheap, like the creators couldn’t afford good film stock, or didn’t know how to use a digital camera. In more than a few cases it seems like they didn’t know how to use lights either, because there are quite a few movies where things are happening in the woods at night, or in dark rooms, but I’ll never know what any of those events were because I can’t see them.\n\nBad cinematography is a sign that a movie is just cheap. Sometimes the sound is dull, the dialogue is bad, and the acting is even worse. I’ve learned to look for the signs that the movie is going to be a waste of my time because Imma snob. Also, that first half of the photo up there is the reason why people need to wear makeup. You don’t want your actors looking like that.\n\nIf it looks as if more money was spent on the women’s hair and bikinis than on the sound editing, and/or images, I know I need to keep it moving cuz the monster (if there is one) is also gonna be no good either.\n\n7. Party, Party, Party (The Drunk and the Stupid)\n\nThis goes along with unlikable characters because I just hate dumb characters. In fact, I will forgive a drunk character quicker than I will characters who do things because the plot requires them to be idiots. There are two kinds of Horror movie plots. The kind where the characters really don’t know any better and are responding the best way they know how to their circumstances, and the kind of plot where the characters do the stupidest things the writers can think of just to move the plot forward.\n\nI won’t discuss the usual stupid choices that characters make in Horror movies like reading from the supernatural tome they just found in the basement, or splitting up to investigate a noise. But oddly, one of my biggest pet peeves are characters who are always looking for a party. They are obsessed with partying. I’ve met people at parties in real life, who seemed to be enjoying themselves a bit too much, but I have never met anyone who is obsessed with finding and attending any and every party. It is their absolute obsession with finding a party that has them making really stupid choices throughout the movie, like hiking, unprepared, into the middle of of the woods.\n\n8. The Pointless Jump Scare (It’s Just the Cat!)\n\nI am so done with this trope. Are people still doing this in Horror movies? I mean I wouldn’t know because I generally am sticking with a better class of Horror these days (like Midsommar, and Nope) but I’m curious. Is this still a thing? I do remember there was a short period during which people were claiming to have become fed up with cat jump scares, but I don’t hear anyone talking about this anymore, so maybe things have changed.\n\n9. The Strolling Killer\n\nI think this one is just personal to me but I hate the leisurely killer trope. They are in no hurry to kill anyone. They just calmly stroll through the environment, whether it’s on a woodland trail, or a suburban sidewalk, without a care in the world. They just know they’re gonna catch ya. No rush!\n\nWhat’s even more annoying is the killer who just suddenly appears in front of the victim, when we just saw them strolling breezily along behind the victim a minute ago. So…lemme get this right. He can move Sonic Hedgehog fast when he wants to, but…chooses not to do that while we’re looking at him? are they taking in the scenery? Can only do this in short bursts? What?\n\n10. Let’s All Die Separately\n\nThis is in line with stupid characters making dumb choices, I guess. Its a lot easier for the killer or revenant or zombies or whatever to kill individual people, so that’s why this decision gets made. I just wish that the writers came up with much better excuses for why everyone gets separated. In the movie Cabin in the Woods, the writers answered all of the stupidity by having the manipulators of the story pump drugs into the cabin so the participants would make foolish choices and get killed more easily, and I thought that was funny and inventive. Sometimes the writers seem aware of these tropes and take this into account when crafting the movie, and I appreciate that.\n\nIn the movie Cabin in the Woods, the writers answered all of the stupidity by having the manipulators of the story pump drugs into the cabin so the participants would make foolish choices and get killed more easily, and I thought that was funny and inventive. Sometimes the writers seem aware of these tropes and take this into account when crafting the movie, and I appreciate that.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nThere’s one thing that I’m completely tired of in Horror movies and that is the sight of people being dragged into the dark by invisible assailants. This happens in every supernatural Horror movie made in the last twenty years and its a trope that needs to be retired. This is one of the primary reasons I remain unimpressed by the endless Insidious, Conjuring, Paranormal Activity, Grudge remakes. They just aren’t particularly scary to me and if I see that scene in a trailer I don’t even bother to watch the movie.\n\nNote: Last week I caught a cold bug. I was down for the count and couldn’t post. But I’m all better this week and I’ll be back on track with more content.\n\nActually, this list isnt out of my wheelhouse or anything. I read weird books just as a matter of course. Most of the time nothing I enjoy ever gets seen on a best of list, unless it’s written by Stephen King, and while regular bookreaders might think his books are pretty strange, they’re not especially weird to me.\n\nI know that some people might not consider them weird but I tried not to fill up this entire list with books on Jewish Horror and Fantasy. I don’t know why I consider those types of books weird. Probably because Jewish protagonists are kind of rare, although not rare in Jewish culture apparently. I had no idea there was a large enough market of Jewish people reading Horror novels for there to be books specifically dedicated to the subject. I just finished reading The Jewish Book of Horror by Josh Schlossberg a few months ago, and that was pretty good. And, as it turns out, Jeff Vandermeer’s wife, Ann Vandermeer, is Jewish and occasionally writes about the topic, but I tried not to fill up this list with their books either.\n\nI don’t personally know any Jewish people, so I have no idea how they feel about these types of stories, so if you’re Jewish and got an opinion, hit me up in the comments. I’d love to hear from you.\n\nI love weird books though, and the weirder the better. I hope this list inspires some of you to check these out. Here, in no particular order are the ten weirdest books I’ve ever read.\n\nRosehead – Robert Jeschonek\n\nThis was the first time I’d ever read one of Jeschonek’s books. I stumbled across this by accident while browsing on Amazon. The reason why this book made the list and not any of Chuck Tingle’s books is because while I have seen Tingle’s books on Amazon, and he sort of writes books in the same humor/half serious Fantasy genre, I haven’t actually read any of Tingle’s books!\n\nIts a hardboiled, Dashiell Hammett style novella where all the characters have flowers for heads. The lead character, a cop with a rose for a head, has to stop a serial killer named The Pruner who is cutting off people’s heads, and he gets involved in some “seedy” underworld shenanigans as a result.\n\nThere is a difference between the two, in that Tingle’s books are very specifically written as jokes (although he takes his craft very seriously) and I had the impression that Jeschonek isnt necessarily trying to be funny, and is just playing around with strange ideas. This book wasn’t written in an especially jokey manner, as far as I can tell. Only the premise is funny, while the characters and events are taken seriously and the world building is well thought out, like how some of the characters have flower heads with human bodies and some have human heads with flower bodies, and how these groups interact, communicate, and move around.\n\nTo date, while this isn’t the weirdest book I’ve ever read, it’s definitely up there, and I haven’t encountered anything quite like it since.\n\nJohn Dies At the End – Series by David Wong\n\nThe picture above is from the movie based on this book, specifically the scene where John and his friends encounter a monster made out of various meats. In the story ,a couple of college dropouts have to try to save humanity from a bunch of Elder Gods that are being brought into this dimension through the use of a special recreational drug, called Soy Sauce, that allows people to travel across time and space, and see things that regular people cannot see, like various monsters.\n\nThis is a comedy, but also considered a weird book because the characters are a not too bright pair of self styled Paranormal investigators, it’s written in the first person by the self insert author, David Wong, who is not the most reliable narrator, as a result, any of the events in the book could just be him lying, delusional, or just high, and the events described in the book are, simply put, crazy, like the meat monster in the above photo.\n\nI have not watched the movie, so I don’t know how closely it hews to the book, but there is now an entire series about the dimension hopping exploits of Dave and John, which are, if that is even possible, even crazier, titled in order, This Book Is Full Of Spiders, which is my personal favorite and also pretty damned weird, What The Hell Did I Just Read, and the latest one, If This Book Exists, You’re In The Wrong Universe, which I bought but haven’t finished reading yet.\n\nMerkabah Rider – Edward Erdelac\n\nThis is one of those books where, since I encountered it for the first time, I just think it’s strange. It’s the genre called Weird Western, meaning it’s in a Western setting (the American West of the 18th and 19th century) with extra stuff added, like robots, zombies, or magic ,and sometimes all three. There are a lot of books that fall into this category and most of them have been written by Joe. R. Lansdale who is one of my favorite writers. I will probably have to do a post on Weird Westerns you should read, since that’s the wavelength I’m on this Summer.\n\nThis is another favorite writer of mine. I have no idea if he’s Jewish, but the hero of these books is a Hasidic Jewish Spellcaster who uses Kabbalah to destroy the many demons (and their worshipers) he encounters, and save any Jewish people, throughout the western territories in 1881. There are four books in the series, with each book containing about four or five novellas, with titles based on old Western films, High Plains Drifter, The Mensch With No Name, Have Glyphs Will Travel, and Once Upon A Time in the Weird West.\n\nAs you can see, the titles are a bit tongue in cheek, but the writer approaches his craft seriously, and the stories are mostly horror, and played straight.\n\nHebrewPunk – Lavie Tidhar\n\nSee, if I wasn’t careful every book on this list would just be those written by Lavie Tidhar who has a knack for writing strange images into all of his stories, no matter how benign you think the subject may be, from WW2 historical pastiches, to superheroes, to SciFi, and this Fantasy anthology, which is a bit of a mashup of all of these. Lavie, as you can probably guess, is Jewish, and a very well respected author in SFF literature.\n\nHebrewPunk is a collection of Fantasy stories featuring a Rabbi, a rat, and someone called a Tzaddick, which is, from what I understand about it, something like a Jewish paladin, a person of high moral character who is obligated to help right the wrongs of the world. It’s written in a hardboiled, 40s mystery style, and involves the three main characters having adventures in alternate worlds, London, and World War 2. You do not need to know anything about any of the various Jewish cultures or folklore to enjoy these books, since Tidhar explains just enough of that for Gentiles to be able to follow along.\n\nI knew nothing about Jewish folklore when I started reading it, and since I love a well written Fantasy, this was a fun learning experience for me.\n\nAnything Ever Written by China Mieville\n\nI don’t even know how to talk about Mieville. Everything that Mielville has ever written is the weirdest thing I’ve ever read. The very first story of his that I encountered, waaaay back in the mid 90s, was King Rat, about a young man whose life falls apart after he discovers that he has rat powers, and he goes to war with his uncle, who apparently, is King of the Rats! The story was kind of disgusting but also a lot of fun. Then there are his books set in the bizarre fictional dystopia of New Crobuzon, called Perdido Street Station, The Scar, and the Iron Council, peopled with strange cults, insect headed lovers, aliens, mutants, magical entities. and any combination of those.\n\nHe has written a bunch of weird cities books among which are The City and The City, about two cities where all the citizens live parallel lives to one another but can’t see or interact with the others except under special circumstances, and a YA book titled Un Lun Dun, about a chosen girl who turns out not to be, having Alice in Wonderland style adventures in a bizarre mirror universe version of London.\n\nBut my two favorite books are Railsea, which takes place in a world overrun with train tracks and people hunting underground creatures as if the trains were sailing vessels, and another nautical book, Kraken, about a museum worker who gets caught up in a lot of elder Gods cultic nonsense, after the body of a giant squid gets stolen from his museum. Kraken feels faintly silly and tongue in cheek, and has a very Neil Gaiman-ish feel to it, sort of like Gaiman’s novel, Neverhwere, which also covers absurd circumstances happening to some hapless British fellow.\n\nAs you can see, I’m somewhat partial to stories about bizarre, alternate universe versions, of the city of London.\n\nPunktown by Jeffrey Thomas\n\nNo, this isnt an alternate version of London, Its even stranger as it contains aliens, mutants, and multiverse gods and creatures all living in a semi-underground city, which is kind of like New York! One of Thomas’s favorite characters is a Detective named Jeremy Stake who fought in some kind of alien war, and came back changed. He can model his face to look like anyone except his old self. Jeremy Stake ahs a couple of standalone novels of his own, titled Blue War, and Deadstock, which I really enjoyed.\n\nThere is a lot going on in these Punktown books, of which there are several, and most of these things are unrelated to the things in the other books. Most of them are like slice-of-life-stories for aliens, and some are vaguely frightening, but easily followed. Although the names of the races and characters seem strange, Thomas doesn’t get too bogged down in made-up vocabulary, and all of these books have very Lovecraftian feel, without feeling like he was riffing off Lovecraft, which I like.\n\nFort Freak – Wild Cards Series by G. R. R Martin\n\nI really liked this book because it reminded me of one of my favorite comic books, titled Top Ten, about a police precinct full of weird characters an superheroes.\n\nThis nearly twenty book series, (Wild Cards) which has been around since the late 80s, is set in a world where some type of global alien infection happened during WW2, and it has given most of humanity either superpowers (Aces), horrible mutations (Jokers) , minor powers that are not significant (Deuces), or death. There are several different iterations of the series, (usually in the form of a trilogy) set in different time periods and locales, like a gameshow for superheroes, modern day Russia, or time traveling to mid-20th century Mississippi.\n\nThis trilogy, beginning with Fort Freak, is set in a police precinct in New York, and it was a lot of fun reading about the different cops with super abilities (Aces) or just odd quirks (Deuces) patrolling the streets or trying to solve various supervillain crimes, alongside regular human beings, who just take it all in stride. The books take themselves pretty seriously, and since its a shared world series, the stories are written by various authors, each of which have their own style.\n\nFinch by Jeffrey Vandermeer\n\nHere is yet another book written about a bizarre city set in something called the Ambergris universe. This one involves mushroom people, called Graycaps, and their fungi technology, slowly taking over the city, and the Detective, named Finch, who has the thankless job of hunting a serial killer of Graycaps and humans through the city’s moist underground dwellings.\n\nClickers by J F Gonzalez\n\nThere is an entire series of these ridiculously over the top Marine Splatterpunk books written with one of my favorite Horror writers, Brian Keene. The books start out pulpy enough with giant crabs attacking America’s beaches because they’re being driven to land by one of the Old Gods of the deep, and over the course of 5 books things get even wilder and stranger, with the addition of more Old Gods, an insane President, the military, Lovecraftian fish people, and yes, zombies!\n\nJ F Gonzalez passed away in 2014 and wrote dozens of books, but Clickers is the series for which he is most famously known, culminating in the tribute book above, written by authors across the Horror genre. Unfortunately, I have not read it yet, as it is only in Paperback.\n\nFantasticLand by Mike Brockover\n\nOkay, when I picked up this book, or rather chose it on NetGally, I expected it to be funny. At least that’s sort of how it was described in the blurbs I read.\n\nThis book is not funny at all.\n\nBut what I got was still pretty damn good. It’s abut a bunch of college age people who get trapped in an amusement park when a hurricane hits. The countryside around them gets pretty trashed, and there’s no communication with the outside world, making it impossible for the authorities to rescue them, and over the course of several weeks the survivors descend into warring tribes and cannibalism, after one of the male survivors sexually assaults one of the women. It’s like a men vs. women Lord of the Flies at Disneyland, and a somewhat harrowing book to read, even though it’s written as a series of interviews, letters and various lawsuits from the investigators and survivors. I had just come off of reading World War Z, so that kind of book was right up my alley.\n\nYou should only read this one if you like gore and can stomach a great deal of recounted violence.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nMotherfucking Sharks by Brian Allen Carr – I have not yet read this book, but I had the impression it was like a prose version of Sharknado. I don’t particularly care for those movies, but I would be willing to read about that kind of plot, so go figure! 👀\n\nHouse of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski – This book was mostly frustrating to me, although I can see its appeal for some people. I definitely learned about the types of Horror I find horrific while reading this book, and this isnt it. While scary for some people, (in an existential kind of way), this book was not particularly scary for me, and I also do not like to constantly juggle a book around in my hands in an attempt to read the chapters.\n\nDoctor Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke – At the time this was released, I was not used to reading books where the footnotes were so long and numerous that made it seem like I was reading another book alongside the primary book, and its impossible to skip the footnotes because they provide a deeper understanding and backstory of the characters and plot as you go along, and for a nerd like me, they’re just as fascinating as the story.\n\n(And One I Hate)\n\nThese are not smart films. I actually made a small list of those films a couple of years ago and I’m reasonably certain none of these movies were on there. What constitutes a “dumb” movie could be lots of things, but mostly it’s the plot and characters. I really hate dumb characters and by that, I mean characters that do very obviously stupid things, that no one in their right mind would do, but this character has to do it to move the plot forward. Sometimes it’s a plot that is entirely hinged on how stupid the characters are.\n\nSometimes it’s not the entire movie that’s dumb but one major plot point that takes me entirely out of the movie and makes me yell at my screen. Normally, I hate dumb movies, but sometimes a movie has at least one redeeming quality that allows me to sit through it with a minimum of fuss, while I just laugh at the dumb sections. And yeah, there’s a reason why all of these are action movies. It’s easy to compile a list of dumb action films, but harder to make a list of dumb action movies I will watch multiple times because I like the actors, or the action is really good, or just because of the lead-up to that one scene.\n\nSometimes the movies are stupid, but a great deal of fun, usually due to the strength of the personalities involved. The Rock and Nicholas Cage, for example, could star in just about anything, and I’ll watch it. It’s always great fun spending time with either of them, just don’t always expect an intelligent plot. In some cases, like Scorpion King, don’t even expect a coherent plot. Some movies are very well-made but are corny and/or silly, like Independence Day, although Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum manage to save it.\n\nCobra (1986)\n\nCobra is a Sylvester Stallone joint from 1986. Now, Stallone is no stranger to making dumb films and the 80s are pretty much famous for dumb Action movies so this was bound to happen. I remember watching this movie late one night when I was probably supposed to be asleep and thinking, “This movie is deeply stupid.” Which was true but it was also deeply funny with lots of happy and mindless ultraviolent fun. It’s one of those dumb movies that gets repeated viewings on the strength of Stallone’s performance and the cinematography. The movie just looks cool.\n\nThe 80s was known as the golden age of what we now call Copaganda. Movies about cops and other law enforcement officers being rebels, breaking all the law enforcement rules, and pretty much acting like America was still in the Wild West stage of history, were all the rage back then. Just about every other Action movie starred a rebel cop or an FBI agent blowing stuff up, and frankly, I’m glad we’ve moved on from that to having other types of professionals blowing things up, like assassins, car valets, and insurance agents.\n\nThis movie has all the usual tropes. There’s the rebel cop with the cool name, Marion Cobretti, Cobra for short, a hot blonde played by Brigette Neilsen, who I kinda liked back in the day (I don’t know why). Brigette plays a business/model named Ingrid because what else are you going to name a six-foot-tall blonde white lady. Brian Thompson was your typical bad guy with a dubious philosophy and even more dubious plan for taking over the world by killing disabled people, I guess, because it was all very radically Dawrwinist, and he has a gang of followers and nameless henchmen.\n\nWhen Neilsen’s character witnesses some malfeasance by the gang they need to hunt her down and kill her and she comes under the protection of Cobra who naturally falls in love with her. But that’s really not what makes the movie fun. What makes the movie fun is the action and the dialogue. Yes, the dialogue is stupid but it was really fun to watch these characters trying to emote while being too tough to show their emotions, and I actually liked Stallone’s character. Neither he nor the villain will be winning any Mensa awards so they’re about evenly matched. He and Cobretti get into a knockdown, drag-out fight at the end of the movie, which I enjoyed watching (I don’t know why.)\n\n10/10 will most likely watch this again on some idle Saturday afternoon.\n\nNemesis (1992)\n\nNemesis is a cyberpunk action thriller from 1992 that contains all the well-worn tropes of a Copaganda/Robocop Ripoff. There is a burnt-out cyborg cop, a wayward former partner, a manhunt, a missing computer McGuffin, or bomb, or something, and several beautiful but deceitful cyborg/AI women. It also stars three of my favorite actors, Olivier Gruner, Tim Thomerson, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa ( I don’t know why.) And I don’t think it was a coincidence that Brion James was involved in this movie. I was not a fan of Brion James, but I guess I am now, because he was everywhere after his stint as a robot in Bladerunner, so I built up a tolerance. This movie is bad in all areas of badness. The acting is atrocious, the action scenes are well done but make no sense, and quite frankly I didn’t care enough about any of the characters to root for or against anyone, but I remember watching this blatant Robocop rip-off multiple times, and will probably do it again at some point in the future since it’s free on Youtube.\n\nFor some reason, I was really crushing on Olivier Gruner at the time and remember watching several movies just because he was the star. He could be described as a low-rent version of Jean-Claude Van Damme, and he does have actual martial skills. Here, he plays an ex-cop, who is also a cyborg, named Alex. He gets recruited by an old boss or something to hunt down his former partner who runs some kind of underground rebel group. The plot involves a lot of shooting and blowing up of things. Do not even try to make any sense of the plot because you’ll only hurt yourself. I, on the other hand, am a professional bad movie watcher. This is what I do and I couldn’t even make sense of it.\n\nI think I just liked the idea that half the characters in this movie were cyborgs, and the dialogue was pretty funny, even if the delivery was horrible. Nowadays, I’d watch it because there is a considerable nostalgia factor involved. But I don’t think you should watch this movie just because I have no shame.\n\nThe Rock (1996)\n\nI wanna start off by saying that okay, Michael Bay is a horrible director, but I had to watch most of his 90s movies to figure that out, apparently. I did eventually learn my lesson and stop looking at them but not soon enough to miss seeing this. It also has the added benefit of starring both Nicholas Cage and James Bon- uh, I mean Sean Connery. Ed Harris is in this too and he’s worth about two and a half Connerys. Both William Forsythe and Michael Biehn (from The Terminator) also star in this movie, so Bay somehow managed to gather some of the hottest action stars of the 90s to take part in this novel, but still somehow mediocre plot.\n\nThis movie has everything. SEALS, the SAS, the Pentagon, ex-government prisoners, a rogue general, some rogue Marines, Alcatraz island, nerve gas, rockets, hostages, threatening an American city for ransom, and did I already say it? Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery hating to work together to accomplish their goals.\n\nThis is a movie where the plot actually makes sense in that it’s relatively easy to follow and keep track of people’s motivations, more or less. It did pretty well at the box office, a lot of people seemed to really like it, and it even won an Academy Award for Best Sound! But I’m going to argue that it’s the earnest and occasionally charming performances of the actors that make it so watchable.\n\nThe Rundown (2003)\n\nHave no doubt, this is a dumb movie, that makes no pretense of trying to seem like it’s smart, but I love the hell out of this deeply stupid film. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) stars in this movie and while he is not known for making smart films, he is such a fun and charming character in all of his movies (even though he pretty much just plays different versions of himself) that I always enjoy watching anything in which he shows up.\n\nThe movie also stars two more of my favorite actors, Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson (and Stifler from American Pie, but I am not a fan of him though). The Rock plays a bounty hunter who gets sent to Brazil to hunt down his employer’s son, who is in Brazil hunting an object called The Gato (a gold-plated cat. Why? Who cares!), which is also an object of seeming importance to both Rosario and Walken. The three of them juggle this McGuffin between them for most of the film while Dwyane tries to keep Stifler alive to get him back home.\n\nThere are jungle scenes, a political resistance camp of some kind, angry monkeys, toxic fruit, explosions galore, a herd of stampeding cattle, and a batty Scotsman who spouts biblical scripture, and is also a helicopter pilot! Frankly, this guy is my favorite character in the entire movie. You have to watch it just to see the last thirty minutes, which is how I stumbled across it on cable, one idle weekend.\n\nUniversal Soldier (1992)\n\nThis was my and my Mom’s favorite Jean Claude Van Damme movie. She was a huge fan of his (so was I) and she really loved this deeply goofy film which we watched and laughed through multiple times. Now the movie isn’t exactly dumb but it is a bit cheeky. It takes itself just seriously enough that the introduction of those cheeky little moments of humor don’t feel out of place. The plot is non-sensical (in the sense that the science behind it goes completely unexplained), but also surprisingly easy to follow. Oh, did I mention that Dolph Lundgren is in this movie? No. Well, I should have, because that man can chew scenery like nobody’s business, even though he’s only playing a low-rent Arnold Schwarzenneger.\n\nJean Claude and Dolph play a couple of soldiers who died during some kind of personal skirmish in Vietnam, but through the magic of science fiction movies, they get resurrected as Special Operations soldiers who decide to pick up where they left off. But the best character is Veronica, played by Ally Walker, as a television journalist trying to get the latest scoop about some dead soldiers, who is also a great audience stand-in, as she speaks our minds most of the time. She spends most of the movie not believing what’s happening to her, but never comes across as stupid, which was very refreshing. She also gets all the best lines and I love her!\n\nWhy this particular military team is co"
