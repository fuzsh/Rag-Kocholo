        "text": "A feature-length film made right here in Traverse City is finally getting its moment in the spotlight.\n\nQuicksand, the first feature film from local production studio Practical Films, will get an official release this fall, including a rollout “in select theaters” in September and a debut on the Apple TV streaming service that same month.\n\nDescribed by Practical as “a timely coming of age ‘bromantic comedy’ [about] two friends perilously navigating life post-college,” Quicksand was shot in the fall of 2019 and features a cast, crew, and production team of local talent. The film first premiered to local audiences at last summer’s Traverse City Film Festival, ultimately selling out four showings. Additionally, Quicksand has earned strong notices at numerous other film festivals, including the jury prize for best narrative feature at the Eau Claire Film Festival in Wisconsin, the audience choice award at Hell’s Half Mile Fim & Music Festival in Bay City, the best screenplay prize at Grand Rapids Film Festival, and an entry into the prestigious Austin Film Festival. This fall, the film will screen at the Soo Film Festival in Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nSpeaking to The Ticker in December, JohnPaul Morris – who founded Practical and who wrote and directed Quicksand – described the film festival circuit as a “resume builder” that makes it easier “to walk into a studio, or a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu, and say, ‘Hey, look at the actual analytics of how our film is being received.’”\n\n“That’s the next step that we need to take to actually get the film either into theaters or on a notable streaming service,” Morris explained at the time."
