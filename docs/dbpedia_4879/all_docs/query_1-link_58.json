        "text": "‘Quicksand‘s FLX Gets New CEO\n\nJoshua Mehr has been named CEO of FLX, the Swedish producer behind Netflix’s series Quicksand. Pontus Edgren, who part-owns the company alongside founder and Creative Director Felix Herngren and majority shareholder SF Studios, is stepping down as CEO. According to a press release, Edgren has chosen to leave “on his own initiative” and has been “in dialogue with FLX’s owners for some time to ensure a smooth succession.” Mehr has been with the company as Head of Business Affairs since 2015 and is stepping up to the CEO post with “an extremely good understanding of the industry and FLX in particular,” said Iréne Lindblat, CEO off SF Studios and Chair of the FLX board. FLX’s behind series such as Sunny Side, Love & Anarchy and Quicksand, feature films such as The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared and Comedy Queen, and unscripted shows including Komiker utan Gränser, Barncancergalan and Luuk & Hallberg.\n\nNewen Unlocks ‘Through The Keyhole‘ Deal\n\nFrance’s Newen Connect has acquired global format rights to classic panel show Through the Keyhole. The TF1-owned group plans to relaunch the show internationally, with the deal following a recent Dutch version on SBS6 known as Met de Deur in Huis. The series originally launched on UK network ITV and went on to have runs on Sky One and BBC before returning to ITV in 2013, where it ran until 2020. The show’s IP is managed by the Sir David Frost estate and was created by Kevin Sim and Lloyd Grossman. “Given the current trend for bringing back established and trusted formats, we think the time is right to re-introduce Through the Keyhole for an international audience,” said Andrew Sime, Head of Format Sales at Newen Connect.\n\nBuffalo 8 Bags ‘First Time Caller’ (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nBuffalo 8 has boarded First Time Caller, an indie thriller based on a Gideon Media podcast. The film is billed as “a darkly hilarious look at success, power, loneliness and the apocalypse.” The plot follows shock jock Brent Ziff (Abe Goldfarb) at the top of his game, whose world is rocked one night when a long-time listener (Brian Silliman) calls in with a grave message. Mac Rogers, who penned the original podcast, adapted the script. Patrick Terry produced for Cinedata. Gerry Ohrstrom, Thomas Campbell Jackson and Lawrence Starr are executive producers, alongside Buffalo 8’s Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor, Nikki Stier Justice and Grady Craig. The film premiered at the Seattle Film Festival and earned the Grand Jury Prize, along with awards for best actor (Goldfarb) and best director (Goldfarb and J.D. Brynn). Buffalo 8 has acquired worldwide distribution following a deal struck with Alex Nohe of Blood Sweat and Honey, which represented the film. A streaming and VOD release is planned for 2024.\n\nAevitas UK & Brotherstone Merge Management Cos\n\nAevitas Creative Management (ACM) UK is merging with Charlie Brotherstone’s agency, Brotherstone Creative Management. His roster of talent includes Joanne Molinaro, Afia Amoako, Matt Broussard, Tiffy Chen, Kim-Julie Hansen, Nathan Newman, Yiming Lin and George the Poet. Brotherstone will work closely with ACM’s U.S. teams to develop his authors’ careers and lead several developing initiatives with ACM US and ACM UK. Brotherstone launched BCM in 2017 having previously worked for transatlantic agency Ed Victor Limited, where he ran the film/TV, serial Ann speakers departments, and worked alongside ACM CEO Toby Mundy."
