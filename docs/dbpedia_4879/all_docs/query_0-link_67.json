Danish artist Thomas Dambo is considered the world’s leading recycle artist and is known internationally for his larger-than-life, folklore-inspired, whimsical troll sculptures made from reclaimed materials. I’ve been fascinated by Dambo’s work found around the world and was thrilled to be able to see it for myself here in Southern California. I highly recommend a visit to see the collection of trolls before they leave.\n\nThe Scandinavian Film Festival LA with BalticFilmExpo @SFFLA celebrates its 25th anniversary this year.

The Sámi are the only recognized Indigenous people in Europe, whose lands, Sápmi, are claimed and divided by the Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish and Russian nation-states. Despite the central roles they’ve played in Fennoscandia, the Sámi are commonly rendered as marginal, ahistorical wildlings whose lands are a mismanaged frontier, ripe for the taking. This lecture series illuminates how untrue those renderings are. In this first lecture, students will learn about Sámi oral and archaeological histories, diversity, and land tenure.\n\nASI Nordic Handcraft: Stamped Tea Towels with Kayla Ann (Thursday, Jan. 18, 6:30 p.m. CT)\n\nCreate your own stamps and print a tea towel in just an evening. Kayla will guide students through the process of carving a simple stamp or two, then printing a tea towel right at home. These skills will work for all kinds of future printing projects on paper or fabric, plus you’ll keep your reusable stamps and all the tools you need to keep printing. Suitable for ages 18+.\n\nASI Nordic Table: Easy Finnish Flatbreads with Kristi Bissell (Thursday, Jan. 18, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nJoin Kristi Bissell of the True North Kitchen food blog for two easy Finnish flatbreads featuring whole grains for flavor and nutrition! Kristi will start by demonstrating ruisreikäleipä, or Finnish ring bread. Originally hung from the rafters, Kristi’s version of this yeasted rye bread features honey and a cereal soaker, which creates sweet grainy flavor and a soft texture. Kristi will also share her un-yeasted version of rieska, a quick bread that uses buttermilk, baking powder and baking soda for rise. This bread can be made after work for dinner, and uses barley flour and oats for wholesome nutrition, texture and flavor. Students will be ready to start their ovens immediately after class!\n\nASI Nordic Handcraft: Scandinavian Loom Beaded Folk Band (Fridays, Jan. 19 – Feb. 9, 2:00 p.m. CT)\n\nExplore the beauty and fun of beading on a loom in the Scandinavian tradition! Inspired by designs from Nordic bandweaving, this class will take you from start to finish to make your own red and gold beaded bookmark. Learn about the historic use of loom beading and how a remarkably simple process can transform glass seed beads into delightful designs. Over the four sessions, students will practice warping their own loom, reading a chart, and various finishing options; they should also plan to work on their projects outside of class. Suitable for ages 16+.\n\nImmigration Stories – From Closed Doors to Open Doors (Saturday, Jan. 20, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nArtist Arna Rennan will give a presentation about emigration from central Norway featuring songs, images, and anecdotes that she collected in Bøverdalen, Norway. Between 1900 and 1920, half of the population of Bøverdalen immigrated to the United States. Another portion of the population left around 1950 to join relatives who had settled in the United States. Economic and social conditions were among the primary reasons for leaving. Arna takes a closer look at the existing class system found in Norway at the time and how the rural communities dealt with poverty. She will share some of these stories to bring the immigrant experience to life. This is a hybrid presentation. Watch from home on Zoom as Arna presents at Vesterheim.\n\nExploring Numedal Style Rosemaling with Patti Goke (Sunday, Jan. 28, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nWhen you hear of the style of painting that comes from Numedal, Norway, what image comes to mind? It is hard for even experts in rosemaling to think of a typical Numedal piece. That is because it had so many influences from Hallingdal and Telemark painters. Come and explore with Patti Goke, Vesterheim Gold Medalist, the different looks of the painted items from Numedal Valley. She has traveled twice to the valley known as the “Valley of the Middle Ages,” both times with Vesterheim on Folk Art Study Tours.\n\nWellbeing Workshop: Embracing Winter with Norwegian Friluftsliv (Tuesday, Jan. 30, 11:00 a.m. PT)\n\nIn 2024, the National Nordic Museum is prioritizing their personal well-being! Join health psychologist Kari Leibowitz, PhD in this one-hour interactive workshop to learn about the Norwegian concept of friluftsliv; the psychological and health benefits of getting outside, connecting with nature, and practicing friluftsliv; and how you can incorporate the practice into your own life to make the most out of the winter.\n\nIntroduction to Norwegian Genealogy (Thurs., Feb. 1 & Fri., Feb. 2 (10:00 a.m. CT)\n\nJoin the Norwegian American Genealogical Center in Madison, Wisconsin, for this online class. It is for those who are familiar with genealogy basics, but haven’t dug into Norwegian genealogical research yet. The class will focus on Norwegian naming traditions, history and geography along with strategies for reading old handwriting and finding where in Norway your ancestor may have originated. This class also includes a copy of their “Research Guide for Norwegian Genealogy: For Beginning and Experienced Genealogists.” This class is two days with different material presented each day.\n\nASI Nordic Table: Scandinavian Chocolate Treats with Kristi Bissell (Thursday, Feb. 8, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nVery few of us can say no to a chocolate treat, and Scandinavians regularly end up on the list of top 10 countries for chocolate consumption per capita—so join Kristi Bissell of True North Kitchen for an overview of their favorite classic chocolate bakes! From kladdkaka (chocolate gooey cake) to a few beloved cookies, and even an oven free chocolate treat, the chokladboll, Kristi will share tips and tricks for working with cocoa and chocolate to create satisfying and easy treats perfect for dessert or fika.\n\nVirtual Sámi Film Festival (Feb. 9-12)\n\nThe 6th Annual Sámi Film Festival returns to the National Nordic Museum this February. Presented as a partnership between the National Nordic Museum in Seattle and Scandinavia House in New York, the festival will take place virtually from February 9-12 and in-person at both venues. The program will include a variety of contemporary and historical Sámi features, documentaries, and short films curated by Liselotte Wajstedt, an award-winning Stockholm-based Sámi multimedia artist from Kiruna, Sweden.\n\nWhich events or experiences look interesting to you?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated posts:\n\nScandinavian Film Festival LA #SFFLA 2020 Coming Soon to a Theater Near You!\n\nMay 2022: Virtual Nordic Events & Norway’s National Day 17. mai\n\nBarnsdall Arts Sundays, fun for the whole family!\n\nCheers to a holiday full of Norwegian Christmas streaming!\n\nIn the last few years, Norway during wintertime has become a popular setting for Christmas movies. If watching Christmas movies is on your list of favorite Christmas activities or you just want to armchair travel to Norway for some wintery, festive fun, then there’s a whole list of options to explore. Have you already seen any of these?\n\nChristmas As Usual (Netflix Film, Released Dec. 6, 2023)\n\nThis is a new romantic comedy from Norway inspired by the true love story of the writer/director’s sister. Netflix’s description: To celebrate their engagement, Thea takes Jashan home — but his Indian roots and her Norwegian traditions clash in a chaotic Christmas. The story was filmed from February to March 2023 in and around Rauland, a rural area in Southern Norway.\n\nMy Norwegian Holiday (Hallmark Channel Movie, Premiered Dec. 1, 2023)\n\nHallmark’s description: JJ, grieving the loss of her grandmother and seeking dissertation inspiration, stumbles upon an unexpected holiday destiny. Meeting Henrik, a Norwegian from Bergen, their connection deepens when he discovers she has a troll figurine from his hometown. To explore the troll’s history and her grandmother’s ties, JJ agrees to join Henrik on a journey to Norway. In Bergen, they’re drawn into Henrik’s family Christmas and wedding traditions, with his sister’s wedding the day before Christmas Eve. JJ embarks on a holiday adventure, uncovering the troll’s origins and finding her own path to healing, love and family.\n\nHome for Christmas (Netflix Original Series, 2 Seasons, 2020 & 2021)\n\nI really enjoyed both seasons of this one! It’s a fun and atmospheric rom-com set in a Christmasy, winter wonderland in Norway. (It’s a bit raunchy at times, so beware if watching with young children.) Frustrated by all her friends being part of couples and families and her family constantly commenting on her single status, Johanna rashly and falsely announces at a family dinner on the first Sunday of Advent that she has a boyfriend. Now she has to find one to introduce on Christmas Eve.\n\nA Storm for Christmas (Netflix Limited Series, 2022)\n\nI was hoping for a third season of Home for Christmas, but instead came a spin-off of sorts with this limited series. The main character and her father from Home for Christmas return but in totally different roles. The story takes place at the airport in Oslo. Per Netflix’s description, “Destinies collide when extreme weather traps travelers and workers at an airport, forcing them to spend the final hours leading up to Christmas together.” I enjoyed this one as well.\n\nThree Wishes for Cinderella (2021) (Available through Amazon Prime)\n\nApparently, it’s a Christmas tradition for many Norwegians to watch the Norwegian dubbed version (one voice for all characters!) of the 1973 Czech movie Three Wishes for Cinderella (entire film in Norwegian available on YouTube). In 2021, an updated Norwegian retelling was made by director Cecilie A. Mosli. The movie features spectacular shots of Norwegian winterscapes and architecture as well as glimpses of Norwegian culture. When Cinderella meets the Prince in the woods, they feel immediately attracted to each other, but he is expected to find a suitable bride at the next royal ball. Equipped with three magical acorns, Cinderella decides to determine her own fate.\n\nThe Crossing: Flukten over grensen (Released 2020, available through Kanopy)\n\nThis is not a Christmas movie, but it takes place during December during Christmas time. It tells the story of the adventurous 10-year-old Gerda and her brother Otto, whose parents are in the Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. One day, just before Christmas in 1942, Gerda and Otto’s parents are arrested, leaving the siblings on their own. Following the arrest, they discover two Jewish children, Sarah and Daniel, hidden in a secret cupboard in their basement at home. It is now up to Gerda and Otto to finish what their parents started: To help Sarah and Daniel flee from the Nazis, cross the border to neutral Sweden, and reunite them with their parents. Written by Maja Lunde and directed by Johanne Helgeland.\n\nJourney to the Christmas Star (2012) (Available through Amazon Prime Video)\n\nThis is a remake directed by Nils Gaup, a Sámi film director from Norway, of the 1976 classic with Hanne Krogh. In this Norwegian fairy tale dubbed in English, a courageous girl sets out on a hazardous journey to find the Christmas Star in order to free the kingdom from a curse and bring back a long lost princess, but some mighty foes try to stop her.\n\nNorwegian Television Julekalender: Snøfall (NRK, Premiered Dec. 1)\n\nDoes your family understand Norwegian? If so, then watch this year’s Norwegian julekalender, a TV series doled out daily in 24 short episodes leading up to Christmas. Start with Season 1 first released in 2016: “A wonderland full of magic and love. An orphan girl in a sad world. A secret portal separates them. Can Selma find the way?” Or join with Season 2 releasing this year: “Noah is 10 years old and has a very important Christmas wish, but what if the letter to Santa doesn’t arrive?” Interested in more Norwegian Christmas series? See a list of shows year for year starting with 1979 when the tradition first started.\n\nI look forward to watching both of the new releases this holiday season. What will you watch? Are there other Norwegian Christmas films and series that I missed that should be on this list?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNorwegian Language Opportunities in Los Angeles\n\nNorwegian Church’s Christmas Bazaar (2012)\n\nFamily Norwegian Language Adventures with Vesterheim\n\nMarch 2023: Nordic Events & Films at The Oscars\n\nWelcome to the newest listing of Nordic events happening this month!\n\nWith the Oscars around the corner (March 12), there’s no time like the present to watch the films with Nordic connections, most of which you can watch from the comfort of your own home. Two Nordic films are nominated for Best Short Film (Live Action) – Norwegian film Night Ride filmed in Trondheim (YouTube, free), and Danish film Ivalu filmed in Greenland (Amazon Prime Video or Vimeo). Triangle of Sadness, directed by Swedish filmmaker Ruben Östlund, is nominated for three awards – Best Directing, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Picture (Fandango). Animated short film My Year of Dicks directed by Icelandic director Sara Gunnarsdóttir (Vimeo, free) and documentary A House Made of Splinters directed by Danish filmmaker Simon Lereng Wilmont (Amazon Prime Video) are nominated in their respective fields. Have you seen any of them?\n\nWhile on the topic of films, there’s a new Norwegian movie available to stream at Netflix. At the beginning of February, Netflix released Viking Wolf (Vikingulven), an original Norwegian horror/mystery movie that premiered in Norway in the fall of 2022. It’s about a teenager who starts having strange visions and bizarre desires after witnessing a grotesque murder at a party in her new town. The movie is directed by Stig Svendsen from a screenplay co-written by him and Espen Aukan. Will you watch it?\n\nIn music news, Norwegian singer-songwriter Anna of the North has a US and Canada tour happening in March and April. “Anna Of The North makes the kind of music you can take along with you on the dancefloor, on a long drive with a loved one, or in the dead of night when you’re alone and need someone to understand how you feel.” Read more about her here. Her North American tour celebrates the release of her third full-length album, “Crazy Life.” Visit her site for schedule and ticket information. She will be in Los Angeles at El Rey Theatre on Wednesday, March 29.\n\nAre you a reader? Expand your Nordic reading repertoire by joining my 2023 Nordic Literature Reading Challenge.

Petterssen’s dolls are featured in Vesterheim’s exhibition, Dolls: Playing with Identity. Rønnaug Petterssen was born in 1901 into a rural fishing community in Eidsfjorden in Vesteralen, Norway, north of the Arctic Circle. Growing up, time to play was scarce and toys were a luxury. Rønnaug made herself a doll and she would make repairs and fashion new clothes as needed. In 1934, Rønnaug started her own dollmaking business and by 1936-37 she had two or three employees. She developed dolls with Norwegian costumes, studying costumes in the collection of the Norwegian Folk Museum. Rønnaug Pettersen made a variety of dolls (pressed felt and plastic) and was the leading maker of Norwegian costume dolls from 1934 to 1979. The 8-inch costume dolls were particularly popular with American tourists.\n\nIntroduction to Swedish (Sunday, Mar. 5, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nAre you curious about the Swedish language, but not ready yet to commit to a multi-date class?

You don’t have to be a student at The Scandinavian School & Cultural Center to join.\n\nLecture: Handweaving in Sweden Today (Tuesday, Mar. 7, 6:30 p.m. CT)\n\nAre you curious about the state of handweaving in Sweden today? Weaver Christine Novotny of CAN Goods traveled through the Nordic countries summer 2022 as part of North House Folk’s Artisan Development Program and is here to report on her trip! In particular, Christine has takeaways from visiting the new generation of weavers coming out of Sweden’s largest craft education schools, Handarbetets Vänner in Stockholm and Sätergläntan Institute for Craft in Dalarna. She will share the stories of some of the younger weavers she met, the work they are doing, and how they are both pushing the boundaries of traditional Swedish weaving as well as preserving knowledge of techniques and materials. Christine will also share some of her other favorite travel highlights (textiles and beyond) from her time in Stockholm and Dalarna.\n\nSwedish Weeknight Dinners (Thursday, Mar. 9, 5:00 p.m. CT)\n\nNeed some fun ideas for simple, creative weeknight dinners? Look to the Swedes for some unique flavors that are easy to pull together even on those busy nights. You’ll make an American version of västerbottensostpaj (cheese pie), embrace the Swedish motto “Tacos, not just for Friday’s anymore” with taco paj, and you’ll dive into the oddly delicious Swedish hotdish called flygande jakob. Menu will include signature cocktails that every age can enjoy.\n\nIntroduction to Finnish (Sunday, Mar. 12, 12:45 p.m. CT)\n\nAre you curious about the Finnish language, but not ready yet to commit to a multi-date class? Are you looking for a quick and low-pressure way to get excited and prepare for an upcoming visit to Finland? This two-hour introductory workshop taught by Joona Sundström is the perfect way to get a feel for Finnish — pick up a bit of grammar and learn how to pronounce some words as part of basic conversation.\n\nScandinavian Modern Design in Norway (Tuesday, Mar. 18, 7:00 p.m. ET)\n\nJoin the Sons of Norway Washington D.C. lodge and Vesterheim Chief Curator Laurann Gilbertson for this online presentation on Norway’s contributions to the Scandinavian Modern Design movement. There were many, but the artists and products were not as well known as their Danish, Swedish, and Finnish counterparts. During the presentation, Laurann will introduce some of the most important designers of the mid-twentieth century and learn about their work in furniture, textiles, silver, glass, ceramics, and enamel.\n\nDemo: Scandinavian Waffle Day with Kristi Bissell (Thursday, Mar. 23, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nGet ready for våffeldagen (Waffle Day) on March 25 by watching how Kristi Bissell of True North Kitchen makes a batch of Scandinavian style waffles with festive toppings. Kristi will demo how to mix and cook the typical thin, heart shaped Scandinavian waffles and share fun ideas for making them into the centerpiece of a meal for this unique holiday. Students will leave with the recipes and lots of tips, inspired to bake their own batch of waffles at home!\n\nTropical Aquavit Cocktails with Emily Vikre (Friday, Mar. 24, 7:00 p.m. CT)\n\nAlthough you may not expect it, aquavit pairs deliciously with tropical fruits! Whether or not you have taken a class with us already, you will enjoy learning some new cocktail recipes in this new class featuring aquavit, the traditional Scandinavian spirit with centuries of tradition and celebration. Emily Vikre of Vikre Distillery will inspire you with her Nordic twist on classic tropical cocktails and her storytelling about the history of aquavit, as well as her contemporary lifestyle as a dual Norwegian citizen living in Duluth, Minnesota. Be prepared to concoct delicious tropical aquavit drinks while engaging with Emily and other cocktail enthusiasts during this fun evening class.\n\nFamilieTid: Baking with Kristi Bissell (Sunday, Mar. 26, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nGather the family and join Kristi Bissell of True North Kitchen as you make two classic Scandinavian cookie recipes together: Raspberry Hazelnut Thumbprint Cookies (Hallongrottor) and No Bake Chocolate Oat Balls (Chokladbollar). These are two fun, family-friendly sweet treats you will want to make again and again.\n\nLooking Ahead and Planning for April\n\nPåskebord, Easter Table (Saturday, Apr. 1, 4:00 p.m. CT)\n\nAcross Scandinavia, Easter/Påske fare includes all of the familiar suspects: chocolate, eggs, chocolate eggs, and chocolate bunnies. There is also påskeøl (Easter beer) and egg hunts in the garden. But other traditions look a little more like Halloween, especially as Swedish children dress up like witches and go door to door asking for treats. Join Patrice Johnson and learn about these traditions while whipping up a Påskebord (Easter table) that includes Not-so-devilish eggs, gjetost cider soup with rye croutons, trout with horseradish butter and mushrooms, an orange-almond dessert, and a signature cocktail/mocktail.\n\nThe Mystery of the Missing Swans and Maidens: A Frida Hansen Tapestry Tale (Sunday, Apr. 2, 4:00 p.m. CT, Free)\n\nSouthward, a tapestry of swans and maidens with shimmering threads from the famous Art Nouveau artist Frida Hansen, was an important, often-displayed monumental tapestry, so when the curators for the blockbuster show, Scandinavian Design in the United States, 1890-1980, sought key textiles, Frida Hansen’s tapestry was top of mind. But where was this 11’ x 10’ weaving now? Only a few grainy black-and-white photos and many glowing descriptions remained. In January, 2021, nearly ninety years after Southward was last displayed publicly, noted rug dealer Peter Pap opened a Tupperware container in a storage building in Maine. He unfolded a woven treasure in dusty, but pristine condition, and with a quick google search, he learned it was a long-lost Frida Hansen tapestry. Join Robbie LaFleur for this timely webinar to celebrate the life and work of Frida Hansen, and especially to hear about the Southward tapestry mystery as it unfolded.\n\nVirtual Book Talk with Erika Fatland on High: A Journey Across the Himalaya, Through Pakistan, India, Bhutan, Nepal, and China (Tuesday, Apr. 4, 12:00 p.m. ET, Free)\n\nIn April, join Scandinavia House for a virtual discussion with bestselling Norwegian author Erika Fatland (The Border and Sovietistan) on her epic new book High: A Journey Across the Himalaya, Through Pakistan, India, Bhutan, Nepal, and China, out now from Pegasus Books. The Himalaya weaves through five very different countries, where the world religions of Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism are mixed with ancient shamanic religions. Countless languages and vastly different cultures live in the secluded mountain valleys; modernity and tradition collide, and great powers fight for influence. Fatland will discuss this captivating new travelogue, which invites us into her close encounters with the many peoples of the region while also taking us on a dizzying, high-altitude trip through incredible landscapes and their dramatic, unknown histories.\n\nScandinavian Flat Plane Carving: Figure with Cap and Cane (Wednesdays, Apr. 5-19, 6:00-7:30 p.m. CT)\n\nJoin Vesterheim and carver Charles Banks as he guides you through the creation of your very own flat plane figure. A Scandinavian classic, a stylized old man with cap and cane will be the character you create. Following the tradition of flat plane figure carving, students will use only a single knife to carve out this character. Students will receive an overview of the history and traditions of this style of carving, be introduced to the cuts and techniques of the reductive carving process, and learn finishing techniques – all culminating in their very own carving. Live instruction and video tutorials will be utilized as educational tools, as well as practice sticks, a unique “head study,” and printed imagery of your character. A complete kit of materials (blanks, a knife, safety gloves, a strop and stropping compound, try sticks, and a sweet treat from Vesterheim) is included and will be mailed to you.\n\nNordic Spirit Classics’ Second Friday Series (Friday, Apr. 14, 7:30 p.m. PT)\n\nSave the date for the next session of Nordic Spirit Classics’ Second Friday Series presented by the Scandinavian American Cultural & Historical Foundation in Thousand Oaks, California. The program will feature West Coast history and Scandinavian immigrant history that was essential for building the West.\n\nLecture: Sámi Silver Traditions of Northern Norway (Sunday, Apr. 16, 1:00 p.m. CT)\n\nJoin Liz Bucheit, a Minnesota silversmith and recent recipient of an American Scandinavian Foundation fellowship to study Sámi silverwork in Norway, to hear more about her spring 2022 trip. As one of the pre-eminent American silversmiths working in the Norwegian bunad tradition, Liz has also held a long and deep interest in Sámi silverwork; she has studied both forms along traditional jewelers in Norway and maintains close ties with Norwegian and Sámi colleagues. Her 2022 trip allowed her to broaden her knowledge of historic and contemporary Sámi silverwork design, tools, and techniques in the context of her studies of Scandinavian ornament traditions. In this hour lecture, Liz will share stories and lessons from her journey through northern Norway that enrich our understanding of Sámi silverwork and its place in historic Scandinavian folk culture as well as its vibrant present.\n\nVirtual Book Talk with Barbara Sjoholm on From Lapland to Sápmi (Tuesday, Apr. 18, 7:00 p.m. ET, Free)\n\nJoin Scandinavia House for a virtual talk with Barbara Sjoholm on From Lapland to Sápmi, out in March 2023 from University of Minnesota Press. She’ll discuss the book’s exploration of the cultural history of Sápmi and the Nordic countries as told through objects and artifacts. Material objects—things made, used, and treasured—tell the story of a people and place. So it is for the Indigenous Sámi living in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, whose story unfolds across borders and centuries, in museums and private collections. The objects created by the Sámi for daily and ceremonial use were purchased and taken by Scandinavians and foreign travelers in Lapland from the 17th century to the present, and the collections described in From Lapland to Sápmi map a complex history that is gradually shifting to a renaissance of Sámi culture and craft, along with the return of many historical objects to Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.\n\nWhich events or experiences look interesting to you?\n\nBe sure to visit previous months’ listings of virtual Nordic events. Many of the events are now available to view as saved recordings.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated posts:\n\nFebruary 2023: Nordic Events & Sámi National Day\n\nApril 2023: Nordic Events\n\nVirtual 17th of May Celebrations for Norway’s Constitution Day\n\nCelebrating a Norwegian Christmas: Watch, Read, Listen, Do & Consume!\n\nIn Norway, the Christmas season is stretched over several weeks. It starts on the first Sunday of Advent, usually at the end of November. The Advent period lasts about four weeks until Christmas Eve. During Advent, a new candle is lit in a four-candle Advent wreath every Sunday. It’s a time of Christmas preparations – baking, decorating, shopping, and parties. On Christmas Eve, there are church services and families get together for the main Christmas meal. Presents are exchanged, and Julenissen may even visit and distribute presents. After Christmas Eve follows the period called “romjulen”, a quiet time until New Year’s Eve.\n\nWould you like to experience a touch of Norwegian jul? Here are some ideas of what to watch, read, listen, do, and consume in these last few days of Advent and during romjulen that follows. God jul!\n\n(Some of the links below are affiliate links.

(It’s a bit raunchy at times, so beware if watching with young children.) Frustrated by all her friends being a part of couples and families and her family constantly commenting on her single status, Johanna rashly and falsely announces at a family dinner on the first Sunday of Advent that she has a boyfriend. Now she has to find one to introduce on Christmas Eve.\n\nA Storm for Christmas (Netflix Limited Series Released Dec. 16, 2022)\n\nI was hoping for a third season of Home for Christmas, but instead there’s a spin-off of sorts with this limited series. The main character and her father from Home for Christmas return but in totally different roles. The story takes place at the Oslo airport. Per Netflix’s description, “Destinies collide when extreme weather traps travelers and workers at an airport, forcing them to spend the final hours leading up to Christmas together.”\n\nThree Wishes for Cinderella (Available through Amazon Prime Video)\n\nApparently, it’s a Christmas tradition for many Norwegians to watch the Norwegian dubbed version of the 1973 Czech movie Three Wishes for Cinderella. Last year, an updated Norwegian retelling was made by director Cecilie A. Mosli. The movie features spectacular shots of Norwegian winterscapes and architecture as well as glimpses of Norwegian culture. Consider putting it on your watch list!\n\nGrevinnen og hovmesteren / Dinner for One (YouTube, Skit begins at 2:25)\n\nThis is a bizarre Norwegian tradition! Every year on Little Christmas Eve (Dec. 23) at 9:00 p.m., NRK, the Norwegian national TV station, shows this short black and white comedy skit (first released in 1963) about a butler and an elderly countess hosting a dinner for four imaginary guests. The link above includes an introduction in German. The skit begins at 2:25. “Same procedure as last year?” and “Same procedure as every year” are now common phrases in Norway.\n\nRead 📚\n\nThere’s no better time to read books set during Christmas or winter than now. Below you’ll suggestions, and it wouldn’t be a Norwegian book list without some crime fiction as well.\n\nFor a list of Christmas books for families, visit my page Book List: Christmas in Scandinavia.\n\nA Very Scandinavian Christmas: The Greatest Nordic Holiday Stories of All Time (2019)\n\nFrom the publisher: This collection brings together the best Scandinavian holiday stories including classics by Hans Christian Andersen of Denmark; Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, August Strindberg and Hjalmar Söderberg of Sweden; as well as the acclaimed contemporary Norwegian authors Karl Ove Knausgaard and National Book Award nominee Vigdis Hjorth. These Nordic tales―coming from the very region where so much of traditional Christmas imagery originates―convey a festive and contemplative spirit laden with lingonberries, elks, gnomes, Sami trolls, candles, gingerbread, and aquavit in abundance.\n\nBerlin Poplars by Anne B. Ragde, translated from the Norwegian by James Anderson (First published in Norway in 2004)\n\nTaken from the publisher: Aware of their 80-year-old mother’s failing health, three brothers reluctantly reunite over the winter holidays, where unexpected guests and the question of inheritance prompt the revealing of some bizarre, and devastating, truths.\n\nWinter Stories by Ingvild H. Rishøi, translated from the Norwegian by Diane Oatley (First published in Norway in 2014)\n\nI don’t often read short story collections, but at a virtual event with Norwegian authors, this particular author was mentioned as a must-read and I was drawn to the serene winter cover. It’s a collection of three long short stories, all of which take place during winter time in Norway and are about vulnerable people (a young single mother, an ex-convict, and a teenager) trying to do their best for the young children in their lives, but with difficulty. The author does a compelling job of exploring their struggles, and in every story there’s an unexpected stranger whose compassion makes a significant difference. A five-star read for me.\n\nThe Caveman (William Wisting Mystery) by Jørn Lier Horst, translated from the Norwegian by Anne Bruce (First published in Norway in 2013)\n\nJørn Lier Horst is my favorite Norwegian crime writer. The Caveman was the first of his that I read. Wisting is a likable and respectable police investigator who works in a smalltown, coastal community south of Oslo. His daughter Line, a journalist, is also a main character in this story. This installment takes place during the holiday season. Horst’s books usually tackle a greater social issue; this one reflects on forgotten and marginalized members of society. The Caveman won the the 2016 Petrona Award for the Best Scandinavian Crime Novel of the Year.\n\nThe Snowman (Harry Hole #7) by Jo Nesbø, translated from the Norwegian by Don Bartlett (First published in Norway in 2007)\n\nI had read the first Harry Hole book a few years ago and wasn’t a fan of him (a too damaged alcoholic with poor judgement), but I wanted to give the series another try since it’s such a popular one both at home and abroad. I’m glad I did; this book was a fun ride! I really enjoyed that it took place in Oslo (November with the first snow). Also, Harry Hole’s character was much more likable; he doesn’t drink in this installment and his skills as a detective really shine. In this story, Harry is on the hunt for a serial killer who’s been targeting married women with children and leaves a snowman behind as a calling card. It was very engaging and suspenseful with a satisfying resolution.\n\nThe Redeemer (Harry Hole #6) by Jo Nesbø, translated from the Norwegian by Don Bartlett (First published in Norway in 2005)\n\nThis Harry Hole installment is even more of a Christmas crime read, though it does venture outside of Norway. From the publisher: Shots ring out at a Salvation Army Christmas concert in Oslo, leaving one of the singers dead in the street. The trail will lead Harry Hole, Oslo’s best investigator and worst civil servant, deep into the darkest corners of the city and, eventually, to Croatia. An assassin forged in the war-torn region has been brought to Oslo to settle an old debt. As the police circle in, the killer becomes increasingly desperate and the danger mounts for Harry and his colleagues.\n\nEat & Drink 😋\n\nNorwegian Christmas Cookies – Syv slag kaker\n\nChristmas cookies are an important part of a Norwegian Christmas. The baking starts early and long standing tradition calls for syv slag, or seven varieties. The number seven was believed to bring luck and is an important religious number often symbolizing completion or perfection. The seven types are chosen based family preferences. Norwegian Christmas cookies all generally have the same basic ingredients (butter, flour, sugar, eggs) and are either baked, fried, or made with a special tool. My favorite type is krumkaker, a cone-shaped cookie made with a special flat iron. Berlinerkranser is another good one. This year I plan to try making serinakaker. Read more about Norway’s syv slag kaker at The Great Norwegian Christmas Cookie Extravaganza and 21 Norwegian Christmas Cookies for a Scandinavian Holiday.\n\nGløgg\n\nGløgg is a very popular warm beverage (may be alcoholic or non-alcoholic) served throughout the Christmas season. You’ll find it in homes, at parties, and out at Christmas markets. It’s usually made with red wine along with various mulling spices and served with raisins and almonds. You can make it from scratch or buy readymade gløgg (and potentially add your own wine or spirits) or you can buy mulling spices to add to your own seasonal beverage.\n\nRisengrynsgrøt (Rice Porridge)\n\nA popular food during Christmastime is risengrynsgrøt or rice porridge. It is served with butter, cinnamon, and sugar on top, and during Christmastime, it is traditional to hide a peeled almond in it. The person who finds it receives a marzipan pig as a prize (though my family is not a fan of marzipan so we have Norwegian chocolate as prizes instead). You can make it from scratch or buy a premade mix you heat up with milk.\n\nFor more inspiration related to eating and drinking, visit the websites of favorite Scandinavian food writers.\n\nNevada Berg of North Wild Kitchen: Recipes, traditions and stories from Norway\n\nKristi Bissel of True North Kitchen: Simple, seasonal Nordic-inspired recipes\n\nDaytona Danielsen: Helping you live your best Scandinavian life with food, family, and stories\n\nDo 👐\n\nListen to Norwegian Christmas music.\n\nFor me it’s not Christmas without my playlist of Christmas music which of course includes various Norwegian artists. Among my favorite songs are Kim Rysstad’s 2017 album Snøen laver ned (The snow is falling down) with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. I also enjoy songs from trumpeter Ole Edvard Antonsen’s 2010 Christmas album Desemberstemninger (December Moods). And finally, it’s not Christmas without some Sissel Kyrkjebø, Norway’s Queen of Christmas Music. Sissel has a new Christmas album out this season, Winter Morning. It was recorded in Utah with the Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square.\n\nMake heart baskets.\n\nPaper heart baskets are popular not only in Norway but also in Denmark and Sweden. During Christmas time, they are used as decorations on trees or in garlands and may even hold candies and small treats. They can be simple and extremely complex. All you need is paper, scissors, and a little tape for the handle. Single color wrapping paper and construction paper work fine for this. See instructions here and watch this video to help with the weaving.\n\nGo on a virtual visit to Oslo during Christmas time!\n\nIn the video Christmas in Oslo: Festive Highlights from Oslo, Norway, it’s early December 2022 and winter has arrived in Oslo, though not the snow that is currently there now (at time of publication). The days may be short and dark, but the city is bright with festive decorations. Consider also taking a walk through the Oslo Christmas Market. For more glimpses of Christmas time in Oslo, watch Visit Norway’s photo series, The Christmas Town, Oslo, which covers everything from Christmas markets to ski jumping.\n\nWatch St. Lucia celebrations with Rick Steves on a visit to Drøbak and Oslo.\n\nIn Rick Steves’ European Christmas, Rick visits Drøbak and Oslo to explore the Scandinavian Christmas tradition of Santa Lucia (December 13). Candle-bearing Santa Lucias bring light to the middle of winter and the promise of the return of summer. To capture the celebration, he traveled to Drøbak where kindergarteners bring light and saffron buns to a senior home and to Oslo where the Norwegian Girls’ Choir perform by candlelight in Gamle Aker Kirke, a tiny, heavy-stone, Viking Age church in Oslo (skip to 14:43 for segment on Norway). For some background information on the celebration, visit Life in Norway’s The Scandinavian Santa Lucia Celebrations Explained.\n\nWishing you and yours a wonderful holiday season!

An old family diary, true immigrant stories, and Scandinavian folk and fairy tales combine to tell the story of West of the Moon, a “mesmerizing tale of Astri’s treacherous and harrowing mid-19th century emigration to America.” (Booklist, starred review). Preus’s research into Norwegian immigration led her to startling revelations about the role of women healers, the relationship between a common 19th century childhood ailment and the belief in changelings, and the reverence and fear our Norwegian ancestors had for The Black Book, “whose pages teach how to recover lost goods, find buried treasure, turn back the attacks of snakes and dogs, and more.” Preus will discuss how she combined history, fiction, and folklore in this novel and may give a sneak preview of her brand new book Windswept, also inspired by Norwegian fairy tales and populated by trolls.

It draws readers into the Sámi experience of abuse of power, racism, and contempt on the part of public authorities. Written in two languages — Norwegian in the first part and Northern Sámi in the second — the collection empowers Sámi readers while offering insight to non-Sámi readers through its portrayal of moments in time. The author will discuss the collection with moderator Lisa Monica Aslaksen. This event will take place as a Zoom webinar. You may ask questions in the chat or send them in advance to info@amscan.org.

Here I feature films and TV shows from Sweden. Previously, I shared Films & TV Series to Stream Now: Norway. Stay tuned for Denmark.\n\nOver the years, Sweden has won three Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film – The Virgin Spring (1960), Through the Glass Darkly (1961), and Fanny & Alexander (1983) – all of them directed by Ingmar Bergman and which can all be streamed now. See below for details.\n\nIn the case of Sweden, I found it interesting that I had not seen many of the movies and TV shows listed, but I had read many of the books upon which they were based. I enjoyed the books (I even consider them among my favorite Scandinavian reads) but I am often hesitant to see movies that are based on books I’ve read and enjoyed. But maybe that will change during this coronavirus self-quarantine time.\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous post, for streaming options, you have, of course, the usual suspects – Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more – but don’t forget that you may have free streaming options available from your public library through hoopla and kanopy as well. These two services offer plenty of free foreign and domestic films and TV shows at no charge.\n\nPlease note that availability of films and TV shows on these streaming platforms may change at any time.\n\n* Movies/TV series with one asterisk are ones I’ve watched but don’t necessarily recommend unless you’re up for something a bit out of the ordinary.\n\n** Movies/TV series with double asterisks are ones I’ve enjoyed and recommend, assuming you’re in the mood for that genre.\n\nFilms from Sweden\n\nA Man Called Ove\n\nDirector: Hannes Holm (2016)\n\nBased on book by Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nAcademy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, 2016\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video (Sundance Now)\n\nAs It Is in Heaven\n\nDirector: Kay Pollak (2004)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nStarring: Michael Nyqvist\n\nAcademy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, 2004\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla\n\nBecoming Astrid\n\nDirector: Pernille Fischer Christensen (2018)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video (included with Prime)\n\n* Border\n\nDirector: Ali Abbasi (2018)\n\nGenre: Drama, Fantasy\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nBritt-Marie Was Here\n\nDirector: Tuva Novotny (2019)\n\nBased on book by Fredrik Backman, Britt-Marie Was Here\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video (included with Prime)\n\nFanny & Alexander\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman (1982)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nAcademy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film, 1983\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nForce Majeure\n\nDirector: Ruben Ostlund (2014)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla, kanopy, Amazon Prime Video (Magnolia Selects)\n\n** The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy #1)\n\nDirector: Niels Arden Oplev (2009)\n\nBased on book of same title by Stieg Larsson\n\nGenre: Crime, Thriller\n\nStarring: Noomi Rapace, Michael Nyqvist\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla, Amazon Prime Video (included with Prime)\n\n** The Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium Trilogy #2)\n\nDirector: Daniel Alfredson (2009)\n\nBased on book of same title by Stieg Larsson\n\nGenre: Crime, Thriller\n\nStarring: Noomi Rapace, Michael Nyqvist\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla, Amazon Prime Video (included with Prime)\n\n** The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest (Millennium Trilogy #3)\n\nDirector: Daniel Alfredson (2009)\n\nBased on book of same title by Stieg Larsson\n\nGenre: Crime, Thriller\n\nStarring: Noomi Rapace, Michael Nyqvist\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla, Amazon Prime Video (included with Prime)\n\nSami Blood\n\nDirector: Amanda Kernell (2017)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla\n\nSimon and the Oaks\n\nDirector: Lisa Ohlin (2011)\n\nBased on novel by Marianne Fredriksson, Simon’s Family\n\nGenre: Drama, Historical\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared\n\nDirector: Felix Herngren (2015)\n\nBased on novel of same title by Jonas Jonasson\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe 101-Year-Old Man Who Skipped Out on the Bill and Disappeared\n\nDirector: Felix Herngren & Måns Herngren (2016)\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix\n\n* The Square\n\nDirector: Ruben Ostlund (2018)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nAcademy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, 2018\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla, Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Virgin Spring\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman (1960)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nAcademy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film, 1960\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman (1961)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nAcademy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film, 1962\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nTV Series\n\nQuicksand\n\nBased on novel of same title by Malin Persson Giolito\n\nGenre: Drama\n\n6 episodes of 45 minutes each\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix\n\nWallander: The Original Episodes\n\nBased on books by Henning Mankell\n\nGenre: Crime\n\nStarring: Rolf Lassgård (2003)\n\n4 episodes\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla\n\nWallander: Season 2\n\nBased on books by Henning Mankell\n\nGenre: Crime\n\nStarring: Krister Henriksson (2012)\n\n13 episodes\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla\n\nWallander: Season 3\n\nBased on books by Henning Mankell\n\nGenre: Crime\n\nStarring: Krister Henriksson (2013)\n\n6 episodes\n\nWhere to Watch: hoopla\n\nWhich films and TV shows have you seen and recommend?

The programs are in original Norwegian language. English subtitles are available. Trial memberships are available. Many programs not available elsewhere can be found at Films of Norway.
