        "text": "Shudder decided to remind us that she’s that girl today. The beloved streamer dropped a trailer for a movie called Quicksand that looks like the survival thriller we have been waiting on this summer season.\n\nSynopsis\n\n“In Quicksand, an American couple, on the brink of divorce, travel to Colombia for a work conference. While on a hike through the rainforest, a storm causes them to become trapped in a pit of quicksand. Unable to move, it becomes a struggle for survival as they battle the elements of the jungle and a venomous snake, in order to escape.”\n\nAlso Read: Lloyd Kaufman Stars In New PONS Music Video From Dylan Mars Greenberg [Exclusive]\n\nThe scary release stars Carolina Gaitàn (Encanto and Narcos) and Allan Hawco (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan and Frontier).\n\nQuicksand is written by Matt Pitts (Westworld) and directed by Andrés Beltrán (Tarumama). This Shudder Original will make its debut on Friday, July 14th. It will also be available to stream on AMC+.\n\nAlso Read: ‘The Gates’ Exclusive Clip: Richard Brake Goes On A Killing Spree\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing where this movie lands on the list of survival horror movies that warn us to stay out of the rainforest. I took that note to heart as a child, but quite a few people seem to need constant reminders.\n\nI don’t believe in going outside, but I do enjoy movies about people who try Mother Nature’s patience. So I highly encourage you to watch the trailer below so that you can be as stressed out as I am:\n\nAre you planning to check out Quicksand when it hits Shudder next month? Then invite me to your virtual watch party at @misssharai."
