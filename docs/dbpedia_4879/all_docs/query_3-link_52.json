        "text": "Broken Heart (04:19)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nCan a person die of a broken heart? A heart is dissected from a pig corpse; human hearts and pig hearts are very similar. Archival film footage shows a variety of scenes from old movies from a man choking and smoking to a Spanish dancer and her lover/hero.\n\nQuicksand Survival (05:23)\n\nCan we escape from quicksand? Quicksand is a \"non-Newtonian\" liquid. Under the pressure of a foot, quicksand gets runnier. Yet, the foot is very difficult to remove. It takes a \"skip lorry\" to pull a dummy out. It is generally not possible to drown in quicksand. The danger lies in a tide coming in while a person is stuck. We learn a technique from escaping quicksand.\n\nHot Air Rises? (04:58)\n\nIf hot air rises, why are mountain tops cold? We learn how pressure affects temperature with the help of a thermal camera. A demonstration with a refrigerator helps viewers understand the principles involves in air expansion and compression.\n\nWhat Are Black Holes? (02:20)\n\nWe learn what a black hole is and how it can be \"seen\" from Earth. Are black holes gateways to other universes?\n\nFast Food and Obesity (04:22)\n\nDoes fast food make you fat? The film host loads up with calories (7,000 a day) to prove whether fast food makes us fat. We learn what a calorie is. Weight for weight, fast food tends to contain a third as much fat than a healthier meal. To what extent does a heavy workout burn calories?\n\nDigging to Australia (05:41)\n\nWe learn about Earth's molten core and high air pressure. Is it possible to dig to Australia? Absolutely not. The film host experiences a high pressure environment? His voice changes radically, and he has trouble thinking straight. Increased nitrogen has negative effects on humans.\n\nCredits: How Quicksand Works, and Much More: The Secrets of Everything (00:26)\n\nCredits: How Quicksand Works, and Much More: The Secrets of Everything"
