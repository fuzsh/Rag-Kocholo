        "text": "Traverse City’s Practical Films announced on Thursday morning that it will be screening its locally-made feature film, Quicksand, at numerous theaters around the state throughout the month of September, starting with a showing at TC’s own City Opera House next Thursday, September 7. That screening starts at 7pm, and tickets are on sale on the City Opera House website now.\n\nThe rest of the calendar of showings is as follows:\n\n· Holland: Sperrys Movie House, September 8-14\n\n· Port Huron: Sperrys Movie House, September 8-14\n\n· Marquette: Marquette Cinemas, September 8-14\n\n· Quinnesec: Tri City 8, September 8-14\n\n· Escanaba: Willow Creek 8, September 8-14\n\n· Grand Rapids: Wealthy Theater, September 14 at 7pm\n\n· Manistee: Vogue Theater, September 15\n\n· Sault Ste Marie: Soo Film Festival, September 16\n\n· Frankfort: Garden Theatre, September 18\n\nPractical Films made Quicksand, described as a “bromantic comedy about two friends perilously navigating life post-college,” in the fall of 2019, with much of the movie made in and around Traverse City. The film has since screened at a variety of film festivals in Michigan and beyond, including last summer’s Traverse City Film Festival.\n\nPractical announced earlier in August that it had signed with a distributor to get Quicksand out into the world, including a release on Apple TV on September 19. September's series of Michigan theatrical screenings is a part of that distribution strategy. Practical is also currently raising funds to help bolster the distribution of the film."
