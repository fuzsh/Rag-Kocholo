        "text": "This is the thing that most terrified me as a child. That the ground itself could simply swallow me, was just too much. I have had no encounters with the real thing, though; but have read about some who claim they did. So, the MYTH BUSTERS did a show about it, which I found inadequate, as they talked about buoyancy but did not discuss backpacks, heavy clothing, or other weights. The big guy pushed the little guy down, released him, and he popped up again, demonstrating the buoyancy. They had spoken to a geologist about grades of sand most likely found in QS, etc., but I think they used too high a volume of water injected, as it was very thin. There was a History Channel program about a year ago that also included homemade QS. These guys' QS was so thick, that they simply could not pull their guy out of it. In an episode of BATMAN, the RIDDLER (this one time portrayed by the ADDAMS FAMILY GUY) had made a QS trap, and, though stuck in it, Batman gave Robin hope for survival by mentioning buoyancy.\n\nSo, anyway, as an adult, I still find it (on TV, etc.) usually makes my stomach tighten. I recall reading NEW ARABIAN NIGHTS, one of whose stories featured QS, as I had done a text search on a classic literature CD for QS (among other things), & that it took me a very long time to finish the story because it upset me, just thinking about it. Anyway, I have seen all TARZAN movies but TARZAN'S THREE CHALLENGES, in no fewer than three of them, the bad guy dies in QS. Bela Lugosi's one portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster dies in QS, as do more than a few characters in movies. In the film, WOMAN IN THE DUNES which TCM will show 3:45 PM Friday, 03/03/2017, the QS is depicted very differently than in any film, TV show, or novel I have ever experienced. It is very thick, & the guy sinks so slowly that he does not even realize he is sinking until it is up to his knees.\n\nhis pursuers come with boards strapped to their feet, and dig him out. They talk about those who had not been rescued, who supposedly had drowned, and whose possessions were there for the taking by anyone willing to dig for them.\n\nI suppose the thickness depends on the volume of water entering the mass of sand, but other than this one film, every depiction of QS was like applesauce, it was so thin.\n\nYeah, I wanted a scene like this in my latest WiP but the smallest amount of research showed how unlikely it was to be effective in real life. Where quicksand kills it tends to be because -- like the Morecombe Bay sands -- people can't move fast enough when the tide rushes in, so they're not killed by being swallowed by the sands, they drown in the water.\n\nHaving said that, people do die in things like grain silos, where they sink into the grain and can't get free -- no water there, of course, and the grain size is thicker than most sand grains I imagine.\n\nAs to film depictions, there is a death by quicksand in the film-within-the-film of The Artist, and, of course, there's the lightning sand in The Princess Bride -- neither very realistic. And in novels, it features in a Peter Wimsey story, but off the top of my head I can't remember which one.\n\nThey had spoken to a geologist about grades of sand most likely found in QS, etc., but I think they used too high a volume of water injected, as it was very thin. There was a History Channel program about a year ago that also included homemade QS. These guys' QS was so thick, that they simply could not pull their guy out of it.\n\nI agree about the buoyancy factor, but in addition, I think \"Quicksand\" itself may be a misnomer.\n\nSand, as in grains of quartz (SiO2) (mineral sands are old beach sands that contain concentrations of other minerals, rutile, ilmenite, zircon and monazite) would not pull or suck you down. They are very hard and tiring to move through though, which is why they are used in Escape Lane car traps on steep hills.\n\nAs a child, I also had a fear of ever being caught in QS after watching the films you describe. However, looking back on those films now, what they were really using looks more like \"Quickmud\"!\n\nMud or silt particles are mostly Clay minerals (hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates, which form in the presence of water) mixed with organic matter. These are much more \"sticky.\" If you try to walk in river mud or pond mud, you are far more likely to have trouble lifting your foot out, and may often lose a shoe or wellie. Mud may not pull you in, as those films showed, but it is often hard to climb out of."
