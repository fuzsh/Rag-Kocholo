        "text": "Remember quicksand? Movies back in the day probably made you terrified of being sucked down into a patch while walking in the woods, but there’s a good chance you never actually ended up encountering any quicksand in real life. That’s a good thing, of course. But the characters in the upcoming survival thriller Quicksand, you may have guessed, aren’t so lucky.\n\nDeadline reports that Shudder has acquired Quicksand, the premiere set for June 23.\n\n“The English-language Colombian film written by Matt Pitts (Westworld) and directed by Andrés Beltrán (Tarumama) will also be available for streaming on AMC+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand,” Deadline notes in today’s report.\n\n“Quicksand stars Carolina Gaitán (Encanto) and Allan Hawco (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan) as an American couple on the brink of divorce who travel to the country for a work conference. While on a hike through the rainforest, a storm causes them to become trapped in a pit of quicksand.\n\n“Unable to move, it becomes a struggle for survival as they battle the elements of the jungle and a venomous snake in order to escape.”\n\n“Making Quicksand was such a thrilling and challenging experience. I hope people can relate to the intense emotions Carolina and Allan portrayed so well,” said Beltrán in a statement. “We shot the film on location, in a cold forest in the mountains of Colombia. Although the weather conditions were harsh for the actors and crew, we kept enjoying the process because we wanted to tell this story as real as possible.”\n\nJason Cherubini, Nicolás Reyes and Sean Patrick Burke produced, with Richard Switzer, Martin Ramos, John Harris and Kris Meyer serving as exec producers.\n\nKetchup Entertainment’s Hellboy: The Crooked Man once again takes the franchise in a new direction, with Jack Kesy (12 Strong) taking over the title role this time around.\n\nOddly enough, however, the film’s official UK poster refers to Hellboy: The Crooked Man as “the fourth installment in the global franchise.” Technically true, of course, but usually a franchise reboot of this sort isn’t labeled that way. In any event, check out the UK art below.\n\nHellboy: The Crooked Man comes to UK theaters on September 27, with no United States release date announced at this time. We tip our hats to Total Film for sharing the UK art today.\n\nMike Mignola co-wrote the new Hellboy film with Christopher Golden.\n\nHellboy: The Crooked Man is “set in the 1950s and costars Adeline Rudolph (Resident Evil) as a rookie agent of the BPRD who teams up with Hellboy to protect the residents of Appalachia from the creepy Crooked Man, who is collecting souls for the devil.”\n\nBrian Taylor (Crank, Gamer, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Mom and Dad) directed the movie for Millennium, based on a Hellboy mini-series from 2008. The story is said to “expand Hellboy’s world through one of the most beloved issues of the comic series.”\n\nJefferson White (Yellowstone) stars alongside Kesy and Rudolph as Tom Ferrel, Leah McNamara as Effie Kolb, Joseph Marcell as Reverend Watts, Hannah Margetson as Cora Fisher, and Martin Bassindale as the Crooked Man, among others.\n\n“The Crooked Man is a departure from all previous Hellboy films where Mike Mignola and the creator of the comics will finally shepherd an authentic version of his stories and characters in film form,” said Millennium Media’s President Jeffrey Greenstein. “This is the first in the series of films that will captivate audiences in familiar (and new) ways. Brian Taylor is an expert across the board, and I couldn’t think of a better person to bring this story to life to show our audience this different and original Hellboy slate of films.”\n\nMillennium Media is producing the new movie alongside Dark Horse Entertainment."
