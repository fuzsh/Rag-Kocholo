It certainly shares the same DNA as those comical road trip films where well-intentioned, somewhat clueless dudes who find themselves caught up in situations that stretch well beyond their skill set.\n\nIn the film, newcomers Tanner Presswood and Simon Elias take on the roles of Ray and Paul, two recent college graduates embarking on a road trip to recover their friend's lost wedding ring. As the impending wedding deadline looms, their journey unfolds as a sequence of obstacles and hilarious blunders, all while racing against a ticking clock.\n\n\"Quicksand\" marks the directorial and co-writing debut of indie filmmaker JohnPaul Morris, hailing from Michigan. This film serves as his first venture into feature-length filmmaking.\n\nCo-starring Mia Hagerty, Kelsey Ramirez, Melissa O'Brien, Vince Sarowatz, Melissa Kendell, and Tommy Hills, \"Quicksand\" is being released in select theaters and on digital on September 19th. Watch the official trailer, above."
