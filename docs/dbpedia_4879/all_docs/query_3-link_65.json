Well, thankfully it’s something that I’ve never encountered in my life!\n\nWell, we’ve got a new movie coming out titled Quicksand, and it’s a survival thriller about a couple who find themselves stuck in quicksand. The movie comes from Shudder, and the first trailer has been released.\n\nIn Quicksand, “an American couple, on the brink of divorce, travel to Colombia for a work conference. While on a hike through the rainforest, a storm causes them to become trapped in a pit of quicksand. Unable to move, it becomes a struggle for survival as they battle the elements of the jungle and a venomous snake, in order to escape.”\n\nThe movie was directed by Andrés Beltrán (Tarumama) from a script written by Matt Pitts (Westworld). The movie stars Carolina Gaitàn (Encanto) and Allan Hawco (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan).\n\nBeltrán said in a statement: “Making Quicksand was such a thrilling and challenging experience. I hope people can relate to the intense emotions Carolina and Allan portrayed so well. We shot the film on location, in a cold forest in the mountains of Colombia. Although the weather conditions were harsh for the actors and crew, we kept enjoying the process because we wanted to tell this story as real as possible.”\n\nThe Shudder Original film will make its exclusive streaming debut Friday, July 14 on Shudder and will also be available to stream on AMC+."
