These stickers belong in any analysis of satiric comics of the ‘90s, introducing a new generation of kids to the work of RAW, HIGH TIMES, and HEAVY METAL cartoonist Drew Friedman. Marvelous ‘gross’ sticker series, designed and for the most part illustrated by Drew Friedman and the Topps illustration pool, with the likely involvement of Art Spiegelman (of MAUS fame!), who worked at Topps for decades. Includes both packaging designs/wrappers, and this is a pretty expansive set, missing only stickers #9, 23,57, 58, and “Senior Stickers” #22. By the way, this is relevant to the card market implosion of the 1990s, that in turn fueled the comics direct sales market implosion later in the decade: You can rip kids off once, MAYBE twice, but not a third time. My son Dan and his friends were briefly into card collecting, and the decisive turning point in their abandoning the hobby came when the purchase of a full, unopened retail box of cards from Topps would NOT yield even ONE complete set of cards! Once the market began to do this (requiring, I suppose, the purchase of TWO boxes to ensure one complete set), along with adding “Chase Cards” (by-design ‘rare’ cards, ensuring only one or two ‘Chase Cards’ per unopened retail box), Dan and his friends were pissed off and bailed out of the hobby in short order. The card market got another boost with role-playing card games (MAGIC) and the POKEMON phenomenon (which really was a new trading card cycle, with kids actively trading them on the playground and elsewhere), but I’ll never forget the disappointment Dan felt when buying a FULL BOX would not yield a complete set.

This was part and parcel of Tom Skulan’s ambitious plans to expand FantaCo, via creative spin-offs from licensed properties (here, licensed from The Topps Company, Inc.); alas, in all cases I know of, his plans were scuttled due to the deadly mix of the indifference of the wider comics marketplace (sales weren’t too hot on this package, as I recall), and primarily by paying too little to creative talent while expecting extensive commitments of their time and energy in exchange (for the sake of a yardstick, it was my first task when I took over editing reins at GORE SHRIEK for a couple issues to convince Tom to up his page rate to the princely sum of $20 per page!). Of course, slow or poor sales only validated FantaCo’s lower page rates – Tom couldn’t pay more, and tough lessons like the fate of this MARS ATTACKS mini-comics series made publishing seem an increasingly risky venture. This set up a rather painful dynamic that soon embittered Tom. But there were many complications. Page rates that might be acceptable (just) for work one owns the copyright to are complicated once such rates are attached to work-for-hire ventures that the creators don’t have a proprietary stake in. Even mini-comics (particularly color mini-comics) are a major commitment when there are going to be 54 issues! The creative team of Mario A. Bruni (a grossly underrated Albany-based designer who did some extraordinary work for FantaCo, including designing GORESHRIEK, which I edited a few issues of) and Bruce Spaulding Fuller was a solid mix, but Bruce (who also did some of GORESHRIEK’s most memorable covers) was frustrated by the low income possible at FantaCo and ached to work in special effects makeup, which he soon did, moving to the West Coast; I didn’t know Mario well enough to read what the mitigating factors might have been for him, if any. Tom was bitter about how this planned series didn’t pan out; it was a great-looking marketing package, the price seemed retail-friendly, and MARS ATTACKS was an ongoing fan favorite (this was a few years before the Tim Burton film, mind you, too). I was going to let Tom down about a year later when I walked away from the planned NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD comics series, still without any contract despite FantaCo heavily marketing, signing with St. Martin’s Press for a mass-market edition, etc., putting the cart before the horse.

Reminder: TOXIC AVENGER was among the last of the ‘midnight movies’ and the breakthrough title from NYC cheapjack producers Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Hertz’s Troma Studios; it was originally unrated, and was severely cut to get an ‘R’ rating for wider theatrical and video release.

This action figure of one of the Brood should join the ALIEN toys in the collection; the correlations are obvious. BTW, at the time of the Brood storyline in X-Men the comic series, Claremont also had other X-Men characters infected with vampirism, writing himself into quite a corner…which he resolved by shamelessly stealing imagery and concepts from Rick Veitch’s “Abrasax and the Earthman” series, which has being serialized in EPIC Magazine (edited by Archie Goodwin). Rick was so far ahead of schedule that his original use of imagery/concepts Claremont ripped off (confirmed by EPIC editor Archie Goodman at the time) was published a month or two AFTER Claremont’s creative theft saw print in a dues-ex-machina X-MEN ANNUAL. This was the most blatant case of creative theft I ever witnessed in my lifetime in the comics industry, and Claremont was unapologetic. I later suffered my own variation at Marvel (from writer Bill Mantlo); more on that later and elsewhere. So, anyhoot, having this BROOD toy in the studio during my TYRANT years was a visual reminder why I had worked so hard to achieve creative autonomy – and why I wasn’t going back to the plantations if TYRANT failed.—S.B.]\n\nITEM 12 [09/11/2007]\n\nATF -5 /12\n\n[JURASSICPARK: ELECTRONIC UTAHRAPTOR “RIPPER” (With Screaming Sound and Kick-Slash Action!)

For about three years, the VSDA pursued these sorts of programming events to counter this wave, and this panel represents the culmination of those joint efforts. I aggressively moderated the ”Reel and Deal” event, in which filmmakers present (and signing): LANCE WEILER, PATRICK HASSON, TIM KELLY, along with VSDA organizers BRUCE APAR, CELESTE, etc.\n\nThough signed in permanent marker, the slick surface of the poster makes it easy to wipe off the marker -- HANDLE WITH CARE, and I hope this makes it to the collection intact!—S.B.]\n\nATF-11 / 02 [Added 11/07/2007]\n\nMiniature alien figure from Close Encounters of the Third Kind: Special Edition, plastic, ½ inch tall, circa 1979.\n\n[REALLY RARE, TINY ITEM!: Original plastic ‘alien’ figure used in the special effects miniatures for the Mothership interiors of Steven Spielberg’s CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION (circa 1979; the “SPECIAL EDITION” re-release debuted theatrically in 1980) -- When Spielberg revamped his 1977 hit CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND to create the expanded “Special Edition” for theatrical re-release, special effects sequences added to the climax gave audiences a glimpse to the previously-unseen interior of the Mothership. Standing inside that vast Douglas Trumbull special effects creation were hundreds of THESE tiny plastic alien figures. Yes, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ACTUAL FIGURES!

Dan later did all the repairs, renovations, and woodwork on my trailer studio on Lower Dover Road in Marlboro, VT (where I worked approx. 1988 until September of 1993). Unfortunately, the fake ‘gold leaf’ stecil work of the configuration has chipped and cracked over the years, but this has been a fixture of my studio and/or household bookshelves since Dan gave it to me in ’87.—S.B.]\n\nATF-11 / 04 [Added 11/07/2007]\n\nLaminators Neon Monster: The Mummy model, sealed in original package, Monogram, 1991.\n\n[LUMINATORS Neon Monsters: THE MUMMY (Monogram, 1991) -- Monogram “Glow in the Dark” recasting of the original 1962 Aurora monster model kit, recast in transparent ‘glow in the dark’ plastic.

Let me explain: First off, STARSHIP TROOPERSS the movie (1997, directed by Paul Verhoeven) was an unlikely candidate for licensing as children’s toys: adapted form the controversial Robert Heinlein sf classic novel, it was an explicitly violent, gory, R-rated militaristic sf epic with a savage satiric edge (parodying militarism and fascism by reveling in it, and in the bloody interstellar war at its core of human vs. an alien insect race). Nevertheless, just before the film opened, this imaginative and very cool line of action figures were in all the toy stores, based on stop-motion and CGI animator Phil Tipett’s special effects creations for film (see my interview with Phil Tippett in ANIMATO, in the collection). My son Dan and I snapped them up, and we were glad we did: once the film opened, horrified parents complained and nervous chain-toy-store managers removed them from the shelves in haste. This great line of monster toys vanished in a flurry of bargain-bin blowout sales. For me, they were also of interest as a 1990s revamp of the 1962 monster insect toy line HAMILTON’S INVADERS, which featured three ‘giant insect’ monsters and an array of futuristic sf ‘space warrior’ war figures and weaponary. I have ONE item form the HAMILTON’S INVADERS line left in my collection, which will be coming in a future package. They were clearly inspired by the Heinlein novel -- though of course no mention was made of that -- and anticipated both the MARS ATTACKS card set (Topps) and the STARSHIP TROOPERS “Action Fleet” monster-insect-and-military-figures line.

Among my family’s favorite ‘kids monster movies’ of the 1980s were Joe Dante’s GREMLINS and GREMLINS 2. Maia and Daniel loved both films, and we searched high and low for the toys and action figures, though they are few and far between. For every one the kids got, I picked u p a duplicate to display in my studio. Lucky you, they’re all on their way. Director Joe Dante (and screen writer Chris Columbus, who went on to make the first two HARRY POTTER films, among many others) is a key figure in my life, having written for my two favorite monster magazines (FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND and especially CASTLE OF FRANKENSTEIN) in the 1960s and early ‘70s before breaking into filmmaking (co-directing HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, 1976, and launching his solo-directing career with PIRANHA, 1978, and THE HOWLING, 1981). He is among my all-time favorite American filmmakers (born November, 1946, in Morristown, NJ, near the home of the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art in Dover, NJ, where I was schooled in cartooning!). I’ve interview Joe (for my book project TRASH CHIC, forthcoming), too, which was a rare pleasure.
