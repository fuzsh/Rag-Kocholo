This heartwarming tale now charms a new generation of families and fans with its exquisite animation, unforgettable songs and one of the greatest love stories of all time. This is the night to share a special bella notte with your family and introduce them to this timeless classic.\n\n© 1955 Disney Enterprises, Inc.\n\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance\n\nRobert Redford directed this adaptation of a novel by Steven Pressfield that uses golf as a metaphor for one man's spiritual and philosophical journeys. Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) was a gifted amateur golfer from Savannah, GA, until traumatic experiences during World War I shattered his confidence and sent him into a spiral of alcoholism. In 1931, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), a beautiful heiress who once loved Junuh, inherits a spectacular but financially ailing golf course after the suicide of her father. To attract customers, she proposed a high-stakes match between the two most famous golfers of the day, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). Local businessmen sponsoring the match insist that a local golfer be added to the card, and Junuh is drafted for the position, but it soon becomes obvious that his game is just a shadow of its former glory. When things seem hopeless, a mysterious gentleman named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) volunteers to serve as Junuh's caddy and coach, using a mixture of ancient wisdom and past-life knowledge to help Junuh “remember\" the swing he's lost. Jack Lemmon narrates the story, and J. Michael Moncrief plays Lemmon's character as a boy.\n\n© 2000 Dreamworks LLC.

Top Gun takes a look at the danger and excitement that awaits every pilot at the Navy's prestigious fighter weapons school. Tom Cruise is superb as Lt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a daring young flyer who's out to become the best.

Selznick’s acclaimed screen adaptation of Margaret Mitchell’s best-selling novel tells of the romance between the tempestuous Scarlett O’Hara (Vivien Leigh) and the dashing Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), against the tragic backdrop of the Civil War. This legendary classic earned 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress, (Leigh) Best Director (Victor Fleming), and Best Supporting Actress to Hattie McDaniel, the first Oscar ever awarded to an African American performer. One of the highest-grossing films of all time (when adjusted for inflation), it is also very much a product of its time, and unfortunately reflects depictions of characters and themes which are offensive and problematic when viewed by contemporary audiences. The film is presented here as originally released in 1939, because to do otherwise would be the equivalent of stating the prejudices and attitudes never existed.\n\n1939 GONE WITH THE WIND, its characters and elements are trademarks of Turner Entertainment Co. & The Stephens Mitchell Trusts. © Turner Entertainment Co.\n\nThe Notebook\n\nBehind every great love is a great story.
