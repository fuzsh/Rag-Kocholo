        "text": "NEW YORK, NY (April 6, 2023) – Shudder, AMC Networks’ premiere streaming service for horror, thriller and the supernatural is acquiring QUICKSAND, directed by Andrés Beltrán (TARUMAMA, MALAYERBA), written by Matt Pitts (WESTWORLD), and starring Carolina Gaitán (ENCANTO, NARCOS) and Allan Hawco (JACK RYAN, REPUBLIC OF DOYLE). Territories include U.S., UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and are set to premiere on the service on June 23, 2023. The film will also stream on AMC+ where available (US, CA, ANZ).\n\nThe English-language film, which was shot entirely in Bogota, Colombia, follows an American couple on the brink of divorce who travel to Colombia for a work conference. While on a hike through the rainforest, a storm causes them to become trapped in a pit of quicksand. Unable to move, it becomes a struggle for survival as they battle the elements of the jungle and a venomous snake in order to escape.\n\nQUICKSAND was produced by Sangre Films, which is a joint venture between Colombian outfit Elemental Stories and U.S. companies 222 Pictures and Dawn’s Light Movies, produced by Jason Cherubini, Nicolás Reyes, Sean Patrick Burke and executive produced by Richard Switzer, Martin Ramos, John Harris and Kris Meyer.\n\nDirector Andrés Beltrán said, “Making QUICKSAND was such a thrilling and challenging experience. I hope people can relate to the intense emotions Carolina and Allan portrayed so well. We shot the film on location, in a cold forest in the mountains of Colombia. Although the weather conditions were harsh for the actors and crew, we kept enjoying the process because we wanted to tell this story as real as possible.”\n\nProducer Jason Cherubini added, “This has been such an exciting project to be a part of. Working with the Colombian crew was amazing and seeing the very talented Carolina Gaitan and Allan Hawco bring the vision of our director Andres Beltran to life has been a fantastic experience. I can’t wait for audiences to experience it.”\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Emily Gotto on behalf of Shudder and Altitude Film Sales’ Mike Runagall on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\nShudder continues to be at the forefront of curating many of the most exciting and critically-lauded independent and international genre films, including the recent viral hit, Skinamarink from director Kyle Edward Ball’s, Jayro Bustamante’s La Llorona and Joko Anwar’s Impetigore (both official selections for the 2021 International Oscar race), Richard Stanley’s Color Out of Space, Josh Ruben’s Scare Me, Jeff Barnaby’s Blood Quantum, Coralie Fargeat’s Revenge, Issa Lopez’s Tigers Are Not Afraid and Shinichiro Ueda’s One Cut of the Dead. The service has also garnered attention for its original programming including the breakout hit series “Creepshow” under showrunner Greg Nicotero, Jay Cheel’s “Cursed Films” and the acclaimed documentary Horror Noire: A History Of Black Horror. Upcoming films include the critically-acclaimed Sundance breakout birth/rebirth directed by Laura Moss and the latest installment in the anthology franchise V/H/S/85, including segments from David Bruckner,Scott Derrickson, Mike P.
