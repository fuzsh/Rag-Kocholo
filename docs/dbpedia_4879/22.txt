QUICKSAND is a "bromantic comedy" about two best friends embarking on a treacherous road trip after losing their best friend's wedding ring days before the ceremony. Their quest accelerates into a loud exploration of life, love, and how to not die.

Much of QUICKSAND was filmed and produced in northern Michigan, and it’ll be released on Apple TV September 19. But before then, the film will embark on a whirlwind 10-city Michigan theatrical tour.

The tour opens with a showing at the City Opera House in Traverse City on September 7, and will also include showings at the Vogue Theatre in Manistee and the Garden Theatre in Frankfort.

"Everything about this (film) was a surprise, including getting distribution after the Austin Film Festival and then being given a release of September 19 – it's just one surprise after another," says QUICKSAND director JohnPaul Morris.

Morris said the film has a chance of getting on a streaming platform like Netflix or Hulu, but first he and his team have to prove audiences want to watch a film out of northern Michigan. That's the idea behind the Michigan theatrical release tour.

"When we're out there, we're going to let people know that the single greatest way they can support the film is to pre-order it," Morris said. "That is a huge metric that these platforms are looking at to see whether or not people are paying attention."
