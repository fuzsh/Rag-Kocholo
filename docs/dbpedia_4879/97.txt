Helmed by Traverse City-based director JohnPaul Morris, QUICKSAND is an action-comedy about best friends Ray (Tanner Presswood) and Paul (Simon Elias) who lose their best friend’s wedding ring just days before the ceremony. Their treacherous road trip to retrieve the ring accelerates into a loud exploration of life, love, and how to not die.

The movie was filmed primarily in the greater Traverse City area, Grand Rapids, and parts of the Upper Peninsula. It premiered to FOUR sold out shows at the Traverse City Film Festival in 2022, and then continued the momentum, WINNING the Eau Claire International, then the top audience choice award at Hell's Half Mile, best screenplay at the Grand Rapids Film Festival, and acceptance into prestigious festivals like the Austin Film Festival.

QUICKSAND continues its success now with a distribution deal through Gravitas Ventures, securing A RELEASE DATE of SEPTEMBER 19th that the film is building toward with an 11 theater, 100+ screening tour throughout Michigan. The award winning Michigan-made film is showing in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Holland, Port Huron, Marquette, Escanaba, Iron Mountain, Manistee, MANISTIQUE, Sault Ste Marie, and Frankfort.

QUICKSAND will be available on iTunes, Amazon, and several other VOD platforms for purchase or rental.

When we set out to make this scrappy, Michigan-made “Bromantic Comedy” we had no idea the journey would take us so far, that there’d be such a response to the film, that we’d get into the festivals we found ourselves at, that our “local film” would be winning awards, and that we’d get all the way to landing a distribution deal! We’re beyond excited to have signed a deal that allows us to release the film, and be able to say that it’s coming to a screen near you, large or small. This is big news, and a big victory for northern Michigan made films.

The film has a running time of 94 MINUTES, and an unofficial rating of PG-13, considering mild language, some violence, and tense situations.
