Adrianne Curry and Brady Bunch actor Christopher Knight have announced that they are separating.

The couple's split was confirmed on Sunday, May 29, their fifth wedding anniversary.

The stars' manager Phil Viardo claimed that Curry and Knight need time apart in order to ponder whether their relationship can be salvaged.

"Actor Christopher Knight and his wife, model and television star Adrianne Curry, have announced today on their five-year wedding anniversary that they are separatingâ€¦ They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort," Viardo said in a statement to Hollyscoop.

"The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future."

Curry's only post on her official Twitter account in the past several hours seemed to indicate that she planned to celebrate her wedding anniversary over the Memorial Day weekend.

"May 29th, 2006 I married Christopher Anton Knight. Enjoy your weekend! I certainly am!!! (sic)," the former America's Next Top Model winner wrote.

Knight and Curry met while taking part in reality series The Surreal Life in 2005 and later starred in their own spinoff program My Fair Brady after they began dating.

The pair married in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois in 2006.
