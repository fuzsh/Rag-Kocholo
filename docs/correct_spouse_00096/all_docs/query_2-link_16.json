        "text": "Girls who never grew out of their crush on Peter Brady could very well have a chance with him now. Christopher Knight, who played the iconic middle son on the Brady Bunch, filed for divorce from model and reality TV star Adrianna Curry last week. The split doesn't come as a surprise to divorce attorneys in Pasadena, who heard months ago that the pair was headed for a breakup.\n\nIt seemed like a match made in reality television heaven. In early 2005, Knight met Curry, the winner of the first season of America's Next Top Model, on the fourth season of VH1's Surreal Life. The pair's romance and attraction on the show was well-chronicled and closely followed. Knight and Curry went on to star in three seasons of My Fair Brady, a reality show that followed the famous couple's romance. The first season ended with Knight proposing to Curry; the pair was married in May of 2006 in her hometown of Joliet, Illinois.\n\nBut whispers of trouble for the pair started in 2010. By May 2011, the couple announced their separation on the fifth anniversary of their wedding.\n\n\"After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated,\" their manager, Phil Viardo, said in a statement to our sources. \"The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union.\"\n\nMany, including Knight's onscreen mother Florence Henderson, didn't think the couple was built to last. The outspoken Mrs. Brady raised eyebrows in 2008 when she told the couple not to get married after they sought her advice.\n\n\"They didn't take my advice at all!\" said Henderson. \"And as you may have seen, they did get engaged and they did get married. Maybe I will counsel the divorce.\"\n\nThis was Curry's first marriage and Knight's third. They have no children."
