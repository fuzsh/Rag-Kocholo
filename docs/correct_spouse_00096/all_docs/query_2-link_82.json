        "text": "From Wikipedia:\n\nChristopher Anton Knight (born November 7, 1957) is an American actor best known for playing Peter Brady on the 1970s series, The Brady Bunch. He has since gone on to become a successful businessman and enjoyed a semi-resurgence in the public eye with television appearances in the 2000s. His father, Edward Knight, was also an actor.\n\nPersonal life\n\nKnight proposed to Adrianne Curry on the season finale of My Fair Brady, on VH1, which aired on November 6, 2005. The show was renewed for a second season that began in June, 2006, and focused on the couple's wedding preparations. The couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois on May 29, 2006, in a gothic-style wedding. In a September 2007 episode of the talk show Dr. Phil dealing with large age gaps in relationships Curry and Knight appeared to discuss their marital issues with Dr. Phil McGraw. McGraw predicted that their style of arguing, particularly Knight's hurtful comments, was a strong predictor of impending divorce in couples. Knight's manager, Phil Viardo, told a celebrity gossip website on May 29, 2011, that Knight and his wife, Curry, were announcing their separation. The date was the couple's fifth wedding anniversary. On February 2, 2012, on G4's Attack of the Show, Curry said the divorce had been finalized."
