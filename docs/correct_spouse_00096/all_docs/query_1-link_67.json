        "text": "What's Trending to Offer Daily Fix of YouTube's Finest\n\nGood news, YouTube addicts! What's Trending with Shira Lazar has increased the dosage of your favorite viral videos, news and social commentary. The Emmy-nominated live weekly web series will air daily on YouTube, starting Monday at noon PT/3 ET. \"When we aired once a week, we had to choose the biggest stuff that was out there and sacrifice the smaller things that we still loved,\" CEO Damon Berger told TVGuide.com. \"So now, every day you're going to get literally the best of what YouTube has to offer from video in a kind of condensed way.\"\n\nFrom One Bachelorette to Another: Ali Advises Ashley to Make Good Friends\n\nWhat is the biggest piece of advice previous Bachelorette Ali Fedotowsky has for Ashley Hebert? Make friends! \"Ashley is moving to New York and that could be hard for her because all [J.P.'s] friends are there, his life is there and she needs to blend in,\" Ali tells TVGuide.com. \"Roberto and I definitely had our moments where we were at each other's throats because ... we only had each other.

Reflecting on Flo's rant, Knight says, \"I don't know what she was thinking,\" deeming Henderson determined to \"be public with her disbelief of my marriage.\" In the end, Knight was forced to choose, and he goes into detail about that decision at the video's end. &#151; Matt Mitovich\n\nTop Model &quot;Crying Foul&quot; Over Saleisha's Win\n\nAnd surprisingly, the Top Model doing so isn't runner-up Chantal but Cycle 1 victor Adrianne Curry, the Playboy covergirl and black sheep of Tyra Banks' catwalking contest. On her MySpace blog, Mrs. Peter Brady suggests that \"not only has [Saleisha] modeled before (Wendy's commercials, Tyra Banks Show runway model) but... she also had a personal relationship with Tyra from being in her T-Zone camp. According to my contract with Top Model, all of these things would keep you from even coming on the show, let alone win it.\"I agree with the majority in saying that this is not fair,\" Curry continues, adding, \"I didn't think that they chose the girl who could actually model... but then I remembered that they are nine seasons into this show and have yet to be successful in making a real Top Model.\" Meow! Though Curry goes on to say that \"if I had been one of the other contestants, I would be crying foul everywhere I went,\" she is confident that Miss Tyra \"will do the right thing in this si..."
