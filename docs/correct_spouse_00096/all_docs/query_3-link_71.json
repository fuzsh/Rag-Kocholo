The show appears to have originated from a Season 4 episode of The Surreal Life, during which each cast member pitched a TV show idea to network executives. Adrianne’s concept, which she called Beauty and the Brady, was a show about her and Knight’s then-fledgling romance, in which she would attempt to convince Knight to marry her. Within that episode, Adrianne’s idea was passed over in favor of that of castmate Da Brat, but the latter’s show never came to fruition.”\n\nNOTE: The streaming services listed above are subject to change.
