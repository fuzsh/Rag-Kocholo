        "text": "Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries\n\nThey said it wouldn't last—and they were right. After 72 days, Kim Kardashian's fairy-tale marriage to Kris Humphries did not have a happy ending. Those who tuned in to E's two-part four-hour special—which the network re-aired this week to capitalize on the divorce announcement —got a glimpse of trouble even before the couple walked down the aisle. \"I have been planning my wedding since I was 10 years old!\" Kim shouted at Kris. His charming response? \"And you could just slot any guy into it!\" Which is apparently true, as a source close to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians production told Radar Online, \"It was pretty much an arranged marriage right from the start. Kim was looking for a husband, and Kris was selected for her, amongst others. She wasn't really into him, but she hoped she would be able to develop some feelings. But it never happened.\" So he was canceled.\n\nHeidi Montag and Spencer Pratt\n\nThe marriage of Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt has had all the classic plot twists—a fake elopement, a made-for-TV wedding (which she later deemed \"a nightmare\"), a fake separation (to boost her career), and an eventual renewal of wedding vows. \"It's just me and my bride on a little secret beach with nobody else, and it's just about her,\" Pratt said after the third ceremony. \"Last time it was about everything else, it was about drama, it was about ratings.\" The couple then released a wedding photo to the media.\n\nRob Mariano and Amber Brkich\n\nAfter debuting as a great reality-TV villain, Rob Mariano flipped the script on the first episode of Survivor: All Stars and fell in love with fellow contestant Amber Brkich. The two formed an alliance, taking it all the way to the live season finale, during which Amber won the million-dollar prize and \"Boston\" Rob, the season runner-up, got down on one knee and asked her to marry him. One year later, Rob and Amber were wed in the Bahamas in a two-hour CBS special. And after six years of marriage, the couple have two children and are still married. Survivors indeed.\n\nVanessa Minnillo and Nick Lachey\n\nFor three seasons on MTV, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson shared their lives as newlyweds. Nine months after the final season, however, the couple filed for divorce. But that experience didn't stop Lachey from letting TV cameras in on his second marriage. In July 2011, Lachey traded MTV for TLC and wed his longtime girlfriend, Vanessa Minnillo, in a two-hour special filmed in the British Virgin Islands. \"Having done reality TV in the past, I didn't necessarily want to jump right back into it without having thought it through to great length, and we did,\" Lachey said at the time. \"Vanessa and my wedding is for us, for the people in our lives who are close to us and mean a lot to us,\" he said. \"That's the way we wanted it, and I'm happy we're able to do it that way.\"\n\nChristopher Knight and Adrianne Curry\n\nHere's the story—of a guy who played Peter Brady. When actor Christopher Knight appeared on season four of VH1's The Surreal Life, he fell in love with Adrianne Curry, the first winner of America's Next Top Model. The network gave them a spin-off—My Fair Brady—and in the show's second season, Knight married Curry in a Gothic ceremony in Curry's hometown. Alas, the couple announced they were separating on May 29, 2011—their fifth wedding anniversary.\n\nTrista Rehn and Ryan Sutter\n\nIn 15 seasons of The Bachelor, not one man has gone on to marry the woman he selected in the final. (Though season 13's Jason Mesnick did wed runner-up Molly Malaney in a TV ceremony.) But on the very first season of The Bachelorette, Trista Rehn, the runner-up on season one of The Bachelor, fell for Colorado firefighter Ryan Sutter and married him on an ABC special watched by an astonishing 26 million in December 2003. Though Trista eventually became the first contestant voted off the very first season of Dancing With the Stars, her marriage to Ryan had a better fate—they are still together and have two children.\n\nMiss Vicki and Tiny Tim\n\nMore than 40 years before Kim Kardashian said \"I do\" on television, \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" crooner Tiny Tim wed fan Victoria Budinger on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In a bizarre ceremony watched by more than 21 million, the 37-year-old singer married 17-year-old \"Miss Vicki\" on December 17, 1969—which, at the time was the second-highest-rated television show of all time. But five years later, he returned to the Tonight Show and revealed that the marriage was having its problems. \"Miss Vicki left again this January,\" Tiny Tim told Carson. \"This time she said goodbye in person; the first time she just ran off with somebody else.\" Three years later, the curtain came down forever on their marriage.\n\nKhloé Kardashian and Lamar Odom\n\nAfter dating for only a month, Khloé Kardashian wed Los Angeles Lakers forward Lamar Odom before 250 friends and family in a ceremony filmed for Keeping Up With the Kardashians. The couple soon had their own reality TV show, but when it came time for her older sister to fast-break down the aisle with an NBA player, Khloé was supportive but not optimistic. On the Today show, Kathie Lee Gifford claimed that Khloé whispered to her at Kim's wedding, \"I give it six f--king months.\" Which, in retrospect, was optimistic.\n\nCarmen Electra and Dave Navarro\n\nBeing married to Dennis Rodman for less than six months didn't discourage Carmen Electra from finding lasting love again. Four years after her divorce from Rodman, Electra documented her engagement to musician Dave Navarro on MTV's 'Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen & Dave. But death came early to their marriage. Less than three years later, the couple announced they were separating amicably. As Electra told People: \"We talk every day. We're still really good friends. ... We're positive, and we've stayed connected. It's okay.\"\n\nDiana Spencer and Prince Charles\n\nThough the 1981 wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles didn't exactly begin as a made-for-TV affair, it was watched by an estimated audience of 750 million, the biggest live event in television history. And the cameras never left, which heavily contributed to the couple's divorce 16 years later. But Charles and Diana passed along the TV ratings gene to their son Prince William. His 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton was watched by 18.6 million U.S. households—which eclipsed Mum and Dad's American audience."
