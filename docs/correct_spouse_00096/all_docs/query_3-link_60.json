        "text": "Happy ten-year anniversary, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. It’s been a full decade since MTV took us inside the insipid lives of Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson; the August 19 pilot gave us “chicken of the sea,” and from then on there was no looking back. Still, despite that infamous moment and flashes of Simpson’s overspending and her parents’ chronic meddling, there was a surprising sense of normalcy and gentle sweetness to much of the first season.\n\nBut reality TV comes at a cost. And as Nick and Jessica taught us, that cost is usually one celebrity marriage. Here’s how some other celebreality couples fared in their wake, from longest lasting following the end of their show to shortest. (A note on methodology: This only includes shows about couples or families in which at least one member of the couple was already famous in some capacity; marriage end-dates are when one partner filed for divorce, not when the divorce was finalized.)\n\nAdrianne Curry and Christopher Knight, My Fair Brady\n\nLength of marriage: May 2006–August 2011\n\nLength of TV show: September 2005–March 2008\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Three years, five months\n\nBoth Curry and Knight had been on reality shows before this one — hell, they met on The Surreal Life — so while other couples were probably shaken by the lack of privacy reality TV affords, they seemed less so. Not that it mattered, really.\n\nDeion Sanders and Pilar Biggers, Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love\n\nLength of Marriage: May 1999–September 2011\n\nLength of TV show: April 2008–June 2008\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Three years, three months\n\nThe show itself was pretty boring. The divorce, however, was very acrimonious and took years to finalize.\n\nCarmen Electra and Dave Navarro, ’Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and Dave\n\nLength of marriage: November 2003–August 2006\n\nLength of TV show: January 2004–March 2004 (miniseries)\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Two years, five months\n\nMan, it really seemed like those two were a good match! Unfortunately, their one-off show only covered their wedding planning and not their heavily eye-linered marriage.\n\nBritney Spears and Kevin Federline, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\n\nLength of marriage: September 2004–November 2006\n\nLength of TV show: May 2005–June 2005 (miniseries)\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: One year, five months\n\nThis is probably the weirdest show on this list: Britney and Kevin shot the footage themselves, and thus the show was only marginally coherent.\n\nBobby Brown and Whitney Houston, Being Bobby Brown\n\nLength of marriage: July 1982–September 2006\n\nLength of TV show: June 2005–December 2005\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Nine months\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that this show was what ended things between Bobby and Whitney, given their often contentious history and mutual drug abuse. But the show did present an appallingly unflattering portrait of former pop-culture royalty.\n\nNick Lachey and Jessica Simpson, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica\n\nLength of marriage: October 2002–December 2005\n\nLength of TV show: August 2003–March 2005\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Nine months\n\nWere we ever so innocent? Newlyweds came on the heels of The Osbournes, at a time when it seemed like reality TV could merely show us the quirkier side of celebrity.\n\nBethenny Frankel and Jason Hoppy, Bethenny Ever After\n\nLength of Marriage: March 2010–January 2013\n\nLength of TV show: June 2010–May 2012\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Eight months\n\nThere aren’t any other Real Housewives on this list, since those shows don’t meet our criteria, but trust: A whole bunch of them got divorced during and after their appearances on the various franchises. Bethenny just happened to be one of the few with a spinoff series.\n\nTravis Barker and Shanna Moakler, Meet the Barkers\n\nLength of marriage: October 2004–August 2006, but they were on-and-off until the end of 2008 or so\n\nLength of TV show: April 2005–February 2006\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Six months, but again, they kept getting back together\n\nIf you’re making a 2005 time capsule, put this show in it. There are TRL appearances, flip phones galore, and so much chitchat about MySpace you’ll wonder how we ever endured this era.\n\nDanny Bonaduce and Gretchen Hillmer, Breaking Bonaduce\n\nLength of marriage: November 1994–April 2007\n\nLength of TV show: September 2005–December 2006\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: Four months\n\nLike Hogan, Breaking Bonaduce ushered in the end of a pretty long marriage. Unlike Hogan, Bonaduce was jarring and sad from the get-go, and more than wanting to watch the show, we wanted to get everyone into more and better therapy.\n\nHulk and Linda Hogan, Hogan Knows Best\n\nLength of marriage: December 1983–November 2007\n\nLength of TV show: July 2005–October 2007\n\nTime between end of show and end of marriage: One month\n\nAt first, Hogan was pretty charming. By the end, though, the writing was on the bleached-and-bandana’d wall, and in the months after the show ended, the family seemingly imploded."
