        "text": "(HawaiiNewsNow) - The \"separation\" is over and now former \"Brady Bunch\" star Christopher Knight has finally filed for a divorce from his reality star wife, Adrianne Curry. Back in May the two announced they were separating to rethink the marriage -- but now, it appears Knight has reached a decision and he wants out. Knight married the \"Top Model\" winner five years ago after they co-starred on \"The Surreal Life\" together.\n\nParis Hilton's latest reality TV stint is coming to an end. The World According to Paris has been canceled and will not return for a second season.\n\nBethenny Frankel's Bethenny Goes to LA will be airing this fall -- and it's the last Bethenny reality TV show we'll probably see. But a source says Bethenny is getting her own talk show. And producers are said to be very happy with the pilot. The source says Bethenny is \"the next great talk host.\"\n\nGlee star Jane Lynch has revealed how she was addicted to cold medicine. The 51-year-old actress said she was so depressed that she sought 'happy oblivion' by downing bottles of the NyQuil syrup. The over-the-counter medicine contains alcohol and if taken in sufficient quantities has the same effect as drinking."
