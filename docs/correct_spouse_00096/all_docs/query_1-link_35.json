        "text": "(CBS) Their marriage was a relationship made in reality TV heaven, but now Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight are calling it quits.\n\nCurry, who won the first season of \"America's Next Top Model,\" and Knight, who played Peter Brady on \"The Brady Bunch,\" announced on Sunday that they are separating. The statement came on the couple's fifth wedding anniversary.\n\nPictures: Celebrity splits\n\n\"Actor Christopher Knight and his wife, model and television star Adrianne Curry have announced today on their five-year wedding anniversary that they are separating,\" the couple's manager, Phil Viardo, said in a statement to HollyScoop.com. \"After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated. The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in.\"\n\n\"Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort,\" the statement continued. \"The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future. Both Knight and Curry decided to release this joint announcement today in order to preempt any potential rumors and gossip and ask that their fans and the media respect their privacy during this delicate period.\"\n\nThe marriage was Curry's first, and Knight's third. They had no children.\n\nCurry, 28, and Knight, 53, met when they both starred on the fourth season of VH1's reality series \"The Surreal Life.\" Their romance continued on the spin-off \"My Fair Brady,\" which chronicled their engagement, wedding and married life over three seasons."
