        "text": "Another reality TV couple bites the dust? On their fifth wedding anniversary, Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight announced that they are splitting, according to Hollyscoop.\n\n\"After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated,\" read part of the statement issued by their manager, Phil Viardo. \"The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in.\"\n\nWatch Curry and Knight discuss their relationship\n\nThe statement does suggest, though, that reconciliation is a possibility: \"They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort. The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future.\"\n\nChristopher Knight: I had to choose between my wife and Brady mom"
