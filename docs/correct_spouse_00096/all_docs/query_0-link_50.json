        "text": "EPISODE 1\n\nA Brady, a Lady, a Kiss and a Flo\n\nChris wants Adrianne to prove to him that she is independent and can change her wild ways before becoming wife material. But, Adrianne wants a commitment, ring and all. Then THE KISS!!! At a birthday party for Jane Weidlin, Chris cracks and commits what could be a critical mistake. He swaps spit with the former Go-Go, who is Adrianne's best friend. This will be the kiss that goes down in infamy. Adrianne is furious that Chris disrespected her. She can't get the image out of her head, \"I saw tongue!\" Is their relationship licked? Or, perhaps a visit from Florence Henderson a.k.a. Mrs. Brady, a real licensed therapist, can help them out. Florence pulls Chris aside and tells him that they are doomed unless Adrianne moves out and becomes an independent person. Is this the end of the relationship before the show has even begun?\n\n37 min Â· Nov 9, 2005 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 2\n\nValentine's Day\n\nAlthough still reeling from overhearing Florence Henderson's suggestion to Chris that they shouldn't live together, Adrianne is starting to see flaws in their relationship. Chris isn't a very romantic boyfriend and she feels like she is making most of the effort. So, Adrianne's brings up an issue that has been eating at her for some time: Chris forgot Valentine's Day. He doesn't see what the big deal is and thinks she's being overly demanding. But after Adrianne heads off to a photo shoot, Chris has second thoughts and hatches a romantic plan to make it up to her. While Adrianne is plying her trade as a model wearing wedding dresses of all things, Chris goes all out and tries to sweep his girl off her feet with flowers, dinner, chocolate and champagne. Adrianne is deeply touched by these thoughtful gestures until Chris puts his foot in his mouth at dinner and reveals to her that he agrees with Florence's suggestion, she needs to move out \"in order for them to have a healthy relationship.\" Adrianne is crushed and sobbing tells Chris that their relationship will be over if she moves out. So much for a romantic evening.\n\n19 min Â· Sep 18, 2005 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 3\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Shower\n\nChris has relentlessly told Adrianne how good for their relationship it would be if she moved out of his apartment and got her own place -- he just wants her to establish her own identity away from him, but for her it sounds like he's kicking her out. No longer feeling welcome in his home, Adrianne tells him she's buying her own car and looking for apartments while he's away on a personal trip. Having the reality of her leaving thrown in his face puts their day together under a lot of tension, so much so that he blows up at her over something as trivial as her leaving her bread in the bruschetta dip. They almost get to some make-up sex, when an unexpected pounding on the door interrupts them -- it's Adrianne's hometown friend Andrea. With Andrea in town, Chris is no longer the center of Adrianne's attention, and he doesn't like it. He leaves L.A. wondering what trouble the two girls are going to get into, and what trouble Andrea's presence here means for his relationship with Adrianne.\n\n18 min Â· Sep 25, 2005 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 4\n\nWhile the Brady's Away\n\nWith Chris out of town and her best friend, Andrea in for the weekend, Adrianne gains a new sense of independence. She proclaims, \"this is the weekend where I do whatever I want without somebody dictating to me and controlling my life.\" Her rebellion consists of buying a new car, a strict junk food diet and a good dose of man bashing. Adrianne is beginning to understand that maybe she really should move out, and then she can do whatever, whenever she pleases without Chris' constant criticism. Alone in paradise without his girl, Chris realizes he doesn't want Adrianne to move out of the house. He professes his newfound love and desire to commit. But will it be enough?\n\n19 min Â· Feb 10, 2005 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 5\n\nHomecoming\n\nAdrianne has decided enough is enough with Chris' wishy-washy ways. One day he wants her to get her own place and the next he can't imagine everyday life without her. What does he want? So Adrianne has decided that a little help from her family and friends is in order. She packs up her bags and Chris and heads for her hometown of Joliet, Illinois. On the way to the airport, Chris flip-flops again and tells her that they should buy a new house together; one that they can call their own. Argh?! Getting her family's opinion has now become even more important. First stop in Joliet is Adrianne's father. Chris is more than nervous about meeting her gigantic 6'9\" Harley riding, leather wearing Dad. Chris is fairly certain he'll impress until Adrianne's Dad greets him with, \"So you're the Hollywood playboy that stole my daughter's heart.\" Uh oh.\n\n18 min Â· Sep 10, 2005 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 6\n\nMeet My Mama\n\nDay two in Adrianne's hometown of Joliet, Illinois finds Chris spending quality time with her parents. Adrianne's Dad still hasn't made a decision about whether Chris has the right intentions towards his daughter so he invites Chris for a little \"guy time\" at the local lake. Chris ends up feeling like a fish out of water when Daddy insists that he do the right thing and marry Adrianne. Gulp! Adrianne also consults her Mom for advice on the relationship, telling her that she wants the family to check him out and give their approval. Hoping to make a good impression on the rest of the Curry Clan, Chris attends a family barbecue, which becomes more of an autograph session for the former child-star leaving little time for anyone to form an impression. When Adrianne decides they need to get away from the family and spend some alone time with her mother, Chris jokingly makes some off-handed remarks that leave Mama Curry in tears. Can Chris ever get it right?\n\n18 min Â· Oct 16, 2005 TV-14"
