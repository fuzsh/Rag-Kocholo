        "text": "By Tiffany Moore\n\nWhiteflash.com custom designed one-of-a-kind wedding bands for the upcoming nuptials of Adrianne Curry, winner of America's Next Top Model, and Christopher Knight, of Brady Bunch fame. The two met on the set of VH1's Surreal Life last year and have been heading toward wedded bliss ever since. Whiteflash.com, a diamond and jewelry e-boutique, was heralded by Kiplinger's Magazine as \"Lord of the Online Rings.\" The company's world-renowned jewelry artisans handcrafted the famous couple's wedding bands.\n\n\"We wanted to create something for them that is truly show stopping. For Adrianne, it was important that we design a unique band that complements her engagement ring,\" says Debi Wexler, co-founder and CEO of Whiteflash.com.\n\nWexler embarked on the e-diamond business in 2000 and have since grown the company to a global customer base. Working one-on-one with the couple by phone and via email, designers created a simplistic design for Knight - a 3.5 mm half round band cast in 950 platinum. For Curry, it is a curvaceous (950 platinum) design that plays up to her engagement ring from the Sirena Collection by Merit Diamonds.\n\nCurry, now a noted fashionista who models for the likes of Macy's, Merit Diamonds, Famous Stars and Straps, and Ed Hardy, amongst numerous others says, \"I was amazed by the clarity of the diamonds and originality of the designs Whiteflash.com shared with me. It was difficult to narrow it down to just one!\" Whiteflash.com sent several samples to the soon-to-be Mrs. Knight to show the company's capability in custom designed settings and the sparkle emitted from the company's a Whiteflash A Cut Above diamonds.\n\n\"Our customers typically are 'wowed' by the quality of our diamonds,\" says Wexler, \"because they simply out-sparkle the competition.\" Just which design made the final cut? Spiraling gracefully down the shank of Curry's band - measuring 3.8 mm wide at the top and then tapering to 2.5 mm at the base - are six .20 carat Whiteflash A Cut Above diamonds from the company's exclusive brand of Hearts & Arrows diamonds. \"Hearts & Arrows refers to the pattern seen through the top and bottom of the diamond,\" says Wexler, \"which signifies the highest level of cut quality.\"\n\nAll 57 facets of an Whiteflash A Cut Above diamond align perfectly to maximize the diamond's ability to attract and reflect light. \"Light, even diffused by office lighting and soft candlelight, reflects from inside the crown (or top) of the diamond, from facet to facet, and then out of the crown again,\" says Wexler. She adds, \"This is what enables our diamonds to really sparkle.\" And for Whiteflash A Cut Above diamonds, sparkle is what they do best.\n\nWhiteflash.com is the only jeweler in the country to back their Hearts & Arrows diamond with an elite true patterning guarantee, meeting presentation criteria Whiteflash set forth at the International Diamond Cut Conference (IDCC). \"Fewer than one in a million diamonds are cut to Hearts & Arrows precision and only the most elite carry the Whiteflash A Cut Above guarantee,\" says Wexler."
