        "text": "What is Christopher Knight's Net Worth?\n\nChristopher Knight is an American actor, producer, and businessman who has a net worth of $10 million dollars. Knight is most widely recognized for his work as Peter Brady on the hugely successful 1970s sitcom \"The Brady Bunch\" (1969–1974).\n\nHe took time away from television for a number of years and focused on business pursuits, but he returned to TV in the early 2000s with appearances on various reality shows, including \"The Surreal Life\" (2005) and \"My Fair Brady\" (2005–2008). Christopher starred in the web series \"Building Brady\" (2018–2019) and the HGTV series \"A Very Brady Renovation\" (2019), which both focused on \"The Brady Bunch\" cast renovating their former TV home. He also served as a producer on \"My Fair Brady\" and the 2007 TV documentary \"Chris & Adrianne Do Russia.\" In 2012, Knight launched the online furniture brand Christopher Knight Home, and he expanded the company to include a lifestyle brand in 2018.\n\nEarly Life\n\nChristopher Knight was born Christopher Anton Knight on November 7, 1957, in New York City. His mother, Wilma, was Jewish, and his father, Edward (an actor), originally had the surname Kozumplik and was born to parents from Austria-Hungary. Christopher has three siblings, David, Mark, and Lisa, and the family moved to Los Angeles when he was 3 years old. His father sought auditions for Christopher and Mark in order to save money for their college educations. Knight graduated from El Camino Real Charter High School in 1975, then he attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.\n\nActing Career\n\nAt age 7, Christopher began appearing in commercials for companies like Cheerios, Tide, and Toyota. In the late '60s, he guest-starred on \"Mannix\" (1967) and \"Gunsmoke\" (1968), and in 1969, he began starring as Peter Brady on the ABC sitcom \"The Brady Bunch,\" thanks to the fact that his looks were similar to those of Robert Reed, who had been cast as father Mike Brady. The series aired 117 episodes over five seasons, and Knight reprised his role in \"The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie\" (1972), \"The Brady Kids\" (1972), \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" (1976–1977), \"The Brady Girls Get Married\" (1981), \"A Very Brady Christmas\" (1988), \"Day by Day\" (1989), and \"The Bradys\" (1990). In 2005, Christopher was ranked #20 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Kid Stars\" list, and he also hosted the special. After \"The Brady Bunch\" ended, Knight guest-starred on \"One Day at a Time\" (1976), \"The Bionic Woman\" (1977), \"Happy Days\" (1978), and \"CHiPs\" (1978), and he made his film debut in 1979's \"Just You and Me, Kid.\" He appeared in the television films \"Diary of a Teenage Hitchhiker\" (1979) and \"Valentine Magic on Love Island\" (1980) and guest-starred on \"Another World\" (1981) and \"The Love Boat\" (1984), and he played Steve Wabash on NBC's \"Joe's World\" from 1979 to 1980.\n\nChristopher appeared in the films \"Curfew\" (1989), \"Good Girls Don't\" (1993), and \"Nowhere\" (1997), and he played a coach in \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" (1995). In 1994, he was defeated by Danny Bonaduce of \"The Partridge Family\" during a wrestling \"Dark Match\" at World Championship Wrestling's Spring Stampede event in Chicago. Knight appeared in the 2000 film \"Family Jewels\" and played himself in the 2003 David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\" In 2001, he competed against his \"Brady Bunch\" castmates on \"The Weakest Link,\" winning $49,000 for the charitable organization Zero Population Growth. In 2005, he joined the cast of the VH1 reality series \"The Surreal Life,\" where he met his third wife, model Adrianne Curry, and the two starred in \"My Fair Brady\" from 2005 to 2008. Christopher guest-starred on \"That '70s Show\" (2006) and appeared in the films \"Fallen Angels\" (2006), \"Light Years Away\" (2008), and \"American Pie Presents: The Book of Love\" (2009), and he hosted \"Trivial Pursuit: America Plays\" from 2008 to 2009. He guest-starred on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" in 2010 and 2018, and he appeared in the films \"Letting Go\" (2012) and \"Guardian Angel\" (2014) and the miniseries \"Heartbreakers\" (2014). Knight appeared in the short film \"Prisoner\" and the feature film \"Where the Fast Lane Ends\" in 2017 and the TV movie \"The Last Sharknado: It's About Time\" in 2018.\n\nBusiness Career\n\nIn 1988, more than a decade after \"The Brady Bunch\" ended, Christopher entered the computer industry with a job as a sales manager for the tech company Martec, Inc. Within 18 months, he had landed Martec's first $1 million deal, and he was subsequently named Employee of the Year. Knight became the Vice President of Design System Marketing and Sales at New Image Industry in 1989, and two years later, he co-founded the 3D graphics company Visual Software. In 1995, he founded a company called Kidwise Learningware, and he later joined Adesso, a keyboard manufacturer. In 1997, Christopher served as Vice President of Marketing at video hardware company iXMicro, and he founded Eskape Labs, a TV tuner company, in 1998. Hauppauge Computer Works purchased Eskape Labs in 2000.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nChristopher was married to Julie Schulman from 1989 to 1992 and Toni Erickson from 1995 to 2000. In 2005, he proposed to Adrianne Curry on the \"My Fair Brady\" season finale, and the couple wed on May 29, 2006, in Adrianne's hometown, Joliet, Illinois. Knight and Curry, who are 24 years apart in age, appeared on a 2007 episode of \"Dr. Phil\" that focused on couples with large age gaps. Christopher and Adrianne divorced in early 2012, and Knight went on to marry Cara Knight on November 5, 2016.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nKnight has earned three TV Land Award nominations for \"The Brady Bunch,\" winning the Pop Culture Award in 2007; his other nominations were for Favorite Dual-Role Character (2003) and Favorite Singing Siblings (2005). In 1994, Christopher received a CableACE Award nomination for Performance in a Comedy Special for the 1993 MTV Movie Awards."
