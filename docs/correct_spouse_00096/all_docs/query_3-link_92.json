        "text": "— When was the last time you heard of any controversy coming out of cable’s GSN?\n\nGSN is the snappier new name for the old Game Show Network. GSN is the retro home of bad hairstyle reruns of Match Game, Password and Family Feud.\n\nAlso airing are Deal or No Deal, the syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and other series familiar to most.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the updated version of The Newlywed Game. This is the current incarnation of the popular series that debuted in 1966 and introduced America to the euphemism “making whoopee.”\n\nThe whole point of the game then, and I suppose now, was to embarrass newlywed couples with intimate questions in an attempt to show how well they know each other. Or don’t.\n\nOriginal host Bob Eubanks was the master of the raised eyebrow, pregnant pause and leering glance toward the camera. Carnie Wilson is the host of the new version, now in its second season.\n\nHere’s what the GSN press release says about today’s episode at 5 p.m.: “The Newlywed Game will feature George Takei (Star Trek’s Mr.Sulu) and his spouse, Brad Altman - the first same-sex couple ever cast in the history of the series - during a special celebrity edition of the game.”\n\nThe other two couples are Christopher Knight (The Brady Bunch) and his wife, Adrianne Curry (American’s Next Top Model), and Damien Gurganius and his wife, Nicole Brewer (The Biggest Loser: Couples 2).\n\nKnight and Curry have made a living appearing on any reality or game show that will have them. But it will be Takei and Altman who’ll get all the attention and probably stir up some controversy since the debate over samesex marriage continues.\n\nTakei and Altman have been in a committed relationship for 22 years. They were married in September 2008 in Los Angeles. The legal issue of same-sex marriage has gotten messy out there and the California Supreme Court has weighed in. We haven’t heard the last of it.\n\nBut no matter how you feel about same-sex marriage, George and Brad will be the first gay couple on The Newlywed Game.\n\nSome have complained that being together for 22 years, legally married or not, gives George and Brad an advantage over the other couples with a much shorter resume. I disagree. After 15 or 20 years you start forgetting the marital minutiae that seemed so important early on. We’ll see how it plays out.\n\nBill weighs in.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton will surely be watching The Newlywed Game today. In case you were wondering about Clinton’s views, on Sept. 25 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Clinton about changing his mind on same-sex marriage.\n\nCooper: “Do you now believe that gay people should have full rights to civil marriage nationwide?”\n\nClinton: “I do. I believe historically marriage has been a question left to the states and the religious institutions. I still think that’s where it belongs. I was against the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage nationwide, and I still think that the American people should be able to play this out in debates.\n\n“But me, Bill Clinton personally, I changed my position. I am no longer opposed to that. I think if people want to make commitments that last a lifetime, they ought to be able to do it.”\n\nMore\n\nFlashpoint. The Canadian import Flashpoint did well enough for CBS that the network has ordered 13 more episodes for later in the season. It will no doubt be used to replace one of the current crop of dramas when it goes belly up.\n\nThe series stars Hugh Dillon, Enrico Colantoni, Amy Jo Johnson and David Paetkau as cops in the Strategic Response Unit.\n\nVick up close.\n\nHe did the crime; he did the time. Now Michael Vick will do a TV show. Vick is back in the NFL after serving 18 months fordog fighting. Now, cable’s BET is working on an eight part semi-documentary on Vick. It’ll cover his troubled youth, his arrest, incarceration and comeback with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIt’s all part of Vick’s attempt to polish his tarnished reputation so he can make money again and pay all those bills.\n\nThe TV Column appears Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.
