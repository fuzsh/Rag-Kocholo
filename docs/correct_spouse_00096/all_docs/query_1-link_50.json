Their on-screen romance let to their own spin-off series My Fair Brady, which documented their engagement, wedding and first year of marriage.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, the former America's Next Top Model contestant had yet to address the split on her official Twitter page. \"May 29, 2006 I maried Christopher Anton Knight,\" she wrote. \"\"Enjoy your weekend! I certainly am!\"\n\nEarlier this month, however, Curry told Howard Stern she was \"unsatisfied\" at home and found attention via Twitter. The former model even confessed to using a Sybian machine (a masturbation tool for women) in lieu of sexual relations with her hubby."
