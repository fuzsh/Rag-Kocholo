        "text": "Does Peter Brady even like pork chops and applesauce? Is Christopher Knight still married to his wife from that reality TV show?\n\nIf you understand why someone would ask the first question, that means you’ve probably watched “The Brady Bunch” and know Peter Brady (played by Christopher Knight) uttered the terrible Humphrey Bogart impression of “pork chops and applesauce.”\n\nIf you understand why someone would ask the second question, then you probably watched Knight on VH1’s “The Surreal Life” and the reality show it spawned, “My Fair Brady.” The reality show followed Knight and Adrianne Curry, (America’s Next Top Model 2003 whom Knight met on “The Surreal Life”) through their courtship.\n\nWhatever the question for Knight, here's your chance. He's going to be in town this week to promote The Michigan Lottery's \"Make Me Rich!\" game show and has agreed to an interview. So send your questions to yourlife@grpress.com, and we'll ask them. (Put \"Ask Peter Brady This\" in the subject line).\n\nThe man who’s ranked by VH1 as No. 20 on the list of 100 Greatest Kid Stars has been busy since his days starring in the 1970s TV show.\n\nKnight has done the celebrity show circuit ( “Celebrity Family Feud,” “Celebrity Circus,” the Brady Bunch episode of “The Weakest Link,” Discovery Channel’s “Body Challenge)” and hosted “Trivial Pursuit: America Plays.”\n\nIn his Michigan Lottery job, he guides contestants as they compete in three games for a chance to win a $500,000 prize, a $1 million prize or a grand prize of $2 million. Viewers at home can text in for a chance to win one of five $1,000 prizes.\n\nIf you want to be a contestant, visit Michigan.gov/lottery and click on \"Make Me Rich!\"\n\nYou don’t even have to be a Brady Bunch fan."
