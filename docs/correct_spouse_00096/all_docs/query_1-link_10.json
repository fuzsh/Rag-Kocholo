Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in.\" He further added, \"Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort than a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort. The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future.\"\n\nAdrianne Curry wasn't happy with Christopher Knight's\n\nCurryâs interview on Howard Sternâs radio show was also negative towards her then-husband. She said, âI might be a little out but he's trying to get back inâ¦we've had a lot of distance lately. My big joke now is, 'I'm Mrs. Knight the third and probably not the last. You know, cause I always tell him, 'I understand, now, why they left you.' And I understand why we're together. Because it's veryâit would be very hard for [other] people to put up with us...I frustrate him to the point where he's smashing his face into walls.\"\n\nAdrianne Curry and Christopher Knight's divorce\n\nAfter deciding that want to go separate ways, Curry and Knight filed for divorce on which got finalized in 2013.\n\nAdrianne Curry is dating Matthew Rhode\n\nTalking about her current boyfriend, Curry is dating actor Matthew Rhode.
