        "text": "WE TV'S \"CHRIS & ADRIANNE DO RUSSIA\" SPECIAL PREMIERES SUNDAY, DECEMBER 2ND AT 9PM I 8C ON WE TV\n\nA VOYEURISTIC ADVENTURE WITH REALITY CELEBRITIES, CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT & ADRIANNE CURRY,\n\n\"We have found a McDonald's�, so we will survive.\" � Chris Knight\n\nNew York, NY, October 24, 2007 � He played Peter Brady on \"The Brady Bunch.\" She became the first winner of \"America's Next Top Model.\" They met on VH1's \"The Surreal Life,\" and the series \"My Fair Brady\" followed their journey down the aisle. Now it is time to see what married life is really like for this TV couple when they take a Russian road trip! From Hollywood to Russia, jet-set with Chris Knight & Adrianne Curry on a most humorous and entertaining adventure with the two-hour special \"Chris & Adrianne Do Russia,\" premiering Sunday, December 2nd at 9pm I 8c on WE tv.\n\nChris and Adrianne are quite possibly the most mismatched couple in Hollywood today. Yet their quirky and outspoken personalities constantly captivate audiences. Thus, as a happily married couple, they are a natural fit to host the 2007 Mrs. World competition in Russia, which premiered on WE tv this past June. From Hollywood to Sochi, Moscow to St. Petersburg, Chris and Adrianne embark on a wild trip, to a country they've never been before. Along the way, they'll take in some sights and run into a few unforeseen circumstances, everything for which Adrianne has an opinion�and Chris always has a reply! Their humorous, explosive, provocative and lovable personalities keep us constantly interested and entertained. It's a no-holds-barred look at the travelogues of this engaging husband-and-wife team.\n\nAs usual in Chris & Adrianne's world, things don't always go as expected. In Moscow, Chris & Adrianne discover just how cold \"below freezing\" is and experience cuisines not necessarily favorable to their palates. A trip to the Central Moscow Farmers Market sheds light on these exotic foods, including bull penis. In Sochi, they learn that hosting a live event doesn't always run smoothly, especially when Adrianne becomes alarmingly ill. A 12-hour train ride to St. Petersburg doesn't pan out exactly as planned and a weakened Adrianne needs to be hospitalized by the time they reach their destination. With Chris by her side and hospital treatment, Adrianne recovers in time to do some sight-seeing. From Moscow's Red Square and Russia's First Vodka Factory, to Stalin's summer house and Saint Isaac's Cathedral, the grandeur of Russia redeems the trip, despite some bumps along the way.\n\nExcited at the prospect of an adventure, Chris states, \"This was, for us, about the first place we traveled to of significance, where neither of us have had any experience previously. This was something where we both got to experience a culture and the environment for the first time together.\" But the Knights learn a few lessons along the way. \"We're just going to be more careful about traveling�about what to bring and how to prepare,\" Chris discovered. \"I appreciate the toilet paper and Kleenex� at home, probably more than anything else,\" said Adrianne. \"This was particularly rough, not just for us but for everyone around us.\" One thing's for sure: through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, Chris & Adrianne can weather anything, even the former Soviet Union.\n\nAbout WE tv\n\nWE tv is the content destination where strong, confident women connect to fun, entertaining programming focused on pop culture, personal style and relationships.
