        "text": "There will be one less mouth to feed in the \"Brady Bunch\" household.\n\nActor Christopher Knight and model Adrianne Curry have decided to end their marriage after five years, according to HollyScoop.com.\n\nPhil Viardo, the couple's manager, released a statement to the website on Curry and Knight calling it quits.\n\n\"After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated. The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in.\"\n\nThe statement came on the couple's five-year anniversary.\n\n\"Both Knight and Curry decided to release this joint announcement today in order to preempt any potential rumors and gossip and ask that their fans and the media respect their privacy during this delicate period.\"\n\nThe two first met on the VH1 television series \"The Surreal Life.\" That led to a spin-off series called \"My Fair Brady\" which documented their engagement and wedding."
