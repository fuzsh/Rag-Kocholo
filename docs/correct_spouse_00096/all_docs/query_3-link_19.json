        "text": "On the popular ABC sitcom \"The Brady Bunch,\" which ran from 1969 to 1974, no mention of divorce was ever made.\n\nMike Brady, played by the late Robert Reed, was a widowed architect and father of three sons who married Carol Martin (née Tyler) played by Florence Henderson, a mom of three daughters.\n\nWhile producer and show creator Sherwood Schwartz wanted his character Carol to be a divorcée, the network objected, resulting in a compromise with no mention being made of the circumstances in which Carol's first marriage ended.\n\nIn real life, unfortunately, divorce happens more than ever before, as actor Christopher Knight, who played middle son Peter on the series, knows very well.\n\nHe's 53 and twice divorced.\n\nAnd on Monday, the date of his fifth anniversary of marriage to his third wife, model Adrianne Curry who hails from Joliet, the couple announced they are separating.\n\n\"After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated,\" their manager Phil Viardo said in a statement this week.\n\n\"The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union.\"\n\nThis was the first marriage for Curry, 28, whose relationship with Knight was very publicly profiled on the VH1 show \"My Fair Brady,\" which documented the couple's ups and downs for three seasons with a big televised finale wedding in Joliet.\n\nThe two first met as costars on 2005's \"The Surreal Life.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nCurry, 2003 \"America's Next Top Model,\" was with hubby Knight in January returning home to Joliet to host Bridal Expo 2011 at the Rialto Square Theatre in Joliet, which is where the couple had their televised wedding featuring a \"Phantom of the Opera\" theme.\n\nBeth Fahey, co-owner of Creative Cakes in Tinley Park, Ill., even created the couple's custom wedding cake, incorporating the \"Phantom\" theme and carrying a price tag of $1,250.\n\n\"The Rialto is one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen in America, and can only be compared to what I have seen in Italy, Russia, and France,\" Curry said for the press alerts about the couple's involvement as the host of the bridal show in Joliet earlier this year.\n\n\"I am really excited to be able to walk through its doors again, especially to help others with their own weddings. Until you have traveled the states and the world as much as I have, you cannot appreciate just how special the Rialto Theatre really is and I feel special to have been invited back.\"\n\nIronically, the Rialto Square Theatre also marked an anniversary of sorts this week, celebrating 85 years with a big event on Tuesday.\n\nAs for the couple's splashy May 29, 2006, wedding at the Rialto, it was attended by Knight's \"Brady brother and sister\" Susan Olsen (who played \"Cindy\") and Barry Williams (who played \"Greg\"), who both agreed to appear on the telecast traveling to Joliet to attend the wedding.\n\nFlorence Henderson refused to attend the wedding, stating publicly that she didn't believe the relationship and nuptials had a foundation to last, while pointing out the amount of attention and publicity sought for the event.\n\nThe opinions expressed are solely those of the writer.
