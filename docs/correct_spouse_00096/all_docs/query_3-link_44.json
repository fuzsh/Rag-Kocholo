        "text": "Is it just me or does it seem like Christopher Knight is EVERYWHERE?! He will be appearing on Celebrity Family Feud along side his wife Adrianne Curry ( former America' Next Top Model ) tonight on NBC. He was most recently on Celebrity Circus where he cracked his arm.\n\nChristopher Knight is best known for playing the role of middle son Peter Brady. I loved watching The Brady Bunch as a young girl, and like so many other girls, I had a crush on Greg Brady. Knight though has been the most famous of the Brady kids since the Brady Bunch went off the air. The Brady Bunch aired from 1969 – 1974.\n\nYou can check out all things Brady Bunch at Wikipedia.\n\nKnight actually had a lucrative career in the computer industry in the 90s.\n\nHowever, after appearing on VH1's Surreal Life, where he met, fell in love and ultimately married former America's Next Top Model, Adrianne Curry, his television career was catapulted to the forefront again. Knight and Curry moved in together and got engaged, as documented on the VH1 series My Fair Brady in 2005. Then in in 2006 it was picked up and documented their wedding.\n\nYou can tune in tonight at 8 p.m. on NBC, and watch Christopher Knight on Celebrity Family Feud. By the way, I like Al Roker as host but Richard Dawson is still my favorite Family Feud host."
