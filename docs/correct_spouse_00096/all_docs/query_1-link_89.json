        "text": "Christopher Knight & Adrianne Curry Separate On 5-Year Anniversary\n\nThe former “Brady Bunch” middle child and the first “America’s Next Top Model” have gone their separate ways.\n\nAfter five years together, Christopher Knight, 53, and Adrianne Curry, 28, have called it quits… on their five-year anniversary.\n\n“After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated. The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in,” the couple’s manager said in a statement to Hollyscoop.com.\n\n“Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort. The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future,” the statement continued.\n\nOn Monday, Adrianne addressed the split on Twitter, writing “finding my zen in a spray of bullets at the shooting range… so yeah, guess you heard about my f***ed up life……its ok…we arent fighting…no matter what happens, we will know we put our best in.”\n\nThe couple, who do not have any children together, met in 2004 during the fourth season on VH1’s “The Surreal Life.” They also starred together on “My Fair Brady” for three seasons, also on VH1."
