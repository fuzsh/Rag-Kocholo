        "text": "The series only lasted five seasons ending in 1974, but because of its popularity in reruns \"The Brady Bunch\" has permeated pop culture and become one of the most iconic and beloved TV families.\n\nWho didn't secretly wish they could live with the Brady clan, a la cousin Oliver?\n\nThe show became so popular that it spurred a series of reunion shows and short-lived spin-off series' including a feature film in 1995 starring Shelley Long and Gary Cole as Mr. and Mrs. Brady, and then two sequels.\n\nChristopher Knight, who played Peter Brady, the middle male child among the mixed brood of six, likens the phenomena to Jason Voorhees or Freddie Krueger — they never die.\n\n\"I tried, as a young person, to pretend it didn't exist anymore. Thinking it was gonna die or become a historic part of my past, until I realized it didn't seem to ever be gone. It was resurrecting itself like Jason. It was like Freddie. You couldn't kill it,\" he told the Desert Sun on Saturday.\n\nREAD MORE: Box office earnings are down, but here's how cinema is staying afloat — even thriving\n\nBut over the years knowing that nothing but warmth and kindness has come from being a part of the show, he embraces his TV lineage. And even though it's hard and gets boring to continue to talk about it over and over, he knows his trajectory in life is a direct result of being Peter Brady.\n\n\"I like to believe that everything I've got ... hinges upon having had that great bit of fortune. I'm sure there's a lot that is out of reach because of it. But there's endless opportunities of things that are within reach,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, if it wasn't for being on the show created by Sherwood Schwartz, he wouldn't be performing in the comedy stage show \"Dinner at Five\" premiering Wednesday at the Indian Wells Theater in Palm Desert.\n\nThe play was written and is produced by Lloyd Schwartz, the son of Sherwood, who has known Knight since he was 10 years old. Lloyd worked on the show as a dialogue coach and would run the lines with the cast members before a scene.\n\nAfter initially raising an eyebrow at the script, Knight said he joined on because he thought it would be nice to work with Lloyd again.\n\nKathy Garver, known as Cissy from the 1960s sitcom \"Family Affair,\" Larry Thomas, known as the \"Soup Nazi\" from \"Seinfeld and Caryn Richman from \"The New Gidget,\" all join Knight for the first two weeks of the five-week show through Feb. 3. A second set of actors takes over the show from Feb. 7-24 including David Ruprecht, Ilene Graff of \"Mr. Belvedere,\" John Moschitta Jr. and Julie Cobb from \"Charles in Charge.\"\n\nThe intention for the play, said Knight, was to get actors with whom people are familiar.\n\n\"In this particular case they're not looking for whom they conceive to be the best actor for the role. They are looking for somebody who can play the role who is recognizable from television,\" he said. \"The people who come through that door want to know they know the person on stage. The reality is you are being hired because you are recognizable.\"\n\nThe play is about two old friends whose wives suggest they switch partners to liven up their lives.\n\n\"It doesn't go where you think it's going. It's really, really sweet,\" said Knight. \"This is essentially a play about longevity and sameness and newness and how to find newness in sameness.\"\n\nA Brady forever\n\nKnight said one of the most-logged request he gets is to say \"Pork chops and applesauce,\" a line from an episode where he starts to do impressions to create a new personality after being told at a party he lacks one.\n\nHe also gets asked if all six television siblings are friends.\n\n\"We are not brothers and sisters. We do not see each other all the time. Now, the six of us actually live in four different cities. Barry (Williams) lives in Missouri, Eve (Plumb) lives in New York, Mike (Lookinland) lives right outside of Salt Lake, and the three of us – Maureen (McCormick), myself and Susan (Olsen) live in Los Angeles &mldr; and we don't see each other that regularly,\" he said.\n\n\"But whenever there is a reason to get back together. It's as though no time has passed. It's like getting together with cousins you haven't seen in years. You pick it back up. There's really nobody in my life that I've carried through to this point that I've known as long as the cast members,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Florence Henderson, 'Brady Bunch' mom, dies two days before Palm Springs show\n\nThe last time he and his Brady Bunch family got together was for his TV mom Florence Henderson's funeral service. She died Nov. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was Thanksgiving night when I got the call. It was shocking because &mldr; I had just seen her two weeks earlier. We visited Maureen on 'Dancing with the Stars.' And Florence was a regular there because she had done it,\" he said.\n\nEven though Henderson was only his TV mother, he said she was very representative as a mother. She was tough and a person no one ever wanted to disappoint.\n\n\"I had issues with my own family. We weren't the Bradys. But that said, (it's) interesting in retrospect that I had the Bradys because it actually had a beneficial effect as a representative of a healthy functioning family. So even though it wasn’t real it could be used as a framework and Florence was part of that family,\" he said.\n\n\"I was a puckish kind of kid, I needed a shorter leash at times. I needed somebody to have a handle on my leash or I could get out of hand. And she had a good handle on me and it was a really healthy environment.\"\n\nKnight started working in the entertainment industry as a young kid, first in commercials at his actor dads suggestion to help \"contribute\" to the family. He got the role as Peter Brady when he was about 10.\n\nThe show ran from 1969 to 1974, but he participated in the many TV specials and sequels until he left the industry in his late 20s. With an interest in computers, he worked in the PC industry for about 20 years and had success in it, but got tired of it and decided to move back to Los Angeles and give the entertainment industry another try.\n\n\"I never felt comfortable with it in my early 20s,\" he said. \"I wanted to go back and see what was there for me with my new self.\"\n\nBut having seen his father's struggles as an actor, he knew he needed something more than just acting, so he started Christopher Knight Home, a line of furniture he sells online.\n\n\"Most of the stuff I get is not straight up acting which is why this is a lot of fun,\" he said of the local play. \"Mostly it's personality based. From being a game show host. To being in reality TV and all that stuff.\n\nOne of Knight's more recent reality show successes was when he appeared on VH1's \"The Surreal Life\" in 2005 where he met his third wife, model Adrienne Curry, resulting in a spin-off reality show called \"My Fair Brady.\" They divorced after five years. He married his current wife Cara in 2016.\n\n\"I like the acting. The acting is fun. The acting is hard to come by, because to be honest I'm pretty typecast. In this particular case this is where it came in handy they wanted people who were recognizable on stage playing another character. And in this venue it works well.\"\n\nIf you go:\n\n\"Dinner at Five\" opens Wednesday and runs for five weeks at the Indian Wells Theater in Palm Desert, CA. Tickets cost $35. A percentage of each ticket sold will benefit Palm Springs Women in Film and Television BookPALS Coachella Valley."
