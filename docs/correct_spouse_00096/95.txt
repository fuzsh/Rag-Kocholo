LOS ANGELES

Former "Brady Bunch" actor Christopher Knight has filed for divorce from his wife, model Adrianne Curry.

The couple met while they were cast mates on the fourth season of the reality TV show, "The Surreal Life," and then they had their own series called "My Fair Brady."

Knight cited irreconcilable differences.

Curry took to her Twitter account, saying Knight filed at her request and suggested that the split was amicable.

The pair was married for five years.
