Personal life

Christopher Knight proposed to Curry on the season finale of My Fair Brady, on VH1, which aired on November 6, 2005. The show was renewed for a second season that began in June 2006, and focused on the couple's wedding preparations. The couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois on May 29, 2006, in a gothic-style wedding. Says Curry of the goth-themed ceremony, "I wanted to go as Gothic as I could and as traditional as I could without ruffling anyone's feathers. ... I wanted to have a black dress ... but I knew it would break my grandmother's heart." In 2007, Curry and Knight appeared on the Dr. Phil Show to discuss their marital issues on an episode dealing with large age gaps in relationships. Dr. Phil predicted that their style of arguing, particularly Knight's hurtful comments, was a strong predictor of impending divorce in couples. The couple announced their separation on May 29, 2011. The couple filed for divorce on August 19, 2011. The couple's divorce became final in 2012.

Curry is openly bisexual. In addition to being a big Star Wars fan, she enjoys cosplay, reads the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, watches Game of Thrones and plays World of Warcraft. At the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, when a friend was sexually assaulted, Curry (who was costumed at Catwoman) joined others defending the victim by counter-attacking the assailant, hitting him with the hilt of her bullwhip. The defenders quickly drove the attacker away.
