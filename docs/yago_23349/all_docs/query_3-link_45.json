        "text": "ðŸŒŒ Dive into the depths of \"The Black Sea at Night,\" a mesmerizing 1879 masterpiece by the celebrated Russian-Armenian painter Ivan Aivazovsky. This enchanting seascape captures the ethereal beauty of the Black Sea under the cover of darkness, where the interplay of light and shadows dances across the tumultuous waves. The painting, executed in oil on canvas, is a stunning example of Aivazovsky's unparalleled ability to depict light and water with sublime delicacy and power. Aivazovsky's artistic vision is particularly evident in his treatment of light, using luminous colors to create a glowing horizon that seems to challenge the overwhelming darkness. The dark hues and the contrasting bright whitecaps of the waves beneath the moonlight showcase his unique ability to portray dramatic, atmospheric conditions at sea. His work often evoked the overwhelming power and mystique of the ocean, which has enthralled viewers and artists alike. Despite his success, Aivazovsky was not without controversy. During his time, some critics argued that his focus on seascapes was overly narrow, limiting his scope as an artist. Additionally, his romanticized vision often clashed with the rising trend of Realism, which some of his contemporaries believed provided a more truthful depiction of nature and human experiences. However, Aivazovskyâ€™s work has stood the test of time, remaining profoundly influential and continuing to captivate the imaginations of art lovers across the world. #IvanAivazovsky #TheBlackSeaAtNight #1879 #RussianArt #ArmenianArt #seascape #oiloncanvas #artlovers #arthistory #classicalart #maritimeart #nightscenes #oceanpainting #lightandshadow #artisticvision #nauticalart #romanticism #artcontroversy #historicalart #museumcollection #artoftheday #artstagram #painter #fineart #canvasart #artworld #masterpiece #artsy\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci Lucana Tavola, self portrait by Leonardo, h. 1505-1510. Temple on wood, 60 x 49 cm. Leonardo da Vinci, Italian polymath (1452-1519). Royal Library of Turin, Italy ... The portrait, best self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, dating from 1505-1510, has been attributed to the great Italian genius. Museum of Vaglio Basilicata. The 'Lucana Table' depicts a man with a long beard and a dark hat. It was discovered in 2008 by art historian Nicola Barbatelli, director of the Museum delle Antiche Genti di Lucania in Vaglio Basilicata, found in a private collection in Salerno where it was recognized as a portrait of Galileo Galilei. The work was then restored by Professor Giancarlo Napoli and his staff. The painting shows Leonardo's face and bust in a three-room view and would have settled, centuries later, the controversy over Leonardo da Vinci's royal features. The painting, upon its discovery, toured numerous art exhibitions, recognized by experts as a work of genius, although there is no complete unanimity. There are still doubts about its authenticity, although scientific studies conducted on that work have allowed to identify the historical period in which it was painted, precisely Leonardo's. Curiosity, as the professor states. Barbatelli, it is that in the Uffizi there is a false portrait of Leonardo, after the 'Tavola Lucana', probably copied from the original found almost fortunately.

Initially, I had intended only to study the sacred geometry of the Salvator Mundi painting for my own personal interests and research. While my readings convinced me that this painting was a fake, the work's complex geometry proved me wrong. From there, it was as if a call to study its secrets had become a priority, setting aside everything that ordinarily fills my daily life. . Therefore, I put forward the following hypotheses: 1- This painting is an attraction that combines the allegory of light with a simple device to illuminate it: sunlight and water (or water spheres). 2- Leonardo da Vinci used a pictorial technique that resembled current anaglyph methods to give his subjects a Â« lively touch Â». His pentimento may have been visual markers, rather than mistakes in perception. . In addition, I offer the following certainties: 1- Leonardo da Vinci knew and mastered light diffraction. 2- Leonardo da Vinci is the father of this work. 3- The allegory of light is the most relevant way to describe this artwork. #art #leonardodavinci #painting #salvatormundi #arthistory #luxsalvatormundi #hermetism #CBMcrypticandhermeticart\n\nTRANSFORMATION OF THE UNKNOWN INTO THE KNOWN: This is my painting LOVE COUPLE - https://lnkd.in/dKkvMY-N It was created in 2013 by TRANSFORMING the painting LOVE WITHOUT FACE AND NAME, which was painted with the same materials on the same canvas. The painting Love without Face and Name is the cover of my book VIBRATIONAL ART - A TOOL FOR CREATING YOUR REALITY (Austin Macauley Publishers, New York, 2020 - https://lnkd.in/dM5YgsE) Love couple SYMBOLIZES THE INDIVISIBLE UNITY of the electric and magnetic components of ELECTROMAGNETIC energy that make up the reality we perceive. This unity is called in different parts of the world MALE-FEMALE, SPIRITUAL-MATERIAL, DIVINE-HUMAN, ALIEN-TERRESTRIAL, VISIBLE-INVISIBLE, PHYSICAL-NON-PHYSICAL, KNOWN-UNKNOWN, etc. #lovecouple #transformation #indivisibleunity #vibrationalart #equilibrium #jasnicaklaramatic\n\nMoving to Italy has caused me to look more deeply at the language of art and so here is my list of 10 words that aren't commonly known but are used when talking about techniques, materials and styles. Some of them you might know - but I'd like to hear which ones you're unfamiliar with: 1. Sprezzatura: A term from Renaissance literature, it refers to the art of making difficult tasks look effortless or natural. 2. Memento mori: Literally translates to \"remember that you will die.\" In art, it's a reminder of mortality, often depicted through symbols like skulls, hourglasses, or withering flowers. 3. Grotesque: A style of decorative art characterized by fanciful and often bizarre imagery, such as mythical creatures, foliage, and abstract forms. 4. Capriccio: As mentioned earlier, it's a style of painting where architectural elements from different locations are combined to create an imaginary landscape or scene. 5. TerribilitÃ : A term used to describe the quality of awe-inspiring power or intensity in art, often associated with the works of Michelangelo. 6. Paragone: A debate in Renaissance art theory about the superiority of one artistic medium over another, such as painting versus sculpture. 7. Mise en abyme: A visual technique where an image contains a smaller copy of itself, creating a recursive effect. It's often used in art to suggest infinity or self-reference. 8. Cangiante: A painting technique where an artist uses different colors or tones to represent light and shadow, creating a shimmering or changing effect. 9. Graticcio: A wooden grid used by artists to enlarge or reduce the scale of a drawing or painting. 10. Pezzetto: A small, rough sketch or study used by artists to plan or explore compositional ideas before creating a finished work. #italian #language #artwords #vocabulary\n\nThis is one of the controversial paintings of Arent de Gelder, who was a Dutch painter from 1967â€“1927. In this painting, we can see a UFO spaceship, which is known as the Alien Space Ship, and some people claim that we see this ship. I don't know how it can be possible that aliens exist if this is true, but there are many symbols that point out that aliens exist. The UFO space ship is controversial news for everyone. How is it possible? Can aliens exist? Why do the aliens not seem normal to everyone? And why did Arent de Gelder paint this can before aliens communicated with him? What do you think about this painting presentation?"
