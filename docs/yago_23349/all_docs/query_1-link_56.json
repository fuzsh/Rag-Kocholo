        "text": "Reading this book was such a treat for me!\n\nThere are a few paintings I wish to see in person one day, and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an Ermine is on that list. This painting, which is a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, a mistress of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, is my favorite out of all of da Vinci’s artworks. To me, Cecilia looks breathtakingly serene in this. So it was special to read and learn about the painting’s history.\n\nWritten by Laura Morelli, who holds a doctorate in art history, The Night Portrait is meticulously researched. It’s told from four perspectives in two timelines. In the fifteenth century, we have da Vinci who has been sent to Ludovico Sforza by Lorenzo the Magnificent. Ludovico, who’d later go on to commission The Last Supper, is the Duke of Milan in all but name. His teenage nephew is the rightful heir to the title, but Ludovico has fought bitterly and won the struggle for the regency. As Ludovico attempts to maintain his power, da Vinci thinks his knowhow in war machinery designs will be appreciated by Ludovico.\n\nA few years after da Vinci’s arrival in Ludovico’s court, Cecilia passes Milan en route to a monastery. Cecilia, a sixteen-year-old girl, had been betrothed to a young boy from a respectable family. However, her brothers had gambled away her dowry, so her marriage contract had fallen through. Because she doesn’t have any prospects, Cecilia’s family expects her to join a nunnery. But young Cecilia has other ideas! In Milan, it doesn’t take long for Cecilia to catch the wandering eyes of Ludovico and become his mistress. Cecilia hopes proving her worth to Ludovico will get him to marry her. However, Ludovico’s marriage to Beatrice d’Este has been long arranged, and it’s a political alliance he can’t afford to lose. So Ludovico commissions Lady with an Ermine from da Vinci before his nuptials.\n\nFrom what I can find about this painting, Cecilia and da Vinci held each other in esteem, a fact that’s also reflected in the story. Cecilia was a learned young woman (her father had educated Cecilia alongside her brothers) who enjoyed art and music, so it’s not hard to imagine that da Vinci enjoyed her company.\n\nTo me, the ermine in the portrait felt like an odd choice at first until I understood its symbolism. Lodovico was sometimes referred to as ermellino bianco (white ermine). According to da Vinci’s bestiaries, ermine also symbolizes purity: “The ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day, and it would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair, in order not to stain its purity.”\n\nIn The Night Portrait, in the plot-lines set during WWII, we have Edith, a German art conservator in Munich. She has been tasked with putting together a presentation on masterpieces and their whereabouts, and little does she know this information will be used to steal and bring those paintings to Germany, supposedly to be displayed in Führermuseum. Edith is conscripted to go to Poland and bring Lady with an Ermine. Edith doesn’t believe in Nazism, so it pains Edith to have unwittingly aided Hitler’s atrocities and put the Czartoryski family, the owners of the Lady with an Ermine in harm’s way. But with a sick father back in Germany, for whose life she fears, there’s not a lot Edith can do, other than obeying her orders while secretly documenting information about the stolen pieces. Edith hopes one day she’ll be able to aid in returning the art, and she manages to do just that when her path crosses with Dominic, an American soldier, who is a part of the Monuments Men team.\n\nBefore reading The Night Portrait, I didn’t know much about the Monuments Men and Women or their work. I was aware of the movie, but I had dismissed it as just another WWII movie! Monuments Men and Women were a group of people composed of historians and museum curators who went into the battlegrounds to retrieve stolen art. Most of the plundered pieces were kept by Hitler and other Nazi generals in their personal collections (Lady with an Ermine was kept by Hans Frank, aka “the butcher of Poland”, at his home office), and towards the end of WWII, they frantically tried to hide them, damaging some of the paintings in the process. So I was amazed by the courage Monuments Men and Women showed in risking their lives to save these beautiful paintings for generations to come. As Dominic comes to understand in the story, after having been plagued by something as devastating as a war, we need our culture to bring back hope and maybe even remind us why it’s worth living…\n\nThis was a wonderful read. 4 stars."
