        "text": "Among the protectors of Ariosto were, as well as Cardinal Ippolito I dâEste, his brother Duke Alfonso IÂ dâEste.Â On his behalf, âAriosto â secular cleric, fine diplomat, exquisite poet â wore the rough armour of the soldiers fighting for the House of Esteâ (Bertoni 1919, p. 141). These were internal clashes in the renewed war with Venice, for which the League of Cambrai (1508) saw Pope Julius II, Emperor Maximilian I, King Louis XII of France, and the King of Spain allied on an exceptional basis with Alfonso I dâEste, who wished to reconquer the Polesine area lost by his father during the 1483 war. The following verses in Orlando Furioso were dedicated to the Este victory shrewdly won by Cardinal Ippolito during the conflicts in 1509-1510:\n\nAmong the warriors of antiquity\n\nMuch gentleness and courtesy appear,\n\nVirtues but seldom seen with us; while we\n\nOf evil ways, on all sides, see and hear.\n\nHippolytus, when you, with ensignry\n\nWon from the foe, and with his captive gear\n\nAdorned our temples; and his galleys bore,\n\nLaden with prey, to your paternal shore;\n\n(Orlando Furioso, Canto 36, 2)\n\nAriosto offers a lively description of that battle, stating how like Alfonso he had not only been engaged in diplomatic pursuits, but also played an active part in the war effort.\n\nI Hercules and Alexander viewed,\n\nUrged by too sovereign ardour, side by side,\n\nSpurring before all others in their mood,\n\nEven within the hostile ramparts ride;\n\nAnd prick so far, the second âscaped with pain,\n\nAnd on the foremost closed the opposing train.\n\n(Orlando Furioso, Canto 36, 6)\n\nIn addition to the war with Venice to annex the territories of Rovigo and Polesine was the threat to the Duchy posed by the Papal States, which subsequently allied itself with the Most Serene Republic.Â The rancour of the church towards Ariosto was so implacable, that in Orlando Furioso Ariosto was unsure whether to define it as a mother or stepmother.\n\nWell is it that his wisdom shines as bright\n\nAs his good sireâs, nor is his valour less;\n\nSince here usurping Venice arms for fight,\n\nAnd her full troops his scanty numbers press,\n\nThere she (I know not if more justly hight\n\nMother or stepmother) brings new distress.\n\n(Orlando Furioso, Canto 3, 52)\n\nThe climate of hostility between Pope Julius II's Rome and Alfonso Iâs Ferrara reached such a level that the Easter Sunday battle in Ravenna in 1512, known as âBloody Easterâ, was included by Ariosto in Orlando Furioso and became a famous episode.Â The Estes were allied with France during the battle against the armies of Spain and the Papal States, and a skilful manoeuvre performed by the Este artillery caused the enemy troops to lie prone on the ground, allowing the Este army to take advantage of the situation and trample them with their horses. Alfonso I was said to have mounted âtwo large, spirited steedsâ who were accustomed to dispatching the enemy by kicking and jumping on them, so much so that their kill count merited a portrait being kept of them. Credit for the victory which followed was awarded entirely to the Duke, who was thus immortalised by Ariosto in his poem:\n\nTis he, who with his counsel and his lance,\n\nShall win the honours of Romagnaâs plain,\n\nAnd open to the chivalry of France\n\nThe victory over Julius, leagued with Spain.\n\nPaunch-deep in human blood shall steeds advance\n\nIn that fierce strife, and struggle through the slain;\n\nâMid crowded fields, which scarce a grace supply,\n\nWhere Greek, Italian, Frank, and Spaniard die.\n\n(Orlando Furioso, Canto 3, 55)\n\nAlfonso was known for his focus on art and improving Ferrara. His administration was responsible for the creation of unique works. He is responsible for the birth of the âCamerini di Alabastroâ, two private studies built above the Via Coperta, for which Alfonso engaged some of the most important artists of the era: Antonio Lombardo, Giovanni Bellini, Titian, Dosso Dossi.Â He also came up with the idea to decorate the bastions of the city of gardens and tree-lined boulevards, creating the green oases known as Delizie. The most magnificent of these was the DeliziaÂ del Belvedere, an arched spit of land located in the middle of a meander of the Po near the city walls. The island became a magnificent park where exotic animals of hitherto unknown species were gathered, while the architecture of the palazzo was embellished with spectacular frescoes and paintings.Â The wonders of this island were destroyed when Ferrara was devolved to the Papal States, but a description remains in the verses of Orlando Furioso:\n\nOf islands this should be the fairest one\n\nIn sea, or pool, or river, far and near:\n\nSo that who this beheld, would brook no more\n\nTo hear that praised which fair Nausicaa bore.\n\nHe heard, it in fair mansions would outdo\n\nThat island which Tiberius held so dear;\n\nAnd trees that in Hesperian gardens grew\n\nWould yield to what this beauteous place should bear;\n\nâSo rare its race of beastsâno fairer shew\n\nHerded or housed erewhile by Circe were;\n\nVenus with Loves and Graces there should sport, Nor more in Gnide and Cyprus keep her court.\n\n(Orlando Furioso, Canto 43, 57 -58)\n\nÂ\n\nAlfÃ²nso I d'Este was duke of Ferrara, Modena and Reggio.Â He was born in Ferrara on 21 July 1476, to Ercole I and Eleanor of Naples, the first-born male after Isabella and Beatrice, who would be followed by Ferrante, Ippolito and Sigismondo. He took over as leader of FerraraÂ after the death of his father in 1505. In 1491 he married Anna Sforza, who however died six years later at a very young age. In 1501, thanks to skilful diplomatic negotiations by his father Ercole, he married LucreziaÂ Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI.\n\nHis reign was marked by continuous conflicts with Venice, the Papal States, France and Spain.Â He also had to deal with internal disturbances in Ferrara, in particular putting down the plot hatched by his two brothers Giulio and Ferrante in 1506.Â A standard bearer for the Papal States, he fought against Venice alongside the League of Cambrai,Â winning the Polesine territory which his father Ercole had lost, but in contrast with the truce signed by Julius II in 1510 and was punished with the loss of the territories of Modena and Mirandola. Reconquering Modena and later Reggio as well was the object of the clashes and alliances which characterised the following years, where Alfonso fought to stem the expansionist designs of the Papal States towards Ferrara. He reconquered Modena and Reggio only between 1530 and 1531, thanks to years spent building strategic alliances. In particular, he strengthened relations with France with the marriage of his son Ercole to RenÃ©e of France, and he gained the support of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who thanks to the Cologne award allowed him to regain the lost territories.\n\nDuring the pauses in fighting, Alfonso I dâEste dedicated himself to managing and improving Ferrara, surrounding himself with artists and writers, in particular Titian, Dossi and Ariosto.Â The Dukeâs propensity for the fine arts was something he had cultivated since his youth:Â âAlfonso, still young, in 1493 would pass most of his day with the founder of the Ferrarese school, Ercole Roberti, who was engaged in drawings for the Delizia di Belriguardo. Some complained about this excessive attention from the prince, but in the meantime the future Duke's artistic formation was coming about, which in joining in those manual artistic tasks, also provided him with rest from day-to-day administrative dutiesâ (Bertoni 1919, p. 196).Â Amongst the most important works carried out under his direction was the construction of the previously mentioned âDeliziaâ on the Belvedere island (1514-1516).Â After the death of Lucrezia Borgia in childbirth in 1519, Alfonso entered a relationship with Laura Dianti whom, according to certain reliable sources, but without official confirmation from the church, he married before dying on 31 October 1534.\n\nÂ"
