        "text": "┗history meme — [favourite women in history] —> Beatrice d’Este\n\nBorn at Ferrara on June 24, 1475. Beatrice d’Este, the duchess of Bari and later of Milan, was the wife of the Milanese ruler Ludovico Sforza (known as “il Moro”). She was one of the most beautiful and accomplished princesses of the Italian Renaissance. A member of the Este family, she was the younger daughter of Ercole I d’Este and the sister of Isabella d’Este and Alfonso d’Este. Beatrice was noted for her excellent taste in fashion and for having invented new clothing styles.\n\nLudovico looked on his young wife as a joyous and fascinating child. And though she was known to be fashionable, cheerful, intelligent, and lovely.For the first year of her marriage Beatrice was blissfully unaware of her husband’s affair with Cecilia Gallerani. One of her constant companions was Ludovico’s brilliant young swordsman and general, Galeazzo di Sanseverino. In golden armor and peacock helmet, Galeazzo had been both sponsor and star of the great tournament in her honor at her wedding, and he soon became her courtier, protector, and friend. And so, for awhile Beatrice spent her time riding or hunting about the countryside with her ladies-in-waiting, her brilliant sister Isabella, and her gallant Galeazzo.\n\nThen one day Beatrice heard a rumor about Cecilia’s presence in the castle; she heard how often the duke was seen in her company, and was told that before many weeks were over his mistress was likely to bear him a child. When Ludovico gave his wife a vest of woven gold she refused to wear it after hearing he’d given Cecilia one just like it. At last, she put her foot down and insisted he get rid of her. Which he did! Soon after Cecilia gave birth to his son, he arranged to have her married to an old friend and count.\n\nBeatrice was also a doting mother of her two sons, Maximilan and Francesco II, seen here with their parents in this detail from an altarpiece of Mary and the infant Jesus that they donated in 1494/5 to the Church of Saint Ambrogia near Milan.\n\nThen disaster struck, twice. First, Lucrezia Crivelli, the lovely daughter of a Milanese nobleman, joined the Duke’s household as one of Beatrice’s ladies-in-waiting. Ludovico was smittem with her, and at once made her his mistress. To add insult to injury, everyone at court talked about the affair, while the ambassador from Ferrara wrote to Isabella that her sister’s husband was spending most of his time with her. At the same time, Bianca Sforza, Ludovico’s illegitimate daughter by an earlier mistress, who had been married off to the dashing general Galeazzo, and whom Beatrice had adopted and loved as her own, suddenly died.\n\nDepressed by her husband’s affair with Lucrezia and Bianca’s death, Beatrice seemed overcome by grief. Yet, on January 1, 1497, she looked fine while driving in her chariot through the castle park and portal and waving to the people on her way to the Dominican Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, where Leonardo was painting on the refectory wall his Last Supper. There she said her devotions at Our Lady’s altar, and then, kneeling at her daughter’s tomb, she prayed a long time for the poor girl’s soul. Back at the castle that afternoon there was dancing in her rooms – until eight at night, when suddenly she felt sick. Three hours later she gave birth to a still-born son, and half an hour after midnight she died.\n\nThe next morning Ludovico sent a letter to his brother-in-law, Isbella’s husband Federico Gonzaga, to tell him the terrible news: “My wife was taken with sudden pains at eight o’clock last night. At eleven she gave birth to a dead son, and at half-past twelve she gave back her spirit to God. This cruel and premature end has filled me with bitter and indescribable anguish, so much so that I would rather have died myself than lose the dearest and most precious thing that I had in this world.”\n\nIn the words of Julia Cartwright, her indefatigable biographer: “Beatrice dies, without a moment’s warning, in the flower of youth and beauty, and the young duchess is borne to her grave in S. Maria delle Grazie amid the tears and lamentations of all Milan. And with her death, the whole Milanese state, that fabric which Ludovico Sforza had built up at such infinite cost and pains, crumbles into ruin.”\n\n[fan cast -> Holliday Grainger as Beatrice d’Este]"
