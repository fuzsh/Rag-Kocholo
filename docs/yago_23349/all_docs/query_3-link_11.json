How young, humorous, beautiful and elegant she was! Everyone was in love with her. So the husband was!\n\nThe wife became his strength and support in the government of the state. And she gave a birth to they two kids. He finally had a heir.\n\nLudovico il Moro was still attracted by many ladies, but he did not have any serious relationship and the wife was closing her eyes on his love stories.\n\nBut one day…\n\nBeatrice d’Este heard gossips that her husband fell in love with one of her court ladies… She thought it was one of many other stories, but she noticed her husband changed.\n\nThe First Lady of Milan, was pregnant the third time when Leonardo Da Vinci was painting the Last Supper in the family church of the Duke.\n\nOn the opposite wall of the refectory a fresco with crucifixion was painted by a court artist Montorfano.\n\nBy tradition the client who order the painting was represented in knees in front of the cross. So, Ludovico il Moro the duke and Beatrice d’Este his wife had to be painted there.

So once Beatrice came in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie church to pose.\n\nCatastrophe\n\nShe was 8 months pregnant and suddenly she felt vertigo. Leonardo went away to take some water. Beatrice remains alone in the room and saw an easel covered with a sheet. We all know women! Everyone would open a sheet even if she feels really bad!\n\nAnd Beatrice surely did!\n\nImmediately she fell unconscious.\n\nThere was a portrait of a young lady painted by Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nIt was her! The court lady of Beatrice and she understood everything!\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci was too prestigious and too expensive for a girl to order the portrait. The only person in Milan who could make Leonardo Da Vinci to paint this girl was the Duke, the husband.\n\nSo, it was true! He was really in love with this girl. Moreover, this girl was also pregnant, as Beatrice was.\n\nBeatrice fell on her stomach. Couple of days later she and her baby died."
