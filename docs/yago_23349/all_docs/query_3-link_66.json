        "text": "Historic Figures\n\nWITH THE NAME BEATRICE\n\nBeatrice di Folco Portinari is credited by many scholars with being the muse of the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri, appearing as a guide in the Divine Comedy, as well as being the inspiration for La Vita Nuova. Beatrice was the daughter of a wealthy Florentine banker, and she married a banker as well, dying at the tender age of 24. Dante met her only two times, nine years apart, but loved her all his life. Their first meeting took place when she was only eight years old, he nine. He was so taken with her that he thought of her often, albeit privately, composed poetry in her honor, and frequented her neighborhood in the hopes of seeing her again. This happened only once, so many years later, when she passed him on the street and gestured a salutation, an â€œever so sweet greetingâ€. Struck by loveâ€™s arrow, he hurried home to dream of her, and to have a vision of her that led him to write La Vita Nuova. This standard of courtly love sustained him throughout his life, as he continued sanctifying her memory and the dream of their unrequited love well after he had married and fathered children himself. Dante set her upon a pedestal, and made her a rare paragon of virtue of such purity that it inspired in him the intention of doing only good. In La Vita Nuova, written in 1293, Beatrice appears as an agent of blessed salvation. In Divine Comedy, she takes over from the ancient poet Virgil as a guide to Paradise, leading Dante through his vision with serene and maternal care. Thus Dante was able to go to his own death with his deification of her complete and unsullied, calling her â€œthe glorious lady of my mindâ€. Later poets of the pre-Raphaelites and the nineteenth centuries followed Danteâ€™s lead, and Beatrice was also immortalized in the art of many painters of the period (Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Gustav Dore). It is an almost foreign concept to our time, but for Dante, his love for the beautiful Beatrice was a holy and sacred transport to the higher aspiration of fulfillment in the love of God.\n\nBeatrice was born into the prominent House of Este, a dynastic family of royal nobility, in the late 15th century. Like her older sister Isabella, Beatrice was a darling of the Italian Renaissance and a fashionista of her time. Like many young girls of her noble stature in the late Middle Ages, Beatrice was offered up in marriage to the Duke of Bari, Ludovico Sforza, in order to cement an already friendly political alliance between the two families. The great â€œRenaissance manâ€ himself Leonardo da Vinci actually coordinated their wedding celebration! Beatrice was highly educated and carefully schooled in the rules of court. She lived in a time of great artists during a cultural rebirth as the Middle Ages moved toward the Modern Era. She demonstrated political acumen and savvy on her husbandâ€™s behalf as he usurped the rule of Milan making her Duchess of Milan in 1495. Beatrice died young in childbirth at the age of 21 (or as her husband wrote: â€œshe gave her spirit back to Godâ€), and yet accomplished much in her short years. A true â€œRenaissance womanâ€ known for her intelligence and charm, as well as her impeccable taste and style, Beatrice was one of the most accomplished princesses of her time. A fresco with her portrait faces da Vinci's Last Supper in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan.\n\nBeatrice of Provence was the youngest and one of four daughters born to the Count of Provence in the 13th century. She was so beautiful that she â€œset men's hearts thumpingâ€ and deprived them of reason when under her enchanting spell. Her eldest sister Margaret married the King of France (Louis IX), the next sister, Eleanor, married the King of England (Henry III), and the third sister, Sanchia, married the Earl of Cornwall (King Henry III of Englandâ€™s brother). That left Beatrice, the final sister, and what do you suppose she got? Everything. Thatâ€™s right. Her father left Beatrice Provence and the county of Forcalquier when he died making her the Countess of Provence in her own right (much to the chagrin of her sisters). Beatrice was now the most eligible heiress in all of Europe, and suitors she had in spades. So many that her mother was forced to hide the twelve year old girl and seek the protection of the Pope (Innocent IV). The Pope orchestrated a secret meeting and, after desired concessions were made, Beatrice was promised to Charles of Anjou (brother of the French king). James I of Aragon had hoped to marry the girl and unite Toulouse with Provence, but he was no match for Charlesâ€™ army of knights and was forced to retreat with dignity. Once he secured his position as â€œMr. Beatriceâ€, Charles wasted no time in taking power throughout Provence, alienating the nobility and causing quite a stir with Beatriceâ€™s mother (although Beatrice sided with her new husband). They finally placated the mother-in-law by giving her a percentage of the countyâ€™s revenues. Shortly thereafter Beatrice bravely accompanied her husband on the Seventh Crusade during which time she gave birth to two of her children (one in Cyprus and the other in Egypt). In the end, Charles was awarded the Kingdom of Sicily by the Pope but first he needed an army to defeat other contenders. The Kingdom of Sicily at the time constituted a massive portion of Italy covering not only the island of Sicily but the entire southern half of the boot. The equally ambitious Beatrice helped him raise the needed defense by promising gifts of money and jewels to her knights and other young men of France. After securing the Kingdom of Sicily, Beatrice became a Queen.\n\nSaint Beatrice (Beatrix) is a Portuguese saint on the Roman Catholic Calendar of saints known mainly for founding the Order of the Immaculate Conception, a contemplative order of Catholic nuns (her Feast Day is September 1). Beatrice was born into nobility in the 15th century and became a lady-in-waiting to Isabella, Queen Consort of Spain. Beatriceâ€™s great beauty stirred up enough jealousy in the Queen that she had the young girl locked up in a tiny prison cell. It was during this confinement that Beatrice had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary and was divinely instructed to found a new order in Maryâ€™s name. Beatrice escaped the Queenâ€™s imprisonment and took refuge in a monastery of nuns in Toledo, Spain where she lived a pious and contemplative life for the next several decades. At the age of 60, Beatrice would eventually take possession of the monastery for the new order known as the Immaculate Conception of Mary (ironically with the Queenâ€™s support).\n\nBeatrice was born into the prominent House of Este, a dynastic family of royal nobility, in the late 15th century.
