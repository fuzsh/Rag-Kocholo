        "text": ".\n\narte\n\nN. 82 - Ottobre 2014 (CXIII)\n\nCecilia o la Dama con lermellino\n\nClothing and Iconography: New discoveries - PART iI by Elisabetta Gnignera\n\nThe second interpretation, less immediate, and actually ambivalent, is in my opinion, the following: Cecilia Gallerani, (ie the mythical Galinthia-Galanthis), by distracting /capturing (before Beatrice of Estes arrival...) the attention of the Moro (maybe perhaps evoked in the Myth by the Moires/the three Fates) later was punished and expelled from the Court.\n\nBecause of Cecilias expulsion (which did not occur before February 1492, according to a letter addressed to Ludovico Sforza by Bernardo Bellincioni), Beatrice of Este was able to conceive the royal Heir, Ercole Massimiliano (born on the 25th, January, 1493).\n\nSince Cecilia aroused the ire of the goddess (Beatrice of Este), She was then punished by the expulsion from the Sforza Court and by Her removal from Ludovico (the Moor). From a metaphorical point of view, when the Portrait was still in progress (that is just prior to the final version of the Portrait which We know ) Cecilia could have been depicted by Leonardo with a weasel (?), which is the emblem of the punishment reserved to Galinthia (who was transformed into a weasel for deceiving the Goddess).\n\nAccording to this hypothesis, the following sequence of events may have occurred: Leonardo may have started Cecilias portrait, even before Cecilias pregnancy when, namely, the presence of a weasel or an ermine was not envisaged yet [ Figure 1, Part I], this being consistent with Pascal Cottes discoveries... (Cotte, 2014, pp. 200-207). In this, we might think that the poet Bernardo Bellincioni might have seen this very first version without the ermine as He does not mention any animal, at all.\n\nThe poet Bellincioni alludes to the Moor as an ermine  due to His loyalty and sincerity  in at least two sonnets, composed around the same date as the famous one, written to celebrate Cecilias portrait made by Leonardo: «Tutto ermellino è ben, se un nome ha nero» (Bellincioni, 1876, I, sonnet XXVII, p.56; my English translation: «He is a typical ermine, even if He has a black/dark name»); and still: «LItalico Morel bianco Ermellino» (Bellincioni, 1876, I, sonnet CXXVIII, p. 178; my English translation: «The Italic Moor. The White Ermine»).\n\nConsequently, the so strongly symbolic presence of the animal in the Portrait, would be  in all probability  not only recorded, but also abundantly described by the Poet, by virtue of the political- allegorical meanings that the animal conveyed and which Bellincioni already knew and used, exactly as an allusion to Ludovico (Solmi, 1912, pp. 491-509).\n\nAgain based on Pascal Cottes findings, one also assume that the Portrait may have been rethought, already by the early months of Cecilias pregnancy with Cesare  around October 1490  when Cecilias silhouette was not yet altered, which could possibly explain Her posture, traditionally ascribed to the Annunciation of the Virgin when being announced by the Angel, and evoked through the possible inclusion of a weasel. According to ancient legends, this animal was usually believed to conceive through the ear and to give birth through the mouth (see Part I).\n\nThe weasel was linked, par excellence, to the symbolism of the imminent birth in relation to the Myth of the Birth of Hercules that Leonardo might have known from the reading of the Metamorphoses of Ovid, recorded in His personal library (see Part I).\n\nAgain following Cottes evidences regarding the presumed insertion and reconstruction of the ermine (Cotte, 2014,pp. 147-154, 208-216)  as We know it in its final version  I therefore believe that the Painting may have been altered in the course of work, in at least two different moments: first, the Painting could have been modified after the birth of Caesar, perhaps assimilated to the new Hercules and therefore, the presumably preexisting weasel could be a hint of an original celebratory intent based upon this myth (in this sense, it has already been advanced the hypothesis, according to which, this portrait was commissioned by the Moro as a gift for the wedding of Cecilia Gallerani with Count Ludovico Carminati, known as the Bergamino, which occurred in July of 1492, after the birth of Cesare Visconti Sforza). Later  as pointed out by Pascal Cotte  the subsequent remaking of the ermine (which probably occurred after the birth of Ercole Massimiliano, legitimate son of the Moor?), turned the original weasel, into a white ermine; in my opinion, this change could fully comply with the sudden need to disguise any politically dangerous allusions; otherwise, the iconography would compare, as in the Myth, the two heirs: the natural son Cesare (Heracles-Hercules?) and the legitimate son Ercole Massimiliano (Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus?), together with the two women: Beatrice dEste (Hera-Juno?) much more powerful than the rival: the beautiful Cecilia (Almena, lover of Zeus? Aided by the legendary Galinthia, the weasel?).\n\nFurthermore, the ermine could consequently combine some symbols and references that the contemporaries would usually associate with Ludovico and - secondly - with the same Cecilia. First, it should be recalled that Ludovico Sforza had received the honorific investiture of the Order of the Ermine by the King of Naples perhaps since November 1486, (Rona, 1977 pp.346-358) but certainly before 1488: such high honors, although greatly desired by Ludovico, were nevertheless declined for political reasons by the same Ludovico in 1490 because of the conflicts which arose with the Aragoneses (Pescio, 2000, p. 64) after the marriage of Isabella of Aragon with Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Ludovicos nephew soon deprived of any authority by His uncle.\n\nThe fact that Ludovico had declined the coveted Honour around 1490, it was considered by some as a supporting element for a possible dating of the painting around that date.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, the correlation is not established because the poet Bernardo Bellincioni in His Rime  evidently composed within the 12th of September 1492  the date of His death, still alluded to the Moor as to «the Italic Moor, the White Ermine» for His loyalty and honesty in the Sonnet Sir Ludovicos prudence (my English translation).\n\nStill to Ludovico and to his own \"moderation (by a laudatory attitude) it was associated the proverbial moderanzia of the ermine which was dealt with, even by Leonardo da Vinci in the so-called \"bestiary\": a set of three notebooks dating back to 1494 and included into the \"Code H\". In His bestiary Leonardo wrote: «Because of its moderation, the ermine only eats once a day, and rather than taking its refuge in a muddy lair, the ermine allows the hunters to capture it so as not to stain its whiteness ». ( Manuscript H, f. 12 r). Leonardo also wrote: « Moderation restrains all vices. The ermine would rather die than get dirty» (Manuscript H f.48v).\n\nAgain as an encomiastic prerogative of Cecilia Gallerani, seems to have been envisioned by contemporaries, that very same honesty and loyalty, evoked through the Ermine. This peculiar (Ermines) symbolism was sifted out by Marco Versiero who provided us, in my view, a quite relevant allusively reversed interpretation when writing such passages: «Although it has often been interpreted as an allusion to the feminine virtues of the portrayed Lady, the animal [ermine] actually serves to present Ludovico in disguise. [This happens] Not only to avoid a direct reference to the relationship with a woman other than His bride (the niece of the King of Naples, Beatrice d'Este), but, on the contrary, to exhibit such a liaison as a representation of the kind of unofficial relationships woven by Ludovico Sforza a latere of the network of official powers involving His nephew Gian Galeazzo and the men loyal to Him. We are faced with a disguised presentation of a primary couple arisen from a somewhat lateral union (the non-Duke Ludovico and the non-Duchess Cecilia); [This couple] is at the origin of that demi-monde pro-Ludovico, whose necessity of taking roots must be perceived, at the historical and political moment under discussion, (that is before the death of the rightful duke), as the only possible means of personal and political success.\n\nIn this sense, the recognition of the natural son born to Cecilia in 1491 is fully explained as well as the acceptance by Cecilia, of a first-rank status at Court, in quality of Duchess in pectore even superior to the rightful First Lady: Isabella of Aragon  wife of Gian Galeazzo  to an extent that exactly coincides with the measure by which Ludovico prevailed on the latter [Gian Galeazzo] in the effective leadership of the dukedom» (Versiero, 2006, pp.13-14: my English translation).\n\nTherefore, according to the above-mentioned premises, Leonardo could have decided, at a later stage, to focus ones attention on the more innocuous ermine as a symbolic animal, possibly alluding to the Family Name of Cecilia Gallerani (?) as well as to the Order of the Ermine (whose investiture was bestowed on Ludovico Sforza between 1486 and 1488 by the King of Naples), and, finally, to the honesty and loyalty attributed to both Ludovico Sforza and Cecilia Gallerani.\n\nThese last moral qualities were steadily attributed by Bernardo Bellincioni, poet at the Sforza Court, to Ludovico il Moro that is «L Italico Morel bianco Ermellino» (Bellincioni, 1876, I, sonetto CXXVIII, p.178; my English translation: «the Italic Moor, the white Ermine»), through allegorical verses.\n\nThe final choice ( to turn the weasel into an ermine ) would therefore appear, much more balanced and less risky for the artist, who actually needed, not only Ludovicos protection, of course, but also the support of the influential Beatrice.\n\nMoreover, once informed of the birth of His son Cesare, on May 9th, 1491, when the relationship with Cecilia was no longer at its best, it was Ludovico himself who informed Beatrice of the event, as tactfully as possible, according to the Este s correspondent Giacomo Trotti: «Before His departure from Vigevano, with great humanity and gentleness His Lordship informed the illustrious Duchess,Your daughter, of the birth of the Child. He told Her that a boy and a servant was born to Him, and that, as soon as He grows up a little, He would make Him available to Her so that She could avail herself of Him like the noblemen and the noblewomen used to do with servants. He swore to Her that he had not touched the babys mother [Cecilia] from the second day of the Carnival on, and that He had decided that He would not touch Her [Cecilia ] by using tactful words in saying this. To which [words ] the Lady Duchess answered very cheerfully and with appropriate words in a satisfactory manner so gently that anybody could not have done better. Because of the above-mentioned answer, the aforementioned Ludovico was so much satisfied and happy, as to put Beatrice above the nine heavens [on a pedestal/on top of the world]».\n\nFollowing this documentary evidence  whose text has been derived by the present writer, by comparison with different versions of the very same document published in several texts (Covini, 2009, p. 97; Pizzagalli, 2008, p. 129; Lopez, 2009, pp.122-123)  it becomes apparent that the relationship between the Moor and Cecilia as well as the status of the woman and Her son, had already radically changed after the birth of Caesar: by Ludovicos words, instead of being considered a second Hercules, Caesar is even downgraded to being a \"servant\" of Beatrice...Such an interpretation together with the introduction of the ermine, could postpone the dating of the remaking and the final version of The Lady with an Ermine at least to the years: 1491-93.\n\nIts exactly during the years 1493-1494, that Leonardo sketched a new political allegory referred to Ludovico il Moro, that is the intended allegory of the Ermine with mud.Galeazzo between calm weather andflight of fortune, included into Manuscript H at folio 98 recto and dating to about 1494. In the previous years, Leonardo had already dealt with the themes of moderation and prudence as distinctive attributes of the Moor, through other political allegories; among the examples - carefully studied by Marco Versiero, in a recent contribution quoted herein  I wish to mention: the Allegoria dello Stato di Milano dating to 1485-1488; (my English translation: the Allegory of the State of Milan alias the Allegory of the government of the Dukedom of Milan) sketched with pen and brown ink on yellowed paper; the drawing is included in Oxford, Christ Church Collection inv. JBS 18 (0037); the Allegory of the Moro cogl occhiali e la nvidia colla falsa infamia dipinta e la giustizia nera pel Moro dating to about 1494 (my English translation: the Allegory of the Moor with spectacles and the Envy together with the False Infamy painted and the Justice [in] black for the Moro\"), a red chalk drawing retouched by pen and ink on white paper. The sketch is collected in the Musée Bonnat in Bayonne ( inv.656 recto).\n\nLeonardo was probably asked by Ludovico, to impress progressively, through His work, the collective imagination, by establishing a clear correspondence between the political virtue of moderation and Ludovicos own figure and actions. According to Versiero, this is evident, even considering the sketches for the scenic equipment ( about 1491: a drawing in red pencil, pen and ink, included in the Ms. Arundel 263 at folio P1  formerly 250 which is accompanied by notes for the scenic equipment of one of the knights participating in the tournament organized by Galeazzo Sanseverino (captain of the Milanese militias) on the occasion of the Marriage of Ludovico il Moro and Beatrice d 'Este (1491). On this subject, Versiero expressed himself as follows: «Since this detailed study relates definitely to the figure of Prudence enthroned, [...]it may be inferred that We are in the presence of an early portrayal of the Prudence of the Moor with a pharaonic costume, subsequently codified, by a more complex allegorical device, in the paper of Bayonne. The notes accompanying the drawings, in fact, document the intention of Leonardo to paint on a wheel whose center is placed in the middle of the rear leg of the horse, a figure of Prudence [ Prudenzia] dressed in red because of the charity, and seated on a throne of fire [with] a paper and a laurel branch in Her hand to signify the Hope originating from conveniently serving» (Versiero, 2010, p.110).\n\nIn this case, the political declination for the Ermine soiled with mud, a political allegory coeval to the Favola or Allegoria dellermellino (The ermine as a symbol of purity) a sketch made by Leonardo on a tondo of 91 mm in diameter with pen, dark ink and black, now preserved at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (Accession number PD.120-1961) and considered as a draft sketch for an allegorical medal [Figure 4] is to be read in a two ways.\n\n.\n\nFigure 4\n\n.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, the Favola or Allegoria dellermellino (The ermine as a symbol of purity), approx. 1494 ‒ a sketch on a tondo of 91 mm in diameter made in pen, dark ink and black chalk on paper, and referred to as a draft sketch for an allegorical medal. Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum (Accession number PD.120-1961)\n\nOn one hand, the Ermine soiled with mud is likely to be read as a symbolic response to the allegations (the mud thrown onto the ermine...) which were addressed to Ludovico il Moro in those years. Actually, Ludovico was considered guilty of having got rid and imprisoned, in September 1489, some men loyal to Gian Galeazzo: the noble Ghibelline Pallavicino Pallavicini, Aloisio Terzago (elsewhere Luigi Terzaghi), and His brother Filippo Eustachi . In the eyes of many, Ludovico was generally guilty of having usurped by deception, the power of His nephew and rightful Duke Gian Galeazzo who will die of the disease (? by poisoning) on October 22nd, 1494;\n\nOn the other hand, the allegory should be read as a veiled accusation (charged by the Artist), about the ambiguous behavior of Ludovico personified by the ermine soiled with mud: at this regard, I wish to expose hereafter the annotations expressed by Marco Versiero in respect of the above-mentioned allegory: «An enigmatic annotation of Leonardo, Ermine with mud.Galeazzo between calm weather andflight of fortune, provides us the probable sign of a political allegory where the virtue of moderanziawhich the ermine (that is Ludovico) is endowed with  allows Him [the ermine/Ludovico] to attend the alternation of bad and good luck in the life of His nephew: but the expression ermine soiled with mud to mean for an ermine which renounced its purity and became soiled with mud, could also refer to the sudden choice of Ludovico to abandon a moderate political attitude to undertake an audacious coup de main. Indeed, the allegory of the tempo nimboso [ cloudy weather] which Leonardo alludes to, in the second part of the note, could be read in this sense: Galeazzo fell from a quiet time down to a situation where benign Luck abandoned him (fleeing Luck). The meaning is reversed, therefore, compared to the (more conventional) one, embraced so far, by scholars (Galeazzo, passing from storm to calm thanks to the protection and guidance of his uncle); in confirmation of Leonardos interest for aspects related to Ludovicos unscrupulous administration» (Versiero, 2004, pp.111-112; italics mine).\n\nSimilarly  behind an apparent symbolism alluding to the virtues of the Moro and of Cecilia Gallerani  in The Lady with an Ermine, there may actually be hidden, in my opinion, an encrypted denunciation of the struggles of power to the detriment of Cecilia Gallerani. The Myth of The Birth of Hercules perfectly fits these struggles. In support of this hypothesis, showing a constant modus operandi of Leonardo, I quote once again from Marco Versiero, a fine interpreter, in my opinion, of the political and allegorical scenarios in which Leonardo operates: «In fact, Leonardo is comparable to any other inventor of allegories both for the choice of themes ( possibly determined by the Patron, directly or through the mediation of some learned scholar) and for the use of two species of symbols: the heraldic symbols ( recalling the family origins and the lineage of the patron) and the propagandistic symbols (inspired by the Patrons contingent political conduct and by His alliances with other powers).\n\nNevertheless  as Martin Kemp has correctly pointed out  the difficulty of fully deciphering Leonardos allegories, lies in the fact that the animals and plants encoded by emblemata (even through glyptics) stand for Leonardo da Vinci, as simple elements of nature, thus preserving their vitality and variety and therefore they end by presenting ambiguous, or at least, versatile meanings »(Versiero, 2006, p.9; italics mine). Still considering the changes made by Leonardo on the size of the animal (ermine), it should be noted that the difference between a weasel and an ermine, was quite clear to Leonardos contemporaries: the aforementioned poet Bernardo Bellincioni, boasted, in His verses, not to be so silly and foolish that He could not distinguish the weasel (el Donel) from the ermine:\n\nI'm not so coarse and foolish,\n\nto buy the weasel instead of the ermine:\n\nnowadays its You who are a greenhorn\n\n(Bellincioni, I, 1876, I, sonnet C.I., p.147: my English translation).\n\nEven though the above-mentioned assumptions can be very fascinating, they must however, be examined in the light of rigorous historical evidences: since Bernardo Bellincioni composed the sonnet Sopra il ritratto di Madonna Cecilia, qual fece Leonardo (On Leonardos Portrait of Madonna Cecilia) before His death occurred on the 12th of September, 1492. We can infer that by this time, the Portrait of Cecilia was near completion (?). Maybe Leonardo was making changes as Pascal Cotte highlighted by His studies - modifying, in some way, the original version of the Portrait... after this date...\n\nThe subsequent introduction of the ermine, together with its revised proportions when considered in relation to the symbolism conveyed by the grecian Myth of The Birth of Hercules may give rise to at least two possible scenarios within which Leonardo has developed his creative processing: a first possible scenario, in my view, involves the possibility that the Portrait was possibly started before the birth of Caesar Visconti Sforza (on May 3rd, 1491) to be then reworked after Caesars Birth, when the sex of the child was finally certain and Cecilias silhouette was no longer altered by advanced pregnancy. At the same time, Cecilia was in a favorable status to consent the creation of a sophisticated enigma arising from the Myth of Hercules Birth; maybe Leonardo assimilated Cecilia to Alcmene, unaware Mistress of Zeus and mother of His natural son, and/or Leonardo assimilated Her to Galanthis, the woman then transformed into a weasel.\n\nThe habit of alluding to the identity of the portrayed Lady by using learned figurative rebus, was one of Leonardos typical aptitudes. This scenario, which would support the hypothesis of an original intention of the artist to celebrate the natural son of the Moro, Caesar, by mythologizing His conception, should be reconsidered retroactively, in my opinion, with respect to a later combination of occurrences.\n\nIn a very short time, this combination caused the full coincidence between the names of the protagonists of the events that We are describing here, and one of the most famous versions of the Greek Myth of The Birth of Hercules.\n\nAccording to a second scenario, the introduction of the presumed weasel into the Painting, could allude to mythical birth of Hercules: the weasels introduction could have probably taken place, during Ercole Massimilianos gestation in 1492. By this time, Leonardo might have known about Ludovicos and Beatrices wish to name their firstborn son Ercole like the maternal Grandfather in case the child was male ( and not a female). This name may have inspired the Artist with the idea to recall the Myth of Hercules Birth where both the maid Galanthis and the weasel ( depending on the different versions..) had played a very active role.\n\nTherefore, metaphorically speaking, Cecilia Gallerani, by leaving the Sforza Court, had made possible Beatrices conception of Ercole Massimiliano...\n\nThis inspiration could then have been revised by the Artist, to avoid incurring in dangerous implications which were politically contaminated and that could possibly contaminate the myth which had given rise to this figurative choice.\n\nMaybe the artist did not want to run the risk of vexing Beatrice d'Este (Hera?) by referring to Cecilia (mistress or weasel?), as a second Alcmene who, after giving birth to Caesar ( the adulterous son of the Moro: just like in the Greek Myth), parted from Ludovico, thus allowing Beatrice to conceive the rightful Heir then born to light: Ercole Massimiliano Sforza?\n\nErcole Massimiliano, the eldest son of the Moor, born on the 25th of January 1493, was baptized with the name of Ercole, in honor of his maternal grandfather, but He was then called Massimiliano in order to please the eponymous emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg (Vienna, March 22, 1459 - Wels, January 12, 1519) who married in 1494, Bianca Maria Sforza, niece of Ludovico il Moro.\n\nGiven the aforementioned hypotheses, We must now cross-check the biographical data of the possible protagonists of this story: immortalized in the so-called Sforza Altarpiece, almost in their entirety, should We decide to cautiously put in doubt the identification of the child close to Ludovico il Moro, with Cesare Visconti Sforza... (could He be  more plausibly in my view  Francesco Maria Sforza, Gian Galeazzos only son, born on the 30th of January 1491 and called the Duchetto?) [Figures 5-6].\n\n.\n\nFigure 5\n\n.\n\nMaster of the Sforza Altarpiece, Holy conversation with Madonna enthroned with Child and the Doctors of the Church: St. Ambrose, Saint Gregory the Great, St. Augustine and St. Jerome, 1494-95. Milan, Pinacoteca of Brera\n\n.\n\nFigure 6\n\n.\n\nSforza Altarpiece: detail of the Patrons: Ludovico Sforza and Beatrice of Este with their firstborn son, Ercole Massimiliano (paired with Beatrice) and the presumed Cesare Visconti Sforza (?) natural son of Ludovico, paired, in this case, with His father (?).\n\nIf considering that Caesar Sforza Visconti was born on May 3th, 1491 and that Beatrice of Este will give birth to Her first son Ercole Massimiliano on January 25th,1493, the changes related to the ermine and brought to light by Pascal Cotte, might even be placed in a period of time in-between the two events.\n\nI can think of an advanced stage in Beatrice of Estes pregnancy, maybe within September 12, 1492 (?): date of the death of the poet Bernardo Bellincioni who saw the Painting and described it but by omitting any reference to the ermine in the wellknown sonnet whose composition represents our terminus ad quem for a possible intermediate dating of the Painting, possibly, a few months before the birth of Ercole Massimiliano. In this later stage of Beatrice d'Estes pregnancy, We cannot exclude the possibility that Leonardo was aware of Ludovicos and Beatrices intention to name the baby Ercole if it was a male  just like the mythical Hero of our relevance, and in honor of His maternal grandfather. Such a combination of events, could have caused the artists need to change the iconography of the Portrait, through the magnification of the animal that would become an ermine out of the previous weasel, as a tribute to the figure of Ludovico and His moral and political virtues symbolized by the mythical animal.\n\nThe ermine would also allude to Cecilia Gallerani, as well, thus evoking Her Familys name. This rethinking of the Portraits iconography, maybe, had the purpose to avoid a dangerous situation of impasse when it would be inappropriate to represent Cecilia as a second Alcmene, mother of Heracles, at the moment when Beatrice was giving birth to the rightful Heir, the new Hercules, in name and in fact, if it was a boy...\n\nTherefore, considering the details of clothing and the possible symbolism as conveyed both by the initial iconographical choice to represent perhaps a weasel and the subsequent one, derived by the replacing of the weasel with the current ermine, in my opinion, the most plausible scenario is that the Portrait could be started even before Caesar Sforza Viscontis conception ( within May-June 1490) but I think, ultimately, that the Painting was a work in progress, modified because of some decisive events such as: during Caesar Sforza Viscontis gestation and after His birth (3rd May 1491); during Ercole Massimilianos gestation and after His birth ( 25th January, 1493).\n\nThese assumptions lead me to assume that Leonardo went beyond the date of death of Bernardo Bellincioni  maybe even after the birth of Hercules Massimiliano  to rehash (by bringing it to an end), the portrait that Bellincioni could possibly have seen and described in the wellknown sonnet composed before His death, occurred on September 12th, 1492.\n\nPerhaps Bellincioni had access to the already-done painting by the original version without the ermine and which preexisted (maybe a few years ...) to the final version which was preserved till now.\n\nAfter all, in the sonnet, Bellincioni did not mention either a weasel or an ermine; most likely, the eventual ermines presence would have been described by the poet under the strong symbolic implications of this animal which was considered by His contemporaries (among them We include the poet himself), as emblematic of Ludovico il Moro.\n\nTo be clear, I wish to emphasize once again, that these hypotheses of dating, arise from a joint analysis of the clothings details, which the present writer previously highlighted in Pascal Cottes book Lumière on the Lady with an Ermine/Lumière sur la Dame à lHermine (Cotte, 2014, pp. 21-23, 78 -87, 171, 178, 182, 217), as well as in the introduction to this paper, together with some of the most relevant and hitherto unpublished discoveries of remakes managed by Leonardo da Vinci and illustrated by Pascal Cotte.\n\nThese findings suggested me some possible and intentional connections with the mythological legend of The Birth of Hercules. This mythological legend, when translated into the events going on at the Sforza court, constitutes in itself, a kind of chronological reference within the Portrait, related, in my opinion, to the months of May and June 1491, soon after the birth of Caesar Visconti Sforza, till the advanced pregnancy of Beatrice d'Este, by the 12th of September 1492: terminus ad quem due to the death of Bernardo Bellincioni who saw and described the Portrait but during an intermediate stage since the Portrait may have been revised and completed by the artist even after the birth of Ercole Massimiliano Sforza occurred on the 25th of January, 1493."
