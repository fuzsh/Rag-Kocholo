        "text": "She was the second of the six children of Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Leonora of Aragon, daughter of Ferrante I of Naples. Her appearance, however, proved no cause of rejoicing, because every one wished for a boy. No one in Ferrara then dreamt that the babe who received so cold a welcome would one day reign over the Milanese, as the wife of Ludovico Sforza, the most powerful of Italian princes, and would herself be remembered by posterity as \"la più zentil donna in Italia\" ( the sweetest lady in all Italy). She was called Beatrice after two favourite relatives of her parents. Leonora's only sister, Beatrice of Aragon, and one Ercole's half-sister, Beatrice d’ Este. Leonora and her two little daughters set out for Naples to be present at her father King Ferrante's second marriage with the young infanta Juana of Aragon, a sister of Fernando the Catholic.\n\nBeatrice, who had won her grandfather's affections, remained at Naples for eight years and grew up in the royal palace, far from her parents and sister Isabella. In these early days many personages with whom she was to be closely associated in after-years were living at Naples. There were scholars and poets whom she was to meet again in Milan at her husband's court, and who would be glad to remind her that they had known her as a child in her grandfather's palace.\n\nThe houses of Sforza and Este had always been on friendly terms, and Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Bari and Regent of Milan, asked Ercole d'Este to give him the hand of his elder daughter Isabella. Unfortunately, his youthful daughter had already been sought in marriage by Federico, Marquis of Mantua, on behalf of his elder son, Giovanni Francesco; and Ercole offered Ludovico Sforza the hand of his younger daughter, Beatrice. The Duke of Bari made no objection to this arrangement. Her royal grandfather, old King Ferrante, gave his sanction to the proposed marriage, although he refused to part from his little grandchild at present, and when, five years later, Beatrice returned to Ferrara, she assumed the title and estate of Duchess of Bari, and was publicly recognized as Ludovico's promised wife.\n\nOn 17 January 1491, the long-delayed wedding finally took place in the Castello of Pavia.The first impression which the youthful bride made on her husband was evidently favourable. By all accounts, Beatrice was a singularly lovely and fascinating child. From the first she seems to have become sincerely attached to Ludovico, who, although considerably older than herself, and already thirty-nine years of age, was a very handsome and splendid-looking man, of imposing stature and striking countenance, with courteous manners and gentle ways. And however often he may have excited her jealousy or wounded her feelings, his young wife never wavered in her love for him, but proved, as he himself confessed, the best and most devoted of companions. Beatrice bore him two sons, Maximiliano and Francesco.\n\nIn Beatrice d'Este, Ludovico possessed a wife admirably adapted to share his aims and preside over his court. Her youth and beauty lent a new lustre to the court, her quick intelligence and cultured tastes led her to appreciate the society of poets and scholars. The natural love of splendour, which she shared with her husband, went hand-in-hand with artistic invention. Her rich clothes and jewels were distinguished by their refinement and rare workmanship. The fashions which she introduced were marked by their elegance and beauty. She took especial delight in music and poetry, and gave signs of a fine and discriminating literary judgment. Beatrice helped to make Sforza Castle a center of sumptuous festivals and balls and she loved entertaining philosophers, poets, diplomats and soldiers. And like Ludovico, she knew not only how to attract learned men, poets, artists, and musicians, but how to retain them in her service. Leonardo da Vinci and Donato Bramante were employed at the court. Her patronage contributed to a number of buildings, including the Sforza Castle in Milan and Certosa di Pavia. Like Isabella d'Este and most of her contemporaries, Beatrice was very fond of scartino and other fashionable card-games, and had the reputation of being exceptionally lucky.\n\nBut whether it was that Beatrice in her turn had become ambitious to bear the title of Duchess of Milan and see her son recognized as heir to the crown, or whether the birth of his son stirred up new desires in her lord's breast, it is certain that the spring of 1493 was a turning-point in Ludovico's career. From this time he began to aim at reigning in his nephew Gian Galeazzo's stead, and applied himself in good earnest to obtain legal recognition of his title. Despite this early warmth between Beatrice and her cousin Isabella of Aragon, Gian Galeazzo’s wife, the relationship suffered due to Ludovico's political schemes. Beatrice takes a leading part in political affairs, and comes before the Doge of Venice and Senate as her husband's ambassador and spokeswoman. Beatrice was always frank and generous in her behaviour to her sister Isabella d’Este, and the marchioness remained sincerely attached to her.\n\nWhile Ludovico and Beatrice were pursuing the objects of their ambition, the unfortunates Gian Galeazzo and his wife Isabella of Aragon retired to Pavia, and were rarely seen in public again. Gian Galeazzo died in 1494 in the presence of his wife and mother and the doctors who had attended him during the last few weeks. The throne of Milan fell to Ludovico, who hastened to assume the ducal title and received the ducal crown from the Milanese nobles. The unhappy Gian Galeazzo, it was openly said at Florence and Venice, had, it was plain, died of poison, administered by his uncle. Beatrice expressed sympathy with the unhappy widow of Gian Galeazzo, and showed real concern for her cousin's melancholy condition. On her arrival to Milan, Isabella of Aragon was received by Beatrice. Until the death of Beatrice, Isabella and her children occupied the rooms in the Castello where she and her husband had formerly resided, and spent the spring and summer in the Castello of Pavia.\n\nAfter the Battle of Fornovo in 1495, Ludovico an Beatrice took part in the peace congress of Vercelli between Charles VIII of France and the Italian princes, at which she showed great political ability. Ludovico received a letter from Henry VII of England rejoicing with his new ally on the conclusion of the League against France, and the visit of the emperor to Italy. The singular charm and intelligence of Beatrice made a deep impression upon Maximilian I of Austria. Although Ludovico loved his wife intensely, he took Lucrezia Crivelli for his mistress, a thing which caused Beatrice the most bitter anguish of mind, but could not alter her love for him. And remorse for the pain which he had caused Beatrice gave the sharpest sting to Ludovico's own despair, on that sad day when he wept for his young wife's early death. On 3 January 1497, Beatrice died after gave birth to a still-born son. The duke's grief was said to be terrible.\n\nSources:\n\nJulia Cartwright, BEATRICE D'ESTE DUCHESS OF MILAN 1475-1497\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Sforza"
