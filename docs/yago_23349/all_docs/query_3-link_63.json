The six-sided dome dominating the landscape is an architectural delight. Not to mention the interiors adorned with frescos by Bernardo Zenale and Bramantino, which will take you on a journey through Milan’s golden age.\n\nIf you’re planning a visit to the church, here are some of the exhibits and tours you cannot miss.\n\nThe Last Supper\n\nThe church boasts World Heritage Site status, home to Da Vinci’s most famous masterpiece – Il Cenacolo Vinciano (The Last Supper).\n\nThe Last Supper is Leonardo da Vinci’s world-famous work of art, commissioned by the Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza, his patron at the time. Sforza wanted to transform the church into a mausoleum for the family and planned to adorn it with paintings and frescos. It’s believed that Leonardo began his work between 1495 and 1497, completing the project in 1498.\n\nHoused in the refectory of the former Dominican Convent, the mural portrays the moment when Christ tells his apostles that one of the group will betray him at dawn. The masterpiece became famous for its revolutionary painting techniques; he chose oil painting over frescos and opted for chiaroscuro – a greater intensity of lights and shades.\n\nIf you’re visiting Santa Maria delle Grazie, you can’t leave without stopping at Da Vinci’s unrivalled masterpiece. But don’t forget to look at the opposite wall too! Giovanni Donato’s Crucifixion is another impressive Renaissance fresco. You can book a private tour, which lasts about 20 minutes. Ticket availability is always minimal, so we recommend booking them well in advance.\n\nRenaissance period tour\n\nSanta Maria delle Grazie is one of Italy’s finest examples of Renaissance architecture, thanks to Renaissance Master Donato Bramante.\n\nThe church boasts an imposing single-apse chapel, a majestic drum-shaped dome surrounded by columns and the beautiful Chiostro delle rane (Frog Cloister). The square cloister has five terracotta arches sustained by columns and marble capitals.\n\nIf you want to learn about the Renaissance period, take a three-hour guided tour around the church, the cloister and its Baroque chapel. The experience includes a visit to Milan’s own Sistine Chapel – San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore – and a walk around Sempione Park.\n\nSanta Maria delle Grazie history and building facts\n\nSanta Maria delle Grazie dates back to the 15th century. Count Gaspare Vimercati, commander of Francesco Sforza’s troops, donated a frescoed chapel to the Dominicans to build a church and a convent. Sforza assigned the project to architect Guiniforte Solari, who started designing the Gothic nave in 1463 and completed it in 1469. But the construction of the church itself took much longer.\n\nDuke Ludovico Sforza, also known as Ludovico il Moro, wanted to transform the church into a mausoleum of the whole family. He entrusted Donato Bramante to build a six-sided dome, semi-circular apses, a refectory and a cloister. Bramante completed the work in 1490, although nobody, except for Beatrice d’Este, was ever buried there. Her grave was later moved to the Certosa di Pavia cemetery.\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, many of the Milanese nobilities took part in the construction of the chapels. They commissioned some of the best Italian artists, such as Antonello da Messina and Ferrari, to decorate these spaces.\n\nDuring WWII, an aerial bombardment hit the church and convent, destroying the library and the left side of the church with all its chapels. The attack also severely damaged most of the walls in the refectory, except for Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece The Last Supper, which was protected by sandbags. However, Pinin Brambilla undertook a significant restoration project from 1978 to 1999, when the painting was again exhibited to the public.\n\nBut Santa Maria delle Grazie is not only the home of Da Vinci’s unrivalled talent. It’s also frescoed with other Italian masterpieces, including Stories of the Passion by Gaudenzio Ferrari, Resurrection and Passion by Bernardo Zenale and Bramantino’s Madonna of the Towers. Not to mention Bramante’s architectural genius. His Sacrestia Vecchia (Old Sacresty) is today used as the seat of a Dominican Cultural Centre – the Centro Culturale alle Grazie.\n\nThanks to its invaluable cultural heritage, the ultimate expression of the Renaissance, Santa Maria delle Grazie has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980 and remains one of Italy’s most priceless gems.\n\nRestaurants, bars and shops near Santa Maria delle Grazie\n\nConveniently located for all the main attractions, including Sempione Park, Sforzesco Castle and the Arco della Pace, the area surrounding Santa Maria delle Grazie is studded with bars, restaurants and shops.\n\nWhether you want a bite at a local trattoria to explore Milan’s latest fashions or enjoy an aperitivo as the sun sets, you’ll be spoilt for choice in this part of the city.
