        "text": "Ludovico was born in Milan, in Palazzo dell’Arengo, on 3 August 1452.\n\nHe was the fourth son of Francesco Sforza and Bianca Maria Visconti\n\nwho, in a letter to her husband on 8 August, described their newborn\n\nas “a beautiful little boy, who looks darker than all of the others”,\n\nas he had a darker skin tone than his siblings.\n\nThis was one of Ludovico’s defining features,\n\nwith various sources describing him as having dark skin,\n\nblack hair and eyes, even when he was an adult.\n\nHis father would often call him “Maurum”, meaning “the Moor”,\n\nwhich can be seen from a document dating back to 1461,\n\nwhen Ludovico was only nine years old.\n\nSforza grew up to be a strong and intelligent boy, receiving a military and cultural education, and like many men of his social standing, he loved to go hunting.\n\nHe was very skilled at dealing with matters of government and administration, and possessed a vast humanistic culture. What’s more, despite not being the eldest child, he had all the right characteristics to rule over the Duchy.\n\nWhen his older brother Galeazzo Maria was killed in a conspiracy on Saint Stephen’s Day, on 26 December 1476, power was handed down to his seven-year-old son Gian Galeazzo and his widow Bona of Savoy, who served as regent for her child.\n\nIn order to strengthen the Duchy’s alliances, in 1489,\n\nLudovico arranged the marriage between Gian Galeazzo\n\nand Isabella of Aragon, the granddaughter\n\nof King Ferdinand I of Naples.\n\nThe wedding took place on 5 February, although the real festivities\n\nwere on 13 January 1490, when the halls of Sforza Castle in Milan hosted\n\nIl Paradiso (also called The Feast of Paradise). This was a lavish theatrical\n\nperformance curated by Leonardo da Vinci that left\n\nthe audience astonished and in awe.\n\nFinally, in 1494, Ludovico Sforza officially became the Duke of Milan.\n\nHe kept this title until 1499, when the French troops\n\nof King Louis XII invaded Italy, which forced him to flee to Germany.\n\nWhen he came back, he was captured by the French and taken to France,\n\nwhere he died in prison on 27 May 1508."
