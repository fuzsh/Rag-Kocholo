        "text": "Chapter 1. Amerigo at the Inn\n\nAmerigo walked out of Palazzo Medici taking the garden gate towards Via de Ginori. He walked towards the Basilica San Lorenzo. The Basilica San Lorenzo was the Medici family’s chapel and housed the tombs of many late Medici figures and also of some exceptional artists.\n\nOn Thursday afternoons, outside of the Basilica San Lorenzo, a crowd usually gathered awaiting the offering by Father Del Arrio. Amerigo walked through the crowd avoiding the looks. When he had passed the Basilica he noticed Father Barecci stepping out of the Basilica’s aft gate.\n\nShortly after noticing Father Barecci, Amerigo turned towards the Basilica and crossed himself three times. He then continued walking.\n\nWhile continuing his path south, he saw a middle-aged lady scolding a young boy, whose hands had an odd, yellow tint to them. He walked pass without paying much attention.\n\nShortly after passing Piazza di San Giovanni, he overheard a conversation between three youths saying:\n\n“Yes, they just got a major commission from France and Master Ghirlandaio is planning to significantly expand his workshop”.\n\nHe continued walking.\n\nAmerigo walked pass the baptistery of San Giovanni, where he had been baptized as a child.\n\nShortly after, he overheard a conversation from a small group to his right.\n\n“Yeah, all these sketches are great and all, but I am telling you man, if you want to have a real shot at making it big, like Master Brunelleschi big, you have to get into the Medici Academy.”\n\nWalking south along Via Roma Amerigo noticed an older man with long, gray hair walking and yelling:\n\n“Great democracy we have here. They have money for all these statues and villas, but no money to feed the orphans from the last plague”.\n\nHe started thinking, another one of these deranged idealists, they are almost as bad as the Artsters.\n\nLately, Amerigo had been feeling barely any enthusiasm for his surroundings in Florence. He had grown bored of Florence. He had lived in Florence most of his life and knew the city too well.\n\nIn the last ten years, he had spent just a single year away, on a diplomatic mission to Paris with his other uncle, Guido Antonio Vespucci, who later became the Florentine ambassador to the French Court.\n\nThen about four yeas ago, Pierfrancesco had dispatched Amerigo on a month-long assignment to Seville, to investigate and assess the Medici Bank’s main representative there.\n\nAfter the Medici Bank had expanded all across Europe, Amerigo wanted to explore other European mega-cities.\n\nFor Amerigo, Florence had become almost suffocating with its sculpture-packed facades, frescos and the scores of “Artsters” roaming the streets.\n\nAmerigo called them Artsters, all those, whose outward appearance was their only real association with art. They all wore large-brimmed, red hats, which were lately so fashionable in the arts community. They all wore blue tunics and walked around the city’s streets prominently carrying brushes in their hands or musical instruments around their shoulders.\n\nAmerigo often said that everyone in Florence claimed to be a painter, even those who have never completed a single painting in their lives. He thought that there were many great artists in Florence but also many Artsters.\n\nWhile walking along Via Roma, he passed the inn run by his old-time acquaintance Massimilliano. Amerigo slowed down and gazed at the door, which had a newly painted red sign. He did not want to go to the office yet, so he decided to enter the inn to have a glass of wine.\n\nThe inn was dank and poorly lit. The front portion of the inn had a horseshoe-shaped counter behind which stood Massimilliano. Towards the right was a large, open area where tables and benches were arranged.\n\nAmerigo could make out some silhouettes in the back of the open area. He quickly scanned the open area.\n\nAt one table in the far left sat three men all of whom wore large-brimmed, red hats and blue tunics with different patterns. They were engulfed in a lively conversation. One of the men had a red cloth wrapped around his arm.\n\nNearer to the door sat a man with his head on the table. The man seemed to be passed out. He was wearing a shabby brown cloak.\n\nIn the far right sat a young couple frolicking around and occasionally giving out some giggles.\n\nTowards the back sat two middle-aged ladies, dressed in scandalous, bright dresses with sleeves so short that one could see their bare arms.\n\nOne of the ladies looked familiar to Amerigo, but he could not fully recall her. He assumed that they were aspiring art models.\n\nThe counter was empty with the exception of a stout man sitting at the left corner. The man was gazing at a half-full glass in front of him and was apparently engulfed in deep thoughts.\n\nMassimilliano was wiping the left side of the counter when Amerigo walked in. As Amerigo walked up towards the counter, he exclaimed with a laughter:\n\nAmerigo: “Massimilliano you dirty dog, how is life treating you?”\n\nMassimilliano looked up in surprise. His face became animated as he saw Amerigo. He had not seen Amerigo for some time. He quickly exclaimed:\n\nMassimilliano: “Great to see you Migo. I hear you are a big fish at the Medici Bank now.”\n\nAmerigo approached the counter, sat down and replied:\n\nAmerigo: “Yes, times have changed. Things are finally going my way.”\n\nMassimilliano nodded and said:\n\nMassimilliano: “I have heard that you are even invited to La Grande Festa.”\n\nAmerigo proudly replied: “Yes, I will be at La Grande Festa! Who would have thought.”\n\nHe chuckled.\n\nMassimilliano’s face lit up slightly and he said:\n\nMassimilliano: “I have always wondered what it is like at La Grande Festa. I have heard so much about it. They say it is like being in a magical dream.”\n\nAmerigo replied:\n\nAmerigo: “Yes, I have heard a lot about La Grande Festa as well. I am pretty excited. And soon I shall find out. Imagine, the greatest Italian aristocrats will be there, together with the best artists and the most beautiful art models of Italy.\n\nI can’t wait. It is going to be crazy!”\n\nAmerigo’s face lit up as he pronounced the words “the most beautiful art models”.\n\nMassimilliano poured Amerigo a glass of wine. They started a conversation about the old times, recalling the days when Amerigo and Massimilliano were young and terrorizing the city’s streets.\n\nThey talked about Florence and how it had changed. They recalled the story when years ago Pierfrancesco had tasked Amerigo to find twenty courtesans on the day of a Medici festivity, and how Massimilliano had helped him with the ordeal.\n\nMassimilliano had grown up as an orphan. His mother had been a laundress and had died when he was twelve. He had never met his father, of whom some said that he was of noble origin. At a young age he had learned to take care of himself and bounced around from job to job. He scraped by and navigated the rough streets of Callavagio, one of the poorest neighborhoods of Florence. Amerigo had met Massimilliano when he was working as a lackey for the Soderini family.\n\nMassimilliano had black hair, hazel eyes and a large scar on the right side of his face. He was of average height and had broad shoulders. Amerigo had taken a liking in him and over time had asked for Massimilliano’s assistance to complete some of Pierfrancesco’s less noble requests.\n\nAs they were discussing the old days, Massimilliano began refilling Amerigo’s glass, since Amerigo had almost emptied it.\n\nAmerigo intervened and said:\n\nAmerigo: “I have to return to the office. I think one glass should be enough at noon.”\n\nMassimilliano laughed and answered:\n\nMassimilliano: “You seem to have grown soft old man. It’s Thursday.”\n\nA sudden feeling of unease gripped Amerigo. Nothing irritated and motivated Amerigo more than a challenge to his vigor or abilities. He grabbed the newly filled glass and promptly drank it. He put it down and exclaimed:\n\nAmerigo: “Go ahead, fill it up again.”\n\nMassimilliano filled up Amerigo’s glass again and replied with a laughter:\n\nMassimilliano: “That is how I remember the real Migo.”\n\nThey continued their conversation and Massimilliano started telling a story about some thieves, who had broken into a Dominican Monastery at the city’s northern gate and had stolen some relics.\n\nWhen he had finished telling the story, he became quite for a moment and then asked:\n\nMassimilliano: “Remember what Master Brunelleschi used to say?\n\nHe used to say, to be triumphant in life, a day will come when you need to go “all-in”. And if you time that day correctly you shall climb on Almighty’s chosen path. Yet if you miss it, you shall not get a second attempt. As the Lord grants each and everyone just one attempt!”\n\nHe paused for a moment and then continued:\n\nMassimilliano: “Do you think Master Brunelleschi was right?”\n\nAmerigo thought for a moment and then replied:\n\nAmerigo: “Yes, I think he was right. Brunelleschi was a wise man.\n\nBut I also like King Phillip’s line, that patience is the strategist’s best friend and those who try to force their luck, will find its back turned quickly.”\n\nMassimilliano nodded and replied:\n\nMassimilliano: “Yes, patience is key. And I am still awaiting my lucky turn.\n\nBut once that day arrives, I will go all-in! That is the only path to making it big. Even the Medici followed it.”\n\nThen Massimilliano started reciting another story, which he had overheard few days ago.\n\nChapter 2. Michelangelo’s Studio\n\nPietro Bembo had been staying in Florence for the past two months. He was often on the move, spending time in Rome, Ferrara, Urbino and often in Florence. He was from an aristocratic venetian family and was accustomed to traveling from a young age. His father had been a venetian diplomat at many courts. At just twenty one years, Pietro had already visited many of the largest cities in Europe. Even his daily habits had a sense of motion and constant dynamism. As he stood in the middle of Michelangelo’s studio, while shifting his weight from one side to the other, he asked in bewilderment:\n\nPietro: “What do you mean, you will not attend La Grande Festa tomorrow? Don’t be foolish Michelangelo. You have to come. Il Magnifico expects you to be present at the ceremony.”\n\nPietro had soft, handsome features, long dark hair and large brown eyes. His eyes showed a certain carelessness that was often mistaken for arrogance. He had known Michelangelo since his first visit to Florence five years ago.\n\nMichelangelo, without taking his attention from the statue, replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “I have work to do. I want to finish this statue. Leave me alone.”\n\nMichelangelo’s small, dark eyes, full of intensity, were focused on the statue. His short, black hair was messy and he was wearing a brown robe.\n\nMichelangelo was only sixteen but his face depicted a seriousness that sometimes moved to melancholy. He had been at the Medici Academy for about a year and Il Magnifico treated him as a son. He was working on a small statue of Apollo and one could see a dissatisfaction on his face. He dreaded the presence of others when he was working.\n\nPietro’s large, observing eyes looked around the studio and briefly gazed into the corner at a wooden fixture, which resembled a broken cross. Pietro was wearing colorful attire that slightly smelled of wine. He had just returned from the Palazzo Pitti, where he had played the lute while reciting his newest songs. While reaching his right hand towards the pocket of his green blouse, Pietro turned towards Michelangelo’s desk and continued.\n\nPietro: “You can always finish that statue later. Take a break. I have heard even the beautiful Isabella D’Este is in town from Mantua. She will be at La Grande Festa. I have written a poem for her, its called La Fiamma!”\n\nPietro took a piece of paper out of his pocket, opened it up and started reciting.\n\nPietro:\n\n”Hey sister — my little sister,\n\nHow should I address you, so you listen to my whisper?\n\nHow should I address you to fill your voice with little glister?\n\nHow can I convey the feelings of this mister?”\n\nMichelangelo turned his face. While angrily looking directly at Pietro he said:\n\nMichelangelo: “Leave me alone Pietro.”\n\nHe paused for a moment and then continued:\n\n“Besides, all these old fools at La Grande Festa. What do they understand?\n\nAll they speak of is Master Perugino this, Master Leonardo that. What has Leonardo done recently that is so great? He cannot even finish a simple horse statue in ten years.\n\nI can sculpt that statue in 6 months.”\n\nPietro’s face showed visible amusement and with a self-satisfied smirk he replied:\n\nPietro: “In Milan they say he is working on a flying carriage.”\n\nMichelangelo replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “In Milan they say… Nonsense. The old man has gone mad. Let him first learn to sculpt before he starts talking about flying carriages.”\n\nThe amusement on Pietro’s face increased as he tried to hide it and he continued:\n\nPietro: “They say he is dissecting horse cadavers and preparing their hearts as meals, to gain magical powers.”\n\nMichelangelo angrily replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “Nonsense. I am telling you, nonsense. Leonardo does not eat animal flesh. He says animals are like us. He says they are divine creatures with feelings. The old man is mad. But people hold him for this great genius.”\n\nMichelangelo turned away and returned his attention to the statue. He started carefully scraping a layer from the statue’s right eye. Then he exclaimed:\n\nMichelangelo: “And lastly my dear Pietro, I advise you to keep that poem to yourself!\n\nYou do know that Isabella D’Este just married Francesco Gonzaga, who happens to be the Captain General of the Venetian Army.\n\nSo there is Francesco Gonzaga, who commands one of the largest Armies on the Italian peninsula and then there is his wife Isabella D’Este and then there is you.\n\nWhat do you think will happen?”\n\nPietro listened to these words with an air of indifference. He was well acquainted with the dealings at the northern Italian courts. His smile became more mysterious as he replied:\n\nPietro: “Thanks for the advice little Stone-man! But soon you shall see that the pen is mightier than the sword.”\n\nPietro’s face expressed self-satisfaction and he chuckled.\n\nAt that moment Michelangelo’s chisel slipped and broke off a small piece from the statue’s nose.\n\nHe yelled: “Crap! Utterly Crap! Leave me alone Pietro. Leave me alone!”\n\nHe swung his arm and knocked down the statue to the ground. The statue broke into pieces.\n\nPietro’s face showed bewilderment, which then turned into pity. He made a gesture to try to console Michelangelo, but saw in Michelangelo’s eyes that it would be better to leave.\n\nHe quietly walked towards the door.\n\nAs Pietro walked out of the studio he said: “You need a break my friend. Come to La Grande Festa tomorrow.”\n\nMichelangelo lowered himself to the ground in resignation and yelled.\n\nMichelangelo: “Leave me alone!”\n\nMichelangelo sat on the floor for a while. Tears ran down his face as he was staring at the ground. The statue that he had worked on for hundred days was scattered around him in small pieces.\n\nHe picked up a small piece that laid next to his legs and looked at it. It had an odd shape and looked almost like a horseman. His teary face for a moment showed a smile.\n\nHe remembered the days when his father had taught him how to saddle a horse. He remembered how everything was so much simpler back then, back then before he had felt all the weight of expectations, back then before he felt the constant looks and murmurs of bystanders.\n\nHe continued staring at the broken piece, while turning the piece in his hand.\n\nEventually he got up. He left the studio and walked along the sculpture garden towards the small stable at the west side of Palazzo Medici. He entered the stable, which had eight horses lined in the row.\n\nHe walked up to Givon, the horse that Il Magnifico had given him for his sixteenth birthday. While putting his hand on the horse’s face and gently stroking it, he uttered:\n\nMichelangelo: “Givon, you are my only friend here.”\n\nGivon was a dark chestnut Calabrese with sloping shoulders and a broad, deep chest. This beautiful Calabrese had white outlines around all four of its hooves. Therefore Michelangelo sometimes referred to Givon as boots.\n\nThe horse as if acknowledging Michelangelo’s statement sounded out a short neigh.\n\nShortly after, Michelangelo walked towards and opened the gate of the stable. He greeted the guard. He took a saddle from the back of the stable and carefully fastened it around the horse’s torso.\n\nThen Michelangelo mounted the horse and started galloping towards the open gate.\n\nChapter 3. Pico’s Arrival at Palazzo Medici\n\nPiero de Medici, Il Magnifico’s eldest son, had been informed that Count Pico Della Mirandola was on his way to Palazzo Medici. While standing at the main gate and observing the clouds building up, he was eagerly awaiting his old tutor, whom he had not seen for nine months. His face was at first jovial but once he saw the carriage stop at the entrance, his face became more serious and almost showed a touch of anxiety. Seeing the Count exit the carriage he said:\n\nPiero de Medici: “Master Della Mirandola! How glad I am to see you. Father is awaiting you. We are eager to find out what news you have for us.”\n\nCount Pico Della Mirandola walked up the two stairs at the main gate of the Palazzo Medici. He embraced the young Piero de Medici with a warm smile.\n\nPico was a man of small stature yet a man of large intellect. It was said that he had once exclaimed, that he is not a philosophical poet but a poetical philosopher. His curly, long, dark hair and sharp nose gave his brown eyes a mysterious aura. He was wearing a blue hat and a red robe. As he embraced Piero de Medici he said:\n\nPico: “Piero, how you have grown my wise student. Please help me with these books.”\n\nPico Della Mirandola handed Piero some of the books and they stepped into the Palazzo.\n\nAs they walked through the palace courtyard Pico Della Mirandola murmured: “In Milan they say it’s a revolution”.\n\nThey walked up the stairway of the magnificent Palazzo. They walked through the hallway glancing over the walls covered by frescos and paintings by the great artists of the time.\n\nThey entered the main study of Lorenzo the Magnificent.\n\nIl Magnifico was sitting behind a white marble desk. The desk was covered by a glass top with golden outlines. Glass murals, which depicted several scenes from Dante’s Devine Comedy, decorated the rectangular edges of the table’s top.\n\nIl Magnifico was sitting on a large, yellow armchair made of velvet. The armchair’s back support depicted five red circles arranged in a triangle and a larger purple circle above the triangle.\n\nThe servants at the Palazzo used to referred to Il Magnifico’s study as the fairytale room.\n\nBut recently the study had acquired a more intimidating character, since Il Magnifico had moved Paolo Uccello’s large painting from his bedroom to the study.\n\nIt was one of Il Magnifico’s favorite paintings and depicted a scene from the San Romano battle, during which the Florentine had defeated the city of Sienna and its Visconti allies.\n\nThe large painting hung directly above Il Magnifico’s desk.\n\nIl Magnifico had corse facial features, a large forehead and a protruding jaw. He had long brown hair, parted in the middle, a large nose and powerful brown eyes. His broad shoulders were covered in a fine red cloak.\n\nAs he noticed Pico and Piero enter his study, he looked up and said:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Pico! Welcome back. Come in. What have you brought us? What news do you have from Venice, Rome, Milan?”\n\nPico walked in and said:\n\nPico: “Master Medici!”\n\nAfter putting some books and manuscripts on the table he continued:\n\nPico: “In Milan they say it is a revolution! Master Leonardo says we are on the verge of a revolution in arts, building, transportation and weaponry.\n\nSome claim soon he will build a horseless carriage, tunnels for underground cities, a giant ship that can sail the vast Ocean Sea and even a miraculously flying carriage.”\n\nIl Magnifico laughed aloud. As his face became serious again he continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “How is Leonardo? Has he gone mad with age?\n\nDo they still call him the great virtuoso in Milan?\n\nWe all know by now that Leonardo’s claims should be taken with a grain of salt.”\n\nPico replied:\n\nPico: “Master Leonardo is still working on the world’s biggest equestrian statue. But Regent Ludovico Il Moro is getting impatient. It has been almost ten years and he cannot complete the statue due to distractions of ever-new projects.”\n\nIl Magnifico replied:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Ah yes. That is how I remember Leonardo. I can’t believe it has been almost ten years since he left us. How time flies.\n\nDoes Leonardo still call himself a genius?\n\nEveryone knows that you cannot call yourself a genius, only others can call you a genius.”\n\nIl Magnifico paused for a moment and then continued:\n\n“What about Rome? How is my beloved son Giovanni?”\n\nPico replied:\n\nPico: “The young Cardinal is doing well. He misses you immensely. He says our friend Pope Innocent’s condition is getting worse. Some say the Pope may not have much longer to live. There are even rumors that two Cardinals have conspired and poisoned the Pope.”\n\nIl Magnifico exclaimed:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Nonsense, such rumors. The Pope will recover with God’s help. He will see our beloved grandson Innocencio bravely galloping on the little pony that his holiness has sent us.”\n\nAs his arousal calmed he continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Pico, what new findings have you brought us? Let us see.”\n\nPico reached into his leather bag and took out a rolled script. He said:\n\nPico: “From Genoa, a new map smuggled by some sailors from Constantinople. It depicts the riches of India and the spice markets of the Far East.”\n\nHe unrolled the script showing the map.\n\nPico continued:\n\nPico: “They say the Genovese seaman and mapmaker Christopher Columbus and the Royal Court of Castile are close to reaching an agreement for the financing terms of his daring expedition to the Indies. The seaman is still asking for the same terms as quoted last year.”\n\nIl Magnifico’s face became pensive and after a while he replied:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Interesting. Queen Isabella has become more daring since the end of Reconquista. We should keep an eye on these developments.”\n\nHe looked over to his son and said:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Piero, if I forget, remind me to talk to Pierfrancesco about that Columbus guy.”\n\nPico unrolled more manuscripts.\n\nPico: “And here some Greek manuscripts on Geometry by the ancient Alexandrian masters. I found them in Venice.\n\nAnd here some writings from the ancient Athenian philosophers. I was able to purchase them in Augsburg for a bargain.”\n\nIl Magnifico’s face became radian and he gayly exclaimed:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Pico, you never cease to surprise me. The Medici library already houses some of the best and rarest writings in the world. The library will become even richer and more magnificent with your help.”\n\nThen he became pensive for a moment and continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “So a revolution they say hmm. One never knows if Leonardo has gone mad or is speaking with divine visions.\n\nWhat do they say in Rome of our young artist Michelangelo? He has turned into a formidable young man and is divinely gifted. I think he can be better than Leonardo. He works like possessed. And it is just his first year at the academy. I have never seen anything like that before. You will see him tomorrow at La Grande Festa.”\n\nPico’s face showed a sign of satisfaction and he inquired:\n\nPico: “How is young Michelangelo? Yes, people in Rome are speaking of young Michelangelo Buonarotti’s talents.”\n\nAnd without waiting for an answer he continued:\n\n“And also Master Medici, in Rome they are speaking of a young child, aged ten, Raphael of Urbino. He is very talented and some call him the Leonardo of Urbino. The child is able to paint faces with the same divine beauty as young Leonardo once did. Poor Raphael’s mother has passed away. He is grief stricken.”\n\nIl Magnifico’s face became animated and he exclaimed:\n\nIl Magnifico: “We have to invite young Raphael to Florence. Florence is the new Rome. You need to tell his father that it is best for his son. In Florence the boy can learn from our great Master Botticelli and all the other great artists. Botticelli is in a flow right now. His decorations for this years La Grande Festa look amazing.\n\nYou will see them all tomorrow at La Grande Festa. It is going to be grand! You will see everyone tomorrow.\n\nYou must be tired Pico. Go get some rest. We shall talk tomorrow.”\n\nChapter 4. Michelangelo at Home\n\nThe sun was setting when Michelangelo arrived at his family home in Arrezzo.\n\nWhen he walked through the door, he noticed his brother Gismondo sitting in the corner and playing with their golden retriever, Piolo. As Gismondo saw his brother enter, he got up and approached Michelangelo exclaiming:\n\nGismondo: “Migel, what a surprise! You came home. How great it is that you are here. How is the academy?”\n\nPiolo also ran towards Michelangelo. While wagging his tail, Piolo jumped up and put his paws on Michelangelo. Piolo’s excited body was twitching uncontrollably. Michelangelo began rubbing the dogs ears after which Piolo calmed down.\n\nMichelangelo paused for a moment and then replied.\n\nMichelangelo: “Things are going great. We are learning a lot.”\n\nGismondo nodded and continued with excitement:\n\nGismondo: “I took Piolo to the lake today, up Precci hill. The little beast had a great time in the water and tried chasing the geese. Remember the geese last summer when we were…”\n\nGismondo’s animated expression was getting ready to tell a story, but at that moment Michelangelo’s father, Ludovico, entered the room.\n\nSeeing Michelangelo he nodded and quickly asked:\n\nLudovico: “What are you doing here? Isn’t tomorrow the Medici Festa? Should you not be preparing for it?”\n\nMichelangelo’s face showed initial terror and some tension, but he raised his head in defiance and replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “Yes it is tomorrow, but I don’t think I will be going.”\n\nLudovico’s face became puzzled and he angrily exclaimed:\n\nLudovico: “You don’t think you will be going? Do you know how much your brothers and I have sacrificed so you can attend that damn academy? You are thinking not to go? You are thinking? There is nothing to think about. It is not your choice. It is the family’s choice and it has been made.”\n\nMichelangelo’s eyes lit up in an intense sparkle and he replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “But father! There is no value to that Festa anyways. It will be as it was last year. The same dances, the same speeches, the same smiles. The same people hiding behind masks made by the same Master Botticelli. Maybe the masks will be different this year. But what is the point?”\n\nLudovico answered angrily:\n\nLudovico: “What is the point? I don’t want to hear that nonsense in this house. You will go to La Grande Festa. We are not discussing this. And just as I told you, you should prepare a small statue and surprise Il Magnifico.”\n\nMichelangelo’s face became tense and he exclaimed:\n\nMichelangelo: “Il Magnifico does not need any surprises and he has enough statues already. I am an artist, I don’t make damn souvenirs! I make art! I make great art!”\n\nLudovico replied:\n\nLudovico: “I haven’t seen you making much art lately! So let me make it clear one more time, the Festa is not up for discussion. You are going.”\n\nMichelangelo turned and walked away. While walking away he shouted:\n\nMichelangelo: “ I am tired of being an attraction!”\n\nThat night Michelangelo was laying in bed unable to sleep. He was staring at the cracks in the sealing. His mind was racing with thoughts.\n\nHis eyes were teary and he kept repeating to himself: “Why me? Why me? Why did it have to be me Holy Father?”\n\nAnd he eventually fell asleep.\n\nChapter 5. Machiavelli’s Chamber\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli opened his eyes. After looking around for a moment he exclaimed:\n\nNiccolo: “What time is it? I need to go pick up the new robe for tonight.”\n\nHe was still getting accustomed to his new chamber, where he had been living for about two weeks. It wasn’t much to look at. It was small, with old furniture. During the winter months it carried a slight smell of humidity.\n\nBut it was his own place. For the first time he was independent, away from his overbearing father, and he could do anything he wanted.\n\nThe girl next to him, Anna, opened her eyes in confusion and said in a sleepy voice.\n\nAnna: “What is tonight? What are you getting ready for?”\n\nNiccolo while wiping his face with his right hand and stroking his curly, short, brown hair, replied with excitement:\n\nNiccolo: “I want to go to La Grande Festa at the Palazzo.”\n\nAnna’s face became puzzled. She turned her gaze to Niccolo and her blue eyes reflected a mix of compassion and bewilderment. She replied:\n\nAnna: “At the Palazzo? You? How? You are not invited. The guards will not let you in.”\n\nNiccolo exclaimed:\n\nNiccolo: “I will find a way to get in. You will see!”\n\nAnna replied in a soft voice:\n\nAnna: “Niccolo, you are a dreamer. People in those circles don’t mix with us common folk. The show is only for the Popolo Grasso.”\n\nNiccolo exclaimed:\n\nNiccolo: “You will see!”\n\nHe jumped out of bed, put on his clothes, gave Anna a brief kiss and walked out of the chamber.\n\nChapter 6. Palazzo Medici — La Grande Festa\n\nLa Grande Festa was an annual festival that Il Magnifico hosted every January. Its purpose was to honor and recognize the pursuit of arts, the arts community, the City of Florence, the Medici, and Il Magnifico himself.\n\nAristocrats from all corners of the Italian Peninsula gathered at the Palazzo Medici to see and be seen at La Grande Festa, and to meet the most promising artists of the next generation.\n\nBotticelli was the lead decorator and coordinator of the event. Il Magnifico provided Botticelli unlimited resources to impress the numerous guests with his creations.\n\nEach year Botticelli attempted to surpass himself by creating magnificent displays, clever illusions and breathtaking shows that would bedazzle everyone. During the Festa’s final preparation week the citizens of Florence gossiped and circulated rumors about the upcoming La Grande Festa and the marvels to be expected.\n\nNaturally, Botticelli was one of the first to arrive, so he could inspect the displays in the main and side courtyards and the sculpture garden. He also checked on the many indoor decorations to make sure every detail was as intended. The theme for this year’s La Grande Festa was fire. It was motivated by Dante’s Inferno. Yet Botticelli had not shared the source of his inspiration. Eight intricate fire displays were disbursed at different locations around the Palazzo.\n\nRight in front of the entry gate to the Palazzo garden stood a large structure resembling a windmill with its spinning wings holding flames.\n\nSeveral fire-artists performed marvelous feats in the garden. Some artists were spinning poles with flames on them and some blew flames out of their mouths.\n\nThere were also many sculptures illuminated by flames of different and unusual colors. The entire spectacle was in a colorful glow.\n\nYet the dominant color of this year’s Festa was red.\n\nGuests were slowly trickling in, with some of the most notable guests still absent. At the front gate each guest received a red mask, which differed by gender. The ladies’ mask had the shape of a red butterfly with yellow dots. The gentlemen’s mask had the shape of a red woodpecker’s head with a long beak.\n\nThe guest usually carried their masks and occasionally covered their faces with them.\n\nBotticelli strolled around the Festa making his rounds and checking on the different displays. On his stroll many stopped to congratulate him on his creations. He usually nodded and continued his stroll.\n\nWhen he was walking along the Palazzo’s main courtyard he saw Pietro Bembo approaching him.\n\nPietro walked up to him and exclaimed: “Master Botticelli the decorations are exquisite. There is a spirituality to it that I would like to capture in a poem”.\n\nBotticelli nodded and replied: “Thank you”.\n\nHe was about to continue his stroll.\n\nYet at that moment he saw two young ladies walking towards him. Their faces were covered with red butterfly masks. One of the ladies had dark hair and was wearing a light blue satin dress. The other had blond hair and was wearing a red dress with puffy sleeves and golden strings along the front. Botticelli tried to visualize their faces behind the masks. Who they might be? He thought.\n\nHis expression lightened up, while anticipating the expected praise on the decor.\n\nAs the ladies approached, the brunet exclaimed with excitement: “Pietro Bembo, when will we hear your newest song. It was said that you have recently played it at Palazzo Pitti”.\n\nPietro turned towards the ladies and replied: “There will be other opportunities to hear. Yet one never knows when. Maybe soon”.\n\nThe blond lady stepped forward. While placing her hand on Pietro’s arm she asked: “Can you play it tonight?”\n\nPietro looked at her face covered by the red mask. The mask was accentuated by her red dress. The golden strings that ran across the front of the dress for a moment captured Pietro’s attention. Together with the curvature of her body, they reminded him of a musical instrument.\n\nHe then raised his gaze towards the red mask, which was partially covered by her golden hair, and replied:\n\nPietro: “It is better when it is a surprise”.\n\nThe conversation was apparently irritating Botticelli. He was unaccustomed to not being the center of attention, especially in female company. He hadn’t fully paid attention to the conversation topic, yet he interrupted and said:\n\nBotticelli: “That is great! Well, if you excuse me ladies, I have some more important things to take care of. So I better go”.\n\nAs he was starting to walk away from the group the brunette said with a smile: “Master Botticelli, the decorations are exquisite”.\n\nBotticelli nodded his head and continued walking.\n\nPietro was also getting ready to walk away, but the blond lady came closer to him and asked:\n\n“Pietro, where do you usually get the inspirations for your songs?”\n\nAs the blonde lady came closer, Pietro could feel the touch of her full breast against his arm. Yet before he could respond to the question a commotion gripped the courtyard and was followed by an odd silence.\n\nAll eyes in the courtyard turned towards the main gate.\n\nThe sisters Beatrice and Isabella D’Este had just entered the main courtyard. Behind them followed their eldest brother Alfonso D’Este.\n\nBeatrice, Isabella and Alfonso were the children of Duke Ercole D’Este, the Duke of Ferrara. Some called Ercole D’Este the biggest arts patron in Northern Italy. The D’Este were one of the most respected and oldest families in Europe. The D’Este court was often visited by many accomplished artists from all over Europe and even the King of France often stopped in Ferrara during his visits to Milan. The D’Este sisters had grown up in frequent contact with many accomplished artists who passed through Ferrara.\n\nBeatrice D’Este was reputed as one of the most beautiful and accomplished Italian princesses. She had dark brown hair and green eyes. Beatrice was only sixteen and had recently married the Regent of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, aka Il Moro. The Court of Milan was one of the most vibrant courts of the Italian Peninsula and employed among other artists Master Leonardo Da Vinci and Master Donato Bramante.\n\nAfter arriving in Milan, Beatrice had become one of Leonardo Da Vinci’s closest friends. Leonardo and her shared many common interests in arts, specifically in theater. Her taste was evident in the decorative splendor of Castelo Sforzesco, the Sforza Family’s main residence in Milan. She was also known for her inventive, new clothing styles.\n\nHer sister Isabella D’Este, just a year older than Beatrice, was called “Donna Eccezionale”, the exceptional woman. Isabella had dyed, pale-blond hair and brown eyes that were full of fire. Her beautiful face was often lit up by her scattered smile.\n\nFrom a young age Isabella had studied roman history, latin and greek and was in frequent contact with many scholars and humanists. She was friends with many musicians, poets, writers and was herself a talented musician and singer. She was also an innovator in new dances, as she had been instructed by the well known dancing master Ambrogio.\n\nIsabella painted rarely but claimed that she painted mainly through her fashion and innovative clothes, which she always designed herself.\n\nThe blue and golden dress that Isabella wore to the Festa sparkled from all the colorful fire displays illuminating the courtyard.\n\nAs the sisters entered the courtyard, a crowd gathered around them. Master Perugino, also known as the elder from Perugia, for his forty-six years of wisdom, was one of the first to approach the sisters. While cordially greeting the siblings Perugino exclaimed with a glow.\n\nPerugino: “My ladies you both look so splendid tonight! How you have both grown up and matured.”\n\nBeatrice curtsied and replied:\n\nBeatrice: “Dear Maestro, how lively you look! With time you are only becoming more vigorous and jovial.”\n\nIsabella also approached the elderly master and continued:\n\nIsabella: “Master Perugino, it seems as if it was yesterday when you painted us playing in Papa’s sculpture garden.”\n\nPerugino became pensive for a moment.\n\nBeatrice trying to change the topic continued:\n\nBeatrice: “Maestro, in Milan everyone is talking about the Albani Altarpiece, that you have recently completed.\n\nWhat excellent work. It is such a playful experimentation with perspective. Not to mention the great balance between symmetry and asymmetry.\n\nAnd the devotion in the faces is so powerful.\n\nThe composition reminds me of your Delivery of Keys fresco at the Sistine Chapel.\n\nAlso Master Leonardo praised it for its simplicity”.\n\nA smile appeared on Perugino’s face. Perugino replied with a mix of awe and sarcasm:\n\nPerugino: “Ah Master Leonardo! What a character! I still remember our apprenticeship days at Master Verrocchio’s studio. He used to drive the old Verrocchio mad.\n\nIf only Master Leonardo could finish some paintings. I think he has so much potential, but so little discipline.\n\nIs he attending the Fiesta tonight?”\n\nBeatrice looked at Perugino and replied with a smile:\n\nBeatrice: “Well, that I don’t know my dear Maestro. Sometimes Master Leonardo disappears and one does not see him for days or sometimes weeks. It is when he gets into his experiments. You know? And then he reappears again, out of nowhere.\n\nIt has been about three weeks since we have seen him last. But he always surprises us with his sudden appearances.”\n\nThe crowd that had gathered around the D’Este sisters had gradually grown. In the crowd were many young painters, who wanted to capture the attention of a potential, wealthy patron.\n\nPietro Bembo had been watching the spectacle from afar. He had been observing Isabella, while she was talking to the numerous young artists approaching her. While looking at Isabella, he thought that for a moment her eyes had met his gaze and a brief expression of familiarity had become visible on her face.\n\nBotticelli was returning from the garden when he noticed a crowd gathered around the D’Este sisters at the entrance to the main courtyard. To avoid the crowd he turned into the corridor leading to the side courtyard. While he was walking through the corridor he noticed Amerigo Vespucci walking directly towards him. Amerigo appeared to be distracted in his thoughts.\n\nWhen Amerigo was just couple of feet in front of Botticelli, he suddenly noticed Botticelli and with a quick gesture of his arm exclaimed:\n\nAmerigo: “Master Botticelli, what a delight to encounter you. The decorations are breathtaking. It would be a shame if someone of your creative potential did not express your true emotions through art.”\n\nBotticelli nodded. A smile appeared on his face and he replied:\n\n“Thank you, my dear Amerigo. What did Father Giorgio say about the portrait? Was it to his liking?”\n\nAmerigo quickly replied:\n\n“Yes, uncle was mesmerized. He said that the likeness is exceptional, and the beauty is breathtaking.”\n\nBotticelli’s face became vibrant and he replied:\n\nBotticelli: “Very glad to hear that. Father Giorgio is such a wise and exceptional canon. Hopefully next week I will find some time to visit Santa Maria Del Fiore and maybe converse with him.”\n\nBotticelli suddenly noticed a tension on Amerigo’s face.\n\nAmerigo then became animated and using sudden hand gestures replied:\n\nAmerigo: “He surely will be excited to see you. Master Botticelli, if you excuse me, I need to seek out Pierfrancesco to discuss some administrative matters.”\n\nSaying this Amerigo continued walking towards the main courtyard, while becoming engulfed in deep thoughts.\n\nAmerigo had been distracted all day, unable to really engage in any conversations at La Grande Festa.\n\nThe day after he had left Botticelli’s studio, Amerigo had woken up with a headache and unable to recall what had occurred the night before. He could only recall happily singing some songs, together with two ladies, at Massimilliano’s Inn.\n\nWorst of all, he could not find the portrait that Botticelli had painted of his uncle Giorgio.\n\nThe next day Amerigo had returned to Massimilliano’s Inn to look for the portrait, but to no avail. He wasn’t sure what to do or what to say to his uncle.\n\nNow his unrealistic plan was to find a young, talented painter, who would paint a new portrait, which he could present to his uncle as Botticelli’s work. Among other challenges it required that the portrait be painted from memory.\n\nHe was walking around La Grande Festa, while thinking through his plan and hoping to find a young, talented painter as a potential accomplice.\n\nRunning into Botticelli at the Festa only confirmed to Amerigo the difficulty of his new plan. Amerigo had tried to maintain an outward calm. He was not sure if Botticelli had noticed anything. But he hoped that Botticelli had continued his walk without any suspicion.\n\nBotticelli had been surprised by the sudden anxiety that he had noticed in Amerigo’s eyes, but he continued walking without thinking too much about it. When Botticelli arrived in the side courtyard, he saw Count Pico Della Mirandola walking out of the right stairway. Pico also noticed Botticelli and signaled to him with a friendly hand gesture. Botticelli started approaching Pico and his face lit up.\n\nWhile the guests were still arriving at Palazzo Medici, Il Magnifico was in his study discussing some of the newest business and political affairs with his cousin Pierfrancesco and his eldest son Piero De Medici.\n\nPierfrancesco was a handsome man, with a round face and dark brown, curly hair. His brown-greenish eyes gave him an overly innocent look. He was an intelligent man, an astute observer of situations and an exceptional investor.\n\nPierfrancesco was also knowledgable about the latest humanist ideas and had grown up under the academic tutelage of Angelo Poliziano and Father Giorgio Vespucci, Amerigo’s uncle.\n\nPierfrancesco often commissioned large artworks, among them was The Primavera, which Botticelli had painted to commemorate the wedding between Pierfrancesco and the beautiful Semirande Appiano of Piombo.\n\nIl Magnifico had arranged his cousin Pierfrancesco’s marriage to Semirande Appiano. The Appiani, were a noble Italian family, which was related by marriage to the Aragonese royal family of Naples.\n\nThe wedding, which ten years ago had marked Pierfrancesco’s entrance into adulthood, catapulted his professional career. Just a year after his wedding, at only eighteen years of age, he was present at the coronation of King Charles the VII of France, where Pierfrancesco was sent as a Florentine ambassador.\n\nUsing his newly acquired commercial ties garnered through the marriage, Pierfancesco had amassed significant wealth by trading and investing into the spice trade. At the age of twenty eight he was already one of the richest men in Florence.\n\nPierfrancesco was pacing around Il Magnifico’s study, while listening to Piero De Medici’s long statement. He suddenly stopped and interceded:\n\nPierfrancesco: “I don’t think we should hastily decide on the loan or wether to throw our lot with the French or the Spanish. We should rather take our time and observe how the situation is developing.\n\nIndeed the French King is very powerful and the rumors of the new French cannons are said to be true. Yet His Majesty is also unpredictable and easily manipulated.\n\nThe most catholic monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand on the other hand are in a resurgence. The victory over the Emirate of Granada and the final expulsion of the Moors from the continent are just the beginning. The Spanish are starting to cultivate the Canary Islands and can easily expand into North Africa.”\n\nPierfrancesco’s statement was followed by a moment of silence.\n\nThen Il Magnifico replied:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Why don’t we send someone to Seville to observe the developments in Andalusia and to gauge the new trade route towards Africa. That way we can also get updates about that Genovese seaman Columbus and his proposed voyage to the Indies.”\n\nIl Magnifico paused for a moment and then continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “And at the same time we should send a delegation to France to discuss a collaboration with the French King by also involving our friend Il Moro.”\n\nPierfrancesco nodded and replied:\n\nPierfrancesco: “I think Amerigo would be the ideal candidate as our Spanish market observer. He is loyal, crafty, and has great judgement. And he has been to Seville before.”\n\nIl Magnifico’s face showed some dissatisfaction, which then turned into indifference. He eventually replied:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Fine, I will leave these details to you. Piero will assist you with the organization of the French delegation.\n\nNow I need some time to rehearse my speech.”\n\nHearing this Piero and Pierfrancesco nodded and started walking towards the door.\n\nOutside of Palazzo Medici, Niccolo Machiavelli had been waiting and observing the crowd for the past thirty minutes. He was standing in front of the Basilica San Lorenzo observing the guests slowly trickling in. He wore a brand-new, red robe with purple outlines and a new, fashionable cavalier’s hat. His hair was well groomed and he wore a ruby crest around his neck. Niccolo had been closely observing the guards at both entry gates, while trying to devise the best way to enter.\n\nWhen he was looking at the crowd gathered by the gate leading to the garden, Niccolo suddenly noticed a brown-robed horseman stopping in front of the small gate of the stable. The horseman dismounted and cordially greeted the guards at the stable. He handed the horse to one of the guards and walked into the stable.\n\nThe horseman was Michelangelo, who walked through the stable towards the small door leading to the garden. He entered the garden. The garden was illuminated by the flames of three fire-dancers, who were collectively spinning their fire-poles in a choreographed performance.\n\nHe walked towards the fire-dancers. While Michelangelo was walking he overheard someone say: “That is the guy that I was telling you about.”\n\nMichelangelo stopped behind a crowd that had gathered in front of the fire-dancers. He heard some more murmurs. Then he could make out the words: “He is always late. He probably thinks he is too important to be on time.”\n\nThe three fire-dancers had captured Michelangelo’s attention. He was observing the three flames moving.\n\nInitially the three dancers were aligned in the row, so one could only see a single body and three poles spinning in the same circle. Then two of the three fire-dancers started walking in opposite directions and the three flames started moving away from each other.\n\nWhile the guests were enjoying the fire spectacle, two servants entered the garden and asked everyone to slowly begin moving towards the grand ballroom on the second floor.\n\nBotticelli and Pico were already walking up the stairway leading up from the side courtyard of the Palazzo. Botticelli’s face expression was serious and he was speaking at an increased rate:\n\nBotticelli: “My dear Pico, but you don’t understand.\n\nMy entire body is aching, burning and itching. My joints are in pain. And my feet, my feet feel as if they are burning in coal.\n\nI don’t understand what is happening.\n\nThe pain is non-stop. It is unbearable.\n\nI think God is punishing me for my sins.\n\nI can’t really sleep. And I am having all these nightmares when I do fall asleep. I have tried to drink less wine, but it just gets worse.\n\nAll these nightmares. I am unable to sleep.\n\nI don’t know what to do!\n\nMy entire body is burning non-stop.\n\nSome nights St. Peter appears and tells me that I have sinned. He hands me a blue lily and tells me that I have praised the pagan gods and the pagan ways, and have abandoned our true Lord.”\n\nAs he spoke, Botticelli’s eyes were full of terror and he continued in despair:\n\n“St. Peter appears and tells me, that the judgment day is coming and that I will burn in hell.”\n\nPico tried to reassure Botticelli and answered:\n\nPico: “Nonsense my dear Botticelli. Doesn’t Father Savanarolla say, that the Lord is forgiving?\n\nYou just have to find the path back. Use your art to praise our Lord and you will be worthy of his endless love.”\n\nBotticelli continued:\n\nBotticelli: “But I have betrayed our Lord.\n\nI have let myself to be misled. Oh, stupid me!\n\nAnd that’s not all.\n\nI have violated the sanctity of the female body. Everyone in Florence, when speaking of Master Botticelli, thinks of all the nudes that are decorating the decadent walls of the Florentine Palazzos. I do not deserve God’s love.\n\nAnd then there is that wicked fresco at Palazzo Del Bargello.\n\nI am going to burn in hell! Do you understand what that means?”\n\nBotticelli’s face showed a mix of terror and hopelessness.\n\nPico put his arm on Botticelli’s shoulder and replied:\n\nPico: “I am telling you, it is never too late. You just have to find the right path. Continue talking to Father Savanarolla and he will guide you towards it.”\n\nThe guest were slowly entering the grand ballroom of the Palazzo.\n\nWhen Michelangelo entered the grand ballroom, he noticed several gazes turning towards him. He felt his heartbeat increase and his knees were beginning to shake a bit. He stood alone in a corner of the grand ballroom while observing the crowd.\n\nThe large rectangular ballroom was filled with Italian aristocrats and scores of young and older artists. In the far side of the ballroom a small stage was set up. There was no one on the stage and also the vicinity of the stage was mostly empty. Michelangelo could only recognize Pierfrancesco and Piero de Medici standing next to the stage and talking to a gray-haired, elderly man, who was wearing a black robe.\n\nMichelangelo stood there alone in the corner of the ballroom looking around. He recognized several of his Medici Academy classmates standing in a group along the right wall. Torrigiano, a nineteen year old sculptor from the senior class, was telling a story while gesticulating with his hands.\n\nAfter a while Pietro Bembo approached Michelangelo. While putting his arm on Michelangelo’s shoulder Pietro said: “I am glad you came!”\n\nA smile appeared on Michelangelo’s face.\n\nShortly after, a loud sound was heard. A prolonged drum beat shook the ballroom and all the attention moved towards the small stage.\n\nIl Magnifico was walking up on stage. He was wearing a plush, red robe with white fur attachments, as well as, ankle-high, dark-green trousers with black stripes.\n\nThe crowd became momentarily silent.\n\nIl Magnifico stood on stage for a moment as the suspense in the room increased. He then raised his right arm and exclaimed:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Dear citizens of Florence and dearest Italian neighbors!”\n\nHe paused for a moment and then continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Sixty years ago my grand-father Cosimo De Medici had a vision.\n\nHe had a vision of a prosperous Florence, where imagination and creativity would become the nourishments of the human spirit.\n\nHe had a vision of a prosperous Florence, where hard work and dedication would open a path for every citizen to reach one’s dreams.\n\nAnd above all he had a vision of a prosperous Italian homeland, as he often said that shared prosperity is squared prosperity.”\n\nThe crowd began cheering.\n\nIl Magnifico continued:\n\n“Sixty years ago my grand-father Cosimo made a pledge to support Florence in its pursuit of arts and higher knowledge. He envisioned that Florence would become the Italian compass and a guiding pole towards a more enlightened society.”\n\nHe paused for a moment and then continued:\n\n“Twenty eight years ago, on my grand-fathers deathbed, I promised to him that I will continue his pledge until his vision becomes reality.”\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers!\n\nIl Magnifico waited till the crowd had quieted down and continued:\n\n“We are here tonight to recognize and honor the artists, who help us see the world in new and older ways.\n\nWe are here to honor the artists, who envision a different world with their words and the artists, who create a different world with their hands.\n\nWe are here to continue the legacy of the artists and builders, who have given our beloved Florence the majestic Cathedral of Santa Maria Del Fiore.”\n\nThe crowd became jubilant!\n\nWhile standing next to Michelangelo, Pietro Bembo had been watching Isabella D’Este, who stood only few steps away along the wall. As the crowd was in cheers, Pietro slowly stepped forward towards her, and while standing behind her whispered into her shoulder:\n\nPietro: “My dearest Isabella, I have written something for you, I want you to have it.”\n\nIsabella recognized Pietro’s voice. Her heartbeat increased. She started breathing heavily. She felt a tingling sensation in her fingers and along her neck.\n\nYet trying to maintain an outward calm she replied:\n\nIsabella: “Not now Pietro! Maybe later!”\n\nShe returned her attention to the stage.\n\nAfter a brief pause Il Magnifico continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “We are here to recognize those who will follow the footsteps of the giants Giotto, Brunelleschi and Donatello.”\n\nThe crowd broke out in cheers again!\n\nIl Magnifico continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “Each year we honor outstanding artists with awards that represent steady longevity, faithful dedication, divine inspiration and youthful vigor. And today we will continue that tradition by honoring two exceptional artists.\n\nHe paused again. Then slightly raising his voice Il Magnifico continued:\n\n“This year’s “Golden Lily Lifetime Award” will honor a man, whose lifetime contributions to Florentine art and whose general impact on the beauty of our beloved city, are an inspiration to the younger generations.\n\nThe recipient of this years Golden Lily Lifetime Award is…”\n\nIl Magnifico paused for a moment to increase the suspense, although many in the crowd already knew who the recipient would be. He then exclaimed:\n\nIl Magnifico: Sandro Botticelli!\n\nApplause was heard from all around the ballroom. Shouts of “Bravo!” and “Viva Maestro” were heard as well.\n\nBotticelli walked up to the stage. As Il Magnifico handed him the Golden Lily, slight tears were visible in Botticelli’s eyes. His shaky hands held the Lily and he looked towards the crowd, that was still in collective cheers. After a while his green eyes became fixated on the two fire displays illuminating the ballroom door, and a sense of terror gripped his eyes.\n\nWhen the crowd quieted down Il Magnifico continued:\n\nIl Magnifico: “And that’s not all. We have another award.\n\nThis year’s “Young Trailblazer Medallion” will recognize a young man, whose endless dedication, hard work and artistic brilliance show just a glimpse of his true potential. The most promising young artist of this year is…”\n\nIl Magnifico paused again to increase the suspense, although all knew of Il Magnifico’s favorite. After a moment he exclaimed:\n\nIl Magnifico: Michelangelo Buonarroti\n\nMichelangelo for a moment became disoriented and his vision froze. His mouth dried up and he started breathing heavily.\n\nHe was certainly flattered by the award and happy about it. Yet at the same time he knew that the award would only increase the jealousy of his classmates and alienate him even more.\n\nWhen he gathered some composure, he started walking towards the stage. He could feel every single gaze burning into his body. He got up on stage and Il Magnifico handed him a large, bronze medallion, which had the profile of Cosimo de Medici engraved on it.\n\nMichelangelo held the medallion and stood there still not fully aware of what was happening. His heart was beating profusely.\n\nAlthough the crowd was cheering, Michelangelo was unable to hear what was happening around him.\n\nAfter a moment Il Magnifico continued:\n\n“We have many exceptional, promising, young artists in Florence. It was a difficult decision this year.\n\nWith all the potential I witness here, the future of Florentine art is brighter than ever.\n\nWith all the vigor I can feel here tonight, the future of our great Florentine Democracy is brighter than ever.\n\nAnd most importantly with all of you friends visiting us from afar, our alliance with our Italian brothers is stronger than ever!”\n\nThe crowd broke out in cheers again.\n\nShouts of “Il Magnifico” were heard throughout the Palazzo and were followed by more cheers and laughter.\n\nJust outside of the Palazzo, Niccolo Machiavelli was walking down a dark alleyway. His new robe was dirty and partially torn. His attempt to enter La Grande Festa, by breaking into the stable, had been unsuccessful.\n\nOne of the guards had noticed him, when Niccolo was already in the stable. The guards had captured him and had thrown him out. He was walking with his head lowered. He was wandering in the general direction of his new chamber but was inattentive to the path.\n\nAll of a sudden something monstrous appeared on his left and was moving towards him. There was a loud noise. He momentarily stopped and jumped back. Something passed him by and dislodged the cavalier’s hat from his head. Niccolo became disoriented. Once he was in senses again, he recognized a horseman wearing a black robe with an embroidered blue cross, riding past him on a large-brown horse.\n\nNiccolo raised his arm and yelled: “You damn Aristocrats! You think you can do anything you want? Vafanculo!”\n\nThe horseman disappeared into the darkness of the night, leaving a trail of dust. The man was riding towards the Monastery of San Marco. He wore a dark hood, which covered most of his face.\n\nAs the rider came closer to the Monastery, he pulled the strings to slow down his horse. In front of the Monastery’s chapel he dismounted and tied the horse. He walked into the chapel. He took some steps, entered one of the rows and stood there.\n\nAt the front of the chapel, at the pulpit, stood a meager, short friar with both of his arms raised. His eyes showed a mysterious intensity and his voice rang throughout the chapel. He yelled:\n\nFriar: “Gabriel appeared to me last night and brought a message from our Lord.\n\nArch-angel Gabriel spoke to me and told me that our Lord’s wrath is coming. The final judgement day is coming.”\n\nThe Friar paused for a moment and then continued:\n\nFriar: “He told me,\n\nAll the greedy tyrants, who suppress our freedom and take our livelihoods will soon see their justice served.\n\nAll the decadent pigs, who have enriched themselves by corrupting the Holy Sea of St. Peter will soon see their justice served.\n\nThe sword of justice will come down from the North and sweep away the shackles of bondage and tyranny! And the true children of God will be free again!”\n\nThe crowd broke out in cheers!\n\nShouts of “death to the tyrants” was audible.\n\nSeveral blocks away at Palazzo Medici the guests were slowly leaving. Some of the youthful and energetic were still celebrating upstairs. Music could be heard from the grand ballroom.\n\nDownstairs, in a corner of the garden stood Isabella D’Este. She was tired. After having talked to scores of artists and young aristocrats all night, she needed some time to herself.\n\nShe stood there observing the three large candles mounted on an oversized, silver candleholder that was specifically commissioned for La Grande Festa. The candleholder had numerous fine engravings depicting scenes from Dante’s Inferno.\n\nOne of the candles was red, one green and one blue. The three candles together illuminated the vicinity by creating a colorful play of lights and shadows under the darkness of the sky.\n\nIsabella was standing there in thoughts when she noticed Pietro Bembo approaching her.\n\nPietro walked up to her and said:\n\nPietro: “Isabella! There you are. I have been looking for you. I have written a poem for you. I want you to read it.”\n\nPietro took out a piece of paper from his pocket and held it out.\n\nIsabella looked at Pietro. She looked at the paper and after a moment replied:\n\nIsabella: “After all that has happened between us, you want me to read your poem? Was it not enough all that I went through?\n\nPietro’s face became pleading and he continued:\n\nPietro: “Please Isabella, there was so much I couldn’t tell you back then. Just please read the poem. It will explain everything.”\n\nIsabella took the poem. She held it in her hand and began inspecting it. The paper was folded in half. One side had a drawing of a passionflower-vine shaped like the letter I.\n\nShe turned the paper around. After a moment she moved it towards the red candle at her left and held the paper into the flame. The paper slowly began burning.\n\nShe then turned to Pietro and said with a cynical voice:\n\nIsabella: “I would rather read the accounting books of my father, than a single one of your poems.”\n\nA shade of sadness took over Pietro’s face. He realized that his eyes were becoming teary. He tried his hardest to suppress his tears by biting his jaw together. He took a deep breath and after a moment replied with a quiet voice:\n\nPietro: Understandable.\n\nPietro turned around and with his head lowered started walking towards the main courtyard. Tears started running down his face.\n\nBefore entering the main courtyard he stopped and wiped his face with his sleeve.\n\nWhen he entered the main courtyard, he noticed someone approaching through the corridor leading from the side courtyard. It was a blond girl. As she came closer, he recognized her red dress with golden strings around the front.\n\nHe looked up and exclaimed:\n\nPietro: “My lady what a pleasure to encounter you here.”\n\nThe girl seemed initially disoriented but then replied with joyful and slightly slurred words: “Ohhhh, Pietro, what a pleasant surprise. You here.”\n\nShe took some shaky steps towards him.\n\nPietro looked at her and said:\n\nPietro: “I think tonight could be a great night to write a new song. Would you like to help me?”\n\nHe held out his hand to her.\n\nShe replied: Well, maybe I can try.\n\nShe grabbed his hand and they started walking towards the main gate of the Palazzo.\n\nChapter 7. At Villa Di Castello\n\nThe past few days, Pierfrancesco had been staying at his hillside residence Villa Di Castello. He wanted to take a break from his stressful obligations of overseeing the Medici Bank, one of Europe’s largest banks.\n\nDuring La Grande Festa, Pierfrancesco had asked Amerigo to stop by at his hillside Villa on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAmerigo had arrived at Villa Di Castello and was sitting and waiting in a spacious, lounge area, to which a servant had guided him. The area opened to a marvelous view of the historic city, Sesto Fiorentino.\n\nThe Villa had a reputation of its own and its decorative splendor exceeded every visitor’s expectations. In the illusion hallway, as Pierfrancesco used to call it, hung many exceptional paintings. Among them was Botticelli’s portrait of the beautiful and renowned art model Simonetta Vespucci.\n\nSimonetta Vespucci was once considered a beauty icon in Italy. Before her premature death at the age of twenty-two in 1476, it was said that she was one of the most beautiful ladies Italy had ever seen.\n\nShe had been married to Amerigo’s distant cousin Marco Vespucci and was also aunt to Pierfrancesco’s wife Semirande.\n\nThere were also rumors that for many years the late Simonetta and the now assassinated Giuliano de Medici had been leading an affair. Although few ever spoken of that affair, it was said that the Lord had given Simonetta her beauty to tempt the unfortunate souls.\n\nBotticelli had been among the many Florentines who were devastated by Simonetta’s premature death sixteen years ago.\n\nIt was said that Botticelli had proclaimed Simonetta the best art-model of all times. They also said that it was Simonetta’s likeness that Botticelli had tried to capture in his masterpiece The Birth of Venus.\n\nThe illusion hallway at Villa di Castello lavishly displayed Pierfrancesco’s most favorite two artworks.\n\nThese two paintings, Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus and The Primavera were the pride of Pierfrancesco’s collection.\n\nWhen Amerigo had entered the Villa, unlike in the past, he had felt an odd feeling walking by these two, large paintings hanging almost opposite each other.\n\nHe was not sure why Pierfrancesco wanted to see him and was feeling slightly anxious.\n\nWhen Pierfrancesco entered the room, he greeted Amerigo and promptly sat down on a large, red sofa in the middle of the room. He looked at Amerigo and said:\n\nPierfrancesco: “Lucky you! Finally you are getting that assignment abroad you wanted.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not Barcelona, which you were hoping for, but you won’t be too far. You are going back to Seville, but this time for about a year!”\n\nAmerigo became somewhat puzzled and asked: “Seville? For a year? Is this related to Berardi again?”\n\nPierfrancesco continued:\n\nPierfrancesco: “Yes Seville, but not because of Berardi!\n\nI have an important assignment for you.\n\nRemember the old Master Paolo Toscanelli, the mathematician, who passed away about ten years ago?”\n\nAmerigo replied: “Of course! God bless his soul. Such a wise man! I remember that Master Toscanelli used to visit uncle Giorgio and they used to talk about astronomy.”\n\nPierfrencesco continued:\n\nPierfrancesco: “Ok. Well, about twenty years ago, Master Toscanelli made some calculations on the size of the earth. And using some astronomy and some geometry he drew a map of the Ocean Sea. According to his map, if one sails westward into the Ocean Sea, one would reach the Indies and the Far East Islands in less than two months.\n\nI know this sounds outlandish, but just bare with me.\n\nThere is a Genovese seaman, Christopher Columbus, who had been in correspondence with the late Master Toscanelli.\n\nColumbus had lived in Lisbon for many years. For many years he had tried to convince the King of Portugal to finance an expedition along the route mapped by Toscanelli.\n\nColumbus had pitched an expedition towards the Island Sipango, the one that Marco Polo wrote about in his book.\n\nBut remember when four years ago the Portuguese Admiral Bartholomeu Dias sailed around the southern-most tip of Africa and established Cape of Good Hope. Well, after that the Portuguese showed no more interest in Columbus’ speculative expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west.\n\nSo Columbus started pitching his idea to the Spanish Court, the French Court and even the King of England.\n\nAnd now we have some news that finally Columbus might be getting financing for his expedition. The Most Catholic monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand are willing to give it a try.”\n\nPierfrancesco paused for a moment and then continued:\n\n“We don’t know too much about Columbus. He is from Genoa, grew up there and is a seaman. Later he moved to Portugal and became a mapmaker. He also sailed on some expeditions along the African coast under the flag of the Portuguese King.\n\nNow Columbus lives in Seville and is leading discussions with the Spanish monarchs and their Royal Council.”\n\nPierfrancesco’s voice became more serious and he continued:\n\n“I need you to go the Seville and scope out the situation. Every week I want you to write me a letter with a detailed report on the developments there. I want to know everything, the big picture and the smallest details.”\n\nAmerigo nodded. He wanted to ask a question, yet Pierfrancesco continued:\n\nPierfrancesco: “I often get asked, what is more important, the big picture or the small details? I always answer that both are important, because sometimes the smallest detail can change the big picture.\n\nThe greatest masters can appreciate both the big picture and the small details.\n\nFor example, consider Botticelli’s painting Primavera. The one that is hanging downstairs. Did you know that that painting has over two hundred different types of plants and flowers in the background? Two hundred different types. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the detailed work it took for Botticelli to create such a masterpiece.\n\nI suggest, that on your way out, you take a good look at that painting to appreciate the scale and detail of Botticelli’s work.\n\nWell, anyways, back to Columbus. He is the guy you need to get close to! You know your assignment now! You will depart in about a month.\n\nWe will certainly discuss it more, but you can already start getting your affairs in order for the trip.”\n\nHe paused for a moment and then continued:\n\n“Ok, I have to meet up with Giovanni now.\n\nOh yeah. Hope you had fun at your first La Grande Festa.”\n\nSaying this Pierfrancesco got up and left the room.\n\nAmerigo sat there for a moment. He was feeling somewhat overwhelmed. These were some big news, moving to Seville for a year, in just a month.\n\nHe tried to think what it meant “getting your affairs in order for the trip”. Surely there would be a lot to do before moving to another city. Was one month enough? It would probably be a stressful month.\n\nHe then remembered that at sunset he was planning to meet with the young artist Torrigiano. Amerigo got up and walked downstairs. He did not look at Botticelli’s Primavera and just exited the Villa. He mounted his horse and started riding back into the City.\n\nChapter 8. Amerigo meets Torrigiano\n\nIt was little past sunset when Amerigo arrived at the Inn. When he walked in, he noticed that the place was fairly busy. He started scanning the sitting area and noticed a young man sitting by himself at one of the tables in the back. The man had a very upright posture, as if sitting in attention. Amerigo recognized the man’s posture from La Grande Festa and walked up to the table.\n\nAmerigo gazed the youth in the eyes and said:\n\nAmerigo: “I am glad that you came!”\n\nTorrigiano had long, brown, curly hair and brown eyes. His eyes were deeply-set and his eyebrows were very large.\n\nTorrigiano scanned Amerigo from top to bottom and replied: “Sure!”\n\nAmerigo sat down at the table and said:\n\nAmerigo: “They say you are one of the best from-memory-painters at the Medici Academy.”\n\nTorrigiano replied: “The best!”\n\nAmerigo was surprised by the confident answer. He then continued:\n\nAmerigo: “I have a commission for you.\n\nBut it is an unusual commission. I need you to paint a portrait of a canon at Santa Maria Del Fiore. Well he is my uncle. But you will see him only once, maybe twice. So you have to capture it all in your memory and draw from memory. Can you do that?”\n\nTorrigiano replied: “I can try my best.”\n\nAmerigo’s face expressed some satisfaction and he continued:\n\nAmerigo: “Also I want the portrait to look as gracious as Master Botticelli’s portraits. Have you seen many of his portraits?”\n\nTorrigiano replied: “Of course. That is all he talks about in his class.”\n\nAmerigo replied:\n\nAmerigo: “Great! I want it to look very similar to Master Botticelli’s portraits. I think it is always worth aspiring to the Master’s greatness.\n\nFurthermore, the canon does not know about the portrait, as it will be a surprise. We will visit him and converse with him. Which is when you will memorize his likeness.\n\nAnd lastly, I need you to leave the portrait unsigned. Don’t ask why!”\n\nTorrigiano replied with a smile: “Are we running a forgery scheme here?”\n\nHe paused for a moment and then continued: “Just kidding. I really don’t care, as long as you pay me!”\n\nThen Torrigiano started knitting his eyebrows, apparently thinking about something. After a moment he said:\n\nTorrigiano: “It will cost you fifty gold Florins and my art is not negotiable. Also I need half of it upfront.”\n\nAmerigo was shocked by the price and became pensive. But after a moment he replied:\n\nAmerigo: “Fine! But you better deliver some quality for that price! I also need it as soon as possible.”\n\nTorrigiano held out his hand and Amerigo shook it. Amerigo was surprised by the size and strength of Torrigiano’s powerful hand.\n\nAfter the handshake Amerigo continued: “Tomorrow we will visit my uncle, and then I will give you the twenty-five gold Florins.”\n\nTorrigiano nodded.\n\nChapter 9. Michelangelo at Santa Maria del Carmine\n\nAfter La Grande Festa Michelangelo had returned to his family home in Arezzo. He had proudly shown his new medallion to his father.\n\nHis father had embraced him with a smile but had replied, that his true potential is not captured in the awards he receives but in the works he creates. Then his father had added, that if anything, awards could lead to more complacency.\n\nSomehow Michelangelo was motivated by these words. On Friday morning he was one of the first to arrive at the Basilica Santa Maria del Carmine. The Medici Academy class had been assigned to study and copy the beautiful frescoes by the late Master Masaccio. These frescos decorated the Brancacci Chapel at the Basilica Santa Maria del Carmine.\n\nThe students were free to choose which fresco they wanted to copy. Michelangelo had chosen the fresco depicting St. Peter healing the sick with his shadow.\n\nIt was Michelangelo’s favorite fresco at the chapel.\n\nMichelangelo liked the fresco for its revolutionary use of perspective and the extensive chiaroscuro. He also like the realism in the images of the sick. He sat on the floor and was consumed by his work. He occasionally looked up towards the fresco, which was on the lower left side of the chapel.\n\nAs time passed many other students arrived.\n\nOne of the students was Torrigiano. Torrigiano looked tired. When Torrigiano arrived, he laid out his instruments in the middle of the chapel and began looking at the fresco decorating the upper right wall of the chapel. The fresco was called St. Peter and the Tribute Money.\n\nHe stood there staring at the fresco for several minutes. After looking at the fresco for about fifteen minutes, he began setting up his stand. Then he started looking at the fresco again while moving around and turning his head.\n\nEventually he began working on the background of his painting.\n\nMichelangelo had made significant progress with his work and one could already recognize the buildings and the sick men in front. To clear his mind, Michelangelo decided to take a break, got up and started walking around the chapel. He began closely examining the other frescos of the chapel and one could see the fascination on his face.\n\nWhen he was walking along the middle of the chapel, he looked at Torrigiano’s work. Michelangelo stopped and said:\n\nMichelangelo: “I wouldn’t start from that side. It will distort the composition.”\n\nTorrigiano’s face showed annoyance and he replied:\n\nTorrigiano: “You think you know everything better hmm?”\n\nMichelangelo replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “I am just making a suggestion that will make your work easier. Let me show you what I mean.”\n\nSuddenly, Michelangelo heard a crackling noise and felt a sharp pain spread along his face. An odd pressure gripped his forehead and he became momentarily disoriented. He fell down and blood started rushing out of his nose.\n\nTorrigiano had punched Michelangelo in the face and his nose was completely crushed.\n\nMichelangelo laid on the floor of the chapel in excruciating pain, unable to fully realize what had happened. His robe was completely bloody. Blood was still gushing out of his nose. After a moment Michelangelo fainted.\n\nChapter 10. Machiavelli Visits Home\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli had decided to visit his father Bernardo after having heard that his father’s health had worsened again. He was not sure what to expect from the visit. The last time him and his father had parted, they had an argument. His father had become increasingly irritable and difficult to interact with.\n\nWhen Niccolo arrived at his childhood home, he noticed that the door was ajar. He walked in and was surprised to see the place in complete disarray.\n\nSome of the storage chests were open and many items were spread on the floor throughout the room. Moments after he had entered the house, his sister Margherita walked up from one of the back chambers. She looked at Niccolo and with a trembling voice said:\n\nMargherita: “Niccolo, so glad that you came. The debt collectors were here again. Those evil, blood sucking creatures.”\n\nNiccolo walked forward and embraced his sister. He noticed that she was shaking. He tried to calm her by holding her and stroking her back. Then he asked with a firm voice:\n\nNiccolo: “Where is father?”\n\nMargherita replied:\n\nMargherita: “He left not too long ago and did not say where to. The collectors said that if we cannot make the next payment, they will come back and take something that is more valuable and break father’s fingers. I am scared!”\n\nNiccolo replied with an angry voice:\n\nNiccolo: “Those damn Medici bankers. What a corrupt bunch, sucking out the livelihood of helpless people. How can they do that? How can they live like that?”\n\nHe then looked at his sister and continued with a more reassuring voice:\n\nNiccolo: “Don’t worry Margha, I will take care of it. I will take care of everything.”\n\nThen he looked around the room for a moment and said:\n\nNiccolo: ”I have to go now. I will return later. Don’t worry Margha, everything will be fine.\n\nNiccolo walked out of the house and started walking towards his living chamber. His face expression was intense. While walking along the road he was staring down many passersby on the street, as if wanting to find a culprit.\n\nHe saw two young men walking in his direction. Both men wore large-brimmed red hats and blue tunics. They were engaged in a conversation. He continued to follow his path that was partially on a collision course with the two men. He did not intend to divert from his path. When they came closer and were passing him, his shoulder bumped one of the men.\n\nNiccolo yelled:\n\nNiccolo: “Watch where you are going!”\n\nThe men were surprised. Without looking at him they continued walking.\n\nWhen Niccolo arrived in his chamber, he walked directly to the corner of the room and moved one of the stands. Behind it was a metal chest. He opened the chest.\n\nThere it was, thirty gold florins, his entire savings. He looked at it for a while. He started counting the money, while wondering if it would be enough to make the debt payment. Most likely not but anything would help his father. He then grabbed the money and walked out of the chamber.\n\nChapter 11. Amerigo’s Dilemma\n\nThe word of Torrigiano’s and Michelangelo’s altercation had spread throughout Palazzo Medici. Torrigiano had broken Michelangelo’s nose. Amerigo had heard that Il Magnifico was furious and was considering banishing Torrigiano from Florence or even punishing him more severely.\n\nWorst of all Torrigiano was nowhere to be found. Some said that he was hiding outside of the city’s gates to avoid punishment. So Amerigo was back at zero again, without a painter, who could replicate his uncle’s missing portrait.\n\nAmerigo had considered enlisting Pierfrancesco’s help to plead leniency for Torrigiano’s punishment, so that Torrigiano could complete the portrait.\n\nBut the idea seemed challenging, considering that Il Magnifico loved Michelangelo as a son, and Amerigo was already in bad standing with Il Magnifico.\n\nAmerigo was not sure what to do. He wasn’t sure if he should risk bringing it up to Il Magnifico.\n\nSo to clear his head, Amerigo left the office early to visit the gambling house on Via Larga. Amerigo liked to gamble when he wanted to clear his head and often frequented that place.\n\nWhen he arrived at the gambling house, many of the regulars greeted him. Two young ladies approached him and briefly embraced Amerigo.\n\nThe gambling house was full of people and very noisy. Several players sat around five tables and played card games. Amerigo liked to play Bacalacci, a card game he was fairly good at.\n\nHe sat down at the table on the far right and scanned all the players. At the table on the far right sat five men, an elderly man with gray hair, a stout gentleman with a reddish face, a youthful man with short, curly hair, a middle-aged man with an odd blueish hat and a broad-shouldered gentleman wearing a purple cloak.\n\nWhen Amerigo sat down the stout gentleman greeted him with a nod and said with a smile: “I will not take it easy on you. You better be ready to play!”\n\nThe man had a large stack of coins in front of him.\n\nAmerigo replied: “I don’t like it easy!”\n\nHe took out his coin purse and spread the money in front of him.\n\nThe dealer shuffled the cards and they started playing.\n\nChapter 12. Palazzo Soderini\n\nPiero Soderini always had a serious face expression. Some said he never smiled. He had gray hair and dark eyes. His long, sharp nose gave his face an almost vulture like look. He usually wore a black robe and a black hat.\n\nThe Soderini were a noble Florentine family. For many generations the Soderini family had controlled the medical trade in Florence. But early in his life Piero Soderini had decided that his true passion was in political affairs.\n\nHe was a wise man and at the age of forty-one had lots of diplomatic experience. He was especially experienced in political and administrative roles in Florence, having served in many positions in the Florentine Signoria, the city’s elder’s council.\n\nHe had summoned his older brother Paolo, to discuss some recent political developments in Florence.\n\nBoth Paolo and Piero had studied at the Florentine Academy, founded by Cosimo de Medici.\n\nThe Florentine Academy had been subsequently reformed by Il Magnifico and rebranded as the Medici Academy.\n\nPaolo and Piero had studied with the influential scholar and humanist-philosopher Marsilio Ficino.\n\nPiero Soderini was a big admirer of Plato’s works and had read them extensively, after they had been translated into Latin by his Master Ficino.\n\nPiero sat on a large, red armchair in the middle of his grand study. The study was sparsely decorated, but had several, large shelves full of books.\n\nHis older brother Paolo had just arrived.\n\nAfter greeting his brother, Piero said:\n\nPiero: “The Medici are asking me to head a delegation to the French Court. What do you think? It could be an interesting opportunity to make some connections there. Do you want to come along?”\n\nPaolo Soderini was a man of tall stature. Paolo had black hair and rough facial features. He usually wore a black robe with an embroidered blue cross on it. He was an able statesman and jurist, and had traveled extensively in his younger years. While sitting down across from his brother, Paolo replied:\n\nPaolo: “I think it is better if I stay here and gather some local support. Have you seen what is happening with that Dominican friar at San Marco? He has a significant following. These people really believe in him.”\n\nPiero became pensive and then replied:\n\nPiero: “Well, as always, the crowd is easily manipulated. But you are right, maybe you should follow these developments here. We can use any support we can get.”\n\nPaolo nodded and replied:\n\nPaolo: “I think it would take more than one trip to Paris to make the right connections there. Above all you should try to get close to the French Cardinals. I have heard that they have the attention of the young King.”\n\nPiero became pensive again and then replied:\n\nPiero: “You are right! Maybe young Francesco can be useful in that regard. After all he has studied with many French clergymen in Avignon. He probably is still in touch with many of them.\n\nPiero paused for a moment and then continued with a sigh:\n\nPiero: “Oh dear brother, I don’t have the same energy anymore that I used to have. Maybe I need an energetic assistant to go with me to Paris. Someone who can help me with some organizational matters. But I need someone intelligent and trustworthy, which is so difficult to find nowadays. The entire town is infested with Medici cronies and spies. What a great democracy we have. ”\n\nPaolo replied:\n\nPaolo: You have enough energy brother. Don’t worry. But I will be on the lookout.\n\nPaolo paused for a moment and then continued:\n\nPaolo: “Also I will be meeting with Amerigo Vespucci tomorrow. For some reason he wants to ask some questions about Spain. It should be interesting talking to that Medici runner. Let’s see what information I can get out of him. He is always so easily aroused.\n\nAnyways, I wish I could stay longer but I need to leave now.\n\nJust make sure when you are at the French Court, take the time to communicate with everyone around the King. If we want the Kings support with need to have a strong power base there and supportive allies we can rely on.\n\nRemember what Master Ficino used to say, most interpersonal problems arise from misunderstandings and most misunderstandings arise from lack of communication. So take the time to communicate.”\n\nSaying this Paolo got up and left the study.\n\nChapter 13. The Gambling House\n\nAmerigo had been gambling for about four hours. He had amassed a large stack of coins. Several of the players had left the table after losing their money. Now there were only three players left at the table, Amerigo, the stout gentleman with a reddish face, and the young man with curly hair. The stout gentleman had lost most of his stack and was barely surviving. The young man had a comfortable stack in front of him but Amerigo had by far the largest position on the table.\n\nOn the next hand the stout gentleman decided to take a risk and made a big bet, Amerigo folded, but the young man called the bet. As the cards turned up, it was clear that the stout man had lost.\n\nThe stout man shook his head. He got up, shook the hands of the other two players and said: “Well played gentleman. Maybe I will have more luck tomorrow.”\n\nThe stout man walked away.\n\nNow Amerigo had only one opponent left. He was feeling comfortable with the challenge. He was by far the bigger stack and also seemed more experience than his opponent, who sometimes showed nervousness in his moves.\n\nThe young man was also playing very slowly, so Amerigo thought that he could bully him with his big position.\n\nThe dealer dealt the next hand. Amerigo got two tens. Amerigo made a sizable bet. It was not too big to scare his opponent but big enough to lure him in for a nice gain.\n\nAfter some hesitation the young man pushed all his coins into the middle of the table by betting it all.\n\nAmerigo was surprise. It was a courageous move, a move that he did not expect this soon. Amerigo attempted to understand what his opponent was doing.\n\nWas he trying to test him? Obviously Amerigo had a large stack and could easily call. Was it a desperation move?\n\nIf Amerigo called and won this hand, the game would be over. But if he lost the hand, he would sacrifice his dominant position. It was still early in this contest and he did not have a strong hand, so Amerigo decided to be patient and fold.\n\nThe dealer dealt the next hand and Amerigo tried to hide his excitement as he got three kings.\n\nThe young man made a small bet. Amerigo increased the bet by a significant amount hoping to lure him in again.\n\nThe young man again pushed all his coins into the middle of the table. Amerigo was perplexed. Was his opponent ready to leave and wanted to end it quickly?\n\nAmerigo had a very strong hand and knew that he could easily call the bet, and even if losing this hand, he could continue the game comfortably. So he quickly called the big bet.\n\nAs the cards opened up, Amerigo saw that his opponent had three queens and two sixes. Amerigo had lost. And now the two opponents’ positions were somewhat equal.\n\nOn the next hand Amerigo got two jacks. He made a very small bet.\n\nHis opponent hesitated again for a moment and again pushed all his coins into the middle of the table.\n\nAmerigo was perplexed again. Obviously his opponent knew what he was doing. Amerigo thought for a moment and decided to fold.\n\nThe dealer dealt the next hand and Amerigo got three tens and two jacks. He tried to hide his enthusiasm and was looking forward to revenge. His opponent made a sizable bet. Amerigo waited for a moment pretending to contemplate. After some time he raised by a significant amount.\n\nThe young man hesitated initially. Then after a moment he again pushed all his coins into the middle, by betting it all.\n\nAmerigo was beyond perplexed. Was his opponent playing seriously or just being reckless. Four times in a row going “all-in” seemed beyond excessive. Was this a bluff?\n\nAmerigo began thinking if he should call it or not. He had just enough coins to call the bet. Given the strong hand he had, maybe it was worth the risk.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli was nervous. Although he had a good hand there was a lot on the line. More specifically his entire life savings were on the line. Granted he was just twenty three, but he had worked so hard to save those initial thirty gold florins, which by now had more than tripled.\n\nIt had been a long game. He couldn’t believe that he had survived for this long. For several hours Niccolo had been playing slowly to remain in the game.\n\nBut early on, he had realized that the gentleman with the slender body and dark hair was the best player on the table. Therefore, Niccolo had studied him very carefully throughout the game, while only playing small hands. This older gentleman seemed also more experienced than him. So in the end it would take an unusual strategy to beat him.\n\nNiccolo had now survived three all-in calls, but he knew that sooner or later this tactic would play itself out unfavorably.\n\nOn the last hand he had almost overextended himself by bluffing to maintain his strategy, but was lucky that his opponent had not called the bluff.\n\nBut on this bet Niccolo had a strong hand and good chances of winning. So he had to take the chance.\n\nHe was still very nervous not knowing what his opponent had. His nerves were on the brink and his right knee was shaking. His hearth was beating profusely. Niccolo was trying his best to hide his nervousness.\n\nHis opponent was still contemplating, while looking directly at him trying to read his emotions.\n\nThen after a while his opponent said: “You are a gutsy young man.”\n\nNiccolo could barely breathe. He did not reply.\n\nAfter a moment his opponent called the bet. Niccolo’s anticipation grew. Soon he would find out if he would walk away with almost two hundred gold florins or nothing.\n\nHe showed his four sixes.\n\nHis opponent looked overwhelmed and opened his hand showing three tens and two jacks. A sense of relieve overcame Niccolo.\n\nHe could not help but to jump up from his seat. He felt a sudden rush going through his body. This burst of energy made him momentarily feel much more awake.\n\nHis opponent was bewildered and somewhat angry. But after a moment a smile came over his opponents face and he said:\n\nAmerigo: “You are a gutsy young man! I like that! I want to buy you a drink. Join me. I would like to get to know you better.”\n\nNiccolo was surprised by the offer but also intrigued by the man’s friendliness.\n\nHe replied: “Sure. Why not!”\n\nHe collected the two hundred gold florins from the table and put them into his purse.\n\nBoth man got up and left the gambling house together.\n\nChapter 14: Michelangelo in Despair\n\nThe pain and the swelling had subsided, yet Michelangelo barely ever left his room. He spent most of his days in bed. He did not eat much, he did not paint much, he did not sculpt much. He showed very little interest in anything. His nose was completely disfigured and the doctors had said that it would remain disfigured forever. The word forever had felt like a crushing blow.\n\nMost days Michelangelo usually laid in bed staring at the ceiling, not very responsive to visitors. Some mornings Piolo, the family dog, would come in with its tail wagging. But Michelangelo usually looked at the dog with his sad and expressionless eyes. He did not show any reaction. So Piolo would then turn around and leave the room again.\n\nThe few times Michelangelo had looked in a mirror, his dark eyes had become even sadder and tears had begun rolling down his face.\n\nHe thought that his nose looked disgusting. He wanted his old face back.\n\nSome nights he had nightmares and would wake up in the middle of the night unable to fall asleep again.\n\nHis father had tried to console him, telling him, that in the bigger picture all of it did not matter much and that there was so much more to life. Yet his father’s words sounded empty and were not too helpful.\n\nOne day his father came in and announced that Pietro Bembo was there and wanted to see him. Michelangelo barely showed a reaction to the announcement.\n\nShortly after, Pietro Bembo walked in. He had a lute in his hand and was wearing a long, green robe.\n\nPietro said with an enthusiastic voice:\n\nPietro: “There you are little soldier! I have been looking for you.”\n\nMichelangelo looked briefly towards the door and replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “What do you want?”\n\nPietro replied:\n\nPietro: “I want to play a song for you. You will like this song.”\n\nMichelangelo said with an emotionless voice:\n\nMichelangelo: “I don’t care for any songs right now.”\n\nPietro paused for a moment. He put his lute on the small table in the corner and walked up towards Michelangelo’s bed. He then said:\n\nPietro: “Michelangelo, you can’t hide here forever. You have to get out there. You have to do stuff, paint, sculpt, laugh. Above all laugh. Don’t let life pass you by.”\n\nMichelangelo replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “Why not? What is there left to pass me by?”\n\nPietro replied:\n\nPietro: “Hope my friend, hope! That is all we have. Faith in the future. You can’t lose that. Hold on to it. Hold on to the future. The Almighty knows your path.\n\nDo you know how many students at the Medici Academy would kill for your talents? You have a gift my friend. You were touched by the Almighty. Don’t let that gift become wasted.”\n\nMichelangelo angrily replied:\n\nMichelangelo: “Become wasted? I did not want this gift! I did not ask for it!”\n\nAnd by pointing at his disfigured face Michelangelo continued:\n\nMichelangelo: “Look what this gift has gotten me. Look!\n\nWho is there to tell me if I should or should not waste this gift? I don’t owe anything to anyone!”\n\nChapter 14B: Il Magnifico in Rage\n\nIl Magnifico was still furious about Torrigiano’s and Michelangelo’s altercation. He was leaning towards the harshest punishment for Torrigiano.\n\nIl Magnifico had summoned Pierfrancesco, Pico Della Mirandola and his son Piero to discuss the situation.\n\nPiero had received word from Pietro Bembo about Michelangelo’s despair. He was describing it to the other parties.\n\nPiero: “They say he doesn’t want to do anything. He doesn’t paint. He doesn’t sculpt. Most days he does not even leave his bed. He told Pietro Bembo that he will never paint or sculpt again.”\n\nIl Magnifico replied in rage.\n\nIl Magnifico: “This is unacceptable! I cannot believe that in our beloved city people can harm my geniuses. What should we do? We need to get the Signoria involved. If Torrigiano does not pay a big price, it will serve as an example for others and there will be more similar incidents.\n\nIl Magnifico added.\n\nIl Magnifico: “We need to have Torrigiano publicly hanged to set an example.”\n\nPiero replied.\n\nPiero: “But father the Signoria will never agree hanging someone for a fistfight. That would be unprecedented. Especially the Soderini will oppose it. They only have their own games in mind. That is the price of our democracy.”\n\nPierfrancesco interceded.\n\nPierfrancesco: “What if we asked the Signoria to pass a new bill, The Genius Protection Act? The bill will protect all geniuses from any intentional harm and hence many more are likely to resonate with it.”\n\nPico replied:\n\nPico: “But how would that work? How will they determine who is a genius?”\n\nPierfrancesco replied.\n\nPierfrancesco: “Surely these details can be resolved. And even if someone who is not a genius gets some protection from intentional harm that would be fine. We have to consider the big picture. Protecting a single genius is so valuable to our city that these side costs are acceptable. The deterring effect would be most useful.”\n\nPico squinted his eyes for a moment and replied.\n\nPico: “But what if it had the opposite effect and base mobs of criminals targeted geniuses even more? One never knows how people react to these new bills. In mobs people act like children or more like sheep.”\n\nPierfrancesco replied.\n\nPierfrancesco: “We have to experiment with it. We just have to make the punishment harsh enough, maybe public hanging or public burning. Philosophically it is comparable to our special bill for protecting holy friars. Geniuses after all were touched and gifted by the Almighty. So why not?”\n\nIl Magnifico replied.\n\nIl Magnifico: “I like the idea of Genius Protection Act. Public hanging can be the default punishment for any intentional harm against a genius. But we have to act quickly. I don’t want the news of this incident to create turmoil on the peninsula. And how can we get Michelangelo working again? I can’t believe they harmed my little jewel.”\n\nPico replied:\n\nPico: “I will talk to Father Savanarolla. Maybe if he has a discussion with Michelangelo, he can convince him that this is just a week when decades happen, yet the picture is bright and Michelangelo is part of Almighty's chosen path.”\n\nIl Magnifico nodded and said.\n\nIl Magnifico: “Give it a try! We have to try anything to get Michelangelo working again. I was hoping he would work on the new alter at San Lorenzo.”\n\nPierfrancesco added.\n\nPierfrancesco: “More importantly we have to get that bill drafted. I have heard of similar incidents at the D’Este court. Envy is always the price of genius. If we want Florence to continue flourishing, we have to protect all our geniuses at any cost from any harm.”\n\nAfter a moment Pico added.\n\nPico: “Also we still don’t know where Torrigiano is. Our search has been unsuccessful so far. Some say he has made his way to Rome. But we will find him.”\n\nIl Magnifico replied angrily.\n\nIl Magnifico: “Piero, assign more guards to the task. We cannot let this get out of control. We have to hunt him down even if he makes his way to Spain, ideally prior.”"
