It is believed the lady is Beatrice d'Este (1475-1497), duchess of Bari and later of Milan, the wife of Ludovico Sforza (known as \"il Moro\"). One of the most beautiful princesses of the Italian Renaissance, she was known for her good taste in fashion. This painting has being attributed to Ambrogio di Predis and to Leonardo da Vinci, buy many critics think it to be too poor to be by Leonardo,."
