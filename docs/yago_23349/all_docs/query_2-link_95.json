Join our English-speaking guided tour for better experience!\n\n“Lady with an Ermine” – Facts\n\n“Lady with an Ermine” is a Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, from around 1489-1490.\n\nThis portrait came into Polish art resources in 1800, after like the young Prince Adam Czartoryski bought it for his mother during his travel around Italy.\n\nWhy did he do this?\n\nHis mother, Princess Izabela Czartoryska was a real art lover, collector and founder of the Czartoryski Museum.\n\nBut princess wasn’t amazed with the gift she recieved.\n\nShe didn’t like the blue background of the portrait, so she covered it with a black color.\n\nFortunately, she did not get rid of the “Lady with an Ermine“:\n\nThe painting was exhibited at the Czartoryski family’s Gothic House in Puławy.\n\nDuring the November Uprising, it was deported to Paris.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, it was brought to Krakow to be a part of the Czartoryski Museum.\n\nBut you still must be wondering:\n\nWho is this lady?\n\nThe woman in the painting is Cecilia Gallerani (c. 1473-1536). She was 16 years old when a portrait was painted.\n\nShe was born in Siena, Italy where she received a solid education. She knew Latin, had musical talent and also wrote poetry.\n\nIn May 1489, she left home and moved to the Monastero Nuovo, where she met the prince of Milan – Lodovico Sforza.\n\nIt did not take a long time as they became lovers.\n\nAnd the next interesting puzzle is:\n\nWhy is the lady holding an ermine?\n\nArt experts at first thought that the animal is only a decorative element of the painting.\n\nBut later they figured out that ermine is an allusion to Lodovico Sforza.\n\nWhy so?\n\nHe sometimes went by the name ermellino bianco (white ermine).\n\nLeonardo could not paint a couple together because of Ludovico and Beatrice d’Este’s planned wedding.\n\nThat’s why he was portrayed allegorically as an ermine, which covers the pregnancy of Cecilia at the same time.\n\nSoon later she gave birth to his son – Cesare.\n\n“Lady with an Ermine” therefore has a very interesting history. Equally interesting are the details.\n\n“Lady with an Ermine”: Description\n\nThe uniqueness of this portrait has several causes.\n\nHowever, it is also unique in itself. You have to look a little bit closer if you want to see them.\n\nHere are some interesting facts:\n\nTechnical Specification:\n\nDimensions: 40.3 cm wide and 54.8 cm high.\n\nTechnique: oil on walnut board.\n\nPrevious versions of “Lady with an Ermine”\n\nThanks to Layer Amplification Method (LAM) we already know, that the ermine wasn’t the part of the painting from it’s beginning.\n\nHow is it possible?\n\nThis method gives an opportunity to peek between different layers of paint.\n\nSo it looks like Leonardo changed his mind twice:\n\nHe painted Cecilia without any animal first,\n\nthen he added an ermine with a gray fur coat,\n\nto change its shape and color at the end.\n\nYou can watch this process in the movie below:\n\nUnbelievable, right?\n\nBut it partly explains:\n\nWhy is “Lady with an Ermine” so important?\n\nThis portrait is one of the most important paintings in the world with reasons:\n\nYou have to know that it’s one of only four women’s portraits painted by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nThe painting is in excellent condition despite the passage of 500 years.\n\nAccording to some art historians, it is the first portrait of modern-ages in the world.\n\nThe portrait is a great example of individual Leonardo’s painting style and his unique light and shadow crossing.\n\nIt’s the first renaissance painting of a woman that shows her personality and mind, not only her beauty.\n\nDespite the static pose of the model, the picture seems to be very dynamic. It’s thanks to the illusion of model’s rotation and moving her gaze.\n\nDid you know that?"
