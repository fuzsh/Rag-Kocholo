        "text": "8\n\nBeloved Daughter\n\nSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\n\n—Leonardo da Vinci\n\nWe can imagine Leonardo seated, holding a wooden board to which parchment was affixed, his pen caressing the lines of the young woman’s lovely face as it took form on the surface.1 She was most likely posed across from him, utterly still, her lips slightly parted. She did not smile or frown. She did not fidget with boredom. Her brow was smooth, her posture erect, her gaze steady, her air calm. She would have known that for her father to commission a formal portrait was a supreme act of devotion, and she would have wanted to do it justice. Leonardo was a busy man who had paused in his many court obligations to produce this portrait.\n\nIn spite of those obligations, which must have weighed on the artist, his concentration was complete, as though he were attempting to channel the spirit of his subject. He strove, as always, for an eternal portrait, an ode to the young woman and to her father, the duke.\n\nThat he could bring such intensity to a simple portrait was a marvel, especially considering the major commissions that were not yet completed. One of these was a grand piece for the friars of St. Dominic at Milan’s Santa Maria delle Grazie: a large-scale painting that would become his portrayal of the Last Supper, which he had been working on for quite some time. According to the biographer Giorgio Vasari, the effort required long stretches of meditation because he was intent on portraying not only the group of men around the divine Christ but also their emotions at the point when Christ announced, “One of you will betray me.” What were the thoughts of the innocents—love, fear, indignation, and sorrow—and could one read guilt in the expression of Judas?\n\nLike others who had commissioned Leonardo, the prior of the monastery was anxious to see the work completed, and he could not understand what was taking so long. Vasari recounts that the prior would see Leonardo standing around lost in thought, “wasting time” when he could have been working, and it annoyed him greatly. Finally, he complained to the duke, and Ludovico il Moro sent for Leonardo. “The Prior doesn’t understand,” Leonardo told Ludovico. “Great artists may be working their hardest when they appear to be doing the least—forming those perfect ideas which afterwards they express with their hands.”2\n\nHe added that he had only two heads left to do—that of Christ, whose beauty and divinity his imagination was in-adequate to fully portray, and that of Judas. “I feel incapable of imagining a form to express the face of him who after receiving so many benefits had a soul so evil that he would resolve to betray his Lord,” he said, adding that he had been looking for a model of such a face. “If I can find no better, there is always the head of the Prior,” he joked, causing Ludovico to roar with laughter.3\n\n“You are dead right,” the duke told Leonardo, and he promised that the prior would give him no more trouble.4\n\nLeonardo’s second major project, which had already been years in the making, was an equestrian monument to Francesco Sforza. It was clearly a standout and generated much excitement among those who saw the massive clay horse developing before their very eyes. People said they had never seen anything so beautiful or more superb, but it was a long way from completion.\n\nYet in spite of these large obligations, Leonardo’s concentration on the girl and the portrait was absolute. With every stroke, he sought to illuminate her soul.\n\nThe woman in La Bella Principessa is young, and the portrait itself is quite formal. It does not have the intimate, “come hither” aura of Mona Lisa. Stylistically, the profile implies distance. But who is she, and when was she drawn?\n\nMartin and Pascal, with their historical sensibility veering into the poetic, imagined her thus:\n\nA young lady, or a girl on the cusp of maturity, is costumed for a formal portrait. Her fashionable accoutrements are those of a Milanese court lady in the 1490s. She wears a green dress, under which is a red bodice. The shoulder of the dress is “slashed” to reveal a triangle of red. Green, red, and white were favored by the Sforza family, rulers of Milan. Around the aperture runs a continuous knot design in raised thread. The central flourish at the top of the knotwork is punctuated by embroidered points. Her light brown hair, glowing and tightly bound, is elaborately dressed with a caul of knotted ribbons, edged by a smaller interlace design. It is held in place by a thin band located at precisely the right angle on her forehead. Extruding from the net, her pigtail––the Milanesecoazzone––is bound into a neat cylinder by a tightly circled thread. Below this binding, a flat ribbon disposed in two spirals constrains the long tresses of her hair, only a little less strictly.\n\nThe details are beautifully observed. Her ear plays a subtle game of hide-and-seek below the gentle waves of her hair. The band pulls the rear profile of the caul into a slight concavity. Below each band of the spiraling ribbon, her hair swells slightly before it is constricted again by the next loop.5\n\nCan we sense a tension between the fresh innocence of the young lady and the formal courtly duties that her costume signals as her destiny––before she has become a mature woman ready for the fixed responsibilities of aristocratic marriage and the hazards of childbearing? She is, we may be reasonably certain, fated to become a young bride, betrothed early to cement a social alliance. It is not difficult to be romantic about such an image. It is almost too perfect in its refined poise.\n\nIt was irresistible to contemplate what Leonardo himself might say about the drawing and the setting. Martin and others were certain that details of the dress and style pointed to the 1490s, when Leonardo was at the Milanese court.\n\nDuring that time, he did several portraits for Ludovico il Moro, including the famous Lady with an Ermine—which was, coincidentally, the second Leonardo work digitalized by Pascal on a visit to Kraków. The beautiful, serene portrait depicts the duke’s mistress Cecilia Gallerani holding a white ermine (a symbol of purity and also a Sforza symbol) to her breast. She was no more than sixteen or seventeen at the time, and, unusual for a young woman of the period, she was extremely well educated and an amateur poet and philosopher.\n\nCecilia was not a concubine in the conventional sense but a courtesan whose intellect, style, and sensuality put her on a pedestal in the court during the ten years of her involvement with the duke. She bore him one child, and then went on to marry and have four other children. The portrait itself was a new style for the artists of the period. Typically, portraits were cool and emotionless, with little hint of the subject’s personality or thoughts—especially when the subject was a woman. Leonardo infused Cecilia’s portrait with life. One can gaze at her countenance and see her deportment, her intelligence, and her selfhood shining through. This, the observer can see, was a woman of substance.\n\nMany years later, Leonardo would take his humanizing approach quite a bit further with the portrait of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo: the Mona Lisa. That smile! It just wasn’t done. Yet Leonardo apparently evoked it deliberately, perhaps by arranging entertainment for Lisa while she was sitting, and captured her amusement with his brush.\n\nMartin had often contemplated Leonardo’s special “eye for the ladies.” Indeed, there is only one known male portrait in existence: the unfinished Musician in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan. Martin observed:\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was employed by some very powerful men, including members of the Medici family, Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, and two French kings, Louis XII and Francis I. He was an innovative and masterly portraitist. It is remarkable, therefore, that we have no record of his undertaking portraits of any of his major male patrons. Instead, we have an early portrait of a woman in the Medici circle, two surviving portraits of the Duke’s mistresses, a splendid chalk drawing of Isabella d’Este, the redoubtable Marchioness of Mantua, and the famous portrait of Lisa, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a Florentine silk merchant who was acquainted with Leonardo’s father. . . . To add to the list of ‘Leonardo’s Ladies,’ we now have the remarkable portrait of the young woman in profile, which I have christened La Bella Principessa.6\n\nMartin speculated that Leonardo might have been considered something of a specialist in portraying women. As Isabella d’Este, the Marchesa of Mantua, once wrote, he deployed “that air of sweetness and suavity” in which his art peculiarly excels. Who could deny that Leonardo’s sensitive, even sensual, portrayals of women—from Mona Lisa to the new La Bella Principessa—have a stirring quality that seems to reach into the ladies’ souls?\n\nVasari would surely agree, judging by his description of Leonardo’s Mona Lisa:\n\nThe mouth, with its opening, and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face, seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh. In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse. And, indeed, it may be said that it was painted in such a manner as to make every valiant craftsman, be he who he may, tremble and lose heart. He made use, also, of this device: Mona Lisa being very beautiful, he always employed, while he was painting her portrait, persons to play or sing, and jesters, who might make her remain merry, in order to take away that melancholy which painters are often wont to give to the portraits that they paint. And in this work of Leonardo’s there was a smile so pleasing, that it was a thing more divine than human to behold; and it was held to be something marvelous, since the reality was not more alive.7\n\nMartin did not believe, as many did, that Leonardo was homosexual. He could find no reflection of sexual orientation or preference in the artist’s portrayals of men and women. Leonardo’s reverence for beauty in all its natural forms was more profound than sexual fantasy.\n\nPerhaps, Martin surmised, other court artists were sufficient to the task of portraying male figures—on horses, on shields, at war, stamped on coins—with their stark formality, whereas only Leonardo had an eye for bringing life to the faces of beloved females. He also rendered them with an intimacy that was suitable for private settings, not formal portraits. In each case, the subject appears to be responding to a person or an activity outside the picture. She is alive and fully human.\n\nAlthough the portrait of Cecilia Gallerani was probably produced several years before La Bella Principessa, there are enough stylistic similarities to place the latter comfortably in the period of the Sforza court. Martin advised that there were five women in Sforza’s court who might have sat for such a portrait. However, three of them—Ludovico’s wife, Beatrice; Isabella of Aragon, the wife of Ludovico’s nephew Gian Galeazzo; and Ludovico’s niece Beatrice—could be ruled out, since existing portraits showed what they looked like. There remained two possibilities: Ludovico’s niece Anna and his illegitimate daughter Bianca. Kemp found himself focusing on the young woman Bianca for a number of reasons, including her extreme youth (Anna was six years older).\n\nBianca, the illegitimate daughter of Ludovico’s mistress Bernardina de Corradis, was the apple of the duke’s eye. In the secularized Milan of the period, the distinction between wife and mistress was not so morally loaded. Because Bianca was so highly favored, Ludovico took steps to legitimize her in 1489, before betrothing her to Galeazzo Sanseverino, the highly regarded commander of his armies. Since Bianca was a mere eight or nine years old at the time, the wedding date was set for 1496, when she would be at least thirteen.\n\nBianca’s future husband was a major figure at the court, a dear friend of the duke’s and a patron of Leonardo’s. Leonardo would often visit Galeazzo’s stables to measure his horses and sketch the anatomical drawings that would become so highly prized. One might imagine that the two men also discussed weaponry, which was a topic of great fascination to Leonardo.\n\nEvidence of Bianca’s favor with her father is the fact that he commissioned the creation of a sonnet by the court poet, Bernardo Bellincioni, on the occasion of her betrothal.\n\nOne can recognize and see the person,\n\nWith a great mind in their early years;\n\nToday Bianca will be for the world a phoenix,\n\nBecause good fruit stems from its roots,\n\nAnd she is the heir of her father’s mind.\n\nHeaven accords her a groom\n\nWho will make them both happy.\n\nWhat an unerring choice, both proper and wonderful,\n\nWas made by my patron Ludovico,\n\nBecause nothing is missing in this couple.\n\nThis star [Bianca] was lacking for Galeazzo,\n\nAnd Galeazzo, friend of virtue, was lacking only Bianca.8\n\nIt was common during the Renaissance for portraits to be commissioned around major events in a subject’s life, and the Sforza court, with its love of pageantry, followed this tradition. The portraits were often bound into tribute books, often garish and elaborate, that sang the praises of the subject. Indeed, Leonardo’s portrait of Cecilia Gallerani was accompanied by such a poem, which began:\n\nNature, what provokes you, who arouses your envy?\n\nIt is Vinci, who has painted one of your stars!9\n\nKnowing of Bianca’s place in Sforza’s heart and of her betrothal to Galeazzo, we can quite plausibly say that she was the subject of a portrait. There is also evidence that this portrait was bound into a book, possibly of poems, which was the tradition. Impressions on the grooves of the vellum of our portrait suggest that it was removed from a book. This may help explain why the portrait disappeared from view for such a lengthy period.\n\nAll of the beauty and promise evident in the portrait was short-lived. In November 1496, only four months after her marriage, Bianca died as the result of a fatal passione de stomach. The cause is not known, although one speculation is that she may have had an ectopic pregnancy. At the time, there were also whispers of the possibility of poisoning, but they led nowhere.\n\nNiccolò da Correggio, the court poet who replaced Bellincioni after his death, wrote the bittersweet tribute:\n\nBianca, the daughter of the Duke,\n\nhaving achieved two lustri\n\nPlus a little more than one half of the third,\n\nWas delighting with Galeazzo in the pleasures of marriage.\n\nWhen conjoined in passion within their encampment,\n\nIn the midst of a such a sweet game,\n\nShe departed her body\n\nAnd went amongst the elected souls,\n\nHer beauty and grace buried first in human breasts,\n\nNot content with being only in one place.\n\nWhy do you reside in such different graves?\n\nThe stones have the bones,\n\nWhile the world preserves her name,\n\nSince her virtues can be preserved in prose and poetry.\n\nAbove all others, Galeazzo, for whom the harvest\n\nWas reaped while still green,\n\nHis fruits becoming lost,\n\nCan say that Death was unripe for him.10\n\nIncidentally, a lustro is a span of five years, so the poem would indicate that Bianca was thirteen or fourteen at the time of her death. Studying La Bella Principessa, Martin had a new thought. Noting her lack of celebratory jewelry and the restraint of her costume, he had initially been puzzled. He especially found the absence of pearls interesting. The Sforza court delighted in pearls, and the duke had something of a fetish for them. Martin now wondered if the portrait might have been commissioned as a memorial at the time of Bianca’s death and not as a celebratory matrimonial portrait. “If so,” he wrote, “Leonardo has evoked the sitter’s living presence with an uncanny sense of vitality.”11\n\nMartin and others who viewed the portrait from a historical perspective could not fail to conclude that everything about the style and fashion of the subject was consistent with the Milanese court of the late fifteenth century.\n\nThe long braid she wears in her portrait is called a coazzone—it was typical for the fashion-conscious ladies of the court to wear extremely long and elaborately bound pigtails in the 1490s in Milan; the mistresses could be portrayed in less conventional poses, but their daughters, the princesses, warranted the formal profile.\n\nWhile he was studying the portrait, Martin was contacted by a young Italian costume historian named Elisabetta Gnignera. She was in the process of writing a study of hairdressing in the fifteenth century, and she wanted to include La Bella Principessa, since in her opinion “the portrayed Lady wears a beautiful example of a late fifteenth century/early sixteenth century coazzone hair dressing—the so-called acconciatura alla spagnuola [Spanish hairdressing], which was in fashion in Italy no later than the first years of the sixteenth century.”12\n\nAs Gnignera studied the portrait, she elaborated on the following points to Martin:\n\n·The hairstyle in La Bella Principessa was in fashion in Italy from 1491 to 1499—and “absolutely not beyond 1500.” This would fit the period of Bianca’s marriage, as well as Leonardo’s presence at the court.\n\n·In 1491, when Beatrice d’Este entered the Sforza court as the wife of the duke, she established herself as a trendsetter by putting into fashion a particular style of coazzone, which she made unique with subtle differences from the Spanish style. This is thecoazzone worn by the subject of La Bella Principessa.\n\n·By the final years of the fifteenth century, a new hairstyle—the fòggia alla Francese (French style)—replaced the coazzone. An example of the new style can be found in the drawing of Isabelle d’Este attributed to Leonardo, with long hair wrapped in a subtle hairnet.\n\nGnignera’s input confirmed what Martin’s studies had showed him regarding the high fashionability of the coazzone in the Sforza court during the 1490s. To achieve the required length on these elaborately bound pigtails, a hairpiece was generally added and colored to match the lady’s hair.\n\nMartin was also drawn to the intricate knot pattern in the fabric. Leonardo had been fascinated by knots since at least 1480 and had earlier used them as a motif in his portrait of Cecilia Gallerani. Martin would later write down his view that the two examples “show not only an identical way of fashioning the loops, but the same skill and intelligence in rendering the perspective as the ornament follows curves and recedes into the distance. This element is very important, for it confirms that we are in the presence of two works realized with the same creative spirit, the same sense of perfection, and an identical manner of treating details, however tiny they might be.”13\n\nVezzosi was also very taken with evidence found in the patterns, commenting, “The ‘Leonardesque knot’ on the shoulder is obviously a paradigm of the artist and not only a decorative feature. It constitutes here an original assemblage, in a unique arabesque, in the form of geometrical matrices with two knots, alluding to symbols of infinity, like those drawn at the end of 1473 and which can be seen elaborated in the clothing of both Lady with an Ermine and the Mona Lisa. The border reinforces it, also with simplified knots, which run around the edge of the sleeve in a reticulated pattern, which is, in its turn, created by the most refined interlacing. The hairdo, called in Milan a ‘coazzone,’ is also characteristic of the period and was fashionable at the Sforza court.”14\n\nCristina Geddo concurred, writing,\n\nThis was a fashion of Spanish origin, imported by Milan upon the marriage of the daughter of the King of Naples, Isabella of Aragon, to Gian Galeazzo Sforza (1489), but refined and imposed by Beatrice d’Este, daughter of Eleonora of Aragon and younger sister of Isabella, who married Ludovico il Moro in 1491 and was already dead in 1497. The hairstyle, a “coazzone,” is also worn by the Belle Ferronière (Lucrezia Crivelli) in the Louvre, datable to about 1496–99 and thus chronologically close to our portrait. This look quickly dwindled at the turn of the century with the arrival of the French and the abrupt end of the era of Ludovico il Moro, and was replaced by the loose, layered cut inspired by Transalpine fashion, already adopted by Isabella d’Este in the Leonardo cartoon, datable to early 1500. . . . This is therefore an important element for securing thePortrait of a Young Woman in Profile to Milanese territory, and to a time period before 1499, when the artist left the Lombard capital.15\n\nIn other words, the Master’s hand is distinctive.\n\n“The lady in profile is an important addition to Leonardo’s canon,” Martin said with certainty. “Within the apparently inflexible format of a profile, it exhibits a graphic refinement and poetic beauty that lies far beyond what anyone in his circle could accomplish. He has characterized the youthful sitter, perhaps the tragic Bianca, with infinite tenderness, decisively surpassing (as he would fervently have wished) the effusions of the court poets.”16\n\nBased on an accumulation of interlocking evidence, Martin had no doubt of Leonardo’s authorship. “After forty years in the Leonardo business, I thought I’d seen it all,” he told me emotionally. “But I had not. The delight I had when I first saw it has been reinforced enormously. I’m absolutely convinced.” He added, with a slight shaking in his voice, “Above all, it’s thrilling to look at. There is an incredible freshness, a delicacy. I have seen Mona Lisa out of its frame. I have seen Lady with an Ermine out of its frame. All of Leonardo’s works have an inner life. The sitters seem to live. This is a rare gift that no other artist, with the possible exception of Rembrandt, could achieve.”\n\nHe concluded, “After repeated viewings, scientific analysis, and intensive research, I have not the slightest doubt that the portrait that I am calling La Bella Principessa is a masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci.” One of the greatest Leonardo scholars in the world was a believer.\n\nI realized that no matter how many experts praised the work as a Leonardo or signed documents stating their beliefs, there would still be an opposing side that would forever question its authenticity. I found the notion somewhat depressing. If only there was a way to prove Leonardo’s authorship beyond doubt!\n\nIn that respect we had a potential trump card. Pascal and Martin spoke to me about the fingerprint and palm print that were clearly visible in the pigment—and almost certainly belonged to Leonardo. Martin had a fingerprint expert in mind who might confirm it."
