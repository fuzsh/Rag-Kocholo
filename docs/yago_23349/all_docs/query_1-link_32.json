        "text": "In the future Janos Corvinus, King of Hungary would say who his greatest fortune was not marrying the more beautiful girl with the larger dowry and that was without doubt true: his former fiancée Bianca Maria Sforza was stunning but empty headed, while her cousin Isabella of Aragon was less beautiful (but still very pretty) but much smarter, brilliant and brave and had helped him a lot in securing his crown. Isabella on her side had no regret at all for the handsome Gian Galeazzo and the splendid Milan: getting real power there would be much harder than had been securing the Hungarian crown and with Janos she had everything she needed: power, an husband who trusted her and willing to share power and ruleship with her (and truly after the eight months of humiliation in Milan she had been scared as her new husband was only sixteen and so the relief in having her second wedding consummated more than once in the wedding night had been great). Isabella of Naples was without doubt one of the most powerful and influential Queens of Hungary and while her wedding initially had not made her aunt Beatrice well disposed towards her in the end the childless Queen had resigned to her fate and accepted to help and guide Isabella in secure and ruling Hungary. Sure Beatrice still disliked Janos but Isabella was her niece and in their children her bloodline mixed with that of Matthias, so she was satisfied enough (and trying to damage Janos would made her losing everything so she had no true alternative). Matthias Corvinus died in October 1492, knowing who his son’s position as heir was secure and who his line would continue as Isabella was pregnant with her second child while his little namesake was already 20 months old (the future Matthias II was born in the first days of February 1491, ten months after the wedding of his parents)\n\nBianca Maria Sforza had received the news who she was to depart with her cousin (and sister-in-law) Isabella for Naples, where she was to marry her cousin Ferrandino, Isabella’s brother and second-in-line for the crown of Naples with some anxiety as her future father-in-law and grand-father-in-law were well know for their cruelty and that was enough to scare also a girl like her, but once Isabella had reassured her about her husband-to-be‘s character (as the younger Ferrante had not inherited the worst parts of his father and grandfather‘s personalities) and told her who the only way in which she would risk their displeasure were not being a faithful wife, criticizing their rule and interfere in politics (all things well away from Bianca Maria’s character) she had embarked for Naples more confident in her future, discovering once arriving there who Isabella had not lied to her.\n\nThe younger Ferrante was a determined but kind young man who was enchanted by the beauty of Bianca Maria and by her sweet character while her new in-laws were fully satisfied with her and unable to find any fault in the girl as Bianca Maria was stunning, kind and sunny, and her interests spaced from tissues, embroidery and dresses, to dancing, hunting, and attending the life of the court so she became quickly one of the starts of the court of Naples. Bianca Maria‘s proxy wedding was celebrated in Milan in October 1489, and she arrived in Naples in December, where her wedding to Ferrandino was celebrated in person and consummated, so once she had given birth to her first child, a son who would be dutifully called Alfonso in November 1490, King Ferrante and Alfonso, Duke of Calabria would find no faults at all in her. Bianca Maria and Ferrandino‘s second child, a daughter who would be named Bianca Maria, followed in 1492, reassuring the royals of Naples of Bianca Maria’s fertility. The next years would be more troublesome as all the following children of Bianca Maria would be daughters: Isabella, born in 1493 and Beatrice in 1495.\n\nThe much beloved Bianca Maria would become Duchess of Calabria after the death of old King Ferrante in January 1494, and Queen of Naples, when her father-in-law King Alfonso died suspiciously in May 1495 after a year and half of rule. Ferrante II and Bianca Maria were a popular couple and their ascension helped to stabilize the hold of the Neapolitan branch of the Aragon’s on their throne.\n\nThe most celebrated of the ladies of the Italian Renaissance is without doubt and deservedly Beatrice d’Este Sforza, Duchess of Bari and Milan, but nobody would have been able to predict that when she married Ludovico Sforza at 15 years and half. Ludovico originally had asked the hand of her elder sister Isabella, but was forced to content himself with Beatrice, one year younger, as his request arrived a little too late as Ercole had just promised Isabella to the heir of Mantua. Isabella, the eldest child and the apple of her parents‘ eye, was considered to be the most beautiful, cultured and skilled, in the few years who the two girls spend together in Ferrara (as Beatrice was raised in Naples since she was two years old, returning to Ferrara when she was ten years old), so the fact who she was destined to Mantua while the less brilliant Beatrice had gotten the best match to the de-facto ruler of the richer and splendid Milan was felt as an injustice by many of Ercole’s councilors, who believed Isabella wasted in Mantua and Beatrice inadequate to Milan and made no mystery of that. The fact who Isabella always received passionate letters from her fiancé Francesco Gonzaga, who was waiting impatiently the moment in which he would be allowed to marry his betrothed, while Ludovico was mostly ignoring her and delayed twice the wedding added to Beatrice’s woes as some “well intentioned“ courtiers let ”accidentally“ slip whispers about Cecilia Gallerani in her presence, letting her know who her future husband’s heart belonged to another.\n\nThe fact who Isabella’s highly anticipated wedding in 1490 had gone smoothly with a groom impatient to be wed and was the event of the year in both Ferrara and Mantua also added to the torments of the poor Beatrice, who would have been happy to marry Francesco, at least until the moment in which she would finally meet Ludovico after arriving in the Duchy of Milan for the wedding in January 1491. What many forgot about Beatrice was the fact who she had been raised in Naples at the court of her grandfather (again in the shadows of her elder cousin Isabella of Aragon, the unlucky former Duchess of Milan now Crown Princess of Hungary, reason for which while she loved both Isabella she would NEVER call her daughters after them) and had learned the art to planning her moves and wait for the right moment before striking and would be able to apply it very well in future, at the point who many would be grateful who Milan had never become theatre of a fight between Beatrice d’Este and Isabella of Aragon as the skills of both women would have likely set the Duchy of Milan on fire (and that without counting Ludovico) and the two women instead of remaining always friends would likely become bitter rivals. Yes, Milan had much to be grateful for that and for the fact who Beatrice and not Isabella d’Este was the sister married to Ludovico (not who Isabella would have done a bad job, but is unlikely she would ever reached Beatrice‘s level).\n\nIn the end the long waited ended and the wedding of Ludovico and Beatrice was scheduled for January 1491, together with the one of Alfonso d’Este and Anna Maria Sforza so a big company departed from Ferrara in December of 1490 who included the Duchess Eleonora and all her three children as Isabella, Marchioness of Mantua, who was enjoying her status of married woman, first lady of her court and was rising to be one of the most fashionable ladies of the time, would have not lost the weddings of her siblings for any reason: sure her husband was a commander of the armies of Venice (who was enemy of Milan) but that mean who he would be unable to attending the weddings (but he would still attend to them in incognito as Francesco hated losing a good party almost as his wife), not who she also was to be deprived of the joy to participate to her siblings’ great days. Isabella would be successful, at the point who for many she almost obscured her sister and sister-in-law during the celebrations, but would also learn an hard lesson: she had long made fun of Beatrice’s troubles, secure of a radiant future for herself, while her sister was destined to an uninterested older man who was not the true ruler of his domain, but now she would be extremely invidious of her sister’s destiny as Ludovico was not really so old and had much more charme and charisma than her beloved Francesco and Beatrice would be the first lady of the most splendid and richest city of the world while she was forced to keep count of her expenses and renounce to her most extravagant projects as they were too costly for Mantua’s finances (who were inferior also to the ones of her native Ferrara). She was the most beautiful and talented sister and the fact who she was left to envy Beatrice was deeply unfair, like the fact who she was forced to act as everything was fine and she was not hurt by discovering the level of her sister’s good luck. Still Francesco loved her and Ludovico himself looked more interested to flirt with her than spending time with the still brooding Beatrice and that counted as a win in Isabella‘s books. Ludovico and Beatrice were married in Pavia, without excessive pomp as Ludovico reputed who that would be of bad taste as the rightful Duke Gian Galeazzo had not a grandiose wedding as he and his wife were still in mourning for the death of Ippolita (mother of the bride and aunt of the groom) at the time of their wedding, and with that disaster still fresh in the mind of everyone, well Ludovico had no wish to celebrate his wedding in Milan, so he decided to leave the most magnificent scenario to Alfonso and Anna Maria, who would marry some days later, while celebrating his own wedding in a place dear to his heart.\n\nThe entrance of Beatrice, Duchess of Bari, in Milan was a splendid event, like the wedding of Anna Sforza to Alfonso d’Este the following day and the joust and all the lavish celebrations for both weddings were an event who would be remembered for years. The rightful Duke of Milan was happy to receive Beatrice and demonstrate once again his interests as the only things about which he talked to her were his hunts and dogs, and after inquiring about Beatrice’s interest in the matter promptly invited her to join him and his friend after receiving an affirmative response.\n\nThe young Beatrice would not reveal herself as a placid bride, as at the beginning she was too much reluctant in the wedding bed, forcing Ludovico to not consummate the wedding, mostly because she was scared and reluctant to be touched but possibly also as sort of revenge for his previous lack of attention. Still Ludovico’s troubles would be resolved in a couple of months and after that Beatrice, free from the shadows of her mother, sister and cousin, would soon bloom in Milan, revealing her true character and unsuspected skills, capturing first the attention and shortly after the heart of her husband, who would start to fall deeply in love with her after some months, shifting his affection from Cecilia to Beatrice.\n\nCecilia Gallerani would not protest this development as Ludovico had been generous during their relationship and when he dismissed her after the birth of their son Cesare, would generously provide to both mother (as Cecilia was married to the Count Bergamini and received many riches as goodbye gift, including the beautiful Palace Carmagnola) and son as Cesare was recognised by his father and later would receive many benefits in his ecclesiastical career. Ludovico’s illegitimate daughter Bianca Giovanna, only ten years old and already married to Ludovico’s favorite Galeazzo Sanseverino, would quickly become Beatrice‘s favoured companion in Milan as she and her stepmother would immediately become friends and spend much time together, something who suited Ludovico, who loved dearly his daughter and had already charged Sanseverino, who was a condottiero famous in all Europe for his ability in the jousts, with the job of providing to Duchess Beatrice’s security and entertainment. Ludovico and Beatrice’s family would be increased with the birth of their first child Francesco (after Ludovico’s father) in 1493, two years after his parent’s wedding, and followed two years later by another boy called Ercole after his maternal grandfather. Both births would be heavily celebrated in Milan, as Ludovico and Beatrice were much loved and their sons secured the succession in the Duchy."
