        "text": "One other option for Juan is Isabella d'Este b 1474.\n\nPretty unlikely. Isabella d’Este was engaged when she was five or six years old and also her younger sister Beatrice (b 1475) was engaged at the same time... Pretty unlikely who butterflies will affect the engagement between Isabella and Francesco but at the same time the Este girls are not an interesting match for the son of Ferdinand and Isabella... Anna Maria (b 1473) or Bianca Maria (b 1472) Sforza or their cousin from Savoy are more likely matches but still not between the favorite candidates...\n\nMilan, Savoy and Ferrara are not important enough for having one of the daughters of their ruler being choised by Ferdinand and Isabella as wife of their heir...\n\nI think who in a scenario in which Spain has Naples, Sicily and Sardinia and Ludovico Sforza is able to survive and keep Milan for his family an ATL daughter of Ludovico and Beatrice would be an interesting choice as daughter-in-law for Juan...\n\nHmmm, I shall look for brides from those countries....\n\nIf I can make some suggestions:\n\na) an ATL daughter of Jõao of Portugal and Leonor of Viseu\n\nb) Catherine of Navarre (six years older than Juan) if her brother die like OTL\n\nc) the ATL eldest daughter of Maximilian of Austria (likely called Eleanor after Maximilian’s mother)\n\nd) the next daughter of Edward IV of England\n\nGood question. Would it be more fun if they survived or if they died?\n\nI will say to kill off Francis Phoebus (because keeping him alive will affect too much Spain as he was really interested in marrying la Beltraneja in OTL and will be also ITL) but keep Nicholas alive if you do not want marry Mary of Burgundy to Maximilian of Austria...\n\nPlus with Francis Phoebus dead Catherine became a top bride (for either Juan, Prince of Asturias or Charles, Dauphin of France or she can marry her OTL husband Jean d’Albret... all three are pretty unlikely matches if she is not Queen)\n\nI will say to kill off Francis Phoebus (because keeping him alive will affect too much Spain as he was really interested in marrying la Beltraneja in OTL and will be also ITL) but keep Nicholas alive if you do not want marry Mary of Burgundy to Maximilian of Austria...\n\nPlus with Francis Phoebus dead Catherine became a top bride (for either Juan, Prince of Asturias or Charles, Dauphin of France or she can marry her OTL husband Jean d’Albret... all three are pretty unlikely matches if she is not Queen)\n\nThat being said, keeping Francis Phoebus alive also has interesting implications. He's not going to be able to marry La Beltranjera here, we've already dealt with her, but he's of a reasonable age for either of the elder infantas. I could see Ferdinand pressing for a match between him and Ana, you know."
