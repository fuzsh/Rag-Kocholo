        "text": "Cecilia Gallerani is the lady with the ermine.\n\nCecilia's family\n\nCecilia Gallerani was born in Milan in 1473. Her father Fazio was an ambassador for the Italian small states, among others for the republics of Florence and Lucca. However, he died very early, when Cecilia was 7 years old. Her mother Margherita Busti was the daughter of a jurist. The couple had six sons besides Cecilia.\n\nNoble marriage policy\n\nIn 1483, at the age of ten, she was betrothed to Giovanni Stefano Visconti. The engagement was broken off in 1487 for unknown reasons.\n\nIn early 1489, the 37-year-old Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza made Cecilia, who was only sixteen years old, his mistress. Cecilia then moved into a rural estate in the parish of Nuovo Monasterio. The duke openly supported her and her family. When her brother Sigerio killed a man in a quarrel in 1489 and was to be executed, Ludovico's personal intervention prevented this. Moreover, Cecilia's affair with the Duke of Milan certainly brought further benefits to her family. Finally, in the summer of 1490, Cecilia became pregnant. It was around this time that Leonardo da Vinci completed the painting.\n\nRelationship of three\n\nThe duke's affair was politically sensitive, since Ludovico had already been engaged to Beatrice d'Este (b. 1475), then only five years old, since 1480. She was the daughter of the influential Duke of Ferrara. The marriage took place regardless of the simultaneous pregnancy of Cecilia on 16.01.1491, although the affair of the duke was an open secret. Beatrice d'Este refused to sleep with the Duke as long as he kept a mistress. She gave him an ultimatum and demanded that the affair end. Only a few months after the wedding, on 03.05.1491, Cecilia gave birth to a son, Cesare Sforza, to the Duke.\n\nEven before the birth of the son, Ludovico followed the insistence of his wife Beatrice and he ended the affair. Cecilia had left the court by the end of March 1491. However, the duke remained attached to the mother of his son and continued to support her. He appointed her a husband. The choice fell on Count Ludovico Carminati de Brambilla, called Bergamini, whom she married in 1492. The duke subsequently provided her with the magnificent Palazzo Carmagnola in Milan and a fief in Saronno, so that Cecilia could live the life of a noble lady as the wife of a count. The couple had four children.\n\nCecilia\n\nCecilia must have been very beautiful, her beauty was the subject of numerous contemporary letters and poems.\n\nShe was considered clever and very educated. She spoke fluent Latin, played music, wrote poetry and was a pleasant entertainer. Among other things, she was known for inviting people to salons. There she discussed questions of religion, art and philosophy with high-ranking personalities. Her salons were probably the first of their kind in Europe. She was also active as a patron of writers, such as the novellist Matteo Bandello.\n\nCecilia's former lover, the Duke of Milan was expelled from Milan by the French in 1499, stripped of his power, and died in French captivity in 1508. Their mutual son Cesare pursued an ecclesiastical career, became an abbot, but died at a young age in 1512. Cecilia's husband Ludovico Carminati de Brambilla probably died around 1514, and the fate of their four children together is unknown. Cecilia Gallerani died in 1536 at the age of 63 at her castle in San Giovanni in Croce, about 100km southeast of Milan. The painting was in her possession until her death.\n\nThe mistress Ceciila Gallerani became pregnant by the Duke while the painting was being made. It is therefore worth noting that the ermine has been the guardian animal of pregnant women since ancient times.\n\nThis is due to a legend surrounding the birth of the ancient hero Hercules. The famous Roman poet Ovid (43 BC - 17 AD) tells about it in his main work, the \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nThe ancient legend\n\nZeus, the father of the gods, impregnated the earthly Alcmene by masquerading as her husband.\n\nHis ever-jealous wife Hera took revenge on Alcmene by instructing the goddess of birth, Eileithyia, to squat on her altar and cross her knees so tightly with her arms that this spell would prevent Alcmene from giving birth. After Alkmene had been in labor for seven days and seven nights, her maid Galanthis could no longer bear Alkmene's pain and told the goddess of birth, Eileithyia, to congratulate Alkmene, who had just given birth to a boy. The deceived Eileithyia jumped up in horror, her legs were now no longer crossed and the spell was broken.\n\nAlcmene delivered her son Heracles. The maid Galanthis, laughing loudly because of the successful trick, was shortly after thrown to the ground by the goddess Eileithyia and turned into an ermine as punishment. According to ancient belief, the transformed maiden was now condemned to bear her children through the lying mouth with which she had helped Heracles into the world.\n\nThe tradition of the legend\n\nSince then, in Greek educated circles, the ermine was considered the guardian animal of pregnant women and was supposed to give pregnant women the safest possible delivery. If a woman was in labor, she was handed wet cloths from a bowl with ermine motifs. Wearing an ermine skin on the bare skin was also supposed to protect the woman from the dangers of childbirth.\n\nThe story of a love affair\n\nThe ermine is the central element of the painting, along with Cecilia Gallerani. No doubt it is an allusion to the couple Ludovico and Cecilia. Ludovico had been presented with the Order of the Ermine two years earlier and was given the nickname White Ermine.\n\nFrom Cecilia's surname Gallerani, a pun can be derived with the ancient Greek galê or galéē for weasel.\n\nHowever, these connections would also mean Leonardo did not adopt the ermine into the painting on his own. The circumstances of his noble client forced him to choose this animal.\n\nLeonardo now tells the story of the two lovers in his painting. But he goes beyond that. It will be seen that he abstracts their narrative and uses it to elevate it to the story of any young love. In this way, he manages to create a timeless work that tells a story that is always true, completely independent of the knowledge of the sitter's circumstances. This is what makes the mystique of the painting and fascinates countless viewers to this day.\n\nThe maturity of Cecilia\n\nCecilia wears a necklace of black pearls around her neck. Pearls are created when impure enters a shell. It is held by it and woven around with mother-of-pearl. Then, when the pearl is large enough, the shell opens and presents its beauty. Therefore, since ancient times, pearls were considered a symbol of virtue, but also of fertility.\n\nThe dream of Cecilia\n\nCecilia stands as a young woman in a dark room, alone, almost as if in a dream. As if to calm her fear, a pet in her arms. Her gaze goes into the bright distance. Her gaze seems awake, her expectation of the future clear. But for the moment, she is still surrounded by absolute darkness.\n\nGetting to know each other\n\nA woman in a dark room, alone, with a pet in her arms. She turns towards the place of the stimulus. It is unclear whether the stimulus was a sound or the light, which caught her attention. But in the context of the painting, a hypothesis suggests itself here. It could be Ludovico who enters the room. He opens a door and appears in the light. In her eyes is reflected a person walking down a basement staircase. A bird rises in the background. The scene seems like a liberation.\n\nCecilia is still very young when she is paired with the duke (16 years). Thus Leonardo depicts her in this picture as very young, almost childlike. The oversized ermine reinforces the almost childlike impression, because if it is not too big, she is too small.\n\nCecilia turns away and turns towards. For a playful expression of her insecurity, she holds a pet in front of her belly, her head always curiously fixed forward. Her right hand somehow doesn't seem to fit quite right. It is first too big, then also too tense. It doesn't seem to belong to her. Her left hand doesn't seem to belong to her either.\n\nIf the hands and forearms don't belong to her, both arms seem to come out of the darkness behind her, as if the darkness itself is reaching for her. Ludovico's official epithet was Il Moro, the Black. Paying attention only to her hands, a veritable dance of hands emerges on her body. Sometimes the delicate masculine hand to her right, sometimes the rough hard grasping hand to her left, and then it's her own again. And again not, and the game begins anew.\n\nThe masculine rawness is exaggerated in the figure of the white ermine, which seems to have just torn open Cecilia's blue sleeve with its claw-sharp right hand and now leans triumphantly over her left elbow. The left paw looks down.\n\nIn an elegant upward movement from the left hand holding the pregnant belly over the strangely round belly/back of the ermine to its left paw, the gaze reaches the conspicuous drapery on her left sleeve.\n\nThe sharp-clawed and strong ermine seems to have just torn Cecilia's sleeve open from top to bottom with its right hand and parted it in such a way that the red underneath is now visible, the glimpse bordered by delicate orange hem.\n\nTo the left and right of the apex of the hemmed triangle there is a curious blue drapery, reminiscent in its symmetry of a pair of human eyes. Accordingly, the red triangle below - a wide-open mouth - would be the missing complement of an oversized face screaming to the upper right.\n\nCertainly only vaguely and more a caricature, Leonardo here hints at the horrors of childbirth. That at the end of the birth canal is an open, loud screaming mouth, must be seen before the ancient superstition that stoats give birth to your children from the mouth. The humorous cartoon thus refers to this ancient legend.\n\nThe child in the arms\n\nLeonardo ends the narrative of the love affair with the depiction of the proud mother Cecilia. If the ermine is mentally faded out and attention is paid only to the posture of the hands, this corresponds to that of a mother carrying her child in front of her. The head of the child at her left breast.\n\nIt fits then also that the head of the ermine merges in color into the décolleté of the lady. The head of the ermine tapering to the right can be seen as a breast bared for nursing the child #, as shown in the example of the Madonnas above.\n\nConclusion on the history of the love affair\n\nIt could be shown that Leonardo directs the viewer's gaze via flaws and aesthetic conspicuities, and combines them in their entirety to form a consistent whole. The painting tells of Cecilia's young love life, beginning with her maturity, her dream of love, meeting Ludovico, their lovemaking, Cecilia's pregnancy, the birth that follows, and finally her happiness as a young mother.\n\nLeonardo has painted a work about love, even more: about any love. Viewers do not need to know who is shown to understand the atmosphere of the painting. Every person can intuitively grasp what is shown, without concretely knowing what is fascinating here.\n\nThe feat that Leonardo achieved here was to create a work that was so understandable in its time and for the clients that they could identify with it. But also so that following generations, who no longer know their story, could understand the pictorial narrative: the love of a young woman and a man.\n\nAnd so it happened that Leonardo called the lady's face the dungeon of love. The innermost dungeon is her unrequited love, her body itself, the outermost her obligations as a young mother. The dungeons in between accordingly.\n\nThe painting contains some geometric features. Geometry not only adds an artistic expression. It is also part of the self-image of Leonardo da Vinci, who, as an astronomer and earth surveyor, was looking for a divine harmony. He assumed this to be in whole-number ratios in nature, but also in mathematical constants, such as the golden ratio. Leonardo's countless geometric drawings on his sketch sheets are famous, as are his illustrations of three-dimensional geometric objects for the mathematician Luca Pacioli's book on the golden section.\n\nThe painting contains representational errors and conspicuous features that have a geometric character\n\nthe strictly formed hair emphasizes the middle parting strikingly in one point\n\nher plain black headband is too straight for a band around her round head\n\nthe golden headband appears parallel to the black headband and curved only towards the edge\n\nthe stoat's eyes and right ear appear arranged in an equilateral triangle\n\nI The look of the ermine\n\nLeonardo paints an ermine looking happily at onlookers, which is made clear by the construction lines.\n\nthe golden section of the picture width runs through the left eye of the ermine (orange line)\n\nthe golden section of the image height runs through the right eye of the ermine (orange line)\n\nthe central perpendicular of the image width passes through the right ear of the ermine (red line)\n\nthe stoat's right eye is exactly in the middle of the central vertical line (red) and the golden section of the image width (orange line)\n\nthe three points can be connected to an isosceles triangle (green triangle). The interior angles are 120° and twice 30°.\n\nWith this knowledge, the three points now transform into a second version superimposed on the original face of the ermine, which smilingly looks directly at the viewer (I + mouseover). This exemplifies the knowing and humorous spirit typical of Leonardo's painting, with which he conceived his works.\n\nThe ermine is the guardian animal of pregnancy. A smiling ermine indicates a happy birth.\n\nII The look of Cecilia\n\nWith the knowledge of the stoat's face, the face of Cecilia is now examined.\n\nBounded by the golden section of the picture's height (orange line) and the central perpendicular (red line), a square spans the right edge of the picture (red cross line). The upper line of the square runs through both eyes of Cecilia\n\nfrom Cecilia's middle vertex a 45° angle meets both eyes (white lines)\n\nfrom the just drawn square a rectangle can be drawn upwards to the black headband. This has the aspect ratio of 4:3 and its lower edge is exactly at 3/4 of the image height\n\nfrom the height of its black headband a line can be drawn downwards to the paw of the ermine, which is also divided by the horizontal golden section in the golden ratio (yellow line)\n\nThe stoat's right paw rests on a 45° angle (green triangle) which is bounded on the left by the center of the image and on the right by the golden section. It is the same triangle that appeared above her face (green triangles).\n\nThe right paw of the ermine, here as the heraldic animal of Duke Ludovico, resting on the lower triangle, stands in the masculine-erotic context (see \"An Act of Love\"). The upper triangle is in the context of Cecilia's gaze. The fact that both triangles are approximately equal in size, that is, harmonious, allows the interpretation that the amorous relationship of the two is happy at the time of the painting's creation.\n\nIII The House of Santa Claus\n\nKnown today mainly as a children's game, the House of Santa Claus is one of the simplest examples of connecting points as efficiently as possible by routes, here there are five points. The problem can quickly become very complex as the number of points increases and the positions change. The famous mathematician Leonhard Euler first studied the problem in more detail in the 18th century (Königsberg bridge problem).\n\nUntil today, the so-called graph theory is a subfield of discrete mathematics or theoretical computer science. If, for example, Google Maps suggests the fastest way from point A to B, the program makes use, among other things, of the findings of graph theory.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci must have also dealt with the question about 200 years before Euler, which manifests itself in the pictorial geometry of the lady with the ermine.\n\nFrom Cecilia's right eye, the vertical center of the picture, a 22.5° angle leads to the point where the vertical golden section meets the golden headband (green lines). The 22.5° angle is the center angle of a regular hexagon\n\nlikewise, from the base of her left eye, a 22.5° angle leads to the intersection of the golden headband and the central vertical line\n\nFrom the intersection of the two lines an angle of exactly 72° (see golden section) can be drawn to the already known point of the central vertex, the center angle of a regular 5-corner (dark blue line)\n\nThe angles from the golden headband to the point of the central vertex are also not chosen at random, they are counterclockwise starting from the lower left and are successively 45°, 75° and 60°. The result is the triangle that Leonardo always staged in all his portraits starting from the middle parting (green area), e.g. in the Belle Ferroniere, John the Baptist or the Mona Lisa\n\nIn view of the increasing complexity of the geometric dependencies in Leonardo's later works, the assumption thus suggests itself that the Lady with the Ermine would be the prelude to a three-part series of portraits that would conclude with the Mona Lisa. Since only a few of the paintings still attributed to Leonardo today have a consistent geometric scheme in this respect, this is the key to further narrowing down the attributions to Leonardo.\n\nConversely, however, this should not mean that a complex pictorial geometry inevitably proves an authorship by Leonardo, as the example of the Portrait of Ginevra de' Benci makes clear. The painting is said to have been created about 15 years before the Lady with the Ermine, but it is much more complex in terms of pictorial construction. The numerous and clearly recognizable double images also contribute to this impression. However, especially by analyzing the geometry of the picture, reasonable doubts arise that it is a work by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nAgainst this background, it is a mistake to disregard the geometry in Leonardo's paintings when discussing the authenticity of his paintings. Leonardo's universal understanding of geometry was always an integral part of his works, as will be evident in all of his paintings discussed here.\n\nThe Lady with the Ermine is Leonardo's least complex work in this regard, and must therefore be considered the beginning of a cycle of paintings characterized by the fact that the paintings were interwoven through geometric symbolism.\n\nLeonardo was a vegetarian and saw nature first in everything. Depriving an animal of its freedom and caging it for his own pleasure must have seemed deeply alienating to him.\n\nThe domestic animal husbandry\n\nErmines feed mainly on small rodents. As a result, people at the time of Leonardo da Vinci often kept them as mouse hunters. To fight plagues of mice with cats appeared in Europe only later.\n\nAbout the quite practical problems of a domestic animal attitude it gives references, which should let think whether the creatures of nature should not be better in freedom, instead of robbing these e.g. because of their soft fur of their freedom. Particularly since it is nevertheless very laborious to hold the creatures striving by nature for freedom. The weasel escaping from the lady's firm grip, its tense right paw already ready to jump and its hind legs also eluding the lady's grip, indicate the animal's urge for freedom.\n\nLeonardo shows in the left sleeve (orange hem) how sharp-clawed a pet can be, which seems to have just torn open the blue sleeve of the dress from top to bottom with its right paw, revealing the red fabric underneath.\n\nAlso the biting instinct of the animal, is indicated by dark spots around its mouth. They could be from coagulated blood from a previous bite by the predator.\n\nIn addition, the lady's nose is located right above the stoat's nose. An indication of the strong body odor of the stoats.\n\nOriginally the picture was created without an ermine, in a second step a gray marten-like animal was placed in the lady's arms, and finally the third version with the oversized ermine, which can be seen today, was created from this.\n\nIt is therefore conceivable that the duke was originally only interested in having Cecilia portrayed. When she became pregnant while working on the painting, Leonardo added a weasel-like creature. The weasel has been the guardian animal of pregnant women since ancient times. Probably at the Duke's request, the weasel was then reworked into an oversized and muscular ermine in winter fur. The duke's nickname was \"White Ermine\".\n\nIn the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan\n\nThe painting remained in the possession of Cecilia Gallerani until she died in 1536. After her death, the painting initially remained in Milan. As late as the eighteenth century, Carlo Amoretti, the librarian of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, wrote that it was there as part of the collection of the Marchese of Bonasana.\n\nIn the possession of the Polish princely family Czartoryski\n\nAround 1800, the Polish prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski bought the painting during a trip to Italy and gave it to his mother Izabela Czartoryska. She built up an art collection and, by making comparisons, mistakenly came to the conclusion that the Lady with an Ermine and the Belle Ferroniere depicted the same people. As a result, she had an inscription placed in the upper left corner of the painting.\n\nLA BELE FERONIERE\n\nLEONARD DAWINCI\n\nLeonard Dawinci is the Polish spelling of Leonardo da Vinci. She probably had other adjustments made: Chain, headband and decorations of the dress were painted over with stronger colors. Also contours of the nose, hair strands and pupils. In addition, she received some rouge on the cheeks. She may also have had the original light bluish gradient in the background painted over into a monochrome black.\n\nChanging whereabouts\n\nThe portrait was then located in the \"Gothic Cottage\" in the Czartoryski residence in Puławy (Poland). Because of a Russian-Polish war, the princely family fled to Paris in 1831. The painting was officially considered lost, but it was in the noble Lambert Hotel in Paris, where the family took up quarters. Around 1871 the Czartoryski family returned to Krakow from exile in Paris, and with them the Lady with the Ermine. In 1876 the painting was exhibited publicly for the first time in the Czartoryski Museum in Krakow.\n\nAfter the defeat of Poland in World War II, the painting was confiscated in 1939 and moved to the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum in Berlin (now the Bode-Museum). The painting was then to be exhibited with many other paintings confiscated by the Germans in the planned Führer Museum in Linz. However, the German Governor General of Poland, Hans Frank, came into possession of the painting in 1940 and then had the painting transferred to his residence, the Wawel Castle in the center of Krakow.\n\nWhen Hans Frank fled to his country home in Bavaria towards the end of the war, he took it with him to where the painting was found by the Americans in 1945.\n\nIn the possession of the Polish state\n\nThe Americans brought it back to Krakow. Today it is in the possession of the Polish state and is exhibited in the Czartoryski Museum in Krakow."
