        "text": "A female author who wrote under a male penname, Alice Mary Norton was the first woman to be inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. Her books usually follow the hero’s journey, in which an “outsider” realizes their full potential.\n\nNorton's longest running series, Witch World, the first of which was published in 1963, helped put her on the map as a science fiction author, and secured her first Hugo Award nomination.\n\nRELATED: Andre Norton Books Everyone Should Read\n\nGolden age of sci-fi author Leigh Brackett is often referred to as “the queen of space opera” for her pulp stories about the intergalactic adventures of Eric John Stark. She also won a Retro Hugo for The Nemesis from Terra, a swashbuckling story of Martian power struggles.\n\nBrackett wrote numerous critically-acclaimed screenplays, and contributed to the screenplay for the Hugo Award-winning landmark movie The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nRELATED: 20 Must-Read Space Opera Books\n\nOn her 40th birthday, actress and author Madeleine L’Engle, disheartened by the numerous writing rejections she had received, resolved to give up writing. But she found it impossible to stop telling stories, and four years later—after 30 rejections—her classic children’s novel A Wrinkle in Time was published in 1962.\n\nThe novel, which follows a young, bookish girl searching for her missing scientist father, was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1963. It was adapted into a film in 2018, and remains a beloved novel. L’Engle went on to publish many other acclaimed books, many of which married her interest in hard science and spiritualism.\n\nThe late Anne McCaffrey broke ground not just for women in sci-fi, but for the genre overall. In 1978, McCaffrey’s novel The White Dragon was the first sci-fi book to land on the New York Times bestseller list. In 1968, she became the first-ever woman to win a Hugo Award, and then in 1969 the first woman to ever win a Nebula Award.\n\nMcCaffrey was best known for her science fantasy Dragonriders of Pern series, which comprises more than 23 novels and has been continued by McCaffrey’s son Todd following the author’s death. Dragonflight introduces the unforgettable world of Pern, a planet colonized by people. To survive against the deadly Thread in this alien new world, humans must develop a bond with the telepathic dragons of Pern.\n\nIn addition to the Dragonriders of Pern series, McCaffrey wrote numerous other series that blurred the line between science fiction and fantasy, including the Acorna series and the Crystal series.\n\nMcCaffrey passed away in 2011 at age 85, six years after having been named the 22nd annual Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.\n\nRELATED: 14 Best Dragon Books in Fantasy Fiction\n\nThe late Le Guin had an immense impact on the science fiction and fantasy genre throughout her career.\n\nAn influencer of many prolific writers, she herself also won the Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Locus Award, and World Fantasy Award multiple times. Additionally, she was one of the only female authors to be a Grand Master of Science Fiction. Le Guin’s work is sometimes classified as soft science fiction, due to her exploration of social and psychological identity within her books. However, Le Guin rejected this classification.\n\nLe Guin criticized the assumption of some that science fiction characters should be white, and strived to write characters as diverse as the world around us. A Wizard of Earthsea follows Ged, a young magician seeking to control his power after he releases a shadow creature who continues to pursue Ged in hopes of possessing him.\n\nRELATED: What Every Fantasy Writer Can Learn From Earthsea\n\nJane Yolen has won many awards for her work, including the 1987 Special World Fantasy Award (for Favorite Folktales From Around the World); the 1999 Nebula Award for Novelette (for “Lost Girls”); and the 2009 World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nShe’s also written many children’s books, the first of which was published when she was just 22 years old. Her fantasy book Sister Light, Sister Dark (which is the first in The Great Alta Saga) takes place in a world without men and features Jenna, a warrior, and her twin Skada, who only emerges in darkness. Together, this powerful duo is prophesied to remake the world.\n\nRELATED: Jane Yolen on Why It's Important to Just 'Write the Damn Book'\n\nMargaret Atwood is one of the most well-known writers out there. She often focuses her books around women dominated by a patriarchal society.\n\nOne of Atwood’s most famous works, The Handmaid’s Tale, has recently resurged in popularity due to the television adaptation and the current political climate—which some have compared to the dystopian setting of Atwood’s novel.\n\nWinner of the Arthur C. Clarke Award and a five-time Booker Prize finalist, Atwood tends to write dystopian speculative fiction. The Handmaid’s Tale follows the story of Offred, a young woman living in the military dictatorship of the Republic of Gilead following the collapse of the United States. Offred is a handmaid, the term for a slave who is forced to reproduce with men who have sterile wives.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the name: James Tiptree Jr. is actually a pen name for Alice Bradley Sheldon. The author, who notably broke into a male-dominated genre, kept her true identity under wraps for ten years.\n\nThough her actual name was eventually revealed, she continued to write under the pseudonym. Her work often combined elements of the more technology-focused hard science fiction with that of softer psychological-based science fiction.\n\nThough her tone could vary, the constant theme of feminism was always present. Her stories often pointed out the violence and degradations women experience in a male-dominated society, and featured determined, passionate, wholly three-dimensional women.\n\nWhile her career was heavily focused on short stories, she did write a few novels, including Brightness Falls from the Air, which tells the captivating story of 16 humans who gather on an isolated planet to witness the destruction of a star. As their motives for being there become apparent, the book takes on the tone of a murder mystery.\n\nRELATED: 50 of the Best Science Fiction Books Ever Written\n\nThe author of feminist literary criticism, in addition to science fiction and fantasy, Joanna Russ influenced readers throughout her life since she was first noticed in the late 1960s.\n\nDuring her career, she challenged the male dominated world of science fiction—both in authors and audience. She published And Chaos Died in 1970, which tells of an overpopulated planet where nature scarcely exists and creativity and individualism are suppressed. But there are other ways of life out there. And as the novel progresses, they come into conflict.\n\nThe late Vonda N. McIntyre won the first of her three Nebula Awards in 1973, for her novelette “Of Mist, and Grass, and Sand.” The biologist went on to receive numerous awards for her novels Dreamsnake, The King’s Daughter (originally titled The Moon and the Sun), and Little Faces, and also gained a dedicated fandom as a writer of Star Trek novels.\n\nIn addition to the acclaim she won for her own novels, McIntyre shaped the speculative fiction community by co-founding the Clarion West Writer’s Workshop in 1971.\n\nHer novel The King’s Daughter, an alternate history set in the 17th century, gained new readers in 2022 after the release of a film adaptation starring Pierce Brosnan.\n\nTanith Lee was a sci-fi, fantasy, and horror writer who wrote over 90 novels. The first woman to win the British Fantasy Award for her novel Death’s Master in 1980, Lee wrote several popular series—focusing on weaving themes of feminism and sexuality into fantasy.\n\nThe first book in her popular The Secret Books of Paradys series, The Book of the Damned, is set in an alternative Paris and consists of three novellas. Dealing with everything from vampires to violence and abuse, Lee’s work examines real-life issues faced by women through a fantasy lens.\n\nRELATED: 18 Bloody Good Vampire Books\n\nIf you’re a fan of science fiction, then it’s unlikely you haven’t heard of this influential author—who’s also won multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, and was the first science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Fellowship (also known as the \"Genius Grant\").\n\nHer bestselling novel, Kindred, follows young African-American writer, Dana, as she is transported between her present (1976 Los Angeles) and the past (a pre-Civil War plantation in Maryland). The novel examines race and gender issues, while also taking a close look at slavery and how it impacts modern society.\n\nBut that’s not the only influential novel Butler’s put her name to. While there are countless books to choose from, the Earthseed series (which includes Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents) is particularly relevant in today’s climate, as protagonist Lauren Olamina flees an evil dystopian leader, settling a new community in Northern California.\n\nLauren's strength and endurance through countless odds, as well as her leadership abilities, make her a force to be reckoned with.\n\nRelated: Re-Read - Octavia Butler’s “Parable” Series\n\nFantasy and horror author Jessica Amanda Salmonson is the author of several novels and short story collections.\n\nIn addition to writing, Salmonson has also edited several collections—usually containing weird tales and ghost stories. Her fantasy anthology Amazons!, which she contributed to as well as edited, won the World Fantasy Award in 1980, and her Tomoe Gozen trilogy (later retitled to The Disfavored Hero) tells the story of an alternate feudal Japan and a young woman, Tomoe Gozen, who is a samurai of incredible skill.\n\nTomoe Gozen is just one example of the powerful female characters that populate Salmonson's work.\n\nRelated: 9 Sagas to Keep You Satisfied Until The Winds of Winter Release Date\n\nCo-founder of the James Tiptree Jr. Award (now known as the Otherwise Award), Pat Murphy is the author of award-winning science fiction and fantasy.\n\nRecipient of the Nebula Award, Philip K. Dick Award, and World Fantasy Award, Murphy’s novels and short stories immerse readers into new worlds and introduce them to strong, intelligent women.\n\nHer Nebula Award-winning novel, The Falling Woman, follows Elizabeth Butler—an archeologist in Yucatán who can communicate with the ghosts of the men and women who once lived on the sites she and her colleagues are excavating.\n\nIn addition to fiction, Murphy has also worked at Exploratorium, San Francisco’s museum of science, art, and human perception, where she has published non-fiction science books.\n\nLisa Goldstein’s first and National Book Award-winning novel, The Red Magician, helped put her on the map as a fantasy and science fiction author.\n\nHer popular novel takes place during the Holocaust, and tells the story of Kicsi—a young, Jewish girl who discovers the power of magic in dark times. Her books have been nominated for Nebula, Hugo, and World Fantasy Awards, and often incorporate historical events with a fantasy spin.\n\nRELATED: 50 of the Best Fantasy Books Ever Written\n\nMargaret Astrid Lindholm writes fantasy under the pseudonym Robin Hobb. And if you love epic fantasy, then you owe it to yourself to explore Hobb’s series, which have been praised by George R.R. Martin himself.\n\nHobb has written several trilogies set in the Realm of the Elderlings world, including the Farseer Trilogy, the Liveship Traders Trilogy, and the Tawny Trilogy. Her beloved world is sprawling and detailed, but don’t let that intimidate you — most books in her oeuvre are an accessible adventure even if you haven’t read previous novels in the series.\n\nTamora Pierce is beloved for her YA epic fantasy series, most of which are set in the Tortall universe. Her books are resplendent with talking animals, compelling magical systems, female warriors, and just enough romance.\n\nPierce’s most iconic series might be the Lioness Quartet, which follows a young girl named Alanna who disguises herself as a boy to train as a knight of Tortall. Alanna will soon find a whole new generation of fans, as Pierce’s classic book series is finally getting the TV adaptation it deserves.\n\nNalo Hopkinson is the winner of a John W. Campbell Award, a Locus Award, and a World Fantasy Award, among numerous other accolades. In 2020, she was also named the 37th Damon Knight Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.\n\nThis Canadian speculative fiction author was born in Jamaica, and now resides in California. Hopkinson’s novels and short fiction are full of vivid and unforgettable imagery often inspired by Caribbean folklore and culture, and exploring themes of intersectional feminism.\n\nHopkinson’s novel The Salt Roads was a 2004 Nebula Awards finalist. The book begins in 1804, when a group of women — led by a lesbian spiritual leader and midwife — evoke the goddess Ezili during a funeral. Ezili, the deity of romance and sexual attraction, then visits women across the globe and throughout time, transforming their journey and her own.\n\nRELATED: 9 Influential LGBTQ Sci-Fi and Fantasy Authors\n\nIf you’re looking for a powerful, female-driven story, look no further than Kameron Hurley’s Bel Dame Apocrypha series.\n\nThe books follow Nyx, a former government assassin entangled in a never-ending war. It’s rooted in a world of science fiction, and challenges societal roles—specifically that of women.
