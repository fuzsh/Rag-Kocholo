Which means that if I'm reading a book I real like before bed, I end up staying up past my bed time instead of falling asleep. One solution is to read non-fiction before bed. The other solution is to read short story anthologies. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of high quality anthologies out there. At least, not enough to keep up with the rate at which I can read.\n\nSo I decided to go back and reread Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's fantasy anthology Snow White, Blood Red. This book has a whole bunch of things going for it at once: it's edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling; it's got stories by Neil Gaiman and Charles de Lint; and the stories are retellings or reinventions of folk and fairy tales. Mostly fairy tales in this book.\n\nPlus, a gorgeous cover by Thomas Canty.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with folk tales and fairy tales, many of the original tales--before they got cleaned up and given to kids--were filled with sex, (in addition to the casual violence of people getting eyes poked out or chopping off bits of feet or being shoved into ovens.)\n\nIn other words, these are not stories for children.\n\nLike a Red, Red Rose by Susan Wade\n\nThe Moon is Drowning While I Sleep by Charles de Lint\n\nThe Frog Prince by Gahan Wilson\n\nStalking Beans by Nancy Kress\n\nSnowbyDrop by Tanith Lee\n\nLittle Red by Wendy Wheeler\n\nI Shall Do Thee Mischief in the Wood by Kathe Koja\n\nThe Root of the Matter by Gregory Frost\n\nThe Princess in the Tower by Elizabeth A. Lynn\n\nPersimmon by Harvey Jacobs\n\nLittle Poucet by Steve Rasnic Tem\n\nThe Changelings by Melanie Tem\n\nThe Springfield Swans by Caroline Stevermer and Ryan Edmonds\n\nTroll Bridge by Neil Gaiman\n\nA Sound, Like Angels Singing by Leonard Rysdyk\n\nPuss by Esther M. Friesner\n\nThe Glass Casket by Jack Dann\n\nKnives by Jane Yolen\n\nThe Snow Queen by Patricia A. McKillip\n\nBreadcrumbs and Stones by Lisa Goldstein\n\nAlso, the stories I liked less tended towards horror. This book is a collection of fantasy and horror (as are many Ellen Datlow-Terri Windling anthologies) so I expected that there were going to be at least one or two stories that I don't care for. So it didn't really bother me.\n\nAs best I can tell, this anthology is still available, so if you like short stories, this is an anthology you won't want to miss. However, if you like anthologies, this is probably one you already have sitting on your shelves.\n\nPublished by Harper Collins\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nRuby Slippers, Golden Tears (1995) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nRuby Slippers by Susan Wade\n\nThe Beast by Tanith Lee\n\nMasterpiece by Garry Kilworth\n\nSummer Wind by Nancy Kress\n\nThis Century of Sleep, or Briar Rose Beneath the Sea by Farida S.

The problem of course, is finding an author who is good at translating stories from an oral tradition into something that works well written.\n\nThere's something wonderful about a well-told short story, and I think that the best short stories in the world are folk and fairy tales.\n\nEllen Datlow and Terri Windling are very good at finding authors who can take these stories and retell them, and they always put together wonderful anthologies. They brought together thirteen writers for this collection of retold fairy tales.\n\nThe Months of Manhattan by Delia Sherman\n\nCinder Elephant by Jane Yolen\n\nInstructions by Neil Gaiman\n\nMrs Big: \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" Retold by Michael Cadnum\n\nFalada: The Goose Girls Horse by Nancy Farmer\n\nA Wolf at the Door by Tanith Lee\n\nAli Baba and the Forty Aliens by Janeen Webb\n\nSwans by Kelly Link\n\nThe Kingdom of Melting Glances by Katherine Vaz\n\nHansel's Eyes by Garth Nix\n\nBecoming Charise by Kathe Koja\n\nThe Seven Stage a Comeback by Gergory Maguire\n\nThe Twelve Dancing Princesses by Patricia A.

For me the collection started out okay, and then got better and better the more I read.\n\nNot that I think the purpose of these stories is necessarily to scare us, as much as it is to make us pay attention to what is happening around us.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nThe Green Man : Tales from the Mythic Forest (2002) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nGoing Wodwo (poem) by Neil Gaiman\n\nGrand Central Park by Delia Sherman\n\nDaphne by Michael Cadnum\n\nSomewhere in My Mind There is a Painting Box by Charles de Lint\n\nAmong the Leaves So Green by Tanith Lee\n\nSong of the Cailleach Bheur (poem) by Jane Yolen\n\nHunter's Moon by Patricia A.

However, the stories are so well written that adults should find them just as appealing. If you like folk and fairy tales, I highly recommend this collection.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nYear's Best Fantasy 3 (2003) edited by David G.

Usually very good. This volume however, has the added bonus of poems by both Charles de Lint and Neil Gaiman.\n\nNeedless to say I snatched it up--even thought it was in hardback--when I came across it.\n\nThese faery tales are based not upon the fairies of Disney but upon the faery of folktales. As they say in the introduction:\n\nIn this book about our good neighbors, we've asked a number of our favorite writers to travel into the Twilight Realm (an ancient name for the land of Faerie) and to bring back stories of faeries and the hapless mortals who cross their path. \"No butterfly-winged sprites,\" we pleaded. \"Read the old folktales, journey farther afield, find some of the less explored paths through the Realm.\n\nIt would be hard for me not to love this book.\n\nThe Boys of Goose Hill by Charles de Lint\n\nCatnyp by Delia Sherman\n\nElvenbrood by Tanith Lee\n\nYour Garnet Eyes by Katherine Vaz\n\nTengu Mountain by Gregory Frost\n\nThe Faery Handbag by Kelly Link\n\nThe Price of Glamour by Steve Berman\n\nThe Night Market by Holly Black\n\nNever Never by Bruce Glassco\n\nScreaming for Aferies by Ellen Steiber\n\nImmersed in Matter by Nina Kiriki Hoffman\n\nUndine by Patricia A.

But I hardly expected anything less.\n\nPublished by Viking\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nEmerald Magic (2004) edited by Andrew M. Greely\n\nThis book first caught my eye because I didn't expect to see Andrew Greeley's name in the fantasy section. Then I looked at the list of authors who wrote in this anthology: Charles de Lint, Diane Duane, Elizabeth Haydon, Morgan Llywelyn, Judith Tarr, Peter Tremayne, Jane Yolen. Even one of those names would have been enough inducement for me to pick up the book--but all those? And more!\n\nIrish mythology, folktales, and fantasy. What more could I want?\n\nEvery story I read was excellent, although I did skip L.E. Modesitt Jr's science fiction story (I am rarely in the mood for science fiction.)\n\nHerself by Diane Duane\n\nSpeir-Bhan by Tanith Lee\n\nTroubles by Jane Yolen and Adam Stemple\n\nThe Hermit and the Sidhe by Judith Tarr\n\nThe Merrow by Elizabeth Haydon\n\nThe Butter Spirit's Tithe by Charles de Lint\n\nBanshee by Ray Bardbury\n\nPeace in Heaven by Andrew Greeley\n\nThe Lady in Grey by Jane Lindskold\n\nA Drop of Something Special in the Blood by Fred Saberhagen\n\nFor the Blood Is the Life by Peter Tremayne\n\nLong the Clouds Are Over Me Tonight by Cecilia Dart-Thornton\n\nThe Swan Pilot by L.E.

Lansdale\n\nWinter Moon (2005) Mercedes Lackey, Tanith Lee, & C.E. Murphy\n\nWinter Moon contains three novellas all centered around the moon:\n\nMoontide by Mercedes Lackey\n\nThe Heart of the Moon by Tanith Lee\n\nBanshee Cries by C.E. Murphy\n\nMoontide and Heart of the Moon are traditional fantasies, while Banshee Cries is an urban fantasy set in the modern world where magic--or power--is just out of the sight of most people.\n\nIn Tanith Lee's The Heart of the Moon, Clirando has been betrayed by her lover and the woman she considers her sister. Her reaction to the events--and the result of those events--cause her to be sent to the Moon Isle for the Seven Nights.\n\nI initially didn't care much for this story. I hate the main characters name--I kept reading Cilantro--and I just didn't care much about her. But eventually the story drew me, and although I never developed much of a liking for Clirando, I did like the characters she met, and her adventures were intriguing. And although this was supposed to be a romance, the romance portion of the story was a problem for me. I just didn't buy that this bitter woman could so easily fall in love. But the fantasy part of the story was interesting enough that I could ignore the mushy bits.\n\nThe only thing I find it important to mention is that these three stories are quite different. They are a good overview of the scope of the Luna line, but the thing holding this collection of novellas together is the theme of the winter moon. Not a similarity in theme or style.\n\nIf you have not read a Luna book before, I would highly recommend Winter Moon. This stories in this book are a good overview of the variety in the Luna line, and although not everyone will enjoy all three stories, there is such a variety in these stories that most readers should find something here to enjoy.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nYear's Best Fantasy 5 (2005) edited by David G.

Greenberg & Darrell Schweitzer\n\nI love anthologies. Though I have to admit that with the way paranormal romance has taken off, the ratio of wheat to chaff has been unfavorable for me. However, Carrie Vaughn and Peter S. Beagle were pretty compelling reasons to get this anthology.\n\nThe Truth about Werewolves by Lisa Tuttle\n\nInnocent by Gene Wolfe\n\nKitty Learns the Ropes by Carrie Vaughn\n\nNo Children, No Pets by Esther M. Friesner\n\nSea Warg by Tanith Lee\n\nCountry Mothers' Sons by Holly Phillips\n\nA Most Unusual Greyhound by Mike Resnick\n\nThe Bitch by P.D.

Beagle\n\nAlthough there were several stories I didn't particularly like, but all in all, the stories that were good were very good, and well worth the price of the anthology.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nVampires: The Recent Undead (2010) edited by Paula Guran\n\n\"The Coldest Girl in Coldtown\" by Holly Black\n\n\"This Is Now\" by Michael Marshall Smith\n\n\"Sisters\" by Charles de Lint\n\n\"The Screaming\" by J.A.

Kiernan\n\n\"Twilight States\" by Albert Cowdrey\n\n\"To the Moment\" by Nisi Shawl\n\n\"Castle in the Desert: Anno Dracula 1977? by Kim Newman\n\n\"Vampires in the Lemon Grove\" by Karen Russell\n\n\"Vampires Anonymous\" by Nancy Kilpatrick\n\n\"The Wide, Carnivorous Sky\" by John Langan\n\nIt has taken me an almost embarrassingly long time to finish this. How long you ask? I purchased it a couple months after it was published–that long ago.\n\nThe problem is I hit a point where I wasn't interested in a story, and instead of just skipping to the next story, I put the whole thing down. I know, rookie mistake. (But you'll see I made it several times, so I decided to just finish off these anthologies, and if I didn't like a story? SKIP.)\n\n\"La Vampiresse\" by Tanith Lee\n\n\"Madame Chaikassia.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said. \"At last. One who knows how to say my name.\"\n\nNaturally he knew. He had known from the day he saw her in the interview on TV. Rather as he had seen the actress Bette Davis in an interview years before and she had been asked how her first name was pronounced. So that he therefore knew it was not pronounced, as most persons now did, in the French way, Bett, but—for he had heard the actress herself reply—as Betty. And in the same way he knew the female being before him now did not pronounce her name as so many did: not Che´-kasee-ah, but Ch´-high-kazya.\n\nThis story was both lovely and terribly sad.\n\nSo, it was an uneven anthology for me, but there were some very good stories that are well-worth the price of the anthology.\n\nPublished by Prime Books\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nTeeth: Vampire Tales (2011) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nThis is an Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling anthology, so as always, there are fascinating bits of folklore.\n\nRice, not garlic, was the most effective means of keeping Chinese vampires at bay, for they had a strange compulsion to count. Throwing rice at the ghost compelled it to stop; it would not move again until each grain was counted.\n\n\"Things to Know About Being Dead\" by Genevieve Valentine\n\n\"All Smiles\" by Steve Berman\n\n\"Gap Year\" by Christopher Barzak\n\n\"Bloody Sunrise\" by Neil Gaiman\n\n\"Flying\" by Delia Sherman\n\n\"Vampire Weather\" by Garth Nix\n\n\"Late Bloomer\" by Suzy McKee Charnas\n\n\"The List of Definite Endings\" by Kaaron Warren\n\n\"Best Friends Forever\" by Cecil Castellucci\n\n\"Sit the Dead\" by Jeffrey Ford\n\n\"Sunbleached\" by Nathan Ballingrud\n\n\"Baby\" by Kathe Koja\n\n\"In the Future When All's Well\" by Catherynne M. Valente\n\n\"Transition\" by Melissa Marr\n\n\"History\" by Ellen Kushner\n\n\"The Perfect Dinner Party\" by Cassandra Clare & Holly Black\n\n\"Slice of Life\" by Lucius Shepard\n\n\"My Generation\" by Emma Bull\n\n\"Why Light?\" by Tanith Lee\n\n\"Why Light?\" by Tanith Lee is the final story, and one I particularly liked. These vampires are born and not made, but different traits have different strengths.\n\nAs expected, this was a very good anthology, and although I didn't like the horror or the poetry, that's a failing of mine, not the anthology.\n\nPublished by Harper Collins\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nUnder My Hat: Tales from the Cauldron (2012) edited by Jonathan Strahan\n\nThis is a lovely YA anthology, with some amazing stories by some of my favorite authors. I didn't love all the stories, but none of them were bad. The theme is young witches coming of age, but the stories are far greater than that.\n\nStray Magic by Diana Peterfreund\n\nPayment Due by Frances Hardinge\n\nA Handful of Ashes by Garth Nix\n\nLittle Gods by Holly Black\n\nBarrio Girls by Charles de Lint\n\nFelidis by Tanith Lee\n\nWitch Work by Neil Gaiman (poem)\n\nThe Education of a Witch by Ellen Klages\n\nThe Threefold World by Ellen Kushner\n\nThe Witch in the Wood by Delia Sherman\n\nWhich Witch by Patricia A. McKillip\n\nThe Carved Forest by Tim Pratt\n\nBurning Castles by M. Rickert\n\nThe Stone Witch by Isobelle Carmody\n\nAndersen's Witch by Jane Yolen\n\nB Is for Bigfoot by Jim Butcher\n\nGreat-Grandmother in the Cellar by Peter S. Beagle\n\nCrow and Caper, Caper and Crow by Margo Lanagan\n\n\"Felidis\" by Tanith Lee had several interesting twists, but the best part was the cat woman. I didn't have tons of sympathy for the main character, but very much enjoyed Felidis.\n\nPublished by Random House\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nQueen Victoria's Book of Spells: An Anthology of Gaslamp Fantasy (2013) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\n\"Queen Victoria's Book of Spells\" by Delia Sherman\n\n\"The Fairy Enterprise\" by Jeffrey Ford\n\n\"From the Catalogue of the Pavilion of the Uncanny and Marvellous, Scheduled for Premiere at the Great Exhibition (Before the Fire)\" by Genevieve Valentine\n\n\"The Memory Book by Maureen McHugh\n\n\"La Reine d'Enfer by Kathe Koja\n\n\"For the Briar Rose\" by Elizabeth Wein\n\n\"The Governess\" by Elizabeth Bear\n\n\"Smithfield\" by James P. Blaylock\n\n\"The Unwanted Women of Surrey\" by Kaaron Warren\n\n\"Charged\" by Leanna Renee Hieber\n\n\"Mr. Splitfoot\" by Dale Bailey\n\n\"Phosphorus\" by Veronica Schanoes\n\n\"We Without Us Were Shadows\" by Catherynne M. Valente\n\n\"The Vital Importance of the Superficial\" by Ellen Kushner and Caroline Stevermer\n\n\"The Jewel in the Toad Queen's Crown\" by Jane Yolen\n\n\"A Few Twigs He Left Behind\" by Gregory Maguire\n\n\"Their Monstrous Minds\" by Tanith Lee\n\n\"Estella Saves the Village\" by Theodora Goss\n\nI love anthologies and I love historical fiction. So this should have been an automatic win for me.\n\nInstead it was a two-plus year slog that I finally forced myself to finish.\n\nPublished by Tor"
