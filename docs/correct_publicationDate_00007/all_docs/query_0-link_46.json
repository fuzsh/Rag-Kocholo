        "text": "Welcome to the nightmare world of Paradys!\n\nJehanine: demon or saint? Her days she spent at the Nunnery of the Angel; her nights in the vicious back-streets of Paradys, wreaking revenge on men for the wrongs she had suffered at their hands.\n\n'How fast does a man run when the Devil is after him?' Andre St Jean is about to find out, as a young man collapses at his feet and presses into his hand a strange scarab ring, containing the secret of life...\n\nThe stranger pushed a note across the table: 'In a week or less I shall be dead.' In a week, he was, and most unnaturally. She found herself drawn to the house where he died, to unravel the web of mystery and horror that had been spun about him...\n\nTales of macabre fantasy from Tanith Lee, as disturbing and spine-chilling as the stories of Poe and Lovecraft! (cover copy - trade issue) \"Paradys too has its cemeteries....\"; The search for dark secrets deepens in Book III of the Paradys tetralogy, a powerful collection of short stories peopled with the tortured souls that lie buried here as in a fragile prison.\n\nA handsome youth shocks his family by marrying a white weasel. On their bridal bed a beautiful maiden emerges from the weaselÂ’s discarded pelt, but it's not just her previous form that holds the bride captive. For her to be released she must be loved, but her beloved must die at her hands as he bestows the kiss that releases her.\n\nTwo childhood lovers wed. Their union seems to be blessed. Little does Roland know that Marie-Mai's pure body is host to the pointed fangs of Evil. Finding this on their wedding night, he kills her and chooses to take the truth to the gallows with him-not for him the responsibility of unmasking the naked face of the Devil.\n\nChildren and weak things wither after coming in contact with Julie d'Is. What ancient curse was bestowed upon this infant poisoner in the womb of her foolish mother? Only her death will reveal the truth, for no one can approach her in life.\n\nWith her finely crafted and masterful prose, Tanith Lee brings to life these agonized souls and twisted half-creatures, wreaking havoc in their twilight world, where death is only the beginning. (dustwrapper copy) In her darkly dazzling finish to The Secret Books of Paradys, Tanith Lee tempts the reader with a tale of horror, lust and madness that leaves no perversity untouched, no taboo unbroken.\n\nThis time, the seductive nightmare unfolds in three parallel versions of the City-Paradis, Paradys and Paradise. Connected by a labyrinth of ice whose dangers are amplified by the will and emotion of its lunatic travelers, these cities and their mad and near-mad denizens provide the stage for a drama of mythical proportions that none of the players can fully comprehend. Among the mad and the doomed are the murderous, remorseless siblings Felion and Smara; the violated woman-child Hilde; and Leocadia, the artist and visionary. Combining horror and hedonism, art and eroticism, Lee offers an aesthete's amoral view of beauty, pleasure and pain in her inimitable high style.\n\nThis fourth book in the Paradys series is linked brilliantly to the previous three - The Book of the Damned, The Book of the Beast, and The Book of the Dead - not by plot but by its shared venue: the fantastic, Gothic, atmospheric and changeable city of Paradys. (dustwrapper copy) LIONWOLF. Son to both god and mortal, his destiny must be death or power everlasting. The setting is a world of eternal winter, where once thrived hot climates and exquisite luxury. Saphay, neglected daughter of a sub-king in the civilized west, is sent off to marry a leader of the barbaric Jafn ... not realizing that her own father has arranged for her to be betrayed and abducted on this perilous journey. Escaping her pursuers, then dragged into the depths of an arctic sea, Saphay is miraculously discovered by her Jafn betrothed. She is still alive, though entombed in an ice pyramid, and their marriage proceeds as intended. However, when it becomes evident that Saphay is not only carrying a child already but is also the focus of a sorcerous and preternatural force, dark suspicions are aroused about the infant's true origin ... Driven out into the icy wilderness to face certain death, Saphay somehow manages to reach unwelcoming shelter. There her son can grow up safely in exile, while displaying all the astounding skills of a future hero .. and a future god. Populated by the strange and magnificent beasts and exotic landscapes, this spellbinding and disturbing epic adventure is the first in a long-awaited trilogy from one of the foremost writers of our time. (back cover copy) Lir knew that something was calling him. Not a voice, and yet a voice. Almost as unheard yet as insistent as a pulse-beat. He had dreams, too, and they were no more reassuring than the villagers'; assurances in that remote and unexpected place. Was there a castle beyond? Or just a ruin? Who, or what, was it that called? If he turned back now, he would never know. Shouldering his harp, Lir set his face towards the dark castle.\n\nIn the Castle of Dark, Lilune awoke, wondering what her calling would bring. The old hags who attended her had no idea she knew the spell. She walked sedately with them, under a moonshade, by the borders of the glassy lake, wishing that something would happen. She had no idea of the world outside.\n\nShe was to learn, in danger and dread, when Lir answered the calling and freed her from the dark. (dustwrapper copy) Raised a servant in a great House at the heart of a miles wide Garden, sixteen-year old Claidi has little to call her own, until, in a small act of rebellion, she steals a journal. Writing in its pages, she finds solace, confiding the petty cruelties of her spoiled mistress and the countless empty rules and rituals of the House. She can't imagine another existenceÂ—until a hot air balloon comes out of the sky carrying a golden haired stranger.\n\nTo the House, Nemian represents the hellish Waste beyond the Garden, an enemy invader to be locked away and killed. But to Claidi he offers precious hope of a life beyond the House walls. After she is told of her royal parentage, she risks all to free the charming prisoner and accompany him across the Waste toward his faraway home. It is a marvelous, bewildering and dangerous journey, full of strange peoples and monsters and weird machines, at the side of a man she could come to love.\n\nThat is, until they reach his city and the Wolf Tower where he was born. For there, Claidi will discover that, in her yearning for love and freedom, she has been lured into a web of conspiracy and lies. At the mercy of these alien surroundings, she finds the only thing she can trust is the love of a bandit king. And her adventures have just begun (dustwrapper copy) The first volume of the reprint of Tanith Lee's Colouring Book Series in Omnibus form. The first volume in this set of psychological thrillers, with occasional touches of the supernatural, includes:\n\nGreyglass: The house ... always growing, adding to itself, blooming, decaying, becoming reborn ... When Catherine dies, no one mourns. The house is always changing. As if at last it must achieve some irresistable transformation. Frankly, there is something uncanny about the house. Isn't there?\n\nTo Indigo: Novelist Roy Phipps leads an uneventful existence in the house inherited from his parents. His only aberration is the story He's been secretly writing for years and the mas poet Vilmos, a study of Murder, angst and alchemic magic. Then one evening Roy meets Vilmos, face to face.\n\nL'Amber: Jay has very little patience. Jilaine Best has everything. But even Jilaine's perfect life is flawed, longing for the baby she's unable to conceive. She's willing to let another woman give birth for her. And so Jay confesses she is already pregnant with an unwanted child. Spin your web of lies. Watch it tabngle. Now see what you've caught.\n\nWe are also pleased to include the rare fantasy short story Winter White, which previously only appeared in the collection Women As Demons in 1989. (back cover copy) The second volume of the reprint of Tanith Lee's Colouring Book Series in Omnibus form. The first volume in this set of psychological thrillers, with occasional touches of the supernatural, includes:\n\nKilling Violets: 1934 ... Straving to death somewhere in Europe, Anna meets Raoul, who takes her to England and the dubious mansion of his arrogant and unsavoury relatives, the Basultes. Anna is a survivor. Both the aristocratic malignities, and the Hogarthian orgies of the servants, can be accommodated, if they miust. Anna has a past as savage and explicit as anything seen in the Basulte house.\n\nIvoria: Nick Lewis certainly has no liking for this TV historian bother, Laurence. Aside from anything else Nick blames his for the death of their mother, the beautiful actress Claudia Martin. And so, is it possible the off-handedly childish trick played by Nick on Laurence really does cast some kind of curse? This is probably not a supernatural story. It might be less unsettling if it was.\n\nAlso included is the short story, The Sky-Green Blues, which appeared in Interzone magazine in 1999. (back cover copy) The third volume of the reprint of Tanith Lee's Colouring Book Series in omnibus form. The third volume in this set is os psychological thrillers, with occasional touches of the supernatural includes:\n\nCriel Pink: Emenie lices alone. Her vocation is that of a serial killer. Rod, though, has a dreary life, working at an unrewarding job, there is something uneasy hanging over him. Is it the wardrobe? Klova, young, beautiful and living on benign handouts, in a sort of science fantasy existence of spirits and liquid-silver ... until she meets he challenging Coal. And then there is the other one ..., or are there two?\n\nTurquoiselle: Not much is what it seems. THe job can be dull, but quite demanding - it involves a lot of driving, often very long hours, an always an erratic schedule. Not to mention social duties with certain important clients. The work is lucrative, however. He can easily afford the house in Kent, and the costly wants of Donna, his partner. For someone like Carver, dragged up through a deprived and aused childhood, not such a bad achievement. It's just that suddenly things are running less smoothly.\n\nWe are also pleased to include the fantasy short story Green Wallpaper, which previously only appeared in the collection The Secret History of Vampires in 2007. (back cover copy) The siege was over. The citadel of Avillis had burned, burned through the night, with its terrible Lord and his monstrous children in it. Nothing remained now but broken walls, charred stumps where trees had, grown, tattered lattices open to the sky. But at the heart of the palace the great Cup of Avillis stood untouched: pure gold, crusted with jewels each worth an emperor's ransom. Small wonder that Kachil, common thief, should covet it. Or Feluce, dapper arrogant climber; riches would mean much to him. But why did Havor of Taon, the hawk, join them to carry the cursed Cup away? For it was Havor who found that the Chalice once stolen could not be lightly cast aside, even in horror and despair. While always, inexorably, half-seen, slipping through shadows, shapes in the mind's eye, three phantom riders followed after it across the winter-blasted plain.\n\nThis chilling tale of flight and inescapable pursuit rises to a confrontation of ghostly powers. Havor thought his story could have only one ending, but the spirit world can summon Forces of Light as well as Dark. (dustwrapper copy) COMPANIONS ON THE ROAD and THE WINTER PLAYERS are two thrilling tales of adventure and quest by that rising star of fantasy literature, Tanith Lee.\n\nCOMPANIONS ON THE ROAD is a chilling story of flight and inexorable pursuit, which culminates in an inevitable confrontation between Light and Darkness.\n\nThe siege was over. The citadel of Avillis had burned through the night with its terrible Lord and his monstrous children in it. Nothing remained now but broken walls, charred stumps where trees had grown, tattered lattices open to the sky. But at the heart of the palace the great Cup of Avillis stood untouched: pure gold, crusted with jewels each worth an emperor's ransom. There was small wonder that Kachil, the common thief should covet it. Or Feluce, the dapper, arrogant rogue, for riches would mean much to him. But why did Havor of Taon, the hawk, join them to carry the cursed cup away? For it was Havor who found that the Chalice once stolen could not be lightly cast aside, even in horror and despair. For all the while, half-unseen, mere apparitions in his mind's eye, the three phantom riders followed after him across the desolate plain.\n\nBut what is Havor's fate? What will be the outcome of the unavoidable clash of ghostly powers? Havor thought his story could have only one ending, but can the spirit world summon Forces of Light as well as Dark?\n\nOaive, the young priestess of the fisherpeople, finds herself thrust into a desperate journey to recover an ancient and magical relic stolen from her shrine in THE WINTER PLAYERS.\n\nShe distrusted him at once. She knew his words were lies. 'Call me Grey,' he said, but that was not his name, Fear gripped her like a hand.\n\nNo one but the priestess could look upon the relics: the Ring, the Jewel and the Bone. It was for the Bone that this grey stranger had come. He was a thief, but she realized with a sinking heart that he was armed with as much magic as herself, and maybe more.\n\nThe relics were secret, sacred. The people would never know that the Bone was gone. But Oaive knew that she must follow Grey, find and destroy him, even though it meant leaving her people with no one to say the Ritual, no one to read the Book of Lore. Beyond the mist, they called the shrine the House of the Bone; if the Bone was not there, the Ritual was meaningless. She could not know that there were three players in the game, and that the most dangerous was the last. (dustwrapper copy) Emenie lives alone. Her vocation is that of a serial killer. She can read the omens and always knows exactly who is her legitmate prey. In a ruined and collapsing world, perhaps her method is the best one.\n\nRod, though, has a dreary life, working in an unrewarding job. Without friends, but unencumbered by relations, there is something uneasy hanging over him. Is it the wardrobe?\n\nHow unlike Klova, young, beautiful and living on benign hanfouts, in a sort of science fantasy existence of sprints and liquid-silver ... until her meets the challenging Coal. And then there is the other one ... or are there two?\n\nThey also begin to assert their influence - but where do they fit? Past historical, presents parallel and everyday - future imperfect.\n\nHere, at the outskits of this city they call London, what the hell is going on? (back cover copy)"
