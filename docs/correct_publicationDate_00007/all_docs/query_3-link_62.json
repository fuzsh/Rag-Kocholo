Sherlock reimaginings and retellings have appeared in books, television, and movies for almost every age group.  Some are set in modern times while others remain in the Victorian era of Conan Doyle’s original stories.  Some feature a female lead, and some have supernatural elements.  The items in this list are some of my favorite Sherlock Holmes reimaginings.  #IndyPLadults #Sherlock",

When their mother disappears, Sherlock and Mycroft return to the family estate to investigate, and they treat Enola like a helpless little girl. In Victorian days, girls and women were expected to be little more than decoration, but Enola isn’t having any of that. She is far from helpless and she embarks on an adventure to find her missing mother. I enjoyed seeing Enola gain confidence in herself through the course of this book and realize that she is just as capable of solving crimes as her brothers.

Charlotte Holmes is a brilliant but broken girl who has inherited some of Sherlock’s bad habits, and Jamie Watson takes up the family tradition of looking after Holmes. After a student is murdered on campus Watson and Holmes are framed for the crime and they must work together to solve the case and clear their names. I had a hard time putting this book down. I particularly liked the similarities between Sherlock and Charlotte, but also the fact that she was a complex character in her own right, and not just a teenage girl version of Sherlock. Also available as an eBook and downloadable audiobook. Trigger warning: References to drug use and rape.

Mycroft Holmes is the older brother of Sherlock and is usually left as a background character, but Abdul-Jabbar and co-author Anna Waterhouse bring Mycroft to the forefront in this fast-paced and violent origin story. They paint 23 year old Mycroft in a more positive light than we are used to while also paving the way for his transformation into the hardened man we know from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s work.

The story follows \"A Study in Scarlet\" closely, with elements changed to incorporate the supernatural. As the title suggests, Holmes is a Warlock in this parody and various supernatural phenomena occur in the book. If you want a serious Holmes retelling skip this one, but I found it quite enjoyable. Even though it closely follows the original, the changes make it quirky and fun. I laughed out loud. Available as a book and eBook. Show less\n\nA mashup of Sherlock Holmes and H.P.

Lovecraft’s Cthulhu written by multiple-award-winning author Neil Gaiman, with artwork by Eisner Award winner Rafael Albuquerque? Yes please! This is a retelling of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s book “A Study in Scarlet” with a Lovecraftian supernatural twist. Gaiman and Albuquerque’s combination of great writing and beautiful artwork create a perfect creepy, suspenseful, and horrific Victorian atmosphere, worthy of both Conan Doyle and Lovecraft. I absolutely loved it. Show less\n\nIn this great re-imagining of the iconic duo, Watson and Holmes are modern day African American men living in Harlem.

They meet when Holmes, a PI, shows up at the hospital where Watson is a medical intern to speak with one of Watson’s patients regarding a missing girl. From there Watson is drawn into the mystery and the game is afoot! I like that Watson and Holmes are on a more equal level in this re-imagining, and that Lieutenant Stroud (this story’s version of Lestrade) is more capable.

Marty tries to get to know her aunt by going through her belongings and talking to the neighbors, and as she learns more about her aunt’s life she discovers things that make her question the nature of her aunt’s death. The police are reluctant to give out information to a formerly unknown relative, so Marty and her friend Irene Adler create a fake private eye named Sherlock Holmes to investigate.

She founded a law firm to represent the poor who would not otherwise be able to afford an attorney. She had a fascinating career and became the first female Special Assistant United States Attorney. Later in her career she earned the nickname “Mrs. Sherlock Holmes” after solving the cold case of a girl who had disappeared years earlier. This title is also available in other formats including large print, eBook, and downloadable audiobook.

The Irregulars appeared in several of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s books. This volume contains two stories, told from the point of view of the Irregulars, as they run around London solving crimes and saving lives. The stories are fun and engaging and the artwork does a good job of capturing Victorian era London.

After a strange comet-like object casts an eerie green glow in the sky, London becomes overrun by zombies. Holmes and Dr. Watson must dodge the undead as they solve the mystery of how the people of London became zombified. All of our favorite characters are represented in this gory tale. The combination of period-appropriate writing and good artwork creates a creepy vibe, with some good zombie gore thrown in.

It relates to Conan Doyle’s real life interest in spiritualism, which creates a fun mix of factual and fictional tale. In this reimagining, Mrs. Hudson is Sherlock’s partner in investigation instead of Dr. Watson. It’s an interesting concept and adds to the Sherlockian universe. Also available as an eBook.
