        "text": "In this new collection, which contains most of the ghost stories of Tanith Lee - including four [sic! actually five, bibliographer's note] new tales original to this volume - Lee slips freely through the full gamut of fantasy, SF, horror, historical, parallel and contemporary genres. The themes range, amongst others, with a lost love in early 20th century New Zeland, a bullied child in 1970's India, into the underhill place of a brooding magician in search of wonders, among the guests of a modern spiky wedding-breakfast, and beside a psychic, on a far planet whose damson skies are adrift with flying whales...\n\nThe moods conjured are dark, unnerving or plain nasty; or else sad, tender, kind and - now and then - outright crazy.\n\nTurn up the light.\n\nAnd don;t look behind you. (back cover copy) A group of the dead linger here, in the yellow dwelling on the hill - once a castle, then a stately home, now falling into ruin.\n\nThese ghosts drift and mingle, and brood on their lost lives. Death can be caused by so many things - war, pandemics, ordinary murder - even suicide or accident. Even time, But after death, surely, one could hope for peace? Not any more.\n\nFor with 2020 the new apocalypse began. Civilisation crashed, and outside this ancient building things terrible, predatory, mindless ad unkillable roam and bellow.\n\nNow all the lights have gone out for good -\n\nWhere do you turn?(back cover copy) It is the eve of the French Revolution. The Aristos are drinking life to the dregs, indulging in every conceivable sensual vice as if there were no tomorrow, while the citizens, miserable in their poverty, seethe with envy and hatred in a sorcerous Paris, beautiful in the center, rotting with mighty slums around the edges.\n\nIn this sweeping novel, Tanith Lee depicts the savage spirit of Year 1, following the life of journalist, pamphleteer and patriot Camille Desmoulins through these turbulent days. A fascinating and complex creature of the mind who maneuvered through all levels of Paris society, Desmoulins was the journalist and voice of the Revolution. Silenced by the guillotine during the terror in the prime of his youth, Desmoulins, with his circle of friends, is the heart and soul of this gripping novel. With the unflagging pace of Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago and the enveloping atmosphere of Anne Rice's The Feast Of All Saints, The Gods Are Thirsty breathes new life into the volatile days of the French Revolution with every compelling page. (dustwrapper copy) Journeying across different lands, the young mender Tanaquil and her familiar, a quarrelsome talking peeve, learn of the empress Veriam, who wishes to conquer from one sea to the next. Tanaquil is shocked to learn that the woman called 'Conqueror' and 'Child-Eater' is in fact her half sister, Lizra.\n\nRemembering the powerful effect the black unicorn had on her people, Lizra has constructed a tremendous mechanical unicorn of gold as a symbol of her conquest.\n\nThe only problem is that it doesn't work - and Lizra commands Tanaquil to make the steam-powered unicorn move. Now Tanaquil must choose between assisting in brutal conquest or risking the ire of her powerful sister. (dustwrapper copy) THE GORGON, a brilliant shocker that leads off this scintillating new collection of Tanith Lee's tales, was the winner of the World Fantasy Award for best short story of the year. It is appropriate that it gives its title to these tales ranging from horror and the supernatural to science fiction, from the writer who has been justly termed \"Princess Royal of Heroic Fantasy.\"\n\nHere you will find unforgettable encounters of men and beasts - of dragons and unicorns, cats and seals, virgins and vampires. This is truly a feast of treasures for everyone whose taste runs to a gourmet imagination. (back cover copy) The house ... always growing, adding to itself, blooming, decaying, becoming reborn ...\n\nBut Susan doesn't live in the house of Catherine, her grandmother. Instead, she grows up in a one parent family, with her mother, the glamorous and determined Anne. And Catherine, old and forbidding and unkind, is only a nuisance.\n\nWhy is it that whenever some new problem swamps Susan's far from calm existence, she is driven to revisit the house? As when her mother takes up with the worrying Wizz? Or years later, at the end of a deeply-felt and broken love-affair of Susan's own?\n\nThe house is always changing. As if at last it must achieve from irrestible transformation.\n\nFrankly, there is something uncanny about the house.\n\nIsn't there.(back cover copy) Where the moon washed the deck, something sat, its huge head raised, more like the visage of a bear than a wolf, yet long-snouted, the jaws open. Cold eyes that had no soul in them mirrored the moon ...\n\nAfter the killing of his brutal father, golden and handsome Daniel Vehmund has sought refuge in an exotic faraway land. But his contentment is shattered when a fabulous diamond is pressed on him by a sinister graverobber. From that first fatal contact, Daniel is doomed each night of the full moon to become something else ... something dark and powerful and savage. And nothing that originates on this earth can destroy him.\n\nLaura, a beautiful redhaired farm-girl, lives with her two awful sisters and her selfish grasping parents in the remote English countryside. Apparently condemned to a life of drudgery, all is transformed when she is wooed and wed by a wealthy local squire. But this gilded existence is threatened when a travelling magician persuades her besotted husband to buy for her a very unusual diamond. For this gem is \"The Wolf,\" the diamond that had so transformed Daniel Vehmund's destiny. And when he himself returns at last to England, his fate and Laura's are devastatingly intertwined ...\n\nMeanwhile some dark, malignant presence continues to prowl the woodlands and hedgerows ... and seemingly nothing can curb its unquenchable bloodlust.\n\nA brilliant, enthralling masterpiece of highly coloured imagination. (dustwrapper copy) \"The isle is supernatural and may produce anything. It is a place half in this world and half elsewhere. In spots, they say, it opens on the country of the moon itself. Therefore, anticipate magic, and great danger. Sacrifice is common on the isle. So is death.\"\n\nClirando, a celebrated warrior, believes herself to be cursed. Betrayed by people she trusted, she unleashes a vicious retaliation upon them and thenlives in fear of fateful retribution for her act of cold-blooded vengeance.\n\nOnce every seventeen years, the full moon of midsummer shines for seven nights, and celebrations take place upon the mysterious Moon Isle. When Clirando is ordered by the priestess of the temple of Parna to travel with seven companions to the festival on the isle, she sees this as her punishment at last - if not her doom. But the isle is mysterious and disorientating. THe senses cannot be trusted. Strange visions haunt the shadows. Perhaps the dead walk there. During the nights of the full moon, anything might happen.\n\nSet in a land resembling Ancient Greece, in this novella Tanith Lee explores the dark corners of the heart and soul within a vivid mythical adventure. The book also includes 'The Dry Season' another of her tales set in an imaginary ancient world of the classical era. (back cover copy) LIONWOLF son to both god and mortal, but now trapped in eternal icy conflict. Killed through the power of the god Zezeth, his tru father, the hero Lionwolf has been cast into a bleak and icy hell lit only by a cold blue sun. Here he and other living dead must wage endless combat to appease the whim of a deathly king whose face is made of stone. But when Lionwolf encounters the king's wife, she is none other than the beautiful Chillel, his own former lover - and nemesis.\n\naS Lionwofl struggles in the toils of hell, elsewhere throughout the ice age shrouding the mortal earth, men and women and working out their own destinies ... An empire has fallen. Ru Karismi, capital of the kings, has been abandoned to the poisons of the White Death. And across the lands of the Jafn and the Ruk, lawless reivers take their prey wherever they wish.\n\nAgainst this unsettled backdrop, the sorceress Jemhara determines to save the magician Thryfe from a dire self-inflicted punishment, while the hero's mother Saphnay, now Become a goddess of the far north, seeks to lead her followers to a new world.\n\nYet Zezeth's violent hatred shadows all - and from the depths of an ice-locked sea his other son, the terrifying and mountainous leviathan Brightshade, is once more rising in pursuit of vengeance ... (back cover copy) 'LIGHTNING STRIKES....'\n\nThe fortune teller had spoken the words, shown her the cards that predicted she would become the focal point of great events. But now, a captive of those who had invaded her land, Ara could only wait, hoping to discover the true path of her destiny. But in a world ruled by the war, what chance did Ara have to attain her heart's desire? Carried far from her home, alone among strangers, only the will of the goddess, the Lady Vulmardra, could protect and guide her.\n\nYet the path the Lady had set her upon would lead Ara to the very heart of conflict. And though she might gain great wealth or lose it, become both pawn and player in the power games of princes and warlords, there was only one for whom she would risk everything, a soldier who some named traitor and others liberator, the man for whom she would strive to become -\n\nA HEROINE OF THE WORLD (back cover copy) Welcome to Indigara ... a strangely familiar, strangely hypnotic world.\n\nJet and her robot dog, Otis, have been taken with Jet's two sisters--one of whom has a role in the latest super-movie--to their planet's film capital, Ollywood. Jet and Otis are soon plunged into the mysterious underworld that lurks below the studios and lots. Here lies the beautiful and sinister otherwhere of Indigara, which has spontaneously generated from the sets, costumes, models, and actual celluloid of fantasy and SF plot movies that never got made into series. Even while the girl and dog try to survive the dangers and terrors below, their Indigaran mirror images have replaced them, and are running amok in the real world above.\n\nTanith Lee's trademark combination of unique worldbuilding, humor, and action make Indigara a five-star success!(inside cover copy) When Prince Draco sees the mysterious woman from the East, she entrances him as no one has before. His second-in-command Skorous suspects that she has secret motives when he learns that she has the power to transform things into gold. Is this her only power, or has she bewitched Draco's heart?\n\nTanith Lee, one of the best fantasists writing today, has crafted a masterful tale of desire and deception. She has written over a dozen novels, and has won the World Fantasy Award for her short fiction. (back cover copy) Nick Lewis certainly has no loking for his TV historian brother, Laurence. Aside from anything else Nick blames him for the death of their mother, the beautiful actress Claudia Martin. And so, is it possible the off-handededly childish trick played by Nick on Laurence really does cast some kind of a curse?\n\nBizarre and unpleasant things begin to happen, without a doubt. And Nick himself is hardly immune. As the pattern of his secure yet eccentric life starts to come undone, he finds himself without remedies. Where has Laurence vanished to? What is the creepy Mr. Pond's part in it all? And who is the apparently sinister Kitty Price?\n\nCan repressed hatred cause such disruption, danger, even death? Or has the object caused it, as Nick pretended it could: that little ivory counter from a stolen drawer?\n\nThis is probably not a supernatural story. It might be less unsettling if it was. (back cover copy) Kill the dead? How can you slay that which is already slain? Yet ... sometimes the dead refuse to stay quiet.\n\nFor there are times when the dead have a duty that must be fulfilled. There are times when those must walk who defy God and Nature to do so; those are times of horror and haunting.\n\nThen one must call the exorcist. There is work for the slayer of ghosts in the backlands of the world. There is work for Parl Dro, Ghost-Killer.\n\nThis is the story of two sisters who defied him. One did not belong on this earth, one did. But which was the one he must kill? Which was the one he must silence?\n\nTanith Lee has written in KILL THE DEAD a marvelous novel of dark shadows and strange evils ... a novel to place alongside THE EXORCIST and THE STAND, a weird companion to SABELLA and THE BIRTHGRAVE. (back cover copy) 1934.\n\nStarving to death somewhere in Europe, Anna meets Raoul. She is ready to sell herself for a meal, but he has other plans. He takes her to England, to a summer of torrential rain, and the dubious mansion of his arrogant and unsavoury relatives, the Basultes.\n\nIt seems Anna is to \"enjoy\" the godly Basulte life. BUt the mounds of stodgy food, the genuflecting servants, the mindless cruelty of class, (the endless rain), affront her. Besides, she is becoming aware of the family, Raoul included, is playing with her a macabre and silly game.\n\nAnna is a suvivor - she has had to be - practiced at acting out the impossible. Both the aristocratic malignities, and the Hogarthian orgies of the servants, can be accommodated, if they must. For did they but know, Anna has a past as savage and explicit as anything seen in the Basulte house.\n\nThe past, that was Preguna, where Anna love Árpád, during a European summer of soft heat. Until love ended in the darkness that now hangs on every moment of her life, reducing all other things, however murderous, to nothing. (back cover copy) As she says of herself, Jay is a 'chancer'. But she finds she is at once out of her depth when she meets the beautiful artist, Jilaine Best.\n\nApparently, Jilaine has everything - looks, talent, and wealth, yet even so her life is imperfect. In adolescence she lost her mother in circumstances both mysterious and painfully unpleasant. Now, Unable to conceive, Jilaine's one wish is for a baby - even if another woman gives birth to it.\n\nJay can't resist the opportunity, she tells Jilaine that she, Jay, is pregnant. And so the great lie begins.\n\nIt seems easy enough - for there conveniently is the handsome young cab driver, only too willing to make love with her ... But the spun web is already untangling. Can anything result from it but danger - and destruction?(back cover copy)"
