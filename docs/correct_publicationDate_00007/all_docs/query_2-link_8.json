        "text": "I saw her, hanging in the sky like a flake of the moon. A woman, her face masked by a black shireen, her body by a black shift, but her white arms spread, and her white, white, bone-white hair blowing all around her like a flame composed of smoke. Recognition was immediate. It was my mother.\n\nI shouted at her:\n\n'Your son, Ettook's warrior! Do you like what you have made of me? I might have been a prince in Eshkorek Arnor, or in Eziann. I might have been a king with a great army at my back, beautiful women to please me, and Power to make all men do as I wished. Do you like what you have made?'\n\nIt was crystal clear to me, what he had meant for me, my father, Vazkor, what she had robbed me of. And I drew from my belt my hunting knife and threw it at her heart.\n\n\"Tanith Lee is, in my opinion, fast becoming the best woman sf writer around ... she is already one of the best fantasy writers ... Tanith Lee writes one helluva book and I can't wait to see more.\" - Baryon (back cover copy) Tanith Lee wrote fifteen stories for the acclaimed US genre magazine 'Realms of Fantasy', which ran from 1994 to 2009 and was founded and edited by her close friend, Shawna McCarthy. Venus Burning: Ralms collects all these stories in one volume for the first time, some of which have only ever appeared in the magazine and will therefore be new to some of Tanith;s fans.\n\nThe stories in thie collection are among her best work, in which Tanith takes myth and fairy tale tropes and turns them on their heads. You might find fantasy swordsmen (Woman in Scarlet), vampires (Israbel), werewolves (moonblind), dragons (The Children of his Old Age), ghostly dolls (Doll Skulls) and tales reminiscent of the Arabian Nights (I Bring You Forever), but these are nothing like stories of the horror/fantasy genre you've read before. Lush and lyrical, deep and literary, Tanith Lee created fresh poignant tales from familiar archtypes. This book also includes three previously uncollected stories from her Flat Earth mythos. (back cover copy) Picaro, a traveler from the surface, has come, via submarine to Venus, chasing the evil prophecy that has cast a shadow over his entire life. As rumors of a conspiracy to isolate the domed city from the surface emerge, an unexplained catastrophe occurs, claiming several lives, from which Picaro narrowly escapes. Was it merely an accident, computer failure, or has the experiment unleashed an airborne virus? Or is there even a more sinister danger afoot, a force from beyond that threatens the survival of Venus iself? Picaro finds that the only way to answer these questions is to confront the mysteries of his own that have long remained buried, and to reveal the connection that ties his past to that of the unavenged spirits wreaking havoc on the doomed city. (dustwrapper copy) Vivia, daughter of Lord Vaddix. A paragon of youth and beauty, alienated from the brutal father who rules his castle through violence and fear. In the aftermath of the latest bloody battle, her father's rage reaches new heights of madness when his faithful war stallion is killed.\n\nFor Vivia there is little solace, save the secret cave in the bowels of the castle, known only to her and the arcane god whose shrine she believes it is.\n\nWhen plague enters the castle, bringing with it an orgy of death and destruction, Vivia seeks shelter in this secret place, among the bats. Drawn to her innocence and beauty, a presence whose power knows no bounds is resurrected, claiming her as his own, taking her to a luxurious palace steeped in seduction and blood.\n\nVivia, the innocent, wakened to the wonder of the undead, granted the gift of eternal life. But the whims of men are nothing to this dark prince. Tainted by betrayal, Vivia's immortality stretches before her like a damnation, until Zulgaris frees her from a waking death.\n\nHandsome Zulgaris, prince, war-leader and alchemist. Is Vivia to be his lover Â– or his pet? Or, far worse, is she but one more thing to be used in his relentless quest for sorcerous power? (dustwrapper copy) The author of the unforgettable BIRTHGRAVE, of the panoramic outworld of THE STORM LORD, and of the future folk of DON'T BITE THE SUN, now presents us with something different - and yet equally enthralling in its color and fantasy and high adventure.\n\nFor VOLKHAVAAR is a novel of witchcraft and wonders on a world far removed from those we know. Here the gods contend for power - the Dark forces against the Light - and here an entire city and its land is plunged into the shadow of an evil beyond anything conceivable. It is the story of Shaina the slave girl and of Volk the outcast who enslaved himself to cosmic forces to gain total power - and of how they were finally to meet and clash - with an entire world as their prize.\n\nVOLKHAVAAR is high fantasy comparable only to the best of Andre Norton and Michael Moorcock. (back cover copy) By the laws of the Kingdom of Dorthar, most powerful of all the realms of Vis, the heir to the Storm Lord's throne is his lastborn son. Thus should the crown belong someday to Raldnor, product of the Storm Lord's union with a light-skinned Lowland priestess. But the Storm Lord's scheming queen, Val Mala, has other plans - plans that set in motion an extraordinary epic of passion, treachery, ambition and clashing gods on a distant and fascinating planet.\n\nVis is a continent divided, dominated by the dark-haired, dark-skinned race of the Storm Lord, of his Queen - and of their son Amrek. Engineering the halfbreed infant Raldnor's disappearance, Val Mala clears her son's path to the throne. The Storm Lord is the story of Raldnor, raised by the light-skinned, peace-loving Lowlanders, who returns years later to Dorthar. Strong and brave, he is hired by Amrek, now Storm Lord himself, to head the royal guard. Neither is aware of their blood connection. Neither bears the other ill ... until Amrek's bride gives in to her growing passion for the pale-eyed Lowlander.\n\nAmrek's jealous fury crystallizes his resolve to rid the continent of Lowlanders. And only Raidnor stands between the Storm Lord and the horror of genocide. Outnumbered, apparently overpowered, the Lowlanders turn to Raldnor and to the snake goddess Anackire for help.\n\nAnackire returns us to Vis a full generation after The Storm Lord's shattering conclusion. A delicate and complex political balance has held for twenty years. Raldanash is Storm Lord in peaceful Dorthar, but a tyrant rules in Zakoris and another is rising through treachery and intrigue in Karmiss. Piracy, assassination, torture and racial strife spread chaos as the fragile balance of peace tips inexorably toward war.\n\nAs the armies converge, Anackire, the powerful and mysterious snake goddess, begins to stir again. And this time, she will unleash powers far beyond the dreams - or nightmares - of any mortal.\n\nTanith Lee has been widely praised by fans and colleagues alike for her vivid world-creation and riveting prose. In The Storm Lord and its epic companion novel, Anackire, she has spun an engrossing fantasy brimming with dark magic, action, passion and mystery. (dustwrapper copy) This anthology of twenty-eight tales comprises all the short stories by Tanith Lee that were published in the seminal magazine Weird Tales during her lifetime. Some of them are previously uncollected, and appeared in print only in the magazine, so will be new to many of Tanith's fans.\n\nTanith Lee's highly-respected and influential work spanned every genre, and this sumptuous collection deconstrates the range of ver versatality. From the dark high fantasy of 'The Sombrous Tower', through the Arthurian=influenced 'The Kingdoms Of The Air', the achingly beautiful 'Stars Above, Stars Below' of a science-fantasy Mars, the sinister retelling of a fairy tale in 'When The Clock Strikes', the real-world mysteries of 'The Unrequited Glove' and 'Arthur's Lion', and almost whimsical steampunk of 'The Presecution Machine', The Weird Tales Of Tanith Lee showcases the myriad styles of the writer rightly renown as the High Priestess of Fantasy. (back covercopy) Hesta Web, with her hot red hair and her tough, guarded coldness, is trapped with a mother who hates her and a father who is mostly away earning money on an oil rig. When Hesta discovers that her mother and her mother's lover have had rampant sex in Hesta's bed, she absconds with her friend Janey to the seaside.\n\nIt is the last day of the season, sun bright and sea sparkling. The bars and shops are open, the funfair spins round with shrieks and shouts. As night falls, the illuminations go on. But when Janey catches the last train to London, Hesta stays behind. She falls in with the gothic-looking, unpleasantly attractive Skilt and his subject colony of junkies and beggars. In a rotting hotel on the front, among the broken marble balustrades, the mouse-eaten rooms and the bonfire in the ballroom, Hesta takes up her new life. She hears drugged legends told beside the fire, the rumours of ghosts and the strangeness of the sea.\n\nFor now the season has ended, the seaside is deserted, the illuminations are switched off, this place is very strange. Does Skilt know its secret? Should Hesta be wary of the blond man who watches her from the pier? And what happens when the lights go out?\n\nIt's dark. (dustwrapper copy) Once upon a time there was a mirror ...\n\nSo begins this dark, unusual retelling of the story of Snow White by the writer reviewers have called \"the Angela Carter of the fantasy field.\" Tanith Lee's collection of fairy stories, Red as Blood: Tales from the Sisters Grimmer, is an acknowledged classic of fairy tale literature for adults. Now this mistress of the fairy-tale form gives readers a whole novel based on a beloved story, turning it into a dark and sensual drama full of myth and magic.\n\nArpazia is the aging queen who paces the halls of a warlord's palace. Cold as winter, she has only one passion -- for the mysterious hunter who courts the outlawed old gods of the woodland. Coira is the princess raised in the shadow of her mother's hatred. Avoided by both her parents and half-forgotten by her father's court, she grows into womanhood alone ... until the mirror speaks, and blood is spilled, and the forest claims her.\n\nThe tragic myth of the goddess Demeter and her daughter, Persephone, stolen by the king of the underworld, is woven together with the tale of Snow White to create a powerful story of mothers and daughters and the blood that binds them together, for good or ill. Black queen. White maid. Royal huntsman. Seven little folk who live in the forest. Come inside, sit by the fire, and listen to this fairy tale as you've never heard it before. Once upon a time there was a mirror, and a girl as white as snow ... (dustwrapper copy) THE WHITE WITCH -\n\nShe is Aztira, one of the magical Amanackire race, a pure white albino with powers both mysterious and terrifying. She can grant life and defy death, enchant men - or destroy them!\n\nAND THE WARRIOR -\n\nHe is Rehger. Sold into slavery at the age of four, he will become one of the finest warriors and charioteers in the land. Yet all his prowess with arms will not save him from the spell of the White Witch, a dangerous bewitchment that will lead him to challenge the mightiest of mortals and immortals ... and to embark on a fearsome quest in search of the legendary city that is home to the Amanackire. (back cover copy) She distrusted him at once, not least because she knew his words were lies. 'Call me Grey,' he said, but that was not his name. Fear gripped her like a hand.\n\nNo one but the priestess could look upon the relics: the Ring, the jewel and the Bone. It was for the Bone that this grey stranger had come. He was a thief, but she realized with a sinking heart that he was armed with as much magic as herself, and maybe more.\n\nThe relics were secret, sacred. The people would never know that the Bone was gone. But Oaive knew that she must follow Grey, find and destroy him, even though it meant leaving her people with no one to say the Ritual, no one to read the Book of Lore. Beyond the mist, they called the shrine the House of the Bone; if the Bone was not there, the Ritual was meaningless. She could not know that there were three players in the game, and that the most dangerous was the last. (dustwrapper copy) Tanith Lee, one of the world's best writers of fantasy and horror, wrote hundreds of stories within her lifetime, spanning many genres. In this collectoon are thirteen tales, most of which appeared only in nightmares or rare anthologies.\n\n'A Wolf at the Dood' implies hidden threat - until the door is open, we don't really know what's out there. It can also refer to misfortune, seen coming from a distance. And now the beast is upon youk scratching at the wood, its hot breath steaming on the step. Will you survive the encounter? Will the dawn save you - that good fortune you've longed for? The wolf might also be a metaphor for madness, another kind of predator that may creep towards a person unseen. Perhaps, once the door is opened, what you might have thought to be a threat turns out to be something else entirelty. But of course, it can also be a werewolf ...\n\nTanith enjoyed playing with genres and their tropes, and the stories in this collection range in mood and tone, from the light-hearted to the terrifying, the whimsical to the unsettling. A superb introduction to her work for the newcomer and a treasure trove for her enthusiasts. (backcover copy) Orphan-slave Claidi has fought for freedom and won. Now she looks forward to a life of happiness with the wandering Hulta people.\n\nBut once again for Claidi, nothing and no-one is as it seems. Secrets menace her; a bewildering land of giant flowers and savage animals; the awesome Rise, a great cliff topped by a mansion ruled by a strange, arrogant, enigmatic Prince. At dusk each night, the rising of the flaming Wolf Star.\n\nAgain, Claidi has only her wits and courage as weapons and her diary as her only friend. (back cover copy)"
