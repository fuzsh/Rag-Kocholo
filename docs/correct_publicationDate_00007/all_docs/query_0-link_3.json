The themes here demonstrate Lee's impressive eclecticism both in time and space, from straight science fiction (the last woman on Earth receives an android alien visitor; an immortal guardian who psychically roams the galaxy; disembodied mentalities stored in a computer until a body becomes available) to fantastical creatures (gorgons, silkies, vampires, tigers, mermen, werewolves). Elsewhere: a splendid Jack Vance pastiche (Lee is one of the very few writers who could carry it off) that turns into rather good Jack Vance; \"Cinderella\" recast as a bloody tale of black-magical vengeance; an eerie city populated by automata; a haunted seaside hotel room; a Carthagenian black sorceress; plus: murderous queens, human sacrifices, astral/time travel, ghosts, avatars, demons, and more.
