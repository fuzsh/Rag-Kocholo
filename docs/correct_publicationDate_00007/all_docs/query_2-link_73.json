        "text": "Author: Edward Willett (ed.)\n\nTitle: Shapers of Worlds\n\nFormat: e-book\n\nPages: 364\n\nSeries: Shapers of Worlds #1\n\nWow. I mean, this type of publication comes around once in a decade, perhaps ‚Äì or maybe not even that. It is so cringingly, eye-poppingly bad it could serve as an extremely effective guide on how not to: write short stories, choose stories for publishing, edit anthologies, and put your own (badly written) story up front as the editor of said anthologies.\n\nIt started off bad and nosedived to worst with impressive speed; of the eighteen stories in this anthology only three got anything equal to 5 stars or above (out of 10); the rest received almost uniformly 1 and 2 star ratings, and a few beat even that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù score and got a round 0. I thought of DNFing this collection, but two things stopped me: firstly, each story was written by a different author; I could not in good conscience just consign their work to the bin without reading it, since their stories‚Äô placement in the anthology was not their fault. Secondly, the whole experience turned into one of morbid interest, something along the lines of watching a train wreck in slow motion: I could not believe how bad some of these stories could be, how the authors could think of publishing them. Because, you know, the list of names here is really quite impressive: Haldeman, Powell, Weber, Modesitt, Jr., Scalzi, McGuire, Czerneda, Lee‚Ä¶ Many of those authors‚Äô works have been reviewed quite favourably on this blog and others. What most of them decided to publish in this anthology, though‚Ä¶ probably had been hiding in the deepest recesses of their drawers and should never have seen the light of day.\n\nContinue reading ‚ÄúEdward Willett (ed.), Shapers of Worlds (2020)‚Äù ‚Üí\n\nOh, 2020. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs becoming a tradition that we can‚Äôt fit all we want to write about in our end-year post, and again we had to divide it into two. Before Christmas we wrote about the blog and stats, now we want to share our favourite ‚Äì and least favourite ‚Äì books and shows, consumed in this fateful year.\n\nOla: Well, say what you want, but for me 2020 turned out to be a good time for reading ;). As last year, I decided to divide my best reads into three categories, Fiction, Non-fiction, and Comics. With so many books read, my The Best Of criteria had to be very harsh, so below are the best of the best of the best, which means a very impactful, thought-provoking and delightful read, as well as the even rarer 10/10 rating :).\n\nOla‚Äôs Best of 2020 in Fiction\n\nNeal Stephenson, Anathem (2008)\n\nThis was truly one of the very best reads of 2020 and one of the very best SF reads ever. Stephenson‚Äôs love letter to Western philosophy and science is pure perfection, and his decision to wrap it into a hero‚Äôs journey through a world as like and as unlike our own was a masterstroke, allowing the readers an incredibly immersive experience. The prose is dense, ambitious, unforgiving, but given a chance it shines with amazing clarity and emotion. I owe big thanks to Bart, who recommended Anathem to me; Stepehenson‚Äôs Seveneves is good, especially the first part dealing with orbital mechanics, and would‚Äôve been even better if the last part didn‚Äôt exist, but Anathem is a masterpiece, clear and simple. If you haven‚Äôt yet, read it!\n\nHilary Mantel, The Mirror & the Light (2020)\n\nThe grand finale of the critically acclaimed Cromwell trilogy doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It may be more meandering and more sentimental than the naked blade of Bring Up the Bodies, but that‚Äôs to be expected since it deals with the final years of Thomas Cromwell, whose tragic history is inextricably linked with that of Henry VIII. A historical novel with grand ambitions, a deep psychological portrayal of human vices and virtues, of naked ambition, egotism and the pitfalls of power, The Mirror & the Light is astonishingly modern, significant novel; a mark of true classic, its contents equally relevant in times of Henry VIII and our own.\n\nYoon Ha Lee, Ninefox Gambit (2016)\n\nI‚Äôve written all I could about this quirky, thought-provoking read. I loved Lee‚Äôs bold, utterly brilliant mashup of Korean mythology and political anti-utopia clad in military SF accoutrements and wrapped up in a stolen identity mystery happening in the middle of a galactic war. Ninefox Gambit is wonderfully ambitious, broad in scope, and lyrical. I‚Äôve read the remaining two books in the trilogy, but sadly, their quality seemed to be deteriorating with each installment, and by the end turned into a political treatise focused on gender issues while what I was expecting was an all-out AI revolution ;).\n\nBernard Cornwell, The Pale Horseman (2005)\n\nThe second installment in the Saxon Stories series, popularized by the Netflix‚Äôs TV series Last Kingdom (very good, actually, though I haven‚Äôt seen it past season 1 as I want to read the books first ;)) is impeccably written, heart-rending, thoroughly researched, and simply riveting. The first book is good; but only in The Pale Horseman Cornwell achieves the psychological and societal depth to make his work outstanding. Many thanks to Sarah, who recommended this series to me. A review will come one day, I promise üòâ\n\nDaniel Polansky, The Seventh Perfection (2020)\n\nI was really surprised by this little novella; its impact on me was far bigger than I‚Äôd expected judging by its length and the misleadingly obfuscating beginning. But this tiny bit of a book is simply amazing, turning midpoint from a slightly generic fantasy into a Kafkian treatise on the nature and limits of power. I absolutely adored every aspect of it, from the stunningly apt use of the second person perspective to the impeccably structured journey ‚Äì inward and outward ‚Äì of the protagonist.\n\nContinue reading ‚ÄúThe Best Of 2020‚Äù ‚Üí\n\nAuthor: Yoon Ha Lee\n\nTitle: Ninefox Gambit\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nPages: 512\n\nSeries: Machineries of Empire #1\n\nThis year started out very well ‚Äì at least with regards to my SF reading üòâ I have only had the misfortune of reading one dud during these first two months of 2020, and it was fantasy, which I‚Äôll definitely scour in a scathing review sometime in the future ‚Äì but as this review deals with a violent military SF of the highest order, I shall focus on that with all the delight and diligence it deserves.\n\nNinefox Gambit, the first installment in Lee‚Äôs Machineries of Empire trilogy, presents a world in which math is the language of magic. Or, more precisely, where math begets magic ‚Äì as long as there are people who absolutely believe in this possibility. The magic of math ‚Äì of geometry and probability, of statistics and analysis ‚Äì is a lethal one. The unforgiving inevitability of right angles and straight lines alters the fabric of the universe, creating temporal pockets of reality where life becomes impossible. Radiation, mutation, extreme temperatures ‚Äì whatever you like, whatever you deem necessary, is at the tips of your fingers. The only thing you need to do is to have enough soldiers to make a meaningful formation and keep it despite constant winnowing by the opposite forces ‚Äì and, of course, social belief.\n\nHere‚Äôs where things become tricky. The power of the mathematical magic is based on popular belief. It can be upheld only through meticulously calculated and obsessively observed rituals and modes of behavior dictated by a uniformly accepted calendar: such and such number of days in a week; such and such day a sacred one; such and such rituals falling on certain dates; such and such number of human sacrifices made when occasion demands. The belief must be absolute and unquestioned; it must form the foundation of the people‚Äôs worldview, must be inculcated from the start and rigorously, continuously reinforced. Otherwise you‚Äôre bound to find calendrical rot at the core of your perfectly oiled and ticking empire ‚Äì a dissident movement, a desperate revolution against the totalitarian society which treats an individual only as a replaceable cog in the machine.\n\nContinue reading ‚ÄúYoon Ha Lee, Ninefox Gambit (2016)‚Äù ‚Üí\n\nAuthor: Jean Lee\n\nTitle: Fallen Princeborn: Stolen\n\nFormat: mobi\n\nPages: 673\n\nI received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I‚Äôd like to thank her for the opportunity.\n\nSet in rural Wisconsin, Fallen Princeborn: Stolen follows eighteen-year-old Charlotte and her younger sister Anna, escaping from abusive and unhealthy family situation in North Dakota to live with their aunt. While Charlotte is ready for the new challenge, gladly leaving the violent past behind and looking forward to her future, filled with her passion ‚Äì music, Anna is clearly unhappy, dragging her feet and feeling forcefully uprooted. Before the sisters can achieve any kind of mutual understanding or compromise, however, they enter into a fairy-tale of their own. The woods and rivers of Wisconsin are the domain of velidevour ‚Äì dangerous and powerful faeries, who perceive humans as fair game, kidnapping them, feeding on them and erasing any sign of their existence from human memory. As the velidevour subsist on veli: the dreams, emotions and sheer cognitive potential of humans, there was a time humans and velidevour lived in a form of symbiosis: the dreamers, the artists, the vagabonds all found their way to the land of faeries, living in the land of impossible and feeding the impossible with their rapture and imagination. Yet since a wall had been erected between the worlds, humans are no longer guests in the lands of velidevour ‚Äì they are prey.\n\nWhen Charlotte‚Äôs and Anna‚Äôs bus crashes down in the middle of nowhere, and a pair of shady characters with a weird-smelling vehicle suddenly show up as backup, Charlotte knows something is off. But caught in the current of events, each subsequent one more bizarre than others, she can do nothing ‚Äì until it‚Äôs too late for retreat. Going head-on on a rescue mission into the land of magic, she finds her life and her family ties redefined.\n\nContinue reading ‚ÄúJean Lee, Fallen Princeborn: Stolen (2018)‚Äù ‚Üí"
