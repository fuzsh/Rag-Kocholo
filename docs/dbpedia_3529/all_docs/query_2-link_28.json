        "text": "Whenever Gary Bettman and the N.H.L. owners lock out their players, fans in North America have a chance to reacquaint themselves with European hockey. It happened in 1994-95, in 2004-5 and now again in 2012.\n\nAfter only one week of this lockout, more than 60 N.H.L. players have signed or agreed to contracts in Europe; during the last lockout, almost 400 N.H.L. players skated abroad. So here is a guide to Europe’s top domestic leagues. If you can master the differences between Trinec of the Czech Republic and Trencin of Slovakia, or Metallurg Magnitogorsk and Metallurg Novokuznetsk of Russia, you can follow your favorite N.H.L. players overseas.\n\nRUSSIAN K.H.L. Widely considered the world’s second-best league, the Kontinental Hockey League is the present-day home to the great clubs of the Soviet era. But where once teams were sponsored by the likes of the army, the Interior Ministry and labor unions, they are now sponsored by national energy companies, regional energy companies and the billionaire owners of energy companies.\n\nDuring the 2004-5 lockout, Russia’s top circuit was called the Superliga. Pavel Datsyuk arrived from Detroit to help Dynamo Moscow win the title.\n\nBut in 2008, the league reorganized as the K.H.L. with grand v isions of expansion into Asia and Western Europe; the Kremlin leader Vladimir V. Putin even called the league “an instrument of Russian foreign policy.”\n\nThe league has indeed expanded beyond the Soviet borders, to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. But it has had catastrophic setbacks. In 2008 Avangard Omsk’s Alexei Cherepanov, 18, died of heart failure when the arena he was playing in had inadequate medical equipment. Last year, the entire Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team died in a plane crash, highlighting the acute danger of air travel in Russia.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
