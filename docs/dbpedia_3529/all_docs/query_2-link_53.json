        "text": "NHL 23 is, once again, loaded with ice hockey teams from around the world, and not just those featuring in the titular league.\n\nAs you’d assume, though, the NHL and its Alumni teams are the primary draws, but there’s plenty of fun to be had playing as teams from Sweden, Finland, Germany, the QMJHL, or even a lower ranking international side.\n\nHere, you’ll find the goaltending, defence, and offence ratings of every single team in NHL 23, from the Stanley Cup-winning Colorado Avalanche to the All-Star Alumni Association teams.\n\nNHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nThe NHL is loaded with highly-rated teams, with the best of the bunch being the Tampa Bay Lightning and Carolina Hurricanes (both 92 OVR). The second-year Seattle Kraken look to improve from last season with decent ratings across the board.\n\nAHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nIf you want to pick an AHL team with the best goaltending, go for the Ontario Reign and San Jose Barracuda. For some strong defending, go for the Abbotsford Canucks or Belleville Senators, or play as the Charlotte Checkers or Laval Rocket for the best overall teams.\n\nECHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nPlaying in the ECHL, you’ll find three teams pace the league with a team rating of 57 OVR: Florida Everblades, Newfoundland Growlers, and the South Carolina Stingrays. However, the entire 28-team league is packed tightly with overall ratings between 52 and 57.\n\nSHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nThe SHL never fails to present some of the strongest teams in European ice hockey. In NHL 23, Linköping HC have the best overall grade, but the Malmö Redhawks have the next highest defence, while Skellefteå AIK boasts the next best offence.\n\nLiiga Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nThe two best teams by overall ratings are Oulun Kärpät and Rauman Lukko. However, eight of the 15 teams have a 73 rating in goaltending, so scoring in this league may not come as easily.\n\nDEL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nOverall, Adler Mannheim stand-out as the best of the DEL in NHL 23, according to their team ratings.\n\nExtraliga Ledniho Hokeje Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nFor the best Extraliga Ledniho Hokeje team on the attack, NHL 23 has given HC Oceláři Třinec by far the highest rating overall. Like the DEL, eight teams have a top goaltending rating of 73.\n\nNational League Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nThere are 13 teams in the National League, but HC Davos is the best overall by one rating over three other teams.\n\nIce Hockey League Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nThe NHL 23 team ratings for the Ice Hockey League see HCB Sudtirol Alperia as the top team. EC-KAC has the best defence. No team’s offence rates higher than 67.\n\nChampions Hockey League Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nTeams across the ice hockey leagues of Europe compete each season to qualify for the CHL and then aim to become the best on the continent by winning the tournament.\n\nMany of these teams feature in the other licensed competitions of NHL 23, but some of them can’t be played through any other league.\n\nSpengler Cup Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nThe Spengler Cup returns after its introduction in NHL 22. You’ll find some of these teams in other competitions, but sometimes with slightly different ratings.\n\nHockeyAllsvenskan Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nIn the NHL 23 HockeyAllsvenskan team ratings, IF Björklöven and VIK Västerås HK pace the overall ratings. Djurgården Hockey has the top offence by a comfortable three-point margin.\n\nInternational Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nCanada, Russia, Sweden, the USA, and Finland come in as the strongest international teams of the NHL 23 team ratings, as you would expect.\n\nOHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nIn the OHL of NHL 23, all teams are 56 or 57 OVR, making for a competitive league.\n\nQMJHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nIn the NHL 23 team ratings for the QMJHL, the league has all teams either 55 or 56 OVR.\n\nWHL Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nAs is the case with the QMJHL team ratings, NHL 23’s WHL team ratings see many clubs pile into the same top goaltending and offence ratings, but the Edmonton Oil Kings stand out with 63 in goaltending.\n\nProspect Teams Team Ratings in NHL 23\n\nWhile the Top Prospects White side is consistent with 64 ratings in the three categories, the Top Prospects Red are ahead by one point in the offence ratings column though with one point less in defence.\n\nNHL 23 Alumni Team Ratings\n\nThe most storied franchises of the NHL, such as the Habs, Maple Leafs, Red Wings, Rangers, and Kings come in with the best team ratings of the NHL 23 Alumni teams.\n\nNHL 23 Alumni All-Time Team Ratings\n\nThe Alumni All-Time teams have some of the best team ratings of NHL 23, with the All-Time All-Stars, as you’d assume, being the very best in the game with 100 for goaltending, defence, and offence.\n\nThere you have it: that’s every single team in NHL 23 with each of their goaltending, defence, and offence team ratings displayed to help you pick which club to use."
