        "text": "Can someone post like a cliff notes version of the characteristics of each NLA team and compare them to An NHL squad\n\nI’m definitely becoming a Lugano and Davos guy\n\nThis is gonna be hard. Especially since our fan culture is a big part of how the club is perceived by other people. Also since, like most European leagues, the NLA has a promotion/relegation system it doesn't mean that only the big cities have a franchise, some teams are from small towns and even villages. But I'll try to give you a little overview (without an NHL comparison) even though a lot of people probably disagree.\n\nLet's start with the most heated rivalry in Swiss hockey, the teams from the Italian speaking part of Switzerland:\n\n1. HC Ambrì-Piotta *1937 (La Valascia, cap. 7000, *1959):\n\nAmbrì and Piotta are small villages and both part of a municipality called Quinto with a population of just around 1000 people. The municipality is located in the Leventina Valley in the mountainous north of the canton of Ticino. Their arena is open at it's end which, combined with the winds in the valley, makes it probably the coldest arena in western Europe.\n\nThe team usually plays a tactical defense first game since they can't afford losing, as simple as it is.\n\nSadly they have to build a new arena during the next years since \"La Valascia\" is in a potential avalanche path. Ambrì is one of the financially struggling teams in the NLA and are mostly always fighting against relegation but still have the most passionate fans in the league. Their fans are well known for their left-leaning views (Not a usual thing in Swiss hockey culture) and they are heavily influenced by Italian ultra culture. They only made a finals-appearance once in 1999 where they lost against HC Lugano, or as they would call it; LugaNO!\n\n(I may be biased on this. Even though I'm not a fan of the club I frequently visit their games and kind of support them.)\n\n2. HC Lugano *1941 (La Resega, cap. 8000, *1995):\n\nWhile Ambrì is the poor club of the league, their opponents in the canton of Ticino are exactly the opposite. Located at the shores of Lago di Lugano the city is well known as Switzerland's gateway to mediterranean culture. Lugano was the first fully professional team in Swiss Ice Hockey and they have a very successful past where they were known as \"grande Lugano\" (great Lugano) with 7 championships won between 1986 and 2006. But even though they always have a good roster they haven't won anything during the last 13 years, they came closest in 2018 where they lost the finals in game 7 against their rivals from Zürich. Lugano has a pretty balanced team with some very gritty players but also snipers like Fazzini who are able to make the difference on the scoring board.\n\nGames against Ambrì and Zürich are probably the most heated to experience in Lugano and can get pretty rowdy.\n\n3. ZSC Lions *1930 (Hallenstadion, cap. 11'200, *1939):\n\nZürich is, like Lugano, one of the big clubs in Swiss hockey. With 9 championships (6 since 2000) they are on of the most successful teams in the recent times. They won back to back titles in 2000 & and 2001, both against HC Lugano. This, paired with the fact that Zürich is perceived as the city of the snobby German speaking part of Switzerland, makes for a heated rivalry between Zürich and Lugano.\n\nZürich has also won the only Champions League where the KHL participated in 2009. As cherry on the top they then also beat the Chicago Blackhawks for the Victoria Cup. Zürich is known for playing a less gritty but more tactical hockey.\n\nEven though ZSC was known for having a great atmosphere back in the last century and early 2000's it sadly has become the opposite after the renovation of their Arena. Doesn't matter the seats you have, you're always a mile away from the ice. Makes for good view though. And they're currently building a new arena so this will get better soon.\n\n(Pretty biased on this one. I've been a supporter of this club since I got into the old smoke filled arena as a kid in the 90's and I still visit every game of my hometown club.)\n\n4. SC Bern *1931 (PostFinance-Arena, cap. 17'031, *1967):\n\nSC Bern is probably the biggest club in western Europe. They rank highest on avg. attendance outside of the NHL and are the most successful team in recent times with 5 championships since 2010 and 16 since they started playing in 1931. With their huge standing section for over 10'000 people in their arena it can sure be intimidating for visiting teams. Since the whole canton of Bern is pretty nuts for hockey SCB is the go-to club for thousands of people. Especially with the amount of success they had over the years. The club is known for a gritty kind of play and they use this image very offensively in their marketing (\"We play according to a codex: hard, but hard\"). Due to the fact that they very seldomly call up players from their own juniors and are more relying on offering contracts to players from other teams they face criticism from other fans but also their own. Due to their recent success SC Bern is the team you want to beat.\n\n5. SCL Tigers *1946 (Ilfishalle, cap. 6050, *1975):\n\nAnother team from the canton of Bern. Located in the valley of Emmental we have the SCL Tigers from Langnau, a small town with a population of only 9500 people.\n\nThe Tigers are the only pro sports team in this region but they are deeply rooted in the rural region they're coming from. They also market themselves as a more traditional club and play Swiss folk music after the team has scored. Since they got promoted back to the NLA in 2015 the Tigers play a very defense orientated game which is not very spectacular but has gotten them to the playoffs once, and more important, kept them away from being relegated. In their past they have won one championship in 1976.\n\n6. EHC Biel/Bienne *1939 (Tissot-Arena, cap. 6521, *2015):\n\nHere we have the last team from the canton of Bern. EHC Biel/Bienne come from the bilingual city of Biel (as I'd say in Swiss German, or Bienne in French). After being promoted back to the NLA in 2008 the club has transformed to a championship contender nobody wants to play against. They play a very offensively oriented high paced game and due to their former NHL netminder Jonas Hiller they don't get scored on too much. This could transform into a problem since Hiller announced that he will end his career after this season and good goalies are hard to find in Switzerland. With championship titles in 1978, 1981 and 1983 Biel used to have a short era of success in the NLA and I'm pretty convinced that their forth championship title isn't too far from now. Biel, aswell as the SCL Tigers, have a strong rivalry with SC Bern.\n\nI'll do the other half of the teams during the next week, don't know when I'll find time to do so.\n\n7. HC Fribourg-Gottéron *1937 (BCF-Arena, cap. 6500, *1983):\n\nWe stay in the Bernese region but skip cantons to Fribourg where HC Fribourg-Gottéron is located. Just across the so called \"Röstigraben\" in the French speaking part of Switzerland. Fribourg plays in the NLA since the 80's and due to it's location is one of the rivals of SC Bern. At one point in history, during the 90's, Fribourg had unmatched offensive power when they signed Andrei Chomutov and Slawa Bykow and their first championship seemed to only be a matter of time. In the end, they lost 3 finals in a row and couldn't get their hands on the trophy. And they never did 'til now.\n\nThe team plays very defensively and they've received the least goals of all teams this far. Problematic is the fact that they even score less goals than they receive even though their roster is pretty stacked with the likes of Viktor Stålberg, Daniel Brodin and David Desharnais. I guess being a fan of Fribourg means to suffer.\n\n8. HC Lausanne *1922 (Vaudoise Aréna, cap. 9600, *2019):\n\nWe'll stay in the French speaking part a little bit longer with HC Lausanne. Located at the shores of Lake Geneva lies the newly built Vaudoise Arena, the new home of Lausanne's hockey team. They are back in NLA since their successful NLB-season 2012/13 where they got themselves promoted back into the highest league of Switzerland. Since then Lausanne has evolved into a contender for the championship and they are eager for their first championship in the NLA. They used to be known for their unspectacular, even boring, strategic game back when Heinz Ehlers used to be their coach (now SCL Tigers). Nowadays they still have a very strategical kind of play but it relies also on offensive plays.\n\n9. Genève-Servette HC *1905 (Les Vernets, cap. 7200, *1958):\n\nAs the last club of Switzerland's francophone region we have Genéve-Servette. The Team from Geneva plays in the NLA since they took the spot of EHC Chur at the end of the season 2001/02. The man responsible for Geneva's success is Chris McSorley (Marty's brother), he acted as a GM and (!) coach for the team and established a very physical style of play while bringing a lot of north american players with dual citizenship across the pond. Even though Geneva made two appearances in the finals in 2008 and 2010, they did not manage to win a championship yet. But at least they won the prestigious Spengler Cup tournament back to back in 2013 & 2014. The team has to build a new arena during the next years since their old one isn't up to code anymore.\n\n10. HC Davos *1921 (Vaillant Arena, cap. 7080, *1979):\n\nDavos is probably the most popular club in Swiss ice hockey. The team from the mountain resort Davos with a population around 11'000 people is widely liked across the whole country, mostly in the german speaking part. Key factors are probably that a lot of people have already been skiing there, hoisting the prestigious Spengler Cup tournament and being the record holder for the most championships in Switzerland with a whopping 31 (!) times lifting the trophy. Even though a lot of them have been won during periods where a mountain resort simply had a lot of natural advantages in playing ice hockey compared to other places. Especially during the 22 years where Arno Del Curto used to coach in Davos the team became well known for playing incredible fast and skating a lot. This hasn't changed when former U20 national team coach Christian Wohlwend took over in 2019. Notable is their arena, even though during the week games often with miserable attendance, a visit is always worth it since they play i.m.o. in the world's most beautiful rink. It's basically a wooden hockey church.\n\n11. EV Zug *1967 (Bossard Arena, cap. 7200, *2010):\n\nEV Zug has become one of the big clubs in recent years and it's only a matter of time 'til they win their second championship after 1998. During the last years they invested heavily into their youth academy, but also they're building a new state of the art training center and do not shy away from luring successful players from all over to world to play in Zug. The canton of Zug being a tax haven sure helps a bit to convince players and find some sponsors. They play a very offensive game and are second in scoring this season so far with Grégory Hofmann being their point leader. Also they have signed national team goalie Leonardo Genoni and as a backup they have prodigy Luca Hollenstein. But every team has it's weak spot which for Zug is it's defense. But since Dan Tangnes coaches them extremely well I think by the end of the season they are the contender with the best chances to win the championship.\n\n12. SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers *1945 (St. Galler Kantonalbank Arena, cap. 6100, *1987):\n\nThe NLA's \"grey mouse\" are definitely the Lakers. At the south shores of Lake Zurich in Rapperswil-Jona lies the SGKB-Arena which hosts the only big hockey team from the canton of St. Gallen, the Lakers. After being relegated in 2015 the Lakers got promoted again in 2018 by eliminating EHC Kloten in OT in game 7. After a disastrous first season back in the NLA with only 32 of possible 150 points they we're lucky that the NLB-winner couldn't play the promotion/relegation round since their arena isn't up to NLA code. Nonetheless the Lakers play a decent second season right now and even thought they probably gonna miss the playoffs again they are making huge steps into the right direction. If their center Roman Cervenka get's well soon and the team play the defense a bit tighter even a PO-spot could be possible. Sadly they still struggle with miserable attendance figures averaging less than 4000 spectators per game in the league with the highest avg. attendance outside of the NHL."
