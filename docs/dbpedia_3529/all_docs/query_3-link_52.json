        "text": "Danni Stefanetti is an L.A. based award-winning singer-songwriter and virtuoso guitarist with influences ranging from Sheryl Crow and Stevie Ray Vaughn to John Mellencamp, Jewel, The Beatles & The Rolling Stones. Originally from Perth, Australia, Danni started working on her new organic Rock Record with hints of pop, soul, country & Americana in 2023, with tracks starting to become available now, her latest single “You Got Me Thinking Of You” has garneshed worldwide playlists & radio attention. Curious about how the project is coming along, I dropped Danni a line…\n\nYou were doing some recording in Nashville recently, is that right? How did the sessions go?\n\nThe sessions went excellent in Nashville. I had the opportunity to work with & produce the legendary William Lee Golden, of the Oak Ridge Boys. Golden during his 50 plus years of singing has won Grammys, CMA Awards, Dove Awards & many more accolades.\n\nYou’re also working with Jeff Panzer. How did you start working with him? What’s his role in developing your latest project?\n\nJeffrey Panzer, a 45+ year veteran of the music & television industry, saw one of my reels on instagram & was taken by my guitar playing. We later found out we had a mutual friend in the film business who Jeffrey has worked with for over 20 years. Small world :). After meeting with Jeffrey his vision, belief & direction from the day we met has never waivered. We created two Cd’s in the period of 6 months & many videos. He is my co collaborator when it comes to my new songs & oversees all production for me.\n\nIs Rock Record the title of the album?\n\nNo, the title of my latest album is called Danni’s Diamonds. I call it a feel good record. The words & music were basically written over two days. I felt a surge of creativity and just kept on writing songs. My first single “You Got Me Thinking Of You” was a perfect exmple. It took me literally 15 minutes to come up with and then I began learning a week and a half later how to mix, engineer, produce & master. The whole record was recorded is a prolific pace with a great sense urgency.\n\nWhat led you to move toward a bigger sound?\n\nI wanted to rock. With nothing holding me back. I had previously always felt very comfortable with uptempo folk ballads but new I had this rock n roll in my soul. The second part of my answer has to do with the technology which I utilised in a way I had never done before.\n\nYou’re originally from Perth, Australia. What inspired the move to Los Angeles?\n\nAfter having success in Australia, I always loved America. I guess making it Australia has different meanings, but making it in the USA it what all international artists strive for.\n\nHow are the cultures different, and how are you adapting to life in the United States?\n\nIn some respects there are many things that are different, yet many things that are similar. I love living in the United States! I feel a sense of freedom, creativity & a sense of drive to want to succeed been surrounded by the best in my industry.\n\nWe recently saw that you won an award at The Grand Ole Opry, can you tell us about that?\n\nTo me, so far that has been one of the greatest highlights of my career. Just getting nominated was extremely humbling. Walking away with the “Vocalist of The Year” multi genre was such an honor. Been recognised by the Josie Awards (Grammys for independant artists) was a very surreal experience. It showed me over the last year and half, with a strong work ethic, a belief in myself and my belief in great music that you can be awarded for excellence.\n\nYour bio also mentions that you left school at sixteen for a career in show business. Do you think you’ll ever go back to school?\n\nHaha, I doubt it, because I’m learning everyday at the school of music 101. So life has become my school.\n\nWhat are your plans for 2024?\n\nI’m going to leave you on a cliff hanger. ANYTHING & EVERYTHING! So stay tuned and keep an eye on www.dannistefanetti.com for tour dates & many more surprises.\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer my questions!\n\nThank you for having me Marc & congrats on all of your indie rock releases, keep making great music!! Blessings, Danni Stefanetti."
