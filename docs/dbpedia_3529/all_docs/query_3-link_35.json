        "text": "The Bakken Oilers were established in 2012 as a 501c3 non-profit organization. Our goal is to provide an affordable high-level AAA travel hockey experience for advancing players in North Dakota as well as neighboring states and provinces. Our volunteer coaches are at the heart of the organization. Over the years several former NCAA Division I, ACHA Division I, and junior hockey players have given of their time and energy to provide an excellent experience for the players to learn and grow their game. In the programs history they have seen multiple former players advance on to play junior hockey in the NAHL, USHL, BCHL, AJHL, and SJHL. Six alumni are currently playing or have previously played NCAA Division I college hockey. One Alumni is playing in the WHL. Two additional alumni have signed NCAA Division I commitments.\n\nWade Regier has helped coach several Oiler teams over the years. He is currently involved in coaching our 2011 and 2015 teams. Wade played Junior Hockey for the Saskatoon Jr. Chiefs before moving on to play ACHA Division I hockey for the Minot State University Beavers. Where he later went on to coach for 11 seasons. Wade lead the Minot State University Beavers to 2 ACHA Division I National Championships in his 9 seasons as the head coach."
