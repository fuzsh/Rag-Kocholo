        "text": "GRAND FORKS — UND recruit Mac Swanson of the Fargo Force is the United States Hockey League's Player of the Year.\n\nSwanson, who will join the Fighting Hawks this fall, is the seventh UND recruit to win the league's top individual honor.\n\nThe others are Riese Gaber, Jason Gregoire, Chris Fournier, Karl Goehring, Jeff Panzer and Jason Blake. All but Fournier were all-conference players at UND.\n\nSwanson is the first Fargo Force player to be named the USHL Player of the Year. He was previously named USHL Forward of the Year, too.\n\n“Mac had a tremendous season for us,” Fargo head coach Brett Skinner told The Rink Live. “Obviously his talent and ability contribute to his success, but his drive and determination are what separate him from others. His off-ice approach with his daily habits no doubt enabled him to have the consistency he showcased all season.\n\n“He continued to improve as the season went on and was able to play his best hockey towards the end of the season. His relentless work ethic, hockey sense and high-end talent were on full display every night and I’m extremely proud of him for what he was able to accomplish this season.”\n\nSwanson finished his second USHL season with 26 goals and a team-leading 77 points, which tied Jackson Blake for the most by a UND recruit in the USHL in the last 20 years.\n\nSwanson set a single-season franchise record with the 77 points and his 51 assists. He had 132 points (38 goals, 94 assists) over 112 career regular-season games.\n\nSwanson also finished this season with a plus-39 rating — which tied with teammate Leo Gruba for the best mark in the USHL. He was assessed just six penalty minutes as he helped Fargo win a USHL-record 50 games.\n\nThe Anchorage, Alaska, native finished the regular season on a tear, picking up points in 21 of his final 25 games.\n\nSwanson is eligible for the 2024 NHL Draft next month. He was ranked No. 152 among North American skaters in Central Scouting’s final draft rankings.\n\nSwanson currently leads the USHL in playoff scoring as Fargo is playing Dubuque in the Clark Cup Finals."
