        "text": "Defenseman Michael Del Zotto could soon become the fourth locked-out Ranger to make his way overseas. Del Zotto has until Thursday to decide whether to accept an offer to play with Rapperswil-Jona Lakers of the Swiss N.L.A., his agent, Mark Guy, said Tuesday.\n\n“Nothing is signed, and Michael is considering,” Guy said. “The offer from this club is good for 48 hours, so he has to decide in that period.”\n\nGuy said that if he Del Zotto signed to play with Rapperswil-Jona Lakers, his insurance would be covered by Lakers. He also said that Del Zotto turned downed earlier offers from other clubs but that has no other current offers on the table.\n\nThe Ottawa Senators Jason Spezza is playing for the Lakers, in fifth place in the 12-team Swiss N.L.A., during the lockouts. Spezza finished fourth in the N.H.L. scoring last season.\n\nDel Zotto, 22, is coming off his third N.H.L. season, in which he had 10 goals and 41 points and registered a plus-20 mark.\n\nThe other Rangers playing overseas are Rick Nash, also in the Swiss N.L.A. with HC Davos; Ryan McDonagh with Barys Astana of the Russian K.H.L., and Carl Hagelin with Sodertalje SK of the second tier Swedish Allsvenskan."
