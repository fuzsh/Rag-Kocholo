        "text": "The USHL continued its individual awards from the 2023-24 season Friday afternoon with the USHL Player of the Year, presenting the award to Fargo’s Mac Swanson.\n\nIt’s the consecutive day Swanson has won an award, as the North Dakota commit was named the USHL Forward of the Year on Thursday.\n\nSwanson is the first player in Force history to be named the USHL Player of the Year.\n\n“Mac had a tremendous season for us,” Fargo head coach Brett Skinner told The Rink Live. “Obviously his talent and ability contribute to his success, but his drive and determination are what separate him from others. His off-ice approach with his daily habits no doubt enabled him to have the consistency he showcased all season.\n\n“He continued to improve as the season went on and was able to play his best hockey towards the end of the season. His relentless work ethic, hockey sense and high-end talent were on full display every night and I’m extremely proud of him for what he was able to accomplish this season.”\n\nSwanson finished his second USHL season with 26 goals and a team-leading 77 points, which ranked third in the USHL.\n\nSwanson set a single-season franchise record with those 77 points and his 51 assists, and he has 132 points (38-94-132) over 112 career regular-season games. He was named to the USHL All-Rookie First Team last season as he racked up 55 points (12-43-55) over 57 games in his inaugural USHL campaign.\n\nSwanson also finished this season with a +39 rating — which was tied with teammate Leo Gruba for the best mark in the USHL — and was assessed just six penalty minutes, as he helped Fargo win a USHL-record 50 games.\n\nThe Anchorage, Alaska, native finished the regular season on a tear, picking up points in 21 of his final 25 games, and came in at No. 152 among North American skaters in Central Scouting’s final draft rankings.\n\nSwanson has followed it up with a tremendous postseason, as he currently leads the USHL with 12 playoff points. He scored the eventual game-winning goal Sunday night as Fargo earned a 4-0 win over Sioux City, earning its second consecutive trip to the Clark Cup Finals.\n\nFargo hosts Games 1 and 2 against Dubuque this weekend at Scheels Arena.\n\n2022-23 Macklin Celebrini Chicago2021-22 Mitchell Miller Tri-City2020-21Sean FarrellChicago2019-20Riese GaberDubuque2018-19Ronnie AttardTri-City2017-18Anthony Del GaizoMuskegon2016-17Matiss KivlenieksSioux City2015-16Rem PitlickMuskegon2014-15Kyle ConnorYoungstown2013-14Brandon MontourWaterloo2012-13Taylor CammarataWaterloo2011-12Kevin Roy Lincoln2010-11Blake ColemanIndiana2009-10Matt WhiteOmaha2008-09Andrew MillerChicago2007-08Jason GregoireLincoln2006-07Phil DeSimoneSioux City2005-06Trevor LewisDes Moines2004-05Jeff LergOmaha2003-04Mike HoweRiver City2002-03Ryan PotulnyLincoln2001-02Bobby GoepfertCedar Rapids2000-01Chris FournierLincoln1999-00Dan EllisOmaha1998-99Pete FregoeDes Moines1997-98Nate DiCasmirroNorth Iowa1996-97Karl GoehringFargo-Moorhead Ice Sharks1995-96Jeff PanzerFargo-Moorhead Bears(shared 95-96)Matt NogaNorth Iowa1994-95Scott SwansonOmaha1993-94Jason BlakeWaterloo1992-93Eric RudDes Moines1991-92Peter FerraroWaterloo1990-91Gary KitchingThunder Bay1989-90Kurt MillerRochester1988-89Mark KarpenNorth Iowa1987-88Mike O'HaraRochester1986-87Terry MenardThunder Bay1985-86Tim FergusonSioux City1984-85Scott ShoffstallSioux City1983-84Jay CatesSt. Paul\n\nThe USHL will finish its award announcements next Wednesday with the Curt Hammer Award and USHL Student Athlete of the Year.\n\nThe full award schedule can be found below.\n\nWed.
