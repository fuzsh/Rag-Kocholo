        "text": "ASKER, Norway (August 18) - University of Denver senior-to-be Bjorn Engstrom (Akarp, Sweden) scored a goal and classmate Kelly Popadynetz (Calgary, Alberta) assisted on another tally as the Western Collegiate Hockey Association All-Star Team defeated host Frisk Asker, 7-1, at Askerhallen in Asker, Norway. It was the second straight international victory for the WCHA All-Stars, who also defeated the Lillehammer Hockey Club, 5-0, on Wednesday.\n\nTwo of the WCHA All-Stars' six third period goals came while shorthanded - and both on the same Frisk Asker power-play - and enabled them to carve out a 3-1 advantage after trailing 1-0 early in the second. The two shorthanded goals came from Engstrom on an unassisted effort 1:47 into the period and then from North Dakota's Bryan Lundbohm, with an assist from fellow UND forward Jeff Panzer, just 1:08 later.\n\nThose two shorthanded tallies ignited the all-stars, who then proceeded to score four more times over the final 16:34. After the two shorthanders, the WCHA All-Stars got goals from Mankato State's Jesse Rooney at 43:26, from Minnesota's Erik Westrum at 44:22, from Michigan Tech's Paul Cabana at 52:34, and from Minnesota-Duluth's Derek Derow at 53:06.\n\nOn the night, the WCHA All-Stars received goals from seven different players, outshot Frisk Asker by a 43-27 margin, and killed off all four of the Tigers' power-play chances. Over the first two games of the tour now, the WCHA All-Stars have outscored their two opponents 12-1, outshot them 87-42, and successfully stymied them on all nine power-plays.\n\nAnd so, much to the delight of the two dozen WCHA fans celebrating in the crowd - including the parents of Engstrom, UND's Karl Goehring and Wisconsin's Alex Brooks, and the grandparents of Lundbohm - the final tally on the scoreboard tonight read: Gjester (Guests) 7, Hjemme (Home) 1.\n\nOn Saturday, the WCHA All-Stars will wrap-up their trip to Norway with their toughest match of the tour when they take on Valerenga IF at 3:30 p.m. local time in Oslo.\n\nWCHA All-Stars 7 vs Frisk Asker Tigers 1\n\nAskerhallen @ Frisk, Norway\n\nScoring Summary\n\nFirst Period: 1, FA, Mika Kannisto (Lars Erik Lund, Toringe Meltveit), 8:24.\n\nSecond Period: 2, WCHA, Mat Snesrud (Derek Derow ), 2:11. Third Period: 3, WCHA, Bjorn Engstrom (unassisted), SHG, 1:47; 4, WCHA, Bryan Lundbohm (Jeff Panzer), SHG, 2:55; 5, WCHA, Jesse Rooney (Mark Cullen, Jordan Leopold), 3:26; 6, WCHA, Erik Westrum (Kelly Popadynetz), 4:22; 7, WCHA, Paul Cabana (Jeff Panzer), 12:34; 8, WCHA, Derek Derow (Andy Reierson), 13:06."
