        "text": "Mike Mottau, the Boston College defenseman and a draft pick of the Rangers, beat out two teammates and seven others yesterday to win the Hobey Baker award as the top player in college hockey.\n\n''I think he'll be right up there with Doug Flutie, Dana Barros and David Emma as ambassadors for Boston College,'' Eagles Coach Jerry York said. ''We're certainly pleased to have him on our team.''\n\nMottau is the third defenseman to win in the award's 20-year history, joining Harvard's Mark Fusco (1983) and Minnesota-Duluth's Tom Kurvers (1984).\n\nThe finalists included two of Mottau's teammates, Brian Gionta and Jeff Farkas -- just the second time three teammates have been among the finalists. Boston College will play North Dakota and the Hobey Baker finalist, Jeff Panzer, for the N.C.A.A. title at the Providence Civic Center tonight."
