        "text": "\"Calder\" City?\n\nWritten By: EdenCreative\n\nSixteen teams. Four rounds. One champion. Only time will tell if the Griffins can bring the Calder Cup home to the city that shares its moniker. For now, here's what you need to know about the 2005 Calder Cup Playoffs.\n\nThe top four teams in each division will qualify for postseason play, and all series will be best of seven. For teams located within 300 highway miles, the series will be played in a 2-2-1-1-1 format. For teams located more than 300 highway miles apart, the series will use a 2-3-2 format. Higher-seeded teams (by points) will have home ice advantage in the conference finals and Calder Cup finals.\n\n1. Division Semifinals – Within each division, the 1st place team plays the 4th place team, while the 2nd place team faces the 3rd place team.\n\n2. Division Finals\n\n3. Conference Finals – The winners of the West and North Divisions will play for the Western Conference title (Robert W. Clarke Trophy), while the champions of the Atlantic and East Divisions will face off for the Eastern Conference crown (Richard F. Canning Trophy).\n\n4. Calder Cup Finals\n\nTicket Info\n\nGriffins playoff tickets for Games A and B only will go on sale to the general public once the team clinches a spot in the chase for the 2005 Calder Cup. Single-game prices are $6 (in advance only), $14, $16, $18, $21 and $26. Once on sale, tickets may be purchased at all Star Tickets Plus locations (616) 222-4000, including West Michigan Meijer stores and The Zone inside Van Andel Arena. For more information, call the Griffins at (616) 774-4585 or visit griffinshockey.com.\n\nCalder Cups Among Active Franchises\n\n8 - Hershey Bears (1997, 1988, 1980, 1974, 1969, 1959, 1958, 1947)\n\n6 - Rochester Americans (1996, 1987, 1983, 1968, 1966, 1965)\n\n1 - Albany River Rats (1995), Chicago Wolves (2002), Hartford Wolf Pack (2000), Houston Aeros (2003), Milwaukee Admirals (2004), Philadelphia Phantoms (1998), Portland Pirates (1994) and Providence Bruins (1999)\n\nStrange But True\n\nEach of the last three Calder Cup champions hailed from the AHL’s West Division: Milwaukee in 2004, Houston in 2003 and Chicago in 2002. Those three teams – along with Grand Rapids, Manitoba and Utah – joined the AHL in 2001, giving former IHL teams a lock on the Cup ever since.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, every team that eliminated the Griffins from the playoffs went on to hoist the cup: Chicago (2000 IHL), Orlando (2001 IHL), Chicago (2002) and Houston (2003). That streak ended last season when the Wolves were bounced by eventual Calder Cup champion Milwaukee in the division finals.\n\nSenior Statesman\n\nTravis Richards is the only Griffin who has played in all 59 playoff games in team history. The other 23 players on Grand Rapids’ roster as of early March had combined to appear in 106 postseason games for the franchise, an average of just under five games per man. Among active Griffins, Darryl Bootland and Ryan Barnes are tied for second with 19 games apiece.\n\nBeen There, Won That\n\nThe honor roll of Griffins who have won major playoff championships at the pro or amateur level in North America includes six players, including two who claimed their championships exactly 10 years ago:\n\nGreg Amadio - 2003 President’s Cup (Central League) with Memphis\n\nBryan Helmer - 1995 Calder Cup with Albany\n\nDerek Meech - 2001 Memorial Cup (CHL) with Red Deer\n\nKip Miller - 1995 Turner Cup (IHL) with Denver\n\nJeff Panzer - 2000 NCAA with North Dakota\n\nBlake Sloan - 1999 Stanley Cup with Dallas, 1996 NCAA with Michigan"
