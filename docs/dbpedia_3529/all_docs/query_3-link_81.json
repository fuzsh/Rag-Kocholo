        "text": "EAST GRAND FORKS– Seldom do childhood dreams become reality. Jaksen Panzer’s dream is coming true at the rink.\n\n“I mean growing up, I just wanted to play hockey. I didn’t think of anything more than that, not committing or playing juniors. It was mostly just play hockey and have fun. It just works out sometimes,” said Panzer.\n\nIt’s almost like Jaksen was destined to be a star on the ice.\n\n“Obviously growing up in East Grand Forks, the Panzer name was a pretty common household name. I was fortunate enough my freshman year at UND, I played with Jeff, Jaksen’s dad,” said East Grand Forks Head Hockey Coach, Tyler Palmascino.\n\n“My dad played there, my uncle played there, family, it’s in the blood,” said Panzer.\n\nThree years ago, when Jaksen was just 14-years-old, he already felt like he was ready to join that Panzer hockey tradition. This was just a month before the NCAA changed its commitment policy. Now athletes cannot give verbal commitments until at least the end of their sophomore year of high school.\n\n“I never thought I was going to be at the UND level growing up. I always wanted to but I never thought it was actually going to happen and then when it really happened, I was like ‘oh I got to keep this up’ and I got to play my full potential every time that I play hockey,” said Panzer.\n\n“That can be a huge weight on a kid’s shoulders when you commit at that age, because the commitment is based on potential. It’s not based on who you are at age 14, because 14-year-olds can’t play division one hockey. He has really matured as an individual,” said Palmascino.\n\nEast Grand Forks is now home to Jaksen.After moving to the area a few years ago, it didn’t take long for him to make an impact for the Green Wave varsity team.\n\n“It’s been so fun for me the last three years to see Jaksen slowly become, I almost call him a mini Jeffy in a lot of ways. He reminds me so much of his dad, and it’s really taken another level this year, with his humor and his mannerisms off the ice,” said Palmascino.\n\nOthers are also taking notice of Panzer's talent. Last season, Jaksen had a taste of next level hockey. He played one game for Minot in the North American Hockey League. Come summer, Panzer was offered to return to the Minotauros. It was a chance he couldn’t pass up.\n\n“It was just a really big eye opener for me. It was just so fun to be able to play hockey and then get to know new guys. I was lucky enough to have my cousin Braeden with me. It just felt more normal and normal as it went on,” said Panzer.\n\n“I made that decision at the end of July. I just felt like that was going to be the best for my development hockey wise and everything. I was lucky enough to just step in and play my game with nothing having to change, so that’s how I was able to have success there,” he added.\n\nEven after scoring 18 points in the first 16 games, Jaksen knew something was missing. Minot was a great opportunity, but it just wasn’t home.\n\n“Obviously I had the option to stay in Minot all year, but the big thing weighing me was to come back here. I had unfinished business here with these guys and they were counting on me to come back and help them,\n\nand I knew what I wanted to do the entire time,” said Panzer.\n\n“Honestly, we didn’t know if Jaksen was going to stay in Minot or not. The conversations we had with Jaksen, we had them with Jeff along the way throughout the summer and fall. We really left the decision up to them. We would be a lot different team without him,” said Palmascino.\n\nEast Grand Forks made it to the state semifinals last year. But it’s the feeling of being one game short of the title that fueled Jaksen to not step away from his second family.\n\n“There’s a little pressure, I mean coming back. I mean I am expected to succeed here. I know people are counting on me in big situations, which I mean I like that, I like the pressure but I mean it’s also sometimes you get a little frustrated. But I just try to not let that stuff bother me and I just like to go out there and have fun and play,” said Panzer.\n\n“We got Hockey Day Minnesota, all these kids grow up wanting to play in that and having the opportunity to do that. Then the atmosphere, it wasn't how it should be at the X last year. I mean just being able to play there I was like ‘woah this is awesome’. I just had to come back and have another shot at it,” Panzer added.\n\nJaksen knows the day is coming when he’ll take on the challenges of being a Panzer playing UND hockey. For now, he’s focused on finishing what he started with his Green Wave family.\n\n“I just hope that I will be able to follow in their (dad and uncle) footsteps and do what they did at the program, because they have left a really good mark there. I want to be able to play at that level my whole life and I just want to continue to get better and better,” said Panzer."
