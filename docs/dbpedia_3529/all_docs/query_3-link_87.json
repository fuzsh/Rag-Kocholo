        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, MI – While the Grand Rapids Griffins are strapped with their longest road trip of the AHL season through April 10, the NCAA Division I ice hockey West Regional will be contested Friday and Saturday, March 29 and 30, in Van Andel Arena.\n\nFriday’s games have No. 4 Yale (18-12-3) against No. 1 Minnesota (26-8-5) at 2 p.m., followed at 5:30 p.m. by No. 2 North Dakota (21-12-7) against No. 3 Niagara (23-9-5).\n\nThe winners meet 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nHowever, the Griffins don’t have to be out of mind – and probably shouldn’t be considering they’re crushing the Midwest Division heading into Thursday’s game at San Antonio.\n\nSo, here are five trivia questions to test your knowledge of the Griffins and the NCAA tournament, compliments of Randy Cleves, Griffins senior director of media relations:\n\nWhich current Griffin won a pair of NCAA Division I championships?\n\nFour future members of the Griffins – Bryan Lundbohm, Jeff Panzer, Aaron Schneekloth and Tim Skarperud – played for which school’s 2000 national championship team?\n\nKyle Rogers is the only player in Griffins history to hail from what school?\n\nWho are the only two players in Griffins history to come out of Yale?\n\nMinnesota is one of several schools that has produced seven players who went on the play for the Griffins, including Travis Richards, Grand Rapids’ all-time leader in games played. What are the only three schools that have had more alumni play for the Griffins?\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. Defenseman Brett Skinner (2004 and 2005, Denver); 2. North Dakota; 3. Niagara; 4. Dave Baseggio and John Emmons; 5. Michigan State (15), Michigan (11) and Notre Dame (9)\n\nRELATED:"
