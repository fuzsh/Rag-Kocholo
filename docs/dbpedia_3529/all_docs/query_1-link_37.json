        "text": "Media Cube\n\nThe Media Cube as such will be the first of its kind in the National League in Switzerland and will lift the overall experience significantly compared to traditional media cubes. Higher resolution, larger display area and visible effects in 360-degrees are some of the features the audience will experience. Furthermore, Rapperswil-Jona Lakers invested in a new TV studio to enhance the experience for the audience even more. The control system is completely Mac-based and fully scalable for future expansions.\n\nThe design and excellent picture quality together with the easy operation of the media cube will play a significant role in the overall experience. The goal is to enhance the audience experience and make it extraordinary.\n\n“We are pleased to replace the existing cube after more than 12 years and improve the experience for our viewers with state-of-the-art technology. This will also create an extremely attractive platform for sponsors and partners. The concept of a 360 degree cube has convinced us in its effect”, says Markus Bütler, CEO SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers.\n\niCast strengthens its market position in Europe\n\niCast Sweden AB has in recent years expanded its reference list, and is a prominent competitor when it comes to arena productions and sporting entertainment in Europe. The collaboration further strengthens our position in the market for future procurements in Europe.\n\n“We are proud to welcome Rapperswil-Jona Lakers as a new customer and look forward to a good cooperation with the St. Galler Kantonalbank Arena and the hockey club. St. Galler Kantonalbank Arena is the second arena in Switzerland that invests in our unique seamless media cube to enhance the experience for their events. In addition to Switzerland clubs, the Swedish Hockey League, the Norwegian and German hockey leagues have also invested in media technology from iCast. The demand for our media system remains high, and with this new contract, we are looking forward to new challenges in Switzerland, says Mats Hultemark from iCast."
