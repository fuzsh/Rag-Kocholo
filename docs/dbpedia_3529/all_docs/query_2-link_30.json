        "text": "A former Red Wings player has been suspended after his skate contacted the head and neck area of an opponent during a game in Switzerland.\n\nMartin Frk, a Czech winger drafted by Detroit in 2012, received a 5-game ban for his actions during a game between the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers and Lausanne HC on Dec. 8. He was also fined.\n\nSwitzerland’s National League announced his suspension on Monday, noting that Frk violated International Ice Hockey Federation rule No. 49, which relates to “kicking.”\n\nFrk, who played for both the AHL’s Grand Rapids Griffins and the Red Wings between 2013 and 2019, can be seen on video attempting to check Lawrence Pilut near the bench area. However, he misses the check, sending his legs upward as he enters the bench area.\n\nWhile he is up on the dasher, Pilut gives him an extra push. Frk than swings his legs wildly and with his right skate, makes forceful contact with Pilut’s neck/head area.\n\n“The final swing/kick with his right leg is a lot different,” the league said in the announcement. “His leg is extended and kicks back high and towards his opponent who is behind him. He knows he is there because he just had his hands on him. Contact to any part of the body especially this area can have grave consequences. This action is very dangerous and reckless and cannot be tolerated. Pilut is very fortunate he was not seriously injured.”\n\nMany in the hockey world took to social media to clamor for a longer suspension considering the dangerous nature of the play. And recent events are also likely contributing to the outrage.\n\nAdam Johnson, an American who played in 13 NHL games with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2019 and 2020, died after his neck was cut by a skate blade during a game in October.\n\nFrk also played briefly for the Carolina Hurricanes and Los Angeles Kings. He had 20 goals and had 21 assists in 124 career games."
