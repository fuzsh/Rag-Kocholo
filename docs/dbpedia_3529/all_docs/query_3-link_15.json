        "text": "GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- Jaksen Panzer has been attending University of North Dakota hockey games for as long as he can remember.\n\nHe's been hearing stories from his father, Jeff, and uncle, Jay, who were members of NCAA national championship teams for UND.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, April 2, he decided to take the same path as his family members.\n\nOn Twitter, Jaksen Panzer said: \"Super excited to announce my commitment to play Division I hockey at the University of North Dakota and to carry on the Sioux tradition in my family. Thank you to all my family, coaches, teammates and all those who have supported me along the way.\"\n\nPanzer, an eighth-grader, became one of UND's youngest-ever recruits when he gave a verbal commitment to play for UND in the future.\n\n\"My family has been through there,\" Jaksen said. \"My dad said it was his best days of hockey. He had a blast. He won a national championship. He said it was super fun going to the rink and playing.\"\n\nJaksen, 5-foot-9, 159 pounds, played for the Grand Forks Aviators bantam team this season, piling up 118 points in 48 games. He'll play prep hockey next season.\n\n\"He's a big, strong, powerful skater,\" said Jeff, who played at UND from 1997-01 and was a two-time All American and Hobey Baker Award finalist. \"He's bigger than I am, probably by three inches. He probably outweighs me. But he skates as well as I do. He plays fast. He plays hard and heavy. And he competes like nobody else.\n\n\"We're not the same player. We might have the same skating and the same type of work ethic, but his physical attributes at his age are different. He's already bigger than me. I don't know how much bigger he's going to get, but he's going to play bigger than me when I was there.\"\n\nJaksen is the second 2004-born player from Greater Grand Forks to commit in as many days. On Monday, East Grand Forks Senior High defenseman Trey Ausmus, the brother of 2016 UND national champion Gage, committed to the Fighting Hawks.\n\n\"These kids, they dream about it, especially the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks kids,\" Jeff said. \"I've been there and it's a very special place to play. Once you've played there, it's a family you never get away from and it just continues to grow. I'm super proud and excited for him.\"\n\nJeff had one piece of advice for Jaksen after his commitment.\n\n\"I told him this is when the hard work begins,\" Jeff said. \"One box is checked. Now, it's about doing the things to improve every day and get better so when it's your time, you're ready to go.\"\n\nJaksen, who shoots left-handed, has played both wing and center. He's also heard some comparisons to his dad.\n\n\"People say that our skating is almost identical and that we both work super hard,\" Jaksen said."
