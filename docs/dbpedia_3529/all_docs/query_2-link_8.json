        "text": "Anthony Stewart (born on January 5, 1985 in LaSalle, Quebec, Canada) is a Canadian former ice hockey player who played in the NHL for the Florida Panthers, Atlanta Thrashers and the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nStewart was drafted by the Panthers 25th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPlaying Career[]\n\nEarly Playing Career[]\n\nAnthony played minor hockey for the North York Canadians. He played so well that the cost of his hockey was subsidized personally by the head of the organization. With him on the team, the North York Canadians won three all-Ontario championships. He played in the 1999 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with North York.\n\nAfter finishing his minor hockey career, Anthony was selected by the Kingston Frontenacs in the first round of the OHL draft. In his first season in the OHL, he scored 19 goals and 43 points. In the 2002–03 season, he increased his tally to 38 goals and 70 points, then added seven more points in five playoff games.\n\nIn the off-season, he was named captain of the Frontenacs and was drafted in the first round of the NHL Entry Draft. Going into the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, he was rated as the 19th best prospect among North American skaters. With their second first round draft pick, the 25th overall, the Florida Panthers selected him.\n\nWhile the Frontenacs missed the playoffs the following season, Anthony scored a career high 35 goals. He attended the Panthers' training camp prior to the start of the 2004–05 OHL season. He performed impressively there but was sent back to Kingston to help his growth as a player.\n\nIn his last OHL season, Anthony led the Frontenacs' scoring with 67 points. After the Frontenacs failed to make the playoffs for the second consecutive year, he made his professional debut, playing 10 games for the AHL team San Antonio Rampage, during which he scored a goal and two assists.\n\nProfessional[]\n\nAnthony began the 2005–06 season in the AHL with the Rochester Americans. After four games he was called up by the Panthers, making his NHL debut on October 18, 2005, against New Jersey. During the game, he recorded his first NHL career point, an assist.\n\nTwo days later he recorded the first NHL goal of his career, against Washington Capitals' goaltender Olaf Kolzig. He played ten games, scoring two goals and three points before injuring his wrist when he crashed into the boards after a check by Carolina Hurricanes' defenceman Mike Commodore. The injury required surgery and ended Stewart's season.\n\nThe following year for Anthony was spent mainly in the AHL, playing in 62 games and registering 13 goals and 27 points. He appeared in ten games with the Panthers, registering just one assist.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season he spent more time in the NHL, playing in 26 games for Florida and again only registering one assist. While in the AHL, he played against his brother Chris (then a member of the Lake Erie Monsters); it was the first time they had faced each other in an organized hockey game.\n\nAnthony scored a goal and an assist in the game, and Rochester defeated Lake Erie 3–2. He finished the season with 31 points from 54 games. In the 2008–09 NHL season, for the first time in his career, he played no games in the minor leagues. He played in 59 games for the Panthers, scoring 2 goals and 7 points.\n\nIn the off-season, Anthony left the Panthers as a free agent and signed with the Atlanta Thrashers.[16] After the 2009 pre-season he was assigned to the Thrashers' AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves.\n\nDuring his first year with them, Anthony achieved AHL career highs in games played (77) and assists (19), and equalled his career high in points (31). He played the entire 2010–11 season with the Thrashers, scoring his first career hat-trick in a game against the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nAnthony's third goal tied the game 4–4, and the Thrashers went on to win the game in a shootout. During that season, he set both NHL career highs and professional career highs in games played and in every major offensive statistical category.\n\nWhen the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg, the Winnipeg Jets opted not to submit a qualifying offer for Anthony, making him an unrestricted free agent. He signed a two-year, US$1.8 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 2, 2011.\n\nAfter the first 50 games with the Hurricanes, Anthony recorded 6 goals and 13 points, while playing mostly on the fourth line. Despite leading the team with a +4 rating Carolina placed him on waivers. He cleared waivers the following day and remained with the team. He finished the year with 9 goals and 20 points in 77 games, while his plus-minus rating fell to -2.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012–13 season, the NHL enforced a lockout. Three weeks into the labor dispute, he signed with the Nottingham Panthers of the Elite Ice Hockey League in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnthony stated that he signed with the team as a way of staying in game shape. He played 19 games for Nottingham recording 11 points. Upon the conclusion of the lockout Carolina traded him to the Los Angeles Kings (along with two draft picks) in exchange for Kevin Westgarth.\n\nLos Angeles did not play Anthony in their opening game and placed him on waivers prior to their next game. He cleared waivers and was assigned to the Kings minor league affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs. The move allowed the Kings to activate Anze Kopitar off of their non-roster list.\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Anthony initially signed a one-year contract with Russian club, Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the KHL. In failing to establish himself within Avtomobilist, scoring just 1 goals in 19 games, he was mutually released from his contract to join Swiss club, HC Fribourg-Gottéron of the National League A, on a monthly basis contract on December 16, 2013.\n\nHe contributed with 8 points in 12 games before he continued his unsettled season, joining his third club and NLA strugglers, Rapperswil-Jona Lakers in a brief stint to end the year.\n\nOn August 4, 2014, Anthony returned for another attempt in the KHL, signing a trial contract as a free agent with Croatian club, KHL Medveščak Zagreb. He was released from his try-out after 12 games with the club on October 14, 2014.\n\nCareer Statistics[]\n\nRegular season and playoffs[]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 2000–01 North York Canadiens GTHL 34 30 70 100 — — — — — — 2000–01 St. Michael's Buzzers OPJHL 5 0 2 2 0 — — — — — 2001–02 Kingston Frontenacs OHL 65 19 24 43 12 1 0 0 0 0 2002–03 Kingston Frontenacs OHL 68 32 38 70 47 — — — — — 2003–04 Kingston Frontenacs OHL 53 35 23 58 76 5 3 4 7 7 2004–05 Kingston Frontenacs OHL 62 32 35 67 70 — — — — — 2004–05 San Antonio Rampage AHL 10 1 2 3 14 — — — — — 2005–06 Rochester Americans AHL 4 2 3 5 0 — — — — — 2005–06 Florida Panthers NHL 10 2 1 3 2 — — — — — 2006–07 Rochester Americans AHL 62 13 14 27 64 6 2 0 2 2 2006–07 Florida Panthers NHL 10 0 1 1 2 — — — — — 2007–08 Rochester Americans AHL 54 13 18 31 61 — — — — — 2007–08 Florida Panthers NHL 26 0 1 1 0 — — — — — 2008–09 Florida Panthers NHL 59 2 5 7 34 — — — — — 2009–10 Chicago Wolves AHL 77 13 18 31 67 13 9 3 12 6 2010–11 Atlanta Thrashers NHL 80 14 25 39 55 — — — — — 2011–12 Carolina Hurricanes NHL 77 9 11 20 30 — — — — — 2012–13 Nottingham Panthers EIHL 19 6 5 11 14 — — — — — 2012–13 Manchester Monarchs AHL 30 4 3 7 31 4 1 0 1 0 2013–14 Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg KHL 19 1 1 2 6 — — — — — 2013–14 HC Fribourg-Gottéron NLA 12 3 5 8 20 — — — — — 2013–14 Rapperswil-Jona Lakers NLA 2 0 1 1 0 — — — — — 2014–15 KHL Medveščak Zagreb KHL 12 1 1 2 6 — — — — — 2015–16 Jonquière Marquis LNAH 12 3 8 11 16 11 9 1 10 8 AHL totals 234 45 59 104 237 23 12 3 15 8 NHL totals 262 27 44 71 123 — — — — —\n\nInternational[]\n\nYear Team Event Result GP G A Pts PIM 2002 Canada Ontario U17 Template:Brca 6 5 1 6 0 2003 Canada WJC18 Template:Goca 7 6 0 6 6 2004 Canada WJC Template:Sica 6 5 6 11 2 2005 Canada WJC Template:Goca 6 3 1 4 0 Junior totals 25 19 8 27 8\n\nInternational Play[]\n\nAnthony first played internationally at the 2002 World U-17 Hockey Challenge representing Ontario. In the tournament, Team Ontario won a bronze medal, defeating team Quebec 5–2 in the medal round.\n\nDuring 2002, Anthony also made his first appearance for Team Canada playing in the non-IIHF sanctioned Eight Nations Cup, helping the team win a gold medal. He made his IIHF international debut playing for Canada in the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships in Yaroslavl, Russia.\n\nDuring the tournament, he scored six goals, tying for fourth place in tournament scoring. His scoring success ranked him as the top goal-scoring Canadian; however, he contributed no assists, and finished third on the team in points\n\nThe Canadian team finished the preliminary round with a 2–2–1 record. In the elimination round they defeated the Slovakian team 3–0 to win the gold medal.\n\nAt the end of the tournament, Anthony was named to the All-Star team. Later that year Stewart represented the OHL in the 2003 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge. He scored one goal, helping the OHL win both their games, which contributed to a 5–1 series win for the Canadian Hockey League.\n\nThe following year, he was selected to play for Canada in the 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Helsinki and Hämeenlinna, Finland. Canada went unbeaten in the preliminary round and advanced to the final of the elimination round where they faced the United States team.\n\nDuring the second period of the final, Anthony scored a goal to put Canada ahead 3–1. It was his third point of the game, as he had made assists in the two previous goals. However, Canada conceded three goals in the third period, losing 4–3 and receiving the silver medal.\n\nAnthony finished the tournament with 11 points, tying teammate Nigel Dawes and US player Zach Parise for the tournament lead in points scored. Having scored one more goal than Anthony and Parise, Dawes was officially named the tournament's leading scorer.\n\nLater in the year, Anthony was selected to play in the 2004 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge as part of the OHL All-Stars team. He was later named an alternate captain and scored a short handed goal in the OHL's second game of the series, a 5–2 win. The OHL won both of its games in the series, helping the CHL to a 4–2 win in the series.\n\nIn 2005, Anthony was again selected to play for Canada in the World Junior Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Unlike in previous years, he struggled at this tournament; in the second game, he was relegated to 13th forward.\n\nAn injury to teammate Jeremy Colliton allowed Anthony to play in the following game, in which he scored two goals, contributing to a 9–0 defeat of the German team. Once more, Canada had an undefeated run to the final, where they faced Russia. In the final, he scored the fifth goal in a 6–1 win for Canada, earning him his third international gold medal.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nAnthony is the son ofn Norman and Sue Stewart; Norman immigrated to Canada from Toronto, working seasonal jobs such as landscaping & construction, and Sue was a stay-at-home mother. He is the oldest of seven children; his brother, Chris currently plays in the AHL for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms.\n\nThe Stewarts moved to Toronto the year after Anthony's birth. During his childhood, they were evicted from their home and moved to a subsidized shelter in what has been described as a \"rough\" neighbourhood of Scarborough. He began skating at the age of four and playing hockey at the age of five.\n\nAs a young hockey player, Anthony would often walk with his father to hockey games and practices. On one such occasion, the two were walking in a blizzard when they were picked up by a fellow hockey parent, Bob Ziemendorf, who was driving his child to the same place. Ziemendorf drove them home again after the practice; from then on, he regularly gave the family lifts and helped them with the cost of hockey and groceries.\n\nDuring a particularly trying time for the family, Anthony moved in with Ziemendorf and his family for over a year and a half. He later stated that he believed that without this help, he could not have got into the NHL."
