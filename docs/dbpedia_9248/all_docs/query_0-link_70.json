The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997 - which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's adult population - triggered unrest in much of the south in early 1997. The economy continues to be buoyed by remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. Overall economic performance is likely to be substantially worse in 1997; inflation will easily top 50% and GDP may drop by 5% or more.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $10.5 billion (2000 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 7.5% (2000 est.)\n\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity -$3,000 (2000 est.)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\nagriculture: 55%\n\nindustry: 24%\n\nservices: 21% (2000)\n\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 17.4% (1996)\n\nLabor force:\n\ntotal: 1.692 million (1994 est.)
