        "text": "The Albanian lek is gaining stronger positions in the exchange rates against major currencies.\n\nAt the Bank of Albania’s exchange rate, the US dollar has fallen below the 100 lek threshold for the first time since 2011.\n\nThe US currency is being exchanged at 99.1 lek, while the declining trend is also followed by the euro, which is currently being exchanged at 106.4 lek.\n\nThe British pound has also experienced a significant decline, reaching a historic low of 124.3 lek in the exchange rate, since the central bank began keeping records.\n\nFor economists, the fact that the euro has been devalued so much against the lek also explains the depreciation of the dollar and pound.\n\nThe currency’s decline is making the Albanian lek stronger. These developments tend to make imports from abroad cheaper.\n\nThe euro is the dominant currency in trade exchanges, but the US dollar also plays an important role, especially in the markets for raw materials and fuels.\n\nHowever, just like with the euro, the strengthening of the Albanian lek is affecting exporters who purchase goods in the US."
