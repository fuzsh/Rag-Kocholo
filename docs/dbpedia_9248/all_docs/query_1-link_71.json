        "text": "What is a travel money card?\n\nA travel money card is a card you can use for secure and convenient payments and withdrawals overseas.\n\nYou can use a travel money card to tap and pay in stores and restaurants, with a wallet like Apple Pay, or to make ATM withdrawals so you'll always have a bit of cash in your pocket when you travel.\n\nAlthough there are lots of different travel money cards on the market, all of which are unique, one similarity you'll spot is that the features and fees have always been optimised for international use. That might mean you get a better exchange rate compared to using your normal card overseas, or that you run into fewer fees for common international transactions like ATM withdrawals.\n\nTravel money cards also offer distinct benefits when it comes to security. Your travel money card isn't linked to your Australian Dollar everyday account, so even if you were unlucky and had your card stolen, your primary bank account remains secure.\n\nTravel money vs prepaid card vs travel credit card\n\nIt's helpful to know that you'll be able to pick from several different types of travel cards, depending on your priorities and preferences. Travel cards commonly include:\n\nTravel debit cards\n\nTravel prepaid cards\n\nTravel credit cards\n\nThey all have distinct benefits when you head off to Albania or elsewhere in the world, but they do work a bit differently.\n\nTravel debit and prepaid cards are usually linked to an online account, and may come from specialist digital providers - like the Wise card. These cards are usually flexible and cheap to use. You'll be able to manage your account and card through an app, although you can also often add money in person by visiting a branch - we've picked out the Westpac travel card and the Travelex travel card as popular prepaid cards with a branch network in Australia, for example.\n\nTravel credit cards are different and may suit different customer needs. As with any other credit card, you may need to pay an annual fee or interest and penalties depending on how you manage your account - but you could also earn extra rewards when spending in a foreign currency, or travel benefits like free insurance for example. Generally using a travel credit card can be more expensive compared to a debit or prepaid card - but it does let you spread out the costs of your travel across several months if you'd like to and don't mind paying interest to do so.\n\nWhat is a prepaid travel money card best for?\n\nLet's take a look at the advantages of using a prepaid travel money card for travellers going to Albania. While each travel card is a little different, you'll usually find some or all of the following benefits:\n\nHold and exchange foreign currencies - allowing you to lock in exchange rates and set a travel budget before you leave\n\nConvenient for spending in person and through mobile wallets like Apple Pay, as well as for cash withdrawals\n\nYou may find you get a better exchange rate compared to your bank - and you'll usually be able to avoid any foreign transaction fee, too\n\nTravel cards are secure as they're not linked to your everyday AUD account - and because you can make ATM withdrawals when you need to, you can also avoid carrying too much cash at once\n\nOverall, travel cards offer flexible and low cost ways to avoid bank foreign transaction and international ATM fees, while accessing decent exchange rates.\n\nHow to choose the best travel card for Albania\n\nWe've picked out 2 great travel cards available in Australia - but there are also more options available, which can make choosing a daunting task. Some things to consider when picking a travel card for Albania include:\n\nWhat exchange rates does the card use? Choosing one with the mid-market rate or as close as possible to it is usually a smart plan\n\nWhat fees are unavoidable? For example, ATM charges or top up fees for your preferred top up methods\n\nDoes the card support a good range of currencies? Getting a card which allows you to hold and spend in ALL can give you the most flexibility, but it's also a good idea to pick a card with lots of currency options, so you can use it again in future, too\n\nAre there any other charges? Check in particular for foreign transaction fees, local ATM withdrawal fees, inactivity fees and account close fees\n\nUltimately the right card for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you're looking for a low cost card with the mid-market rate, which you can use in 150+ countries, the Wise card may be a good fit. If you'd prefer to pay a monthly fee to get higher no-fee transaction limits, take a look at Wise. And if you need to get a card in a hurry, check out a travel card from a provider with a physical branch network, like the Westpac card or the Travelex travel money card.\n\nWhat makes a good travel card for Albania\n\nThe best travel debit card for Albania really depends on your personal preferences and how you like to manage your money.\n\nOverall, it pays to look for a card which lets you minimise fees and access favourable exchange rates - ideally the mid-market rate. While currency exchange rates do change all the time, the mid-market rate is a good benchmark to use as it's the one available to banks when trading on wholesale markets. Getting this rate, with transparent conversion fees, makes it easier to compare costs and see exactly what you're paying when you spend in ALL.\n\nOther features and benefits to look out for include low ATM withdrawal fees, complimentary travel insurance, airport lounge access or emergency cash if your card is stolen. It's also important to look into the security features of any travel card you might pick for Albania. Look for a card which uses 2 factor authentication when accessing the account app, which allows you to set instant transaction notifications, and which has easy ways to freeze, unfreeze and cancel your card with your phone.\n\nFor Albania in particular, choosing a card which offers contactless payments and which is compatible with mobile wallets like Apple Pay could be a good plan. Card payments are extremely popular in Albania - so having a card which lets you tap and pay easily can speed things up and make it more convenient during your trip.\n\nWays to pay in Albania\n\nCash and card payments - including contactless, mobile wallet, debit, credit and prepaid card payments - are the most popular ways to pay globally.\n\nIn Albania, both card payments and cash payments are common. You'll be able to make Chip and PIN or contactless payments or use your favourite mobile wallet like Apple Pay to tap and pay on the go, but it's still worth having a little cash on you just in case - and for the odd situations where cash is more convenient, such as when tipping or buying a small item in a market.\n\nWhich countries use ALL?\n\nYou'll find that ALL can only be used in Albania. If you don't travel to Albania frequently it's worth thinking carefully about how much to exchange so you're not left with extra foreign currency after your trip.\n\nAlbanian LekCurrency nameAlbanian LekISO codeALLSymbolLekALL denominationsbanknotes - 200 Lekë, 500 Lekë, 1,000 Lekë, 2,000 Lekë, 5,000 Lekë and coins - 5 Lekë, 10 Lekë, 20 Lekë, 50 Lekë, 100 LekëBest travel cards to take to AlbaniaWise,Revolut\n\nWhat should you be aware of when travelling to Albania\n\nYou're sure to have a great time in Albania - but whenever you're travelling abroad it's worth putting in a little advance thought to make sure everything is organised and your trip goes smoothly. Here are a few things to think about:\n\n1. Double check the latest entry requirements and visas - rules can change abruptly, so even if you're been to Albania before it's worth looking up the most recent entry requirements so you don't have any hassle on the border\n\n2. Plan your currency exchange and payment methods - you can change AUD to ALL before you travel to Albania if you'd like to, but as card payments are common, and ATMs widely available, you can actually leave it until you arrive to get everything sorted as long as you have a travel money card. Top up your travel money card in AUD and either exchange to ALL in advance or at the point of payment, and make ATM withdrawals whenever you need cash. Bear in mind that currency exchange at the airport will be expensive - so hold on until you reach Albania to make an ATM withdrawal in ALL if you can.\n\n3. Get clued up on any health or safety concerns - get travel insurance before you leave Australia so you have peace of mind. It's also worth reading up on any common scams or issues experienced by tourists. These tend to change over time, but may include things like rip off taxis or tour agents which don't offer fair prices or adequate services.\n\nConclusion - Best travel cards for Albania\n\nUltimately the best travel card for your trip to Albania will depend on how you like to manage your money. Use this guide to get some insights into the most popular options out there, and to decide which may suit your specific needs.\n\nHow does a Albanian Lek card work?\n\nGetting a Albanian Lek card can make managing your money easier when you travel to Albania.\n\nYour Albanian Lek card will be linked to a digital account you can manage from your phone, so you'll always be able to see your balance, get transaction notifications and manage your card no matter where you are. Just add money to your account in pounds, and - depending on your preferences and the specific card you pick - you can either convert your balance to Albanian Lek instantly, or just let the card do the conversion when you spend or make a withdrawal.\n\nIf your card gives you the option to hold a Albanian Lek balance, there's not normally any extra fee to spend the Albanian Lek you have in your account when you're in Albania.\n\nCan I withdraw Albanian Lek currency with my card in Albania?\n\nWith some cards, you'll be able to add money to your card in Australian Dollar, and then convert to Albanian Lek instantly online or in your card's app.\n\nOnce you have a balance in Albanian Lek you can spend with your card with no extra fees - just tap and pay as you would at home. You'll also be able to make cash withdrawals whenever you need to, with no extra conversion fee to pay. Your card - or the ATM operator - may charge a withdrawal fee, but this can still be a cheap, secure and convenient option for getting cash when you need it.\n\nWith other cards, you can't hold a balance in Albanian Lek on your card - but you can leave your money in Australian Dollar and let the card convert your money for you when you spend and withdraw.\n\nSome fees may apply here - including currency conversion or foreign transaction charges - so do compare a few different cards before you sign up, to make sure you're picking the one which best suits your specific spending needs.\n\nBear in mind though, that not all cards support all currencies - and the range of currencies available with any given card can change from time to time. If your card doesn't let you hold a balance in Albanian Lek you might find that fees apply when you spend in Albania, so it's well worth double checking your card's terms and conditions - and comparing the options available from other providers - before you travel, just in case.\n\nWhy should I get a Albanian Lek card?\n\nGetting a Albanian Lek card means you can spend like a local when you're in Albania. You'll be able to check your Albanian Lek balance at a glance, add and convert money on the move, and use your card for secure spending and withdrawals whenever you need to. Best of all, Albanian Lek cards from popular providers often offer good exchange rates and low, transparent fees, which can mean your money goes further when you're on a trip abroad."
