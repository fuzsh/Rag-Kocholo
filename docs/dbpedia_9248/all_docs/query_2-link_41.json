        "text": "ALL to PKR\n\nThe exchange rate of ALL to PKR is around 0. This exchange rate changes according to the economic condition. However, both countries play a role in this changing rate. Moreover, this fluctuation is not constant. So, we will discuss the variation of ALL with respect to PKR in this article. We will also compare these currencies from different aspects. Let’s have a look.\n\nALL\n\nThe official currency of Albania is ALL. Its full form is Albanian Lek. But it is commonly known as Lek. 1 Lek was earlier subdivided into 100 Qindarka. However, it is no longer issued. The Lek was proposed as the currency of Albania in February 1926. If a little information is added, before then, Albania was a country without a currency. A gold standard was held for the fixation of commercial processes. And the name Lek was named after Alexender the Great, whose name is often shortened to Leka in Albania.\n\nIf we compare Albanian Lek with the US Dollars, then the exchange rate of USD to ALL is around . You can see that it is much weaker than US Dollars. It means 1 US Dollars is equal to almost ALL.\n\nAfter comparing ALL with the other currencies of the world, we came to know that it is a much weaker currency in front of others. It is not that worthy currency in the international market.\n\nThis low value of the currency can be a cause of many reasons. The main reason can be the unsatisfactory behavior of the government towards international affairs. Moreover, the bad economic condition of the country is also the main reason behind it. Furthermore, the Coronavirus Pandemic is also the culprit behind this bad condition of the economy.\n\nPKR\n\nThe official currency of Pakistan is PKR. It is the short form of Pakistani Rupee. And is commonly known as Rupee. One Rupee was further subdivided in Paisa, but it is not used now.\n\nIf we talk about its condition, then it is also not that good. As compared to many other currencies, it is very weak. The value of the Pakistani Rupee is becoming worst day by day, which can create several problems for the country.\n\nNow to check its strength, we will compare it with the US Dollars. The exchange rate of USD to PKR is around . It is very weak in front of US Dollars. However, this difference is increasing day by day.\n\nThe reason for this bad condition is the worst political system. Moreover, weak laws and regulations also lead the country to this condition. Lending no hand in foreign affairs is also a reason behind it.\n\nRecently, the condition of PKR was becoming good, but the arrival of COVID-19 destroyed it. The economy returned back to its bad condition with this. However, gradually, the condition is becoming better.\n\nALL and PKR\n\nTime to compare ALL and PKR. There isn’t a lot of difference in both currencies. The rate exchange of PKR is a little higher than ALL. It means the value of ALL in the international market is slightly greater than PKR. However, the economic condition of both countries is not good. Another difference is that the demand and supply of ALL are greater than PKR. Lastly, the exchange rate of both currencies keeps varying from time to time, around 0."
