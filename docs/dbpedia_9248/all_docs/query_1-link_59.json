        "text": "Everything about where to get money, the local currency, and paying in Saranda.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe official currency in Albania is the lek (plural: lekë). Banknotes are circulating in values of 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 lekë and there are coins of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 lekë. The euro is also widely accepted in many places, but since exchange rates can be somewhat unfavorable it’s usually cheaper to pay in lek. Be aware though, that it’s difficult to exchange Albanian lek outside of Albania, so do spend it or exchange it before your leave.\n\nBanks\n\nThere are several banks around the town centre, most of which can be found around Nënë Teresa Square on Rruga Skënderbeu and Rruga Flamurit. Plenty of ATMs can be found throughout the town. If you arrive by ferry you can find ATMs to the right when exiting the terminal building. Be aware though, that all of the ATMs in Saranda and in the rest of Albania charge a fee for withdrawing money with foreign bank cards. So it’s better to take out a larger amount of money at once in stead of withdrawing small amounts on multiple occasions. Do also check with your own bank for any additional fees for withdrawing a foreign currency abroad.\n\nCash Is King\n\nImportant to know is that cash is really still king in Albania. Cards are more and more accepted in hotels and some restaurants and larger supermarkets, but definitely not in smaller places and in most shops. So it’s advisable to always carry some cash in case there is no alternative.\n\nIn case you are planning to pay by card where you can, we also recommend to check with your bank for their fees when paying in a foreign currency.\n\nTipping\n\nAs in most European countries, tipping is not mandatory in Albania, but rather gratefully appreciated. In bars & restaurants, rounding up the bill is common practice and if you were really happy with your experience a tip of around 5-10% is appreciated. For tour guides a normal tip would be around 10%. Taxi drivers normally don’t expect tips, but rounding up the amount is rather common.\n\nBargaining\n\nPrice haggling is acceptable at markets, souvenir shops and for longer taxi rides. At other places this is not common."
