        "text": "I have just been to two Exchange offices in Sofia, Bulgaria. I had banknotes from Serbia, Macedonia and Albania with me. They both offered to buy all three of them.\n\nThis doesn't mean you find someone who does this in Finland but it proves that both Macedonian denar and Albanian lek are indeed convertible currencies.\n\nThis is a sign from one of the exchange places. The rates are into Bulgarian lev.\n\nOk, Peter cleared up the more general doubt about exchangeability of the lek anywhere outside Albania. As to my original / more specific question:\n\nIs there any place in Helsinki where I can change those back into euros?\n\nSeems like no, not in Helsinki.\n\nA \"Money Change\" booth I stumbled upon in Kamppi Centre: no (raising a suspicious eyebrow at the bills I procuced).\n\nAt Forex, they also said no. \"Not yet, but maybe some day, if and when the currency becomes more accepted internationally.\" The clerk also said she doubts any banks would change leks either. (According to her, Forex has the widest selection of currencies available across any establishments that do currency exchange here.)\n\nJust to make sure, I asked a friend who works in a large bank. She checked with their travel currency department, and confirmed that the Albanian lek is not accepted.\n\nSo if I really needed to get rid of the leks in Finland, I guess I should post to Pallontallaajat travellers' forum in hope of finding someone going to Albania. (Dunno about that; the amount I have is so small it doesn't warrant going to much trouble.)\n\nMaybe we can deduce that accepting Albanian money is currently limited to countries near Albania..."
