(SBU) SUMMARY: The recent period of high volatility of the\n\nAlbanian lek versus the euro has made headlines and shaken market\n\nconfidence. The contributing factors are short-term and more\n\npsychological and speculative such as reactions to the Prime\n\nMinister's comments on adopting the euro. Long term factors,\n\nincluding the current account and budget deficits have put weak but\n\nsteady downward pressure on the lek throughout the year. As the new\n\n2010 budget is approved and growth continues to lag, the situation\n\nis not expected to improve in the near term, and the lek has\n\nsteadily remained near its all time low of 137 lek to the euro.\n\nAlthough a weak lek might boost Albanian exports to the euro zone,\n\nit also drives up imports, including food imports which account for\n\nnearly half of Albania's food requirements. Moreover a weak lek\n\ncould dramatically increase repayment costs for consumers holding\n\neuro-denominated loans, which is nearly 70 percent of all loans\n\noutstanding in Albania. End Summary\n\n2. (U) On September 24, the lek reached an all-time low of 137.83\n\nlek to the euro. The national currency had tumbled 2.6 percent in a\n\nmatter of days. As the currency market panicked and the buy/sell\n\nspread widened, both the Central Bank (Bank Of Albania) Governor and\n\nthe Minister of Finance appealed for calm and tried to convey\n\nconfidence. Their intervention stabilized the high fluctuations,\n\nbut not for long. Over the following weeks and to date, the exchange\n\nrate has mildly fluctuated and the historically strong lek continues\n\nto have an average rate of 137.64 to the euro.\n\n\"Deadlines and Headlines Push Lek Down\"\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n3. (SBU) Two unique factors occurred that could explain the high\n\nvolatility. The Albanian exchange market historically trades at a\n\nlow volume which does not regularly exceed 20 million euros.\n\nMassive purchases of euros in late September in order to pay stock\n\ndividends, particularly from Vodafone, caused a sharp decline in the\n\nlek/euro exchange rate and touched off the initial panic in the\n\nmarket. On the political front the Prime Minister also announced in\n\nearly October that Albania must start the process of adopting the\n\neuro, independent of the status of its candidate application for the\n\nEU. Some observers blamed Berisha's comments for further weakening\n\nthe already wobbly lek.\n\n\"GOA Spending Makes it a Tough Year for the Lek\"\n\n--------------------------------------------- --\n\n4. (SBU) Following years of relative stability and steady\n\nappreciation the lek has been under continuous pressure for all of\n\n2009. In the first nine months of the year, the lek has fallen 10\n\npercent. Some experts have blamed government spending, particularly\n\nin the pre-June election run-up, as a main cause of downward\n\ncurrency pressure. The political opposition has continuously blamed\n\nthe government for the fall of the lek. Higher spending combined\n\nwith lower levels of remittances, lower exports and lower than\n\nexpected public revenues have significantly increased the current\n\naccount deficit to 15 percent, resulting in more demand inside\n\nAlbania for euros, and less demand for lek.\n\n\"A Continuing Headache\" -----------------------\n\n5. (SBU) Lek depreciation will continue to strain corporate bank\n\ncustomers who have euro denominated loans and lek revenues. The euro\n\nhas become the main currency for large transactions in Albania, and\n\nmost consumers have taken advantage of preferential euro loan rates\n\nfor mortgages and personal loans. The average interest rate for\n\neuro denominated loans has been 5 points lower than loans\n\ndenominated in lek. As of August 2008 31 percent of outstanding\n\nloans were in lek and 61.7 percent in euro. The gap widens in the\n\nreal estate sector, where 22.5 percent of loans are denominated in\n\nlek.\n\n6. (SBU) The devaluation of the lek is not expected to have a\n\ndirect impact on the other Balkan economies. It will, however, put\n\nmore strain on the commercial banks operating in Albania as more\n\nconsumers are forecasted to have difficulty making loan payments.\n\nThis could further increase the amount of bad (over 31 days late)\n\nloans past their current peak level of 9.8 percent. In an attempt\n\nto balance the outstanding loan stock, BOA has repeatedly called on\n\nconsumers to obtain their loans in the currency of their revenues to\n\nmitigate foreign exchange risk.\n\n7. (SBU) Comment: Most observers believe that the current exchange\n\nrate of 137 lek to the euro is sustainable and no cause to panic.\n\nMost economists, however, view 140 lek to the euro as the point\n\nwhere the Albanian economy could begin to suffer, including serious\n\nhardship for consumers with euro denominated loans. While the\n\nGovernment has sought to reassure the public about the support for\n\nthe lek, there has been a continued insistence that the lek will\n\nfind a new, lower equilibrium and that there is full support for the\n\nfree floating regime though it may be painful at times. The true\n\ncause of the lek devaluation is a combination of factors, and lower\n\nremittances and lower growth have removed the cushion that\n\ntraditionally protected the economy from sharp currency\n\nfluctuations. The sharp one day decrease of 2.9 percent startled\n\nTIRANA 00000742 002.2 OF 002\n\nthe public and encouraged speculation, but was in line with the\n\ngeneral downward trend of the lek. Looking to the end of the year\n\nit appears that even with the revised 2009 budget, the government\n\nwill fall short on revenues and will need to use currency reserves\n\nor lending to make up the shortfall, which could apply further\n\ndownward pressure to the lek."
