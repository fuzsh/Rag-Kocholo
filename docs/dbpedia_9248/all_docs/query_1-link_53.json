        "text": "How can I exchange foreign currency into Albanian Leke?\n\nHow can I exchange foreign currency in Albania?\n\nAre you traveling to Albania?\n\nOne of the first questions that comes to mind naturally is what currency am I going to use? Can I use Euro in Albania? Can I use USD in Albania? Can I use British Pound in Albania? How can I exchange currency into leke? What is the best exchange rate?\n\nWell, Albanian Leke is the accpeted currency in Albania, along with some places accepting euro and USD and some places even British Pound.\n\nIn this blogpost I will try and bring you some information that will help you with the money and exchanging money in Albania questions.\n\nShould I bring cash with me in Albania?\n\nYes, you may bring cash with you. Albania is a safe country and tourists are respected and helped by the Albanians. Rooted in their ancient history, the institution of BESA (where the guest was under your protection just like your family member) provides the visitors additional protection. However as we say in Albania “ there is no forest without pigs” so you should always use common sense in safeguarding your belongings.\n\nHow much cash can I bring in Albania?\n\nThis is subjective to your expectations and what you would like to do during your stay in Albania, but I would suggest not to travel with more than €1500 – €2000 ($1600-2200) (£1400 -1800). This will be more than enough for your hotel (let say for a 10 day stay in the Albanian Riviera) and main expenses like transportation (you may travel from Tirana to Albanian Riviera via https://www.albanianbus.com) for only €25 all the way to Ksamil with our bus line .\n\nThere is also a customs limitation to the amount of cash you can bring with you into the country and that is around $10k.\n\nWere can I exchange money in Albania?\n\nBest rate and options are provided by currency exchange booths that are all over Tirana and in every big city in Albania. All western union points also provide currency exchange services. All exchange rates are shown on boards in the stores. Make sure you have a look at them before handing your money to the operator. Albania has a stable currency so the inflation does not affect the exchange rate significantly. At the time of this blog the currency exchange rates into leke are the following €1 = 116 leke, $1 = 110 leke, £1=135 leke. Anything within this range is acceptable.\n\nDo not use the banks to exchange currency into Albanian Leke. The rates and commisions are high and you will lose some money in the proces. You could save as muach as lunch (fastfood) money by not exchanging to the bank rates.\n\nCan I use Euro, USD or British Pound to pay for goods and services in Albania?\n\nYes, you can. Some places will prefer euro, usd or british pound. It never hurts to ask, especially if you are paying for hotel or accomodation. Hence, all our reservations in our Albanian Bus website are done in Euro.\n\nSo, to conclude if you decide to bring cash to Albania, is perfectly safe and fine at a reasonable amount. Cash will give you a lot of freedom especially travelling to locations in Albanian Riviera towns and villages, or paying for your sun umbrella, where credit card is not so much preferred.\n\nI hope this blogpost will help and feel free to contact me with your questions via our whatssup button at the corner of the page. And we would be even more glad to have you as our passenger if you decide to travel from Tirana to Himara, Saranda Ksamil and Albanian Riviera and return."
