The country is small in kilometers but it has many natural landscapes, is rich in mineral and natural resources and its inhabitants have inherited unique traditions of their Illyrian ancestors. Tourism has become a priority in-country, being that Albania is surrounded by about 400 km coastline with its unspoiled Adriatic and Ionian beaches.\n\nBased on the data provided by the Albanian Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), Albania welcomed 5.9 million international arrivals in 2018.\n\nLocated in the region called Balkans, Albania is bordered by Greece in the southeast, Macedonia in the east, Kosovo in the northeast, and Montenegro in the north. In front of it (bordered by the Adriatic Sea) in Italy. The main airport is called Mother Theresa Airport, located in Rinas, between Tirana and Durres cities.\n\nAs for the geo-physic feature, Albania is divided into four zones: the northern mountainous zone also called Albanian Alps, central mountainous zone, southern mountainous zone, and the western wetland. The average latitude of the country is 708 m above the level sea. The country’s climate has Mediterranean features where the minimal temperatures may reach -15 degrees during winter and up to 40 degrees during the summer season. Albania has about 270-300 sunny days per year.\n\nTirana, the largest city and at the same time the most developed metropolis is the capital of Albania, situated in Middle Albania, bordered by Durres and Elbasan cities, the second largest cities in the country. Tirana is the settlement of many international firms and businesses’ offices. The architecture and urban development of the city boosted after 1990 since before citizens didn’t have the right to construct nor had their privately owned lands or facilities.\n\n3.020209 million people are estimated to live currently in Albania (calculated in 2014), whose prominent values are the worm hospitality and religious tolerance, often praised by important international figures, lately by Pope Francis during his historic visit to Tirana on September 21, 2014.\n\nThe economy of Albania has had many ups and downs during the transition period (after the fall of communism in 1990 until nowadays). It is a liberalized economy and mainly focused on tourism and natural resources (chrome, oil, and other minerals). The economy’s priority sectors are agriculture, tourism, ICT, transportation and logistics, renewable energy, manufacturing industry, mining industry (natural resources).\n\nAlbania is a democratic state and has a large number of small parties registered as active in the country’s political life. Socialist Party (mayor left-wing party in-country) is currently ruling the country, headed by its leader Edi Rama, Prime Minister of Albania, declared the winner of elections held in 2013. Democratic Party is the main opposition party, ruled by Lulezim Basha, which is currently Mayor of Tirana Municipality.\n\nAfter the fall of the communist regime in 1990, the first democratic elections took place in 1991 but the communist party won and was still a majority. In March 1992, amid liberalization policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new front led by the new Democratic Party took power. The economic crisis spread in late 1996 following the failure of some Ponzi schemes operating in the country, peaking in 1997 in an armed rebellion that led to another mass emigration of Albanians, mostly to Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Germany, and the United States. In 1999, the country was affected by the Kosovo War, when a great number of Albanians from Kosovo found refuge in Albania. Albania became a full member of NATO in 2009 and has applied to join the European Union. In June 2014, the Republic of Albania became an official candidate for accession to the European Union.\n\nMap of Albania\n\nHistorical dates\n\n1912 ►Albanian Declaration of Independence\n\nOn 28 November 1912 Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire.\n\n1912–14 ►Independent Albania\n\nParliamentary state and assembly were established in Vlora on 28 November 1912.
