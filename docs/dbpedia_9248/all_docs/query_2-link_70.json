        "text": "This research investigates what drives the euroization in Albania. By using survey data collected in one of the main Albanian cities, we find that factors like remittances, financial literacy, perception of high inflation and trust in financial system play an important role in the extent of euroization together with the experience of past events. Factors related to the future, such as the expectation on the exchange rate fluctuations, seem to not be correlated with the extent of euroization. As regards the current Eurozone crisis, its impact on euroization results to be mediated by the (mis)trust in EURO rather than local currency.\n\nAlbania is a country which is still in the second stage of economic development. The use of foreign currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and the European currency has been and is a reality in the Albanian economy. The practice of using foreign currency in Albania extends from the price policies of commercial manufacturing firms, Albanian families who keep their savings in foreign currencies (mainly generated from remittances) to and relationship banking activity their business (on credit), etc..By this paper work, I will try to give the impacts of this phenomenon in the Albanian economy, the advantages of disadvantages comparing Euroisation and the consequences that we had neighbors with Albania.In this paper, I have tried to present a picture so modest depiction of the Albanian economy, economic convergence problems, implications that can create euroisation (potential costs and benefits, etc.).\n\nThe property dispute between the Republic of Serbia (RS) and the Republic of Kosovo (RKS) has recently flared up again following a decision of Kosovoâ€™s government to appropriate all real estate properties that were registered under the name of the former Social st Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), the Republic of Serbia or the former Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo (SAPK). The decree covers the immovable property of the former central state, the military, and socio-political organisations. It obliges the Kosovo Cadastral Agency, as the central authority for the property registers, to proceed with the registration of property rights concerning all above-mentioned properties. Thus this article is an attempt to explain what is likely to happen,"
