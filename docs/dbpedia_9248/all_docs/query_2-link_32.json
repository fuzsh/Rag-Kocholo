        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 62. No. 2 (Al) May 2023\n\nForeign currency decline in value and its implication for the Albanian economy\n\nSummary\n\nIt has become a recurring theme before any kind of elections, for the foreign currency in Albania to lose value, but as April 2023 demonstrates, there is a new historic level of decline in the euro (€) and US dollar ($). Although the downward trend of foreign currencies in almost a decade has become a norm, the “historic low” concept is being redefined each month in 2023.\n\nThe great deformation of Albania’s exchange rate is impossible to comprehend by simple economic logic because there is no plausible explanation. The variables to be included cannot count the informal inputs and cash flows, thus there is not any verifiable reason for these fluctuations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Albania, the euro is the dominant foreign currency, especially in foreign trade exchanges. The proximity to the European Union (EU) and the high impact of countries of the Eurozone in the Albanian economy makes for the European single currency to be omnipresent. The importance of the euro is visible especially when it is considered that is increasingly becoming the favorite currency of Albanians for their savings. However, the strong devaluation of the common European currency is being viewed with concern by various actors, at a time when the phenomenon is expected to continue to deepen due to the very high foreign exchange flows entering the market during election time.\n\nAlbanian economy and foreign exchange in times of elections\n\nAccording to data from the Bank of Albania, at the end of 2022, the stock of total deposits in the country reached a new record of 1.28 trillion Albanian Lek (ALL) almost 11 billion €. Out of which the European currency constitutes 57.4% of all savings.[1] The Bank of Albania considers that the decline in the value of the euro was due to large inflows of currency, from sources such as emigrants’ remittances and foreign investments. They argue that the exchange rate evaluation has been a feature of the overall developments during 2022. For them, this progress is in line with the developments that have occurred with the balance of payments.[2] It is also argued that these fluctuations are normal, but Albanian experts believe otherwise. Besides the complications that 2022 brought in terms of inflation, the foreign currency depreciation in Albania is not only connected with the economic implications of the conflict in Ukraine because in the four months of 2023, and especially in April, there has been a new record low. Below is the official data for two main foreign currencies exchange rates:\n\nExchange rate: Albanian Lek to euro (2023)\n\nSource: Bank of Albania[3]\n\nExchange rate: Albanian Lek to US dollar (2023)\n\nSource: Bank of Albania\n\nCurrency rate movements by 3-4 percentage points only because of the elections have been witnessed almost every election cycle, but this time around is more than 7 percentage points. Based on the estimates made by the international institutions for the elections in Albania, the elections cost from 250 to 300 million euros, out of which the Central Elections Committee (KQZ) awards to political parties only 8 million €.[4] Therefore, it is clearly understood and implied that most of the cash injected into the economy is informal, and it is mostly in euros.\n\nThe depreciation and negative effects\n\nAs the summer is approaching, there is also going to be the usual depreciation of foreign currency because of inflows of cash from tourists. This is affecting the businesses of the tourism sector and especially the hotel industry, which sells its services mainly in euros. The Albanian tourism sector has had a kind of competitive advantage in attracting foreign tourists, thanks to relatively cheaper prices compared to competing destinations in Europe. However, the increase in prices due to the strengthening of the ALL and the increase in the cost of labor may dilute this advantage.\n\nAccording to foreign exchange market agents, the volume of euro purchases by foreign exchange agents is much higher than its sales, and this is causing a continuous and progressive decline in the European currency rate. Compared to the same period a year ago, the exchange rate of the € against the ALL has decreased by approximately 7%.\n\nThe decline in the value of remittances becomes even sharper due to the devaluation of the euro. This is because remittances for a good part of Albanian families are the main source of their financial survival. What burdens the most is that remittances are usually used by poor households, and this depreciation for them could be catastrophic. The main problem here remains that even though Albanians from abroad are sending their money home, the same amount has now lost value due to foreign currency depreciation. Thus, this vicious circle of remittances becomes more difficult to bear.\n\nConcerning trade, a stronger domestic currency makes it cheaper to import goods and services from abroad. Nevertheless, the strengthening of the local currency is having an increasingly negative impact on the exporting sectors of the economy, which generally have their income in ALL and expenditures in €. The devaluation of the euro has become a serious challenge for them, at a time when this devaluation has been accompanied by an increase in labor and production costs. Such a change constitutes significant pressure on the profit margins of businesses, especially in the fashion sector. An overvalued local currency is a factor with a negative impact on the competitiveness of exports of goods and services. In addition, the strengthening of the ALL can harm the budget revenues, which are dominated by Value Added Tax (VAT) and especially by that obtained from imported goods.[5]\n\nEuro depreciation and the ones that gain from it\n\nAfter increasing in the last two years by about 1.8 billion €, the public debt has registered a slight decrease in the first three months of 2023. Meanwhile, during this year, the tendency of the government to borrow from the domestic market deepened. Such a decrease in the public debt is due to a significant extent to the exchange rate. In the newly published report of the Bank of Albania, the external debt is calculated at the current euro rate of 113.2 ALL for one euro. Furthermore, the appreciation of the ALL has further aided the government, significantly reducing external debt servicing costs. The year 2023 has found the Albanian state with a record level of public debt, which for the first time has crossed the threshold of 12 billion euros.[6] Furthermore, at the end of March, the total foreign currency liabilities were 5.58 billion euros, while the European currency accounted for 71.6 % of the total, followed by the currency of the International Monetary Fund (SDR) with 13.6 % and the US dollar with 11%. In the same time frame, the annual devaluation of the euro is 3.8%, translating into almost 4 million euros less obligations for the government.[7] Thus, a less valuable euro is favorable for the government.\n\nWhat is not measurable internally and its influence on the exchange rate\n\nThe number of reports of suspected cases of money laundering has marked a significant increase, while the purchase of real estate remains the most widely used method for this purpose. According to official data published by the General Directorate of Prevention of Money Laundering, about 1,790 suspected cases have been reported, with an increase of 13% compared to the previous year. In the official report, the authorities inform that data from notary entities and reports from the banking system predominate, which for 2022 respectively constitute 41% and 37% of the total number, followed by reports from financial institutions for money transfer with 16%. The purchase of real estate remains this year as one of the most used ways to launder money in the country. A considerable percentage of these purchases have unknown sources of funds, followed by suspicious transfers or obvious anomalies, as well as unjustified transfers to risky countries that continue to dominate.\n\nNext in the list of main typologies come the actions by persons suspected of being involved in previous criminal activity or connections with persons with precedents, borrowing/sponsorships/donations to/from fictitious third parties. Another widely used way results in depositing cash with an unjustified source of income, or withdrawing cash in high values from the accounts of individuals and legal entities with doubts about their use. Even this year, the list does not lack politicians or people close to them.[8]\n\nThe overvaluation of the national currency cannot be explained through fundamental factors in the economy. The trend of increasing money, especially cash flows in circulation outside of official channels for years is seen as unusual by experts because, at the end of the year when official data are released, the figures do not match.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ones that are hurt the most from the devaluation of foreign currency are the most vulnerable in the economic cycles of the country. The association of exporters has declared that they are going towards bankruptcy, in a country with low productivity, hitting the backbone of national production might have harsh and irreversible implications for the future. Moreover, for low-income families who survive on remittances, this is a real tragedy. They already had little income from their family members aboard, now they have less. Last but not least, because of the euro depreciation, imported products should also be cheaper, but this is not reflected, on the contrary, imported products are increasing in price every month.\n\n[1] Albania “floats” in euros, foreign currency deposits increase significantly in October, reaching 57.4% of the total. https://www.monitor.al/shqiperia-noton-ne-euro-rriten-ndjeshem-depozitat-ne-valute-ne-tetor-arrijne-57-4-te-totalit/\n\n[2] The strong fall of the Euro, the Bank of Albania does not foresee interventions to stabilize the market. https://a2news.com/2023/04/28/renia-e-forte-e-euros-banka-e-shqiperise-nuk-parashikon-nderhyrje-per-te-stabilizuar-tregun/\n\n[3] Official exchange rate of the Bank of Albania. https://www.bankofalbania.org/Markets/Official_exchange_rate/\n\n[4] The fall of the euro!
