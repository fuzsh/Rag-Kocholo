        "text": "OLD LEK vs NEW LEK\n\nSometime before 1990, Albanian LEK was revalued by Bank of Albania introducing new notes and coins. The new value was 1 New Lek for 10 Old Lekë. If you had 10,000 Lekë in the bank it suddenly had a value of 1,000 Lekë.\n\nAlbanians being stubborn and to keep the ‘old’ value going, continued to refer to Old Lek but would accept the New Lek value (as they had to) Example: If a street vendor says “100 Lekë” they would take 10 Lekë. If a shopkeeper said, “1000 Lekë ” he would accept 100 Lekë.\n\nWhen in doubt ask to see the receipt, it will always refer to the ‘new lek’ thus the correct amount.200, 500, 1000, 5000 lekë is still commonly referred to as 2000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000 OLD lekë\n\nMoney Exchange in Albania\n\nThe exchange rates of Albania are established daily from Bank of Albania & all other banks and exchange offices follow it.
