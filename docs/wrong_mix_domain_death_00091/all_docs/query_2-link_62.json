        "text": "Cary Grant is, without question, one of the pre-eminent movie stars of the 20th century. To me, he is a cross between George Clooney and Tom Hanks. If you look at the figures, he topped the box office year after year. His films – North by Northwest, To Catch a Thief, The Philadelphia Story – were among the most watched in the world.\n\nWhat I never realised was that in 1966, at the age of 62, and at the height of his fame and powers as an actor, Cary Grant gave it all up to become a stay-at-home dad looking after his baby daughter Jennifer with actress Dyan Cannon, the fourth of his five wives. He had only recently made the box office smashes Charade with Audrey Hepburn and That Touch of Mink with Doris Day and turned down the chance to play James Bond in Dr No.\n\nHaving read Jennifer’s book called Good Stuff – a catchphrase her dad used when things were going well – and then Dyan’s, I discovered there were unresolved issues with access to Jennifer after her parents divorced. Cary could only see his daughter every other weekend and he thought there’s no way I’m going to miss that because I’m on set making a film. So he built his life around his daughter.\n\nI thought Cary Grant as a single dad was an interesting basis for a drama. But I wasn’t prepared for a shocking event in his life that would become the real spur for me to write Archie.\n\nOf course, we know that he was born Archibald Leach into a working-class family in Bristol (in 1904). He had a very difficult childhood, including the loss of a brother in infancy. But the event that shocked me was that, as a small child, Archie was told by his father Elias that his mother Elsie had died. Many years later when he was a famous film star, Cary discovered that she had been alive all along and was living in a mental institution after Elias signed the papers to have her taken away. It is likely she was suffering from depression after the loss of her child and in less enlightened times her husband had her committed. It’s a story twist worthy of Dickens.\n\nCary made the discovery at the age of 31 in 1935 during a visit to see his ailing father who admitted the truth. By this time a major Hollywood player, Cary organised for his mum to be released from the institution and supported her financially for the rest of her life in a smart part of Bristol. When I was writing, I knew I was building towards the moment he realised his mother was still alive.\n\nI also wanted to explore what happened after this discovery. There were some photographs Elsie had taken to send to him in Los Angeles once they’d been reconciled and they’re quite flirty. She’s put makeup on and she’s wearing nice clothes and she’s clearly posing and she’s saying “what do you think? I’m quite a young ‘old’ mum, aren’t I?” You can see that she wanted him in her life.\n\nThe problem for Cary Grant was that he’d spent 25 years eradicating every trace of Archie Leach. Becoming a film star was, in a way, an act of distancing himself from the pain of his past. He had this perfect suntan and haircut and acquired a mid-Atlantic accent to cover his Bristol roots. Then, suddenly, there’s a woman there saying “hello, Archie” and he’s thinking: I thought I’d got rid of him. Archie equalled pain. Cary equalled control over his life.\n\nHe never invited her to live with him in LA, which I think is telling. He said things like: the journey and uprooting would be detrimental to her health. But I think he was using the Atlantic as a buffer between Cary and Archie. It was about control, and she never even visited him. It meant he didn’t have to go with her to a Hollywood dinner party or have people visit his house and have to say: this is my mother.\n\nThe rejection of his childhood was too painful for him so he kept the two sides to his life separate.\n\nHowever, he DID often visit her in Bristol and for three weeks every year he would become Archie again. It was not an easy relationship. On these trips, he would also see Eric, his half-brother from his dad’s later relationship, though Cary referred to him as his cousin because of the shame he felt about what had happened in his family.\n\nJason Isaacs, who plays him in middle age, wanted to show Archie behind the Cary Grant mask and I think you really see that in the scenes where he is going back to see his mum. These scenes show us how difficult he found it to reconcile Archie with Cary. He once said that he turned every woman he married into his mother and punished them for her having left him. He needed to control them because of what he’d experienced in his childhood. I think directors like Alfred Hitchcock could see in Cary Grant’s eyes this darkness from his early life and used it in those complex thrillers he made.\n\nWhile writing, I also found out more about what being a father to Jennifer meant to him. After the pain of his own childhood, it was his first experience of unconditional love. He could choose – and reject – his wives, but his daughter was the first person he had to love unconditionally. That changed his life.\n\nFor this drama, I worked with both Dyan and Jennifer and it was tricky because mother and daughter weren’t always on the same page. Dyan had a very different experience of life with Cary than Jennifer did because, of course, he was different things to different people. It was about drawing as much information from both women. But, at the same time, it had to be my version; there had to be editorial independence."
