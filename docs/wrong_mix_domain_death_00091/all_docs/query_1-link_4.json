Metcalf Passed Away at Tampa, Fla.\n\nJ. S. Metcalf, an old resident of Cairo, passed away at his home in Tampa, Fla., last week. A Tampa newspaper just received gives the following notice of his death.\n\nFollowing a period of ten days illness, James H.

Here he continued to reside, doing his share of the work on the farm, until about six years ago, when he moved with the family of Mr. and Mrs. Nowotny to their present residence in this city.\n\nOf splendid stature and powerful physique, as may be gathered from this sketch of his life, Mr. Metcalf was essentially a man in every sense of the word. Always considerate of the feelings of others, he spent his declining years passing a kindly word to all he met, trying to make the sun shine a little brighter and smooth out the troubles of everyone who came his way.\n\n(William W.

Atherton was born in what is now Pulaski County, Nov. 21, 1832. He was the second of six children and the son of Aaron and Elizabeth Atherton, both natives of Kentucky, who immigrated to this state in 1816 and settled where the subject of this sketch was born. His father was a soldier in the Mexican War and was killed in the Battle of Buena Vista, Feb. 27, 1847, thereby limiting the opportunities for an education for this son, as he resumed the responsibilities of the home and conducted the farm for his mother until he was eighteen years old. Entered the mercantile business in what was known as Valley Forge, Pulaski County, and acted as postmaster six years, at which is now Villa Ridge, before the Illinois Central Railroad was built. Then he returned to the home farm where he lived about twenty years, farming and sawmilling. He also put in a flour mill, which he ran in connection with the saw mill about one year, when it was destroyed by fire, losing the mill and its contents as he had no insurance in 1879. Soon after Hodges Park was started, he put up a saw mill and store at that place in which he remained engaged as long as he stayed in Alexander County and some six or seven years after coming to Johnson County. After closing out the milling business he settled down on his farm three miles south of Vienna and spent his declining years peacefully and apparently perfectly contented, enjoying the reward for his score years of usefulness.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Kelly Dec. 16, 1856, and to this union nine children were born: John H., Ellen Mathis, Edward J., Hannah C., Grace T. Parker, George C., Anna A., Fanny M. and Violet E. His daughter, Ellen E. Mathis, has lived with him since the death of his last wife and has been untiring in her devotion to his every need.\n\nHis second marriage was to Emily A. Brown, June 29, 1883. In 1891 he married to Mary E. Norton, Nov. 15, and was again married Dec. 17, 1899, to Mary J. Parker, formerly a well-known resident of Vienna, who died May 16, 1904.\n\nHe united with the Shiloh Baptist Church near Villa Ridge Aug. 12, 1852. He was very faithful to his church and was a tireless Bible reader. He enjoyed good health up to within a few days before his death, when he contracted a cold which he was unable to throw off on account of his old age. He passed away Jan. 16, 1912.\n\nHe was a good father, a generous friend and will be greatly missed by those who knew him best.\n\nFuneral services were held at Shiloh Baptist Church, a mile and a half west of Villa Ridge and near his old home, Jan. 17th, conducted by Rev. W. A. Ridge, of Dongola, a personal friend and once pastor of Shiloh Church. The services were very touching as he recalled many incidents of the past, showing the generosity and interest taken by the deceased in the up building and maintenance of Shiloh Church.\n\n(Asa Coleman Atherton, 50, miller, from Hodges Park, Ill., born in Pulaski Co., Ill., son of Aaron Atherton and Elizabeth Atherton, married Mrs. Emily Alvina Brown, 43, born in St. Louis, Mo., daughter of Samuel Music and Elizabeth Walker, on 27 Jun 1883, in Union Co., Ill.

The young negro is said to have been intoxicated and went into the saloon at Thirty-second and Commercial and engaged in a quarrel with another negro. Later he left the saloon and, going to the home of his father, not far distant, he seized a Winchester rifle and went back to the saloon, where he made the negroes step lively. The bartender managed to get Lipe out of the saloon and called the police.\n\nOfficers Johnson and Griffin, colored, responded to the call. They encountered Lipe and another negro at the corner of Twenty-seventh and Commercial. Seeing the officers, Lipe is said to have made a gun play, trying to shoot the officers, who dodged behind a telephone pole. The negro Patterson, who was with Lipe, managed to get the rifle away from him, whereupon Lipe started on a run up Commercial with the police in pursuit. Lipe made a motion towards his back pocket as if to pull a gun and Johnson was too quick for him and shot at him. He was then arrested and taken to police headquarters. It was not known that the shot had taken effect until sometime later. He was then taken to the infirmary, where he died Sunday evening about 6:30 o'clock.\n\nOfficer Johnson has always been a fearless officer and killed a \"bad negro\" named Frank Conners several years ago for which he was exonerated.\n\nJohnson was placed under arrest after Lipe's death and is being held pending the result of the coroner’s jury this afternoon.\n\nLipe had had trouble with a number of officers in the past, including former Officer Jim Casey and Special Officer Ed Moore.\n\nThe coroner’s inquest was held this afternoon in the council chamber.\n\nThe jury was composed of Samuel Green, Charles DeBaun, James Barrow, Gus Osterloh, Joe Berbling, and Ed Halliday.\n\nMrs. Elmer Clymore, who has been in bad health for several months and finally her mind became effected so much that it was deemed best to take her to the hospital for treatment. Accordingly she was adjudged insane before Judge Hight on last Monday morning and her husband and Ike L. Morgan took her to the Southern Hospital at Anna. This is a sad affair indeed. The little son, Bradley, only child, has gone to stay at his grandfather's, Dan Clymore, in the country, and Elmer still remains here (Vienna) as clerk in Boyd’s store. Another sad thing is that Mrs. Clymore's mother, Mrs. Bradley Farmer, is slowly dying with cancer. They are all good people.\n\n(Elmer Clymore married Daisy M.

Mrs. Blotkin had been at her son's bedside the past two weeks having been called to Chicago on account of his serious condition.\n\nThe deceased had lived in Cairo nearly all his life, receiving his education in the Cairo public schools. He was an exceptionally bright young man and graduated from Cairo High School in 1908, being regarded as one of the most apt students ever finishing at that institution. His zeal and energy led him to enter the University of Chicago upon his own resources, his ambition being to fit himself for the U. S. Consular Service. To accomplish this, he received his B. S. degree and at the time of his death was striving for the Master of Arts title. He received several scholarships which none other but a bright person could achieve.\n\nHe was just entering upon the zenith of his career, and it seems one of the peculiar ironies of fate that he should be stricken down at this time. The burden of his untimely end will rest heavily upon his mother, to whom he was deeply devoted and who went through many sacrifices that her son might have the educational advantages he deserved. He also leaves a sister, Miss Minnie, and a brother, Abe, who is assistant manager of the Kress Store in this city.\n\nMiss Nellie Kibbels, of East Cape Girardeau, who died in the hospital at Cape Girardeau while under an operation, was buried here (McClure) in the Lindsey Cemetery Saturday.

JOHN CAIN PASSES AWAY\n\nOld Resident of Cairo Died Early This Morning at Age of 68.\n\nMrs. Honora Cain, wife of John Cain, an old and respected resident of Cairo, died at 2:40 o'clock this morning at her home, No. 421 Fourteenth Street. The deceased suffered a paralytic stroke three days ago and this coupled with the old age of the sufferer prevented her recovery. This was the third stroke of its kind that Mrs. Cain experienced in as many years.\n\nThe deceased was born in County Cork, Ireland, in 1844, and was at the time of her death 68 years of age. Her maiden name was Honora O'Neil and she came to this country with her parents when quite a young girl. During the Civil War in 1862, she came to Cairo and resided here ever since. She was married to Mr. Cain in this city in 1865.\n\nAlthough of a quiet and unassuming nature, she had a wide circle of acquaintances. She leaves besides her husband, four daughters, Mrs. Frank Jaeckle, of East St. Louis, Mrs. Kate Shea, and Misses Mayme and Ida Cain, of this city, and one son, Alex Cain, of Murphysboro, and five grandchildren.\n\nMr. Cain is the venerable watchman at the First Bank and Trust Company. He has been ill for some time and the sudden death of his wife and subsequent shock makes his recovery doubtful.\n\nThe funeral will be held Sunday afternoon from St. Patrick’s Church, of which the deceased was a member.

He went on the boat in an intoxicated condition and inquired of one of the roustabouts the fare to Dorona, Mo., which is a landing opposite Hickman, Ky. In coming off the boat, he stumbled across the gang plank and fell into the river.\n\nHe fell on his face and floated about 30 feet, in between the Lee boat and the wharf boat. The body did not sink and was picked up by one of the rousters with a grappling hook. He was taken aboard the boat and his body rolled on a barrel in the hopes of resuscitation, but the man was already dead.\n\nCoroner McManus was called and he summoned a jury composed of Capt. Elmer Emery, Capt. George Clark, Jesse Fitch, Sam Wessinger, John Foley and John Wichert. They found that the man met death by accidental drowning. Coroner McManus explained that the reason the body did not sink was because falling as the man did on his face his lungs filled rapidly with water and stopped the action of his heart. The cold water may also have had something to do with it as the man was very drunk.\n\nThe man has been seen around the wharf boat for several days and it is presumed that he either lived at Dorena or was going there to work. He was about 60 years of age. Nothing to identify him in the way of papers or letters were found upon his person and no one seemed to know who he was.\n\nFORMER CAIRO BOY DIES IN THE WEST\n\nFrank Thornton, aged 25 years, a former resident of Cairo, died in California last week after an illness of several months' duration.

Relatives and friends of Lipe contend that the killing was not justifiable despite the fact that the colored officer was exonerated by the coroner’s jury.\n\nThe contention is that Lipe was not armed when he was shot by Johnson and was running from the officer at the time.\n\nWitnesses have been called to testify before the grand jury and an attempt will be made to secure an indictment against Johnson from the grand jury now in session.\n\nIDENTITY OF DROWNED MAN MADE KNOWN\n\nThe identity of the unknown white man, who was drowned off the steamer Georgia Lee Monday morning, was made known this noon when advices were received by Mrs. L.

Violet, 45 years old, a prosperous planter of Milburn, Carlisle County. Violet was shot and instantly killed by Richardson late Saturday evening at Milburn and the Paducah jail is the third prison in which the alleged murderer has been an inmate since that time to keep him safe from the hands of a mob.\n\nAccording to reports that reached Sheriff Jim Burnely and Deputy Sheriff Wright, who made a record run to Paducah Monday evening, planters of Carlisle County have sworn to avenge the death of their friend and neighbor.\n\nAccording to the officers’ version of the killing, Will Richardson went to Milburn Saturday afternoon with the avowed purpose of “getting him a man,” as the alleged slayer is said to have expressed it.\n\nViolet, who is credited with having been a peaceful and inoffensive farmer, in leaving a store entrance is said to have accidently brushed against Richardson. The latter, according to reports, cursed and upbraided Violet in a rough manner.Violet is said to have turned and humbly apologized, ending with the words “excuse me.”\n\n“By God, I’ll excuse you,” Richardson is said to have growled and making a quick draw of his pistol, fired at Violet. In his rage his aim was bad and he came near hitting a woman who was across the street. Once more Richardson worked the trigger. The flame flashed against Violet’s breast, as his body was almost in reaching distance. He toppled to the ground a corpse.\n\nBefore Richardson could shoot again, Violet’s son, a youth of 20 years, had grappled with Richardson and held him until other men came to his aid.Richardson was turned over to Deputy Sheriff Wright who hurried him to the Bardwell jail. Before dawn Sunday, the prisoner was transferred to the Wickliffe jail. Even then the officers were uneasy that he was not out of reach of the rumored mob, and Richardson was brought to Paducah by order of Judge Sanderson, who convened court at Bardwell Monday morning in the absence of Judge Bugg.\n\nCARD OF THANKS\n\nThis token of heartfelt gratitude to the many kind and helpful friends for their sympathy and kindness during the illness and sad bereavement of their eldest son and brother is extended by Mr. and Mrs. J.

McCann pleaded guilty to manslaughter this afternoon and was sentenced to the penitentiary for an indeterminate sentence.\n\nBEN BRADLEY IS ACQUITTED\n\nArguments Completed Before Dinner and Case Went to the Jury\n\nDEFENDANT TELLS OF THE CRIME\n\nClaiming that He Mistook Negro He Killed for a Chicken Thief\n\nBradley was acquitted at 3:30 this afternoon, when the jury returned a verdict of “not guilty” after having been out for three hours.\n\nAlbert Johnson, alias “Sonny” pleaded guilty to manslaughter this afternoon and was sentenced to fourteen years in the penitentiary at hard labor. Johnson killed another negro on the steamer John A. Wood last November.\n\nThe fate of Ben Bradley, negro and former police officer, rests in the hands of the jury. The attorneys completed their arguments at noon today, at which time the case went to the jury.\n\nThe evidence in the trial of Ben Bradley, former police officer, was presented to the jury Wednesday afternoon, but the closing arguments of the attorney were not made until this morning, after which the instructions were given to the jury.\n\nSeven witnesses were examined by the prosecution and four for the defense, among the latter being Bradley himself, who took the stand in his own behalf.\n\nBen Bradley then took the stand. He testified that he was awakened on the night of Sept. 8, 1911, as he thought, about 10 o’clock, and heard someone enter the gate to his yard. He had been missing many chickens from his hen house and thinking this probably was the thief, went out to apprehend him. When he came out, the man started to run and Bradley followed, catching up with him just outside the gate. A scuffle ensued, the man holding to him with a tight grip, kicking him and biting his hands. He managed to free his right hand in which he held his pistol and struck the man over the head with the gun. This seemed to have no effect on the aggressor and in attempting to strike a second time the man grabbed the gun and in the struggle it went off and the man fell to the ground a corpse. Bradley testified that the man was unknown to him, that he had never seen him before, and that it was after the shooting that he first learned the identity of the deceased. That he didn’t seem to have his senses was his declaration to the jury and he didn’t remember the questioning by Chief Egan shortly after the killing.\n\nPIONEER CITIZEN HAS PASSED AWAY\n\nF. D.

He had not been actively engaged in business for over a year.\n\nMr. Rexford was one of the earliest settlers of Chicago, going there at the time when the only building was the old Fort Dearborn. Because of the swampy conditions of that place, he settled at a place called Blue Island, a few miles north of the Fort Dearborn site, and probably knew more about the early history of Chicago than any man living up to this death and having a remarkable memory, he could picture the sights and happenings at that time, with much interest to his hearers. He was also one of the pioneers that crossed the prairies in 1849, when the gold rush to California occurred and told of many stirring events in the encounter with the Indians.\n\nHe is survived by his daughter, Mrs. Hartman, and one son, Norman Rexford, of Chicago. Funeral services were held in Chicago today and interment made in the Blue Island Cemetery.\n\n(William R. Halliday married Frances A. Rexford on 21 Sep 1882, in Marion Co., Ill.

Today the court listened to several appeal cases and disposed of other minor cases.\n\nThree murder cases were disposed of in the court Thursday afternoon all within a half hour. All morning and part of the afternoon was given over to the trial of Ben Bradley, charged with killing another negro named Henry Smith. The case went to the jury at 1:30 o’clock and after being out about two hours, a verdict exonerating the defendant was returned.\n\nShortly after this came the plea of guilty on the part of Albert Johnson alias “Sonny” Johnson, for manslaughter and he was sentenced to the Chester penitentiary for an indefinite term from one to fourteen years. In less than fifteen minutes after this Charles McCann, indicted for murder of Bennie Hollinshead, pleaded guilty and was given a like sentence.\n\nMcCann shot and killed a river man by the name of Hollinshead in the saloon conducted by Myers Bros. Sixth and Commercial Avenue on the evening of January 27th, the particulars of which are doubtless still fresh in the minds of the people.\n\nAccording to the eye witness the crime was a cold blooded affair. It is alleged the police were forewarned that McCann was out looking for Hollinshead, but they failed to arrest McCann until after he had fulfilled his mission by killing the man who eloped with his wife a number of years ago.\n\nMcCann’s action came as a complete surprise, as it was generally believed that he would fight the case.McCann is said to have been without sufficient funds to engage competent attorneys to defend him.\n\nGus Johnson Case Continued\n\nThe case of police officer Gus Johnson, indicted for the killing of Napoleon Lipe by the grand jury, was continued until the next term of the circuit court which convened in May\n\nThe Cairo Evening Citizen, Saturday, 24 Feb 1912:\n\nDEATH SENTENCE FOR RICHARDSON\n\nWill Be Electrocuted at Eddyville on April 19th\n\nA long distance message from Bardwell this afternoon stated that Richardson was sentenced to death in the electric chair.

Harkless, at Wickliffe, of apoplexy. He was taken suddenly ill while attending to some matters at the courthouse Friday afternoon and grew worse until death ended his suffering Sunday morning.\n\nHe was interested in the banking business at Wickliffe and also had extensive farming interest in Ballard County. He was well known in Cairo, making frequent business trips here.

Less than two hours later, the jury marched up the aisle before Special Judge Sandridge and passed to the clerk their verdict, which sends the slayer to death in the electric chair.\n\nThe Trial\n\nAt 10:15 o’clock, after one hour and a quarter of hard labor, a jury finally was chosen from the venire of 150 men. But two witnesses took the stand for the prosecution. Each told how Richardson ran against Violett, cursed the dead man and then emptied the contents of a revolver into his body. Throughout all testimony, the crowd sat quietly.\n\nAt 10:30 o’clock, with head bowed, and almost too weak to reach the witness stand, Richardson told his story of the murder. Contrary to the general opinion, Richardson did not put up a plea of insanity. Instead, he acknowledged the crime in anything but a steady voice. “I was drunk,” he said “and didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know what I was doing and wouldn’t have shot Violett. I was not at myself.”\n\nIn defense of Richardson, Attorney Shelbourne made a powerful appeal for the murderer on the plea that he was drunk and did not realize the enormity of the crime he committed. Following this, Commonwealth’s Attorney Robert L. Smith, of Clinton, in a slow but impressive argument, told the jury the prosecution’s side of the case. He said the crime was one of the worst committed in Carlisle and that the death sentence must be imposed on such a character as that which Richardson had proven himself to be.\n\nAfter the Trial\n\nFollowing the pronouncing of the sentence, Richardson asked that he be allowed to speak with Judge Sandridge. With tears in his eyes, the judge listened to the man’s story at the conclusion of which he thanked the court. After a handshake he left the courtroom.\n\nWhen he arrived at the jail for the second time he played several games of cards.\n\nShortly after news of Richardson’s conviction had been received at the county jail, County Jailer Henry Houser and Deputy Jailer Charles B. Whittemore were called to the door which opens in the iron cage, wherein white male prisoners are kept. After ascertaining that Richardson had confessed to the murder of John Violett and that he had been sentenced to the electric chair, Jerry Moran, an aged man in jail for an alleged petty theft, told the jailers of the murderer’s confession, in which he (Richardson) had killed Violett because of an old grudge he had held against Violett for several years.\n\n“I killed two men down in Texas ten years ago.” Richardson is said to have remarked “and if I could have got something to kill a nigger with, I’d got away from Bardwell. The nigger was guarding me by himself.”\n\nThe murderer also told Moran why he had killed Violett. “It’s like this,” Richardson said. “Some time ago Violett and me had some trouble about a trade about a sow and some pigs. I made up my minds I was going to get him. Saturday afternoon I was full of whiskey and drunk. When I saw Violett coming down the street, I thought I just might as well kill him then as any other time, and I pulled my gun and fired.\n\n“I don’t care about dying for it. I got my man and I’m satisfied. The ___ ___ ___ ought to have died long time ago.”\n\nFollowing this, Richardson, according to Moran, asked him to write his mother, who is blind, and tell her “that I died game. Tell her not to worry about me. Tell her I was in the big ring to the last.”\n\nRichardson also confessed he was a dope fiend and that he used morphine excessively. He claims to escape conviction for one of his Texas murders by an insanity plea and the second by establishing an alibi. Another man, innocent, is serving a term for the second crime. A full confession from Richardson probably will be forwarded to Governor Colquitt, of Texas.\n\nFORMER VIENNA CITIZEN DEAD\n\nWilliam C. Simpson, formerly of Vienna, Ill., but late of Evanston, Ill., died Saturday afternoon at Asheville, N.C., of pneumonia. He went to Asheville in January following a nervous breakdown and was steadily recuperating when he took down with a severe cold and died suddenly.\n\nMr. Simpson married a niece of Mrs. Walter Warder, of this city, and was well known here. He was a son of the late F. M. Simpson and was one of the best known citizens of Johnson County, where he spent most of his life. He was mayor of Vienna for several years and was also a member of the board of education. He was prominent in pharmaceutical affairs of the state and was at one time resident of the state board of pharmacy. He was one of the chief promoters of the Johnson County fairs and was quite an amateur turfman.\n\nHe has been located in Evanston for about 18 months where he conducted the Northwestern Pharmacy, having removed there from Vienna.\n\nHe leaves a wife and four children, three girls, Janet, Frances, Florence, and one son, William, all of them being under age. He also leaves his mother, Mrs. Margaret Simpson, of Vienna, and Marion Simpson, a brother, who is an instructor at the University of Illinois at Champaign.\n\nMr. Simpson was a member of the Cairo Commandery No. 13 Knights Templar, who will probably have charge of the funeral, which will be announced on the arrival of the body.\n\nThe remains will pass through Cairo in the morning and funeral will be held at Vienna tomorrow afternoon, in charge of the Masonic lodge of Vienna. Cairo Commandery No. 13, K. T. will act as an escort of honor. Friends will go to Vienna on the morning train to attend the funeral.\n\n(Francis M. Simpson married Maggie A. Copeland on 24 Oct 1871, in Massac Co., Ill.—Darrel Dexter)\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Tinsely died at her home here (Unity) Monday night "
