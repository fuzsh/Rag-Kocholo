        "text": "To Catch a Thief (1955), a lightly suspenseful romantic thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is presented by Reel 13, Saturday, July 20 at 9 p.m. on THIRTEEN and thirteen.org/live (See all upcoming Reel 13 Double Features on schedule).\n\nAfter achieving one of his greatest career triumphs the year before with Rear Window, Hitchcock needed a break—and managed to get one at the same time as producing and directing his next blockbuster hit, To Catch a Thief. Featuring spectacular French Riviera locations, the film stars Cary Grant as John Robie, a former jewel thief known as “The Cat,” whose nine lives have included a stint in the French Resistance as well as time in prison. Robie is living in splendid retirement at his mountainside villa when the newspapers begin reporting a string of jewel robberies all bearing his trademark style.\n\nAnxious to avoid breaking his parole and finding himself back in jail, Robie is even more motivated than the police are to find the identity of the new “Cat” who is prowling the exclusive Cote D’Azur hotels nearby. With the help of a Lloyds of London insurance agent, played by Hitchcock favorite John Williams, Robie masquerades as an Oregon lumber tycoon, making the acquaintance of a Mrs. Stevens, played by Jessie Royce Landis, a wealthy American widow who is traveling with her beautiful daughter Frances, portrayed by Grace Kelly at her most ravishing.\n\nAnd so begins a new cat and mouse game, with Frances determined to uncover Robie’s true identity as Robie tries to anticipate the mysterious thief’s next move by shadowing “the Cat’s” likely targets. Along the way, Hitchcock managed to fly just under the radar of Hollywood’s production code censors with some sly tongue in cheek dialogue that keeps the chemistry between Grant and Kelly crackling.\n\nTo Catch a Thief was Hitchcock’s third and final film with Grace Kelly, following Dial M for Murder and Rear Window, both released one year earlier in 1954. The pair enjoyed a warm friendship, with Kelly arguably representing the ultimate example of the “cool Hitchcockian blonde” archetype. Kelly had turned down co-starring with Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront to work with Hitchcock again on Rear Window, and had agreed to do To Catch a Thief before a leading man was in place.\n\nTo get Cary Grant, Hitchcock had to lure him out of his self-professed retirement. After a series of disappointing films in the early 1950s, Grant had dropped out of the movie business, passing on a number of high profile offers. But the prospect of working with Grace Kelly and shooting on French Riviera locations proved irresistible. In the end, To Catch a Thief resulted in an enduring friendship with Kelly and turned out to be one of Grant’s favorite films.\n\nAs for Grace Kelly, To Catch a Thief proved auspicious: although she did not meet Prince Rainier of Monaco while location shooting on the French Riviera, the two would soon encounter each other during Kelly’s participation at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. Kelly would make only two more films before marrying Rainier in 1956 and retiring from acting. Despite sporadic attempts to bring Kelly back to the silver screen, High Society would become her last film in 1956."
