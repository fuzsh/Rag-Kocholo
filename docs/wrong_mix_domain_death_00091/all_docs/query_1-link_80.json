One charity which the ladies don’t advertise is their ongoing effort to permit lonely bachelors to die with smiles on their faces–by serving said bachelors elderberry wine spiked with arsenic. When the sisters’ drama-critic nephew Mortimer (Cary Grant) stumbles onto their secret, he is understandably put out–especially since he has just married the lovely Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). Given the homicidal tendencies of his aunts, the sinister activities of his escaped-convict older brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) and the disruptive behavior of younger brother Teddy (John Alexander)–who is convinced that he’s really Theodore Roosevelt, and runs around the house yelling “CHAAAAARGGGE”–Mortimer isn’t keen on starting a family with his new bride. “Insanity runs in my family,” he explains. “It practically gallops.” Further complications ensue when the murderous Jonathan Brewster arrives home, with his snivelling accomplice Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) in tow. When Jonathan learns that his darling aunts have killed twelve men, he is incensed–they’re challenging his own record of murders. Though the movie rights for Arsenic and Old Lace were set up so that the film could not be released until 1944, director Capra shot the film quickly and inexpensively in 1941, so that his family could subsist on his $100,000 salary while he was serving in World War II. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nPicnic (PG)(1955)\n\nFriday, September 6th @ 7:00 PM\n\nBased on the play by William Inge, the story covers one Labor Day weekend in a small Kansas town, and tells about the impact a virile drifter has on the lives of several women in the town.
