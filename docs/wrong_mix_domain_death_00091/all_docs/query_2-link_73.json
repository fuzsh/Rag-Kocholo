        "text": "In this event Mark Glancy, Reader in Film History at Queen Mary University of London and Kathrina Glitre, Senior Lecturer in Film Studies at University of the West of England, give illustrated talks exploring Cary Grant’s 20-year collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, which led to some of their best and most iconic work. The talks will be followed by a Q&A and discussion chaired by broadcaster and writer Matthew Sweet.\n\nWhilst usually associated with Hitchcock blondes - including co-stars Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint - Hitchcock is known to have had a dismissive attitude towards actors, seeing them as a \"necessary evil\" and comparing them to mannequins, children and even cattle. But Cary Grant was different. Their enduring relationship resulted in some of Grant's finest performances and consolidated his persona as serious actor, which led film-critic David Thomson to claim that he was the \"best and most important actor in the history of cinema\".\n\nAccording to biographer Nancy Nelson, the feeling was mutual: \"Grant prized his relationship with the director and proudly introduced him to George Barrie. Shortly before Hitchcock died, he told Barrie, 'Knowing Cary is the greatest association I've had with any film actor. Cary is the only actor I ever loved in my whole life\"."
