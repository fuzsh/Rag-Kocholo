        "text": "by Charlotte Crofts, UWE Bristol\n\nThis post is being written on the eve of the fourth edition of the Cary Comes Home Festival – taking place this weekend 20-22 November – which has moved fully online this year due to the global pandemic. It is based on what would have been a paper at the BAFTSS 2020 Annual Conference, which sadly had to be cancelled earlier this year.\n\nThe festival is now on its fourth iteration. The first festival took place in October 2014 with a gala double bill at the Bristol Hippodrome, talks at Watershed, Bristol’s Media Arts Cinema, cream teas and cocktails. The second festival took place during Bristol Harbour Festival, celebrating Cary Grant’s sea-faring connections in July 2016 with a gala at Bristol Museum, talks at Watershed, screenings at Everyman cinema and a drink-along screening at Averys Wine Merchants. The third festival took place in 2018 (BBC Online 2018) with events across the city focusing on Cary Grant’s enduring collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock and how some of his earlier screwball roles pre-empt Hitchcock’s darker performances. Each festival culminates in a gala screening with wrap-around content, live music, cocktails and a best-dressed competition. Another strand through all the iterations is tying events to Bristol locations relevant to Grant’s life and work. A key case in point being the Looking for Archie: Cary Grant’s Bristol (Crofts 2017), a walking tour of Bristol City Centre that first took place 18 & 19 November 2017 as part of the national Being Human Festival.\n\nKael acknowledges how Grant’s national identity informs his complex star persona: “Grant was English, so Hollywood thought he sounded educated and was just right for rich playboys, but he didn’t speak in the gentlemanly tones that American moviegoers think of as British” (Kael, 1975). However she doesn’t specify his Bristolian-ness. My research examines the festival’s role in relocating Grant within Bristol, drawing on theories of stardom, fandom and cinematic tourism around four central research questions:\n\nHow did a working-class lad from Bristol, a provincial city in the South West of England, go on to become one of the world’s most enduring stars whose image still circulates globally.\n\nHow does the material landscape of Bristol inform visitors’ understanding of Cary Grant’s onscreen identity?\n\nWhat motivates fans to make the pilgrimage to Bristol?\n\nAnd, what does Grant’s stardom mean for the identity of the city today, now a UNESCO City of Film?\n\nThe project addresses the themes of the archaeologies of, exhibition as, and archiving screen culture – treating Bristol as a living archive through which and in which we can develop and our understanding of Grant’s star identity.\n\nGrant grew up in poverty within a troubled family dynamic, which contributed to the loss of his mother Elsie Kingdon to mental illness in Feb 1915, when he was eleven (Glancy 2020). Having been led to believe that his mother was dead, Archie roamed the streets of Bristol, bunking off school, working backstage at the Bristol Hippodrome and the Empire Theatre and hanging about the docks where the tall ships sailed right into the city centre, yearning to escape to distant lands:\n\nI sat alone for hours watching the ships come and go, sailing with them to far places on the tide of my imagination, trying to release myself from the emotional tensions which disarranged my thoughts. (Grant 1963)\n\nIt was only years later, once he’d found fame as Cary Grant, that Archie discovered that his mother was not dead. She had been committed to mental hospital whilst his father Elias Leach set up house with another woman. This fostered an ongoing tension in Grant’s on and off-screen persona between lightness and dark, between Archie and Cary, which he identified in his autobiography:\n\nI have spent the greater part of my life fluctuating between Archie Leach and Cary Grant; unsure of either, suspecting each. Only recently have I begun to unify them into one person: the man and boy in me, the hate and the love and all the degrees of each in me, and the power of God in me. (Cary 1963)\n\nWhilst many people know Grant was born in Bristol, fewer are aware that he had an enduring relationship with the city, returning often, well into his seventies, even after his mother died. My project is not to re-rehearse his biography here, but to show how Bristol played an ongoing part in his life. As a port town, Grant’s experience growing up in Bristol laid the foundations for the journey he was later to take on the RMS Olympic when he emigrated to America with the Pender Troupe of Acrobats, arriving in New York on 28 July. Archie lived there for over 10 years developing his craft, first in vaudeville, then in a music hall on the Broadway stage, before setting off in a yellow open-top Packard in November 1931 for Hollywood, where he changed his name and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nLooking for Archie\n\nThe first Looking for Archie walking tour took place the weekend before The Bishop’s Wife screening at Bristol Cathedral in November 2017. Although 2017 was a “fallow” year, so there was no weekend festival, we curated several fringe or pop-up events throughout the year: Cary Grant’s birthday screening of Charade at Fairlawn Primary School, the original site of Fairfield School on 18th January; Valentine Day screening of Holiday starring Katharine Hepburn at Bristol Cathedral; drink-along Halloween screening of Arsenic and Old Lace at Averys Wine Merchants; and The Bishop’s Wife Christmassy screening at Bristol Cathedral, in November to coincide with the Christmas Fayre and ice-rink in Millennium Square next to the Cary Grant statue. The starting point for the walk was deliberately tied in to our venue partners and enabled us to cross-promote, including distributing the Being Human programmes at the Cathedral.\n\nThe tour builds on my previous research on screen heritage and place-making, drawing on the emerging discipline of New Cinema History, which focuses on the socio-cultural history of cinema, including her award-winning Curzon Memories App (Best Multimedia Award, Learning on Screen 2013) and The Lost Cinemas of Castle Park App – which uncovers Bristol hidden city centre cinemas – a project that emerged out of the City Strata AHRC REACT Heritage Sandbox. Both of these apps were tested with young people, including students at Fairfield, Grant’s old school. Based on user-feedback, it was discovered that cinema history really comes alive when experienced in the location where it actually happened. The tour retraces Archie’s hometown haunts, and uncovers Bristol’s hidden cinema history, in the places where it actually happened, leading participants on a guided tour of Bristol City Centre and offering insights into both the locations the young Archibald Leach used to frequent, and the places at which he was photographed by the Bristol Evening Post on his many visits home after he’d become Cary Grant (See Figs 1 & 2). The tour has 12 points and is supported by an accompanying map:\n\nThe tour ran twice over the weekend with about 20 participants on each run. We started at Bristol Cathedral on College Green, where Grant is pictured above (see Fig 1) and ended at the Cary Grant Statue in Millennium Square (see Figs 6 & 7) in which the statue is standing in exactly the same pose as Fig 1. Along the way, participants learn about how a school trip to the Hippodrome inspired Cary Grant’s aspiration to become an actor and the cinemas he frequented with his mother and father. We also visited the ruin of St Peter’s Church, which has a plaque with the names of several Leach relatives who died in the Bristol Blitz.\n\nEvaluation\n\nParticipants were asked to fill out an anonymous evaluation questionnaire at the end of the tour as part of an Impact Case Study. There were 36 responses (out of roughly 40 who attended the two walks overall). Whilst the majority of participants already knew that Cary Grant was from Bristol (91.4%), fewer were aware of his ongoing relationship with the city (74.3%). 22.9% hadn’t realised that he returned regularly to Bristol until well into his old age, and 2.9% were only partially aware of this. The majority of respondents agreed that the walk had changed their view of Bristol (60%), with an additional 25.7% saying their view of Bristol had partly been changed. A large majority of people felt that the tour had changed their understanding of Cary Grant (74.3%) or partly changed it (11.4%).\n\nDigging down into the qualitative feedback, people’s view of Bristol was changed by a better understanding of local history and buildings (2/30), the effect of War on Bristol (4/30) and Castle Park in particular (7/30), as well as new knowledge about Bristol’s cinema history (7/30). Several people felt that they had seen another side of the city either offering “a different point of view on familiar places” (3/30) or introducing them to places that they had not seen before (7/30), “after living here for 85 years I still learnt a few points”!\n\nThe most significant way in which participants’ view of Grant changed was in gaining a better understanding of his ongoing connections to Bristol, and the warmth and affection he felt for the city of his birth (10/26, 38.5%). 5/26 respondents learnt that he was more “down to earth” than they had realised, saying the tour “made him more human”; and 3/26 though this life was more “complex” than they’d realised. The tour also gave participants a new perspective on Cary Grant’s early life, his family and mother in particular (9/26), his marriages (2/26) and the possibility he may have been bisexual (1/26). People learnt about “places of significance” and in particular his connections to Bristol theatres (2/36).\n\nFamily Connections\n\nFinally, on one of the tours, two separate branches of Elsie Kingdon’s family (Cary Grant’s mother) met each other for the first time. This encounter “renewed my interest in possible family connections”, and as “Kingdon, put us in touch with another family member”. Here’s an additional quote from one of these attendees who was related to Cary Grant:\n\n“My sister […] and I thoroughly enjoyed the ‘Looking for Archie’ walking tour and can’t wait to attend the next event. It was really lovely meeting everyone and being part of the Cary Grant Festival. Your passion and enthusiasm, definitely left us both wanting to learn more about Archie Leach, our family connection and the history of Cinema in Bristol. I was born in the city, but left when I was twenty. The tour has made me appreciate how special a place Bristol is and how little I know about it. Thank you again for a really interesting and fun event” (Personal email 20/11/2017).\n\nOverall, feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with 27/32 commenting enthusiastically: “absolutely brilliant”, “a must for anyone interested in films or Bristol history”, “excellent”, “fun”, “enjoyable”, “wonderful”, etc. People generally found the tour informative and well-researched (15/32), well-presented (10/32) including comments on the “passion” and “enthusiasm” of the tour-guide, Charlotte Crofts; others felt it was well-organised (6/32). People also enjoyed the act of walking itself and following Cary Grant’s “footsteps” (4/32). A few people mentioned enjoying the walk despite the November weather.\n\nAccessibility\n\nTwo separate respondents mentioned hearing: “Guide was very good and although I am hard of hearing I heard 90% of her talk” and “I really enjoyed the tour, though at times it was hard to hear” – several stops on the walk are next to busy roads (particularly the one on the roundabout over the Temple Way underpass) or building works. This is something to watch out for in future tours.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Looking for Archie walking tour has contributed to audience development for the biennial Cary Comes Home Festival. The tour was reprised at the 2018 Festival, including training an additional tour guide to run a bespoke walking tour for SAGA members. It also ran in 2019. There is potential for the tour to be developed into an app or a web-based interactive map to enable people to access the content independently and this could be expanded over time to become city-wide or even international in scope. For example, we had exciting plans to take the festival to New York for the actual anniversary of Archie’s arrival in the Big Apple in July 2020 – greeting him at dawn on Pier 59; a screening of The Awful Truth at Film Forum; an illustrated talk at Film Lincoln and a one-day symposium in partnership with CUNY Graduate Centre, opposite the Empire State Building (“it’s the closest thing to heaven, you were there”) – but sadly they weren’t to be, and we all know why. We had to get creative and find ways to bring this planned activity online. This included using Google Maps and Google Earth to do a guided tour of Archie’s New York remotely in the Greeting Cary Grant event:\n\nCary Comes Home 2020\n\nThis year’s festival was always going to be themed around the idea of Journeys, celebrating the 100th anniversary of Grant’s first transatlantic voyage to the United States, the beginning of his incredible journey to international stardom. Journeys feature in many of his films, from the 2,000-mile chase of North by Northwest to the cruise ship romance in An Affair to Remember. We are also interested in exploring the idea of the journey not only in terms of geography, place, space and physical travels (both real life and on film), but also in terms of psychological journeys: voyages of identity, self-discovery and self-invention. View our video essay entries on The Journeys of Cary Grant: An Audio-Visual Celebration So, we now have a virtual film festival which is themed around Journeys at precisely the moment when we can’t be together in a cinema and we are not able to travel! Stay home with Cary Comes Home if you like. Added to this is the inability to stream repertory films because of the distribution rights, which means that all our “screenings” have to be watch-alongs where the audience sources the films themselves. These include a spotlight on George Stevens, including Penny Serenade and Gunga Din and the Love Affairs to Remember Marathon. There are also two talks, including Mark Glancy discussing Cary Grant’s Wanderlust and me on another Bristol-born super-star Nipper the His Master’s Voice dog, who co-stars in Penny Serenade! Our challenge is to create a sense of togetherness in isolation – bringing people together around our shared love of Cary Grant. We’ll let you know how it goes!\n\nThis blog post has sought to rethink Grant’s British identity as specifically Bristolian, exploring how curating the Cary Comes Home Festival can underpin a re-evaluation of Grant’s star identity. By relocating the discussion of Grant’s stardom to the regional rather than the national, and embedding it in a specific place, it is hoped that the festival offers a model for other star studies to connect their objects of study to their locations and offer a more nuanced and site-specific understanding of stardom.\n\n—–\n\nMore information about the 2020 festival programme is available on the Cary Comes Home website.
