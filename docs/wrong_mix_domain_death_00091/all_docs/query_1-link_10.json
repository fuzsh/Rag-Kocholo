He said he intended to run everyone out of the camp and was going to kill everyone. After saying this he started to his house saying to me, ‘I am going to kill you.’ He then began to call me all kinds of foul names. I went to my office and got a revolver in case he carried out his intentions I would have some means of protection, little thinking at the time, however, I would be forced to use it. Now this was after sundown, but I could see things around me. I was standing in front of the cook tent when he came out of his house. In the tent were some women and children, who seemed much alarmed. He came near me and with his hands behind him said with an oath, ‘I have you now where I want you.’\n\n“At this junction I shot, killing him instantly.\n\n“They did not arrest me but put me under $500 bond. Even the man’s own father-in-law said, ‘You did right,’ while his wife said that he was a hard man to get along with.”\n\nThe funeral services were held over the remains of H. B.

Bouscher, of Douglas Street.—Jury Exonerates Cleland.\n\nMrs. H. H. Cox, of Murphysboro, a niece of Mr. Charles S. Bouscher, of 424 Douglas Street, met with a sad accident Saturday night, which resulted in her death.\n\nHance Cleland, a high school boy, who roomed with Superintendent Ellis H. Rogers, was about to retire when he heard someone prowling about the yard. Taking a revolver, he stepped out on the porch and asked who was there and, as he did so, saw the form of someone disappearing in the darkness. He called to the party to halt, and as the person failed to do so, he fired several shots.\n\nHe went in search of the supposed burglar and was sure that he saw him enter and hide in a coal shed in the next yard.\n\nAgain he called out to the party to come out or he would shoot, and hearing no response he again fired.\n\nOn investigation it was found that Mrs. Cox had entered her coal shed and the bullet had pierced her body, killing her almost instantly.\n\nThe theory is that Mrs. Cox went into her own back yard attracted by the shooting and had entered the shed when the boy fired. It is thought the burglar made his escape when the boy first shot.\n\nThe jury exonerated Cleland for the shooting. The boy is very much broken up over the deplorable affair.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bouscher were unable to attend the funeral.\n\n(H. H.
