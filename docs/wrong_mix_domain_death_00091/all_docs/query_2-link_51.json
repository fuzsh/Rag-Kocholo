        "text": "It has always seemed to me that one appealing reason for going to a football match, apart from dutifully watching the play, is that we never quite know who we are going to meet. Half a century ago, yes really that long, I had a fleeting unscheduled half-time encounter at Ashton Gate, home of Bristol City, with Cary Grant. He'd been invited by the club's then chairman Harry Dolman, who had an opportunistic and civilised habit of asking celebrities – proper ones in those days – along on a spare Saturday afternoon to view his warriors.\n\nArchie Leach's allegiance to Bristol was unquestioned. He had been born in the city, had gone to a local grammar school, from where he had been expelled for a minor and hushed-up felony committed near the girls' toilets, and now continued to return to the West Country from the world of glamorous celluloid to visit his mother, Elsie, who had a history of mental illness.\n\nBut, in truth, he had no more than a passing schoolboy's cigarette-card regard for football and it could be argued that his home had been nearer to the Rovers ground than City's. When he left school he was more seduced by the backstage smells and bustle at the Hippodrome and Empire, where he joined an acting troupe and did a stint as call-boy, than wanting to kick a ball with his chums on Horfield Common.\n\nHere he was now, however, passing me on the cold, uncarpeted steps leading up to the boardroom. His appearance was impossibly elegant. He should have had Grace Kelly on his arm. I felt I should say something at this seminal moment. Cary Grant had always been a distant hero of mine. My old sports editor and mentor on my evening paper in Bristol had once been the lift boy and he was used to taking the famous film star up to the editorial floor for an interview or new picture from the roof of the Northcliffe building. And he would be asked by his handsome charge how City and Rovers were doing, even if no more than a duty-bound inquiry.\n\nNow passing him on the steps at Ashton Gate, I noticed how well proportioned he was. City's physio, if only they had one with that title in those days, wouldn't have had to work too strenuously on central defender Grant. In my fledgling days on a paper, which I found bubbling with youthful zest despite declining circulation, we were encouraged to save our employer's money by being versatile.\n\nApart from recording Big John Atyeo's mountainous goal tally, we were asked to be always on the look‑out for contributions to the gossip column. Here, in my consternation as I confronted an idol, was surely the chance to take Bristol City's too often rather dowdy deeds on to another human plain. A snatched supposedly esoteric word from me maybe about Mary Pickford, Mae West or Jean Harlow? Hints of Dyan Cannon as a future wife No4? Even a mischievous throwaway about Cary's shared company with Randolph Scott? But all I mumbled self-consciously was: \"Not a bad game so far, is it?\" Hardly a conversational pearl. I've no idea how he responded to such banality.\n\nChairman Dolman enjoyed playing host and extended his match-day invitations to local civic dignitaries and, with a reasonably impartial selection, to most of Bristol's MPs in rotation. In the same way, the city's ageless light comedian Randolph Sutton, of Mother Kelly's doorstep fame, who used to pack the ancient Theatre Royal in the days when Dolman was a boy, was always welcome to a drink with the club directors when he wasn't making one of his innumerable comeback shows.\n\nMaybe it was Captain Albert Prince-Cox who started the fashion. He used to be the Bristol Rovers manager, the most extrovert and imaginative they ever had. In the 1930s he dispensed gimmicks with the deft touch of a showman. He was a boxing promoter, paying Len Harvey in readies after the soon-to-be champion topped the bill at the Colston Hall. He matched muscle‑bound rugby opponents against each other in the ring. He had short‑term signings flown to Bristol in days when players didn't travel that way.\n\nApart from being an entrepreneur, a bit of a chancer, a skilful meteorologist and a football manager, Prince-Cox was – not surprisingly – quite a performer himself. He had appeared on the halls as an impressionist. He had plenty of friends in show business. And quite a lot of them, those topping the bill at the Hippodrome as part of a run, would turn up by invitation at Rovers home games.\n\nYet when it came to VIPs at local matches, Cary Grant's presence was the undisputed coup. On a day when Ashton Gate looked scruffy and not particularly inviting, he still gave it style. Pity I can't remember the score. Or why I couldn't come up with a single sensible, gossip‑disguised question for him."
