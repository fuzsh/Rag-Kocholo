        "text": "The photo that’s been at the top of this blog all these years is a quintessential farm shot I took one morning outside of Decorah, Iowa where I was shooting a short film. The anchor in the shot is the barn and silo in the left part of the photo.\n\nThat’s classic Iowa. And I hadn’t thought about that photo in years until today when I read this quote about the silo used in A Quiet Place.\n\n“Where we grew up [in Iowa] was a healthy mixture of city life and farm life. We lived in the city, but you would hear about grain silos being one of the most dangerous things you can fall into. It’s basically like drowning, but in dry grain. It was terrifying to drive by them on country roads. Early in the writing process we said, ‘That has to be part of the setpieces.’”\n\nScreenwriter Scott Beck (A Quiet Place)Filmmaker Magazine interview with Matt Mulcahey\n\nHere’s a clip where the young actors Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jope discuss shooting that scene inside a silo surrounded by corn.\n\nHere’s what part of that scene looked like on the page of the original screenplay.\n\nThat silo scene reminds me a little of the Mt. Rushmore scene in Hitchcock’s North By Northwest.\n\nP.S. You want to know an odd connection between North By Northwest and A Quiet Place. Cary Grant, who starred in North By Northwest, died in Davenport, Iowa. Where did A Quiet Place screenwriters (Beck and Bryan Woods) grow up and begin making movies? Davenport/Bettendorf, Iowa. (Part of what’s known as the Quad Cities.) Check out my 2010 post Cary Grant and T. Bone…”somewhere in Iowa.” I don’t just make this stuff up. Check out Cary Grant’s IMDB page and see where he died. Then look up Bryan Woods IMDB page and see where he was born.\n\nIt’s a small, small world."
