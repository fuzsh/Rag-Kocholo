        "text": "After the onset of his symptoms in November 1986, Grant was forced to cancel a question-and-answer show at an Iowa theatre.\n\nDuring rehearsals for the show, he was reportedly fine and healthy but soon was rushed to the nearby hospital. He died soon after.\n\nA cardiologist at St. Luke’s Hospital called Doctor James Gilson, who treated Grant, told the New York Times: “There was nothing that could be done.\n\n“There's no intervention when something like this happens.”\n\nREAD MORE: Diabetes: The yellow drink that 'significantly' improves blood sugar levels within hours\n\n“I was never able to form attachments. If I had paid more attention I might have found contentment in marriage.”\n\nOver the years he sought the help of the illegal drug, LSD, which he claimed “saved” his life from the buildup of unnecessary mental tension.\n\nHe is reported to have said: “After weeks of treatment came the day when I saw the light. When I broke through, I felt a cleansing of my fears and guilt.\n\n“It was a waste of so many years. The shock of each revelation brings with it an anguish of sadness for what was not known before in the wasted years of ignorance and, at the same time, an ecstasy of joy at being freed from the shackles of such ignorance.“I lost all the tension I have been crippling myself with, a wasting of so many years.”\n\nAlthough many illegal drugs are said to increase the risk of having a stroke, according to some studies, there is no comprehensive evidence that LSD can cause a stroke."
