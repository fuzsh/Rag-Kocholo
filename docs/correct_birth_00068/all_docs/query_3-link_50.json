I have always felt that the ability to film principal photography actors in accurate, authentic costumes created by designers, crafted from precision to the sets carved from concept art, is the ultimate bridge and extension of fantasy and has become a reality.\n\nSeeing actors run around for a few moments and look like children may seem trivial to many, but I feel a promise of achievement. Still, I think that’s the disconnection from audiences and the solace of dreams withering away juxtaposed to the memories we possess but are afraid to recognize.\n\nIt’s hard to admit that the times we reside in are tough, and fate changes on a whim, but the stability of escaping from films is the doorway most people don’t realize. So, as I admitted before, knowing that Metropolis is a tangible place using the topography of Atlanta, GA, or Cleveland, OH, is a feeling of reassurance. Having seen the set leaks, I confess I’m eagerly anticipating Gunn’s unique vision.\n\nI enjoy the lack of green screen and the overabundance of CGI, which is nowhere to be found, and I feel that’s how films should be. Sets are sandboxes crafted by production designers, and extras gather around, making the environment feel tangible and organic. All in service of making the amazing fantasy liveable. Isn’t that the goal of entertainment, which, as a bigger picture, falls under the umbrella of art?\n\nArt is supposed to elicit emotion, reaction, and expressive intentions, so to say that I’m excited about the promise of being able to believe that a man in red underwear can fly and soar like a god with the humility of a person gives me reason to carry on.\n\nAs the auteur, Gunn has repeatedly shown how to balance raw emotion with sweet laughter and humor. So why not let him take a chance at the embodiment and legacy of the farm boy from Kansas?\n\n“Superman” stars David Corenswet as Clark Kent/Superman, Rachel Brosnahan as star-studded Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane, Skyler Gisondo as photographer Jimmy Olsen, Wendell Pierce as Perry White, Nicholas Hoult as classic antagonist Lex Luthor, Neva Howell as Marhta Kent, Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan “Pa” Kent, Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, Mikaela Hoover as Cat Grant, and Christopher McDonald as Ron Troupe.\n\nThe cast also includes Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher, Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Terence Rosemore as Otis, Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner and María Gabriela de Faría as The Engineer.\n\n“Superman” is slated to open in theaters on July 11, 2025"
