The former Dutch and English colonial settlement is currently home to a “Little Taiwan” and “Koreatown” along with large Afghan, Bangladeshi, Indian, Mainland Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Spanish-speaking influences. The diverse neighborhood’s heart is the hustling-and-bustling Main Street, which features countless hotels, markets, performance venues, restaurants, and stores. It’s a great place to dine, hosting regional cuisines from every corner of the globe, with the most sought-after spots in NYC for foodies-in-the-know.\n\nThe neighborhood Flushing has more Chinese residents and businesses than the neighborhood Chinatown in Manhattan.\n\n*Flushing Town Hall\n\n*Kingsland Homestead\n\nKupferberg Center for the Arts\n\nGodwin-Ternbach Museum\n\n*Lewis Latimer House Museum\n\n*Quaker Meeting House\n\n*The Bowne House\n\nFor more recommendations and hidden gems, check out www.flushingfantastic.nyc\n\nCorona\n\nThis Queens neighborhood that Louis Armstrong, Cannonball Adderley and a very young Martin Scorsese called home has long been a hotbed of immigration from Latin America and is one of the best places in the City to get authentic cuisine from Cuba, Mexico and beyond—try some homemade tortillas. The neighborhood has Italian heritage, too—perhaps most evident at the universally loved Lemon Ice King of Corona. Corona also is the home of Flushing Meadows Corona Park, (www.allianceforfmcp.org ) the fourth biggest public space in New York City. With 898 acres, it is 55 acres larger than Central Park in Manhattan with a wonderful mix of flora, fauna, waterways, paths, athletic facilities, statues, and cultural organizations.\n\nHighlights/Attractions within Flushing Meadows Corona Park:\n\nCiti Field\n\nNew York Hall of Science\n\nQueens Botanical Garden\n\nQueens Museum\n\nQueens Theatre\n\nQueens Zoo\n\nUSTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center\n\nWorld’s Fair Marina\n\n*Louis Armstrong House Museum\n\nForest Hills/Rego Park\n\nForest Hills’ gently rolling rows of Tudor houses and tulip trees are secluded and relaxed. The area sometimes feels like a throwback, with old-school pizza parlors, sweets shops, knisheries and a train station that looks unchanged from when Teddy Roosevelt spoke there 100 years ago. Famous for Forest Hills Stadium, the venue the Beatles played in 1964 (reborn as a concert stage in 2013), the neighborhood is partially bordered by Forest Park, which holds a popular golf course, and is renowned as the birthplace of the Ramones and Simon & Garfunkel and as the childhood home of Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man).\n\nForest Hills Stadium\n\nForest Park\n\nJamaica\n\nBest known to outsiders as a transportation center connecting parts of NYC to John F. Kennedy International Airport, this enclave contains a patchwork of cultures, including immigrants from India, the Caribbean, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Sri Lanka. The local cuisine reflects that heritage, with a collection of international groceries and restaurants along Liberty Avenue. The neighborhood also features the 200-year-old King Manor Museum, a National Historic Landmark and the former home of Rufus King, a New York senator and signer of the Constitution.\n\nBaisley Pond Park\n\nBlack Spectrum Theatre Company\n\nJamaica Center for Arts and Learning\n\n*King Manor\n\nResorts World Casino New York City\n\nThe Afrikan Poetry Theatre\n\nYork College Performing Arts Center\n\nMaspeth/Ridgewood\n\n“File: Church of the Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal\n\nRidgewood Queens NY.JPG” by Maspetheer (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThe area known today as Maspeth was chartered by Dutch and English settlers in the mid-17th century. Maspeth is currently a neighborhood of families, small shops and businesses, and restaurants. Maspeth is also a community for great dining with its many restaurants, diners, delicatessens, bakeries and other fine eateries.\n\nThe Knockdown Center\n\n*Vander-Ende Onderdonk House\n\nRockaway\n\nAn 11-mile-long peninsula with great beaches featuring waves and sandcastles, Rockaway has been a popular summer resort since the 1830s. There are countless seasonal attractions – surfing shops, jetski rentals, ambulant ice cream vendors – but Rockaway is also a residential area with suburban homes and community bars.\n\nJacob Riis Park Known as “The People’s Beach,”\n\nRiis Park Beach Bazaar\n\nRockaway Artists Alliance\n\nRockaway Theatre Company\n\nRockaway Water Park\n\nSunnyside/Woodside\n\n“Sunnyside Queens 2012”\n\nby NYCDOT (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\n\nEstablished in the early 20th century by Irish settlers, the planned community of Sunnyside Gardens now sits as a treasured historic district in Sunnyside. The neighborhood retains a heavy Irish influence – especially when it comes to cuisine – and a verdant vibe with courtyards and tree-lined streets. It also boasts residents from around the world – including Romania, Korea, Greece and South America – making a trip to the neighborhood’s shops, restaurants and pubs an intriguing wander.\n\n*Calvary Cemetery\n\nDoughboy Park\n\nThalía Spanish Theatre"
