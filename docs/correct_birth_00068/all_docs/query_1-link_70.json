        "text": "Welcome to the official Film/Art Gallery collection of original Martin Scorsese vintage movie posters from his critically acclaimed catalog of timeless cinematic contributions.\n\nMartin Charles Scorsese (born November 17th, 1942) is an American actor, film director, producer, and screenwriter. One of the major figures of Hollywood, he is widely considered as one of the most important and influential directors in film history. Scorsese's body of work explores themes such as Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, Italian-American identity, faith, machismo, crime, and tribalism. Some of Scorsese's films are famous for their liberal use of profanity, the depiction of violence, and rock music. He founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation in 1990, and in 2007, the acclaimed filmmaker founded the World Cinema Foundation, and in 2017, established the African Film Heritage Project.\n\nIn 1971 Martin Scorsese proceeded to Hollywood, where he connected with some of the foremost young directors of the decade, including Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, and George Lucas. He directed a cut-rate Depression-era film for Roger Corman, Boxcar Bertha (1972), and Mean Streets (1973), a personal film about faith and redemption shot in Little Italy starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel.\n\nThe award-winning director has solidified his legacy in filmmaking history by repeatedly collaborating with film technicians and actors, including nine films made with Robert De Niro. Martin Scorsese's films with De Niro are the vigilante-thriller Taxi Driver (1976), the biographical sports drama Raging Bull (1980), the black comedy The King of Comedy (1982), the musical drama New York, New York (1977), the psychological thriller Cape Fear (1991), and the crime films Mean Streets (1973), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Irishman (2019). Scorsese has also been known for his popular collaborations with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, having directed him in five films: the historical epic Gangs of New York (2002), the Howard Hughes biography The Aviator (2004), the crime thriller The Departed (2006), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), and the Wall Street black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The Departed resulted in Scorsese winning the Academy Award for Best Director, as well as winning the award for Best Picture. The iconic Hollywood filmmaker is also popular for his long-time partnership with film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who has edited every Scorsese film starting with Raging Bull. Scorsese's other notable film works are the black comedy After Hours (1985), the romantic drama The Age of Innocence (1993), the historical adventure drama Hugo (2011), and the religious epics The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Kundun (1997) and Silence (2016).\n\nMartin Scorsese is the most-nominated living director with nine nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director and is second only to William Wyler's twelve nominations overall. In 2007, Scorsese was presented with the Kennedy Center Honor at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for his impact in American culture. He also accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1995, and a BAFTA Fellowship in 2012. Scorsese is also a beneficiary of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema and has won an Academy Award, a Palme d'Or, a Cannes Film Festival Award, a Grammy Award, a Silver Lion, three Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and two Directors Guild of America Awards. The Hollywood movie director is also popular for his jobs in television, including directing the pilot episodes of the HBO series Boardwalk Empire and Vinyl, the latter he also co-created. As a fan of rock music, Scorsese has directed various documentaries on the subject after editing Woodstock (1970); those projects include The Last Waltz (1978), No Direction Home (2005), Shine a Light (2008), George Harrison: Living in the Material World (2011), and Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese (2019).\n\nFilm/Art Gallery’s collection of original ­­­­Martin Scorsese movie posters include a rare The Band's farewell performance poster. Also included is an Andrzej Klimowski artwork for the first Polish release for Taxi Driver, a rare Martin Scorsese poster.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery movie posters are original prints and film poster collectibles. These are original movie posters. We do not carry any movie poster reproductions or reprints of any kind."
