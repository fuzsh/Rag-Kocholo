        "text": "Martin Scorsese (born November 17, 1942 in Queens, New York, USA) is an American film director.\n\nA highly acclaimed film director, Scorsese's body of work addresses such themes as Italian-American identity, Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, machismo and the violence endemic in American society. Although he has received much critical acclaim he has never won an Academy Award despite numerous nominations. Scorsese is widely considered one of the most significant and influential of post-war American film makers.\n\nMartin Scorsese came from a working class Italian-American family; his father Luciano Charles Scorsese (1912-1993) and mother Catherine Scorsese (1912-1997) both worked in New York's Garment District. A sickly child, he spent much of his time recovering from asthma at home. It was at this stage in his life that he developed his passion for cinema. His initial desire to become a Catholic priest was forsaken for cinema; the Catholic seminary traded for New York University, where he received his M.A. in Film in 1966."
