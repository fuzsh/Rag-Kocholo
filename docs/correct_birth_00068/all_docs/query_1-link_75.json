        "text": "Arguably one of the greatest directors of all time, Martin Scorsese made some of the most daring films in cinema history. His impressive body of work is a meditation on the visceral nature of violence and male relationships that often reflected his own personal angst growing up in the violent streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side. Starting with \"Mean Streets\" (1973), a gritty look at life in Little Italy, Scorsese made his mark on Hollywood while simultaneously discarding many of its conventions. With his seminal films \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) and \"Raging Bull\" (1980), Scorsese firmly established himself as a top director of his generation.\n\nThough he hit a brief creative lull in the 1980s, films like \"After Hours\" (1985), \"The Color of Money\" (1986) and \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988) would have been welcome additions on any director's résumé. He returned to top form with the hyperkinetic mob tale, \"Goodfellas\" (1990), widely considered by fans to be among his best films. With each passing film - \"Casino\" (1995), \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), \"The Aviator\" (2004) - Scorsese cemented his legendary status, but failed to win the recognition of his peers. Five times nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards, he finally won in 2007 for his exceptional Irish gangster thriller, \"The Departed\" (2006), which gave him the recognition he had long deserved.\n\nBorn Nov. 17, 1942 in Flushing, NY, Scorsese grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in Little Italy. Both his parents, Catherine and Charles, worked in New York's famous Garment District, which afforded them a life lived in tenements, surrounded by winos and vagrants, some of whom left an indelible impression upon Scorsese for the rest his life. He grew up a sickly child, suffering from asthma that kept him indoors while the other neighborhood kids played stickball or ran through the gushing water of an opened fire hydrant. To make their son feel better, his parents took him to the movies, unwittingly fostering what would become a lifelong obsession.\n\nWhen he was eight, he began sketching elaborate shot-by-shot retellings of movies he had seen in the theater. By the time he reached 12, the sketches became originals; often titled \"Directed and Produced by Martin Scorsese.\" An outsider to most because of his asthma, Scorsese nonetheless took part in the coming-of-age rituals for kids growing up in a rough-and-tumble neighborhood; namely helping set up kids for a beating, since he could not partake in the fisticuffs himself. Also present throughout his youth was the Catholic Church, which led him to initially aspire to be a priest. He attended seminary during his adolescence, but discovering girls brought to light other possibilities on how to go about life.\n\nAfter leaving seminary, Scorsese attended Cardinal Hayes High School in The Bronx, before attending New York University, where he earned his bachelor's in English. As an undergrad, he directed his first short film, \"What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?\" (1963), a nine-minute short about an obsessive compulsive writer (Zeph Michaels) who becomes so fixated on a photograph of a man in a boat that he can concentrate on nothing else. Early traces of his experimental style - obviously heavily influenced by Federico Fellini - were evident throughout, including rapid-fire editing and first-person narration. After directing a second short, \"It's Not Just You, Murray!\" (1964), Scorsese graduated with his bachelor's, quickly moving into NYU's master's program for filmmaking in 1966. He made another short, \"The Big Shave\" (1967), which depicted a man shaving his hair and the skin on his head, creating a bloody mess in the bathroom, evidence of Scorsese's unflinching use of violence to underscore a deeper truth; in this case, self-mutilation as a metaphor for the increasingly destructive Vietnam War. With three short films under his belt, Scorsese was ready to take the next bigger step.\n\nWhile pursuing his master's, Scorsese made his directorial debut with \"Who's That Knocking at My Door\" (1967), starring a baby-faced Harvey Keitel as working-class Italian-American from Little Italy who starts dating an educated, uptown girl (Zina Bethune), only to learn she is not a virgin, which clashes with his Catholic upbringing. First developed as a short, then filmed on and off for four years, \"Who's That Knocking\" displayed many of the elements that would eventually become Scorsese trademarks - fluid camera movements, a pulsating soundtrack and a visceral portrayal of violence. Despite its showing at the 1967 Chicago Film Festival, the film waited another two years for a theatrical release. Meanwhile, Scorsese began teaching at NYU, where he helped fellow student, Michael Wadleigh, as an assistant director and editing supervisor on \"Woodstock\" (1969), which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary. In 1971, Scorsese moved to Los Angeles, where he took a work-for-hire gig with Roger Corman, directing the Depression-era crime thriller, \"Boxcar Bertha\" (1972), all in order to gain more professional experience. Upon seeing a rough cut of the film, friend John Cassavetes chided the young director for \"making a piece of sh*t\" and pushed him to do something personal.\n\nScorsese took Cassavetes' words to heart, going to work on what would become his breakthrough film, \"Mean Streets\" (1973), a gritty, semi-autobiographical tale that marked the first of many landmark collaborations with actor Robert De Niro. Scorsese returned to the rough-and-tumble neighborhood of Little Italy, where he explored the struggles of a young hood (Keitel) who tries to save the neck of his hotheaded best friend (De Niro) from the wrath of a local loan shark, while at the same time, struggling to reconcile his Catholic guilt triggered by his reckless lifestyle. Though shot in Los Angeles, \"Mean Streets\" brilliantly conveyed the teeming violence and despair of Manhattan's Lower East Side, as well as turning De Niro and Keitel into overnight stars.\n\nMeanwhile, Scorsese put on full, dynamic display many of the conventions he only hinted at in his previous work, especially the kinetic pool hall fight scene set to the tune of The Marvelettes' \"Please Mr. Postman\" that became the first of many of Scorsese's landmark cinematic moments. After a showing at the New York Film Festival, \"Mean Streets\" was released to wide critical acclaim, earning a spot on The New York Times' list for \"Ten Best Films\" in 1973. He followed up with what ultimately became his only female-centric film, \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" (1974), a bittersweet tale about a Southwest housewife (Ellen Burstyn) who goes on the road to fulfill her dream of being a lounge singer after her husband's sudden death, only to flee her new, abusive boyfriend (Keitel) and take a job as a waitress at a diner ran by a loudmouth cook (Vic Tayback). His first bone fide studio movie, \"Alice\" wound up becoming a critical and box office success that netted Burstyn an Oscar for Best Actress and spawned a long-running CBS sitcom. Scorsese was on much more familiar ground with the testosterone-laden \"Taxi Driver\" (1976).\n\nAn iconographic street opera penned by Paul Schrader, the film marked Scorsese's second collaboration with De Niro, who delivered a tour-de-force performance as Travis Bickle, a lone nut New York City cab driver whose revulsion towards the scumbags on the streets leads him to try to save a teenage prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her pimp (Keitel), unleashing holy hell along the way. While the film garnered a share of controversy for its bloody finale - a sustained, hallucinatory, brilliantly-staged set piece - \"Taxi Driver\" went on to earn four Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, and eventually went down in cinema history as one of the more iconic films of Hollywood's second Golden Age.\n\nFirmly established as one of the top directors of his generation - which included friends Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas - Scorsese was hailed for being a great practitioner of experimental films, despite working within the studio system. Since he was also a renowned film historian, it was only natural for him to want to make an old-school Hollywood movie.\n\nWith his next film, \"New York, New York\" (1977), Scorsese tried to create a nostalgic look at the movie musical, but shifted gears during filming to shape the story around the deteriorating relationship between a jazz saxophonist (De Niro) and a big band singer (Liza Minnelli, in a performance loosely based on her own mother, Judy Garland). The result was an uneven film that audiences - especially those fond of musicals - found woefully depressing. Realizing he was no Busby Berkeley, Scorsese returned to documentary filmmaking with \"The Last Waltz\" (1978), a film hailed as one of the finest rock concert movies of all time. Filmed in 1976, the documentary showcased The Band's farewell performance at San Francisco's Winterland Arena, bringing audiences both behind the scenes and upfront for a close look at an exceptional concert highlighted by guest performances by Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell and many others.\n\nAt the time of filming \"The Last Waltz,\" Scorsese was living with Band drummer and lead singer Robbie Robertson. Though he never liked talking much about it after the fact, Scorsese was doing heavy amounts of drugs, which led to complete exhaustion and a stay in the hospital in the late 1970s. Meanwhile, other commitments and re-editing of \"The Last Waltz\" - which included removing via rotoscoping a large chunk of cocaine from Neil Young's nose during his performance of \"Helpless\" - kept the film from being released for two years.\n\nMeanwhile, friend De Niro was concerned enough with Scorsese's own cocaine use that he convinced the director to kick the habit. Thankfully for De Niro and moviegoers around the world, the director kicked drugs, got back on track, and went on to direct what many considered his masterpiece, \"Raging Bull\" (1980). A searing and unyielding look in black-and-white at former middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta, who after becoming the 1948 champ, loses everything due to his self-destructive, violent nature, \"Raging Bull\" was later regarded as one of the top movies ever made of any decade. Scorsese was passed over at the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, despite De Niro winning a much deserved Oscar for Best Actor. It would not be the last time Scorsese would go home empty-handed.\n\nFor his next film, Scorsese examined the effects of fame in the underrated \"The King of Comedy\" (1983), which cast De Niro as Rupert Pupkin, a wannabe stand-up comic living in his mother's basement who becomes so desperate for a break, he hatches a plan to kidnap a famous late night talk show host (Jerry Lewis) in order to get a spot on his show. \"The King of Comedy\" proved to be Scorsese's third financial flop in a row; something that would have shaken the mettle of most other directors, but not Scorsese. He next attempted to make his dream project, \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" but Paramount withdrew funding at the last minute due to a ballooning budget and outrage from Evangelicals.\n\nIn reaction, Scorsese made \"After Hours\" (1985), a cheaply made dark comedy set in Manhattan about a slightly nerdy yuppie (Griffin Dunne) who goes on a bizarre one-night adventure with a Soho woman (Rosanna Arquette) he meets at a café. He moved on to Chicago for \"The Color of Money\" (1986), a sequel to \"The Hustler\" (1961), with Paul Newman reprising his role of pool shark 'Fast' Eddie Felsen and Tom Cruise as his protégé.
