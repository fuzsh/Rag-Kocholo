        "text": "THE DEPARTED\n\nHong Kong crime-flick \"Infernal Affairs\" was so perfectly made that it demanded a prequel, but this star-heavy American vehicle is too brutal to be preceded and too funny to be set anywhere but BAH-ston!\n\n[NOTE: For crime genre fans only, leave the young girls ('Leo'-philes) at home]\n\n3 stars (4 stars for JACK-fans ONLY) [(2006)USA/WB/Rated R] - (approx. 2-1/2 hrs.)\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese\n\nScreenplay by William Monahan\n\nSource: screenplay for \"Wu jian dao (\"Infernal Affairs\") by Alan Mak & Felix Chong\n\nCast ... Lead characters\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio ... Billy Costigan\n\nMatt Damon ... Colin Sullivan\n\nJack Nicholson ... Frank Costello/Opening narration\n\nReview:\n\n\"Nobody gives it to you. You have to take it.\" - Frank Costello\n\nIf you haven't seen the original \"Infernal Affairs\" then the plotline for this film may be a bit of a challenge. I recommend seeing this film twice or at least go back and check out the original Hong Kong version (and then the prequel to that one) FIRST on DVD.\n\nAlthough director Scorsese insists this is not a true remake it's hard to stray far from the original with such a tight plotline. The major changes are a relocation of the story from Hong Kong to Boston, MA and the casting of Jack Nicholson (to the story's detriment) in what 'should' be supporting role.\n\nAs gangster 'Frank Costello', the living legend Nicholson (\"The Shining\") steals every scene he's in (no surprise there), but at the same time he makes his scenes so laugh-out-loud funny that they let all the air out of the main plot which is supposed to be a taut, tension-filled, mole vs. mole crime drama between the characters played by DiCaprio & Damon.\n\nAs a native Bostonian, actor Matt Damon (\"The Bourne Supremacy\") fares the best against Jack, plus his scenes with Nicholson predominantly occur on the phone. Sadly, Leonardo DiCaprio (\"The Aviator\") seems to have reverted back to his 'shout-the-lines' acting mode in the vain hope of overpowering Nicholson. Let's just say he fails miserably and Nicholson blows him away in their many scenes together. Leo's like an apprentice jedi facing the Darth Maul of the acting game, it ain't pretty.\n\nAnother native Bostonian, actor Mark Wahlberg (\"Invincible\") does on the cop side of the equation what Jack is doing on the criminal, he literally shreds every character that comes within range with a hilarously, dazzlingly fast-talking, verbal assault. Audiences will be laughing so much at Jack and Wahlberg that they'll soon forget this is supposed to be a fully loaded film noir.\n\nNicholson went on to win an Oscar for Best Actor and director Scorsese nailed his \"first\" Best Picture trophy with this film. But I still say, the Departed's departure from the original film may be entertaining, but it's nearly tension-free and only the kill-em-all structure provides any surprises at all (for those that have seen the original film & prequel).\n\nIt's this version of the story or the original, the difference is like choosing sides for a football game, only one of the teams is making up their own rules. Or maybe they both are? Now that's a paradox. Another paradox is whether you should see this film because it's a comedy posing as a drama, or a failed remake that has morphed into something of a novelty.\n\nLike \"Black Dahlia,\" the violence is full out with blood and gore, and the comedy is racist, politically incorrect, and not for the kiddies (at all). I can't really recommend this for genre-fans since it's wildly uneven, but if you love Jack then this is probably worth your time. Just remember, this is no longer a remake, no longer a Martin Scorcese movie, no longer a crime drama ... it's the Jack Nicholson show so take it for what it is and you'll at least get a few laugh out of it.\n\nLike most remakes, if you see the original first you're usually disappointed with the update, and if you see the remake first you find the original to be dated. Take a chance, find out what you may have missed with \"Infernal Affairs 1 & 2\" and for God's sake, learn to read the subtitles and stay away from any dubbed versions.\n\nMPAA Rating: R for strong brutal violence, pervasive language, some strong sexual content and drug material. (this is not a film for ANYONE under 16 yrs. of age, the violence is bloody and gory and the F-word gets used about a 100 times at least. Parents should be warned that the humor is very adult sexually and very very politically incorrect with insults aimed at the Italians, Irish, & blacks. And yes, the N-word is used. On the plus side there's very little nudity with only a brief glimpse of a porn movie).\n\nOriginal Music by Howard Shore\n\nEditor: Thelma Schoonmaker\n\nCinematographer: Michael Ballhaus\n\nProduction Designer: Kristi Zea\n\nArt Directors: Teresa Carriker-Thayer & Nicholas Lundy\n\nSet Decorator: Leslie E.
