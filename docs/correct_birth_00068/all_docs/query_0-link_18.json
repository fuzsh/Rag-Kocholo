Before Scorsese started school, he and his parents, Charles and Catherine Scorsese, both of Italian descent, moved to Little Italy, Manhattan. Scorsese was raised in a Catholic environment. As a child, Martin suffered from asthma and was unable to partake in playing sports with other children. To make up for this, Martin's parents and his older brother, Frank would frequently bring Scorsese to the movie theaters, which gave Scorsese his love of film. Scorsese attended the all-boys Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx and graduated in 1960. At first, Martin wished to be a priest and instead attended NYU's Washington Square College.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1965, Scorsese married Laraine Marie Brennan and had a daughter named Catherine, after his mother, but divorced in 1971. Five years later, he married writer, Julia Cameron and had a daughter, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, however the marriage lasted only one year. Around this time, Scorsese also struggled with a serious cocaine addiction after the financial failure of his film, New York, New York, which nearly led him to his death, to which he then quit. Scorsese then married actress, Isabella Rossellini in 1979 but divorced her four years later. Afterwards, he married Barbara De Fina in 1985 and divorced her in 1991, with Scorsese also having a sexual relationship with Illeana Douglas that ended in 1997. Since 1999, Scorsese has been married to Helen Schermerhorn Morris, who he has a daughter with named Francesca. According to Scorsese, he is both a lapsed Catholic and a Roman Catholic.\n\nFilmography\n\nFeatured Films\n\nYear Film Distributor 1967 Who's That Knocking at My Door Joseph Brenner Associates 1972 Boxcar Bertha American International Pictures 1973 Mean Streets Warner Bros. 1974 Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore Warner Bros. 1976 Taxi Driver Columbia Pictures 1977 New York, New York United Artists 1980 Raging Bull United Artists 1982 The King of Comedy 20th Century Fox 1985 After Hours Warner Bros. 1986 The Color of Money Buena Vista Distribution 1988 The Last Temptation of Christ Universal Pictures 1989 New York Stories (partially) Warner Bros. / Buena Vista Distribution 1990 Goodfellas Warner Bros. 1991 Cape Fear Universal Pictures 1993 The Age of Innocence Columbia Pictures 1995 Casino Universal Pictures 1997 Kundun Buena Vista Distribution 1999 Bringing Out the Dead Paramount Pictures / Buena Vista Distribution 2002 Gangs of New York Buena Vista Distribution / Miramax Films 2004 The Aviator Warner Bros.
