        "text": "Martin Charles Scorsese (born November 17, 1942) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film historian.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is no such thing as pointless violence. City of God, is that pointless violence? It's reality, it's real life, it has to do with the human condition. Being involved in Christianity and Catholicism when I was very young, you have that innocence, the teachings of Christ. Deep down you want to think that people are really good - but the reality outweighs that.\n\nScorsese: No Such Thing As Pointless Violence, WENN (10 October 2004).\n\nMovies touch our hearts, and awaken our vision, and change the way we see things. They take us to other places. They open doors and minds. Movies are the memories of our lifetime. We need to keep them alive.\n\n\"The Film Foundation Main page\".\n\nI don't think there is any difference between fantasy and reality in the way these should be approached in a film. Of course if you live that way you are clinically insane.\n\nScorcese on Scorsese, \"Mean Streets—Alice Doesn't Live here Anymore—Taxi Driver\".\n\nI always tell the younger film-makers and students: Do it like the painters used to...Study the old masters. Enrich your palette. Expand the canvas. There's always so much more to learn.\n\nScorsese: A Personal Journey through American Movies.\n\nI don't really see a conflict between the church and movies, the sacred and the profane. Obviously, there are major differences, but I can also see great similarities between a church and a movie house. Both are places for people to come together and share a common experience. I believe there is a spirituality in films, even if it's not one which can supplant faith.\n\nScorsese: A Personal Journey through American Movies.\n\nMean Streets dealt with the American Dream, according to which everybody thinks they can get rich quick, and if they can't do it by legal means then they'll do it by illegal ones.\n\nScorsese on Scorsese, \"Mean Streets—Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore—Taxi Driver\".\n\nQuotes about Martin Scorsese\n\n[edit]\n\nI like Martin Scorsese as a director very much.\n\n2007 interview in Conversations with Bharati Mukherjee Edited by Bradley C. Edwards (2009)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCategory:Martin Scorsese films\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nScorsese interviews on BBC\n\nMartin Scorsese on IMDb"
