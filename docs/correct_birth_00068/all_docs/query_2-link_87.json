        "text": "Martin Scorsese is gearing up for ambitious plans to direct two consecutive biopics. Following his recent success with Killers of the Flower Moon, which garnered 10 Oscar nominations, Scorsese is showing no signs of slowing down. Variety reports that sources close to the director have revealed that his next projects will explore two vastly different subjects: Jesus Christ and Frank Sinatra.\n\nScorsese intends to finance the first biopic, titled Life of Jesus, independently, similar to his approach with Silence in 2016. Inspired by Shūsaku Endō’s book, the film will delve into the profound narrative of Jesus’ life.\n\nRumors suggest that Scorsese is considering reuniting with actor Andrew Garfield for a role in the project. Production is expected to begin later this year, with filming locations spanning Israel, Italy, and Egypt, though logistical challenges may arise due to the situation in Palestine.\n\nScorsese will shift gears to focus on the legendary singer, Frank Sinatra. However, the project faces potential obstacles as Sinatra’s daughter, Tina Sinatra, controls her father’s estate and has yet to give her approval.\n\nDespite this, Scorsese is assembling an impressive cast for the project. Sources suggest that frequent collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio is being considered to portray the iconic singer, with Jennifer Lawrence in talks to depict Sinatra’s second wife, actress Ava Gardner."
