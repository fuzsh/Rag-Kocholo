        "text": "Mr. Scorsese, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of cinema?\n\nIt’s a very exciting time because it’s all new, everything is off the board. It’s no longer the cinema of the 20th century. I guess we’ll call it cinema, but films will be made for these small screens.\n\nIs that a good thing or bad thing?\n\nThat doesn’t mean that’s bad, but they shouldn’t see Lawrence of Arabia on those screens, that’s all. I think it’s a matter of putting things in perspective and place. But I feel we must always, always expose the younger generation to the films of the past, that’s the best possible circumstance. Otherwise culture, everything will be forgotten. We’ll only be dealing with animated films and, you know, giant communal experiences that are surface films – you look at them once and – bang! – it’s gone.\n\nThat would be horrible.\n\nWe would lose the beauty of seeing a film at the age of 10 and then seeing it at the age of 25 and it changes and then at the age of 40 and it changes even more and then at the age of 60 it all comes together and you realize, “Wow! This is amazing, this picture got better!” Where’s that going to be for the children of the future? Why wipe out the moving image as an art form that means something in this society? I come from a time when it did mean something.\n\nAre you getting more sentimental with age?\n\nI hope not sentimental. Sentimental is superficial, isn’t it?\n\nMore emotional?\n\nI’ve always been emotional. It’s genuine sentiment I hope. You know, it’s just a matter of growing older and seeing people around you being born and dying. And having a child at a late age is different from when my first two daughters were born when I was in my 20s and 30s; it’s a different perspective. It’s time to think of the end, like in my George Harrison picture. Being a Roman Catholic it’s always been time to think of the end for me.\n\nDo you allow your daughter to see your movies yet?\n\nNo, no. (Laughs)\n\nWhen do you think you will?\n\nMy wife and I talk about it a lot. Kundun I’d like to show first, but it’s not necessarily the style even… Or Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, even The Color of Money maybe. But she’d have to see The Hustler first, which is a better picture, and I don’t necessarily want that. But still, The Hustler you have to be sophisticated to a certain extent, older than 13 or 14. So I don’t know, it’ll be interesting to see.\n\nDid your father take you to the cinema?\n\nThere was a bond between my father and I with those early films that I saw in the late 1940s and early ’50s until I started going to the films by myself. The only place I could really find a sense of entertainment that was not sports, fighting, running, laughing, going to the country, or seeing animals was in the movie theater.\n\nWhat was it like growing up in the 1950s in New York?\n\nI was around the working classes, not people who read books. The conservative working class, they had gone through the Great Depression and World War II and then there was quite an economic boom. The cars were getting bigger and more importantly the fins on the car were getting bigger. On the Lower East Side the only guys who had big things were wise guys. I mean, in New York if you’re working class you don’t have a car. In the city you use the subway or you use the bus.\n\nThat was the beginning of the Cold War. Was there constant fear of an attack from the Soviet Union?\n\nYou felt it and you knew it. The nuns would tell us at school, any low-flying plane could be delivering that bomb. We’d all hear a low-flying plane and we’d all be terrified. I remember going to school every day, it was very cold usually, and they gave us dog tags in case of an air raid. You got to school and you were praying that there would be no air raid that day. I was very impressionable, what can I say? I had nothing else to do, that’s who I am. I’m standing there in 3rd grade and all of a sudden you’d hear her on the loudspeaker: “Attention please, take cover!” And you’d jump underneath the desk and then you found out it was just a test. It was pretty crazy.\n\nWhat’s the craziest thing you’ve done making a movie?\n\nPretty much everything. I find when I make a movie that I never realize what is really involved. When we were shooting Raging Bull me and my producer would say, “This is crazy! How did we get here?” But if we thought that at the beginning, we never would’ve started.\n\nDid any actors ever tell you that?\n\nFunny enough, it was never an actor. But Michael Ballhaus, my director of photography, turned to me during the impossible first shot of The Last Temptation of Christ and he said, “This is the way it’s going to be. It’s going to be a tough movie. Every shot is going to be working against us.”\n\nDo you think it has to be like that?\n\nOther people will say there’s a different style, a different way of behaving around films and behaving about directing, where everything is cool and quiet. Well, I’m not a cool and quiet person.\n\nReturn to Top"
