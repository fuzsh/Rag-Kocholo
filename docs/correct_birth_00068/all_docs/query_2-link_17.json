        "text": "Martin Scorsese, (born Nov. 17, 1942, Queens, N.Y., U.S.), U.S. film director. Scorsese earned a graduate degree (1966) in filmmaking at New York University. After directing several short films, he won critical attention for his feature film Mean Streets (1973) and was widely praised for Taxi Driver (1976); both starred his frequent lead actor, Robert De Niro. Noted for his realistic violent portrayals of New York street life, innovative camera work, classic film knowledge, and spirited cynicism, he rose to the top rank of American directors with such films as Raging Bull (1980); The King of Comedy (1983); GoodFellas (1990); The Age of Innocence (1993); Gangs of New York (2002), which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, who became another frequent collaborator; and The Aviator (2004). Scorsese won an Academy Award for best director for the Boston mob drama The Departed (2006), which was also named best picture. His later movies included Hugo (2011), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and The Irishman (2019). In addition, he directed a number of music documentaries."
