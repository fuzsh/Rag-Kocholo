        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Director , Executive Producer more\n\nBirth name Martin Charles Scorsese\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth November 17, 1942 (Queens, New York City, New York, USA)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nSuffering from asthma, Martin Scorsese frequented the cinemas of Little Italy since his adolescence. He wanted to become a painter and then a priest before starting his studies at New York University where he shot his first short films. In 1965, he began work on Who’s that knocking at my door? , his first feature film with Harvey Keitel in the lead role, which he did not complete until four years later. In the meantime, he was fired from the filming of The Honeymoon Killers after a week and did some editing work. The filmmaker was then approached by Roger Corman who offered to finance his second feature film, Bertha Boxcar (1972). Dissatisfied with the constraints imposed by the producer, he sought to return to a more personal subject and ended up finding the funds necessary for the filming of Mean Streets (1973). The film marks his first collaboration with his favorite actor Robert De Niro and establishes Scorsese as one of the most promising directors of his generation.\n\nThe filmmaker then agrees to prove himself on a more commercial work. Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974) demonstrates that he can adapt to all types of subjects. Ellen Burstyn won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. In 1976, the filmmaker caused a sensation at Cannes when he won the Palme d’Or for Taxi Driver , the story of a lone Vietnam veteran obsessed with the filth of New York’s streets. Scorsese then begins a difficult period in his life. The totally disorderly filming of New York, New York (1977) left the filmmaker depressed. Abusing drugs, he is on the verge of suicide before pulling himself together. De Niro suggested that he shoot a biography of the boxer Jack La Motta: Scorsese made Raging Bull (1980) his redemption.\n\nThe 1980s were commercially difficult for Scorsese. He turned to comedy with La Valse des pantins (1983) and After Hours (1985), winner of the Best Director Award at Cannes, which did not appeal to the general public. He therefore had to once again shoot an openly more commercial film, The Color of Money (1987), to finance a project that had been close to his heart for more than ten years, The Last Temptation of Christ , which shocked puritan America. Universal’s investment in this last project led Scorsese to shoot Nerves on the Edge (1991) for the studio,Jack Lee Thompson .\n\nIn 1990 and 1995, Scorsese offered two brilliant explorations of the world of the Mafia with Goodfellas and Casino . He demonstrates with style the impasses of the American dream. The films benefit from unforgettable performances by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro . Setting for a love drama in The Time of Innocence (1993) or the spiritual crisis of an ambulance driver in An Open Tomb (1999), the city of New York holds a special place in the filmmaker’s work as as evidenced by, in 2002, Gangs of New York , a fresco carried by Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis , which traces the confrontation between Americans and new immigrants in the middle of the civil war. A DiCaprio that he meets again several times, for Aviator (2005), biopic dedicated to the eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes and homage by the cinephile Scorsese to the golden age of Hollywood, and for the thriller The Departed , remake of the Hong Kong film Infernal affairs .\n\nMartin Scorsese begins this new decade as producer and director of the pilot of the series Boardwalk Empire led by a Steve Buscemi in very good form; true immersion in the mafia world of Atlantic City, a city of crime in the 1920s. Boardwalk Empire won numerous awards at the end of its first season, including “best drama series” at the 2011 Golden Globes. it is renewed for two additional seasons the same year. On the cinema side, the filmmaker once again found Leonardo DiCaprio in 2010, and sent him to investigate the heart of a psychiatric asylum in Shutter Island , adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane . New year and new adaptation in 2011 for the filmmaker who tackles the Parisian and mysterious adventures of Hugo Cabret in which he directs the young Asa Butterfield , as well as Jude Law .\n\nMartin Scorsese has always devoted an unprecedented cult to “rock’n’roll”, “classic rock” as well as “blues”. These musical genres are truly an integral part of the works in his filmography. From Eric Clapton to the Rolling Stones , these chosen pieces helped to give undeniable sonic power to his films. Thus, as a true enthusiast, he lent himself to the direction and production of numerous documentaries and/or concerts concerning his idols.for Michael Jackson in 1987, the documentaries Eric Clapton: Nothing But the Blues in 1995 and No Direction Home: Bob Dylan in 2005, the Rolling Stones: Shine a Light concert in 2008 or more recently the documentary dedicated to the former Beatles , George Harrison: Living in the Material World in 2011.\n\nIn 2013, The Wolf of Wall Street was released , an adaptation of the eponymous novel by former stockbroker Jordan Belfort , written after his release from prison. The Little Italy filmmaker is directing Leonardo DiCaprio for the fifth time for the occasion. Four years later, the New York native finally realized his dream, adapting the Japanese novel Shusaku Endo , Silence, for the screen . Nearly 30 years after discovering this story, the legendary filmmaker finally achieves his goal, taking us to the 17th century to tell us the journey of two Jesuit priests on a mission in a hostile Japan persecuting Christians. In 2019, he signed The Irishman for Netflix , which focuses on the disappearance of legendary union leader Jimmy Hoffa. For the occasion he solicits Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.\n\nIn 2023, at the age of 80, Martin Scorsese once again reunites with Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon , a historical fresco that highlights a dark part of American history: the series of murders of the native tribe Osage, Oklahoma in the 1920s."
