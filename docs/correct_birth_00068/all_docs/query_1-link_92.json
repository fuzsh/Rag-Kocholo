        "text": "Martin Scorsese was born November 17, 1942, in Queens, New York. An asthmatic as a child, Scorsese was unable to play with his friends and spent a lot of time watching movies as a child. He quickly cultivated a great appetite for cinema as well as music, and went on to study film at NYU. After catching the eye of producer Roger Corman, Scorsese directed his first feature Boxcar Bertha, starring Barbara Hershey and David Carradine.\n\nIn the 1970s, Scorsese flourished as one of the leaders of a new artistic movement in American cinema. Inspired by the French nouvelle vague, he and filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola and Paul Schrader created a new kind of filmmaking unlike anything studios (much less audiences) had seen. Simultaneously, Scorsese succumbed to the pressures of being an acclaimed director, and drug use deeply affected the films he made during this time, including Taxi Driverand Raging Bull. After a string of critical hits but box office flops, Scorsese took on a number of projects in the early â€˜80s that were smaller in scale than previous works."
