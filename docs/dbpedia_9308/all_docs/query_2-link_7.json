        "text": "Irene \"Lefty\" Applegren\n\nIrene “Lefty” Applegren was a Peoria, IL native who was drafted by the Rockford Peaches in 1944 before she had even finished high school. She was known for her hard underhand pitching style, but was one of few players in the league who saw the evolution through all three pitching styles, including underhand, sidearm, and overhand. Irene played on the Peaches’ 1945, 1949, and 1950 championship teams, and has a career highlight of pitching a no-hitter against the Grand Rapids Chicks on July 31, 1946.\n\nDottie \"Kammie\" Kamenshek\n\nDottie “Kammie” Kamenshek was one of the best players in the league. New York Yankee Wally Pipp called her “the fanciest-fielding first baseman I’ve ever seen, man or woman.” She would leap three or four feet and do the splits to cover first base! As a batter, she was a two-time league champion striking out only 81 times in 3,736 times at bat. In her nine year career from 1943 to 1952, she put out a record 10,440 players at first base, and was responsible for more double plays than any other league player. Dottie suffered a back injury in 1952 and became a physical therapist for the next 30 years. Dottie passed away at 84 in 2010.\n\nDorothy \"Snookie\" Harrell\n\nDorothy “Snookie” Harrell made the All-Star team five times in her career as one of the best short stops in the AAGPBL. The fans loved Snookie as she was a strong slap hitter who led the league in RBIs and had only 95 strikeouts in 2,920 times at bat. She made the playoffs six times, and four times on the championship team. Harrell competed in the league from 1944 to 1952, after which she continued a career in softball, and even managed the Orange Lionettes championship team.\n\nRose \"Rosie\" Gacioch\n\nRose \"Rosie\" Gacioch played in the AAGPBL from 1944 to 1954 taking on many positions including pitching, outfield, and first, second, and third base. She was a great pitcher who practiced by throwing through a hole in a mattress as a kid. Rose was a power hitter leading the league in triples and RBIs in 1945. She made the All-Star team from 1951-1954. Upon retirement, she continued living in Rockford, working as a press operator at a hardware manufacturer for the next 20 years.\n\nJean \"Cy\" Cione\n\nJean “Cy” Cione was one of a few players homegrown here in Rockford, IL. She entered the league in 1945 at the age of 17 when she attended tryouts in Rockford. She made the cut and had a long ten-year career as a star pitcher which included three no-hitters, two of which were in the same month. Jean was an All-Star player with an ERA of 2.33 in 169 career games, and one of the few players to successfully transition through all three pitching styles as the league evolved from underhand to overhand.\n\nDorothy “Dottie” Ferguson\n\nDorothy “Dottie” Ferguson was a Peaches fan favorite. Known for her speed, she stole 461 bases in her nine-year career from 1945 to 1954. Prior to joining the Peaches, Dottie was a professional speed skating champion, which lent itself to to her strong base running. Dottie got married in 1949, but continued with the Peaches until the league ended in 1954. She remained in Rockford until she passed away in 2003."
