        "text": "Rockford constructed 77 miles of 36-inch and 49 miles of 30-inch for a total of 126 miles of pipeline from Lake Wales, FL to Okeechobee, FL. The project included 12 directional drills totaling 25,637 feet, 63 road bores totaling 8,089 feet, 30 open-cut roads, an interconnect, and a large meter station at the south end of the project. There were 5 successful mainline test sections to complete the project.\n\nRockford completed a total of 134 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of the M2E3 project. Segment 4 was laid in mostly dense rock formations that required blasting and rock trenching while Segment 7 was very congested, running through pipeline corridors south of Houston. Included in Rockford's scope were 26 horizontal directional drills, 188 bores, and 15 mainline valves. Welding was performed using a combination of CRC's automatic welding system and manual stick rod.\n\nThe Rancho Pipeline Expansion Project for Enterprise Products included the construction of 86 miles of 36-inch pipeline near Houston, TX. A total of 18 horizontal directional drills, 14,600 feet of bores, and the placement 62,000 timber mats were needed to complete the project.\n\nRockford constructed Spreads 6 and 7 of the Ruby Pipeline Project for El Paso Natural Gas which ran from Vya, NV to Malin, OR. Totaling 127 miles of 42-inch pipeline, this challenging project included winter work, multiple winch line hills, large waterbody crossings, and the utilization of over one million pounds of dynamite for the excavation of both grade and ditch rock.\n\nRockford constructed Spread 6 of the Sabal Trail Pipeline Project as well as the Hunter Creek Lateral for Spectra which consisted of 76.6 miles of 36-inch pipeline that ran from Near Wildwood, FL south to Kissimmee, FL. Included in this project were 6 horizontal directional drills, 30 road bores, 6 mainline valves, and the utilization of 135,000 timber mats."
