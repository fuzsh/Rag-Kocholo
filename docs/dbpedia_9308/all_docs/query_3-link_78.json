        "text": "About theRockford Peaches\n\nThe League began as a non-profit organization owned by Philip Wrigley. He organized the league into 4 teams in smaller industrial cities within a reasonable traveling distance from Chicago. The Rockford Peaches were one of the original four teams in the League.\n\nWrigley modified the rules for the women who, for the most part, came from fast pitch softball leagues. Based upon their playing skills and femininity, players were paid a pre-determined salary and assigned to a team. The players were assigned teams as best they could according to position and skills to provide a level playing field for each team. Rockford had a strong bond with its fans and played in all twelve seasons of the League's existence. Terrie Davis gained honors for the Peaches by posting the best batting average in the League for the inaugural season."
