        "text": "The Kishwaukee River Basin covers an area of approximately 1,218 square miles, spanning seven counties in northern Illinois, including parts of Boone, McHenry, Kane, DeKalb, Ogle, and small parts of Lee and Winnebago counties. The mainstem of the river empties into the Rock River about 3 miles south of Rockford, Illinois. It is formed by two branches which unite just south and west of Cherry Valley, IL. The North Branch arises in east-central McHenry County and flows to the west to near Rockford, where it turns south before uniting with the South Branch. The South Branch has its origin on a moraine just north of Shabbona. It flows northeasterly to the village of Genoa, where it turns to the northwest before uniting with the North Branch The two branches thus united, then flow only a short distance before emptying into the Rock River.\n\nMore than 60 species of fish have been found in the Kishwaukee River Basin, including several species of sport fish. The most sought after of the sport fish are the smallmouth bass and channel catfish, with both found abundantly and of good size. Panfish such as bluegill and rock bass can be found in some areas of the river, along with largemouth bass. Northern pike can also be found in several areas, but in low numbers.\n\nNote: The Kishwaukee is NOT public, so it can only be accessed in areas where the landowner allows public access. In addition, there are many areas on the Kishwaukee that are owned by park districts and/or conservation districts. These entities DO allow boating, canoeing, and fishing on their portion of property. However, you need to be careful of where their boundary ends to avoid trespassing on private property where the owner does not allow the public.\n\nNote: There is a closed season on smallmouth bass. All smallmouth bass caught between April 1 and June 15 must be immediately released alive and in good condition back into the waters from which they came."
