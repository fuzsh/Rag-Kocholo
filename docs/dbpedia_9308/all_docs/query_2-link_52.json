Show up with your instrument on Monday and by Friday night you’ll be playing on-stage in a well-oiled, powerhouse of a rock n’ roll band.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Institute is a 501c3 non-profit organization.

Musicians up to age 20 may register, but musicians who are age 19-20 must have attended one session of camp when they were 18 or younger.\n\nA typical camp day begins with a Master Class taught by some of the finest musicians and music educators from the Northern Illinois area. The rest of the camp day is dedicated to band practice with a dedicated instructor (per band). On average, we have a 4:1 camper-to-instructor ratio, which guarantees plenty of personalized assistance for our campers.\n\nTogether, we work hard throughout the weeks, and come end of camp, we climb on the stage to perform for our friends and family! Not only that, our camp provides optional performance opportunities for our campers throughout the community, throughout the year.\n\nRegister today!\n\nKeith Country Day School\n\n9am ~ 3pm\n\nWeek 1: June 17 – 21\n\nConcert: Friday evening, June 21\n\nWeek 2: June 24 – 28\n\nConcert: Friday evening, June 28\n\nWeek 3: July 15 – 19\n\nConcert: Saturday afternoon, July 20\n\n 5/5\n\nI met so many friends that have similar interests as me. On the first day, we sat down together and talked about songs. It made me realize we had so many things in common...We made friends after a week. It definitely boosted my confidence because we know we like the songs and there will be other people in the audience who like them as much as we do.\n\nGeorgia Speer\n\n2023 Camper\n\n 5/5\n\nThis camp gave me more than my schooling ever did- confidence, collaboration, and lifelong friendships.\n\nJessica Dobson\n\nExecutive Director\n\n 5/5\n\n\"My daughter loved the camp. She entered not knowing how to sing a note due to stage fright, and within 5 days she was fronting a band and singing her heart out. An amazing experience for the kids. \"\n\nTammie Reynolds\n\nReggie's Mom\n\nR&RI\n\nTeachers\n\nSince the beginning of RnRI, our staff has included some of the finest musicians from the Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin area. Our instructors have many years experience being active in the local arts community as performers, songwriters, private music teachers, band coaches, music producers, and teachers – both in the regional school districts and at the college level. Along with their extensive musical experience, many hold one, or more college level degrees in music, education, or both. The RnRI staff love working with the next generation of musicians, and are proud to be a part of this camp, and our thriving music community!\n\nJessica Dobson\n\nExecutive Director\n\nJessica Dobson has been a musician since she got her first guitar after watching the 2001 smash hit “Josie and the Pussycats”. She attended every week of camp from ages 12-20 and is proud to still be involved!\n\nJessica’s favorite musical moments consist of good friends playing around kitchen tables, laughing and singing old country songs.\n\nHow does she feel about this program? “R&RI is hands-down the most important thing I will ever do in this lifetime.”\n\nThank you, and ROCK ON!\n\nKevin Schwitters\n\nCamp Director\n\nKevin has been playing guitar and singing in bands for over two decades.

He has played in The Pimps, The Sons of Many B*tches, and now spends most of his days traveling or hanging out with his cats.\n\nHis philosophy on being a musician: “Music gives back exactly what you put into it. I love what I do so I’ve never worked a day in my life. All the good songs are 3 chords and the truth, and man are those hard to find.”\n\nHe’s usually in sweatpants with a guitar in his hand, working on some musical conundrum.\n\nMichael Hillenburg\n\nGuitar\n\nMichael “Hilly” Hillenburg has been playing since he was 17 years old.
