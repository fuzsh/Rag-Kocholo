        "text": "The Swedish Historical Society of Rockford was established in 1938 by a group from Rockford after visiting the 300th anniversary of the arrival of Swedes in North America. This celebration was held in Delaware, where once there was a Swedish colony. The Society was officially formed on January 31, 1939 and incorporated in Illinois as a not-for-profit corporation on November 29, 1950.\n\nâ€‹The Swedish Historical Society is organized exclusively for historical, educational, and charitable purposes. In harmony with this purpose is the operation of the Erlander Home Museum and Nordic Cultural Center. SHS strives for the preservation of Swedish-American history and Nordic culture of Rockford through such activities as the conservation of artifacts, museum displays and educational programs.\n\nBeginning in 1852, and peaking around the 1880's, Swedes came to Rockford by the thousands to seek their fortunes. They were part of the mass migration that eventually brought 60 million people to these shores. They reflected in their journeys the hopes and fears of other immigrant groups. They came to escape poverty, to enjoy freedom of expression, to participate in the political process, to worship (or not) and sometimes simply find adventure*.\n\n*excerpt from SwedeTown by John Lundin"
