We’re even more proud of the educational achievements and family atmosphere we offer to our students every day.\n\nWe prepare our students for success in college and life beyond their formal education. We inspire them to explore and celebrate their unique abilities through an abundance of enrichment programs and opportunities – from individual and team sports to strong music and theater/arts programs to more than 35 leadership, academic and special interest organizations. In addition to a strong liberal arts curriculum, Keith emphasizes real-world experiences through signature programs, such as senior projects, leadership opportunities, and global awareness. Core values of trust, respect, and kindness permeate all school experiences."
