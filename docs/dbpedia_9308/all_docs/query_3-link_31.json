        "text": "Thank you, Rockford! I‚Äôm extremely excited to announce I‚Äôll be headed to Cleveland, Ohio anchoring and reporting for the morning show at WKYC Studios! I‚Äôm incredibly fortunate to be going from one amazing team to another. I‚Äôm not leaving just yet- My last day is May 31st, so you‚Äôre stuck with me until the end of the month! If you told me four years ago when I started as the weekend sports anchor/reporter at WTVO-TV/WQRF-TV I‚Äôd be in the position I‚Äôm at now, I would‚Äôve never believed it. From sports, to weekend mornings, to the morning show, and now filling in on evenings, I owe a lot of credit to the entire team at Eyewitness News. There‚Äôs too many people to thank by name, but I couldn‚Äôt go without sharing my endless appreciation and gratitude for Whitney Martin and Joseph Marino. Not only are they the best co-anchors I could‚Äôve asked for, they‚Äôve also become two of my closest friends. I‚Äôll always cherish the highs and lows we‚Äôve shared together. To everyone else, thank you for making Rockford my home! All the people I‚Äôve had the pleasure of sharing stories with, I appreciate you for making my job easy and fun. Thank you for waking up early with us. I hope we were able to share a laugh (or two, or three) as you started your day.\n\nCongratulations to all of our local 2024 Golden Apple-winning teachers!! Seeing their shock and awe of the surprise, then the rush of emotions that followed, was truly unforgettable to witness. Thank you to the Golden Apple Foundation for everything they do to highlight the importance of education and for uplifting teachers in our community. I'm extremely lucky to have been able to share a small part of this special tradition with a few of them üçé WTVO-TV/WQRF-TV\n\nA little positivity to start your day ü´∂ 10-year-old Audrianna is an absolute inspiration to us ALL! She is raising money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital by selling beaded bracelets and helping to organize a 5K walk/run right here in our community. \"I think it's important to give back so that all children my age, younger, and a little bit older can live their dreams and live the happy they should.\" If you'd like to donate to help her reach her goal of $20,000 you can find the link in this story: https://trib.al/4cCEpBr Check out our amazing 'Kidcasters' every week only on WTVO-TV/WQRF-TV"
