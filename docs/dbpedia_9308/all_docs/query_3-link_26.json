        "text": "History\n\nThe construction of the Music Shell was first promoted by the Rockford Civic Symphony Orchestra, which sponsored a two-day music festival in August 1948 to launch the project. The Lions Club coordinated many donations made to the project by local organizations, and underwrote additional construction costs of $4,000–$6,000.\n\nThe Music Shell was designed by A. Reyner Eastman, who contributed the plans and his time to supervise the construction. Eastman is also responsible for a number of other area landmarks, including the Mendelssohn Club, the YMCA Log Lodge, Henrietta and Westview schools, Spring Creek Congregational Church, and Rockford Clinic. He also was the designer of a bridge spanning the Rock River at Black Hawk Park, the first modern-type bridge in the state of Illinois.\n\nThe Music Shell was officially presented to the City of Rockford and the Rockford Park District on June 4, 1950 by Dawn A. Smith, president of the Rockford Noon Lions Club, \"for the enjoyment and satisfaction of music lovers in Rockford and vicinity.\""
