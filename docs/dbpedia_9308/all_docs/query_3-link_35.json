It‘s the pick of your picnic!\n\nJoin Our Team\n\nNow Hiring\n\nNow Hiring Great People to Join Our Team!\n\nOur Mission\n\nAfter traveling our great country in search of the nation’s best BBQ, we felt inspired to bring this great food home. Especially for those who protect us all, the hard-workers who get it done every day, the home teams we cheer for, and of course, family and friends. Our mission is to serve you the most authentic, mouth-watering all-American food that’s done right.\n\nGiving Back\n\nOur young men and women in uniform. Veterans who served with honor. Our local Police, Firefighters and First Responders who make Our Community a better place to live. They’re the people we respect most of all, so MISSION BBQ tries to give back in return. From fundraisers to service projects, we have your back, donating over $25,000,000 supporting vital charities since opening our doors in 2011.\n\nA Servant's Heart\n\nA Servant's Heart\n\nA Servant's Heart\n\nSuzanne is an inspiration to Our Teammates. She prioritizes showing how much she cares about people, even if it means flying out of the state to spread positivity and appreciation. “They, on their own time, went to visit one of the Tuskegee Airmen to thank him and to acknowledge him for what he had done for our country,” said SHL Jackie about a trip Suzanne organized to spread some love to an American Hero.\n\nStories of Service\n\n“Service means you have to do for others even before your own and protecting other people and caring about other people. That’s important,” said Sylvia Mudd. She started her career in law enforcement 50-years ago when there weren’t any women serving in her community. The relationships she built in her community and with her fellow officers has led her to continue to serve today. “We still are there to back up the officers that are on duty every day and to help them in any way that we can. So you never retire. You just change your way of serving.”"
