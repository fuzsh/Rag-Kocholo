        "text": "I’m a big fan of classic 1970s/’80s television shows; particularly the Detective and Private Eye genres. I grew up with Magnum P.I., Columbo, Quincy M.E., and Cannon. Most of these I first saw in their earliest syndication, except for Magnum, which was a huge and brand new series when I was a kid.\n\nOut of all these shows, my favorites are definitely Columbo and The Rockford Files — and I think this comes down to two main reasons: the quality of the acting and writing, and the believability of the flawed main characters.\n\nCharacter is the hallmark of good fiction. A bad plot can be forgiven; a poorly written character cannot. And in The Rockford Files, we get a truly great protagonist — Jim Rockford (portrayed by the amazing James Garner).\n\nRockford is not your typical “cool” private eye. He’s a man of modest means who lives in a run-down mobile home on a beach in Malibu, California, with his father. He’s an ex-convict who’s weary of the police (though he does work with them from time to time), and we come to find that Rockford was wrongfully convicted; pardoned after serving five years in San Quentin. This gives him unique insight into the criminal world. He’s also a Korean War Veteran, lending another unique and admirable quality to the character.\n\nRockford knows how to handle himself, but he avoids fights if he can. In one episode, the young lady who hired him sort of challenges his masculinity by saying, “What? Are you afraid of him?” when talking about the bad guy who’s after Jim — and Rockford just says, “Hell yeah, I am!”\n\nThese little moments of comedy are what helped elevate Rockford above the rest. Jim is an average Joe, and he’s totally relatable. True to life. You can tell that James Garner really loved the character; it shows throughout the entire run of the initial series on NBC (1974–1980) and in the later TV movies on CBS (1994–1999). James Garner performed most of his own stunts throughout the series, suffering several injuries and causing him knee problems and a host of other issues. Today’s “precious” actors rely mainly on CGI and body doubles, but Garner was out there doing dirty work!\n\nThere are a lot of cool factoids about The Rockford Files, but I’ll list just a few of my favorites… ones that I feel are relevant in explaining why the show was so awesome.\n\nSuper dope theme song, which won a Grammy for “Best Instrumental Arrangement” in 1975 and spent two weeks at Number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFamous writers/producers, including David Chase who wrote 16 episodes. Yes, THAT David Chase, who went on to create “The Sopranos” on HBO.\n\nNumerous top-tier guest stars, including Tom Selleck who was a huge fan of James Garner and learned a lot during his Rockford days, which he later drew from as Magnum P.I.\n\nRockford rarely uses a gun. He has one (a Colt revolver) but he doesn’t have a permit for it :) He stores it in a container of coffee to “keep it from rusting.”\n\nThe supporting cast are all excellent, particularly Noah Beery Jr. who plays “Rocky,” Jim’s semi-retired truck-driver father. The realistic father-son relationship is one of the best in television history (IMHO).\n\nI really wish they’d make some new television programs that were as good as the classics, like Rockford. Shows nowadays tend to take themselves way too seriously — all the fun is gone. Or, conversely, they try too hard to be “whacky and outrageous,” and end up seeming hokey. Shows like Rockford struck that perfect balance, where they can make you laugh one minute and make you cry the next.\n\nRumor has it that there might be a reboot of The Rockford Files in the near future, helmed by and starring Vince Vaughn. I could see that. Vaughn is talented and might be able to pull it off.\n\nIn the meantime, catch up on the original. And remember, if you want to be a P.I., don’t do it for less than $200 a day + expenses!"
