        "text": "Located in Rockford, Illinois, the Kenneth and Phyllis Laurent House is one of only 11 hemicycle Usonians in Wright’s extensive portfolio of work. It is also the only home designed by famed-architect Frank Lloyd Wright to be wheelchair accessible. In the fall of 1948, the Laurents, impressed with Wright’s Usonian style architecture, commissioned him to design a home that would allow Ken, a paraplegic, to move about freely in his wheelchair.\n\nForty years before the Americans with Disabilities Act, Wright created a blueprint for an open-plan, single-story home that could accommodate Ken’s unique needs. In reflecting on the functionality of his home, Kenneth Laurent shared, “This house helps me focus on my capabilities, not my disability. That is the true gift Mr. Wright gave to me.” The Laurents lived in the home from its completion in spring of 1952 until early 2012 when it was purchased by the Laurent House Foundation. It opened as a public museum in June 2014.\n\nThis one owner Usonian home, in pristine condition and complete with original Wright-designed furnishings and lighting, is a rare mid-century find. Considered by Wright to be one of his 38 most important works, this “Little Gem” is recognized as one of the best examples of Wright’s architecture and interior design.\n\nThe Laurent House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Illinois Wright Trail. In 2018, to commemorate the Bicentennial of Illinois statehood, the Laurent House was selected by the American Institute of Architects/Illinois as one of the Top 20 Architectural Great Places in the state. The Laurent House Foundation is a past recipient of the Landmarks Illinois Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Preservation Award for its 2013 restoration of the Laurent House necessitated by the collapse of its roof.\n\nThe genius of Frank Lloyd Wright was that he understood what clients wanted before they did. He was able to integrate the wheelchair-friendly mechanics of the home with an aesthetic sense of calm and beauty, empowering Kenneth Laurent to, in his own words, “… allow me to forget about my disabilities and focus on my capabilities.” Click on the image above to experience the House from Ken Laurent’s perspective, courtesy of photographer Andrew Pielage."
