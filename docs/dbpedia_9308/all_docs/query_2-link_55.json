Bob’s company has grown to three stores since 2007 and continues to succeed due to Bob’s strong core values. Pardon the pun, but he believed in “Moving” People Forward. He held his employees in high regard and treated them as family. In a business that is known for extremely high turnover, he has had several employees who have stood by his side since the beginning. Bob treated people as individuals and worked hard to help them improve their lives both professionally and personally. He was well-known at corporate for training and promoting two individuals who “moved” on and opened their own TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® locations in other parts of the country. That commitment to helping people was passed on to his customers. When you have a role model who sets a good example it means a lot. He has also maintained a core group of employees that he always encourages to succeed. Bob had always been driven to succeed and helped others do the same. His passion for people showed in every aspect of his life. Bob always had a business mindset.\n\nBefore TWO MEN AND A TRUCK®, Bob owned a Fastener Distribution company with his wife, Marg. After years of success and building customer relationships, Bob decided to switch gears. His son, Kevin, and Daughter-in-law, Jen Christensen, brought to Bob’s attention that a moving company might be the right fit. After moving over ten times and having the worst experience with random moving companies. Jen and Kevin chose TWO MEN AND A TRUCK to move them from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Peoria, IL. They had the best experience and thought this would be a great opportunity!\n\nAfter researching TWO MEN AND A TRUCK®, Bob discovered that the company's values aligned with him and his wife’s values. The most important values to them were to provide the best customer service and help their employees succeed. Determined to be a part of TWO MEN AND A TRUCK®, Bob put in the work to find someone willing to sell their moving license in IL and applied to be a Franchisee. The original plan was to open a Franchise in Peoria first, but quickly Bob and his son Cory decided to start their journey in Rockford, IL. Bob stayed busy with his Fastener business and the opening of the location in Rockford. With Unemployment at an all-time high, it was a crazy time. However, Bob had a positive outlook. Bob said, “When you’re dealt lemons, you make lemonade.” With unemployment around 19% they were able to selectively hire the right employees for the company. This allowed their moving business to have great employees and created a successful beginning.\n\nIn 2008 Rockford won The Best Startup Franchise award. With such great success, opening a franchise in Peoria was their next goal. Bob applied for Peoria Franchise and received approval. After the opening of Peoria in 2011, they were awarded again with The Best Startup Franchise award! Bob and his two sons Cory and Kevin created two thriving moving locations and wanted to open a third. So, four years later they opened the franchise location in Davenport, IA. They were excited to have a location in the Quad Cities area.\n\nAs a dedicated family man, he cared about all his employees and ensured that the TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® core values were displayed in every customer interaction. Bob and his team believe customer service is one of the most important aspects in running a successful business. Our customers have peace of mind when choosing our team. We take pride in giving our customers the best service possible. Another highly important belief Bob and his family have is taking care of their employees. Bob thought that you should treat your employees with respect and make sure they are happy. He wanted his employees to enjoy coming to work. He wanted them to feel very comfortable at TWO MEN AND A TRUCK®. Bob also wanted to give all his employees a sense of belonging and control over their lives. He helped his employees to make their lives better and wanted them to have a purpose at Two Men and a Truck. “I get the pleasure of seeing my employees grow and succeed, and I want them to know I care about them.” He wanted his employees to succeed, grow, and move up in the company. He had great success with helping other Move Forward in their lived.\n\nOn January 6th, 2024 Bob passed away. We are so lucky to have had Bob as our owner, friend, family member, and boss. He left a huge impact on many peoples lives. His TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® locations will continue to help others. In honor of Robert F. (Bob) Christensen his two sons Cory and Kevin will continue Bob's legacy; by following his core values of taking care of their customers and their employees."
