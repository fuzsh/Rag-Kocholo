        "text": "Page Content\n\nPage Content\n\nChiseled out of the state's far northern region is Rock Cut State Park in Winnebago County. Nearby are other \"rocky\" landmarks - the mighty Rock River and the place where wagons once forded it, Rockford. It's an area of rolling plains, interesting history and a wide variety of recreational opportunities.\n\nRock Cut's 3,254 acres include two lakes: Pierce Lake, with 162 acres, and Olson Lake with 50 acres offer a retreat for people wanting to fish, ice fish or ice skate. The park'​s hiking trails, horseback riding trails and cross-country skiing and wildlife watching, as well as seasonal hunting programs, make it a year round recreation destination. The beautiful campground has 270 premium campsites, a rustic cabin, a youth group camp and shelters, with reservations available through ExploreMoreIL™.\n\nRock Cut is home to abundant wildlife with waterfowl, deer, fox, muskrat, woodchuck and beaver, opossum, raccoon and both gray and fox squirrel. Over 100 types of wildflowers offer a showy display each spring and summer, while hardwood trees dazzle visitors each fall.\n\nRock Cut is an alcohol free park and campground.​​​​​​"
