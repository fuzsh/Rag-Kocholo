        "text": "In support of all citizens from every background, and in unity with community partners, the Rockford Park District recognizes and supports \"National Native American Heritage Month.” Every November we take time to celebrate and honor the unique ancestry, traditions, and contributions made throughout history, and to provide a platform for Native people in the United States to share their culture, traditions, music, crafts, dance, along with ways and concepts of life.\n\nWithin the Rockford area there were a number of woodland nations that called the Rock River Valley home. Before the 1700s, Northern Illinois was primarily populated by the Illinois Confederation and Miami Nation. As Europeans pushed further inland, many nations were forced to relocate. Northern Illinois was home to a variety of nations, including, but not limited to, the Winnebago (Ho-Chunk), Sauk & Fox, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and Dakota Sioux. While each nation had its own subset of languages, religion, and customs, the nations of this region flourished due to the climate, natural resources, and land in which they were located.\n\nOne of the best ways to honor a culture is to experience it. Discover the commonalities that one shares with another culture, and then to value, appreciate, and embrace the differences of that culture from your own. Within the park district there are a few locations that you can experience that have been identified as Native American heritage sites such as:\n\nBeattie Park:\n\nThe Beattie Park Mound Group is located in downtown Rockford, north of Park Avenue, south of Mound Avenue/Indian Terrace, east of North Main Street and west of the Rock River. The group consists of three conical mounds (one being located outside the park boundaries at 509 Indian Terrace). Also present, you will find an effigy mound in the shape of a turtle and a linear mound. This mound group is the most visible evidence of cultures that lived long before what we now know as the state of Illinois."
