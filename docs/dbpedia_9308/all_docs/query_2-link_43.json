        "text": "Galapagos is all about the number 1. Galapagos Rockford was the 1st charter school in Rockford. Galapagos is the number 1 performing charter school in Rockford from 2010 to today. Between 2012-2014 Galapagos Rockford scholars ranked #1 in the growth rate on the Illinois State assessment (the highest of any public school in the Rock River Valley.) Galapagos was the 1st school in Rockford to ban junk food and serve nutritious meals to all of its scholars. Galapagos is the one public school in Rockford that sends its 8th grade scholars to Washington D.C. Galapagos’ Project Passport was the first and only program to send scholars to Costa Rica, to Spain, to Rwanda and to Uganda. Galapagos is the first charter school in Rockford to proudly have a Golden Apple award winning teacher. Galapagos is the first school to offer horseback riding as an elective…we could go on and on.\n\nSince 2009, Galapagos Rockford has sent 100s of GRCS scholars to programs outside of Rockford. It all started with summer enrichment programs at Northwestern University’s gifted and talented camp. Our amazing “Not Your Dad’s Summer Programming” now includes over a dozen programs locally, across the country and even across the globe! Programs include Sea Camp in San Diego, Great Books at Haverford College, Project Passport to Costa Rica and many more. To see our growing portfolio of programs click here.\n\nYou will not find any other school in Rockford or in Illinois that provides such a diverse catalogue of enrichment programming."
