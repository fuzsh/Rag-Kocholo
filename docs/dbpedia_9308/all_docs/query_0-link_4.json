        "text": "Rockford, city, seat (1836) of Winnebago county, northern Illinois, U.S. It lies on the Rock River, about 90 miles (145 km) northwest of Chicago. Rockford was founded by New Englanders in 1834 as separate settlements (commonly known as Kentville and Haightville, for the founders of each) on each side of the river and originally called Midway (halfway between Chicago and Galena); it was renamed in 1837 for the ford across the river. Waterpower supplied by a dam constructed in the mid-19th century led to the development of Rockford as a manufacturing centre in the middle of an agricultural area. The farm-machinery business began there in the early 1850s when John H. Manny developed a combined reaper and mower. The furniture industry began with an influx of Swedish carpenters, who arrived following the extension of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad to the Rock River (1852). Camp Grant, a reception and medical centre during World Wars I and II, was converted into the Greater Rockford Airport.\n\nRockford’s economy is based on manufacturing, including machine tools, aerospace components, screws and other fasteners, hardware, environmental control systems, chewing gum and mints, and automotive parts; it is also a distribution centre. Rockford College was founded in 1847 as Rockford Female Seminary, and the Saint Anthony College of Nursing was founded in 1915. Rock Valley (community) College opened in 1964, and the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford began classes in 1972. Rockford museums include the Burpee Museum of Natural History, the Erlander Home (1871; a Swedish American museum), the Rockford Art Museum (the state’s largest art museum outside Chicago), the Tinker Swiss Cottage Museum, and the Midway Village and Museum Center (local history). Rockford Speedway hosts NASCAR automobile racing events. The city also boasts a symphony orchestra and a professional theatre company. The gardens in Sinnissippi Park, Anderson Japanese Gardens, and Klehm Arboretum and Botanic Garden provide outdoor recreational opportunities. Rock Cut State Park is northeast. The city and its environs contain numerous parks and forest preserves, for which Rockford is called the “Forest City.” The city’s largest annual event is the On the Waterfront Festival, an art, food, and music festival attracting thousands of people each Labor Day weekend. Inc. town, 1839; city, 1852. Pop. (2010) 152,871; Rockford Metro Area, 349,431; (2020) 148,655; Rockford Metro Area, 338,798."
