        "text": "Following nine months of construction, the YMCA of Rock River Valley unveiled its new fitness center expansion at the SwedishAmerican Riverfront YMCA on July 8, 2024. The two-story, 9,000-square-foot addition doubles the size of the fitness center.\n\nThe center features mostly new equipment including 50 pieces of cardio equipment, a functional training space on turf - similar to what is available at the Northeast Family YMCA, additional plate-loaded items, and squat racks with bumper plates and platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the Y is proud to be the first fitness center in the region to introduce EGYM, a comprehensive training option that takes the guesswork out of exercise. EGYM smart circuit machines automatically adjust to the userâ€™s custom settings for weight, range of motion and cardiovascular exercise. Users are guided through a full-body workout in as little as 20 minutes. Click here to learn more about EGYM."
