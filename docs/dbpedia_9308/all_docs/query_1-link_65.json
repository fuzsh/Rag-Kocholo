        "text": "Minding the Gap started as a series of interviews on a road trip and snowballed into a confrontational saga of everything I couldn’t make sense of as a child.\n\nI was 8 years old when my single mother took a job in Rockford, Illinois, a crumbling factory city two hours west of Chicago. She remarried a physically and mentally abusive man, had a child with him and then remained with him for 17 years. Because of his explosive, often unpredictable violence, I perceived the world as lacking causality: you could do the right thing or the wrong thing, but either way things might not go well for you. After I started skateboarding at age 13, through many bruises, broken bones and hard-earned tricks, I gradually regained a sense of control over my pain. Most importantly, I found myself much happier with a group of outcasts in the streets than at home. We spent countless hours together, making our own version of a family.\n\nIn my late teens and early twenties, I was struck by loss. I’d permanently escaped my home to move to Chicago, and I wanted to know why so many of my peers were falling prey to drug addictions, jail sentences or worse. I was still filming skate videos for fun—driving solo around the country and couch-surfing with other skateboarding friends I’d met over the years. Eventually I began interviewing skateboarders: What does skateboarding feel like? Who do you love more, your mom or your dad? Who taught you the feeling of hate? These conversations often turned into impromptu therapy sessions, intimate spaces for catharsis and realizations.\n\nI discovered a pattern of absent, distant and abusive father-figures—something that affected mental health, relationships and parenting styles. A little more than one year into the project, I returned to Rockford, where I sat with a charming, goofy 16-year-old named Keire in his mother’s attic and asked him about his father. He’d never talked about their relationship before and was fidgeting with the sleeves of his sweater. When he told me about his abusive father, I felt my chest tighten with anxiety. “Did you cry?” I asked. “Wouldn’t you?” he shot back. “I did cry,” I said. We sat in silence, neither of us daring to attempt a joke.\n\nFor the next four years, I returned to Rockford to continue following Keire, as well as the ad-hoc leader of the Rockford skateboarding community, a charismatic 23-year-old named Zack who was about to become a father himself. After partnering with Kartemquin Films, I wanted to explore the connected themes of skateboarding and violence in the home through a character-driven approach. I took on a more cinema vérité style, drawing inspiration from the films that resonated with me in my adolescence: Gummo, Waking Life, Kids, Slacker—stories that captivated me with their representations of growing up in a chaotic, uncertain world. I could relate to them, and through them I could also find hope.\n\nAs I began assembling rough cuts and holding feedback screenings, people were surprised at how close I was to the themes and community of the film. With their encouragement, I began participating in the film more. À la Sherman’s March, the cameraperson was cast as a character. But then everything changed when (spoiler alert) the mother of Zack’s child told me Zack had been battering her. The heart of the film, which had been exploring how skateboarders deal with masculinity and child abuse, suddenly became much more murky with immediate and personal ramifications; I was forced to become an active participant in the story, eventually interviewing my estranged mother and half-brother about my stepfather and revisiting old footage to find a way to tell my own story.\n\nPeople are often surprised that I didn’t know Keire and only briefly knew Zack growing up but that we were still able to have candid and vulnerable moments with each other when I came back to Rockford. In the course of making the film, I realized that Zack, Keire and I were all harboring toxic experiences buried under the weight of years of societal and personal repression, and we all chose our own ways of dealing with that pressure. The film has given me a sense of clarity about myself and shown me that, while there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, some ways of coping aren’t sustainable.\n\nWhat’s clear from doing this project is that violence and its sprawling web of effects are perpetuated in large part because these issues remain behind closed doors, both literally and figuratively. My hope is that the characters who open doors in Minding the Gap will inspire young people struggling with something similar—inspire them to see that they can survive their situations, live to tell their stories and create lives of causality for themselves.\n\n— Bing Liu, Director\n\nKeire and the others say “I just felt like I didn’t fit in with my family.” Have you ever felt that way? Did you find a constructive way to let your family know how you felt? What did you think of the ways that Bing, Keire, and Zack dealt with similar feelings?\n\nZack says, “Skateboarding is more of a family than my family. We formed a family together to look out for each other because no one else is looking out for us.” How do you view the purpose of a family? Are there people you consider family who are not legally or genetically related to you? What role does this “chosen family” play in your life?\n\nWhy is it important to feel like you belong somewhere? How does a sense of belonging make people stronger or more resilient? Are there places in your community where someone could go if they felt like they didn’t belong?\n\nNina recalls that, “We didn't, like, hug or anything in my family, so, when I first moved out from me and Zack's apartment, my aunt would give me a hug every night before I went to bed. And it was so weird to me at first, I'd be like, \"Ugh, like, you're touching me! Like, don't please!\" And then after a while, I was like, \"Okay, I'm going to bed!\" [arms out] You know, where's my hug? Now I know what I want my family to be like someday.” How does your family handle physical affection? How does it make you feel? What changed for Nina between not wanting to be touched and wanting that connection? What kinds of conversations do you have and do you wish you could have about the way that your family does or doesn't respect physical boundaries? Is this the same or different for the children in your family (are they allowed to make decisions about when and how they are hugged, kissed, tickled, etc)?\n\nAs tweens and teens, the boys’ identity as skaters established them as “outsiders.” What’s the image or role of skateboarding culture in your community? How are skaters viewed/treated in your town or school?\n\nWhat’s the appeal and drawback of engaging in an activity that is frequently subject to police interference?\n\nWere you surprised by Keire’s explanation of skateboarding as being “kind of like a drug?”…“I could seriously be on the verge of having a mental breakdown, but as long as I’m able to go skate, then I’m completely fine.” How about Zack’s analysis of the sport’s appeal: “You have to control the most minute small details to make you feel normal in a world that’s not normal.”? Do you engage in any activities that get you into a “zone”? How do the activities support your well-being?\n\nKeire recalls conflicts with his father, who saw skateboarding as slacking. Do you see it that way? Beyond mastery of tricks, what skills have Keire and his fellow skaters gained from skateboarding? What skills were required for them to achieve success? Which of those skills or dispositions might make them excellent workers, citizens, or parents?\n\nConsider this exchange after Keire falls while attempting a trick:\n\nKeire: “I get mad at skateboarding like a lot, but at the end of the day I -- I love it so much that I can’t stay mad at it.”\n\nBing: “But it hurts you?”\n\nKeire: “Yeah, so did my dad, but I love him to death.”\n\nDoes the comparison make sense to you?\n\nWe see a quote on the back of a skateboard: “Some men cannot be negotiated or reasoned with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.” What do you think that means? Why might it resonate with people in Rockford’s skater community?\n\nOne of Keire’s boards includes the quote “This device cures heartache.” What activities or resources do you have in your own life that “cure heartache?” What would you write on your board (and why)? What device do you use, if any, to cure heartache?\n\nZack says, “Lately I’ve been having a lot of anxiety about not feeling like a grownup and not feeling like I’ve done enough things to set my life up properly and it’s time I do something.” What signals do you use to identify someone as “grown up”?\n\nWhile children are young, we encourage them to play, and even worry if they don’t. But at some point we expect that they will stop spending their days playing and take on more “productive” tasks. Keire recalls arguing with his dad, who wanted him to work instead of skateboard; they disagreed about when childhood pursuits should end and adulthood, with its more serious tasks, should begin. What do you see as the role of play in distinguishing between childhood and adulthood? Should play be allowed or even encouraged in adulthood?\n\nKeire says, “I feel like if I stay here, I’m just gonna get stuck here. But moving out has just always been scary. I don’t want to move out and then, by the time rent comes around, I don’t have the money. Because then I look stupid and irresponsible.” What things are/were scary to you about becoming an adult? How did/could you overcome the fear?\n\nZack sees adulthood as a demand to conform: “I was kind of raised to, you know, do what you want to do and then somewhere along the line where you just flip a switch to become like conservative American. All of a sudden there was all these rules and expectations. They were pushing [me] into this mold of someone they thought was a good person.” Is conformity part of your vision of adulthood?\n\nKeire has trouble getting used to seeing Zack as a dad. How does becoming a parent change the way that others see you?\n\nZack says, “It’s interesting how much having a kid will force you to grow up. So like I can’t get home from work and drink a 12-pack like I normally do ’cause like what if I have to get up and feed the kid or, you know, what if something happens…?” In what ways did having Elliot lead Zack to “grow up”? In what ways did having a child without being completely ready to be a parent make it harder for Zack to transition into responsible adulthood?\n\nIn several scenes we see the friends drinking and/or smoking weed. In what ways is this activity seen as a passage into adulthood? What signs indicate when is it just part of a fun social dynamic and when it drifts into destructive substance abuse? Have you ever witnessed someone cross the line from fun to abuse (like Zack did)? Did you know how to help? What did you do?\n\nKeire observers, “The older I get, the more I think about it. I feel like there's a whole part of me that really loves my family.” As you have aged, how has your relationship with your family changed? What do you think accounts for the changes?\n\nWhat did you learn from the film about the causes and effects of domestic violence? Why might people who witness or experience violence as children be vulnerable to acting violently or experiencing violence as adults? How do you think the experience of family violence shaped Bing, Keire, and Zack as they become adults? In addition to cycles of violence, what other ways has childhood trauma showed up later in their lives?\n\nBing asks, “You see any violence in your household when you were growing up?” How would you answer that question? How common is family violence in your community/communities (and if you don’t know, how could you find out)? What resources exist for people who need help to escape or cope with violence from a parent or partner?\n\nBoth Nina and Bing’s mother, Mengyue, acknowledge being physically abused by their partners but staying with them. Mengyue explains, “He had two faces, okay. He can be bad. But most a lot of time he was very sweet with me.” Nina says, “even though I've seen the worst of him, I know that there's a lot of good things about him, too.” What barriers, in addition to love, might have prevented them from leaving the relationship? Did you understand their reasons for staying?\n\nBing doesn’t know how to process what he learns about Zack hitting Nina. She urges him not to say anything, fearing it will make things worse. How does silence perpetuate the problem? What would you have advised Bing to do? If you were in Bing’s shoes, what would you have wanted to say to Zack?\n\nWhat was your reaction to Zack’s explanation of his violence towards Nina, “if a [f***ing] woman is acting the fool, and you’ve asked them to stop, you’ve tried to get away from the situation, you have done everything that you can do to avoid the situation peacefully and she’s coming at you wanting to argue and fight like she’s a [f***ing] man, like she’s ready to hurt you -- you can’t beat up women, but some bitches need to get slapped sometimes. Does that make sense?” Does it make sense to you? Have you ever heard similar justifications? Did/do you find them to be convincing? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways is Bing holding his friend accountable? What impact might this have on Zack and Nina’s relationship as co-parents?\n\nKeire remembers being beaten by his father for stealing. He resented it, but never stole again. In your view, does the outcome justify the abuse? How might race or ethnicity factor into choices about discipline? Is abuse a reasonable response to fear that a child’s actions could endanger the family, or that failing to act as a model citizen could put the child in danger?\n\nKeire is surprised when Bing reveals that he is making the film “because I was physically disciplined by my stepfather and it didn’t make sense to me and I saw myself in your own story.” Why do you suppose they hadn’t spoken about their experiences before now? What makes conversations about family violence difficult or scary?\n\nThere is a scene where Keire looks on as friends laugh at a racist video. What do you suppose he is thinking at that moment? Have you had an experience like that? What was it like? What do you wish the people in the room had done?\n\nKeire, who has earned enough to buy a car, recounts being pulled over and having the officer pull a gun on him for obeying the order to get his license and registration (which was in the glove box). Aware of recent encounters between black men and police, he realizes that he could have died. How does that awareness shape who he is becoming?\n\nKeire says, “my dad told me about being black. He said like, being black is cool because you get to prove people wrong, like, every day… [so they feel bad] for profiling you.” What do you think Keire learned about racism from his father’s coping strategy? What do you think Keire’s friends learned?\n\nWhat bonds might Bing and Keire share because they are both people of color? What do they have in common that their white friends don’t share? As Asian and Black, how do you think they experience race or racism differently? What accounts for the differences?\n\nWhen one of the white guys in the room commiserates and compares Keire’s experiences with his own, Evan challenges him with an argument about white privilege (though he doesn’t use that term). Consider the end of the exchange:\n\nGuy: “There’s a certain class of white that’s not -- that’s easy to be white in America, but then like if you’re like trailer trash white, then it’s not easy to live in America.”\n\nEvan: “I feel like it is easy, like you still could go and cut your hair and go and get a job because they don't look at you like [Keire].”\n\nWhat’s your take on this conversation? What are your thoughts about white privilege? Do the people around you understand or acknowledge white privilege? How does white privilege manifest in the lives of your friends and family? Do you think the privileges and disadvantages that are being argued about in this conversation are mutually exclusive? What emotions do you think each of the people in this room feel during this conversation?"
