        "text": "Workers in the Rockford, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area had an average (mean) hourly wage of $27.52 in May 2023, compared to the nationwide average of $31.48, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Regional Commissioner Jason Palmer noted that higher paying major occupational groups included management ($55.59), healthcare practitioners and technical ($46.79), and legal ($44.42). Lower paying occupations included food preparation and serving related ($15.78), personal care and service ($16.61), and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance ($17.59). (See table A.)\n\nOccupational groups with the highest employment in the Rockford area included production (12.7 percent), transportation and material moving (11.9 percent), and office and administrative support (11.0 percent). Major occupational groups on the lower end of local employment included legal (0.4 percent); life, physical, and social science (0.4 percent); and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media (0.9 percent). (See table A.)\n\nOne occupational group—production—was chosen to illustrate the diversity of data available for any of the 22 major occupational categories. Rockford had 17,580 jobs in production, accounting for 12.7 percent of local area employment, compared to the 5.8-percent share nationally. The average hourly wage for this occupational group locally was $21.97, compared to the national wage of $22.90.\n\nSome of the larger detailed occupations within the production group included miscellaneous assemblers and fabricators (4,070), machinists (1,730), and computer numerically controlled tool operators (1,390). Among the higher-paying jobs in this group were water and wastewater treatment plant and system operators with mean hourly wages of $34.97, first-line supervisors of production and operating workers ($31.41), and computer numerically controlled tool programmers ($30.95). At the lower end of the wage scale were laundry and dry-cleaning workers ($15.71) and pressers, textile, garment, and related materials ($16.11). (Detailed data for the production occupations are presented in table 1; for a complete listing of detailed occupations available go to www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_40420.htm.)\n\nLocation quotients allow us to explore the occupational make-up of a metropolitan area by comparing the composition of jobs in an area relative to the national average. (See table 1.) For example, a location quotient of 2.0 indicates that an occupation accounts for twice the share of employment in the area than it does nationally. In the Rockford area, above-average concentrations of employment were found in many of the occupations within the production group. For instance, computer numerically controlled tool operators were employed at 8.1 times the national rate in Rockford, and machinists, at 6.5 times the U.S. average. Bakers had a location quotient of 1.1 in Rockford, indicating that this particular occupation’s local and national employment shares were similar.\n\nThe statistics in this release are from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey, a cooperative effort between BLS and the State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). BLS funds the survey and provides the procedures and technical support. State Workforce Agencies collect most of the data: in this case, the Illinois Department of Employment Security.\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey is a semiannual survey measuring occupational employment and wage rates for wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments in the United States. The OEWS data available from BLS include cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the nation; over 580 areas, including states and the District of Columbia, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), nonmetropolitan areas, and territories; national industry-specific estimates at the NAICS sector, 3-digit, most 4-digit, and selected 5- and 6-digit industry levels; and national estimates by ownership across all industries and for schools and hospitals. Full OEWS data tables are available online.\n\nAdditional information about the OEWS estimates and methodology are available in the national Technical Notes. The overall national response rate for the six panels, based on the 50 states and the District of Columbia, is 65.8 percent based on establishments and 64.3 percent based on weighted sampled employment. The sample in the Rockford, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area included 1,546 establishments with a response rate of 62 percent.\n\nMetropolitan area definitions\n\nThe substate area data published in this release reflect the standards and definitions established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe Rockford, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Boone County and Winnebago County.\n\nFor more information\n\nAnswers to frequently asked questions about the OEWS data, as well as general program documentation, are available on the OEWS website.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.
