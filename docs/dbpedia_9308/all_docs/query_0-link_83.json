        "meta_description": "In 1973, Jim Fosgate made a startling discovery while working in his garage in Arizona, USA. Mr. Fosgate realized that music and the human ear have different audio properties. The human ear didn’t have the same sonic “curve” or signature, which made lower frequencies sound different at low volumes than the actual music. Mr. Fosgate invented a solution, the Frequency Energizer, which would later become the patented Punch EQ.  The Punch EQ adds a Bass Boost up to +18 dB at 45 Hz and a Treble Boost hinge filter active from 1 kHz to 20 kHz with up to +12 dB at 20 kHz resulting in better sound reproduction for your ears.",

Your entire driving environment - car windows, road noise and your annoying life mate that never stops yappin' - all benefit from the musical energy that Punch EQ injects back into the system. The sound of THE PUNCH gave Mr. Fosgate’s first customers the impact that their music needed. Now that same PUNCH is the sound of Rockford Fosgate® and you can hear it in everything we make.\n\nRockford Fosgate® is POWER. For those who don’t eat, drink and sleep audio, this may seem a little terrifying. Why would someone want thousands of watts of Rockford Fosgate® power in an amplifier that’s bigger than most cars are wide? Because sometimes, too much power is perfect!\n\nRockford Fosgate® is built for the future. We implement the most state-of-the-art technology in the audio world. Best of all, our entire line of products…amps, subwoofers, speakers, processors, and source units are designed and engineered in Tempe, AZ, USA!\n\nRockford Fosgate® isn’t just about technology. We’re about creating human experiences in sound. Technology and audio science merge in brilliant design of circuitry and components that enable you to enjoy impactful and passionate music. Just as the artists intended. Jim Fosgate founded Rockford with a passion for music, and he’s still pursuing his dream. Mr. Fosgate won an Emmy® Award for his ingenuity in developing surround sound technology. You could say his entire career has been defined by music and technology.\n\nRockford Fosgate® Where Music Meets Technology."
