Our organization works to bring new life to downtown Rockford by establishing a weekly tradition that draws people into the heart of the city, creates a vibrant community center, increases business at downtown shops & restaurants, and serves as an incubator for new businesses.

We hope you join us in the goal and meet us at the Market.
