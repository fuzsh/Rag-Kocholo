(12/24)\n\nListeners of WMIT/Black Mt (106.9 The Light) have once again demonstrated their tremendous generosity, pledging support last week for 177 families in the stations listening area, including Western North Carolina and parts of South Carolina and Tennessee. Listeners adopted families in need, all of whom were struggling financially, by offering to provide clothing, gifts, food and other items during Christmastime. 106.9 The Light worked through 14 crisis assistance ministries, who identified 177 families in need in area communities. The station set aside nine hours of air time (6-9 a.m. and 12-6 p.m.) on Dec. 14 to promote the need and have each family adopted. The response was so great that all 177 families had been adopted by 12:30 p.m. Our station team, the volunteers, everyone, watched in awe as listeners called in to help out families they didnt know, so that this Christmas, the love of Jesus was something they did know, said Jim Kirkland, executive director of 106.9 The Light. Our goal with the project was not to raise funds, but to raise up families to help other families. We had phones ringing off the hook as people just jumped at the chance to provide for others needs. (12/23)\n\nBy a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the FCC passed the so-called \"Net Neutrality\" rules aimed at prohibiting internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating between Internet traffic. Supporters of \"Net Neutrality\" have been disappointed by the proposed rules, saying they heavily favor the industry they are supposed to regulate. Democratic Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Michael Copps both voted with Chairman Julius Genachowski in favor of the new rules, despite saying they believed the Open Internet Order to be too weak. Republican Commissioners Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker voted against it.\n\nRepublican Commissioner McDowell wrote in an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal, \"Analysts and broadband companies of all sizes have told the FCC that new rules are likely to have the perverse effect of inhibiting capital investment, deterring innovation, raising operating costs, and ultimately increasing consumer price, on this winter solstice, we will witness jaw-dropping interventionist chutzpah as the FCC bypasses branches of our government in the dogged pursuit of needless and harmful regulation.\" (12/21)\n\nWRBS/Baltimore (95.1 Shine FM) Promotions Director Erin BranhamI checks in with HisAir.Net with some good advice for Christian Radio. Erin says she saw a contest on Facebook by one of their artists this past week that violated Facebooks promotions guidelines, and she's seen other stations run contests that violate the promotions guidelines as well. She's wondering how many stations/labels dont know that Facebook has guidelines that govern contests and they have recently updated their promotions guidelines... Heres the link to Facebooks guidelines: http://www.facebook.com/promotions_guidelines.php.\n\nThe bottom is you cant run a contest on Facebook, except through an application on a tab on a Page. This means you cant require someone to post a status update, make a wall comment, upload a photo (unless its a third party app), etc, as condition for entry. You also cant notify winners through Facebook. (12/21)\n\nMonday 12/20 205 veterans will have a better Christmas, thanks to WWWA/Augusta, ME (Worship-FM) listeners.

Were very happy we can share some joy with these fine men and women who have served our country. Its a small way we can give back in our community this Christmas and we look forward to delivering these gifts Monday afternoon. (12/20)\n\nBlessing Blitz, a fundraiser for local charities, will air from 7AM to noon Wednesday on KKEQ/Grand Forks (QFM 104.9).

WDJC/Birmingham 4.2 (12/10)\n\nRussian government authorities have shut down The New Life Radio Satellite Network (Moscow, Russia) FM affiliate in the far north Russian city of Norilsk saying the local station did not produce enough programming on a daily basis to satisfy broadcast license requirements. The radio affiliate was not able to raise sufficient funding to support local radio staff, leaving them little choice but to rebroadcast the satellite signal of New Life Radio/Moscowair 100% of the time.\n\nAs of this year, only a handful of cities in Russia have a local Christian radio station, and there has been little development of Christian radio over the last 10 years due to opposition from the Russian government and exorbitant costs for new radio station licenses. New Life Radio continues to provide signal coverage to the entire country as well as to a global Russian-speaking audience. The future of the entire Christian radio network is in jeopardy, as the Moscow station is far behind in meeting its budget for 2010. Unless new mission partners come to support its non-commercial operations, the network may be forced to drop its satellite services and other distribution. NEW LIFE RADIO is administered by Christian Radio for Russia, a non-profit ministry based in Jamestown, New York.

NRB senior vice president Craig Parshall, said that not only does the federal government help fund National Public Radio, but it also gives the network special treatment when it comes to on-air mentions of corporate sponsors. \"We can't get away with that,\" he said. \"So how can we compete?\" Parshall wants the FCC to issue clearer rules about sponsorship, defining how much on-air personalities can say about the businesses that keep them going. But the FCC says the rules are clear, and the agency doesn't play favorites. \"There are not any different rules for any groups,\" FCC spokeswoman Janice Wise said. \"The same rules (which date back to the 1930's) apply to all our licensees.\" Some Religious broadcasters feel those rules and contributing to declining donations and getting more corporate sponsors would be a help.
