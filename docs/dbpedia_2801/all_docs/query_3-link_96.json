        "text": "Complaints regarding Reasonable Accommodations received in 2014 This year AHEAD received an unusually high number of complaints from parents of candidates with dyspraxia who had been refused the use of scribes in the Leaving Certificate examination. All of these candidates met the criteria outlined by the SEC, they provided reports from occupational therapists identifying difficulties experienced by candidates including recommendations for accommodations such as a scribe. Many of these requests were refused and furthermore the difficulties for the candidates were compounded by the fact that the final decision arrived days prior to the start of the examination. This made the putting in place of alternative supports impossible. In some cases the students were given the option of using a tape recorder or a computer, but these recommendations are totally unrealistic given the timeframe and the lack of training for the candidates in using such devices.

Progress has been made in providing such access but undoubtedly there is still a need for more disability awareness, anti-stigma, and anti-discrimination training. At the same time higher education requirements, by default, involve higher cognitive capabilities. Some disabilities, those involving severe limitations of cognitive functioning, face insurmountable difficulties in meeting these higher intellectual demands, even with the most reasonable accommodations. Teacher education, for example, requires special attention to the cognitive tasks for which students are being prepared. We, therefore, discuss the role of teacher education in higher education and its special relationship to the matter of disability and inclusion. We also consider perspectives on the in..."
