In lieu of the illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable provision, there shall be added a provision as similar in terms and legal effect to the illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and which may be legal, valid, effective and enforceable.\n\nSECTION 14 – MODIFICATION OF TERMS\n\nWAYF reserves the right to modify or discontinue all or any portion of the Services with or without notice to you.
