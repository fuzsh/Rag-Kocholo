        "text": "• Two well-known, faith-based media companies — Hope Media Group and WAY Media announced their intention to merge into a single Christian media organization with the goal of maximizing their reach across the U.S. through their radio stations and digital content.\n\nThis is a merger of equals and a cash-free transaction that received a unanimous vote from both boards of directors. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2022, following FCC approval.\n\nThe newly merged company will be headquartered in Houston and operate under the name Hope Media Group. Joe Paulo (left), current Hope Media Group Pres. & CEO will serve in the same capacity at the merged entity. Paulo said, “We are incredibly excited to join forces with WAY Media to not only continue our shared mission of connecting people to God, but to create even more opportunities to spread His hope for good. We know that together we can accomplish more. The board of directors for each ministry has been prayerful about this for months and we believe this will also further ignite a new trend of collaboration and unity amongst Christian ministries.”\n\nTim Dukes (right), Interim CEO of WAY Media will serve as Chief Operating Officer of Hope Media Group. “We have a vision to integrate the best of both ministries and be better together for the cause of Christ,” Dukes said. “More will be shared soon to announce the leadership team for the combined entity that will still be focused on serving our existing audiences with excellence, in addition to growing through further digital expansion and new terrestrial radio markets.”\n\nHope Media Group was founded 40 years ago with one radio station, KSBJ-FM/Houston, and is now a family of media brands that also includes new Spanish Christian “Vida Unida,” digital content outlets NGEN Radio, Hope On Demand and Amen: The Prayer App, plus a concert and event brand, Special Events."
