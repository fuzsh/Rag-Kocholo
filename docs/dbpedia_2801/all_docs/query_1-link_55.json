        "text": "WAY FM has grown to be a major national chain of Christian radio stations. In the early 1980's Christian music radio networks as they exist today were yet to be created. Contemporary Christian music itself was barely a trickle compared to its cultural presence in 2007. But the 1980's would prove to be a pioneering decade for the Christian pop and rock airwaves. One of those big waves started on the shores of Southwest Florida and in the twenty years that followed, crossed the country and changed the way Christian radio was done.\n\nWAY FM Denver Colorado\n\nKXWA (89.7 FM, \"Colorado's WAY-FM\") is a radio station broadcasting a Christian contemporary format. Licensed to Loveland, Colorado, USA, it serves all areas of Northern Colorado including Ft. Collins-Loveland-Greeley and the Denver-Boulder metro area. The station also serves the Cheyenne-Laramie areas of Wyoming. The station signed on March 11, 2004 and is currently owned by WAY-FM Media Group.
