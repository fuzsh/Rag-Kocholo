        "text": "Mission, Value, Faith\n\nFROM FOUNDER BOB AUGSBURG\n\nWayFM recently celebrated our 25th Year. I was just in my early 30’s when this dream of starting a radio station to minister to youth and young adults started to take root first in my wife’s heart and soon to follow in mine. I was the morning D.J at a Christian station in my hometown (Ft. Myers, Florida) but the station was more focused on seniors. After God continued to burden us with this idea to venture out by faith and begin a new kind of Christian radio station, we stepped out of our comfort zone and began the long process of applying with the government for a new FM radio station. God answered those prayers and on October 9, 1987 WayFM was born in Fort Myers.\n\nWayFM was only one of 3 or 4 Top 40 Christian music stations in the U.S at the time. We had very little funds. In fact there was only 2 weeks of reserves in the WayFM account to keep the station on the air. But our excitement and vision for this new ministry was so strong, we didn’t stop to think about how we would pay the bills in the weeks and months to follow. Here we are 25 years later. Obviously God came through\n\nOver the years the faithful gifts from listeners who also cared deeply about reaching people for Christ has allowed WayFM to expand into numerous cities throughout the country. WAY also has a growing following abroad as more and more people find us on the web and through online platforms like iHeart Radio. It would not be possible without the generous gifts from individuals as well as businesses who believe in our mission.\n\nBob Augsburg President / Founder\n\nbob@www.wayfm.com\n\nOur History\n\nBOB & FELICE AUGSBURG\n\nby Amy Bartlett\n\nIn the early 1980’s Christian music radio networks as they exist today were yet to be created. Contemporary Christian music itself was barely a trickle compared to its cultural presence in 2007. But the 1980’s would prove to be a pioneering decade for the Christian pop and rock airwaves. One of those waves started on the shores of Southwest Florida and in the twenty years that followed, crossed the country and changed the way Christian radio was done.\n\n1982\n\nBob and his wife Felice had moved back to Fort Myers, Florida mainly to raise their children near family. Bob took on the position of Program Director at WSOR in Fort Myers. WSOR catered mostly to the senior citizen community which was the majority of the population. On-air, Bob handled the morning show, targeted at a 45+ audience but he sensed something was missing. Something was missing, but not just at that station — it was missing culturally, nationwide. So Bob approached his superiors with the idea of committing at least a segment of air time to the area’s college and high school community. There was concern about confusing or losing a handful of their target listeners, but still there was clearly a need that wasn’t being met and the station stepped up to bat. At the time, Bob recounts, “there was perhaps one album coming out every six months,” which would make programming a weekly segment hard enough. New music to program a station’s daily playlist was out of the question.\n\nBob’s proposal was approved. They called the program “Lifeline.” It was to be a 5 hour stretch of Christian pop and rock on Saturday nights hosted by Jeff Taylor and its impact was immediately detectable. A group of local youth pastors, inspired by the “buzz” they were hearing from youth and their families started putting on local concerts. Bob and Felice attended one of these events and watched as 150 or so teenagers went forward to accept Christ. It was a powerful image of the impact this one small programming step was making on real lives, but it stirred deeper questions."
