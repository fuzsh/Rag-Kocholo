        "text": "Way-FM is one of the “bellwether” Christian radio networks in the nation. Founded in Florida, it is now headquartered in Colorado Springs, and has stations in 12 states.\n\nYesterday, the Way Media Board of Directors and President/CEO John Scaggs announced he is stepping down from his post, effective immediately. The new first broke on HisAir.net, an industry website.\n\nScaggs said, “Leading through the pandemic is the hardest thing many of us have done. The board recognized this and recommended a season of rest for me, to which I’ve agreed. My wife Cathy and I plan to relax and catch our breath before finding another great Kingdom role to serve in.”\n\nCurt Swindoll, Board Chair for Way Media, told HisAir, “Succeeding a beloved founder is never easy, as John did in 2017 following the retirement of Bob Augsburg. But in his four years of service, he established a fresh vision and course for tremendous ministry. We are grateful for the passionate contribution John made.”\n\nWay Media COO Tim Dukes has been appointed interim President while the board prepares for a national search to select a permanent replacement.\n\nAccess to MinistryWatch content is free.
