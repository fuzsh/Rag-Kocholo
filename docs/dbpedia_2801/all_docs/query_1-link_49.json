        "text": "Hope Media Group (HMG), the Houston-based ministry with multiple platforms including broadcast radio, streaming audio, video and other digitalcontent, mobile apps, and events, has formed a strategic partnership with Worship 24/7. Based in Portland, OR, Worship 24/7 is a radio and digital ministry dedicated to worship music and is currently heard on 8 terrestrial U.S. signals and in 191 countries.\n\nAccording to Joe Paulo, CEO and President of HMG, “Worship 24/7 is a unique brand that aligns with the passion and purpose of HMG and will be a great partner as we expand Christian media options for the Portland market.” Paulo explains, “On Monday, Oct. 30, 2023, we will begin airing Worship 24/7’s format via a local marketing agreement on 96.3FM (KKWA), which has aired our WayFM network the last four years and is currently one of four Contemporary Christian Music stations in Portland. We are committed to serving the people of the Pacific Northwest, and together with Worship 24/7 we can offer an around the clock worship experience as a truly meaningful and differentiated media option.”\n\n“Four years ago, when we launched Worship 24/7, we were optimistic about what God would do with this idea, but all expectations of signals, listener support, audience, and ministry impact have been far exceeded,” added David Harms, President, and General Manager of Worship 24/7. “Also from the very beginning, there has been a sense that our home in Portland was to play a vital role in this worldwide worship movement. This LMA and partnership with Hope Media Group establishes a signal in our own backyard and will ignite further growth of this worldwide ministry.”"
