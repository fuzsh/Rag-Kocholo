Starting this Saturday the Christian music station is moving to a different location, 92.5 FM. A new radio station in Pueblo broadcasts at 103.3 so WAY-FM is making a change.\n\n“Because of this closeness in dial positions, some listeners to this new station that live in the Springs aren’t able to listen clearly to their station and have shared their comments with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),\" said WAY-FM president Bob Augsburg. \"The FCC encouraged WAY-FM to find a new FM frequency, which we have done voluntarily. We believe that our move to 92.5 will serve both our WAY-FM listeners as well as listeners to Power 103.3 in Pueblo.”"
