        "text": "I have been listening for years. When you get into my car WAY-FM is what is on the radio. My rider listens to a talk station because they give the traffic report every 10 minutes and that is very important to us that travel on the Interstates to go to work. If you guys could give the traffic report more often to help us, Instead of having to switch to another station to hear if there is an accident up a head to get off to avoid. Love youâllâs music, you pick just the right songs to play. Jesus is with all of us. Please help by giving the traffic report more during the rush hours. Love you guys!!! â£ï¸\n\nThe WayFM app works well and operates as expected. No problems connecting.\n\nI just wish the music had a bigger playlist with more variation. Too many songs use the same words, phrases and formula, with a lot of Sunday morning anthems. The DJs are interesting. So, I play the app at times (almost every day for a short time) and then switch to Pandora, my own music or other stations like YesFM or WJTL.\n\nSometimes it seems like Christian radio has buried any music that is complicated or compelling and replaced it with cookie cutter and simple worship. A whole generation of kids doesnât even know that Christian music used to be challenging. They do not even know that people like Rich Mullins, Out of The Grey, Jars of Clay and others exist. It reminds me of how China buries ideas. I need to be challenged with good music. Praise and worship is okay, but it has no thought or depth. Why do we turn our people over to the worlds music?\n\nSo Iâve never written a review before, but I saw another review and I decided to. The comment was that there is little variety and depth in the songs played in this app. The thing is, when you are weak and your soul and heart are parched dry and you NEED a reminder that God is there and in control, the simple and direct messages are what you really need. This is WAYFM. When I feel lost at sea with no anchor, the truths in the music they play bring you back to the place you need to be. Thank you so much WAYFM. You have blessed my family in so many ways."
