        "text": "What could be the reason there is no sound?\n\n1. Make sure your speakers and the media player are not muted :) Not an uncommon problem ;)\n\n2. Please try again in another browser, preferably Chrome, Firefox and when using a windows media player option Internet Explorer.\n\n3. Try another stream type clicking: windows media player or external player as alternative\n\n4. Be patient, some radiostations load within 10-20 seconds due to high traffic issues.\n\n5. If you do not have any flash player we automatically load the second best player, so again be patient.\n\n6. If the stream doesn't start automatically please click the play button or the mp3 option on the right, please retry 1,2 or 3 times. Most of the times this works.\n\n7. If you are using a windows media player, this will mostly only work in Internet Explorer.\n\n8. A radiostation might be temporarily unavailable due to several reasons. If your favorite station is not working right now, please try again in a few moments.\n\n9. The media player isn't showing/working in your browser, check below what you can do about it\n\n10. Try another computer or device (tablet, phone etc).\n\n11. Some radiostations have limited rights for international broadcasting. Some stations only broadcast in their own country. For example BBC in the UK and lots of stations in the US. If you really want to listen use a proxy server from that specific country to solve this problem.\n\n12. Report this issue using our Broken Link page or send an email to [email protected]. We are able to see if there is something wrong.\n\nIf this does not work you can try one of the options below.\n\nPlease try these 5 options first:\n\nDownload the latest version of Windows Media Player if you are using Internet Explorer, Chrome or Opera\n\nif you use google chrome and you have no sound then click here for a solution\n\nDownload the Windows Media Player plugin for Firefox if you are using Firefox and then check if it works, click here\n\nDownload the latest Flash player\n\nDownload the latest version of Real Player\n\nWhy do I see a grey screen?\n\nProbably this is caused by an popup adblocker\n\nHow to Use the Pop-up Blocker In Internet Explorer 7\n\nHow to Use the Pop-up Blocker In Internet Explorer 8\n\nBlock Pop-up Windows with Internet Explorer\n\nHow to Disable the Popup Blocker in Firefox\n\nStream keeps on buffering\n\nIn Windows Media Player you can improve this. Go to Extra, Options, and then tab performance to extend the netwerkbuffer to 15 seconds.\n\nInternet Explorer: no sound in internet explorer?\n\nDownload the latest version of Windows Media Player from Microsoft\n\nFirefox: no sound in firefox?\n\nDownload the Windows Media Player Firefox Plugin\n\nMore info on using Windows Media Player in Firefox\n\nCommon sound problems with Firefox\n\nCheck if Windows Media Player is correctly installed\n\nChrome: no sound in chrome?\n\nProblems with listening in Google Chrome? try this or Download the Windows Media Player Chrome Plugin\n\nOpera: no sound in opera?\n\nProblems with listening in Opera? try this\n\nThe radiostation still refuses to play, what can I do?"
