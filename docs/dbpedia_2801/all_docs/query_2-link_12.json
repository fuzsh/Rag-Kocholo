        "text": "In honor of International Women’s Day (March 8) I’ve reached out to female founders in the fashion world to highlight their successful businesses and get their insights on what makes them feel empowered. Keep reading to learn about some amazing female-founded fashion labels and get their advice on how to make it as women in the entrepreneur world.\n\nBlackbough Founder & CEO Jemina Ty\n\nJemina Ty is a 27-year-old Filipina who built Blackbough from her bedroom after noticing a lack of affordable, well-made bikinis in the market. Since selling her bikini designs to friends, her business has grown exponentially and now counts celebrities like Miley Cyrus, Lucy Hale, and Vanessa Hudgens as fans.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nJEMINA TY: I love being able to create clothing that I want to wear! Bringing my ideas to life and turning them into reality feels really empowering. Brainstorming and experimenting are crucial parts of my process, and seeing women all over the world look amazing in my designs fuels my drive to improve my products and craft.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nJT: I’m proud to say that women have always led Blackbough Swim, and women make up a vital majority of our current team. In fact, our workforce is 97% women. We believe that women's leadership and creativity are essential in modern business, so we’re always encouraging our female team members to speak up and share their ideas. I also make sure to invest in my team members through benefits like health insurance and mental health support, flexible work arrangements, and upskilling opportunities.\n\nBuilding a safe and inclusive space for women through our business is essential to me, and that includes our professional interactions with other partners. Blackbough also supports several women-centered charities, including our long-time partner Tahanan Sta. Luisa (an organization that cares for homeless, orphaned, or abandoned female youth) and our weaving community in the Ilocos Sur province. We also work with women-led businesses like Frasier Sterling and talents like Barbara Kristoffersen.\n\nOur goal with Blackbough is to build a brand that’s not only beloved for its products but also for its position as a voice for women all over the world to dream big, take up space, do great things, and lead.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nJT: The Tona Top and Maui Bottoms are my forever faves. The classic twist top and sporty-cheeky bottoms were some of our first designs back in 2017, right when Blackbough started. These styles instantly became a hit, and I absolutely swear by them! They’re what I’d quickly grab from my closet every time I want a no-frills bikini set. I especially love this combo in unique prints that evoke positive emotions just by looking at it. I’m currently obsessed with the Tona and Maui in some of our newest designs, like Sour Slush, a psychedelic print we commissioned from a female artist, and Wild Petunia and Secret Garden, which are dainty, nature-inspired prints.\n\nBeginning March 1, 2022, Blackbough Swim will engage in a year-long partnership with Tahanan Sta. Luisa, an organization that cares for homeless, orphaned, and abandoned female youth in the Philippines. From March 1-8, 2022, they will be donating $1 for every piece purchased from their Good Stuff collection. Blackbough Swim will be sending care packages to assist with their daily operations throughout the year. These packages will contain food, vitamins, hygiene products, COVID-19 essentials, and recreational materials like badminton equipment.\n\nBrilliant Earth Co-Founder & CEO Beth Gerstein\n\nWhen Brilliant Earth co-founder Beth Gerstein got engaged, she and her fiancé struggled to find engagement rings that were ethically sourced and made, so she launched her own ethically sourced fine jewelry business.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nBETH GERSTEIN: Acting with intention through decision making; one of our core brand pillars is bias toward action: when you see an opportunity, seize the moment and go for it. To foster opportunity and growth, it is important to set a company culture around ownership and creating a safe environment where others are not afraid to fail. As a mission-driven brand, when I see Brilliant Earth making an impact, I feel empowered to continue in our efforts to drive change. On a personal level, being heard and having the freedom to learn from my failures has been integral to my growth and is empowering.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nBG: It is important to me that my company is driven by strong female leaders where we can learn and grow from each other. Whether it’s hiring or promoting women for leadership positions or cultivating a majority female Board of Directors, we’ve worked hard to have an inspiring environment that encourages other females to excel. Fostering female talent by identifying potential early on, coaching and providing growth opportunities are key to paving the way for future senior female leaders.\n\nWe also demonstrate this is a priority for our company by promoting female empowerment in our non-profit efforts—including our Moyo gems initiative which supports female gemstone miners in Tanzania.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nBG: Our newest collection and one I’m most excited about is our The Wildflower Collection which features engagement rings, wedding bands and fine jewelry with an expansive offering of hand-selected gemstones. This collection comes at the perfect time to usher in the biggest wedding season, it’s filled with vibrant pops of color and unique design intricacies. We know our customers will love this fresh take and latest addition to our nature-inspired jewelry assortment.\n\nBYCHARI Founder Chari Cuthbert\n\nEstablished in 2012, BYCHARI is a reflection of designer Chari Cuthbert's approach to life and style. Chari recognized her rare approach to fashion, she had pared down her closet to simple, high quality investment pieces that she made her own with layered fine jewelry. Often passed down from women in her family or found on her travels, each piece told a story and became a way to redefine minimal style.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nCHARI CUTHBERT: The very fact that I built BYCHARI from the ground up with my own two hands still amazes me to this day. From pushing myself to enter a male-dominated industry with confidence to single-handedly learning about every aspect of production, I am empowered by my own story and hope to inspire others in the same way. I am grateful to have an amazing team of women behind me and could not be where I am today without them.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nCC: I strive to support women of all backgrounds, both in my personal life and through BYCHARI. Gender wage inequality is unfortunately still present and prevalent in 2022; Hiring an all-female team has not only equalized the playing field but has empowered us all to work together and grow BYCHARI beyond our wildest dreams.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nCC: While I love to change up my Jewelry every day, my BYCHARI Diamond Initial Necklace is my favorite piece at the moment. Every day, I wear the initials of somebody very special to me. No matter how far away they may be, I still have a piece of them with me wherever I go.\n\nCAMILLA Founder Camilla Franks\n\nCamilla Franks, the mastermind behind Aussie luxury lifestyle brand CAMILLA, is one of Australia’s leading fashion designers and is celebrated globally for her artistic, innovative and intricate designs that weave in stories from her travels abroad and imaginative escapism. Since launching her eponymous label in 2004, the brand has since grown into a global print house with a unique aesthetic that’s instantly recognizable and with storytelling at heart of its designs.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nCAMILLA FRANKS: Taking risks! There’s magic in trusting your intuition, in unbridled creativity galloping free on the plains of opportunity. No matter how ridiculous my ideas first seem, they’re grounded in key values and instinct, and fearlessly following them down unfamiliar paths usually leads to success. That is incredibly empowering! It’s terrifying at times, but staying true to myself is incredibly empowering. I like getting uncomfortable to get comfortable.\n\nIn 18 years of concocting CAMILLA, I’ve never done things the expected way. I directed an opera for my first runway show celebrating women of all different ages, shapes, and sizes. I launched new boutiques in the US and Australia during a worldwide pandemic, and some\n\ncalled me crazy, but with faith in the joyous power of print, launched new categories like wallpaper, surfboards, pet beds, and crockery.\n\nEmpowerment is found in hurling caution to the wind, in deep faith that the universe rewards bravery. Sucking the marrow out of life makes me feel empowered!\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nCF: I always wanted CAMILLA to be a symbol of love, joy, and inclusivity, for every person who wears us. Our vision for the brand stretches far beyond the walls of the design studio. Our dream is to drive change for future generations and create a brighter future for all.\n\nI’m proud that we’re now renowned not just for our products, but for our community. A human collective of all ages, genders, shapes, colors, abilities, lifestyles, faiths, and sexualities. Just wearing our prints, and the stories they celebrate, can make strangers friends, connected in instant recognition of the values they share.\n\nI strive to use my voice and our platforms to fortify this community; our family - to share inspiring stories, to educate and encourage action in this world, and come together supportively. Even my boutique styling angels have their own Facebook accounts, to extend the connection they have with our customers in-store—many of whom gravitate to us in times of trauma, illness, insecurity, and loss. We are all warriors, stronger together!\n\nCAMILLA has long-running charitable partnerships that tackle domestic violence, child marriage, breast cancer, cultural change, ethics, and sustainability across the globe, and we are conscious of learning to adapt as the world evolves.\n\nIn a noisy world, it’s important to raise your voice only to lift people up.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nAfter an enchanted white winter spent in Wales, I’m SO ready for warmer days ahead spent marinating in the sun in crystal-embellished swimsuits and kaftans, and by night, I’m into printed silk party dresses, catsuits, jumpsuits, whimsical wovens...more is more, darling!\n\nOur mother, Mother Nature, our planet needs to be nurtured. This is why our swimsuits are now made of 100% recycled ECONYL which is regenerated nylon, crafted from waste materials that would otherwise end up polluting our majestic planet.\n\nMy primal need to protect Mother Earth was born on the sands of Bondi Beach with the inception of CAMILLA. We dance to the rhythm of her beating heart, and our ode to her plays through our sustainable swimwear collection, and how we choose to live our lives with purpose.\n\nFrasier Sterling Founder Frasier Sterling\n\nFrasier launched her accessory line out of her apartment when she was just 20 years old. The accessible jewelry brand has only grown since 2011 and now counts celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid amongst its fans.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nFRASIER STERLING: I'm currently eight months pregnant with my first baby and running Frasier Sterling. Running my own business has always been so rewarding, however doing it while eight months pregnant has me feeling extra empowered at the moment!\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nFS: Frasier Sterling has a following that's made up of mostly Gen-Z females. That said, we are very active on social and find it extremely important to lead by example! Promoting kindness, self-love and confidence to our young audience is a key tenant of our messaging. We also actively support and encourage our followers to support various charities and nonprofits. This month for International Women’s Day we are donating 10% of our sales to Girls Inc — an organization focused on mentor relationships, breaking the cycle of poverty and equipping young girls to become role models in their community.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nFS: I'm currently coveting my Shine On Custom Diamond Name Plate Necklace from our fine jewelry collection. It is the perfect nameplate for everyday wear. Mine says my baby's name on it, so it's extra special to me!\n\nIn celebration of International Women’s Day, Frasier Sterling will donate 10% of all sales made on Tuesday, March 8.\n\nHEYMAEVE Founder Alicia Sandve\n\nSingapore-based, Alicia Sandve created jewelry and lifestyle brand HEYMAEVE to use the business as a platform to touch lives, empower women through its community, & give back to causes dear to Alicia's heart particularly non-profit organizations that work for sexual assault survivors like herself.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nALICIA SANDVE: My voice. I grew up generally pretty timid and always afraid to speak my mind. However, many life experiences as an adult became huge learning lessons for me that caused a shift in how I've chosen to live my life. In 2019, I was sexually assaulted, and for the first time in my life, I knew that if I did not speak up for myself, no one would. That process led me to go up against a flawed legal system not necessarily designed to protect women in these situations, as well as a large investment bank that tried to intimidate me into \"going away\" because the perpetrator worked for them.\n\nI sat in rooms first with the police, then with this investment bank's HR & legal counsel multiple times throughout this process advocating and fighting for myself. It was extremely painful & uncomfortable, especially having to share intimate details about what happened to me first to a male cop, then to a room full of people who really did not have my interest at heart, but the company's. What they wanted was for me to \"disappear\" and to \"stop talking\". I knew though my voice was all I had, so I pushed through the pain and continued to advocate and fight for myself. Even though the outcome of it all was not entirely favorable, I know that I stood up for myself every step of the way, and I gave a good fight.\n\nToday, I continue to speak about what happened to me and hope that one day I will be able to hold the people involved who did not do the right thing, accountable. The fact that my voice still gives me that power today, makes me feel empowered. I am a mother to 2 beautiful little girls, Emma & Elizabeth, and I am proud to tell them this story one day. Hopefully, I have set a positive example for them to know that each and every one of us deserves to be heard, and if people don't hear you, make them.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nAS: I started HEYMAEVE less than a year after everything happened as a way to heal from everything I had gone through from the sexual assault. I was really struggling to come back from it, to go back to a somewhat normal life where I wasn't doubtful or distrusting of everything and everyone around me. I knew though, that I needed to take back control of my life. I couldn't allow what happened to define me. That was when I decided that I was going to pick myself back up and turn this painful experience into one that I could use to help educate and empower other women around sexual assault. I also knew that the only way I would be able to contribute financially to these causes was if I was able to build a business that could support that.\n\nTo be able to help others is very healing, and also the very reason why giving back is a key value of the HEYMAEVE brand. We donate $1 from every order through our site to 1 of 3 nonprofit organizations of our customer's choice. The 3 nonprofits are women-focused, Educate A Girl, Empower Survivors, Build A Woman's Future. This is facilitated by i=change to ensure transparency for all donations. We also work with nonprofit Destiny Rescue, which carries out rescue missions all over the world to rescue children from human trafficking. More often than not, these children are trafficked for sex work. We also sponsor 2 young girls in Bali, Indonesia through Bali Children's Project where we pay for their education & expenses until they graduate high school.\n\nHEYMAEVE is a jewelry lifestyle brand, but we are so much more than that. We are a brand with heart—a heart for people, for our customers, and a company that is willing to use our platform to be a voice for those who aren't heard. It is also very important to us that our customers genuinely feel appreciated and loved by us. Like it says on all our jewelry boxes our customers receive, \"Just like this piece of jewelry, you are also beautifully made.\"\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nAS: My favorite piece of jewelry at the moment is definitely our Heiress Ring. It is beautiful, luxurious, yet affordable. This ring went viral on Instagram a few months back and has become our best-selling piece of jewelry from our entire line. The Heiress Ring is also a part of our #WESTANDWITHUKRAINE collection, where 20% of the proceeds from all styles in this collection will go to Global Empowerment Mission until March 12, to support humanitarian relief for the crisis in Ukraine. That makes it all the more special.\n\nJMP The Label Co-Founder Juliette Porter\n\nSiesta Key star Juliette Porter built her loyal following of over 780,000 fans on Instagram into her customer base when she launched JMP The Label in January 2021.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nJULIETTE PORTER: I feel empowered by building this brand from the ground up and watching it grow. Launching a brand can be really intimidating, but constantly working towards your goals and putting your heart into your business is a special feeling. For a while, I didn’t have the confidence to take that leap until I met my partners. Surrounding yourself with knowledgeable people in an industry will give you the confidence to keep pushing forward. I think the number one inhibitor in starting businesses is not knowing where to begin but getting over that fear is so empowering.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nJP: I always had a passion for swimwear and fashion, but creating products that have such positive feedback and allow women to feel positive in their own skin is something I never saw coming. Swimwear can be a difficult part of a person’s wardrobe because it's vulnerable, so for customers to feel good in our bikinis and one-pieces means we’re helping rid the sometimes-uncomfortable sentiments towards swimwear. I believe swimwear is more than just a beautiful design with a unique cut — you must also feel confident in what you’re wearing to love a bathing suit. Our goal is to create pieces that allow women to channel that inner confidence and feel beautiful inside and out.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nJP: My favorite products are always pieces that haven’t been released yet because I get so excited while designing and can’t wait for others to see them. We’re about to release a white crochet bikini with colorful beads sewn in. This piece was inspired by the upcoming festival season and my obsession with a lot of color.\n\nLogan Hollowell Jewelry Founder Logan Hollowell\n\nLogan Hollowell, founder and designer of Logan Hollowell Jewelry, designs collections that encompass ancient wisdom, magic, and inspiration from the universe, always visualizing the spiritual impact and healing effect that a piece will have on its wearer.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nLOGAN HOLLOWELL: Feeling in control of my own destiny makes me feel empowered. Taking action towards achieving my goals and dreams - having a vision! Having a strong guidance system and being able to give and receive support when I need it. Having discipline and holding out for the things I desire the most. The ability to set boundaries for myself and others. I love to empower myself by listening to my inner voice - and taking good care of my physical well-being. Reading, remaining curious, and always learning as a student of life. Being able to support philanthropic efforts through my company empowers me - knowing that we can do what we love, have fun, create art, AND help others all at the same time!\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nLH: My goal is to touch hearts and souls through my mission, designs, and message. I love to support other women-owned companies; I realize that we are setting an example for each other and I truly believe that when we lift each other up, we grow! I strive to educate and inspire women on how to further love themselves and support one another through our marketing\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nLH: At the moment it is all about the emeralds. Queen emerald rings and the emerald Cuban link pieces. I truly feel like every empowered goddess needs an emerald in her repertoire. It is the stone of unconditional love and abundance. Think of green as growth. Like a lush green forest, full of life. Green is the color of the heart chakra energy center, and I couldn't think of a better stone to have in one's life to heal and attract more love and abundance. It was first discovered in ancient Egypt (full of magic) and Cleopatra's favorite stone...and we love her.\n\nMONROW Co-Founders Michelle Wenke and Megan George\n\nMichelle Wenke and Megan George met while getting their BFAs at Otis College of Art and Design, and after several years in the fashion industry, the two joined forces to launch MONROW.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nMICHELLE WENKE: People’s ideas and personalities keep me inspired which ultimately makes me feel empowered.\n\nMEGAN GEORGE: I feel empowered working with people, exchanging ideas and skills and working together to build something.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nMW: Trying to make one step out of the day easier and make you feel good with what you wear.\n\nMG: Hopefully MONROW makes women feel comfortable and confident and when we feel this way we are able to put our best self forward.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nMW: I am living in our new poplin shirts and super soft sweater sets.\n\nMG: My favorite thing from MONROW right now is our Men’s military jacket. I wear my husband’s size medium pretty much every day. It’s oversized and lightweight. It’s the perfect trans-seasonal jacket. It’s cool and casual and oh so classic MONROW.\n\nTo celebrate International Women's day, MONROW is donating 20% of the proceeds from the 'Women's Day Athletic Tee' to the Downtown Women's Center.\n\nRESA Founder Suzanne Marchese\n\nSuzanne Marchese started selling dresses online and working out of her Venice Beach apartment in 2015. RESA is now sold on sites like Revolve in addition to its e-commerce site.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nSUZANNE MARCHESE: What makes me feel empowered is helping others. I always try to offer any guidance or input especially if it’s a career path I’ve experienced before. When I look back on my days starting in manufacturing and design, it would have helped me tremendously to have someone give me their advice. To have others benefit from my past mistakes is empowering knowing this can make a difference throughout another women’s journey. This industry is not about competition, there is enough to go around for everyone to be successful. When women stick together anything is possible!\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nSM: I try and create pieces to make women feel confident and beautiful. My overall brand includes pieces that are effortless that you can throw on no matter what the occasion is. Whether it’s running a quick errand or on a night out, I want women to feel comfortable and at their best all the time.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nSM: Gosh, that is hard! I would say the Noelle Maxi is 100% my favorite dress, especially in our new knit version. The adjustable cut out feature is sexy and classy, complimenting every body type. It’s a statement piece that can be dressed up for any event or dress down with flats. It’s our best seller for a reason!\n\nSanctuary Co-Founder & Chief Creative Director Debra Polanco\n\nDebra Polanco and her husband launched Sanctuary in 1997 with the goal of creating a line that merges the laid-back style of California and effortless cool of New York for a label that provides versatile everyday clothing for its customers.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nDEBRA POLANCO: Working on and completing a project as a team and seeing the final result come together from an idea is so gratifying.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nDP: We have a great team of predominantly women in the design room. I love to bring out the best in the team by inspiring them with examples. Sanctuary also supports organizations that empower women with #sanctuarygivesback initiatives.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nDP: One of my favorite products right now is our rebel pants in either camo or solid. It's a great fun fashion cargo.\n\nSKATIE Co-Founders Mandi Glynn and Skatie Noyes\n\nSKATIE co-founders Mandi Glynn and Skatie Noyes met in 2011 while studying at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles. 5 years later, they launched SKATIE directly on Instagram and since then have been devoted to designing sustainable, ethically-made clothing.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nMANDI GLYNN & SKATIE NOYES: We feel most empowered by the community that has blossomed within our brand. We have an amazing team of hardworking women; lifting them up to help them achieve their goals within and outside the brand is what drives us. Our business wouldn't be possible without each and every one of them supporting us and lifting each other up. Outside our core team, a wonderful community of women who love our brand has grown on Instagram and TikTok. Seeing their reactions to trying our pieces on for the first time—their excitement and ease, feeling gorgeous in their own skin—is what gets us out of bed each morning.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nMG&SN: Swimwear especially is a very personal item of clothing. We do our best to be inclusive of all body types and make pieces that women feel good in. We work in a business that inherently revolves around feeling good in your own skin, so seeing our customers get that feeling in the things that we make is our greatest achievement.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nMG&SN: For the both of us, our basics are our everyday staples. Each piece is meant to be worn together to make the most comfortable yet chic outfits. Hardly a day goes by that we don't reach for at least one of these pieces, whether it's to wear out or to the office.\n\nThe Daily Edited Founder & CEO Tania Liu\n\nTania initially started The Daily Edited as a side hustle, a fashion blog and retail store, but it quickly grew into a major accessories brand. After initially studying law, Tania made the leap into the entrepreneur world and now oversees The Daily Edited full-time.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nTANIA LIU: Knowledge and experience! In my view, empowerment is the bedrock of resilience, or perhaps resilience is the bedrock of empowerment? They are part of the same process. I reflect on my experiences—successes and failures alike—and I draw out an understanding to give me strength and wisdom for the future. Equally, I try to surround myself with people who are generous with their own insights; people who share their strengths with intention, and whose creativity, intellect, or wisdom is greater than mine. I never want to be the smartest person in the room.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and to lift others?\n\nTL: In a myriad of ways, I have been carried by the strength, wisdom, and support of the women in my life, and TDE is no different. I can say without doubt or hesitation that TDE would not be where it is today without the dedication, energy, and groundswell from both our female-led team and our fabulous community.\n\nTDE is now a business going through a journey of transformation. We have a renewed commitment to being our very best version socially, environmentally, and creatively, and as with every journey in life, the ‘juice’ is really in the experience of the evolution—more so than the end destination. I really want this notion to define us and who we are. I hope that by sharing our journey with honesty and transparency, we can inspire women to back themselves and take that leap of faith to become the best version of themselves, too.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nTL: I’m loving the Cosmetic Case Set in Mango. It’s from our new High Summer collection and for me it is a signpost of the start of our creative transformation—there’s a new and exciting chapter ahead for TDE! Additionally, with so much happening in the world right now, this product also reminds me of a time when we could travel more freely to experience and immerse ourselves in different cultures. This is definitely something that I don’t take for granted.\n\nThe Range Founders Brittney and Mia Rothweiler\n\nSisters Brittney and Mia launched The Range in 2017 with the goal of introducing cool, elevated staples for women in need of stylish essentials. You can find The Range at Net-A-Porter, FWRD, Shopbop, and more.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nBRITTNEY AND MIA ROTHWEILER: Freedom makes us feel empowered. Freedom creates a life we’ve always dreamed of, to own our time and how we want to spend it - being able to work together and really taking our destiny into our own hands. We also feel empowered by a strong community and family around us. That can make us feel like we can take on anything with the right type of support behind us.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nBR&MR: We want to create clothing that makes women feel powerful and sexy and comfortable in their own skin. When you put on a piece from The Range we want you to feel instantly put together and chic which will then translate to your mood and energy throughout the day.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nBR&MR: We love dressing in sets, it makes life so much easier and also looks effortlessly cool. Where during COVID it was more casual sets, now we’re dressing in more dressed-up sets and tonal outfits. We have pairings in our thermal, rib, terry, and satin fabrics that we live in.\n\nVELA Co-Founder Marwa Atik\n\nMarwa Atik noticed a gap in the market for stylish, trendy scarves when she was 18, so she set out to design her own. With her sister and co-founder Tasneem Atik Sabri, they launched VELA as a way to elevate and modernize modest fashion.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nMARWA ATIK: Being a woman. As women, we have so many challenges that we face in running a business and in our daily lives. While at times these challenges can be hard, I remind myself that I am a woman and that I have inherited from the women before me the strength to be successful, powerful, and caring in my nature all at once. I am so proud of the business, VELA that I have built with my co-founder and sister, Tasneem Atik Sabri. I am proud that VELA is also a women-led team which means I can empower other women too!\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nMA: VELA not only sells hijabs and modest wear; we sell a message to all women and girls to be proud of who they are. Muslim women in the media are always seen as oppressed, but that is not the case. Hijab is a choice, and it is quite an empowering one. Every day I get the opportunity through VELA to support women on their journey in hijab. Every time I am out, I get stopped often by a girl, a college student, a mother, who say, \"are you VELA!? You don't know how much you mean to me and how empowered your brand makes me feel\". At the core of VELA's mission is that, to inspire women to be proud of who they are.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nThis year, I want to focus on my skincare. Right now I am absolutely loving the entire Fortuna skincare line. There is so much artistry in their products and they truly make such a difference for me.\n\nWAYF Founder Meredith Fisher\n\nMeredith Fisher launched WAYF (which stands for Where Are You From) as a 10-piece collection in 2006. Since then, the brand has expanded to include WAYF Bridal and WAYF’98 and is sold at retailers like Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, Shopbop, and Revolve.\n\nWhat makes you feel empowered?\n\nMEREDITH FISHER: It’s empowering to look back on the growth of my company and think about how far I’ve come - from sewing dresses in middle school to shipping styles from my dorm room to being carried in major retailers across the country. Today I’m empowered on a daily basis by the dedication, talent, and creativity of my majority women team as we continue expanding with new categories like bridesmaid dresses and athleisure.\n\nHow do you use your business to inspire women and lift up others?\n\nMF: We inspire women and lift up others by delivering clothing that is both accessible and inclusive, for all budgets and body types. Our collection retails mostly under $100 and is designed to fit the needs of all women so they can look good and feel good. It’s amazing to see our customers wearing WAYF and feeling confident, especially when they choose our brand for important life moments like a prom, wedding, or baby shower, and knowing that we played a small role in shaping those memories.\n\nWhat is a favorite product of yours at the moment and why?\n\nMF: Our new Spring collection is my favorite to date. We are finally able to get back to fun dressing! Our customer is going back to her life and we are able to deliver what we do best: dresses for all spring occasions, sexy sets for summer nights out, lots of print, and fun colors. I can’t wait to see our customers living their best lives in this collection!"
