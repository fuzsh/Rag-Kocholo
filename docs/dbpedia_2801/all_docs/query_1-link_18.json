        "text": "Leaving is never easy.\n\nCarlos here and, over the last 3+ years, WAY-FM has been my home and Joy has been like my little sister. It’s been an honor to share my afternoons and my life with you. We have walked through some pretty big things! You helped me navigate life through my engagement, and the first few years of my marriage, and even becoming a father. The love and advice I have received from you throughout all of it is STILL so appreciated. It’s my hope that our banter on your radio has been in the background of some significant seasons in your life, too. Thank you for being a part of my journey.\n\nSadly, it is time for my journey here at WAY-FM to come to an end. Since having my son Dominic, my wife and I have felt a strong desire to live closer to family. Living in Nashville (far away from our family) hasn’t been easy on our hearts. So, when an opportunity came up for me to be able to move my family back home, it was one of those decisions we knew we had to pray through.\n\nAfter many nights of wrestling and truly asking God – above our own desires and agendas – to give us Peace about His plan for us, we decided that we would simply trust Him to open and close the doors that only He could (Isaiah 22:22). Putting one foot in front of the other, one prayer, and one conversation after the next, every door to go home just continued opening and WAY-FM was gracious enough to align with us in obedience – never wanting to stand in the way of what God was doing in our lives.\n\nIts bittersweet to leave and the answer to this prayer also comes with some heartbreak. Leaving this show, and this season with you, has been one of the hardest decisions of my life. I have never worked with a more talented, fun, and unique co-host as I have these past few years getting to work with Joy. We’ve had the blessing of sharing our lives with you and are grateful for the countless friendships that have become more like family. Thank you for supporting and encouraging the show, and for the lifelong memories.\n\nMy last day on WAY-FM will be December 29th and Joy will have a new co-host for you to meet in the New Year! Please pray for me and my family – as well as Joy and your new Afternoon Show co-host – as we all process through some pretty big changes. Thank you for all the laughs, the fun, and the Kingdom impact we’ve shared. You have left a permanent mark on my heart, and on the hearts of my family, and it is well with my soul.\n\n– Carlos\n\nWe wanted to share some of our favorite moments from the show with you as we recap what an amazing adventure it has been!\n\nDon’t miss Carlos’ final breaks on the air as he said his goodbyes."
