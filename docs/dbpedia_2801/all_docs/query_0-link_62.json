        "text": "Ive ran into Dafran in 2016 s2 and he used to be way different. Lets just say what he is now is for the better.\n\nJeez man. Talk about overreacting. Even if Dallas is the most controversial team, even what is to come. New coach, sticking to starting lineups and no more 'kyky things' when it comes to subbing players for no reason. Dallas has been shifting roles more than any other teams and game of broken phone going in the comms. And i definietly think you are overreacting here brodie.\n\nWhy dont they just stop interacting with eachother when its obviously wrong. Is the counterpart to blame for going along with it or is just the guys fault everytime.\n\nWill see if LAG is going to break the streak of losing to Dallas for the 3rd-4th time in row.\n\nLol... Its literally S2 of first season of the OWL. Any team can hit a slump and they will work it out slowly.\n\nIn Dallas' case it is abit different since they are losing players due suspensions stirring things up.\n\nAlso when that applies to the caster desk aswell (Monte)\n\nWho knows when this whole thing is gonna crash and burn.\n\nYou speak about Taimou in a super old perspective. He was doing drunk stream back in APEX days. Now that you mentioned that you are diamond. Thats a big yikes."
