        "text": "(This post is comparing different versions of Synchronicity.)\n\nYes, you are right and I was wrong. I can't think why I said that. The post you're quoting is from over two years ago and I can only think that I was new to the Voxengo CurveEQ software at the time and a novice at interpreting the results.\n\nAs you rightly say, the old CD and the SHM-CD of Synchronicity have similar EQ but they are definitely not the same mastering by any means. The differences vary slightly from track to track but here for example is an EQ comparison for the title track:\n\nWhat this shows is that, compared to the old CD, the SHM-CD has a little bass hump at around 65Hz-70Hz; a slight lift in the treble area at around 5kHz-7kHz; and a sharp uptick at the extreme top end.\n\nI think I ignored that sharp uptick at the top end because it was out of most people's hearing range and, as Plan9 suggests, was probably just a product of dither or some such. I still feel it's unlikely to make an audible difference and I wonder if the difference you're hearing is more to do with that very slight lift in the treble. But it's not for me to tell you what you're hearing or not hearing so if you say you're hearing the uptick, I'm happy to leave it at that.\n\nMany apologies for the error. Apart from the uptick, the old CD and the SHM-Cd have very similar EQ on most tracks and on some tracks they are almost the same. But they are definitely not identical.\n\nIf you mean the 2013 Japan SHM Mini-LP (regular or platinum) yes see below, if something else then I've no idea\n\nreposting of my SHM-CD review and the album on digital:\n\nHi,\n\nUpdating my digital Synchronicity option/review to include the Platinum SHM-CD. While a new mastering, I am also updating the EAC peak chart to include it for comparison.\n\nHard to believe from 1989 until this month, Dec 2013, all the re-masterings of this album to my ears were pure sonic manure. Well this new Platinum {herein known as Plat} SHM-CD changes that, it is easily the best mastering of Synchronicity in the last 25 years, at minimum since at least the 1988 effort by MFSL.\n\nI read that the new Plat SHM-CD and the new standard SHM-CD are the exact same mastering. Since I am a collector of the catalog I went with the Plat, so I can only speak for that one.\n\nThe Plat SHM-CD is Dynamic, clear, had good mid range, decent low end given the typical early 80's bass shy mixes. The vocals may sound the best on digital that I've ever heard them.\n\nI think this new mastering exceeds the MFSL and the original \"stock\" disc, [black column in chart]. It totally crushed all previous \"remasters\" of this album including the awful sounding 2003 SACD and 2010 SHM-SACD. The Plat-SHM disc at minimum compares very favorably to the 38XB 10 Track, the 38XB-11 track and the D32Y.\n\nThe 38XB 10 track in my opinion has a slight warmer sound, but lacks the clarity of the new Plat SHM-CD. Pretty much the same for the 38XB 11 track and D32Y. I found on my Denon reference transport that the Plat SHM-CD was much more warm than on my OPPO BDP95. On my Oppo I thought the Plat SHM-CD sounded just a tad cold in direct compare to the 38XB's and D32Y, but on my Denon which I use 99% of the time for CD's the Plat SHM-CD came out a bit ahead and as a result this is now my preferred digital version of the album.\n\nIs this new Plat SHM-CD worth the money? Well for those of you who know my views on modern transfers this may surprise you, the answer is a resounding yes. I give the sound an A rating, and an A+ for the overall package. If you are a fan of this album grab one before it goes out of print. I wish all modern remasters were done even half this well.\n\nDisclosure time: I paid $15 less for the Plat SHM-CD than I did for my 38XB 10 track, $5 less than my 38XB 11 track, just about the same price as my D32Y, $20 more than my D33Y [I got a great price], if one accounts for inflation $7.25 less than I paid for the MFSL 21+ years ago, and finally $20-30 more than I paid for the \"stock\" discs. I mention this to show I have no financial agenda. I only care about the sound when I give my opinions and do not try to justify an expense or look to boost the price of a rare Japan 1st press.\n\nMy Digital Synchronicity Review/Opinions:\n\n1) Platinum SHM-CD by a nose [see full review above] over 2 and 2a. While readily available it still runs around $35US so it is not an inexpensive disc. For those that are not big fans of the band or the album then 2, 2a, and 4 on this list will probably serve you just fine. Please note that depending on gear you may not get results than I did.\n\n2) 38XB 10 track [blue column] - Although I think it's a slight bit better it is not worth the money [sonically speaking] over the 11 track mastering. Especially since \"Murder By Numbers\" is missing.\n\nPlease note: the 38XB 10 track contains pre-emphasis. Although most CD transports adhere to the Redbook standard some recent players do not. Computer based playback also is generally unable to decode the pre-emphasis. You will not get great sound from the 10-track if the pre-emph is not decoded, so if you have gear that is unable to do that go with the 38XB 11 track instead.\n\nFinally if you are an early CD collector or an Huge Police CD collector [like me], regardless of whether you can decode the pre-emph or not, this rare disc is still a \"must have\" and ranks as the #1 Synchronicity CD collectible\n\n2a) 38XB 11 track [yellow column] based mastering. The Japan for US Sony 3x CSR version sounds exactly the same [because it is] as the Japan for Japan 38XB. The Japan for US 3x CSR with luck can be found for under $10US as most never know it's different from the normal Japan for US \"stock CD's\" in the black column. In addition if you can not decode pre-emphasis, sonically speaking, this CD becomes 2 instead of 2a.\n\n3) \"Original\" or \"stock CD\" [black Column] - great sounding discs many of the pressings of this mastering listed can be found for under $10US, all sound the same [since they are] to me - easily the best value of any Digital Synchronicity\n\n4) D32Y/D33Y Japan CD's [red column] - Nice sounding discs that are possibly better than the stock disc to some listeners\n\n5) MFSL - a really nice sounding disc, although at times I think it lacks \"focus\". Bottom line; not worth the money compared to the black column discs.\n\n6) 2003 SACD and 2010 SHM-SACD [AVOID]- same bad mastering and nasty sound, exactly the same level of sonic putrid to me. For Police and SACD collector's only is my feeling, as the sound is bested by at at least 5 other masterings and just not worth $50US or more. In addition I thought the Synchronicity tracks included on the 2003 Greatest Hits SACD also sounded like garbage.\n\n7) 1993 Box Set remaster /1995 remaster [AVOID]- horrid mastering.\n\n8) 2003/2004 CD remaster [AVOID] - also appears on the hybrid SACD's redbook layer a truly vile sounding disc.\n\nI've heard a couple of one minute clips of the MFSL version, and Sting's vocals seem burried or muddy, I instead got the Japan for US CD and it has amazed me."
