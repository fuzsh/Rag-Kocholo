Rhodes serves on boards for the Christian Leadership Alliance, the international fundraising think tank Rogare, the values-based crowdfunding site Gifted Coin, and on the board of his home church.\n\nDusty’s new contact information is 720-460-8877 and Dusty@ElevationGrowth.com\n\nColorado Springs-based Elevation Growth Partners has helped over 400 organizations raise an estimated $600 million dollars over its 15 year history.
