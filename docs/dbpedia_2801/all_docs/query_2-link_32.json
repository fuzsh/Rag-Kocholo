        "text": "The Research Network connects the Danish universities and research institutions directly with each other, with the other research networks in the world and with the Internet in general. This means that there are a number of advantages to using the research network over a regular connection with a commercial internet provider.\n\nSurplus capacity\n\nLow delay\n\nGuarantee of quality to the end\n\nInternational cooperation\n\nPlatform for testing, development and co-ownership\n\nAccess to services\n\nSurplus capacity\n\nCommercial network providers optimize their infrastructure in order to utilize equipment and lines as efficiently as possible, and one of the tools is overbooking in their backbone network. It is perfectly fine, and quite necessary to succeed in the competition between the providers.\n\nAt the research network, our network is designed according to other criteria: If a research project suddenly needs to transfer large amounts of data in a short time, there must be room for it. For us, a sudden doubling of traffic from 3- to 6Gbps is not a DoS attack, but part of a daily reality. There must be room for that.\n\nTherefore, if you have a connection of 10Gbps, you do not share the capacity in the backbone with other users. There is 10Gbps all the way, always!\n\nLow delay\n\nThe light moves by approx. 200,000km/s in fiber optics. The more convoluted roads the traffic is sent and the more pieces of network equipment it passes, the greater the delay.\n\nIn its network design, the research network is optimized to achieve the shortest possible delay with the most direct roads and the least possible equipment on the paths.\n\nIn a local and national context, this means that it may for instance may make sense to have mirrored disk systems further apart than with traditional network solutions, and at the international level, for instance musicians in Copenhagen perform live with musicians in Prague or New York, where video and audio are transmitted over high-bandwidth and low-delay connections - something that cannot be achieved in the same way with commercial networks.\n\nGuarantee of quality end-to-end\n\nWhen you buy a traditional internet connection, you can usually get a guarantee for the bandwidth and quality of service in the provider's own network, but there is no guarantee for what it looks like the rest of the way out to those you communicate with.\n\nThe research network, on the other hand, sees it as its task to ensure quality all the way to the other end, both on the routed internet and dedicated point-to-point connection. Both in Denmark and internationally.\n\nInternational cooperation\n\nThe construction with a special network for research and educational institutions is widespread in most of the world.Through organizations such as NORDUnet and GÃ‰ANT, DeiC collaborates with similar national research networks and international superstructures.\n\nEnsuring quality and bandwidth for international connections, and otherwise cooperation on a number of services internationally, is possible by this international cooperation.\n\nPlatform for testing, development and co-ownership\n\nAs DeiC operates the research network hands on, we can give researchers access to the equipment. This allows researchers in IT and network technology to test theories and perform experiments on parts of the infrastructure. It is completely unique to the research network that users can be allowed to touch the infrastructure in this way.\n\nWhen you join the research network, you also become part of a community where you can influence development. The research network is designed for you and your needs, which means that you can be heard and can tell what provides value for you and your institution.\n\nAccess to services\n\nWhen you join the research network, it also opens up a whole world of services that are developed to support research and teaching.\n\nAn example is the eduroam service, which allows students and staff in the education sector to log in to all wireless networks involved in the collaboration. But you can also use services in information security, storage, video conferencing and much more.\n\nContact us"
