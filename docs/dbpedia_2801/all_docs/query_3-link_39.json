Time to dive in!” —Chloe Malle, Editor, Vogue.com\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Ultimate T-Shirt\n\n“I recently stocked up on some new T-shirts from Madewell and they are amazing. In fact, they are so great that I bought both of the below styles in black and white and in multiple sizes (I wear a T-shirt and jeans every day of the week and am particular about having the perfect fit!). The shrunken tee has a worn-in feel while the cotton crewneck tee is more polished and stays crisp all day.” —Mai Morsch, editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Perfect Little Clutch\n\n“Realizing I owned zero evening clutches, I jumped on The Row’s Mel style the day it became available. (Knowing how fast The Row bags move, I didn’t want to miss this one!) New in for pre-fall, it’s perfect for weddings and dinners.” —Talia Abbas, senior shopping editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Dress and Sneakers Combo\n\n“I finally succumbed to the Dôen hype I hear around the office and picked up this stunning black puff-sleeve maxi dress. I was on the hunt for a versatile piece that could transition into fall, and this dress fits the bill perfectly—whether paired with kitten heels, boots, or sneakers, there are endless styling options. Additionally, with a trip to Spain coming up at the end of this month, I decided I needed (read: wanted) a new pair of comfortable sneakers for long days of sightseeing (read: tapas and sangria-drinking). I chose these Onitsuka Tigers which are neutral enough to pair with any outfit while adding a fun little pop of color with the stripe detail.” —Sam Ravin, associate manager, social and creative\n\nShop more:\n\nThe End-of-Summer Essentials\n\n“I recently got this pair of Margaux platforms and I am floored by how comfortable they are—truly. They’re high and shiny and you can dance all night in them; the perfect party shoe! They’re my new personality. I’ve also been searching for the perfect tank top for ages, and at last, I found it. This Another Tomorrow tank is incredibly soft, has a great slim fit, and goes with everything. I’ll be living in it for the rest of the summer.” —Leah Faye Cooper, digital style director\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Drop-Waist Dress\n\n“The drop-waist silhouette has been one of my favorite summer trends, especially in a color-contrasting option. I recently skimmed through resident fashion writer Laura Jackson’s under $300 edit, and knew I couldn’t pass up this dress. The price point! The crisp cotton! It ticks every box, and is easily my new favorite piece.” —Clarissa Schmidt, marketing & production manager\n\nShop More:\n\nThe Gingham Maxidress\n\n“Earlier last month, I co-chaired The Parrish Art Museum’s Midsummer Festivities and needed something fabulous to wear. But dressing for a gala in a beach town is always a tricky thing to do—Watermill is, after all, a beach town! Upon seeing this strapless Bernadette midi, my dress-search was immediately over. The gingham print says easy-breezy Hamptons, while the taffeta material says gala-ready. Plus, it paired perfectly with my vintage wicker bag.” —Lilah Ramzi, contributor\n\nShop More:\n\nThe Romantic Staples\n\n“I feel delightfully sweet and stylish in this dress. The fabric is so lightweight and airy, it’s perfect for running around town—and it looks equally as good with a pair of sneakers, oxfords, or heels. I was recently introduced to Coucou Intimate’s basics at a Glossier event. As somebody who prefers to sleep in a top with... well, top support, I love the cotton tanks and bras. Pretty and functional.” —Margaux Anbouba, senior beauty and wellness editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Warm-Weather Uniform\n\n“Walking on the streets of New York at the moment is like going through a sauna every day. I’m seeking lightweight comfort in everything I wear or carry. I recently picked up a pair of adorable black satin Proenza ballet flats—they give me the nostalgia for my childhood ballerina days, all while collecting daily compliments from colleagues. Next up is my bag…I’ve been in the market for a ludicrously capacious summer tote to toss my laptop in, and an open-weave knit style seemed like the perfect fit. While on the subject of knots and knits—this one-shoulder knit tank is my favorite addition to my growing capsule collection.” —Conçetta Ciarlo, events associate manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Heritage Swim\n\n“While on a recent European vacation, I made the executive decision that it was finally time to invest in a Missoni bikini. After trying on a few styles at the Bodrum boutique, I landed on this triangle suit adorned with the brand’s signature zig-zags. Now, I just need a matching sarong or headscarf to make this bikini beach club-ready.” —Eliseé Browchuk, head of events and marketing, experiences\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Poplin Boxer Short\n\n“Inspired by Vogue Shopping’s recent boxer short edit, I decided to purchase a pair of my own! New York City has been sweltering this summer, and these boxer shorts are the perfect way to easily and comfortably beat the heat. Plus, they’re so fun to style with warm-weather accessories. I’ve been influenced by the article to pair them with a straw hat, a raffia bag, and flats.”—Alexandra Ditch, associate commerce producer\n\nShop more:\n\nVacation Flip-Flop\n\n’Tis the season to be jolly (at least for those of us submerged in the world of fashion all year round), as August is to summer what December is to winter. Though lacking in holidays, the rare slow pace of the latter month of summer offers weeks of much needed rest, time away with family and friends, and summer getaways before the storm that is fashion month. Ahead of August travels, Calpak’s Ambeur carry-on luggage and classic Tkees’s classic flip-flops were quickly added and even more quickly checked out of my July shopping cart.” —Ciarra Lorren Zatorski, fashion editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Elegant Poolside Attire\n\n“In July, as the sun shone brighter and the days stretched longer, I made two fabulous additions to my beach wardrobe. First up, the perfect swimsuit for sun-soaked days: a stunning one-shoulder bikini by Angelys Balek, a Phuket-based designer known for her playful yet sophisticated beachwear. The single-shoulder top channels ’70s styling, while the twisted cut-out adds a modern touch. But my summer shopping spree didn’t stop there. To complement my new bikini, I turned to the house of Missoni for a pair of its signature and oh-so-chic zigzag shorts, which are also lightweight and breezy for the upcoming dog days of August. Together, these two purchases have become my go-to uniform for sunny beach and pool days.” —Sasha Pinto, experiences manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Beachside Florals\n\n“This month, I finally invested in a nice pouch to carry all of my summer essentials—keys, wallet, sunscreen, lip gloss, etc. For those constantly on the go like myself, this accessory is bound to keep you both organized and stylish. The best part? Vera Bradley’s prints can easily complement your next beachwear look. I recently picked up a few swimsuits from Blackbough that I am keeping in rotation all summer long.” —Taylor Anderson, associate manager, social media\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Lightweight LBD\n\n“I’d be lost without an LBD in my wardrobe. Over the last few weeks, I’ve found that I haven’t stopped grabbing for this slip dress from Cou Cou Intimates. It’s lightweight enough to keep me comfortable in the New York City heat and the lace trim is a subtle but cute detail.” —Taylor Lashley, manager, social media\n\nThe Tennis Bracelet\n\n“In these hot New York City temperatures, jewelry has been making me feel weirdly claustrophobic? I am waiting until the fall to pull out my chunky layered necklaces and bangle stack accessories. But for now, I’ll be wearing his Ring Concierge tennis bracelet that serves a delicious sparkle and feels lightweight on the wrist. This timeless design is my new year-round staple, and my great-great-great-granddaughters will hopefully enjoy it, too.” —Lea Donenberg, associate producer\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Tennis Whites\n\n“It’s been a few years since I last purchased a new workout sneaker, so I’ve been meaning to pick up a new pair for a while now. So, to Bloomingdale’s I went. After trying on a few styles I had been eyeing, I went with the On Cloudtilt sneakers. Zendaya-approved, incredibly cushiony but somehow lightweight, these are ultra-comfortable to wear on a long walk or to play tennis. Speaking of, Lululemon’s pleated tennis skirt has become my go-to for my on-going lessons.” —Kiana Murden, senior beauty writer\n\nShop more:\n\nIn case you missed it, see what Vogue editors purchased in June.\n\nThe Beachwear Classics\n\n“After adding two pairs of elevated leather flip flops to my summer footwear rotation this season, I thought it was time to add a more beach-friendly version to take on vacation in July. Havaiana’s rubber pairs are a classic and ring in at $30—a no brainer! And after lusting after The Row's perfect red silk button down, I settled on an affordable option from Banana Republic to get the look for summer.” —Madeline Fass, senior shopping market editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Striped Boxer Shorts\n\n“Boxer shorts are in their chic era! Perfect for staying cool in the summer heat, I bought this pinstripe pair from Aritzia on a whim but have been wearing it nonstop—to the supermarket, to the beach, to bed, anything goes!” —Talia Abbas, senior shopping editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Denim Maxiskirt\n\n“After a full twelve months of humming and hawing over the long denim skirt trend I finally caved for this cargo green one from Ulla Johnson (currently on sale, you’re welcome!). Don’t sleep on Johnson’s denim, co-created by the denim whisperer (Benjamin Talley Smith): it’s excellently cut, and sturdy without being restrictive. So far I've been pairing this high-waisted skirt with T-shirts or crisp button-downs, sandals, and plenty gold jewelry (love the gold button detail!) and I'm looking forward to mixing it into the fall mix with high boots and knits of all weights.” —Daisy Shaw-Ellis, jewelry director\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Matching Linen Set\n\n“Whether you’re enjoying summer at home or abroad, linen is always a great choice. This two-piece ensemble from Tuckernuck is an ideal warm-weather essential. The elevated details like the mandarin collar and flared sleeves add sophistication, while the comfortable fit makes it perfect for everyday wear. I chose the black colorway because it goes with everything, but I’m already eyeing the tan tone for my next purchase.” —Eliseé Browchuk, experiences production and marketing manager\n\nShop more linen pieces:\n\nThe Sleeveless Midi Dress\n\n“I prefer dresses and skirts to pants and promptly added this one to my collection when I saw it. I love the draping and that it’s form-fitting without being skin-tight. And that cherry red color? Beyond.” —Leah Faye Cooper, digital style director\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Summer Office Uniform\n\n“I picked up this Cara Cara sleeveless mididress as I needed a great work-appropriate white dress and it instantly became my favorite style of summer 2024. Wearing it to the office for the first time, I was stopped by three women on my morning commute who wanted to know who made my dress! Buyer’s rejoice indeed!” —Lilah Ramzi, Contributing Editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Dressed-Up Short Shorts\n\n“Add me to the list of ever-growing short-short enthusiasts, along with all of the internet’s favorite heartthrobs. Whoever decided that boxer shorts are fully appropriate to wear out (was it you, Bella Hadid?), please know I love you. These white boxers from Oddli are a regular in my suitcase as I travel this summer and temperatures keep climbing. I like to dress them up with a pair of kitten heels (my go-to micro heels are from Reformation) or lean into casual comfort with my favorite trainers. I sported them all around Paris this summer with my new favorite pair of YSL sunglasses in my desperate pursuit to find an air-conditioned room.” —Conçetta Ciarlo, events associate manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe ’90s-Inspired Shades\n\n“I’m an overpacker and this Libertine x LeSportsac tote bag may be the cure for my affliction. The bold striped pattern is a fashion statement of itself, and the colors match every travel sweat set I own. The bag is so lightweight and durable that I squish it up in my suitcase, so that when I go shopping at my final destination, I’ll have a vessel to bring my treasures back home in. Oh and if you haven’t heard, the name on everyone's lips this summer is Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and I’m determined to channel her timeless elegance in my own wardrobe. Starting from the top down, I’ve sourced these handmade French sunglasses aptly named “The Carolyn” from Selima Optique, to sport all summer long.” —Lea Donenberg, associate producer\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Summer Tie-Dye\n\n“In case you haven’t heard, tie-dye has made a comeback! I recently snagged a couple of fun tie-dye pieces from Proenza Schouler White Label, including this full-length dress. The playful print isn’t the only thing that makes it a summer staple, though—the soft, stretchy fabric and sleeveless silhouette make it an easy, breezy choice for hot days. The best part: it can easily be dressed up with jewelry and heeled sandals, or dressed down with ballet flats or white sneakers.” —Alexandra Ditch, associate commerce producer\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Retro-Inspired Mini\n\n“Leave it to Tory Burch to make you feel stunning in absolutely everything—even if it is just a simple LBD. The viscose knit dress is the best dress for the summer, light and airy but with a bit of dimension with the hoop detailing that was all the rage at the Tory Burch spring 2024 shows.” —Irene Kim, production and editorial coordinator, Vogue Runway\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Polka Dot Ruffle Maxi\n\n“I recently picked up this adorable polka-dot maxi for an upcoming trip, and in my opinion, it is an absolute gem for those breezy vacation nights. The ruching and delicate ruffles add a touch of whimsical charm and the cutout detail keeps it fun for a night out.”—Sam Ravin, creative development senior associate\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Summer Wardrobe Staples\n\n“In June, I officially hopped on the jort train. I picked up this pair from SER.O.YA earlier in the month and I now find myself grabbing for them more than I would like to admit. When I'm not wearing my new favorite shorts, I am usually in a dress and this one from The Garment via The Frankie Shop is a recent favorite. It can be worn as a coverup to the beach or out at night with some chunky jewelry and a strappy sandal.” —Taylor Lashley, social media manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Airy Cotton Maxi Dress\n\n“I bought this airy, cotton Malene Birger dress during what I thought was a heatwave—but turns out just to be the sweltering normal for New York City summer! Consider it your go-to-dress for any day over 85 degrees.” —Elise Taylor, senior living writer\n\nShop more:\n\nIn case you missed it, see what Vogue editors purchased in May.\n\nThe Designer Collab\n\n“Each season I feel like I have to size up clothes for my kids so now that summer is here I recently purchased kids shorts and short sleeve PJ sets for my kids. I also went wild with the Gap x Dôen collaboration but it will probably be sold out again by the time this post goes live!” —Chloe Malle, Editor, Vogue.com\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Versatile Statement Necklace\n\n“While many are busy preparing for summer vacations under the sun, my focus has been fixated on finding the perfect investment piece. I was looking for a gold statement necklace that could elevate an everyday white T-shirt and add something unexpected to a little black dress for a special evening out. When I discovered IVI Los Angeles, a contemporary jewelry brand by Ivi Kyratzi, I knew her timeless approach to design was exactly my vibe, and fell in love with the Gaia necklace. Worn with a one-piece and a cover-up to a beach day-turned-happy hour or a pair of jeans to the office, the versatility of this necklace is limitless.” —Eliseé Browchuk, experiences production and marketing manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Lightweight White Co-Ords\n\n“My favorite summer looks are all-white looks, and for my seasonal upgrade I wanted to add some new silhouettes and textures to the mix. I needed to have this poplin Matteau skirt the moment it landed on NAP (it has a very The Row vibe to it!) and wanted to pair it with something unexpected but still tonal. I fell in love with this summer knit tank from Rohé, which is even better in person. It’s not cut too deep from the side and looks so good with linen trousers and this other pleated midiskirt I got from Vince as well.” —Talia Abbas, senior shopping editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Pajama Pant Trend\n\n“I'm really into the stripe pajama pant trend right now especially for summer travel and beach days and I found these men's pairs from Gap that fit the bill perfectly! I bought two pairs during their Memorial Day sale, luckily they're still marked down at $20. I'm excited to wear them everything from button-downs to bikinis!” —Madeline Fass, senior shopping market editor\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Floral Maxi\n\n“I bought this Dôen dress as an addition to my summer dress rotation. It's such a flattering silhouette and the liberty print isn't too nostalgic or small to make it saccharine. So far I've worn it to the office and to a fancy cocktail event and happy to report it gets a good share of compliments! —Daisy Shaw-Ellis, Jewelry Director\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Cropped Button-Down\n\n“I'm now the proud owner of not one, but two of TWP's \"Next Ex\" shirts. The second was bought after I realized just how versatile the cropped button-down was in my closet. I find myself wearing it once or twice a week with everything from jeans to midiskirts.” —Elise Taylor, Senior Living Writer\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Mermaid Pearls\n\n“My favorite May purchase is this gorgeous pearl necklace from Galley Jewelry. I am forever obsessed with anything with shells and this necklace is perfect for any summer outfit, I feel like I'm carrying the beach with me wherever I go.” —Sam Sussman, Creative Development and Programming Senior Director\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Summer Denim\n\n“Anyone who knows me well enough will know that Dôen is my favorite brand. This month they collabed with Gap for a small capsule collection and I almost bought everything. My favorites include the wide-leg pants that come in a light khaki and denim fabric that’s going to be perfect for the summer because I will never give up on wearing long pants no matter how hot it gets! On the topic of pants I have also been exploring shorter lengths with a pair of capri jeggings from Rag & Bone (although I’m not completely sold yet on the concept).” —Irene Kim, production and editorial coordinator, Vogue Runway\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Challengers Enthusiast Trainer\n\n“Heading into tennis season, I realized I was well overdue for a shoe refresh, so I went with a classic pair of Wilson’s. I still might not be able to go pro (or make the A level tournament, for that matter), but I certainly will be able to look the part in these. Also I am available for auditions for Challengers 2: Re-Challenged, if anyone was wondering.” —Lucy Dolan-Zalaznick, creative development senior associate\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Ribbed Tank\n\n“New York City pedestrian essentials: I walk to the office every so-hot-summer morning in a ribbed tank and then style whatever else I’m in the mood for right on top and somehow it makes everything look better. Splits59 has the softest, bounciest rib fabric I’ve found so far although I also like the WSLY ones for a semi-sheer look if you dare.” —Arden Fanning Andrews, Beauty Editor at Large\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Matching Workout Set\n\n“I frequent my local Pure Barre most days and noticed everyone wearing these leggings with a neon green/yellow logo. It took me (embarrassingly) too long to figure out it was the Aritzia Activewear brand. I am very much my father's daughter (I am very sweaty). Due to this horrible affliction, I am usually an only-work-out-in-black type of girl. However, I was feeling reckless and—for my first purchase from this line—bought a light gray set. I never believe when fabrics call themselves sweat-wicking, but these really are. I'm now showing up to all my Pure Barre classes in different colors and in the same style. I'm almost as obsessed with them as with Pure Barre, but it's a close second. ” —Sache Taylor, Events Manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Monochrome Minimalist\n\n“I’ve recently come to terms with the fact that I’m a Staud-aholic, and I fully indulged this impulse during the It-girl brand’s Memorial Day weekend sale…whoops! In my defense, it was like smart shopping (and timing) to add some more sleek Staud pieces to my wardrobe. I love wearing black and white because it pairs well with absolutely everything—especially my funky printed vintage finds.” —Conçetta Ciarlo, events associate manager\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Trendy Sneaker\n\n“I caved. Just when I thought I was done lusting after (and buying) Wales Bonner’s Adidas collab pieces, she dropped what might be my favorite offering yet: a more pared-back, cream version with cobalt blue croc stripes. They'll definitely be my go-to sneaker this summer, in and out of the office. Long live the Samba—as long as WB has a hand in it.” —Madeleine Schulz, Vogue Business Reporter\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Whimsical Hand-Woven Bag\n\n“Picture this: Me, at the Union Square Farmers’ Market. It's a Saturday, and my white peasant dress is just grazing the ground as I weave through the tents. Maybe I'm looking for artisanal honey, or perhaps a carton of eggs. One thing is for sure: I will be buying bouquets of flowers—and this Sezane tote bag is the perfect vessel for all my goodies. I am coveting this piece and I think Jeremy Allen White should grab one for his summertime farmers market runs too.” —Lea Donenberg, associate producer\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Cool-Girl Comfort Basics\n\n“Now that the days are longer and it stays light out later into the evening, I've been embracing after-work walks. Naturally, this meant I needed a new pair of sneakers for the occasion. I wanted something chunky and sporty, so I landed on these Asics—and I'm loving them. I've also been itching to get in on the long shorts trend (if you told me four years ago I'd say this, I wouldn't believe you). To add to my weekend wardrobe, I went with these effortlessly cool Agolde denim shorts. I'm looking forward to pairing them with an oversized tee and some ballet flats.” —Sam Ravin, creative development senior associate\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Y2K Nostalgic Jewelry\n\n“Last year in a bid to feel alive, electric, and slightly reckless, I got my navel pierced. This month while shopping for accessories, I upgraded to a sparkly, dangly navel ring. I'm inspired by the many belly-pierced greats around me like Tyla, Dua Lipa, and Megan Thee Stallion who have helped revive the early-aughts trend. Take this as a sign to rock some form of fun, decorative jewelry on your own this summer, whether it be an anklet, new earrings, or yes—even a belly ring.” —Maya Layne, entertainment associate\n\nShop more:\n\nThe Denim Jumpsuit\n\n“I recently purchased Good American’s ‘Fit for Success’ jumpsuit, and every time I slip into it, I feel that it lives up to its name. It has quickly become one of my favorite wardrobe staples. The denim is equal parts soft and stretchy, making it super easy to wear to the office, to run errands around the city, or for anything in between. As a proud outfit repeater, I know I’ll be wearing this all year round, styled with a white turtleneck underneath in the colder months. But for the spring and summer, it’s the perfect one-and-done outfit.” —Alexandra Ditch, associate commerce producer\n\nShop more:"
