Check it out on YouTube (below) or on any podcast network: https://lnkd.in/gAYgC68M Come join our community, which is deep in their own conversations about this on all social platforms: @wearemanenough ICYMI on Friday: After the release of the Max docuseries, ‚ÄúQuiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,‚Äù actor and musician Drake Bell reached out to us, expressing interest in coming onto the show to discuss his sexual assault as a child while employed by Nickelodeon, allegations against him as an adult, and their impact on him as a man. What an honor for Man Enough to be seen as the right place to get vulnerable and open up about these challenging experiences, as well as the place to take accountability for his own mistakes. This is the type of openness that helps others to do the same. Man Enough Podcast hosts Justin Baldoni, Jamey Heath and Liz Plank brought empathy and also discuss the need for Drake to take accountability for his own actions, delving into his truths and the personal resolve to mend the broken pieces. So grateful for the amazing team at Wayfarer Studios: Ashmi Elizabeth D., M√©riem Dehbi-Talbot, Briana Punwasi, and Susie Landers O'Connell, as well as our partners at JONESWORKS and NO MORE. Thanks also to Justin Crawford and Drake's team."
