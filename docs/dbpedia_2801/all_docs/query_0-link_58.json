        "text": "When heavy rainfall caused landslides that forced the closure of Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes last week, congregants and couples with upcoming weddings weren’t the only ones affected. The indefinite closure also blocked public access to one of L.A.’s most iconic buildings.\n\nL.A. County is home to 23 National Historic Landmarks, according to the National Park Service. Dubbed the “most Instagrammable chapel in L.A” by the Los Angeles Times, Wayfarers Chapel became the newest addition to that list in December 2023.\n\n“It's the highest level of recognition that you can achieve in historic preservation,” said Los Angeles Conservancy President Adrian Scott Fine. “The fact that this building met the criteria and has achieved that status really does speak to how special it really is.”\n\nWayfarers is currently in the midst of a $250,000 GoFundMe campaign. Chapel leadership says the money will be used to refund couples with canceled weddings, and to begin the expensive repairs needed to eventually reopen the facilities.\n\nSo, why is Wayfarers Chapel such a gem of L.A. architectural heritage? Read on to discover more about the chapel’s history and ongoing significance.\n\nThe mid-century origins of Wayfarers Chapel\n\nWayfarers Chapel was built at the behest of the Swedenborgian Church of North America, a small denomination inspired by 18th century Swedish theologian and scientist Emanuel Swedenborg. The church emphasizes an infinitely loving god and personal freedom in matters of belief.\n\nSwedenborgian church members Elizabeth Sewall Schellenberg and Narcissa Cox Vanderlip approached architect Lloyd Wright to fulfill their vision of a small church overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\nConstruction began in 1949 and the church was opened in 1951.\n\nA shining example of Organic Modern architecture\n\nUpon entering the chapel, visitors are immediately struck by the large glass facade. The building’s high, transparent walls gaze out toward the serene Redwood grove surrounding the property.\n\nRedwood beams are used to hold geometric panes of glass in place. And local Palos Verdes stones were used to make the church’s sanctuary.\n\nThis blending of natural beauty and built space epitomizes a school of architecture known as Organic Modern, Fine said.\n\n“It's very much the connection between indoors and outdoors,” he said. “That's kind of the beauty and the magic of the space. What Lloyd Wright created here, it does feel like it's part of nature — but also something that was created.”\n\nA famed architect’s son, famous in his own Wright\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright is one of history’s most well known architects. But his son Lloyd Wright also has a claim to architectural fame — especially when it comes to iconic 20th century Southern California designs.\n\nLloyd Wright left his mark on L.A. through visually striking projects like the John Sowden House in Los Feliz (also known as the “Jaws House” for its jagged facade resembling a shark’s gaping maw).\n\nHe also designed a pyramid-shaped shell for the Hollywood Bowl in 1927, which was deemed “too modern” by management. The next year, he tried another swooping design that could be put up and taken down within a day. But it was soon replaced by the venue’s more familiar semi-circular shell.\n\nLloyd Wright’s work as an independent architect continued from the 1920s through the 1960s. Wayfarer Chapel represents one of his later masterpieces, first opened to the public when he was in his early 60s. He died in 1978 at the age of 88.\n\nThe future of historic preservation in a changing L.A. climate\n\nThis isn’t the first time the chapel’s facilities have been affected by landslides. In 1995, the chapel’s original visitors center was removed due to extensive damage caused by land movement, according to the church’s website. A new visitors center opened in 2001.\n\nBut as California weather becomes more erratic in a world shaped by climate change, experts say churches and other organizations will need to prepare for more investment in preservation.\n\n“Most places are behind the curve in terms of doing the kind of thoughtful planning about what climate change means to our historic buildings,” said Fine with the L.A. Conservancy. “How do you adapt? How do you retrofit? And how do you come up with the funding to make it happen?”\n\nHe added that Wayfarers Chapel has one clear advantage: it’s a beloved building, not just in L.A., but throughout the world.\n\n“People know of this place,” Fine said. “So I hope people do step up to support it, because it really does need it at this point to ensure it survives.”"
