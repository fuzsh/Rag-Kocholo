        "text": "Update on June 15, 2023 at 10:00AM PT:\n\nToday we‚Äôre expanding Instagram broadcast channels globally, giving millions of creators a new way to directly engage with their followers at scale in real time. As we‚Äôve expanded broadcast channels in the US, accounts like @armaniblanco and @justmaiko have seen unparalleled engagement from fans whether they‚Äôre sharing sneak peeks of upcoming content, asking for feedback via polls and sharing candid moments via voice notes. We‚Äôre excited to see what creators around the world do with broadcast channels.\n\nWe‚Äôre also sharing updates on new and upcoming features aimed at making broadcast channels even more fun and interactive:\n\nWe‚Äôre testing additional features such as the ability for creators to use question prompts to gather feedback and responses from followers and a dedicated channels tab in the inbox so people can easily access their joined channels and discover new ones.\n\nCollaborators enables creators to invite other creators (or fans) to participate in their broadcast channel. Whether it‚Äôs an expert interview or a casual hangout, fans can now follow conversations between their favorite creators and their special guests.\n\nLastly, we‚Äôre exploring new controls to help creators manage and promote their broadcast channels, like setting an expiration date and time on their channel, adding a moderator to help manage members, messages and content and sharing a link or even a preview to Stories to encourage followers to join.\n\nOriginally published on February 16, 2023 at 10:15AM PT:\n\nToday, Mark Zuckerberg introduced broadcast channels on Instagram with his own ‚ÄúMeta Channel üì¢‚Äù. Broadcast channels are a public one-to-many messaging tool that creators can invite all of their followers into and share text, video and photo updates.\n\nCreators can also use voice notes to share their latest updates and behind-the-scenes moments, and even create polls to crowdsource fan feedback. Only creators can send messages in broadcast channels, while followers can react to content and vote in polls.\n\nMore features will be added to broadcast channels in the coming months, like the ability to bring another creator into the channel to discuss upcoming collabs, crowdsource questions for an ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù and more.\n\nCheck Out Who‚Äôs Using Broadcast Channels\n\nThe following creators are starting their broadcast channels today. Head to their profiles and tap the link in their bios (accessible via mobile only):\n\nAustin Sprinz: Content creator (@austin_sprinz)\n\nChloe Kim: Two-time Olympic gold medalist snowboarder (@chloekim)\n\nDavid Allen: Content creator (@ToTouchanEmu)\n\nFaZe Rug: Content creator (@fazerug)\n\nFlau‚Äôjae: Basketball and rap star (@flaujae)\n\nGilbert Burns: Mixed martial artist (@gilbert_burns)\n\nJosh Richards: Media personality and entrepreneur (@joshrichards)\n\nKaren Cheng: Creative director (@karenxcheng)\n\nKatie Feeney: Content creator (@katiefeeneyy)\n\nLonnie IIV: Digital creator (@LonnieIIV)\n\nMackenzie Dern: Jiu-jitsu black belt UFC fighter (@mackenziedern)\n\nMikaela Shiffrin: Winningest woman alpine skier of all time (@mikaelashiffrin)\n\nTank Sinatra: Meme sensation (@tank.sinatra)\n\nValkyrae:Creator and streamer (@valkyrae)\n\nHow Do Broadcast Channels Work?\n\nOnce a creator gets access to broadcast channels and sends the first message from their Instagram inbox, their followers will receive a one-time notification to join the channel. Anyone can discover the broadcast channel and view the content, but only followers who join the channel will receive notifications whenever there are updates.\n\nFollowers can leave or mute broadcast channels at any time and can also control their notifications from creators by going to a creator‚Äôs profile, tapping the bell icon and selecting ‚Äúbroadcast channel.‚Äù\n\nNotifications will default to ‚Äúsome,‚Äù but this setting can be changed to ‚Äúall‚Äù or ‚Äúnone.‚Äù Other than the invitation notification, followers will not get any other notifications about a broadcast channel unless they add the channel to their inbox. Once a channel is added to their inbox, it will appear among other message threads, and notifications will be turned on and function like any other chat.\n\nAs soon as the broadcast channel is live, creators can also encourage their followers to join by using the ‚Äújoin channel‚Äù sticker in Stories or by pinning the channel link to their profile (coming soon).\n\nHere‚Äôs how to join a broadcast channel:\n\nAccess the broadcast channel link via a creator‚Äôs Story sticker, the link pinned to their Instagram profile or, as an existing follower, a one-time notification sent when a creator starts a new channel.\n\nTap ‚ÄúJoin broadcast channel.‚Äù People who are not yet following the creator will be prompted to do so.\n\nAfter joining the channel, followers can react to content and vote in polls, but cannot send messages. They can also share a link to their favorite creators‚Äô broadcast channels so friends can follow and join.\n\nCreators with Subscriptions who want to create a broadcast channel that‚Äôs open to all of their followers need to set the channel‚Äôs audience to ‚Äúall followers.‚Äù There‚Äôs also the option to create a broadcast channel limited to paid subscribers for more exclusive content.\n\nGetting Early Access\n\nWe‚Äôre currently testing broadcast channels with a handful of creators in the US and plan to expand in the coming months. Creators who are interested can sign up to be considered for early access by accessing the waitlist on their mobile device.\n\nSpots are limited and we will be providing early access on a rolling basis. While we are first introducing this new feature to Instagram, we‚Äôll be testing broadcast channels in Messenger and on Facebook in the coming months.\n\nPrivacy and Safety\n\nBroadcast channels are subject to Instagram‚Äôs Community Guidelines so people can feel safe and welcome being a part of them. People can report both a broadcast channel itself or specific content shared in the channel, which can be removed if it goes against our policies.\n\nBroadcast channels are also public and discoverable chat experiences, so they‚Äôre treated differently than private messaging on Instagram. We have tools and reviewers to help us identify, review or remove content in broadcast channels that may violate our Community Guidelines ‚Äî often before anyone sees it."
