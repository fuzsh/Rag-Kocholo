        "text": "WMB-FM (97.1 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Chicago, Illinois and serves the Chicago metropolitan area. WMB-FM is owned by Centraudio, Inc. and serves as the full-time FM simulcast of News outlet WMB (AM). WMB-FM's studios are located at Two Prudential Plaza in the Chicago Loop.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Years[]\n\nWMB-FM signed on the air as WZNN, licensed to Zion, in June of 1987 with an AAA format. WZNN was owned by Patrick Davidson (born on September 13, 1961) and was branded as \"The Café 97.\" The station had a small audience and was originally meant to be a local station serving just Zion, and the immediate surrounding area, but with 49,530 watts, WZNN could (with a bit of a fringe signal) also reach the large metropolitan area of Chicago.\n\nLite Rock 97.1[]\n\nOn May 4, 1994, Davidson flipped WZNN to Soft Rock branded as \"Lite Rock 97.1.\" The last song on \"The Café\" was \"Found Out About You\" by The Gin Blossoms, while the first song on \"Lite Rock\" was \"Lovely Day\" by Bill Withers. Davidson said the following about the format change reasoning, \"WZNN has potential to reach a bigger audience, with a pretty powerful signal, WZNN can be heard in the Chicago metro area. So, I have decided to bring in a format that would better fit the big city lifestyle, and audience, as well as capture the smaller town/more rural audiences. So, after months of developing a hand-crafted playlist of Lite Rock favorites for WZNN, we want you to say hello to the all-new Lite Rock 97.1.\" WZNN gathered a pretty good audience for its transmitter location, but this audience would soon turn back to WCZ-FM when they returned to their previous AC format. It was noted by Davidson that \"Most of WZNN's audience were previous WCZ-FM listeners, who found WZNN to be good enough to fill the gap that WCZ-FM left when they flipped to Hot AC.\" \"Lite Rock\" would not survive much longer, as Davidson would pull the plug in November of 1996 when the station began stunting with Christmas music and promoting something new was coming soon.\n\n97.1 ZCA[]\n\nOn December 26, 1996, after playing \"Last Christmas\" by Wham!, WZNN flipped to Hot AC branded as \"97.1 ZCA\" with the new WZCA callsign. The first song WZCA was \"Wonderwall\" by Oasis, followed by \"Uptown Girl\" by Billy Joel. WZCA got some attention, but not much, and many radio experts were already calling WZCA a \"failed attempt\" as the station wasn't attracting much of an audience.\n\nSale to Space Coast[]\n\nIn 1998, Davidson sold WZCA to Space Coast Radio. Davidson could no longer afford to keep WZCA up and running and was desperate to sell WZCA to whomever he could. Davidson stated that \"Space Coast is unlike other corporate companies out there. Space Coast spreads a very local feel throughout all of the stations they own, and I trust Space Coast and that they will take good care of WZCA, and its staff and management.\"\n\n97.1 The Buzz[]\n\nOn July 3, 1998, Space Coast pulled the plug on the Hot AC format and flipped WZCA to Alternative Rock branded as \"97.1 The Buzz.\" The last song on WZCA was \"In The Air Tonight\" by Phil Collins, and the first song on \"The Buzz\" was \"Shine\" by Collective Soul, followed by \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica, and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana. \"The Buzz\" was considered an oddity, compared to most Alternative Rock stations, as WZCA played a lot of 1980s Classic Hits/Rock mixed in with the 1990s-current Alternative Rock. WZCA would gain a moderate number of listeners under its four-year stint as Alternative Rock \"The Buzz.\"\n\nWZPS simulcast[]\n\nOn January 1, 2002, after playing \"Loser\" by Beck, WZCA flipped to a WZPS simulcast with the new WZPZ calls. The reasoning for the simulcast is because WZPS had a bad signal into the northern Chicago suburbs at the time. WZPS has since moved its transmitter location and no longer has any issues reaching the northern Chicago suburbs.\n\nPlay 97.1[]\n\nWith the aforementioned upgrade of WZPS' signal, Space Coast Radio decided that it was no longer necessary for WZPS to have a simulcast partner, with this decision being made, Space Coast began preparing WZPZ for a format change. This format change would take place on May 14, 2020, at 5pm, with WZPZ becoming an Adult CHR formatted station branded as \"Play 97.1.\" \"Play\" would begin playing 10,000 songs commercial free to help promote the new format. WZPZ would change their call-letters to WPLZ to reflect the change. The first song on \"Play\" was \"Intentions\" (feat. Quavo) by Justin Bieber. (Followed by \"Say So\" by Doja Cat, and \"Give Me Everything\" by Pitbull).\n\n97.1 Chicago[]\n\nOn September 18, 2020, WPLZ shifted to Mainstream CHR branded as \"97.1 Chicago.\" The first song on \"97.1 Chicago\" was \"Bang\" by AJR. (Followed by \"What's Poppin'\" by Jack Harlow, and \"Midnight Sky\" by Miley Cyrus).\n\nSimulcast with WMB[]\n\nOn February 28, 2021, Studio Networks, now Centraudio, Inc., announced the sale of its Milwaukee stations to Space Coast Media, in exchange for WPLZ and WZPS. The FCC approved the sale on April 30th and was finalized on May 10th. The next day, staffers redirected listeners to WMBB. WPLZ continued to air its format until 8AM on May 12th, when it flipped to a simulcast of All-News station WMB (AM). On October 5th, Centraudio applied a construction permit to relocate WPLZ's transmitter to metro Chicago. The change was approved on January 24, 2022. WPLZ's transmitter was moved atop the Aon Center but reduced its ERP to the city grade 8.3 kilowatts. The station changed its call sign to WMB-FM on February 1, 2022."
