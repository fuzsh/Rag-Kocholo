Services may be journal databases, libraries, etc. WAYF is used as a single sign-on system, which means that the system can re-use your data, but only for eight hours or until you close your browser.\n\nHow WAYF works\n\nWAYF communicates with two types of institutions: Service providers and institutions. The service provider, e.g. a research library or an online dictionary, provides a service, and the institution provides information about the user. WAYF provides the technical protocol translations necessary for communication between the two organisations and ensures that each user has consented to the disclosure of personal data.\n\nWAYF and DeiC\n\nWAYF is a service from DeiC. It is financed by the users of the service."
