The first just seemed easiest to manage. The second would be pretty easy, requiring registration of some sort. The third could work too but seems a little less secure to me (but maybe secure enough).\n\nIs there a requirement that a particularly privileged user be able to assert their own identity at such a workstation?\n\nAs for network topology changes, I really like the idea (some day) of requiring authenticated DHCP for all network attachments. That way you get a log of who is at each machine as well as the MAC address, IP address, and potentially the switch port. The same certificate that would support the DHCP authentication could work for the campus ISO/SSO.\n\nDavid\n\n-----\n\nAt 10:19 AM -0500 on 2/8/02, Tom Dopirak wrote:\n\nDavid ,\n\nI think you are saying that the HS and Webiso should have no real part\n\nin determining whether an Origin is a kiosk kind of machine and requires\n\nno user authentication and that either an IP address or a certificate\n\nare sufficient in cooperation with the AA and a directory to give the\n\nmachine whatever entitlements are necessary.\n\nIs there another choice?

This allows their Webiso service to login in a way that\n\ncustomizes the authentication cookies for Kiosk use.

Wasley\n\n[mailto: ]\n\nSent: Thursday, February 07, 2002 1:11 AM\n\nTo: Tom Dopirak; 'Scott Cantor'; 'Shibboleth Design Team'\n\nSubject: Re: Public terminals , libraries , kiosks\n\nWell, actually -- I think the issue is not what the AA says but how\n\nit knows what to say. If you start with the requirement that the\n\nhuman being doesn't have to identify him or her self, then on what\n\nbasis do you assert entitlement?\n\nIt seems to me that the most logical basis is that the workstation is\n\nin the library, or in the computer lab or ... Thus my suggestion of\n\nusing IP address, mapped into a known location.\n\nI would create enterprise directory entries for \"library computer\"\n\nand/or \"computer lab workstation\", etc., and populate them with the\n\nattributes and/or entitlements that are deemed appropriate. Then,\n\nwhen the HS needs to \"understand who the user is\" it can note the IP\n\naddress and simply use that to index the enterprise directory. The\n\nrest is automatic and quite consistent with the SHIB model.\n\nAn alternative might be to place a cert on each such workstation that\n\nhas a Subject name matching the directory entry for the generic type\n\nof user intended. Again, the result is an automatic determination of\n\nentitlement completely consistent with the SHIB model.\n\nHow can we avoid the WAYF step? Clearly the \"portal first\" scenario\n\nwould work here. Perhaps if the WAYF used SSL to talk to the User\n\nand checked the cert to see if the Issuer was recognized, then it\n\n> could go directly to the registered HS. The rest would just work.\n\nDavid\n\n-----\n\nAt 5:54 PM -0500 on 2/6/02, Tom Dopirak wrote:\n\n>All,\n\n>\n\n> I finally went back and read last Decembers thread on how\n\nto support\n\n>library workstations in shibboleth.
