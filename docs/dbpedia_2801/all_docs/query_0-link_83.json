        "text": "Jim Marshall was sitting in his car with his kids listening to a Christian radio station when suddenly 88.1 WAYF cut out and the Howard Stern show started coming through. \"Before I could turn the volume down, there were words on there that terrestrial radio would get a fine for having on,\" Marshall said. Marshall, who is the regional general manager for The Way-affiliated station in West Palm Beach, Florida, said this is a problem that many Christian radio listeners have encountered, and they are not happy about it.\n\n\"When people turn to 88.1 they have an expectation for what they're going to hear, and they are upset when they hear something that's not just different from what they expected, but contrary to what they expected,\" Marshall said.\n\nTed McCall, a broadcast engineer in Greenville, South Carolina, explained that this problem occurs when people subscribing to satellite radio stations buy transmitters that transport satellite signals to their FM radios. Many of these transmitters are more powerful than the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations allow, so the transmissions, meant to be contained within one car, end up overpowering whatever is playing on the same or similar frequency nearby.\n\nThe transmitters, which are used for iPods as well as satellite radio, typically work on the lower end of radio frequencies, the part of the radio bandwidth populated by non-commercial radio stations like National Public Radio and Christian stations.\n\nMcCall said that sometimes when he's driving, the FM modulators (often called \"Part 15\" transmitters, for the section of FCC code regulating the devices) in passing cars repeatedly overpower the station he's listening to.\n\nThe National Association of Broadcasters responded to the situation in mid-February by submitting a request to the FCC for a full recall of the offending devices. The FCC has not yet taken action.\n\n\"We're hopeful that they'll respond to this request,\" said Kris Jones, a spokesperson for the NAB. Jones noted that last year, the NAB asked Sirius and XM to recall some of the offending devices, but the radio services have not acted on the request. Sirius and XM have been drawing increased attention from the FCC following the February announcement of their planned merger.\n\nAccording to Marshall, the bleeding over of satellite radio signals became more intense about a year ago, when Howard Stern moved to Sirius radio and Sirius experienced a surge in subscriptions.\n\nAlthough the problem worsened recently, it still remains a small piece of a larger problem, according to Craig Parshall, senior vice president for the National Religious Broadcasters, which represents Christian TV and radio ministries. The bigger issue at hand is that Microsoft, Google, and other technology companies want to use wireless internet devices in the \"white space\" portion of the airwaves that will be freed up after television goes digital.\n\nThese white spaces are narrow, Parshall said, and it is not yet known if the proposed devices will be able to operate without bleeding over into the stations adjacent to them.\n\nThe FCC requested in December that companies begin submitting prototypes of these devices for testing to determine if they would operate in the designated spectrum or if the signals would interfere with other stations.\n\nAccording to Parshall, any action the NRB might take will depend on the FCC's verdict. If the FCC's regulations, which are still being formulated, do not sufficiently protect TV and radio stations from bleeding signals, the NRB plans to take further action.\n\nIn the meantime, bleeding signals continue to be an annoyance for those listening to stations on the lower end of the FM dial. For some, however, the media attention attracted by this phenomenon has turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Jeff Taylor, general manager of the Christian rock station WAYJ in Fort Meyers, Florida, told Christianity Today that a lot of people will probably tune in to his radio station to see if they can hear Howard Stern. While that may not happen, \"They are going to hear Christian radio, and it might be their first introduction to it if they do,\" he said. \"So I don't mind a bit that they're tuning in, thinking there's an off-chance that they might hear Howard Stern.\"\n\nCopyright Â© 2007 Christianity Today.
