        "text": "** Passing of KNX Vet\n\n“Had the pleasure of working with Boyd Harvey during my tenure at KNX from ’68 – ’75. Although I wasn’t in the news department, during election time I was recruited [as were other non-news people] to help produce one of the election remotes. This particular year I was with Boyd at the Registrar of Voters office downtown. Jim Zaillian, who was news director at the time, called me into his office and told me ‘Your job is to keep Boyd in line, understand?’\n\nI actually didn’t, so Jim filled me in.\n\n‘Boyd has a mouth and I want to make sure we don’t get any obscenities on the air. Before we come to you, I’m calling you and you get Boyd in line. No cursing.’ And believe me, Boyd had a mouth! We actually had a great time on this very boring remote. So what happened all night I’d go down the long hall and get election results and edit the copy with Boyd, then I’d make sure Boyd would switch from his ‘drill instructor’ mouth to his Political Reporter mouth! No foul ups at all. And Jim was so happy!” – Arlen Peters\n\n** KNX Boyd Harvey’s Death\n\n“I keep reading about the deaths of great, legendary former KNXers.\n\nAlthough I was there for just under two years, I feel privileged to have worked at KNX with such incredibly talented pros as Chris Stanley, Michael Ambrosini, Chris Madsen, Larry Van Nuys, Dick Helton, Frank Mottek, Tom Haule, Linda Nunez, Kathy Kiernan and, of course, my boss Ed Pyle!” – Bob Sirkin\n\n** Gary Owens Advice\n\n“Gary Owens, my hero, my inspiration and the man who taught me and a young Tom Irwin aka Shotgun Tom Kelly, two broadcasters the importance of teaching others, paying your knowledge forward and never take any success as a sign you are better than anyone else getting to live their dream.\n\nTommy was 17 and I was 18 when we talked our way into the KMPC studio during his afternoon drive show. We stayed for his entire show and then offered to take us to dinner. I was the one that had the car and my mother told me to never drive outside of San Diego. She never found out what we did. It was worth every minute of being in the presence of a great human. Then to get to work with him was the cherry on the cake of my radio career! It was Fabulous!!” – Jim Duncan\n\n** Gracious Gary\n\n“Belated thanks for the Gary Owens tribute in your fine website.\n\nAs a young community college radio-tv major, I wrote Gary in 1969 asking for an interview for our student fm station. He was most gracious and gave me 30 minutes of his time to answer questions. He then gave me a tour of KMPC and offered career advice. He was a fine gentleman as well as a highlight of the LA radio scene.” – Bruce Tennant, Long Beach\n\n** Paint It Color\n\n“Norm Epstein has MAD SKILLZ! Beautiful.” – Mike Butts\n\n** Epstein the Painter\n\n“Norm Epstein’s paintings are incredible. Very professional.” - Larry McKay\n\n** Cartoons\n\nThe ‘Cat Holding the Gun’ cartoon was absolutely the best!\n\nAs I was facing serious surgery this week it really gave me the laugh I needed!” – Larry Huffman\n\n** Podcasting is Storytelling\n\n“There is a podcaster out of Orcutt, a small-town south of Santa Maria, making waves in the podcast world. His name is Chris Lambert and he does the podcast, Your Own Backyard. The website is yourownbackyardpodcast.com.\n\nThe podcast is a series on the disappearance of Kristin Smart, a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, who went missing in May 1996. She has been gone 23 years and this fellow decided to start a local podcast to help find out what happen to Smart and get possible leads where she might be, dead or alive. There is a prime suspect or person or interest involved in the case named Paul Flores. It appears he is a significant suspect in her disappearance, but because of missteps by local authorities, he has never been charged in her disappearance and murder.\n\nI am sure you have seen news reports over the years about Smart, but the podcast has reignited interest in the case the last year or so. I am not sure if this Lambert fellow has any radio experience, but he does a great job of laying out the facts and circumstances of the Smart case. Because of the podcast, Lambert and the San Luis Obispo County Sherriff’s Dept. have received several tips about this case. A few days ago, several search warrants were served in the county including one in Washington state. The warrants were sealed, so it is unknown what evidence was collected. Speculation is there could be a break in the search for Smart, so we will have to see.\n\nWhenever I hear podcasts, they remind me of the old radio broadcasts of the 1930 and 1940s, where storytelling is done by voice and music only. You have to use your imagination to fill in the blanks, so you are drawn in to the story. This series drew me in and I bet many people were drawn in as well. Hence, the heighten interest and tips from listeners. Maybe radio can take a lesson from this and find a way to use certain aspects of podcasts to rekindle interest in radio listening.” – Dan Ramos, Joshua Tree\n\n** Goldman’s Quarantined Cruise Ship\n\n“Wishing Carl Goldman and Jeri Seratti the best. I had the great fortune of working for Carl at Transtar – he was terrific! Back then, we had ‘Super Gold,’ ‘Romancin’ The Oldies’ and other projects such as ‘Hangin’ With Hollywood (Hamilton)’ and ‘Radio Kandy’ with John Candy. And other projects.\n\nLots of editing! You knew me because I was always walking around there with reels of tape. At the time, Carl and Jeri were starting to date. She was always a fabulous lady. Good times. Great place! Here’s hoping they both return as healthy and vibrant as always.” – Gary West, facebook.com/manfromyesterday\n\n** Friends Reunited\n\n\"You recently posted a story about Jerry Lewine - how you met, how you became friends, and how he's now going through treatment for non-Hodgkins T-cell lymphona.\n\nI hadn't seen Jerry for somewhere close to 30 years. He was our chief engineer when I was program director at KBOQ in Monterey (of blessed memory). We had a great time together, way back when.\n\nYour update inspired me to reach out to him, and today we met for a reunion lunch at Adana in Glendale. It was so great to reconnect and to rekindle an old friendship. All through the years, you've said that the primary focus of your column is people. Once again, you've succeeded in bringing two LA Radio People together, in a very positive and memorable way. Thank you for that. I must say it was a joy to tell the young waitress who took this picture that she probably wasn't born the last time Jerry and I saw each other. (Jerry is on the left.)\" - Jared Charles Kliger\n\n** Punishment for Astros\n\n“The LA Angels home opener on April 3rd is against the Houston Astros. I'm curious if KLOS or KROQ has considered buying ALL available tickets and giving them to Dodgers fans?” - Pete Colburn\n\n** K-SURF Sounds\n\n\"Maybe something is in the works with K-SURF’s imaging. Their jingles refer to the music as 'Oldies.' At their website and voice tracking refers to the music as 'Super Hits.'\n\nThe playlist variety is listenable. The overall presentation not so much.\" - Greg Wood, West Hills\n\n“A lot of people thanked us for providing them a platform to heal, but I think all of that was jump started by Vanessa (Bryant, Kobe’s widow), Jeanie (Buss, Lakers team owner) and Rob.(Palinka, Lakers gm). They made it OK to start the healing process.”\n\nThe Lakers played their first game last Friday at a sold-out Staples Center. Preceding the game and at halftime, emotion-filled tributes were offered to remember Kobe and the eight other victims. “There was just a lot of love in that room. Having people together that were all experiencing the same sense of loss was really cathartic. And I thought what the Lakers prepared, and how they executed it, was extraordinary.”\n\nIreland said the Lakers made sure all of the victims, not just Kobe and daughter Gianna, were properly honored, “which was important.”\n\n“Everything flowed beautifully, and nothing was forced. Usher started singing, and when he was finished, Ben Hong almost magically appeared on a cello. Then Boys to Men nailed the anthem. LeBron talked from his heart.” Each player wore Kobe’s #24 jersey, all were introduced as “Kobe Bryant.” said Ireland. “I'll never forget that night, and think most of the people who were there feel the same way.”\n\nIreland said he “could tell Kobe stories for hours. He was the brightest star we've had since Magic and Shaq, and he exceeded all of our expectations.” Ireland offered two stories which endure in his memory. The first had to do with Kobe working out with the son of a former Laker.’\n\nThe story you’re referring to involves Larry Drew Jr. His dad, Larry, was a Lakers player and assistant coach for many years. When he was coaching, Larry Sr. asked Kobe if he would mind working out with Jr, who was an excellent high school player (he eventually went on to play at both North Carolina and UCLA). Kobe agreed to do it, and texted Jr. that he would come by the house and pick him up at 4 o'clock. Jr replied: “That's great – I’ll leave school a little early, and be ready at 3:45 p.m.” Kobe retorted: “No, I’m coming by to get you at 4 a.m. in the morning. You’ll be home in time to be a school by 8.”\n\nSo Jr. goes and works out with Kobe at 4 a.m., and after a couple of hours, Jr. is dead tired. He then asks Kobe what he’s going to do to recover. “Recover? I’ve go practice in an hour.” Jr. learned the same lesson all of us had learned over the years: Kobe would not get outworked by anybody, anywhere, at any time.\n\nIreland offered another story from the early years of Kobe with the Lakers over two decades ago:\n\nAnother time we were playing a day playoff game in Houston. The Lakers won it, and it ended the series, the Lakers winning three games to one. I had to stay at the Arena for a couple of extra hours, and when I walked into the hotel, most of our traveling party was at the hotel bar (including Kobe). Kobe waived me over to where he was standing in the bar.\n\nKobe asks me, “Hey John, you want a beer?” I reply, “Kobe, you don’t need to buy me a beer. I can get my own.”\n\nAt that exact time, a stranger walked up to Kobe and handed him a bottle of beer that the bartender had already opened. The guy said something like, “I’m a huge fan, and I always wanted to buy you a beer.” Kobe thanked him, and placed the beer down on the floor to his left. When I looked down, there were 17 open beers at his feet. People had been walking up to him and handing him beers for the past hour. I took one, and he said, “if anybody else in the TV crew wants one, just let me know.”\n\nIreland speculated the loss of Kobe might inspire the Lakers for the rest of the season. “A lot of us were grieving, looking for answers on where to go from here. But I thought when Vanessa issued her statement, followed by Jeanie, and then especially Rob Pelinka, the clouds started to part. It was almost as if we all said, \"if they can start to heal, so can we.”\n\nNo one really cared the Lakers lost to the Portland Trailblazers that night. Ireland said, “as for the team itself, once they got past the emotion of Friday night, they played great on Saturday and looked like the first place team they've been all year.”\n\nAs part of the Lakers broadcast team, Ireland said he has a responsibility to preserve the legacy of Kobe Bryant. “Hopefully we can honor what Kobe represented, and continue to share with the audience what he meant to Lakers Nation. My favorite part of Rob’s statement was when he was remembering both Kobe and Gianna: ‘All of us touched by them will now try to become torch carriers of their legacies.’”\n\n“That’s a great place to start for an announcer. I think we all need to keep their memories alive for future Lakers fans.” (John Ireland story written by LARadio senior correspondent, Alan Oda) ** Kobe Sighting\n\n“I was having lunch with Leon ‘Motorman’ Kaplan late Sunday morning after his show. We were at a restaurant on Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills, and no sooner had we sat down when ABC News broke into ESPN on the huge tv above the bar. NBA legend Kobe Bryant had been killed in a helicopter crash, probably not 10 miles from where we were sitting. There was an aerial image of the wreckage on the hillside, along with the overcast that was still enveloping the surrounding mountains. Leon, a veteran pilot, looked out the window at the thick layer of low clouds hovering over the Santa Monica Mountains and said, ‘Gotta be the weather.’ As the details of the tragedy continue to unfold, I increasingly suspect that he may have been right.” – Dave Kunz, Automotive Reporter, KABC-TV, Co-Host, The Car Show, KPFK/fm\n\n** Kobe Coverage\n\n“I was listening to KFI as well as KNX, but KROQ djs came in all day and talked about Kobe. So did Power 106. KPWR if not a Laker station IS the unofficial Laker fan station. They did a nice job. They took calls too.\n\nMonday: Felli Fel did a nice job and was crying as he left the air before 7 p.m., playing Mr. Basketball. I tuned into KLOS and did not hear anything. I may have missed it. But giving props to KROQ and KPWR being all over it on Sunday.” – Marc Shawula, Anaheim\n\n** DJs Extinct?\n\n“Of course they are. Still, it’s worthwhile to watch Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and notice how central radio in general and djs in particular are to the entire energy of that film. They were the soundtrack of life at that time, not just the soundtrack of radio. I saw Joe Scarborough talking about this on his show one morning, how he would steal away to a private room to record Don Imus off the radio. It was important. It was entertaining. It was great. Is it still?” – Mark Ramsey\n\n** Is Radio Dead?\n\n\"Radio is not dead, nor are live personalities. Case in point, the live personalities on SiriusXM. It is perversely ironic that satellite radio is now offering more and better personalities than many fm stations!\n\niHeart is the cancer to fm radio, and is expediting its demise. Thousands of layoffs with voicetracking and automation efforts in place. Seems like there is no value placed on local or live personalities.\n\nInvestment groups should start challenging the station licenses of some iHeart stations, on the grounds they are NOT serving their local communities of license. Voicetracking and automation provides ZERO services to the local community. With enough pressure, and influential license challenge groups comprised in part with influential local civic leaders and patience, iHeart would eventually be stripped of some of the licenses, and that would be a great thing for the local communities.” – Bob McKay\n\n** CDs Role\n\n“One point was overlooked on the issue of CDs and downloads seeing their demise. CDs were held to a very high standard of fidelity while downloads and streaming, not so much. It pains me to think of all the efforts that went into the creation and playback of any recording since the birth of the phonograph, reaching its zenith with the advent of CDs, now seems to have gone down the drain with so many downloads and streams whose sonic quality is far below CD quality.\n\nVinyl is perhaps the warmest-sounding medium for music, though there were all the problems of scratches, record warps, stylus mistracking and rumble. CDs offered music without those defects, but totally flat EQ sounded cold compared to vinyl. I download some of my music from iTunes, but I can tell you that frequency response is way below CD quality, one big reason I would prefer the CD while some of today’s CDs don’t seem to adhere to long-established quality standards, downloads seem to have no rules. I’ve downloaded many files from iTunes only to find the same poor response as the identical file I got years ago from a file-sharing service. It would seem as if they cheated and got the song from the same source as I, then charged me for it. So much for back-tracking on quality.\n\nCDs had a good ride, but I can’t help wonder if the music companies shot themselves in the proverbial foot with ever-increasing album prices, lack of a good distribution system to get current music to a hungry public, and in so many cases giving us one or maybe two usable songs per album. That forced a lot of us to download only what we wanted whether it was through Napster or elsewise, before enforcers started aggressively going after people for turning to downloads. Then there is the parade of re-recordings of that favorite tune you want to buy, and without being able to listen to enough of any given version, you don’t know if you bought the original or got duped. It seems a lot of the music industry’s downfall is its own doing. Call me old school, but I’ll hang on to my CDs and will hunt for more wherever I can still find them.” – Bill Powers\n\n** We Built This City\n\n“Gary Gibson is entitled to his opinion that We Built This City by Starship is ‘the worst song ever recorded,’ but he’s in the minority as far as radio listeners as a whole are concerned. I am constantly doing research for my own Eighties Channel format, and among my sources are the playlists of Classic Hits stations based on actual airplay. While Gibson may not like it, that song was the 218th most-played on Classic Hits stations in the Top 20 markets.\n\nI monitor those stations because they do periodic auditorium research to determine which songs are still popular with their target demographic. Any song that ranks in the top 1000 in airplay at any given time are the hits.\n\nSo if Saul Levine wants to add 80s to KSUR/1260, there are only about 170 songs from the 80s that were more popular than the one Gibson objects to. [50 of the songs getting better airplay are from other decades, and of the top 1000 only about half are from the 80s.]” – K.M. Richards\n\n** Into the PodCave\n\n“More power to John Michael! I hope PodCave is a huge success. Lord knows if the big conglomerates get a hold of podcasting, they’ll ruin it like they did radio. :(“ – Brian Perez\n\n** Fox to Lewine\n\n“Just sent Jerry Lewine a long email. Shocked to hear about his health issue. City of Hope is the place to be. Sure hope he goes remission soon. He was our chief engineer and we became friends as time went on.” – Bob Fox\n\n** B-I-G Heavyweight\n\n“I was looking through a box of old 45s and came across this picture of Jim Wood, from 1976. We worked together at KGFJ and remained friends until his death.\n\nI took the picture in 1976 when I was working at KMLO and Jim was at the Oceanside station. Jim lived with us briefly there, until he got his own place. Later we both ended up back in LA. I have many stories to tell about Jim, maybe at some point I will.” – Larry Boxer\n\n** Sweet Dick\n\n“Thanks so much for tipping us off about Sweet Dick Whittington being on KVEC this week. It was a big thrill to hear him back on the air, and thanks to you a lot of his old timers were able to enjoy the hour.\n\nFor those who missed it, I recorded the hour and put it on YouTube. Any search will find it. Again, thanks so much. We miss the Sweet Young Thing in a Queen’s Garden very much.” – Bruce Tennant, Long Beach\n\n** Loved Sweet Dick Interview\n\n“I want to thank whoever was responsible for getting Sweet Dick Whittington to be interviewed on KVEC in San Luis Obispo Wednesday, during the Dave Congalton Show. It was so fun to hear Sweet Dick again, sharing some stories of his radio career in Los Angeles, and having fun with the KVEC crew, the newsman, etc. What a wonderful show.\n\nI only hear you chime in once or twice, Don. But I loved Alan Oda’s phone call The call from Dick’s neighbor Betsy, a former KVEC radio personality, was also a lot of fun.\n\nGreat local radio and interesting to hear so many Los Angeles area people on the air who are now on the Central Coast, and other areas call in to the show.” – Jim Hilliker, Monterey\n\n** Abrams Take on Music Radio\n\n“Great observations by Lee Abrams on the current state of the space and its likely future direction. Our team members at www.knxfm93.com agree that streaming WILL be a significant force in the audio medium. Our challenge, and that of all in the streaming space, even with relevant and popular programming such as ours, is to last long enough for the transition from terrestrial to ‘other.’\n\nThis is a labor of love for us, but at some point, it will need to at least pay for itself. I still seek a streaming model that can and will be a profitable business. Meanwhile, we grow in listener count and significance on this ‘bleeding edge.’ We are the new pioneers, similar to those of exactly 100 years ago when AM radio was in its infancy. And many of them did pretty well!” – Pat Veling, Founding Partner, www.knxfm93.com\n\n** Blow It Up\n\n“I couldn’t agree more with this statement from Lee Abrams: ‘Unless you’re making a lot of money, the best thing for the stations is to blow them up.’” – Rich Brother Robbin\n\n** iHeart Blocks LARadio\n\n“I’ve been re-reading a best-selling novel called All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. The book is set in Nazi-occupied France during WW2 and radios play a big part in the plot line. The Nazis confiscated all the radios…both receivers and transmitters. If you were caught transmitting, you were shot dead. The Nazis controlled the narrative.\n\nI’m not directly comparing iHeart to the Nazis, but by cutting off employee access to LARadio, the company is certainly trying to control the narrative.” – Diane Thompson\n\n** iHeart Shuts Off LARadio\n\n“What a great, well written article. Wow, what about that? Raise your hands if you are surprised. Nope. Can’t see one hand raised :)”- Mike Butts\n\n** Is Radio Dead?\n\n“I saw a comment on a WBZ lay-off story that said unsympathetically ‘radio is dead, get over it!’ I hate to say it but the loss of jobs in our once thriving industry is catastrophic. I do still listen to ‘radio’ but it’s all online with apps. They are volunteer or non-profit stations but still also have an over the air fm signal.\n\nWith new cars no longer including AM receivers, the stations I worked for are doomed. There will always be a desire to hear news and music, but the radio delivery system is on life support.” – John Brooks, KFWB & KNX retired\n\n** Moving Home Office\n\n“Over two years ago, local engineer Chuck Ide of JLC Productions provided this prescient quote in a column I wrote for Radio World magazine. ‘What would stop a company from shifting all their operations from Riverside/San Bernardino over to Los Angeles? Why have a staff in Bakersfield? A music station in Tucson can now be contained in an equipment rack in Phoenix or New York.’\n\nChuck clearly saw this coming, at a time when most didn’t fully realize the impact that the ‘Main Studio Rule’ change (and economics) would have.\n\nHere’s the full column: https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/making-local-radio-that-isnt\n\nAlso, this column from a while back about former radio people marketing themselves to other industries could be relevant. Eric Holmes, a former LARP himself, warns that, ‘Radio’s job titles and jargon are useless anywhere else.’ He makes some helpful recommendations: https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/is-there-life-after-radio\n\nI’ve stopped writing the Radio World column, as I focus on my podcasting startup called Sound That BRANDS, but I still enjoy reading about my friends on LARadio.com. These days, it serves a need more than ever.” –Dave Beasing\n\n** Oldies Dilemma\n\n“Mr. Saul Levine, I see that against the general consensus of your listeners, you have decided to go ahead and add music from the 80s to your playlist. Your station, your choice.\n\nI shall continue to listen often as this is my favorite preset in my car, but I have just one question. With all the music from the 80s at your disposal, why, oh, why would you play Starship’s We Built This City, which is generally considered to be the worst song ever recorded?” – Gary Gibson\n\n** One-Year Warning\n\n“Good work on the postings. Always interesting. This struck me this morning from Elizabeth McDonnell, ‘I was informed that my job would be downsized in the following year end of March 2019.’ Informed a year in advance? How generous of management to allow her to find other employment before cutting her off. I’m impressed. In my experience it was always a case of no warning, no severance. You come to work one day and are told to turn in your keys and don’t come back [not mentioning any names...].” - Laura Brodian Freas Beraha\n\n** Plum Job in Kentucky\n\n“Just saying hello from Kentucky where all is well. Rob Frazier is right, this is a great little company in small town markets. Working part time is just enough Radio for me at this age and I spend the rest of my time with network marketing, which I am enjoying immensely and writing and hanging out with a boyfriend! I still enjoy it all!\n\nOn this, Betty White’s birthday, I think to myself here’s a woman who is 98 and she’s been having an incredible life, really doing it all and just thriving. Retiring is not in my future. My daddy worked into his 80s and I think that’s for me as well as I don’t play golf and I get restless watching too much television!\n\nThis year I’m going to be recording the audio version of my book Do Not Air which will be something different for me to do. It’s still selling on Amazon and there’s a Kindle version too.” – Nancy Plum\n\n** Radio Alternatives\n\n“For those of you lamenting the loss of any particular radio station going to Internet only-using an Alexis or Google device at home is a great option. They have sound clarity and decent speaker(s). For in car use that is what ‘Bluetooth’ is for. Apps such as ‘Tune In,’ etc., can make this possible. As a matter of fact, I listen to my favorite morning team on KLOS using this very method since moving away from Southern California. Let’s get with the times.” – Chuck Norton (avid radio fan formerly of So. Cal now residing in Utah)\n\n** Chandler Essay\n\n“Bruce Chandler wrote: ‘There’ has been taken over by companies who have decided they don’t really need you. You’re a money drain. You don’t really make a difference.’\n\nTrue! I remember a fellow jock in Vegas in the late 70’s saying to me, ‘management only views you as a walking negative sign.’ He was right.” – Bill Schwarz\n\n** Applaud Chandler\n\n“Bruce Chandler is absolutely right on with his essay on DJ’s heading for extinction. He and I – and hundreds more – are living proof.\n\nIn 1969 I was hired by Danny Mitchell of KEZY as production director. A little over a year later Danny fired me. He didn’t give me a reason and I honestly don’t know to this day why he did. I had two little kids, a new house I’d just bought on the GI Bill, and eight hundred bucks in the bank.\n\nFast forward about five years and Mitchell suddenly fired almost the entire on-air staff including Bruce Chandler in one morning. Keep in mind, KEZY was a powerhouse, delivering great ratings and equally great results for clients. I know, I placed many of my clients on the station because it worked!\n\nI happened to be listening to Bruce’s midday show when he was told while he was on the air that he was no longer needed at KEZY. I soon learned that the jocks were meeting at a nearby Mexican restaurant to try and figure out what to do. I drove there, rolled up in my new Pantera and announced ‘Guys, there is life after KEZY!’ That seemed to lift their spirits slightly.\n\nAnd, sure enough, all of them went on to new stations and new careers—Bruce, Scotty Morgan, Jim Meeker, etc. Me? I went on to a pretty damned good career in voiceover, supercross announcing, etc. and am in two Halls of fame and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Advertising Federation. None of this would have ever happened if I’d stayed a radio disc jockey. Am I pissed at Danny Mitchell for firing me fifty years ago? Nope. In fact, I thank him every time we meet. Seriously.\n\nFinally, re Bruce Chandler. A joke told by a dj on the air has got to be a classic for me to remember it. And Chandler – years ago – had a one-liner that almost caused me to drive off the road I was laughing so hard. He’d just played Jimmy Charles’ A Million to One and followed it up with ‘and those are the approximate odds of Jimmy’s career ever coming back!’” – Larry ‘Supermouth’ Huffman\n\n** Consolidation Was the Culprit\n\n“My heart and thoughts go out to the number of our sisters and brothers now out of work because of Clear Channel, now hiding as iHeart and the others. Consolidation caused all of this misery and the Mays family who can give a rats how they destroyed the radio industry. They made a ton of $$$$.\n\nConsolidation, Consolidation, Consolidation destroyed our beloved radio business. The 1996 Tele-com Act didn’t help much either. A past President that signed it, didn’t help much. It should have been two AM and two fm stations per market and that’s it. If you didn’t like that, don’t get into broadcasting. Karma has caught up with all of this happening now, and probably it’s not over yet.\n\nOh, yeah, Washington DC added their 5 cents worth too, by allowing it to pass. There’s a lot of folks with consolidation on their hands. The radio station license belongs to the American public, not some corporate pig that took advantage of loop holes so they could own every station in a given market. If a station was not needed like most of the Class A’s clogging up the dial, turn the darn things off and clean up the fm band, and AM if needed. Oh, well, they tell me you can’t back the train up now. It’s too late. Most of the humans that caused all of this are counting their 30 pieces of silver, so be it. How do you sleep at night, knowing what you did to radio?” – Phillip Davies\n\n** Bloodbath Humor\n\n“At one station when I left, my boss told me the only thing I could take were all the extra packets of ketchup, soy sauce, taco sauce and mustard in my desk drawer.\n\nIt was a shock to him to see me disassemble half of the production room because most of the equipment was mine. So, what is iHeart going to do with thousands of taco sauce packets this week? Sorry if this isn’t funny yet. I sometimes forget the formula – ‘Tragedy plus time equals humor.’” – Don Elliot\n\n** What’s Your Name?\n\n“I just want to thank you for putting your reports out. So many names of folks I never met but heard as I grew up in LA. Little did I know I would work at KFWB, KTWV, And KKLA for about a seven-year stint. Mostly as an Account Executive, but on air at KKLA on Sundays for about three years with a little talk show. I am so sorry to see how many are no longer with us and the complete corporate wholesale changes being made.\n\nThank you for keeping my memories alive. I know many others feel this way and you are most appreciated sir. God bless you” – Joseph Roth\n\n** Real Los Angeles Radio People\n\n\"I'm never been in the radio industry, but I do have a deep appreciation for local radio with real people behind the microphones. I know there are many different ways to listen to music, but I'll listen to local radio as long as it still out there in the air for me to grab.\n\nI think of a recent Ccrane article that talks about am/fm radios, how they don't listen to us or know where they are. Is there a way for you to periodically recognize certain radio stations in the LA area that still focus on real people and not voice tracks.\n\nI am a contributing member and listen 88.5 KCSN quite often because of the people I hear on the radio.\n\nI also listen to 105.1 KKGO weekdays between 10-2 because of the different bands/artists that host the radio station. I used to listen to 790 KABC in the mornings regularly, but am sort of looking for a new morning show for obvious reasons. Anyways, thanks for all you do.\" - Todd Kranz, Southern California\n\n** Nostalgia Sunday\n\n“Thanks for the fun surprise in your column – the throwback to the 25th anniversary of Power 106! To this day, it’s one of the most incredible experiences in my life. Every day was more exciting than the last. I still have great radio friends who work there who are just as passionate about Power as we were back on the day we launched. I remember at Christmas, Big Boy would emcee the Emmis Christmas parties and play Santa. He delivered every gift to every person like it was the most important job of his life, and had everyone busting up with laughter while doing it. I remember just being so impressed with that. What a guy, and what a great group of people to work with!\n\nDon, you’re always looking for radio hosts who are still thrilled to be live and local and doing what they do every day. Well, I’m one of them. Cannot fathom how good radio has been to me over the years, and still pinch myself to be able to interact with our Wave audience every day, both on the air and at our incredible live events. Not to mention interviewing artists like Alicia Keys, John Legend, George Clinton, etc. etc. –just amazing! What’s not to love?\n\nAre the best days of radio behind us? No, sir. They’re right now, and I’m grateful to live each one of them until my key card no longer works. :)” – Deborah Howell Many others, perhaps the overwhelming majority, never made it out of the small markets due to a lack of talent or luck or ambition or undying love of the craft.\n\nThey'd eventually throw in the towel and the microphone for any number of less competitive and normal out of the spotlight 9 to 5 jobs.\n\nHowever, it was the lucky few who eventually gained a \"name\" and had the talent, the \"art\" and on-air \"timing\" and instincts of what it takes to make an airshift an \"event\" that made listeners want to tune in on each day. Radio legends like Robert W. Morgan, The Real Don Steele, Charlie Tuna, Dan Ingram, Larry Lujack, Rick Dees, Dr. Don Rose. I could go on and on.\n\nEach of these personalities started off the same way all of the other radio deejays did, breaking in on a small station in Modesto, then moving on to Fresno or El Paso or San Bernardino or Boise then the even bigger cities. They were paying their dues so to speak, and crafting their on the air persona. It took years.\n\nThere was a method to arriving at the top as a music deejay. You'd start very small and strive to reach very large or largest, or at least, attain the level you aimed for. It was a logical progression. All the while, waking up each day being excited to go to work - being in love with your work, after all, once you get to do something you love, you never have to work a day in your life.\n\nAll the while, your \"bosses\" loved and appreciated you. When you got good ratings or if you did something funny or amusing or clever or informative on the air, you'd get nice feedback from them, maybe even a bonus!\n\nNo more. It's over. There is, as someone said, no \"there\" there.\n\n\"There\" has been taken over by companies who have decided they don't really need you. You're a money drain. You don't really make a difference. We can do it cheaper just playing music or adding some recorded voices to the mix or having one of our other people do your show and their show from another one of our stations. Save a buck!!!! Your talent is unappreciated.\n\nIt started with the all-night shift, then the evening shift, then the midday shift, the weekend shifts....It started with \"You're talking too much, play the music!\" One by one, gone were those friendly familiar comfortable live voices sharing time with you.\n\nThe literally thousands of on-air radio deejay jobs in the 60's, 70's, 80's and beyond are no longer \"necessary.\" They are gone.\n\nThe years and decades spent becoming a talented \"professional\" now mean nothing. The many, many people being displaced due to RIF (reduction in force) are probably looking at the end of their broadcast careers in one heartbreaking instant. What did someone once say, \"All dressed up with nowhere to go!\" It's a craft, that, thanks to a combination of too many other ways for people to listen to music in 2020. There's satellite radio, Spotify, iPods/Music Apps, You Tube. Then there's companies biting off more than they could chew financially when deregulation of the 90's started, resulting in \"reorganization;\" a craft that station owners find is no longer necessary, needed nor affordable.\n\nThe deregulation of 25 years ago has slowly and finally come close to killing off the terrestrial AM/FM radio most of us grew up on and fell in love with. It's not your grandfather's radio anymore.\n\nThere's really no way of knowing had \"deregulation\" never been allowed to happen, how different the \"ONE AM and ONE FM\" in each market rule would have shaped today's radio. I'm thinking it would have made it still a great business and an exciting business to be in.\n\nMy heart goes out to the additional 1,000 broadcast professionals who suddenly lost their jobs in the iHeart family this past week. I remember talking to a fellow dj at the network in the mid 90's and saying to him \"this deregulation is a bad idea! 7 stations in a market? That means if you get fired at one station, there are six others you won't be able to go to.\" A thousand radio people fired in one week would NEVER have happened in a One AM and One FM rule world. Very sad.... I know what it's like. I've been there.\n\nBruce Chandler spent a decade at KIQQ (K-100/fm), almost two decades at K-EARTH. He was mornings at Westwood One’s Oldies Channel.

Just brutal. May those of us, whose axing is in the rear view mirror, be a small beacon to those still wounded. There is life, and good life, up ahead. Holding those on the sidewalks in good will, and prayers for new opportunities.” – Keri Tombazian\n\n** Corporate Monster\n\n“I’m sickened and sad regarding the aforementioned ‘bloodbath’ at iHeart / noHeart radio. When a corporate monster regards people as ‘product,’ then they cease to be someone worthy of our advertising / tourist / consumer dollars and attention.\n\nIn what universe do they think syndication/taped programs will replace the human element?\n\nNeedless to say, my radio dial will be missing any of their stations. I’m sorry in particular for Ted Ziegenbusch, who has brightened many an afternoon drive time for me, as well as his savvy guesses / picks for the races at Santa Anita. My best wishes for him and his good wife, who is the only one who will gain from this inhumane action in having her husband around more.\n\nThe only saving grace from your post today is that ridiculous cartoon!” – Julie T. Byers\n\n** Kill the Beast?\n\n\"If they keep stabbing it with their steely knives, they will kill the beast! iHeart response.\" - Jim Carson\n\n** Mismanagement at iHeart\n\n“I feel for the 100’s who got the ax. Several years ago, when I got cut from the Dial Global / Westwood / Transtar Adult Standards format, about 20 other pros from up and down the hall lost their jobs, as well. Having gone through that experience, the only solace I can offer to the iHeart casualties is this is no reflection on your talent and abilities. Rather, this is a reflection of mismanagement and corporate insanity that has led us to where we are today – and that, radio as we knew it, is dead. Dammit.” – Bill A. Jones\n\n** CEO’s Acting Like Darth Vadar\n\n“With regard to Bob Pittman and iHeart’s firing of hundreds of local radio personalities, Lew Dickey showed the same behavior at Cumulus, firing legendary local personalities at top stations. This is what destroyed KABC.\n\nAnd to say that Greg Ashlock is ‘in charge’ of the LA and iHeart stations is we suppose, technically correct. But the execs, including Ashlock, are corporate minions to Pittman and they have two choices – follow Pittman’s dictates, or seek employment elsewhere. Not sure how anyone feels good about themselves just being a radio corporate lackey, but that’s another story.\n\nThe point is, corporate radio being led by ceo’s acting like Darth Vader, have napalmed local radio stations and their relevance. Imagine, radio’s worst enemy is their own ‘leadership,’ or much more accurately, the lack thereof. The crazy thing is iHeart is expediting the demise of radio! Sickening. Absurdly 12-minute long commercial cluster breaks, plus no local personalities / no local relevance is just driving more people away from radio. Sad.” – Bob McKay\n\n** Tough week\n\n\"If you were fired, dislocated, or laid off, you need to ask yourself, what has Radio taught you and prepared you for where you can apply your skills in the future? It’s the only way to keep your head on straight!\n\nWeird that the day before the firings I’d just re-watched the George Clooney movie with him as a hired hatchet man in Up in the Air. Let’s rename it, ‘Down… and OFF The Air.’” – Don Elliot\n\n** LARP Voices\n\n“Again Don – THANK YOU for giving us a voice. Reminding people [and ourselves] that we are talented, hard working professionals and not just a salary on an Excel spread sheet.” – Michael Castner\n\n** Midas Touch?\n\n“I don’t know Bean, but what a class act sticking up for Mr. Wallengren. Is there anything that the Mays Family and Bob Pittman touch that doesn’t hurt people or turn to shit? I gotta know.” – Mike Butts\n\n** Running 200+ Stations\n\n“The layoffs at iHeart and Cumulus are clear indications that running 200+ radio stations is an impossibility. Couple that with the hedge fund bozos who have stripped the stations they own of the connections to the communities they serve is criminal, and licenses should be stripped from them at real time. The days of postcard renewals should come to an end.” – David Cohen\n\n** Radio Celebration\n\n“I’m beginnin’ to think LARadio the website might just outlast LARadio the stations. Sad, sad, sad, sad. Not much of life to celebrate these days.” – Rich Brother Robbin\n\n** Firings\n\n“I wonder what the broadcasting professors can tell their students after such purges? And, I wonder what the students are supposed to think? And, I wonder how / where the media companies are going to find and develop talent as people die, retire, move on, change careers, etc.? The experience, talent, and knowledge that is flushed down the toilet is foolish and a disgrace.” – Andrew Schermerhorn\n\n** “The Passing Parade of Sylvia Chase\n\n“I had the honor of having Sylvia Chase as a colleague at ABC News, KRON/tv, and a friend.

Morgan into the NAB Radio Hall of Fame that was held at the Disneyland Hotel. He credited Robert W for teaching him how to become a personality. Imus would listen to Robert W when he was at KHJ, he’d then open his mic and copy Robert W.’s bits. They remained great friends till Robert’s death. I made the call to Don when Robert passed.” – Pat Duffy\n\n** No Tengo Miedo\n\n“My condolences to the family and friends of Elias Liberman. I met him in 1995 at the vending machine at the KRTH / Metro Networks building, where the Libermans had their office. We became good friends. I answered the phone for him and his brother and they really appreciated it. Elias was a kind and humble man and I will always remember him.” – Phil Harvey\n\n** No LA Times\n\n“Thank you for putting the update on T.J. Simers and his battle with the Los Angeles Times on LARadio. Shame on that judge for siding with TPTB and making him go through yet another court battle. What are they waiting for, T.J. to die or give up? Disgusting. Just another reason why I don’t subscribe to the LAT; all the good reporters are gone or on only a part time basis. Shameful.” – Julie T. Byers\n\n** Radio Greats\n\n\"Great segment on Morning Joe as Scarborough and Mike Barnacle raved about how Quentin Tarantino captured the dj spirit in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood. Ten minutes later, they had covered WABC, WLS, CKLW and KHJ’s Robert W. Morgan. They honed in on the intimacy of a jock playing records as opposed to the impersonal nature today of Spotify etc. and automation. Very compelling take on radio then and now.” – Bob McCormick\n\n** Whole Lotta Shakin’ Going On\n\n“Here is a story I did to a write-up on the 20th anniversary of the Northridge earthquake. Thought you might appreciate it.” – Steve Ray, Anchor/Reporter WBAL NewsRadio Baltimore\n\nI was running the controls for the Charlie Tuna morning show at the original 710/KMPC and had come in early to edit some interviews I had done the previous night at Comic Relief for Charlie’s show. As many people may remember, KMPC was on Sunset Blvd. in the old Warner Bros. studios, fronting the same lot as KTLA-TV. KMPC and 101.9FM/K-LITE shared a common wall with the soundstage built in the late 1920’s specifically for the first talkie The Jazz Singer.\n\nJust after 4:30 AM, the satellite feed for SportsBylineUSA cut out and the walls of the old studios shook like wet cardboard. Suddenly, the production room I was in went dark, sound tiles and a few of the florescent lighting fixtures hung down, and the only lighting to get through the darkness was from the control boards and a few emergency lights. I made my way to the main studio where the overnight board operator was and realized we may still be on-the-air. The AP wire service screen and a few other devices were still on, so I dragged a microphone around, flipped the studio monitor from ‘Program Feed’ (pre-delay) to ‘Air Feed’ (which was hooked up to an actual radio) and turned on the microphone. I snapped my fingers twice, turned off the mic so I could hear the monitor and when I heard the sound of my fingers snapping on-the-air, I knew we had to go live.\n\nWith the help of the overnight board operator manning the telephones, Nancy Plum all the way downtown in the Shadow Traffic center in a highrise, sports reporter Scott St. James, and the AP wire service we got the word out with as much detail as we could. Within about 20 minutes, Charlie Tuna got through on the phone from his home in Tarzana. He gave us a brief update on conditions in the SF Valley and then made his way to KMPC in the next 30 minutes. Operations Manager John Felz was there, along with the legendary former KHJ newsman Marv Howard and Station Manager Bill Ward, all within 15 minutes. We raised the station’s power to 50,000 watts under the emergency FCC provisions, effectively blasting a signal up and down the California coast, started to simulcast on K-LITE, and continued to not only update the public, but give them an outlet to tell us what was happening in their area.\n\nAfternoon host ‘Big’ Joe McDonnell, who lived in the valley, got through on the phone and reported just as the gas line exploded in Granada Hills. Although we didn’t know it at the time, KMPC was one of the few radio stations that remained on the air, which surprised many people because our transmitter was right in the middle of the San Fernando Valley on Burbank Blvd. in North Hollywood. On a personal note, after staying on the air and at the controls for Charlie, Marv, Scott and the rest of the team for another 10 hours I got home to my own house in Van Nuys to find that there was extensive damage to the structure, enough so that days later FEMA inspectors ‘Orange’ tagged half the building.\n\nOne of the oddities of that morning was well before widespread cellphone use, I had gotten a mobile phone to use for news gathering. From Hollywood I could not connect a call to Van Nuys on a landline, but by using the mobile phone I could call my relatives in San Francisco, give them details of what was going on, and then have them call my home to give them updates that everything was fine at work. It was a remarkable experience as we flew by the seat of our pants, having flipped KMPC to SportsRadio 710 less than a year earlier, going into an all-News mode for the better part of three days, and helping Southern Californians connect with each other and the rest of the world well before social media.\n\n** Successful Formula for Radio\n\n“Sales, in my opinion is only part of the problem. A reasonable revenue budget, a reasonable expense budget and decent marketing will win out. When one of these falls short, it would seem the product suffers. I’m sure when KHJ went on the air in ’65 RKO was prepared to take a revenue hit. No one’s tried to update ‘Boss Radio’ and yet the original model could be tailored to the 21st Century. Think not?\n\nLook at another entertainment organization that continues to succeed in 2019 and beyond. Disney. Still expanding theme parks, still making blockbuster movies and has its new subscription-based app, which has already proven to be monstrous. For that company, the apparent definition of success is making the guests happy. It’s not easy to do that. For every Disneyland park, there are hundreds of wanna be theme parks around the country that can't come close to the Disney experience.\n\nBill Drake didn’t create KYNO or KHJ or KFRC in a board room. He couldn’t have. He didn’t spend hundreds of thousands on research either. He studied what radio was missing and fixed it. Granted, there’s more competition than ever before, but the beauty of radio is still the same. You turn it on, and there it is. No fumbling with apps or web addresses or subscription fees. We still do most of the work. Yes those 7 or 8 minute commercial sets are unbearable. But if radio spent a little more time making those commercials relatable [the Stan Freberg of the 21st Century can step forward], spent more time making the listening experience more fun there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s a tall order. It’s a very ‘individual’ world these days too, but who’s trying to find the common denominator these days? I still think it’s out there. Somewhere.” – Dave Mason\n\n** Lakers Showtime\n\n“Congrats on the grandchild. One of the coolest things I got to do working for KLAC, that I joined in 1974, was being the ‘Image Voice’ for the Lakers. I did bumpers and promos for the pre- and post-games and the actual games from 1979, until I joined the Clear Channel stations as director of production full time in 2000.\n\nKLAC gm/pd Don Martin said it wouldn’t sound right for me to do a bumper then have one of my commercials air. I agreed. It was a great run, especially during the LAKERS’ Showtime years. I had more friends tell me they heard me during the Lakers’ game because of those voiceovers.\n\nThe first time they played my show opener introducing Chick Hearn, the late great Laker radio producer and studio engineer Frank Pollack, called me to come in his studio to hear it. The best part was when they went to commercial break Chick asked Frank: ‘Who is the new voice?’ Frank said it was Jim ‘Slam’ Duncan. Chick said: ‘He sounds great!’ What an honor. A big announcement at the end of February about me. As my auto mechanic says: ‘Stay Tuned.’” – Jim Duncan\n\n** Memories of George Moore\n\n“George Moore and I were Premies at Premiere Radio briefly and we resumed out friendship via Facebook several years ago. He returned to Detroit a while back and was doing fine until about four years ago.\n\nHe fell ill after moving down South with his then fiancé, was hospitalized, his body started to slowly give out on him and I believe, he never returned to his home again. I know of at least three long term care facilities he resided in. Thankfully the last was in Westland, Michigan, close to his family in Detroit.\n\nAfter dropping Facebook about a year ago, we fell out of touch. George was one of the radio guys who ‘got it’ and will be missed.” – Ira Lawson\n\n** News Talent\n\n“So, what’s wrong with Randy Kerdoon helping to report on the various fires? His first gig in the market was as my morning news guy at KWNK/670 (now KIRN) when I was programming that Talk station in 1989.” – K.M. Richards\n\n** Up to Parr\n\n“Sorry to hear about Shawn Parr’s recent termination. Shawn’s a pro. He’s both a good buy with no ego problems. Over the years I worked with him on a few promotions. He’ll land on his feet!\n\nRe George Lopez’s comments re Trump: Thought it was hilarious!” – Larry “Supermouth” Huffman\n\n** Love LARadio\n\n“Thanks for all you do. Reading LA Radio every day is a habitual part of my mornings. I love the current events almost as much as I do the history you share with us. Keep up the good work. One quick question: what happened to the 2nd half of the ‘L's’ in the Where Are They Now section? Am I missing something?” – Peter Lauer (Ed. note: My software is suffering from elder abuse and the L’s are being redone and updated as we go along.)\n\n** 2019 in Review\n\n“Alan Oda’s look back at 2019 – wow! And your first column of the New Year is beautiful and memorable on so many levels.\n\nIt’s the Circle of Life. A new baby arrives as a dear friend departs. Thanks for sharing your stories.” – Anita Garner\n\n** Imus Legacy\n\n“Congrats on being a Grandpa! I'm happy you got such a nice Christmas present! I’m so sorry about your friend, it’s like losing a part of you when your best friend from such a young age goes.\n\nAnd your words about Don Imus put his legacy in perspective. He did more good than bad in this world and hopefully his legacy with the ranch will last.” – Julie T. Byers\n\n** Reading LARadio\n\n“Congrats on the birth of your new grandchild. Reading about your long-term friendships brought tears to my eyes. Reading your column makes me feel like I know you personally, a tribute to your warmth that comes through in your columns.” – Margie Cherry, La Mirada\n\n** Oldies Radio\n\n“Around March 5, K-Surf will be Oldies for 3 years with not many changes in promos or presentation. Yesterday we listened for more than an hour, heard a lot of 70s, some 60s, no 50s, maybe a couple of 80s. Seemingly this strategy of adding 70s/80s has backfired, as ratings have dropped a lot, from a 0.5 to 0.2. And lastly, I am surprised Saul Levine isn’t trying the newly approved all-digital AM.” – Chime Hart\n\n** Motorman is On\n\n“Last Sunday I tuned in to what would have been Leon Kaplan’s last show on KABC. He told the listeners that it was a corporate decision to cancel the show, but KABC management would have liked him to stay. He said they let go of everybody who got paid on the show. He has decided to stay on and do the show for free, in hopes that he will find a sponsor.” – Gary Gibson\n\n** Sad to Learn of Bannister's Passing\n\n\"We were saddened to learn of the news of Raymond Bannister's passing - promotion on Christmas Eve.\n\nWhen Raymond [also Mike Evans, Denise Westwood, April, Jim Trenton, Dusty, Freddie Snakeskin, and Mr. \"Little GTO\" Rodney Bingenheimer, Dr. Drew and others] worked for almost free at 117 South Los Robles, we would do 'Auto Service Trade Outs For Airtime' at our Union 76 station at Arroyo Parkway at Glenarm in Pasadena with Raymond and other underpaid staff members. We enjoyed Raymond doing personal appearances and air time trade outs with us for our big tire sales in the 1970's and 1980's as we operated a traditional full service station with service bays thru 1998.\n\nWe have some pictures from these appearances that we would love to scan and send to his family in Prescott, Arizona if you have a way to contact them. Please let us know if we can forward these thru you to them and we will get them scanned for Raymond's family.\n\nThank You in advance, Happy New Year!\" - Lee and Dee Guenveur Lee's Union 76, 1974 thru 1998 Pasadena"
