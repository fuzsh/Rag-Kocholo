        "text": "Origins in Fort Myers\n\nWAY Media, Inc. has been in existence since 1987. The non-profit corporation began as a single FM radio station in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Bob and Felice Augsburg were residing in Fort Myers, where Bob was working as the Program Director at WSOR, a Christian Radio Station formatted for older adults. Bob and Felice have said that they \"were compelled by the burden to see a younger audience reached and Bob began producing a Saturday evening broadcast geared for youth.\" This program, which aired on WSOR, became the springboard for Christian Rock concerts in the area and the impetus for a 24/7 station with this type of format.\n\nMuch discussion with local parents and business people led to a non-profit Florida corporation and an application filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for an unused FM frequency.\n\nOn Christmas Eve (December 24) 1986, the group received its permit for the construction of a new non-commercial FM station in Fort Myers, WAYJ. On October 9, 1987, WAYJ, broadcasting as \"WAY-FM\", signed on the air.\n\nNew stations and concerts\n\nBy 1992, three WAY-FM radio stations were on the air—including Fort Myers; Nashville, Tennessee (WAYM); and West Palm Beach, Florida (WAYF).\n\nIn the mid-90s, WAY-FM stations, beginning with WAYF, began to sponsor and organize large Christian music concerts and day-long music festivals. Within a few years, Nashville and Fort Myers also began to sponsor major Christian music events.\n\nIn 2002, WAYM set an all time concert attendance record of 16,000+ celebrating their 10th anniversary. Over the years, WAY-FM radio stations have been selected four times as winners of the prestigious Dove Award for excellence in the operation of Christian Radio station.\n\nWAY Media Network Services\n\nAfter several years of planning, in 1996, WAY-FM began the Christian Hit Radio Satellite Network (CHRSN). The network was designed to help other stations who desired to reach the youth and young adults of their respective communities but lacked the manpower or resources to operate a station on their own.\n\nThe Nashville WAY-FM became the flagship station of CHRSN. Most recently they changed the name of CHRSN to WAY Media Network Services. WAY-FM Nashville continues as the satellite hub.\n\nCorporate office established\n\nIn 2001, WAY-FM Media Group established a corporate office in Colorado Springs, Colorado where Bob Augsburg, the president and founder now lives. Dusty Rhodes, former Station Manager of WAYF, joined Augsburg in Colorado as Chief Operating Officer and is now the ministry's Senior Vice President.\n\nIn 2005, Dar Ringling joined the ministry as Chief Financial Officer while Lloyd Parker, formerly General Manager of the K-LOVE & Air1 Radio Networks, became the Chief Operating Officer. They changed the station's format from Christian Rock and Rap to Christian Adult Contemporary and Worship, shifting their audience from 18- to 34-year-olds, to older adults.\n\nCurrent reach\n\nAt this time, WAY-FM owns and operates 14 full power FM radio stations including, newly added stations in Denver, Colorado; Wichita, Kansas and Tallahassee, Florida. WAY-FM also owns more than 20 low-power repeater stations. The WAY Media Network Services (WMNS) serves over 25 additional radio stations nationwide with satellite programming. Today more than 70 cities are served by a WAY-FM station or repeater.\n\nOn February 3, 2009, WAY-FM joined Radiolicious and began streaming on the iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nIn 2012, WAY-FM shifted from its long time Christian CHR format to a Christian Adult Contemporary format. Since 2013 WAY-FM via flagship station WAYM, Nashville is a Christian AC reporter to the Nielsen BDS service, and became a monitored reporter to Mediabase's Christian AC panel in April 2015.\n\nIn May 2015, Way FM announced plans to acquire KVRK, in North Texas. The Station calls letters are now KAWA and now broadcasts the national WAY-FM format. Power FM however has become an internet radio station but managed by WAY-FM Media Group.\n\nAlabama\n\nGadsden / Anniston – WAYU 91.1 & 107.3\n\nHuntsville – WAYH 88.1, 99.5, and 102.1-HD3\n\nMontgomery – 91.5 & 91.9\n\nBirmingham - 89.9 & 95.7-HD2\n\nColorado\n\nDenver – KXWA 101.9 & KCWA 93.9\n\nColorado Springs - KVUU-HD2 - K276FL 99.3\n\nFort Collins – KCWA 93.9\n\nPueblo - KRWA 90.9\n\nTrinidad – KJWA 89.7\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale – 88.1\n\nFort Myers – 100.5\n\nNaples – WAYJ 89.5\n\nPanama City - WAYP 88.3\n\nTallahassee – 88.1\n\nWest Palm Beach – WAYF 88.1\n\nGeorgia\n\nLindale / Rome – 90.3\n\nThomasville / Albany / Tallahassee – WAYT 88.1\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville – 92.1\n\nNew Albany (Louisville, KY) – WAYI 104.3 & WAYK 105.9\n\nKansas\n\nWichita – KYWA 90.7\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green – WAYD 88.1\n\nHenderson – 92.1\n\nLeitchfield - 89.5\n\nLouisville - WAYI 104.3 & WAYK 105.9\n\nMadisonville – 90.3\n\nOwensboro – 91.3\n\nOregon\n\nPortland - K283BL 104.5 (repeats the HD2 signal of KFBW)\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston – WAYA-FM 100.9\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga – 90.9 & 104.7\n\nClarksville – WAYQ 88.3\n\nNashville – WAYM 88.7\n\nWaverly – WAYW 89.9\n\nTexas\n\nSanger - KAWA 89.7\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane - 89.1 K206CQ (rebroadcasts programming from KYCC, Stockton, California)\n\nVancouver - KFBW 105.9-HD2 (programmed by WAY-FM; owned by Clear Channel Communications)\n\nFormer network affiliates\n\nThese stations disaffiliated with the network on July 1, 2013, when WAY-FM discontinued satellite distribution outside its station group.\n\nFlorida\n\nGlen St. Mary – 100.3\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus – 96.1\n\nIndiana\n\nMarion - 94.3 WIWU \"The Fortress\"\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids – 89.1\n\nKansas\n\nHays – 98.5\n\nKentucky\n\nShelbyville – 93.3\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron – Power 88.3 WNFA (now airs a locally originating CCM format)\n\nGrand Rapids, Michigan - 99.3 WJQK\n\n(WAY-FM is not related to Cornerstone University's WaY-FM network, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.)\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji - 94.9\n\nFosston – 107.1\n\nPark Rapids – 92.9\n\nRoseau - 102.9\n\nThief River Falls – 107.9\n\nWalker – 104.9\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson – 93.5\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman – 99.1\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene – 94.9\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks – 104.9\n\nOhio\n\nAshland – 91.1\n\nMansfield – 90.7 (WVMC and its translators in Ashland and Wooster switched to a praise and worship music format)\n\nWooster – 102.7\n\nOregon\n\nBrookings – 106.3\n\nCanyonville – 96.7\n\nCoos Bay – 98.7\n\nGold Beach – 105.5\n\nSutherlin – 107.1\n\nWinston – 105.5\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBrookville – 95.9\n\nIndiana – 103.7\n\nPittsburgh – 910 AM\n\nState College – 89.1\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg – 104.1\n\nCharleston - 100.9\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City – 97.9\n\nTexas\n\nKerrville – 101.5\n\nSanger - 89.7 KAWA-FM (Now owned by WAY-FM and broadcasting their signal as of September 2015.)\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington – 90.9\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton – WRPC-LP 103.7\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay – WORQ 90.1\n\nWausau – 89.5"
