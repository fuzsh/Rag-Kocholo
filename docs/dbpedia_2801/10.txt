WAY Media Chief Content Officer Faron Dice has announced that Todd Stach has been named Network Program Director, effective October 1, 2017. Just earlier today Stach announced he was leaving his position at WCVO/Columbus (104.9 The River) after 11 years. His lat day at WCVO will be Sept 29th and he will help the station in the transition period.

“I am very excited to have Todd join our team,” says Dice. “His experience, programming knowledge, and passion are exactly what we have been looking for in someone to take the reins and lead our programming team!”

According to Stach, “My career began at WAY-FM Nashville as an intern. Due to a series of God moments over the summer my career has now come full circle. Amazing! I’m humbled to begin serving alongside this talented team, organization and its listeners across America and around the world.”

Stach replaces Rob Wagman who left WAY FM this past May.
