        "text": "When the First World War broke out on 1st August, 1914, Einstein supported the formation of a pacifist group, and became a member of the “Bund Neues Vaterland”, rejecting the aggressive war aims of Germany. He also signed the “Manifest an die Europäer” (Manifesto to the Europeans). Further on, Einstein, along with J.W. de Haas made experimental tests to the gyromagnetic effect (called the Einstein-de Haas-effect).\n\nEinstein struggled hard for some years to extend the theory of Special Relativity. He worked on the creation of a general theory of relativity, which is but a generalization of the special theory of relativity. After spending almost a decade in imaginative thoughts which ended in frustration and darkness, Einstein completed his general theory of relativity. In Einstein’s words, it later dawned on him only gradually after years of independent scientific work that “the approach to a more profound knowledge of the basic principles of Physics is tied up with the most intricate mathematical methods.” A new understanding of gravity was reached which overturned the prescribed notions of space and time.\n\nIn March 1916, he published his paper on the general theory of relativity named, “Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie” (The Formal Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity) in the ‘Annalen der Physik’. During this period, Einstein also contributed to the problems of the theory of radiation and statistical mechanics. Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted the perihelion motion of mercury, the gravitational red shift and also the deflection of light in a gravitational field. Einstein had total conviction that light deflection by the gravitational field of the sun could be observed during a total solar eclipse. Einstein considered the general theory of relativity as his masterpiece.\n\n“The years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alternations of confidence and exhaustion and the final emergence into the light – only those who have experienced it can understand it.”\n\nThere was a time when asked about his laboratory, Einstein would point to his head and as regards his tools, he would point to his fountain pen. Einstein however did emphasize that ‘observed facts’ formed the real basis of much of his work, and sometimes his inspired intuition gave rise to the coordinating theory which explained them.\n\nOn 5th May, 1916, Einstein succeeded Max Planck as the president of the “Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft” (German Physical Society). He continued working on his theories and in December 1916 he brought out his most famous book, “Über die spezielle und die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie, gemeinverständlich” (On the Special and General Theory of Relativity, A Popular Account). His health however started to take a toll on him, consumed as he was with work most of the time. In 1917, Einstein became sick many a times, and also suffered from a liver disease and stomach ulcer. During this “down” period, Elsa, his cousin, took good care of him. Not one to be idle for long, Einstein soon wrote a work on Cosmology.\n\nProfessionally, Einstein’s career graph was soaring. On 1st October, 1917, Einstein became the director of the ‘Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics’. In 1918, with the collapse of Germany, Einstein’s involvement in politics rose and he supported a new progressive party. On the home front, having lived apart for five years, Einstein and Mileva later got divorced on 14th February, 1919, due to incompatibility rather than conflicts.\n\nEinstein at this time also became involved in Zionism. In early 1919, Zionist leader Kurt Blumenfeld visited him and they had discussions on Zionism. Einstein said, “I am, as a human being, an opponent of nationalism, but as a Jew, I am from today, a supporter of the Zionist effort.” He also advocated the creation of a new Jewish University in Palestine (the later Hebrew University in Jerusalem).\n\nBy now, Einstein had become a symbol of scientific intelligence and thought of at its highest. During the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919, on the volcanic island of Principe in the Gulf of Guinea in western Africa, a British expedition led by English astronomer Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington made astronomical measurements, recorded their observations and confirmed Einstein’s prediction about light deflection by the gravitational field of the sun. In Sobral, Brazil, a second expedition led by Andrew Crommelin observed this eclipse and confirmed the same.\n\nWhile all this was happening cupid struck between Einstein and his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal and the two got married on 2nd June, 1919. Elsa already had two daughters, Ilse and Margot from her first marriage, and together, the family moved to Berlin. On 6th November, 1919, the official result of the above expeditions was announced in a joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society in London. The president of the Royal Society, Joseph John Thomson stated, “This is the most important result related to the theory of gravitation since the days of Newton…..This result is among the greatest achievements of human thinking.”\n\nThe perihelion motion of mercury and the gravitational red shift were also confirmed with further experiments. With these glorious confirmations of his general theory of relativity, Einstein became famous not only in the scientific community but across the world even to the lay person. A leading British daily newspaper ‘The Times’ announced in its banner headline on 7th November, 1919 : “Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown”."
