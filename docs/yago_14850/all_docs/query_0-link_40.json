        "text": "F. Scott Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. As a child, he lived a comfortable life with luxuries due to his mother's fortune. As a child, he attended a catholic school and wrote his first novel at the age of 13. His claim to fame was writing the Great Gatsby, where he started to be known as a real writer and wrote many other great pieces of writing that were later appreciated. It gained popularity due to its description of the 1920’s. After this, he became a heavy drinker which led to alcoholism and he began to have many problems such wife who began to have mental problems. Some of his contributions to society are his work of the Great Gatsby is read by every High School, that is transforming generations through literature. Albert Einstein would get along with F. Scott Fitzgerald because Einstein likes reading books and they can converse about The Great Gatsby and his ideas on how he came up with the book and probably give him some ideas.\n\nBorn on day, (3.14) March 13th, 1879, in Ulm, Germany to a middle-class Jewish Parents, his father was a salesman and later ran a electrochemical factory. His mother didn’t work but rather took care of the house. They had another child, Maria, and she was two years younger than Albert. When he was born, he had a huge head disproportionate to his body that made his parents worried, but after a short period of time his head became proportionate. As a child he had difficulties talking and he didn’t start speaking until he was 4. His passion\n\nThe reason why his parents left Germany because Albert’s father was a businessman so his father had a business in Milan. So Albert stayed in Germany just to finish high school. But in school Einstein was only good in math and science but in the other subjects he was not good at. Then Albert quit high school in Germany and also lost his German citizenship and went to Switzerland to finish high school. After finishing high school Albert applied for a college called Swiss Federal Polytechnic Institute. The first Einstein took the exam he failed. Einstein waited a year to take the exam again and this time he passed the exam. Albert later started to study math and science with some people that later became his friends. Einstein graduated out of college in 1900 but the two years that came were too difficult for Albert. He wanted to teach math and science in college but never found a job in a college. Lucky in 1902 Albert got a job in Swiss patent office. It was a place that where people could their ideas and the people that worked there to make the new\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most luminary thinkers in history made many influential contributions to the fields of science and philosophy to revolutionize man’s understanding of the world. All great things once had humble beginnings. Einstein was born into a middle class family with one sibling. Early in his life, his family influenced him through his presents. His family would gift items such as him telescopes and compasses. His uncle would also, on occasional, teach him in algebra. The one man however who inspired him the most was Albert A. Michelson, a former navy student who refined the definition of the speed of light. In addition to his type of home-schooling, Einstein also went to a public school. It was always a controversial question that asked if Einstein failed at some core subjects in school. The only and true answer is that he set his focus on only the subjects that intrigued him. It was in this way that he was able to achieve the great works that he did. Later on in his life, he would put this strategy to use again as he focuses on developing the Theory of Special Relativity and the equation E=mc². Through the establishment of his legendary equation, the Theory for Lasers, and the publication of Theory of Special Relativity, Albert Einstein succeeded in laying an enormous impact on the technology in the twenty and twenty-first century.\n\nHowever, his language teachers thought him dull witted because he could not learn according to the way they taught. Nonetheless, it does not indicate that Einstein was retarded. Thomas claims that one professor in particular noted Einstein a so-called ‘child prodigy’. Einstein continued to advance in his mathematics and physics studies despite his young age. Additionally, Thomas discovers that at the age of sixteen and a half, Einstein passed the entrance examination to the Federal Polytechnical School in Zurich with the best scores on mathematics and sciences but poor scores on language and history subjects. Einstein’s reasons for his failure in these subjects were his inability to memorize. Despite that claim, Thomas counters with the evidence that Einstein was at least two years younger than all the students taking the examination. This discovery is worthy as a counterargument against the claim of his having learning or reading\n\nHis work led to important advances such as the control of atomic energy, space exploration, and applications of light. As a young boy born to Jewish parents in Germany, his teachers initially called him slow and lazy. However, by the time he left school at the age of 15, one teacher remarked there was nothing left to teach him. Einstein studied at the Institute of Technology in Zurich and received his doctorate in 1905 at the age of 26. That same year, he published five groundbreaking scientific papers. The first paper earned him his doctorate, and the concepts presented in the next four papers helped change our understanding of the universe. The topics were:\n\nBut it was not easy for him to get to where he went. Albert was born on March 14 in 1879, in Wurttemberg, Germany, and grew up there. He started speaking at a late age of seven years old, making him develop a speech problem, this made him curious about silly ordinary things like time and space which help him want to become a scientist.His father gave him a compass, which made also made him want to become a scientist even more. He was homeschooled for one year and then sent to primary school. After entering school Albert did not like authority and was often rude and cocky to them, making many teachers not like him. He attended school and tried, but many teachers said he would never go far in life because of problems he had in school . Einstein was also Jewish, so this causes many problems for him since he lived in Germany right around the time the Nazi were invading. But these traits would help make these ordinary men become a face that no one ever forgot. He conquered the obstacles and started to go to college at Trinity. At college he focused most of his time in math and physics and graduated in 1900 with a physics degree. He tried his hardest to work as a professor, but could keep a job , so he put his time into developing his theory and"
