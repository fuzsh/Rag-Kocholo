He had, after all, just\n\naddressed his friend as \"you frozen whale\" and apologized for writing a\n\nletter that was \"inconsequential babble.\" Only when he got around to\n\ndescribing the papers, which he had produced during his spare time, did\n\nhe give some indication that he sensed their significance.\n\n\"The first deals with radiation and the energy properties of light and\n\nis very revolutionary,\" he explained. Yes, it was indeed revolutionary.\n\nIt argued that light could be regarded not just as a wave but also as a\n\nstream of tiny particles called quanta. The implications that would\n\neventually arise from this theory -- a cosmos without strict causality\n\nor certainty -- would spook him for the rest of his life.\n\n\"The second paper is a determination of the true sizes of atoms.\" Even\n\nthough the very existence of atoms was still in dispute, this was the\n\nmost straightforward of the papers, which is why he chose it as the\n\nsafest bet for his latest attempt at a doctoral thesis. He was in the\n\nprocess of revolutionizing physics, but he had been repeatedly thwarted\n\nin his efforts to win an academic job or even get a doctoral degree,\n\nwhich he hoped might get him promoted from a third- to a second-class\n\nexaminer at the patent office.\n\nThe third paper explained the jittery motion of microscopic particles in\n\nliquid by using a statistical analysis of random collisions. In the\n\nprocess, it established that atoms and molecules actually exist.\n\n\"The fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point, and is an\n\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies which employs a modification of the\n\ntheory of space and time.\" Well, that was certainly more than\n\ninconsequential babble. Based purely on thought experiments -- performed\n\nin his head rather than in a lab -- he had decided to discard Newton's\n\nconcepts of absolute space and time. It would become known as the\n\nSpecial Theory of Relativity.\n\nWhat he did not tell his friend, because it had not yet occurred to him,\n\nwas that he would produce a fifth paper that year, a short addendum to\n\nthe fourth, which posited a relationship between energy and mass. Out of\n\nit would arise the best-known equation in all of physics: E=mc2.\n\nLooking back at a century that will be remembered for its willingness to\n\nbreak classical bonds, and looking ahead to an era that seeks to nurture\n\nthe creativity needed for scientific innovation, one person stands out\n\nas a paramount icon of our age: the kindly refugee from oppression whose\n\nwild halo of hair, twinkling eyes, engaging humanity, and extraordinary\n\nbrilliance made his face a symbol and his name a synonym for genius.\n\nAlbert Einstein was a locksmith blessed with imagination and guided by a\n\nfaith in the harmony of nature's handiwork. His fascinating story, a\n\ntestament to the connection between creativity and freedom, reflects the\n\ntriumphs and tumults of the modern era.\n\nNow that his archives have been completely opened, it is possible to\n\nexplore how the private side of Einstein -- his nonconformist\n\npersonality, his instincts as a rebel, his curiosity, his passions and\n\ndetachments -- intertwined with his political side and his scientific\n\nside. Knowing about the man helps us understand the wellsprings of his\n\nscience, and vice versa. Character and imagination and creative genius\n\nwere all related, as if part of some unified field.\n\nDespite his reputation for being aloof, he was in fact passionate in\n\nboth his personal and scientific pursuits. At college he fell madly in\n\nlove with the only woman in his physics class, a dark and intense\n\nSerbian named Mileva Maric´. They had an illegitimate daughter, then\n\nmarried and had two sons. She served as a sounding board for his\n\nscientific ideas and helped to check the math in his papers, but\n\neventually their relationship disintegrated. Einstein offered her a\n\ndeal. He would win the Nobel Prize someday, he said; if she gave him a\n\ndivorce, he would give her the prize money. She thought for a week and\n\naccepted. Because his theories were so radical, it was seventeen years\n\nafter his miraculous outpouring from the patent office before he was\n\nawarded the prize and she collected.\n\nEinstein's life and work reflected the disruption of societal\n\ncertainties and moral absolutes in the modernist atmosphere of the early\n\ntwentieth century. Imaginative nonconformity was in the air: Picasso,\n\nJoyce, Freud, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and others were breaking\n\nconventional bonds. Charging this atmosphere was a conception of the\n\nuniverse in which space and time and the properties of particles seemed\n\nbased on the vagaries of observations.\n\nEinstein, however, was not truly a relativist, even though that is how\n\nhe was interpreted by many, including some whose disdain was tinged by\n\nanti-Semitism. Beneath all of his theories, including relativity, was a\n\nquest for invariants, certainties, and absolutes. There was a harmonious\n\nreality underlying the laws of the universe, Einstein felt, and the goal\n\nof science was to discover it.\n\nHis quest began in 1895, when as a 16-year-old he imagined what it would\n\nbe like to ride alongside a light beam. A decade later came his miracle\n\nyear, described in the letter above, which laid the foundations for the\n\ntwo great advances of twentieth-century physics: relativity and quantum\n\ntheory.\n\nA decade after that, in 1915, he wrested from nature his crowning glory,\n\none of the most beautiful theories in all of science, the general theory\n\nof relativity. As with the special theory, his thinking had evolved\n\nthrough thought experiments. Imagine being in an enclosed elevator\n\naccelerating up through space, he conjectured in one of them. The\n\neffects you'd feel would be indistinguishable from the experience of\n\ngravity.\n\nGravity, he figured, was a warping of space and time, and he came up\n\nwith the equations that describe how the dynamics of this curvature\n\nresult from the interplay between matter, motion, and energy. It can be\n\ndescribed by using another thought experiment. Picture what it would be\n\nlike to roll a bowling ball onto the two-dimensional surface of a\n\ntrampoline. Then roll some billiard balls. They move toward the bowling\n\nball not because it exerts some mysterious attraction but because of the\n\nway it curves the trampoline fabric. Now imagine this happening in the\n\nfour-dimensional fabric of space and time. Okay, it's not easy, but\n\nthat's why we're no Einstein and he was.\n\nThe exact midpoint of his career came a decade after that, in 1925, and\n\nit was a turning point. The quantum revolution he had helped to launch\n\nwas being transformed into a new mechanics that was based on\n\nuncertainties and probabilities. He made his last great contributions to\n\nquantum mechanics that year but, simultaneously, began to resist it. He\n\nwould spend the next three decades, ending with some equations scribbled\n\nwhile on his deathbed in 1955, stubbornly criticizing what he regarded\n\nas the incompleteness of quantum mechanics while attempting to subsume\n\nit into a unified field theory.\n\nBoth during his thirty years as a revolutionary and his subsequent\n\nthirty years as a resister, Einstein remained consistent in his\n\nwillingness to be a serenely amused loner who was comfortable not\n\nconforming. Independent in his thinking, he was driven by an imagination\n\nthat broke from the confines of conventional wisdom. He was that odd\n\nbreed, a reverential rebel, and he was guided by a faith, which he wore\n\nlightly and with a twinkle in his eye, in a God who would not play dice\n\nby allowing things to happen by chance.\n\nEinstein's nonconformist streak was evident in his personality and\n\npolitics as well. Although he subscribed to socialist ideals, he was too\n\nmuch of an individualist to be comfortable with excessive state control\n\nor centralized authority. His impudent instincts, which served him so\n\nwell as a young scientist, made him allergic to nationalism, militarism,\n\nand anything that smacked of a herd mentality. And until Hitler caused\n\nhim to revise his geopolitical equations, he was an instinctive pacifist\n\nwho celebrated resistance to war.\n\nHis tale encompasses the vast sweep of modern science, from the\n\ninfinitesimal to the infinite, from the emission of photons to the\n\nexpansion of the cosmos. A century after his great triumphs, we are\n\nstill living in Einstein's universe, one defined on the macro scale by\n\nhis theory of relativity and on the micro scale by a quantum mechanics\n\nthat has proven durable even as it remains disconcerting.\n\nHis fingerprints are all over today's technologies. Photoelectric cells\n\nand lasers, nuclear power and fiber optics, space travel, and even\n\nsemiconductors all trace back to his theories. He signed the letter to\n\nFranklin Roosevelt warning that it may be possible to build an atom\n\nbomb, and the letters of his famed equation relating energy to mass\n\nhover in our minds when we picture the resulting mushroom cloud.\n\nEinstein's launch into fame, which occurred when measurements made\n\nduring a 1919 eclipse confirmed his prediction of how much gravity bends\n\nlight, coincided with, and contributed to, the birth of a new celebrity\n\nage. He became a scientific supernova and humanist icon, one of the most\n\nfamous faces on the planet. The public earnestly puzzled over his\n\ntheories, elevated him into a cult of genius, and canonized him as a\n\nsecular saint.\n\nIf he did not have that electrified halo of hair and those piercing\n\neyes, would he still have become science's preeminent poster boy?\n\nSuppose, as a thought experiment, that he had looked like a Max Planck\n\nor a Niels Bohr. Would he have remained in their reputational orbit,\n\nthat of a mere scientific genius? Or would he still have made the leap\n\ninto the pantheon inhabited by Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton?\n\nThe latter, I believe, is the case. His work had a very personal\n\ncharacter, a stamp that made it recognizably his, the way a Picasso is\n\nrecognizably a Picasso. He made imaginative leaps and discerned great\n\nprinciples through thought experiments rather than by methodical\n\ninductions based on experimental data. The theories that resulted were\n\nat times astonishing, mysterious, and counterintuitive, yet they\n\ncontained notions that could capture the popular imagination: the\n\nrelativity of space and time, E=mc2, the bending of light beams, and the\n\nwarping of space.\n\nAdding to his aura was his simple humanity. His inner security was\n\ntempered by the humility that comes from being awed by nature. He could\n\nbe detached and aloof from those close to him, but toward mankind in\n\ngeneral he exuded a true kindness and gentle compassion.\n\nYet for all of his popular appeal and surface accessibility, Einstein\n\nalso came to symbolize the perception that modern physics was something\n\nthat ordinary laymen could not comprehend, \"the province of priest-like\n\nexperts,\" in the words of Harvard professor Dudley Herschbach. It was\n\nnot always thus. Galileo and Newton were both great geniuses, but their\n\nmechanical cause-and-effect explanation of the world was something that\n\nmost thoughtful folks could grasp. In the eighteenth century of Benjamin\n\nFranklin and the nineteenth century of Thomas Edison, an educated person\n\ncould feel some familiarity with science and even dabble in it as an\n\namateur.\n\nA popular feel for scientific endeavors should, if possible, be restored\n\ngiven the needs of the twenty-first century. This does not mean that\n\nevery literature major should take a watered-down physics course or that\n\na corporate lawyer should stay abreast of quantum mechanics. Rather, it\n\nmeans that an appreciation for the methods of science is a useful asset\n\nfor a responsible citizenry. What science teaches us, very\n\nsignificantly, is the correlation between factual evidence and general\n\ntheories, something well illustrated in Einstein's life.\n\nIn addition, an appreciation for the glories of science is a joyful\n\ntrait for a good society. It helps us remain in touch with that\n\nchildlike ca-pacity for wonder, about such ordinary things as falling\n\napples and elevators, that characterizes Einstein and other great\n\ntheoretical physicists.\n\nThat is why studying Einstein can be worthwhile. Science is inspiring\n\nand noble, and its pursuit an enchanting mission, as the sagas of its\n\nheroes remind us. Near the end of his life, Einstein was asked by the\n\nNew York State Education Department what schools should emphasize. \"In\n\nteaching history,\" he replied, \"there should be extensive discussion of\n\npersonalities who benefited mankind through independence of character\n\nand judgment.\" Einstein fits into that category.\n\nAt a time when there is a new emphasis, in the face of global\n\ncompetition, on science and math education, we should also note the\n\nother part of Einstein's answer. \"Critical comments by students should\n\nbe taken in a friendly spirit,\" he said. \"Accumulation of material\n\nshould not stifle the student's independence.\" A society's competitive\n\nadvantage will come not from how well its schools teach the\n\nmultiplication and periodic tables, but from how well they stimulate\n\nimagination and creativity.\n\nTherein lies the key, I think, to Einstein's brilliance and the lessons\n\nof his life. As a young student he never did well with rote learning.\n\nAnd later, as a theorist, his success came not from the brute strength\n\nof his mental processing power but from his imagination and creativity.\n\nHe could construct complex equations, but more important, he knew that\n\nmath is the language nature uses to describe her wonders. So he could\n\nvisualize how equations were reflected in realities -- how the\n\nelectromagnetic field equations discovered by James Clerk Maxwell, for\n\nexample, would manifest themselves to a boy riding alongside a light\n\nbeam. As he once declared, \"Imagination is more important than\n\nknowledge.\"\n\nThat approach required him to embrace nonconformity. \"Long live\n\nimpudence!\" he exulted to the lover who would later become his wife. \"It\n\nis my guardian angel in this world.\" Many years later, when others\n\nthought that his reluctance to embrace quantum mechanics showed that he\n\nhad lost his edge, he lamented, \"To punish me for my contempt for\n\nauthority, fate made me an authority myself.\"\n\nHis success came from questioning conventional wisdom, challenging\n\nauthority, and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane.\n\nThis led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for\n\nfree minds, free spirits, and free individuals. Tyranny repulsed him,\n\nand he saw tolerance not simply as a sweet virtue but as a necessary\n\ncondition for a creative society. \"It is important to foster\n\nindividuality,\" he said, \"for only the individual can produce the new\n\nideas.\"\n\nThis outlook made Einstein a rebel with a reverence for the harmony of\n\nnature, one who had just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to\n\ntransform our understanding of the universe. These traits are just as\n\nvital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will\n\ndepend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the\n\ntwentieth century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.\n\nCopyright © 2007 by Walter Isaacson\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nCHILDHOOD\n\n1879-1896\n\nThe Swabian\n\nHe was slow in learning how to talk. \"My parents were so worried,\" he\n\nlater recalled, \"that they consulted a doctor.\" Even after he had begun\n\nusing words, sometime after the age of 2, he developed a quirk that\n\nprompted the family maid to dub him \"der Depperte,\" the dopey one, and\n\nothers in his family to label him as \"almost backwards.\" Whenever he had\n\nsomething to say, he would try it out on himself, whispering it softly\n\nuntil it sounded good enough to pronounce aloud. \"Every sentence he\n\nuttered,\" his worshipful younger sister recalled, \"no matter how\n\nroutine, he repeated to himself softly, moving his lips.\" It was all\n\nvery worrying, she said. \"He had such difficulty with language that\n\nthose around him feared he would never learn.\"\n\nHis slow development was combined with a cheeky rebelliousness toward\n\nauthority, which led one schoolmaster to send him packing and another to\n\namuse history by declaring that he would never amount to much. These\n\ntraits made Albert Einstein the patron saint of distracted school kids\n\neverywhere. But they also helped to make him, or so he later surmised,\n\nthe most creative scientific genius of modern times.\n\nHis cocky contempt for authority led him to question received wisdom in\n\nways that well-trained acolytes in the academy never contemplated. And\n\nas for his slow verbal development, he came to believe that it allowed\n\nhim to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for\n\ngranted. \"When I ask myself how it happened that I in particular\n\ndiscovered the relativity theory, it seemed to lie in the following\n\ncircumstance,\" Einstein once explained. \"The ordinary adult never\n\nbothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are things\n\nhe has thought of as a child. But I developed so slowly that I began to\n\nwonder about space and time only when I was already grown up.\n\nConsequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary\n\nchild would have.\"\n\nEinstein's developmental problems have probably been exaggerated,\n\nperhaps even by himself, for we have some letters from his adoring\n\ngrandparents saying that he was just as clever and endearing as every\n\ngrandchild is. But throughout his life, Einstein had a mild form of\n\necholalia, causing him to repeat phrases to himself, two or three times,\n\nespecially if they amused him. And he generally preferred to think in\n\npictures, most notably in famous thought experiments, such as imagining\n\nwatching lightning strikes from a moving train or experiencing gravity\n\nwhile inside a falling elevator. \"I very rarely think in words at all,\"\n\nhe later told a psychologist. \"A thought comes, and I may try to express\n\nit in words afterwards.\"\n\nEinstein was descended, on both parents' sides, from Jewish tradesmen\n\nand peddlers who had, for at least two centuries, made modest livings in\n\nthe rural villages of Swabia in southwestern Germany. With each\n\ngeneration they had become, or at least so they thought, increasingly\n\nassimilated into the German culture that they loved. Although Jewish by\n\ncultural designation and kindred instinct, they displayed scant interest\n\nin the religion or its rituals.\n\nEinstein regularly dismissed the role that his heritage played in\n\nshaping who he became. \"Exploration of my ancestors,\" he told a friend\n\nlate in life, \"leads nowhere.\" That's not fully true. He was blessed by\n\nbeing born into an independent-minded and intelligent family line that\n\nvalued education, and his life was certainly affected, in ways both\n\nbeautiful and tragic, by membership in a religious heritage that had a\n\ndistinctive intellectual tradition and a history of being both outsiders\n\nand wanderers. Of course, the fact that he happened to be Jewish in\n\nGermany in the early twentieth century made him more of an outsider, and\n\nmore of a wanderer, than he would have preferred -- but that, too,\n\nbecame integral to who he was and the role he would play in world\n\nhistory.\n\nEinstein's father, Hermann, was born in 1847 in the Swabian village of\n\nBuchau, whose thriving Jewish community was just beginning to enjoy the\n\nright to practice any vocation. Hermann showed \"a marked inclination for\n\nmathematics,\" and his family was able to send him seventy-five miles\n\nnorth to Stuttgart for high school. But they could not afford to send\n\nhim to a university, most of which were closed to Jews in any event, so\n\nhe returned home to Buchau to go into trade.\n\nA few years later, as part of the general migration of rural German Jews\n\ninto industrial centers during the late nineteenth century, Hermann and\n\nhis parents moved thirty-five miles away to the more prosperous town of\n\nUlm, which prophetically boasted as its motto \"Ulmenses sunt\n\nmathematici,\" the people of Ulm are mathematicians.\n\nThere he became a partner in a cousin's featherbed company. He was\n\n\"exceedingly friendly, mild and wise,\" his son would recall. With a\n\ngentleness that blurred into docility, Hermann was to prove inept as a\n\nbusinessman and forever impractical in financial matters. But his\n\ndocility did make him well suited to be a genial family man and good\n\nhusband to a strong-willed woman. At age 29, he married Pauline Koch,\n\neleven years his junior.\n\nPauline's father, Julius Koch, had built a considerable fortune as a\n\ngrain dealer and purveyor to the royal Württemberg court. Pauline\n\ninherited his practicality, but she leavened his dour disposition with a\n\nteasing wit edged with sarcasm and a laugh that could be both infectious\n\nand wounding (traits she would pass on to her son). From all accounts,\n\nthe match between Hermann and Pauline was a happy one, with her strong\n\npersonality meshing \"in complete harmony\" with her husband's passivity.\n\nTheir first child was born at 11:30 a.m. on Friday, March 14, 1879, in\n\nUlm, which had recently joined, along with the rest of Swabia, the new\n\nGerman Reich. Initially, Pauline and Hermann had planned to name the boy\n\nAbraham, after his paternal grandfather. But they came to feel, he later\n\nsaid, that the name sounded \"too Jewish.\" So they kept the initial A and\n\nnamed him Albert Einstein.\n\nMunich\n\nIn 1880, just a year after Albert's birth, Hermann's featherbed business\n\nfoundered and he was persuaded to move to Munich by his brother Jakob,\n\nwho had opened a gas and electrical supply company there. Jakob, the\n\nyoungest of five siblings, had been able to get a higher education,\n\nunlike Hermann, and he had qualified as an engineer. As they competed\n\nfor contracts to provide generators and electrical lighting to\n\nmunicipalities in southern Germany, Jakob was in charge of the technical\n\nside while Hermann provided a modicum of salesmanship skills plus,\n\nperhaps more important, loans from his wife's side of the family.\n\nPauline and Hermann had a second and final child, a daughter, in\n\nNovember 1881, who was named Maria but throughout her life used instead\n\nthe diminutive Maja. When Albert was shown his new sister for the first\n\ntime, he was led to believe that she was like a wonderful toy that he\n\nwould enjoy. His response was to look at her and exclaim, \"Yes, but\n\nwhere are the wheels?\" It may not have been the most perceptive of\n\nquestions, but it did show that during his third year his language\n\nchallenges did not prevent him from making some memorable comments.\n\nDespite a few childhood squabbles, Maja was to become her brother's most\n\nintimate soul mate.\n\nThe Einsteins settled into a comfortable home with mature trees and an\n\nelegant garden in a Munich suburb for what was to be, at least through\n\nmost of Albert's childhood, a respectable bourgeois existence. Munich\n\nhad been architecturally burnished by mad King Ludwig II (1845-1886) and\n\nboasted a profusion of churches, art galleries, and concert halls that\n\nfavored the works of resident Richard Wagner. In 1882, just after the\n\nEinsteins arrived, the city had about 300,000 residents, 85 percent of\n\nthem Catholics and 2 percent of them Jewish, and it was the host of the\n\nfirst German electricity exhibition, at which electric lights were\n\nintroduced to the city streets.\n\nEinstein's back garden was often bustling with cousins and children. But\n\nhe shied from their boisterous games and instead \"occupied himself with\n\nquieter things.\" One governess nicknamed him \"Father Bore.\" He was\n\ngenerally a loner, a tendency he claimed to cherish throughout his life,\n\nalthough his was a special sort of detachment that was interwoven with a\n\nrelish for camaraderie and intellectual companionship. \"From the very\n\nbeginning he was inclined to separate himself from children his own age\n\nand to engage in daydreaming and meditative musing,\" according to\n\nPhilipp Frank, a longtime scientific colleague.\n\nHe liked to work on puzzles, erect complex structures with his toy\n\nbuilding set, play with a steam engine that his uncle gave him, and\n\nbuild houses of cards. According to Maja, Einstein was able to construct\n\ncard structures as high as fourteen stories. Even discounting the\n\nrecollections of a star-struck younger sister, there was probably a lot\n\nof truth to her claim that \"persistence and tenacity were obviously\n\nalready part of his character.\"\n\nHe was also, at least as a young child, prone to temper tantrums. \"At\n\nsuch moments his face would turn completely yellow, the tip of his nose\n\nsnow-white, and he was no longer in control of himself,\" Maja remembers.\n\nOnce, at age 5, he grabbed a chair and threw it at a tutor, who fled and\n\nnever returned. Maja's head became the target of various hard objects.\n\n\"It takes a sound skull,\" she later joked, \"to be the sister of an\n\nintellectual.\" Unlike his persistence and tenacity, he eventually\n\noutgrew his temper.\n\nTo use the language of psychologists, the young Einstein's ability to\n\nsystemize (identify the laws that govern a system) was far greater than\n\nhis ability to empathize (sense and care about what other humans are\n\nfeeling), which have led some to ask if he might have exhibited mild\n\nsymptoms of some developmental disorder. However, it is important to\n\nnote that, despite his aloof and occasionally rebellious manner, he did\n\nhave the ability to make close friends and to empathize both with\n\ncolleagues and humanity in general.\n\nThe great awakenings that happen in childhood are usually lost to\n\nmemory. But for Einstein, an experience occurred when he was 4 or 5 that\n\nwould alter his life and be etched forever in his mind -- and in the\n\nhistory of science. He was sick in bed one day, and his father brought\n\nhim a compass. He later recalled being so excited as he examined its\n\nmysterious powers that he trembled and grew cold. The fact that the\n\nmagnetic needle behaved as if influenced by some hidden force field,\n\nrather than through the more familiar mechanical method involving touch\n\nor contact, produced a sense of wonder that motivated him throughout his\n\nlife. \"I can still remember -- or at least I believe I can remember --\n\nthat this experience made a deep and lasting impression on me,\" he wrote\n\non one of the many occasions he recounted the incident. \"Something\n\ndeeply hidden had to be behind things.\"\n\n\"It's an iconic story,\" Dennis Overbye noted in Einstein in Love,\n\n\"the young boy trembling to the invisible order behind chaotic reality.\"\n\nIt has been told in the movie IQ, in which Einstein, played by\n\nWalter Matthau, wears the compass around his neck, and it is the focus\n\nof a children's book, Rescuing Albert's Compass, by Shulamith\n\nOppenheim, whose father-in-law heard the tale from Einstein in 1911.\n\nAfter being mesmerized by the compass needle's fealty to an unseen\n\nfield, Einstein would develop a lifelong devotion to field theories as a\n\nway to describe nature. Field theories use mathematical quantities, such\n\nas numbers or vectors or tensors, to describe how the conditions at any\n\npoint in space will affect matter or another field. For example, in a\n\ngravitational or an electromagnetic field there are forces that could\n\nact on a particle at any point, and the equations of a field theory\n\ndescribe how these change as one moves through the region. The first\n\nparagraph of his great 1905 paper on special relativity begins with a\n\nconsideration of the effects of electrical and magnetic fields; his\n\ntheory of general relativity is based on equations that describe a\n\ngravitational field; and at the very end of his life he was doggedly\n\nscribbling further field equations in the hope that they would form the\n\nbasis for a theory of everything. As the science historian Gerald Holton\n\nhas noted, Einstein regarded \"the classical concept of the field the\n\ngreatest contribution to the scientific spirit.\"\n\nHis mother, an accomplished pianist, also gave him a gift at around the\n\nsame time, one that likewise would last throughout his life. She\n\narranged for him to take violin lessons. At first he chafed at the\n\nmechanical discipline of the instruction. But after being exposed to\n\nMozart's sonatas, music became both magical and emotional to him. \"I\n\nbelieve that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty,\" he said,\n\n\"at least for me.\"\n\nSoon he was playing Mozart duets, with his mother accompanying him on\n\nthe piano. \"Mozart's music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a\n\nreflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself,\" he later told a\n\nfriend. \"Of course,\" he added in a remark that reflected his view of\n\nmath and physics as well as of Mozart, \"like all great beauty, his music\n\nwas pure simplicity.\"\n\nMusic was no mere diversion. On the contrary, it helped him think.\n\n\"Whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or faced a\n\ndifficult challenge in his work,\" said his son Hans Albert, \"he would\n\ntake refuge in music and that would solve all his difficulties.\" The\n\nviolin thus proved useful during the years he lived alone in Berlin,\n\nwrestling with general relativity. \"He would often play his violin in\n\nhis kitchen late at night, improvising melodies while he pondered\n\ncomplicated problems,\" a friend recalled. \"Then, suddenly, in the middle\n\nof playing, he would announce excitedly, 'I've got it!' As if by\n\ninspiration, the answer to the problem would have come to him in the\n\nmidst of music.\"\n\nHis appreciation for music, and especially for Mozart, may have\n\nreflected his feel for the harmony of the universe. As Alexander\n\nMoszkowski, who wrote a biography of Einstein in 1920 based on\n\nconversations with him, noted, \"Music, Nature, and God became\n\nintermingled in him in a complex of feeling, a moral unity, the trace of\n\nwhich never vanished.\"\n\nThroughout his life, Albert Einstein would retain the intuition and the\n\nawe of a child. He never lost his sense of wonder at the magic of\n\nnature's phenomena -- magnetic fields, gravity, inertia, acceleration,\n\nlight beams -- which grown-ups find so commonplace. He retained the\n\nability to hold two thoughts in his mind simultaneously, to be puzzled\n\nwhen they conflicted, and to marvel when he could smell an underlying\n\nunity. \"People like you and me never grow old,\" he wrote a friend later\n\nin life. \"We never cease to stand like curious children before the great\n\nmystery into which we were born.\"\n\nSchool\n\nIn his later years, Einstein would tell an old joke about an agnostic\n\nuncle, who was the only member of his family who went to synagogue. When\n\nasked why he did so, the uncle would respond, \"Ah, but you never know.\"\n\nEinstein's parents, on the other hand, were \"entirely irreligious\" and\n\nfelt no compulsion to hedge their bets. They did not keep kosher or\n\nattend synagogue, and his father referred to Jewish rituals as \"ancient\n\nsuperstitions.\"\n\nConsequently, when Albert turned 6 and had to go to school, his parents\n\ndid not care that there was no Jewish one near their home. Instead he\n\nwent to the large Catholic school in their neighborhood, the\n\nPetersschule. As the only Jew among the seventy students in his class,\n\nEinstein took the standard course in Catholic religion and ended up\n\nenjoying it immensely. Indeed, he did so well in his Catholic studies\n\nthat he helped his classmates with theirs.\n\nOne day his teacher brought a large nail to the class. \"The nails with\n\nwhich Jesus was nailed to the cross looked like this,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Einstein later said that he felt no discrimination from\n\nthe teachers. \"The teachers were liberal and made no distinction based\n\non denominations,\" he wrote. His fellow students, however, were a\n\ndifferent matter. \"Among the children at the elementary school,\n\nanti-Semitism was prevalent,\" he recalled.\n\nBeing taunted on his walks to and from school based on \"racial\n\ncharacteristics about which the children were strangely aware\" helped\n\nreinforce the sense of being an outsider, which would stay with him his\n\nentire life. \"Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school\n\nwere frequent, but for the most part not too vicious. Nevertheless, they\n\nwere sufficient to consolidate, even in a child, a lively sense of being\n\nan outsider.\"\n\nWhen he turned 9, Einstein moved up to a high school near the center of\n\nMunich, the Luitpold Gymnasium, which was known as an enlightened\n\ninstitution that emphasized math and science as well as Latin and Greek.\n\nIn addition, the school supplied a teacher to provide religious\n\ninstruction for him and other Jews.\n\nDespite his parents' secularism, or perhaps because of it, Einstein\n\nrather suddenly developed a passionate zeal for Judaism. \"He was so\n\nfervent in his feelings that, on his own, he observed Jewish religious\n\nstrictures in every detail,\" his sister recalled. He ate no pork, kept\n\nkosher dietary laws, and obeyed the strictures of the Sabbath, all\n\nrather difficult to do when the rest of his family had a lack of\n\ninterest bordering on disdain for such displays. He even composed his\n\nown hymns for the glorification of God, which he sang to himself as he\n\nwalked home from school.\n\nOne widely held belief about Einstein is that he failed math as a\n\nstudent, an assertion that is made, often accompanied by the phrase \"as\n\neveryone knows,\" by scores of books and thousands of websites designed\n\nto reassure underachieving students. It even made it into the famous\n\n\"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" newspaper column.\n\nAlas, Einstein's childhood offers history many savory ironies, but this\n\nis not one of them. In 1935, a rabbi in Princeton showed him a clipping\n\nof the Ripley's column with the headline \"Greatest Living Mathematician\n\nFailed in Mathematics.\" Einstein laughed. \"I never failed in\n\nmathematics,\" he replied, correctly. \"Before I was fifteen I had\n\nmastered differential and integral calculus.\"\n\nIn fact, he was a wonderful student, at least intellectually. In primary\n\nschool, he was at the top of his class. \"Yesterday Albert got his\n\ngrades,\" his mother reported to an aunt when he was 7. \"Once again he\n\nwas ranked first.\" At the gymnasium, he disliked the mechanical learning\n\nof languages such as Latin and Greek, a problem exacerbated by what he\n\nlater said was his \"bad memory for words and texts.\" But even in these\n\ncourses, Einstein consistently got top grades. Years later, when\n\nEinstein celebrated his fiftieth birthday and there were stories about\n\nhow poorly the great genius had fared at the gymnasium, the school's\n\ncurrent principal made a point of publishing a letter revealing how good\n\nhis grades actually were.\n\nAs for math, far from being a failure, he was \"far above the school\n\nrequirements.\" By age 12, his sister recalled, \"he already had a\n\npredilection for solving complicated problems in applied arithmetic,\"\n\nand he decided to see if he could jump ahead by learning geometry and\n\nalgebra on his own. His parents bought him the textbooks in advance so\n\nthat he could master them over summer vacation. Not only did he learn\n\nthe proofs in the books, he tackled the new theories by trying to prove\n\nthem on his own. \"Play and playmates were forgotten,\" she noted. \"For\n\ndays on end he sat alone, immersed in the search for a solution, not\n\ngiving up before he had found it.\"\n\nHis uncle Jakob Einstein, the engineer, introduced him to the joys of\n\nalgebra. \"It's a merry science,\" he explained. \"When the animal that we\n\nare hunting cannot be caught, we call it X temporarily and\n\ncontinue to hunt until it is bagged.\" He went on to give the boy even\n\nmore difficult challenges, Maja recalled, \"with good-natured doubts\n\nabout his ability to solve them.\" When Einstein triumphed, as he\n\ninvariably did, he \"was overcome with great happiness and was already\n\nthen aware of the direction in which his talents were leading him.\"\n\nAmong the concepts that Uncle Jakob threw at him was the Pythagorean\n\ntheorem (the square of the lengths of the legs of a right triangle add\n\nup to the square of the length of the hypotenuse). \"After much effort I\n\nsucceeded in 'proving' this theorem on the basis of the similarity of\n\ntriangles,\" Einstein recalled. Once again he was thinking in pictures.\n\n\"It seemed to me 'evident' that the relations of the sides of the\n\nright-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of\n\nthe acute angles.\"\n\nMaja, with the pride of a younger sister, called Einstein's Pythagorean\n\nproof \"an entirely original new one.\" Although perhaps new to him, it is\n\nhard to imagine that Einstein's approach, which was surely similar to\n\nthe standard ones based on the proportionality of the sides of similar\n\ntriangles, was completely original. Nevertheless, it did show Einstein's\n\nyouthful appreciation that elegant theorems can be derived from simple\n\naxioms -- and the fact that he was in little danger of failing math. \"As\n\na boy of 12, I was thrilled to see that it was possible to find out\n\ntruth by reasoning alone, without the help of any outside experience,\"\n\nhe told a reporter from a high school newspaper in Princeton years\n\nlater. \"I became more and more convinced that nature could be understood\n\nas a relatively simple mathematical structure.\"\n\nEinstein's greatest intellectual stimulation came from a poor medical\n\nstudent who used to dine with his family once a week. It was an old\n\nJewish custom to take in a needy religious scholar to share the Sabbath\n\nmeal; the Einsteins modified the tradition by hosting instead a medical\n\nstudent on Thursdays. His name was Max Talmud (later changed to Talmey,\n\nwhen he immigrated to the United States), and he began his weekly visits\n\nwhen he was 21 and Einstein was 10. \"He was a pretty, dark-haired boy,\"\n\nremembered Talmud. \"In all those years, I never saw him reading any\n\nlight literature. Nor did I ever see him in the company of schoolmates\n\nor other boys his age.\"\n\nTalmud brought him science books, including a popular illustrated series\n\ncalled People's Books on Natural Science, \"a work which I read\n\nwith breathless attention,\" said Einstein. The twenty-one little volumes\n\nwere written by Aaron Bernstein, who stressed the interrelations between\n\nbiology and physics, and he reported in great detail the scientific\n\nexperiments being done at the time, especially in Germany.\n\nIn the opening section of the first volume, Bernstein dealt with the\n\nspeed of light, a topic that obviously fascinated him. Indeed, he\n\nreturned to it repeatedly in his subsequent volumes, including eleven\n\nessays on the topic in volume 8. Judging from the thought experiments\n\nthat Einstein later used in creating his theory of relativity,\n\nBernstein's books appear to have been influential.\n\nFor example, Bernstein asked readers to imagine being on a speeding\n\ntrain. If a bullet is shot through the window, it would seem that it was\n\nshot at an angle, because the train would have moved between the time\n\nthe bullet entered one window and exited the window on the other side.\n\nLikewise, because of the speed of the earth through space, the same must\n\nbe true of light going through a telescope. What was amazing, said\n\nBernstein, was that experiments showed the same effect no matter how\n\nfast the source of the light was moving. In a sentence that, because of\n\nits relation to what Einstein would later famously conclude, seems to\n\nhave made an impression, Bernstein declared, \"Since each kind of light\n\nproves to be of exactly the same speed, the law of the speed of light\n\ncan well be called the most general of all of nature's laws.\"\n\nIn another volume, Bernstein took his young readers on an imaginary trip\n\nthrough space. The mode of transport was the wave of an electric signal.\n\nHis books celebrated the joyful wonders of scientific investigation and\n\nincluded such exuberant passages as this one written about the\n\nsuccessful prediction of the location of the new planet Uranus: \"Praised\n\nbe this science! Praised be the men who do it! And praised be the human\n\nmind, which sees more sharply than does the human eye.\"\n\nBernstein was, as Einstein would later be, eager to tie together all of\n\nnature's forces. For example, after discussing how all electromagnetic\n\nphenomena, such as light, could be considered waves, he speculated that\n\nthe same may be true for gravity. A unity and simplicity, Bernstein\n\nwrote, lay beneath all the concepts applied by our perceptions. Truth in\n\nscience consisted in discovering theories that described this underlying\n\nreality. Einstein later recalled the revelation, and the realist\n\nattitude, that this instilled in him as a young boy: \"Out yonder there\n\nwas this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and\n\nwhich stands before us like a great, eternal riddle.\"\n\nYears later, when they met in New York during Einstein's first visit\n\nthere, Talmud asked what he thought, in retrospect, of Bernstein's work.\n\n\"A very good book,\" he said. \"It has exerted a great influence on my\n\nwhole development.\"\n\nTalmud also helped Einstein continue to explore the wonders of\n\nmathematics by giving him a textbook on geometry two years before he was\n\nscheduled to learn that subject in school. Later, Einstein would refer\n\nto it as \"the sacred little geometry book\" and speak of it with awe:\n\n\"Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three\n\naltitudes of a triangle in one point, which -- though by no means\n\nevident -- could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any\n\ndoubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty\n\nmade an indescribable impression upon me.\" Years later, in a lecture at\n\nOxford, Einstein noted, \"If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful\n\nenthusiasm, then you were not born to be a scientific thinker.\"\n\nWhen Talmud arrived each Thursday, Einstein delighted in showing him the\n\nproblems he had solved that week. Initially, Talmud was able to help\n\nhim, but he was soon surpassed by his pupil. \"After a short time, a few\n\nmonths, he had worked through the whole book,\" Talmud recalled. \"He\n\nthereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics...Soon the flight of his\n\nmathematical genius was so high that I could no longer follow.\"\n\nSo the awed medical student moved on to introducing Einstein to\n\nphilosophy. \"I recommended Kant to him,\" he recalled. \"At that time he\n\nwas still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works,\n\nincomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\" Kant\n\nbecame, for a while, Einstein's favorite philosopher, and his\n\nCritique of Pure Reason eventually led him to delve also into\n\nDavid Hume, Ernst Mach, and the issue of what can be known about\n\nreality.\n\nEinstein's exposure to science produced a sudden reaction against\n\nreligion at age 12, just as he would have been readying for a bar\n\nmitzvah. Bernstein, in his popular science volumes, had reconciled\n\nscience with religious inclination. As he put it, \"The religious\n\ninclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all\n\nnature, including the humans in it, is in no way an accidental game, but\n\na work of lawfulness, that there is a fundamental cause of all\n\nexistence.\"\n\nEinstein would later come close to these sentiments. But at the time,\n\nhis leap away from faith was a radical one. \"Through the reading of\n\npopular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in the\n\nstories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively\n\nfanatic orgy of f reethinking coupled with the impression that youth is\n\nintentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a\n\ncrushing impression.\"\n\nAs a result, Einstein avoided religious rituals for the rest of his\n\nlife. \"There arose in Einstein an aversion to the orthodox practice of\n\nthe Jewish or any traditional religion, as well as to attendance at\n\nreligious services, and this he has never lost,\" his friend Philipp\n\nFrank later noted. He did, however, retain from his childhood religious\n\nphase a profound reverence for the harmony and beauty of what he called\n\nthe mind of God as it was expressed in the creation of the universe and\n\nits laws.\n\nEinstein's rebellion against religious dogma had a profound effect on\n\nhis general outlook toward received wisdom. It inculcated an allergic\n\nreaction against all forms of dogma and authority, which was to affect\n\nboth his politics and his science. \"Suspicion against every kind of\n\nauthority grew out of this experience, an attitude which has never again\n\nleft me,\" he later said. Indeed, it was this comfort with being a\n\nnonconformist that would define both his science and his social thinking\n\nfor the rest of his life.\n\nHe would later be able to pull off this contrariness with a grace that\n\nwas generally endearing, once he was accepted as a genius. But it did\n\nnot play so well when he was merely a sassy student at a Munich\n\ngymnasium. \"He was very uncomfortable in school,\" according to his\n\nsister. He found the style of teaching -- rote drills, impatience with\n\nquestioning -- to be repugnant. \"The military tone of the school, the\n\nsystematic training in the worship of authority that was supposed to\n\naccustom pupils at an early age to military discipline, was particularly\n\nunpleasant.\"\n\nEven in Munich, where the Bavarian spirit engendered a less regimented\n\napproach to life, this Prussian glorification of the military had taken\n\nhold, and many of the children loved to play at being soldiers. When\n\ntroops would come by, accompanied by fifes and drums, kids would pour\n\ninto the streets to join the parade and march in lockstep. But not\n\nEinstein. Watching such a display once, he began to cry. \"When I grow\n\nup, I don't want to be one of those poor people,\" he told his parents.\n\nAs Einstein later explained, \"When a person can take pleasure in\n\nmarching in step to a piece of music it is enough to make me despise\n\nhim. He has been given his big brain only by mistake.\"\n\nThe opposition he felt to all types of regimentation made his education\n\nat the Munich gymnasium increasingly irksome and contentious. The\n\nmechanical learning there, he complained, \"seemed very much akin to the\n\nmethods of the Prussian army, where a mechanical discipline was achieved\n\nby repeated execution of meaningless orders.\" In later years, he would\n\nliken his teachers to members of the military. \"The teachers at the\n\nelementary school seemed to me like drill sergeants,\" he said, \"and the\n\nteachers at the gymnasium like lieutenants.\"\n\nHe once asked C. P. Snow, the British writer and scientist, whether he\n\nwas familiar with the German word Zwang. Snow allowed that he\n\nwas; it meant constraint, compulsion, obligation, coercion. Why? In his\n\nMunich school, Einstein answered, he had made his first strike against\n\nZwang, and it had helped define him ever since.\n\nSkepticism and a resistance to received wisdom became a hallmark of his\n\nlife. As he proclaimed in a letter to a fatherly friend in 1901, \"A\n\nfoolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth.\"\n\nThroughout the six decades of his scientific career, whether leading the\n\nquantum revolution or later resisting it, this attitude helped shape\n\nEinstein's work. \"His early suspicion of authority, which never wholly\n\nleft him, was to prove of decisive importance,\" said Banesh Hoffmann,\n\nwho was a collaborator of Einstein's in his later years. \"Without it he\n\nwould not have been able to develop the powerful independence of mind\n\nthat gave him the courage to challenge established scientific beliefs\n\nand thereby revolutionize physics.\"\n\nThis contempt for authority did not endear him to the German\n\n\"lieutenants\" who taught him at his school. As a result, one of his\n\nteachers proclaimed that his insolence made him unwelcome in class. When\n\nEinstein insisted that he had committed no offense, the teacher replied,\n\n\"Yes, that is true, but you sit there in the back row and smile, and\n\nyour mere presence here spoils the respect of the class for me.\"\n\nEinstein's discomfort spiraled toward depression, perhaps even close to\n\na nervous breakdown, when his father's business suffered a sudden\n\nreversal of fortune. The collapse was a precipitous one. During most of\n\nEinstein's school years, the Einstein brothers' company had been a\n\nsuccess. In 1885, it had two hundred employees and provided the first\n\nelectrical lights for Munich's Oktoberfest. Over the next few years, it\n\nwon the contract to wire the community of Schwabing, a Munich suburb of\n\nten thousand people, using gas motors to drive twin dynanamos that the\n\nEinsteins had designed. Jakob Einstein received six patents for\n\nimprovements in arc lamps, automatic circuit breakers, and electric\n\nmeters. The company was poised to rival Siemens and other power\n\ncompanies then flourishing. To raise capital, the brothers mortgaged\n\ntheir homes, borrowed more than 60,000 marks at 10 percent interest, and\n\nwent deeply in debt.\n\nBut in 1894, when Einstein was 15, the company went bust after it lost\n\ncompetitions to light the central part of Munich and other locations. His\n\nparents and sister, along with Uncle Jakob, moved to northern Italy --\n\nfirst Milan and then the nearby town of Pavia -- where the company's\n\nItalian partners thought there would be more fertile territory for a smaller\n\nfirm. Their elegant home was torn down by a developer to build an apartment\n\nblock. Einstein was left behind in Munich, at the house of a distant\n\nrelative, to finish his final three years of school.\n\nIt is not quite clear whether Einstein, in that sad autumn of 1894, was\n\nactually forced to leave the Luitpold Gymnasium or was merely politely\n\nencouraged to leave. Years later, he recalled that the teacher who had\n\ndeclared that his \"presence spoils the respect of the class for me\" had\n\ngone on to \"express the wish that I leave the school.\" An early book by a\n\nmember of his family said that it was his own decision. \"Albert increasingly\n\nresolved not to remain in Munich, and he worked out a plan.\"\n\nThat plan involved getting a letter from the family doctor, Max Talmud's\n\nolder brother, who certified that he was suffering from nervous exhaustion.\n\nHe used this to justify leaving the school at Christmas vacation in 1894\n\nand not returning. Instead, he took a train across the Alps to Italy and\n\ninformed his \"alarmed\" parents that he was never going back to Germany.\n\nInstead, he promised, he would study on his own and attempt to gain\n\nadmission to a technical college in Zurich the following autumn.\n\nThere was perhaps one other factor in his decision to leave Germany. Had he\n\nremained there until he was 17, just over a year away, he would have been\n\nrequired to join the army, a prospect that his sister said \"he contemplated\n\nwith dread.\" So, in addition to announcing that he would not go back to\n\nMunich, he would soon ask for his father's help in renouncing his German\n\ncitizenship.\n\nAarau\n\nEinstein spent the spring and summer of 1895 living with his parents in\n\ntheir Pavia apartment and helping at the family firm. In the process, he\n\nwas able to get a good feel for the workings of magnets, coils, and\n\ngenerated electricity. Einstein's work impressed his family. On one\n\noccasion, Uncle Jakob was having problems with some calculations for a\n\nnew machine, so Einstein went to work on it. \"After my assistant engineer\n\nand I had been racking our brain for days, that young sprig had got the\n\nwhole thing in just fifteen minutes,\" Jakob reported to a friend. \"You\n\nwill hear of him yet.\"\n\nWith his love of the sublime solitude found in the mountains, Einstein\n\nhiked for days in the Alps and Apennines, including an excursion from Pavia\n\nto Genoa to see his mother's brother Julius Koch. Wherever he traveled in\n\nnorthern Italy, he was delighted by the non-Germanic grace and \"delicacy\"\n\nof the people. Their \"naturalness\" was a contrast to the \"spiritually\n\nbroken and mechanically obedient automatons\" of Germany, his sister\n\nrecalled.\n\nEinstein had promised his family that he would study on his own to get\n\ninto the local technical college, the Zurich Polytechnic. So he bought\n\nall three volumes of Jules Violle's advanced physics text and copiously\n\nnoted his ideas in the margins. His work habits showed his ability to\n\nconcentrate, his sister recalled. \"Even in a large, quite noisy group,\n\nhe could withdraw to the sofa, take pen and paper in hand, set the\n\ninkstand precariously on the armrest, and lose himself so completely in\n\na problem that the conversation of many voices stimulated rather than\n\ndisturbed him.\"\n\nThat summer, at age 16, he wrote his first essay on theoretical physics,\n\nwhich he titled \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a\n\nMagnetic Field.\" The topic was important, for the notion of the ether\n\nwould play a critical role in Einstein's career. At the time, scientists\n\nconceived of light simply as a wave, and so they assumed that the universe\n\nmust contain an all-pervasive yet unseen substance that was doing the\n\nrippling and thus propagating the waves, just as water was the medium\n\nrippling up and down and thus propagating the waves in an ocean. They\n\ndubbed this the ether, and Einstein (at least for the time being) went\n\nalong with the assumption. As he put it in his essay, \"An electric current\n\nsets the surrounding ether in a kind of momentary motion.\"\n\nThe fourteen-paragraph handwritten paper echoed Violle's textbook as well\n\nas some of the reports in the popular science magazines about Heinrich\n\nHertz's recent discoveries about electromagnetic waves. In it, Einstein\n\nmade suggestions for experiments that could explain \"the magnetic field\n\nformed around an electric current.\" This would be interesting, he argued,\n\n\"because the exploration of the elastic state of the ether in this case\n\nwould permit us a look into the enigmatic nature of electric current.\"\n\nThe high school dropout freely admitted that he was merely making a few\n\nsuggestions without knowing where they might lead. \"As I was completely\n\nlacking in materials that would have enabled me to delve into the subject\n\nmore deeply than by merely meditating about it, I beg you not to interpret\n\nthis circumstance as a mark of superficiality,\" he wrote.\n\nHe sent the paper to his uncle Caesar Koch, a merchant in Belgium, who was\n\none of his favorite relatives and occasionally a financial patron. \"It is\n\nrather nai;ve and imperfect, as might be expected from such a young\n\nfellow like myself,\" Einstein confessed with a pretense of humility. He\n\nadded that his goal was to enroll the following fall at the Zurich\n\nPolytechnic, but he was concerned that he was younger than the age\n\nrequirement. \"I should be at least two years older.\"\n\nTo help him get around the age requirement, a family friend wrote to the\n\ndirector of the Polytechnic, asking for an exception. The tone of the letter\n\ncan be gleaned from the director's response, which expressed skepticism\n\nabout admitting this \"so-called 'child prodigy.' \" Nevertheless, Einstein\n\nwas granted permission to take the entrance exam, and he boarded the train\n\nfor Zurich in October 1895 \"with a sense of well-founded diffidence.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, he easily passed the section of the exam in math and\n\nscience. But he failed to pass the general section, which included\n\nsections on literature, French, zoology, botany, and politics. The\n\nPolytechnic's head physics professor, Heinrich Weber, suggested that\n\nEinstein stay in Zurich and audit his classes. Instead, Einstein\n\ndecided, on the advice of the college's director, to spend a year\n\npreparing at the cantonal school in the village of Aarau, twenty-five\n\nmiles to the west.\n\nIt was a perfect school for Einstein. The teaching\n\nwas based on the philosophy of a Swiss educational reformer of the early\n\nnineteenth century, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who believed in\n\nencouraging students to visualize images. He also thought it important\n\nto nurture the \"inner dignity\" and individuality of each child. Students\n\nshould be allowed to reach their own conclusions, Pestalozzi preached,\n\nby using a series of steps that began with hands-on observations and\n\nthen proceeded to intuitions, conceptual thinking, and visual imagery.\n\nIt was even possible to learn -- and truly understand -- the laws of\n\nmath and physics that way. Rote drills, memorization, and force-fed\n\nfacts were avoided.\n\nEinstein loved Aarau. \"Pupils were treated individually,\" his sister\n\nrecalled, \"more emphasis was placed on independent thought than on\n\npunditry, and young people saw the teacher not as a figure of authority,\n\nbut, alongside the student, a man of distinct personality.\" It was the\n\nopposite of the German education that Einstein had hated. \"When compared\n\nto six years' schooling at a German authoritarian gymnasium,\" Einstein\n\nlater said, \"it made me clearly realize how much superior an education\n\nbased on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on\n\noutward authority.\"\n\nThe visual understanding of concepts, as stressed by Pestalozzi and his\n\nfollowers in Aarau, became a significant aspect of Einstein's genius.\n\n\"Visual understanding is the essential and only true means of teaching\n\nhow to judge things correctly,\" Pestalozzi wrote, and \"the learning of\n\nnumbers and language must be definitely subordinated.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, it was at this school that Einstein first engaged in\n\nthe visualized thought experiment that would help make him the greatest\n\nscientific genius of his time: he tried to picture what it would be like\n\nto ride alongside a light beam. \"In Aarau I made my first rather childish\n\nexperiments in thinking that had a direct bearing on the Special Theory,\"\n\nhe later told a friend. \"If a person could run after a light wave with the\n\nsame speed as light, you would have a wave arrangement which could be\n\ncompletely independent of time. Of course, such a thing is impossible.\"\n\nThis type of visualized thought experiments -- Gedankenexperiment\n\n-- became a hallmark of Einstein's career. Over the years, he would picture\n\nin his mind such things as lightning strikes and moving trains,\n\naccelerating elevators and falling painters, two-dimensional blind beetles\n\ncrawling on curved branches, as well as a variety of contraptions designed\n\nto pinpoint, at least in theory, the location and velocity of speeding\n\nelectrons.\n\nWhile a student in Aarau, Einstein boarded with a wonderful family, the\n\nWintelers, whose members would long remain entwined in his life. There\n\nwas Jost Winteler, who taught history and Greek at the school; his wife,\n\nRosa, soon known to Einstein as Mamerl, or Mama; and their seven children.\n\nTheir daughter Marie would become Einstein's first girlfriend. Another\n\ndaughter, Anna, would marry Einstein's best friend, Michele Besso. And\n\ntheir son Paul would marry Einstein's beloved sister, Maja.\n\n\"Papa\" Jost Winteler was a liberal who shared Einstein's allergy\n\nto German militarism and to nationalism in general. His edgy honesty and\n\npolitical idealism helped to shape Einstein's social philosophy. Like\n\nhis mentor, Einstein would become a supporter of world federalism,\n\ninternationalism, pacifism, and democratic socialism, with a strong\n\ndevotion to individual liberty and freedom of expression.\n\nMore important, in the warm embrace of the Winteler family, Einstein became\n\nmore secure and personable. Even though he still fancied himself a\n\nloner, the Wintelers helped him flower emotionally and open himself to\n\nintimacy. \"He had a great sense of humor and at times could laugh\n\nheartily,\" recalled daughter Anna. In the evenings he would sometimes\n\nstudy, \"but more often he would sit with the family around the table.\"\n\nEinstein had developed into a head-turning teenager who possessed, in\n\nthe words of one woman who knew him, \"masculine good looks of the type\n\nthat played havoc at the turn of the century.\" He had wavy dark hair,\n\nexpressive eyes, a high forehead, and jaunty demeanor. \"The lower half\n\nof his face might have belonged to a sensualist who found plenty of\n\nreasons to love life.\"\n\nOne of his schoolmates, Hans Byland, later wrote a striking description\n\nof \"the impudent Swabian\" who made such a lasting impression. \"Sure of\n\nhimself, his gray felt hat pushed back on his thick, black hair, he strode\n\nenergetically up and down in the rapid, I might say crazy, tempo of a\n\nrestless spirit which carries a whole world in itself. Nothing escaped the\n\nsharp gaze of the large bright brown eyes. Whoever approached him was\n\ncaptivated by his superior personality. A mocking curl of his fleshy mouth\n\nwith its protruding lower lip did not encourage Philistines to fraternize\n\nwith him.\"\n\nMost notably, Byland added, young Einstein had a sassy, sometimes\n\nintimidating wit. \"He confronted the world spirit as a laughing\n\nphilosopher, and his witty sarcasm mercilessly castigated all vanity and\n\nartificiality.\"\n\nEinstein fell in love with Marie Winteler at the end of 1895, just a few\n\nmonths after he moved in with her parents. She had just completed teacher\n\ntraining college and was living at home while waiting to take a job in a\n\nnearby village. She was just turning 18, he was still 16. The romance\n\nthrilled both families. Albert and Marie sent New Year's greetings to\n\nhis mother; she replied warmly, \"Your little letter, dear Miss Marie,\n\nbrought me immense joy.\"\n\nThe following April, when he was back home in Pavia for spring break,\n\nEinstein wrote Marie his first known love letter:\n\nBeloved sweetheart!\n\nMany, many thanks sweetheart for your charming little letter, which made\n\nme endlessly happy. It was so wonderful to be able to press to one's\n\nheart such a bit of paper which two so dear little eyes have lovingly\n\nbeheld and on which the dainty little hands have charmingly glided back\n\nand forth. I was now made to realize, my little angel, the meaning of\n\nhomesickness and pining. But love brings much happiness -- much more so\n\nthan pining brings pain...\n\nMy mother has also taken you to her heart, even though she does not know\n\nyou; I only let her read two of your charming little letters. And she\n\nalways laughs at me because I am no longer attracted to the girls who\n\nwere supposed to have enchanted me so much in the past. You mean more to\n\nmy soul than the whole world did before.\n\nTo which his mother penned a postscript: \"Without having read this letter,\n\nI send you cordial greetings!\"\n\nAlthough he enjoyed the school in Aarau, Einstein turned out to be an\n\nuneven student. His admission report noted that he needed to do remedial\n\nwork in chemistry and had \"great gaps\" in his knowledge of French. By\n\nmidyear, he still was required to \"continue with private lessons in French\n\n& chemistry,\" and \"the protest in French remains in effect.\" His father\n\nwas sanguine when Jost Winteler sent him the midyear report. \"Not all its\n\nparts fulfill my wishes and expectations,\" he wrote, \"but with Albert I\n\ngot used to finding mediocre grades along with very good ones, and I am\n\ntherefore not disconsolate about them.\"\n\nMusic continued to be a passion. There were nine violinists in his class,\n\nand their teacher noted that they suffered from \"some stiffness in bowing\n\ntechnique here and there.\" But Einstein was singled out for praise: \"One\n\nstudent, by the name of Einstein, even sparkled by rendering an adagio\n\nfrom a Beethoven sonata with deep understanding.\" At a concert in the\n\nlocal church, Einstein was chosen to play first violin in a piece by\n\nBach. His \"enchanting tone and incomparable rhythm\" awed the second\n\nviolinist, who asked, \"Do you count the beats?\" Einstein replied,\n\n\"Heavens no, it's in my blood.\"\n\nHis classmate Byland recalled Einstein playing a Mozart sonata with such\n\npassion -- \"What fire there was in his playing!\" -- that it seemed like\n\nhearing the composer for the first time. Listening to him, Byland realized\n\nthat Einstein's wisecracking, sarcastic exterior was a shell around a\n\nsofter inner soul. \"He was one of those split personalities who know how\n\nto protect, with a prickly exterior, the delicate realm of their intense\n\npersonal life.\"\n\nEinstein's contempt for Germany's authoritarian schools and militarist\n\natmosphere made him want to renounce his citizenship in that country.\n\nThis was reinforced by Jost Winteler, who disdained all forms of\n\nnationalism and instilled in Einstein the belief that people should\n\nconsider themselves citizens of the world. So he asked his father to\n\nhelp him drop his German citizenship. The release came through in\n\nJanuary 1896, and for the time being he was stateless.\n\nHe also that year became a person without a religious affiliation. In\n\nthe application to renounce his German citizenship, his father had\n\nwritten, presumably at Albert's request, \"no religious denomination.\" It\n\nwas a statement Albert would also make when applying for Zurich residency\n\na few years later, and on various occasions over the ensuing two decades.\n\nHis rebellion from his childhood fling with ardent Judaism, coupled with\n\nhis feelings of detachment from Munich's Jews, had alienated him from his\n\nheritage. \"The religion of the fathers, as I encountered it in Munich\n\nduring religious instruction and in the synagogue, repelled rather than\n\nattracted me,\" he later explained to a Jewish historian. \"The Jewish\n\nbourgeois circles that I came to know in my younger years, with their\n\naffluence and lack of a sense of community, offered me nothing that\n\nseemed to be of value.\"\n\nLater in life, beginning with his exposure to virulent anti-Semitism in\n\nthe 1920s, Einstein would begin to reconnect with his Jewish identity.\n\n\"There is nothing in me that can be described as a 'Jewish faith,' \" he\n\nsaid, \"however I am happy to be a member of the Jewish people.\" Later he\n\nwould make the same point in more colorful ways. \"The Jew who abandons his\n\nfaith,\" he once said, \"is in a similar position to a snail that abandons\n\nhis shell. He is still a snail.\"\n\nHis renunciation of Judaism in 1896 should, therefore, be seen not as a\n\nclean break but as part of a lifelong evolution of his feelings about\n\nhis cultural identity. \"At that time I would not even have understood\n\nwhat leaving Judaism could possibly mean,\" he wrote a friend the year\n\nbefore he died. \"But I was fully aware of my Jewish origin, even though\n\nthe full significance of belonging to Jewry was not realized by me until\n\nlater.\"\n\nEinstein ended his year at the Aarau school in a manner that would have\n\nseemed impressive for anyone except one of history's great geniuses,\n\nscoring the second highest grades in his class. (Alas, the name of the\n\nboy who bested Einstein is lost to history.) On a 1 to 6 scale, with 6\n\nbeing the highest, he scored a 5 or 6 in all of his science and math\n\ncourses as well as in history and Italian. His lowest grade was a 3, in\n\nFrench.\n\nThat qualified him to take a series of exams, written and oral, that\n\nwould permit him, if he passed, to enter the Zurich Polytechnic. On his\n\nGerman exam, he did a perfunctory outline of a Goethe play and scored a 5.\n\nIn math, he made a careless mistake, calling a number \"imaginary\" when he\n\nmeant \"irrational,\" but still got a top grade. In physics, he arrived late\n\nand left early, completing the two-hour test in an hour and fifteen\n\nminutes; he got the top grade. Altogether, he ended up with a 5.5, the best\n\ngrade among the nine students taking the exams.\n\nThe one section on which he did poorly was French. But his three-paragraph\n\nessay was, to those of us today, the most interesting part of all of his\n\nexams. The topic was \"Mes Projets d'avenir,\" my plans for the future.\n\nAlthough the French was not memorable, the personal insights were:\n\nIf I am lucky and pass my exams, I will enroll in the Zurich Polytechnic.\n\nI will stay there four years to study mathematics and physics. I suppose\n\nI will become a teacher in these fields of science, opting for the\n\ntheoretical part of these sciences.\n\nHere are the reasons that have led me to this plan. They are, most of\n\nall, my personal talent for abstract and mathematical thinking...My\n\ndesires have also led me to the same decision. That is quite natural;\n\neverybody desires to do that for which he has a talent. Besides, I am\n\nattracted by the independence offered by the profession of science.\n\nIn the summer of 1896, the Einstein brothers' electrical business again\n\nfailed, this time because they bungled getting the necessary water rights\n\nto build a hydroelectric system in Pavia. The partnership was dissolved\n\nin a friendly fashion, and Jakob joined a large firm as an engineer. But\n\nHermann, whose optimism and pride tended to overwhelm any prudence,\n\ninsisted on opening yet another new dynamo business, this time in Milan.\n\nAlbert was so dubious of his father's prospects that he went to his\n\nrelatives and suggested that they not finance him again, but they did.\n\nHermann hoped that Albert would someday join him in the business, but\n\nengineering held little appeal for him. \"I was originally supposed to\n\nbecome an engineer,\" he later wrote a friend, \"but the thought of having\n\nto expend my creative energy on things that make practical everyday life\n\neven more refined, with a bleak capital gain as the goal, was unbearable\n\nto me. Thinking for its own sake, like music!\" And thus he headed off to\n\nthe Zurich Polytechnic.\n\nCopyright © 2007 by Walter Isaacson\n\nLibrary of Congress subject headings for this publication:\n\nEinstein, Albert, -- 1879-1955.\n\nPhysicists -- Biography.\n\nEinstein, Albert, -- 1879-1955 -- Friends and associates.\n\nRelativity (Physics)\n\nUnified field theories."
