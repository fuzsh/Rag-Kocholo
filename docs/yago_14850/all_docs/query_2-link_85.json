        "text": "Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in WÃ¼rttemberg, in Germany on 14th March 1879. His father was Hermann Einstein and his mother was Pauline Koch. Hermann Einstein was a salesman and engineer.\n\nPauline, who was a talented musician, introduced Albert to the piano and then studied the violin, which was his passion, from the age of 6 to 13.\n\nIn 1881, Einstein had a sister called Maria. She was Albert's closest childhood friend.\n\nBefore starting school, Albert discovered an interest in science and probelm-solving. Einstein formally started school at the age of six. He was taught in the Petersschule on Blumenstrasse, a Catholic elementary school in Munich.\n\nEinstein worked very well in school, although he was very quiet and stayed away from his peers.\n\nWhen he was the age of 10, Albert was accepted into the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, a formal and respected institution that emphasized Latin and Greek over mathematics and science. But he turned to a course of personal study outside of school as he was unhappy with the edcational program at his school.\n\nHis Uncle Jakob lent him a book of algebra and sent him math puzzles to solve. Also a man called Max Talmud, a friend of the Einstein family, who was a medical student lent him books on popular science and philosophy that the young boy eagerly ravaged."
