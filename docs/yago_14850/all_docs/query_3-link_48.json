        "text": "Written by: Daksh Verma, Richard Xu, Andrew Xia, Clement Li\n\nWhen you hear the name “Albert Einstein” what do you think about? Do you think about his contributions to mathematics and sciences such as E=mc² or the theory of relativity? Or do you think of a genius, possibly one of the smartest men who walked this earth? Or do you think about what hair products he used to get his hair to become the epitome of chaos? Behind the brilliant scientific mind of Einstein, lies another intriguing personality. Regardless, here are 10 Fun Facts about Einstein that you might have never known about.\n\n1. ALBERT EINSTEIN WAS THOUGHT TO BE STUPID\n\nPerhaps one of the better known obscure facts about him, Einstein was thought to be mentally deficient by his parents. When he was first born, his head was abnormally large and misshapen. In addition to this, he didn’t begin to speak until he was four years old and didn’t speak in full sentences until he was nine, leading his parents to believe that he was “mentally retarded” (Koczela, 2014, para. 1 & 2).\n\nMoreover, there have been many claims that he was a failing student. some of these claims have been found to be false such as Einstein failing math and physics. In fact, it was found that Einstein only failed the non-science subjects (language, botany, zoology) but excelled at math and physics with flying colours (Roos, n.d.).\n\n“I never failed in mathematics. Before I was 15 I had mastered differential and integral calculus”\n\n- Einstein (Roos, n.d.).\n\n3. EINSTEIN WAS QUITE THE PLAYER\n\nEinstein was extremely popular with the girls. He had rotating relationships with more than ten different women throughout his life; he frequently had more than two mistresses at a time (The Telegraph, 2017). There was one Margarete, one Toni, one Estel, one… nevermind, there are too many to count (Alok, 2006).\n\n4. THE FBI RECORDED A… REALLY LONG FILE ON EINSTEIN\n\nRight before Einstein’s 3rd visit to the United States in 1933, the FBI decided to start making a file on him (Andrews, 2015). This file would end up spanning 1,427 pages, focusing mostly on his pacifist affiliations. The POTUS at the time, J. Edgar Hoover, wanted Einstein to never be able to visit America again, but that was overturned in court (Walsh, 2020).\n\n5. EINSTEIN LOVED CLASSICAL MUSIC\n\nEinstein was an adept musician and was also deeply fond of classical music. He began to learn to play the violin at the early age of five. Fun fact: Einstein once threw a chair at his music teacher because of the pressure and the stress during violin practice. In addition to playing the violin, Einstein also learned to play the piano with his mother, Pauline Koch, as his teacher. On a more serious note, he fell in love with Mozart’s music when he was thirteen. In fact, said, “Mozart’s music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe” (Chandler & Mahboob, 2017, para. 4).\n\n6. ONE OF HIS KIDS WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED FOR MOST OF THEIR LIFE\n\nAlbert’s second son, Eduard, a.k.a “Tete”, suffered from schizophrenia for his whole life. Despite this, Tete was a great fan of the work of Sigmund Freud. He would never see his father ever again after Einstein immigrated to the United States in 1933.\n\n7. EINSTEIN BELIEVED THAT VEGETARIANISM WAS GOOD\n\nYes, you heard it all you carnivores out there. Einstein advocated the progression of the human race towards a vegetarian diet. He wrote in a letter to Max Kariel about his guilt of eating meat: “I have always eaten animal flesh with somewhat of a guilty conscience.” He also said that vegetarianism was necessary for human survival and progress.\n\n“Nothing will benefit health or increase chances of survival on earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.”\n\n- Einstein (Albert Einstein, n.d.).\n\n8. HE ALMOST BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF ISRAEL\n\nEinstein was always vocal in terms of speaking for anti-semitism. So when the Israeli head of state Chaim Weizmann passed away in 1952, they offered Einstein the chance to become their 2nd president in national history. Einstein immediately refused the offer, writing them a letter that said “All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack the aptitude and experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official function” (Lewis, 2020).\n\n9. HE STUDIED A PARROT’S EMOTIONS IN HIS LATER LIFE\n\nIn Einstein’s dwindling years, he was interested in a depressed parrot, and used it as an experiment subject, by trying to tell it jokes and make it feel in a better mood (Lewis, 2020).\n\n10. ALBERT EINSTEIN HAD HIS BRAIN TAKEN WHEN HE DIED\n\nEinstein sadly passed away from an abdominal aortic aneurysm in April of 1955. However, the Princeton pathologist, during Einstein’s autopsy, removed the genius’ famous brain intending to extract from it the secrets of Einstein’s brilliance (Andrews, 2015).\n\nLater on, for further research and study, Einstein’s brain was divided into its respective parts and sent off to a number of scientists. Multiple studies have been conducted and multiple conclusions and theories have been reached, but each one has been disproven thus far (Andrews, 2015).\n\nWORKS CITED\n\nAlbert Einstein was a vegetarian Scientist.
