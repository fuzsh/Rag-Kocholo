        "text": "1879\n\nBorn to Hermann Einstein (a featherbed salesman) and his wife Pauline in Ulm, Germany.\n\n1884\n\nReceives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the natural world.\n\n1889\n\nSettles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.\n\n1894\n\nStays on in Munich to finish the school year after his parents move to Pavia, Italy. Lasts only one term on his own and then follows his family to Italy.\n\n1895\n\nAttempts to skip high school by taking an entrance exam to the Swiss Polytechnic, a top technical university, but fails the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school.\n\n1896\n\nGraduates from high school at age 17 and enrolls at the ETH (the Federal Polytechnic School) in Zurich.\n\n1898\n\nFalls in love with Mileva Maric, a Serbian classmate at the ETH.\n\n1900\n\nGraduates from the ETH.\n\n1901\n\nBecomes a Swiss citizen and, unemployed, searches for work. Meets Maric in northern Italy for a tryst, and she becomes pregnant. In the fall, he finds work in Schaffhausen, Switzerland as a tutor. Maric, visibly pregnant, moves to Stein am Rhein, three miles upriver. She then returns to her parents' home to give birth to her child. Einstein moves to Bern.\n\n1902\n\nIn January, Maric gives birth to their daughter, Lieserl, whom they eventually put up for adoption. Lieserl reportedly becomes ill, and then all record of her disappears. Einstein takes a job at the Swiss Patent Office. Hermann Einstein becomes ill and dies.\n\n1903\n\nMarries Maric in January.\n\n1904\n\nMaric gives birth to their first son, Hans Albert.\n\n1905\n\nPublishes, at age 26, five groundbreaking papers, making this his \"annus mirabilis,\" or miracle year. One of the papers introduces his special theory of relativity and another E = mc2.\n\n1906\n\nContinues working as an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.\n\n1907\n\nBegins applying the laws of gravity to his special theory of relativity.\n\n1910\n\nSon Eduard is born.\n\n1911\n\nMoves with his family to Prague, where he is given a full professorship at the German University there. Attends the invitation-only Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first world physics conference; he is the youngest physicist there.\n\n1912\n\nMoves with his family to Zurich, where he becomes a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH.\n\n1913\n\nWorks on his new theory of gravity.\n\n1914\n\nBecomes director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and professor of theoretical physics at the University of Berlin. Maric and the children move there in April, but they return to Zurich after three months. Divorce proceedings begin. In August, World War I begins.\n\n1915\n\nCompletes the general theory of relativity.\n\n1917\n\nCollapses from exhaustion and falls seriously ill. Nursed back to health by his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. Publishes his first paper on cosmology.\n\n1919\n\nMarries Löwenthal. On May 29, a solar eclipse provides proof of the general theory of relativity.\n\n1922\n\nAwarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921.\n\n1927\n\nAttends fifth Solvay Conference and begins developing the foundation of quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr.\n\n1928\n\nBegins pursuing his idea of a unified field theory.\n\n1932\n\nAs a Jew, begins to feel the heat of Nazi Germany. Now, at 53, at the height of his fame.\n\n1933\n\nSets sail with Löwenthal for the United States. Settles with her in Princeton, New Jersey, where he assumes a post at the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n1936\n\nLöwenthal dies after a brief illness.\n\n1939\n\nWrites a famous letter to President Franklin Roosevelt not long after the start of World War II that warns of the possibility of Germany's building an atomic bomb and urges nuclear research.\n\n1940\n\nBecomes an American citizen (retains his Swiss citizenship).\n\n1949\n\nEx-wife Maric dies.\n\n1955\n\nDies of heart failure on April 18."
