        "text": "Einstein's parents.\n\nThe somewhat careworn portrait of Hermann Einstein depicts him in his early 50s, and shows the effects of financial worries after the failure of his electrical business in Munich and subsequent struggles with a second concern in Milan. He died from heart failure on 10 October 1902.\n\nA later hand has dated the photograph of Pauline Einstein to 1919, at which date, already ill with cancer, she was living in a sanatorium in Lucerne, close to her daughter Maja. At the end of that year, Albert Einstein brought his mother to live with him in Berlin, where she died on 20 February 1920.\n\nPost Lot Text\n\nTemporary Admission Regime\n\nThis lot has been imported from outside the EU for sale and placed under the Temporary Admission regime.\n\nImport VAT is payable at 5% on the hammer price.
