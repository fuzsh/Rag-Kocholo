In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. In the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after being targeted by the German Nazi Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Early Life &amp; Family</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, W&uuml;rttemberg, Germany. Einstein grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein &amp; Cie, a Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Einstein&rsquo;s mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja, born two years after him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Einstein attended elementary school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he felt alienated there and struggled with the institution&#39;s rigid pedagogical style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also had what were considered speech challenges, though he developed a passion for classical music and playing the violin, which would stay with him into his later years. Most significantly, Einstein&#39;s youth was marked by deep inquisitiveness and inquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of the 1880s, Max Talmud, a Polish medical student who sometimes dined with the Einstein family, became an informal tutor to young Einstein. Talmud had introduced his pupil to a children&rsquo;s science text that inspired Einstein to dream about the nature of light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, during his teens, Einstein penned what would be seen as his first major paper, &quot;The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hermann Einstein relocated the family to Milan, Italy, in the mid-1890s after his business lost out on a major contract. Einstein was left at a relative&#39;s boarding house in Munich to complete his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with military duty when he turned of age, Einstein allegedly withdrew from classes, using a doctor&rsquo;s note to excuse himself and claim nervous exhaustion.

Einstein was also the recipient of much scrutiny and major distrust from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nAfter learning of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, Einstein became a major player in efforts to curtail usage of the a-bomb. The following year he and Szilard founded the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, and in 1947, via an essay for The Atlantic Monthly, Einstein espoused working with the United Nations to maintain nuclear weapons as a deterrent to conflict.\n\nEinstein’s Brain\n\nDuring Einstein’s autopsy, pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed his brain, reportedly without his family's consent, for preservation and future study by doctors of neuroscience.\n\nHowever, during his life, Einstein participated in brain studies, and at least one biography claimed he hoped researchers would study his brain after he died. Einstein's brain is now located at the Princeton University Medical Center. In keeping with his wishes, the rest of his body was cremated and the ashes scattered in a secret location.\n\nIn 1999, Canadian scientists who were studying Einstein’s brain found that his inferior parietal lobe, the area that processes spatial relationships, 3D-visualization, and mathematical thought, was 15 percent wider than in people who possess normal intelligence. According to The New York Times, the researchers believe it may help explain why Einstein was so intelligent.\n\nLegacy\n\nSince Einstein’s death, a veritable mountain of books has been written on the iconic thinker's life, including Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson and Einstein: A Biography by Jürgen Neffe, both from 2007. Einstein's own words are presented in the collection The World As I See It.\n\nIn 2018, a team of scientists confirmed one aspect of Einstein's general theory of relativity, that the light from a star passing close to a black hole would be stretched to longer wavelengths by the overwhelming gravitational field.\n\nTracking star S2, their measurements indicated that the star's orbital velocity increased to over 25 million kph as it neared the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, its appearance shifting from blue to red as its wavelengths stretched to escape the pull of gravity.\n\nSource: Biography"
