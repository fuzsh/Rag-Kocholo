        "text": "In 1905, as an unknown young physicist employed at the Berne Patent Office, he published his theory of special relativity. In it he incorporated, in a simple theoretical framework based on simple physical postulates, concepts and phenomena previously studied by Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz. As a logical consequence of this theory, he derived the most popularly known physics equation: the mass-energy equivalence, E = mc². That year, he published other works that would lay some of the foundations of statistical physics and quantum mechanics.\n\nIn 1915, he presented the theory of general relativity, in which he completely reformulated the concept of gravity. One of the consequences was the emergence of the scientific study of the origin and evolution of the universe by the branch of physics called cosmology. In 1919, when British observations of a solar eclipse confirmed his predictions about the bending of light, he was idolized by the press. Einstein became a world-famous popular icon of science, a privilege available to very few scientists.\n\nFor his explanations about the photoelectric effect and his numerous contributions to theoretical physics, in 1921 he obtained the Nobel Prize in Physics and not because of the Theory of Relativity, since the scientist who was entrusted with the task of evaluating it did not understand it, and they feared running the risk that it would later be proven wrong. At that time it was still considered somewhat controversial.\n\nFaced with the rise of Nazism, Einstein left Germany in December 1932 for the United States, where he dedicated himself to teaching at the Institute for Advanced Study. He became an American citizen in 1940. During his last years he worked to integrate gravitational and electromagnetic forces into the same theory.\n\nAlthough considered by some to be the “father of the atomic bomb,” he advocated global federalism, internationalism, pacifism, Zionism, and democratic socialism, with a strong devotion to individual liberty and freedom of expression. He was proclaimed “person of the 20th century” and the most preeminent scientist by the magazine Team.\n\nBirth: March 14, 1879 – Ulm (Germany)\n\nDied: April 18, 1955 (76 years old), Princeton (New Jersey, USA)\n\nCause of death: Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n\nNationality: American (since 1940), German (1918-1933), Austro-Hungarian (1911-1912), Swiss (since 1901), Without nationality (1896-1901), German (until 1896)\n\nReligion: Agnostic\n\nFamily: Parents Hermann Einstein, Pauline Koch\n\nSpouse: Elsa Einstein (since 1919), Mileva Maric (1903-1919)\n\nChildren: Hans Albert, Eduard and Lieserl\n\nEducation: Doctorate in Physics and Doctor in Philosophy\n\nEducated at: Federal Polytechnic School of Zurich\n\nOccupation: Theoretical physicist, mathematician, diplomat and professor\n\nArea: Quantum physics\n\nKnown for: Theory of relativity and photoelectric effect\n\nDistinctions: Nobel Prize in Physics (1921)\n\nChildhood\n\nHe was born in the German city of Ulm, one hundred kilometers east of Stuttgart, into a Jewish family. His parents were Hermann Einstein and Pauline Koch. Hermann and Pauline had married in 1876, when Hermann was almost twenty-nine years old and she was eighteen. Pauline's family lived near Stuttgart, specifically in the city of Cannstatt; There her father, Julius Koch, operated a very prosperous grain trade with his brother Heinrich. Pauline played the piano and passed on to her son her love for music, among other qualities such as her “perseverance and patience.” From her father, Hermann, he also inherited certain characters such as generosity and kindness that characterized Albert.\n\nIn 1880 the family moved to Munich, where he would grow up for fourteen years, and his father and his brother, Jakob, who influenced Albert intellectually, founded a company dedicated to the installation of water and gas in October. As the business was going well, with the support of the entire family they decided to open their own electrical appliance workshop (Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie.), which supplied power plants in Munich-Schwabing, Varese and Susa in Italy, which would fail after putting the entire family in debt. This caused trauma not only to Albert but also to the rest of the family. In order to pay off the debts and finance the move, the beloved garden of the Munich house was sold to a real estate developer.\n\nFrom the beginning, he showed some difficulty in expressing himself, since he did not begin to speak until he was three years old, so he appeared to have some delay that would cause him some problems. Unlike his younger sister, Maya, who was more lively and cheerful, Albert was patient and methodical and did not like to show off. He usually avoided the company of other children his age and although, as children, they also had their differences from time to time, he only admitted his sister to her solitude. He completed his primary studies in a Catholic school; From 1888 he attended the Luitpold secondary school (which in 1965 would receive the name Albert Einstein Gymnasium). He got good grades in general, not so much in language subjects, but excellent in natural sciences. Aaron Bernstein's popular science books marked his interest and his future career. It was a difficult period that he would endure thanks to the violin lessons (starting in 1884) that his mother would give him (an instrument that he was passionate about and that he continued to play for the rest of his days) and the introduction to algebra that his uncle Jakob would discover to him. ​ His time at the Gymnasium (high school), however, was not very rewarding: the rigidity and military discipline of the secondary schools of Otto von Bismarck's time earned him many controversies with the teachers: at the Luitpold Gymnasium things came to a head in 1894, when Einstein was fifteen years old. A new professor, Dr. Joseph Degenhart, told him that “he would never achieve anything in life.” When Einstein responded that he “had not committed any crime,” the professor replied: “your mere presence here undermines the respect that the class owes me.”\n\nHis uncle, Jakob Einstein, an engineer with great inventiveness and ideas, convinced Albert's father to build a house with a workshop, where they would carry out new projects and technological experiments of the time in order to obtain profits, but, Because the devices and gadgets they refined and manufactured were products for the future, in the present they lacked buyers and the business failed. Little Albert grew up motivated by the research that was carried out in the workshop and all the devices there. Furthermore, his uncle encouraged his scientific interests by providing him with science books. According to Einstein himself in his autobiography, reading these popular scientific books would lead to constant questioning of the claims of religion; a determined freethinking that was associated with other forms of rejection of the State and authority. A rare skepticism at that time, according to Einstein himself. School did not motivate him, and although he was excellent in mathematics and physics, he was not interested in other subjects. At the age of fifteen, without a tutor or guide, he undertook the study of infinitesimal calculus. The clearly unfounded idea that he was a bad student comes from the first biographers who wrote about Einstein, who confused the Swiss school grading system (a 6 in Switzerland is the best grade) with the German one (a 6 is the worst). note).\n\nIn 1894, the Hermann company was suffering significant financial difficulties and the Einsteins moved from Munich to Pavia, Italy, near Milan. Albert remained in Munich to finish his courses before joining his family in Pavia, but the separation did not last long: before obtaining his bachelor's degree he decided to leave the Gymnasium. Without consulting his parents, Albert contacted a doctor (the older brother of Max Talmud, a medical student who went to Einstein's parents' house every Friday to eat) to certify that he was suffering from exhaustion and He needed time out of school, and convinced a teacher to certify his excellence in the field of mathematics. The school authorities let him go. Just after Christmas 1894, Albert left Munich and went to Milan to join his parents.\n\nPart 2 will be published on 21/12/2022\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
