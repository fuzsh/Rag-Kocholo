Why has Rosa Parks turned into such a prominent figure in the segregation discussion? The answer is a certain experience ranging from an epiphany to a mentally agonizing occurrence, from a radiant expression to an ordinary happening, or even a single decision creating a particular incident. Any event can potentially set someone up for the future; it is the medium to the days of tomorrow. A certain experience may not seem to have much of an impact on people in the time ahead, but in reality, it is crucial in serving as motivation to achieving the final goal.\n\nThe theme of balance and change is a big factor in the stories. balance and change in the terms and meaning of, for every action there is a reaction and for everything good there is something bad the stories balance and change by rebecca matthews, follow this theme very closely in the fact that they have their ups and downs in the story. And change is when something is replaced by something else, either better or worse. The subject of change and balance examines the precarious balance between conflicting forces and the inevitable course of change. It explores the relationship between flux and stability, highlighting how progress and well-being depend on preserving harmony in the face of change.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. As a child, he lived a comfortable life with luxuries due to his mother's fortune. As a child, he attended a catholic school and wrote his first novel at the age of 13. His claim to fame was writing the Great Gatsby, where he started to be known as a real writer and wrote many other great pieces of writing that were later appreciated. It gained popularity due to its description of the 1920’s. After this, he became a heavy drinker which led to alcoholism and he began to have many problems such wife who began to have mental problems. Some of his contributions to society are his work of the Great Gatsby is read by every High School, that is transforming generations through literature. Albert Einstein would get along with F. Scott Fitzgerald because Einstein likes reading books and they can converse about The Great Gatsby and his ideas on how he came up with the book and probably give him some ideas.\n\nEinstein was born in Ulm Germany in 1879 and when to ETH Zurich from 1897 to 1900, then to the University of Zurich in 1905. After school he married a women by the name of Mileva Marić from 1903 to 1919 then to Elsa Einstein from 1919 until 1936, Einstein had three children named Eduard Einstein, Lieserl Einstein, and Hans Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein helped the U.S. government during World War 2. Einstein was visiting the U.S. during the rise Adolf Hitler and Einstein being jewish did not return to Germany so in 1941 when the U.S. entered the war President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted Einstein help with a nuclear bomb so Einstein helped the United States government. Albert Died on the 18th of April 1955.\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Wüttemberg in the German Empire, on March 14, 1879. He was an Ashkenazi Jew that attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of 5 for three years. At the age of 8, Albert was transferred to Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Alber Einstein Gymnasium). This is where he had received advanced primary and secondary school education. He had left the German Empire seven years later. Due his father losing his job, the Einstein family moved to Italy in search of jobs. Einstein continued to\n\nThe reason why his parents left Germany because Albert’s father was a businessman so his father had a business in Milan. So Albert stayed in Germany just to finish high school. But in school Einstein was only good in math and science but in the other subjects he was not good at. Then Albert quit high school in Germany and also lost his German citizenship and went to Switzerland to finish high school. After finishing high school Albert applied for a college called Swiss Federal Polytechnic Institute. The first Einstein took the exam he failed. Einstein waited a year to take the exam again and this time he passed the exam. Albert later started to study math and science with some people that later became his friends. Einstein graduated out of college in 1900 but the two years that came were too difficult for Albert. He wanted to teach math and science in college but never found a job in a college. Lucky in 1902 Albert got a job in Swiss patent office. It was a place that where people could their ideas and the people that worked there to make the new\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Germany on March 14,1879. He began his schooling at Luitpold Gymnasium. His family later moved to Italy where he continued his education in Switzerland where he trained to be a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901 , is the year he gained his diploma he also received his swiss citizenship.Then he received his doctor's degree in 1905. In 1909 he became the professor of Zurich. In 1911 he was appointed director with Kaiser Wilhelm.\n\nAlbert Einstein began his influential life at a young age. Growing up Einstein was a gifted child, he excelled in a number of subjects such as mathematics, science, and music. He also played multiple instruments and won several academic awards. Having such an educated childhood Einstein benefitted more than the children around him. He had gained knowledge as a kid that would carry him into his adulthood. Albert Einstein decided he wanted to be a philosophy teacher, but his father, Hermann Einstein, convinced him to be an electrical engineer. So he applied to a college in Switzerland called Zurich Polytechnic, because did not finishing high school, they regretted to inform that they were not going to be able to accept him. But because since his math and physics scores were so high on the exam, once he finished high school he would be immediately accepted. So Einstein went back to high school in Aarau.\n\nOne of the most famous scientists ever known is Albert Einstein and he has contributed a lot to society. Many have said that Albert Einstein might’ve been the best mathematician the world has ever seen. Albert Einstein was conceived at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Einstein's endowments unavoidably brought about his abode much in scholarly isolation and, for unwinding, music had an essential influence in his life. He wedded Mileva Maric in 1903 and they had a little girl and two children; their marriage was broken up in 1919 and around the same time he wedded his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who kicked the bucket in 1936.\n\nAlbert Einstein is considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. He is known for developing the theories of relativity. He is also noted for his mathematical formula of E = mc² (David Bodanis). Although he was not directly involved in the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for creating the atomic bomb, but he is still considered the mastermind because of his breakthrough formula. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect (A. Calaprice & T. Lipscombe).\n\nALBERT EINSTEIN Albert Einstein was born March 14, 1879 in Germany. His family owned a small business that manufactured electric machinery. The business failed and they left Germany. Albert was fifteen years old and he dropped out of school. When Albert was five when he received his first compass and he began to investigate the world. Little did he know that that compass would make him famous.\n\nManagement is key when running any type of business. You must know everything that goes into management.
