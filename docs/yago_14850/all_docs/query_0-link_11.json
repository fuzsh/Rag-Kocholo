        "text": "Albert Einstein's Parents -\n\nHermann and Pauline Koch Einstein\n\nWere married in 1876.\n\nPauline - a young maiden just eighteen years,\n\nWhile Hermann, a twenty-nine years old man.\n\nIt was a happy marriage!\n\nWhen Albert was born to the couple\n\nIn southern German town of Ulm,\n\nOn a Friday, in 1879,\n\nTheir joy knew no bounds!\n\nThey welcomed their little bundle of joy,\n\nWith great celebration in their hearts!\n\nPapa Hermann looked at his son, most lovingly\n\nFor the first time, after the birth of his eldest child,\n\nLike every affectionate father would do with doting eyes.\n\nAt that time, Hermann had no inkling that his little boy\n\nWould be, in future, declared as a genius\n\nAnd become a celebrity scientist of this world.\n\nWhat the Parents were more concerned, at birth,\n\nWas that the baby was born with a large head\n\nAngular in shape, different from normal babies.\n\nHowever, their doctor dismissed it,\n\nAs no cause for worry and assured the Parents\n\nThat the head would soon become a normal size.\n\nTwo years later, in 1881, a little girl was born\n\nTo Hermann and Pauline. They named her Maja.\n\nThey introduced Albert to his baby sister\n\nAs somebody whom he can play with.\n\nAlbert, two and half years old, asked his parents:\n\n'Yes, but where are its wheels? '\n\nAlbert and Maja were raised with much care and affection\n\nIn a congenial atmosphere of close family bonding!\n\nThough both Parents were of Jewish origin,\n\nThey prioritised education above religion,\n\nInculcating a deep desire in their children,\n\nFor higher learning, education and valuable knowledge!\n\nA Biographical Poem"
