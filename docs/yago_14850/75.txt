Hermann Einstein (30 August 1847 – 10 October 1902) was the father of Albert Einstein. Hermann Einstein (also known as Hermann Moos) was born in Buchau, Kingdom of Württemberg to Abraham Einstein and Helene Moos (3 July 1814 – 20 August 1887).

Hermann married 18-year-old Pauline Koch in Cannstatt, Kingdom of Württemberg on 8 August 1876. After their wedding, the young couple lived in Ulm, where Hermann became joint partner in the feather bed shop of his cousins, Moses and Hermann Levi. In Ulm, their eldest son Albert was born on 14 March 1879. On the initiative of Hermann's brother Jakob, the family moved to Munich in the summer of 1880. There, the two brothers founded the electrical engineering company "Einstein & Cie", with Hermann being the merchant and Jakob the technician. The second child of Hermann and Pauline, their daughter Maria (called Maja), was born in Munich on 18 November 1881.
