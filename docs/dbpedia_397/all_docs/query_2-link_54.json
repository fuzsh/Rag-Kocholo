        "text": "Every film begins life as a fleeting idea—just a spark. It's at this stage you need to harness your creative energy and turn that idea into something real. And brainstorming is the perfect technique for the job.\n\nBrainstorming is a classic creative technique that helps you create lots of ideas in minutes. You can use it to explore the topic for your film, dream up new characters, locations, or even the visual style you're after. It’s best thought of as a way to light up our imagination. As ancient philosopher Plutarch said, “The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.”\n\nWhat's the idea or concept for your film? This is your starting point. It might be just a rough idea at the moment or a topic that you want to explore, but this process will help you see how far you can take it. Add a note that describes the film in 1 to 2 sentences to get started.\n\nNow it's time to get creative. Invite your team and start adding any ideas that relate to your initial concept. Think about the characters, their relationships, the locations you could use, visual styles, and the topic's history. Explore every thread until you fill the board.\n\nDon't worry about evaluating your ideas yet, that will come later. Setting a timer for 5 minutes is a great way to create a sense of urgency and prevent people from judging their thoughts.\n\nSometimes it's easier to communicate an idea with an image or video, especially if it's a mood or style you're trying to express. Gather reference imagery, videos and sound and add them into the mix. These can become the foundation for a moodboard as your film project evolves.\n\nOnce you've explored every idea, the next step is to make connections. This is where you see the magic of brainstorming!\n\nStart by grouping similar ideas to uncover patterns in your thinking. Add a title to each group so it's easy to scan. You might find your ideas fall into groups like characters, costumes, locations or aesthetics but there are no rules about how you do it.\n\nDuring brainstorming, you imagined the different parts of your film. It's time to start exploring some visual directions with a moodboard. Moodboards can help you visualize any aspect of your film. You might want to focus on how the lighting or color could look. Or they could be centered around the set designs or costumes you want to use. You can create a moodboard for each of these separately or mix them all into one board. There are no strict rules.\n\nYour moodboard will also be a fantastic reference for your team—from the director to the costume designer—it helps everyone visualize the end result.\n\nThe imagery you bring into your moodboard helps you express your film's look and feel. Images can define things like tone, cropping, lighting and color.\n\nYou can start by saving visual references from around the web. There are lots of fantastic sites where you can find great visual inspiration for free, like Shotdeck, Instagram, or Pinterest. Don't worry about organizing the images just yet, that step will come later.\n\nOnce you have all your inspiration in one place, the next step is to arrange your ideas to create the perfect layout. Start by exploring composition and introducing hierarchy. Place a key element to anchor your board, and change the size and position of the remaining elements to indicate their importance and relationships to one another.\n\nNow that your moodboard is complete, you have a powerful visual reference for your film. Remember, you can create multiple moodboards to explore different directions at any time.\n\nNext, we'll create a storyboard to map out the key parts of your film.\n\nStoryboards are a powerful way to visually organize the composition, action and look of a film before you start bringing it to life. As director, producer and screenwriter Martin Scorsese said, “The storyboard is the way to visualize the entire movie in advance.”\n\nMany people devote their entire careers to storyboarding as it combines disciplines and techniques such as illustration, writing and production. Traditionally, a storyboard would be created with analog sketches, but with a modern digital tool you can use photography, animation, color and notes to highlight key characters, scenes and objects.\n\nStoryboards aren't just for understanding scenes; they can also be used for a variety of other reasons including:\n\nVisual Planning: Organize the order of a story and flow before filming.\n\nPacing and Timing: Control the narrative's speed.\n\nVisual Composition: Experiment with shots and angles.\n\nPre-visualization: Preview complex scenes or effects.\n\nResource Planning: Plan props, sets, and wardrobes more efficiently.\n\nCollaboration: Align efforts so the crew is working toward the same goal.\n\nPresentations: Convey ideas to clients, investors, and the director.\n\nProblem Solving: Identify and address any issues before filming starts.\n\nContinuity: Maintain uniformity in style and design throughout the film.\n\nWhile each frame is a static image, try to communicate how it's going to look and feel as a moving sequence. Describe the style, mood, and behavior of characters. Consider how the camera will move through the shot and how you'll transition from scene to scene. Add details about the sound to help your team imagine the emotion and drama you're trying to capture.\n\nWhen you're ready, invite your team to review your storyboard and share their feedback. This is the perfect moment to see how others interpret your vision for the story. It's also a great opportunity to make any final tweaks while in pre-production. Adjust the order of your frames or edit the content based on everyone's feedback.\n\nStart by listing the main scenes you'll be filming. Adding reference images or sketches will make your shot list easier to scan—even if they're just rough photos you've taken on your phone. It will also help your crew visualize the type of shots you're planning to capture.\n\nWhat equipment will you need to shoot these scenes? Imagine being half way through filming when you realize the spare battery pack is still in the studio. Adding a simple gear list will ensure you have everything you need on the day. It's a lifesaver!\n\nUse the Film Production Equipment List template if you have lots of gear to keep track of.\n\nTraditionally, you'd print out your shot list to refer to on the day, but digital shot lists can be accessed on phones or laptops. This way, you can check off each shot or adjust it as you need.\n\nNow that your shot list is complete, you have a clear plan for the scenes you need to capture during the shoot.\n\nNext, we'll create a call sheet to schedule your team…\n\nYou may have witnessed a disorganized shoot before—the actors were late, the crew forgot the lighting or the set wasn't ready. One vital document was missing—the call sheet.\n\nThe call sheet is a simple, but incredibly useful tool for organizing your shoot. It outlines everything your talent and crew need to know before the day of the shoot. Crucial elements like the location, contact details, the schedule, and most importantly the arrival time.\n\nAdd background information about the shoot for your talent and crew. Next, add the location of the shoot and any details that will help people arrive safely and on time. Explain where the parking options are, nearby public transport and any details about to get into the building.\n\nWho's involved in your shoot? List your talent and crew along with their contact details. This will save you hunting around for phone numbers when plans inevitably change on the day. Next, add any specific arrival times so each person knows exactly when they're expected.\n\nProbably the most important part is the schedule—specifically the general crew call time. The general crew call time is when everyone needs to arrive on location. Under this, add the key events for the day so everyone can clearly see what's on and when. Don't forget lunch!\n\nOnce you have everything you need, it's time to organize your call sheet so it's easy to scan. Then share it with your team so everyone can start preparing for the shoot."
