        "text": "(Photo by Universal/ courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nHow to Watch Fast & Furious Movies In Order\n\nYou wouldn’t expect a burly international action franchise like Fast & Furious to have the most complicated timeline. Then again, who predicted the 2001 original about some humble street racing would witness its sequels dragging bank vaults across asphalt, jumping out of planes, sliding off submarines, and likely soon making contact with alien life in deep space?\n\nSome of these Fast & Furious sequels are set later in the timeline, even though they were made earlier than others. To watch the F&F movies in chronological order as the events unfolded, you can still start with the first two: The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. Tokyo Drift is the third in the series but actually set way later in the timeline, so you’ll want to skip that and jump to Fast & Furious, Fast Five, and Fast & Furious 6. Then you can watch Tokyo Drift.\n\nAfter that, hop to franchise best Furious 7. Follow it up with The Fate of the Furious and spin-off Hobbs & Shaw and then the latest: F9 and Fast X.\n\nSee below for the full list if you want to watch Fast & Furious movies in order!
