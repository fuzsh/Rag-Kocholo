        "text": "A Quick Introduction to Analogue Photography\n\nThe term âAnalogue Photographyâ refers to photography using an analogue camera and film. A roll of film is loaded into the camera and the magic begins once you start clicking: light interacts with the chemicals in the film and an image is recorded. The pictures collected in your film roll come to life when the film is processed in a photo lab.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a film camera, itâs important to remember that different cameras shoot different kinds of film. Some cameras use 35mm film, some require 110 format film, some shoot 120 (aka âmedium-formatâ) film and some use Instant film. The most common among these choices is 35mm film, which can be processed in your local photo lab, drugstore or supermarket. 35mm film comes in canisters and is characterized by its sprocket holes â little perforations which run along the edge of the film strip. 120 film, on the other hand, is larger and delivers square photos; this film doesnât have sprocket holes. 110 format film is used with pocket cameras and produces small photos. Lastly, Instant photos do not require photo lab processing; they magically develop within a few seconds!\n\nWhatâs So Fun About Analogue Photography?\n\nPop-art icon Andy Warhol was once quoted as saying, âThe idea of waiting for something makes it more exciting,â and it perfectly applies to analogue photography. There is no LCD screen to check your photos and youâll only see what you have captured after the film roll has been processed, scanned and printed. Ask any analogue photography devotee and theyâll tell you that the wait is part of the thrill!\n\nOnce you get into analogue photography, youâre sure to find it creatively fulfilling. Modern-day apps and software have tried to emulate the effects that you get with film photos, but nothing beats the original; itâs more rewarding when you create it yourself rather than with a filter. Of course, the results may vary (depending on the lighting conditions, the film and camera used and the mood of your photo lab operator, etc.) but overall the analogue look is unmistakable. Colors are richer, the saturation is more dramatic (or âwildâ if you wish), and the film grain adds soul and character to your images, they seem to evoke nostalgic and dream-like memories. Experimentation and the thrill of the unknown drive us in our love for analogue.\n\nInstant - Instant photography allows you to enjoy the tactile experience of analogue photography in a swift instant. Itâs a great choice for spontaneous moments; once you click the shutter, the camera ejects the photo which develops in less than a minute. An excellent choice for shooting creative and fun instant photos is the LomoâInstant. What sets this apart from other instant cameras is the creative flexibility that it offers: 3 shooting modes, advanced lens system, multiple exposure function and long-exposure settings. It gives you the freedom to get experimental and see the results instantly."
