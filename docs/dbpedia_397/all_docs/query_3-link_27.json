        "text": "\"Fast X,\" which is set to hit theaters on May 19, will mark the beginning of the end of the Fast and Furious franchise. Initially, the series was meant to wrap up with a two-part finale. However, at the \"Fast X\" premiere in Rome, Italy, on May 12, Vin Diesel, who's led the franchise as Dominic Toretto since 2001, teased the movies could end with a trilogy instead. Although he didn't officially confirm or deny anything, his co-star Michelle Rodriguez (Letty Ortiz) fueled the rumors by telling Fandango, \"It's three acts in any story.\"\n\nIf it's true, then the series will officially end after 13 movies. Castmembers like Diesel, Rodriguez, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, and Ludacris have starred in the majority of the \"Fast and Furious\" films, while Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham led the 2019 spinoff film \"Hobbs & Shaw.\" While talking about the franchise's longevity at the \"Fast X\" premiere, Diesel told the crowd (via Entertainment Weekly), \"'Fast' is now the longest franchise in motion picture historyâ€¦ with the same actors playing the same characters.\"\n\nSince it's been over 20 years since the first film premiered, here's a quick refresher of all of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies so far, including their release dates and plot details.\n\nHow Many \"Fast and Furious\" Movies Are There?\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001)\n\n\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" (2003)\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" (2006)\n\n\"Fast & Furious\" (2009)\n\n\"Fast Five\" (2011)\n\n\"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013)\n\n\"Furious 7\" (2015)\n\n\"The Fate of the Furious\" (2017)\n\n\"Hobbs & Shaw\" (2019)\n\n\"F9\" (2021)\n\n\"Fast X\" (2023)\n\n\"Untitled Fast X Sequel 1\" (2025)\n\n\"Untitled Fast X Sequel 2\"\n\n\"Fast and Furious\" Movies In Order\n\n1. \"The Fast and the Furious\"\n\nLAPD officer Brian O'Conner (Walker) is sent to infiltrate the street racing world to uncover the identities of a heist crew that's been involved in a series of recent carjackings. After befriending street racer Dominic Toretto and falling for his sister, Mia (Brewster), Brian begins questioning his loyalties when he suspects that Dominic and his friends may be the hijackers he's been looking for all along.\n\n2. \"2 Fast 2 Furious\"\n\nSince leaving the LAPD, Brian has moved to Miami, where he participates in illegal street racing. After he gets arrested, the FBI and U.S. Customs Service agree to wipe Brian's criminal record if he can take down the drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser).\n\n3. \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\"\n\nHigh school student Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father in Japan to avoid a prison sentence. While there, he becomes friends with a mechanic named Twinkie (Bow Wow), who introduces him to the world of drift racing.\n\n4. \"Fast & Furious\"\n\nDominic returns to Los Angeles after hearing that his wife, Letty (Rodriguez), died in a car crash. When he begins to investigate her death, he reunites with Brian, who's now an FBI agent. The two team up to avenge Letty and catch the Mexican drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz), whose henchman Fenix Calderon (Laz Alonso) was behind Letty's death.\n\n5. \"Fast Five\"\n\nAfter Brian and Mia free Dominic from a prison bus, the trio recruits a team to help them steal $100 million from drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) in hopes of using the money to start a new life. The mission proves to be more difficult than expected when the group is framed for murder, causing DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) to go on a hunt to arrest them.\n\n6. \"Fast & Furious 6\"\n\nWhen Hobbs reveals that Letty is alive and is now working for a mercenary organization led by special ops soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), Dominic agrees to help apprehend Owen in exchange for his and his crew's amnesty.\n\n7. \"Furious 7\"\n\nDominic and his friends return to the United States after being pardoned for their crimes. Just as they begin getting back to their normal lives, they're forced into action once again when Owen's brother, Deckard Shaw (Statham), tries to get revenge on the team for leaving his brother in a comatose state.\n\n8. \"The Fate of the Furious\"\n\n\"The Fate of the Furious\" introduces Charlize Theron as a criminal mastermind named Cipher, who forces Dominic to become her henchman by holding his ex-girlfriend Elena Neves and their newborn son hostage. Meanwhile, Dominic's friends team up with Hobbs to take down Cipher and figure out why Dominic went rogue.\n\n9. \"Hobbs & Shaw\"\n\nHobbs and Shaw work together to stop super soldier Brixton Lore (Idris Elba) from unleashing a deadly virus that could destroy the entire human population.\n\n10. \"F9\"\n\nNow living a quiet life with his son, Brian, and wife, Letty, Dominic is forced out of retirement to stop his estranged brother, Jakob Toretto (John Cena), from activating a new weapons program called Project Aries, which is a device that can control any weapons system in the world.\n\n11. \"Fast X\"\n\nDante Reyes (Jason Mamoa), the son of Hernan Reyes from \"Fast Five,\" is out for revenge against Dominic and his team for taking out his father and stealing their family's fortune. \"You built such a beautiful life filled with love and family. I never got that chance,\" Dante says in the film's trailer. \"You stole that from me. My future, my family, and now I'm going to break yours piece by piece.\"\n\n12. \"Untitled Fast X Sequel 1\"\n\nNo plot details about the \"Fast X\" sequels have been revealed yet, however, according to The Wrap, Johnson is set to appear in the next film, which is set to premiere in 2025.\n\n13. \"Untitled Fast X Sequel 2\"\n\nIf \"Fast X\" does become a trilogy, then the second sequel will officially mark the end of the main franchise."
