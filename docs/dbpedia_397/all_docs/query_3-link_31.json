This new addition will have you gripped to your seat, no scene shy‚Äôs away from action as more stories unfold and bigger connections between the movies are made.\n\nGood films capture our attention from the beginning and harness our emotions and they become part of our lives. When I was younger it was Harry Potter and now the Fast and Furious series. We relate to them and the characters that are played- our brains make neural connections to the personalities displayed on screen making it effect our wider lives- but what about the narrative?\n\nThe storyline itself is enough to make you want more and more, to see how their lives progress and ultimately to see how things unravel in this action packed story.\n\nOn the bigger picture, we can also learn some valuable career-life lessons from the franchise; some of which are listed here:\n\nFamily. Team. The family narrative has been strong throughout all of the series. No matter where in the world each of the individuals were, they would always come together in the speed of light. They have got a good work and life balance. They know when its time to celebrate and when its time to make an effort and work to protect their family. In Fast 6 we see that the team return to their house, sitting together, cooking and finally making grace and being thankful for each other and everything they have.\n\nFocused Vision. Everyones goal here is common- to remain strong, together and in sync with one another. They never once go off on a tangent and even in tough situations they all come through. Dom (Vin Diesel) organises his life and goals ‚Äúone quarter mile at a time‚Äù. This enables him to set milestones whilst seeing the bigger picture. Make your goals SMART.\n\nWhats done is done. Dom (Vin Diesel) and Han (Sung Kang) continue to remind us that it doesn't matter what decisions were previously made and that we should focus on what is to come rather than dwelling on what has already taken place. We see an emotional encounter in Fast 6 where Brian (Paul Walker) apologises to Dom (Vin Diesel) for what happened to Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) saying that it was his fault. Han famously says ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs simple; you make choices and don‚Äôt look back‚Äù. Take ownership because in the end every decision we once made was a decision we thought was once good.\n\nLeadership. The great thing about all the characters in this franchise is that individually they are all leaders, they know when to step up and when to be a team player. Dom (Vin Diesel) naturally takes this role. Everyone in the ‚Äòfamily‚Äô trusts his instinct. In Furious 7 (without giving away too much) he doesn't mind when others want to step up to the role. He trusts and has faith in the people he works with as well the people in the team trusting him, blindly. Good leaders know the strengths and weaknesses of all the players and they are respectfully given duties that match their abilities.\n\nHeart. ‚ÄòFollowing your heart‚Äô is a big theme in this franchise. We learn not to be afraid of disseminating love to our families and its this bond that keeps everyone together. We also see from the beginning when Brian-undercover cop (Paul Walker) chose to let Dom (Vin Diesel) ‚Äòdisappear‚Äô after committing alleged crimes because he got to see the real side to the story. This action led to Brian being accepted into Dom‚Äôs family in a later film and sets the foundation for many of the concurring themes.\n\nWork your Passion. Brian (Paul Walker) would have been the same guy in a very common uniform if he hadn't followed his passions outside of being a cop. From being that ordinary cop his love for fast cars and commitment to do well, learn and build cars led him to becoming an FBI agent finally, being sought out for him and the wider family to work with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and pursue various missions as they race to risk it all and ultimately ‚ÄòRide or Die‚Äô.\n\nWinning. Brian has always had this element of wanting to win, especially against Dom. In the first movie, after losing the race against Dom and others, Brian says to Dom, ‚ÄúI almost had you‚Äù to which Dom replies \"It doesn't matter whether you win by an inch or a mile. Winning is winning‚Äù. Celebrate your successes and remind yourself of them every so often. Winning is winning.\n\nIn memory of Paul Walker"
