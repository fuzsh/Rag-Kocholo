        "text": "One of the most common questions learners need to know how to form are \"wh\" questions. These are questions that use a question word (that in English typically starts with \"wh\") to get more specific information. Luckily, forming these questions follows a few rules that can help you put words in the right order!\n\nThe first thing you'll need to know is which \"wh\" word you'll need. (Look out: There’s one English \"wh\" word that doesn't actually start with \"wh\"!)\n\nEnglish \"wh\" question word Use this \"wh\" word to ask about a: who person or animal you know (like a pet) what thing, object, idea, or animal you don't really know where place, destination (going to), origin (coming from) when time, day, month, year why reason, excuse, cause how method, style, manner\n\n\"Wh\" questions can also start with phrases with how many (like how many books) or which (like which house).\n\nHere's a complete guide to forming all kinds of \"wh\" questions!\n\nIn this post:\n\n\"Wh\" questions: getting started\n\n\"Wh\" questions with a question word for the subject\n\n\"Wh\" questions with a question word for the object\n\nExamples of \"wh\" questions in English\n\n\"Wh\" questions: getting started\n\nTo form \"wh\" questions in English, you'll need to know if the missing information—and the \"wh\" word that represents that information—is the subject or object. There is one sentence formula for when the missing information is the subject, and different formulas when the missing information is an object.\n\nOne way to find out is to imagine the complete answer to the question and see where the missing information is. If it comes before the verb, it's the subject:\n\n[Sara] came to the party after I left\n\nPossible answer: Sara\n\n\"Wh\" word to replace possible answer: who\n\nLocation of possible answer: before the verb came --> subject\n\nWe are going [to Japan] for our vacation\n\nPossible answer: to Japan\n\n\"Wh\" word to replace possible answer: where\n\nLocation of possible answer: after the verbs are going --> object\n\nWhen the missing information is an object, you'll also need to know what kind of verb is in the sentence—different verbs follow different formulas! Luckily, there are just 2 categories—and they're the same ones you'll look out for in yes/no questions, too!\n\nCategory 1: forms of to be (like am and were), modals (like should and can), and auxiliaries (like has in has gone)\n\nCategory 2: all other verbs!\n\n\"Wh\" questions with a question word for the subject\n\nIf the missing information (and therefore the \"wh\" word) is the subject of the sentence, all you need to do is move the \"wh\" word to the beginning of the sentence. And you're done!\n\n\"Wh\" word (subject) First verb Rest of sentence Who came to the party after I left What is on the table What is burning in the oven Who saw Erica at the movies\n\n\"Wh\" questions with a question word for the object\n\nIf the missing information is an object, things are more complicated. You'll also need to know something about the verb—whether it is a form of to be, a modal, or an auxiliary, or if it's any other verb.\n\nCategory 1: \"wh\" questions with to be, modals, and auxiliaries\n\nIf the missing object is in a sentence with to be, a modal, or an auxiliary:\n\nMove the \"wh\" question word to the beginning of the question\n\nMove the first verb to right after the \"wh\" word\n\nHere, you can also start by figuring out the answer to the question and then work through each step:\n\nWe are going _[where?]_ for our next vacation You can't come to my party _[why?]_ The doctor's appointment is _[when?]_ 1. Move the \"wh\" word to the beginning Where we are going __ for our next vacation Why you can't come to my party __ When the doctor's appointment is __ 2. Move the first verb to right after the question word Where are we __ going __ for our next vacation Why can't you __ come to my party __ When is the doctor's appointment __ __ \"Wh\" question Where are we going for our next vacation? Why can't you come to my party? When is the doctor's appointment?\n\nYou can also imagine the final version of \"wh\" questions with this formula: \"wh\" word + first verb + subject + rest of sentence.\n\n\"Wh\" word (object) First verb (to be, modal, auxiliary) Subject Rest of sentence Who is their sister interviewing When should the flight to Arizona begin boarding How many desserts will you order What had the children been wishing for\n\nCategory 2: \"wh\" questions with all other verbs\n\nIf the missing object is in a sentence with any other verb, make these 3 changes:\n\nMove the \"wh\" word to the beginning of the question\n\nAdd a form of do (do or does for the present tense, did for the past tense)\n\nChange the main verb to the bare form\n\nThere are 3 forms of do that you need to know: do and does for the present tense, and did for the past tense. In questions, this do is different from the verb to do , and it instead means \"Watch out, this is a question!\"\n\nFor Category 2 questions, you'll also need to know the bare form of the main verb. You can find the bare form of English verbs by dropping to from the infinitive. So for the infinitive to walk, the bare form is walk.\n\nHere's how to apply those changes to a sentence, step by step:\n\nYou want to buy _[what?]_ at the store tomorrow He wrote 3 books about _[what?]_ She saw _[who?]_ at the movies 1. Move the \"wh\" word to the beginning What you want to buy __ at the store tomorrow What he wrote 3 books about __ Who she saw __ at the movies 2. Add a form of do What do you want to buy __ at the store tomorrow What did he wrote 3 books about __ Who did she saw __ at the movies 3. Change the main verb to the bare form What do you want to buy __ at the store tomorrow What did he write 3 books about __ Who did she see __ at the movies \"Wh\" question What do you want to buy at the store tomorrow? What did he write 3 books about? Who did she see at the movies?\n\nAnd here is the word order formula:\n\n\"Wh\" word (object) Form of do Subject Bare form of main verb Rest of sentence Where did those cookies come from How does your cat know where the food is When do the owls visit our home Why did the rain have to start today\n\nGet all the information you need with \"wh\" questions!\n\n\"Wh\" questions help learners of all level get the information they need, whether you're on vacation in a new city or taking college classes in another country. Remembering the different word order formulas for English \"wh\" questions will get easier with practice!\n\nExamples of \"wh\" questions in English\n\nQuestion word for the subject\n\nWho can help me make dinner?\n\nWhat is making all that noise?\n\nWho has never been skydiving?\n\nWhat happened to these trees?\n\nWho runs faster than you?\n\nQuestion word for the object\n\nWith to be, modals, and auxiliaries\n\nWhy is the cat hungry again?\n\nWhen should you receive the answer?\n\nHow can you eat so many fries?!\n\nWhere have you been playing chess with Sarah?\n\nWho are you looking for?\n\nWith all other verbs"
