        "text": "Nothing quite gets your adrenaline pumping like the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. The infamous series, with stars including Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker and Gal Gadot, has been around for two decades.\n\nFrom the main franchise and spin-offs to short films and a television show, the \"Fast and Furious\" has enough content to keep anyone occupied.\n\nSo, here is how many “Fast and Furious” movies there are, including the original series and spin offs, as well as the correct order to watch.\n\nHow many 'Fast and Furious' movies are there?\n\nThere are currently 10 films in the main \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. The latest installment, \"Fast X,\" released on May 19, 2023.\n\nThere are other movies in the series, including a \"Hobbs and Shaw\" spin off, its planned sequel and a planned, untitled, woman-led spin-off.\n\nJust curious: We're here to help with life's everyday questions\n\nReview: Vin Diesel's chaotic 'Fast X' stalls out, even with an enjoyably evil Jason Momoa\n\n'Fast and Furious' movies in the order they were released\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious\"\n\nThe first film in the franchise, released in 2001, follows Los Angeles cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), who is tasked to investigate a recent series of automobile hijackings. O'Conner goes undercover and befriends Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who is a suspect in this case of dirty money and big-rig hijacking. O'Conner must then decide where his loyalty lies.\n\n\"2 Fast 2 Furious\"\n\nIn the 2003 sequel, after relocating to Miami, O'Conner goes back undercover with his friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) to take down a drug lord to erase the pair's criminal records.\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\"\n\nThe third film is a standalone sequel to the previous. Released in 2006, it chronicles the life of Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), who goes to live with his estranged father in Japan after his affinity for street racing gets him in trouble. Boswell befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow) and is introduced to drift racing, which gets Boswell into more trouble in Tokyo.\n\n\"Fast & Furious\"\n\nIn the 2009 film, Toretto and O'Conner are tasked with investigating the murder of Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Toretto's lover, and seizing drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz).\n\nThis movie is set five years after the original and before \"Tokyo Drift.\"\n\n\"Fast Five\"\n\nToretto and O'Conner are back in the fifth installment, released in 2011. The duo, along with Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), plan a heist to steal from a corrupt businessman. All the while, the squad of racers is being trailed by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson).\n\nThis film is also set before the events of \"Tokyo Drift.\"\n\n\"Fast & Furious 6\"\n\nThe 2013 movie features Toretto, O'Conner and the crew teaming up with agent Hobbs in exchange for amnesty in order to help Hobbs catch a team of lethal mercenaries. One of the mercenaries appears to be Toretto's presumed deceased lover, Ortiz.\n\nThis is the final film in the timeline before \"Tokyo Drift.\"\n\n\"Furious 7\"\n\nIn this 2015 release, Toretto, O'Conner, and the rest of the team return to normal lives after securing amnesty for their crimes. That is until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue assassin, comes seeking to avenge his younger brother.\n\nThe film is set after \"Fast & Furious 6\" and continues from the end of \"Tokyo Drift.\" It also marked the last appearance of Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, who died in 2013.\n\n\"The Fate of the Furious\"\n\nThe installment, released in 2017, starts with Toretto and Ortiz settling down to a calmer life than one of crime and racing cars. But a mysterious woman named Cipher (Charlize Theron) ends this, forcing Toretto to betray his family and join her. The crew must then get together to find Toretto and stop Cipher.\n\n\"F9\"\n\nThe \"Fast and Furious\" release from 2021 sees Toretto and family coming together to foil a world-shattering plot headed by Cipher and Toretto's estranged younger brother Jakob (John Cena).\n\n'F9': Vin Diesel drives audiences back to the movies in a big way\n\n\"Fast X\"\n\nIn the latest of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise from 2023, Toretto and family are up against another dangerous foe: drug kingpin Hernan Reyes (Jason Mamoa), who is seeking to avenge his father's death and the loss of his family fortune.\n\n'Fast X' spoilers! How that cliffhanger, end-credit scene lead to a 'Furious' final chapter\n\nWhat is the correct order of 'Fast and Furious' movies?\n\nThough \"Fast and Furious\" films were released in a certain order, the events of the movies do not follow that same timeline.\n\nThe films' complicated timeline does not follow chronological order of how they were released. If you are planning a marathon to binge all ten, you may become confused unless you watch in the correct order.\n\nHere is how to watch the \"Fast and Furious\" movies in order, according to Rotten Tomatoes:\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001)\n\n\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" (2003)\n\n\"Fast & Furious\" (2009)\n\n\"Fast Five\" (2011)\n\n\"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013)\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" (2006)\n\n\"Furious 7\" (2015)\n\n\"Fate of the Furious\" (2017)\n\n\"F9\" (2021)\n\n\"Fast X\" (2023)\n\nSo in short terms, the correct order to watch the \"Fast and the Furious\" is the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, third, seventh, eighth, ninth and finally tenth movie.\n\nSee where your favorite ranks: Every 'Fast and Furious' film, definitively ranked\n\nWhat was Paul Walker's last scene?\n\nPaul Walker, who played Brian O'Conner, died in 2013 while \"Furious 7\" was still being filmed. Instead of canceling the movie, the creative team changed its ending, according to Screen Rant.\n\nThough Walker had shot a majority of his on-camera work for \"Furious 7,\" a visual effects company had to render Walker for the new ending and scenes, according to Screen Rant.\n\nWalker's two brothers, Caleb and Cody, and actor John Brotherton stood in as body doubles, and Walker's face was digitally overlaid on top, says Screen Rant.\n\nDirector James Wan has not confirmed which scene was Walker's last, according to Slash Film.\n\n\"I think it's very important that people go into this movie not fixated on trying to work out which is Paul, which isn't Paul,\" Wan said. \"I want them to just watch the movie and enjoy the film and be caught up in the emotion of it all.\"\n\nJust Curious for more?"
