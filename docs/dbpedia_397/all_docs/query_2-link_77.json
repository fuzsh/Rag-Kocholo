        "text": "by Peter Christiansen and Chili Palmer\n\nEdited by Cara Haynes\n\nIf you don’t remember the last time you hooked up your TV to an antenna, you’re not alone. Streaming video is just the norm now for most folks. But it’s also one of the most bandwidth-intensive—and frequent—activities we do online. Nowadays it’s not uncommon for kids to be streaming Spy Kids on their iPads downstairs while their parents are upstairs watching Suits, or to have your roommate binge-watching Black Sails while you’re watching live sports.\n\nHow can your internet connection keep up? We’ll help you figure it out. When looking at the recommended speeds for each platform below, make sure to add up all the different services that could be running at the same time. And don’t forget to budget a few Mbps for people who might be trying to work while everyone else is streaming.\n\nHow much speed do you need for your streaming service?\n\nNetflix\n\nApple TV+\n\nHulu\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube TV\n\nDisney+\n\nSling™ TV\n\nMax®\n\nParamount+ with Showtime\n\nPeacock\n\nSTARZ\n\nVUDU\n\nCrackle\n\nAcorn TV\n\nTest and track your internet speed on your phone\n\nBefore we get started, downloading our free and easy-to-use speed test app will give you quick and reliable results from your phone.\n\nBefore we get started, you may want to test your internet speed first so you can compare it to the recommended speeds.\n\nWhat do I need to stream video?\n\nWith everyone spending more time at home over the last few years, streaming video services like Netflix and Disney+ have become a ubiquitous part of life. If you’re a cable TV customer thinking about cutting the cord once and for all, this is the place to start.\n\nThe first thing you need is a good internet connection. That not only means an internet plan that can meet the basic speed requirements, but also one that’s not going to run out of data. Streaming video is one of the most data-intensive things you can do online, so look for a service that has a high data cap or, preferably, an internet plan with unlimited data.\n\nThe next thing you need is a streaming service. Most services provide TV shows and movies on demand, but there are also some—like YouTube TV—that offer live TV channels, just like cable TV. Many of these services offer free trials, and some—like Crackle and YouTube—are completely free. Instead of charging you for a subscription, their revenue comes from ads.\n\nIf you don’t know which service to sign up for, try a few and see which ones have the content you’re looking for. If you’re looking for more information check out these other articles:\n\nDisney+ vs. Netflix\n\nHBO vs. HBO Max\n\n4K Streaming Guide\n\nHow much speed you need for Netflix\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceMin. requirements0.5MbpsRecommended speed1.5MbpsSD streaming3MbpsHD streaming5MbpsUltra HD streaming25Mbps\n\nNetflix has clear recommendations for speed based on the quality of video you want. Just know that the speeds listed are for streaming on a single device, so if multiple devices on your network are watching Netflix at the same time, you need enough speed to handle all those streams at once.\n\nHow much speed you need for Apple TV+\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceHD streaming5Mbps4K streaming25Mbps\n\nApple doesn’t give official requirements for download speeds on its Apple TV+ streaming service. Like most streaming services, it will adjust the quality of the video automatically to match your download speed; however, users have measured the bitrate of a 4K stream at around 29 Mbps.\n\nWe recommend speeds of at least a 25Mbps if you want to watch in 4K quality. The quality of video available for Apple TV+ or for movies rented or purchased through the Apple TV app can also vary a lot depending on the device you’re using to stream. To take full advantage of all the features Apple offers—4K HDR video with Dolby Atmos sound—you’ll need an Apple TV 4K as well as a broadband connection of at least 25Mbps.\n\nHow much speed you need for Hulu\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceMin. for Hulu streaming library3MbpsMin. for livestreams8MbpsMin. for 4K content16Mbps\n\nHulu’s speed recommendations are based on picture quality and the type of content you’re watching. Similar to other streaming providers, Hulu automatically adjusts the video quality based on internet speed. It also recommends higher speeds for live content than library content. These recommendations are also the bare minimum, so we suggest a slightly faster connection to make sure you always get the video quality you want.\n\nHow much speed you need for Amazon Prime Video\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceSD streaming1MbpsHD streaming5Mbps\n\nLike many services, Amazon automatically adjusts the quality of your videos to serve you the highest quality picture possible based on your speed. It doesn’t have much in the way of speed recommendations, but it does warn that even if you’re watching on a supported device, you may experience issues below a certain connection speed. Since these are minimum requirements, we would recommend having a faster connection if possible.\n\nHow much speed you need for YouTube\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceSD 360p streaming0.7MbpsSD 480p streaming1.1MbpsHD 720p streaming2.5MbpsHD 1080p streaming5Mbps4K streaming20Mbps\n\nLike Netflix, YouTube does a great job of making its internet speed recommendations easy to understand. YouTube also points out that even if your connection can hit these numbers on a speed test, there are other factors like Wi-Fi performance, the type of connection, and the number of other devices on your network that can reduce your actual speed. We’ll talk more about other factors that affect buffering below.\n\nHow much speed you need for YouTube TV\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceStream SD video3MbpsStream HD video13MbpsStream 4K video (for 4K Plus subscribers*)25Mbps\n\n*Available at an additional charge. Device and content restrictions apply.\n\nAlthough it does offer recommended speeds for reliable streaming, YouTube TV notes that you can still use the service with slow internet speeds. For example, you can stream an HD video with a 7Mbps download speed, but you’re more likely to run into buffering issues. You can also watch with speeds slower than 3Mbps, but any content may load slowly or rebuffer when you try to watch.\n\nHow much speed you need for Disney+\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceHD streaming5Mbps4K UHD streaming25Mbps\n\nDisney+ has speed recommendations that are on par with other streaming video services. If your connection is fast enough for 4K UHD video but you still find yourself being served low-quality video instead, it’s worth noting that some titles just aren’t available in this format.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Disney+ has instituted measures to lower bandwidth utilization, which means potentially limiting HD and UHD streaming.\n\nHow much speed you need for Sling TV\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceStreaming on portable devices3MbpsSingle stream5MbpsStreaming on multiple devices at the same time25Mbps\n\nSling TV issues its speed recommendations based on the type and number of devices you plan to use, recommending at least a 25 Mbps connection if you’re going to be streaming on multiple devices. It also notes that these recommendations are for “constant speeds,” so if, for instance, you had a cable connection that slows during peak-use times, you want to make sure that your speed never dips below these requirements for Sling to run properly.\n\nHow much speed you need for Max\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceHD streaming5Mbps4K streaming25Mbps (50Mbps recommended)\n\nMax doesn’t give many recommendations regarding connection speed, but it does recommend speeds of at least 50Mbps for watching in 4K. Get tips on what to do if you’re encountering buffering in the HBO Max help center.\n\nHow much speed you need for Paramount+ with Showtime Streaming Service\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceStreaming on-demand and live TV2MbpsStreaming in 4K25Mbps\n\nParamount+ suggests minimum speeds of at least 25Mbps to watch in 4K, but you can get away witih speeds that are much slower if you’re watching live TV or shows on demand. Get a list of full system requirements from Paramount+.\n\nHow much speed you need for Peacock\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceMin. speed for video streaming3MbpsRecommended speed for premium content8Mbps\n\nPeacock recommends a minimum speed of 3Mbps to watch its content, but says that to enjoy enjoy certain high-quality live events and “ultra-high definition” premium content, you’ll need at least an 8 Mbps connection. 8 Mbps is a decent speed for standard HD streaming, but it should be noted that ultra-high definition is usually synonymous with 4k resolution, which needs much more bandwidth. We recommend a connection with at least 25Mbps to get the best quality video.\n\nWhen watching live events, it’s also important to use a low-latency connection like fiber for the best real-time experience.\n\nHow much speed you need for STARZ\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceMin. speed for video streaming2MbpsRecommended speed for video streaming6MbpsRecommended speed for streaming on a TV12Mbps\n\nSTARZ has some of the lowest speed requirements we’ve seen among premium streaming services, recommending speeds up to just 12Mbps for streaming on a TV. You’ll still be happiest with speeds of at least 25Mbps, though.\n\nHow much speed you need for VUDU\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceHDX streaming4.5Mbps\n\nVUDU offers streaming in HDX, which is a format developed by VUDU that claims a better movie experience by preserving a film’s native 24 frames per second frame rate. If your internet connection can’t maintain the required minimum speed, you can use the VUDU app to download the video in HDX format.\n\nHow much speed you need for Crackle\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceHD streaming9Mbps\n\nCrackle is an ad-supported streaming service, so in addition to playback issues related to your internet speed, ad blockers might interfere with your video. If you’ve checked your speed but are still having issues, try disabling your ad blocker and see if it makes a difference.\n\nHow much speed you need for Acorn TV\n\nVideo typeSpeed per deviceMinimum speed for video streaming1.6Mbps\n\nAcorn TV cites only a minimum speed requirement. This minimum is also fairly low compared to other streaming services. For higher-quality streams, especially on multiple devices, you’ll want more speed.\n\nWhat if you meet the minimum speed requirements and still have problems?\n\nKeep in mind that even if your internet speed meets the recommended speed of the streaming service you’re using, you could still have trouble with the quality of your video. If someone is downloading a large file or on a video chat while you’re trying to stream video, your bandwidth is going to be split between all these activities.\n\nSome types of internet connections can experience slowdown at peak-use hours. Fast internet connections also need fast Wi-Fi routers that can handle multiple devices streaming at the same time. Watching a movie on Netflix uses more bandwidth than surfing the web, Voice over IP, or even online gaming. As such, one of the most basic reasons to upgrade your internet service is to make sure that the video you stream has a crisp, clear picture and buttery-smooth playback.\n\nGet internet speed fast enough for streaming\n\nIf your internet service isn’t fast enough for your streaming service, you’re probably due for an upgrade.
