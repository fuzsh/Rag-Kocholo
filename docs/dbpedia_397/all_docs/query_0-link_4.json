        "text": "Adverb of degree Modifying Example extremely adjective The water was extremely cold. quite adjective The movie is quite interesting. just verb He was just leaving. almost verb She has almost finished. very adverb She is running very fast. too adverb You are walking too slowly. enough adverb You are running fast enough.\n\nUsage of \"enough\"\n\nEnough can be used as both an adverb and as a determiner.\n\nEnough as an adverb\n\nEnough as an adverb meaning 'to the necessary degree' goes after the adjective or adverb that it is modifying, and not before it as other adverbs do. It can be used both in positive and negative sentences.\n\nEnough is often followed by \"to\" + the infinitive.\n\nEnough can also be followed by \"for someone\" or \"for something\".\n\nEnough as a determiner\n\nEnough as a determiner meaning 'as much/many as necessary' goes before the noun it modifies. It is used with countable nouns in the plural and with uncountable nouns.\n\nUsage of \"too\"\n\n\"Too\" is always an adverb, but it has two distinct meanings, each with its own usage patterns.\n\nToo meaning \"also\"\n\nToo as an adverb meaning \"also\" goes at the end of the phrase it modifies.\n\nToo meaning \"excessively\"\n\nToo as an adverb meaning \"excessively\" goes before the adjective or adverb it modifies. It can be used in both affirmative and negative sentences.\n\nToo is often followed by \"to\" + the infinitive.\n\nToo can also be followed by \"for someone\" or \"for something\".\n\nUsage of \"very\"\n\nVery goes before an adverb or adjective to make it stronger.\n\nIf we want to make a negative form of an adjective or adverb, we can add \"not\" to the verb, we can use an adjective or adverb of opposite meaning, or we can use \"not very\" with the original adjective or adverb. The meanings of the phrases are not identical. Usually the phrase using \"not very\" is less direct, and thus more polite, than the other phrases.\n\nDifference in meaning between \"very\" and \"too\"\n\nThere is a big difference in meaning between \"too\" and \"very\". \"Very\" expresses a fact while \"too\" suggests there is a problem.\n\nOther adverbs used like \"very\"\n\nSome common adverbs are used in the same way as \"very\" to heighten the degree of adjectives and adverbs.\n\nExpressing very strong feelings Expressing strong feelings Expressing somewhat doubtful feelings extremely, terribly, amazingly, wonderfully, insanely especially, particularly, uncommonly, unusually, remarkably, quite pretty, rather, fairly, not especially, not particularly The movie was amazingly interesting. The movie was particularly interesting. The movie was fairly interesting. She sang wonderfully well. She sang unusually well. She sang pretty well. The lecture was terribly boring. The lecture was quite boring. The lecture was rather boring.\n\nInversion with negative adverbs\n\nNormally the subject goes before the verb, however, some negative adverbs can cause an inversion when placed at the beginning of the clause. The order is reversed and the verb goes before the subject. This inversion is only used in writing, not in speaking."
