        "text": "With the Bad Boys: Ride or Die movie being released, discover more about the Porsche 911 that's appearing in theatres near you\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die, just released in cinemas globally, is the fourth instalment of the adrenaline-fuelled franchise featuring Miami police officers Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence). In the movie, Lowrey and Burnett are on the run as they take on the bad guys to clear their late captainâs name. When the first Bad Boys movie hit the big screen in 1995, another icon co-starred in the young film franchise â a 911 Turbo 3.6 (type 964). Porsche returned for the previous film to Bad Boys: Ride or Die â Bad Boys for Life (2020) â and now joins the action-packed spectacle again, this time with a 911 Turbo S (type 992).The brand new film, Bad Boys: Ride or Die, explodes onto our screens in summer 2024 with a serious upgrade on the performance front when it comes to the Porsche that Lowery and Burnett drive â a 911 Turbo S. Strap yourself in as we take an action-packed dive into the Porsche 911 stars of the Bad Boys franchise.Bad Boys (1995) â¢ 911 Turbo (type 964)If the climactic final chase scene of the first-ever Bad Boys movie wasnât heart-stopping enough, then the sight of the black 911 Turbo (type 964) got a generation of sportscar fans excited. Directed by famed Hollywood director Michael Bay, the film made a feature of the 964 Turbo â a future Porsche classic then and very much one today.Originally launched with a 3.3-litre engine in 1990, the 911 Turbo was the top of the range of all type 964 models. Power-wise it produced 320PS, and one of its prime features was a special bypass tailpipe equipped with a catalytic converter and exhaust silencer. This meant that the exhaust gases directed through the bypass no longer had to go through the regular catalytic converter â the 964 Turbo had a new three-way metallic catalytic converter as standard â which in turn avoided any additional back pressure, which further aided performance. The 964 Turbo in the Bad Boys movie featured the model with a 3.6-litre engine, which was launched at the start of 1993. It was even more powerful than the version it superseded, with up to 360PS available â great, in other words, for outrunning hardened criminals on the mean streets of Miami, as officers Lowery and Burnett did in spectacular fashion. The actual car used in the movie was once owned by Michael Bay himself.Bad Boys for Life (2020) â¢ 911 Carrera 4S (type 992)The third movie in the Bad Boys series, 2020âs Bad Boys for Life, featured a 911 Carrera 4S (type 992). It may not have been turbo-charged like its 911 predecessor from the first Bad Boys movie, but it certainly didnât mean a lack of performance. In fact, it is more powerful at 450PS and can accelerate from 0-100km/h (0-62mph) in 3.6 seconds, over a second quicker than the 964 Turbo (4.8 seconds).When Will Smith and Martin Lawrence attended at the premiere of Bad Boys for Life in Hollywood that year, they certainly made an entrance, arriving in a 992 Carrera 4S to the sound of the Bads Boys theme pumping from the sportscarâs sound system.Bad Boys: Ride or Die (2024) â¢ 911 Turbo S (type 992)The release of the brand new Bad Boys movie, Bad Boys: Ride or Die, sees Will Smith and Martin Lawrenceâs characters once again get behind the wheel of a turbo-charged 911. But this time, not that famous 964 Turbo from 1995.There is no such thing as an ordinary 911, but in the form of the 911 Turbo S (type 992) that appears in Bad Boys: Ride or Die, detective lieutenants Lowery and Burnett roar around the streets of Miami in the fastest 911 currently available (as of May 2024).The story of the 911 Turbo S is simply a long list of superlatives. As well as being the most powerful 911 ever, it has greater performance and improved agility than any 911 Turbo model produced to date.A host of innovations improve the 911 driving characteristics, for greater responsiveness, power and torque as well as lower emissions. Its adaptive aerodynamics now include controlled cooling air flaps at the front, while even more downforce is created by its larger rear wing. It features a flat-six, 3.8-litre boxer engine, with a power output of 650PS. When fitted with the optional Sports Chrono package, that translates to a 0-200km/h (0-62mph) time of just 2.7 seconds with the PDK gearbox. Top speed is 330km/h (205mph).It possesses just the sort of muscular, powerful looks that any self-respecting movie cop, like Bad Boys characters Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett, deserves when it comes to hunting down dangerous villains.The new movie even includes a neat little reference to the original movie. Back then, Marcus asks Mike where the cupholder is in the car (the 964 Turbo didnât have a cupholder). Happily for Marcus, the current 992 Turbo S used in Bad Boys: Ride of Die now features the cupholder that he was desperately looking for in that first Bad Boys movie!\n\nConsumption and emission information 911 Turbo S (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 12,3 - 12,0 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 278 - 271 g/km; COâ class: G.\n\nBad Boys and Porsche have come together for events across the globe to launch the new movie â from Dubai, where Will and Martin arrived in a 992 Turbo S, to Berlin to Los Angeles.Directed â as was the previous movie, Bad Boys for Life â by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah and produced by Hollywood legend Jerry Bruckheimer, Bad Boys: Ride or Die is set to add the 992 Turbo S to the list of all-time great movie cars.Bad Boys: Ride or Die is released in movie theatres from 7 June 2024\n\nConsumption and emission information 911 Turbo S (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 12,3 - 12,0 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 278 - 271 g/km; COâ class: G."
