        "text": "Yes, you can purchase tickets online by clicking the red showtime button under the movie you’d like to see.\n\nTickets are also sold on a first-come, first-served basis at the box office. Tickets will be available through the box office even if they are sold out online.\n\nWe recommend arriving early to avoid the line, get a good spot and start enjoying some movie theater popcorn! Opening times vary by the time of the year. May through September the gates open 2 hours before showtime in Concord, San Jose, and Sacramento; and an hour before showtime in Las Vegas, Reno and Glendale. October through April the gates open 60 minutes before showtime on Friday and Saturday and 45 minutes on Sunday through Thursday.\n\nOur audio is quality FM stereo sound that is tuned directly through your car’s FM stereo! Turn your key to accessory mode to keep your stereo on. If you don’t have an FM stereo, bring a portable boom box.\n\nIf your car stereo has HD settings, we highly recommend turning this off. It will help you receive a clearer FM signal so that you can enjoy your movie!\n\nPlease park big trucks and SUVs in the back of the field so you do not block the screen. Try backing into the space, open your tailgate and enjoy the film from the back of your vehicle.\n\nMost vehicles will not have a problem. If you are concerned, we recommend turning your car on a few times during the movie. In the rare event your battery dies, we offer a complimentary jump-start that will quickly get you on your way.\n\nWe suggest bringing a blanket or two towels with you and drape that over your car’s hood – this helps tremendously.\n\nWe’ve also found that for many vehicles if you: engage your parking brake, then turn your car off and restart in accessory mode it will usually turn off both the headlights and rear brake lights.\n\nWe love our pets too but they are not allowed at the drive-in. Of course, service dogs are permitted at any time.\n\nFor the safety of our customers, we do not allow firearms, weapons of any kind, drugs (including marijuana) or alcoholic beverages. All vehicles are subject to search.\n\nWe don’t have specific birthday packages but can always work with you to make your day VERY SPECIAL. Contact management at your local drive-in to make arrangements.\n\nWe would love to help you create memories by putting your message on our screen. There is a minimal fee and we need at least two weeks advance notice. Please click on Contact Us to send your request. Be sure to include your phone number so we can call you to confirm the details.\n\nThere are many people walking in the dark at the drive-in, so please keep your speed under 3mph.\n\nWhile it may sound funny, drivers caught concealing other persons in their vehicle will be turned away or asked to leave without a refund. All vehicles are subject to search.\n\nWe are always accepting applications for the drive-in and public market. Ask any manager on site for an application or click on Job Opportunities and fill out the required information. We are looking for energetic, fun, hard-working staff who enjoy movies and providing great customer service."
