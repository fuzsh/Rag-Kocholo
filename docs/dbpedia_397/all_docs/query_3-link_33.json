        "text": "Think that watching the Fast and Furious movies in order is as easy as driving from A to B? Think again, because after 10 movies (and counting) and one spin-off, the chronology of the successful Vin Diesel vehicle is surprisingly complex, taking numerous significant detours en route.\n\nThis article explains how to watch the Fast and Furious movies in order – both in terms of release date and Fast Saga chronology – from the original through to the most recent instalment, Fast X. We also speculate on where the franchise's sat-nav might be taking us next, provide viewing options in the US, UK and Australia, and rank the 11 films by their IMDb user ratings.\n\nWhere to stream the Fast and Furious movies\n\nLike Dom Toretto and his family, the Fast & Furious movies rarely hang around in one place for long. Even though the Peacock streaming service is owned outright by Comcast, the parent company of Universal Pictures, none of the films are currently available on the Peacock platform. That means US viewers will have to hunt around other streaming services to find them.\n\nViewers in the UK and Australia fare should find it slightly easier to binge the saga, with Sky Go and Now (in the UK), and Netflix, Prime Video, BINGE and Foxtel Now (in Australia) providing a home for most of the films in the long-running franchise.\n\nBelow we've tracked down where you can view the 11 Fast & Furious movies to date. If they're not available to stream, we've offered options to rent or buy the movies on SVOD.\n\nThe Fast and the Furious\n\nAvailable to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Prime Video, Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nThe Turbo Charged Prelude (short film)\n\nNot available to stream, but it's here on YouTube.\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious\n\nAvailable to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nLos Bandoleros (short film)\n\nNot available to stream, but it's here on Vimeo\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\n\nAvailable to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Prime Video, Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nFast & Furious\n\nAvailable to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (US); Now (UK); Netflix, Prime Video, Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nFast Five (US title)/Fast & Furious 5 (UK)\n\nApple TV Plus (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Binge, Foxtel Now, Stan (Australia)\n\nFast & Furious 6\n\nApple TV Plus (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Prime Video, Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nFurious 7 (US)/Fast & Furious 7 (UK)\n\nMax, Apple TV Plus (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Prime Video, Binge, Foxtel Now, Stan (Australia)\n\nThe Fate of the Furious (US)/Fast & Furious 8 (UK)\n\nAvailable to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Prime Video, Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw\n\nApple TV Plus (US); available to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (UK); Binge, Foxtel Now (Australia)\n\nF9 (US)/Fast & Furious 9 (UK)\n\nApple TV Plus (US); Netflix (UK); available to rent/buy on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon and more (Australia)\n\nFast X\n\nPrime Video, Apple TV Plus (US); Sky Go, Now (UK); Netflix, Binge (Australia)\n\nHere's a complete rundown of how to watch the Fast and Furious movies by their release dates:\n\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\n\nFast & Furious (2009)\n\nFast Five (US title)/Fast & Furious 5 (UK) (2011)\n\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\n\nFurious 7 (US)/Fast & Furious 7 (UK) (2015)\n\nThe Fate of the Furious (US)/Fast & Furious 8 (UK) (2017)\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)\n\nF9 (US)/Fast & Furious 9 (UK) (2021)\n\nFast X (2023)\n\nUntitled Luke Hobbs movie (TBC)\n\nFast & Furious 11 (2025)\n\nIt should be easy to work out how to watch the Fast and Furious movies in order by release date – unfortunately, the naming conventions of this series are muddled, and the titles may be different depending on where you're reading this.\n\nIt was all so simple in the early days, when the original The Fast and the Furious was followed by the pun-driven 2 Fast 2 Furious. Japan-set The Fast and the Furious 3 was subtitled Tokyo Drift, but things got seriously weird for the franchise’s fourth instalment, which was simply called Fast & Furious – as confusing as that was, at least the movie wasn’t called Fast & Four-ious.\n\nFrom there, American viewers were treated to a moveable feast of naming, with Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, Furious 7, and (bizarrely) The Fate of the Furious – we'll grudgingly concede that \"fate\" does sound a bit like F8. The ninth instalment embraced brevity with a simple F9.\n\nBrits, meanwhile, got a rather more consistent Fast & Furious 5, Fast & Furious 6, Fast & Furious 7, Fast & Furious 8 and Fast & Furious 9.\n\nThe most recent movie in the series, Fast X, made clever use of a roman numeral but when it comes to the 11th and final instalment, all bets are off. Fast & Furious: The End of the Road, anyone?\n\nDwayne Johnson/Jason Statham-starring spin-off Hobbs & Shaw took a back-to-basics approach to titling, so we're guessing that the standalone Luke Hobbs movie Johnson announced on Instagram back in June 2023 will simply be called Hobbs. According to Variety, the film will be a bridge between the events of Fast X and the eleventh instalment of the main franchise. But, seeing as Diesel announced an April 2025 release date for the next Fast movie on his own Instagram page, Johnson will have to put the pedal to the metal if he's going to be first into theaters.\n\nHow to watch the Fast and Furious movies in chronological order\n\nHere's how you watch the Fast and Furious movies in chronological order:\n\nThe Fast and the Furious\n\nThe Turbo Charged Prelude (short film)\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious\n\nLos Bandoleros (short film)\n\nFast & Furious\n\nFast Five (US title)/Fast & Furious 5 (UK)\n\nFast & Furious 6\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\n\nFurious 7 (US)/Fast & Furious 7 (UK)\n\nThe Fate of the Furious (US)/Fast & Furious 8 (UK)\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw\n\nF9 (US)/Fast & Furious 9 (UK)\n\nFast X\n\nUntitled Luke Hobbs movie\n\nFast & Furious 11\n\nThe franchise began more than two decades ago with The Fast and the Furious, the straighforward, seemingly standalone story of a cop who goes undercover with a bunch of LA street racers, who have a lucrative sideline hijacking trucks. It's subsequently evolved into something very different, as Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \"family\" join forces with the US government to carry out high-octane undercover missions. That's when things start to get complex.\n\nAs if the Fast and Furious naming/numbering convention wasn’t complicated enough, the order the films were released doesn’t correspond exactly with on-screen continuity. That means that to watch the Fast and Furious movies in order from a chronological perspective is weirdly complex. We'll try to explain how it all fits together below, but beware – there are a few SPOILERS ahead in the road.\n\nThe rogue element shaking everything up is Tokyo Drift, the third movie to drive into theaters. When Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto unexpectedly showed up at the end of that movie – returning to the franchise after sitting out 2 Fast 2 Furious – everybody assumed that fourth instalment Fast & Furious would pick up where that left off. But there was a glaring continuity issue – Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang), who’d been killed in Tokyo Drift, was alive and well in Fast & Furious.\n\nAs it turns out, Han actually makes his fateful trip to Tokyo at the end of Fast & Furious 6. We subsequently learn that British rogue agent Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham, who joined the series in Fast & Furious 6) was driving the car that killed Han. The scene where Toretto turns up in Tokyo actually takes place during the timeline of Furious 7/Fast & Furious 7.\n\nFast & Furious 9 picks up after The Fate of the Furious/Fast & Furious 8, with Charlize Theron’s Big Bad Cipher back in action, along with The Suicide Squad's John Cena as Dominic Toretto's long lost brother and rival Jakob. To make matters even more complicated, Fast & Furious 9 reveals that Han was never actually dead at all, as he'd teamed up with Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell) to fake his death. Got all that?\n\nFast X ended with a massive cliffhanger ahead of part 11, which Diesel and co have pitched as a finale for the long-running series – though the star did raise the possibility of a 12th instalment during the press tour for Fast X.\n\nMeanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs and Statham's Deckard Shaw both showed up unexpectedly at the end of the most recent movie. When Johnson announced his new Hobbs movie in June 2023, he teased that it will \"serve as a fresh, new chapter & set up for FASTX: Part II\" – suggesting his new film will be set before (or, at least, parallel to) Fast X.\n\nBeyond the movies, there's a pair of official short films that expand the Fast continuity. The Turbo Charged Prelude sets the scene for 2 Fast 2 Furious, explaining how Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner ends up in Miami. Meanwhile, Los Bandoleros (written and directed by Vin Diesel) establishes key plot points for fourth movie Fast & Furious.\n\nAnd while we’ve not included it in the chronological order list above, real Fast and Furious completists may want to check out crime drama Better Luck Tomorrow. It's not technically a Fast and Furious movie, but regular F&F director Justin Lin and star Sung Kang have both said the Han in Better Luck Tomorrow is the same character who later turns up in Tokyo Drift.\n\nKid-friendly spin-off Fast & Furious: Spy Racers has six seasons on Netflix. It’s about Dom Toretto’s younger cousin, Tony, but the tone is so different to the movies that we're unsure about calling it canon. We've therefore left it out of the chronology above.\n\nThe Fast and Furious movies ranked: from best to worst\n\nLeaving aside rare exceptions like Mission: Impossible, long-running franchises don’t generally get better as they go on. Still, if you trust the Fast and Furious ranking based on IMDb user scores, it took until Fast Five for the series to hit its stride, as it made a successful transition from car racing dramas to all-action espionage movies.\n\nIn fact, Fast Five was the start of a three-movie golden run for the saga, before it dropped off slightly with The Fate of the Furious. The first sequel, 2 Fast 2 Furious, remained the franchise low-point for a long time, but now F9 (aka the one where they send a car into space) has replaced it as the IMDb users' least wanted, clocking in at a miserable 5.2/10. 2023 release Fast X is also languishing towards the bottom of the chart.\n\nFast Five/Fast & Furious 5 – 7.3\n\nFurious 7/Fast & Furious 7 – 7.1\n\nFast & Furious 6 – 7.0\n\nThe Fast and the Furious – 6.8\n\nThe Fate of the Furious/Fast & Furious 8 – 6.6\n\nFast & Furious – 6.5\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw – 6.5\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift – 6.0\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious – 5.9\n\nFast X – 5.8\n\nF9 – 5.2\n\nWant to continue living your life a quarter-mile at a time?
