        "text": "Each transition comes with a default speed that you can adjust.\n\nFor example, let’s click More to open the Transitions gallery and click Page Curl to apply that transition.\n\nThe transition looks like a page being turned.\n\nTo see the speed setting for the transition, look in the Duration box.\n\nThe transition’s duration is set at 1.25 seconds.\n\nI’ll click Apply To All to apply the transition to all the slides.\n\nAnd then, I’ll click Slide Show to see whether I like the transition’s speed, slide to slide.\n\nI think the page turn could be a little slower.\n\nI’ll press Esc to return to Normal view.\n\nTo make the transition take more time, in the Duration box, I’ll click the up arrow to increase the duration to 1.5 seconds.\n\nThen, I’ll click Apply To All.\n\nLet’s click Slide Show to see if we like the change.\n\nResuming from where we were, I’ll click through some slides.\n\nI do like the transition as it has slowed down a little bit.\n\nBack in Normal view, note that I can vary the speed as well as the transition type for the selected slides.\n\nFor example, let’s make the Section Header slides different. I’ll press Ctrl as I select the Section Headers, Slides 5 and 9.\n\nFor these slides, I am going to apply a different transition, Peel Off, and I’ll slow it down.\n\nFor Duration, I’ll click the up arrow and increase the number to 2 seconds.\n\nI’ll start from the Title Slide and click Slide Show to see how this looks.\n\nClicking from the Title Slide, we have the Page Curl transition on each slide, until we get to the first Section Header.\n\nAnd there, the page peels off and the transition goes more slowly.\n\nThe slides in the section once again use the Page Curl transition, but change to the slower Peel Off transition at the next Section Header.\n\nNow, you can make effective use of transitions, adding visual interest and variety to your slides.\n\nFor more information, see the course summary and experiment some more with PowerPoint."
