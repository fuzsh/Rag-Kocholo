        "text": "Here's the correct order you should watch the films before seeing \"Fast X\":\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001)\n\n\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" (2003)\n\n\"Fast & Furious\" (2009) [the fourth film]\n\n\"Fast Five\" (2011)\n\n\"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013)\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" (2006)\n\n\"Furious 7\" (2015)\n\n\"The Fate of the Furious\" (2017)\n\n\"Hobbs & Shaw\" (2019)\n\n\"F9\" (2021)\n\nWhy should I watch the movies in this order?\n\nThe ending of the third film in the franchise, \"Tokyo Drift,\" resulted in Han's death after his car was hit by a Mercedes. When Han showed up alive and well in the franchise's next movie, \"Fast & Furious,\" the death scene was confusing to many, suggesting that \"Tokyo Drift\" took place after the movie.\n\nThe timeline became more clear after Han appeared in the next two movies. At the end of \"Fast & Furious 6\" Han tells the group he's going to head to Tokyo, a place he previously planned on visiting with his girlfriend Gisele (Gal Gadot) before she was killed.\n\nThe entire timeline of the third movie, \"Tokyo Drift,\" takes place years later after the sixth \"Fast and Furious\" movie. It was revealed during a credits scene after \"Fast & Furious 6\" that Deckard Shaw headed to Tokyo to hunt down Han for putting his younger brother into a coma. Shaw was the driver behind the wheel of the Mercedes.\n\nThe very end of \"Tokyo Drift\" where Dom visits Tokyo then takes place in \"Furious 7.\" We see Dom retrieve the necklace he gave to Letty from Sean (Lucas Black). If it sounds confusing, you can watch Han's death scene from the end of \"Tokyo Drift\" merged with the \"Fast 6\" scene here.\n\nBut there's more!\n\nIf you've only watched the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, you've missed out on about another half hour of the franchise. There are also two official \"Fast\" shorts, one of which was directed by Vin Diesel himself. There's also another movie that's considered the ultimate prequel to the entire franchise.\n\nWhat are the two \"Fast and Furious\" shorts?\n\n\"The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious\"\n\nAs the title suggests, the short is a prelude to \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" which shows how Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) winds up in Miami in the second film. He drives cross country making cash by street racing while evading cops after letting Dominic go at the end of \"The Fast and the Furious.\"\n\nThe short contains no dialogue, but if you're wondering how Brian wound up with the Nissan Skyline he has at the start of the \"Fast and Furious\" sequel, the six-minute video will show you exactly how it all happened. If you're a \"Friday Night Lights\" fan, Minka Kelly pops up in a small role as well.\n\nYou can check it out here.\n\n\"Los Bandoleros\"\n\nSpanish for \"The Outlaws,\" \"Los Bandoleros\" was written and directed by Vin Diesel himself. It's a precursor to the fourth \"Fast and Furious\" film and sets up the oil heist at the film's start. The 20-minute prologue feels like two mini episodes. The first half shows Dom hiding out with family in the Dominican Republic while Han (Sung Kang), from \"Tokyo Drift,\" arrives and notes that he's never been to Japan at that point. He says he met Dom in Mexico so it's clear this movie takes place a bit in the past.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere's a lot of talk about oil being scarce and expensive. Dom helps break Leo from prison who later becomes a part of the team in subsequent movies.\n\nThe latter half of the short focuses on Dom's relationship with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) after she turns up in the DR. The two road trip out to a beach where they end up spending a lot of time in a canoe paddling, making out, lying around, falling out of the canoe, and making out some more. She also says she wants to join in on whatever adventure Dom's planning.\n\n\"Los Bandoleros\" came as a bonus on the Blu-ray and special edition DVD of 2009's \"Fast and the Furious.\" The short film's editor Sonia Gonzalez-Martinez put the entire short film on Vimeo.\n\nThe short receives a direct nod in \"Fast X.\" You can view it here.\n\nThe unofficial prequel movie\n\n\"Better Luck Tomorrow\"\n\nIf you really want to go down the \"Fast and Furious\" rabbit hole, there's one more movie you should check out: 2003's indie film \"Better Luck Tomorrow.\" The movie is from \"Tokyo Drift\" director Justin Lin.\n\nWhile its not officially affiliated with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise, its widely considered to be a prequel story for Han (Sung Kang), who's introduced in \"Tokyo Drift.\" Why? Well, because \"Better Luck Tomorrow\" also stars Sung Kang as a character named Han during his high school years.\n\nPlus, both Lin and Kang have confirmed the character is the same across both series.\n\n\"Yes, it is. Justin and I always … He wanted to keep the anthology going,\" Kang told Crave. \"He was always wondering where the characters go after high school. The Daric Loo character actually went into his film Annapolis, and then in Tokyo Drift we have Virgil too from 'Better Luck Tomorrow' as well.\"\n\nLin also confirmed it in an interview with ComingSoon.net saying its been a fun inside joke and discusses it in the \"Fast\" commentaries.\n\nHere's the full order you should watch the series in:\n\n\"Better Luck Tomorrow\" (2003)\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001)\n\n\"The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious\"\n\n\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" (2003)\n\n\"Los Bandoleros\" (2009)\n\n\"Fast & Furious\" (2009) [the fourth film]\n\n\"Fast Five\" (2011)\n\n\"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013)\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" (2006)\n\n\"Furious 7\" (2015)\n\n\"The Fate of the Furious\" (2017)\n\n\"Hobbs & Shaw\" (2019)\n\n\"F9\" (2021)\n\nFranchise director Justin Lin confirms to Insider that 'F9' takes place after 'Hobbs & Shaw'\n\nWhile speaking about \"F9,\" Lin told Insider the 2021 film does indeed take place after the 2019 spinoff with a succinct, \"Yes.\"\n\nThis makes sense since Queenie (Helen Mirren) is seen after she's broken out of jail in \"Hobbs & Shaw.\"\n\nIf you're thinking this should be obvious, remember there was a time where \"Fast 9\" was originally supposed to come out in 2019, before \"Hobbs & Shaw,\" before the film was delayed.\n\nThe main \"Fast and the Furious\" saga is set to be 11 movies, but could wind up being 12."
