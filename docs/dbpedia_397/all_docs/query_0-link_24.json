        "text": "What are Camera Movements?\n\nSimply put, a camera movement is a filmmaking technique that describes how a camera moves about to help enhance a story. Specific camera movements help change the audience’s view without cutting; they can be a great way to make your video more immersive and engaging. When it comes to User-Generated Video, you might not be able to control the type of footage you receive. Luckily for you, many of these movements can be added in post-production.\n\nWhy are Camera Movements Used?\n\nCamera movement can add a lot of meaning to your footage, changing and shaping a viewer’s perspective of a scene. It’s essential to understand how your viewers interpret different types before adding in pans, zooms, tilts, and the like.\n\nWe’re going to break down the basic types of camera movement in filmmaking that are achievable with a phone, so next time you’re shooting, you understand the implications of what you’re doing!\n\n7 Basic Camera Movements\n\nPan\n\nFirst up is the pan. A pan is when you move your camera from one side to the other. Panning generally is helpful to reveal a larger scene, like a crowd or to reveal something off-screen.\n\nStep your speed up a notch, and you get the whip pan, which is handy for transitions showing the passing of time or travelling a distance dramatically or comically. We cover this in more detail in our last episode, so if you want to learn how to execute a whip pan, go check it out.\n\nTilt\n\nTo tilt, imagine your camera is your head nodding up and down.\n\nTilts are helpful as a ‘reveal’ technique, either to unveil something from top to bottom or the reverse.\n\nZoom\n\n‘Zooming’ is probably the most commonly used camera movement; it lets you quickly move closer to the subject without physically moving. But be careful with these, as zooming lessens your image quality.\n\nWhen you give zooming a go, keep the movement as smooth as possible.\n\nTracking shot\n\nA ‘tracking shot’ is one in which the camera moves alongside what it’s recording. Tracking shots are sometimes called dolly shots, but they can be differentiated by the direction they take.\n\nTracking shots will generally follow along the horizontal axis as the subject moves. You’re probably familiar with walking and talking scenes where a tracking shot stays on the subjects as they move.\n\nTracking shots are also helpful for showing a stretch of road or scenery.\n\nDolly shot\n\nA ‘dolly shot’ is when the camera moves toward or away from the subject you’re shooting. Instead of utilising the zoom to get closer, the camera is physically moving relative to the subject.\n\nUsing a dolly to push in slowly helps build drama or tension in a scene or simply some significance to the subject it’s moving in on.\n\nFollowing shot\n\nThe ‘following’ shot is a tracking shot in which the camera continuously follows the subject’s action.\n\nIf you want to achieve a smooth, seamless following shot, Steadicams and gimbals are your friends. Otherwise, shaky, handheld shots give a sense of realism or unease.\n\nLong following shots, if executed well, are genuinely impressive and mesmerising cinematic feats.\n\nPedestal\n\nAlso known as a Boom up/down, our final shot is the pedestal. This involves moving the camera up or down relative to a subject. It’s different from the tilt that we looked at earlier, as the entire camera ascends or descends, rather than just the camera’s angle. A pedestal shot can be used to frame a tall or high subject (such as a building) while keeping the framing at eye level.\n\nPutting it altogether\n\nSo there you have it. Whether you’re using a pan to slowly reveal a piece of information or following the action with a tracking shot, camera movement can help support the story you’re telling.\n\nBottom line, DON’T move your camera just because you can. Make sure you are moving for a particular reason and motivation.\n\nUsing these techniques in Employer Brand or Internal Communications Videos\n\nIncorporating effective camera movements can dramatically enhance the impact of Employer Brand and Internal Communications videos. By using techniques like pans and tilts, you can subtly reveal the dynamics of your workplace or focus attentively on testimonials videos of employees, crafting a narrative that feels both inclusive and expansive.\n\nFor employer brand videos, a smooth tracking shot moving through the office can effectively immerse potential candidates in the environment, helping them visualize themselves as part of your team. This seamless integration of the viewer into the day-to-day workplace not only keeps the video engaging but also plays a crucial role in potential recruitment.\n\nBy thoughtfully utilizing these camera movements, your videos can do more than just inform; they can resonate deeply with employees and candidates alike, turning simple messages into compelling narratives that reinforce your company’s ethos and culture.\n\nDive into a topic\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nEmployer Branding\n\nInternal Communications\n\nMarketing\n\nNews\n\nTalent Acquisition"
