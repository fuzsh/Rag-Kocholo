        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAs fans eagerly awaited what's next post \"Fast X\", Dwayne Johnson spilled the beans on an upcoming spin-off.\n\nThe Fast & Furious universe, which began in 2001 with \"The Fast and the Furious\", has grown into a massive universe with Vin Diesel and Universal Studios. Having evolved from a street racing film to a globally acclaimed franchise, it boasts an astounding cumulative gross of over $7 billion.\n\nWhat’s next in the Fast and Furious series?\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Reyes\n\nAs fans eagerly awaited what's next post \"Fast X\", Dwayne Johnson spilled the beans on an upcoming spin-off. With Johnson reprising his role as Hobbs and Jason Momoa stepping into the shoes of Fast X's villain, Dante Reyes, \"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Reyes\" is all set to serve as a link between \"Fast X\", \"Hobbs & Shaw\", and the forthcoming \"Fast & Furious 11\". Although its release date remains speculative, it's slated to hit the screens before 2025, promising an ensemble of star-studded producers and writers.\n\nFast & Furious 11:\n\nLouis Leterrier, renowned for directing action-packed movies, was confirmed as the director of \"Fast & Furious 11\" in April 2023. With Christina Hodson and Oren Uziel on board as screenwriters, the movie is set to continue from where \"Fast X\" and \"Hobbs & Reyes\" left off. The climax of \"Fast X\" hinted at Reyes targeting Shaw and raised questions about the fate of Dominic Toretto and his son. With an initial release date of April 4, 2025, fans are keenly awaiting to see how the story unfolds.\n\nFast & Furious 12:\n\nDespite the buzz around \"Fast & Furious 12\", Universal Studios remains tight-lipped. Vin Diesel's comments about a possible trilogy following \"Fast X\" have fueled speculations. The storyline's expansion into a trilogy, while exciting, poses challenges in keeping the narrative tight without appearing as a mere cash grab.\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw 2\n\nAfter the success of \"Hobbs & Shaw\" in 2019, Universal greenlit a sequel with Chris Morgan penning the script. However, the journey of this sequel has been marred with delays due to global disruptions and strikes. The announcement of the \"Hobbs & Reyes\" spin-off further clouds its future. Yet, the absence of official updates keeps the hope alive for the sequel or a potential spin-off series focused on Deckard Hobbs.\n\nAn All-Female Spinoff in the Horizon\n\nAn exciting development in the Fast & Furious universe is the all-female spinoff. Screenwriters Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, who have showcased their prowess in blockbusters like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Captain Marvel\", and \"Pet Sematary: Bloodlines\", are set to helm this project.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWho is Vin Diesel?\n\nVin Diesel, whose real name is Mark Sinclair, is an American actor, producer, director, and screenwriter. He was born on July 18, 1967, in Alameda County, California. Diesel is best known for his role as Dominic Toretto in the \"Fast & Furious\" film franchise.\n\nWhen was Fast and Furious 1 released?\n\n\"Fast & Furious 1,\" originally titled \"The Fast and the Furious,\" was released on June 22, 2001.\n\nWho is Vin Diesel?\n\nVin Diesel, whose real name is Mark Sinclair, is an American actor, producer, director, and screenwriter.
