        "text": "Fast X is out now in cinemas to mark the beginning of the end for the Fast & Furious franchise.\n\nThe first part of a potentially three-part finale to the Fast Saga contains plenty of surprises for fans, and also delves into the series' past more than ever by introducing the previously-unknown son of Fast Five villain Hernan Reyes.\n\nYou might think that the lucrative franchise about cars that go vroom (and often boom) would be really straightforward, but you'd be wrong. Dom and his familia have been on a long and winding journey, and if you want to catch up ahead of Fast X, you'll need to plan out your rewatch.\n\nWe're here to help with the ultimate chronological order of the entire Fast & Furious franchise. Our guide is equally useful if you're diving into the franchise for the first time, but be warned, you'll be hooked before you know it. Slight spoilers within…\n\n1. The Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nIntroducing:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nMia Toretto (Jordana Brewster)\n\nVince (Matt Schulze)\n\nHector (Noel Gugliemi)\n\nAgent Bilkins (Thom Barry)\n\nBased on a newspaper article about street racers, the film that started it all focuses on undercover police officer Brian and his attempt to infiltrate ex-convict Dom's gang.\n\nEssentially a remake of Point Break (but even better), the movie sees Brian being seduced by Dom's 'ride or die' attitude, and the rest is history. Little did we know that the film would kick off one of the highest-grossing franchises ever made, especially considering what came next...\n\n2. Turbo-Charged Prelude (2003)\n\nReturning:\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nA largely silent short film that bridges the gap between the first and second movies. It was released on the DVD of 2 Fast 2 Furious, but now you can watch it on YouTube above. It explains how Brian was eventually arrested by the LAPD for letting Dom go.\n\nThe short film also explains just how Brian was able to turn himself into a street king in such a short space of time despite being a wanted man. Plus, Friday Night Lights star Minka Kelly appears as a character known purely as 'Girl'. Sadly, she doesn't return in future movies.\n\n3. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nAgent Bilkins (Thom Barry)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nMonica Fuentes (Eva Mendes)\n\nEasily the worst movie in the franchise, but it still has its moments (and was the flick that welcomed future franchise stalwarts Roman and Tej). Plus, Brian is peak bro in this film. It's a personality trait we didn't witness before and haven't since, and it's a beauty to behold.\n\nGiven this is the only film in the franchise not to feature Vin at all, it's a wonder that the series was able to survive after this silly sequel. But the later films still found a way of connecting 2 Fast 2 Furious to the overall series, which is damn impressive. (Even X-Men pretended The Last Stand and Origins: Wolverine didn't happen...)\n\n4. Los Bandoleros (2009)\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nTego Leo (Tego Calderón)\n\nRico Santos (Don Omar)\n\nThis second short DVD extra film helps bring fans up to speeed before Vin's full comeback in Fast & Furious. It also introduces new characters Han, Rico, and Tego — although Han first appeared in Tokyo Drift, but we'll get to that.\n\nLos Bandoleros shows what Dom has been up to in the Dominican Republic and how he rekindles his relationship with Letty. Annoyingly, the one thing it doesn't explain is how the hell Brian went from street dude at the end of 2 Fast to a kick-ass FBI agent in Fast & Furious, but we'll let it power slide.\n\nCheck it out on YouTube above.\n\n5. Fast & Furious (2009)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nMia Toretto (Jordana Brewster)\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nTego Leo (Tego Calderon)\n\nRico Santos (Don Omar)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nGisele (Gal Gadot)\n\nAgent Michael Stasiak (Shea Whigham)\n\nArturo Braga (John Ortiz)\n\nWhile this isn't a perfect movie, it was definitely a huge improvement and got people interested in these characters once again. Though, they could have called it something else, surely?\n\nBrian and Dom are face-to-face once more, and the ultimate action movie bromance is born.\n\n6. Fast Five (Fast & Furious 5) (2011)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nMia Toretto (Jordana Brewster)\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nGisele (Gal Gadot)\n\nVince (Matt Schulze)\n\nTego Leo (Tego Calderon)\n\nRico Santos (Don Omar)\n\nMonica Fuentes (Eva Mendes – post-credits)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nLuke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)\n\nElena Neves (Elsa Pataky)\n\nNow, THIS film made people stand up and say: \"Shit, since when did Fast and Furious films get awesome?\" Dropping the street-racing focus and shifting to heist action certainly helped, but also introducing 'franchise-saver' Dwayne Johnson into the mix was inspired.\n\nRoman and Tej are back from the second film, and even Vince from the very first movie returns to make a bloated cast list that somehow works perfectly.\n\n7. Fast & Furious 6 (2013)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nGisele (Gal Gadot)\n\nLuke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)\n\nElena Neves (Elsa Pataky)\n\nAgent Michael Stasiak (Shea Whigham)\n\nArturo Braga (John Ortiz)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nOwen Shaw (Luke Evans)\n\nDeckard Shaw (Jason Statham – post-credits)\n\nWe picked this as our favourite Fast & Furious movie so far. After surpassing everyone's expectations in Fast Five (they decided to be Furious again in this one), the franchise upped the ante with its insane action sequences and settled on a perfect crew. Seeing the Rock smash London to bits is worth the ticket price alone.\n\nLetty is back after one movie away and that moment when the Stath suddenly shows up when you're least suspecting it is one of the best post-credit reveals ever.\n\n8. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel – cameo)\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nSean Boswell (Lucas Black)\n\nNeela Ezar (Nathalie Kelley)\n\nTwinkie (Bow Wow)\n\nEarl Hu (Jason Tobin)\n\nThis is where it gets truly confusing. Although this was the third Fast film to be released, it's actually the sixth film chronologically.\n\nThis side-step to Tokyo drops Dom and Brian and focuses on future 'drift king' Sean. They could easily have just kept this as a spin-off movie that had little to do with the overall franchise, but in true geek style, they made the climax of the film an important plot device for a sequel that arrived nine years later.\n\nEssentially this was all down to Han, who's killed off in this film, but everyone loved him so much that they came up with a way of bringing him back into the narrative by delaying the inevitable (complete with hilarious conversation about him 'moving to Tokyo' at every opportunity).\n\nIt doesn't make sense as to why Sean appeared to age 10 years in between scenes in the next film, but oh well. Also, try to ignore all the 2006 technology hanging around and pretend that Han and co. just loved being all retro.\n\nIf you wanted to geek out even further, Han actually appears in the film , also directed by Justin Lin (who directed Tokyo Drift to 6).\n\n9. Furious 7 (Fast & Furious 7) (2015)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nBrian O'Conner (Paul Walker)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nMia Toretto (Jordana Brewster)\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nLuke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)\n\nSean Boswell (Lucas Black)\n\nElena Neves (Elsa Pataky)\n\nDeckard Shaw (Jason Statham)\n\nHector (Noel Gugliemi – cameo)\n\nOwen Shaw (Luke Evans – cameo)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nMr Nobody (Kurt Russell)\n\nRamsey (Nathalie Emmanuel)\n\nAfter finally making Tokyo Drift part of the main plot, the franchise is no longer technically one big prequel series. In this film, the remaining crew faces off against their biggest problem to date: Jason Statham.\n\nFurious 7 became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time and manages to handle the passing of lead star Paul Walker remarkably well.\n\n10. The Fate of the Furious (Fast & Furious 8) (2017)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nLuke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)\n\nElena Neves (Elsa Pataky)\n\nDeckard Shaw (Jason Statham)\n\nMr Nobody (Kurt Russell)\n\nRamsey (Nathalie Emmanuel)\n\nOwen Shaw (Luke Evans)\n\nTego Leo (Tego Calderon – cameo)\n\nRico Santos (Don Omar – cameo)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nEric Reisner (Scott Eastwood)\n\nCipher (Charlize Theron)\n\nMagdalene Shaw (Helen Mirren)\n\nWith Brian and Mia in retirement, Dom is forced to go rogue and betray his family after big baddie Cipher blackmails him into working for her.\n\nMr Nobody enlists Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw to work with Hobbs and his team to find Dom, take down Cipher, and save the world in the process.\n\n11. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)\n\nWatch now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nLuke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)\n\nDeckard Shaw (Jason Statham)\n\nMagdalene Shaw (Helen Mirren)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nHattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby)\n\nBrixton (Idris Elba)\n\nMadam M (Eiza González)\n\nJonah Hobbs (Cliff Curtis)\n\nMateo Hobbs (Roman Reigns)\n\nHobbs and Shaw are forced to team up to take down cyber-genetically enhanced bad guy Brixton and stop a bio-threat that could change humanity forever.\n\nAnd it's a family affair, too. Shaw's sister Hattie is along for the ride, as is Hobbs's extended family in Samoa.\n\nGiven that Hobbs is unlikely to return in the two-part finale, we wouldn't be surprised if this spin-off ends up being ignored entirely from Fast canon — although the Shaw family will all be back in Fast X.\n\n12. Fast and Furious 9 (2021)\n\nWatch Now: | |\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nMia Toretto (Jordana Brewster)\n\nRamsey (Nathalie Emmanuel)\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nMagdalene Shaw (Helen Mirren)\n\nCipher (Charlize Theron)\n\nSean Boswell (Lucas Black)\n\nTwinkie (Bow Wow)\n\nEarl Hu (Jason Tobin)\n\nAgent Michael Stasiak (Shea Whigham – cameo)\n\nRico Santos (Don Omar – cameo)\n\nDeckard Shaw (Jason Statham – post-credits)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nJakob Toretto (John Cena)\n\nLeysa (Cardi B)\n\nElle (Anna Sawai)\n\nBuddy (Michael Rooker)\n\nJack Toretto (JD Pardo)\n\nIn Fast & Furious 9, Dom faces his most dangerous adversary yet: his long-lost (and previously unheard-of) brother Jakob Toretto.\n\nIt's up to Dom's crew to save the world again as Jakob goes after another technological MacGuffin, Project Aries, that could control every weapons system in the world. Worse yet, he might be working with Cipher to get his hands on it.\n\nBut wait, that's not all. Han is back – and he's alive! Turns out that Mr Nobody faked Han's death in Tokyo, and he's now firmly back with the familia.\n\nTechnically, if you're being rigid with your chronological order, you'd have to watch the flashbacks in F9 before every other movie since they tell the story of the death of Dom and Jakob's father back in 1989. (Vinnie Bennett and Finn Cole take on the roles of young Dom and Jakob, respectively.)\n\nBut since these scenes are scattered throughout the movie, that might make it a bit tricky, so it's okay if you just watch them now.\n\n13. Fast X (2023)\n\nWatch Now: Cinemas\n\nReturning:\n\nDominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nRoman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson)\n\nTej Parker (Ludacris)\n\nMia Toretto (Jordana Brewster)\n\nRamsey (Nathalie Emmanuel)\n\nHan (Sung Kang)\n\nMagdalene Shaw (Helen Mirren)\n\nCipher (Charlize Theron)\n\nDeckard Shaw (Jason Statham)\n\nJakob Toretto (John Cena)\n\nScott Eastwood (Little Nobody)\n\nLuis Da Silva Jr (Diogo)\n\nDwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs)\n\nGal Gadot (Gisele)\n\nIntroducing:\n\nJason Momoa (Dante Reyes)\n\nBrie Larson (Tess)\n\nAlan Ritchson (Aimes)\n\nDaniela Melchior (Isabel)\n\nRita Moreno (Abuelita Toretto)\n\nLeo Abelo Perry (Brian Marcos)\n\nYou thought that Dom faced his most dangerous adversary yet in Fast & Furious 9? Think again as Fast X definitely introduces Dom's most dangerous adversary to date.\n\nDante Reyes is the previously-unknown son of Fast Five villain Hernan Reyes and while the movie does feature flashbacks to Fast Five, you can just watch Fast X at the end of the current timeline as it'd be tricky to separate those flashbacks out chronologically.\n\nDom's entire extended family is at risk in Fast X as they're scattered across the globe after being branded terrorists by the Agency, now run by Aimes (who it's revealed has been working with Dante all along).\n\nCue a dramatic finale in Portugal that leaves numerous characters' fates up in the air and plenty of mysteries to be resolved, including two surprise returns (one from the dead) in the already-confirmed Fast & Furious 11."
