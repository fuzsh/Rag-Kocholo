It is the film adaptation of the racing video game franchise of the same name by Electronic Arts. The film stars Aaron Paul, Dominic Cooper, Scott Mescudi in his feature film debut, Imogen Poots, Ramón Rodríguez, Rami Malek, and Michael Keaton. It tells the story of street racer Tobey Marshall, who sets off to race cross-country as a way of avenging his friend's death at the hands of a rival racer, Dino Brewster.\n\nNeed for Speed was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through the Touchstone Pictures label on March 14, 2014. After its release, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews, criticizing its story, direction, and the performances of the supporting cast, though some praised Paul's performance. Despite grossing $203.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $66 million, the film was deemed a box-office disappointment in the United States.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nTobey Marshall is a former race car driver who owns his late father's garage, Marshall Performance Motors, in Mount Kisco, New York, where he and his friends tune performance cars. Struggling to make ends meet, he and his crew participate in street races after hours. After a race, Tobey's former rival Dino Brewster conscripts them into completing the build of a rare Ford Shelby Mustang worked on by the late Carroll Shelby, in exchange for 25% of the car's sales revenue. The completed Mustang is displayed for auction at a party in New York City. Tobey and Dino meet Julia Maddon, an English car broker whose client, Bill Ingram, wants to purchase the car if they can prove it will drive over 230 mph, as Tobey claims. Despite Dino's objections, Tobey takes the Mustang to a local race track and successfully drives it at 234 mph, convincing Ingram to purchase it for $2.7 million.\n\nEnraged by Tobey's disobedience to his objections, Dino challenges Tobey and his friend Pete to a race after Pete flatly tells Dino that everyone knows Tobey is a better driver than him. Dino offers to relinquish his entire share of the Mustang sale if Tobey wins, otherwise Tobey will have to forfeit his share. He challenges them to race with his uncle's three Koenigsegg Agera R cars illegally imported from Europe. On the home stretch, realizing he is about to lose the race, Dino intentionally bumps into Pete's car, sending it down a ravine and killing Pete as it bursts into flames. Dino disappears from the scene, while Tobey is arrested by the police and sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, unable to prove Dino was there.\n\nUpon his release on parole, Tobey sets out to avenge Pete's death. He borrows Ingram's Mustang to enter the De Leon, a winner-takes-all exotic car race organized by the mysterious Monarch, but as a condition, Ingram requires Julia to accompany Tobey while Tobey is driving the Mustang. The pair have 45 hours to reach San Francisco before the race starts. In Detroit, they cause an interstate chase with the Michigan State Police and upload the footage. Dino offers his rare Lamborghini Sesto Elemento to anyone who can stop Tobey entering the race, causing a group of truckers to go after the Mustang as well. Julia retaliates by convincing Monarch of Tobey's innocence, securing his invitation to the De Leon.\n\nIn Utah, Tobey and Julia are ambushed by truckers, forcing them off the road. Benny, a member of Tobey's crew, appears in a military helicopter stolen from the National Guard, and carries the Mustang mid-air to Tobey's crew at the Bonneville Salt Flats, getting himself arrested in the process. Tobey and Julia reach San Francisco's Mark Hopkins Hotel in time to register for the race, but on Nob Hill, a tow truck operated by one of Dino's henchmen smashes into the Mustang, wrecking it and injuring Julia. Desperate to get another car for the race, Tobey meets his ex-girlfriend and Pete's sister, Anita, who is now Dino's fiancée. Having discovered Dino's involvement in Pete's death, Anita gives Tobey the location of Dino's hidden Koenigsegg, which Tobey and crew member Joe extract. Tobey meets Julia at a San Francisco hospital, confessing his feelings for her with a kiss and letting her know that he has a \"fast\" car, and that this is for Pete.\n\nThe next morning, Tobey surprises Dino by not only showing up in the red Koenigsegg he drove when Pete was killed, but also giving him Anita's engagement ring, informing Dino that she is through with him. In the ensuing race along the Pacific Coast Highway, the racers and pursuing California Highway Patrol officers crash one-by-one, leaving Tobey and Dino racing side-by-side. Dino attempts to ram Tobey the same way he killed Pete, but Tobey dodges, causing Dino to crash and flip over. Tobey pulls Dino from the wreckage before reaching the finish line, but not without punching Dino to avenge Pete; both are subsequently apprehended by the police, with Dino eventually convicted of the murder of Pete.\n\n178 days later, Tobey is released, and Julia meets him at the prison gates in a 2015 Ford Mustang. The couple drives to a prison in Utah, where Benny is getting released early for good behavior.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAaron Paul as Tobey Marshall, a blue-collar mechanic and skilled former race car driver from Mount Kisco, New York who is framed for a federal crime he didn't commit.\n\nDominic Cooper as Dino Brewster, a former Indy racer and Tobey's fierce rival.\n\nImogen Poots as Julia Maddon, a savvy exotic car broker, who becomes Tobey's love interest.\n\nScott Mescudi as Sergeant Benny \"Maverick\" Jackson, a member of Tobey's crew, and a former National Guard soldier.

He is the crew's professional mechanic, and drives a modified 2011 Ford F-450 called \"The Beast\".\n\nRami Malek as Finn, a member of Tobey's crew.

Interscope Records released a separate EP on April 8, 2014, which featured four songs; \"Fortunate Son\" and \"Back in the Saddle\" by Aloe Blacc, \"All Along the Watchtower\" by Jamie N Commons, and \"Hero\" by Kid Cudi featuring Skylar Grey. Linkin Park's song \"Roads Untraveled\" from their 2012 album Living Things was also featured in the film. [21]\n\nMarketing and release\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 25, 2013, a trailer for the film was released on iTunes.[22] Disney and DreamWorks Pictures announced the film's post-production conversion to 3D on February 5, 2014.[23] Need for Speed held its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre on March 7, 2014.[24] The film was released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through the Touchstone Pictures banner on March 14, 2014, in selected 3D, IMAX, 4DX and 2D theaters.[25] It was also released worldwide by Disney, except for certain international territories, where the rights are sold by Mister Smith Entertainment to other industries. Reliance Entertainment had released the film in India, while Entertainment One released it in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe video game Need for Speed Rivals released downloadable content (DLC) on March 11, 2014 which added cars that appeared in the movie to the game.[26]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nNeed for Speed was released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, DVD and 3D Blu-ray on August 5, 2014.[27]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nNeed for Speed grossed $43.6 million in North America and $159.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $203.3 million.[7]\n\nIn North America, it topped the box office with $6.7 million on its opening Friday, March 14, 2014.[28] However, the film finished in third place over the three-day weekend with $17.8 million.[29][30] Outside North America, the film debuted in first place with $45.6 million on the same weekend as its North America release.[31] It remained in first place for a second weekend.[32] Overall, the film's largest territory is China, where both the film's opening weekend ($21.1 million)[33] and its total earnings ($66.2 million)[34] are higher than in North America. Following these two territories in total earnings is Russia and the CIS with $13.8 million.[35]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 186 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With stock characters and a preposterous plot, this noisily diverting video game adaptation fulfills a Need for Speed and little else.\"[36] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 39 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[37] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[38]\n\nMichael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, remarking that \"Paul has talent, though the actor's idea of simmering intensity in the context of Need for Speed comes off more like a serial killer in the making. Cooper, by contrast, seems to be having some fun playing a dashing, dastardly, sexy beast.\" Phillips added, \"At its occasional best, the thrills in the film recall the delirious fun of the Fast & Furious franchise.\"[39] Betsy Sharkey of Los Angeles Times felt similarly, writing \"In trying for the vicarious varoom of the street-racing video game that inspired it, and no doubt dreaming of Fast success, Speed clocks in at a long two-plus hours and falls painfully short.\"[40] Jason Torchinsky of the automotive blog Jalopnik decried the movie for insulting gearheads with its far-reaching suspension of disbelief on many plot points and tropes and stated the film was nothing more than a glorified car commercial for the 2015 Ford Mustang.[41]\n\nDanny Korecki of automotive outlet The Drive discussed the thought that the Need for Speed film may have been better had it been a TV series.[42]\n\nA.O. Scott of The New York Times gave a more positive review, praising the film's car chase sequences, while declaring the overall film \"an energetic, unpretentious B movie\".[43]\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, China Movie Channel and Jiaflix Enterprises teamed up with EA Games to develop a sequel with the film to be set and shot in China.[44]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of films based on video games\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
