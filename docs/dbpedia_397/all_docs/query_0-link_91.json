        "text": "Reading Strategy: Previewing\n\nWhat It Is\n\nPreviewing is a strategy that readers use to recall prior knowledge and set a purpose for reading. It calls for readers to skim a text before reading, looking for various features and information that will help as they return to read it in detail later. Think about the word itself in parts. “Pre” is prefix that means “before” and the word “viewing” is to see. You are quite literally thinking about how to see before you read.\n\nWhy Previewing Matters\n\nAccording to research, previewing a text can improve your comprehension (Graves, Cooke, & LaBerge, 1983, cited in Paris et al., 1991). You set a purpose for your reading to help you prepare for what’s coming next.\n\nDepending on the genre, or the kind of reading, your approach to previewing may vary:\n\nTo preview nonfiction, find out what you know about the subject and what you want to find out. This also helps to understand how an author has organized information.\n\nTo preview biographies, determine something about the person in the biography, the time period, and some possible places and events in the life of the person.\n\nTo preview fiction, determine characters, setting, and plot. Preview to make predictions about a story’s problems and solutions.\n\nHow To Use Previewing\n\nTo preview a text before you read, first ask yourself whether the text is based on reality or true events (nonfiction) or if it’s creative story (fiction).\n\nIf the text is fiction or biography, look at the title, chapter headings, introductory notes, and illustrations for a better understanding of the content and possible settings or events.\n\nIf the text is nonfiction, look at text features and illustrations (and their captions) to determine the subject matter and to recall prior knowledge, to decide what you already know about the subject. Previewing also helps you figure out what you don’t know and what you need to learn.\n\nHow to Preview\n\nThink of previewing a text as similar to creating a movie trailer. A successful preview for either a movie or a reading experience will capture what the overall work is going to be about, generally what expectations the audience can have of the experience to come, how the piece is structured, and what kinds of patterns will emerge.\n\nWhen you preview, you look for signposts by making a note of graphic aids such as figures, tables, charts, graphs, and images. You can get a lot of information about the reading itself if there are images included. You may also want to note typographical aids such as bold-faced or highlighted words and phrases. Previewing engages your prior experience, and asks you to think about what you already know about this subject matter, or this author, or this publication. Then anticipate what new information might be ahead of you when you return to read this text more closely."
