        "text": "Theater counts: Spider-Man weaves its way into theaters, but The Little Mermaid remains widest release\n\nJune 1st, 2023\n\nAfter a robust Memorial day weekend start, The Little Mermaid retains its opening count of 4,320 theaters from last week, once again owning the title of widest release on both land and sea. The latest adaptation of the charming franchise gathered $95.58 million from North American theaters, while earning less overseas with a take of $68.3 million. This week however the film will slip into second place at the box office as Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings into theaters. More...\n\nTheater counts: The Little Mermaid makes a splash in 4,320 theaters\n\nMay 25th, 2023\n\nIt’s a very solid weekend for moviegoers as not only are there five new wide releases arriving in cinemas, but films like Fast X and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 are still pulling in respectable numbers and are available in around 4,000 locations. Despite being the second-widest release in its big screen debut last weekend, the former sped away with the best numbers at the box office, scoring just over $67 million over the weekend and currently enjoying a six-day domestic total of $81.9 million. This weekend though, all eyes are on The Little Mermaid. More...\n\nWeekend projections: Fast X has biggest international opening of 2023 to date\n\nMay 21st, 2023\n\nFast X won’t quite hit the $70-million plus North American opening that looked on the cards on Friday, but $67.5 million is a very respectable number for a domestic debut—the fifth-best opening of 2023 in fact. More impressively, it’ll clock up a projected $251.39 million internationally, giving it the biggest weekend outside North America so far this year. More...\n\nWeekend predictions: Fast X could be speeding towards $70-million plus opening\n\nMay 19th, 2023\n\nAnother weekend, another film from a venerable franchise. Technically, no super heroes are involved this time, but there’s certainly an element of the unreal in the Fast and Furious franchise, which draws up to the starting line for either the tenth or eleventh time, depending on how one’s counting, this weekend. Fast X will win the weekend comfortably, and our model thinks it could make a fast start. More...\n\nTheater counts: Fast X races into 4,046 theaters, but Guardians still widest in the galaxy\n\nMay 18th, 2023\n\nEntering its third week at the box office, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will three-peat as the widest release by retaining its count of 4,450 theaters from its first two weeks. The film currently enjoys a global box office total of $545 million, with $231 million of that coming from North American cinemas. Unlike last week and next week, we see only one wide release hitting theaters, but it’s a big one: Fast X. More...\n\nWeekend projections: Black Adam and Ticket to Paradise both out-perform expectations\n\nOctober 23rd, 2022\n\nBlack Adam should hit $67 million over its opening weekend, and Ticket to Paradise will post around $16.3 million, according to studio estimates released on Sunday morning. Both films are over-performing compared to our model’s prediction going into the weekend. Even though neither is breaking records, their relative strength is some much-needed good news for the industry, particularly considering the weakness of some other top 10 films. More...\n\nTheater Counts: Black Widow will debut in 4,160 theaters\n\nJuly 8th, 2021\n\nAfter two weeks on top of both the box office charts and the theater count list, F9: The Fast Saga will take a back seat to the long-awaited arrival of Black Widow. The film from Walt Disney Pictures and Marvel Studios will debut in 4,160 theaters and will also be available to order on Disney+ with Premier Access. That theater count is a shade lower than the 4,179 theaters F9 opened in over the June 25 weekend, but still the second best of the pandemic era. More...\n\nWeekend predictions: F9 eyeing a $70-million opening\n\nJune 25th, 2021\n\nThere’s no question which film will top the box office this weekend. F9: The Fast Saga has long been anticipated as a landmark release as theaters reopen around North America, pandemic restrictions are lifted, and audiences regain their appetite for sitting in an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers. It doesn’t even have much competition—$6 million might be enough for it to win the weekend, and it already earned more than that in previews last night. The real question is how much it will bring in this weekend. Given its pedigree and buzz, the minimal benchmark for success is the $47.6 million earned by A Quiet Place: Part II on its Friday–Sunday opening weekend over the Memorial Day holiday. All the signs are that it will go much higher than that.\n\nHere’s what our model has to say this morning… More...\n\nTheater Counts: F9 races to the top in its domestic debut\n\nJune 24th, 2021\n\nF9: The Fast Saga, the highly anticipated 9th installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise roars into North American theaters this weekend. The film, which stars an action-packed ensemble cast and is directed by Justin Lin, is being released in 4,179 theaters. The Universal Pictures blockbuster sequel has already generated over $293 million worldwide and is the only wide release to launch this weekend. Domestic theaters have not seen such a vast opening since Disney released Onward, back on March 6, 2020. The franchise has brought in $1.7b domestically, $6.2b worldwide and ranks 15th in all time franchise earnings when adjusted for inflation. The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard—last weekend’s box office winner—adds theaters this week, going from 3,331 to 3,361. A Quiet Place: Part II enters its fourth week by playing in 3,124 locations, while Peter Rabbit 2: The Runway drops from 3,346 theaters last week to 3,331 this week. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for November 5th, 2019\n\nNovember 6th, 2019\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw is easily the biggest release of the week, but it is not the best. Pick of the Week contenders include Galaxy Quest and Good Omens, as well as Alice, Sweet Alice, which arrived late. I’m going with Good Omens, but all three are must haves. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray and DVD Review: Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw\n\nNovember 5th, 2019\n\nFast and the Furious is one of the largest franchises around with the nine installments so far earning nearly $6 billion worldwide. However, it appears to be off its peak as far as ticket sales are concerned with Hobbs & Shaw having the lowest box office haul since Fast Five exploded the franchise into the top-tier. Is the franchise off its peak in terms of quality as well? If so, is Hobbs & Shaw still worth checking out? Or is it time for fans to move on? More...\n\nHome Market Releases for October 15th, 2019\n\nOctober 17th, 2019\n\nIt’s a really slow week with Crawl being the biggest release of the week, and it wasn’t a monster hit at the box office. Fortunately, it is also the best DVD / Blu-ray release of the week and was the only real contender for Pick of the Week. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: It Earns Itself First Place\n\nSeptember 12th, 2019\n\nIt: Chapter Two matched its domestic opening weekend internationally, earning $94.0 million on 26,790 screens in 75 markets over the weekend. Unlike the film’s domestic debut, its international opening was close to on par with the first It’s debut, in local currencies not counting inflation. In fact, Chapter Two had a faster start in Russia earning $9.20 million to $7.28 million for its predecessor. The film had nearly identical openings in both Mexico ($9.14 million) and in the U.K. ($9.06 million). The film opens in France this weekend, while it doesn’t finish off its international run until it debuts in Japan in November. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Hobbs and Shaw Plummet in China Still Top the International Chart\n\nSeptember 4th, 2019\n\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw had a very steep decline in China, but still managed to earn first place on the international chart with $37.9 million in 68 markets over the weekend for totals of $528.7 million internationally and $$687.9 million worldwide. The film plummeted 72% during its second weekend in China earning $27.65 million for a two-week total of $170.36 million. This drop-off is extreme, even for China. However, it doesn’t matter. The movie will hit $200 million in that market and $700 million worldwide, which is more than enough to break even and get yet another installment in the franchise. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Hobbs and Shaw have a Fantastically Fast Start in China\n\nAugust 28th, 2019\n\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw roared back into first place on the international chart earning $119.4 million in 68 markets for totals of $440.4 million internationally and $588.1 million worldwide. This includes a first place, three-day $99.08 million debut in China, for a total opening in the market of $103.06 million. Granted, films tend to have short legs in China, but a start like this will still give the film an easy time reaching $700 million worldwide, which is enough to be a financial success, even if it doesn’t match the previous installments in the franchise. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Hollywood Goes Global\n\nAugust 21st, 2019\n\nOnce Upon a Time... In Hollywood started its international run in earnest with $48.53 million over the three-day weekend, $55.22 million including previews and weekdays. It was playing on 10,054 screens in 59 markets and has a running tally of $65.44 million after two weeks of release. Its biggest market of the weekend was either France or the U.K., depending on how you look at it. In the former, it earned first place with $7.08 million on 683 screens. It also opened in first place in the latter with $6.22 million on 708 screens over the weekend, and had a total opening of $9.16 million. It also had strong openings in Germany ($5.06 million on 820 screens over the weekend for a total opening of $5.82 million); Australia ($4.52 million on 299 screens); and Spain ($2.41 million on 869 screens over the weekend for a total opening of $3.63 million). More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Nezha is Not Going Away\n\nAugust 14th, 2019\n\nNezha remains the top draw in its native China and internationally. This weekend, it pulled in $68.97 million for a total of $512.19 million after nearly four full weeks of release. This doesn’t just make the movie the highest-grossing animated film in China, it more than doubles the previous record set by Zootopia. Additionally, it has entered the top five all-time in China, in local currencies, and will soon climb into fourth place over Operation Red Sea. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Hobbs and Shaw Survive Their Sophomore Stint\n\nAugust 12th, 2019\n\nThe weekend box office was mediocre with many of the new releases missing expectations, and some of them had low expectations to begin with. Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw was able to remain in first place, but on the low end of expectations, leaving Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark as the biggest positive news of the weekend. Overall, the weekend box office was 11% lower than last weekend at $132 million. Worse still, this is 10% lower than the same weekend last year, leaving 2019 further behind last year’s pace. 2019 is now behind 2018 by 6.2% or $480 million at $7.16 billion to $7.64 billion. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Hobbs and Shaw Fall Short of Nezha\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\n\nNezha continued to grow in China, earning $128.49 million over the weekend, which was not only the best film in China, but the biggest movie internationally. Furthermore, the film has earned $342.33 million, putting it ahead of Zootopia as the biggest animated film of all time in that market. And it didn’t just tiptoe ahead of the competition. Nezha is over $100 million above Zootopia in China. I really hope it gets a release here, as not enough Chinese movies are seen outside of Asia. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Hobbs and Shaw Stumble Out of the Gate\n\nAugust 7th, 2019\n\nIt was a mixed weekend at the box office with Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw missing lofty expectations by a huge margin and this left the box office 8.4% lower than last weekend at $149 million. More importantly, this was 6.9% higher than the same weekend last year. 2019 closed the gap between it and last year a little bit and it is now down by 6.2% or $460 million at $6.96 billion to $7.42 billion. Unfortunately, we really needed a much faster start from Hobbs and Shaw to have a good month, so this might be as good as it gets until September. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: Hobbs and Shaw’s International Numbers Save Weekend Haul\n\nAugust 4th, 2019\n\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw missed even the low end of predictions with an estimated opening weekend of just $60.8 million. This is not a good start for a film that cost $200 million to make. Additionally, its reviews and its A minus from CinemaScore do not suggest long enough legs to make up for this opening. Fortunately, the film is doing a lot better internationally with an estimated opening of $120 million in 63 markets. Furthermore, this number doesn’t include China, because the film doesn’t open there until the end of the month. (It has also yet to open in France, Italy, and Japan, but it will earn more in China than those three markets combined.) The film is opening well behind The Fate of the Furious in most markets, including Russia where it managed $8.20 million on 1,766 screens, compared to $14.26 million on 1,470 screens for the previous film. It was even worse in the U.K. at $7.85 million in 610 theaters vs. $17.58 million on 572. Overall, the film is more in line with Fast Five than the other recent films in the franchise. This is still enough to earn a profit, especially if it does well in China, but the spin-off won’t replace the main films in the Fast and the Furious franchise like I thought it had a chance of doing. More...\n\nFriday Estimates: Hobbs and Shaw has an Impossible Start\n\nAugust 3rd, 2019\n\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw is going to miss predictions, but it did bounce back from weak previews with $23.72 million on Friday. This is higher than Mission: Impossible—Fallout managed during its opening day, despite worse preview numbers. This bodes well for the film’s legs. Its reviews are slightly better than the previous installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, while its A minus from CinemaScore is a little weaker. Universal is projecting a $60 million opening weekend after this result, but studios tend to underestimate these things so it looks like their movies over-performed in the end, so I think $61 million or $62 million is more likely. More...\n\nThursday Night Previews: Are Hobbs and Shaw having a Falling Out with Moviegoers?\n\nAugust 2nd, 2019\n\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw started its box office run with just $5.8 million on Thursday night. That’s not enough. I wasn’t expecting it to reach the same heights at the most recent installments in the Fast and the Furious franchise, as different release dates have different potentials when it comes to previews. However, I was expecting it to earn more than $6 million Mission: Impossible—Fallout earned roughly this time last year. The film’s reviews are good enough that it’s legs shouldn’t be an issue, but this start is worrying. Hopefully it will perform better tonight and reach its full potential over the weekend. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: How Fast can Hobbs and Shaw Start?\n\nAugust 1st, 2019\n\nIt’s the first weekend of August and we have the last potential monster hit of the summer debuting. Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw is the first spin-off in the Fast and the Furious franchise. A lot of people think it will perform weaker at the box office than the other recent films in the franchise, but I think they are underestimating the box office appeal of Dwayne Johnson. Holdovers will be led by The Lion King and Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, both of which should still be major factors at the box office. This weekend last year, Mission: Impossible—Fallout and Christopher Robin combined for just under $60 million. Even throwing in The Spy Who Dumped Me and the top three barely pass $70 million. Hobbs and Shaw should earn more than that by itself, giving 2018 a very strong win in the year-over-year competition. More...\n\n2019 Preview: August\n\nAugust 1st, 2019\n\nJuly bounced back from June with both Spider-Man: Far from Home and The Lion King getting to $1 billion worldwide. Domestically, we are still behind 2018’s pace by more than $400 million, but that’s a substantial improvement over where we were at the start of the month. August should continue this winning streak, at least initially. Hobbs and Shaw could open with close to $100 million, but the only other film opening this month that has a real shot at $100 million in total is Dora and the Lost City of Gold. Last August, both Crazy Rich Asians and The Meg topped $100 million, while Christopher Robin came within 1% of that milestone. This August might be better at the very top, but I don’t think the top three this month will top the top three last month. Maybe if we get a surprise hit, it will, but I’m not willing to bet on that. On the other hand, unless something dramatic happens, 2019 should at least come close to matching last year’s pace and that’s better than most months have done this year. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for June 11th, 2019\n\nJune 12th, 2019\n\nIt is a very busy week on the home market, but like last week, there’s a lot of what would be filler in a normal week. In fact, there’s only one big release, Captain Marvel, which is also one of the better releases on this week’s list. The only other release that was really in contention for Pick of the Week was The Mustang, but the lack of extras on the Blu-ray hurt its chances. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for October 2nd, 2018\n\nOctober 2nd, 2018\n\nIt’s an off week on the home market with no blockbusters to deal with. There are two solid midlevel hits, The First Purge and Sicario: Day of the Soldado, but neither of those are Pick of the Week contenders. (Ant-Man and the Wasp is also coming out this week, but only on Video on Demand). There are some high quality picks: Leave No Trace, Three Identical Strangers, Molly, The Spiral Staircase, and Hyouka. It was a close race, but in the end, I went with Leave No Trace Blu-ray as Pick of the Week. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Will Apes vs. Spider be a One-Sided Fight?\n\nJuly 13th, 2017\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes is going to be the biggest of the three wide releases coming out this week. This much is a near certainty. However, there is some doubt if it will open in first place, or if Spider-Man: Homecoming will remain the top draw over the weekend. The only other wide release of the week is Wish Upon, a low-budget horror film, if it can just reach the top five, then the studio will be very happy. Finally, The Big Sick is expanding wide. Given its limited release run so far, it should become a sleeper hit over the summer. This weekend last year, The Secret Life of Pets and Ghostbusters had a one-two punch of nearly $100 million. I think War for the Planet of the Apes and Spider-Man: Homecoming will top that figure, while the overall depth should help 2017 win in the year-over-year competition, but it will likely be close. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for July 11th, 2017\n\nJuly 11th, 2017\n\nThis week, the home market is led by The Fate of the Furious, which is the number one film both in terms of worldwide box office and alphabetically. It earned well over $1 billion worldwide, but it is losing the charm the franchise thrived on during the past few installments. As for the Pick of the Week, I’m going with Underground, Season Two, or the Two-Season box set. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: Time for Pirates to Sail into the Sunset?\n\nMay 28th, 2017\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is dominating proceedings at the box office this weekend, with Disney projecting an opening of $62.2 million for three days, and $76.6 million over the complete Memorial Day holiday weekend. As I’ve said a few times this year, any other studio would kill for numbers like those, but this marks the third straight decline in the franchise’s fortunes. Dead Man’s Chest had the best opening for any Pirates film, with $135.6 million in 2006; At World’s End did $114.7 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2007; and then On Stranger Tides delivered a $90.2-million debut, also over Memorial Day weekend in 2011. With this kind of start, Dead Men will struggle to deliver $200 million domestically, although its international performance will help make up the numbers. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Furious Fast Start Leads to a Quick Fall with $158.1 million\n\nApril 26th, 2017\n\nThe Fate of the Furious is living fast, but plummeting just as fast down 64% to $158.1 million on 19,757 screens in 65 territories for totals of $745.03 million internationally and $908.34 million worldwide. The film is now the biggest hit of 2017 on the international chart and is behind only Beauty and the Beast on the 2017 worldwide chart. The film’s biggest opening of the past weekend came in Poland where it earned $2.7 million on 187 screens, which is the best opening for the Fast and the Furious franchise in that market. Its biggest market overall continues to be China, where it added $55.28 million over the weekend for a two-week total of $321.65 million. The is the second biggest box office for a Hollywood release in China, behind only Furious 7, which earned $390.87 million there. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Furious Slows and New Releases Stall, Leaving Box Office short by $60 million\n\nApril 25th, 2017\n\nAs expected, The Fate of the Furious dominated the weekend box office chart. It held up a little better than expected with $38.41 million over the weekend; however, this was still over 60% lower than its opening weekend and the overall weekend fell over $60 million or 36% from last weekend for a total of $107 million. A lot of the blame can be pushed onto the new releases, as none of them earned a spot in the top five. Born in China was the best of the new releases earning sixth place with $4.79 million. Year-over-year, 2017 was 16% lower than 2016, but fortunately, 2017 still has an impressive $200 million lead over 2016 at $3.53 billion to $3.33 billion. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: New Releases are Very Forgettable\n\nApril 20th, 2017\n\nLate April is one of the traditional dumping grounds and this week is truly living down to that reputation. There are five new releases that have at least a shot at the top ten, but none of them have a shot at becoming midlevel hits. Unforgettable is the widest new release of the week and will likely be the biggest hit, but it very likely won’t be the best. Free Fire and Born in China are in a close battle for the best reviews for the week. Meanwhile, The Promise and Phoenix Forgotten are just hoping to avoid opening below the Mendoza Line. I think earning a theater average above $2,000 is overly optimistic for either film. There’s a lot of competition, but nearly all of it is terrible, so The Fate of the Furious will have no trouble repeating in first place. Furthermore, both The Boss Baby and Beauty and the Beast will likely remain in the top five, meaning there’s not a lot of room for the other films. This weekend last year, The Jungle Book earned just over $60 million over the weekend, while The Huntsman: Winter’s War opened with close to $20 million. There’s no way 2017 will be able to match this one-two punch. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Furious Goes from Zero to $500 million in one Weekend\n\nApril 19th, 2017\n\nThe Fate of the Furious dominated in the international chart with $433.2 million in 63 markets. This is the biggest international weekend of all time, beating the previous record holder, Jurassic World, by over $100 million. Interestingly, both of these films were released by Universal. Furthermore, the film has already topped the international totals of all but the two more recent installments in the Fast and the Furious franchise. On the downside, the international opening weekend record isn’t the most prestigious record, because it depends a lot of how wide a release a film has. For instance, The Fate of the Furious opened in all but four markets this past weekend and of the remaining markets, only Japan is a significant market. The film has the number one overall international weekend, but only broke weekend records in 20 of the 63 individual markets and only one of those markets could be considered a major market. That one market was China. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Fate Falls to Great Expectations, Still Earns $98.79 million\n\nApril 18th, 2017\n\nAs expected, The Fate of the Furious dominated the box office this weekend, earning nearly a 60% share of the total box office. It did miss predictions, however, with “just” $98.79 million. This is the curse of great expectations. Overall, the box office rose 40% from last weekend, reaching $167 million. However, this was 5.1% lower than the same weekend last year. Had The Fate of the Furious matched expectations, then 2017 would have had a 5% lead over last year. Year-to-date, 2017 has pulled in $3.37 billion and has a 7.2% lead over 2016. That will shrink as last year’s The Jungle Book’s legs will undoubtedly be better than The Fate of the Furious’s legs, but I don’t think 2017 will fall behind 2016 any time soon. More...\n\nFriday Estimates: Fate Set for All-Time Worldwide Weekend Record\n\nApril 15th, 2017\n\nAs expected, The Fate of the Furious dominated at the domestic box office on Friday, earning $45.6 million. This is not the best opening-day record for the franchise—Furious 7 owns that with $67.41 million—and it is almost a third lower than the previous installment, but if it manages the same legs, it will earn just under $100 million over the weekend. Universal is estimating an opening weekend of $103.8 million. Granted, this film’s reviews are 15 points lower than Furious 7’s, and that should hurt its legs. On the other hand, both films earned a solid A from CinemaScore. In fact, every film in the franchise since Fast Five has earned an A from CinemaScore. Consistency. A drop like this is troubling, but it is more than made up for by the film’s international performance… More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Furious is Fated to Outrace the Competition\n\nApril 13th, 2017\n\nThe headline isn’t 100% accurate, because let’s face it, there is no competition this week. The Fate of the Furious is the only wide release of the week (Spark was dropped to select cities.) and it will beat the nearest competition likely by over $100 million. It will likely earn more than the rest of the box office combined will earn. There could be a close race for second place between The Boss Baby and Beauty and the Beast, but for the most part, there will be no mystery at the box office this weekend. As for this weekend last year, it was also really one-sided. The Jungle Book opened with $103.26 million, while Barbershop: The Next Cut was a distant second with $20.24 million. The Fate of the Furious will need to match this one-two punch, or at least come close, for 2017 to continue building on its lead over 2016. I’m cautiously optimistic. More...\n\n2017 Preview: April\n\nApril 1st, 2017\n\nMarch was a month of extremes, led by two strong performances: Beauty and the Beast breaking records and Logan cracking $200 million with ease. There were also two other $100 million hits and another potential $100 million hit that we don’t have significant box office numbers for yet. This is fantastic. On the opposite end, there were three films on last month’s list that didn’t even open truly wide. This month won’t be as lucrative at the top, as The Fate of the Furious is the only film expected to top $100 million. Fortunately, it is expected to open with over $100 million. On the other extreme, there are many, many films on this list that I’m not sure will open wide. Fortunately, last April wasn’t any better. The Jungle Book made nearly $1 billion worldwide, but the other nine films combined made less than half of that. To emphasize: the other nine films that opened last April averaged less than $50 million worldwide each. If The Fate of the Furious can just come close to the previous installment of the franchise, then 2017 has a solid shot at topping 2016. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for March 28th, 2017\n\nMarch 29th, 2017\n\nIt’s a good week for Pick of the Week contenders, as there are seven such releases on this week’s list. Unfortunately, none of them really scream out as The Pick of the Week. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is by far the biggest, but it is only out on Video on Demand right now, while Hidden Figures is the best, but again, it is only on VOD this week. There are also a couple of busted Oscar-bait films, Archer: Season Seven is only getting a DVD release, while the previous seasons came out on Blu-ray. In the end, I went with Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume XXXVIII, partially to celebrate the return of the show. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray and DVD Review: Star Trek Beyond\n\nOctober 31st, 2016\n\nLong time readers don’t need me to explain how much I love Star Trek in all of its incarnations. ... Okay, most of its incarnations. I haven’t been a fan of the first two installments in the reboot franchise. The third film, Star Trek Beyond, was the weakest of them at the box office. Is it also the weakest of the three in quality? Or was the third the charmed? More...\n\n2015 - Holiday Gift Guide - Part I\n\nNovember 27th, 2015\n\nIt's Thanksgiving weekend, which means Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and of course the first installment of our Holiday Gift Guide. This week we will tackle first run releases, as well as franchise box sets. I'm going to try to keep it to a dozen or so releases, as these columns are notorious for getting out of hand. Also, while there were a record number of $1 billion box office hits, there were not as many first run releases that earned stellar reviews this year. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Moviegoers Should be Scared to See a New Release this Weekend\n\nOctober 22nd, 2015\n\nThe box office prediction contests for the past few weeks have had a horror / \"horror\" theme. That is to say, two people won horror movies and the third won movies that were so bad it is scary they exist. There are four new releases this weekend and they all epitomize the latter. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension has a review embargo, which is never a good sign, while the other three wide releases are all earning less than 20% positive reviews. Does that mean there's nothing worth seeing this week? Nope. Fortunately, Steve Jobs is expanding wide and should earn first place at the box office. It is the only film on this week's list with a shot at $20 million. This weekend last year, Ouija nearly reached $20 million and five other films earned $10 million. I don't think we will match that this year. It could be close and any gain or loss in the year-over-year comparison should be in single digits, so there's no reason to be overly concerned. More...\n\nHome Market Numbers: Furious 7 has Mellow Start on the Home Market\n\nOctober 10th, 2015\n\nSix new releases from the week of September 15th reached the top 30 on the combined DVD and Blu-ray chart for September 20th. This includes four in the top five and a new number one. Furious 7 earned first place with 1.87 million units / $31.89 million on the single release for an opening week Blu-ray share of 64%. Impressive. Meanwhile the second Fast and Furious Franchise Box Set released this year earned fifth place with 62,000 units / $3.46 million. While the film very nearly earned twice that of its nearest competitor, it was still almost exactly 40% lower than Fast and Furious 6 opened with. This decline is huge, but all packaged media is down. Some of the slack is going to VOD, but a lot of home market revenue now goes to subscription streaming services like Netflix or Crunchyroll. Personally, I like packaged media, I still buy CDs, so this is bad news for me. More...\n\n2015 Preview: October\n\nOctober 1st, 2015\n\nSeptember ended on a record note with the debut of Hotel Transylvania 2. Additionally, there was great depth and 2015's lead over 2014 grew to nearly $500 million. How do things look going forward? The month starts out with The Martian, which should have no trouble becoming the biggest hit of the month and might even top $200 million. On the other hand, no other film is expected to get to $100 million. There's only one or two that will even come close. Fortunately, last October was very similar with one $100 million hit, Gone Girl, while two other films came close, Annabelle and Fury. It looks like it will be up to the depth films from both years to determine which year comes out on top. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for September 15th, 2015\n\nSeptember 16th, 2015\n\nThis week's home market releases are insane, so I'm going to have to be a lot more judicious in pruning the list. If I were to include all releases that are big enough to include, if they were released during a slow week, there would be more than 100 releases on this week's list (including secondary Blu-rays, but not VOD releases). I have to pare that back to a more reasonable number. Why are there so many releases? Firstly, it is the beginning of the Christmas Shopping season and we have two monster hits on this week's list. Secondly, it is the last week before the fall season begins in earnest, so it is the last week for a lot of shows to come out on DVD before they are running into competition from the new season. It should come as no surprise that the best releases on this week's list are in the TV on DVD categories, including Marvel's Agent Carter: Season 1 and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Season 2. Both of which are co-winners of the Pick of the Week. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray / DVD Review: Furious 7\n\nSeptember 13th, 2015\n\nFurious 7 is the latest in the Fast and the Furious franchise. The films started out okay, but critical reception fell quickly. It wasn't until Fast Five when the filmmakers realized they were making, in essence, live-action cartoons that they truly found their voices. This focus helped the box office, so much so that Furious 7 became just the third film to earn more than $1 billion internationally and just the fourth film to earn $1.5 billion worldwide. Is the quality up to the same level as its box office? The odds of that are nearly zero. However, is it at least as entertaining as its box office numbers would indicate? More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Mission has Impossible Mission\n\nJuly 30th, 2015\n\nMission: Impossible - Rogue Nation shouldn't have any trouble earning first place over the weekend. In fact, it should make more than the rest of the top five combined. On the downside, its real competition isn't the other films in theaters, but Guardians of the Galaxy, which set the August weekend box office record when it opened this weekend last year. Rogue Nation could have a record-opening for the franchise and still not come close to Guardians of the Galaxy. The only other new wide release of the week is Vacation, which started on Wednesday. Its reviews are terrible and its box office chances are not much better. Since nothing will top Guardians of the Galaxy's record-breaking opening, it seems 2015 will end the month on a losing note. Hopefully this is just a momentary hiccup and not an omen for how the rest of the summer will go. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Will May End on a Disastrous Note?\n\nMay 28th, 2015\n\nThe weekend after a holiday is usually a bad weekend at the box office. This time around, San Andreas is the clear front-runner while Aloha might struggle, even as counter-programming. San Andreas will earn more than $30 million over the weekend, no other film is on track to hitting $20 million. On the other hand, there could be six other films that earn $10 million or more over the weekend. By comparison, this weekend last year, Maleficent opened with nearly $70 million, while X-Men: Days of Future Past earned more than $30 million. There's no way the top of the chart will match that. Even with better depth, it is very unlikely 2015 will win in the year-over-year comparison. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Ultron Still the Ultimate Film at the Box Office\n\nMay 8th, 2015\n\nThe Avengers: Age of Ultron remained in top spot on the international chart with $168.8 million in 88 markets over the weekend for totals of $439.8 million internationally and $631.1 million worldwide. The film opened in first place in Mexico with $18.89 million over the weekend for a total opening of $25.5 million. The first film opened with $17.44 million, but it opened on a Friday, so it is a little harder to directly compare the two debuts. Age of Ultron did break the five-day opening record, so the studio has to be happy. It also broke the all-time opening record in Ecuador with $2.08 million on 122 screens over the weekend for a total opening of $2.73 million. It was strong, but not record-breaking, in Thailand, where it earned $3.98 million on 468 screens over the weekend for a total opening of $4.43 million. The same could be said of its openings in Spain ($4.84 million on 905 screens) and Peru ($3.16 million on 407). On the other hand, it opened in second place in Slovenia with $44,000 on 21 screens over the weekend for a total opening of $60,000. It was beat by The SpongBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water's sophomore stint there. I don't know what this means about the market and their opinion of Marvel vs. Sponges, but it is certainly an interesting bit of information. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: The Age of Ultron is Upon Us\n\nApril 30th, 2015\n\nThe Avengers: Age of Ultron got its international run underway a week before its domestic debut and it was an explosive start, with the film earning $200.2 million in 44 markets. These 44 markets represent about 55% of the total international marketplace, while the $200.2 million represents a 44% increase over the first film's debut in those markets. The biggest weekend result came in the U.K. where it pulled in $27.84 million on 583 screens. In South Korea, the film's total opening was $27.97 million on 1,876 screens with $23.05 million of that coming over the weekend. Its U.K. opening was a record for the month of April and the biggest opening of the year so far, but it was less than 10% more than its predecessor's debut there. On the other hand, it more than doubled the original's debut in South Korea. More...\n\nDVD Sales: Interstellar Completes Another Orbit\n\nApril 27th, 2015\n\nThere were no new releases to chart this week. However, there was a new film in top spot, or to be more accurate, a returning film in top spot. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies reclaimed first place with 109,000 units / $1.63 million for the week, giving it totals of 1.06 million units / $15.82 million after three weeks of release. More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Furious Eight... Hundred Million\n\nApril 16th, 2015\n\nFurious 7 remained just as dominant at the international box office this weekend as it did in its opening weekend earning $198.7 million in 66 markets for totals of $550.47 million internationally and $802.0 million worldwide. It became the first film in the franchise and just the 46th film overall to crack the $800 million market worldwide. This past weekend, the film earned first place in China with $63.24 million in just one day. The film opened on Sunday there, with a record opening day for that market, which was close to its opening day domestic box office. The film opened in first place in Russia with $15.86 million on 1,184 screens. At this pace, the film will top $1 billion over the weekend and I can't imagine the studio won't try to make an eighth installment. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Furious Races into Top Spot for the Year\n\nApril 14th, 2015\n\nIt didn't take long for for Furious 7 to become the biggest hit of the year; in fact, it took just five days to top Cinderella. Over the weekend, it became the first film released in 2015 to reach the $200 million milestone and thanks to a better than expected hold, reached $250 million as well. Home finished well back in second place, while The Longest Ride managed third place. Overall, the box office fell 42% from last weekend down to $131 million, which is 6.3% lower than the same weekend last year. Furious 7 topped Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but Rio 2 and the other films of 2014 had better depth giving 2014 the win. 2015 is still ahead in the year-to-date comparison, up 4.1% at $2.85 billion to $2.74 billion. More...\n\nBlu-ray Sales: Battle of the Five Releases\n\nApril 13th, 2015\n\nThere were five or six new releases to reach the top twenty on the Blu-ray sales chart. Leading the way was The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies with 832,000 units / $23.28 million, giving it an opening week Blu-ray share of 55%. This is a strong result, but not an unexpected one, as the film hits the right marks for strong sales on Blu-ray. It is a visually impressive film, it is a fantasy adventure film, and it is based on a popular franchise. The Battle of the Five Armies was also part of a franchise box set, which is the tenth best selling release of the week with 37,000 units / $1.87 million for a 53% opening week Blu-ray share. Technically these are two separate releases, but obviously they are connected enough to mention together. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Longest Ride is a Long Shot for Top Spot\n\nApril 9th, 2015\n\nThere's only one wide release this week, The Longest Ride, but it has an approximately zero percent chance of earning first place. Unless Furious 7 falls about 80% and The Longest Ride beats expectations, it will be no where near top spot. In fact, The Longest Ride likely won't be able to score second place, finishing behind Home. As for this weekend last year, there were three wide releases, led by Rio 2, which earned second place with $39.33 million. The Longest Ride might not make that much in total. On the other hand, the sophomore stint for Furious 7 will top the sophomore stint for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. 2015 will be stronger on top, but that might not be enough to win in the year-over-year comparison. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Seven Does Furious Business\n\nApril 7th, 2015\n\nAs expected, Furious 7 easily won the race for top spot on the weekend box office chart. However, it did so in an unexpectedly robust way, destroying a number of records along the way. This helped the overall box office grow 49% from last weekend to $224 million. More importantly, the overall box office was 34% more than the same weekend last year. Year-to-date, 2015 is now 3.1% above 2014's pace at $2.64 billion to $2.56 billion. Assuming Furious 7 has any legs at all, this lead will continue to grow next weekend. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: Furious 7 Blasts Off with $143.6 Million Weekend\n\nApril 5th, 2015\n\nAfter a massive $67.3 million on Friday, all eyes were on a $150 million weekend for Furious 7. It doesn’t look as though that is to be, with Universal projecting a weekend mark of $143,623,480 on Sunday morning. That’s the biggest April weekend of all time, and the biggest weekend outside the Summer or Thanksgiving holidays. It’s also the ninth-biggest weekend of all time, and, needless to say, franchise record. (Click here for a full list of records.) The studio will be delighted at its biggest weekend ever, and the industry as a whole will be looking forward to a lucrative Summer season with some optimism. More...\n\nFurious 7’s Record-Breaking Box Office\n\nApril 5th, 2015\n\nHere’s a round-up of the records broken by Furious 7 this weekend:\n\n- Biggest weekend in April ever\n\n- Biggest, 2nd-biggest and 8th-biggest days in April\n\n- Biggest weekend of 2015 to date and biggest opening weekend since The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in November, 2013.\n\n- 9th-biggest weekend of all time\n\n- 9th-biggest opening weekend of all time\n\n- 9th-best Friday at the box office\n\n- 9th-fastest film to $100 million in total box office (to be confirmed)\n\n- 11th-biggest single day of all time\n\n- Equal 55th-widest opening\n\n- Full franchise history More...\n\nFurious 7 Opens with Record $67.3 Million on Friday\n\nApril 4th, 2015\n\nRiding a wave of solid reviews and audience approval, Universal will report an estimated $67.3 million at the box office on Friday for Furious 7, based on early tallies. That includes $15.8 million from early shows on Thursday evening, making Friday itself a $50 million day for the film. If the $67.3 million figure holds, it will be the 11th-biggest day reported by a studio, and land just marginally ahead of The Hunger Games’ $67.26 million as the biggest day outside of the Summer and Thanksgiving holidays. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Lucky Number Seven\n\nApril 3rd, 2015\n\nThere's only one wide release this week, but it is expected to be a record-breaking debut. Furious 7 is widely expected to become the first film of 2015 to crack $100 million during its opening weekend. This would also give it the record for biggest April opening, topping the current record-owner, Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Additionally, Home should do well in a counter-programming role and that will also help the box office. This weekend last year was the weekend The Winter Soldier set the April record. Since nearly everyone thinks that record will fall and this year is expected to have better depth, 2015 should win in the year-over-year comparison with relative ease.

April isn't as strong as far as depth goes, as only Furious 7 is expected to come close to $100 million at the box office. On the positive side, it could earn $100 million during its opening weekend, becoming the fastest starting film of the year, so far. On the negative side, it is expected to earn more than double the rest of the films' combined box office totals. Even worse, last April, there were two $100 million hits, including Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as well as two others that came close. There's no way April 2015 is going to live up to April 2014. I just hope the collapse isn't so bad that 2015 loses its lead over 2014 completely.

However, that's really all that's coming out this week. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the biggest of these three hits, but it wasn't the best. The best is Into the Woods and given the lack of competition, the DVD or Blu-ray is the Pick of the Week. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for December 10th, 2013\n\nDecember 10th, 2013\n\nIt's a good week / bad week when it comes to new releases. On the positive side, there are a couple big first run releases, a couple big TV on DVD releases, and even a classic film hitting Blu-ray for the first time. On the other hand, the depth is really bad. If you look at Amazon.com's list of best selling new releases, you will find filler on the second page. That's not to say there are no contenders for Pick of the Week. Despicable Me 2 is the best selling release and the Blu-ray Combo Pack or 3D Combo Pack are also among the best, as is Mary Poppins: 50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray. There are also a few more contenders where I'm waiting for a screener (Berberian Sound Studio, The Hunt, etc.). and it is a busy week for top notch releases. In the end, I went with Despicable Me 2 for that honor, but it was a real coin toss. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray / DVD Review: Fast and Furious 6\n\nDecember 10th, 2013\n\nAs a franchise, Fast and the Furious appeared burnt out in 2009. Tokyo Drift bombed failing to match its production budget domestically and likely losing a ton worldwide. Fast and Furious saw the return of the original cast, which helped it return to previous heights in terms of box office dollars, but critics eviscerated it. Then, defying logic, Fast Five became the biggest hit in the franchise and earned the most critical praise. Can Fast and Furious 6 maintain this momentum? Or was Fast Five just a fluke? More...\n\nInternational Box Office: Pacific Heats Up while Smurfs Feel a Little Blue\n\nAugust 8th, 2013\n\nPacific Rim earned first place over the weekend with $53.0 million in 58 markets for a total of $200.4 million internationally and $293.3 million worldwide. It has made more internationally than it cost to make, but it will still need a lot of help to break even. The film's biggest market over the weekend was China, where it debuted in first place with $45 million. Unfortunately for the film, while studios take about 60% of the box office numbers in the United States (it varies per film) they only get about 20% of the box office in China. Or to be more accurate, they will only get about 20% of the box office, once the sales tax dispute is settled. Right now, they are getting nothing. More...\n\nDVD Sales: Ray of Sunshine for Dark Skies\n\nJune 23rd, 2013\n\nNew releases were really weak with only one reaching the top ten on the DVD sales chart. That film was Dark Skies, which opened in first place with 136,000 units / $2.04 million. This is actually a little better than expected, given its box office numbers. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Superman is Truly Super\n\nJune 17th, 2013\n\nIt was a very good week at the box office with Man of Steel breaking the record for biggest June weekend topping Toy Story 3 by more than $6 million. Nearly every film in the top five matched or beat expectations, which helped the overall box office reach $204 million. This was 37% higher than last weekend and 57% higher than the same weekend last year. Year-to-date, 2013 is still behind 2012, but is has closed the gap to $150 million, or 3.1%, at $4.56 billion to $4.71 billion. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray / DVD Review: Snitch\n\nJune 9th, 2013\n\nSnitch opened in late February, which is not a great time of year to release a major hit. It is not a complete dumping ground like January or September, but most films released during this month will be lucky just to become a midlevel hit. Snitch topped admittedly low expectations becoming a middling hit. A final box office of $43 million isn't bad for that time of year. Does this also describe its quality. Is it not bad, for a February release? Or is it better than its box office numbers would indicate? More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Post-Holiday Slump Sinks Box Office\n\nJune 4th, 2013\n\nAs per usual, the post-holiday weekend suffers a slump, but it was worse than expected with nearly every film failing to live up to predictions. Fast and Furious 6 fell very far, but it still came out on top. Meanwhile, Now You See Me topped expectations and topped After Earth over the weekend. Now You See Me was the one lone bright spot on an otherwise soft weekend, and the overall box office fell 35% to $164 million. On the other hand, this was still 15% higher than the same weekend last year. 2013 was able to pull out the win thanks to a much deeper box office. Six films earned more than $10 million this weekend compared to just three earning more than $10 million last year. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Furious Start Helps Set Records\n\nMay 29th, 2013\n\nMemorial Day long weekend has come and gone and it was a boon to the box office numbers. Not only did Fast and Furious 6 reach the high end of predictions, as did Epic. On the other hand, The Hangover III struggled. The positives overrode the negatives by a large margin and the overall box office rose to $254.37 million, which is a new record for a three-day Memorial Day weekend. Adding in Monday, and the box office made $313.18 million. The three-day portion of the weekend rose 65% compared to last weekend and 67% compared to last year. This weekend earned more than $100 million more than the same weekend in 2012. That is something that usually only happens when there's a misalignment in holiday weekends. If you add in Monday, 2013's Memorial Day long weekend earned 63% more than the Memorial Day long weekend from 2012. Granted, 2013 is still far behind 2012, but this is great news. Hopefully it will keep up for a while. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Will Fast Be Fast Enough?\n\nMay 24th, 2013\n\nIt's the Memorial Day long weekend and there are three new films looking to take advantage of the holiday, plus a number of holdovers that will likely still bring in a lot of money. Fast and Furious 6 is leading the way in terms of box office potential and many think it will crack $100 million over four days; some think it will crack $100 million over three days. The Hangover III debuted on Thursday, which will give it a jump on the competition, but soften its weekend numbers. Finally, there's Epic, a family film that seems like a sure hit, except there is a lot of competition this weekend. Star Trek into Darkness, Iron Man 3, and The Great Gatsby are all still doing well and should provide some competition for the three new releases. All combined, those six films should make as much as the entire box office did last year and 2013 will start to close the gap with 2012. More...\n\n2013 Preview: May\n\nMay 1st, 2013"
