        "text": "Fast & Furious 11 is definitely not coming out in April 2025 as originally announced, and it won't be coming out at another point next year either.\n\nIn early May 2024, Tyrese Gibson revealed that filming was only going to start in early 2025, which made that release date seem unlikely. Director Louis Leterrier then confirmed the filming schedule, revealing the movie will be out in 2026 instead.\n\nOfficially, Universal hasn't confirmed the delay and announced a new release date, but it definitely won't speed into cinemas in April 2025 as filming hasn't even started.\n\nWe do at least know that preparation is under way as Vin Diesel confirmed he had started training for the movie in May 2024, and has also revealed some car returns for the next movie.\n\nIn January 2024, Jason Momoa – who's expected to return as villain Dante Reyes, given the huge cliffhanger of Fast X – revealed that he has yet to see a script for the new movie.\n\nDevelopment on the sequel would have been stalled by the Hollywood strikes in 2023, but with those resolved, things have started to move again on the new movie.\n\nAs far as we know, it won't be the next movie we see in the series as Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs is getting a solo movie before then.\n\nAfter his surprise return in Fast X's credit scene, Johnson announced that his standalone movie would act as \"a fresh, new chapter & set-up\" for Fast X Part 2. Again though, development on that movie was affected by the strikes, so we're still waiting for an update on that Hobbs movie.\n\nWhile we wait for further information on that spin-off, let's delve into what we can expect from Fast & Furious 11, aka Fast X Part 2.\n\nFast & Furious 11 will no longer be released on April 4, 2025 as originally announced and, as mentioned above, we're still waiting for a new release date as of August 2024.\n\nDevelopment is under way on the 11th movie with Fast X director Louis Leterrier returning. The new movie will be written by Christina Hodson and Oren Uziel.\n\nFast 11 is yet to start filming, and Leterrier confirmed that it will start filming \"early next year\", adding: \"It's coming out in 2026, which will be exactly to the day, 25 years since the first one came out.\"\n\nThe Fast and the Furious was released on June 22, 2001, so Fast X Part 2 could arrive in cinemas on June 22, 2026. We're waiting for official confirmation from Universal on the new release date though.\n\nAs for the Hobbs solo movie which, we imagine, has to come out before Fast X Part 2, we've heard nothing about it since its announcement in June 2023.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine that the spin-off could take the April 2025 release date, but filming would have to start soon. Watch this space for any further developments on the new movie.\n\nFast and Furious 11 cast: Who's coming back for Fast X Part 2?\n\nThe cast for Fast & Furious 11 has yet to be confirmed, but we can make some educated guesses based on the events of Fast X.\n\nVin Diesel will, of course, be back as Dominic Toretto even though the finale of Fast X saw him in a bit of a pickle at the bottom of a dam that's about to be blown up by Dante Reyes, but there's no way the series kills off Dom or his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry).\n\nThe fates of Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) are also up in the air after new Agency leader Aimes (Alan Ritchson) – who was working all along with Dante – fired a rocket at their plane, causing it to crash.\n\nIt's possible that one of them will be killed off, but don't be surprised if they're all back in the next movie.\n\nRitchson is hoping he'll be back, telling EW in May 2023: \"There have been a lot of conversations. I'm amped to play the bad guy and put the gas to the floor. Let's see him try and succeed at what he wants to do. You can decide if he's bad or not, but, yeah, I'm ready.\"\n\nMichelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron will also be back as Letty and Cipher, respectively, after the final scene saw them picked up in Antarctica by Gisele (Gal Gadot) who, yes, is somehow back from the dead. (How? Who knows.)\n\nGadot will be back as she seemed pretty happy with her unexpected return: \"Missed my Fast family! I'm overwhelmed with excitement.\"\n\nJason Statham will return as Deckard Shaw, assuming he manages to save his mother Queenie (Helen Mirren) from Dante's henchmen, while he might have a reunion with Hobbs after Dwayne Johnson's surprise return in the credit scene.\n\nIt's possible that Statham will also pop up in the solo Hobbs movie, but maybe the fact it's not being referred to as Hobbs & Shaw 2 suggests he's only going to appear in the 'main' timeline.\n\nThe major casualty of Fast X was John Cena's Jakob Toretto who sacrifices himself to help Dom save his son. Jakob's car blew up with him in it, but we didn't technically see a body, so in this series, you can never say never.\n\nTalking of the Toretto family, Jordana Brewster's Mia will be back and hopefully will have more to do this time around, while we might also see Daniela Melchior return as Isabel – who's revealed to be Elena's sister, which makes her the aunt of Dom's son.\n\nAlongside Jason Momoa's Dante and Alan Ritchson's Aimes, Brie Larson's Tess should also be another Fast X newcomer to return in the next movie. She was shot, but seemed fine and perhaps it'll draw her father, Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell) out of the shadows.\n\nThat already seems like a big enough cast for the next movie, but other returns could include Scott Eastwood's Little Nobody and Rita Moreno as Dom, Mia and Jakob's grandmother.\n\nIf Fast & Furious 11 is the end of the Fast Saga, then Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner will likely have a presence in the movie, although it's unclear exactly how – or if – they'll bring back Brian.\n\nFans have also speculated that we could see Devon Aoki reprise her role as Suki from 2 Fast 2 Furious after Diesel shared a reunion photo in July 2024.\n\nWalker's daughter Meadow makes a cameo in Fast X as a flight attendant who helps Jakob and Brian escape the Agency, so she could be back and revealed to have a bigger role in the Toretto family.\n\nFast and Furious 11 plot: What can we expect from Fast X Part 2?\n\nFast X is practically all set up for Fast & Furious 11 (and potentially beyond), so let's run through what's left hanging at the end.\n\nAs mentioned above, the fates of Dom and his son Brian, along with Roman, Tej, Ramsey and Han, are all up in the air. We're confident Dom and Brian will make it out of their predicament, but it's possible one (or more) of the other four might have perished.\n\nLetty and Cipher are stranded in Antarctica, but help has arrived in the form of the previously-dead Gisele who now seems to be going around in a submarine. (Not the one from Fast & Furious 8 as that was destroyed.)\n\nDeckard Shaw is off to go and save his mum from henchmen sent after Queenie by Dante because she's helped Dom in the past, while Hobbs is the latest target of Dante's wrath which sets up his solo movie.\n\nEven though Fast & Furious 11 hasn't been written yet, the events of Fast X were written with knowledge of where all this will end, so even though it doesn't feel conclusive, it will all come together.\n\n\"We needed to understand where we're ending in order to create the road to it,\" Leterrier told the Los Angeles Times in May 2023.\n\n\"So on top of everything that we had to do, we had to decide, 'This is where this franchise is going to end. It has to end this way.' Yes, yes, yes. Everybody agreed. Shook hands. And then we went back to work.\"\n\nAs to what that actual ending will be, we have no idea right now (although a BBQ will probably be involved somewhere), so your guess is as good as ours – but the speculation is part of the fun.\n\nEven though we know it's coming, Fast & Furious 11 hasn't started filming, so there's no footage to show you yet. With the likely release delay, we won't see anything until late 2025."
