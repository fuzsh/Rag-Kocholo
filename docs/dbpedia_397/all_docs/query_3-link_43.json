Netflix will start a connection test.\n\nWhen the test stops, click Show more info.\n\nNext to Client, note the country.\n\nIf the country doesn't match your location, it means your device or network has a VPN turned on. Try turning it off, then try Netflix again. For help turning a VPN off, contact your VPN provider.\n\nNetflix Customer Service can't help with turning a VPN off because the steps are different for each VPN app or service."
