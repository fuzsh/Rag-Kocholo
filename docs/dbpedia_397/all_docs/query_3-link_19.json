        "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I do indeed know that the Fast and Furious franchise is incredibly ridiculous. The stunts and actions performed would never be able to exist in real life, simply because of the presence of gravity and the fragility of the human body. (I’m looking at you, fight scene between the Rock and Jason Statham). The simple fact that none of the actors have ever gotten a speeding ticket is incredulous by itself. However, that said, the franchise is one of my favorites in Hollywood. The films were some of the first ones that my father and I watched together, serving as an extremely fun bonding experience. They are incredibly entertaining, from the wild and implausible plots to the enviable relationships that have been cultivated over the last two decades. While the films are not cinematic masterpieces, the acting is good enough to make you forget that the franchise exists in a fantastical world. The films even manage to sneak in comedy among the drama of action-packed car racing scenes. When I decide to watch one of the films, it is almost impossible to make a decision on which one to pick. Hence my decision to compile a definitive ranking of the Fast and Furious films.\n\nTo complete this list, I will be considering four aspects of the films: Cinematography, Acting, Plot, and Directing. I will give each category a score out of ten, and those with the highest score out of forty will be the best films. Again, as a disclaimer, I will be rating these films within the Fast and Furious universe; it would just be heartbreaking to compare a Fast and Furious movie to, say, Citizen Kane. It is my personal opinion that the franchise should not have continued without Paul Walker, as he was a pivotal character in the series (the films would literally have had no direction without him) and he added a lighthearted and slightly romantic sentiment to the franchise that is now absent. With that being said, I will be considering all of the Fast and Furious films that have been released since 2001, even my least favorite of the series, (*sigh*) Tokyo Drift. (Please remember that this is my personal opinion, this list is for fun, and that I have no animosity towards any of these films). Anyway, let’s kick off this list with the worst!\n\nCinematography → The cinematographer for this film decided to step it up a notch from the previous two films with the cinematography – but when I say a notch, I mean just one. The film takes place in a new country, and in an attempt to showcase it, the cinematographer chose some nice-ish long shots of the Tokyo skyline. All in all, still not a cinematographic masterpiece. Score: 6/10\n\nActing → As an avid supporter of the Fast and Furious franchise, I am the first to acknowledge that the acting is not high quality. Most of the actors have not been in other hit films, so they are their characters. However, trust me when I say, the acting on this film really falls flatter than usual. An aspect that really doesn’t help the subpar acting chops is the truly horrible script. It is one of the most boring and predictable scripts I have ever seen, with pieces of dialogue seemingly pulled off the internet. Score: 4/10\n\nPlot → I love to hate a film, but usually when the film is so bad that it’s good, like National Treasure. Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift is just plain bad. The plot doesn’t unravel fully until almost halfway through the film, and when it does you don’t even know it has; that’s how boring it is. I was initially turned off by the film because of the absences of all of the characters I have grown to love, such as Brian, Dom, Letty, Tej, and Roman, but kept getting further turned off just out of boredom. The film chooses to focus on the lives of high school students getting involved in the adult world of street (aka Drift) racing, so the movie reads as much more immature than the rest of the franchise. I kept watching the movie (mostly because I had to) so the plot isn’t complete garbage, but it could be immensely better. Score: 6/10\n\nDirecting → Honestly, I don’t even know what to say. I think my critiques above speak for themselves. I know the director didn’t write the movie, but he could have sped up the process to at least increase the hype of the plot. Because of the directors’ uninvolvement with the script, I’m not going to trash the score, as he was just working with what he was given. Score: 7/10\n\nTotal Score: 23/40\n\nCinematography → As our technology progresses with time, it creates more pressure for the Fast and Furious franchise to pull off crazier stunts with each film. Maybe the pressure became too much this time. There comes a certain point where computer generated shots just don’t cut it anymore. It was acceptable in Fate of the Furious, but Hobbs and Shaw took it too far this time. In my opinion, they don’t really count as cinematography. Score → 6/10\n\nActing → Alrighty, so this film includes two of my favorite British actresses ever, Vanessa Kirby (who you know from The Crown) and Helen Mirren (who you know from literally everything; The Queen and The Hundred-Foot Journey are some examples). They add a really nice touch to the film in terms of adding much-needed acting skills to the cast. It’s probably purposeful, but Hobbs and Shaw act so tough and take themselves so seriously that I laugh pretty much anytime they start talking. The acting is okay, but the cast has such good chemistry that it makes up for it. Jason Statham, Vanessa Kirby, Helen Mirren (and though absent, Luke Evans) are very funny as a family of criminals who still suffer from normal familial problems. I also can’t get enough of the constant bickering between Hobbs and Shaw. Score: 8/10\n\nPlot → To be honest, I’m not even sure how this fits in with the rest of the series, or if the Fast and Furious universe is branching out to include separate storylines with different time intervals. Since most of my favorite characters are not in this film, this is not at the top of my list. Yet, I managed to enjoy it nonetheless. There’s something about that F&F formula that just sticks (almost) every time. This film focuses on Hobbs and Shaw alone alongside Shaw’s sister Hattie, played by Vanessa Kirby, and his mother, played by Helen Mirren (who makes any film better) as they track down their new enemy, Brixton Lorr, aka “Black Superman” (Idris Elba). I did not come up with that nickname by the way; Lorr came up with it himself. With the absence of the core crew and the film just focusing on Hobbs and Shaw, there is a lot less car racing and a lot more world-saving. Now F&F has thrown some shit in our faces before, like not dying after driving off of a cliff or Dom literally defying gravity in Fast and Furious 6, yet Hobbs and Shaw literally takes it to a level that I didn’t know existed. In short, this film is too fantastical to be believable, but still entertaining. Score → 5/10\n\nDirecting → I liked the movie but there’s some serious fixing to be done. There were too many odds and ends that didn’t contribute to the plot in a meaningful way (i.e., some unnecessary characters and plot points) that derailed the pace of the movie. What else is new? Maybe I should just lower my expectations. Score: 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 25/40\n\nCinematography → Since the producers were unsure of the film’s future success, it appears that they didn’t pay too much attention to the cinematography. Instead, they were simply trying to make an enjoyable film, which is understandable, since there had never been a blockbuster hit about car racing in Hollywood. To break down the basics, the cinematographer has a good hold of his camera, and he utilizes accurate camera movements and angles to display the mood of the scene. The costumes are random and don’t symbolize much, but they, along with the background, contribute well to the overall setting (i.e., the car shop). Score: 6/10\n\nActing → It’s hard to know how far inside these actors had to reach in order to create their characters; sometimes I think that Vin Diesel is Dominic Toretto and he’s merely playing himself. Though, I suppose that translates to an actor’s dedication to his role. While watching, I don’t have a hard time believing the actors in their roles, but…. the characters aren’t exactly multifaceted. The supporting characters are pretty weak, but the core cast is acceptable. Score: 5/10\n\nPlot → The film opens with an action-packed scene guaranteed to pull viewers in, filled with car racing skills that you’ll wish you could pull off while driving through your neighborhood. (Unless you’re normal and don’t dream of crashing your car). The plot is not too complex and easy to follow, as the filmmakers used the formulaic three-act structure. However, it’s slow to develop, taking a little more than 30 minutes to arrive at the first plot point. The story itself is pretty simple and enjoyable and at the very least, when watching this film, I feel like I am absorbing what feels like accurate car rhetoric and information. By the end of the film, I guarantee that you will be attached to at least one of the many characters popping up throughout the movie. Score: 7/10\n\nDirecting → As mentioned above, the first scene is attention-grabbing, so at the very least, the director knows how to build attraction to the film. I can’t get the sense that the director is trying to communicate anything specific other than the hype that exists when you race cars for a living. Given the fairly simple story arc, the director does a good job in creating twists and jumps that will get you out of your seat. Since I can plop down and watch this movie without a problem or get excited when I see it on cable, I would say that the director did a great job in taking an underdeveloped set of characters and a flat story and creating a compelling movie worthy of an entire anthology. Score: 8/10\n\nTotal Score: 26/40\n\nCinematography → So it looks like nothing has changed. The farthest the cinematographer will go in creating cinematic art is shaking a hand-held camera around a little bit. Sometimes so much, you can’t even see what you’re looking at on screen. One thing that I haven’t mentioned thus far is costuming and object placement. Unfortunately, costumes are merely a meh, but I guess you can’t expect car racers to wear anything of note. (Vin Diesel could wear something other than an undershirt every once in a while though.) In terms of how the scenes are arranged, the cinematographer did a good job. The scenes are set well, with nothing out of place or out of the ordinary (*ahem* Starbucks cup in Game of Thrones). It is very believable that the actors are where they are. Score: 7/10\n\nActing → I don’t know if I can discuss this for six more movies. The acting is… you guessed it: flat! However, I really don’t know if this is due to a complete lack of talent or because the script writers were buzzed while writing. Seriously, the script is. so. bad. and. predictable! I can quote the movie, and trust me, I have not seen it enough to be able to do this. One new noteworthy aspect, just to rub in the bad acting, is that there is no emotion behind the delivery. Only the bare minimum to get the job done. I mean, in a scene where Mia is supposed to be angry at Brian, I was laughing the whole time! Is that normal? I don’t think so, which leads to… Score: 5/10\n\nPlot → I’ve been really critical of this movie so far, but one thing that does not disappoint is the PLOT! It is so much more engaging than the previous three movies, partly due to the reappearance of our lovable characters from the first film, and partly because technology makes everything better. For those who are confused, I will address Han’s brief presence, even though he died at the end of Tokyo Drift. Spoiler alert: the movies go out of order (confusing right? I’m getting MCU vibes). ANYWAY… we see the return of Letty (finally!) though only for a brief 20 minutes. However, her character has been turned up to the extreme, which is fantastic, because we all love Letty. The plot develops and thickens at all the right moments and it follows a good three act structure, with an opening, two big problems/plot points and a smooth ending. Everything in this movie is just better, especially the music. You could say the movie is Faster and More Furious. Score: 9/10\n\nDirecting → Unfortunately, in terms of directing, the only uniqueness I can see in this director when compared to the others is an increase in car chase scenes and violence (better get used to it). It adds to the entertainment value of the film, which could be good in boosting sales, but doesn’t add any artistic elements. However, it does show that the director had a vision and end goal in mind. I can just picture him in front of a camera with money signs in his eyes. Finally, to consider the execution, seeing as millions of people are entertained by this movie in spite of the script being complete trash, the director worked with his available materials and created something worth watching (i.e. he executed the film to its potential). I guess I just have to accept the fact that the Fast and Furious franchise will never produce cinematic masterpieces. Score: 8/10\n\nFinal Score: 29/40\n\nCinematography → Similar to the first Fast and Furious installment, the second film does not place a heavy emphasis on making a beautifully crafted film. The only shots you’ll see besides the ever-present close-ups and mids are distortions, to emphasize the extreme speeds at which they drive. Due to this, I’ll give the same score. Score: 6/10\n\nActing → In this film, we see the addition of two new characters who, though we don’t know it yet, will become extremely important later on in the series. One of the new characters has a past with our favorite from the last film, Brian O’Conner, paving the way for the development of a complex relationship, which thus gives the opportunity for great acting to occur. Don’t get your hopes up though, because both of them are pretty flat actors. However, they each possess qualities that enhance the plot. Paul Walker, who plays Brian, is extremely charismatic which covers up for his non-multidimensional acting. Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman, is one of the funniest actors to grace the Fast and Furious screen. Together, they have excellent chemistry, and succeed in portraying the relationship of two troublemakers who grew up together. Their chemistry almost makes up for the lack of the other key characters from the last film. With the addition of Roman, a childhood friend, Brian has a lot of room for development, which Paul Walker takes in stride. Finally, even though the acting is not that bad, the characters are not explored enough, which ultimately traces back to a problem with the writers and not the actors. Score: 6.5/10\n\nPlot → You can tell soon enough that the writers have found a formula to draw viewers in quickly, as this movie opens with a car racing scene, just like the last film. It is a pretty weak ploy to get our attention, but it works. As mentioned above, we see the addition of many new characters in 2 Fast 2 Furious, two of which will become extremely popular and important. The plot is introduced much quicker than last time, thankfully, and this time it is much more entertaining. It revolves around Brian and his childhood friend Roman, as they attempt to infiltrate a drug and money-laundering business. Brian and Roman are employed by the Miami PD to drive the ringleader’s money into Mexico, where the police will “take down” this drug dealer. Parts of it are slightly implausible, i.e., a multi-time felon getting his entire rap sheet wiped in exchange for driving, which he does on a daily basis, or a CI getting in way deeper than would ever be allowed by law enforcement. Despite the implausibility, I am smiling throughout the entire film, mostly due to the excellent comedic timing between Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson. Score: 8.5/10\n\nDirecting → There’s not much to say about the directing of this film, other than the fact that it was much more well thought out than the first film. The director worked with a simple story and took it in every direction it needed to go, making it an entertaining film. You can tell within the first 30 minutes where the film is headed, which suggests the efficient planning of the director. Score: 8.5/10\n\nFinal Score: 29.5/40\n\nCinematography → Similar to Furious 7, this film takes us around the world, providing for more opportunities for good cinematography. The film opens in Havana, Cuba, and (brb just buying a plane ticket to Havana) quickly takes us through a whirlwind of cities including New York City, Berlin, Atlanta, and finally, Myvatn, Iceland (which is meant to be Vladovin, Russia in the film). One of the best coordinated and filmed scenes is the prison break scene. The scene focuses on Hobbs and Shaw fighting their way through a prison with a lot of background choreography. I can only imagine how long it took to get through that scene perfectly. Though some of the shots are computer generated because they would endanger the actors, based on the fact that I now want to go to all of these cities, I can assume that the cinematographer did his job in creating attractive enough shots to increase tourism. (JK, the cinematography was amazing – the best it's ever been). Score: 8.5/10\n\nActing → I had just made up my mind that the acting of this franchise was never going to improve when I sat down to watch F8. However, I was pleasantly surprised this time around. This specific plot reverses the role of certain relationships in the franchise, makes room for new relationships, and forces the actors to consider their characters’ personalities in completely different positions. These challenges are tackled by each and every actor, and viewers get to see them grow throughout the film. This film introduces a new character played by the incredible actress Charlize Theron, who succeeds in adding depth to the film. With a surprisingly tearful scene performed by Vin Diesel (seriously, who knew he had emotions?), I can safely say that the acting has gotten better. Score: 8/10\n\nPlot → It turns out that there’s a car-racing environment in every country of the world? I should try to find the Philadelphia underground racing community. Ok, so while this film is entertaining, I will restate my opinion that the F&F films should not have continued without Paul Walker. The series would literally not exist without him or his character (I’d like to see someone else try to embody Brian the way he does). Thus, regardless of what happens in the film, I must dock it several points automatically. However, I will still discuss the plot, as I have several key questions to raise. In F8, we unexpectedly see Dom turn his back on his family and work with a cyber-terrorist, Cipher (Charlize Theron), who is haunting as a villian (she has the perfect shade of blue eyes for the role). The film follows the rest of the team–including Deckard Shaw?–as they try to find out what has gotten into Dom’s bald head. My questions are all about the plausibility of the script, which is bad as usual, but before I start, I have to make a point about the number of times Dom says “I’ve got family” throughout the franchise. It gets a little ridiculous and repetitive by this movie.\n\nRerouting back to my main points: First of all, I’d really like to know who Mr. Nobody is and where he gets this ridiculous amount of authority. Seriously, like above the head of the CIA-level authority. He just goes around interfering in the criminal justice system telling criminals that they won’t be criminals anymore if they work for him. It seems that that would break a few laws, no? Second, where do they get these endless amounts of cars? Never-ending. Third, am I really supposed to believe that a fight between the Rock (a professional wrestler) and Jason Statham (a former professional diver) would be even and fair? I don’t think so. However, watching the two act together is fun, as both the actors and characters seem to enjoy antagonizing each other. Score: 6.5/10\n\nDirecting → Known for creating action-packed films, F8’s director, F. Gary Gray, succeeds again in creating a blockbuster hit. In previous Fast and Furious movies, the plots have lacked the key element of anxiety that action films are required to have. Gray turns this around and is extremely successful in creating a suspenseful story that slowly unfolds (but not too slowly) over the course of the film. Score: 7/10\n\nFinal Score: 30/40\n\nCinematography → Unlike the last film, Hobbs and Shaw, upon research, I found that F9 used as little CGI as possible. In an extremely intense 4-second scene in which a car crashes through a building and into a moving truck, instead of taking the easy route and using CGI, the film crew decided to take 8 months to plan out the scene with real cars. Impressive, right? I was really surprised. With more limited uses of CGI, the film had lots of opportunities to create incredible action sequences with great cinematography. I’m happy to say that they did not disappoint. It’s a different type of cinematography, however. It’s not beautiful, like 1917 or Dune, but it’s still an impressive feat that the film crew pulled off, earning them the highest score on cinematography so far. Score: 9/10\n\nActing → Due to the complexity of the plot and the intensity of the stunts, I doubt that the actors were focused on their acting skills. By this point in time, I can imagine them thinking, “Alright, time to suit up again. Let’s have some fun.” That’s exactly what it looks like these actors are doing: having fun. And that’s good for them. They’re having fun playing the characters they love while making boatloads of money. The happiness and ease with which they play their characters comes across on screen, which results in mixed reviews in terms of acting. On the one hand, you don’t want an actor to look like they're struggling to play their character, but you also don’t want to look at an actor putting in little to no effort whatsoever. Fortunately, the filmmakers’ twisting plot directs your attention away from the limited acting skills shown on screen. Score: 7/10\n\nPlot → The first scene is… you guessed it! A car racing scene. It’s a different vibe however. Instead of the usual carjacking and robbery that takes place, this opening scene is actually LEGAL car racing! Who would have thought that was possible in Fast and Furious? The scene moves back in time, showing a young Dom and his father, Jack, as Jack is in the middle of a racing tournament. It is now that we finally experience what created Dom’s stoic personality forever: his father’s death, which actually made me tear up a little. A very strange change of pace for F&F, which usually does nothing except make me smile. A quick detour to note that the actor who plays the young Dom has the voice DOWN.\n\nIn this movie, we also see the return of our most hated antagonist, Cipher, whose new haircut is NOT working for her, by the way. She was just caught by Mr. Nobody (yay!) but was broken out of imprisonment by a stranger (to us) named Jacob. Unfortunately, Mr. Nobody is nowhere to be found, which is a little disappointing. I always thought he was untouchable. The reason for those previous parentheses? Jacob is no stranger to Dom. He is Dom and Mia’s secret brother?!?!? What? The Toretto family tree keeps expanding! There is one more plot twist guaranteed to make you drop your popcorn bucket in a comic fashion: Han is secretly alive! Don’t get too excited, because Gisele is unfortunately still dead.\n\nThe rest of the film follows the usual crew as they chase Jacob around the globe trying to stop him from building an extremely dangerous device that could end the world (what is up with the F&F writers and terrorism?). Now that I’ve spoiled the two major plot points for you, the complexity of this film needs to be addressed. The addition of emotional backstory is nice, but at some points I wonder if all of these different plot points were necessary. They even bring back Sean and Twinkie, our protagonists from Tokyo Drift, for a short period of time. Not sure if that was necessary, but it was nonetheless fun. One of my favorite scenes is a conversation between Roman, Tej, and Ramsey, as they almost break the fourth wall when discussing the impossible feat they have achieved of still being alive without a single scratch. It made me laugh that they were addressing the implausibility of the F&F franchise that is constantly discussed amongst fans.\n\nAs always, the film was enjoyable, but there was a little too much going on for my taste. My main critique concerns the fact that the writers are still pretending that Brian is alive but is just taking a break from the crime/saving the world business. I find it a little insulting to Paul Walker’s memory that they are pretending that he’s just off camera for a little while. Score: 6/10\n\nDirecting → The directing style is not much different than the other F&F films. As long as the director is able to produce an enjoyable film with lots of action sequences (that usually break the laws of physics) with Dom and his team taking down the bad guys, it’s considered a success. Overall, the director does all of these things while interweaving old storylines from past films into the current plot. (But that speaks more for the writing rather than directing, don’t you think?) Anyway, it was a fun film, which is the most we can hope for. Score: 7/10\n\nFinal Score: 31/40\n\nCinematography → Well it looks as if the past cinematographers were tired of me ripping up their work and this one decided to level up. Within the first three minutes I could tell that there was much more thought and dedication behind the cinematography. With very smooth camera movements showcasing the Christ the Redeemer statue and the surrounding villages in Rio, the film is much more enjoyable to look at. With the brand-new backdrop of Brazil, there are many new sights to shoot and sets to develop. Despite some pretty obvious green screens, this film ups the game for future Fast and Furious films. Score: 7.5/10\n\nActing → While the acting skills of the individual actors haven’t improved much, the relationships between characters have been developed much more. The actors have also had much more time to spend together, which comes across in the film. Everyone has great chemistry which makes up for the basic acting. Additionally, by the fifth movie, everyone has really sunk into their roles and become their characters, which allows viewers to stop doubting the acting. Score: 8/10\n\nPlot → Ok, so this plot is even better than the last film. Remember when I told you that Tej and Roman (from 2 Fast 2 Furious) would be back? Well they’re back–the best comedic duo ever–along with other supporting characters from past F&F films to create the ultimate criminal gang. Together, they team up to rob the richest man in Rio … which I would like to see happen in real life. We then see the introduction of Luke Hobbs, a FBI agent chasing Brian and Dom, played by none other than Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who becomes a permanent presence in the F&F saga. That’s right, and he’s basically playing himself. A no-nonsense, cynical big guy out to get criminals while dissing them in the process. Parts of it are unbelievable, like the fact that the richest person in Rio would place his entire wealth into one location, in a police station. (I mean, really? That’s the best place you could think of?) There’s also the fact that none of them have ever stopped for gas or been fined for the incredible damages they create throughout the film. But while some parts are not believable, that’s what creates a good Fast and Furious film. This is definitely one of my favorites Score: 9/10\n\nDirecting → The most I can say is that the director was given a script about people robbing a police station and created a great action-comedy. Unlike the earlier films, this director succeeds in creating suspense and showing intense scenes without just shaking the camera around, so overall good directing. Score: 7.5/10\n\nFinal Score: 32/40\n\nCinematography → Ignoring the implausibility of what goes on inside the frame of the film, this cinematography is probably some of the best yet. All of the characters, their props, and the costuming are well thought out and carefully placed on set. The camera shots and angles all do their jobs to communicate the mood of the scene, whether it’s an intense fight scene, or a long-shot introducing the setting. You might be thinking, this sounds pretty basic, which it is. Completing this list would be easy for Chloé Zhao, but within the Fast and Furious universe, checking all of these boxes is top notch cinematography. Score: 8/10\n\nActing → The acting throughout this series has stayed pretty much the same. The actors and actresses are pretty much playing versions of themselves, which… makes it all the more believable. (I’m trying to give them a break here). The backgrounds on some of these characters don’t make sense given how they behave now but it’s easy to ignore due to the incredible chemistry that the cast has built with each other. It’s obvious that they are close friends off set due to the ease with which they interact on camera. Some special shout-outs go to Roman and Tej, Roman and Hobbs, and Roman and Brian. See a pattern emerging? My favorite character is clearly Roman Pierce. Anyway, as much as I enjoy watching everyone on camera, it is impossible to ignore the horrible acting of Vin Diesel. There is no fluctuation in his voice when he speaks (I get it, he’s a tough guy) but literally nothing about him changes throughout the movie. Also, his lines are so simplistic, though maybe that’s the writers room cutting him some slack. I’m going to have to say that as the movie series progresses, Vin Diesel becomes more stoic and less of an actor. Score: 7/10\n\nPlot → This is probably my favorite F&F movie of all time, because everyone I know and love is back together! Though Letty is technically working for the enemy’s side, she’s finally back in action. Otherwise, we’ve got the whole crew: Dom, Brian, Mia, Tej, Roman, Han, Gisele, and Hobbs. We also get a new villain, Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans. With the best opening sequence I have ever seen–a recap of the franchise’s best moments–the movie follows the crew as the work with the FBI (Hobbs) to take down Owen Shaw and his crew (including Letty) because they’re creating some domestic terrorist device (they never really explain it). There are incredible fight sequences, car chases, and plenty of interactions between characters that we never knew we needed. There’s even a twist that you’ll never see coming (but… it’s also pretty obvious). I know that the movie’s technically impossible (at one point Dom literally defies gravity), but like I said, I’m judging within the F&F universe, so plausibility generally just goes out the window. Anyway, in conclusion, one of my favorite plots ever leads to… Score: 10/10\n\nDirecting → I think my love and praise speaks for itself. This director created one of the most incredibly enjoyable F&F movies ever. Score: 9/10\n\nFinal Score: 34/40\n\nCinematography → So, I said that the sixth film had the best cinematography, BUT that was before I rewatched Furious 7. The cinematography is even better, with excellent scenes shot with a hand-held camera, and some shots that, though they couldn’t occur in real life, are breathtaking. The cinematographer made incredible decisions that ultimately paid off in transforming a franchise that once never cared about cinematography to one that is beautiful to look at (sometimes). Score: 8/10\n\nActing → I love everyone in this movie and the way they play their characters. I could not imagine any other person trying to take on the comedic genius that is Roman Pierce. Nor could I imagine anyone else antagonizing him the way that Ludacris does. (I know I talk about their relationship a lot). By this point in time, these actors are irreplaceable. Vin Diesel’s acting never gets better, but that’s okay. I’ve accepted it by this point. Besides, everyone else makes up for it. Score: 8/10\n\nPlot → Besides Fast Five, this is the film that I have probably seen the most. I could probably quote half of the script, especially Vin Diesel’s part. The reason I love this film so much is because of the plot, as usual. Not much else changes film to film, but as time passes and technology progresses, the plots get better (and more unrealistic). We lose two of our key characters at the end of the sixth film and the beginning of this film, so Furious 7 starts on a sour note. On the upside, everyone else has gathered again to take down Owen Shaw’s older brother, Deckard (Jason Statham), who is hell-bent on revenge for Dom throwing Owen out of a plane.\n\nWhile trying to get rid of this pest, the team is also focusing on rescuing a hacker by the name of Ramsey, who created some device worthy of war and terorism. The film deals with two separate storylines, but still manages to take you around the world and show the landscapes of Los Angeles, London, Abu Dhabi, and Monte Christi. You’d think that by this point we’d have a full cast, but nope! The producers added another two cast members who stay on in future films. Fortunately, they bring charisma and enjoyment to the screen.\n\nThe car and fight scenes are never ending and there is no shortage of Hobbs’s biting one-liners or brotherly fights between Roman and Tej. Similar to most other F&F films, what seems to be the ending is just the first part. The real ending of this film couldn’t have been a more beautiful send-off to Paul Walker with a montage of his most memorable lines with Wiz Khalifa’s “See You Again” playing in the background. Confession: I always cry at the end. Score: 10/10\n\nDirecting → Who would’ve thought that Fast and Furious could handle more than one storyline? Every film has had a consistent three-act plot carried out scientifically. This time, the director and writers successfully interwove two separate storylines that met in all the right places. The interactions between the plots were perfect and viewers get a teeth-clenching ending (ending part 1) when the plots finally hash it out. Score: 10/10\n\nFinal Score: 36/40"
