The seventh feature film in the The Fast and the Furious franchise, Furious 7 was given limited release March 26, 2015 at the interactive film and music festival, South by Southwest and internationally April 3, 2015.\n\nOfficial Description\n\n“ Continuing the global exploits in the unstoppable franchise built on speed, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead the returning cast of Furious 7. James Wan directs this chapter of the hugely successful series that also welcomes back favorites Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Elsa Pataky and Lucas Black. They are joined by international action stars new to the franchise including Jason Statham, Djimon Hounsou, Tony Jaa, Ronda Rousey, Nathalie Emmanuel and Kurt Russell. Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel and Michael Fottrell return to produce the film written by Chris Morgan. ”\n\n— Official Description\n\nPlot\n\nIn a London hospital, Deckard Shaw visits his brother, Owen (Luke Evans), who is recovering from his encounter with Dominic Toretto and his crew. Reminiscing about their youth, Deckard promises his brother to set things right. He threatens the doctoral staff with harm if anything goes wrong with his brother. He leaves the hospital in ruin, with a trail of dead soldiers in his wake, having already ruined it breaking in.\n\nIn the Californian desert, Dominic is attempting to wake the memories of an amnesiac Letty Ortiz by taking her to Race Wars 2014, their \"invention\". When she wins a race against an inexperienced racer, she recalls a series of her fragmented memories. She punches Hector (the Race Wars organizer and a friend of Dom and Letty) and leaves.\n\nWhen Dominic finds her, she is standing at her grave. She laments the fact that she cannot remember the last fifteen years of her life. She tells Dom that the way he looks at her bothers her and she cannot remember him nor properly reciprocate his feelings. When Dominic attempts to destroy the tombstone on her empty grave, she stops him and tells him that she has to leave him to find herself.\n\nElsewhere, Brian O'Conner is adjusting to the \"slow\" routines, driving a minivan to bring his son Jack to school.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Luke Hobbs is working at the DSS office after a workout. Although he misses the exciting past, he tries to hide this from Elena Neves. She replies that he's not a good liar. After giving Elena a recommendation, Hobbs returns to his office to find that Deckard has broken into his office and is hacking his computer. Hobbs attempts to stop Deckard from escaping, but he reveals his true purpose, and the two engage in a fight in the office until Elena returns to the office to help Hobbs. Deckard uses Elena’s arrival to his advantage and throws an explosive that forces Hobbs to abandon his pursuit and escape the building. The explosive detonates as he grabs Elena and knocks them out of the building's window, causing them to land on Elena's car. Hobbs is injured in the process of saving Elena and Deckard retrieves information on Han Seoul-Oh and Dominic Toretto's crew.\n\nTraveling to Tokyo, Japan, Deckard is able to track Han down during his bid to escape from Takashi and runs his car off the road with his own. Back in Los Angeles, Brian and Mia Toretto are preparing to take Jack out when Mia announces that Dominic has a package from Tokyo. Dominic and Mia discuss Brian’s difficulties with adjusting a life without “bullets” and Mia shares her fears about being unable to fulfill the kind the life Brian wants. Dominic reassures his sister that Brian merely needs time to fully transition, but she asks him \"How does nine months sound?\" and reveals that she is pregnant again. After convincing Mia to tell Brian, Dom receives a call from Deckard Shaw in Tokyo. The older Shaw sibling announces his presence to the family. Dominic realizes, too late, the package is from Deckard and is barely able to get himself and Mia out of the way before package detonates and destroys their home.\n\nDominic visits an injured Hobbs in the hospital after Elena contacts him on the DSS agent’s request. He meets briefly, Hobbs' daughter, Samantha. When she meets him, she tells Dom about his and her father's last encounter. She is then escorted from the hospital room by Elena and is watching over her in Hobbs’ stead. Hobbs explains Deckard's relation to Owen Shaw and history: he started off as an off-the-books Black Ops agent, but six years ago, the British government believed that he knew too much and had gone from a \"unique asset\" to a liability. Subsequently, 20 agents made a failed attempt on Shaw's life and he has been a \"ghost\" since then. Officially, Hobbs dissuades Dominic from going after him. Unofficially, Hobbs merely asks that Dominic doesn’t miss when he gets the chance to kill him. Meanwhile, after retreating to Mando's mansion in the Dominican Republic, Brian promises Mia that they won't battle any other enemies after defeating Shaw.\n\nTraveling to Tokyo, Dominic gets the chance to speak with Han's friend, Sean Boswell (Tokyo’s latest Drift King following the defeat of Takashi), whom he races against. Following their race, Sean gives Dominic what remained of Han’s belongings that were saved from the crash, including Dom's cross necklace and a photo of Gisele. Dominic later leaves with Han's remains and buries him in Los Angeles with the promise to see that he is avenged. At the funeral, Tej Parker and Roman Pearce speak with Brian on who could be hunting them and the refusal to attend the funerals of any more friends. Brian promises the only funeral left to attend will be Deckard’s.\n\nDominic realizes that the former operative is watching them and chases Deckard through Los Angeles into the tunnel where the two stare each other down. In a game of chicken, they charge each other’s vehicles and crash into each other. Dominic is prepared to fight Deckard, but the elder Shaw makes it a point to shoot him where he stands when the arrival of a Covert Ops team forces him to run. Dominic attacks the men when they threaten him, but the man in charge tries to get him to see reason and states that he was referred to Dominic by Hobbs. The only name he provides Dominic is “Mr. Nobody” and asks that he hear his proposal out.\n\nMr. Nobody takes Dominic to his secluded headquarters in El Segundo, California, where they exchange beer and he explains his proposition to Dominic. If he helps him save a hacker named Ramsey from a terrorist named Mose Jakande and retrieves a hacking program named the “God’s Eye”, he’ll allow Dominic to use it to find Deckard Shaw. Mr. Nobody calls Shaw a \"shadow\" who is very good at killing some without being seen by others, and can only be found by God's Eye. Dominic agrees to the terms if Mr. Nobody allows him to do things his way and with his own crew. Mr. Nobody obliges his request and reveals that he had Dominic’s crew rounded up and brought to his headquarters beforehand.\n\nDominic and the others devise a plan to attack Jakande’s convoy from the air as they arrive in the Caucasus Mountains. Roman demands that they hit the convoy from the most secure spot on the mountain, despite it being very hard to access, believing it's the spot the convoy doesn't expect the crew to hit them from. The crew is able to save Ramsey from her imprisonment, but not before encountering Deckard, who attempts to derail their rescue attempt. Dominic is cornered by Jakande’s secondary convoy and is forced to drive off of a cliff in order to save himself and Ramsey from the terrorist. The reinforced Dodge Charger R/T he uses saves them both from a certain death. Meanwhile, Brian gets trapped in the convoy by Jakande's henchman, Kiet, forcing him to escape via an emergency door as the vehicle slides off another cliff, but Letty saves him in the nick of time.\n\nWhen Ramsey regains consciousness, she willingly divulges the location of the God’s Eye to the crew because she feels she has found out enough about them to trust them. They travel to Abu Dhabi and meet up with Ramsey’s friend, Safar, who explains he sold the God Eye (unwittingly) to a rich Prince who is holding a major party in one of the Etihad Towers. The crew infiltrates the party, and despite major complications --- their cover being blown by Kara, the toughest of the Prince’s bodyguards, and the unexpected arrival of Deckard Shaw --- they are able to retrieve the God’s Eye (a compact USB drive) from the Lykan HyperSport. Toretto and Brian use the HyperSport to get out by driving through the windows of the Etihad Towers, one tower to the next.\n\nWith the God’s Eye secure, Dominic, Mr. Nobody, Brian and Ramsey use it to hunt Deckard down to an abandoned factory where they find him eating. Deckard expresses disappointment in the number of men who’ve come for him, and reveals he’s joined forces with Jakande, who is looking to reclaim the God’s Eye. Deckard’s unexpected ambush results in the death of Mr. Nobody’s right hand man, Sheppard and the loss of the God’s Eye.\n\nDominic and Brian carry an injured Mr. Nobody out of the factory and escape. Mr. Nobody demands that they pull over and leave him on the side of the road where his emergency team will collect him for medical attention. The two leave Mr. Nobody behind and return to the others.\n\nThe crew decide to return to Los Angeles to face Deckard and Jakande on the streets they know better than any other streets, which will reduce Jakande's advantage over them. Tej devises a dangerous plan that allows them to get near enough to the God’s Eye to hack and regain control of it. Brian calls Mia, telling her to take Jack and move on if she doesn't hear from him in 24 hours, but she reveals her pregnancy and orders him to survive and come back to her.\n\nThe crew ushers Ramsey between vehicles whenever they are attacked by an unmanned Drone that Jakande is using to attack them. The drone chase ended up alerting the police, but Brian, Roman and Tej are able to avoid them due to the drone attacking them. Realizing that they’re being hacked, Jakande destroys the radio tower that allows Ramsey to connect to her device, pausing the hack. After his car is destroyed, Brian heads off on foot to a satellite tower to reconnect Ramsey by hand and finish the job, with Kiet in pursuit to stop him. Brian faces off with Kiet in the building with closet available tower connection and is only barely able to defeat him, using a revenge allusion to the result of their previous encounter. Also learning that Ramsey is still with the crew, Tej and Roman's car is destroyed but they bail out. He reconnects Ramsey to the God’s Eye and she is able to take control.\n\nAt a parking garage elsewhere, Dominic goes head-to-head with Shaw in a traditional “street fight” with wrenches, after using his Dodge Charger to destroy Shaw's Aston Martin. Hobbs is still in the hospital and after having witnessed the destruction of the tower he leaves the hospital with the intention of helping Toretto and his crew. Hobbs drives and ambulance arrives in time to save Letty and Ramsey, in the final car able to help Ramsey complete her hack into her device, from the drone before it can kill them. Hobbs then shoots the drone and takes the gun to help fight with the crew. Dominic is able to defeat Deckard, remarking \"The thing about street fights? The street always wins,\" in time to save Hobbs, Ramsey and Letty from Jakande who tries to kill them with the helicopter turret.\n\nDominic drives his charger off of parking lot building, but appears to miss the helicopter and crashes. However, Jakande realizes that there are a belt of grenades hanging on the underbelly of the helicopter. He can't do nothing as Hobbs uses his gun to detonate the grenades and kills him. Hobbs and Brian pull Dominic from the ruined vehicle and Brian performs CPR on Dominic in hopes to resuscitate him. A tearful Letty demands he stops, and tries to get Dominic to come around by speaking to him. She reveals that she got her memory back and“remembered everything”, including their marriage. Dominic regains consciousness and she asks why he never told her they were married. Dominic tells her, “You can’t tell someone they love you”.\n\nIn the aftermath, Shaw, having survived the collapse of the parking lot garage, is escorted to a maximum security CIA prison by Hobbs, who tells Deckard that he’ll be waiting for him on the other side should he eventually manage to escape as promised.\n\nElsewhere, Dominic and the rest of the crew, including Ramsey, are relaxing on a beach in the Dominican Republic. Brian appears to have finally become settled in his domestic life with Mia and role as a father to Jack. His friends watch the happy family together as Dominic prepares to leave. Ramsey asks if he intends on saying goodbye, but Dominic believes “it’s never goodbye” and departs from the rest of the group.\n\nOn the road, Brian manages to catch up with Dominic at a crossroads and inquires where he intended on going without “saying goodbye” to him. As Dom flashes back through the crew's past, he reminds Brian that they both live their lives \"a quarter-mile at a time\" and they will always be best friends, no matter how far away he is. The two drive together down the road until their roads split off in different directions. As the screen fades to white, a dedication to Paul Walker with a final title card that reads \"For Paul\" appears.\n\nCast\n\nPrincipal Cast\n\nVin Diesel as Dominic Toretto\n\nPaul Walker as Brian O'Conner[note 1][8]\n\nMichelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz\n\nTyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce\n\nChris Bridges as Tej Parker\n\nJason Statham as Deckard Shaw\n\nNathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey\n\nDwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs\n\nJordana Brewster as Mia Toretto\n\nSupporting Cast\n\nKurt Russell as \"Mr. Nobody\"\n\nDjimon Hounsou as Mose Jakande\n\nElsa Pataky as Elena Neves\n\nTony Jaa as Kiet\n\nRonda Rousey as Kara\n\nAli Fazal as Safar\n\nJohn Brotherton as Sheppard\n\nRomeo Santos as Mando\n\nEden Estrella as Samantha Hobbs\n\nCharlie and Miller Kimsey[9] as Jack\n\nJJ Phillips as Abu Dhabi Billionaire\n\nFaheem Najm as DJ T Pain\n\nBritney Alger as Jasmine\n\nCameos\n\nLucas Black as Sean Boswell[10]\n\nNoel Gugliemi as Hector\n\nLuke Evans as Owen Shaw\n\nIggy Azalea as Head of Monster Truck Crew (cameo)\n\nSung Kang as Han Seoul-Oh (archive footage)\n\nGal Gadot as Gisele Yashar (archive footage/deleted scene)\n\nUncredited Appearances\n\nLaz Alonso as Fenix Calderon (archive footage)\n\nNathalie Kelley as Neela (archive footage)\n\nShad Moss[note 2] as Twinkie (archive footage)\n\nTego Calderon as Tego Leo (archive footage)\n\nDevon Aoki as Suki (archive footage)\n\nMichael Ealy as Slap Jack (archive footage)\n\nAmaury Nolasco as Orange Julius (archive footage)\n\nDon Omar as Rico Santos (archive footage)\n\nEvents\n\nRace Wars 2014\n\nDestruction of 1327\n\nAttack on Han Seoul-Oh\n\nRescue of Ramsey\n\nRetrieval of God's Eye in Abu Dhabi\n\nConflict against Mose Jakande\n\nFeatured Vehicles\n\nThe following list of major vehicles used in \"Furious 7\" is incomplete and may not be completed until a proper home video version of the film is released.\n\nThree hundred and forty cars were used during the production of the film. Two hundred and thirty cars, including several black Mercedes-Benz, Ford Crown Victoria and a single Mitsubishi Montero, were destroyed.[11] Forty vehicles were damaged during the filming of the \"Mountain Hijack\" sequence shot on location at Colorado's Monarch Pass.[11][12]\n\nSurprisingly, only ten percent of the action sequences in Furious 7 were created using computer generated graphics, the majority of CGI being used to create backgrounds and hide production details such as wires and other structures used.[13]\n\n3,500 man-days was the length in time it took to complete the stunts of the film.[13] Stunt drivers under Joel Kramer's supervision were not allowed to go above fifty miles per hour for safety reasons.[14]\n\nName Model Year Driver Status Aston Martin DB9 Unknown Deckard Shaw Destroyed\n\n2008 Audi R8 4.2 FSI quattro [Typ 42]\n\n2008 Race Wars participant Active 2011 Bugatti Veyron 2011 Roman Pearce Active 1967 Chevrolet Camaro 1967 Roman Pearce Damaged 2010 Chevrolet Suburban 2010 Tej Parker Active 2011 Chrysler Town & Country 2011 Brian O'Conner Damaged 2011 Dodge Challenger SRT-8 2011 Letty Ortiz Active 1968 Dodge Charger 1968 Dominic Toretto Active 2015 Dodge Charger LD 2015 Dominic Toretto Active 1970 Dodge Charger R/T 1970 Dominic Toretto Destroyed 1970 Dodge Charger R/T 1970 Dominic Toretto Damaged Dodge Viper SRT-10 Unknown Letty Ortiz Active 1969 Ford Torino Talladega 1969 Dominic Toretto Active International 4000-Series Unknown Luke Hobbs Damaged Jeep Wrangler Unlimited JK Unknown Tej Parker Active 1984 Kässbohrer Setra S 215 HDH Transcontinental 1984 Mose Jakande's convoy Destroyed 2014 Maserati Ghibli 2014 Deckard Shaw Damaged 1997 Mazda RX-7[note 3] Unknown Han Seoul-Oh Destroyed 2013 McLaren 12C Spider 2013 Brian O'Conner Active 1992 Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse 1992 Deckard Shaw Damaged Nissan GT-R R35 Unknown Brian O'Conner Destroyed 1972 Plymouth Barracuda 1972 Letty Ortiz Damaged 1987 Chevrolet Caprice Custom 1987 Tej Parker Destroyed 1970 Plymouth Road Runner 1970 Dominic Toretto Damaged 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STi GH 2011 Brian O'Conner Damaged 1995 Toyota Supra Mk.IV JZA80 1995 Brian O'Conner Active 2013 W Motors Lykan Hypersport 2013 Dominic Toretto Destroyed\n\nFeatured Locations\n\nLos Angeles\n\n1327\n\nRace Wars\n\nTokyo\n\nCar Park (Tokyo)\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nCaucasus Mountains\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nEtihad Towers\n\nDominican Republic\n\nAgency Headquarters\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe Los Angeles Time reported Universal Pictures considered splitting Fast & Furious 6 into films, titled “Furious 6” (the subtitle in the final production of the film remains despite alteration) and “Fast Seven”, with a single a story running through both films written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin.[15] On December 20, 2011, Diesel stated that Furious Six would be split into two parts, with writing for the two films occurring simultaneously. On the decision, Diesel said, “We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out, it just went beyond 110 pages ... The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'[16]\n\nIn February of 2012, Dwayne Johnson stated that it was no longer the studio’s intention to produce two films on account of weather-related complications and the production of “Furious 7” would begin after the completion of Fast & Furious 6.[17]\n\nApril 2013, director Justin Lin announced he would not return as director for the seventh film as he disagreed with the accelerated production the studio wanted, to release the film in summer of 2014. The studio’s request would require Lin to begin production on the seventh film during the production of Fast & Furious 6 before the sixth film was completed. Lin believed the studio’s wants would affect the quality of both films.\n\nDespite the two year gap between the previous films, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.[18] However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth installment was always intended to be the final entry directed by him.[19]\n\nIn April 2013, James Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced as the sequel's director, with Neal H. Moritz and Michael Fottrell returning to produce and Chris Morgan returning to write the script, his fifth in the series.
