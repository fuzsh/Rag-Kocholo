        "text": "The 48 Hour Film Project (48HFP) will occur in cities around the world on different weekends throughout the year.\n\nThe 48 Hour Film Project will occur between a Friday 7pm local time and the following Sunday 7pm local time. This is the Official Time Period. (Days of the competition may vary in some countries.)\n\nThe participating group/team must complete its film/video work in time to submit it on Sunday by 7:30pm.\n\nOnly works that meet the deadline will be officially part of the competition. All films received on Sunday (on-time and late) will be screened.\n\nEvery frame of your film MUST contain footage shot or created in the Official Time Period. This is \"core footage.\"\n\n\"Supporting footage,\" or footage shot or created BEFORE the Official Time Period (including stock footage that is part of a special effect) may be placed over or under the core footage, as long as every frame of your film contains some amount of core footage and the assembling of the core footage with the supporting footage occurs during the Official Time Period.\n\nAnimation, titles, and special effects can be considered core footage if it is created during the Official Time Period. (see Rule Y relating to footage created using Artificial Intelligence.)\n\nSupporting footage MAY NOT include people or other performers unless the supporting footage was shot during a previous 48HFP Official Time Period for a previously-submitted 48HFP film.\n\nStill photos are permitted as core footage. The still photos do not need to be created during the Official Time Period. Note: Still photos created outside of the Official Time Period being used in a sequence to create the illusion of motion are not acceptable as core footage, but are acceptable as supporting footage.\n\nYou must have rights to any footage or photos used in your film. A 48HFP Materials Release is required for all materials, photos, and/or footage not created in the Official Time Period.\n\nParticipating groups are encouraged to work with a composer and/or musicians to write and record music for the films. It is permissible for a participating group to use pre-recorded music; however, the participating group must have the rights to any music used in its film and must provide releases for all music used. As with music, pre-recorded sound effects are allowed, but you must have rights to use them.\n\nNote: Song parodies (i.e., use of identifiable pre-existing compositions with new or altered lyrics or music) may not be included in the film without a signed release from the composition's rights holder. This rule applies without regard to whether the song parody arguably constitutes fair use under US or international copyright law.\n\nPre-film Required Slates\n\nBefore the finished film begins, the media should have...\n\n5 seconds of black\n\n5 seconds title card with: team name, title, genre, city, and date\n\n5 seconds title card with: This film was made for the 48 Hour Film Project 2024.\n\nwww.48hourfilm.com/48hfp OR the animated bumper (6 seconds).\n\n2 seconds of black\n\nYour film follows this.\n\nTemplates for these titles and the animated bumper can be found on your Team Dashboard. It is not required to use our templates, you can create your own as long as the timing and information remains the same.\n\nOpening Credits\n\nAfter the 2 seconds of black, some films start with opening credits. These are not encouraged, but if you use them, opening credits are considered to be part of the film, and therefore count against the seven-minute maximum. Additionally, if your film has opening credits other than simply the film's title (for example, the names of directors, actors, etc.), you must include one of the following:\n\nthe text YOUR TEAM NAME presents immediately followed by a 48 Hour Film Project\n\nor\n\nthe text a 48 Hour Film Project immediately following the title of your film\n\nNote: a 48 Hour Film Project may be entirely lowercase (i.e., a 48 hour film project).\n\nEnd Credits\n\nCredits at the end of each film are limited to a maximum of 60 seconds. The 60 seconds is considered additional to the length of the film, as stated above. (That is, a film may be 7 minutes long, with an additional 60 seconds of credits, for a total running time of 8 minutes.) 48HFP reserves the right to shorten any end credits that exceed the maximum length for screening purposes.\n\nBloopers and/or behind the scenes are permitted during or after the end credits adhering to the 60 second maximum length.\n\nThe end credits must include the words: This film was made for the 48 Hour Film Project.\n\nwww.48hourfilm.com/48hfp\n\nSlates And Credits After The Competition\n\nFor any future screenings, online or otherwise, films should retain the pre-film title card that says: This film was made for the 48 Hour Film Project 2024. www.48hourfilm.com/48hfp.\n\nTo be eligible for the Project, Entries must be the original work of the Entrant; must not infringe third-party's rights; must be suitable for publication (i.e., may not be obscene or indecent); must not contain obscene or pornographic material; may not contain defamatory statements about any person, company, organization or entity; may not invade privacy or other rights of any person, company or entity; may not in any other way violate applicable laws and regulations; and may not contain any copyrighted elements (other than as owned by the Entrant and/or 48HFP).\n\nEntries containing prohibited or inappropriate content as determined by the 48HFP, in its sole discretion, to be inappropriate will be disqualified. 48HFP reserves the right to make the final determination as to which Entries are eligible. 48HFP reserves the right to refuse to screen a film or to make an announcement at the screening regarding the content of the film. 48HFP reserves the right to alter a film in order to remove or delete offensive or defamatory content."
