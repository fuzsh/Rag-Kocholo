        "text": "You probably use has and have often, but do you know the grammar rules behind how you use them?\n\nTake this pair of sentences: which one is correct?\n\nIs it, “Peter have a dog” or “Peter has a dog”?\n\nIf you’re not using a third person pronoun, like he, she, or it, or a name, you can almost always use \"have.\" Keep reading for the exceptions.\n\nWe’ll use the tips in this article to find out the answer and learn when to use has vs. have.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Have and Has?\n\nThe words \"has\" and \"have\" both come from the verb \"to have.\"\n\nTo have means to possess or hold something. It also means to experience or undergo something. \"Has\" and \"have\" both mean the same thing as \"to have.\"\n\nSo why are there two different versions of the word?\n\nWhen Should I Use Have or Has?\n\nIt’s all to do with who we are talking about. Whether you use have or has depends on the point of view you are using. Luckily, you only use has when talking in the third-person singular (that’s grammar jargon for using he, she, or it in a sentence).\n\nIf you’re not using he, she, or it, you can almost always use \"have.\" Keep reading for the exceptions.\n\nFirst, let’s look at some examples of when to use has and have.\n\nWhen Do I Use Have?\n\nWe use have when talking about ourselves in the first person perspective (using I), when addressing someone else directly in the second person perspective (using you), or when referring to multiple people in the third person plural (using they).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nI have a dog.\n\nYou have a cat.\n\nThey have horses.\n\nIn all three of the examples above, have is used to indicate ownership.\n\nNow take a look at these:\n\nI have seen that movie.\n\nYou have been there, right?\n\nThey have worked hard on this project.\n\nIn these examples, have is used to show that the subject of the sentence (I, you, they) has been through an experience (seeing the movie, going to a place, working on a project).\n\nTo recap: If you’re using I, we, you, or they, use have.\n\nWhen Do I Use Has?\n\nWe use has when talking about someone or something else in the third person singular. That means that if you’re referring to just one person or thing, and you’re not using \"I\" or \"you\" to refer to them, you need to use has.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nShe has red hair.\n\nHe has eight siblings.\n\nIt has many special features.\n\nAs before, in all of those examples has indicates ownership.\n\nNow take a look at these:\n\nShe has been to school.\n\nHe has learned how to crochet.\n\nIt has fallen over.\n\nIn these examples, has shows that the subject (she, he, or it) have experienced something (been to school) or undergone a change (learned to crochet, fallen over).\n\nAre Has and Have Singular or Plural?\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nHave can be singular (I / you have) or plural (we / they have)\n\nHas is always singular (he / she / it has)\n\nSeems simple, right? However, this can get tricky when you’re talking about a group of people, a team, or a company.\n\nIf you’re referring to a group of people with the pronoun everyone or everybody, you need to use has:\n\nEverybody has bad days.\n\nNow that everyone has a booklet, we’ll get started.\n\nBut if you’re referring to a general group such as children, people, and the media, you’ll need have:\n\nChildren have struggled during the pandemic.\n\nIt’s hard to tell if people have strong feelings on the subject.\n\nThe media have made the issue worse by causing panic.\n\nIs It \"The Team Has\" or \"The Team Have\"?\n\nIf you’re using a collective term, like family, team, company, or group, you can use has or have. This is because we can view these terms as one single group, or as a collection of individuals.\n\nThe team has achieved record results this year. (team = single group)\n\nThe team have achieved record results this year. (team = collection of individuals)\n\nDo I Use Has or Have with a Name?\n\nWhen you refer to an individual by name, you’re using the third person singular—that means you use has.\n\nThat’s because names take the place of \"he\" or \"she\" (or any other singular pronoun, like the non-binary pronoun, \"they\") in a sentence.\n\nHe has a dog.\n\nPeter has a dog.\n\nNow we have the answer to our earlier question. It’s Peter has a dog, not Peter have a dog.\n\nIs It \"She Should Have\" or \"She Should Has\"?\n\nIt’s she should have. Even though we are using she, which usually goes with has, the verb should has special rules.\n\nThat’s because it’s a modal verb. We won't get into those here, but you should know that if you always use have after a modal verb.\n\nHere are the verbs to look out for:\n\nWould: I would have gone, but I was held up at work.\n\nCould: You could have saved him.\n\nShould: She should have asked me before she sold my bike.\n\nShall: You shall have what you are given.\n\nWill: I will have the risotto, please.\n\nMight: He might have told me; I can’t remember.\n\nMay: They may have been right about that.\n\nCan: You can have whatever you want.\n\nWhat Tense Are Have and Has?\n\nWe can use the words have and has to make a few different tenses. This can get a bit complicated, but we’ll start simple.\n\nIf you are speaking about someone owning something in the present tense, you’ll use have or has with the same rules as before:\n\nShe has an ice cream.\n\nI have tickets to the concert.\n\nThey have coconut cream pie on the menu.\n\nThis is known as the simple present tense.\n\nIf you want to say that someone owned something in the past (but not necessarily now), use had. Had is the past tense version of have/has:\n\nHe had lots of jewellery.\n\nYou had an olive tree at the old house.\n\nThey had excellent WiFi at the hotel.\n\nThis is known as the simple past tense.\n\nYou can also use has, have, and had to create more complex tenses.\n\nIf you want to refer to something that started in the past and continues into the present, use have or has with the same rules as before plus an -ing verb:\n\nShe has always loved running.\n\nI have been going to ballet class since I was five.\n\nWhen Do You Use \"Was Having\" or \"Had Been Having\"?\n\nIf someone began owning or experiencing something in the past, and this was still happening when another event occurred, use was / were having, like this:\n\nI was having breakfast when he got home.\n\nJohn was having a nightmare when he woke up.\n\nDon’t blame yourself. You were having a terrible time at work already when it happened.\n\nIf you want to describe a continuing experience that occurred before a particular time in the past, use had been having:\n\nI had been having trouble with my car already when I set off on the journey.\n\nIs It Grammatically Correct to Write \"Had Had\"?\n\nIf you or someone else finished doing something before a specific point, you’ll need to use \"had\" before the action:\n\nNo wonder you’re hungry. You had finished your lunch before 10am!\n\nI had seen over 50 horror films by the time I was 13.\n\nShe had run a marathon before, but never as fast as she did this time.\n\nThis can look a bit weird if you want to say that you or someone else had finished owning or experiencing something before a point:\n\nThey had had their dinner by 7pm.\n\nYou had had that blanket for years before you lost it.\n\nI had had my prom dress ready for months before the event.\n\nIn all of these examples, it is correct to say \"had had.\"\n\nIf you’re worried about using have and has in your sentence, try ProWritingAid.

You can use have to / has to and must interchangeably, however sometimes must is more compelling.\n\nYou have to do your homework before you go to the skate park.\n\nYou must do your homework before you go to the skate park.\n\nWhile these sentences technically mean the same thing, using must in the second example sets a more commanding tone—the speaker is telling the listener what they must do.\n\nHere are some more examples of have to and has to in a sentence:\n\nI have to leave for work by eight.\n\nYou have to listen to this new band!\n\nShe has to learn her lines for the performance.\n\nChildren have to be accompanied by an adult to ride the rollercoaster.\n\nThe Government has to resolve the issue by the end of the week.\n\nIt has to stop raining before we can play football.\n\nCan I Use Have and Has in the Same Sentence?\n\nYes, of course! Just use the same rules we’ve already covered.\n\nFor example:\n\nShe has red shoes, but I have blue shoes.\n\nHe has seen movies that have not been released yet.\n\nYou might also use the phrase \"has to have\" in your sentence to mean \"must have\":\n\nShe has to have the correct uniform to attend school.\n\nJane is a perfectionist. She has to have everything planned down to the last detail.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Hasn’t and Haven’t?\n\nHasn’t and haven’t are negative contractions of has and have. They mean \"has not\" and \"have not\" respectively.\n\nWhen you use hasn’t or haven’t, it is usually to say that you have not experienced or undergone something, rather than to say that you do not own something.\n\nUse hasn’t and haven’t with the same rules we covered before. Hasn’t goes with she / he / it and haven’t goes with I / we / you / they.\n\nWe haven’t got any potatoes left in stock.\n\nThe shop hasn’t got any potatoes left in stock.\n\nI haven’t been able to get any potatoes.\n\nHow will you cook the dish if you haven’t got any potatoes?\n\nRemember, if you can replace the subject of the sentence (the thing doing the having or not having) with it, use hasn’t—like with \"the shop\" in the example above.\n\nWhat Are Some Examples of Has or Have in a Sentence?\n\nLet’s finish up with a quick-fire round of some common phrases that use has or have.\n\nIs It \"Does Have\" or \"Does Has\"?\n\nIt’s does have. This is because the verb to do (which turns into does, did, etc.) requires you to use the root form of any verb you put after it.\n\nThis sounds confusing, but all it means is that you need to use \"have\" after any version of the word \"do\" :\n\nYour plan does have its benefits.\n\nHe does have a point.\n\nIs It \"Did It Have\" or \"Did It Has\"?\n\nThis follows the same pattern as above. \"Did\" is the past tense version of the word \"do,\" so the answer is did it have.\n\nDid it have to end this way?\n\nDid she have a haircut?\n\nDid the hotel have a swimming pool?\n\nIs It \"Someone Have\" or \"Someone Has\"?\n\nSomeone is a singular pronoun, like he or she. That means that, in most cases, we use has.\n\nSomeone has poisoned the waterhole!\n\nHowever, if you’re asking a question beginning with \"Does,\" you need to use have, as above:\n\nDoes someone have time to help me with this?\n\nIs It \"Which Have\" or \"Which Has\"?\n\nThis depends on the subject of your sentence. Remember, we only use \"which\" with non-human subjects.\n\nIf it is a singular subject, use which has. If it is a plural subject, use which have.\n\nPlural: Watches, which have always been used to tell the time, now have many other purposes.\n\nSingular: The bandstand, which has been standing for 100 years, is being demolished this Saturday.\n\nHave You Got It?\n\nNow you know how to use have and has in your sentences. Remember, before you decide which one to use, check your tense and who you’re talking about.\n\nTake your writing to the next level:\n\n20 Editing Tips from Professional Writers\n\nWhether you are writing a novel, essay, article, or email, good writing is an essential part of communicating your ideas."
