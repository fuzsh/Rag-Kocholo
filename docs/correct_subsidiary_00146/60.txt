Oracle announced on Tuesday that it has purchased Sunopsis, an enterprise software company that manufactures software for heterogeneous data integration. The acquisition comes just days after a statement from Vishal Bhagwati, an Oracle vice president, indicated that the company would continue to aggressively pursue the purchase of smaller companies. Sunopsis, which was founded in 1998 and has offices in Boston, Paris and Singapore, is the latest in a string of Oracle buys that has included retailer-oriented software company Retek, logistics start-up G-Log and rival Siebel Systems.

According to a press release from Oracle, Sunopsis was acquired specifically as an enhancement to the Oracle Fusion Middleware line for its PeopleSoft products. Oracle bought PeopleSoft in January 2005 for $10.3 billion in a messy acquisition that was marked by layoffs and court battles. Since then, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has placed an emphasis on fusing Oracle and PeopleSoft products.
