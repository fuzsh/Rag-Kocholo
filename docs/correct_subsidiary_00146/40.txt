Oracle Corporation, founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates, has become a global giant in software and cloud computing. Initially known for its Oracle Database, the company has expanded its product and service offerings to encompass a wide range of enterprise software, hardware, and cloud solutions. Oracle's technologies are integral to businesses worldwide, supporting database management, enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and more. Oracle first registered its name as a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) September 5, 1989.

The company has grown through strategic acquisitions, enhancing its capabilities and market presence. Oracle's commitment to innovation has propelled it to the forefront of the tech industry, playing a significant role in shaping the landscape of business computing.

As a market-leading tech company, Oracle dedicates significant efforts towards protecting its brand and intellectual property by enforcing its trademark rights against potential infringements. The company was involved in litigation against Rimini Street, a third-party software support provider. Oracle filed a lawsuit, alleging copyright infringement and violation of its intellectual property rights. The dispute centered around Rimini Street's methods of providing support and maintenance services for Oracle software. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Oracle, determining that Rimini Street had engaged in "massive theft" of Oracle's intellectual property. The court awarded damages to Oracle, and Rimini Street subsequently entered into a settlement agreement. Another notable trademark dispute involving Oracle was Oracle America, Inc. v. SAP AG. This case originated in 2007 when Oracle sued SAP, alleging copyright infringement and illegal downloading of Oracle's software and support materials by a subsidiary of SAP, TomorrowNow. Oracle claimed that TomorrowNow had engaged in the unauthorized access and downloading of massive amounts of Oracle's proprietary software and support documentation. In 2010, SAP acknowledged the inappropriate downloads and copyright infringement, leading to a trial to determine damages. In 2012, a jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion in damages, one of the largest copyright infringement awards in history at that time.
