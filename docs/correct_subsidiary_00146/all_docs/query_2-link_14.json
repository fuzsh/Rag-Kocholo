        "text": "Welcome and Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Cloud Investment Plan for Oracle Analytics. This document provides you with an end-to-end view of Oracle’s product strategy and innovation plans for analytics, focusing on autonomous analytics. You will hear from our customers, our partners, and the Oracle Analytics team about how our solutions are creating value across a wide range of use cases and industries.\n\nWe are making tremendous strides in innovation, and we are recognized as a market leader by independent analyst firms Forrester Research and BARC. Our cloud-based solutions are integral to the success of thousands of businesses worldwide. In fact, today we have more than 5 million people using Oracle Analytics solutions as part of their daily decision-making.\n\nWe have a singular focus: to be the #1 provider of analytics value in the cloud marketplace. We are committed to each and every customer’s success. We encourage you to actively participate in the Oracle Analytics community and provide us with your direct and candid feedback on our strategy and product direction.\n\nI hope you enjoy this ebook, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWaqar Hasan\n\nSenior Vice President, Oracle Analytics\n\nExpand Insights Consumption:\n\nSimplify every interaction, cut through information overload\n\nTo expand the consumption of insights, we encourage broader adoption by adapting the analytics interface to the way people work. The true value of an analytics regimen is not measured by size, scale, or breadth, but by how many people and processes use it to drive decisions.\n\nVideo: Natural Language Interface\n\nVideo: Natural Language Interface\n\nContext is key. You want personalized access to information that’s important to you when you need it, anticipating your needs. Understanding where you are, what time it is, your interests, and who you collaborate with means your system can provide the best insights at the precise moment you need them.\n\nSpeed is a factor. Sometimes you just need to get an answer quickly. You can use text and voice to search and explore the data based on familiar terms such as “Revenue by product line and country.” Oracle Analytics Cloud can autonomously query the data and create the best visualization to illustrate the answers.\n\nWords can enrich. Through a natural language interface, visualizations are complemented by an autonomous narrative that changes as you navigate. The text summarizes salient points so that you can focus on what the data really means and filter out the dissonance that comes from different interpretations of a visualization. Natural language generation makes the analytic experience much more conversational.\n\nPower Deeper Insights:\n\nHelping you find and act on hidden insights\n\nTo deliver deeper, more meaningful insights, you can either rely on significant human effort and lots of smart people, or you can energize your efforts and use the power of machine learning to automate a wide range of tasks.\n\nDeeper analysis and recommendations. Autonomous analytics can recommend what data to analyze, how it could be augmented, and what it really means. It can suggest key drivers and insights to guide analysis, and it can recommend the best way to interpret data and what actions to take as a result. When autonomous analytics is viewed as a pipeline process—from discovery to prediction—its reach is virtually unlimited.\n\nScenarios and what-if models. Understanding insights is just the first step. The next step is to use those insights to build scenarios and what-if models—visualizing a set of alternative outcomes by using built-in intelligence to determine the actions you should take next.\n\n5. Security and Privacy:\n\na. Visualize and track data lineage, including identifying data by source, use case, author, actors, domain, and other attributes derived from the data itself and surfaced in data profiles\n\nb. Use machine learning to drive automatic recommendations for user roles and privileges (adding and removing)\n\nc. Manage sensitive data, including tracking the use of data containing personally identifiable information and automatically masking sensitive attribute values\n\nAlthough our strategic investment is in our cloud platform, we understand that many of you are still early in your cloud journey or are in regulated industries that require you to keep your data or applications on premises. To help ensure that you have what you need to support your current business and to plot a practical path to the cloud, we are releasing an update to Oracle Business Intelligence 12c on premises that includes several enhancements, most notably an upgrade of the integrated version of Oracle Data Visualization.\n\nCloud First\n\nFor many of you, the first step in your journey to the cloud is to consider deploying net-new analytics projects in the public cloud, instead of the traditional on-premises stack; also known as Cloud First. This gives you the quickest time to value because it streamlines new activities and avoids the analysis and effort to completely migrate existing projects. Many new projects can be up and running within days or weeks. This approach also lets you experiment with the latest and greatest software options to gauge which follow-on projects can fully leverage modern capabilities.\n\nCloud @ Customer\n\nIf you are eager to achieve the benefits of cloud operations but are unable to move to public cloud environments for regulatory, privacy, or other corporate-level reasons, we offer a unique solution through the Cloud @ Customer option. This option delivers Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to your data center. Rather than procuring hardware, installing software, and managing the system, you can easily consume cloud services on your premises on a subscription basis, just as you do with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle provides the hardware, installs the Oracle Cloud software, and manages the day-to-day operation of the Oracle Cloud Machine infrastructure and Oracle Cloud. You can use these cloud services as building blocks to accelerate the development of innovative applications.\n\nKeep and Connect\n\nAfter you have become familiar with the basics of cloud-based analytics, your next decision is what to do with existing on-premises reports, dashboards, and databases. This can be stressful because there are potential risks in migrating any existing production system.\n\nOracle Analytics Cloud makes this process easier because it allows dashboard migration and database migration to be considered separately. If you are using Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition version 11.1.1.7 or later, you can readily lift and shift your business intelligence models (RPD) and corresponding dashboards (web catalog) through export and migration utilities into the latest Oracle Analytics Cloud environment. It’s important to note that you can leave the corresponding databases and data warehouses on premises.\n\nThis mode is Keep and Connect, or hybrid cloud. Oracle Analytics Cloud lets you query and visualize data sources directly from the cloud without physically moving any data. This technique is also popular with Oracle BI Applications customers who want to move version 7.9.6.3 or later deployments to a more flexible infrastructure. You can also begin new projects in Oracle Analytics Cloud that access on-premises data."
