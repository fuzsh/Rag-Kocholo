        "text": "A bar chart is used when you want to show a distribution of data points or perform a comparison of metric values across different subgroups of your data. From a bar chart, we can see which groups are highest or most common, and how other groups compare against the others. Since this is a fairly common task, bar charts are a fairly ubiquitous chart type.\n\nThe primary variable of a bar chart is its categorical variable. A categorical variable takes discrete values, which can be thought of as labels. Examples include state or country, industry type, website access method (desktop, mobile), and visitor type (free, basic, premium). Some categorical variables have ordered values, like dividing objects by size (small, medium, large). In addition, some non-categorical variables can be converted into groups, like aggregating temporal data based on date (eg. dividing by quarter into 20XX-Q1, 20XX-Q2, 20XX-Q3, 20XX-Q4, etc.) The important point for this primary variable is that the groups are distinct.\n\nIn contrast, the secondary variable will be numeric in nature. The secondary variable’s values determine the length of each bar. These values can come from a great variety of sources. In its simplest form, the values may be a simple frequency count or proportion for how much of the data is divided into each category – not an actual data feature at all. For example, the following plot counts pageviews over a period of six months. You can see from this visualization that there was a small peak in June and July before returning to the previous baseline.\n\nAnother major no-no is to mess with the shape of the bars to be plotted. Some tools will allow for the rounding of the bar caps, rather than just have straight edges. This rounding means that it’s difficult for the reader to tell where to read the actual value: from the top of the semicircle, or somewhere in the middle? A little bit of rounding of the corners can be okay, but make sure each bar is flat enough to discern its true value and provide an easy comparison between bars.\n\nSimilarly, you should avoid including 3-d effects on your bars. As with heavy rounding, this can make it harder to know how to measure bar lengths, and as a bonus, might cause baselines to not be aligned (see the above point).\n\nConsider the ordering of category levels\n\nOne consideration you should have when putting together a bar chart is what order in which you will plot the bars. A standard convention to take is to sort the bars from longest to shortest: while it is always possible to compare the bar lengths no matter the order, this can reduce the burden on the reader to make those comparisons themselves. The major exception to this is if the category labels are inherently ordered in some way. In cases like that, the inherent ordering usually takes precedence.\n\nReplacing bars with images\n\nIt may be tempting to replace bars with pictures that depict what is being measured (e.g. bags of money for money amounts), be careful that you do not misrepresent your data in this way. If your choice of symbol scales both width and height with value, differences will look much larger than they actually are, since people will end up comparing the areas of the bars rather than just their widths or heights. In the example below, there is a 58% growth in downloads from 2018 to 2019. However, this growth is exaggerated with the icon-based representation, since the surface area of the 2019 icon is more than 2.5 times the size of the 2018 icon.\n\nIf you feel the need to use icons to depict value, then a better – though still not great – option is to use the pictogram chart type instead. In a pictogram chart, each category’s value is indicated by a series of icons, with each icon representing a certain quantity. In a certain sense, this is like changing the texture of its corresponding bar to a repeating image. One major caution with this chart type is that it can make values harder to read, since the reader needs to perform some mental mathematics to gauge the relative values of each category.\n\nInclude variability whiskers\n\nWhen the numeric values are a summary measure, a frequent consideration is whether or not to include error bars in the plot. Error bars are additional whiskers added to the end of each bar to indicate variability in the individual data points that contributed to the summary measure. Since there are many choices for uncertainty measure (e.g. standard deviation, confidence interval, interquartile range) it is important that when you display error bars, that you note in an annotation or comment what the error bars represent.\n\nAlternatively, you may wish to depict variance within each category with a different chart type such as the box plot or violin plot. While these plots will have more elements for a reader to parse, they provide a deeper understanding of the distribution of values within each group.\n\nStacked bar chart and grouped bar chart\n\nBar charts can be extended when we introduce a second categorical variable to divide each of the groups in the original categorical variable. If the bar values depict group frequencies, the second categorical variable can divide each bar’s count into subgroups. Applied to the original bars, this results in a stacked bar chart, seen on the left in the figure below. Alternatively, if we move the different subgroups’ bars to the baseline, the resulting chart type is the grouped bar chart, seen on the right. We also use the grouped bar chart when we compute statistical summary measures across levels of two categorical variables."
