        "text": "Record quarterly revenue of $26.0 billion, up 18% from Q4 and up 262% from a year ago\n\nRecord quarterly Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion, up 23% from Q4 and up 427% from a year ago\n\nTen-for-one forward stock split effective June 7, 2024\n\nQuarterly cash dividend raised 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 28, 2024, of $26.0 billion, up 18% from the previous quarter and up 262% from a year ago.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.98, up 21% from the previous quarter and up 629% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $6.12, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 461% from a year ago.\n\n“The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.\n\n“Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\n\n“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere — from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs — through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.”\n\nNVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of NVIDIA’s issued common stock to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to NVIDIA’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024.\n\nNVIDIA is increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.\n\nQ1 Fiscal 2025 Summary\n\nGAAP ($ in millions, except earnings\n\nper share) Q1 FY25 Q4 FY24 Q1 FY24 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue $26,044 $22,103 $7,192 Up 18% Up 262% Gross margin 78.4% 76.0% 64.6% Up 2.4 pts Up 13.8 pts Operating expenses $3,497 $3,176 $2,508 Up 10% Up 39% Operating income $16,909 $13,615 $2,140 Up 24% Up 690% Net income $14,881 $12,285 $2,043 Up 21% Up 628% Diluted earnings per share $5.98 $4.93 $0.82 Up 21% Up 629%\n\nNon-GAAP ($ in millions, except earnings\n\nper share) Q1 FY25 Q4 FY24 Q1 FY24 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue $26,044 $22,103 $7,192 Up 18% Up 262% Gross margin 78.9% 76.7% 66.8% Up 2.2 pts Up 12.1 pts Operating expenses $2,501 $2,210 $1,750 Up 13% Up 43% Operating income $18,059 $14,749 $3,052 Up 22% Up 492% Net income $15,238 $12,839 $2,713 Up 19% Up 462% Diluted earnings per share $6.12 $5.16 $1.09 Up 19% Up 461%\n\nOutlook\n\nNVIDIA’s outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows:\n\nRevenue is expected to be $28.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended April 28, April 30, 2024 2023 Revenue $ 26,044 $ 7,192 Cost of revenue 5,638 2,544 Gross profit 20,406 4,648 Operating expenses Research and development 2,720 1,875 Sales, general and administrative 777 633 Total operating expenses 3,497 2,508 Operating Income 16,909 2,140 Interest income 359 150 Interest expense (64 ) (66 ) Other, net 75 (15 ) Other income (expense), net 370 69 Income before income tax 17,279 2,209 Income tax expense 2,398 166 Net income $ 14,881 $ 2,043 Net income per share: Basic $ 6.04 $ 0.83 Diluted $ 5.98 $ 0.82 Weighted average shares used in per share computation: Basic 2,462 2,470 Diluted 2,489 2,490\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In millions) (Unaudited) April 28, January 28, 2024 2024 ASSETS Current assets: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 31,438 $ 25,984 Accounts receivable, net 12,365 9,999 Inventories 5,864 5,282 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4,062 3,080 Total current assets 53,729 44,345 Property and equipment, net 4,006 3,914 Operating lease assets 1,532 1,346 Goodwill 4,453 4,430 Intangible assets, net 986 1,112 Deferred income tax assets 7,798 6,081 Other assets 4,568 4,500 Total assets $ 77,072 $ 65,728 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 2,715 $ 2,699 Accrued and other current liabilities 11,258 6,682 Short-term debt 1,250 1,250 Total current liabilities 15,223 10,631 Long-term debt 8,460 8,459 Long-term operating lease liabilities 1,281 1,119 Other long-term liabilities 2,966 2,541 Total liabilities 27,930 22,750 Shareholders' equity 49,142 42,978 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 77,072 $ 65,728\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In millions) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended April 28, April 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $ 14,881 $ 2,043 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Stock-based compensation expense 1,011 735 Depreciation and amortization 410 384 Realized and unrealized (gains) losses on investments in non-affiliated entities, net (69 ) 14 Deferred income taxes (1,577 ) (1,135 ) Other (145 ) (34 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions: Accounts receivable (2,366 ) (252 ) Inventories (577 ) 566 Prepaid expenses and other assets (726 ) (215 ) Accounts payable (22 ) 11 Accrued and other current liabilities 4,202 689 Other long-term liabilities 323 105 Net cash provided by operating activities 15,345 2,911 Cash flows from investing activities: Proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 4,004 2,512 Proceeds from sales of marketable securities 149 -
