Navigate to the Alerts page as follows: Technical Libraries/ERP Applications/Applications Installation and Upgrade/Alerts.\n\nSelf-Service Toolkit: You may also find information by navigating to the Self-Service Toolkit page as follows: Technical Libraries/ERP Applications/Applications Installation and Upgrade.\n\nDo Not Use Database Tools to Modify Oracle Applications Data\n\nOracle STRONGLY RECOMMENDS that you never use SQL*Plus, Oracle Data Browser, database triggers, or any other tool to modify Oracle Applications data unless otherwise instructed.\n\nOracle provides powerful tools you can use to create, store, change, retrieve, and maintain information in an Oracle database. But if you use Oracle tools such as SQL*Plus to modify Oracle Applications data, you risk destroying the integrity of your data and you lose the ability to audit changes to your data.\n\nBecause Oracle Applications tables are interrelated, any change you make using Oracle Applications can update many tables at once. But when you modify Oracle Applications data using anything other than Oracle Applications, you may change a row in one table without making corresponding changes in related tables. If your tables get out of synchronization with each other, you risk retrieving erroneous information and you risk unpredictable results throughout Oracle Applications.\n\nWhen you use Oracle Applications to modify your data, Oracle Applications automatically checks that your changes are valid. Oracle Applications also keeps track of who changes information. If you enter information into database tables using database tools, you may store invalid information. You also lose the ability to track who has changed your information because SQL*PIus and other database tools do not keep a record of changes.\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle Corporation develops and markets an integrated line of software products for database management, applications development, decision support, and office automation, as well as Oracle Applications, an integrated suite of more than 160\n\nxvii\n\nsoftware modules for financial management, supply chain management, manufacturing, project systems, human resources and customer relationship management\n\nOracle products are available for mainframes, minicomputers, personal computers, network computers and personal digital assistants, allowing organizations to integrate different computers, different operating systems, different networks, and even different database management systems, into a single, unified computing and information resource.\n\nOracle is the world's leading supplier of software for information management, and the world's second largest software company.

Details are not provided to anyone outside of the immediate development environment, nor are they intended for use by anyone outside of the e-Business Suite development environment.\n\nPublic APIs are designed for customers and Oracle consultants to integrate non-Oracle systems into Oracle e-Business Suite or to extend the functionality of the base products. Oracle does not support public APIs unless they are published in a reference manual such as this one. The user accepts all risk and responsibility for working with non-published public APIs.\n\nPublic, published APIs are guaranteed by Oracle to remain valid from release to release and that patches will not alter the API behavior. Public, published APIs are supported by Oracle to the same extent as released software.\n\nFor non-published APIs, Oracle expressly does not provide any guarantees regarding consistency of naming, usage, or behavior of any API (public or private) between releases. It is also possible that a patch could alter any characteristic of any non-published e-Business Suite API. As such, those who choose to use these APIs do so at their own risk. However, Oracle does attempt to minimize all changes to public APIs, even if not published.\n\nIntroduction 1-1\n\nParameter Specifications\n\nNote: In Applications release 11.5.9, many of the Applications' PL/SQL server side APIs have been enhanced to utilize the pass by reference semantics of PL/SQL. This improves performance considerably and reduces memory consumption. In the normal processing case (i.e. success), there is no change of behavior, and callers of these APIs are not impacted. However, in the case of exceptions, there is a behavior change which results in assignments being exposed to the caller, which are made in the API prior to any exceptions being raised. The previous behavior would rollback these assignments made by the API if an exception occurred in this API. Developers writing custom extensions to Oracle Applications, or third party integrators which use the standard Applications' APIs should be aware of this change in semantics.\n\nThe Common Application Components APIs\n\nThe public APIs provided by the Oracle Common Application Components and described in this document are divided into groups of public packages. There are one or more packages for each of the following Oracle Common Application Components modules covered here:\n\nResource Manager\n\nTask Manager\n\nNotes\n\nEach published API provides an API specification, and definitions as for its parameters, data structures, and status messages. Sample scripts and documented process flow diagrams are included where applicable.\n\nNote: The words procedure and API are used interchangeably in this document\n\n1.1 Parameter Specifications\n\nThe specifications for the public APIs provided by the Oracle Common Application Components define four categories of parameters:\n\nStandard IN\n\nStandard OUT\n\n1-2 Oracle Common Application Components API Reference Guide\n\nParameter Specifications\n\nProcedure specific IN\n\nProcedure specific OUT\n\nStandard IN and OUT parameters are specified by the Oracle Applications business object API Coding Standards, and are discussed in the following sections.\n\nProcedure specific IN and OUT parameter are related to the API being specified, and are discussed with that individual API.\n\n1.1.1 Standard IN Parameters\n\nThe following table describes standard IN parameters, which are common to all public APIs provided by Oracle Common Application Components.\n\nTable 1-1 Standard IN Parameters\n\nParameter Data Type Required Description p_api_version NUMBER Yes This must match the version number of the API. An unexpected error is returned if the calling program version number is incompatible with the current API version number (provided in the documentation). p_init_msg_list VARCHAR2 Yes The valid values for this parameter are:\n\nTrue = FND_API.G_TRUE\n\nFalse = FND_API.G_FALSE\n\nDefault = FND_API.G_FALSE\n\nIf set to true, then the API makes a call to fnd_msg_pub.initialize to initialize the message stack. To set to true, use the value, \"T\".\n\nIf set to false then the calling program must initialize the message stack. This action is required to be performed only once, even in the case where more than one API is called. To set to false, use the value, \"F\".\n\nIntroduction 1-3\n\nParameter Specifications\n\nTable 1-1 Standard IN Parameters\n\nParameter Data Type Required Description p_commit VARCHAR2(1) No The valid values for this parameter are:\n\nTrue = FND_API.G_TRUE\n\nFalse = FND_API.G_FALSE\n\nDefault = FND_API.G_FALSE\n\nIf set to true, then the API commits before returning to the calling program. To set to true, use the value, \"T\".\n\nIf set to false, then it is the calling program's responsibility to commit the transaction. To set to false, use the value, \"F\".\n\n1.1.2 Standard OUT Parameters\n\nThe following table describes standard OUT parameters, which are common to all public APIs provided by Oracle Common Application Components.\n\nNote: All standard OUT parameters are required.\n\nTable 1-2 Standard OUT Parameters\n\nParameter Data Type Description x_return_status VARCHAR2(l) Indicates the return status of the API. The values returned are one of the following:\n\nFND_API.G_RET_STS_SUCCESS\n\nSuccess: Indicates the API call was successful\n\nFND_API.G_RET_STS_ERROR\n\nExpected Error: There is a validation error, or missing data error.\n\nFND_API.G_RET_STS_UNEXP_ERROR\n\nUnexpected Error: The calling program can not correct the error.\n\nx_msg_count NUMBER Holds the number of messages in the message list.\n\n1-4 Oracle Common Application Components API Reference Guide\n\nParameter Specifications\n\nTable 1-2 Standard OUT Parameters\n\nParameter Data Type Description x_msg_data VARCHAR2(2000) Holds the encoded message if x_msg_count is equal to one.\n\n1.1.3 Parameter Size\n\nVerify the size of the column from the base table for that column when passing a parameter of a specific length. For example, if you pass a NUMBER value, first query to find the exact value to pass. An incorrect value can cause the API call to fail.\n\n1.1.4 Missing Parameter Attributes\n\nThe following table describes optional IN parameters which are initialized to pre-defined values representing missing constants. These constants are defined for the common PL/SQL data types and should be used in the initialization of the API formal parameters.\n\nTable 1-3 Initialized IN Parameters\n\nParameter Type Initialized Value G_MISS_NUM CONSTANT NUMBER= 9.99E125 G_MISS_CHAR CONSTANT VARCHAR2(l):=chr(0) G_MISS_DATE CONSTANT DATE:= TO_DATE('l','j');\n\nThese constants are defined in the package FND_API in the file fndpapis.pls. All columns in a record definition are set to the G_MISS_X constant as defined for the data type.\n\n1.1.5 Parameter Validations\n\nThe following types of parameters are always validated during the API call:\n\nStandard IN\n\nStandard OUT\n\nMandatory procedure specific IN\n\nProcedure specific OUT\n\nIntroduction 1-5\n\nVersion Information\n\n1.1.6 Invalid Parameters\n\nIf the API encounters any invalid parameters during the API call, then one of the following actions will occur:\n\nAn exception is raised.\n\nAn error message identifying the invalid parameter is generated.\n\nAll API actions are cancelled.\n\n1.2 Version Information\n\nIt is mandatory that every API call pass a version number for that API as its first parameter (p_api_version).\n\nThis version number must match the internal version number of that API. An unexpected error is returned if the calling program version number is incompatible with the current API version number.\n\nWarning: The currently supported version at this time is 1.0. Use only this for the API version number.\n\nIn addition, the object version number must be input for all update and delete APIs.\n\nIf the object_version_ number passed by the API matches that of the object in the database, then the update is completed.\n\nIf the object_version_number passed by the API does not match that of the object in the database, then an error condition is generated.\n\n1.3 Status Messages\n\nEvery API must return one of the following states as parameter x_return_status after the API is called:\n\nS (Success)\n\n1-6 Oracle Common Application Components API Reference Guide\n\nStatus Messages\n\nE (Error)\n\nU (Unexpected error)\n\nEach state can be associated with a status message. The following table describes each state.\n\nTable 1-4 Status Messsage and Description\n\nStatus Description S Indicates that the API performed all the operations requested by its caller.\n\nA success return status may or may not be accompanied by messages in the API message list.\n\nCurrently, the Oracle Common Application Components APIs do not provide a message for a return status of success.\n\nE Indicates that the API failed to perform one or more of the operations requested by its caller.\n\nAn error return status is accompanied by one or more messages describing the error.\n\nU Indicates that the API encountered an error condition it did not expect, or could not handle, and that it is unable to continue with its regular processing.\n\nFor example, certain programming errors such as attempting to divide by zero causes this error.\n\nThese types of errors usually cannot be corrected by the user and requires a system administrator or application developer to correct.\n\nWarning and Information Messages\n\nIn addition to these three types of possible status messages, you can also code the following additional message types:\n\nWarnings\n\nInformation\n\nTo create a warning message, perform the following steps:\n\nCreate a global variable to be used to signal a warning condition. For example, this could be similar to the following:\n\nG_RET_STS_WARNING := 'W'\n\nThis global variable is not part of the FND_API package.\n\nIntroduction 1-7\n\nStatus Messages\n\nReturn this value if the warning condition is encountered. For example, using the same example as in step one, set up the following code in the API to process the warning condition:\n\nx_return_status := G_RET_STS_WARNING\n\nThis code replaces the more usual:\n\nx_return_status := fnd_api.g_ret_sts_unexp_error for \"U\"\n\nIf desired, perform, a similar procedure to create Information messages.\n\n1-8 Oracle Common Application Components API Reference Guide"
