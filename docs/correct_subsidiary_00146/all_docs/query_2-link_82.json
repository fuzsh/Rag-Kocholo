        "text": "The global customer experience as a service (CXaaS) market size was USD 1.45 billion in 2020. The market is projected to grow from USD 1.64 billion in 2021 to USD 4.17 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 14.2% during the 2021-2028 period. The global impact of COVID-19 has been unprecedented and staggering, with the CXaaS platform witnessing a positive demand shock across all regions amid the pandemic. Based on our analysis, the global market exhibited a significant growth of 13.2% in 2020 as compared to year-on-year growth during 2017-2019. The steady rise in CAGR is attributable to this market’s demand and growth, returning to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over.\n\nThe growth of global market is mainly driven by increasing adoption of digitization among various industry verticals, rapid integration of multichannel touchpoints, and a growing need for customer data analysis to drive business growth. Brands increasingly depend on customer experience management solutions to boost customer experience solutions, determine customer requirements, and manage customer interactions. The key players operating in the market enter into strategic partnerships and collaborations to integrate the customer experience as a service platform with several critical components and enhance their solutions. For instance,\n\nIn January 2021, Hexaware Technologies Ltd. announced a partnership with Active.AI, headquartered in Singapore. The partnership aims to provide next-generation Digital Customer Experiences for the Banking and Insurance Industries. The collaboration will enable omnichannel banking experiences powered by innovation for a better customer experience.\n\nSuch initiatives by key players are likely to propel the adoption of customer experience as a service among businesses.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n\nGrowth of Global Retail and E-commerce Industry to Boost Adoption of Customer Experience as a Service Platforms Amid COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has a moderate impact on this market. COVID-19 has had a major influence on several core industries, such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation. On the other hand, due to a sudden increase in consumers, end-users such as retail, e-commerce, healthcare, and the public sector rapidly implemented Customer Experience Management (CEM) solutions during the pandemic.\n\nFor handling extensive customer data and satisfying consumer expectations, businesses are turning to customer experience services. E-commerce, logistics, online learning, food delivery, and online business collaboration are all seeing significant growth, putting pressure on their customer-facing applications and forcing them to adopt effective customer experience platforms. Key players operating in the market are taking key initiatives to offer companies end-to-end personalized experience services. This factor is expected to boost the demand for customer experience as a service during the spread of Covid-19. For instance,\n\nIn April 2021, TTEC Holdings, Inc., a leading CX technology and services company, acquired Avtex, an IT managed services company. This acquisition will complement TTEC’s CX-as-a-Service (CXaaS) technology and services platform. With this acquisition, TTEC plans to expand its global footprints in the CX services and technology industry.\n\nDue to the increasing desire for a single customer view and decreased attrition rates during the COVID-19 crisis, there is a rise in demand for customer experience platforms. The adoption of sophisticated technology to provide a better customer experience is projected to expand exponentially, fueling the market's growth. The COVID-19 epidemic is reshaping the industry and has altered all company strategies in recent times.\n\nLATEST TRENDS\n\nRequest a Free sample to learn more about this report.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) will Transform the Market by Unleashing Value Across Customer Experience Channels\n\nAI is ushering in a new era of consumer experience (CX) strategy, design, and development. Leading businesses sort through AI trends and invest in sophisticated technology to support their customer experience initiatives. Artificial intelligence may be used to offer a smart, convenient, and informed customer experience at each step in the customer journey. This factor will result in reimagined customer experiences and personalized end-to-end customer journeys that seem more natural to customers. According to a study conducted by Microsoft Corporation, 95% of all customer interactions will be through AI-based communication channels by 2025.\n\nEvery customer interaction with a brand across various communication channels generates a trail of data that may be utilized to develop intelligence and determine the types of services to be provided. AI has enabled businesses to examine enormous amounts of data and manage any client history. AI-enhanced customer experience is being used in various areas, including improving customer support and service interactions, increasing returns, identifying issues, and improving website experience, message, and personalized offerings. This trend will result in reimagined customer experience and end-to-end customer journeys that are more personalized to customers.\n\nDRIVING FACTORS\n\nIncreasing Need for a Comprehensive Customer Experience Service Platform to Aid Growth\n\nBrands increasingly rely on customer experience services to discover consumer needs and ensure that customer demands and corporate offerings are in line. Businesses are also integrating cloud-based technology, advanced analytics, and automation to offer highly tailored customer experiences, decrease churn rate, and promote brand loyalty. Companies are always focusing on adopting CX offerings that allow successful customer experience to stay competitive in the market. Throughout the customer experience industry, companies create partnerships and co-operate with other major players to provide customized services based on customer outcomes and data interpretation. For instance,\n\nIn May 2021, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a global leader in IT and consulting services, launched a cloud-based Subscription solution that leverages SAP business technology platform to help media companies to transform the customer experience.\n\nIn June 2018, Zendesk Inc. launched new collaboration and workflow tools to help organizations deliver better customer experience services. These tools are designed to help large organizations respond to customers' needs easily and quickly, deliver better customer needs, and help customer agents to collaborate with business professionals to solve customer issues.\n\nThese efforts by major players are assisting businesses in transforming their digital portfolios, eliminating friction in interactions, and establishing a culture of continual innovation that will enable them to make more fundamental organizational changes and enhance customer experience.\n\nRESTRAINING FACTORS\n\nDifficulties in Receiving Constant Customer Feedback Through all Channels to Impede Market Progress\n\nThe customer interactions with enterprises matter for delivering effective customer experience suites and consistency throughout the customer journey. Businesses amass vast amounts of data through a number of channels to better understand consumer preferences, requirements, and purchase habits, among other attributes. With the constant expansion and complexity of touchpoints in the customer feedback process, businesses must enhance the speed of integration. Data is acquired from many touchpoints that are distinct from one another, and organizations must categorize the information depending on consumer needs and expectations. Due to the data set differentiation between different touchpoints, businesses and customer experience management teams find it difficult to structure it differently. To examine a huge number of structured and unstructured datasets, companies need to invest in resources.\n\nAdditionally, the companies must follow consumer protection policies such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to comply with security legislation. In data thefts or security breaches, businesses may be subject to legal proceedings against consumers' data. This factor causes difficulties that hinder customer experience as a service from providing the best Return on Investment (ROI).\n\nSEGMENTATION\n\nBy Service Type Analysis\n\nTo know how our report can help streamline your business, Speak to Analyst\n\nCross Channel Marketing to Capture High market Share\n\nThe global market has been segmented into campaign development, cross-channel marketing, Omnichannel engagement, and others based on service type.\n\nThe cross-channel marketing segment captured the largest market share in 2020.
