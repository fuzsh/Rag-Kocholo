        "text": "ORACLE seems to accept their products are difficult to use and deploy as per following statement, and this is good.\n\n“Organizations realize the need for a more simplified approach to address project portfolio management initiatives – and yet most solutions are too complicated and expensive to deploy,” said Mike Sicilia, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Oracle Primavera.\n\nGood things might come to the IT community but not necessarily for other industries.\n\nPrimavera P3e the precursor of P6 was similarly acquired from another company different to the developers of Primavera P3, different to the developers of P3e. All products initially intended for IT projects.\n\nMaybe they found out software that do not depend on their monstrous database systems when an application specific is more efficient. The outside databases for which P6 is designed are difficult to deploy for the non IT people and take hundreds of megabits. Applications like Asta Power Project and Spider Project can do even more, in a more efficient way with their specific database integrated with their software. Asta Power Project requires less than 80 MB while Spider Project requires less than 30 MB for full deployment, and that is efficiency. By making their database OBDC compliant their database can communicate to many other external proprietary databases databases.\n\nIt might mean that the great absentee, functionality for Volume of Work will continue being absent. IT people do not need nor understand Volume of Work [seems like they don't need it] contrary to construction people where this is everyday talk.\n\nVolume of work and productivity based on volume of work has been at the center of the management of construction jobs. Even the builders of the Great Pyramid would follow how many stones were placed on a given time by a given amount of labor, Primavera Products now ORACLE products seems to overlook this functionality critical to those of us working on construction jobs.\n\nIf this product brings the functionality for Volume of Work then it might be good, otherwise I do not believe it will benefit those in the construction industry."
