We deliver a curriculum that combines knowledge in technology and data analytics with human skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, and an entrepreneurial mindset.\n\nBringing all of that together is Northeastern’s experience-powered approach to education. Students build their own personal brands as they explore a vast array of real-world experiences on their paths to graduation, including global immersion, undergraduate research, service-learning projects, interdisciplinary courses, and our signature co-op program.\n\nOur expert faculty members have a deep understanding of business theory, which they apply to both their research and teaching; many also consult and partner with the corporate world. They’re plugged into industry trends and will challenge and inspire you. Dedicated academic advisors and co-op coordinators are on hand every step of the way to help students make decisions throughout their academic and professional careers.\n\nThe school offers Bachelor of Science degrees in:\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nInternational Business\n\nCombined majors\n\nFor each degree program students must choose one of the concentrations listed below:\n\nAccounting\n\nAccounting and Advisory Services\n\nBrand Management\n\nBusiness Analytics\n\nCorporate Innovation\n\nEntrepreneurial Startups\n\nFamily Business\n\nFinance\n\nFintech\n\nGlobal Business and Strategy (available only to combined major(s) with International Business)\n\nHealthcare Management and Consulting\n\nInternational Business (available only as a second concentration)\n\nManagement\n\nManagement Information Systems\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing Analytics\n\nSocial Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nThe business curriculum is enhanced by courses in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. In addition to their academic courses, all students are required to complete a cooperative education plan.\n\nCooperative education, or co-op, is experiential learning and deliberately integrates and blends the application of theory into practice. During co-op, students apply knowledge and skills learned across multiple contexts (classes, extracurricular activities, as student leaders, and by engaging in research) in a professional work environment. This application stimulates inquiry and expands knowledge acquisition when students return from co-op and engage in class discussion and discourse. By engaging on co-op, students develop increased self-awareness, a sense of purpose, and define career aspirations to impact postgraduate employment opportunities and lifelong learning. D'Amore-McKim students work together with their academic advisor and co-op coordinator to plan and prepare for their co-op experiences during their time at Northeastern and are required to complete one co-op experience and its prerequisites. Eligibility and the timeline for participation on co-op are based upon a variety of factors and are integrated into a student's academic plan.\n\nThe undergraduate program of the D’Amore-McKim School of Business meets the standards of AACSB International—The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business—for faculty and student quality, curriculum design, and overall university support.\n\nAfter graduation, students may obtain jobs in all aspects of business, both domestically and internationally, as well as in nonprofits and government.\n\nAcademic Progression Standards\n\nIn addition to meeting the university progression standards, students must achieve a 2.000 grade-point average in business courses. Freshmen must complete at least 32 semester hours in order to progress to sophomore status. Freshmen who earn fewer than 32 SH must make up the difference prior to graduation. Students beyond the first year must complete at least 16 SH each in-school (not on co-op) full semester and 8 SH each in-school summer half semester in order to progress to the next class standing.\n\nStudents who do not meet academic progression standards will be placed on academic probation and may be subject to dismissal from the university.\n\nPass/Fail Option\n\nD’Amore-McKim School of Business students may opt to take courses on a pass/fail basis in accordance with university policy but should be aware that this policy applies to nonbusiness courses that will count as open electives only. Business courses may not be taken pass/fail under any circumstance.\n\nTaking Courses While on Co-op\n\nStudents may take one class either online or in person while on co-op during the fall, spring, or summer term. Course participation should not interfere with the student’s work performance on co-op. With prior written approval of their co-op coordinator and academic advisor, a student may register for a maximum of two courses or 8 SH while on co-op.\n\nExternal Transfer to the D’Amore-McKim School of Business\n\nExternal transfer students are accepted from other academic institutions during the fall and spring terms. Applications and accompanying materials are submitted directly to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nThe D’Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University is accredited by AACSB International—The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business—and as such complies with the following regulations governing the transferring of credit:\n\nCourses from an AACSB-Accredited Institution\n\nStudents may transfer a maximum of 80 SH of credit. A combination of 60 SH of nonbusiness courses and/or 28 SH of business courses will be accepted; 64 SH may be applied as credits toward the total semester hours required for degree conferral.\n\nCourses from a Non–AACSB-Accredited Institution\n\nStudents may transfer a maximum of 60 SH of credit. A combination of 52 SH of nonbusiness courses and/or 20 SH of business courses will be accepted.\n\nSome courses are not eligible for transfer. Check with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for more details.\n\nGraduation Requirements\n\nThe D'Amore-McKim School of Business reserves the right to amend programs, courses, and degree requirements to fulfill its educational responsibility to respond to relevant changes in the field.\n\nBachelor of Science degree candidates must complete all prescribed work of the curriculum in which they seek to qualify.
