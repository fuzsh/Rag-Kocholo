        "text": "Market Size & Trends\n\nThe global customer relationship management market size was valued at USD 65.59 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a significant compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% from 2024 to 2030. Ongoing trends such as hyper-personalization of customer service, use of AI and automation, and implementation of robust social media customer service can help reduce costs, increase response times, improve customer satisfaction, and increase the adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) platforms across industries are the major factors that drive the market growth.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact businesses significantly, suppressing profitability, stifling innovation, and drying up cash flows and financial reserves. However, the growing adoption of digital technology & CRM tools is likely to set the pace for digital transformation and digital optimization of both existing businesses and new businesses. Moreover, the functions and processes of the business are supported by CRM tools in marketing, sales and customer service. These developments are expected to lead to the increased use of cloud technology and work collaboration tools, subsequently aiding in market growth.\n\nOrganizational departments such as sales & marketing and customer services & support are increasingly integrating customer relationship management systems with AI to improve customer experience and feedback and develop strong bonds with their customers. For instance, in April 2022, Salesforce, Inc., a cloud-based software company, launched CRM analytics, with new capabilities such as AI-powered insights for sales, marketing, and service teams for every industry, such as BFSI, retail, and IT & telecom, among others.\n\nThe search insights within the CRM analytics help Salesforce customers to discover any dataset, dashboard, and next-best groupings related to their search. These developments in CRM solutions and services would likely boost the growth of the market. Customers' increasing use of digital channels to communicate with brands and organizations is anticipated to drive customer relationship management industry growth over the forecast period. According to recent SoftClouds surveys, around 80% of organizations use CRM systems for sales reporting and process automation.\n\nIt provides a better understanding of buying behavior and preferences, allowing brands and organizations to implement the best CRM strategies and deliver real-time performance. For instance, in December 2022, Freshworks Inc., a cloud-based software solution for all sizes of businesses, offered Freshdesk Omnichannel and Freshchat to Supara, a leading apparel company, to accelerate e-commerce sales with better response times to customer queries. These initiatives would further drive the growth of the market during the forecast period.\n\nWith the growing importance of understanding customer behavior and their preferences, organizations are adopting CRM strategies to deliver the best performance in real-time and stay ahead of their rivals. Rapid shifts in the fields of business intelligence and embedded analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, and their implementation in CRM solutions are likely to promote product enhancement and innovation among customer relationship management vendors.\n\nFor instance, in June 2021, Salesforce.com, Inc. announced new capabilities across digital 360 to help enterprises to boost their digital activities and deliver the next generation of digital experiences, commerce, and marketing. These capabilities and features provided by customer relationship management suites supplement the growth of the customer relationship management industry over the forecast period.\n\nLarge corporations have already made significant investments in their respective IT infrastructures. However, due to budget constraints, Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) have been unable to invest aggressively in setting up IT infrastructure. Futuristic customer relationship management suites also enable enterprises to gauge business performance and track sales trajectories.\n\nThe continued digital transformation across various industries is prompting businesses to replace the existing array of solutions required to create, manage, and enhance their digital presence with a unified solution that can serve all purposes. These benefits offered by CRM suites would further drive the customer relationship management market during the forecast period.\n\nMarket Concentration & Characteristics\n\nThe growth of the customer relationship management market is high, and the growth’s pace is accelerating. The customer relationship management market is characterized by a high degree of innovation owing to the considerable advancements in omnichannel marketing, customer data management solutions, and big data analytics, among others. Further, the proliferation of cloud platforms and diverse CRM solutions presented by market players is anticipated to create robust opportunities for the CRM market growth.\n\nCompanies operating in the customer relationship management market emphasize acquisition of niche market players to expand their business operations and customer base. For instance, in November 2023, real estate marketplace company Zilllow Group, Inc. signed an agreement for the acquisition of Follow Up Boss, a CRM platform for real estate stakeholders, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe market is also subject to numerous rules and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023, among others. Market players are required to abide by these rules in the countries where they are applicable.\n\nThere are several direct substitutes for customer relationship management solutions. Various technologically advanced platforms offer the same CRM features as traditional CRM solutions that can pose a threat to CRM systems.\n\nCustomer relationship management market growth is anticipated to be influenced by the concentration of end-users. The growing demand for customizable CRM solutions to address the specific needs of the end-users may create hurdles for emerging CRM companies that are making considerable efforts to establish their brand image in the global customer relationship management market.\n\nSolution Insights\n\nThe customer service segment dominated the market in 2022 and accounted for a revenue share of 23.7%. The key driving factors for the growth of the market include the growing importance of understanding customer behavior and their preferences, rising demand for CRM software and encouraging brands & organizations to continue to adopt CRM strategies to deliver the best service performance in real time. Additionally, the growing use of digital channels using artificial intelligence and its applications by customers to engage with brands and organizations is expected to boost growth during the forecast period.\n\nThe CRM analytics segment is anticipated to grow at a significant CAGR of 13.7% and is expected to register promising growth over the forecast period. The availability of multiple platforms and increasing adoption for integration of analytics features in CRM solutions benefit companies to derive rich insights from business data is expected to drive the growth of the segment.\n\nFor instance, in July 2021, Genesys, a CRM company that sells customer experience and call center technology to mid- and large-sized businesses, launched new CRM tools to enable swift innovation for AI-driven customer experiences, which include bot development and orchestration, open messaging Application Programming Interface (API), and employee development and feedback, deployed across multiple channels.

With this collaboration, governments can improve their online presence by redesigning their websites and apps and ensuring personalized content. These benefits offered by cloud deployment would further drive the segment during the forecast period.\n\nThe on-premise segment is anticipated to expand at a significant CAGR of 10.5% during the forecast period. According to a CRM buyer survey conducted by SelectHub, several larger enterprise groups have preferred on-premise as compared to cloud-based deployment. Due to the increasing demand for data privacy, the demand for on-premise customer relationship management solutions has increased. Furthermore, the on-premise model is still the first choice by the largest organizations in the world, as they have business-critical information to be stored on their servers for enhanced data protection. These benefits offered by on-premise deployment would further drive the segment during the forecast period.\n\nEnterprise Size Insights\n\nThe large enterprises segment accounted for the largest market share of 61.1% in 2022. With the presence of various operational departments in large organizations, customer relationship management software is utilized to help integrate customer data with business process management features and enable users to coordinate with their customer support processes, sales, and marketing, which drive the company’s overall performance. Large Enterprises are particularly seeking CRM software that incorporates artificial intelligence and analytics as part of the efforts to increase workforce efficiency and reduce manual work through automation. These capabilities would further drive the demand for CRM solutions across large enterprises during the forecast period.\n\nThe small & medium enterprises segment is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 15.5% during the forecast period. The segment's expansion can be attributed to the global adoption of a number of government initiatives via digital campaigns such as social media video marketing and search engine marketing. However, due to budget constraints, SMBs have been unable to invest aggressively in establishing IT infrastructure. At this point, cloud-based SaaS can especially assist SMBs in ensuring easy deployment and flexibility while providing a better user experience, which will drive demand for customer relationship management solutions across small businesses during the forecast period.\n\nEnd Use Insights\n\nThe retail segment accounted for the largest market share of 23.5% in 2022. The growing online shopping platforms and mobile applications are offering huge customer data to retail companies. These retail companies are shifting towards CRM software and solutions to understand business growth, market trends, and experience. Furthermore, the increasing focus on digital marketing activities and customized advanced IT solutions drive the market’s growth over the forecast period. These developments in the retail segment are expected to drive the market’s growth over the forecast period. Customer relationship management in the hotel industry, hospitality industry, and travel industry is also gaining popularity. The hospitality business thrives on customer feedback and the primary advantage of CRM in the hospitality industry is its ability to streamline customer service.\n\nThe IT & telecom segment is expected to expand at a significant CAGR of 15.6% during the forecast period. Customer relationship management solutions in IT & telecom offer brand equity, distribution channels, post-purchase service, and customer exclusivity and support. These benefits allow organizations to continue their business to sustain in this competitive market. Moreover, the unabated growth in the penetration rate of IT technologies in organizational operations has set new parameters for competitors in the marketplace. Digital experiences inculcated and offered by the companies would increase operational productivity and enhance customer engagement in the long run.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nThe North American regional market dominated the market in 2022 and accounted for a market share of 43.6%. The key driving factors are the increasing adoption of customer relationship management solutions by several enterprises across the region that rely on the use of advanced technologies and are expected to dominate the market over the forecast period.
