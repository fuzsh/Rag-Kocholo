        "text": "1. Features and Components\n\nOracle Policy Modeling is a Windows desktop application for transforming legislation and policy documents into executable business rules. Rules are written in Microsoft Word and Excel documents using phrases in languages such as English, Chinese and French.[1] These rule documents can be shared amongst business and information technology stakeholders, and commentary can be added into the documents without affecting the structure of the rules themselves. Other features of Oracle Policy Modeling include integrated test case execution and debugging capabilities, and the definition of interviews for interactive rule-based assessments. Interview screen order and branching logic can be defined using visual flow diagrams.\n\nThe Oracle Policy Automation run-time comprises three technologies:\n\nOPA Web Determinations: An interview application that uses screens, rules and flows defined in Oracle Policy Modeling to deliver Internet- and intranet-based interactive assessments. Data entered is used in combination with backward chaining to determine which screens need to be shown to the user in order to reach a decision.\n\nOPA Determinations Server: A WS-I Basic Profile compliant SOAP-based web service that exposes decision-making endpoints for deployed policy models. By passing data to OPA Determinations Server, and receiving responses in return, enterprises can integrate rule-based decision-making with other applications and BPM solutions. Examples include Oracle's Siebel, or BPEL-orchestrated business processes. If insufficient data is provided to reach a decision, Oracle Determinations Server is able to explain what additional data may be required.\n\nOPA Determinations Engine: The engine used by both OPA Web Determinations and OPA Determinations Server, it is also available as a native Java and .NET API. OPA Determinations Engine provides both full forward chaining and backward chaining capabilities, as well as low-level access to the interview engine.\n\nBoth OPA Web Determinations and OPA Determinations Server are supported on a wide variety of application servers, including Oracle WebLogic Server, Microsoft IIS, IBM WebSphere AS and Apache Tomcat.\n\nConnectors for enterprise applications such as Oracle's Siebel and SAP are also available.\n\n2. Versions\n\nThe product now known as Oracle Policy Automation has been sold under several different names, including Haley Office Rules and RuleBurst.\n\nRuleBurst 7.0 was the successor to STATUTE Expert.[2] Although customers of STATUTE Expert were able to upgrade to the later versions, RuleBurst 7.0 was the first version of the product that has become known as Oracle Policy Automation today.[3]\n\nOracle has released several versions of Oracle Policy Automation (OPA) since it was acquired:\n\nProduct Version Released Comments 10.0 December 2009 ( )[4] A major release with significant enhancements for both policy modeling and deployment.[5] 10.1 March 2010 ( ) Update release with several minor enhancements, including ability to build and continue in the rule debugger while retaining session data.[5] 10.1.1 April 2011 ( ) Maintenance release.

Applications and Academic Interest\n\nThe Oracle Policy Automation software has been publicly deployed within several government web-sites. Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship uses it for visitors to check their eligibility for visas.[60] The UK Revenue and Customs agency uses it for their Employment Status Indicator assessment tool;[61] the UK government's old online portal for businesses also used OPA for over 60 interactive tools,[62] while the United States IRS uses the software for guidance on tax law.[63]\n\nOracle Policy Modeling's controlled natural language approach to rule authoring has been the subject of some research.[64] The product was also used to help establish the viability of the Legal Knowledge Interchange Format[65] standard developed by the Estrella Project[66][67]\n\n4.
