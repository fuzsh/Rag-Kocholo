        "text": "To connect your Oracle NetSuite account to Gaviti, follow these steps:\n\nQ: What data will Gaviti have access to after connecting with Oracle NetSuite?\n\nA: Gaviti will have access to accounts receivable information and financial summary information.\n\nQ: What should I do if I encounter problems connecting my Oracle NetSuite account with Gaviti?\n\nA: You can first reach out to us through the chat option on your Gaviti account for assistance. Alternatively, you can email us at [email protected].\n\nQ: How are subsidiaries handled in Gaviti?â€‹\n\nA: Gaviti maintains a 1 to 1 relationship between an entity/subsidiary and a Gaviti unit. The linking process will result in the data of each individual entity/subsidiary being synchronized to a separate and distinct Gaviti unit.\n\nIn order for a client to get the full picture of a company that owns multiple legal entities, its customers will need to go through a separate linking process for each legal entity that exists in the accounting package."
