Oracle implemented organizational restructuring and a self-service culture that led to unintended consequences. The restructuring standardized divisions globally but caused competitive divisions and loss of staff. The self-service culture encouraged independence but weakened rapport among employees. This created challenges for the project coordinator who had responsibility without authority, while the project manager helped identify problems and improve performance despite limitations.",
