        "text": "Oracle has acquired French data integration software company Sunopsis for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nSunopsis’ products are used to pull data from different sources, such as databases and ERP applications, into one location where it can be used for data analysis and other tasks.\n\nOracle plans to incorporate Sunopsis’ technology in its own Fusion Middleware, making it better at integrating data that resides in non-Oracle products, the company said. It’s an area where Oracle competes with IBM and SAP, among others."
