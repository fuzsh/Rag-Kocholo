        "text": "You have to get to the end of Passeig de Gràcia, specifically to the Jardinets de Gràcia, to locate the Casa Fuster, another building of this iconic Barcelona promenade that conquers at first sight. Like the rest of its neighbors, Casa Fuster is of modernist style. After a few years acting as a home for prominent personalities, such as the Fuster-Fabra family and, later, the poet Salvador Espriu, in 2004 it was converted into a luxury hotel. Let’s learn more about the interesting history of this building.\n\nThe Fuster House was designed by the architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner, one of the greatest exponents of Catalan modernist architecture. He also designed the Palau de la Música Catalana, the Recinte Modernista de Sant Pau, and the Casa Lleó i Morera, all located in Barcelona. It was built between 1908 and 1911, commissioned by the Mallorcan painter and industrialist Mariano Fuster.\n\nThe building stands out for the use of white marble for the façade, as well as other exclusive materials such as slate. It was actually designed as a gift from Fuster to his wife Consol Fabra y Puig, hence the initials C.F. on one of the side facades, in clear reference to the lucky owner.\n\nThose who are familiar with the work of Domènech i Montaner may be able to identify common elements in the Casa Fuster with the rest of his creations, such as the floral ornamentation or the three-lobed arched windows. The attic has a Frenchified air that fits perfectly into the ensemble, while on the first floor is the historic Café Vienés.\n\nThe Café Vienés was a meeting place for intellectuals of the time, such as Salvador Espriu, to whom, by the way, the park located in the vicinity of the Casa Fuster is dedicated. It remained open for several decades until it closed. Fortunately, a few years ago this mythical café dedicated to social gatherings reopened its doors after a thorough renovation, as part of the Hotel Casa Fuster, so the essence of that famous space is still intact. Today, diners can enjoy a wide selection of coffees, teas and cocktails to the sound of a piano.\n\nSince 2004, as noted above, the Hotel Casa Fuster occupies this modernist building that ends the Passeig de Gràcia and the Eixample district. At the time, in fact, the Casa Fuster came to be considered the most expensive property in Barcelona, especially for the exquisiteness and high quality of the materials used in its construction."
