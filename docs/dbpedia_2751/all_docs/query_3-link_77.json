        "text": "Following my recent trip to Catalunya I revisited Barcelona a city I love, not least for it’s amazing Modernisme architecture. As I like to mix a bit of travel, history and reading on my blog, this post represents an eclectic mix of all three. I’d like to acquaint you with some amazing architecture coupled with chocolate (thought that last bit might grab your attention!). As I’m ostensibly a book blogger, I’ve accompanied the piece with a tasty little chocolate flavoured reading list.\n\nOn Barcelona’s elegant Passeig de Gràcia, in the Eixample district, you’ll find what is commonly referred to as the ‘Block of Discord’ (or Illa de la Discòrdia in its native Catalan). This block includes three iconic buildings designed by Barcelona’s three leading Modernisme architects. They are Casa Lleó Morera by Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Casa Batlló by perhaps the most well known of the three (outside of Barcelona) namely Antoni Gaudí.\n\nThe Modernisme style in Barcelona (Modernismo in Spanish) was a reaction to the prevailing style of the 19th century and flourished largely between 1890 – 1910. It was a movement that emerged across many countries in Europe at roughly the same time. Though not identical in style, it can broadly be exemplified by it’s fluid lines and curves, which took its inspiration from natural forms and structures. In the UK we would recognise the style as Art Nouveau (adopting it’s French name). The aforementioned ‘Block’ serves as an example of how the style, while reflecting the fluid lines and natural forms, can be interpreted to produce wildly different buildings.\n\nBut before we look at more detail at my chosen subject, the Casa Amtller, here’s a bit of background to how the area grew up.\n\nThe Passeig de Gràcia and the Eixample District\n\nThe Passeig de Gràcia was originally a semi rural pathway, surrounded by gardens and known as the Camí de Jesús after the 15th Century Franciscan convent of Santa Maria de Jesús. This was located somewhere between the current Gran Via and opposite the site of Casa Batlló. It continued beyond this point as the Cami de Gràcia leading as it did, to the outlying town of Gràcia to the north. The convent fell victim to the Napoleonic Wars and was demolished in 1813, which allowed for the consideration of improving the area.\n\nThe liberal municipal authorities made plans to undertake an urbanisation project and commissioned military engineer Ramon Plana to undertake the work c.1820-1823. Unfortunately a series of epidemics that befell Barcelona prevented the start of any work. The project was picked up by José Bernaldo de Quirósin (the General Marquis of Campo Sagrado). By 1827 the new avenue was a wide (138ft) tree lined space used largely by the aristocracy to display their horse riding skills and show off their expensive horse-drawn carriaged. The lack of general public use, was due to it still falling outwith the city walls.\n\nThings began to change in the 1840’s when the avenue gardens were opened up. This was a revelation to the inhabitants of the old town, used to the densely populated, dark, narrow streets. The gardens became a source of entertainment with seating, refreshments and fairground rides, the most well known was probably the Camps Elisis which boasted its own roller coaster.\n\nIn 1855 Barcelona’s adjuntament city council authorised the demolition of the medieval city walls that had been hampering the growth of the city. Four years later they held a competition for plans to enable the major expansion of the city. The competition to oversee this expansion (Eixample in Catalan) was won by Ildefons Cerdà and permission was granted for work to star in 1860. His design comprised a strict, grid like pattern of long straight streets crossed by wide avenues, with square blocks and unusual chamfered corners. This latter feature made for improved traffic visibility at intersections and increased sunlight and ventilation. Cerdà’s dream was to see a mixed society, but tweaks to his plan saw less green space, narrower streets and an influx of higher class residents.\n\nThe Passeig de Gràcia saw buildings built on either of the avenue that reflected this new model. However some of these buildings began to change shape again at the turn of the century and the buildings we acknowledge as reflecting the best of Barcelona’s Modernisme architecture are attributed to this period. The ‘Disaster’ of 1898 saw the end of the Spanish-American War with the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. While this signalled the end of access to protected markets, it is also said to have seen wealthy Catalan industrialists start to move their investments back from the colonies into Spain. It also coincided with a growing sense of isolation from central government and a movement towards promoting the Catalan identity. The growing Modernisme movement offered them the opportunity to show Barcelona, Spain and the world something uniquely Catalan.\n\nThe Passeig de Gràcia was the place to be in this period and Barcelona’s wealthy families commissioned the best architects and craftsmen in town to build them. While this undoubtedly created a ‘competition’ between the architects it was a competition fuelled equally by the families themselves. Casa Amtller was the first of these buildings to grace the Block of Discord.\n\nCasa Amatller, 41 Passeig de Gràcia\n\nThe first building on the this site was Casa Martorell built in 1875 by Antoni Robert. It was a three-storey, neoclassical style building in keeping with the Cerdà plan. When the building was bought in 1898 by chocolate manufacturer Antoni Amatller i Costa, he wanted the property remodelling and sought out the services of architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch.\n\nJosep Puig i Cadafalch, while perhaps not the most well known of the three great Modernisme architects, was by far the most prolific. Born in 1867 in Mataró, he studied architecture in Barcelona. The majority of what are seen as his most attractive buildings fall within the Modernisme period.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1924 he was President of the Mancomunitat of Catalonia (regional government). He went into exile during the Spanish Civil War as he found it problematic working under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. When he returned to Barcelona in 1942, the Franco regime banned him from working as an architect. He died in 1956.\n\nThe original building had essentially been a block of flats. Puig i Cadafalch was tasked with making the building a residence for the Amatller family, giving it the appearance of a single gothic palace. To this end, the facade was demolished and rebuilt with a range of colours and decorative iconography. In Catalan the word Amatller means almond tree, and there are numerous references to the family name, these include the flowering almond tree branches twisted into capital A’s and the gargoyles in the shape of an A. In direct contradiction of Cerdà’s plan, and flying in the face of the classic rules of symmetry and regularity he also created a stepped Flemish style gable roof which surpassed the 22 metre height limit. The work which began in 1898 was completed in 1900. It is perhaps a shame that it’s next door neighbour a few years later was to be the extravagent Gaudi creation Casa Battló which has probably overshadowed this incredible building.\n\nChocolate Amatller\n\nChocolate Amatller was founded in Barcelona in 1797 and it’s considered one of the oldest chocolate makers in Europe.\n\nAntoni Amatller i Costa (1851-1910), son of Antoni Amatller Ràfols, was the successor of the Chocolates Amatller factory. At the age of 19, recently married, his father and uncle sent him on a training trip abroad, where he visited the main Swiss and French chocolate factories so that he could prepare to take over the business. In 1878, he built a new factory in Sant Martí de Porvençals with the most modern German and French machinery. He incorporated advertising techniques into the company to expand its market. He was a photographer-traveller who toured Morocco (1903), Istanbul (1905) and Egypt (1909) taking photographs, as well as participating in international amateur photography competitions. He was also an important collector of archaeological glass, which today is kept in Casa Amatller.\n\n(Image and information taken from https://casessingulars.com/en/las-casas/casa-museo-amatller/)\n\nThe Amatller family were great patrons of the arts and the original art, from which the packaging has been developed, is still on show at Casa Amatller in Barcelona.
