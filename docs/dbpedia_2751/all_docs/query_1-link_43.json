        "text": "This is one of three houses in this fashionable block designed by a prominent Modernista architect, the other two being Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Casa Batlló by Gaudí. But each of the houses is in a very different style, giving rise to the punning term Mançana de la Discòrdia, meaning \"apple of discord\" (mançana is the Catalan word for both \"apple\" and \"block\"). Whereas the other two houses are in the middle of the block, this large house is situated on a corner. These three houses were all essentially remodelling jobs with alterations to existing buildings. But in subsequent years Casa Morera was changed yet again. In 1943 much of the facade and interior on the ground floor and mezzanine were \"remodelled\" (some say mutilated), with the ground floor arches and sculpture removed; recently, yet another remodelling effort has attempted to restore some of the original Modernista design."
