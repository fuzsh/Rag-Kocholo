        "text": "2023 marks the centenary of one of the most influential Catalan architects of all time, Lluís Domènech i Montaner. His legacy endures as an indelible mark that encompasses a new, identity-based and national architectural style that forever changed the appearance of Barcelona. Until December 31st, the Domènech i Montaner Route allows you to enjoy a 50% discount on visits to some of his most important works.\n\nDomènech i Montaner was much more than an architect; He was a prominent Catalan politician and a key figure of Catalan Modernism. Born in Barcelona on December 27th, 1849, he established himself as one of the leading representatives of this movement. His was a lasting impact with two magnificent works declared World Heritage Sites: The Palau de la Música Catalana and The Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau.\n\nJoin us on a fascinating tour that begins in Barcelona but extends through places such as Canet de Mar, Reus, Comillas, L’Espluga de Francolí, Palma, Olot and Tarragona. Discover the life and work of a visionary whose influence spread throughout Spain, on a journey that reveals the cultural and architectural wealth of this genius of Modernism.\n\nArchitectural romance with Barcelona\n\nThis Catalan genius left an indelible mark through his outstanding contribution to Barcelona. Among his most notable works, you will find the Castell dels Tres Dragons (1887-1888), originally conceived as a café-restaurant for the Universal Exhibition of 1888, and the Hotel España (1902-1903), which stands out for its dining rooms decorated by the painter Ramon Casas and the sculptor Eusebi Arnau, and which today houses the renowned Fonda España restaurant.\n\nCasa Lleó i Morera (1905) is another gem that will impress you with its floral style and exquisite interior decoration. It is known for being a ‘Palau de la Música on a family scale’ so recommend a visit before a concert organized in the ‘mother house’, perhaps, the piano concert by András Schiff 9th February 2024 and a version of Rinaldo by Händel 6th February 2024 are a great choice.\n\nIn the heart of the city, you will also find the ‘Editorial Montaner i Simón’, now the home of the Antoni Tàpies Foundation; ‘The Casa Lamadrid’, with its impressive floral sculptural elements; ‘The Palau Montaner,’ which houses the Delegation of Madrid Government; ‘The Thomas House’, with a façade full of neo-Gothic symbols; and ‘Casa Fuster’, a collaboration between the architect and his son Pere.\n\nCanet de Mar, a treasure trove of Catalan Modernism\n\nThe coastal town is home to an extraordinary concentration of architectural works. Domènech i Montaner’s roots in Canet de Mar date back to the 17th century, evidenced by the documentation of his maternal family and his relationship with the Roura family. The Lluís Domènech i Montaner House Museum, in the old Rocosa farmhouse, is witness to the architect’s deep connection to this place.\n\nDon’t hesitate to visit the ‘Ateneu de Canet’, with its plant shapes and artisanal elements, and the Casa Roura, a summer residence inspired by the medieval age. The majestic Castell de Santa Florentina is not to be missed, especially its impressive crypt. Other notable spaces include the warehouse and offices of the Fàbrica Jover, Serra i Cia, which stand out for their functional architecture.\n\nThe route culminates with the Domènech House, a comprehensive renovation of the family home, which has a Gothic gallery and openings decorated with floral ceramics. Finally, you can go to the pantheons of the municipal cemetery to appreciate the tombstone designed for his son.\n\nTake full advantage of your visit and walk along the two kilometers of Canet beach and then eat great rice with lobster while enjoying views of the sea.\n\nFrom Reus to Tarragona passing through L’Espluga de Francolí\n\nDomènech i Montaner established lasting friendships in Reus, where friends commissioned him to build their homes. A highlight is ‘Casa Navàs’, built between 1901 and 1908, one of the few modernist residences in Europe that has survived intact to this day. Another point of interest is the ‘Mansana de la Discòrdia’, where the ‘Casa Rull’ and ‘The Casa Gasull’ are notable.\n\nThe Pere Mata Institute, built between 1898 and 1922, is another monumental complex that demands a visit. It served as a precedent for the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona. Dedicated to the care of the mentally ill, it reflects the architect’s concern for the well-being of the sick, even going so far as to camouflage safety elements in the structure. Before you leave, remember to try the local vermouth and the artisan almond-based dessert ‘menjablanc’.\n\nIn the city of Tarragona, where modernist architects such as Josep M. Jujol and Josep M. Pujol de Barberà were born, the Mausoleum of Jaume I (1909) stands out. This work pays tribute to the monarch and through great symbolism, while also referring to the Monestir de Poblet. Very close to this building, in L’Espluga de Francolí, you can also visit the Celler Cooperatiu (1913), which is inspired by Catalan Gothic.\n\nFrom Olot to Palma de Mallorca via Comillas\n\nOlot, the capital of La Garrotxa, famous for its impressive volcanic landscape and as the cradle of the landscape movement of the Olot School, led by Joaquim Vayreda i Vila. Here we recommend making a stop at the Casa Solà Morales, which perfectly fuses the baroque architecture of the 18th century with the modernist elements of the 20th century.\n\nA little further away, in the Balearic city of Palma, you can immerse yourself in the Gran Hotel, considered the first local modernist work. Built between 1901 and 1903, it reflects the architectural plenitude of Domènech, incorporating an innovative façade with medieval elements. Currently, it houses the CaixaForum Palma museum, where there are always fascinating art exhibitions."
