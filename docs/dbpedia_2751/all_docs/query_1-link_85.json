        "text": "Casa Lleó Morera will open its doors again on January 20th after a period of restoration of the building. The Modernist Casa Lleó Morera was designed by architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner, although he died before finishing it and his son Albert Lleó i Morera ended the building in 1905.\n\nThe tour in Casa Lleó Morera will pass through the main floor and the courtyard of the house. The rest of the building is currently rented.\n\nThe visit is a tour of stained glass, mosaics, ceramics, sculpture, wood, marble and sgraffito transporting bourgeois life of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with authentic narrations within the home.\n\nVisits to Casa Lleó Morera must be booked in advance via the Internet. The visits will be in Spanish, English and Catalan and made in groups of 25 people maximum.\n\nCasa Lleó Morera, one of the buildings of the Block of Discord (Manzana de la Discordia)\n\nThe building, located on Passeig de Gràcia 35, is one of three buildings by great modernist architects (Gaudí, Puig, Domenech i Montaner) as part of the Block of Discord (Manzana de la Discordia), next to the Casa Batllo and Casa Ametller.\n\nBlock of Discord is the name given to the group of modernist buildings located between the streets Consell de Cent and Aragon. In this block we find represented the three most important architects of Modernism: Casa Lleó Morera (Lluís Domènech i Montaner), Casa Ametller (Josep Puig i Cadafalch) and Casa Batlló (Antoni Gaudí).\n\nThe name Block of Discord (Manzana de la Discordia; Apple of discord) is due to a comparison with an episode of Greek mythology. It means is still doubt which of the three houses forming the Block of Discord is the most beautiful."
