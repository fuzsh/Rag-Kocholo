        "text": "Lovers of Catalan Modernism are in luck. From now on, and once a month, it is possible to take a combined guided tour of the Casa Lleó Morera and the Museum of Catalan Art Nouveau.\n\nA project initiated by architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner in 1902, Casa Lleó Morera is one of the city's more splendorous and best-preserved Modernist buildings. Located right on the Passeig de Gràcia, the construction was planned as a refurbishment of the residential building Casa Rocamora, originally built in 1864. To carry out the reform the architect sought the collaboration of a number of renowned master builders and craftsmen in order to create an interior that was rich in detail. As a result the stained glass windows, mosaics, ceramics, sculptures, furniture, marble and sgraffiti of Casa Lleó Morera are of particular note. The building forms part of what is locally known as the 'Block of Discord', together with Casa Batlló, Casa Amatller, Casa Mulleras and Casa Bonet.\n\nFor its part the Museu del Modernisme, or Museum of Catalan Art Nouveau, is located in another Modernist building on which work also commenced in 1902, on this occasion by architect Enric Sagnier. Also boasting a privileged location, the building's façade displays some of the most notable characteristics of the Sagnier style, to wit the interplay between light coloured stone and red stucco and the floral ornamentation, among others. In the interior the museum displays a significant collection of the objects and artworks that decorated the interiors of the modernist residences.\n\nThe combined guided tour begins at 5.30 pm at Cara Lleó Morera, from where the group will continue to the Museum of Catalan Art Nouveau.\n\nCombined guided tour to Museu del Modernisme and Casa Lleó Morera\n\nWhen: the 11th of July, the 8th of August, the 19th of September, the 10th of October and more scheduled days\n\nTickets: 17,60 €\n\nWhere: Casa Lleó Morera and Museu del Modernisme"
