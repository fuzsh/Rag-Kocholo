The building is located on the corner of Carrer del Consell de Cent, and is one of the three important buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Discòrdia (\"Block of Discord\"). The building was originally constructed in 1864, and was renovated beginning in 1902.\n\tUnlike many buildings constructed at the time, it was not named after its owner; rather it is named from the lions (lleó) and mulberry trees (morera) motifs in the decorations. Domènech i Montaner worked with sculptor Eusebi Arnau, Antoni Serra i Fiter for the ceramics, Lluís Brú and Mario Maragliano for the mosaics and Gaspar Homar for decoration and furniture to make the complete work. It was the residence of Cuban-Catalan photographer Pau Audouard.\n\tBetween 1899 and 1906, the Arts Building Annual Award (Concurso anual de edificios artísticos) awarded modernist pieces, like the Casa Calvet, the Casa Lleó Morera and the Casa Trinxet.",
