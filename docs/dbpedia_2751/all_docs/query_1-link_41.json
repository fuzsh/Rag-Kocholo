        "text": "The Casa Lleó Morera is a building designed by noted modernisme architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner, located at Passeig de Gràcia 35 in the Eixample district of Barcelona. In 1902 Francesca Morera assigned Lluís Domènech i Montaner to remodel ancient \"casa Rocamora\", built in 1864. She died in 1904, and the building was named after her son, Albert Lleó i Morera. The building is located on the corner of Carrer del Consell de Cent, and is one of the three important buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Discòrdia (\"Block of Discord\"), and it is the only one building of the block awarded Barcelona's town council's Arts Building Annual Award (Concurso anual de edificios artísticos), obtained in 1906. Unfortunately, the building lost some of its most representative elements, such as the tempietto on its top (now restored) and the ground floor and mezzanine's architectural sculpture. The building is also known as the residence of Cuban-Catalan photographer Pau Audouard. In the mid-'80s of the 20th century, architect Òscar Tusquets was commissioned to restore the building. The pinnacles and the tempietto at the top of the structure, severely damaged by machine guns during the Spanish civil war were restored, and the ground floor damage was partially recovered. The building underwent another restoration process in 1992, and was bought by Grupo Núñez y Navarro in 2006, responsible of another restoration operation. Since 2007 the building is part of the Art Nouveau European Route. In April 2012 finished the most recent restoration project, focused on the ground floor. Several elements such as the carriage entrance, several columns and mosaics were recovered."
