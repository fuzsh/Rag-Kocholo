In 1902 Francesca Morera assigned Lluís Domènech i Montaner to remodel ancient &quot;casa Rocamora&quot; built in 1864. She died in 1904, and the building was named after her son, Albert Lleó i Morera. The building is located on the corner of Carrer del Consell de Cent and is one of the three important buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Discòrdia (&quot;Block of Discord&quot;), and it is the only building of the block awarded Barcelona's town council's Arts Building Annual Award (Concurso anual de edificios artísticos), obtained in 1906. The building lost some of its most representative elements, such as the tempietto on its top (now restored) and the ground floor and mezzanine's architectural sculpture. The building is also known as the residence of Cuban-Catalan photographer Pau Audouard.\n\tAdditional information may be obtained at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Lle%c3%b3_Morera\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\"> Wikipedia</a>.",
