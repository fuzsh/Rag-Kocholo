        "text": "If this academic year 2023-2024 you are going to study and live in Barcelona, and you are one of those people who can’t stop for a single day or suffer from FOMO, save this guide we have designed especially for you in your favorites and you won’t miss a single plan, promise!\n\nWhat should you know about Barcelona?\n\nBarcelona is one of the most popular and visited cities in Europe, however, there are always certain facts and curiosities that you should know before coming to study and live here.\n\nIdentity\n\nKnown as the “Ciudad Condal”, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, an open, modern and welcoming city. So much so that, according to the city council census data recorded in January 2023, there are currently 1,660,435 inhabitants in the city from 117 different nationalities, apart from Spanish.\n\nIn Barcelona, as in the rest of Catalonia, two official languages are spoken, catalan, the language of the Catalans, and spanish, the language of the Spanish state.\n\nBarcelona is well known for its modernist legacy, including the works of the architect Antoni Gaudí, such as Casa Milà (popularly known as La Pedrera), Casa Batlló, Park Güell and Sagrada Família. However, strolling through its neighbourhoods you will also find architectural gems from other periods and styles, such as the Barcelona Cathedral or the medieval streets of the El Born or Barri Gòtic neighbourhoods, Plaza España and its famous fountains with staircases, or the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium, built in 1929 for the International Exhibition and later remodelled to host the emblematic Barcelona’92 Olympic Games.\n\nCustoms and traditions\n\nBarcelona and Catalonia celebrate some festivities and traditions typical of Catalan culture, such as:\n\nLa Castanyada: Traditionally in Catalonia instead of Halloween, on October 31, on the eve of Tots Sants, Catalans celebrate La Castanyada. A popular festival of pagan origin in which chestnuts and traditional panellets (a sweet made from almonds, sugar and eggs) are roasted and eaten to remember and commemorate the dead.\n\nSant Jordi: Every 23 April in Catalonia, culture and love are celebrated. A beautiful and romantic festivity in which, guided by a popular legend, lovers give each other books and roses as they stroll through the streets of their city among the stalls of florists and bookshops.\n\nLa Nit de Sant Joan: On the eve of the 23rd to 24th June, coinciding with the summer solstice, all the towns and villages of Catalonia celebrate this festival in which, for one night, fire becomes the star of the show with bonfires and firecrackers that light up the sky until dawn.\n\nLes Festes Majors: Throughout the year, especially in spring and summer, each city or town celebrates its most popular festival, which includes music concerts, children’s activities, popular meals and traditional Catalan shows such as the Correfoc, the Ball de Bastons, the Cercavila dels Gegants or Els Castellers. Barcelona celebrates La Mercè, the city’s main festival, every 24 September, and throughout the year, each neighbourhood celebrates its own Festa Major. So take a look at the annual calendar and stop by one of them, you’ll experience Catalan popular culture first-hand!\n\nComplete guide: What to do in Barcelona?\n\nBarcelona is a cosmopolitan city that enjoys a very good climate and sunny beaches, as well as being one of the cities with the greatest cultural, gastronomic and leisure offer in Europe.
