        "text": "Designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Casa Lleó is one of the three Modernist buildings that make up the Block of Discord (\"Manzana de la Discordia\") on Barcelona's Gràcia Avenue, alongside Casa Batlló and Casa Amatller. Originally constructed in 1864 and renovated in 1902, it may appear less extravagant than its counterparts, but no less opulent when it comes to the richly decorated balconies and facade. The ground floor, altered years ago, has recently been restored to its original beauty and now looks quite impressive.\n\nThe edifice stands out with its distinctive egg-shaped rooftop and intricately ornamented round-shape balcony. Upon closer inspection, one can notice the building's name, \"Lleó Morera,\" depicted on the facade, which translates to \"lion\" and \"mulberry\" in Catalan. Additionally, there is a depiction of a light bulb and a telephone, symbolizing the latest inventions of the time.\n\nThe first-floor dining room reveals one of Barcelona's most stunning interiors, showcasing stained-glass windows, exquisite woodwork, marble details, complete with the eight ceramic mosaic wall panels depicting idyllic countryside scenes. Together, these elements set Casa Lleó Morera apart from the works of the city's other renowned modernist, Antoni Gaudí. The staircase in the house is also notably unique for European buildings of that period.\n\nCompared to the more popular and besieged by visitors Amatller and Batlló houses, a visit to Lleó Morera offers a comfortably relaxed experience without being dull. Guided tours of the building are available for a fee, making it an excellent choice for passionate modernist enthusiasts and architecture buffs who won't be disappointed by the experience.\n\nLa Rambla Walking Tour\n\nOne of the main streets in central Barcelona, La Rambla is popular with tourists and locals alike.
