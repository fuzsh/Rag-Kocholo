The Christian defeat at the Battle of Hattin was primarily due to strategic errors, internal divisions, and superior Muslim tactics.

The Battle of Hattin, fought in 1187, was a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Christian forces, led by Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, made several strategic errors that contributed to their defeat. One of the most critical mistakes was the decision to march across a waterless plateau in the scorching July heat, leaving the troops dehydrated and exhausted. This decision was made despite the availability of an alternative route that was longer but had access to water sources. The Christian forces were also heavily laden with their armour, further exacerbating their fatigue and reducing their combat effectiveness.

Internal divisions within the Christian camp also played a significant role in their defeat. The Christian forces were a coalition of different factions, each with their own interests and agendas. There was a lack of unity and cohesion, which was exploited by the Muslim forces led by Saladin. The divisions were so deep that some Christian factions even chose to abandon the battle, further weakening the Christian forces.

The superior tactics employed by the Muslim forces under Saladin were another key factor in the Christian defeat. Saladin's forces were highly disciplined and used their knowledge of the local terrain to their advantage. They used a combination of light cavalry and archers to harass and wear down the Christian forces. Saladin also cleverly manipulated the Christian forces into a position where they were surrounded and cut off from their supply lines. This left the Christian forces in a vulnerable position, unable to retreat or receive reinforcements.

In addition, the Muslim forces had a significant numerical advantage. Saladin had managed to gather a large coalition of Muslim states, resulting in an army that significantly outnumbered the Christian forces. This numerical superiority allowed the Muslim forces to surround and overwhelm the Christian forces, leading to their eventual defeat.

In conclusion, the Christian defeat at the Battle of Hattin was a result of a combination of strategic errors, internal divisions, superior Muslim tactics, and numerical superiority. This defeat marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, leading to the eventual loss of Jerusalem to the Muslim forces.
