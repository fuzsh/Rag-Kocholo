        "text": "Hattin Lecture Notes Intro-  Jerusalem center of medieval world- sacred to 3 religions  Ruled by Romans- succeeded by Byzantine- fell to Muslim army who ruled for 460 years  1099 Crusaders took over Jerusalem and became the capital of the Catholic empire  Saladin was a Muslim/Kurdish warlord and politician who welded Egypt and Syria into one  Proclaimed himself the leader of Ajiha  He invaded Jerusalem in 1187 with a massive army- and was met by every man in the kingdom who could bear arms  Crusader and Muslim armies went to war on the horns of Hattin where Saladin defeated the Jerusalem army and reinstated Islam back in Jerusalem First Crusade and the Crusader states  Most famous events of the Middle Ages- also the most misunderstood and misinterpreted  Catholicism exploited the Crusades and used them as an excuse for their actions  Church was the only connection between the three civilizations- only source of shared identity- Popes authority universally accepted  Oldest is the Byzantium empire- ruled Balkans, Italy, Greece, and Anatolia-  Most powerful was the Islam civilization- prophets of Muhammad inspired Muslim people over their successful career of conquest  Muslim conquest reached Europe where they conquered Iberia where they ruled Spain and was one of the highlights of their empire  In 732, Muslim army raided deep into France- defeated eventually in the Northern part of France by Frankish warlord Charles Martel- this halted Muslim expansion beyond Spain  Sicily was also taken by Muslims- used as a base to launch attacks into S. Italy  The assaults upon Europe gave people the idea that Muslims were unhinged, violent, dangerous people  Byzantine was hit the worst by the Muslims- losing all provinces in Middle East and North Africa- took Constantinople twice  In 1071, Byzantium was defeated by Seljuk Turks at Battle of Manzikert. The Turks then overran Anatolia which was the economic and military heart of Byzantium  As this was happening, much of Western Europe was establishing itself and Muslim outposts in Italy were destroyed and Sicily was also taken from Muslim rule  Christians began Reconquista- process of pushing Muslims from Iberia  Byzantines turned to the Christians now for support- asking the Pope to persuade European lords to assist the Byzantine army  Pope Urban II had an idea- pilgrimage to Jerusalem would serve as penance for all sin  Sacred violence- violence against non-Christians is a positive act  Combining the ideas of pilgrimage and sacred violence allowed for the Pope to coerce Christians into fighting in the way  In 1089, he offered penance to the lords who fought to take the Muslim city of Tarragona\n\n In 1095 the Pope ordered the first Crusade at the Council of Clermont in S. France and armed Pilgrims began to set out across Europe to liberate Jerusalem  The speech Urban gave in Clermont was a great example of getting your people involved and willing to fight for their religion- using coercion  Four armies of 60,000 with all groups of Christian society began Crusading to Jerusalem and could not be stopped by the Muslims- defeating them every time  After a long arduous war, they finally reached Jerusalem in 1099 and the crusaders who had just fought returned home having fulfilled their vows  Four European ruled states came about after the crusade, Edessa, Antioch, Tripoli, and Kingdom of Jerusalem- Outremer  Most of these states were minor and did not hold much power- except Jerusalem  Crusaders quickly assimilated with Eastern Christians after big city states such as Syria and Palestine joined Jerusalem  For the most part the Muslims who remained in this area were treated fairly by the Christians, which came as a surprise to most  All of the success of the Crusades, it became popular to want to be a part of them and fight for your country, while eliminating sins at the same time  New culture mixed local cultures along with the Europeans- became known as Franks  Military orders of knight-monks were popping up, with the first being The Temple and The Hospital- who would receive mass amounts of gifts from the Europeans Muslim Warlords and their Armies  There was lots of separation of the Muslim world at this time, which allowed for the Crusades to have success  Abbasids began losing power in 10th century, starting with many of the border cities declaring independence  By 1150 the Caliphates were nothing more than figure heads  The Fatimids were gaining much traction in the area 969 they seized control of Egypt  There was an even more powerful group, the Turks, who were nomads from the Steppes which were vast belts of grasslands that covered Eurasia  The Turks were magnificent warlords who commanded horsemen who could not be matched by anyone  The Abbasids first came upon Turks when they were approaching Eurasia during the age of expansion and were impressed by them  They turned them into Mamelukes who were one of the strongest facets of the Abbasid army- essentially a slave soldier  The Turks after pushing south potentially due to climate change and bad pastures  After 1000, the Turkic tribes were united by the Seljuk family who covered Iran and began moving westward  Tughril Bey- leader of the Seljuk captured Baghdad and the heartlands of Islam were ruled by Turks  They began carving out a massive empire extending from Anatolia to Iran under Sultan Malik Shah I\n\n These Knights were trained from young ages in horsemanship and armed combat- best armed and armoured soldiers in the Middle East  Each Knight had 3 horses and one squire, one more of each if needed  Along with a coat of mail, iron hoes, a helmet, shield and carried a lance for mid-range combat and a variety of swords, maces, knives, etc.  They were used as the cavalry for the army- a small number of well trained  There was 675 people who were ordered to serve in the knights faction by John of Ibelin in 1180  Due to the king of Jerusalem’s power and wealth, he hired mercenary knights and could conscript any Knight not currently at battle to go immediately  Temple and Hospital were the most important factions of knights- due to their skilled fighting abilities and discipline  The Turcopoles were the product of the realization of the effectiveness of the Muslim horse archers  While not as strong as the Muslim counterpart- they provided the crusader army with mobility, tactical flexibility and mounted firepower  Made up half of the army and 4/5 of the cavalry- would protect the knights from flank attacks  The most important Turcopole aspect was to patrol the battlefield and help counter the large numbers of Turkic marauders  Infantry made up the bulk of the army- made up of commoners, they were often in Europe highly un-motivated  Because of so much war, the infantry was well-trained and equipped and highly motivated veterans with years of training were typically what they were  Pretty invaluable to the army- it consisted of archers- who held a slow loading but high- powered crossbow and heavy infantry- carried long spears and shields covered in chainmail armour  The army was highly successful even with their poor numbers and poor terrains for the 12 th century  This success was a cause of the crusaders way of fighting that maximizes strength and minimized their weaknesses  Opposite to the Muslims, they were a slow-moving army that would rely on one big attack to shut down their enemies  To counter the Muslim horse archers who would immobilize their horses to make them stationary, the army would fight in a formation “the fighting march” which allowed for the horses to be protected by the infantry  This technique required much cohesion and coordination to stop the horse archers from reaching their crossbowmen  Waiting for the Muslims to tire, this formation would protect the cavalry just enough to be able to make a big attack after the constant onslaught of the archers Saladin and Jihad:\n\n The disunity of the Muslim world allowed for the successes of the first crusade and the Kingdom of Jerusalem\n\n This disunity among the Muslim states could not last long, as Jerusalem had big plans of invading much of the Muslim world  These many conflicts between city states eventually allowed for a few to grow larger and larger creating city super states  The first example is Imad al-Din Zengi who was a very successful soldier in the Turkic warlord- who gained popularity and the Seljuk Sultan appointed him ruler of Mosul  Following this, Zengi expanded rapidly, taking control over Jazira, Northern Syria and Aleppo  In 1144, Zengi had enough of supporting the Suljik Sultanate and wanted more, so he took the city of Edessa, massacring all the Franks  The fall of Edessa led to a second crusade- led by the King of France and German Emperor  In 1146, Zengi was assassinated, leaving behind his kingdom to his son Nur ad-Din who created the Zengids  This is the beginning of the greatest Muslim warlords campaign, An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, or Saladin  Saladin was a curd, meaning a Muslim from the fringes of their territory  His family the Ayyubids provided officers to the Zengids  A conflict in the 1160’s involving the Fatimid Caliphate, the Zengids and the Kingdom of Jerusalem over control of Egypt  1163 and 1169 marked the period of time where Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh and his nephew Saladin with an army on three expeditions to Egypt, which they successfully annexed  After the death of Shirkuh in 1169, Saladin took over the command of the army and Egypt for himself  From then on, Saladin embarked on a huge journey for expansion of his territory, taking over the Kingdom of Jerusalem  Saladin did not submit to the demands of al-Adin, so he was planning to gauge war upon Saladin until his death before ever making the move- allowing for Saladin to expand into his land faster than he ever thought taking control of Syria and Damascus by 1174  Revealing his further ambitions he expanded Northwards, adding Homs, Aleppo, Mosul and much of the Jazira to the Ayyubid empire  The growing mass of the empire allowed for Saladin to create a massive army  Due to the prominent agricultural benefits of the Nile Delta and position as the terminus of the African gold and Indian Ocean trade, Egypt became rich- which allowed him to equip his army very well  Multiple accesses to troops from his new land allowed for this army to be one of the most formidable  Saladin ruled as a family business- appointing his family as governors. In return they would pay him taxes and supply goods for his army  He was labeling himself the champion of Islam to protect his people against the Christian crusaders- justifying expansion and drawing on a doctrine of a holy war that was far older than crusading\n\nThe Horns of Hattin\n\n As Saladin was growing extensively, the Franks were noticing and Baldwin and Chattion struck against him every chance they got to attempt to halt his growth  Crusader states began to upgrade their defences when they realized Saladin’s offensive could not be stopped  Templars and Hospitallers built some of the greatest castles seen- but could not stop a full invasion by Saladin  The only hope was to travel to Europe in hopes of recruiting military assistance to match Saladin’s forces- but nobody was willing to help  Baldwin IV had died of leprosy and his only heir Baldwin V, died soon after- so Sibylla and her second husband Guy de Lusignan assumed power who was hated by the nobles  Reynald de Chattion was relentless in his attacks against Saladin’s stronghold Kerak, leading a huge force down the Red Sea  Saladin had just began protecting Kerak and by letting the KOJ take control over it he showed weakness  Reynald then attacked a very rich caravan that angered Saladin who demanded Lusignan to back down and he didn’t listen- which prompted Saladin to begin a war against them  By May of 1187, Saladin had gathered an enormous army of 40,000 people that consisted of 12,000 cavalry and 30,000 horse archers and infantry on the Golan Heights  Jerusalem began scrambling to try to field an army that could withstand Saladin’s forces, putting aside differences with the new king they fielded the largest army ever of 1, knights, 4,000 turcopoles and 15,000 infantries  In 1214 French and German forces fought at Bouvine with 1200 knights and 6- thousand foots- but they scraped their countries clean of supplies, money and soldiers in order to do so  The True Cross- which was the most sacred relic is Christendom always accompanied the army  Saladin began marching into Galilei where they were met by a well-placed Christian army that he could not penetrate  He began attempting to lure the Christian army out by sending raiders to devastate all of Galilei and besieged the town of Tiberius  Guy called a war conference and they decided they would keep their army strong in Suffuriyah and to wait until they essentially got tired out waiting themselves  He then discarded the advice of the military counsel and ordered his army to make a push into Tiberias the next day and meet Saladin’s army along the way  They deployed in fighting march formation in three divisions- Vanguard led by Raymond of Tripoli along with local troops from Galilee, King Guy led the central division made up of contingents from the fiefs of Jerusalem, and finally the rear was led by Balian of Ibelin with the troops of the military orders  Saladin also used three divisions immediately realizing the mistakes of King Guy- right wing led by Taqi al-Din, left win under warrior Gokbori, and he led the central division\n\n Crusader armies did not have any source of water, so the troops grew tired very quickly losing strength  As they moved towards the Muslims, they lost speed and numbers very quickly  Guy decided he would wait for the third part of the army that was trailing behind in the small city of Maskana  As time went by without water the Christians grew more dehydrated as the hours went by, it gave them even less opportunity for one winning push  Saladin would attack with horse archers every so often and burned the grass around the Christian camp which made the heat/dehydration worse  July 4th Saladin went for the kill- holding back his askar and sending his horse archers in for a quick attack  The Christian army had just enough energy for the final standoff, and they assembled into fighting formation and went east  Templars and knight brothers made an attempt at a charge when they were caught in a standstill and did make some progress in pushing Saladin’s army back, but it wasn’t long before they were too outnumbered  With the loss of the Templars the cohesion of the army seriously broke down with the three divisions falling on each other  Taqi al-Din allowed for the charging knights to pass through them by opening a gap in his forces  When the army reached Horns, discipline broke down with the infantry retreated up the steep slopes of the horns and refused to help the cavalry abandoning the basin between the two horns  One last desperate effort was made to break through the Muslim army  Tents were set up and behind the cover the knights mounted along with the turcopoles behind him  They began their push, but at this time Saladin had deployed his askar  An account of this battle by Saladin’s son tells us that the Christians made two pushes- both of which drove the Muslim army back slightly, who then pushed the Christians back both times  King Guy’s tent had finally fallen and Saladin’s askar was sent in to clear out the rest of the knights and the infantry were overrun and forced off their positions- fully wiping out their army  Saladin had completely annihilated the Army of Jerusalem killing thousands and taking thousands of slaves\n\nThe Crescendo of Crusading:\n\n Although Hattin was an outstanding
