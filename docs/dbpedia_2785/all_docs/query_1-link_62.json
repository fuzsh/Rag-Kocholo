        "text": "In the fall of 2013 and summer of 2014, a “Battlefield Archaeology” survey was conducted in the fields northeast of Arsuf (medieval Arsur). The main objective of the survey was to find the location of a historical event, dated to 7 September 1191 CE, known as the Battle of Arsuf. Another goal was to understand the historical event in light of archaeological and environmental evidence. Due to the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of the Arsuf hinterland, the archaeological study presented here required looking beyond the boundaries of the conventional archaeological site reconnaissance and basic field-survey and site-detection methods. In this paper, it is argued that the significance of historical events—such as battles, political assassinations and even natural disasters—which are of short durée must be drawn from the structural (i.e., longue durée) and the circumstantial-cyclical (i.e., medium durée) categories. In addition, events can only be fully understood by evaluating their broader perspective, moving from the macro (as represented by the landscape) to the micro (as represented by the specific artefact). In fact, the approach taken by the Annales School has been adopted here and is considered to be a positive avenue to broadening knowledge (Braudel 1980: 6−9, 25−38; 1995: 24−33). This is in contrast to the Positivistic-Historical approach, introduced by the Prussian historian Leopold von Ranke, which attributes great importance to events of revolutionary significance and the roll call of leaders.\n\nEnglish translation of a Dutch paper, original Journal reference: Wijnen, J.A.T., 2015. Conflictarcheologie versus Slagveldarcheologie. Archeobrief volume 19 nr 2. pg. 2-6. Matrijs, Utrecht This paper is based on a discussion paper on conflict archaeology published in the Dutch public periodical 'Archeobrief' in June 2015. My main argument is that it is important for conflict archaeologists to be clear on their intentions: why would we want to archaeologically explore such a thing as conflict? With an intense and politically relevant topic as human conflict, mixing up intentions is undesirable. Therefore, I propose that the current Dutch discussion should focus less on the boundaries of the object of study in the definition of 'conflict archaeology' but more on the archaeologists' ethical starting point. Let us reserve the term 'conflict archaeology' only for work that has the deliberate intention to use the study of the materiality of conflict in an effort to create a world in which there is less warfare, even if this goal is unattainable. The paper was written for the Dutch audience: examples may not always reflect the international status quo in this debate. Also it is important to know that 'critical archaeology is not a prevalent field in archaeological heritage management in the Netherlands and that its theory only plays a minor part in this paper. The original text was slightly adapted and further developed for this translation, as a follow up on the discussions after initial publication."
