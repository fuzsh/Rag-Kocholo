        "text": "As a complaining thumb turns to write sad elegies\n\nThat imitate the lyre in bitter griefs,\n\nI see as things totter, as the upright perish, as falsehood stands,\n\nAs faith lies dead in the world.\n\nPublic injustice has moved the people along with their leaders:\n\nPeople run to swords, leaders to arms.\n\nThe plowshare is shaped into a sword, the pruning knife into a spear,[1]\n\nBulls give their skins to the veteran’s shields.\n\nNow the mother sits bereaved without a child, the child stands alone without a father,\n\nThe bride lies widowed without a husband.\n\nThe merchant does not do business, the rustic does not tend the fields,\n\nKings do not rule their kingdoms.\n\nTherefore I long to tell with succinct brevity what was the cause,\n\nWhat was the order, and who was the author of the new Fall.\n\nAnd you,[2] whom Burgundy bore, whom France nurtured,\n\nWith whose noble ancestors both flourished,\n\nYou, with whom as a prelate the city of Besançon rejoices,\n\nWhose might the city of Acre has known well,\n\nYou, under whose leadership the conquered faith has breathed well\n\nAnd enemies of the faith have succumbed to the perpetual yoke,\n\nWater, I pray, the work of the writer with your dew,\n\nFor indeed this small garden will have to be credited to you.\n\nThus far the famous victress, the holy and powerful land of Syria,\n\nWas prospering under eminent kings,\n\nAnd for some time all Egypt, with Babylon,\n\nHad paid its tribute to Holy Jerusalem\n\nUntil the crimes of the people broke the strength of the Mother.\n\nThe mother who had been free, now groans as a slave.\n\nMoreover, silent envy crept in\n\nAnd a huge misdeed, inclined for all wickedness, burst forth.\n\nFrom the time after the death of the king[3] whom leprosy was attacking\n\nPerfidy and sin appeared:\n\nOf course the sister of the king, Sibylla,[4] the only survivor,\n\nDeprived of her brother, had very recently lost a child.[5]\n\nAnd because there was no male heir in the kingdom,\n\nThe woman succeeded into power by a new law.\n\nBut also, left a widow by her first husband,[6] she had married Guy.[7]\n\nShe conveys the man into the kingdom\n\nAnd, surrounding his head with a red diadem,[8]\n\nShe brings him back a consort of great honor.\n\nFor surely it seemed absurd to spurn the spouse\n\nWhom the Faith had lawfully joined to her.\n\nThis was the original cause of the evil, which moved the world to swords,\n\nConfusing treaties, laws, and the Faith.\n\nThe Gemini were glowing with rays, and the heat of Phoebus\n\nHad moved from Taurus, his host, into new zodiac signs,[9]\n\nFirst, Jerusalem decided to scatter the seeds of fate:[10]\n\nThe seeds are not going to have good fruits.\n\nAfter Guy was made king, Discord stirs up the leaders, as does he[11]\n\nWho had, for some time, been spurred forward by a longing for royal power.\n\nIn this affair, because he had often, wickedly, sighed after the kingdom,\n\nHe was more savage than a dragon with the new successor.\n\nFor he was objecting that the king had intruded into the royal powers\n\nNeither by lawful succession nor, moreover, by his consent.\n\nTherefore, his wickedness clothes him with this cause:\n\nBlaming the king and inciting the magnates.\n\nHe, alone, evilly plots against the kingdom, conspires against all,\n\nCondemns the Faith for his injuries.\n\nWinged with rage, swift with fury,\n\nHe arranges to begin a treaty with destitute, unhappy Damascus.\n\nHe had easily been able to win over the tyrant[12] to himself,\n\nThe tyrant whom he had always known to be the leader of villainy.\n\nThere another Pilate is won over to Herod,\n\nAnd the kisses taste of the wretched Judas.\n\nAnd thenceforth, since pledges had been given, both count and tyrant were protected.\n\nBoth men returned joyful.\n\nBehold, the Damascene[13] calls forth his subjected cities,\n\nA dispatched letter moves armies everywhere,\n\nEvery land conspires against the borders of Syria:\n\nEgypt, Libya, Media, Persia, Arabia,\n\nAnd almost all the region which had suffered the military might of the tyrant\n\nAre compelled to bear his sad yoke. They prepare arms.\n\nThey come together, those whom gifts move, whom gold lures,\n\nOr whom a dream of profit or of righteousness leads.\n\nMeanwhile anxiety was tormenting the count, with the fury of anguish,\n\nAnxiety which the sad work of Faith might have brought about.\n\nAnd tasting beforehand the bad death for his very soul,\n\nHe had now foreseen the results of the plot for himself.\n\nOf course, events show that all the troops of the king of Damascus\n\nHad assembled, together with their leader.\n\nThis affair rattles the mind of the count and he regrets his plunder:\n\nAlas, piety comes too late and the injury is too great!\n\nHe protects the king with plans and he strives to look after the strength of the kingdom.\n\n​ He warns them to prepare arms,\n\nHe divulges all, he teaches what he heard, and reveals the military strength of the tyrant,\n\nAnd he tells everything about his arrangement.\n\nGathered in an assembly, the king takes counsel with all of the leading men\n\nTo determine by what art, what strength, what force they might stop the enemy,\n\nManaging what may be possible then or what should follow thereafter: whether\n\nIt is desirable for the castles to be fortified, or for the countryside to be defended.\n\nPerhaps the Tripolitan might have given useful advice,\n\nBut, as it were, the people are suspicious and they fear this man.\n\nHe would have advised that the villages and countryside be exposed to the enemy,\n\nThat the cities be defended, that the castles garrison men.\n\nSo, unencumbered by this advice, the cohort grumbles, wrongly, but quite confidently,\n\nWanting to run to war, that the enemy may not harry the ancestral land,\n\nLest the enemy should invade all the ends of Syria\n\nAnd lest the Faith should bear, thereafter, everlasting infamy.\n\nWith that advice, the majority of the people withdraw:\n\nAll the troops hasten from the emptied cities.\n\nAnd, as if thoroughly careless of the longed-for triumph,\n\nThey rush toward the enemy and block up the roads.\n\nThe province of Galilee holds the pagan battle lines.\n\nThey place their camp on the near side of the waters of the Jordan.\n\nAfter the enemy acquainted themselves with the nearby tents of the king,\n\nThey strive to hasten their march to that place.[14]\n\nTherefore, simultaneously, the fury of the gentiles flies together,\n\nAnd the barbarian throng spreads out its wings for villainy.\n\nHorrid smoke bursts out from the camp, following the enemy:\n\nThe smoky color shows the Christian natives that the enemy approaches.\n\nWhen the king and the magnates have seen the smoke of the tyrant,\n\nThe scorned royal camp complains loudly at the delay.\n\nAnd, lest the enemy should preempt and overpower the troops,\n\nOr else lest the enemy restrain the men of the Faith with stealthy maneuver,\n\nThe throng raises a royal standard against the hostile crowd;\n\nAnd, leading the way, the throng bore the Vexillum Crucis[15].\n\nThat attack, however, displeases many there.\n\nThe Tripolitan count hates this expedition and urges against it:\n\nThe place on which their camp sat was naturally advantageous to the Christians,\n\nFertile with foliage, supplied with water, flourishing with both.\n\nTherefore the count urges delays and endeavors to guard the river;\n\nBut his labor bears no fruit.\n\nAnd because the people had already burst forward, it is necessary\n\nAnd it is acceptable for this foot-dragger to follow the advancing banners.\n\nIn the first wing, about to feel the tumult of Fate,\n\nStands the legion of the Temple, holding pride of place.\n\nThe rest of the throng rushed forward in confused order,\n\nThe count claims the rear guard and follows the others closely.\n\nThe tyrant does not expose himself to battle any less,\n\nAnd he rouses his men against the Christians.\n\nNow he attacks the mountains with an uproar:\n\nHe bangs the winds with clanging and has rocked the stars with swelling trumpets\n\nThe fields glisten with metal caps, the high mountains shine forth with swords,\n\nThe ground flashes with the helmet.\n\nA powerful diligence was in the enemy, to be sure:\n\nThe cunning man summons his troops and orders a delay.\n\nThus he tries to cut our battle lines off from the waters,\n\nThat thirst and the scarcity of water may harass those cut off.\n\nSuch great prudence was not in our cohort,\n\nWhen it left the river that traverses the arid plains.\n\nWhen the tyrant sees us stand apart from the river,\n\nHe assails and attacks the protruding men with the sword.\n\nYielding, the isolated, faithful troops dash inwardly toward the bank of the river.\n\nThe troops send their hands to arms.\n\nThe order of Templars charges in the front line,\n\nIt sheds the enemy’s blood with the help of cast javelin.\n\nAnd as for those whom the spear of this order does no good when it has been cast,\n\nThe bow and the sword supply an office for them.\n\nA cloud of missiles, sent by the enemy, rises\n\nAnd they fly as if a great pillar of hail.\n\nIt shakes the athletes of the faith and the cohort of Templars.\n\nThe relentless arrow engulfs the pious cohort within.\n\nIf fate were being fair, then this legion, rejoicing,\n\nWould have grandly borne happy triumph and honor from Mars.\n\nBut if you should see so many thousands attack so few, the sight would commend\n\nThe upright in their slaughter as much as the victors in their massacre.\n\nThe cross-bearer, both protector and prior of the Sepulcher, falls.\n\nA barbarous hand lifts up the Cross and takes it away.\n\nWhen the faithful saw the sacred banners taken away,\n\nRight away, fear scattered them everywhere, as if their spirits left them.\n\nThe force of all the nobles of Syria is forced to be trapped together,\n\nAs if surrounded by a certain abyss.\n\nThe solemn victims for Christ make the swords of the gentile people drunk:\n\nGore is strewn into the plains,\n\nAnd besides some people, whom flight freed,\n\nAll either bore violent death, or else earned capture.\n\nModern men wish to call this place, which saw such a vile crime,\n\nBethulia,[16] in the manner of old.\n\nAs history teaches, Holofernes the Babylonian is said to have been struck down here,\n\n“By the hand of a female.”[17]\n\nFortune wounds the orphans of the leaders much less than, moreso, it wounds the Cross;\n\nAnd the public responsibility torments the pious.\n\nThe Antiochene[18] is captured there with the king;\n\nBut, having been captured by the enemy, he bowed his head for execution.\n\nHere, at the same time, fell three thousand of our people.\n\nTwo bishops also lay prostrate.[19]\n\nI shall not recount everyone, whose end and whose luster of martyrdom\n\nCalls forth praises throughout the lands.\n\nThe count felt that flight was protection for himself,\n\nAnd he flies toward Acre, and he enters a fleet and sets out for Tyre.\n\nIf the heavy die of fate were turning itself,\n\nIt was waiting on the outcome of things in the citadel of the city.[20]\n\nAnd perhaps the die would have given the walls and the city to the nimble enemy,\n\nIf Christ the Defender had not been present with them.\n\nInstead, the pilgrim coming from the city of Constantine,\n\nThe marquis,[21] looked after Tyre and its citizens.\n\nThen he allies the citizens of the city to himself, he strengthens the men,\n\nHe promises his help and counsel.\n\nAfter the sad misfortunes, when news of the defeat had been heard,\n\nThe marquis fortified each stronghold of Tyre.\n\nThereafter he strengthens the citadels with his own men.\n\nAnd, mistrusted, the count, received by a ship, departs from the city for Tripoli\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nAll Syria, compelled to bear the yoke, trembles.\n\nFor the conqueror moves himself against the fortresses and cities,\n\nAnd they were able to be captured by fear or, more so, by the sword.\n\nIf Acre had been fortified as before by the men,\n\nIf Jerusalem were not orphaned by her leader,\n\nThen neither place would ever have borne the gentile yoke.\n\nEach would have been safe with her army, high in her towers.\n\nThe enemy easily stormed the gates at this point; and the glory was cheap\n\nWhere there was no need for the sword.[22]\n\nA light force was able to conquer the girly-men of the sex.\n\nOtherwise, what would be praiseworthy in pursuing a toothless mob?\n\nPagan ferocity gave the captives\n\nFree rein for thirty days of peaceful consideration,\n\nThat each man may either ransom a pause for himself, with tribute mediating,\n\nOr else combine hasty exile with gold.\n\nThere are some whose origins guide them back to the land of their birth,\n\nThose to whom shame suggests exile.\n\nThe conqueror invites the happy maniples forward for gifts.\n\nA right hand of giving distributes the acquired wealth:\n\nHe devotes some fortresses and certain cities to his men,\n\nThose whom the fate of the nobles enriches and whom honor decorates.\n\nThe cheerful desire to give transcends the worth of each man,\n\nUntil it rains over and above his many debts.\n\nNor is the conqueror’s prudence mistaken in doing this,\n\nAs thus he urges greedy hands into fierce wars.\n\nBehold, Zion may lament, she who, bereaved mother and world of faith,\n\nSuffers her sons to follow barbarian laws.\n\nWhy did your grace depart? Why did your sense of honor yield?\n\nWhy your liberty? Why your strength, before?\n\nYou have borne the punishments of your Father that we have earned.\n\nYou, once free, lying fallen, conquered!\n\nO Nazareth, you chaste home and bedchamber of modesty,\n\nYou, the daughter, suffer with the mother as a gloomy seat.\n\nYou lie hidden beneath a filthy cultivator, clothed in robes of sadness,\n\nLamenting both your mother’s injuries and your own.[23]\n\nO holy city, to which the famous author Tiberius gave his name,[24]\n\nForgetful of ancient renown, bitter, you groan.[25]\n\nYou, fortunate place, have seen the table of Christ,\n\nWhen five thousand truly felt celestial grace.[26]\n\nYou, Bethlehem, secret wet nurse of Christ,\n\nOnce sanctified with the gore of infants, remain silent.[27]\n\nHerod’s callousness, renewed, shut up your words,[28]\n\nThe Herod who was before a rage against your inhabitants.[29]\n\nSave the holy sepulcher of Father Jerome,[30]\n\nThat a barbarous hand may not, perchance, destroy it!\n\nAcre, you who were once a port of safety for the Faith,\n\nAnd, for a long time, were a calm gadfly for exiles,\n\nAlthough you may sit, suffering, about to watch a swift triumph,\n\nNearly the whole world is going to bring aid to you.[31]\n\nAscalon would have flourished for a long time with full honor,\n\nIf it had not suffered the burden of hunger and thirst.[32]\n\nFate, likewise, exposed the walls of the castle of Mount Peter[33] to the enemy,\n\nNor did its summit do it any good.[34]\n\nIf both friends had not been dead,\n\nThis one would hold the power of the sea and that one the power of the mountain.\n\nShould I not fear the expenditure of material,\n\nI would be able to lament properly the rest of the towns, along with the castles.\n\nBut because I have proposed to cover many things concisely,\n\nI will, therefore, pursue that work with succinctness.\n\nThe heat was milder than is accustomed, because a weaker, toothless Phoebus\n\nWas fleeing the constellation of Leo.\n\nThe sun was giving its rights to autumn\n\nAnd the love of the sun was occupying the features of Virgo, neighboring Libra.[35]\n\nThe enemy’s shrewdness had defended the captured towns with provision, arms, soldiers\n\nAnd, likewise, the captured castles.\n\nAnd all the thirst of the tyrant had not yet been assuaged,\n\nBut, rather, desire for all the kingdom consumes this tyrant\n\nAnd because Tyre alone was waging war for the honor of the kingdom,\n\nHe threatens the city by ship and no less, by horse.\n\nThe mighty tyrant now applies his wings to the walls,\n\nWith a twofold siege, by land and by sea.\n\nBut the protected nature of the place thrives with its characteristic persistence\n\nAnd its partnership of sea and land.\n\nThe wall, which is battered with frequent waves,\n\nSurrounds each side of the city in the manner of a belt\n\nThe wall both dashes the waters of the sound and rebounds the waves of the sea:\n\nThis is no place for ships and oars.\n\nNevertheless, by some art the foreigner carries himself to the gates\n\nAnd the wave both sends out and brings back rafts with its power.\n\nThis celebrated harbor and lovely beach becomes safe from the waves,\n\nWhen the rampart unites with Notus.[36]\n\nYet, this is not an easy approach,\n\nAnd twin towers, rising from the capital into the stars, guard the harbor.\n\nUnless the land were to unclasp this city for the enemy within a narrow space of time,\n\nThe wave would clasp onto the place with a full embrace.\n\nAnd because the ground does not allow the obstructing arms of the sea to come together,\n\nThe builder offers six gates there.\n\nYonder, five heights glitter with just as many fortifications,\n\nWhich hold back the enemy and watch over the place.\n\nThe tyrant occupies these . . . . . with a siege[37]\n\nA machine, fixed to the ground, whirls large stones,\n\nBut he also does not rest from harassing the faithful by ship,\n\nThat our stony precipices may not oppose the rafts.\n\nIn any event, the enemy was not able to storm the harbors\n\nWhile the defending solider maintained his gate in the citadel.\n\nSince the watchman proves useful, as do deception, skill, and strength.\n\nTherefore, Saladin consults the magnates and the leaders of his knights:\n\nIf he returns without praise, shame looms; and if he remains without triumph,\n\nHe will bear eternal dishonor thenceforth.\n\nAs the inconstancy of fickle fate drives off their minds,\n\nAnd while fear and shame vex them,\n\nIn the middle of the magnates a certain leader stands up,[38]\n\nAnd he comforts all with false hope and restrains their fear.\n\nSurely a nocturnal vision had deceived the man\n\nDeluding him with false hope and a weighty dream:\n\nIn his dreams he had seen himself enter the gates of the city\n\nAnd easily approach the fortresses with his rafts,\n\nBut he was a bad interpreter of his own fortune,\n\nSince he does not perceive the sad and evil omen following him.\n\nThus he understands himself to be sole captain of the ship,\n\nHaving embraced a new course into his own ruin.\n\nTherefore the Damascene, deceived by a vain vision,\n\nAppears and invites the rafts forward to arms;\n\nIndeed, he, cherishing foolish dreams to himself, places the man in command of the rafts,\n\nAs if headlong against his own interests.\n\nA certain deserter foretells that intention with the true order\n\nTo the Christians and he reveals the matter to them.\n\nThe marquis, with whose aid Tyre revived its strength in arms -\n\nThose few arms which it had - safeguards the rafts in the city.\n\nThe boat was Tyre’s only helper, therefore an upright pirate, Hugh,[39]\n\nWho was a Galilean, advised they make use of the boat,\n\nOdo was his brother, and Tiberias begot both.\n\nA third younger brother[40] was absent from here and from them.\n\nThese two jump on the waves with a few ships and men\n\nTo expose their heads to the gale,\n\nAnd because the small cohort provides strength to them,\n\nThey stretch out into the deep, that the enemy may not enter into flight.\n\nAfter they have caught sight of the wretched leader who had seen the omen,\n\nThey smash into and leap upon his raft.\n\nFrom there, they seize the leader and strike down his attendants so as to bind the captive;\n\nBut flight frees some of them.\n\nAfter much confusion they seized seven ships,\n\nAnd the rest of the fleet departs for the safety of flight.\n\nThe leader lacked the desired hope, the event unfolds with the expected order reversed,\n\nThe troublesome lot rolls back against his lord:\n\nTruly not free, but bound, he goes off into the city.\n\nConquered, not a conqueror, he sits in the citadel of the tower.\n\nThis downfall wounds the ears and the spirit of the tyrant,\n\nAnd he rends the hair of his head with his hand.\n\nWhile the troops see their master rage,\n\nAnguish goads them on and they fear the man:\n\nThey storm the walls, very violently. Each man tears up the fortifications\n\nFrom the base, beside the gates, with the help of the pick,\n\nAnd with the hooked iron tool they cut out the entrails of the walls,\n\nThe whole cohort safe with covering over them.\n\nAnd although stone may frequently beat the cohort with a blow,\n\nThe cohort prefers violent death with Mars to flight without Mars.\n\nMeanwhile, the victory won was holding the happy Christian nobles in the port\n\nUntil the crisis, once recognized, stirred them.\n\nAfter Hugh the Galilean has learned what happened, he goes off again against the enemy:\n\nHe feels the angry din, he hastens to arms;\n\nBut because the first labor had weakened him afterwards,\n\nThe marquis, fearing injuries to him, advises Hugh against Mars.\n\nNevertheless, Hugh drives back the guards of the gate with a sword\n\nAnd liberates the entrances for himself with the sword’s help.\n\nThat sword still does not seem satisfied until it spills gore\n\nAnd it chases the barbarous spears from the walls.\n\nAlone, he chases away all of the enemies, until shame rouses them\n\nAnd recalls their minds, which desired flight.\n\nThe Galilean is beset there, he bears wounds, which he does not feel.\n\nNor does this passion lead him to suffer spears.\n\nThe other of the brothers approaches to help,\n\nAnd all the Christian throng flows into one, exits the gates, and brings help:\n\nThe throng eliminates the enemy from the gates,\n\nAnd the Galilean recovers his breath, thanks to the assisting hand of his brother.\n\nThen the greatest slaughter comes to pass\n\nBecause the barbarous troops bore the deaths of nearly fifty of their men\n\nAnd we suffered the loss of one man.\n\nWhereupon, in a rage, the wounded leader of villainy prepares to go,\n\nAnd, tested enough, because nothing could be done on land or on sea,\n\nHe then takes counsel from his men: What should he do?\n\nHe orders the king to advance publicly as if for execution\n\nAnd that the man be brought out with the city watching,\n\nAnd, together with the king, the elderly marquis is brought out for execution,[41]\n\nFor ages the child looks at his father.\n\nYet this sight of the condemned does not frighten the city for its leader,\n\nNor does love bend the child for his father.\n\nThus the preconceived hope of the tyrant was fruitless\n\nAnd he sees that he cultivated a destructive shore.\n\nThe execution of the leaders was called off and, turned back,\n\nThe marquis and the king are sent together to Damascus in chains.\n\nTherefore the Damascene is again received by the mountains with many soldiers,\n\nWhile some of the Muslim throng remains outside Tyre.[42]\n\nBecause the route of the sea is not safe here for these remaining troops,\n\nIt is decided that all the rafts be consumed by flames and fire.\n\nHere a battering ram and another machine of war are surrendered to the fires.\n\nIron prows collapse into the ashes.\n\nThis affair carried forth eternal disgrace to the gentiles,\n\nAnd it was the highest glory for our Faith.\n\nAnd you, famous, unconquerable Tyre,\n\nThe guardian of all orphans, the only future, be strong!\n\nYou will redeem the kingdom of Syria\n\nAnd you, a loving mother, will shelter the world’s faithful in your joyful bosom.\n\nHarsh Scorpio, more sluggish than the cold, had followed Libra\n\nAs autumn was premeditating flight,[43]\n\nWhen the swift leader of villainy, with troops gathered from every direction,\n\nPrepares to enter Antiochene fields.\n\nIndeed, noting, in the city’s obedience, many things to come,\n\nHe thus dreads to transport troops into Tripoli,\n\nSince many pilgrims and exiles had recently flowed hither.\n\nThese Christians were fleeing barbarian dominion.\n\nMoreover, this city was fertile, illustrious, and rich,\n\nWith provision, fortification, and many soldiers.\n\nAnd also, wounded Tyre had made a pledge to this city for a treaty:\n\nTyre’s help and its ships were promised.\n\nTherefore Saladin places four neighboring cities,\n\nPreviously under Tripoli’s control and command, on the sea.\n\nBeirut, Biblium, Jibala, and Laodicia,\n\nConquered by fear, are indeed forced to yield to the enemy.[44]\n\nAnd also the city of Tartus proffers itself to him,\n\nAnd its ships preserved the city’s right of liberty.[45]\n\nThus in possession of a vow, having secured those cities,\n\nThe barbarous enemy completes the proposed journey.\n\nHe regards the rest so lightly, citadels which, once upon a time,\n\nThe dutiful love of kings had built for themselves,\n\nAnd which their forefathers had once begot.\n\nSaladin did not remember the former pains, attacking such great fortifications.\n\nYet he did not return without a great slaughter of his own men,\n\nAnd our nobles bore the glory magnificently.\n\nIndeed Antiochene manliness began to sally forth from the gates\n\nAnd their hands attack the enemy with the sword.\n\nThe Antiochenes press back some enemies, who desire to scale the walls with ladders,\n\nAnd they kill many enemies, as the gore witnesses.\n\nAt the same time, this Fortune smiled at our troops,\n\nAnd they do not often bear a light honor of manliness.\n\nThe harshness of the air and the severity of the wintry cold\n\nWere consuming the fields with snow, frost, plague, and ice.\n\nNo less, the heavy air conspires with the city against the enemy:\n\nThus Faith knew that the elements stood by her.\n\nThe enemy had now pressed there for fifty days with a siege of the place,\n\nAnd the long delay does not please him.\n\nTherefore he works to form a peace for himself\n\nAnd, simultaneously, for the city, after common terms were made:\n\nThe citadels, with their fortifications, will be surrendered to the man[46] without Warfare,\n\nIf a year should not bring the aid of reinforcements.[47]\n\nO too much blind Hope, never going to see triumph\n\nAnd not going to have for herself the desired honor!\n\nIndeed, the dreadful lot may in a short time bring forth against the tyrant\n\nSad, evil events leading to his own destruction.\n\nScarcely will the abundant sun complete the whole journey and year\n\nWhen heavy care and labor will recline on the man.\n\nBehold, the inglorious Damascene enters into the enemy’s citadels,\n\nHaving a wound within his such-small heart.\n\nBut yet, he does not wish to unloose pain upon his troops\n\nBecause he may lack Tripoli and the house of Antioch.\n\nNeither this city nor that were robbed of their strength\n\nAnd, with the example of Tyre, they held onto their rights.\n\nRumor of the new Fall flies forth, diffused to peoples throughout the whole world,[48]\n\nPeoples whom the Faith hallows,\n\nAnd, first, it was breaking the waters with a stern toward the Sicilian king,[49]\n\nWho protected his harbors with rich care.\n\nThe harbinger of these tidings moves the Roman Empire,[50]\n\nNor does the letter pass by the honor of Latium.\n\nThe sad epistle perturbs the king of the French,[51]\n\nIt urges that he furnish Syria with the help of his soldiers.\n\nThe diseased state of things convulses the Ocean:\n\nAnguish knocks the English realms forward, as all Flanders also rages.\n\nHow can I recall all the peoples? How can I tell all the regions?\n\nThe worshipers of the cross weep over the new loss.\n\nA pious prelate sent from the city of Albano[52]\n\nCarries out the vast task of his master, the highest prelate,[53]\n\nHe who, revealing the mysteries of the cross to the people,\n\nMarks many and adorns them with the so-famous sign of the cross.\n\nFruitful Gaul, which is a comrade and a daughter to the Faith,\n\nThe first place receiving this father, obeys him.\n\nBut because the English king[54] had recently attacked\n\nThe king of the French and the French-born magnates with arms,\n\nThe displeased prelate endeavors boundlessly to arrange a peace:\n\nHe urges treaties, he chases away warfare.\n\nTo this place, a Tyrian prelate,[55] once he had slipped away from the enemy,\n\nComes in a wavering ship with the help of chance.\n\nThese two pontiffs work to unite the kings\n\nAnd they form a peace between each leader.\n\nAll the glory of the soldiers of the kings and magnates\n\nHad assembled as one at the Castle of Gisors\n\nAnd because love of peace had united all,\n\nEach prelate marks those who are to be hauled overseas for the cross.[56]\n\nWhite-haired in mind, although a boy in years, the first king[57] hastens\n\nTo the sacred signs of the cross, in order to be redolent of his father.[58]\n\nThe English king and his son[59] are marked with the same sign,\n\nThe rest of the army was marked at the same time.\n\nIt is a long delay to write down the men\n\nWhose hearts bore the cross for the praise of the Faith.\n\nLove of the child does not recall the father, nor devotion of the wife the husband:\n\nInstead the common cause moves them.\n\nIt was the middle of the month, to which Mars first fixed his name,\n\nWhereafter it was called March.\n\nNow Aries had rammed forward his head,\n\nAnd it was the next birth of spring out of all the cold of winter,[60]\n\nWhen the Roman ruler[61] comes into the city of Mainz.\n\nAll the halls echo with soldiers.\n\nFor the day long-ago fixed by the king\n\nWas summoning all the leaders of the empire together, with the people following.\n\nCaesar[62] sends relics in to the standards and, first of those present,\n\nHe wished to be marked and to become a companion of the cross.\n\nFollowing Caesar’s great example, the joyful crowd\n\nDeparts with the princeps, carrying the burden of the same sign of the cross.\n\nCaesar makes arrangements: in what time, in what order or form the same expedition\n\nShould exist; what the route should be; or what the day of departure should be.\n\nThe whole time of the plan is delayed for a year,\n\nThat thus the journey may be prepared by the thirteenth month,\n\nSo with the kings the mustered horsemen may pass through\n\nWith the obedience of the whole land; so the crowd of footsoldiers may come ….\n\nThus a fair purpose had composed the kings together,\n\nAnd a common love united them.\n\nIf only the lot should smile upon the undertakings,\n\nAnd happy times come to the titles of the Holy Cross.\n\nWith these things arranged, a letter is accordingly sent from Caesar to Damascus,\n\nTelling the master of crime:\n\n“The [highest] Roman princeps and patron of the faith\n\nDedicates himself to send a few writings to the Damascene.\n\nThus far, mutual commerce between us\n\nWas a pledge of firm peace and of trustworthy love.\n\nThe first injury burst forth from you:\n\nYou dared to enter, to attack, the jurisdiction of the place of the Sepulcher.\n\nYou bore off both the banner and the wood of the Holy Cross\n\nWhen, at the same time, so many men lay dead, killed by the enemy.\n\nMoreover, you toppled the now-subdued cities and conquered castles\n\nWith deceptions, skill, betrayal, and fear.\n\nAnd the king and the venerable patriarch lie captured\n\nAnd the legion of the Temple lies poured out with its leader.\n\nAnd, furthermore, a princeps is killed, a marquis captured, two pontiffs are felled:\n\nGreat is the offense.\n\nTherefore Roman potestas will not bear such crime,\n\nAnd the owed punishment will pursue the crime’s mastermind.\n\nYou, race of destruction, choose whatever you wish for yourselves.\n\nNowhere, neither sea, nor land, nor rampart, will bring help.”\n\nAfter so great a decree was written, the tyrant did not offer\n\nComposed answers via the messenger: stupefaction is born in the enemy.\n\nHe does not wish to expose his sad mind to the legate.\n\nAll the same, he offers gifts to conceal his fear.\n\nBut the count refuses the gifts because he seeks nothing in common with the tyrant,\n\nAnd thereafter he returns and is received by Tyre.\n\nBut the anxiety of grief was tormenting the Sicilian king.\n\nSo that he may augment the fighting power for the Tyrians, he prepares arms:\n\nBesides the assembled horsemen, whom royal grace defends,\n\nWhom love of gold and copper guides,\n\nA certain army had come together, into the Sicilian borders,\n\nWhich competes to enter the ships by the Cross, not pay.\n\nThe surviving strength of Syria, protected with such aid, smiled;\n\nAnd, apart from the yoke, it was free from the enemy.\n\nThe prefixed day was approaching, and Phoebus was pursuing Taurus,\n\nAnd the rite of spring was nourishing April.\n\nNow the journey was driving the people, those who are going to be carried by ship.\n\nThe common people stand together and undertake the route without the king.\n\nThey seek out the ports and the sea by diverse paths.\n\nThey come, mingled: from here the horseman, from there the footman.\n\nSo great a love of faith fires the people\n\nThat everywhere the common crowd breaks off the delay without the kings.\n\nBut because War again arises between the French-born and the English,\n\nWar distracts the kings from their purpose.\n\nAnd Caesar invites counts everywhere through letters describing the task and the route:\n\nThe order of leaders assembles.\n\nAll come to the city of Regensburg, which the Danube nourishes with its broad current.\n\nBehold the established day:\n\nThe light, by which Saint George holds his feast, had given itself to the globe,[63]\n\nBearing abundant joys to the people.\n\nNow the power of the sun was neighbor to the Gemini.\n\nThe heat was very close, so as to burn the Ethiopians now.[64]\n\nSoon afterwards Caesar hastens his journey towards the Hungarians,\n\nAnd he makes himself friend to the kingdoms of the land with the aid of a peace.\n\nAll the soil patiently bears the imperial yoke,\n\nSoil which either love of manliness, or fear of its punishment, motivates.\n\nIndeed, after countless men had gathered together there,\n\nThe fields tremble from a hundred knights on horseback.\n\nThe army bests the phalanxes of Alexander,[65]\n\nNor has the honor of a king flourished with such great soldiers.\n\nAnd neither Julius, chasing Pompey, nor Cato,[66] scouring the scorched fields,\n\nEver led so many thousands.\n\nYet Greece spreads out so many snares for the so-great conqueror,\n\nWhen the story demands,[67] I will tell of it.\n\nMy hand tries to cross over to a greater businesses,\n\nFollowing the affair and the material in just order.\n\nThe king of Syria,[68] lately free from prison and the enemy, presented himself to Tripoli,\n\nHaving been driven from Tyre by an enemy.[69]\n\nAnd also coming here, Geoffrey, Guy’s brother,[70]\n\nWanted to bear help to his brother from the world of the French.\n\nFrom there, the brotherly battle line returns to Tyre,\n\nBut the royal camp sits outside the fortifications and gates.\n\nFor they wait for the surviving people whom the refuge still holds there,\n\nOr those whom France sends to them.\n\nBut although the tents might have been few in number,\n\nNevertheless, Guy and Geoffrey’s force did not hold this place without praise.\n\nFor when the enemy, as luck would have it, rushed upon the men,\n\nThe little army bore solemn honor from that enemy.\n\nThere a certain river is jutted against by those fields,\n\nAn extended mountain, moreover, overlooks the water of the current.\n\nThus the enemy was trapped among us\n\nAnd he did not enjoy the aid of a bridge across the waves, as desired.\n\nMany of the gentile people fall into the waves;\n\nSome perish, submerged, while others fall by the sword.\n\nThe next month, retaining for itself its name and zodiac sign from Augustus,\n\nWas consuming the earth with the fire of Leo:[71]\n\nThe greatest part of the world, flowing through many places,\n\nWas cutting the waters with ships and they were nearly scraping our shores.\n\nBut since Acre had wickedly begun to be closed to our keels,\n\nThe rafts sail toward and put into Tyre.\n\nThe port scarcely takes in ships; and\n\nSince loaded ships were shut out from things, the ships often endured Notus.\n\nMoreover, Tyre does not adequately provision the people, whom it does not take,\n\nAnd it leaves them exposed to Sun and Notus.\n\nThe nobles take counsel with the king,\n\nThey pray that he transfer his troops to Acre.\n\nSpeaking of manliness, the chaste crowd deserves to be heard.\n\nTherefore, the king was very soon swift with their prayers.\n\nAll the troops take the encircling tents away onto the proposed path:\n\nThey leave the pestilential land.\n\nDuring all this, a new discord had arisen through the city:[72]\n\nThe marquis[73] harasses the Pisans and he chases them with the sword.\n\nFor the righteous cohort seeks to follow the king and to abandon the Tyrian walls;\n\nBut the marquis forbids them.\n\nNevertheless, the cohort escapes from the unwilling prince by force, through the gates;\n\nAnd, joining itself to the king, it brings aid to him.\n\nThe fourth day preceding September was at hand:[74]\n\nVirgo had been born, winged Eurus[75] was rippling the waters\n\nWhen the cohort,[76] devoted to war, makes its way,\n\nAs it prepares to surround the city of Ptolemais[77] with a siege.\n\nLest the enemy should suddenly rush upon the summit of the opposing mountain,\n\nOur troops hasten to pursue the position.\n\nThe mountain, stretched out broadly into the plain, rises before them\n\nAnd it furnishes them with a sort of lodging at night.\n\nFirst, however, the whole cohort travels through the narrow pass\n\nAnd is received into the entrances of the high summit.\n\nThen the king, having the higher ground, gives in to sleep.\n\nThe crowd, spread out, rests in the fields.\n\nThe vigilant sentries guard the troops and the camp,\n\nUntil the next day’s light has felt the power of the sun.\n\nThe warmth of Phoebus, clearing away the tears of Dawn,\n\nRouses the king, along with the rest. Guy prepares arms.\n\nThe lines of battle advance in formation; and\n\nAn abundance of oars follow through the sea, as sterns cut the water.\n\nThe faithful assail the city by land and by sea,\n\nOne part guards the sea, the rest secure the ground.\n\nA mountain there, overlooking the defenses and rising from a sort of swelling,\n\nWatches the water located under its summit.\n\nThe king and the leading magnates pitch tents there,\n\nThe rest of the crowd claims a spot by the river.\n\nSome make some shelter with cut trees,\n\nHaving used reeds to serve as a covering.\n\nThe next light dawning invites the nobles to the city,\n\nWho attached barren timbers to the walls.\n\nFrom these they intend to scale the walls,\n\nBut the enemies snatch away the ladders and throw down the men.\n\nIf the hard work of assailing were enough for us,[78]\n\nThe power of the hostile army, captured in the city, would have yielded:\n\nMost of the defenders had been insufficient for this fight\n\nBecause the crowd was unarmed, horsemen rare, the diet weak in the city;\n\nAnd not yet had the barbarian[79] invaded the neighboring mountains with an army,\n\nMoving his barbarian banners from the rear.\n\nThat day was not fair to us\n\nBecause our cohort quit the walls and returned without praise.\n\nIn the meantime, the tyrant attaches his banners to the mountain; and\n\nHe places his camp, filled with the soldiers gathered from every direction.\n\nIt was the fifth day of September, which precedes the Ides,[80]\n\nWhen the enemy army sees our battle lines.\n\nThe next day’s light appears,\n\nThen the joyful enemy attacks our celebrations with War and draws up troops;\n\nAnd, because he had caught the hope of the baseless celebration,\n\nInvading, he rushes upon our army with his own.\n\nSomeone, whom arrogant and foolish pride leads,\n\nRushing on first, falls dead by our sword.\n\nBecause the defenses of the humble wall and crimineus[81] liquid\n\nChase the barbarous standards far away from the camp.\n\nYet somehow they storm the wall, not without danger:\n\nThey seize control of the entrances and cut off flight.\n\nMany, indeed, fall. Many others, whom flight and fate rescue,\n\nLet go of their banners, arms, or horses.\n\nAnd although, considering the lopsided totals, we were few in number,\n\nNevertheless, our men bore few losses.\n\nSo far, the enemy has not conquered anything by the sword.\n\nFrom far-off, they harass us with the bow, but frequent arrows do not help them.\n\nTherefore, they regroup in their mountains without a triumph,\n\nThose for whom that day bore no fruit.\n\nAfterwards, they prevent our men from roaming the fields;\n\nAnd, staying mobile, they trap our men from the rear and hem them in closer.\n\nAnd the iuvenes[82] whom the sea holds, who guard the harbors in ships,\n\nWho put up a blockade to seize supplies,[83]\n\nIn the high parts of the ships they build something like towers joined together by beams:\n\nThe dutiful hand sweats.\n\nBut for all that, the craftsman’s skill profits him nothing,\n\nSince the creator's plan is duped with equal skill.\n\nThe tower to which the fly gives its name[84] hinders that work,\n\nAnd a line rises over the prows of the ships.\n\nIn that place, the caretakers of the Tower of Flies and of the city put out beams\n\nAnd the top juts out from the beams.[85]\n\nBut still, Virtue keeps the busy assembly occupied with enemies,\n\nEither at sea, or else at land;\n\nAnd if Divine Love and Piety had not been protecting us,\n\nWe would have borne losses, and the enemy side honor.\n\nFifty ships, which the Ocean had sent to us over the vast sea,\n\nPulled ashore.\n\nWhile these ships occupied the port,\n\nTwenty-thousand noblemen advance simultaneously and offer assistance.\n\nOver these men, James[86] was prefect, a proven knight and a famous man:\n\nHe was famous for his ancestors, proven by his sword.\n\nThe hero, flourishing with skill, renowned with the soldier, powerful in War,\n\nDid not bring us trivial relief here.\n\nBut because the Marquis was refusing to conform himself properly to the king,\n\nA heavy concern weighs upon the man thereafter.\n\nTherefore the same king sends letters to Tyre;\n\nA letter asks the marquis to want to devote himself to arms.\n\nThe governance of the whole people is promised to him,\n\nIf he should bear forces and aid to the Faith.\n\nAs luck would have it, a cheerful rumor teaches that an eloquent count,\n\nCalled the Landgrave,[87] had lately come to Tyre.\n\nThe happy marquis grows cheerful with the arrival of the count,\n\nHe receives this man, now he pledges his things and himself to him;\n\nIndeed, fellowships of blood were joining them\n\nAnd long-standing love was making these men one in spirit.\n\nFaith, therefore, advises this - a dispatched letter tells this:\n\nThe Marquis is departing, provisioned with arms, a fleet, and men.\n\nThe army receives all these things with happy faces:\n\nThe hope of great joy nourishes the crowd. Error gets on its way.[88]\n\nThen Manliness excites their spirits for battle:\n\nThey fix the time of combat: behold, the day was at hand.\n\nThe care of the common people for the kingdom,\n\nChose two commanders and leaders for their forces:\n\nJames is placed in command of the French,\n\nAnd the Landgrave governs the remaining throngs. The king nurtures his own.\n\nThe marquis is, with help, stronger than all.\n\nHe shows his obedience and his judgment to the whole army.\n\nA fiery comet had recently been seen over the people -\n\nPortending signs and writing the fates[89] to come.\n\nHow many times does this comet show itself to the sight of men?\n\nThis is usually the messenger of an enemy, of famine, or of plague.\n\nEight days [of the month] of October had passed,[90]\n\nScorpio, successor of Libra, was going into the sunrise, gleefully clamping claws,\n\nWhen [stepmotherly][91] Fortune brought outcomes unfavorable for our side,\n\nAs the course of events teaches.\n\nIt was midday and sweltering\n\nAnd, throughout this time, both the sun and the heat were scorching the earth.\n\nThen, all at once, every knight and all the common footmen sally forth from the camp,\n\nSide-by-side, all the men in their proper [formations].\n\nIf our cohort had been restrained by a single leader,\n\nWho would have ruled the uncontrolled bridles of his people,\n\nIf the company of the leading men had been advancing in right formation,\n\nGreat honor would have been taken by us from the enemy.\n\nBut the unbridled people, lacking a master,\n\nWere unjustly, overwhelmingly, overwhelmed by Fate, and were without praise.\n\nThe hostile multitude come, with their front rank bearing down on us,[92]\n\nAnd the barbarian banners show their battle lines.\n\nThe Bedouin, wrapped in white clothing,\n\nCome armed with spears and precede their men.\n\nAfter whom the Parthians arrive, learned at how to harass enemies with arrows\n\nAnd to ride always while sitting backward.\n\nThe other people follow,\n\nWhom India, Media, Libya, or the land of Babylon had sent\n\nWhy am I delaying, muttering on?[93] One can hear the troops sally forth,\n\nThose whom the region to the south or the east rears.\n\nOur side, seeking the first fruits of Mars, assaults the hostile multitudes.\n\nWe bear the first trophies.\n\nAnd now the enemy clothe themselves with the protection of flight\n\nAnd they also return themselves to the mountain and depart, grieving.\n\nBut while it teases us like this, the die of unjust Fortune mocks[94] us more,\n\nIf you note the facts well.\n\nNot yet had the siege taken hold of the city with a full circuit,\n\nInstead, the enemy was still holding onto a passageway.\n\nNow inside, now outside,\n\nThey still went to, or returned from, anyplace their minds called them.\n\nSome of them, therefore, had set up ambushes;\n\nAnd, since the tyrant ordered them to delay, they hid for a long time\n\nSo that, if Mars were wavering and gloomy,[95]\n\nThey would rush against the enemy from the rear and destroy flight.\n\nAfter they saw their men yield,\n\nThey hasten to seek our troops by sallying from the walls.\n\nWhen the enemies noticed that their reinforcements had come,\n\nThey turn about[96], against our leaders.\n\nAnd our nobles, so close to seizing the hostile camp,\n\nGive their backs to flight and refuse to tarry.\n\nThe sword sells them a path through the middle of the enemy,\n\nThose whom strength, chance, or a horse rescued.\n\nMany, however, fell, whom, trapped, the enemy cuts off on both sides,\n\nRestricting their path.\n\nHere the leader or master of the Temple fell earlier,[97]\n\nAn interpreter and proof of his name:\n\nSurely “Gerard” was “bearing Ardean traits”,[98]\n\nSince he was constant in mind, upright in life, feared in War.\n\nAnd bearing the banner, the marshal fell at the hands of the enemy:\n\nHere we bore the losses of both the banner and the man at the same time.\n\nOne may cry out, when mention appears of such a great fall,\n\nBewailing the banners and their leader.\n\nWhile I record the losses of the sacred legion of the Temple\n\nAnd the Fates, so-often wicked for just men,\n\nTears burst from my eyes\n\nBecause this battle line often bore the danger alone, with spilt blood.\n\nTruly, the city of Tiberias tells enough of this:\n\nMartyrdom, tearful loss, sad crime.\n\nBut nor does Bethulia keep quiet its slaughter,[99]\n\nWhere the barbarous mob poured out so many noble men.\n\nOn top of these, the fields of Ptolemais, consecrated with pious dew,[100]\n\nFelt the ultimate stream of Templar blood.\n\nBut I cannot explain the pressures of the burden\n\nWhich the so-sacred order of the Temple so often bore.\n\nHere the leaders fall, whom their own audacity exposed to fate,\n\nAnd their strength did not prevail\n\nThe famous Andrew of Brienne, to whom never flight,\n\nBut always hope and righteousness, was a friend.\n\nHere two young men whom Lotharingia bore\n\nSuccumb to the Fates: Simon was here, Richard there.\n\nIt is indeed anguish to recount the whole, and I will not describe all in detail,\n\nSo many people whom a single day snatched from us simultaneously.\n\nYet we did not suffer iniquitous fates without the slaughter of the enemy side,\n\nAs Rumor teaches well:\n\nNearly two thousand died at the same time, but we do not suffer\n\nThe full burden of slaughter with our own in equal measure.\n\nThe whole vicinity turns red, colored with holy blood,\n\nNearby fields are white with pious corpses.\n\nConfession and martyrdom are formed then,\n\nOne shining with dazzling whiteness and another reddening with gore.\n\nTherefore the double crown of each signifies\n\nLilies and roses for the martyrs, with duty protected.\n\nAfter the space of three days the tyrant commands that the strewn corpses,\n\nScattered through the fields, be collected directly.\n\nThat he would leave nothing behind for our tears,\n\nHe finally adds a sad work of our anguish\n\nThat everywhere, at the same time, those corpses, who are to be seen,\n\nWould be dragged into the river, he orders that the slain be carried by carts.\n\nThe wave of the river is said to have lacked its accustomed course\n\nOn account of the interposing of crowded corpses.\n\nA new course here moves the tyrant to weightier things:\n\nHe thinks that the final Fates answer to him.\n\nIndeed, he began to harass our tents repeatedly, for a long time,\n\nDesiring lucky battles,\n\nThat our men, if, perchance, they should wish to sally forth, would be able to be\n\nCut off and thus utterly pressed by the enemy.\n\nAn edict went forth from the leaders, to prevent anyone from rushing forth hastily\n\nAgainst the enemy or any horseman from withdrawing from the camps,\n\nBut so that first the army would box in the enemy with the constructed fortification\n\nOf a double rampart with the help of this bulwark,\n\nAnd both so that the tyrant would cease to harass our camp so often\n\nAnd so he may not take the camp with his men.\n\nThis cause was, furthermore, driving our cohorts,\n\nThat they would surround the enclosed places with a new rampart.\n\nBehold, Rumor reports that delays are besetting Caesar in Grecian parts.\n\nShe heaps fear upon us.\n\nThe way was not free for Augustus, for all Greece was restricting\n\nHis movements for him.\n\nHence, all the leaders of the troops and the craftsmen\n\nOf the happy expedition struggle to apply themselves to the wall.\n\nNow, with high beams erected, three individual machines are prepared,\n\nHaving the toughness and likeness of a castle,\n\nThat is may overcome the highest citadels of the city.\n\nA heavy wooden tower bursts out from there into the stars.\n\nBut because winter was coming directly, public care\n\nDelayed that work into the time of spring\n\nThus, awaiting at the time spring’s help for themselves,\n\nOur cohort saw the practical wisdom.\n\nThe sixth day proceeding before the Kalends of January\n\nHad returned to the globe, bringing the yearly holidays,\n\nWhen Christ wished to be born to a virgin,\n\nThe ancient word, having a covering of his mother’s flesh,[101]\n\nLeading the way, the Evening Star was crossing the honor of the stars of\n\nPhoebus and the moon was carrying help for the night\n\nThe tyrant hears that nearly forty ships\n\nWere coming into his hands for help and counsel.\n\nHaving been reinforced with this help, he shuts the route through the\n\nNeighboring waters to us, he bribes the sea, he arms the waters.\n\nThus he wholly replenishes the men for the city,\n\nHe strives to fortify the defenses with a fresh army and a new strength.\n\nHe commands that the weak be driven out and that the strong stay,\n\nEncouraging his own with words and by replenishing.\n\nWith equal example and form, our leaders set forth\n\nTo anticipate the hostile forces.\n\nIndeed, it was a sad weight for those that their boats were without passage\n\nOf the sea and that thus those boats lay still.\n\nTherefore the marquis is sent to Tyre,\n\nWhich prepares ships and which furnishes many a fleet for aid.\n\nBut because the stiff winter was hindering the journey and both hostile weather and\n\nThe wind were hindering the sails on the ships,\n\nFor three months we were deprived of the sea,\n\nWithout loss, destruction, hunger, bloodshed, anguish, or thirst.\n\nNo doubt Divine Love and Piety was nurturing their own,\n\nBoth hope and strength were a great abundance to them.\n\nFurthermore, boldness had come into being for us beyond the camp,\n\nAnd they bound far from their camps.\n\nThey began to roam through the fields, to ransack farms and houses,\n\nTo look for firewood, to follow avarices,\n\nAnd the enemy is again permitted to spread out ambushes for us,\n\nWe bore nothing of evil and dishonor;\n\nBut the tyrant bore many setbacks from us\n\nAnd he enters ambushes, which he extends, by duty.\n\nThe fourth day of the month named after Mars arrived,[102]\n\nWhen the marquis strikes the waters with a considerable fleet,\n\nThat he may redeem the delay with manliness and that he may convey\n\nStrength to the faith by his arrival and support.\n\nFor a long time he sells seized harbors to himself;\n\nThe enemy falls back into the walls; the barbarous fleet departs.\n\nNow our ships roam hence, now thence,\n\nThe land and the seas forbid departure to the enemy.\n\nFor the boat defends the gates from the side of the sea, a certain company of footmen\n\nRob away the entrances of the land,\n\nAnd the cavalry legion guards the fortifications of the rampart.\n\nOur army is idle with these three duties.\n\nA temperate place is in the plain, which stands off from the city,\n\nAnd the place borders the village of Cayphas.\n\nHere, certain knights of our side were once going\n\nFor a walk along the beach and the waters of the channel.\n\nSince together they were hauling common profits with them,\n\nThe barbarous mob came forth from their mountains.\n\nThat mob, seeing our nobles rambling through the countryside,\n\nHastens thither and quickens their pace,\n\nNamely that it may be able to suddenly trap the few knights\n\nAnd, lacking assistance, our troop may fall.\n\nOur cohort, having disdained flight, rushes against the enemy first,\n\nWith hope from within curbing the mind.\n\nA crash of arms is heard from the camps; now it calls us forward to swords,\n\nThe shouting invites the leaders to arms.\n\nThe marquis proceeds with the king and, with much of the Landgrave’s army.\n\nThey bring men and help.\n\nIndeed, a long-standing agreement had joined both men,\n\nNow something new had united both men, so I think: steadfast love.\n\nThis was a condition of the renewed treaty between them:\n\nThat the marquis hold Tyre in full peace,\n\nWhile, if a favorable lot should deliver Syria,\n\n[Tyre] will fall to him with Sidon, Beirut, and Jibala;\n\nFurthermore, besides these places the whole country will support this man,\n\nThe country which lies from the borders of Tripoli all the way to Tyre.\n\nThis continuation was standing by common assent,\n\nAnd the matter was very strong because of the fair council of the leading men.\n\nTherefore, seeing our battle lines, the enemy, trying to escape, departs, he shows backs,\n\nHe abandons the fields,\n\nHe hastens the journey to the mountains; but the river leading the way impedes many,\n\nHence the water drowns them and hems them in.\n\nAnd he who does not trust himself to the waters, either is undone, felled by the sword,\n\nOr, captured, submits to iron chains.\n\nIf obstructing night had not come to us, few would have escaped from the place\n\nWhole and without destruction;\n\nAnd our nobles, bearing the palm of Mars,\n\nLost at the same time five and two men.\n\nIt was spring, and Aquillon and Boreas[103] were bringing ships\n\nAnd a most great fleet was splitting the waters of the sea:\n\nThe first boat, coming from the Sicilians regions,\n\nWas a true sign concerning the death of King William.[104]\n\nThis king, the maker of faith and the faithful tiller of peace,\n\nWas bringing many advantages to the Christians.\n\nTherefore the new Rumor of death harasses the faith of man,\n\nWhich allegedly weeps that his guardian had fallen.\n\nBut because an outstanding heir[105] had succeeded him,\n\nWho may care for the advantages of the faith with a like mind,\n\nOur manliness lived a little again when Tancred divided\n\nThe Kingdom of Sicily in half; grief began to depart.\n\nFor since the before-said king already saw that the supreme Fates approached,\n\nHe saw a useful work for his own men:\n\nHe had placed Tancred in command of the Sicilian kingdoms,\n\nAnd all devoted prayers for the same great king.\n\nIt was the time, at which Easter comes so that the faithful celebrate the holy:[106]\n\nPhoebus was driving his horses into April.\n\nAnd now a long delay was weighing down the leaders and the people simultaneously,\n\nBecause they have existed without war for a long time.\n\nTherefore they work to complete the unfinished towers,\n\nThey cover the camp with hides and they place flooring.\n\nThe maker applies his finished citadels to the walls,\n\nA machine follows whirling many stones.\n\nTherefore a repeated messenger is sent from the city to Saladin, the leader,\n\nThat he should show his men\n\nAnd that he should openly expose all the troops in succession, that he should occupy\n\nThe entrances of the rampart, that he should level the ground:\n\nThat unless he should come to help quickly, he will bear the loss of the city\n\nAnd all the men, whom he set up there, will perish in the city.\n\nThe day arrived, on which the middle Ides of April closes all,[107]\n\nThe earth laughs with sprouted plant.\n\nThe tyrant moves the whole camp from the emptied mountains into the plain,\n\nHe deploys his troops, he occupies the fields.\n\nHe hurls repeated assaults at us, that he may keep us out from the rampart,\n\nThat he may thence pursue us far away.\n\nFurthermore, that he may draw our battle lines outside\n\nAnd that thus the undefended machine may bear injury with our men.\n\nAnd, yet, nothing proposed is useful to him,\n\nThe guards of the rampart block him by night and by day,\n\nMoreover, at the same time they harass the walls, they scatter the enemy\n\nWith numerous pebbles, the machine hurls stones.\n\nA short journey is separating the sea from the city,\n\nThe sea and the wave of the channel receive the river there.\n\nThe nobles of Pisa held these places, but when the enemies went out,\n\nThe leaders dashed out from the camps.\n\nThis legion is always unoccupied with arms, the knight, thriving at the point of the sword,\n\nDoes not know leisure, a strong meeting for arms.\n\nThe noble army does not fear to meet the marched-out enemy,\n\nBut rather it compels all to enter into flight together\n\nBecause the die or flight rescued few from wars,\n\nBesides those, whom the river drowns there.\n\nFor indeed outside, the shut-out enemies, seeing the closed doors of the gates,\n\nDid not keep the road.\n\nTruly the fear of the city was great,\n\nLest our mixed-up army would flow together into the city and go within.\n\nThat fear brought the danger straight forward to the hostile side\n\nAnd was the greatest cause of destruction.\n\nThus the clash had cut off all the surviving men from the camp,\n\nThe bare walls are deprived of their defenders.\n\nThis matter excites the spirits in us, and if Night should permit it,\n\nGlory would have been gained by us here.\n\nFor this Fortune would be unexpected,\n\nBecause our cohort was hardly able to be idle from arms.\n\nTherefore, the tools of Mars could not be prepared easily,\n\nWhen night was pressing the day.\n\nTherefore the lot was seductive,\n\nBut this lot, lacking the shown and good end, did not give full joys.\n\nBut however long delayed,\n\nThe victory had redeemed great and perpetual honor for us,\n\nIf the favorable lot were not limited by our vice,\n\nWhich the outcome and the order of the affair sufficiently expose.\n\nDiverse error had led some people astray from us,\n\nWhom crime and love of base profit were moving:\n\nIf I do not report these, the unkind end nevertheless shows them,\n\nAs does the sad result, the harsh plague.\n\nFor although the grace of fortune and the open matter smiled sufficiently\n\nOn the friendly face for the proposals,\n\nAnd also the elements would have promised a triumph to us,\n\nSoothing Air, friendly Sea, joyful Earth.\n\nFurthermore, the city having confessed its stupor as if\n\nNow it would nearly lack the help of a defender,\n\nYou would see that all inside had come into the titles of the faith,\n\nIf we should pursue the work begun.\n\nNow nothing was standing in our way, when Envy and Gold corrupted us,\n\nThese two joined at the same time.\n\nAnd a two-fold cause hence carried off our titles, and the enemy our ruin:\n\nOnce a certain desire, now crime.\n\nThat day, which proceeds the Ides of the month of May,[108]\n\nCarried the sad Fates for the injury of the faith,\n\nAnd if the destructive little matter were grievous,\n\nThen the judgment of the people is permitted, as it was before:\n\nOf course, the greatest cause of the scattered triumph,\n\nWas that erected timbers had joined the walls.\n\nFor the triple machine did not stand against\n\nThe falling towers along the wall for eight and ten days.[109]\n\nAn unquenchable pyre is sent into the camp,\n\nThus the triple machine burns with the three castles.\n\nHere the iron ram is consumed, here ten floors covered with the hides of cows\n\nAre burnt up by fire.\n\nThus the long labor perishes, but useless Hope chills,\n\nThe field of fruit does not favorably return a seed.\n\nFor the ferocity of the wind, as if a protectress of the enemy and of the city,\n\nBlows to warm the pyre for our injury:\n\nThe breeze gave the fires strength and madness to such an extent,\n\nThat the scent of the flame becomes doubled,\n\nAnd because all may be arranged by celestial will,\n\nThe wooden mass is dissolved into fresh ashes,\n\nAnd because the footsoldier-mob had entered those citadels,\n\nThe fiery globe envelops many bodies.\n\nNevertheless, many just escape, whom the lot, fear or fickleness or, rather\n\nCatastrophe had delivered from there.\n\nFor these many have at last exposed the head to debris,\n\nThose to whom the creeping flame was denying a path.\n\nThe greatest free party labors in the flames with a rope,\n\nAnd the rope, leading the way, was the protection for it.\n\nIn the fire, chalices, plates, silver vessels melt,\n\nThe armor, the helmets, the iron mass, flow together.\n\nThis loss moves some, it troubles some not at all,\n\nBut nevertheless the impious motive shocks the pious.\n\nMany attributed this crime to some leaders,\n\nIf only they would bear fitting rewards with their merits!\n\nSo, however, I free from charge all the faithful from the disaster,\n\nWhatever swift Rumor may declare, I myself deny.\n\nLet the Rumor be absent that those signed with the cross or washed in baptism\n\nAre guilty of fraud and of the charged crime!\n\nTherefore do not let that Rumor obscure the manly spirits:\n\nFrom a sad beginning will be an honorable end.\n\nComing from the camp of Saladin, a certain deserter\n\nTeaches us many things about the Roman princeps.\n\nBut because the deserter was seized, either by duty or by prayer or by force,\n\nAnd was guilty of joined treason,\n\nFew showed faith; but, abandoning the camp,\n\nAnother arrives speaking truths of Caesar in order:\n\nIn what order, with what assistance, with what army, what strength\n\nThe imperial honor crosses over from the Greeks,\n\nWith what agreement Greece settled a peace with Caesar,\n\nWith what manliness he would free the paths for himself,\n\nMoreover, with what hostages or what leader\n\nPrudent Caesar prepares to approach the citadels of Antioch\n\nHe had fixed each day for himself and his leaders there,\n\nThat the messenger may return openly.\n\nThus this Rumor revives ruined spirits for us,\n\nAnd a new hope raised the former burden.\n\nNo less, a knight sent by the king of the French and, at the same time,\n\nBy the princeps of the English arrives.\n\nHe greets those primates on the first front,\n\nPrimates among whom he had known that the leaders of the faith were.\n\nThe page, which follows, promises swift men\n\nAnd offers the arrivals of the kings and their assistance,\n\nTo excuse the men, he holds out and offers an explanation,\n\nAbsolving the long delays with reason.\n\nThe final part of the writing, confirms the masters’ minds,\n\nThat honesty and strength may not be torpid in them.\n\nThe French and English world shines with how much peace,\n\nHow much love joins the kings and perseverance decorates them.\n\nThe writings teach what roar of foot soldiers, what glory of horsemen\n\nOr what supply of arms approach.\n\nStirred, the strong army rises to these promises,\n\nAnd the seen letter cheers the leaders.\n\nMoreover, hunger was troubling the enemy in the city,\n\nAnd many with them within were weak.\n\nFor these reasons, therefore, we began to delay the affairs of war,\n\nAnd the care and labor of Mars dies,\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy very frequently displays lights and signs to the tyrant\n\nAnd request reinforcement,\n\nAnd although many a fleet may watch over the harbor,\n\nA frequent ship stealthily exits from the city by night;\n\nThe clandestine ship exits and enters the waters through the estuary,\n\nAnd thus shows the conditions of their city.\n\nWith this help the long hunger and other injuries became known to the tyrant\n\nAnd serious weaknesses became known to him as well,\n\nAnd the barbarian both lures and calms those men with pleasant storytelling\n\nAnd he nurtures his men with vain hope.\n\nTherefore, he often exhibits all the maniples openly\n\nAnd as if he assembles them and presses them to war,\n\nThat, if, perchance, he should be able to wrest us from the wall,\n\nThe barbarous horseman would penetrate inside the camp at the same time,\n\nThat thus the tyrant, giving them passage through the whole enclosure,\n\nMay emancipate the enemies of the city from us.\n\nTherefore he began to harass us frequently along the rampart\n\nAnd he displays his strength everywhere.\n\nThe holy day had arrived, when Christ wished to enlighten\n\nHis disciples with the Holy Spirit.[110]\n\nSome had left the safety of our rampart to roam far away,\n\nBut nevertheless without fear.\n\nYet this rash boldness of the armed men is permitted,\n\nIf I should admit the truth, and it was not controlled.\n\nFor it had chased the hostile banners beyond the accustomed\n\nPassage and past the Latin Tower;\n\nAlthough, in fact, the enemy fell back with trickery,\n\nWishing to thus remove us from our camp.\n\nBut since the cisterns, which then were giving drink to the enemy,\n\nMight have poisoned the waters with felled corpses,\n\nNow our side began to remove itself from the danger\n\nAnd to approach the rampart again with a safe pace.\n\nAnd this affair did not escape notice. Saladin roused to arms\n\nAs if arranging to have a clash of war.\n\nHere he arranges all his lines and he seeks combat:\n\nThe footsoldier throng bears slings, the horseman throng bears arrows,\n\nAnd standing before our nobles in their positions,\n\nAll oppose their whole hearts to the enemy.\n\nFor the strength and manliness of the horsemen took the powerful to advance;\n\nThe throng of the Temple is present, leading the way together:\n\nThat foremost battle line always exposes itself to war\n\nAnd learned to follow the final fates with a few men.\n\nHence the presence of the soldier enlivens us,\n\nA crowd as large as our walls was in the enemy.\n\nThe tyrant was not able to vanquish, and nor was he able to remove,\n\nThose whom the lot raised first with the help of the sword.\n\nThus the pernicious labor lacked effect,\n\nAnd the enemy also returns himself to his camp not without loss.\n\nFor this short Fortune carried off twenty foot soldiers from the enemy,\n\nAs two lay dead from us.\n\nBut I pass over many, whom the sling or the bow struck,\n\nWhom it is clear had recovered after a short time.\n\nAfter these events, departures by the troops are restrained\n\nAnd common care binds all of the leaders with this command,\n\nThat neither the footsoldier throng nor the horseman may roam to and fro,\n\nThe renewed law of the angry people forbids free reins,\n\nUntil the unbound common people, when it is time, with a strong plan,\n\nWill bear free bridles for supremacy.\n\nBut the hostile violence does not rest, for indeed\n\nA diverse care and the resulting fear urges this violence on.\n\nIt had felt the approach of the Roman princeps, from whom he, fearing future injuries,\n\nDoes not know that the emperor has a delay.\n\nOur rest is the greatest cause of labor for him,\n\nAnd our peace nurtures the seed of war in the enemy.\n\nFor because we withdraw more from war,\n\nThe enemy subject themselves to this war, if the place were for them.\n\nAnd although he was never going to feel the honor of the prize,\n\nThe returned barbarian strives to go to the track.\n\nWhen the troops were disposed and the maniples exposed simultaneously,\n\nHe, spread out, comes forth into the field from his camp.\n\nThe thirteenth light, which comes before the Kalends of June,[111]\n\nHappy, was smiling by the service of its sun.\n\nHappy, indeed, for us but, made gloomy, it assisted the tyrant,\n\nAs the following stanza will thoroughly discuss.\n\nDawn, recalling the destruction of cremated Memnon,[112]\n\nWas mourning, with dew wetting the sad cheeks,\n\nWhen Saladin displays all his battle lines in the rising of the sun:\n\nThe crash shakes the fields with a dull roar.\n\nThe footsoldier company, equipped with shields, leads the way, about to feel\n\nThe first clash of war, yet scarcely any are going to return:\n\nThis battle line, protected with the defense of the shield alone, and not with arms,\n\nWas Mars’s first victim.\n\nPreceding, therefore, as if by the bow it were the equal of the wall\n\nIt defends itself and its comrades with this weapon’s help\n\nThe battle line which might have begun to flow into the wall and, at the same time,\n\nMight have passed over all snares, which the soil covers there,\n\nOur footsoldiers rush out, soldiers whom noble manliness arms,\n\nWhom strength protects and ennobles,\n\nThey clear the doors and remove the bolts,\n\nThey tear their enemy from the rampart and cast them down.\n\nAnd wishing to avenge the garrison for their flight,\n\nThe pits impede and hamper the enemy’s flight,\n\nAnd our nobles following then from their rear slay those falling in,\n\nThey mark the fields with gore,\n\nAnd the bow harasses and javelins pursue with countless wounds,\n\nThe surviving enemies, whom flight aids in the meantime,\n\nAnd if all their knights were not giving aid here,\n\nSince they were battering our army with their shields,\n\nAnd if our horseman could have run out from the rampart,\n\nThe full grace of Fortune would have belonged to us, so I reckon.\n\nThe second battle line is following close behind,\n\nThose who wear red caps on their foreheads, using the sling to hurl stones.\n\nBut when they saw the danger of the former disaster,\n\nThese lines fear the sights, the danger, the sinister fates.\n\nAnd now they almost do not dare to commit themselves\n\nTo the rampart following the example of their comrades, who fell before.\n\nAlthough the gentile horseman had abandoned his horses already,\n\nNamely so that they would relieve the footmen with this help,\n\nUntil it predicted for itself the decision of war,\n\nThe reinforcement of horse attacks again, they who were before the foot.\n\nTherefore the tyrant seeing that losses threaten his men,\n\nHas withdrawn and reveals banners that will be moved far away,\n\nHe protects troops from assaults and recalls the willing,\n\nWho fear to suffer the greater and heavier punishment.\n\nHe returns into his camp without praise and without triumph\n\nAnd he orders his fallen corpses to be removed.\n\nHe orders the funeral mound to be heaped up, yet without this commotion,\n\nThat the known proceeding may not cheer the Frankish men.\n\nYet that work did not remain unnoticed, because a certain deserter\n\nRevealed everything with his information.\n\nIndeed, he teaches that thousands of knights died during this misfortune\n\nOf the part of unkind fortune\n\nBesides those, whom the trust in shields leads into swords;\n\nNo one had used these men of horse, rather they had used these men of foot.\n\nIt is known that the tyrant sent out a thousand men here\n\nBut our loss and anguish were light.\n\nAs Rumor reports, we have suffered there no dishonor or injury\n\nAnd we have squandered nothing,\n\nWith a few excepted, who suffered occasional wounds,\n\nWho nevertheless recovered, with the help of God.\n\nIndeed on that night, on which this affair took place, behold, I do not know,\n\nIf a client has been sent by the enemy,\n\nHe shows the enemy about to come again for tomorrow’s time;\n\nBut the thing alarmed us but little.\n\nNevertheless the king and the leaders work to augment the strength of our rampart,\n\nSo that they can have the place more securely:\n\nThey shore up the entrances, so that every horseman may exit through the gates\n\nOf the rampart repeatedly or at least may ward off the enemy.\n\nThe next day’s light rises, by which the deserter had said\n\nThe enemy was going to come again, and yet they have not reappeared.\n\nNo doubt the tyrant had changed his intention,\n\nAs he saw that work was pointless for his forces.\n\nAnd furthermore, their own punishment had betrayed many gentiles\n\nAnd had made the leaders sluggish to arms,\n\nAnd if Rumor does not deceive,\n\nAbout twenty ships were about to come from Babylon.\n\nFor these reasons, Saladin delayed his return,\n\nThat he would thus help the city with strong naval aid\n\nAnd our leaders mostly began to fortify the seas with ships\n\nAnd feared but little.\n\nThey equip fifty boats and emptying just as many vessels they make\n\nThe vessels be exposed through the surface of the channels,\n\nThat the coming hostile fleet may not able to pass over\n\nAnd that it may not bring help to its citizens,\n\nThat the barbarian may send no horsemen or provisions into the city,\n\nOr that no supply may drive away hunger.\n\nThe field swelling with a small hill and the Latin Tower\n\nAnd the middle was provided with a rampart for the enemy,\n\nOf course the barbarian had planned to mark the conditions\n\nOf the city yonder, revealing signals and notes to them.\n\nIt happened that the footsoldier company had exited the gates at the hour\n\nOf the Evening because of the rampart about to be restored.\n\nWhen that Christian company saw the neighboring places which the enemy occupies,\n\nScorning, it directs its step to that place:\n\nIt rushes into adverse parts, it demands the places of the enemy.\n\nThey withdraw, those whom slashing drives and fear impels.\n\nFrom this we suffered stones, which barbarous sling was hurling,\n\nThe mass of which were large through the fields.\n\nThe tyrant had previously equipped footsoldiers with these arms,\n\nThat they would press and scatter our men.\n\nWe have, therefore, thoroughly removed these stones from the enemy\n\nWith flight coming to aid separated enemies.\n\nAnd thus we occupied the brow of this mountain,\n\nUntil dark night approved the way for us.\n\nThat one thing alarms the Damascene,\n\nHe orders his maniples to be armed by the following light,\n\nAnd moreover he commands the countryside to be strewn with pebbles again,\n\nThat he may call the Franks to arms again.\n\nThe sixth day preceding the Nones of June in order came[113]\n\nAnd it was both the time of summer and it was a beginning.\n\nHarsh Phoebus was pressing\n\nIndian and Ethiopian fields with his Libyans more than usual,\n\nAnd however much more sparingly he may burn the remaining regions,\n\nHe had strewn his strength into Syria.\n\nThe enemy, from that cause, had scattered his battle lines into the evening times,\n\nThat labor would not be burdensome to them\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nThe pounding drums of war mark the decision.\n\nThe troop of infantry tests the fields and extended in its order, leading the way,\n\nIt fittingly seizes the route.\n\nBy this fleeing he knew that the wretched brood of men were idle with arms, and\n\nThe common people are accustomed to be unpracticed at war.\n\nAnd when, by chance, they approach the interval of war\n\nWith an unclothed body, only the first tends to suffer dangers.\n\nThis precedes the shields and whirls pebbles with tensed sling\n\nAnd knocks down those as they are about to enter into the rampart.\n\nOf course his knight sends forth those about to hurl and urges footsoldiers\n\nFrom the rear and does not allow the footsoldiers to be wandering.\n\nOur nobles are armed, granting that the next Hesperus[114]\n\nWas approving rest and a delay.\n\nNow, indeed, our footsoldier company had advanced,\n\nSeeing that their enemies held the inner fields,\n\nAnd however small in number, they were nevertheless large in strength,\n\nThe barbarous banners had turned into swift flight.\n\nYou would see that many of the hostile mob had fallen from this first event,\n\nIf you should mark the deeds well.\n\nBut although our side was bearing no peril,\n\nNevertheless, it greatly sustained this work of labor.\n\nFor a certain legion coming through the plains surrounded our maniples\n\nTo come to rescue their own,\n\nAnd this labor was so great, that if we were not able to be firmly\n\nIn place with bent knee,\n\nAnd from bent knee our crowd began to brandish\n\nUnsheathed swords against the adverse throngs.\n\nThe armored horseman precedes, and thus the armored hand\n\nHas removed our footmen from danger.\n\nFor when he saw them nearly yield to destruction,\n\nThe knight offered help with an opposed point.\n\nThe footsoldier company thus escaped and augmented by the help of their knight(s)\n\nRescues the Latin Tower.\n\nGreat was the noise all over through the other places,\n\nThe enemy was harassing our men very frequently with fire.\n\nThey lit the funeral pile on shields, but we saw that nothing was burnt there,\n\nAnd injury had been done nowhere.\n\nAnd if night had not withdrawn the help of the sun, fitting punishment\n\nAnd weighty labor would have poured forth against the enemy.\n\nFor the knight would have torn barbarous tents to pieces,\n\nIf dark night did not forbid the begun journey.\n\nThat lot had seized nearly two thousand from the tyrant;\n\nIt is clear that scarcely seven from us had laid to rest.\n\nThus gentile horseman, wrapped in yellow dressings, perished.\n\nFor this the yellow color had decorated the arms:\n\nThis habit always adorns the friends of Saladin,\n\nWhom the barbarian wishes to be similar to himself in arms.\n\nAnd our battle lines return, they plead against the iniquities\n\nThe swift coming of night and his horses.\n\nAfter these the king stationed the horsemen, who guard the gates,\n\nWho protect the entrances for him by night and by day.\n\nMeanwhile a long famine was tormenting the leaders with the common people in the city:\n\nThe mule or the horse was giving sustenance.\n\nTherefore the leader’s public concern dedicates itself to composing letters\n\nAnd to writing down their weakness to their tyrant.\n\nAnd he commits the composed writings to a sad, dispatched carrier,\n\nPromising golden gifts to the man,\n\nThat thus he may swim and conquer the gales.\n\nThe messenger enters the waters with his body stripped naked.\n\nIt was a difficult way straight forward on land, through enemies,\n\nLest the supply of letters should be vulnerable to them.\n\nFor that reason, the legate enters the channel, he shows his shaved head to the waves,\n\nBearing a load of letters from the city.\n\nAnd divine vengeance did not miss him:\n\nThe wind pushes the swimmer, a wave engulfs him, a gale shakes him.\n\nThe hand refuses its duty of swimming for this man,\n\nFright fetters the exhausted feet, he shouts and prays for help.\n\nThe wretched man shows himself with his own shouting,\n\nAnd his hoarse murmur and weak noise is heard.\n\nOur sailors leap upon and rescue the wretched man from the danger:\n\nThey discover the writings and note the trickery.\n\nMarquis Conrad received both the letters and the man,\n\nBut he nevertheless delayed punishing the guilty.\n\nHe transfers this man to the king first as well as the letters, to be read\n\nBefore the king and his magnates at the same time.\n\nThe packed page, sent to the Damascene and the rest, stands out,\n\nPages whose manner and course were this:\n\n“Caracois,[115] your knight trapped in the city,\n\nSends his obedience to Saladin, according to his ability.\n\nKing of kings, Saladin, I am astonished that your strength is motionless:\n\nTo what has your bright reputation yielded?\n\nWhy has your such great power not awoken, power with whose praise\n\nA fifth crown surrounds your head?\n\nI pray that this power deliver us likewise from prison,\n\nThat it crush the unworthy enemy and press those inferior men.\n\nA very tough famine tortures us;\n\nAnd manliness will not supply five days for your slaves in the city.\n\nI pray that either I may implore swift help, or else we will attempt the road\n\nTo begin the decision of prompt battle.\n\nIndeed, I prefer to die with praise than, conquered, to live repulsively;\n\nOr, a slave, to yield to the enemy.\n\nYet I do not think that life can be rescued from servile law for me,\n\nIf you do not extend the hand.”\n\nThe legation of writing was noted by the leaders:\n\nThis cheering thing strengthens our men for arms.\n\nThe legate suffers capital punishment:\n\nThe severed head is aimed and sent into the city,\n\nThat the corpse may at least bring the city its secrets back,\n\nSecrets which the returning man was going to expose while alive.\n\nYet on account of him there was a split opinion with many,\n\nAnd it was concerning the manner of punishments to be given:\n\nEither to be gutted from the sinews, or to be mutilated from his ears and his nose,\n\nOr to disappear burnt alive on funeral piles,\n\nEither to be bent on a cross, or to be drowned in the waters, it seems right for him,\n\nOr, better, to be deprived sight, tooth, and hand.\n\nThus a useless chunk may be returned to them\n\nAnd thus the wretch may live in the city with torn off members.\n\nEither the severed hand may just be sent into the city,\n\nOr sent bearing with it the letters and all the writings.\n\nThe common people shout that this man ought to die thoroughly,\n\nThat the enacted vengeance may further chastise the guilty survivors.\n\nThus far has my Muse of lament groaned [….]\n\nAnd the mournful Camena[116] has sounded sad measures,\n\nIndeed, the uninterrupted course of events and material has compelled\n\nThe work here sadly to employ sad elegiacs.\n\nNo doubt, they do not follow the history which was sent ahead,\n\nBut nor were they worthy of a lofty pen.\n\nI refuse to add by writing whatever the gentiles or the tyrant have done\n\nIn writings and songs.\n\nI judge that nothing good begins describing the loss of faith,\n\nNor is it proper to tell the perfidious deeds of history.\n\nBut because the end is at hand, both the limit of anguish and glory draw nigh,\n\nI ponder both the thing and the meter to be changed.\n\nNow, therefore, it is pleasant to bring forth the Homerics[117]\n\nOf joyful triumph about to come presently through both rule and meter:\n\nWith which order the kings have proposed to go to the parts of the East\n\nAnd the leaders to cross the water,\n\nWith how much strength Augustus will have subdued the world of the Greeks,\n\nWith what force he has thrown open the road,\n\nWith what good time, with which auspices, with what army Caesar has taken Iconium\n\nIn order to ravage the place,\n\nHow, with a hundred thousand slain, he attacked the city of Antioch here\n\nWithout the destruction of his own.[118]\n\nTherefore, farewell, light elegiacs, cease your laments!\n\nAnd it remains for a grand work to shed light on joyful things.\n\n[Summa tibi laus sit a pravis vituperari, [119]\n\nGrande boni signum displicuisse malis!\n\nNullum suffodias, nullum sub murmure rodas, […………]\n\nNon tua parva tibi nec grandia sint aliena;\n\nSit gratum, quod habes, sufficiensque

The charters attest to Ralph’s presence at Tyre in 1187.\n\n[41] William III, Marquis of Montferrat, father of William Longsword and Conrad of Montferrat. William III had been taken prisoner at Hattin.\n\n[42] Saladin abandoned the siege on January 1, 1188.\n\n[43] Late autumn, though the author seems confused about the timeline. Saladin made some small offensives to the north in late 1187, but his main northern campaign began in June of 1188.\n\n[44] Beirut fell on August 6, 1187, Gabelus on July 16, 1188, and Laodicia on July 23, 1188.\n\n[45] In fact, Saladin attacked Tartus (Tortosa) on July 3, 1188 and spent until July 11 razing many of its buildings and defenses.\n\n[46] i.e. Saladin\n\n[47] The truce between Saladin and Antioch was for the period between October 1188 and May 1189.\n\n[48] See Virgil, Aeneid IV, 173-184.\n\n[49] William II, King of Sicily.\n\n[50] i.e. the Holy Roman Empire\n\n[51] Philip Augustus, King of France.\n\n[52] Henry, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano.\n\n[53] Pope Gregory VIII, who died on December 17, 1187 and was succeeded by Clement III.\n\n[54] Henry II, King of England.\n\n[55] Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre.\n\n[56] King Henry and King Philip took the cross on January 21, 1188.\n\n[57] i.e. Philip Augustus\n\n[58] Louis VII, who participated in the Second Crusade.\n\n[59] Richard Lionheart, Count of Poitou, had already taken the cross.\n\n[60] The court at Mainz assembled on March 27, 1188.\n\n[61] Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n[62] Along with “Augustus,” one of Emperor Frederick’s titles.\n\n[63] April 23, 1189.\n\n[64] A reference to a theory from antiquity about the cause of the dark skin of Africans.\n\n[65] Alexander the Great, ancient King of Macedon, a famous conqueror.\n\n[66] Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Cato the Younger, renowned generals of ancient Rome.\n\n[67] Or, possibly, “When the campaign concludes.”\n\n[68] i.e. King Guy\n\n[69] Conrad of Montferrat had denied Guy entry to Tyre.\n\n[70] Geoffrey of Lusignan.\n\n[71] August of 1189.\n\n[72] i.e. Tyre.\n\n[73] i.e. Conrad of Montferrat.\n\n[74] August 28, 1189.\n\n[75] The East Wind.\n\n[76] i.e. The army under King Guy.\n\n[77] An alternative name for Acre, derived from the name of a nearby ancient settlement.\n\n[78] cf. Virgil, Georgics 1, 145.\n\n[79] i.e. Saladin\n\n[80] September 8, 1189.\n\n[81] Prutz was unsure of this word. Though his transcription appears to be correct, crimineus makes little sense in context.\n\n[82] Literally, \"young men,\" though the word is fraught with interpretative difficulties. See Conor Kostick, The Social Structure of the First Crusade (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 187-212.\n\n[83] Prutz believed fructus to be a corruption, but the sense is obvious: the iuvenes are tasked with stopping the flow of food into Acre.\n\n[84] i.e. The Tower of Flies, which protected Acre's harbor.\n\n[85] It appears that the Christians have already begun to build makeshift siege towers on top of their ships and that the defenders of Acre have responded by shoring up their harbor defenses. This culminated with the Christian naval assault on the Tower of Flies in September 1190: see John D. Hosler, The Siege of Acre, 1189-1191: Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, and the Battle That Decided the Third Crusade (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2018), 79-82.\n\n[86] James of Avesnes.\n\n[87] Ludwig III, Landgrave of Thuringia.\n\n[88] Cf. Matthew of Vendôme, Tobias, I, 104?\n\n[89] Signum may be a play on words: it is both a \"sign\", as in prophecy, and the word for a battle standard. The battle standards are part of the vision that the comet has presented to the Christians. The Latin, fatum can mean fate (in our sense), a prophecy, or death. This is an ominous portent for the Christians.\n\n[90] A mistake for October 4, 1189.\n\n[91] The meter is defective in this passage. Prutz suggests \"mensis\" in line 719, \"noverca\" here, and \"ordine\" in line 726. None of these are necessary for the sense, but they do fit the meter. Fortuna Noverica is a rather imaginative emendation, but I have retained it, since it is a common image in medieval literature.\n\n[92] Cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, II, 476; Lucan, Civil War, VII, 321.\n\n[93] The manuscript only has \"murmans\" here. Murmurans disrupts the meter, but seems to make sense in context.\n\n[94] In the Latin, \"teases\" (ludit) and \"mocks\" (illudit) are a pun. The Die of Fortune has moved on from lighthearted teasing to cruel mockery.\n\n[95] Prutz suggested mobilis (\"fickle\") for nubilus. The line's meter is flawed.\n\n[96] Literally, they turn their \"chests\", pectora, to face the Christian leaders. Since pectora also means their hearts (thus, their spirits), the phrase implies that the Saracens both literally turned around to repel the assault, and rallied their fleeing spirits.\n\n[97] For the section through line 786, Helen Nicholson, “’Martyrum collegio sociandus haberet’: Depictions of the Military Orders’ Martyrs in the Holy Land, 1187–1291,” in Crusading and Warfare in the Middle Ages: Realities and Representations. Essays in Honour of John France, Simon John and Nicholas Morton (eds.) (Farnham: Ashgate, 2014), 111-2.\n\n[98] Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar. The author puns on his name. Gerens is Latin for \"bearing.\" Ardea was an Italian town which, according to ancient Roman legend, was tragically destroyed by Aeneas, in spite of its heroic resistance under the leadership of the warrior Turnus. The sense is that Gerard was brave, strong, and virtuous, but doomed. He is \"interpreter and proof of his name\" because the very name Gerald is fulfilled in his life, as though the name itself were prophesying him.\n\n[99] References, respectively, to heavy Templar losses in battles at Tiberias and Hattin.\n\n[100] In other words, the fields outside Acre were covered in Christian blood.\n\n[101] December 25, 1189.\n\n[102] March 4, 1190.\n\n[103] Two mythological embodiments of North Wind.\n\n[104] King William had died on November 18, 1189.\n\n[105] Since King William died without a child, he was succeeded by Tancred, his illegitimate cousin.\n\n[106] March 25, 1190.\n\n[107] April 13, 1190?\n\n[108] A mistake for May 5, 1190.\n\n[109] Likely a mistake for “eight.”\n\n[110] May 13, 1190.\n\n[111] May 19, 1190.\n\n[112] Memnon was a figure from ancient mythology, the son of the dawn, who fell during the Trojan War.\n\n[113] A mistake for May 26, 1190.\n\n[114] In ancient mythology, the evening star, the embodiment of twilight.\n\n[115] The Western name for Emir Baha al-Din al-Asadi Qara Qush, commander of the Muslim garrison in Acre.\n\n[116] Goddess equated with the Muses.\n\n[117] Dactylic hexameter.\n\n[118] The author’s unawareness of Emperor Frederick’s death betrays that this passage must have been written before August of 1190.\n\n[119] Here the manuscript continues for a further 13 lines, excerpted from a poem on the Four Cardinal Virtues once attributed to Hildebert of Lavardin. See A. B. Scott, \"The Poems of Hildebert of le Mans: A New Examination,\" Medieval and Renaissance Studies 6 (1968): 76. Prutz believed these lines to be completely unrelated to the above Song of the Siege of Acre, but they may prove useful for reconstructing the manuscript tradition."
