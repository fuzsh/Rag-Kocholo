        "text": "The Battle of Hattin (Arabic: معركة حطين‎) took place on 4 July 1187, between the Crusader states of the Levant and the forces of the Ayyubid sultan Salah ad-Din, known in the West as Saladin. It is also known as the Battle of the Horns of Hattin, due to the shape of a nearby extinct volcano.\n\nThe Muslim armies under Saladin captured or killed the vast majority of the Crusader forces, removing their capability to wage war. As a direct result of the battle, Muslims once again became the eminent military power in the Holy Land, re-conquering Jerusalem and most of the other Crusader-held cities. These Christian defeats prompted the Third Crusade, which began two years after the Battle of Hattin.\n\nRelated Suggestions\n\nWhat's the Risk of a Wider Conflict?\n\nEx-Israeli General Warns Country Could Collapse in a Year\n\nOur Duty to Gaza: Seerah's Teachings\n\nThe Rise and Coming Fall of the Israel Lobby\n\nWhy Iran is so Hard to Defeat\n\nNeocons Celebrate Kamala's Foreign Policy Speech\n\nThe Destruction of Madinah and The Greater Israel\n\nProfits Over Peace: How the Global Arms Trade Fuels the Gaza Conflict\n\nExposed: Netanyahu’s Terrifying U.S. War Plan\n\n632 - 2024 CE: The History of the Entire Islamic Civilization\n\n‘Israel Has Committed Genocide In Gaza’ Says Former U.S. Marine\n\nFuture of Islam in America\n\nCOMMENTS DISCLAIMER & RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe opinions expressed herein, through this post or comments, contain positions and viewpoints that are not necessarily those of IslamiCity.
