        "text": "This nation was born in liberty and all men were created equal. The Gettysburg Address written by Abraham Lincoln talks about how the soldiers fought for our freedom and how the ground they are standing on can not be as sacred as they made it during that civil war. Lincoln was sarisfied that the soldiers were to rest on that sacred ground. Lincoln applies repetition, alliteration, and antithesis as a result of expressing and directing to the audience why the world will never escape what those…\n\nIn the midst of the Civil War and in the wake of the bloodiest battle in American history, where nearly 52,000 Americans lost their lives, and just as many lost their will to fight, Abraham Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address to a crowd of 20,000 relatives of the deceased. Only an afterthought following the main eulogy, Lincoln’s address would go onto be the most celebrated speech in American history. From the first words of his address, Lincoln establishes a reverential, formal tone. He…\n\nThe Battle of Trenton was an imperative success to be had for the entire success of the revolutionary war. The battle of Trenton was a great validation for the colonists that the continental army could really defeat the British and Hessians. This was a great militaristic achievement, further showing the brilliance of George Washington and the military leadership of the patriots. This swayed the opinions of some loyalists, further backing the continental army. This support allowed the continental…\n\ncountries and the USSR notably, in particular Germany. A radio broadcast in 1943 describes the consequences Stalingrad had on Germany and how it will be remembered (see appendix 8) The Battle of Stalingrad proved to be the most destructive of the conflict with an estimated one million deaths over the 199 day battle. Nazi forces blamed the Jewish for their loss, worsening the holocaust and causing thousands of executions as said by Hitler, “We shall regain our health by eliminating the Jew”…\n\nShakespeare’s seminal classic Henry V is the culmination of the Henriad tetralogy, and is an allusion to the aphorism that “the pen is mightier than the sword,” for despite being renowned as a warrior king in the Bard’s tale, King Henry fought his battles with the mettle of his rhetoric rather than the metal of his blade. This can be seen in the way in which he utilises orotund oratory to intimidate the citizens of Harfleur into surrendering, but perhaps his most monumental use of magniloquence…\n\nto repel a possible attack by a large infantry advance. While the Maginot Line was successful in the areas it was deployed its largest downfall is that it was static with some gaps in places that eventually would be utilized by the Germans in the Battle of France, thus rendering the Maginot Line ineffective. The Maginot Line would become a glaring monument to Frances’ mind set for a defense strategy of the…\n\nIf someone is loyal, most likely they will stand up for what they believe in. Sometimes it may be a friend or a political belief, but one certainly will not compromise their beliefs id they are truly loyal. In William Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, there are numerous examples of loyalty present. Several different characters are loyal to one another or their country, while other characters are not loyal at all. This may go for Brutus or Cassius, as they often manipulate and betray…\n\nbetween Byrthnōð and the Vikings and stresses that one must remain loyal to their lord in the face of an precarious situation. In this essay, I will discuss the poetic techniques and linguistic choices the poet employs to portray these ideals in The Battle of Maldon. The implication of Danegeld infuriates Byrthnōð as the poet emphatically stresses how Byrthnōð responds to the messenger with the emotive adjectives, yrre…"
