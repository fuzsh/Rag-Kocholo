and\n\n(b) The county electoral divisions shall be arranged with a view to the population of each division being, so nearly as conveniently may be, equal, regard being had to a proper representation both of the rural and urban population, and to the distribution and pursuits of such population, and to the last published census for the time being, and to evidence of any considerable change of population since such census.\n\n(4) At an election for a county, each elector may give in a county electoral division one vote and no more, or in case of an urban district forming one county electoral division and returning more than one councillor, one vote and no more for each of any number of persons not exceeding the number of councillors to be elected for that division, and shall not vote at the same election in more than one county electoral division of the county.\n\n(5) A person shall not be qualified to be elected or to be a councillor for a county, unless he is a local government elector for such county.\n\nAdditional members and chairman and vice-chairman of county council, and constitution of chairman as justice.\n\n3.—(1) The chairman of every rural district council (established under this Act) within the county shall, by virtue of his office, be an additional member of the county council, but if such chairman is otherwise a member, or is disqualified for election as a member, of the county council, the district council may assign one of their number who is not so disqualified to take during the term of office of that chairman the place of the chairman as additional member of the county council.\n\n(2) The county council may choose from persons qualified to be councillors one or two persons who shall be additional councillors during the term of office of the council by whom the choice is made.\n\n(3) The first business of the council after any triennial election shall be the consideration of the question of choosing additional councillors.\n\n(4) The county council may annually choose a chairman, and if they think fit a vice-chairman, from among the councillors, and the chairman, subject as hereafter provided by this Act, shall, during the term of and by virtue of his office, be a justice of the peace for the county, but before acting as such justice he shall, if he has not already done so, take the oaths required by law to be taken by a justice.\n\nPowers of County Councils and County Court.\n\nTransfer to county council of business of grand jury and county at large presentment sessions.\n\n4.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be transferred to the council of each county all the business of the grand jury not excepted by this section, and all the business of the county at large presentment sessions; and the county council for the purpose of such business shall, save that any fiat or other sanction of a judge shall not be required, have the powers and duties of the grand jury and the said presentment sessions in connexion with the said business, and also such further powers and duties as are conferred on them by or in pursuance of this Act, or as may be necessary for conducting, as an administrative body, the business hereby transferred.\n\n(2) Nothing in this Act shall transfer to a county council or a member thereof—\n\n(a) any business relating to bills of indictment or any business of the grand jury at common law relating to crime; or\n\n(b) any business by this Act transferred to the county court; or\n\n(c) any power to appoint a visiting committee for a prison.\n\nTransfer to county court of grand jury business respecting compensation for criminal injuries and amendment of law respecting such compensation.\n\n6 & 7 Will. 4. c. 116.\n\n24 & 25 Vict. c. 97.\n\n6 & 7 Will. 4. c. 116.\n\n14 & 15 Vict. c. 57.\n\n52 & 53 Vict. c. 48.\n\n5.—(1) There shall be transferred to the county court the business of any presentment sessions and grand jury in relation to compensation for criminal injuries, that is to say, compensation under the enactments mentioned in Part One of the First Schedule to this Act, and of those enactments section one hundred and thirty-five and the following sections of the Grand Juries Act, 1836, so far as unrepealed, shall extend to the case of maliciously setting fire to, destroying, or injuring property of any description, whether real, or personal, in like manner as they apply to the setting fire to, injuring, or destroying the particular descriptions of property specified in the first-mentioned section: Provided that this Act shall not extend the application of the said sections to any case except where the malicious act done was a crime punishable on indictment under the Malicious Damage Act, 1861.\n\n(2) Upon an application for such compensation, the county court may either refuse the application, or make a decree against the county council, and, if the decree is made, shall have the power of a judge of assize under section one hundred and forty of the Grand Juries Act, 1836, with respect to the apportionment of the compensation.\n\n(3) Any person claiming compensation in a county may apply to the county court, and the council for the county and the council for the district in or within one mile from the boundary of which county or district the injury is alleged to have been committed, and also any person paying poor rate in that county may, as well as the applicant, appear and be heard by the county court in relation to the application.\n\n(4) Any person or council who appeared, or though not actually appearing was entitled to appear, before the county court in relation to such application, and also, where the area off which the compensation awarded is to be levied is less than the whole county, the council for any county district comprising all or any part of that area, may, if aggrieved by the refusal or decree of the county court, appeal to the judge of assize, and, subject to this Act and to rules of court, the County Courts (Ireland) Acts, 1851 to 1889, shall, except in so far as they require security to be given, apply in like manner as in the case of any other appeal; and the judge may vary the decree in respect of the area off which the compensation is to be levied as well as in respect of other matters.\n\n(5) The judge of assize upon any such appeal shall, in addition to any other power, have power if he thinks fit to empanel a jury to try any issue of fact arising on the appeal, and such jury shall, if any party to the proceedings so requires, be a special jury.\n\n(6) The county court and judge of assize respectively may award costs to or against any party to any proceedings under this section.\n\n(7) Rules of court may regulate the practice and procedure under this section, including costs, and the service of all preliminary notices, and the time within which any proceedings are to be had or taken; and in particular such rules shall provide that non-compliance with any of the rules shall not render any proceedings void unless the court or judge of assize so direct, but the time may be extended and the proceedings may be set aside either wholly or in part, or be amended or otherwise dealt with, in such manner and upon such terms as the court or judge may think just.\n\n(8) Save so far as fees are taken by an existing clerk of the peace for his own use, court fees shall not be payable in any proceedings in the county court under this section.\n\n(9) The enactments mentioned in Part One of the First Schedule to this Act and this section shall extend to the whole of Ireland so far as they do not already so extend.\n\nTransfer to county council of business of boards of guardians as to poor rate, cattle diseases and explosives.\n\n57 & 58 Vict. c. 57.\n\n40 & 41 Vict. c. 68.\n\n38 & 39 Vict. c. 17.\n\n6. There shall be transferred to the council of each county—\n\n(a) the business of the guardians with respect to making, levying, collecting, and recovering the poor rate in so much of the county as is not comprised in an urban county district;\n\n(b) the business of the guardians as local authority under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, and the Destructive Insects Act, 1877; and\n\n(c) the business of the justices in petty sessions under the Explosives Act, 1875, except the power to appoint any officer, which power shall cease.\n\nPowers of county council as to technical instruction.\n\n52 & 53 Vict. c. 76.\n\n54 & 55 Vict. c. 4.\n\n7. The council of a county shall be a local authority within the meaning of the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891; but this section shall not prevent any other local authority under the said Acts from acting concurrently with the county council, if that authority act in accordance with any general scheme framed by the council, or otherwise with the consent of the council:\n\nProvided that—\n\n(a) The rate levied under the said Acts by such authority shall not, when combined with the rate levied thereunder by the county council, exceed the limit thereby authorised; and\n\n(b) Nothing in this section contained shall affect any scheme for technical or manual instruction instituted or made by any local authority before the passing of this Act, or the continued payment after the passing of this Act of any aid in pursuance of such scheme by such authority.\n\nExpenses and determination by county council of main roads.\n\n8.—(1) One half of the expenses of the maintenance of any main road shall be levied off the administrative county, and the other half off the county districts in which the road is situate.\n\n(2) Every road the expense of the maintenance of which at the passing of this Act is levied partly or wholly off the county at large shall be a main road until it ceases so to be as hereinafter provided, and the enactments respecting mail roads shall be repealed.\n\n(3) The council of each county may, upon the report of the county surveyor, make a general declaration declaring what roads in the county shall be main roads, and any road not mentioned in such declaration shall cease to be a main road; and at any time after the end of five years, the council may, if they think fit, reconsider the declaration and make a new declaration, and so on at intervals of not less than five years.\n\n(4) The county council may declare a proposed new road to be a main road, subject to reconsideration at any time at which the council reconsider any general declaration, and the cost of and incidental to the making of such road shall be levied in like manner as its maintenance.\n\n(5) A declaration, whether a general declaration or a declaration respecting a new road, shall at first be a provisional declaration, and shall be communicated by the county council to each district council in the county in the prescribed manner.\n\n(6) After the prescribed time, and after considering any representations which may meantime have been submitted either by any district council or by any person or persons claiming to be interested, the county council shall take the said provisional declaration into consideration, and may adopt the same, either in its original form or after modifying it either by way of exclusion or inclusion of roads.\n\n(7) The declaration, unless suspended as herein-after mentioned, shall come into operation at the date of its final adoption, or any later date specified in the declaration.\n\n(8) The county council shall forthwith communicate a declaration as finally adopted to every district council in the county; and any such district council, if aggrieved by the declaration or by the omission therefrom of any road, may, within the prescribed time, appeal to the Local Government Board, and that Board, after communication with the county council, may dismiss the appeal, or make any declaration which the county council could have made, and that declaration shall operate as a declaration by the council.\n\n(9) In the event of such an appeal, the declaration shall be suspended while the appeal is pending. A county council may also suspend a declaration as regards a portion of an old road situate in any county district, until the council of the district have proposed the expenditure of sufficient money for placing that portion in proper repair and condition to the satisfaction of the county council.\n\n(10) A declaration, suspended while an appeal is pending, which afterwards becomes operative, shall operate as from the date when originally made, or any later date which may be fixed by the Local Government Board on the appeal.\n\n(11) This section shall apply to so much of any main or other road as is situate within an urban county district.\n\n(12) Nothing in this section shall be held to prevent the whole or a greater proportion than one-half off the expenses of the maintenance of any road heretofore leviable wholly off the county at large, or of the expenses of the maintenance or construction of any bridge, from being levied off the county at large.\n\nProvision and management of lunatic asylums.\n\n38 & 39 Vict. c. 67.\n\n9.—(1) It shall be the duty of the council of every county to provide and maintain sufficient accommodation for the lunatic poor in that county in

manner (if any) specified in the order.\n\n(2) The duties of the council under this section shall be exercised through a committee appointed by them, and if the Lord Lieutenant fixes a number of the number so fixed; and out of that committee a number not exceeding one-fourth may be persons not members of the council.\n\n(3) There shall be transferred to the council, acting through that committee, the business of the governors and directors of the asylum under the Lunatic Asylum Acts, and the committee, subject to the general control of the council as respects finance, may act without their acts being confirmed by the council.\n\n(4) Plans or contracts for the purchase of land or buildings, or for the erection, restoration, or enlargement of buildings, shall not be carried into effect until approved by the Lord Lieutenant.\n\n(5) The county council, through the said committee, shall properly manage and maintain every lunatic asylum for their county; and subject to the provisions of this Act, may appoint and remove the officers of the asylum and regulate the expenditure. . . . .\n\n(6) The county council, through the said committee, may, and if required by the Lord Lieutenant shall, make regulations respecting the government and management of every lunatic asylum for their county, and the admission, detention, and discharge of lunatics, and the conditions as to payment and accommodation under which private patients may be admitted into and detained in the asylum, and the regulations when approved by the Lord Lieutenant with or without modifications shall have full effect, and shall have the same effect for the purposes of the fourth section of the Lunatic Asylums (Ireland) Act, 1875, as if made by the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council.\n\n(7) Where a district for a lunatic asylum comprises two or more counties, this section shall apply with the necessary modifications to those counties and to the councils thereof; and the expenses shall be defrayed by the several counties in proportion to the number of lunatics from each county according to the average of the three local financial years which ended next before the last triennial election of county councillors; and the committee for the asylum shall be a joint committee of the councils of the counties, with a representation of each council (determined in case of dispute by the Lord Lieutenant) in the same proportion as that in which the expenses are defrayed.\n\n(8) Where a county council fail or refuse to provide funds for any object approved by any such joint committee, the joint committee may, except where the majority of the county councils represented on such joint committee so fail or refuse, appeal to the Lord Lieutenant, and the said county council shall comply with any order made by the Lord Lieutenant upon that appeal.\n\n(9) Proceedings had or taken by any such joint committee shall be had or taken in the names of the said councils jointly, and proceedings had or taken against any such joint committee shall be had or taken against such councils jointly.\n\nPowers of county council as to acquisition of land or easements.\n\n41 & 42 Vict. c. 52.\n\n48 & 49 Vict. c. 77.\n\n41 & 42 Vict. c. 52.\n\n10.—(1) A county council, for the purpose of [1] any of their powers and duties, may acquire, purchase, take on lease or exchange, any land or any easements or rights over or in land, whether within or without their county, including rights to water, and may acquire, hire, erect, and furnish such halls, buildings, and offices as they require, whether within or without their county, and for the purpose of this section section two hundred and three of the Public Health Act, 1878, shall apply with the necessary modifications, and in particular with the modification that the advertisements mentioned in sub-section two of the said section may be published in any month, and that the notice mentioned in the said sub-section shall be served in the next succeeding month.\n\n(2) A county council shall not take or use any such land, easements, or rights, without either the consent of the owner and occupier or the authority of a provisional order duly confirmed, and where the order does not affect demesne land, it may be confirmed without the authority of Parliament in manner provided by section twelve of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1885, and that section and any enactment amending the same shall apply, with the necessary modifications.\n\n(3) Where a county council desire for the purpose of the work of widening an old road, or making a new road, to acquire otherwise than by agreement any land other than demesne land or pleasure ground or than land situate in a borough or town, they may, if they think fit, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this section, proceed as follows, namely:—\n\n(a) Publish such advertisement and serve such notice on the owner or reputed owner, lessee or reputed lessee, and occupier, of the land as may be prescribed by the Local Government Board, and within the prescribed time petition the judge of assize for an order authorising the council to put into force with reference to such land the powers of the Lands Clauses Acts with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement;\n\n(b) The judge of assize, on due proof of the prescribed advertisements having been published and prescribed notices served, shall, unless there is an application as hereinafter mentioned, make an order in accordance with the prayer of the petition;\n\n(c) Any person interested in the said land on whom the said notice is required as aforesaid to be served and who objects to the land being acquired by the county council, and any owner or reputed owner, lessee or reputed lessee, or occupier, of any land who alleges that such land will be injuriously affected by the said work, and also any ratepayer in the county may, within such time after the publication of the said notices as is fixed by rules of court, apply to the judge of assize to refuse the order upon the said petition, and the judge shall hear such application and determine all questions of law and fact arising thereon, and in particular the question whether the said work is of public utility, and of such importance to the public as to justify the compulsory acquisition of the land;\n\n(d) Any decision by the judge upon the hearing of such application, whether making or refusing the order, shall be subject to appeal by any party to the proceedings before the judge of assize to the Lord Lieutenant in Council within the time fixed by rules of court, and the appeal shall be heard by a committee of the Privy Council (which shall be styled the Judicial Committee), consisting of such members thereof as are or have been judges of the Supreme Court, who, or a quorum of whom consisting of not less than three, shall advise the Lord Lieutenant thereon;\n\nProvided that, with the consent of the parties, the judge of assize may state a case for the opinion of the Court of Appeal upon any question of law, and in such case no appeal shall lie to the Lord Lieutenant in Council.\n\n(e) The judge of assize and Lord Lieutenant in Council and the Court of Appeal may respectively award such costs to be paid by or to parties to any proceedings under this section as appear just;\n\n(f) Rules of court regulating the practice and procedure and costs respecting the petitions to and proceedings before the judge of assize under this section, and appeals from such judge to the Lord Lieutenant in Council, and cases stated, may be made by the authority having power to make rules of court for the Supreme Court;\n\n(g)[1] An order under this section granting in whole or in part the prayer of the petition, whether made by the judge of assize or by the Lord Lieutenant in Council upon appeal from that judge, shall have effect as if it were a provisional order under section two hundred and three of the Public Health Act, 1878, duly confirmed, and upon any land being taken under the order, the compensation for the same to be paid by the county council shall, in the absence of agreement, be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Local Government Board, or if the parties so agree, be determined by the judge of assize, either with or without a jury, according to the agreement;\n\n(h) The foregoing provisions with respect to the acquisition of any land for the purpose of widening an old road, or making a new road, shall apply to the acquisition of any easement or right over land in like manner as if it were land.\n\nPowers of county council as to sudden damage to public works.\n\n11.—(1) The council of each county shall arrange for the immediate repair of sudden damage to any public work, maintained in whole or in part at the cost of the county or any rural district, but where the expense of the repair is wholly leviable off any district and not partly off the county at large, such expense shall not exceed fifty pounds if within the prescribed time the council of the district object to any larger expenditure.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section “repair of sudden damage” means such repair of any sudden damage to any public work, and such erection of any temporary work in place of any public work suddenly carried away or destroyed, and such collection or preservation of the materials of any damaged public work, as, subject to the general directions of the county council, the county surveyor considers cannot, without prejudice to the public, be delayed until the ordinary procedure relating to the repair of public works can be followed.\n\n(3) The powers of any justices and of extraordinary presentment sessions in relation to the repair of sudden damage to public works shall cease.\n\nPower of county council as to purchase of quarries and machinery and obtaining materials.\n\n6 & 7 Will. 4. c. 116.\n\n12.—(1) The county council, without prejudice to the power under section one hundred and sixty-two of the Grand Juries Act, 1836, or any other enactment, may, for the purpose of the maintenance of the roads in their county, whether main or other roads, acquire, purchase, take on lease, or exchange any land from which materials may be got for the repair of such roads, and may purchase or hire any steam roller, scarifier, or other machine, and may place at the disposal of the persons contracting for the repair of the roads materials from the said land, and the use of the said steam roller, scarifier, or other machine, upon such reasonable terms as may be agreed upon.\n\n(2) Section one hundred and sixty-two of the Grand Juries Act, 1836 (which relates to the power to obtain gravel, stone, sand, or other materials), shall extend to authorise the digging for, raising, and carrying away of gravel, stone, sand, or other materials, out of any river or brook at a distance of at least a hundred and fifty feet above or below any bridge, dam, or weir, where the same can be taken away without diverting or interrupting the course of the river or brook, or prejudicing or damaging any building, highway, ford, or spawning-bed.\n\nPowers of county council as to exceptional distress.\n\n25 & 26 Vict. c. 83.\n\n13.—(1) Where the guardians of any union satisfy the council of a county that exceptional distress exists in some district electoral division situate both in the union and in the county, and the council apply to the Local Government Board, that Board may, if they think fit, by order authorise the guardians, subject to the prescribed conditions, to administer relief out of the workhouse for any time not exceeding two months from the date of the order to poor persons of any description resident in the said electoral division, and may revoke any such order either wholly or partly or with reference to any particular class of persons.\n\n(2) Section two of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1862 (which excludes an occupier of more than a quarter of an acre from being relieved otherwise than in the workhouse), shall not apply as regards relief given under this section.\n\n(3) One half of any expenditure incurred in pursuance of an order under this section shall be levied off the county at large (so, however, that the total amount of such expenditure levied off the county at large in any one year shall not exceed a sum equal to threepence in the pound on the rateable value of the county), and the council of the county may nominate one of their members who shall be an additional member of the board of guardians for the period fixed by the order.\n\n(4) The guardians may, with the consent of the Local Government Board, obtain for the purpose of this section temporary advances of such amount and for such period and repayable in such manner as that Board may sanction, and may mortgage their property and funds to secure such advances.\n\nPowers of county council as to appointment of coroners and coroners’ districts and provision as to removal, salary, and qualification of coroner.\n\n14.—(1) . . . . On a vacancy in the office of a coroner for a county the county council shall within one month after the vacancy, or such further time not exceeding three months after the vacancy as the Lord Chancellor may allow, appoint a qualified person to the office, and if the county is divided into coroners’ districts assign him a district.\n\n(2) The county council may alter the coroners’ districts, and the enactments respecting those districts shall apply as if the county council were the justices assembled in special sessions for that purpose under the direction of the Lord Lieutenant, and the secretary of the county council were the clerk of the peace . . . .\n\n(3) The Lord Chancellor may, if he thinks fit, remove any coroner for a county from his office for inability or misbehaviour in the discharge of his duty.\n\n(4) The writ de coronatore eligendo need not be issued, but neither the omission to issue that writ nor anything else in this section shall alter the jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, or the High Court or a judge of assize, in relation to the removal of a coroner otherwise than in manner provided by this Act, or in relation to ordering a new election of a coroner.\n\n(5) A person who is a coroner for a county shall not be qualified to be elected, or to be, a county or district councillor in that county.\n\n(6) The salary of every coroner shall be in lieu of all sums which otherwise would be payable to him for fees, mileage, and allowances, and shall be fixed with the approval of the Local Government Board by the county or borough council by whom the salary is payable, or in default of the same being so fixed then by the Local Government Board, and shall not be subject to increase or diminution during his tenure of office.\n\nProvided that—\n\n(a) nothing in this section shall deprive the coroner of the right to be repaid expenses and disbursements lawfully paid by him on the holding of any inquest;
