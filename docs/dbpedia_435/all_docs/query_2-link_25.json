        "text": "GTC Portal/Members Only Content\n\nThe General Tribal Council (GTC) Portal has been created to provide the membership with easier access to GTC information. The information will provide electronic access to reports and GTC meeting packets. In addition, the GTC portal will provide members with the ability to track and gather information on petitions that have been submitted to the Business Committee.\n\n** The documents contained in the Members Only section are confidential and only available to tribal members. The materials contained here are not to be shared with non-tribal members. **\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe General Tribal Council (GTC) is the governing body of the Oneida Nation. The GTC is made up of enrolled voting age Oneida members, ages 18 years and older. A duly GTC meeting needs at least 75 enrolled and voting Oneida members, including the meeting Chair, to address a topic that was announced to all voting Oneida members. The Tribal Chair leads the meeting, however, the Vice Chair may lead the meeting if the Chair is absent.\n\nSpecial Meetings\n\nSpecial GTC meetings may be called by two other ways. The Tribal Chair or a petition signed by 50 enrolled Oneida members 18 years or older can call a GTC meeting. The petition that describes the purpose for the meeting is submitted to the Tribal Secretary to call for a meeting to address the petition topic.\n\nGTC Resolutions\n\nGTC Resolutions are used to document the decisions officially adopted by the General Tribal Council. The resolution differs from action taken in General Tribal Council meeting by including the authority of the council to make the decision and provides the background information for why the decision was made."
