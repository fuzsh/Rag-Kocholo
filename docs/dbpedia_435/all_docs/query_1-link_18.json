        "text": "When are City Council meetings?\n\nCity Council holds their regular meetings on the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 5:30 p.m. in the City Hall Auditorium, 250 N 5th Street. These meetings are open to the public. Meeting agendas are posted the Friday afternoon prior to the Wednesday meeting on the City’s Agendas & Minutes webpage.\n\nWhat are City Council workshops, and can I attend them?\n\nCity Council workshops are public meetings where Council discusses, analyzes, studies and clarifies information and issues for upcoming Council meetings. Council and staff may request specific items for an agenda and items range from specific projects to upcoming legislation to Citywide department updates. Workshops are held the Monday prior to regular meetings at 5:30 p.m. in the Fire Administration Training Room (625 Ute Avenue). Public comment is typically not taken during workshops.\n\nHow do I know what is on the City Council agenda?\n\nCity Council meeting agendas and packets are posted the Friday afternoon prior to the next week’s meeting(s) on the City’s Agendas & Minutes webpage. Agenda Packets include a staff report and supporting documents for each agenda item. Hard copies of a meeting’s agenda and packet are available at the meeting. Agendas and packets from the last several years are also available online the City’s Agendas & Minutes webpage.\n\nWhat is the difference between a resolution and an ordinance?\n\nA resolution is a written motion or policy adopted by a deliberative body.\n\nAn ordinance is legislation which necessitates changes in our current laws, policies, or procedures as a city, which is codified in the Grand Junction Municipal Code.\n\nWhat is the difference between a “first reading” ordinance and a “second reading” ordinance?\n\nAll ordinances require two readings by City Council. The first reading introduces the ordinance (typically placed on the Consent Agenda) and includes the meeting date of the upcoming Public Hearing but is generally not discussed by City Council. The second reading of the ordinance is a Public Hearing (on the Regular Agenda) when public comment can be taken for that item and allows time for discussion by City Council.\n\nResolutions require only one reading and are typically voted on at the regular City Council meeting that they are scheduled to appear on.\n\nCan I speak at a Council meeting even if my issue is not on the agenda?\n\nYes, at every City Council meeting there is tine allocated for Public Comments as well as a “Non-Scheduled Citizens & Visitors” period on the agenda. Public Comment occurs before a Council vote is taken and the nonscheduled comments occurs at the beginning and end of the meeting. During these periods, anyone may speak before the Council on issues that are not on that meeting’s agenda. In addition, community members may also speak at a future meeting when that item does appear. If a Public Hearing is scheduled, public comments are taken during the meeting specifically for that item.\n\nHow do I know who my City Council representative is?\n\nThe Grand Junction City Council is comprised of seven community members - five of whom are elected from and represent specific City districts - and two are elected at-large.\n\nYou can check on the City’s website to see which City Council District you live in.\n\nHow do I let my Council representative know my opinion on an issue if I cannot speak at the meeting when that issue will be voted on?\n\nYou may call, email, or write to individual Council Members or the Council as a whole.\n\nPhone: 970-244-1504 (message only)\n\nMail: 250 N 5th Street, Grand Junction, CO 81501\n\nEmail: Each Council Member's email address as well as additional information can be found on their respective City webpage which can be found on the City Council webpage.\n\nCommunity members are also encouraged to go to GJSpeaks.org to comment on projects listed there.\n\nCan I watch past Council meetings?\n\nYes, Council meetings are live streamed and available on the City’s Agendas & Minutes webpage along with other public City meetings. City Council meetings are also broadcast live on channel 191.\n\nHow do I best contact or schedule a meeting with a Council Member?\n\nYou may call the Council office at 970-244-1504 or email the Council Member with whom you wish to speak.\n\nWhen does the Council hold hearings and vote on the City budget?\n\nCity staff develops the annual budget throughout the year and a recommended budget is presented by the City Manager to City Council beginning with Council workshops in October. The first public hearing typically takes place in November and the second public hearing in December, followed by City Council’s adoption of the City’s budget. For more information, visit the Annual Budget & Budget Development webpage.\n\nWhere can I see the City Charter and Municipal Code?"
