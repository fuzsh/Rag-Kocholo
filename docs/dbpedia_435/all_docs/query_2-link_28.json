        "text": "Our City Government\n\nThe city of Grand Prairie is a Home Rule City and is governed by the laws of the State of Texas and within the framework of the City Charter which was approved by the voters of Grand Prairie on May 1, 1948. Amendments to the Charter have been approved periodically by the voters of the city. The city operates under a Council-Manager form of government which combines strong leadership, representative democracy through elected officials, and a professionally trained and educated city manager.\n\nThe City Council is the legislative body; its members are the community's decision makers. Power is centralized in the elected council, which approves the budget and determines the tax rate, for example. The council also focuses on the community's goals, major projects, and such long-term considerations as community growth, land use development, capital improvement plans, capital financing, and strategic planning. The council also supervises the city manager's performance.\n\nMayor and City Council Members\n\nCommittees"
