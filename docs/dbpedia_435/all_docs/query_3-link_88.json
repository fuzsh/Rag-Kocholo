If you are considering running for office, your first stop should be talking to us. We can help you understand the process and requirements and help you decide if you are committed to do the work necessary to be elected, such as fundraising calls and door-belling.\n\nWhen the committee explains the efforts needed, some prospective candidates decide they are not prepared to run at this time. One of the biggest challenges for the committee is convincing people that getting elected is possible, that they can grow into the public role, and that the party will provide support.\n\n​\n\nOfficial candidate filing is done during a one-week period in May of each year. Contact the County Auditor for specific information.\n\n​\n\nParty Endorsement\n\nA special meeting of the membership of the Whatcom County Democratic Central Committee will be held prior to Primary Elections to give candidates an opportunity to present their case for endorsement. Candidates who wish to be considered for Endorsement must request this at least 72 hours in advance of this meeting. Members in good standing vote on endorsements.\n\n​\n\nParty Certification\n\nDemocratic candidates may be able to access party resources prior to endorsement if they request and receive Certification as a Democrat. Click on the Certification and Endorsement Process for details.\n\n​\n\nCertification & Endorsement Process\n\n​​\n\n​\n\nDifference Between Party Endorsement And Party Nomination\n\nA political party endorsement is a statement of support of a candidate for public office. It is also an internal policy decision saying where the organization’s resources will be spent. It is no different than a PTA, voter’s league, or labor union picking which candidates they want to support and work for. This is why we require membership in the Whatcom Democrats in order to vote on our endorsement decisions.\n\nA party endorsement has no direct effect on which candidates may run for office. Endorsement does not decide which candidates qualify for the general election ballot, the way a party nomination normally would.\n\nState election law governs the rules of the Primary Election, and currently, in Washington State, primary elections are run like non-partisan primaries, advancing the top two vote-getters to the General Election ballot, regardless of party affiliation. Primaries (in WA State) for partisan offices do not constitute a party nomination process.\n\nOnly voters casting a ballot in a Primary Election have the power to eliminate, or advance, a candidate to the general election ballot.\n\nSince we do not hold public nominating primary elections in Washington at this time, the Washington State Democratic Party has adopted its own process and rules to designate who is the nominee of the “Democratic Party” in partisan races in Washington. These rules have no direct impact on the endorsement policy of the Whatcom Democrats."
