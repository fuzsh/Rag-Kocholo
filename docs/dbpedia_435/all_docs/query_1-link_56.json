        "text": "​​​​​​​​​​​​​Backcountry Search and Rescue​​ Program\n\nColorado Backcountry Search and Rescue organizations are volunteer-based and provide search and rescue services throughout Colorado, free of charge, to those stranded, lost or injured in the backcountry. Grant funds and reimbursements are available to Colorado counties and nonprofit backcountry search and rescue organizations to enable volunteers to continue to provide services.​\n\nIf you are experiencing an emergency in the backcountry, call 911.\n\nColorado Outdoor Recreation Search and Rescue (CORSAR) Card\n\nColorado Outdoor Recreation Search and Rescue (CORSAR) Card: Dedicated VOLUNTEER search and rescue (BSAR) professionals, across Colorado, are ready to mobilize to help those stranded, lost, or injured in the Colorado backcountry. Your Colorado Outdoor Recreation Search and Rescue (CORSAR) contribution supplies reimbursements to SAR teams for costs incurred while conducting search and rescue operations, and to provide funding for the purchase of search and rescue-related equipment and training. Because of your support and the tremendous generosity of our search and rescue responders, Colorado is a safer place to play. Purchase a COR​​SAR Card.\n\nHere’s how the reimbursement works...\n\nAfter a BSAR incident concludes, the County in which the mission was conducted sends a request to Colorado Parks and Wildlife for reimbursement. If the subject of the incident has a CORSAR card or eligible Parks and Wildlife license or registration, a reimbursement payment is processed immediately. If the subject of the search does not have a CORSAR Card or eligible Parks and Wildlife license or registration, the request for reimbursement is held until the end of the year. If money is available in the fund at the end of the year, the requesting county receives reimbursement.\n\nThe CORSAR card is not insurance and does not reimburse individuals or pay for medical transport.\n\nCORSAR cards are available for $5 for a 1-year card and $20 for a 5-year card.​ Purchase a CORSAR Card​.\n\nInterested in volunteering for a Backcountry Search and Rescue (BSAR) team?\n\nBackcountry Search and Rescue in Colorado is a 100% volunteer-based service that functions under the authority and coordination of the County Sheriff. Being a backcountry search and rescue member is a challenging and rewarding life-saving service.​ Visit the Colorado Search and Rescue Association​ website for a Colorado County Map and contact information of active Backcountry Search and Rescue Organizations. Most BSAR Team websites provide information about how to become a member with team contact information if you have further questions.\n\nBackcountry Search and Rescue Workgroup\n\nIn 2021, a study of the Backcountry Search and Rescue system was conducted for the purpose of identifying focused areas of need within the system of coordination to support long-term sustainability. Read the BSAR Study. The workgroup remains as an integral part of the team to identify gaps in the system, areas needing improvements, and begin discussions about solutions.\n\nOutdoor Education and Training\n\nTo maximize safety in the outdoors, outdoor education and training is extremely important. High altitude, weather conditions, cell phone reception, wildlife, planning and preparedness are vital pieces of ensuring a good time in Colorado. Even the most experienced outdoor recreationalists can find themselves in precarious situations.\n\nYou can find various free and low-cost outdoor education in Colorado.\n\nMental Health Training​ for Backcountry Search and Rescue 1st Responders\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife has established a partnership for providing first responder mental health to those who are participating members in search and rescue activities throughout Colorado. For more information, please visit the Responder Alliance website.\n\n​Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC)\n\nOffice of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT)"
