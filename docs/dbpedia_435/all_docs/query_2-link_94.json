        "text": "Sussex County, New Jersey\n\nCounty Government Structure\n\nSussex County is governed by five (5) Commissioners who are elected by the voters of Sussex County. Each serves on the county’s Board of County Commissioners for a term of three (3) years, after which time they can seek re‐election or retire.\n\nThe Commisions meet on the second and fourth Wednesday of each month at 6 p.m. Meetings are “open to the public,” which means anyone can attend to observe the meeting. Two periods are set aside for public comment during regular board meetings. The meetings are held at the County Administrative Center, One Spring Street, Newton, NJ.\n\nBoard of County Commissioners\n\nClerk of the Board of County Commisioners\n\nCounty Counsel\n\nWhat is a “Commissioner”?\n\nA Commissioner is the elected county government representative in New Jersey who serves on the county’s main governing body, the Board of County Commissioners.\n\nThe Sussex County Board of County Commissioners sets policy for the county’s departments and divisions, plus a number of boards, commissions, authorities and committees. The Commissioners appoint a county administrator to supervise the actual day‐to‐day operation of county government.\n\nFormerly called “Freeholders”, the title Commissioner was adopted on January 1, 2021 due to a change in state law.\n\nThe basic law establishing the freeholder form of county government in New Jersey was enacted in 1798. In the beginning, each corporate municipality was represented by a freeholder on the county governing board. But as the number of municipalities increased to the point where some boards were bogged down by sheer weight of numbers, the law was changed. In 1912, the “Small Board” Act was adopted, permitting counties to elect freeholders from the county at large. The exact number of freeholders making up each county board was to be determined by the respective county’s population. The law was permissive and subject to approval by the voters at a referendum.\n\nSince its enactment, 17 of New Jersey’s 21 counties have taken advantage of this Act. Only four counties: Gloucester, Salem, Atlantic, and Cumberland, retain the historic form with one Commissioner elected from each governing body or subdivision. Sussex County has five Commissioners. A county may have between three and nine Commissioners, depending on its population and classification.\n\nThe Commissioners are elected at‐large to serve three‐year staggered terms. The five Commissioners elect a director from among themselves to run their meetings and to serve as a spokesperson for the board.\n\nNew Jersey was the only state whose elected county representatives were called freeholders.\n\nSussex County is represented in the Federal Government by two Senators and two Congressmen:\n\nSenate:\n\nU.S. Senator Cory A. Booker (Democrat)\n\nU.S. Senator Robert Menendez (Democrat)\n\nCongress:\n\nU.S. Rep. for the 11th Congressional District – Mikie Sherrill (Democrat)\n\nU.S. Rep. for the 5th Congressional District – Josh Gottheimer (Democrat)\n\nSussex County is represented in NJ State Government by its Governor, one member of the State Senate and two members of the General Assembly:\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy (Democrat)\n\nState Senator Steven V. Oroho (Republican) – 24th Legislative District\n\nAssemblyman Parker Space (Republican) – 24th Legislative District\n\nAssemblywoman Harold J. Wirths (Republican) – 24th Legislative District\n\nSussex County’s Constitutional Officers* are:\n\nJeff Parrott, County Clerk (Republican)\n\nMichael Strada , Sheriff (Republican)\n\nGary R. Chiusano , Surrogate (Republican)\n\nFrancis Koch, County Prosecutor\n\n* Each of New Jersey’s 21 counties has three constitutional officers that are elected by the citizens of their respective county; they are the County Clerk, County Sheriff, and County Surrogate. The County Prosecutor is appointed and serves at the pleasure of the governor.\n\nFunctions of the County Clerk:\n\nResponsible for the administration of a broad range of services, including:\n\nThe recording of all documents affecting real estate ownership\n\nThe processing of U.S. Passport applications\n\nAssisting persons who apply to become a Notary Public\n\nFiling of Business Trade names\n\nFiling of military discharges\n\nIssuance of Veteran Cards\n\nIssuance of veteran’s peddler licenses\n\nThe County Clerk also plays a key role in the conduct of elections:\n\nAccepts nominating petitions (as election official)\n\nDraws for ballot position (as election official)\n\nDesigns layout of ballot (as election official)\n\nProcesses the Mail‐In ballot\n\nCertifies election results & issues candidate certificates of election (as election official)\n\nFunctions of the County Sheriff:\n\nMakes arrests\n\nControls traffic, conducts accident investigations, transports prisoners\n\nConducts routine patrols\n\nMaintains and operates county jail, other facilities\n\nSponsors community crime prevention programs\n\nFunctions of the County Surrogate:\n\nProbates wills\n\nProcesses adoptions\n\nProcesses contested probate matters\n\nProcesses alleged incompetents\n\nFilms and records all probate proceedings\n\nInvests minor’s funds\n\nAppoints guardians of minors\n\nFunctions of the County Prosecutor:"
