The electoral threshold is calculated by multiplying the number of parties running in the elections by 0.4, with a maximum possible threshold of 3.5%.[2]\n\nIf no party receives a majority, or the two largest parties are unable to form a coalition government within thirty days of the elections, a runoff election will be held between the two most popular coalitions, with the winner receiving a seat bonus to give them a majority.[3][4]\n\nCampaign\n\n[edit]\n\nA political collaboration between Future Republic (RF) and Area Democratica was announced on 18 April 2024. Area Democratica nominated some of its representatives on the RF list as independent candidates for the election.[5]\n\nAn electoral alliance was formed for the elections:\n\nReformist Alliance (Alleanza Riformista), an alliance of Movimento Ideali Socialisti, We Sammarineses, and Ēlego.[6]\n\nOn 18 April, a coalition was formed between the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party and the Reformist Alliance,[7] known as Democracy and Freedom.[8]\n\nOn 24 April an coalition of the Party of Socialists and Democrats, Libera San Marino and the Socialist Party was launched.[9]\n\nElectoral lists\n\n[edit]\n\n# List name №1 on the list Main ideologies Political position Candidates total Note\n\n1–2\n\nPaolo Albani (Libera/PS)\n\nMilena Gasperoni (PSD) Social democracy\n\nPro-Europeanism Centre-left 52 (Libera/PS)\n\n31 (PSD) [10]\n\n3–4\n\nMarino Albani (PDCS)\n\nAndreina Bartolini (AR) Christian democracy Centre 52 (PDCS)\n\n33 (AR) [11]\n\n5\n\nAlessandro Rossi Democratic socialism\n\nVaccine hesitancy Left-wing 18 [12]\n\n6\n\nFederico Bascucci Liberalism\n\nPro-Europeanism Centre 43 [13]\n\n7\n\nMirella Andreini Liberalism\n\nChristian democracy Centre 42 [14]\n\n8\n\nMarianna Bucci Environmentalism\n\nAnti-corruption\n\nProgressivism Left-wing 20 [15]\n\nSeat projections\n\n[edit]\n\nPublisher Publication date Sample\n\nsize DeL Libera/PS–PSD RF RETE DML DEMOS Majority PDCS AR Libera/PS PSD Libertas.sm 18 May 2024 n/a 19 3 14 4 8 5 4 3 4\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nParty or allianceVotes%SeatsDemocracy and FreedomChristian Democratic Party6,20634.1422Reformist Alliance1,2686.984Coalition votes690.380Total7,54341.5026Libera/PS – PSDLibera / Socialist Party2,86215.7510Party of Socialists and Democrats2,21612.198Coalition votes640.350Total5,14228.2918Future Republic2,17811.988Domani Motus Liberi1,5408.475RETE Movement9225.073Solidary Democracy8524.690Total18,177100.0060Valid votes18,17793.46Invalid/blank votes1,2716.54Total votes19,448100.00Registered voters/turnout38,33850.73Source: Secretariat of State for Internal Affairs and Civil Service"
