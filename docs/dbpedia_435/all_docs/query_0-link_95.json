        "meta_description": "The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Communist and Socialist Serials collects 1,945 serials and publications chronicling the activity of national and international Communist and Socialist groups, published between 1850 and 2013, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newsletters, newspapers, reports, information bulletins, theoretical journals, and informally prepared communiquÃ©s issued by political groups. The serials document the rise and fall of Communism and Socialism at a granular level, rich in detailed first-person accounts of key political events: World War II, the Vietnam conflict, German reunification. Publications originate from national political parties, smaller splinter groups and factions, current affairs magazines, and unions and labor coalitions at the local and national level. The collection contains hundreds of titles documenting Communism and Socialism internationally, in serials and reports emanating from established national political organizations, as well as material documenting political activity in Puerto Rico, Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and in most cases only a handful of issues of each publication are held.",
