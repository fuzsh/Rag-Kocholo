Council members serve staggered four-year terms and the Mayor serves a two-year term. The Mayor is limited by City Charter to two two-year terms.

Regular meetings begin at 7:30 p.m. and are also broadcast live on cable Spectrum Channel 203 and AT&T Channel 99, in addition to the City’s YouTube channel. Regular meetings may be preceded by a study session.
