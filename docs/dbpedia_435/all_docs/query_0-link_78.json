        "text": "An ambitious policy platform to invest in communities, create a green transition for Europe, and create opportunities for young people was approved by delegates.\n\nThe chief coordinator of PES resolutions Maros Sefcovic led a four-hour plenary session with interventions from UK Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, as well as PES member parties from across Europe, the Young European Socialists, PES LGBTI group Rainbow Rose, and trade unions.\n\nThe eight resolutions will form the basis of the 2019 PES election manifesto.\n\nEqual Societies: Empowering youth\n\nEqual Societies: Social Europe\n\nEqual Societies: Progressive economy\n\nEqual Societies: For a stronger democracy in Europe\n\nEqual Societies: A healthy environment and food, green growth and modern industries\n\nEqual Societies: For a Europe of gender equality and empowered women\n\nEqual Societies: For a fair, sustainable, peaceful and prosperous world\n\nEqual Societies: For fair and progressive asylum and migration policies that work for all\n\nThe resolutions, as adopted, can be downloaded here.\n\nSpeaking after the resolutions had passed, Resolution Lead Co-ordinator Maros Sefcovic said:\n\n“It has been my honour to guide these resolutions through Congress. The vote today is a sign that the progressive family stands behind these policies. They will make Europe a fairer, freer and more sustainable place. Conservatives have been in charge of Europe for a decade now – their policies have left Europe divided. We will bring Europeans together, we will make Europe a fairer and more equal place.”\n\nPES President Sergei Stanishev said:\n\n“Today the PES political family passed our blueprint for a better society. We need to see a change in direction for Europe now more than ever. For too long conservative policies have undermined the social fabric of Europe – we need a commission that will safeguard our democracy and rule of law, ensure fair and sustainable growth, empower all and protect the most vulnerable in our societies, a Commission which will restore the faith of our citizens in the European project, a Commission that will provide young Europeans with a bright future, a Commission which will push for equality. This is what the PES will do.”\n\n1000 participants – prime ministers, party officials, delegates, activists, academics and guests – from 56 different countries are set to attend the PES Congress in Lisbon today and tomorrow. A record number attended fringe events yesterday, and even more are set to attend S&D and FEPS fringe events happening today. A record 300 participants signed up for yesterday’s annual PES Women conference. Overall, 76 progressive organisations are officially represented at Congress, and activists from many more are in Lisbon to take part in Congress.\n\nSpeakers at Plenary (in order of appearance):"
