        "text": "Law no. 25 of 30 April 1964 established the Collar of the Equestrian Order of Saint Marino, which is normally conferred on Heads of State by the Great and General Council.\n\nThe Collar is made up of gold medallions with the image of Saint Marino in coloured glazes, alternated with gold scrolls bearing the motto Libertas in capital letters in light blue enamel. Medallions and scrolls are connected by gold chains. The series of medallions alternated with scrolls is interrupted at the front by a gold plate bearing the coat of arms of the Republic, without crown, enclosed between two branches of oak and laurel, all in coloured glazes. The decoration of the Order is hung to this plate.\n\nThe insignia of the Collar are completed by a plate, to be worn on the left side of the chest, which consists of eight gold rays (alternately longer and shorter) with the Cross of the Order; in the spaces between the four arms there are four scrolls bearing the motto Libertas in capital letters in blue enamel.\n\nThe Equestrian Order of Saint Agatha (Co-Founder of the Republic) was established with Decree of 5 June 1923 and amended with the Decrees of 15 September 1923 and 9 June 1925.\n\nKnight of Grand Cross\n\nKnight Grand Officer\n\nKnight Major Officer or Commendatore\n\nKnight Officer\n\nKnight\n\nIt is composed of equal ranks and is intended for foreign nationals who, with their services, work and charity, have deserved the merits of the Republic.\n\nThe power to confer this Order is assigned to a Mastership composed of the two Captains Regent, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, of Internal Affairs and of Health, the Government Syndics, the President of the Parliamentary Commission for Budget, a Law Commissioner and five members elected by the Great and General Council.\n\nThe rules for the conferral of the Equestrian Order of Saint Agatha are the same as those governing the Equestrian Order of Saint Marino.\n\nThe Equestrian Order of Saint Agatha is recognised in Italy and elsewhere similarly to the Equestrian Order of Saint Marino."
