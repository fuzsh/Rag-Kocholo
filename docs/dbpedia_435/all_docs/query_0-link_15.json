        "text": "Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, Swiss political party of the centre-left that supports an extensive government role in the economy. With the Christian Democratic People’s Party, FDP. The Liberals, and the Swiss People’s Party, the Social Democratic Party has governed Switzerland as part of a grand coalition since 1959.\n\nFounded in 1888, the Social Democratic Party is among the country’s oldest existing political parties. In the late 19th century it was one of the leading opposition groups to the then-dominant Radical Democratic Party, and, after the introduction of proportional representation for national elections in the 20th century, it exerted significant influence on Swiss political life.\n\nThe party’s policies have generally reflected those of the democratic socialist tradition in Europe; for example, it supports giving the federal government the power of direct taxation and sanctions greater government management of the economy. In the second half of the 20th century the party championed a number of other issues, including environmental protection and an expanded role for women in government. It also became a principal advocate of Swiss membership in international bodies, including the United Nations (which the country joined in 2002) and the European Union. Although the party has generally adopted moderate socialist policies, in the 1970s it flirted with more radical economic policies before confirming its traditional approach again in the early 1980s. Support for the Social Democratic Party has been strongest among blue-collar workers, teachers, and the elderly.\n\nSince 1959 the party has held two seats on the seven-member Federal Council, the Swiss government’s executive branch. In 1984, during a period of internal dissension, the party narrowly rejected withdrawing from the Federal Council. It also threatened to leave the coalition in the 1990s when one of its appointments to the Federal Council was vetoed by its coalition partners."
