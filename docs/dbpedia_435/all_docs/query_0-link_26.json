        "text": "The centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) will remain the largest group in the European Parliament following Sunday’s elections, with 213 seats, ahead of the 191 for the centre-left Socialists & Democrats, according to the latest count. The new Parliament will have 751 seats compared to 766 in the old Parliament.\n\nClick here for our results map.\n\nThough the EPP will remain the largest party, it will not be in the lead by the same huge margin as it was in the last term. The group lost 61 seats on Sunday – hardly a strong mandate. The Parliament as a whole has shrunk by 15 seats.\n\nThe liberal ALDE group remains in third place for the moment, but it is down to 64 MEPs compared with 83 in the just-ended term. The Greens/European Free Alliance group lost five MEPs in the election according to the latest count, coming in at 52. But this number is likely to fall further as parties of regional separatists leave. The Flemish N-VA is in talks to leave the EFA and join the European Conservatives and Reformists, taking their four MEPs with them.\n\nThe ECR had a better-than-expected result, coming in fifth with 46 MEPs, a drop of ten from the current Parliament. As long as no party leaves the ECR, it will still have MEPs from enough member states to remain a group in the next Parliament.\n\nThe far-left GUE group did worse than expected, coming in sixth with 42 MEPs. This is up from the 35 seats in the current Parliament, but still not enough to make it a bloc with any real power. It will be essential for GUE to attract some of the new parties, such as Italy’s Five Star Movement and Spain’s Podemos.\n\nNigel Farage’s Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group came last with 38 seats – an increase of seven.\n\nThat leaves 107 MEPs. 41 of these are from parties that currently sit in the ‘non-aligned’ group in the European Parliament. 66 are from new parties that have not been in the European Parliament before. It is these 66 that the groups will be seeking to woo over the coming weeks. Though it is clear now who the two largest groups in the Parliament will be, the third-place spot is up for grabs."
