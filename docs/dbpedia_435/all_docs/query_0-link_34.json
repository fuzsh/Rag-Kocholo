        "text": "With the European Parliament elections fast approaching, Catherine De Vries looks at what might happen and the potential short- and longer-term consequences.\n\nBetween 6 and 9 June 2024, voters across the European Union will elect a new European Parliament (EP). The future of the EU looks fragile. Mounting tensions on the global stage, for which the EU’s foreign policy is ill-equipped, coupled with increasing backlash against climate policy and weakening economic foundations, are fuelling political polarisation within member states.\n\nThis polarisation has already affected the domestic politics of many member states. Electoral volatility has risen over the past decades and mainstream political forces that used to dominate the political scene — conservatives, liberals and social democrats — are in decline. At the same time, populist forces that criticise political elites at home and in Brussels are on the rise.\n\nThese developments will also likely affect the composition of the European Parliament this year. Indeed, recent projections of the outcome of the European Parliament elections suggest that the grand coalition comprising social democrats (Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D)), Christian democrats/centre-right (European People’s Party (EPP)) and liberals (Renew Europe (RE)) will weaken. Populist and radical right party groups, namely the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Identity and Democracy (ID) look set to gain.\n\nAlthough polling the outcome of European Parliament elections is notoriously difficult, not in the least because turnout is usually very low, current predictions suggest a sea change in European politics. The next EP will be considerably more right-leaning than the current one, and while EPP will likely remain the largest party group the two groups (ECR and ID) to its right will be considerably larger than they currently are.\n\nIn fact, should the ECR and ID have formed a single parliamentary bloc it is conceivable that it could have emerged as a group larger than the centre-left (S&D), commanding about a quarter of the seats in the EP. But while populist and radical right party groupings are likely to gain a number of seats, they do not work together easily. We have seen this in recent weeks with ID kicking out the German Alternative for Germany, and ID’s Marine Le Pen openly courting Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s party the Brothers of Italy that is currently part of the ECR, but Meloni not reciprocating.\n\nNot only is the bloc split in two party groupings, but the nationalist stances of these parties put their interests at odds with each other. What is more, the legislative activity of populist and radical right members of the European Parliament has been weak in past parliamentary sessions.\n\nNotwithstanding the uncertainty about the outcome, the possible gains for populist and radical right party groupings indicate a rocky road ahead for European policymakers, both in the short and longer term.\n\nIn the short term, the new composition of the Parliament impacts the election of the Commission president and their team. The question is whether President von der Leyen will receive enough support for a second term.\n\nIn 2019, Von der Leyen was only elected in 2019 with a slim majority of 9 votes and had to make many concessions to the green and progressive party families. With the current fragmented parliament, Von der Leyen may have to make concessions to the radical right party families, which could cost her support among progressive forces in the Parliament. Some of them have already indicated that they will not cooperate with the radical right under any circumstances.\n\nIn short, if the government leaders in the European Council decide to nominate Von der Leyen as the new Commission president after the elections, the path to her approval in parliament looks difficult.\n\nIn the longer term, the projected shift to the right might change the coalition needed to follow the current policy trajectory in the EU. A larger share of populist and radical right members of parliament and the potential associated shift to the right of the European People’s Party raises concerns about the future of decarbonisation and derisking of the European continent. One of the signature policies during Von der Leyen’s presidency of the Commission was the European Green Deal, but with many far-right parties openly supporting farmer protests in the past, the majority for any further steps to combat climate change looks much more fragile.\n\nA second policy area where we might observe change is when it comes to support for Ukraine. While some populist and radical right parties, like Italy’s Brothers of Italy, seem univocally behind Ukraine, others like the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands hold much more ambiguous positions. Will the EU’s support for Ukraine or Europe’s commitment to combatting climate change be watered down? These are questions that will now arise.\n\nIn this way, the EU will go through a transition that we have witnessed in many member states over the past decade: the shrinking of the political centre and the rise of the political extremes. This development will make crafting effective policy solutions to tackle the EU’s persistent challenges more difficult. The risk may not only be a shift in policy, but also a general political stalemate and gridlock within and between the EU’s institutions.\n\nSince the precedent set by the UK’s departure, many populist and radical right parties no longer want to leave the European Union. Britain’s experiment with leaving is perceived as a failure and increased support for remaining in the EU among Europe’s citizens.\n\nAs a result, the EU positions of many populist and radical right parties have moved from exit-scepticism, advocating to leave the EU, to remain-scepticism. Rather, they want to change the project from within and move it in a more sovereigntist direction. After the upcoming elections we are likely to get a clearer picture of how far they can take this. Only time will tell."
