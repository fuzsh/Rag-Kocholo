Members of the Leadership Council take responsibility for a select portfolio, ensuring that each sector has a dedicated champion, an advocate, and a strong leader.\n\nThe Leadership Council relies on the work of the COO Secretariat and works closely with sector directors to ensure that the Council has the most up-to-date analysis and information. This relationship between the Leadership Council and sector directors allows the Council to focus on good governance and navigate the organization and First Nations leadership through the federal and provincial political landscape.\n\nThe Leadership Council plays a vital role in the Chiefs of Ontario and provides a source of strength, wisdom and leadership. Through their dedication and hard work, the Leadership Council will continue to provide guidance to First Nations in Ontario with great minds, hearts, and Spirit."
