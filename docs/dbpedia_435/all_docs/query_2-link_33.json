        "text": "June / July / August 2024\n\nSummer is here and Oceanport is bustling. My favorite part of this time of year is when I drive or walk around Oceanport and see our parks, waterways, and recreation facilities being utilized more than ever by Oceanport residents and people from all over the County. Speaking of parks, I want to give a big thank you to our Parks and Recreation team, led by Council President Bill Deerin, Kelle Burrough, Kim Parent, and Paula Lombardo for putting together a beautiful tribute to our service men and women at our annual Memorial Day Parade. Council President Deerin used his vast array of connections to ensure the bad weather held off until we finished our march down Monmouth Boulevard to the Port Au Peck Fire House. Oceanportâ€™s very own Sean Burrough led the parade on the bag pipes. We were honored to have Staff Sergeant James Cavanaugh, who still serves in the National Guard as a Primary Training Officer with our Officer Candidate School in Sea Girt, as our Grand Marshal."
