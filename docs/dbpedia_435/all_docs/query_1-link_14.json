        "text": "The Grand Ronde Tribal Council was created by the Tribal Constitution to be the primary governing and legislative body of the Tribe. The Council consists of nine standing members, each of which is designated to serve three-year terms. Three Council seats are up for re-election every year. Qualifications for Council members, as defined by the Tribal Constitution, are simply that a person be an enrolled member of the Tribe and be at least 18 years of age. Elections officially take place during the 45 days prior to the September General Council meeting, when ballots are mailed to Tribal members with a verified signature on file with the Tribal Election Board. There are no restrictions on the number of terms a Council member can serve."
