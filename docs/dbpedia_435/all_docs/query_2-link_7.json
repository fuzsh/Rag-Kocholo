        "text": "A Note on Board Service\n\nEvery two years, the legislative body of the Fraternity convenes at Grand Convention to conduct important business, including the election of the members of Grand Council as defined in the Constitution, Article V, Section 1. B. 1. Prior to Grand Convention, the elected nominating committee composed of both college and alumnae chapter delegates meets to review candidates’ applications for board service for both Council and the Fraternity Housing Corporation.\n\nServing on Grand Council—our governing board—is a rewarding volunteer experience that gives Thetas the opportunity for a high level of involvement. Council members are women who lead and make a difference in the lives of Thetas and others everywhere while being responsible for all aspects of Fraternity operations.\n\nFraternity Housing Corporation board members focus on all the housing needs of college chapters.\n\nFoundation Trustees are charged with helping secure and manage resources for Fraternity programs and supporting members to reach their full potential.\n\nIf you’re interested in serving on any governing board, please check this page often for information and updates. This is where you will find governing board job descriptions, a board slating timeline, a map showing nominating committee districts, an interest indicator, and an application that can be filled out for any one of the three governing boards—Council, Fraternity Housing Corporation and Foundation."
