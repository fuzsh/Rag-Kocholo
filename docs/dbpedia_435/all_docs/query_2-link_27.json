Findings\n\nThe Congress finds that—\n\n(1) numerous Indian tribes have become engaged in or have licensed gaming activities on Indian lands as a means of generating tribal governmental revenue;\n\n(2) Federal courts have held that section 81 of this title requires Secretarial review of management contracts dealing with Indian gaming, but does not provide standards for approval of such contracts;\n\n(3) existing Federal law does not provide clear standards or regulations for the conduct of gaming on Indian lands;\n\n(4) a principal goal of Federal Indian policy is to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and strong tribal government; and\n\n(5) Indian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands if the gaming activity is not specifically prohibited by Federal law and is conducted within a State which does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming activity.\n\n(Pub. L. 100–497, §2, Oct. 17, 1988, 102 Stat. 2467.)\n\nShort Title\n\nSection 1 of Pub. L. 100–497 provided: “That this Act [enacting this chapter and sections 1166 to 1168 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure] may be cited as the ‘Indian Gaming Regulatory Act’.”\n\n§2702. Declaration of policy\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is—\n\n(1) to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments;\n\n(2) to provide a statutory basis for the regulation of gaming by an Indian tribe adequate to shield it from organized crime and other corrupting influences, to ensure that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation, and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by both the operator and players; and\n\n(3) to declare that the establishment of independent Federal regulatory authority for gaming on Indian lands, the establishment of Federal standards for gaming on Indian lands, and the establishment of a National Indian Gaming Commission are necessary to meet congressional concerns regarding gaming and to protect such gaming as a means of generating tribal revenue.\n\n(Pub. L. 100–497, §3, Oct. 17, 1988, 102 Stat. 2467.)\n\nReferences in Text\n\nThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning Pub.

Upon receiving such a request, the State shall negotiate with the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.\n\n(B) Any State and any Indian tribe may enter into a Tribal-State compact governing gaming activities on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe, but such compact shall take effect only when notice of approval by the Secretary of such compact has been published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.\n\n(C) Any Tribal-State compact negotiated under subparagraph (A) may include provisions relating to—\n\n(i) the application of the criminal and civil laws and regulations of the Indian tribe or the State that are directly related to, and necessary for, the licensing and regulation of such activity;\n\n(ii) the allocation of criminal and civil jurisdiction between the State and the Indian tribe necessary for the enforcement of such laws and regulations;\n\n(iii) the assessment by the State of such activities in such amounts as are necessary to defray the costs of regulating such activity;\n\n(iv) taxation by the Indian tribe of such activity in amounts comparable to amounts assessed by the State for comparable activities;\n\n(v) remedies for breach of contract;\n\n(vi) standards for the operation of such activity and maintenance of the gaming facility, including licensing; and\n\n(vii) any other subjects that are directly related to the operation of gaming activities.\n\n(4) Except for any assessments that may be agreed to under paragraph (3)(C)(iii) of this subsection, nothing in this section shall be interpreted as conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions authority to impose any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an Indian tribe to engage in a class III activity. No State may refuse to enter into the negotiations described in paragraph (3)(A) based upon the lack of authority in such State, or its political subdivisions, to impose such a tax, fee, charge, or other assessment.\n\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall impair the right of an Indian tribe to regulate class III gaming on its Indian lands concurrently with the State, except to the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with, or less stringent than, the State laws and regulations made applicable by any Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe under paragraph (3) that is in effect.\n\n(6) The provisions of section 1175 of title 15 shall not apply to any gaming conducted under a Tribal-State compact that—\n\n(A) is entered into under paragraph (3) by a State in which gambling devices are legal, and\n\n(B) is in effect.\n\n(7)(A) The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over—\n\n(i) any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct such negotiations in good faith,\n\n(ii) any cause of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin a class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) that is in effect, and\n\n(iii) any cause of action initiated by the Secretary to enforce the procedures prescribed under subparagraph (B)(vii).\n\n(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described in subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiations under paragraph (3)(A).\n\n(ii) In any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), upon the introduction of evidence by an Indian tribe that—\n\n(I) a Tribal-State compact has not been entered into under paragraph (3), and\n\n(II) the State did not respond to the request of the Indian tribe to negotiate such a compact or did not respond to such request in good faith,\n\nthe burden of proof shall be upon the State to prove that the State has negotiated with the Indian tribe in good faith to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities.\n\n(iii) If, in any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), the court finds that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribe to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities, the court shall order the State and the Indian Tribe 2 to conclude such a compact within a 60-day period. In determining in such an action whether a State has negotiated in good faith, the court—\n\n(I) may take into account the public interest, public safety, criminality, financial integrity, and adverse economic impacts on existing gaming activities, and\n\n(II) shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not negotiated in good faith.\n\n(iv) If a State and an Indian tribe fail to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities on the Indian lands subject to the jurisdiction of such Indian tribe within the 60-day period provided in the order of a court issued under clause (iii), the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact that represents their last best offer for a compact.

The Chairman's review and approval of such contract shall be governed by the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (h) of section 2711 of this title.\n\n(e) Approval of ordinances\n\nFor purposes of this section, by not later than the date that is 90 days after the date on which any tribal gaming ordinance or resolution is submitted to the Chairman, the Chairman shall approve such ordinance or resolution if it meets the requirements of this section. Any such ordinance or resolution not acted upon at the end of that 90-day period shall be considered to have been approved by the Chairman, but only to the extent such ordinance or resolution is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(Pub.
