Our members will ask her questions on her portfolio and will later assess her answers and overall presentation. Based on this assessment, our Group will make a decision on whether Mrs. Ivanova is suitable for the position of European Commissioner for innovation, research, culture, education and youth until the end of this mandate.\n\nOn Thursday, 7 September, the EP committee on industry, research and energy is voting on its report on the legislative proposal made by the European Commission on critical raw materials. This piece of legislation is crucial for the future of our industry. Our negotiator on the file is vice-president of our Group Mohammed Chahim. He has included provisions, which have considerably improved the initial text, thus ensuring there will be no disruption to the supply of critical raw materials to European industry. EU leadership in world markets, especially in high-tech industries, depends on critical raw materials.\n\nAlso on Thursday, 7 September, we are gearing up to another crucial parliamentary committee vote, this time in the EP committee on culture and education, where its members will cast their votes on the European Media Freedom Act. Our negotiator on this proposal for regulation, made by the European Commission, is our co-coordinator in this committee Petra Kammerevert. In the process of the negotiations she secured the ambitious rule which guarantees the autonomy and editorial independence of public service media; internal safeguards for private media service providers, including press, and the independence of the new European Board for Media Services from national governments and the Commission.\n\nDuring Thursday’s session of the constitutional affairs committee (AFCO), members will vote to amend Parliament’s rules of procedure with a view to strengthening integrity, independence and accountability. S&D vice-president and vice-chair of the AFCO committee, Gaby Bischoff, is the lead MEP on changes to the EP’s rules of procedure.\n\nOn Wednesday, 6 September, we are organising a conference on the state of the social union. Hosted by our President Iratxe García, it will be an opportunity to discuss our plan to ensure social and climate justice for all Europeans, and to reaffirm our solidarity with Ukraine. We will talk about our progressive achievements and projects with a string of distinguished guest speakers – among them first vice-president of the Spanish government Nadia Calviño Santamaría and third deputy prime minister of Spain Teresa Ribera, European Trade Union Confederation’s general secretary Esther Lynch, White House senior adviser for clean energy innovation and implementation John D. Podesta, and trade union representatives from Ukraine."
