        "text": "For other uses, see Ruling Council and Imperial Council.\n\nThe Imperial Ruling Council, also referred to as the Imperial Advisory Council or the Imperial Council, was a collective body of bureaucrats composed of Emperor Sheev Palpatine's closest advisors including, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, acting Commander-in-Chief Darth Vader, Sate Pestage, Janus Greejatus, Ars Dangor, Kren Blista-Vanee, Verge, and other members of the Imperial Court, who oversaw the daily affairs of the Galactic Empire, and wielded considerable powers.\n\nThe council was headquartered on Coruscant, the capital world of the Empire. Members of the Ruling Council were noted for wearing loose-fitting robes of riotous colors and flamboyant hats.\n\nHistory[]\n\nGoverning the Empire[]\n\nMass Amedda was one of the first members to join the Ruling Council.[7] By 14 BBY the Council also included Emperor's advisers Ars Dangor, Janus Greejatus, Kren Blista-Vanee and Sate Pestage as well as Administrator Sly Moore.[1] Other members during the early Imperial era included Prelate Verge,[9] Imperial Agriculture Ministry official Sim Aloo,[10] and another member.[11]\n\nIn 0 BBY, the Chief of the Imperial Navy, Conan Antonio Motti, submitted an incident report,[12] criticizing the acting Commander-in-Chief,[13] Darth Vader,[14] shortly after the admiral was Force-choked by the Dark Lord for his insolence.[15]\n\nGovernor Everi Chalis served as an emissary to the Imperial Ruling Council during the Galactic Civil War. At some point, she was demoted to a position on Haidoral Prime and eventually defected to the Rebellion.[9]\n\nIn 4 ABY, Six members the Imperial Ruling Council, including advisors Sim Aloo and Janus Greejatus, accompanied Emperor Palpatine to the second Death Star, where he was greeted by Lord Vader and scores of Imperial officers and troops. However, all six dignitaries died when the station was destroyed by the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Endor.[5]\n\nFall from grace[]\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, ambitious members of the Imperial Council attempted to carve their own territories out of the Empire.[11] Due to their inability to successfully run the Empire after the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Lord Vader, Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax proposed the creation of a more covert and militaristic body known as the \"Shadow Council\" to replace them, comprised of various advisors and admirals, with Grand Admiral Rae Sloane as the group's de facto leader.[2] Grand Vizier Mas Amedda was thus reduced to a mere figurehead, puppeteered by Counselor Rax to broadcast propaganda speeches.[2]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nMain article: Shadow Council\n\nThe Shadow Council came to replace the failed Imperial Ruling Council as a covert ruling body.[2]\n\nDuring the New Republic Era, the members of the council were responsible for their own sectors and maintained an illusion of working as unorganized remnant warlords to conceal their strength as they awaited Grand Admiral Thrawn return.[16]\n\nPowers[]\n\nSome observers saw the councilors as mere \"yes men\" to the Emperor. But in fact, it was the Imperial Ruling Council that managed the daily affairs of the Empire, and the officials within its ranks wielded considerable powers.[1] They had direct access to the Emperor and acted as his deputies,[17] with all Moffs, generals, admirals and other upper-level figures reporting to them in turn. Some members of the cabinet were charged with overseeing martial aspects,[18] and notified the sovereign on new developments within the Imperial Military. In spite of their authority, the councilors were not always privy to the details known to the Imperial Intelligence, as information was closely guarded on Coruscant.[1]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSources[]\n\nStar Wars Helmet Collection 10 (Weapons & Uniforms: Imperial Dignitaries)\n\nStar Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy\n\nStar Wars: Rogue One: Rebel Dossier\n\nStar Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z\n\nStar Wars Bust Collection 1 (Star Wars Universe: Darth Vader) (Picture only)\n\nGadgets and Gear\n\nStar Wars: Timelines\n\nStar Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire\n\nNotes and references[]"
