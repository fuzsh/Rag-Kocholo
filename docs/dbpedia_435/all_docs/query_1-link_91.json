        "text": "Clerk of the Court of Appeals\n\nThe Clerk's Office receives all filings and maintains the dockets and files pertaining to all cases filed in the Court of Appeals, including attorney discipline matters. The office also processes applications for admission to the bar of this court with or without examination, including administering the twice-yearly bar examination; arranges the scheduling of cases for argument or submission without argument (called \"calendaring\"); coordinates the issuance of opinions and other decisional orders and judgments; coordinates the processing of petitions for rehearing by the court; coordinates the appointment of and payment to attorneys appointed under the Criminal Justice Act and Counsel for Child Abuse and Neglect programs to represent indigent parties with appeals in this court; and manages the budget and facilities of and conducts the contracting and purchasing for the court.\n\nA division of the Clerk's Office provides staff support for the Court's Committee on Admissions and Committee on Unauthorized Practice of Law. Staff receives and processes applications for admission to the bar and certifies applicants for admission to the bar of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The Committee on the Unauthorized Practice of Law investigates complaints against persons who are alleged to be engaging in the practice of law without a license and monitors motions made by attorneys who are not members of the bar of this court for permission to appear in the District of Columbia Courts regarding a particular matter or case (called pro hac vice admission).\n\nThe Clerk’s Office of the Court of Appeals is divided into five components: the public office, case management, the immediate office, the staff of the Committees on Admissions and the Unauthorized Practice of Law, and the administrative staff. Functionally, these components are involved in three major activities: case processing; bar admissions and unauthorized practice of law matters; and court administration.\n\nPublic Office - The Public Office receives incoming documents, dockets pleadings, maintains official case files, receives and answers public inquiries, provides internal mail service, and supports courtroom operations.\n\nCase Management Division - The Case Management Division oversees the processing of cases prior to calendaring for argument or submission without argument. The process includes motions matters, briefing schedules, deadlines, and those matters expedited by order of the court. The division reviews incoming motions and pleadings and prepares proposed orders, sua sponte (initiated by the court) or in response to motions filed by the parties, for approval by the Clerk, Chief Judge, or a motions division (comprised of three judges). Attorneys in the division provide legal analyses (and recommended dispositions) in substantive motions, emergency matters, and matters brought under the court's original and discretionary jurisdictions.\n\nImmediate Office - The Immediate Office, which includes the Clerk and the Chief Deputy Clerk, handles the general administration of the Clerk’s Office; coordinates the processing of appeals after briefing (calendaring, case screening, and processing motions and orders in calendared matters); coordinates the issuance of opinions and mandates, petitions for rehearing and/or rehearing en banc; processes bar-related disciplinary, admissions, and unauthorized practice of law matters; and prepares court statistics.\n\nCommittee on Admissions and the Committee on the Unauthorized Practice of Law - The staff of the Committee on Admissions and the Committee on Unauthorized Practice of Law administers the Bar examination; processes applications for admission to the Bar by examination and motion, applications for authorization to practice as special legal consultants, applications by law students to practice under DC App. R. 48, and motions to practice law pro hac vice (in a particular case); collects admissions and related fees; provides staff support for the investigation of complaints against unauthorized persons practicing law; and provides support to the two committees; which ensure that local legal needs are met by properly qualified and licensed attorneys.\n\nAdministrative Office - The administrative staff is responsible for budget and accounting, personnel, information technology, telecommunications, library, procurement, and facilities management services for the Court."
