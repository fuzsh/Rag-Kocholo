        "text": "It’s been 14 years since comedy icon Lydia Sum passed away from liver cancer at the age of 60.\n\nAt that time, Hongkong press reported that the beloved star's HK$64mil (S$11mil) fortune would go to her only child Joyce Cheng when the latter turns 35.\n\nIt's said that Lydia was worried that Joyce, who was then 21, would squander the money away.\n\nJoyce, who is Lydia's kid with ex-husband veteran actor Adam Cheng, will turn 35 in May.\n\nJoyce looks so much like her mum\n\nLast weekend, Joyce Instagrammed a throwback photo of herself with her mum on the latter's death anniversary. In her caption, she recalled how she was a “mischievous” child who could only be controlled by her mum.\n\n“She only needed to call my name or glare at me before I quietened down. She would punish me when I did something wrong, and when I started to feel guilty for what I did, she would ask me over and give me a kiss,\" wrote Joyce.\n\nAccording to Joyce, Lydia would then explain to her why she reacted in that way. She would also tell Joyce that hitting her daughter hurt herself more than it did the little girl.\n\n“The older I get, the more I cherish how my mum would never give up on nor leave me regardless of how naughty I was or how much I disappointed her. She would always call me over and give me a kiss.”"
