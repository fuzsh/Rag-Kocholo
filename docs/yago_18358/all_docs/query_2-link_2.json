        "text": "Life does not come easy to those who have famous parents, especially for someone like Joyce Cheng (鄭欣宜), the daughter of legendary actor-singer Adam Cheng (鄭少秋) and the late Hong Kong comedian Lydia Shum (沉澱霞). Joyce has to constantly try to walk out of the shadows of her mother and father.\n\nThe frequent comparisons between Joyce and her parents was one of the reasons why she considered leaving the industry in 2013, when she left TVB management after her contract expired. “I used to think about my actions, and whether it would affect my parents, whether or not I’ll be liked. Because of the excessive thoughts, I wasn’t able to focus on my work. I could not focus on my music and acting.”\n\nIt was Joyce’s family and friends who told her that seeing her leave the industry would be a big waste of talent. “Little by little, they gave me more courage to continue,” said Joyce. “They made me believe that I do belong here.” It was around this time when Joyce met Stephen Shiu Jr (蕭定一), and signed a new management contract with China 3D Digital Entertainment.\n\nJoyce continued, “I’ve come to realize that I really owe a lot to my viewers and fans, as they gave me their most precious thing – time. I used to be preoccupied about worrying my appearance on stage, my expressions, and whether or not I’ll be liked by the audience. Worrying about all these things would not help me focus on my performance. I should be engaged in it, and enjoy it.”\n\nAfter joining China 3D Digital Entertainment, Joyce has finally found a new way to live – and that is to be herself. She gained weight, starred in movies, and released new, upbeat music. Her latest single “Stupid With You” is an upbeat, lighthearted pop song featuring close friend Hanjin Tan (陳奐仁), who also wrote and produced the song.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript\n\nWatch on\n\n“I’ve noticed Hanjin since I debuted in the industry. I really admire his music, and his songs are usually very upbeat. I enjoy fast songs, so I’ve always wanted to work with him,” said Joyce. “I never had the opportunity to do so until now.”\n\nBefore signing with China 3D, Joyce’s former record label favored sad love songs, and that became the genre and style of music Joyce was known for. Joyce won numerous music accolades and was also a best-selling singer. Despite these achievements, it was hard for Joyce to find happiness.\n\n“I like to play music once I get up from bed. Listening to music in the morning brings out the positivity in you, and it’ll be the start of a new day. When I used to sing sad songs, it was hard to train my voice because the songs made me unhappy. When you’re a singer, you also have to be an actor because you have to make the listeners understand the story of the song you’re singing. That really affected me emotionally.”\n\nA fake, idealized image was what Joyce used to carry in the past, but now, the 27-year-old said she can finally take a break from all the acting, and go back to who she truly is. “If I do speak up, people can start talking about it. Maybe my suggestion will not receive total acceptance, but if I don’t try, I’ll never get the opportunity.”\n\nSource: Sina.com"
