        "text": "Joyce Cheng, the daughter of Adam Cheng and the late Lydia Shum, has revealed that she will be holding her first solo concert eight years after her debut.\n\nDue to her chubbier figure, she was criticised for her weight during her early days as she was heavier than most female celebrities. She then started losing weight but declared in 2014 that she would no longer pay attention to her weight and stay true to herself.\n\nIn 2005, she kissed actor Ron Ng on the cheek during an awards presentation, which drew a large number of complaints. Looking back on what happened, Joyce shared that she was unhappy with both netizens and the public. \"Both parties hurt me and didn't understand me, so I hated them a lot.\"\n\nSpeaking to the media recently, she revealed, \"There have been a lot of problems in the past two years; it's just that people don't know about them.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I won't pick at old wounds just so that everyone can learn about them. It's exactly because they hurt that I want to rip off the bandage (and deal with them), if I leave it alone it will only fester and become a bigger problem in the future.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Joyce teared up numerous times when speaking about her late mother who passed away the year she debuted. Now that she will be holding her first concert, the 29-year-old shared that she has avoided using her parents' names to boost her career, but that \"in reality, the person who has had the biggest impact on me and is the best is still my mother. I have to say this no matter what.\"\n\nShe added, \"I think it's an insult (that people ask if I've asked for my father's help) because I've never thought of doing so. I want to step out of their shadows and I've always relied on myself. If my mother were still alive, I'm sure that she would want me to rely on my own abilities to achieve what I want.\"\n\nPhotos: PBE Media, TPG/CLICKPHOTOS"
