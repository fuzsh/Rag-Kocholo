        "text": "15th June 2023 – (Hong Kong) 36-yer-old Joyce Cheng Yan-yee, the Hong Kong-Canadian singer and actress, has been making waves in her career in recent years, culminating in her winning several awards last month last month. However, Cheng has been absent from public appearances for the past two months due to reported health issues. Cheng missed the award ceremony due to her illness, and she has not revealed any updates on her condition or any acceptance speeches since.\n\nCheng’s last social media update was a photo with her hairstylist Benjamin on 26th April, Since then, she has been incommunicado, leading to rumours that she may be avoiding work due to her illness or that she is too preoccupied with her boyfriend, Derek. Reports suggest that Derek, who is three years older than Cheng, used to study in the UK and now runs a flower shop in Hong Kong. On Valentine’s Day this year, Cheng even posted a photo of herself in front of her boyfriend’s flower shop.\n\nCheng has been keeping a low profile and has not been seen in public for the past two months. Even on her birthday last week, she was spotted only with her boyfriend and hairstylist at a theme park in Japan, keeping a low profile. When contacted by the media, her manager explained that Cheng is simply ill and needs time to rest."
