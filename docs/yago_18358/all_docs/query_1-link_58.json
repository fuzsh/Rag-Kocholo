        "text": "26th April 2023 – (Hong Kong) 35-year-old Hong Kong singer Joyce Cheng sparks dating rumours with foreign hairstylist Benjamin after posting intimate photos of their staycation on Instagram. The two have been linked romantically for several years and have been seen exhibiting close behavior both professionally and personally. Fans have long speculated that they are a couple.\n\nIn the photos, Cheng can be seen embracing Benjamin and the pair appears to be very happy together. Benjamin’s social media accounts also feature many photos of Cheng, suggesting a close relationship between the two. While there is no official confirmation of their relationship, the photos have caused a stir among fans.\n\nJoyce Cheng Yan-yee, a singer and actress based in Hong Kong, has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry. Born on 30th May 1987, Cheng is the daughter of the late Hong Kong comedian Lydia Shum and singer/actor Adam Cheng. She guest-starred in “Off Pedder” in 2010 and performed in all three of the sold-out shows. In February 2015, Cheng released her song, “Are You Skinny Enough?” which received a great response. She released another song, “Girl God,” in April 2016, which she directed herself and won her competitors. The music video received 2.3 million hits on YouTube. In 2017, Cheng played a breast cancer patient in the film “29+1.” She ended her contract with TVB on 1 November 2017 and held her first Red Pavilion concert, “Break A Leg Joyce Cheng Concert 2018,” on 22nd April 2018. Cheng’s highly anticipated single, “@princejoyce,” was released on 22nd February 2021."
