        "text": "Hong Kong singer Joyce Cheng turned 35 on May 30. This would not be a big deal if not for the fact that turning 35 would mean that Cheng will finally gain access to her later mother Lydia Shum’s HK$60 million fortune.\n\nAccording to Lydia’s will, Joyce is only allowed to withdraw HK$20,000 of her inheritance every month until she turns 35. When Lydia fell sick, Joyce was only 21 years old and that is why her mother decided that she should have the money later on once she became a competent professional and not before.\n\nDespite struggling with monthly living expenses due to rising costs and only having HK$26 HKD left in her bank account, the singer still did not ask her biological father Adam Cheng for help.\n\nJoyce has achieved tremendous success in her singing career winning multiple music awards in the Hong Kong music industry.\n\nHer first music video Kaau Zi Gei (literally Depend on Myself) aired on the TVB prime time show Scoop in 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Cheng performed in the Tung Wah charity fundraising telethon, raising HK$310,000, which included a special HK$10,000 from her mother, Lydia Shum.\n\nCheng released her debut album on 6 January 2011.\n\nIn April 2016, Cheng released a new song Girl God, which was well received and subsequently she went on to direct her own music video for the first time. The music video reached 2.3 million hits on YouTube. Since then, the song has also been on the charts on major online music platforms and radio stations, becoming Cheng’s first four-channel champion song. After that, it swept the song awards of the four major award ceremonies, and won the favorite female singer music award for the first time.\n\nOn November 1, 2017, Cheng ended her contract with TVB. She then held her first Red Pavilion concert in 2018, titled Break A Leg Joyce Cheng.\n\nOn Feb 22, 2021, Cheng released her highly anticipated single, “@princejoyce.\n\nTickets for her upcoming concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum in June have already been sold out for the three dates within the first three hours of release.\n\nWith her birthday ringing in exciting new developments, Joyce said, “Thank you everyone for all your blessings! I’m 35 years old today! I wish everyone and myself good health and happy things to happen every day.”"
