        "text": "Abstract\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in chronic sensorimotor, cognitive, psychosocial, and communication challenges that can limit social participation. Social media can be a useful outlet for social participation for individuals with TBI, but there are barriers to access. While research has drawn attention to the nature of access barriers, few studies have investigated technological solutions to address these barriers, particularly considering the perspectives of individuals with TBI. To address this gap in knowledge, we used a participatory approach to engage 10 adults with TBI in conceptualizing tools to address their challenges accessing Facebook. Participants described multifaceted challenges in using social media, including interface overload, social comparisons, and anxiety over self-presentation and communication after injury. They discussed their needs and preferences and generated ideas for design solutions. Our work contributes to designing assistive and accessibility technology to facilitate an equal access to the benefits of social media for individuals with TBI.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nMP4 File (3544548.3581222-talk-video.mp4)\n\nPre-recorded Video Presentation\n\nDownload\n\n126.51 MB\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nReihaneh Ahmadi, Hajin Lim, Bilge Mutlu, Melissa Duff, Catalina Toma, and Lyn Turkstra. 2022.
