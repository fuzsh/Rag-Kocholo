        "text": "1995 - MUSIC IS MY WORLD\n\n…Your fingers touched the strings of my heart and made it sing again… (From “A Thousand Dreams of You”, by Francis Fats Waller/Louis Armstrong)\n\nChinese New Year Film\n\nClifton Ko was a bit upset with Leslie because Leslie had rejected his offer to act in his new Chinese New Year film. This was because Leslie had to go to Mainland China for a new project with Chen Kaige. Clifton said that he had given a cheque to Leslie as a down payment and he would sue Leslie for the rejection. Leslie said he had never cleared the cheque and added that he did not want to have trouble with anyone especially people in the showbiz. So he hoped that he would not have any problem with Clifton Ko. Hence in 1995, Leslie did not act in Clifton Ko’s Chinese New Year film. However, he had acted in another Chinese New Year movie “The Chinese Feast” (directed by Tsui Hark) with co-stars Anita Yuen, Kenny Bee, and Vincent Zhao Wen Zhou, the kung fu champion from Beijing who was orbited to fame by Tsui Hark as the new “Huang Fei Hung”. The film was hilarious. Tsui Hark’s film was different from other Hong Kong comedy. It was neat and it was so clear that prolific director Tsui Hark always paid attention to details - music, costume, scenario and also the food. Leslie introduced Vincent Zhao Wen Zhou to Anita Mui. Vincent and Anita then became an item. Leslie had a destiny with director Chen Kaige. He was intended to cast for a renowned poet of ancient China. However Chen Kaige had put aside that project and he started to produce a film based on a story which had been on his mind since the end of 1993. He made this film especially for Leslie.\n\nCome Back to Music\n\nAlthough Leslie enjoyed his film career, yet there was something missing for him. A brilliant singer like him should do recording. Many recording companies offered him the opportunities. “Well, in 1995, I was at my good friend Emil Chow Hua Chien’s concert. I also met Chris (Babida), my old band leader there and the atmosphere was great. I saw them together and thought, \"Gosh!! This is wonderful. I want it again. I was very stubborn and the recording company took 2 years to convince me to make a comeback,” Leslie said. And finally Leslie chose Rock Record and Tapes, a Taiwanese based recording company.\n\nAn interview was held in 1995, just before he released his album “Love Leslie”. The interviewer was Brenda. May be it was fated. Seven years ago, she also had an interview with Leslie in his Hong Kong house. They talked a lot that night. He told her that he had already decided to quit his entertainment career and immigrate to Canada. For this interview, they chatted in his Vancouver house where Leslie told her that he would sing again. Then Brenda queried as to why he had quitted his career when it was at its peak. Was it because of the pressure and the social relationship between people? Also, whether he had attained what he had wanted in these 7 years?\n\nLeslie: Yes, I am very happy that I don’t feel as stressed in my work now. Seven years ago, I had to face the public and media all the time. The pressure was really unbearable at times. At that time, I had a goal. I wanted to take a rest; I didn’t want to sing and act anymore. At last, I made up a major decision to quit singing. After a long rest, someone came up and asked me to make movies again, and when I came back to Hong Kong, I realized that everything was different from before. I had more choices and my expectation had changed. Therefore, I continue to make movies.\n\nBrenda: It is very interesting to watch your earlier movies. From some teenage movies to Tsui Hark (the A Chinese Ghost Story’s producer), Wong Kar Wai, Chen Kaige, it seems that every time you choose a movie, you ‘calculate’ it well. What is your criterion in choosing a movie?\n\nLeslie: I do not have any special criteria. I will never say that I will only work for some well-known directors to make some artistic movies. In my dictionary, movies have no commercial or artistic values. An excellent movie has the combination of both - for example people would be entertained and educated by it at the same time. Perhaps Hong Kong is a commercial city. Thus, sometimes when people make movies, they will consider money first and therefore the quality is of secondary importance. I must say I am very fortunate to make “Farewell”. Before my return to Hong Kong, Chen found me. However, at that time, we had some problems in the contract and I eventually rejected the film offer. They then asked me again and well I thought that all we wanted was to film a good movie with a great script. I finally accepted the role. I did not think it would be that successful as I just wanted to work with Chen.\n\nBrenda: Before you made “Farewell”, how much did you know about Chen? Did you have confidence in him?\n\nLeslie: I did some research before working with him; I watched some of his movies and realized that he also had his own dream. After we worked together, we found that we had a lot in common and eventually became good friends. He said he wanted all his movies to have me as his actor. I am very glad that there is a director who has so much confidence in me. We know that we will work together again in the future.\n\nBrenda: How do you compare your musical career with that of your movie? Is there a link between them? Is the script an important issue in choosing a movie?\n\nLeslie: Yes, the script is the most important thing. Also, teamwork is required in a movie. I am more matured now because I realize that a person can’t always be alone. One needs to cooperate with other in order to be successful. When I listened to my songs of the 80s, I found that there were lots of flaws in my singing skill.\n\nBrenda: You come back after a long break. How do you deal with promotion? And how do you evaluate yourself and satisfy your fans?\n\nLeslie: My age can’t go back. I have a higher expectation for myself. I have become more objective in viewing my career. Now, I have only movies to support my career. I will be more low-profiled than before - for example, I will not do too much promotion or attend any musical ceremonies. Thus, I can only pay more attention on the quality of my production. After all these years, when people buy my CDs, what is their expectation? I wish that both my fans and I could improve. Most of my fans are grown-ups so their thoughts are not the same 7 years ago. Of course, I know there are some young fans, too. Since I am so lucky to have such a wide range of audiences, I have to be more focused on my production.\n\nBrenda: During all these years, there must be lot of companies who had asked you to join them: why did you choose Rock?\n\nLeslie: It is mainly because of their sincerity. They agree that I do not need to do too many promotions and they also give me freedom. I think there are not many music companies who can do that. I am upset when the media only focused on how much money I would earn upon signing the contract. I think money for me now is not the most important issue. Rock is a Taiwanese-based company, but they give me (being a Hong Kong singer) the feeling that I am very important to them. They really touched me.\n\nBrenda: Also, you can see that they have made every effort in producing singers’ albums.\n\nLeslie: Yeah, the quality is good. If I were a consumer, I don’t want to buy a low quality product.\n\nBrenda: Your point is well taken. However, not many fans in Hong Kong know how to distinguish between good and bad music. Maybe your target and market is not them.\n\nLeslie: I don’t really care about Hong Kong market. I know it is very irresponsible to say this, but it is true. My next album is going to be a Mandarin one. I am also very surprised when Rock approached me and asked me to concentrate on Mandarin albums (Note: Previously, Leslie hit songs were all Cantonese). Brenda, if you were the head of the company, will you ask Leslie Cheung to produce Cantonese albums rather than Mandarin ones?\n\nBrenda: Of course, and the songs will also be much commercialized, too.\n\nLeslie: It proves that Rock doesn’t treat me like a moneymaking artist.\n\nOn one night at Si Hua Hotel ballroom, Taipei, Taiwan, Leslie Cheung announced his comeback to the music world as a singer. It needed a real strong mental to do this. Since he left the stage in the early 1990s, his shoes which left footprints of a good-looking singer who could sing and dance well, were never worn by other artists. So it was no wonder that Leslie’s comeback was greatly welcomed by music’s lovers. That night Leslie met 200 reporters from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and South East Asia - all were invited by Rock Record and Tapes. The reporters faced him like they were facing an old enemy. “Why must you slap your own face?” they asked. They reported that Leslie pulled a long face at them on hearing this question. Leslie didn’t like it. Most of them wrote negative reports which made non-fans to dislike Leslie. It was fortunate that Leslie’s handsome face was shown on the reports. At that time Leslie wore a white suit and a pair of white Nike shoes. He said he was more matured and he had a new thinking. He also said that his singing technique was far better than six years ago. He only wanted to sing his level best. President director Rock Record & Tapes International, Mr. Cing Than gave three watches as souvenirs to mark 100 years of film to Leslie. Other Rock’s important person - Mr. Luk Sao Chang was in attendance on this important night. Rock said that Leslie was the artiste with the highest honor and the cost of his album production was also the highest. It was rumoured that the price of Leslie’s contract had reached the 50 HK million dollar mark. In three years, Leslie would be making three albums and three video clips respectively. Besides that, Leslie did not need to do any other promotions. They gave Leslie a free hand with no pressure at all.\n\nIntrusions on Private Life\n\nWhen Leslie was in Taipei, he asked his good friend Daffy Tong to occupy his house as Leslie didn’t like to leave his house vacant. There was a reporter who headlined this in the news by writing that Tong was Leslie’s 'gay partner’. They traced Tong’s background from the time he worked in a bank and they followed him wherever he went. Leslie said it was alright if the reporter followed Tong if he was a celebrity like him. He didn’t want the reporters following Daffy to and from the office from morning till night. Sometimes Leslie would pick up Tong at his working place. Sometimes before meeting Tong, Leslie would be drinking his favourite drink - orange juice mixed with carrot juice in a restaurant. One day when Leslie was with Tong in his lovely Porsche, the reporter directed his camera towards Tong. Leslie immediately gave chase to the reporter, but his Porsche was badly hit by the reporter’s car with a dent in the front left side.\n\nThe reporters then wrote about Leslie’s HK$ 26 million house in Turtle Cove Bay no.2, where he was captivated by the scenery of the sea between Hong Kong and Macau. Leslie had told his close friends that this was his 'Dream House’. The garage could accommodate 5 cars. The house had 5 spacious bedrooms. How about this way - it was also reported that Leslie’s May Towers apartment was seemingly a gift from his godmother. They also published photos of Leslie’s house in Canada. Many tourists went to Leslie’s house because the photos appeared in magazines. This intruded on Leslie’s life and finally this house had to be sold and it went for a good price. Leslie had bought his Turtle Cove property for HKD 26 million in 1995 and sold it for HKD 68 million in 1997.\n\nIn an interview, Leslie denied the news that he had received a lot of money from his godmother. However, he did not deny that he had a close relationship with his godmother. He often gave his godmother surprises. For example, Leslie returned to Hong Kong from Canada on the eve of her birthday. He phoned his godmother and apologized for not being able to attend her birthday as he was in Canada but at the stroke of midnight, he knocked on the door of his godmother’s residence and offered himself as a present for his godmother, Irene Tam. He often played mahjong with her.\n\nPhantom Lover\n\n“'Phantom Lover’ is amazing, this is a very personal movie and with Leslie, this was something we both wanted to do, that’s why he also produced and wrote all the songs,” Ronny Yu said this to the reporter.\n\nIn May 1995, Leslie starred again in another film directed by Ronny Yu - “Phantom Lover” (which was a re-make of the classic China movie directed by Maxu Weibang, “Song At Midnight”). As depicted in the story line of this film, Leslie appeared with a half broken face because of burnt wounds. Ronny commented, “He is absolutely a brave actor. He has nothing to hide, he doesn’t care what other people will say, and has full confidence. Above all, he has an amazing charisma. When Raymond Wong talked with me about this project for the second time (I refused when he offered this project for the first time) - I told Leslie about it and he had no doubts in getting involved in it. Of course he knew he must appear with an ugly face in the film, but he liked the challenges. He dedicated himself totally in this project and offered to write the soundtrack. I changed many scenarios. I concentrated in the love story and eliminated the parts regarding the Japanese invasion.” Leslie’s co-star in this film was Taiwanese actress Jacqueline Ng (Wu Chien Lien) who was later nominated as Hong Kong best actress for her appearance in this film. Leslie was actually a producer of this film. Also starring in the film was Mainland Chinese young star, Huang Lei. “Phantom Lover” was screened for the first time on 22 July 1995.\n\n“Dan”\n\nAn internationally renowned director had once remarked that in the then Chinese movie world, only two actors could play the feminine roles “dan” in Chinese Opera. They were Leslie Cheung and John Lone. It was surprising to note that Beijing Opera professors in Shanghai had high regards for Leslie. They thought Leslie had studied Opera before. The photo of Leslie as Cheng Dieyi (a famous “dan” in the Beijing Opera) playing the role of Concubine Yu in “Farewell My Concubine” was published in “Movie Picture”, a leading entertainment weekly magazine in Europe for US$20,000. Since then, the Europeans regarded Leslie’s long and expressive eyes (from the photo) as “Eyes of Phoenix” and his English name 'Leslie’ had become widely known in the western movie world. Movie critics concluded that John was profound and handsome whereas the beauty of Leslie was expressed in a much softer and subtle way.\n\nWhenever Leslie visited Beijing, he would always try to contact his Beijing opera tutor in the film “Farewell” - Shi Yan-sheng and his wife Zhang Man-ling. He would definitely visit them no matter how busy he was. Everybody would be very happy even though he could chat with them for a little while or brought them to dinner. They used to talk over the phone on every Lunar New Year. Zhang Man-ling said that Leslie was a person who needed love, warmth and truth. He was pretty naïve in front of them, like a child. When Leslie came to their house, he would sit or kneel down on the floor, chatting with them freely. Zhang Man-ling used to fry sliced radish for him. He enjoyed them very much. When he moved to a new house in the same year, Shi and his wife wanted to send him a house-warming gift. He told them they didn’t have to send anything but a pair of slippers. In Hong Kong, slippers signified dragging away bad luck. Zhang went to a shopping arcade and bought a pair of leather slippers for him.\n\nTemptress Moon\n\n“Temptress Moon” was the sixth Chen Kaige film. It was the most difficult film in the making process and also the most expensive because it incurred US$7 million or two times the budget of “Farewell My Concubine”. It was also the film which required the longest time in the making as Chen Kaige had written the scenes in April 1993 but the shooting only commenced in August 1994. The shooting process was halted because of technological difficulties and resumed again in April 1995 - it took 3 years to complete filming this movie. Leslie Cheung was the leading actor of “Temptress Moon” because the role Yu Zhong Liang was tailor-made for him by Chen Kaige. Gong Li was expected to be the leading lady but she couldn’t accept as she was involved in the shooting of “Shanghai Triad” directed by Zhang Yi Mou. Actress Joey Wong and Kwan Pao Huey nominated themselves to be Gong Li’s replacement but Chen Kaige chose Mainland actress Wang Cing Ying. However, in the shooting process Wang couldn’t act well (Chen said to her manager that she was not suitable as per the demand of the script and her manager also confirmed that she couldn’t act well). Hence, the leading lady was replaced by Chen Hung. After two days of shooting, it was discovered that Chen Hung was involved in another contract. Chen Kaige called Gong Li again and she advised that she would be able to manage her schedule to shoot two films. Leslie’s concentration was divided as he had to learn to adapt to three different actresses on 3 occasions. However, he said that he could overcome the situation as a professional actor. Leslie recalled these misfortunes in the making of “Temptress Moon”. These three actresses were screen-tested but actually there were five or six others before Chen asked Gong Li. It was a lot of work for Leslie as he had to go through all of these auditions with them without any extra pay. Leslie said that these changes in the cast added five or six months to the production schedule - a development that made “Temptress Moon” twice as costly as the more elaborate “Farewell My Concubine”.\n\nWith regards to working with Chen Kaige, Leslie said that Chen gave him a free hand working on the set and would discuss with him prior to working on the set. They did a lot of shots. “Temptress Moon” was a different experience as Chen gave him more freedom this time compared to their previous collaboration. They became friends and Chen trusted him. Leslie said that Chen knew more things than him about ancient China or about Beijing but on the contrary Chen was not as knowledgeable about Shanghai. Leslie did not criticize Chen that “Temptress Moon” was not a masterpiece like “Farewell My Concubine” but instead it was a passionate movie. Someone who originated from Beijing would be different from someone who originated from Shanghai and in this case Chen was from Beijing. Shanghai is located in South of China and Beijing is the North of China. There were things that Leslie felt were missed in “Temptress Moon”. Even if Leslie hadn’t been in China before, he realized it and this fact had been confirmed by his friends.\n\nThe cinematographer of “Temptress Moon” was Christopher Doyle. Leslie saw him as a queer guy. In “Temptress Moon” there weren’t static close-ups. Doyle always shot with his hand-camera and was always on the move. They had magic moments together. Undoubtedly Doyle was one of the greatest operators. He was a queer fellow! It was not wise to give too much beer as he would be drunk. Leslie remembered that they must shoot again some shots in “Days of Being Wild” as Doyle was drunk and often passed out.\n\n“Temptress Moon” began with the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, Leslie played Yu Zhongliang, a shirttail kid who was the relative of an extravagantly decadent noble family and became obsessed about taking revenge for being ill-treated. He thought he was more or less like John Malkovich in “Dangerous Liaisons”. The comparison is apt for Leslie’s vengeance was specifically targeted at the family’s beautiful heiress played by Gong Li.\n\nLeslie possessed a special charisma beyond the ordinary appeal of any man and woman. It was a rare combination of the masculine and feminine charm, tough with tenderness, gentle and yet strong. Leslie displayed this kind of charm through the character portrayed by him. Shooting of the movie “Temptress Moon” resumed with Leslie playing the role of Yu Zhongliang, a swindler in Shanghai during the Twenties. Again, we could see his surpassing charm through this character. At the beginning, Leslie meticulously analysed the character of Yu both physically and mentally and he put his heart and soul into portraying the character of Yu Zhongliang.\n\nAs we watched him in Studio No. 6 shooting the scene in which his identity as a woman swindler was disclosed and Ru Yi asked him if he loved his victim at “Tian Xiang Lane”, Yu’s soul was being interrogated and tortured. After a few minutes of silence, he shouted at Ru Yi, “I am no longer a servant of your family.” In an interview with a reporter, Leslie claimed that the several months of delay in shooting gave him an opportunity to understand the character he played. He thought that Yu did not lead an ordinary life. He was void of parental love since childhood. He experienced severe internal conflict upon seeking refuge in his sister’s household. Despite his sensitivity to and yearning for love, love was like poison to Yu. He could not and dared not love. Yu was himself a victim to a certain extent. Leslie’s insight after a few months’ contemplation - Yu Zhong-liang reflected the feeling of a man in its complexity. Love was passionate and harmful, most personal and hence selfish. Love could be strong enough to burn a man to dust. If a man who longed for love but was hurt by it, he would take revenge. It was something embedded in men’s feeling but hard to articulate, and Leslie was talented enough to convey it to his audience. His ability also went beyond ordinary men and actors.\n\nRen-lei\n\nChen Kaige chose Ren-lei as the young Zhong-liang in “Temptress Moon”. Ren-lei was a secondary one student. He believed in luck when people came together. He was born in the year of the monkey, twenty-four years younger than Leslie. Just like Leslie, Ren-lei lacked childhood warmth. Friends who know them well said they were almost identical from appearance to character-wise. When Ren-lei met Leslie for the first time, the young actor was extremely worried during the screen-test for he had no idea whether to call Leslie as 'uncle’ or address him in another way. Leslie pointed out to him that they looked alike. Ren-lei succeeded to take up the role. As he and Leslie shot their scenes separately so they were not as close at the beginning but sometimes they would meet at the hotel. At that time Ren-lei thought Leslie was very approachable to everyone for he broke down the distance and the sense of unfamiliarity between people.\n\nOne thing remained in Ren-lei’s mind clearly. One day he met Leslie in the lift. Leslie asked him, “How much money do you bring for filming?” Ren-lei said he just had slightly over two hundred RMB. “How can you stay for long-time filming with such an amount of money?” Leslie queried. Ren-lei didn’t say a word. Leslie then insisted in giving him some money. There were three children, Ren-lei, one other boy and a girl in the film “Temptress Moon”. Director Chen made a joke that the children could be Leslie’s adopted sons and daughter. Ren-lei was a young and unhappy boy at that time, and used to think that nobody cared for him. One day, he asked Leslie unintentionally, “Uncle Cheung, it’d be great if you’re my godfather.” Leslie agreed to his preposition.\n\nFilming came to a standstill as there was a change of actress in the leading role thus giving Leslie more free time to spend with his new godson. Leslie used to play mahjong and chatted with Ren-lei. Within that period, Ren-lei spoke many things from his heart. As Leslie also did not have a happy childhood and longed for love from his parents, he understood Ren-lei very well. When they filmed at Suzhou, Leslie asked Ren-lei if he had tasted Japanese food. He took him on an hour’s drive to a Japanese restaurant in Shanghai. Ren-lei could feel that his godfather had a warm heart in taking care of people even to the minor details.\n\nSometimes the boy knew that Leslie was unhappy but he had never revealed his unhappiness in front of Ren-lei. He still talked to Ren-lei in a gentle voice though he wasn’t smiling a lot. Ren-lei cried loudly after he returned to Beijing alone from the shooting. He felt it was too soon to say goodbye to a new place that he had already familiarized with. He was extremely sad. He didn’t want to leave. It seemed everything was over like a dream. He had been so down for a few months. Later in that year, Leslie phoned Ren-lei and told the boy he would see him in a hotel. Ren-lei still remembered his facial expression that day when he smiled and said, “I am your godfather.” Ren-lei was touched and shocked at that moment. For Ren Lei, Leslie was the most important person in his life.\n\nLeslie phoned Ren-lei whenever he was in Beijing. “Son, what are you doing? Do you have time to see me?” In Ren-lei eyes, his godfather was a father who was very friendly. When they dined together and it was ten o'clock, he would say, “Son, it’s time to go home.” Then he gave Ren-lei the fee for transportation, and urged him to take care on the road.\n\nAt the beginning of his work in “Temptress Moon”, Ren-lei kept his distance from people and did not have the sense of safety as in the past, but he became more outgoing during the period when he was close to Leslie, even director Chen praised him for acting more and more naturally. Nowadays Ren Lei didn’t go to extremes, and he would maintain a balance no matter how difficult the matter was. All these changes were due to his godfather. He felt Leslie understood and treasured love very well. He could feel Leslie had a true heart by observing how he treated grandma Zhang, grandpa Shi, teacher Sung and those friends in Beijing. His godfather did not look down on people despite his star status and he used to join into a group easily, showing what he wanted in his own way.\n\nLeslie understood Ren-lei’s history and he always taught his godson, “Son, you should love your parents. No matter what’d happen, they are your parents.” Ren-lei noticed Leslie worked very hard during filming of “Temptress Moon”; he kept memorizing the script in a low voice, even when was dining or traveling. He was a perfectionist and set high standards for himself. The person who transformed Ren-lei enabling him to view the world from a positive perspective, dispersed the many contradictions in his heart and influenced him greatly in his life was Leslie.\n\nLove Leslie\n\nThe album “Love Leslie” was launched on 7 July 1995. Most of the songs in this 1995 album “Beloved” were theme songs from the following movies namely: the three beautiful songs from “Phantom Lover” which were well-written by Leslie; “Chase” (which was extremely popular) from the movie “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man”; the excellent theme song of “The Bride with White Hair” sung emotionally in a helpless and desperate mood - hopeless love in the tragedy; the theme song of “Farewell My Concubine”, “When Love Became a Thing in the Past” which was very well sung with all feelings slowly disappearing into the boundless darkness, the theme song from “Days of Being Wild” and finally the theme song from his then new film “Temptress Moon”. Rock spent HK$ 4 million for the album promotion. Within a short time, 210,000 copies of this album had been sold. This album was included in the Top Five Best Selling Album of the Year by IFPI.\n\nLeslie also became very famous in Mainland China. There were traffic jams whenever Leslie was having autography sessions in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities in PROC. In Kaoshiung, Taiwan, 500 fans had been waiting for him at the airport to welcome him with banner in hand. They also queued to get Leslie’s signature. With his return to his music world, Leslie was welcomed back into the warmth of his faithful fans.\n\nBest Actor\n\nFollowing was the list of winners of the “First Hong Kong Film Critics Society”:\n\nBest Film: “Ashes of Time”\n\nBest Director: Wong Kar Wai (“Ashes of Time”)\n\nBest Screenplay: Wong Kar Wai (“Ashes of Time”)\n\nBest Actor: Leslie Cheung (year round performance)\n\nBest Actress: Joan Chen (year round performance)\n\nIn 1995, Leslie was nominated as Best Actor at the 14th HK Golden Film Award for his performance in “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” and was also nominated as Best Actor at the 40th Asia Pacific Film Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia. He was again chosen as the best Hong Kong actor in Japan.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Leslie was a regular patron to many different restaurants such as the Lobby and Harbourside of Regent Hotel; the Peninsula’s luxurious restaurant, a restaurant in Wan Chai, the Victoria City restaurant, other classical Chinese restaurants, renowned for their sophisticated food, which serves excellent dim sum and Sun Dau Kee in Jordan which opens until late at night where one could chat and play mahjong after dinner. He also liked the refined Italian restaurant Cova in Pacific Place.\n\nLeslie’s Party\n\nOn 12 September 1995, Leslie celebrated his 40th birthday merrily. Actually Leslie was 39 years old at that time, but according to Chinese calendar, his age was 40 years old. His countenance with its childlike innocence and sweetness gracefully camouflage the footprints of time and destiny at age 40. Leslie said that he did not believe in plastic surgery or the so-called 'elixir of life’ to restore youth. He said, “I just want to live happily everyday. I am never concerned about my age; it doesn’t mean anything at all!”\n\nIt was clear that Leslie was the entertainer who was very respected by his colleagues. Hong Kong celebrities bringing with them presents came to attend his party and to congratulate him on his birthday. The guests were Anita Mui and her boyfriend Vincent Zhao Wen Zhou, Tsui Hark, Anita Yuen with her boyfriend Julian Cheung, Kenny Be with his wife Teresa Cheung, Carina Lau, John Teng, Shi An Hua, Eliza Chan, Chen Hui Lien, Willie Chan and Chao Ching Ce. Leslie’s hairstylist Ricky Kwok attended with his girlfriend Hillary Shi. Chinese director Chen Kaige met his star Gong Li and producer Hsu Feng on Leslie’s party. Of course Leslie’s family also attended that party including his mother Mrs. Cheung, his godmother Irene Tam and his god-brother Daffy Tong. Leslie arrived at the venue at 6.00 pm. He was immediately welcomed by his fans who showered him with birthday gifts. Leslie’s car was full with gifts and flowers. The atmosphere was very cheerful.\n\nWomen & Anita Yuen\n\nIn an earlier interview, Leslie was asked by a reporter to name a Japanese artist that he would like to work with. Leslie responded that he liked the movie “Silk Snow” made in 1993 and directed by Ishikawa. He also said that he liked all the actresses in the movie but he could not remember their names. As these actresses were all very matured, the reporter asked him if he preferred matured ladies. Leslie said matured women were more charming and he liked things in the old times. The women he liked were women from the era of the 30s and 40s.\n\nAnita Yuen asked Leslie to be her singing teacher. Leslie agreed. They toasted to each other as a sign of their agreement. However because of his tight schedules, Leslie suggested to Anita to learn singing from Roman Tam. The two of them often watched musical show during their learning teaching process. At the end of 1995, Leslie was chosen as the most fashionable artiste taking into consideration his proportionate body with his dashing and attractive looks.\n\nRelationship\n\nLeslie returned to Mainland China to continue the shooting process of “Temptress Moon”. A reporter visited Leslie in the shooting location for three days. They just chit-chatted and the reporter almost forgot to ask him questions. Fortunately Leslie understood his friend’s responsibility and so he started talking on his own accord. He started off the topic talking about relationship.\n\n“I am always not in Hong Kong, so it is really not easy for him. Sometimes I feel that it is very unfair to him, maybe, I should just announce our relationship to the public; this could be of some help. At least I will feel more relaxed. I don’t give a shit to go and lie to anyone. To be together for 15 years is not easy, especially for us working in this field. Moreover we are still so nice to each other. He will come to Mainland China to visit me whenever he finds time, and the feeling is still very sweet. I don’t really mind telling the public about our relationship, I really don’t mind telling the public about our relationship as long as I know that it will give me a touching feeling whenever I review such reports. Others have asked me whether I was afraid that people would exploit me. I would answer 'Go ahead!’, I am already 39 years old, no longer a pop idol, there is nothing to hide at this stage. The time has changed; the audiences want to see a serious actor, nothing to do with an artiste’s personal life.”\n\nIf one observes this pair of young couple of Leslie and his lover, one will really have a feeling that youth passes. When they started dating 10 years ago, friends would raise their thumbs up and praised them saying they were very compatible. There were many people who envied them but there were also many who were very jealous. After so many years of ups and downs, it was not hard to understand the strong foundation of their love. His lover has a successful career and status. Despite his busy schedule, he was willing to spare his time to fly over to Mainland China to visit Leslie, and from this fact you could understand his love towards Leslie. Their love and relationship could never be destroyed by anyone.\n\nLok Bing was a music producer, songwriter and lyricist. One night many years ago, he was an innocent young man and Beijing University had not yet expelled him. He loved the song called 'Monica’, and in his opinion it was rapturous music from heaven. Lok Bing had broken up with his girlfriend and he indulged himself in cigarettes and in the song 'Monica’. He played the song over and over again. He thought this guy called Cheung Kwok Wing was wild and sad. The song soothed him and gave him a reason to embrace pain. Later Lok Bing did some research on pop music in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He came to the conclusion that the era of Cheung Kwok Wing and Tam Wing Lun was Hong Kong’s golden years. Things just went downhill after them. He thought they were the bona-fide superstars. They influenced him and he envied the guys who wrote for them. Those guys worked in a great environment with a good system and brilliant superstars.\n\nLok Bing was a Leslie fan, for him Leslie was a “miracle” - mysteriously showing him the truth on that cool autumn night. Seven years after Lok Bing left Beijing University, Leslie was in his prime years. On a cool autumn’s evening Lok Bing was celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival with a group of friends at Ms. Lau’s place. Big Sister Lau (Ms. Lau) was from Taiwan and she knew a lot of people in the entertainment business in Hong Kong and Taiwan. They liked to gather in her courtyard to socialize and have fun. She told Lok Bing that she had invited Leslie to the party. She told him that Leslie had just made a comeback and his record was selling like hot cakes. Lok Bing was getting excited. They brought crabs and dinner was all ready when Leslie appeared. Lok Bing’s eyes lit up at the sight of him. He remembered one of his girlfriends absolutely loved Leslie, remarking that he was as gentle as the breeze and remarkably handsome. She would faint in ecstasy if someday Leslie appeared before her. Then Lok Bing said, “Well I leave you to Leslie then”. Some years ago, he had watched “A Better Tomorrow” with a girl in a very small theatre in Zhongxian. They saw Leslie walking towards his rival. Suddenly Lok Bing realized he had seen the film a few times already. Their hearts ached because he would soon be killed. His acting was so smooth and so good. They were deeply touched by the way he smiled, the way he looked back - endearingly and desperately. Leslie was enchanting, bewitching, and naturally sexy. His fans were mesmerized and Lok Bing was one of them. Some of Leslie’s films touched him so deeply. In those days Leslie was like a smiling fairy from heaven, watching his every move. He had a certain charisma, slowly sipping through his days of despair. Later, Lok Bing saw “Farewell My Concubine” and he realized Leslie had reached new heights. He was the film’s shining light, delicate and tender, bewitching everyone with his smile and laughter. Lok Bing watched so many of his films and forgot some of their titles. He didn’t have to remember all the characters which Leslie portrayed. Leslie was in his heart and from there he reached out. He was everywhere when Lok Bing needed a tender and loving moment.\n\nHe liked this feeling. Leslie died in his films but lived in his fans’ hearts. Big Sister Lau’s beauty had lit up the room, but behind her was Leslie of more dazzling beauty. She introduced them all and then sat by the side and watched musicians in the Mainland exchanging ideas with those from Hong Kong. She said, “Look at Leslie! A man in his 40’s but is still so seductively charming and so graceful!”. And she was right. There was a man always by his side, following his steps quietly. They all knew his sexual preference and yet respected it, accepting his choice as the norm. Dinner started and they got to know each other well after a few drinks. From the sitting room came the songs from “Farewell My Concubine”. Leslie wanted their comments. They made their comments with some reservations. They all liked him at first sight. Leslie was so well mannered and elegant. His smile gave them a very good feeling. They have met a lot of big stars, many of them demanded credit and ended up causing bad feelings.\n\n“No, you are all too kind, you have to be honest with me. You are all experts,” Leslie said keenly and softly. They laughed and told him there was still a gap between them - Hong Kong and Taiwan. Leslie said, “Your achievements in some areas are great. Our rock and roll is nowhere as good as yours.”\n\n“Your music is so refined” Lok Bing said, “So smooth, like the lake surface in autumn; like shiny silk, so exquisite and soft”. Leslie’s eyes lit up. He casually put his arm around Lok Bing’s shoulder and a faint sense of seduction came from him. “You are really poetic, Bing!” he said. Lok Bing had never liked a man as much as he liked Leslie at that instant. It could be a sign of something.\n\nLok Bing only knew that he loved Leslie and their love transcended the kind of brotherly love between men. Apart from his seductive charm, Leslie displayed an extraordinarily charisma which signified some special meanings to Lok Bing.\n\nLeslie became his days and his years. Leslie’s voice, image and language was a reflection of Lok Bing’s forgotten feelings and his bygone days. Now as he was seated opposite Leslie, hugging Leslie, taking photos, laughing, drinking and talking with Leslie, Lok Bing was suddenly overcome with determination that he had to work harder so that years later, fans would go up to him and in a state of agitation to declare to him 'my days are made up of your songs’.\n\nThat night Leslie and Lok Bing talked a lot. “How do you manage to excel in both singing and acting?” Lok Bing asked. “They are the same”. Leslie said. “Why?” Lok Bing asked, and Leslie replied, “Because they are the same.” They both laughed. “I have not seen too many of your films nor listened to too many of your songs” Lok Bing told Leslie honestly. “That doesn’t matter. I would consider it an achievement if they can impress you just a little.” Lok Bing told Leslie that he would remember that statement. The crabs smelled great and they enjoyed eating them. The crabs were in their own being possessed, bitten and swallowed. There was a sense of helplessness and waste about them. Lok Bing told Leslie his feeling and he wasn’t surprised. He just smiled tiredly and said, “I know the feeling from years back. You will know after some time.” “Why?” Lok Bing asked. “When you become popular, you will understand. After you have gone through more, you will understand more.” “How do you know I will become popular?” “Everyone here today will become popular, can’t you see?” Lok Bing shook his head in disbelief. “I am getting old. You people are taking over.”\n\nLeslie said with a smile. Again Lok Bing felt that dazzling and seductive charm disseminating on them all. “But you have just made a comeback, and your new record is so successful”. Leslie laughed and said, “You are still young.”\n\n“Well yes!” Sister Lau was passionately talking with her guests. “Come let’s have a toast! A toast to our Leslie wishing that he’ll be forever young and beautiful!”\n\n“Can I write for you?” Lok Bing asked Leslie. He didn’t hear his question. Lok Bing repeated it and then found Leslie had already left. They partied late into the night in that courtyard where Lok Bing was happy. Leslie was easy-going. His laughter and his low and magnetic voice echoed through the courtyard. Lok Bing knew he was not a star-chaser, but that night he saw a certain possibility for himself. Then he realized he would never be able to reach the status that Leslie had reached.\n\nLok Bing was drinking too much but he didn’t make a fool of himself. He knew he was in a state of intoxication, he could have been in this state even before he started drinking. That night the sky was full of stars, his best friends were there, an enchanting and romantic Leslie was there. Lok Bing saw them having fun, and they were carefree. Leslie’s singing was so captivating and his voice ascended to the moon like smoke. He saw fireworks rising from Leslie’s shoulder, engulfing them, wandering through their hearts. Fireworks were short-lived, but for one wondrous and shining moment, Lok Bing found consolation. It was the kind of happiness so powerful and great that it momentarily conquered the boundless darkness.\n\nCredits to original and read more here: http://xoomer.virgilio.it/nadiagui/biography03.htm\n\n1994 - SINCERE HEART\n\nIn January, Leslie was invited by TVB to hand out the Jade Solid Gold ‘most welcomed singer’ award. Leslie said that he had hoped to hand out the award to Leon Lai Ming. That night, the winner was indeed Leon Lai, and Leslie got the chance to give the award to him. Leslie had always secretly supported Leon. One day, Leon’s assistant who also happened to be Leslie’s assistant at the time, told him that a fashion store sales girl had been disrespectful to Leon - when he bought one of the two similar styled suits from the shop. Leon had pleaded for the sales girl to not sell the other suit to any other artist, as he was worried about being seen wearing the same clothes as another artist at the same occasion. But the shop assistant had responded to him rudely, stating that the shop would sell the suit to any buyer who wanted it. On hearing this, Leslie immediately went to the shop and bought the other suit. He bought it not to wear, but to keep it. And he did this only to defend and protect Leon Lai!\n\n“It’s a Wonderful Life”, the film about a Chinese family, featured a strong cast and premiered on 6th February. Among the cast was veteran actor, Kwan Tuck Heng. He held a record for starring in more than 130 films! As usual, Leslie kept up good relationships with his co-stars during the film shoot. There were also occasions when Do Do Cheng and Teresa Mo would go over to his house for supper and so on.\n\nMany people have said that Leslie’s handsome face is perfect, and has almost no flaws. After we get up close and speak to him, the above words have proven true because his beauty is not merely physical but shines out from within his beautiful inner soul. He had always been straightforward and sincere. Since he began his career, when he orbited to become a top-billing singer, and then gained success in the film world, Leslie Cheung experienced many changes. But these changes did not influence his straightforward style of speaking and his sincere attitude in all things. Even though he grew to have a much deeper understanding about the world he lived and worked in, and had put in much effort to be more flexible and careful, his true character never changed. At that stage a reporter had asked him what a man like Leslie Cheung - who could be said to have everything: a name, popularity and wealth - would most desire. Leslie answered that he most desired acknowledgement, so that if anyone mentioned the name 'Leslie Cheung’ it meant that they were referring to a legitimate and prolific actor. By 1994 Leslie’s hard work had made him an 'idol’ with superstar status in Hong Kong, and he no longer felt the need to pursue that 'idol’ status. Leslie did not want to be referred to merely as an 'idol’, because he longed to go beyond such assertions of his image. He only wanted to be a good actor, and had wanted someday to become a director. And Leslie had honestly stated that he did not know for how long he would still be involved in the film world: maybe for two years, maybe for twenty years more.\n\nLeslie had said, “In the past or at present, it doesn’t matter if I succeed or fail, truly I can say that I never hurt anybody. This kind of characteristic makes me suffer a lot.”\n\nCanadian director David Cronenberg offered Leslie the chance to act in “M. Butterfly” with actor Jeremy Irons, but because Leslie felt that the theme of the film was rather similar to “Farewell My Concubine”, he did not accept the offer. John Lone took the role. A film critic compared the John Lone’s performance with Leslie’s performance in “Farewell My Concubine”. The film critic said that John Lone was not convincing as a woman: “It can be argued that Cronenberg cast the film with this in mind, to let the audience in on a secret that he knew the intimacy of film couldn’t be kept hidden for long. But anyone who has seen the terrific performance by Leslie Cheung in the Cannes-winning \"Farewell My Concubine” knows that it can be done much more realistically than it is here. Lone is a strong actor being put in a virtually impossible situation. He has tried to modulate his voice, half-talking and half-whispering to simulate the husky mystery of a woman’s voice. But it never quite connects; he never seems more comfortable than at the end of the film when he’s dressed in a man’s clothes. By comparison, Cheung was just the opposite in “Farewell”, fully inhabiting the character that he was playing and the character that character was playing.“\n\nJohn Lone was also offered the role in \"Farewell My Concubine”, but he finally didn’t take it, and he said that he was proud with Leslie’s success in “Farewell”.\n\nA Vancouver newspaper, 'The Vancouver Sun’, included the photo of Leslie Cheung with his collie dog, Joy, at his Vancouver home. Columnist Peter Birnie started his article by writing, “He was a pop star in Hong Kong but Leslie Cheung now looks to movies, and Vancouver, for a new life. With his film \"Farewell My Concubine” in full flight, at this moment nominated for an Oscar as best foreign film, Cheung has no regrets about choosing in 1990 to end a 10-year singing career that has filled a room in his home with platinum records and music awards. Judging from the laser disc of one such concert, Cheung is lucky to have emerged from the throng of adoring young women without losing a limb. He left behind a tongue-in-cheek rivalry with fellow star Alan Tam. “We were always fighting each other for the awards,” he says, “but we’re the best of friends.” Now in his mid-30s, Cheung knows the Hong Kong music mill will always crank out another idol to fill a quota that’s dubbed 'the Top Four’. “There were four guys coming up, just like us, so it was kind of funny,” he says. “When I watch television now, I find the shadows, like they’re doing the things that we did before.”\n\nCheung fell in love with Vancouver when he first toured here in 1987, but motivation to move didn’t come until the 1989 massacre in Tienanmen Square. He refers to China’s plans to swallow Hong Kong as 'the '97 burden.’ Despite a fear of flying (and claustrophobia to boot), Cheung will continue the long commute between Canada and Hong Kong. “I’ve had a lot of offers from Hollywood now, but I’m still thinking,” he says. “I’m pretty big in Hong Kong and I don’t want to lose my fans because I’m going to do some lousy Grade C or D movie in Hollywood.” Cheung has already encountered the subtle racism that keeps Asian actors shut out of all but stereotypical roles in most Hollywood features. “One of the production companies tried to line me up with Keanu Reeves, acting as a ninja. I said, \"Don’t ask me to play a ninja”. Cheung even questions friend John Woo’s move to Tinseltown. “I don’t think he’s doing the right thing in Hollywood at all. He called me up when doing \"Hard Target” in New Orleans; he was complaining that people were cutting his budget and his time.“ Despite his reservations, Cheung flies to Hollywood this week in preparation for next Monday’s Academy Awards. If the pundits are right and \"Farewell My Concubine” adds to its list of prizes (Palme d'Or, Golden Globe, L.A. and New York film critics associations), will he be more likely to stay on this side of the Pacific? “I don’t know anything about Hollywood,” he says, laughing again. “I’m just an ordinary moviegoer!”\n\nIn Los Angeles Leslie asked a taxi driver, “What is your dream?” And the taxi driver said, “To be a film star”. Leslie was surprised, in Hong Kong it was different.\n\nThe great Hollywood director Steven Spielberg felt surprised and admired Leslie’s acting in “Farewell My Concubine”. The 66th Academy Awards nominated “Farewell My Concubine” in two categories: the best foreign language film nomination, and best cinematography nomination (for Gu Chang Wei). Less than two months before, “Farewell My Concubine” had won the Golden Globe as the best foreign language film. The film also won in the 'Los Angeles Film Critics Awards’, the 'New York Film Festival’, the 'Polish Film Festival’, and other film festivals in Europe. But the film did not win at the Academy Awards. Leslie who attended the ceremony with John Woo pointedly stated said there must have been some political reason behind “Farewell”’s losing. The U.S. had indeed put a lot of pressure on the People’s Republic of China on many issues, one of them was about copyright infringements.\n\nVeteran actress Cheng Pei Pei, who acted in “Woman of 33” with Leslie, met up with him at the airport in Los Angeles. Cheng Pei Pei recalled a lot about Leslie, realizing that she had known him for more than a decade. These 10 years seem so long, almost like a century to her. According to her if one were to write about their careers, one could write a long novel. In recent years, both of them have returned to Hong Kong almost at the same time, and once again work in show business. But they did not get to see each other so often. She recalled meeting him after a long time at the “Interview with Celebrities” programme, run by the Chinese News, in Malaysia several years before. She visited him to do a report about his shoot. On these two occasions when Cheng Pei Pei met Leslie he treated her with much respect, as his senior and not as a reporter. Maybe he was correct to feel that she was really like the elder sister of his best friend! That is why he was always extremely kind to her whenever they met. But Cheng never told him that he was like a younger brother to her, as she was of the opinion that this should not be so important.\n\nCheng Pei Pei also never missed a chance to watch any of Leslie’s movies. She would always buy the tickets herself to watch his movies at the cinema, and according to her his movies are worth paying money for. There are very few actors like Leslie in Hong Kong, who has such enthusiasm and sincerity. Or she often said that, for him, movies are not just a means of earning money but something he does for pleasure. When a person works not merely to earn a living, that person can reach the highest level of his ability. To work for pleasure, this is a dream for most people.\n\nThat year, the Japanese Film Critics Society awarded Leslie with the Best Actor title for his performance in “Farewell My Concubine”. During the year, “Farewell My Concubine” had aired several times on Japanese TV station NHK, and on the NHK satellite channel. The movie was a mega hit and marked a box office record for Asian cinema released in Japan. It screened for 7 months in Tokyo and other major cities around Japan, which was also a record. Films released theatrically are usually screened for up to 4 to 5 weeks in Japan, thus the 7 months period of screening Leslie’s hit movie is remarkably long. The movie and Leslie’s acting were highly acclaimed by film critics, the media and public. It was considered the most important film in the history of Asian Cinema in Japan!\n\nHe’s a Woman, She’s a Man\n\n“He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” was also a box-office movie of the year, pulling full houses in Hong Kong cinemas. Leslie sang the theme song for the film soundtrack, Chui (“Chase”), composed by Dick Lee, a renowned composer and singer from Singapore. The single of this song became a big hit. Leslie’s older fans did of course miss his voice singing a song. Their longing was a little reprieved by “ The Bride with White Hair” soundtrack, and the song “Chase”. And it couldn’t be denied that even though Leslie had left his singing career, with every passing year he always seemed to gain legions of new fans. During the location shoot of “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” many fans waited faithfully to see Leslie. What surprised and amazed many reporters was the fact that many of them were still teenagers!\n\nAt the Fringe Club, with piano, drums and other musical instruments on the stage, Leslie’s character Sam Koo had a jam session with his friends in “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man”. He sang two songs, the famous Beatles song, “Twist and Shout”, and the sweet “In This Lifetime”.\n\n“He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” was directed by Peter Chan, a Thailand Chinese. Leslie was paired with the talented artist, Anita Yuen, Miss Hong Kong 1990 - who had just won the Best Actress title at the Hong Kong Film Festival that year for her performance in Derek Yee’s, “Till the End of Time”. At the awards ceremony, Leslie together with actor Tony Leung Kar Fai presented the award to Anita. Anita, whose body was very thin, felt nervous of Leslie and his fame. Usually, Anita speaks excellently, she excels in memorizing dialogue, and she had never had problems to say eight sentences in row without stopping. But when she faced Leslie, her tongue became like that of a dumb person.\n\n“Indeed, I was too nervous and felt a failure when I faced Leslie. Whereas Leslie was calm, he memorized the dialogue very well, knew what sentence must be followed by what other sentence. Because of being too nervous, I had cold sweats and the movie scrip got truly crumpled!”, said Anita shrugging her shoulder. But Leslie was known to always be nice and helpful to a newcomer.\n\n\"The more time went by, the more nervous I felt, then I had to repeat a scene about nine times. Usually, if I hear the director shout \"cut”, I would just relax and I’d go play around. But this time, every time I heard the word “cut” I would immediately sit as if I am about to faint, supporting my head with my hands and breathing deeply. Leslie, on the contrary, showed his kindness trying to comfort me. And I had to pretend to be calm, like nothing had happened. Maybe in his heart he thought: 'Ah, they said Anita is great, but she is only like this’.“\n\nBecause she was so ashamed, Anita did many self-introspections. She realized that in the past she had been rather lazy and she wanted to improve herself. \"Leslie was indeed very diligent, he always made a note of the dialogue which was to be followed in the movie script, thus it helped him to memorize it. I followed his way of working. It has already been three nights that I diligently do my 'homework’”, said Anita.\n\nIf she looked at Leslie, Anita didn’t dare to do it directly. She only dared to look at Leslie’s one eye, so that she would not get too intoxicated or nervous. One day, Leslie and Anita were shooting scenes at the Deco Grill at the Peak. Leslie’s character, Sam Koo, was drinking with Anita Yuen’s character, who was disguised as a man. Sam Koo wanted to get to know 'him’ better so that he could write songs for 'him’, and one of the questions he had asked was when 'he’ made love for the first time.\n\nThe “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” film poster was subsequently showed off on a wall. Many people said, “Look how handsome Leslie is”. “No”, said Leslie humbly. But some minutes later he looked at his poster and said, “Oh yeah, this 38 year old man still looks handsome… hmmm….”. Every body laughed. Because Leslie is an unusual and daring actor we therefore have a movie like “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man”.\n\nAbout love between people of the same gender, Leslie said, “Love between a man and woman lasts for a moment like fireworks. It easily disappears, and making it last is very hard. I think love between two men is different from that. It’s generous and kind, supported by a solid trust.”\n\nAt the same time as when he was shooting “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man”, Leslie also starred in a comedy film directed by Gordon Chan, entitled “Long and Winding Road”. In “Long and Winding Road”, Leslie Cheung, an angel from heaven, played a bad guy, Lam Chiu Wing. Leslie felt very tired having to do many scenes for two films in a day. He said that he was too tired because he did sports one day before. It was Teresa Mo who had suggested for him to do some sports, and consume healthy food. Usually Leslie kept his body in a healthy condition by going jogging and swimming. But nowadays, Leslie chose to do training in the gym because he was worried that swimming would influence the condition of his hair. Leslie had indeed experienced some indication of baldness. To handle this problem, he took therapy in a hair care center. This kind of treatment was not painful, as if someone is being injected. Leslie used treatment shampoo, hair care hormones and medicine to stimulate growth and prevent the loss of hair. Leslie also consumed 3 kinds of vitamins. Every month he paid almost HK$2,000. Luckily, Leslie succeeded in handling this problem. His hair therapy was successful.\n\n“He’s a Woman She’s a Man” premiered on 23 July 1994, and “Long and Winding Road” followed on 4 August 1994. The two films were no. 2 and no. 3 at box office record. No.1 was the American film “Speed”.\n\nThe projects Leslie was involved in were dream projects for many Hong Kong new artists. Ray Chan for example, would be very happy if he could play the part of Yuddy in “Days of Being Wild”. Edmund Leung fell in love with Paris after he saw “Sunset in Paris”.\n\nSandra Ng Interview\n\nIn Sandra Ng’s radio interview, she asked Leslie what kind of dream he would like to have, and he answered that he would of course like to dream about the person that he loved most. Sandra added “… you mentioned earlier that you already have one person in your life already”, and Leslie replied “…that’s the person I’m referring to…”. To which Sandra replied in awe and disbelief “….Oh Gor Gor, I really can’t stand you (in an envious tone) …you want to see this person when you are awake, and you want to see this person in your dreams too!!!” And Leslie replied softly “Yes”. It is truly amazing to hear Leslie say it, in his own words. He was very forthright in showing his love for his partner, and was not ashamed or hesitant at all to admit it. How many artistes have the guts to admit this? Of course, the “person” that he was referring to was none other than Mr. Tong Hock Tak. In 1994 Leslie and Mr. Tong would had been together more than 10 years, which is not a short amount of time by any measure. Sandra did the interview with a male DJ. He also had some questions for Leslie.\n\nDJ: What would you consider yourself stingy in or cheap in: Money? Friendship? Love?\n\nLeslie: Actually, I do not think others would consider me stingy in friendship or money. But I do believe that I am very 'cheap’ in 'love’. I will explain why I considered myself 'cheap’ in romance or love. Because I am for one person. I can and do love just one person. And Sandra knows all these years. I have only had, and have only one love.\n\nDJ: Why? After all these years there has only been one? That does not seem right! In a lifetime… it does not seem right to only have one love.\n\nSandra: Actually, I noticed that Gor Gor is a very loyal person. And I have seen him when he was mulling over heart related issues. He was sweet.\n\nLeslie: Actually Sandra and I do not see each other that often. But she does know a lot about my life and my business. We may only talk on the phone twice a year. But she is a friend who is in my thoughts.\n\nDJ: What dream would you like to have tonight?\n\nSandra: Yes! What kind of dream would you love to have?\n\nLeslie: If you want a 'sweet dream’. You would hope the person you care about comes into your dream.\n\nSandra: But… you mentioned earlier that there has only been one love in your life.\n\nLeslie: Yes… there has only been one, and that would be the one I would want in my dreams.\n\nSandra: Wow, you mean… even in your dreams you want to see him? Wow. I am so jealous. You want to see him when you are awake and when you sleep. (laugh)\n\nLeslie: Of course, I never would have guessed we would be so happy talking about it…\n\nSandra: Which ten persons have affected your life most?\n\nLeslie: 1. Anita Mui, 2. Wong Kar Wai, 3. Maggie Cheung, 4. John Woo, 5. Chow Yun Fat, 6. Brigitte Lin, 7. Anita Yuen, 8. Michael Lai, 9. Florence Chan, 10. Chen Kai Ke and Hsu Feng\n\nSandra: Who can share all your secrets, your heart?\n\nLeslie: Anita Mui and Elisa Chan.\n\nIn that interview Leslie also mentioned that he loves children.\n\nIn other interview Leslie said he didn’t care about going to Hollywood unless he was offered a good script. He would rather work with mainland directors like Zhang Yi-mou, Tien Zhong-zhong or Taiwanese director Hou Hau-yin. He thought there were plenty of opportunities in Asia. Going to Hollywood was not his cup of tea. As a professional actor, he also didn’t mind stripping in front of the camera if the script sees it necessary. He said he’s well prepared for this challenge. For example if you want to express a person’s narcissism there is no better way than to strip in front of the mirror and then kiss yourself in the mirror. He had been doing love scenes in his early movies like “On Trial” and “Nomad”. He joked that he would be punished for that by the Communists, and that is why he has to leave Hong Kong.\n\nAbout his baby-faced appearance, Leslie said that it did not affect the development of his acting career. “It has never been a barrier in my professional development,” Leslie said. “On the contrary, I believe it has been an asset. Maintaining youthful appeal is easy,” he said. “I try not to make myself tense and seldom stay out late.” Enjoying life was another secret. It has been nearly five years since Leslie announced he was quitting the music industry to devote himself to movie-making, a decision he says he has not regretted. “I appreciate the fact that my songs are still popular, probably due to karaoke playing,” he said. “It is a great comfort. But comparatively speaking, filming is not so time consuming, especially when it comes to promotion. I just have to fulfill my acting role and after the shoot comes to an end, my job is completed. Sometimes I may have to attend one or two press conferences before the movie is released, but that is it.” Even though Leslie had ditched his music career - apart from singing theme songs for some of his movies - he still has a lot fans. They were part of the reason he says he won’t resume singing. “I still get invitations to sing, especially at charitable functions,” Leslie said. “I won’t do that because I don’t want to back down on my promise (to disappear from the music scene) to my fans.” He describes Hong Kong as a “complicated society” where one must be on guard all the time. “For example, you might work on something for a charitable purpose, but other people might feel you’re actually using it for self-promotion,” he added. “I prefer low-exposure projects when I do things for charity.” Leslie had big ambitions for his acting career and was not limiting himself to Hong Kong. “I want to have a chance to extend my career into the international market, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Hollywood,” he said. Leslie wanted to build up his reputation internationally through Chinese-produced movies. “The Chinese always play the underdog role,” he said. “But over the past few years they have gained attention and respect for their great success. I feel this is a great encouragement.” On a darker note, Leslie said he felt local movies were limited because they always follow the trend. Changing this, he said, was difficult because of the territory’s small market. “Most investors are businessmen and their only consideration is getting satisfactory returns,” Leslie added. “At present, it seems that only commercial films are welcomed by the audience. This makes us different from overseas markets, where there are a certain amount of people who support underground music and movies.” After Leslie quit the music scene, he spent some time in Canada. His first plan was to settle down there and set up a coffee shop. “Things came out differently from what I had expected,” he said. “I couldn’t afford to totally retire.” But he said he’s happy with what he has at this moment. “I consider myself a serious actor rather than a movie idol,” he says. “I believe one’s desire changes from stage to stage,” he said. “At the moment, I hope to fulfil my role as an actor.” Leslie described himself as emotional, a side which he says has helped him in his career. “An artist must be emotional otherwise it is hard to put himself or herself into a role,” he said.\n\nLeslie had endeavored to learn more about the Chinese Culture. And this was something that came to the notice of Professor Yee Shao Hua, a professor of Chinese music history and music culture. In Prof. Yee’s eyes, Leslie was a Western-style singer, an idol. So what was it that established ties between the two of them? During their meeting at a Chinese University Hong Kong seminar, Prof. Yee asked Leslie if he felt any change within himself after performing in literature-related movies such as “Rouge”, and later “Farewell My Concubine”, which was filmed back in mainland China. According to Prof. Yee, Leslie was very frank in answering his question. Leslie said, “I re-recognize myself as a Chinese. Chinese culture is splendid and great. When I was working on the mainland, I found people from mainland China nice and pure. Such experiences totally changed me.“ Prof. Yee could tell that Leslie was being very sincere about what he had said. He was a typical example of people from Hong Kong and their relationship with Chinese culture. Hong Kong people do not have enough knowledge or a clear idea about Chinese culture, and Prof. Yee included himself in this analysis. It was not until he left Hong Kong and China that he observed China from a distance and got to know it. Leslie had the same experience as his.\n\nMy Hong Kong\n\n\"Hong Kong Visitor”, a tourist guidebook published by the South China Morning Post published an article called “My Hong Kong” by Leslie. “Although he’s acted on television and in many unforgettable films for more than a decade, Leslie Cheung Kwok Wing used to be typecast as a Canto pop pin-up whose main admirers were screaming teenage girls. Not so any more. His role as opera star Cheng Dieyi in the Palme D'Or winning film, \"Farewell to My Concubine”, has ensured that his name is now bandied about in international film circles. And one thing’s certain, Leslie has bid his farewell to the days when he was just a pretty boy. He takes time off a movie set here to tell us why Hong Kong is home.\n\nQuestion: Do you consider yourself a Hongkonger? Why?\n\nLeslie: Naturally. I was born in Hong Kong, I grew up here, so my roots are here. What’s more, I feel most comfortable here.\n\nQuestion: Where does your family come from?\n\nLeslie: My father was born in Guangdong and my mother was born here. But her folks were also from Guangdong.\n\nQuestion: Have you ever lived anywhere else? If so, where and when?\n\nLeslie: I’ve lived on and off in Vancouver since 1990.\n\nQuestion: What do you find particularly appealing about Hong Kong?\n\nLeslie: Hong Kong is such a lively place and I appreciate its efficiency. It’s a city that offers lots of opportunities and it’s very cosmopolitan. One just feels very comfortable here.\n\nQuestion: What are your favourite places in Hong Kong? Why do you like them?\n\nLeslie: The Peak because the view from here is breathtaking and it’s like a show window of Hong Kong’s prosperity. I also like Stanley, with its quaint village atmosphere; Repulse Bay, where I lived for a long time; and Central, which is the pulse of Hong Kong, showcasing its prosperity and its cosmopolitan nature.\n\nQuestion: Which are your favourite restaurants in Hong Kong?\n\nLeslie: I like 'Gaddi’s’ at The Peninsula, 'One Harbour Road’ at the Grand Hyatt and 'Fook Lam Moon’.\n\nQuestion: Where do you usually spend your weekends in Hong Kong?\n\nLeslie: At home.\n\nQuestion: When you entertain friends from overseas, which parts of Hong Kong do you usually show them?\n\nLeslie: The Peak, again for the fantastic view and because it shows Hong Kong at its best.\n\nQuestion: Where do you like to take them for meals?\n\nLeslie: I take them to my three favourite restaurants: 'Gaddi’s’, 'One Harbour Road’, and 'Fook Lam Moon’. I want them to try the food I personally enjoy.\n\nQuestion: What aspects of Hong Kong would you change if you had your way?\n\nLeslie: I would clean it up and solve its pollution problems. I’d also want every Hongkonger to own a home so everyone has more space in breathe in. Right now, Hong Kong is going through a very unstable phase. Yet, there’s nothing basically wrong with it. It’s just politics causing this instability. I don’t think the quirky surges of the Hang Seng index are particularly healthy, for instance. I’d like to see things calm down.\n\nLeslie announced his retirement and migrated to Canada in the early 90s. He said he did want to keep his word (he was not going to sing and act in movies any more) but he found life in Canada was not exactly what he wanted. When asked whether he would leave Hong Kong again, he wouldn’t say “No”. But he reiterated that unless he felt uncomfortable living in Hong Kong, he would spend the rest of his life in the city because he loved the place very much. Hong Kong is a fascinating city, and also his 'roots’.\n\nLeslie had had many a time warded off questions from reporters who wanted to know whether he wanted to make a ‘come-back’ to the music world. For him, filming movies did not have the same kind of pressure, only do a shoot and do a little promotion. Leslie always refused many offers to sing, especially for charity. But slowly, Leslie began to have a wish to come back. It was indeed a waste if a music superstar like him could only sing 'karaoke’ at home! When watching Jonathan Li’s concert in Taiwan, the desire to go back to the stage came to Leslie’s mind because the band playing at the concert was his former band. And Leslie also felt dissatisfied with new Canto-pop singers. They couldn’t sing and interpret the songs well. Leslie thought, “I sing well, why don’t I go back to the recording studio?” Leslie’s retirement had indeed been a very big loss to the Hong Kong music industry. At the end of the interview he said, “If I want to back to singing, I will go back whenever I want. If I want to sing, I will just sing. The most important thing is I enjoy it. I don’t care what other people will say…”\n\nOn 17 September 1994, “Ashes of Time” finally premiered after more than two years in the making. The film featured many of Hong Kong’s most famous actors, with Leslie playing a pivotal role as the 'link’ between the stories of each character played by these top artistes. Leslie was usually Wong Kar-wai’s first pick for his movies. But he was busy from time to time with other projects, so he had turned down “Chungking Express” and “Fallen Angels,” for which finally Tony Leung and Leon Lai got picked to replace him.\n\nWe can get to know Leslie’s personality better by reading many of his interviews. One of his reporter friends, Joe, titled one of his reports, “See How Leslie Cheung Loves And Scolds Someone”. Leslie did not like Joe’s boss Li Zhi Ying, since he felt that Li was capable of ruining the future of an artiste by writing bad stories about an artist in his magazine. Joe wrote that Leslie was already a very eloquent person 10 years back. During that time, everyone would tell him about this, right to his face. Ever since he acted in “The Bride with White Hair”, people started calling him 'GorGor’. Leslie remained the same but the attitudes of the people around him changed. Some people would be bitchy about Leslie behind his back, but would appear very polite in front of him-especially those working with him. The people from the upper management would of course be more tactful, but to be frank this can only be considered fake. We all don’t have to spell out all the reasons. As Leslie’s friends, you will be able to understand him. Besides his good looks, Leslie was someone with his own principles. He was always very clear and very honest about it. He said: “Whatever you do, you should have a principled attitude, a bottom line. So long as we don’t hinder each other work, then we will have no problem”. Leslie became more agitated as he commented on how irresponsible the media is nowadays. And he had even made negative comments about Joe’s boss Li Zhi Ying. As a reporter, Joe felt that he should maintain an objective attitude towards people and other matters, he wrote: “Sorry, boss. Whatever the comments or criticisms GorGor made, I will just write it down”.\n\nIn fact, this was not really an interview. If it was an interview, Leslie would most probably not have accepted it, since he thought that the media nowadays liked to exaggerate things and pry too much into artistes’ privacy. He detested this so much, just as he had said before: “If I see those magazines that I don’t like, why should I care about them? Don’t think that just by sending one card over, it means I should give face to them. I am someone who can tear the card in front of these people. Why should I give chances to these people who are fucking around?”\n\nLuckily Joe was a friend of Leslie’s, so he faced less risks of having his card torn up. Leslie knew that part of their conversation would be written down, and he promised Joe that he would allow them to take some photos for use in the magazine. They were still chatting happily but when the photographer started taking photos, Gor Gor suddenly got angry. During the photo session, he kept saying: “You go and tell your boss Li Zhi Ying, I am only taking the photos because I am doing my friend a favour, not because I am giving him face. I don’t understand what he is thinking. What good does it bring him to ruin the future of an artiste? How long can a magazine continue to have good sales? Now, I am not the only one saying this, many artistes are very unhappy about this! If this goes on, sooner or later we will come together and boycott him. Then we will see what more they can write. Honestly speaking, it is not that we are not allowing them to talk or write, but not with this attitude, not completed and not true”.\n\n“What is the use of doing so many things? You must have your own principles in whatever things you do. Now, I only wish to be a real actor. Now that I still have my market, I am going to continue acting. In the past I have said I wanted to be a director, but I will not be thinking about it at the moment.” A reporter asked: “You are still so popular now, do you feel you have a little luck?” He replied: “You can say so, as an artiste, you must make sure the audience likes you. If there are no audiences, no matter how good you are, it will be of no use!”\n\nNot arrogant, just speaking the truth! Although Leslie had said many words out of rage, he would still change his tone and say something nice to comfort Joe. Honestly speaking, Leslie had never changed at all, whether it was when he was acting small roles or now that he is a famous artiste. Joe was not going to comment whether he thought that Leslie’s statement was right or wrong, as different people in different positions see things differently. But in his eyes, to say everything so frankly is Leslie’s principle, at least Leslie feels comfortable this way. As they were chatting they agreed that there were really very few artistes like him nowadays. Leslie stressed that he was not being very arrogant by saying such words. And because of this, if artistes like him would not speak up, who would dare to say anything? But to see things in a different point of view, to Leslie those exciting days had already passed. Leslie seldom went out, he could enjoy his love life and his successful career that he finally gained, and at least he was happy about it.\n\nInspired by their idol, who was always a trendsetter, Leslie Cheung fans Chang Chi Tao with some of his friends established the Leslie Cheung Internet Fan Club (LCIFC). This was the first internet fan club in Hong Kong, and may be even in Asia!\n\nLeslie’s song “Chase” from the movie “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” (music by Dick Lee, lyric by Lam Tsik, sung by Leslie Cheung) was nominated for Best Movie Theme Song at the 31st Taiwan Golden Horse Awards. The previous April, another of Leslie’s songs, “The White-Haired Beauty” from the movie “The Bride With White Hair” (music by Leslie Cheung, lyric by Lam Tsik, sung by Leslie Cheung) was nominated for Best Original Film Song at the 13th Hong Kong Golden Film Awards. And again Leslie was Winner of the Best Actor title from the Hong Kong Movie Express Japan (1994 membership, 4,000) for his appearance in “Farewell My Concubine”.\n\nThat year, Teresa Mo married director Tony Au. Both Leslie and Teresa enjoyed each others company as close friends. Leslie called her “Honey”, but he stopped calling her that after Teresa remarried. He missed her company after she got married, especially during the mahjong sessions. He dared not call her “Honey” because Tony was a serious person, even if he is a nice guy. A woman reporter, a long time acquaintance of Leslie met Mr. Tong for the first time at Teresa Mo’s wedding party. It’s only a small party of a few tables. Teresa had invited a few very close friends and relatives including Leslie, Mr. Tong, Rosamund Kwan, Leung Lee Siu-har etc. The reporter was sitting at a table behind Leslie. Leslie came to say hello to the reporter and they chatted for a while. Afterwards the reporter heard Leslie greet Mr. Tong, and say, “Gor Gor, come here”. So, actually Mr. Tong is the 'gorgor’!\n\nMr. Tong is a very nice guy in the hearts of their friends. Leung Lee Siu-har was in frequent contact with them, and she told the reporter, “We used to call Tong Tong 'Gor Gor’ and Leslie 'Ah Chai’ (meaning 'son’), he (Leslie) called me 'thin Mom’.”\n\nOn other occasion, when he was asked about his perspective on love between the same gender, Leslie said that he was not a homophobic, because in this world the most important thing is sincere love. “Love belongs to us, ourselves. No need to be bothered about other people’s views, the most important thing is that we feel happy, delighted and do not cause the other’s loss. So there is no need to care about the other people’s bad mouth.” Leslie had just moved from the apartment to a house. Both Leslie and Tony Leung Chiu Wai didn’t like to stay in apartments. They were afraid that people would stare at them. \"If the people I don’t know greet me, I will reply to their greeting. But I don’t dare to take the initiative to greet them. If the person I greet doesn’t reply to me, I will feel ashamed. When I decided to retire, people thought that I was afraid that my career would fade away, indeed I was afraid to die. I even received a candle, incense, money for the dead, and a dead cockroach. If we are always conscious that there are people who would like to condemn us to early deaths, we will be in the shadow of death all the time! I really don’t know when my soul will be lost, because of stabbing by a knife or having chemicals poured. I only work as an artist, why must I be terrorized and accept that kind of treatment? So I decided to retire.“\n\nHe had at least 500 million HK dollars, 3 houses (two in Canada, one in Hong Kong) and one apartment in May Tower, which his mother occupied. Maggie Cheung and Rosamund asked him to open a coffee shop so it could be a place for them to gather together. When asked why he didn’t marry, Leslie said he didn’t have any interest to be a father. One of his sisters suffered complications while giving birth (her heart nearly stopped), and it scared him.\n\nOne day when he was taking his car in the car park, there was a boy who saw him. The boy felt very happy and said to his mother, \"Mom, look at him… he is Cheung Kwok Wing!” What gave Leslie a shock was how the boy’s mother scorned him and said, “What is so terrific about Cheung Kwok Wing…?” Leslie felt humiliated. In his opinion, peoples’ abhorrence of the poor and the jealousy toward the rich was too much. He did not like it. In this world, the one with a sincere heart is rare. And Leslie was one of them.\n\nCredits to original and read more here: http://xoomer.virgilio.it/nadiagui/biography03.htm\n\n1993 - GOLDEN PALM\n\nOn 1 January 1993 “Farewell My Concubine” was premiered in Hong Kong. The film collected more than HK$ five millions in a few days time. At the ocasion John Dykes from South China Morning Post interviewed director Chen Kaige. Chen was afraid that the conservative Chinese government officials would ban the film in Mainland China as his previous film “Life on String” was banned in Mainland China. However, the Chinese censorship board finally allowed the film to be screened in China with substantial censoring. Due to the intervention of some open-minded party leaders; China’s Ministry of Radio, Film and Television gave approval for screening of the film, which was expected to make at least HK$ 40 millions at the box office in China. Leslie Cheung was deeply moved to tears when he saw the film. He was the first Hong Kong actor to act in a Mainland China film. When he was asked to comment on the controversy, Leslie replied “Everything in life is predestined.”\n\n“All’s Well, End’s Well Too” directed by Clifton Ko was also released. Leslie with his gentle and handsome look played the role of magician David Copper Feel (the parody of David Copperfield). This was a comedy film and a parody of modern life and the cast wore ancient costumes. The cast of this film comprised of several great comedy actors of Hong Kong - Samuel Hui and his brother Ricky Hui, Sandra Ng, Raymond Wong (also producer of the film), Ng Man Tat, Teresa Mo and the pretty actress Rosamund Kwan.\n\nMoving to another shooting location on Dong Cheng Xi Jiu (“Eagle Shooting Heroes”), it was reported that Leslie Cheung taught Brigitte Lin how to play a sexy role. One day Stephen Chow visited Leslie and Brigitte at the shooting location. Brigitte Lin felt compelled to shoot this film. In her mind she never accepted to play any role in this film. At the beginning Wong Kar Wai approached her and told that he would cast her and Joey Wong as the legend swordsmen from Louis Cha’s novel of “West Poison and East Devil” - “Legend of the Condor Heroes”. Wong Kar Wai told her a very interesting story. After some time Wong approached her again saying that because of the success of “Days of Being Wild” he now had something else in mind. Again she was told of another wonderful story and this time it was with a bigger cast including Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung and two Tony Leung. She accepted the offer and waited for a long time to shoot her part though she knew that Leslie and Joey Wong had started filming for some time. Suddenly one day she was told that the film had to make way for a Chinese New Year movie which would be directed by Jeff Lau and the whole cast was asked to film for this Chinese New Year movie. Brigitte said she was not good acting in comedy movie especially in those crazy comedies and she told her worries to Leslie. Leslie asked her to relax for that kind of film did not have any script. That day she did a scene shot inside a cave. The director Jeff Lau told her that there were lots of monsters, chickens and ducks in the cave and that she was pregnant. On hearing this, Brigitte was very shocked and asked Leslie how and what she was supposed to do. Leslie said with a sigh, “Just do it!” She then told Joey Wong again that she was asked to play a pregnant woman with a duck. Seeing that Brigitte was so worried, Jeff Lau could not help laughing and said, “It was just a joke, don’t be too serious.”\n\nLeslie visited Korea to promote his film “All’s Well End’s Well”. On hearing that Leslie would be interviewed on a broadcasting station, thousands of fans gathered in front of the station. In view of the huge crowd, the interview was cancelled in order to avoid any untoward incident. During his stay in Korea, Leslie received lots of compliments from the media for his pleasant manner and good personality. Furthermore, the press and the public described him as the “Noble Prince or Gentleman of Hong Kong”. Leslie had once said that he considered France to be the most remarkable country and the Koreans were his most unforgettable overseas fans. The enthusiasm of the Korean fans was beyond his imagination. On the other hand, he was both excited and frightened by their responses.\n\nOn 20 January 1993, “All’s Well End’s Well Too” was screened for the first time followed by Dong Cheng Xi Jiu on 5 February 1993. These two films were no.1 and no. 3 at the box office list. At this time Leslie was in Canada to celebrate Chinese New Year there. Leslie flew first class on a Cathay Pacific flight to Canada. Stewardesses whispered with admiration, “Oh, how handsome!” Leslie pretended that he didn’t know whom they were referring to, then looked around and asked, “Where? Where?” He was indeed very cute! Since there were lots of vacant seats in the first class, he changed seats from time to time: just like a naughty kid when his mum was not around. He only ate strawberries on the flight. In addition, he did push-ups in the cabin when he was bored which was unbecoming of a superstar behaving like a child but adorable!\n\nVisit Danny\n\nOne day, Reporter Cha Siu Yan met Leslie after he returned to Hong Kong. He looked energetic. “I spent the Chinese New Year in Canada, just came back yesterday”, said Leslie. Danny Chan had been hospitalized for 10 months since he went into coma and Leslie didn’t pay any visit to Danny Chan. So Cha Siu Yan told him that he was unaffectionate and this was not acceptable since they signed their respective contract with the same agent. There were speculations about their relationship as all along there were rumours that they were not getting along well. Leslie told her that he had reasons. He accepted Cha’s points and then decided to visit Danny on one condition that there would be no reporters and they went in the evening. Cha Siu Yan brought a bunch of flowers and showed him the flowers. She said, “I know you would forget the flowers and therefore I bought them for you\"”. Leslie thanked her. Later when they went upstairs the nurse took Cha’s flowers and thanked her. Then the nurse turned to Leslie and said, \"Thank you for your flowers, Mr. Cheung. They are beautiful”. Cha found out that she was wrong as Leslie had already asked someone to send the flowers. He was getting more and more subtle these days.\n\nLeslie stared at Danny’s face, almost without any expression. He leaned forward, very close to Danny’s face. Cha whispered in Danny’s ears, “Danny, Leslie’s here”. Leslie looked at Danny for a long time without a word. He took a look at the machine by his side and asked, “Do you think he can hear me?” “It’s hard to tell”, the nurse replied. He turned around and told Cha, “I’m going to talk to him. Let me know if there is any response” “Danny, Danny, Danny, this is Leslie!” There was no response. His heartbeat was still at 94, no change. Leslie asked Cha, “The news said his legs and arms get atrophied, is it true?” She showed him Danny’s hand, “Of course not”. “Is he putting on weight?” “Yes” the nurse replied. “You have to keep fit when you get up,” Leslie was joking with Danny. Cha knew he was trying to ease the atmosphere. He asked the nurse again, “Will he become very fat?” He seemed to be very concerned about his weight. The nurse replied, “No, because we have a dietician to watch his diet”. After some time Leslie said he had to go and said goodbye to Danny. He and Cha Siu Yan waited for the lift at the lobby. Leslie didn’t say anything. Cha noticed he was rubbing his fingers, looking nervous and uncomfortable. After a long pause he said, “I am sad to see him in such condition!” He repeated again, “Really sad! Why is he hurting himself? If you don’t love yourself who is going to love you? He always felt unhappy. I talked to him many times but he didn’t listen”.\n\nThere was a long silence. He still looked very uneasy. Looking at the gloomy sky he said, “I hope we can see the sun very soon, such a boring day!” His words seemed to have a double meaning. When Cha peeped through his sunglasses, she saw his eyes were red. “Do you want to cry?” “No, I just feel very sad. I have seen so many ‘parted for ever’ these years, too many.” “How long have you known Danny?” “15 years, he was the male lead in \"Encore”, mine was just a minor role\". Cha recalled, these three good-looking young men: Leslie, Danny and Paul all were under the same manager. Fifteen years later, there only remained Leslie living happily and enjoying his life. Cha sighed. Leslie and Danny had different characters. The former was tough and optimistic while the latter was fragile and sensitive. “Yes, I am tough”, Leslie admitted. “Why don’t you come to see Danny earlier?” “I can’t. Last year was the Year of the Monkey and those who are born under this sign should not visit the sick in hospitals. I’ll come soon after the New Year”, he said. He heard this bad news in Beijing while he was shooting the movie “Farewell to My Concubine”. He was not supposed to pay any hospital or funeral visits or attend any celebratory occasions because he had provoked 'Tai Shui’. According to the Chinese Book of Fortune, Monkey people would offend the King of Monkey in the Year of the Monkey. They would have a very volatile year. So they had to be very careful and to keep bad luck at bay, there were certain things that they should avoid e.g. attending funerals, visiting people in hospital etc. Leslie had his waist wrapped around with a red strap to avoid 'Tai Shui’. Cha Siu Yan blamed herself for being so nosy and felt uncomfortable upon learning Leslie’s reasons. She told him that there were speculations of him not visiting Danny at the hospital. He seemed a bit agitated and said, “These people are terrible. Why do they always gossip about others?” Before he left he asked her, “I have to pay for the flowers, how much is it?” How could Cha take his money! But he insisted on inviting her to tea instead. From this small clue, we could see his working style.\n\nWhen the Cathay Pacific stewardess met Leslie again for the second time on another flight, Leslie behaved differently this time. He was shedding tears silently in his seat. When the stewardess approached him and asked him whether he needed any help, he politely said no. Indeed Leslie was a very kind person with a sensitive heart and could be moved to tears quite easily.\n\nBride with White Hair\n\nLeslie was torn between “Wing Ko Film Company” (Regal) and “Mandarin Film Co” and probably he would sign contract with foreign artist management company. Mandarin Film Co. prepared big budget for “The Bride with White Hair” - the film which involved beautiful people, beautiful costume and a beautiful love story. “The Bride with White Hair” was adapted from Liang Yu Sheng’s book. The director was Ronny Yu who had directed an American film “China White”. He made the characters in the film different from the one depicted in the book because he wanted to make it more modern. It was for this reason that Ronny went to Australia to meet the author who is an 80-year old man. Liang Yu Sheng said, “OK… go…whatever”. Ronny was so excited, he thanked Liang very much and when the old author shut the door he said to Ronny, “Mr. Yu?… Don’t embarrass me.”\n\nRonny changed a lot of things - the Siamese twins and the bad character of the film was his idea. Ronny was with the scriptwriters and he was trying to avoid getting those typically boring bad guys. He wanted something new, something more surreal. The Discovery Channel was on TV and at the end of the programme, there was a report about Siamese babies and he said, “What if the bad guys are Siamese twins?” Everybody looked at Ronny and thought he was crazy! “How are you going to shoot this?” they asked, we couldn’t afford CGI. “The problem will be solved” Ronny said. The concept was interesting: Siamese twins, one male, one female, and what about their sexual desire! What if one of them was sexually aroused? Ronny laughed. Nobody thought of that in Hong Kong movies! It made Ronny excited.\n\nRonny Yu said when Wong Pak Ming told him the story; he had a strong visualization of Brigitte Lin dressed up in bridal attire with her hair turning completely white during the night. He believed this image would stirred up the curiosity of a western audience to watch a girl standing on a high hill in a bride’s costume with her hair turning white within a night. Ronny knew Brigitte for many years. When he got the script he said to her, “Brigitte, this is a role tailor-made for you, you have got to do this!” The leading role was Brigitte Lin. As for the leading actor, Ronny Yu’s first thought was to give this role to Leslie Cheung. He said Leslie came to mind at once. It was like the role was created for him. He said that he knew Leslie since the very beginning of their careers. The producer was not keen on Leslie; they wanted a 'kung-fu’ actor. Ronny said that kung fu actor like Yuen Piao would not have any sensitive feeling, the beauty, and the glamour - qualities needed by the character. “I need a good actor, not a good fighter. Stunt-man can provide the illusion that an actor is a great fighter, but a stunt man can’t give the illusion that an actor can act well. It doesn’t matter, as long as he’s a good actor, I can use stunt doubles to make him look realistic. It had to be Leslie Cheung, rebellious, almost a James Dean-like character.”\n\nIt was the second collaboration between Leslie and scriptwriter Lin Ji Tao who wrote the script together with Ronny Yu, Teng Pi Yen and David Wu. In Lin’s eyes, “The Bride with White Hair” was virtually a western production. Lin Ji Tao was quite confident that westerners would like the movie when he knew that the movie featured Leslie and Brigitte. He said to Leslie, “Hey! You’re going to play someone that’s never been played before, a James Dean in Chinese ancient costume.” Leslie responded, “Oh, I know what you want to say.” Lin added, “This is the Chinese version of 'Romeo and Juliet’.” He said, “OK, I catch something.” “And a Chinese version of 'Blue Soldier’, this time it is the Mongolians as the Indians, and the Central people as the whites.”\n\n“The Bride With White Hair” only needed two months in the making process with a big budget of HK$40 millions. The classic costumes were designed by Japanese designer, Emi Wada (an Academy Award winner in a film which directed by Akira Kurosawa) and cameraman Peter Pau (he later won an Academy Award in “Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon”). When Brigitte Lin put on her costume, Leslie could not help praising her, “Che Che (big sister), your beauty is beyond comparison”. And Brigitte also admired Leslie in the classical costume, and reciprocated, “You’re also a stunningly beautiful Gor Gor (big brother).” Since that day, the entire crew called them Gor Gor and Che Che. Even now many people referred to Leslie as Gor Gor. In this film, Leslie and Brigitte had a steamy, hot scene whereby Leslie buried his face in Brigitte’s bosom. Brigitte Lin, a leading Mandarin actress of three decades said she only wanted to do this kind of scene with Leslie whom she trusted most and not with other actors like Chow Yun Fat or Tony Leung. This was her most erotic and sensuous scene of her entire career. In this film Leslie made a soundtrack and lyricist Lam Chik gave the song title Ie Sheng Chui Ai (“The Most Beloved in This Life”). Leslie and Brigitte’s roles were in fact sexually transposed, resulting in a soft Leslie and a firm Brigitte. There is also a pair of androgenic Siamese twins in the film, implying deranged sex in a deranged world.\n\n“Leslie Cheung was a rare breed of performer,” writes 'Life’ reporter, Winnie Chung. She had met Leslie on many occasions over the past decade mostly for work but also on the occasional odd night out at Central nightspots with mutual friends. Winnie visited Leslie on the “Bride With White Hair” shooting location. All impressions about Leslie were dancing in her mind especially that he was always proud of the way he looked. One of his frequent questions while twirling around in some new outfits would be “Doesn’t this look nice on me?” Leslie has always admitted to being narcissistic. It is one of the reasons why Winnie’s first interview with him, sitting in a Chinese restaurant in Malaysia with Anita Mui in 1987, had always been stuck in her mind. “I’m a narcissist,” he had purred. “I love the way I look and perform.” He was already on the fast track up the pop star chart then - one of the few who was just known by a first name. Unlike all the other Canto-pop singers who played it safe with boring, politically correct comments, Leslie was refreshingly honest. In a sense, this was what brought him his biggest headaches in the business. Unable to deal with his frankness, the press labelled him as arrogant and pitted him against rival Alan Tam. The comparisons did not please Leslie. In subsequent interviews and meetings with Leslie, he wavered between trying to be politically correct to win approval and being unable to hold back from voicing out his honest opinions. You could almost see him being torn apart. His narcissistic nature craved the public adulation and the limelight. Yet he also hated the strings that came with the fame, the criticism and the invasion of his privacy.\n\nOn one cold night Winnie was sitting in a lonely dressing room with Leslie on the set of “The Bride With White Hair”. In an unusually frank chat, Leslie was busy gossiping about an actress they both didn’t like. “Oh, she’s such a … ,” he said then, laughing with a carefree air that Winnie had never seen in him before. Since then, every time Winnie met him, he was more and more open as he became comfortable with himself, with little to lose in the battle for popular opinion.\n\nRonny Yu was of the opinion that working with Leslie Cheung as well as working with Chow Yun Fat was a great opportunity. All the time Ronny was with"
