        "text": "31 May - Singer Adam Cheng moved many recently when he apologised to his daughter for not being supportive enough with her showbiz career.\n\nAs reported on Epoch Times, the singer recently held his concert, \"Adam Cheng Half Century, Great Era\" and invited his daughter Joyce Cheng to perform with him.\n\nAfter performing the song \"Sai Bat Dai Tau\" together, the father and daughter kissed each other on the cheek, with Joyce saying, \"Congratulations of your half a century anniversary, daddy. Thank you for inviting me to share with you on your happiest day!\"\n\nAdam also thanked Joyce for cancelling all her other plans just to perform with him.\n\nThe singer then surprised Joyce to tears when he expressed how embarrassed he is for not helping her in her showbiz career.\n\n\"For years since you joined showbiz, I never helped you with it. The success that you have today is through your own struggle. I am proud of you,\" he said.\n\nAdam then turned to the audience and promoted Joyce's new movie.\n\nAccording to past reports, after Adam and Lydia Shum were divorced, Joyce rarely contacted her father in order not to disturb Adam's new married life with Koon Jing-wah and their two other children.\n\nWhile she did inherit Lydia's wealth of HKD 60 million after the latter's passing back when she was 21, Joyce had to work hard on her own since it was stipulated that the money can only be used after she turns 35.\n\nIn a previous interview, Joyce also revealed that there was a time when she only had HKD 26 in her account. However, she stressed that she would always try to improve her life on her own rather than ask her father for help.\n\nOn the other hand, Joyce recently shared a photo of herself still in her concert dress celebrating her 30th birthday at the event.\n\nShe wrote online, \"Wishing for perky tits, Michelle Obama arms, Khloe Kardashian's butt and Kim Kardashian's bank. Just kidding... (not really). My 29+1, my wish is simple, I just want everyone in my life to be healthy and happy.\"\n\n(Photo Source: Mingpao.com)"
