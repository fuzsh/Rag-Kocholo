She was affectionately known to peers and fans as Fei-fei.She appeared in numerous Hong Kong films and was an iconic TVB entertainer over forty years.For a brief spell in the 1990, Shum left TVB to work at rival ATV. Shum died on 19 th February,2008 from liver cancer, aged 62, following a prolonged bout of complications.Shum was born in 1945 in Shanghai, China, to her mum and dad. She entered the Hong Kong entertainment industry at the age of 13 in 1958. She made her film debut in 1960, joining Shaw Brothers as a teenage actress at the age of 15. She took some time to adjust to Hong Kong as she found the Cantonese cuisine very different from that of her native Shanghai.\n\n4 Work While she worked at Shaw Brothers, her popularity grew and she became one of the first stakeholders in the up and coming TV broadcast station TVB. In 1967, Shum's stardom took off with the popular television variety show ‘Enjoy Your Tonight’. She first sang in the Canto-pop group the Four Golden Flowers. Later, she played a Shanghai woman in the 1970. Shum has been established mainly as a comic and dramatic actress but is not limited to films in those genres. Shum starred in Singapore's Channel 5 sitcom ‘Living with Lydia’ and Cantonese series. Her performance in ‘Living with Lydia’ won her the \"Best Comedy Performance by an Actress\" award at the 2003 Asian Television Awards. It was also the first time she had acted in an English drama.\n\n5 Family Shum married actor and singer Cheng Siu Chow in January 1985 after 11 years of cohabitation. On January 5, 1985, Cheng and Shum flew to Vancouver, Canada where they got married. On May 30, 1987, Cheng Yan Yee was born to Shum and Adam Cheng. Eight months after their daughter was born, Cheng and Shum divorced. In September 2006, Shum was diagnosed with a liver tumor and cancer around the gallbladder. Doctors immediately removed one third of her liver. On February 19, 2008, at 3am, her family decided that Shum's life support should be withdrawn. It was decided that her breathing apparatus would be removed and that her family spend time with her by her bedside. Shum died at 8:38 a.m. on February 19, 2008. She was 62 years old.\n\n6 Opinion I like her because she was the champion. When the doctor told her she had cancer, she didn’t give up. In my opinion, she was very nice and kind, so I like her. I think Lydia Shum was a very courageous person so she is my role model. She was very scholarly and was a very good example to us. She was a professional actress so I admire her very much. When I knew she was dead, I felt very sad because she had given us lots of fun."
