        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 — Hong Kong celebrity Joyce Cheng is still alive and well, contrary to a viral social media post that she was found dead.\n\nThe Sunday post, which has since been deleted, claimed that Joyce’s body had been found, Dim Sum Daily reported.\n\nThis prompted her manager Sandy Lamb to deny the 36-year-old has died but she confirmed Joyce, who is the only daughter of comedian Lydia Shum and actor Adam Cheng, was indeed sick but was recuperating.\n\nLamb, however, did not reveal the nature of Joyce’s sickness that led to her absence from the public.\n\nJoyce’s disappearance for almost two months had set tongues wagging with rumours such as she was focusing on her relationship with hairstylist Benjamin or she was having a mental breakdown.\n\nHer absence was noticed when she failed to turn up for an awards show despite winning, Jayne Stars reported.\n\nShe had also seemingly disappeared from all her social media platforms with her last Instagram update of photos taken with Benjamin posted on April 26 besides failing to post any updates during her May 30 birthday.\n\nJoyce had last year inherited HK$60 million (RM35.9 million) of fortune left by Shum, who died of cancer in 2008 at the age of 60.\n\nIn her will, Shum had specified that Joyce could only withdraw HK$20,000 monthly from her fortune as part of her living expenses before getting the inheritance.\n\nJoyce had previously revealed that Shum was worried she (Joyce) would be struggling with financial management, hence delaying access to the inheritance until the age of 35 so she would work hard at her career."
