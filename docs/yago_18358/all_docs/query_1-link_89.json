On September 22 2006, the inflammation recurred. Four days later, it had complicated her liver and she went into a coma until October 1. Once again, on January 29 2007, she entered the operating room to remove a liver tumor which weighed 2.7 kg. On March 8 2007, the tumor was found to be growing so she had another cholecystectomy. Fact|date=February 2008\n\nOn November 1 2006, a 24-year-old Indonesian domestic helper, Triyuliarti Yuyun, was convicted of violating the Hospital Authority Ordinance and sentenced to four weeks in jail. Yuyun entered a ward at the Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) on October 1 2006 where Shum had been receiving treatment, and attempted to take photographs of Shum. [cite news |title=Maid jailed for filming sick Hong Kong actress |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Maid+jailed+for+filming+sick+Hong+Kong+actress+-a01610706156 |publisher=Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2008-03-07] Later, it was confirmed that Yuyun was a domestic helper to one of the employees of the local magazine, \"East Week\", but she had not been authorized to take photographs of Shum. East Week's senior management did not approve of the action and offered an apology to Shum. Magistrate Colin Mackintosh determined that Yuyun's actions were premeditated and done for financial gain and that the serious infringement of the patient's privacy warranted a custodial sentence. On that occasion, Shum was discharged from the hospital in July 2007."
