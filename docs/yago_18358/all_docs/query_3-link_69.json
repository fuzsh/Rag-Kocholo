        "text": "Joyce Cheng Yan-Yi\n\nJoyce Cheng Yan-yee (born 30 May 1987 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) is a Hong Kong Canadian singer, writer, actress, and performer based in Hong Kong. She is the daughter of late Hong Kong comedian Lydia Shum and singer/actor Adam Cheng. Cheng has been the focus of a variety of media articles due to her struggles with her weight. At a young age, she was 226.5 lbs. Determined to overcome her weight issues, Cheng started a strict fitness regimen at the age of 16. Her fitness program was recorded in her book, My Weight Loss Diary.\n\nIn 2005, Cheng played the part of Snow White in the Hong Kong Disneyland opening ceremony.\n\nCheng’s first music video, 靠自己, “Kao Zi Ji” (literally Depend on Myself) aired on the TVB prime time show Scoop in 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Cheng performed in the Tung Wah charity fundraising telethon, raising HK$310,000, which included a special HK$10,000 from her mother, Lydia Shum.\n\nIn February 2007, Cheng performed in the Chinese opera, The Grand Stage.\n\nCheng recorded and showcased her music video, Connected Hearts on an October 2007 episode of the popular Hong Kong television show, Enjoy Yourself Tonight.\n\nCheng released her debut album on 6 January 2011.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, together with Sam Sullivan, mayor of the City of Vancouver, agreed to proclaim the following 1 June (her mother’s Chinese birthday) to be “Fei Fei Day”.\n\nOn 10 May 2008, Joyce performed a part originally played by her mother, in a performance from Lai Fa Palace during the 2008 Po Leung Kuk Charity Gala. Joyce will be doing charity work to mark this year’s Mothers Day, the first since her mother died.\n\nRecently, Joyce took part in the 512 Fundraising Campaign to help support the victims of the Sichuan disaster. Joyce spoke on stage about how a young mother in Sichuan had sheltered her baby from the falling rubble with her own body and remarked on how noble this self-sacrifice was. She said that she had just experienced her first Mothers Day without her own mother, but she knows that wherever her mother is, she will still be supporting her. She felt that in the same way, this young mother will still be supporting her child because the love of motherhood is great until the end. She hopes that the orphans will remember this and grow up as happy person.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, Joyce took part in a live radio show with fellow Hong Kong artiste Hins Cheung (張敬軒). The radio show was part of Ming Pao Weekly’s 40th birthday celebrations. During the outside broadcast on Metro Radio, Joyce and Hins sang an English a Capella duet live. The response from fans was overwhelmingly positive. Hins praised Joyce’s musical talent and added that he hopes they will be able to perform together on stage in the future.\n\nIn September 2008, Cheng launched her acting career on the hit TVB sitcom “Off Pedder” (畢打自己人）. Cheng’s character, Joyce Yu, was a recurring role on the sitcom which ran for 337 episodes. Cheng also sang the ending theme to the show, “No One Is Perfect” (無人完美）.\n\nIn March 2010, Cheng began filming a twenty episode drama with TVB, playing the sidekick to famed TVB actor Bosco Wong in the drama “Isolated Seven Day Romance” (隔離七日情（暫名））.\n\nOn 2 July 2010, Cheng signed to the Record Label, Stars Shine International Limited (星煥國際有限公司）.\n\nOn 31 July 2010, Cheng guest-starred in “Off Pedder” fellow co-star, Cholam Wong (王祖藍）’s first stage show at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium. Cheng performed in all three of the sold out shows and wowed audiences with her comedic ability."
