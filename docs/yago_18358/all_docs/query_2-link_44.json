        "text": "The Influence of Social Factors on Customer Purchase Intention in Using Wedding Organizer in Manado\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPandowo, Merinda; Tuwo, Hillary Julia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTrends in wedding business is being exported globally. There is market opportunity to make the proliferation of event organizer business to become wedding organizer. The Wedding organizer business is needed at this time for the success of wedding preparation and ceremony. Now social influences are not new to the wedding industry because most of the time couples, especially brides-to-be, are consulting to external parties in order to acquire ideas and suggestions on how to enrich the context a...\n\nCultural Archetype Contents for the Traditional Wedding\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIn Hee Ahn\n\n2012-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This research aims to perform a contextual study of the wedding customs, wedding procedures, and wedding costumes included in Korean traditional wedding culture, making use of cultural contents which form cultural archetypes. The range of wedding customs studied are set limits from the Joseon dynasty to ancient times, and, for wedding procedures and costumes, to the Chosun dynasty, when a wedding ceremony became the norm. Only wedding ceremonies performed among ordinary classes are included as subjects for this research; wedding ceremonies and costumes for court are excluded. The cultural archetypes developed within these boundaries suggest prior cultural content, developed beforehand. The research methods are focused on document records inquiry and genre paintings during the Joseon era, using museum resources as visual materials. The following is the outcome of this research: Firstly, wedding customs and procedures observed among folk materials are presented in chronological order. Secondly, the brides' and grooms' wedding costumes are also presented chronologically, differentiated by class-characteristics.\n\nWrestling on the Table: The Contemporary Wedding Meal in Latvia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAstra SpalvÄna\n\n2012-03-01\n\nI argue that the wedding ceremony reveals the shift from rites of passage to social distinction. This argument is developed by analysing how social and family relationships, value systems and the ethos as a whole have changed recently in Latvia. The use of the symbolic capacity of wedding food, denoting fertility and prosperity, provides the stability of the structure of the wedding feast, which also affects the structure of the marriage ceremony as a whole.\n\nThe wedding act in Serbia in the light of social changes: A study of traditional and contemporary ceremony\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaviÄeviÄ Aleksandra B.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Traditional form of getting married included wedding ceremony in which we had, among other rituals, obligatory church wedding. Church wedding was omitted in certain cases, as it was, for example, marriage of underage partners. When transformation of traditional life begun, church wedding was omitted more often, though it was still norm (in traditional and civilian law. In this period, traditional wedding ceremony was considered as popular way of marking the start of new wedding community. At the end of 19th and beginning of 20th century, the civilian ceremony of getting married was introduced, but most of couples still got married in church. This was custom until The Second World War, when the church form of wedding became undesirable. Communist ideology meant the complete breaking up with religious and national traditions. This brought to the reduction of numbers of church weddings, but not to their complete leaving. Economic crises, war destructions, low life standards and disturbance of system of values, at the end of 20th cent resulted in retraditionalisation processes as for instance, revitalization of church life, or some of itâs elements. Last few years in Serbia, young couples approach both the civilian marriage -because it is an obligation and the church marriage -because of different reasons: need to make continuity with historical heritage, or to invent new one. I will try to show this course of transformation of act of getting married, through analyses of social meaning of some wedding ceremony elements.\n\nThe Gorani Wedding Ritual â Between Individual and Collective Memory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJadranka ÄorÄeviÄ Crnobrnja\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper I will attempt to determine which contents are present in individual memories of weddings and underline the contents which contribute to the formation of commonplace memories within personal memories. By studying individual personal memories of a ritual practice, I will attempt to answer questions about the relationship between individual and collective memory. In the paper I will also consider the issue of the influence of individual memories on the construction of ethnic identity. The paper is based on an analysis of narrative discourse which has been adapted for ethnographic research. The Gorani wedding ritual represents a social practice which encompasses not only the influence of collective on personal remembrance and memory, but also the reverse. The Gorani wedding ritual is an example of a social holiday which, on a personal level creates a feeling of connection between individuals and their community, while on a collective level it creates conditions for the continuity of the Gorani community.\n\nA Comparative Study of McDonaldâs Wedding Narratives with the Model of Anchoring\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMimi Huang\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Fast-food giant McDonaldâs announced in 2010 that they would start hosting wedding ceremonies and receptions for couples who would like to get married in their restaurants in Hong Kong. This paper conducts a study comparing the differing representations of McDonaldâs wedding services through a narrative analytical approach. Specifically, this paper examines relevant discourses surrounding the launch of the corporationâs wedding services from the British media (e.g. Daily Mail, the Independent as well as public discourses in Hong Kong (e.g. McDonaldâs Hong Kong website, and CNNâs Hong Kong news.Â It is found that these narratives have a significant degree of discrepancy in depicting McDonaldâs wedding stories. These differences further raise the question of how differing narrative strategies are employed to conceptualise the brandâs emergent wedding narratives in a unique social-cultural environment.Â In the discussion of McDonaldâs wedding stories, the focus is placed on the cognitive and linguistic aspects of the discourse. An analytical model of âanchoringâ will be proposed and applied to investigate the cooperationâs marketing strategies as well as the mediaâs reaction towards such promotions. It is argued that a narrative can promote or demote a brandâs identity and position through the process of anchoring. It is further argued that anchoring is an important cognitive-psychological strategy in conceptualization and meaning construction.

Lee\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis study estimates the potential economic impact of samesex weddings on the State of New Jersey and concludes that the gain would be substantial. If New Jersey were to give same-sex couples the right to marry, that is marriage itself and not civil unions, the State would likely experience a surge in spending on weddings by same-sex couples who currently live in New Jersey, as well as an increase in wedding and tourist spending by same-sex couples from other states.

In the socialist period wedding music was condemned by the state and excluded from the category folk but was adored by thousands of fans as a counter-cultural manifestation. In the post-socialist period wedding music achieved recognition in the West but declined in popularity in Bulgarian as fusion music's, such as chalga (folk/pop, arose and as musicians faced challenges vis-Ã -vis capitalism. As the state withdrew and became weaker private companies with profit-making agendas arose. Although it inspired chalga, wedding music began to be seen in contrast to it, as folk music. Recently, fatigue with chalga and nationalistic ideologies are revitalizing wedding music.\n\nTHE WEDDING CEREMONY IN THE TRADITIONAL VILLAGES OF OLTENIA. PRELIMINARY RITES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnca CEAUÅESCU\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Marriage is the second most significant moment from a manâs life, an event that gives the opportunity of a rich display of folkloric manifestations. The ceremonial complex of the wedding mark, in a festive manner, the passing to another social statute. In Oltenia, it generally has a unitary structure, with small individualising elements, from one village to the other. The nuptial ceremony also presents in its development the three categories of rites, specific to the passing rites, such are: preliminary, liminary, post-liminary. Therefore, the nuptial scenario includes the existence of new rules and a logical succession in the development of the sequences. In the present material, we are going to stop on the customs from the stage that precedes the nuptial ceremony (wooing, discussing the dowry of the girl, the engagement, trying to point towards few dominant element of the phenomenon.\n\nModelling wedding marketing strategies: An fsQCA Analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnestis Fotiadis\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Aim of the study is to develop a model delineating customer perceptions on wedding marketing strategies in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Main objective of this paper is to analyse a category of special events: the wedding market sector in Kaohsiung, Taiwan by examining how they attract consumers regarding their marketing strategies using the method of fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA. Based on a survey to married, in relationship and singles local citizens of Taiwan the relationships between impressions, importance, push factors with decision making was explored. To test the hypotheses of the proposed model a primary research study was conducted employing a mall intercept technique via distribution of a self-administered questionnaire within a cross sectional on-site field research context. A fsQCA modelling approach technique was employed in order to measure, estimate and confirm the different casual paths constructs, as well as to test the significance of the paths between different segments of the wedding industry. Our findings reveal that the presence of importance, push factors and decision making determines the level of consumer perception performance. However, impressions do not show significant impact on consumer perceptions.\n\n76 FR 21637 - Safety Zone; Ford Estate Wedding Fireworks, Lake St. Clair, Grosse Pointe Shores, MI\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-04-18\n\n...-AA00 Safety Zone; Ford Estate Wedding Fireworks, Lake St. Clair, Grosse Pointe Shores, MI AGENCY: Coast... portion of Lake St. Clair River during the Ford Estate Wedding Fireworks.

However, the major concern of this study is to understand the portrayal of each gender along with the question that does such portrayal underlines the traditional gender roles and gender inequality. Taking a discourse analysis perspective, this study analyzes textual data from the lyrics of the seventeen wedding songs. The song selection was based on purposive sampling technique. The data were collected through transcription and recording of the audios of the songs. As a result of thematic analysis thirteen themes emerged, ten portraying the female gender and four portraying the male gender. These themes reveal important findings that support and reinforce the gender-based stereotypes and also reflect gender hierarchy, normative heterosexual relationships, kinship norms and gender subversions.\n\nA discourse analysis of Melengkan at a Gayonese wedding ceremony\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIrama Jaya\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Melengkan is a special form of the Gayonese language which is spoken in poetry, lyrics, and proverbs. This study investigated its use as poetry specifically in wedding ceremonies held in Gayo, Aceh, Indonesia. The data was collected by observations and a video-recording of a traditional Gayonese wedding ceremony, as well as from interviews with melengkan speakers. We described and analyzed the context of the use of melengkan, the form of melengkan, and the cultural values conveyed through melengkan used in the wedding ceremony. The findings showed that there were six types of melengkan: Melengkan Turun Caram, Melengkan Beguru, Melengkan Munyerah Rempele, Melengkan Munerime Rempele, Melengkan Munyerah Munenes and Melengkan Munerime Munenes. The values of melengkan are for remembrance of local knowledge, warnings from customary philosophy, warnings from religion, and also for giving advice and recall the history and beauty of melengkan speech. The context of using melengkan is to perpetuate and reflect cultural values, namely, politeness, respect, speaking softly, friendliness and resoluteness. These findings imply the importance of conserving melengkan as part of the Gayonese culture in every part of their life.\n\nA short note from the history of traditional music of the Serbs in Vojvodina: To mark two hundred years of the first recorded wedding song\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKarin Vesna\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The well-known wedding song 'Odbi se grana od jorgovana' dates back to 1815 when it was recorded by Franciszek Mirecki. It was sung to him by a woman who was Vuk StefanoviÄ KaradÅ¾iÄ's informant (DeviÄ, 1991: 129. Specific in its character and melodic pattern, the wedding song held an important position in the wedding ceremony of native Serbs in the region of present-day Vojvodina. In the year of 2015 it had been exactly two hundred years since it was first notated.\n\nClostridium perfringens in London, July 2009: two weddings and an outbreak.\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nEriksen, J.; Zenner, D.; Anderson, S.

Wedding photos provide an opportunity to directly observe a realistic representation of close interracial friendships and race relations. An analysis of 1,135 wedding party photos and related information shows that whites are especially unlikely to have black friends who are close enough to be in their wedding party. Adjusting for group size, whites and East and Southeast Asians (hereafter E/SE Asians) are equally likely to be in each other's weddings, but whites invite blacks to be in their wedding parties only half as much as blacks invite whites, and E/SE Asians invite blacks only one-fifth as much as blacks invite E/SE Asians. In interracial marriages, both E/SE Asian and black spouses in marriages to whites are significantly less likely than their white spouses to have close friendships with members of their spouse's race.\n\nReport of Didymocystis wedli Ariola, 1902 (Digenea; Didymozoidae from Thunnus albacares in Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA Kohn\n\n2001-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Didymocystis wedli a parasite from the gills of Thunnus albacares from the coast of the State of Rio de Janeiro, is described by use of light and scanning electron microscopy.

To some extent, wedding customs completely reflect one ethnic' s culture development and represent its symbolic and special traditions. As a stream of culture, Mongolian wedding tradition and Scottish wedding tradition display their differentiation not only as a national symbol, but also as an element of transmission and inheritance of ethnic culture, religion and geography.\n\nGENDER ROLES IN PAKISTANI-URDU WEDDING SONGS\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSyeda Bushra Zaidi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis qualitative study of Pakistani-Urdu wedding songs allows a closer look at the gender situation, and towards the understanding of the process of construction and perpetuation of gender-based stereotypes.

The investigation aimed to confirm the causative agent, to identify the mode of transmission and to implement appropriate preventive measures. A probable outbreak case was defined as a wedding guest with diarrhoea or vomiting with disease onset from 7 to 10 October 2012 and who consumed food at the wedding dinner prepared by a hotel in the province Salzburg on 6 October 2012. A confirmed outbreak case fulfilled the criteria of a probable outbreak case and had a laboratory-confirmed NV infection. We conducted a cohort-investigation among the wedding guests. The case definitions were fulfilled in 26 wedding guests (25Â %) including 2 confirmed cases. Females were 3.2 times more likely to develop disease (95Â % CI 1.4-7.2) as compared to males. A mushroom dish was found to be associated with disease risk among females (risk ratio 2.3, 95Â % CI 1.2-4.3). Two of 2 tested case-patients and 6 of 14 kitchen workers tested were positive for NV GII.4 Sydney. One kitchen staff-member worked during the wedding dinner despite diarrhoea. No food safety training was documented for the employees and the kitchen staff's restroom was lacking operational facilities for hand hygiene. We report the first investigated outbreak due to GII.4 Sydney, which was likely due to a symptomatic kitchen worker. Gender-specific eating behaviour may have posed female guests at higher risk of NV infection.\n\n''Your Big Wedding Day''.

The study concluded that ethnic wedding traditions of Javanese Islam in Selangor pointed to the high level of acculturation. The acculturation leads to a âsubstitutionâ and âsyncretismâ. The substitution refers to the meaning that the Javanese tradition for the most replaced with new cultures (Malay.

It also tests whether any such effects depend on the nature of the image (gay or lesbian couple, kissing or not) and viewer characteristics (sex, age, race, education, religion, and ideology). Results show that exposure to imagery of a gay couple kissing reduced support for gay marriage relative to the baseline. Other image treatments (gay couple not kissing, lesbian couple kissing, lesbian couple not kissing) did not significantly influence opinion.\n\nAnalysis of Reasons for the Differences between Chinese and Western Wedding Customs---From the Perspectives of Religion and Color of Wedding Dress%ä¸­è¥¿å©ä¿å·®å¼çæå æ¢æ--ä»¥è±æ±å®æèæ¯ãå©ç¤¼æé¥°é¢è²è¯æä¹å·®å¼ä¸ºè§è§\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe wedding custom is an essential part of tradition custom s.

Several authors have challenged this view......, though.

Objective: We propose a method to explore statistical properties of agent-based demographic models. By coupling rule-based explanations driving the agent-based model with observed data we wish to bring agent-based modelling and demographic analysis closer together. Methods: We present a Semi-Artificial Model of Population, which aims to bridge demographic micro-simulation and agent-based traditions. We then utilise a Gaussian process emulator - a statistical model of the base model - to analyse the impact of selected model parameters on two key model outputs: population size and share of married agents. A sensitivity analysis is attempted, aiming to assess the relative importance of different inputs. Results: The resulting multi-state model of population dynamics has enhanced predictive capacity as compared to the original specification of the Wedding Ring, but there are some trade-offs between the outputs considered. The sensitivity analysis allows identification of the most important parameters in the modelled marriage formation process. Conclusions: The proposed methods allow for generating coherent, multi-level agent-based scenarios aligned with some aspects of empirical demographic reality. Emulators permit a statistical analysis of their properties and help select plausible parameter values. Comments: Given non-linearities in agent-based models such as the Wedding Ring, and the presence of feedback loops, the uncertainty in the model may not be directly computable by using traditional statistical methods. The use of statistical emulators offers a way forward.\n\nClostridium perfringens in London, July 2009: two weddings and an outbreak.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEriksen, J; Zenner, D; Anderson, S R; Grant, K; Kumar, D\n\n2010-06-24\n\nFood poisoning outbreaks caused by Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin occur occasionally in Europe but have become less common in recent years. This paper presents the microbiological and epidemiological results of a large C. perfringens outbreak occurring simultaneously at two weddings that used the same caterer. The outbreak involved several London locations and required coordination across multiple agencies. A case-control study (n=134) was carried out to analyse possible associations between the food consumed and becoming ill. Food, environmental and stool samples were tested for common causative agents, including enterotoxigenic C. perfringens. The clinical presentation and the epidemiological findings were compatible with C. perfringens food poisoning and C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in stool samples from two cases. The case-control study found statistically significant associations between becoming ill and eating either a specific chicken or lamb dish prepared by the same food handler of the implicated catering company. A rapid outbreak investigation with preliminary real-time results and the successful collaboration between the agencies and the caterer led to timely identification and rectification of the failures in the food handling practices.\n\nâWhere love can have its wayâ: Conformity versus Resistance in Brendan Kennellyâs Version of Federico GarcÃ­a Lorcaâs Blood Wedding (Bodas de sangre\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÃ ke Persson\n\n2009-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Considerable critical attention has been paid to Brendan Kennellyâs versions of the ancient Greek plays,Â Antigone,Â Medea, andÂ The Trojan Women, while his version of Federico GarcÃ­a LorcaâsÂ Blood WeddingÂ (Bodas de sangre has largely been ignored. This article examines the ways in which KennellyâsÂ Blood WeddingÂ challenges fixed gender patterns and traditional social codes. Thus, although set in 1930s rural Spain, the play resonates with issues that have for long been central to Irish identity. Linking Lorcaâs artistic concerns to Kennellyâs, and locating the play within areas of great importance to Irish feminism, which questions traditional constructions of womanhood, the article argues that Kennellyâs play proposes a resistance to dominant behaviour, represented as highly restrictive, as well as to the unquestioning conformity to oppressive norms that prevent women, and men, from leading fulfilling lives. In other words, the article suggests that the play ultimately voices the possibility of change, the driving force of which lies in a kind of sisterhood. The play therefore takes part in a questioning and a renegotiation of Irish identity.\n\n'Can I be bridesmaid?'

The tradition of betashar (meaning Â«opening the face of a new brideÂ» is one of the important traditions of wedding ceremonies of the Kazakh people. Betashar is a vivid tradition in all regions of the Kazak land, passing from one generation to the next. This ceremony is performed by a cheerful, silver-tongued, respectable and young poet. A song accompanying the ceremony of removing shawl from the brideâs face is the most significant part of the betashar. The Betashar ritual is a tradition maintained within the family with great enthusiasm. The most important goal of the Betasar tradition is to guide the new bride to get used to new family life by the introducing new family members and the ease of getting used to a new family life , with the help of the song Â«betasharÂ». Presentation of betashar is an extremely solemn and very picturesque event. After betashar, the ritual as a part of which the new daughter in law serve tea to all of the relatives starts. The article highlights the regional variations in the Betashar ritual in Kazak land\n\nPorÃ³wnywalnoÅÄ w czasie informacji o wynikach dziaÅalnoÅci spoÅecznie odpowiedzialnej firm raportujÄ cych wedÅug zasad GRI\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHalina Waniak-Michalak\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available PorÃ³wnywalnoÅÄ w czasie informacji o wynikach dziaÅalnoÅci spoÅecznie odpowiedzialnej firm raportujÄ cych wedÅug zasad GRI The involvement of corporations in corporate social responsibility (CSR activities with respect for work- ers' rights and ethical principles brings tangible benefits to the enterprise. CSR activities can therefore be considered as an investment, the effects of which should be measured. CSR benefits derive from im- proved assessment of the corporation by the stakeholders and increased social trust. However, in order to achieve the desired results of CSR activities, it is necessary to provide adequate information to customers, employees and owners. Moreover, the measurement of CSR results is necessary to determine the effec- tiveness of the actions taken. The aim of the article was to answer the question if companies present the same measures in successive CSR reports and whether it is possible to compare the CSR activity results for successive years. Examination of 31 CSR reports for two consecutive editions of the reporting showed that companies change the number and type of disclosed measures.\n\nApplying Multi-Criteria Decision Aiding Techniques in the Process of Project Management within the Wedding Planning Business\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDorota GÃ³recka\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Numerous problems that emerge in the process of project management can be presented as multi-criteria issues and solved with the help of appropriate methods. The contracting authority, selecting one tender out of many available tenders, assesses them, taking into account various criteria, e.g. price, expected execution time and the contractor's experience. The owner of a company intending to purchase the fixed assets requisite for the realization of the project behaves similarly, i.e. the most advantageous model of the device is chosen, taking into account not only its price but also production capacity, energy intensity, noise emission, service availability, etc. From among many concepts, the investor has to choose a solution which frequently constitutes a compromise between price, functional properties, durability and aesthetics of performance, as well as safety of the utilization and impact on the environment. The choice of an investment location depends not only on the market, financial and supply factors, but also on so called soft factors such as the perceived quality of institutions and the attitude of local communities. All such situations can be described in the same way: taking into account preferences of the decision maker, the best possible choice must be made out of a finite set of alternatives evaluated according to a finite set of criteria. There are many different methods that can be used to aid a decision maker in this choice, including, but not limited to, techniques based on the outranking relation, verbal decision analysis and the MACBETH method. In this article, they will be compared and their applicability to different types of decision making problems will be considered. Furthermore, the PROMETHEE II method with a veto threshold will be presented within the text. Because the application of project management in the wedding planning business has gained wide popularity, as an illustrative example an empirical study of\n\nOntario's Experience of Wind Energy Development as Seen through the Lens of Human Health and Environmental Justice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSongsore, Emmanuel; Buzzelli, Michael\n\n2016-07-06\n\nThe province of Ontario has shown great commitment towards the development of renewable energy and, specifically, wind power. Fuelled by the Green Energy Act (GEA) of 2009, the Province has emerged as Canada's leader in wind energy development (WED). Nonetheless, Ontario's WED trajectory is characterized by social conflicts, particularly around environmental health. Utilizing the Social Amplification of Risk Framework, this paper presents an eight-year longitudinal media content analysis conducted to understand the role Ontario's media may be playing in both reflecting and shaping public perceptions of wind turbine health risks. We find that before and after the GEA, instances of health risk amplification were far greater than attenuations in both quantity and quality. Discourses that amplified turbine health risks often simultaneously highlighted injustices in the WED process, especially after the GEA. Based on these findings, we suggest that Ontario's media may be amplifying perceptions of wind turbine health risks within the public domain. We conclude with policy recommendations around public engagement for more just WED.\n\nThe Digital Exhibition and Keyimage Ontology / Dijital Sergiler ve Anahtar Resim Ontolojisi\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMÃ­cheÃ¡l Mac an Airchinnigh; Kalina Sotirova\n\n2008-01-01\n\n[English abstract]The Age of Image predates and is currently contemporaneous with the Information Age.

Through detailed narrative analyses of these two films with a focus on the structure of the plot, the key characters, and camera work, this article aims to answer the questions of how traditional Chinese culture continues to play into and conflict with the experiences of modern Chinese American families and how each film presents and resolves the tensions arising from a culture in transition. The article argues that the importance of studying the ways in which the protagonists try to come to terms with incompatible value systems, lies in the capacity of film to reveal the complex negotiation between tradition and modernity, as well as the socio-cultural specificity of the conceptions of modernity.\n\nLa femme du mÃ©nage The \"perfect wife\".

Les temporalitÃ©s des hommes et des femmes divergent progressivement au cours des diffÃ©rentes Ã©tapes de la prÃ©paration du mariage (de lâÃ©laboration du projet jusquâau jour J en passant par lâorganisation de la fÃªte. Les femmes consacrent toujours plus de temps au collectif que les hommes. La cÃ©rÃ©monie de mariage ne constitue donc pas seulement une Ã©tape de formation du couple mais aussi un point dâancrage et dâincorporation du Â«Â partage inÃ©galÂ Â» du travail domestique au sein du couple. Au cours dâune sÃ©rie dâÃ©preuves symboliques et techniques quâelles traversent pour se mÃ©tamorphoser en mariÃ©e et en Ã©pouse, les femmes apprennent progressivement Ã devenir la femme du mÃ©nage.This article studies the sexual division of labour when organizing the wedding ceremony. Menâs and womenâs temporalities gradually diverge through the various steps of wedding preparation (from elaboration of the project up to the \"big day\" itself. Women spend more time than men on collective tasks. Â The wedding ceremony is not only a key moment in founding the couple, but also a step towards instituting and embedding the âunequal sharingâ of domestic work within the couple.

Drawing on the risk society framework, we conduct a longitudinal media content analysis to document and analyze perceptions of and responses to WED over a nine year period. Attention is paid to temporal variations in responses relative to Ontario's Green Energy Act (2009) (henceforth GEA); legislation aimed at the rapid expansion of renewable energy. The study reveals that the most radical forms of resistance to WED on health grounds are driven by perceived injustices in the treatment of potential at-risk citizens and citizens with health concerns. The GEA is fuelling these perceptions of injustices in subtle and nuanced ways, particularly by acting as a major confounder to health risk concerns. Contrary to several existing studies, we problematize the use of financial incentives to foster the development of wind energy. We also provide policy recommendations which include the need for increased public engagement in the WED process, the importance of using third party health and environmental assessments to inform developments as well as the need for post-development strategies to address ongoing community concerns. - Highlights: â¢ We analyze health risk perception-based responses to wind energy development. â¢ Health risks concerns are a major driver of public resistance to wind energy. â¢ Perceptions of injustices strongly fuel resistance to wind energy on health grounds. â¢ Acceptance of turbines does not imply successful coexistence with turbines. â¢ Using financial benefits to promote social acceptance could be problematic\n\nThe application of welat latino for creating paes in solo wedding bride\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIhsani, Ade Novi Nurul; Krisnawati, Maria; Prasetyaningtyas, Wulansari; Anggraeni, Puput; Bela, Herlina Tria; Zunaedah, Putri Wahyu\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe purposes of this research were: 1) to find out the process of creating innovative welat, 2) to find out how to use innovative welat for Solo wedding bride paes creation.

The results emphasize the importance of SNS use for tourists to seek support from their social network while traveling. The study clarifies the importance of SNS use for tourism experience, in that the more tourists are engaged in social activities through SNS while traveling, the more social...... support they will get, which will contribute positively to their tourism experience. Also, it is argued that social support does not always directly result from the intense SNS use, but rather moderated by tourists' self-presentation strategies....\n\nWedding songsâ melodic models of eastern Å umadija and Pomoravlje regions: A contribution to Serbian vocal dialects and identity studies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJovanoviÄ Jelena\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Extremely complex picture of Å umadija region musical tradition(s could be explained not only as the result of long-lasting encounters and overlapping of different inhabitantsâ groups, but also by the fact that in this region even three dialects of Serbian language meet. Moreover, there is a basis for an assumption it is about cultural dialects in wider sense, comprising musical culture as well. Structural-typological analyses of wedding melodic models (glasovi and identifying of their morphological dominants (term coined by V. Maciewskii provided the basis for comparative insight in the elements of vocal tradition in the area in focus â on the first place within wedding genre, but within other genres as well. The cartography technique, applied in melogeographic researches (Goshovskii, provides insight in certain musical phenomena in their territorial dissemination, so that the regularities that could be in direct connection to dialectal features of traditional culture could be seen. The paper is about geographical and cultural space intersected by folklore dialectal borders, and thus it is also the region where the transitory areas between the consistent cultural spaces are placed. This situation has been explained and illustrated through the application of âfuzzyâ concept. Musical material from this region and its elements geographic distribution shows it could be about the âfuzzyâ border between two cultural and vocal dialects. This paper could be the basis for future research and analyses, including more data from this and surrounding regions, primarily in the East, South and Southeast, which would lead to the differentiating of the musical idiom that characterizes great part of central, Eastern, Southern and Southeastern Serbia.

We focus on this homoepitaxial thin film growth process below 200 K. The unstable multilayer growth mode derives from the presence of a large Ehrlich-Schwoebel step-edge barrier, for which we characterize both the step-orientation dependence and the magnitude. Step-dynamics modeling is applied to further characterize and elucidate the evolution of the vertical profiles of these wedding-cake-like mounds. Suitable coarse-graining of these step-dynamics equations leads to instructive continuum formulations for mound evolution.\n\nSocial Media in Educational Practice: Faculty Present and Future Use of Social Media in Teaching\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nEsteve Del Valle, Marc; Gruzd, Anatoliy; Haythornthwaite, Caroline; Paulin, Drew; Gilbert, Sarah\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper presents results from a questionnaire (n=333) designed to gain an understanding of instructor motivations and experience with social media use in educational practice.

Social networks have been studied for years in many social science fields. The methods continue to advance but remain unknown to most nursing scholars. Discussion paper. English language and interpreted literature was searched from Ovid Healthstar, CINAHL, PubMed Central, Scopus and hard copy texts from 1965 - 2017. Social network analysis first emerged in nursing literature in 1995 and appears minimally through present day. To convey the versatility and applicability of social network analysis in nursing, hypothetical scenarios are presented. The scenarios are illustrative of three approaches to social network analysis and include key elements of social network research design. The methods of social network analysis are underused in nursing research, primarily because they are unknown to most scholars. However, there is methodological flexibility and epistemological versatility capable of supporting quantitative and qualitative research. The analytic techniques of social network analysis can add new insight into many areas of nursing inquiry, especially those influenced by cultural norms. Furthermore, visualization techniques associated with social network analysis can be used to generate new hypotheses. Social network analysis can potentially uncover findings not accessible through methods commonly used in nursing research. Social networks can be analysed based on individual-level attributes, whole networks and subgroups within networks. Computations derived from social network analysis may stand alone to answer a research question or incorporated as variables into robust statistical models.

A single-subject with multiple baseline across participants design was employed with three 4-year-old children to assess intervention effectiveness during structured table top activities. Observational data were digitally recorded, scored, graphed, and interpreted using 10-second interval measures over 5-min periods across baseline, intervention, and withdrawal phases. The combination of the social story together with the iPad proved to be an effective intervention for one of the three child participants. These findings confirm that the intervention may be effective with some children, but not others. Overall, this study builds on existing research that supports social stories as a promising practice. Further research into the use of iPad-presented social stories, particularly for children of varying ages, abilities, and learning styles is recommended.\n\nThe Impacts of Self-Presentation Strategies and Social Support on Tourism Experience\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKim, Jeongmi; Tussyadiah, Iis\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of how touristsâ self-presentation is managed on Social Networking Sites (SNS).

The times have changed and if the traditional etiquette cannot follow the steps of civilization, it will be eliminated. Contemporary Chinese weddings have become popularized and funerals religionized; however, they cannot completely meet the expectations of the Confucianists, but rather follow the development of etiquette, while conforming to the principles underlying the legislation and implementation of the rules of etiquette. Furthermore, integration can be found in the phenomenon of popularized weddings and religionized funerals, fully making it obvious that religious behavior has combined with the local wedding ceremonies. Because of the influence of Taoism and Buddhism, local folklore characteristics can be seen in funeral rites. As a result, if the connotations of the etiquette are maintained, whether it is a popularized or religionized ceremony, such etiquette can still be accepted by the society.\n\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL: HISTORY AND PRESENT\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVlad ROÅCA\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this descriptive research is to present what kind of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities English football clubs are implementing.

The situation of being esteemed is an extension of individuality. Together with social media, individuals can build new individualities right along with the present. Social media offers individuals a new âindividuality areaâ. As a socialization medium, social media also lays the grounwork for a consumption of individualism during daily use. Different than consumption in real life, it is allowed for individualâs consumption of individualism by texts, visuality, varied connections and comments in social media. At the same time, individual also exhausts his or her own individualism during construction process of his or her own individualism. Consumption of individualism in daily life, seems to find its imaginary equivalent in social media. Individual realizes a consumption by sharing in social media what he or she eats, places he or she visits or shops in real life. In this way,individual both is able to reach more wide areas and to continue to be on the agenda. Social media offers individuals this chance. Individual can be on the agenda as he or she consumes and shares to the extent. As soon as the individual achieves this, he or she can gain admiration and comment; but at the moment he or she becomes silent, individual encounters the risk of falling down the agenda. So, individual trends to expend more in real life tos tay active in virtual world. The agenda in the real world is not enough anymore. Individual is wishing to deploy on a much more broad area in virtual world. In this respect, the work takes individualâs dilemma of construction and consumption of individualism which he or she builds on social media, as its case.\n\nExperiment.com's first $1M - case studies and trends in online scientific crowdfunding\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLuan, D.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nExperiment is an online platform for connecting scientists and communities of online donors.

Some studies suggest that social style may influence the way in which an individualâs performance is evaluated. We studied the effects that speakersâ and evaluatorsâ social styles have on the marks given for end-of-term presentations in a project engineering masterâs course. The participants completed a self-evaluation exercise that classified their social styles into one of four categories: Driver, expressive, analytical, or amiable. Students individually rated the content and appearance of their classmatesâ presentations. A statistical analysis of these scores revealed that the speakerâs social style had a significant effect on the marks received for content and appearance. The evaluatorâs social style also demonstrated a statistically significant effect on the marks given for appearance, though not for content. Students with expressive social style received the highest scores, while the analytical style received the lowest scores. These results reiterate the necessity to train students as evaluators in order to reduce bias when evaluating their classmates and co-workers during their academic and professional careers.\n\nResponses to a self-presented suicide attempt in social media: a social network analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFu, King-Wa; Cheng, Qijin; Wong, Paul W C; Yip, Paul S F\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe self-presentation of suicidal acts in social media has become a public health concern. This article centers on a Chinese microblogger who posted a wrist-cutting picture that was widely circulated in Chinese social media in 2011. This exploratory study examines written reactions of a group of Chinese microbloggers exposed to the post containing a self-harming message and photo. In addition, we investigate the pattern of information diffusion via a social network. We systematically collected and analyzed 5,971 generated microblogs and the network of information diffusion. We found that a significant portion of written responses (36.6%) could help vulnerable netizens by providing peer-support and calls for help. These responses were reposted and diffused via an online social network with markedly more clusters of users--and at a faster pace-- than a set of randomly generated networks. We conclude that social media can be a double-edged sword: While it may contagiously affect others by spreading suicidal thoughts and acts, it may also play a positive role by assisting people at risk for suicide, providing rescue or support. More research is needed to learn how suicidally vulnerable people interact with online suicide information, and how we can effectively intervene.\n\nIt participates in the 97th learning lecture, social meeting; Dai 97 kai Gakujitsu koenkai{center_dot}konshinkai ni sankashite\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMaruta, T.; Moriya, M.; Izumi, K.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nAn inorganic material academic meeting the 97th learning lecture, a social meeting and a study tour meeting were held for both days of (Thu) for 5 days in November 4 (Wed), the 10th year of Heisei.

Les contrastes existants entre ces deux fÃªtes se rÃ©vÃ¨lent notamment Ã travers les repas servis Ã cette occasion. La fÃªte traditionnelle offre des plats et des boissons considÃ©rÃ©s comme Â«Â africainsÂ Â», tandis que le repas servi lors de la fÃªte civile se compose essentiellement de tubabu dumuni ou Â«Â nourriture des BlancsÂ Â». La maniÃ¨re de manger amplifie Ã©galement la distinction observÃ©e entre les deux fÃªtes: lors du repas traditionnel, les gens mangent dans les mÃªmes plats et avec la main, alors quâÃ lâoccasion de la cÃ©rÃ©monie civile, ils utilisent assiettes, fourchettes et couteaux. A travers lâanalyse de ces deux formes de cÃ©rÃ©monies comme de leurs diffÃ©rences, cet article s'intÃ©resse au discours trÃ¨s prÃ©sent sur lâopposition entre Â«Â traditionnelÂ Â» et Â«Â moderneÂ Â» au Burkina Faso urbain.Muslims of Burkina Faso celebrate weddings in two distinct ways; a âtraditionalâ celebration accompanies the religious ceremony, while a âcivilâ wedding party marks the official marriage which takes place at the town hall. The foods served are important markers of the contrasts between these two occasions. While so-called âAfricanâ food and drink is served at the traditional ceremony, the civil ceremony is marked by the serving of tubabu dumuni or âwhite manâs foodâ. Another distinction is the manner of eating. At the traditional meal guests eat from shared bowls, using their hands, while at the âcivilâ celebration the food is served on plates and is meant to be eaten with cutlery.

To verify the usefulness of a new instrument, the Social Responding Task, for investigating whether, in social decision making, individuals with TBI, who present inappropriate social behavior (ISB), have difficulty anticipating their own feelings of embarrassment and others' angry reactions following an ISB. Seven subjects with TBI presenting with inappropriate social behavior (TBI-ISB), 10 presenting with appropriate social behavior (TBI-ASB), and 15 healthy controls were given 12 hypothetical scenarios three times, each time ending with a different behavioral response. Subjects were asked to gauge the likelihood of their displaying the behavior in that situation (part A) and of it being followed by an angry reaction from the other or by feelings of embarrassment in themselves (part B). TBI-ISB subjects scored higher than TBI-ASB and healthy controls on a scale of likelihood of displaying an ISB. RESULTS regarding expectations of angry reactions from others and feelings of embarrassment after an ISB were similar among groups. Negative correlations between endorsement of an inappropriate behavior and anticipation of negative emotional consequences were significant for both TBI-ASB and control subjects, but not for TBI-ISB subjects. RESULTS suggest that the TBI-ISB participants were likely to endorse an ISB despite being able to anticipate a negative emotional response in themselves or others, suggesting that there were other explanations for their poor behavior. A self-reported likely response to hypothetical social scenarios can be a useful approach for studying the neurocognitive processes behind the poor choices of individuals with TBI-ISB, but the task needs further validation studies. A comprehensive discussion follows on the underlying mechanisms affecting social behaviors after a TBI.\n\nResponse to Hypothetical Social Scenarios in Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury Who Present Inappropriate Social Behavior: A Preliminary Report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichel Ouellette\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Very little research thus far has examined the decision making that underlies inappropriate social behavior (ISB post-TBI (traumatic brain injury.

However, the prevalence and promotional strategies of pro-tobacco content in social media are still not widely understood. The goal of this study was to reveal what is presented by the tobacco industry, and how it promotes itself, on social media sites. The top 70 popular cigarette brands are divided into two groups according to their retail prices: group H (brands with high retail prices) and group L (brands with low retail prices). Three comprehensive searches were conducted on Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube respectively using the top 70 popular cigarette brands as keywords. We identified tobacco-related content including history and culture, product features, health warnings, home page of cigarette brands, and Web-based tobacco shops. Furthermore, we examined the promotional strategies utilized in social media. According to the data collected from March 3, 2014 to March 10, 2014, 43 of the 70 representative cigarette brands had created 238 Facebook fan pages, 46 cigarette brands were identified in Wikipedia, and there were over 120,000 pro-tobacco videos on YouTube, associated with 61 cigarette brands. The main content presented on the three social media websites differs significantly. Wikipedia focuses on history and culture (67%, 32/48; Ppromotional strategies used, sales promotions exist extensively in social media. Sales promotion is more prevalent on YouTube than on the other two sites (64%, 39/61 vs 35%, 15/43; P=.004). Generally, the sale promotions of higher-cost brands in social media are more prevalent than those of lower-cost brands (55%, 16/29 vs 7%, 1/14; Ppromotion in social media.\n\nDo highly cited clinicians get more citations when being present at social networking sites?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFatemeh Ramezani-Pakpour-Langeroudi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nConclusion: It seems putting the papers in social networking sites can influence the citation rate.
