After she successfully shed her excess pounds in 2004, Joyce became an image representative for a fat-reducing product. After the death of her mother in 2008, close friends had hoped to guide and support Joyce's career, but the spoiled girl seemed to have no desire to progress and improve. Recent media reports included photos of her indulging in nightclub revelry with her boyfriends."
