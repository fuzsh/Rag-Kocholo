        "text": "Hong Kong actor and singer\n\nNot to be confused with Adam Chen.\n\nAdam Cheng Siu-chau (born 24 February 1947; formerly known as Cheng Chong-sai and Wong Ho-chung) is a Hong Kong TVB actor and Cantopop singer.\n\nCheng started his career in the 1970s, where he gained a reputation for playing the lead roles in TVB Wuxia drama series based on the works of Louis Cha and Gu Long, such as The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber and Chor Lau Heung. He also performed some of the theme songs of the TV series he starred in, such as The Greed of Man and Cold Blood Warm Heart.\n\nMain article: Ting Hai effect\n\nIn 1992, TVB released the TV series The Greed of Man, based on the central theme of the stock market and explored the schemes and plots used by people to make their fortune in the market. Cheng played Ting Hai (丁蟹) in the series, who made an immense fortune by short selling derivatives and stocks during a bear market. Many people went bankrupt while Ting Hai's family became richer until they were defeated by their nemesis. Cheng became popularly associated with the Ting Hai effect, named after his character in the series. The effect involves a peculiar and unexplained phenomenon, in which global stock markets will fall whenever a new Hong Kong TV drama series, starring Cheng, is aired.\n\nAdam's parents are both university lecturers. He has four daughters. The oldest, Cheng On-yee, was from his first low-profile marriage that ended in divorce. He married well-known actress Lydia Shum in 1985 after 14 years of cohabitation, and Shum brought him to fame. Adam and Shum had a daughter, Joyce Cheng in 1987. In 1988 they divorced eight months after their daughter's birth in bad terms.\n\nIn 1989, Cheng married a Taiwanese actress named Koon Jing-wah. Cheng and Koon have two daughters, Winnie Cheng Wing-yan and Cecily Cheng Wing-hei.\n\nAdam graduated from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1967 A Sweet Girl [1] The Black Killer Ng Chun Bong [2][3] I Love A-Go-Go [4] 1968 The Blossoming Rose Ng Aan Man [5] Blue Falcon [6][7] 1980 The Sword 1981 Shaolin and Wu Tang Chao Fung-wu Return of the Deadly Blade 1982 Cat vs Rat Fantasy Mission Force Amazon leader 1983 Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain Ting Yin Lone Ninja Warrior The Denouncement of Chu Liu Hsiang Chu Liuxiang 1984 Lover and Sword General Invincible 1988 Gunmen Haye Profiles of Pleasure 1989 Seven Warriors Path of Glory 1992 Painted Skin Scholar 1993 Fong Sai-yuk Chan Ka-lok guest star Fong Sai-yuk II Chan Ka-lok 1994 Drunken Master III Wong Kei-ying Shaolin Popey 2: Messy Temple Shaolin Popeye 2 – Messy Temple 2001 The Dark Tales 2003 Double Crossing 2013 Saving General Yang Yang Ye\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1975 God of River Lok Cho Chik 1976 Chinese Folklore The Legend of the Book and the Sword Chan Ka-lok / Kin-lung Emperor 1977 The Great Vendetta The Kingdom And The Beauty Luk Siu-fung Yip Koo-sing 1978 Vanity Fair The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber Cheung Mo-kei One Sword 1979 Chor Lau-heung Chor Lau-heung Over the Rainbow Wai Ching-lap 1980 Five Easy Pieces Odd Couple 1981 Brothers Four In Love and War The Hawk The Misadventure of Zoo Chu Gam Chun 1982 The Switch 1983 The Sandwich Man 1985 Chor Lau-heung Chor Lau-heung The Legendary Prime Minister – Zhuge Liang Chu-kot Leung 1986 Legendary of Wud The Legend of Wong Tai Sin Wong Tai Sin 1987 Fate Takes a Hand 1988 Behind Silk Curtains Final Verdict Challenge of the Imperial Palace 1991 Chronicles of Emperor Qianlong 1993 The Greed of Man Ting Hai 1994 Instinct Wong Tin Forty Something 1995 Chor Lau-heung Chu Liuxiang Cold Blood Warm Heart Ah Bong The Legendary Chin Lung II 1996 Once Upon a Time in Shanghai Yu Chun-hoi 1997 Legend of YungChing Yongzheng Emperor 2000 Divine Retribution Ting Yeh 2004 Blade Heart Ling Fung / Yu Man-fung The Conqueror's Story Lau Bong 2005 The Prince's Shadow Ko Sing 2006 Bar Bender Tony Tseung Nominated – TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor (Top 20)\n\nNominated – TVB Anniversary Award for My Favourite Male Character (Top 20) Inside the Forbidden City 2007 Return in Glory 2008 The Book and the Sword Qianlong Emperor 2009 The King of Snooker Yau Yat-Kiu God of Medicine 2012 Master of Play Kan Siu Nam Nominated – My AOD Favourite Award for Top 15 Character 2018 Ever Night Fu Zi (Sage Master) [8]\n\n[9] [10]\n\nAdam Cheng Siu-Chow at hkmdb.com\n\nAdam Cheng at senscritique.com\n\nAdam Cheng at IMDb"
