        "text": "ERP differences between processing of physical characteristics and personality attributes\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Limited data from behavioral and brain-imaging studies indicate that personality traits and physical characteristics are processed differently by the brain. Additionally, electrophysiological results of studies comparing the processing of positive and negative words have produced mixed results. It is therefore not clear how physical and personality attributes with emotional valence (i.e., positive and negative valence) are processed. Thus, this study aimed to examine the neural activity associated with words describing personality traits and physical characteristics with positive or negative emotional valence using Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Methods A sample of 15 healthy adults (7 men, 8 women) participated in a computerized word categorization task. Participants were asked to categorize visual word stimuli as physical characteristics or personality traits, while ERPs were recorded synchronously. Results Behavioral reaction times to negative physical stimuli were shorter compared to negative personality words, however reaction times did not significantly differ for positive stimuli. Electrophysiological results showed that personality stimuli elicited larger P2 and LPC (Late Positive Component) amplitudes compared to physical stimuli, regardless of negative or positive valence. Moreover, negative as compared with positive stimuli elicited larger P2 and LPC amplitudes. Conclusion Personality and physical stimuli were processed differently regardless of positive or negative valence. These findings suggest that personality traits and physical characteristics are differentially classified and are associated with different motivational significance.

We examined clinical, cognitive and experiential (i.e., reported childhood adversity) correlates of aberrant personality traits in schizophrenia and healthy controls (HC) as measured by the International Personality Disorder Examination Questionnaire (IPDEQ). Participants were 549 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 572 healthy adults recruited to the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). Schizophrenia participants were significantly more likely than healthy controls to screen positive for personality disorder across all ICD-10 subtypes, and there was substantial overlap between clusters, with â¼33% of Sz participants screening positive for all 3 personality disorder clusters. Among both Sz and HC groups, cluster B personality characteristics were significantly associated with increased suicidal behaviours, lower cognitive performance, and the experience of childhood adversity. In addition, Cluster C personality features were associated with higher overall ratings of affective blunting in schizophrenia, and Cluster A personality features were associated with childhood 'loss' in HC participants only. The cumulative effects of screening positive for more than one personality disorder in Sz was associated with higher likelihood of suicidal behaviour, earlier age of onset of Sz, and poorer cognitive functioning. The results suggest that abnormal co-occurrence of personality traits across DSM-IV clusters is evident in a significant proportion of individuals with schizophrenia, and that these personality features impact significantly on clinical and cognitive characteristics of Sz.

Etiologic factors that have been reported include hematologic or vitamin deficiencies, denture factors, the climacteric, infections or endocrinological disorders. On the other hand psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression and phobias have been reported to play a significant role at the beginning of this nosological entity. It seems therefore that there are two main categories of glossodynia, one with a detectable organic etiology and another with a psychologic origin. The purpose of this study was to provide further information concerning the personality characteristics and the incidence of psychopathology in patients suffering from glossodynia without an organic etiology. Twenty-five patients suffering from glossodynia and 25 control subjects, matched for sex and age, participated in the study. Patients and controls were assessed concerning their psychosomatic morbidity. Both groups were given psychometric instruments (SRSD, STAI, EPQ, HDHQ, SSPS) for the assessment of personality characteristics and psychopathological symptoms. Patients were significantly differentiated from controls with respect to all factors of HDHQ; they exhibited more hostility, either introverted or extroverted, than control subjects. The patients also had significantly higher values in the N (neuroticism) and the L (lie) factors of the EPQ. Concerning the other psychometric measurements there were no significant differences. Patients also had significantly higher rates of psychosomatic morbidity than controls. Our findings indicate that hostility-especially introverted hostility-neuroticism and possibly depression are important components of the psychological profile of patients suffering from glossodynia.\n\nA comparison of personality characteristics of male and female engineering students\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, Erin Beth\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate differences between personality characteristics of female and male freshmen, engineering students. A secondary purpose was to ascertain whether personality characteristics of freshmen, engineering students were different from those of general collegiate students of the same sex. The Millon Index of Personality Styles (MIPS) was administered to a sample of 72 female and 86 male freshmen, engineering students at a private midwestern engineering institution. The MIPS college normative sample of 1,600 college students was used as a comparison group. A total of 24 personality characteristics were assessed in the domains of motivation aims, cognitive modes, and interpersonal behaviors. Four hypotheses, which dealt with comparisons of the engineering samples, were tested by way of discriminant analyses. Two hypotheses, which compared the engineering samples to the collegiate samples of the same sex, were tested by way of t-tests. All six hypotheses yielded significant differences across various personality variables. It was concluded that engineering students of both sexes were more similar than different in personality characteristics. It was also concluded that there were greater personality differences between freshmen male engineering students and male college students than there are between freshmen female engineering students and female college students.\n\nCharacteristics associated with family money management for persons with psychiatric disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nLabrum, Travis\n\n2018-05-11\n\nPersons with psychiatric disorders (PD) commonly have their money officially or unofficially managed by others, with money managers most commonly being family members. (i) Identify characteristics of persons with PD, adult family members, and interactions with each other significantly associated with family money management (FMM). (ii) Identify significant differences in aforementioned characteristics between official versus unofficial FMM. Five hundred and seventy-three adults residing in USA with an adult relative with PD completed a survey. Among persons with PD, FMM was positively associated with lower income, diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective or bipolar disorder, psychiatric hospitalization, and arrest history. FMM was negatively associated with family members having a mental health diagnosis. FMM was positively associated with interaction characteristics of co-residence, financial assistance, caregiving, and use of limit-setting practices. Compared to official FMM, when unofficial FMM was present, persons with PD were less likely to have been psychiatrically hospitalized or to have regularly attended mental health treatment. When unofficial FMM was present, adult family members were less likely to be a parent of the person with PD. Practitioners should assess the level of burden experienced by family money managers and assess and address with family money managers the use of limit-setting practices.\n\nAntecedent Personality Characteristics of Alcoholics.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLoper, Rodney G.\n\nPsychological studies on personality characteristics obtained from individuals prior to being diagnosed as alcoholics are reviewed.

Personality traits and individual characteristics have been previously noted to influence internet usage, where older adults have not been the focus population. In this study, the relationships between personality, individual characteristics and internet usage were investigated. A descriptive analysis of the personality tests of a total of 1402 subjects included in the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care was conducted. Three variables were controlled for: sex, age and education. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, chi-square tests and a logistic regression were used in order to detect the relationships with internet usage. Men differ significantly from women in the personality traits analysis. Those with higher education were more open and neuroticism was lower in the oldest older adults. Internet usage declined significantly with age and those with middle to higher education were using the internet the most. No other associations with internet use were found. Personality traits and individual characteristics do not seem to influence the Swedish older adult and their internet usage. What one needs to account for is the age and education of the person. The more educated and the youngest cohorts were using the internet more frequently.\n\nPersonal characteristics of residents may predict competency improvement.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, EunMi; Ha, Patrick K; Eisele, David W; Francis, Howard W; Kim, Young J\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe hypothesized that personal characteristics of residents may affect how well competency is attained in a surgical residency. To this end, we examined two concepts of global trait emotional intelligence and learner autonomy profile and their factor relationship with competency outcomes in a residency program in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. A cohort study prospectively gathered competency change scores for 1 year and retrospectively analyzed the factor associations. We measured two personal characteristics using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form and Learner Autonomy Profile-Short Form between 2013 and 2014 in a tertiary otolaryngology-head and neck residency program. We prospectively examined faculty-rated resident competency scores monitored in the same time period and correlated the personal attributes with cumulative competency improvement scores. Statistical analyses included factor correlations and univariate regression. With a response rate of 64% (N = 16/25), we identified two statically significant predictors of competency improvement outcome attained by the end of the year. Regression analyses showed that emotionality factor of global trait emotional intelligence (P = .04) and learner autonomy profile (P < .01) were significant predictors for the higher improvement of aggregate competency outcome. Personal factors of individual residents can affect their improvement of overall competency. Practicing competency-based education should, therefore, include assessing individual resident factors as well as teaching clinical knowledge and technical skills.

In clinical practice and in previous studies, it has been observed that women with sexual problems experience anxiety problems and express more rigid and perfectionistic personality traits than women without these problems. To investigate whether personality disorder characteristics according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and psychological symptoms are associated with sexual problems in women. 188 women 18 to 25 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. Questionnaires measuring sexual functioning (Female Sexual Function Index), personality disorder characteristics (Assessment of DSM-IV-TR Personality Disorders Questionnaire), and psychological symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) were used. The main outcome measure used was sexual functioning assessed by self-report. Results, using analysis of variance, indicated that women with sexual problems report significantly more cluster A (specifically schizoid) and C (specifically avoidant and obsessive-compulsive) personality disorder characteristics than women without sexual problems. Furthermore, using multiple regression analyses, higher cluster A (specifically schizoid) and lower cluster B (specifically borderline and antisocial) personality disorder characteristics indicated lower levels of sexual functioning. Psychological symptoms partly mediated the effect of cluster A personality disorder characteristics on sexual functioning. The results of this study indicate that clinical practice should extend its scope by focusing more on improving adaptive personality characteristics, such as extraversion and individualism seen in cluster B personality characteristics, and decreasing the perfectionistic, introvert, and self-doubting characteristics seen in cluster C personality characteristics\n\nLooking for Students' Personal Characteristics Predicting Study Outcome\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVan Bragt, Cyrille A.

This present study, therefore, examined whether measures of hyperactivity-impulsivity, depression, anxiety and antisocial personality characteristics could collectively account for significant interindividual variability of both ERN and Pe amplitudes, in 29 healthy adults with no known disorders, ages 18-30 years. The bivariate zero-order correlation analyses found that only the anxiety measure was significantly related to both ERN and Pe amplitudes. However, multiple regression analyses that included all four characteristic measures while controlling for number of segments in the ERP average revealed that both depression and antisocial personality characteristics were significant predictors for the ERN amplitudes whereas antisocial personality was the only significant predictor for the Pe amplitude. These findings suggest that psychological symptoms and personality traits are associated with individual variations in error monitoring in healthy adults, and future studies should consider these variables when comparing group difference in error monitoring between adults with and without disabilities.

The Five-Factor Personality Inventory (short version) and the Quality of Relationships Inventory were administered to all participants. Stepwise multiple regression analysis assessed which of the five personality factors predicted scores for the different subscales of the Quality of Relationships Inventory (Depth, Support, and Conflict). Results indicated that depth of relationship was not predicted by personality factors. On the other hand, neuroticism and extraversion were significant predictors of support dimension of relationship. Analysis indicated that conscientiousness was the strongest predictor of conflict. In conclusion, athletes' personality characteristics may be important in determining the quality of the coach-athlete relationship.\n\nPersonality Characteristics of Children of Alcoholics.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBerkowitz, Alan; Perkins, H.

Sathyanarayana; Kuruvilla, K.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nSUMMARY A study is conducted for assessment of personality characteristic using EPI & 16 PF on wives of 30 primary alcoholics who satisfied Feighner's Criteria and were compared with the wives of 30 normal controls matched on imrital an socio-demographic variables. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on EPI and scores were within normal limits. Both the groups had a similar profile scores on 16 PF being submissive, timid, trustful, conventional, conservative, dependent and poised. These findings were not in favour of the concept of âPathological wivesâ causing alcoholism in their husbands as advocated by some western studies. Personality characteristics of our sample in general were significantly different from normative data for western women, where the latter were more dominant, a leventurous and self-sufficient. Implications of these findings are discussed in the light of our socio-cultural context.

This study aimed to examine the influence of personality characteristics and cognitive appraisals on self-discrepancy. Participants were 51 adults (74% male) with severe TBI (M ageâ=â36.22 years; SDâ=â12.65) who were on average 34 months (SDâ=â40.29) post-injury. They completed self-report measures of personality style (optimism and defensiveness), cognitive appraisals (threat appraisals, rumination and reflection and perceived coping resources), and self-discrepancy (Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale - III). Correlation analyses identified that higher levels of optimism, defensiveness and perceived coping resources were significantly associated with more positive self-discrepancy (râ=â.29-.47, pâ<â.05), whereas higher threat appraisals and rumination were significantly related to more negative self-discrepancy (râ=â-.50-.57, pâ<â.001). After controlling for personality characteristics, cognitive appraisals significantly accounted for self-discrepancy (R 2 changeâ=â.15). Moreover, rumination significantly mediated the relationship between optimism and self-discrepancy. In summary, cognitive appraisals were found to be related to self-discrepancy, independent of personality characteristics. Rumination in particular may be an important target of psychological intervention for individuals experiencing negative self-discrepancy.\n\nPersonal circumstances and social characteristics as determinants of landholder participation in biodiversity conservation programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoon, Katie; Marshall, Nadine; Cocklin, Chris\n\n2012-12-30\n\nAdequate conservation of biodiversity on private land remains elusive due, in part, to a failure to understand the personal circumstances and social characteristics of private landholders. Our aim was to identify those personal and social dimensions of landholders that might contribute to improved conservation policy and program design and, thereby, participation in private land conservation. We tested whether personal circumstances of landholders (e.g., lifestyle and wellbeing, information and knowledge, financial security) and social characteristics (e.g., attitudes, norms, and trust) would be important predictors of landholders' capacity and willingness to participate in biodiversity conservation programs. Forty-five participants and twenty-nine non-participants of biodiversity conservation programs in north Queensland, Australia, were surveyed to: 1) examine differences between their personal circumstances and social characteristics that may influence participation; and 2) explore whether personal circumstances and social characteristics were influenced by participation. The results revealed that, compared to participants, non-participants in conservation programs had significantly different personal circumstances and social characteristics for four of eight measured variables. Compared to participants, non-participants demonstrated a reduced capacity and willingness to participate in conservation programs. Participation did not appear to have a strong influence on participants' personal circumstances or social characteristics, and when social norms supported conservation, programs did not demonstrate additionality. Conservation policies that maintain or improve landholders' personal circumstances and that promote pro-environmental norms may result in increased participation and thereby conservation outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of personality types and interpersonal needs. A total of 171 students in Konyang University College of Medicine were examined using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior (FIRO-B). The data were analyzed by frequency analysis, t-test, and one-sample proportion test. The proportion of the 4 pairs of MBTI dimensions were Extroversion (E)-Introversion (I) (53.2% vs. 46.8%), Sensing (S)-Intuition (N) (63.2% vs. 36.8%), Thinking (T)-Feeling (F) (59.7% vs. 40.4%), and Judging (J)-Perceiving (P) (56.1% vs. 43.9%). The predominant personality types were ISTJ (16.4%), ESTJ (14.0%), and ESFJ (10.5%). The level of interpersonal needs were medium rage that was inclusion (mean=8.1), control (mean=8.8), affection (mean=8.1), expressed behavior (mean=12.1), wanted behavior (mean=12.9), and overall interpersonal needs (mean=25.0). Of the basic social needs, males and females differed significantly with regard to control needs (p=0.028). Educational programs that take into account personality types and characteristics of interpersonal needs are crucial in providing effective medical education. Our results suggest that the characteristics of personality types and interpersonal needs should be considered in developing an interpersonal relations improvement program for medical students.\n\nPersonality Characteristics of Engineers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nvan der Molen, Henk T.; Schmidt, Henk G.; Kruisman, Gerard\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe objective of the current study was to investigate the personality characteristics of a group of engineers with a variety of years of experience.

However, little is known about how the stigma of depression manifests among Arab adolescents, which makes it difficult to design, implement, and disseminate effective anti-stigma interventions for this vulnerable population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine levels of depression stigma among Arab adolescents. The specific aims were to (1) describe the severity of personal and perceived depression stigma among Arab adolescents and its relationship to severity of depression, and (2) determine characteristics associated with severity of depression stigma among Arab adolescents. This study was conducted in Jordan, a Middle Eastern Arab country. A nationally representative, school-based survey was utilized. A total of 2349 Jordanian adolescents aged 12-17 completed and returned the survey packets, which included measures on individual characteristics, depression severity, and depression stigma. The majority of the adolescents (88%) reported scores indicating moderate to high depression stigma. Adolescents reported higher rates of perceived stigma than personal stigma. Depression stigma was not significantly associated with severity of depression, but with adolescent's sex, age, region of residence, parents' education, and history of mental health problem. This is the first Arab study to isolate the influence of adolescent depression and personal characteristics on personal and perceived depression stigmas, and highlight the presence of these distinctions early in adolescence. Such distinction can inform the design and implementation of policies and interventions to reduce both personal and perceived stigma. The study provides important recommendations on when, how, and why to utilize school settings for anti-depression stigma interventions. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The children were evaluated using the Personality Inventory for Children (PIC), the Children's Personality Questionnaire (CPQ), and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R). There were few differences between the two molested groups or between boys and girls. However, comparisons of molested and non-molested children showed significant differences on 23 of 34 scales on the PIC and CPQ combined. WISC-R verbal IQs were also lower for the molested groups. While the lack of differences between the two molested groups may have been due to the parent-like relationship between the teacher and the children he molested, the results suggest that a relatively noncoercive style of abuse can still produce significant psychological impairment.\n\nPerson Characteristics of Individuals in Functional Assessment Research\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMatson, Johnny L.; Horovitz, Max; Kozlowski, Alison M.; Sipes, Megan; Worley, Julie A.; Shoemaker, Mary E.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper is a review of person characteristics that were present in 173 studies that were reviewed on functional assessment.

We implemented an anonymous self-administered questionnaire by postal mail. Using the Japanese version of the Ten Item Personality Inventory (which contains 10 items that measure the Big Five personality traits), we evaluated the following characteristics: \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Neuroticism\", and \"Openness\". The subjects who reported exercising regularly at the time of survey were considered persons with subjective exercise adherence.ResultsãIn persons with subjective exercise adherence, \"Conscientiousness\" was significantly lower (P=0.003) among men and \"Neuroticism\" was significantly higher (P=0.018) among women when compared to persons with subjective exercise adherence. There was no correlation between the things that emphasize exercise adherence and \"Conscientiousness\" among men. There was a negative correlation between \"can achieve goal\" and \"Neuroticism\" among women.ConclusionsãIt is essential to consider personality and gender differences when devising exercise adherence support measures for the MF program. Our results suggest that women with high neuroticism do not need \"can achieve goal\" to maintain their exercise habits; therefore, it is necessary to examine teaching methods that do not focus on only goal achievement as part of exercise adherence support for MF.\n\nPersonality Characteristics of Leaders Identifying with Different Student Subcultures.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrainard, Stephen R.\n\nThis study was conducted to discover differences in personality characteristics among student leaders.

Given the current difficulties experienced by Lebanese hospitals in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of nurses, the need to understand the reasons of nurses' dissatisfaction became urgent. Moreover, satisfaction at work is essentially a personal experience also affected by cultural factors. Therefore, it was necessary to study the links between personal characteristics and nurses' dissatisfaction. The study included 421 registered nurses. A modified version of Measure of Job Satisfaction, developed by Taynor and Wade, was used to assess the effect of the personal characteristics, namely educational level, age, years of work experience, position, and marital and parental status, on 5 dimensions of satisfaction: personal satisfaction, workload, professional support, pay and prospect, and training. The findings suggest that personal characteristics have important influences on nurses' job perceptions. University graduate nurses reported more dissatisfaction with the quality of supervision and with respect and treatment they receive from their superiors. Nurses younger than 30 years and the technically trained were more dissatisfied with the available opportunities to attend continuing education courses. Results of staff nurses and unmarried nurses showed trends of more dissatisfaction than the married and nurses of higher positions. Moreover, the whole sample perceived that nursing provided a high level of personal satisfaction, but nurses were most dissatisfied with salary and lack of prospects for promotion. The results indicate the importance of personal characteristics on nurses' retention. Furthermore, intrinsic factors related to the nature and experience of nursing are more job satisfying than extrinsic factors.\n\nExamination of personality characteristics in a Turkish sample: development of Basic Personality Traits Inventory.\n\nPubMed\n\nGenÃ§Ã¶z, TÃ¼lin; ÃcÃ¼l, Ãznur\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to test the cross-cultural validity of the five-factor nature of personality. For this aim, an indigenous, psychometrically strong instrument measuring the basic personality dimensions within Turkish culture and language was developed through three consecutive studies. The first study aimed to reveal the adjectives that have been most frequently used to define people in the Turkish culture. In the second study, factor analysis of these personality characteristics revealed big five personality factors, along with the sixth factor, which had been called as the Negative Valence factor. The adjectives that most strongly represented and differentiated each factor constituted 45-item \"Basic Personality Traits Inventory\". Finally, in the third study, psychometric characteristics of the Basic Personality Traits Inventory were examined. Factor structure and psychometric properties of this instrument confirmed that five-factor nature of personality may not hold true in every culture.\n\nSelf-Consciousness and Personality Characteristics among Prison Inmates.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDe La Serna, Marcelo; And Others\n\n1986-01-01\n\nExamined the personality characteristics of male prison inmates.

ALS experienced physicians ( nÂ = Â 36) were asked to assess the personality characteristics of ALS patients using a multidimensional personality questionnaire based on the five-factor model of personality. Control groups consisted of physicians experienced in Myasthenia gravis (MG) ( nÂ = Â 21) and lung cancer (LC) ( nÂ = Â 36). In the dimension Agreeableness ALS patients were rated significantly higher than the other groups ( pÂ < Â .001). This was mainly due to the high scores for converse adjective pairs \"stubborn-compliant\" and \"selfish-helpful\". The dimension Agreeableness is very similar to \"niceness\". Results support the anecdotal description of ALS patients as \"nice\" persons. Personality characteristics of ALS patients differentiate them from other patient groups. It remains open whether the \"nice\" personality structure is linked to the susceptibility to the disease.\n\nExploring the Innovative Personality Characteristics among Teachers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOthman, Nooraini\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of innovative personality among teachers in Malaysia.

In this study, we investigate whether attention to the sexual region in a video depends on the personality characteristics of men, assessing this with an eye-tracking system. The study included 30 healthy males with a normal psychological state, who viewed a sexual video in which the sexual region had been designated. Visual attention was measured across the designated region according to gaze duration. Ten types of personality characteristics were evaluated as a T-score by a questionnaire. By Pearson's correlation coefficient, the relations between gaze duration at the sexual region and T-scores of paranoia, psychasthenia and social introversion were found to be statistically significant. By multivariate stepwise regression analysis, only social introversion was negatively associated with the sexual region. Even normal variation of personality characteristics can affect the viewing period of the sexual region. This is the first report showing that subjects with a high degree of paranoia, psychasthenia and particularly social introversion have a tendency to view the sexual region for a shorter duration.\n\nPersonality characteristics of hospice palliative care volunteers: the ''big five'' and empathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nClaxton-Oldfield, Stephen; Banzen, Yana\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe goal of this study was to examine the personality characteristics of hospice palliative care volunteers by measuring the so-called big five personality traits and 4 separate aspects of empathy. A total of 99 hospice palliative care volunteers completed the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) of Costa Jr and McCrae and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) of Davis. The vast majority (84%) of the volunteers were females. Compared to the norms for adult females on the NEO-FFI, female hospice palliative care volunteers scored significantly higher on the traits of agreeableness, extraversion, and openness and significantly lower on the trait of neuroticism. On the empathy measure, female hospice palliative care volunteers scored significantly higher on the empathic concern and perspective taking subscales compared to the female norms, and significantly lower on the personal distress and fantasy subscales. The results of this study may have implications for the recruitment and retention of hospice palliative care volunteers.\n\nAnalysis of Personal and Home Characteristics Associated with the Elemental Composition of PM2.5 in Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air in the RIOPA Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRyan, Patrick H; Brokamp, Cole; Fan, Zhi-Hua; Rao, M B\n\n2015-12-01\n\nother information) for each RIOPA participant were downloaded from the RIOPA study database. We performed three sets of analyses to address the study aims. First, we conducted descriptive analyses to describe the relationships between elemental concentrations in the concurrently gathered indoor, outdoor, and personal air samples. We assessed the correlation between personal exposure and indoor concentrations as well as personal exposure and outdoor concentrations of each element and calculated ratios between them. In addition, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and calculated principal component scores (PCSs) to examine the heterogeneity of the elemental composition and then tested whether the mixture of elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 was significantly different within each study site and across study sites. Secondly, we performed model-based clustering analysis to group RIOPA participants with similar exposures to mixtures of elements in personal PM2.5. We examined the association between cluster membership and the concentrations of elements in indoor and outdoor PM2.5 samples and personal and home characteristics. Finally, we developed a series of linear regression models and random forest models to examine the association between personal exposure to elements in PM2.5 and (1) outdoor measurements, (2) outdoor and indoor measurements, and (3) outdoor and indoor measurements and home characteristics. As we developed each model, the improvement in prediction of personal exposure when including additional information was assessed. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and to most elements were significantly correlated with both indoor and outdoor concentrations, although concentrations in personal samples frequently exceeded those of indoor and outdoor samples. In general, for most PM2.5 elements indoor concentrations were more highly correlated with personal exposure than were outdoor concentrations. PCA showed that the mixture of elements in indoor\n\nHIV Risk, Substance Use, and Personality Characteristics among Adults with History of Serious Mental Illness.\n\nPubMed\n\nMainville, Cathryn H; Richardson, Mark A; Brady, Stephen M; Berger-Greenstein, Jori; Bacic, Janine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe present study examined the relationship between characteristics associated with personality disorders, substance use, and HIV risk among adults with a history of serious mental illness. Participants included 103 adults with antisocial or borderline personality disorder, serious mental illness, and recent HIV risk behavior. The sample was predominately male (64%), diverse (42% African American and 13% Hispanic), and homeless/marginally housed (76%). In order to examine the relationship between personality characteristics and risk we constructed a risk index comprising key symptoms of antisocial and borderline personality disorders, namely; impulsivity, affective instability, and disregard for safety of self/others. Contrary to our primary hypotheses, risk index scores did not predict HIV risk behavior and substance abuse did not mediate this risk. Exploratory analyses did reveal that women engaged in significantly more risk behaviors than their male counterparts and that risk scores were a significant predictor of total sex acts for women but not men. In addition, increased emotional dysregulation was a significant predictor of condomless sex acts for women but not men. Finally, recent alcohol use and increased impulsivity was associated with more condomless oral sex for men and women. These results suggest the relationship among serious mental illness, personality disorder, substance abuse, and gender is complex and merits further study.\n\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Characteristics of Parricide Offenders with Schizophrenia in Korea.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Sang Yeop; Lim, Myung Ho; Lee, Jangkyu; Shim, Geumsook; Kim, Yeon; Do, Jin Ah; Lee, Soo Jung; Choi, Jong Hyuck; Lee, Jae Woo\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThis study aims to examine the personality characteristics in parricide offenders, by using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test, which is commonly used in clinical medicine. A total of 73 parricide offenders with schizophrenia who were admitted to National Forensic Hospital in Gongju city between September 2014 and February 2015, and 104 comparison schizophrenia patients who had been admitted to Dankook University Hospital in Cheonan city the same hospital, completed the Korean version of the MMPI. The parricide offender group showed significantly higher on L, F, Hs, Hy and Pd than the comparison group. The result of the regression analysis indicated that Pd and Si significantly increased the odd ratio of the sexual offender group by 2.77 times and 0.32 times, respectively (p=0.029 and p=0.023). The offenders of parricide may have developed the following characteristics: hypochondriasis, hysteria and psychopathic deviate. These results suggested that the psychopatholgy in the offenders of parricide might be different, compared to the control group.\n\nPsychosocial job characteristics and psychological distress / well-being: the mediating role of personal goal facilitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPisanti, Renato; van der Doef, Margot; Maes, Stan; Violani, Cristiano; Lazzari, David\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study examined the mediating role of personal goal facilitation through work (PGFW), defined as perceptions of the extent to which one's job facilitates the attainment of one's personal goals, in the association between psychosocial job characteristics and psychological distress and job-related well-being. Questionnaire data from 217 nurses (84% female, with a mean age of 42.7 years, SD=7.2) were analyzed. Participants completed the following measures: the Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire for Nurses, Workplace Goal Facilitation Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, and Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (short version). A cross-sectional study design was applied. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. The results indicated that unfavorable psychosocial job characteristics (high demands, low control, and low social support) were associated with lower PGFW. Furthermore, personal goal facilitation through work explained significant additional variance (from 2 to 11%) in psychological distress (somatic complaints and emotional exhaustion) and job-related well-being (personal accomplishment, job satisfaction, and work engagement), controlling for demographic indicators and psychosocial job characteristics. Finally, the results provided support for the mediating effects of PGFW between all psychosocial job characteristics and all outcomes, except in the case of depersonalization. This study suggests that hindered personal goal facilitation may be a mechanism through which psychosocial job characteristics have a negative impact on employees' well-being.\n\nPersonality characteristics of Wikipedia members.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmichai-Hamburger, Yair; Lamdan, Naama; Madiel, Rinat; Hayat, Tsahi\n\n2008-12-01\n\nWikipedia is an online, free access, volunteer-contributed encyclopedia. This article focuses on the Wikipedians' (Wikipedia users) personality characteristics, studying Wikipedians' conceptions of Real-Me and BFI dimensions. To survey these aspects, we posted links to two online web questionnaires; one was targeted at Wikipedians and the second to non-Wikipedia users. One hundred and thirty-nine subjects participated in the study, of which 69 were active Wikipedia members. It was found that Wikipedia members locate their real me on the Internet more frequently as compared to non-Wikipedia members. Variance analysis revealed significant differences between Wikipedia members and non-Wikipedia members in agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness, which were lower for the Wikipedia members. An interaction was found between Wikipedia membership and gender: introverted women were more likely to be Wikipedia members as compared with extroverted women. The results of this study are discussed with special emphasis on the understanding of the motivators of Wikipedia members.\n\nThe Expected Personality Characteristics of Alcohol-Dependent Individuals.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMalouff, John M.; Schutte, Nicola S.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nUses the Big Five personality factors as a framework for examining the expected personality characteristics of individuals who are alcohol-dependent.

From August 2009 to April 2010, 231 patients (obtained 217 effective responses) with chronic cervicodynia and lumbodynia were recruited. Among the patients, there were 123 males and 94 females, with an average age of (38.00 +/- 5.67) years (ranged from 15 to 66 years). Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were used to test social support and psychological characteristic and compared the difference of psychological, personality traits and norm, then analyzed the effect of social support and personality traits on psychological characteristic. Two hundred and seventeen (93.9%) patients completed the questionnaire. Compared with normal 16PF scores, there were significant differences in factor scores of intelligence, stability, excitability, perseverance,social boldness, vigilance, sophistication, experimental, independence and tonicity (P < 0.01). And for SCL-90, the score of somatization, depression, anxiety, rivalrounsness, horror, bigotry, total score and mean score were higher than norm (P < 0.01). For SSRS, subjective support points and total points had positive effects; While intelligence, stability, perseverance, self-discipline had positive effects, vigilance and anxiety had negative effects. There were significant differences in personality traits and psychological characteristic between patients with chronic cervicodynia and lumbodynia and norms. Improving social support level and optimizing personality traits can improve psychological profile of these patients.\n\nReciprocal Influences of Personality and Job Characteristics Across Middle Adulthood\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSutin, Angelina R.; Costa, Paul T.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe present research uses an economically diverse, middle-aged sample to examine the concurrent and longitudinal interplay between personality and occupational experiences. Using the Five-Factor Model of personality and the Demand-Control Model of the occupational environment as guiding frameworks, participants (N = 722) reported on their personality, job characteristics, and occupational history; a subset (n = 297) made the same ratings approximately 10 years later. Measured concurrently, emotionally stable, extraverted, open, and conscientious participants reported jobs with greater decision-making latitude, whereas disagreeable participants had more physically demanding and dangerous jobs. Longitudinal cross-lagged analyses revealed that personality was associated with changes in decision latitude, hazardous working conditions, and physical demands. None of the job characteristics predicted change in personality at the factor level. Thus, personality shaped occupational experiences, but occupational experiences had minimal impact on personality. Support for the Five-Factor Theory perspective and implications for environmental approaches to personality development are discussed.

Understanding the personal characteristics of the participants is needed in order to encourage better participation. A survey was conducted among participants of telecentres situated in rural areas in the northern states of Malaysia. Results showed that whilst family size had a significant effect on the relationships between diffusion and adoption with value creation, other personal characteristics were found not to affect the relationships. The results have important implications to sustainability of the telecentre, in which focus should be placed in small-sized families rather than based on background and other demographic profile of participants.\n\nThe Association between Self-Defeating Personality Characteristics, Career Indecision, and Vocational Identity.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSweeney, Marie L.; Schill, Thomas R.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nOf 81 men and 69 women studied, those with more self-defeating personality (SDP) characteristics were more career indecisive and had less vocational identity.

This study tested a mediation model in which 3 forms of coping mediate the relation of 3 agentic personality characteristics (i.e., traits associated with the belief that people can effectively exercise control over their lives) to lower levels of anxiety within 1 subgroup of young adults (i.e., college students). The agentic personality characteristics were (a) hardiness, (b) personal growth initiative, and (c) coping self-efficacy. The forms of dispositional coping were (a) problem-focused, (b) emotion-focused, and (c) avoidant. Results suggest that agentic personality characteristics differentially relate to forms of coping and trait anxiety. In addition, coping appears to fully mediate the relations of the personality characteristics to anxiety. The results imply that agentic personality characteristics and coping are important in decreasing and/or protecting against anxiety, in part because of how they relate to forms of coping, and suggest the need for more research.

Grounded in recent research on personality development from a broad interactionist theoretical approach, the present article investigates whether work characteristics, including job demands, job control, social support from supervisors and coworkers, and organizational constraints, change proactive personality over time and, more important, reciprocal relationships between proactive personality and work characteristics. Latent change score analyses based on longitudinal data collected in 3 waves across 3 years show that job demands and job control have positive lagged effects on increases in proactive personality. In addition, proactive personality exerts beneficial lagged effects on increases in job demands, job control, and supervisory support, and on decreases in organizational constraints. Dynamic reciprocal relationships are observed between proactive personality with job demands and job control. The revealed corresponsive change relationships between proactive personality and work characteristics contribute to the proactive personality literature by illuminating more nuanced interplays between the agentic person and work characteristics, and also have important practical implications for organizations and employees.

As these tests comprise multiple risk analyses for multiple diseases, they may be difficult to evaluate. Insight into morally relevant differences between diseases will assist researchers, healthcare professionals, policy-makers and other stakeholders in the ethical evaluation of personal genome tests. In this paper, we identify and discuss four disease characteristics--severity, actionability, age of onset, and the somatic/psychiatric nature of disease--and show how these lead to specific ethical issues. By way of illustration, we apply this framework to genetic susceptibility testing for three diseases: type 2 diabetes, age-related macular degeneration and clinical depression. For these three diseases, we point out the ethical issues that are relevant to the question whether it is morally justifiable to offer genetic susceptibility testing to adults or to children or minors, and on what conditions. We conclude that the ethical evaluation of personal genome tests is challenging, for the ethical issues differ with the diseases tested for. An understanding of the ethical significance of disease characteristics will improve the ethical, legal and societal debate on personal genome testing.\n\nBulimia and Binge Eating in College Women: A Comparison of Personality and Behavioral Characteristics.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKatzman, Melanie A.; Wolchik, Sharlene A.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nAssessed several behavioral and personality characteristics that have been implicated in studying the onset of bulimia in female college students (N=80) classified into bulimia, binge eating, and control groups.

Discriminant analyses were employed to identify the personality and affective dimensions that maximally discriminate between 4 different levels of depressive severity. Differences between the 4 levels of depressive severity are suggestive of unique patterns of personality characteristics. Discriminant analysis showed that 74.8% of the cases were correctly classified by a single linear discriminant function, and that 61% of the variance in depression severity was accounted for by selected personality and affect variables. Results extend current conceptualizations of comorbidity and are discussed with respect to depression severity.\n\nMeasuring the Ways Significant Persons Influence Attitudes Towards Science and Mathematics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSjaastad, JÃ¸rgen\n\n2013-01-01\n\nYoung people's attitudes towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are subject to interpersonal influence of significant persons-defined as those who influence a person's attitudes. This article presents the development of an instrument designed to measure different modes of significant persons' influence on attitudes towards STEM. The questionnaire used in the pilot study was compiled based on Woelfel and Haller's theoretical perspectives on interpersonal influence, Nauta and Kokaly's instrument Influence of Others on Academic and Career Decisions Scale, and focus group interviews with Norwegian adolescents in an STEM mentoring programme. Drawing on Rasch analyses of data material from the 114 participants in the pilot study, the final instrument-Significant Person Influence on Attitudes towards STEM (SPIAS)-is presented. Based on results from the piloting and development of SPIAS, a conceptual discussion of significant persons and the ways they influence attitudes towards STEM is given, and it is suggested that SPIAS may be used in the process of evaluating and improving interventions aimed at changing adolescents' attitudes towards STEM.\n\nPilot evaluation of the Computer-Based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics test.\n\nPubMed\n\nShipper, Edward S; Mazer, Laura M; Merrell, Sylvia Bereknyei; Lin, Dana T; Lau, James N; Melcher, Marc L\n\n2017-07-01\n\nHigh attrition rates hint at deficiencies in the resident selection process. The evaluation of personal characteristics representative of success is difficult. Here, we evaluate a novel tool for assessing personal characteristics. To evaluate feasibility, we used an anonymous voluntary survey questionnaire offered to study participants before and after contact with the CASPer test. To evaluate the CASPer test as a predictor of success, we compared CASPer test assessments of personal characteristics versus traditional faculty assessment of personal characteristics with applicant rank list position. All applicants (nÂ =Â 77) attending an in-person interview for general surgery residency, and all faculty interviewers (nÂ =Â 34) who reviewed these applications were invited to participate. Among applicants, 84.4% of respondents (65 of 77) reported that a requirement to complete the CASPer test would have no bearing or would make them more likely to apply to the program (meanÂ =Â 3.30, standard deviationÂ =Â 0.96). Among the faculty, 62.5% respondents (10 of 16) reported that the same condition would have no bearing or would make applicants more likely to apply to the program (meanÂ =Â 3.19, standard deviationÂ =Â 1.33). The Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients for the relationships between traditional faculty assessment of personal characteristics and applicant rank list position, and novel CASPer assessment of personal characteristics and applicant rank list position, were -0.45 (PÂ =Â 0.033) and -0.41 (PÂ =Â 0.055), respectively. The CASPer test may be feasibly implemented as component of the resident selection process, with the potential to predict applicant rank list position and improve the general surgery resident selection process.

It was hypothesized that elements of the problem-orientation component would remain predictive of depressive behavior and distress after considering personality-disorder characteristics among 117 persons receiving inpatient-substance-abuse treatment. Furthermore, self-appraised problem-solving abilities were expected to predict the occurrence of \"dirty\" drug and alcohol screens during treatment and compliance with the first scheduled community follow-up visit. Results supported predictions concerning the relation of problem-solving confidence to depressive behavior, distress, and substance-use screens; however, a paradoxical relation was observed between the problem-orientation variables and compliance with the first outpatient visit. The results are interpreted within the context of contemporary models of social problem solving and the implications for cognitive-behavioral assessment and intervention are considered.\n\nTeachers' conceptions of learning and teaching in student-centred medical curricula: the impact of context and personal characteristics.\n\nPubMed\n\nJacobs, Johanna C G; van Luijk, Scheltus J; van der Vleuten, Cees P M; Kusurkar, Rashmi A; Croiset, Gerda; Scheele, Fedde\n\n2016-09-21\n\nGibbs and Coffey (2004) have reported that teaching practices are influenced by teachers' conceptions of learning and teaching. In our previous research we found significant differences between teachers' conceptions in two medical schools with student-centred education. Medical school was the most important predictor, next to discipline, gender and teaching experience. Our research questions for the current study are (1) which specific elements of medical school explain the effect of medical school on teachers' conceptions of learning and teaching? How? and (2) which contextual and personal characteristics are related to conceptions of learning and teaching? How? Individual interviews were conducted with 13 teachers of the undergraduate curricula in two medical schools. Previously their conceptions of learning and teaching were assessed with the COLT questionnaire. We investigated the meanings they attached to context and personal characteristics, in relation to their conceptions of learning and teaching. We used a template analysis. Large individual differences existed between teachers. Characteristics mentioned at the medical school and curriculum level were 'curriculum tradition', 'support by educational department' and 'management and finances'. Other contextual characteristics were 'leadership style' at all levels but especially of department chairs, 'affordances and support', 'support and relatedness', and 'students' characteristics'. Personal characteristics were 'agency', 'experience with PBL (as a student or a teacher)','personal development', 'motivation and work engagement'and 'high content expertise'. Several context and personal characteristics associated with teachers' conceptions were identified, enabling a broader view on faculty development with attention for these characteristics, next to teaching skills.\n\nActivity groups for persons with dementia: Personal predictors of participation, engagement and mood.\n\nPubMed\n\nCohen-Mansfield, Jiska\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThis study examined the relationship between personal characteristics and attendance, engagement, sleep, and mood outcomes of persons with dementia participating in group activities. The purpose of this study is to examine which persons with dementia benefit most from group interventions. Sixty-nine persons with dementia were observed by research and therapeutic recreation staff during 10 types of group activities (reading aloud with discussion, choral-singing, baking, creative storytelling, brain games, active games, exercise, reminiscence poetry, holiday newsletter, and holiday discussions) on multiple outcomes (attendance duration, sleep, engagement, active participation, attitude, and positive mood). Correlations between these outcomes and personal characteristics (demographics, functional and medical characteristics, personal preferences for group activities) were conducted. Variables with significant correlations were then entered into regression analyses. Many of the personal characteristics were significantly correlated with the outcomes. Cognitive function was the most consistent predictor of all outcomes. Personal characteristics, particularly cognitive function, can predict the responses of persons with dementia during group activities. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As these tests comprise multiple risk analyses for multiple diseases, they may be difficult to evaluate. Insight into morally relevant differences between diseases will assist researchers, healthcare professionals, policy-makers and other stakeholders in the ethical evaluation of personal genome tests. Discussion In this paper, we identify and discuss four disease characteristics - severity, actionability, age of onset, and the somatic/psychiatric nature of disease - and show how these lead to specific ethical issues. By way of illustration, we apply this framework to genetic susceptibility testing for three diseases: type 2 diabetes, age-related macular degeneration and clinical depression. For these three diseases, we point out the ethical issues that are relevant to the question whether it is morally justifiable to offer genetic susceptibility testing to adults or to children or minors, and on what conditions. Summary We conclude that the ethical evaluation of personal genome tests is challenging, for the ethical issues differ with the diseases tested for. An understanding of the ethical significance of disease characteristics will improve the ethical, legal and societal debate on personal genome testing.

Questions addressed include whether personality predicted final selection into the astronaut corps, whether women and men demonstrated typical gender differences in personality, and whether three characteristic clusters found in other high performance populations replicated in this group. Between 1989 and 1995, 259 final stage astronauts completed the Personal Characteristic Inventory (PCI) which assesses personality characteristics related to the broad traits of Instrumentality and Expressivity. In addition, 147 of these individuals also completed an abbreviated version of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) which assesses the \"Big Five\" traits of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, And Conscientiousness. Three previously identified trait clusters (Right, Wrong, and No Stuff) were found to replicate in this population. No differences were found on the PCI or on the modified NEO-FFI between applicants who were chosen to become astronauts (n = 63) and those who were not (n = 196). Men scored higher than women on competitiveness, but lower on expressivity and achievement strivings. These analyses suggest that the \"Right Stuff,\" \"Wrong Stuff\" and \"No Stuff\" clusters originally described in airline pilots and other high performance groups also exist within this population. Consistent with findings from other high performance populations, men and women tend to differ to a lesser extent than found in the general population, particularly on traits related to achievement motivation. Personality trait testing did not predict which applicants were most likely to be accepted into the astronaut corps.\n\nAn Empirical Study of the Personality Characteristics of Internet Sex Offenders\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTomak, Sheri; Weschler, Frederick S.; Ghahramanlou-Holloway, Marjan; Virden, Thomas; Nademin, Mahsaw Elicia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe present study evaluated the personality characteristics and psychopathology of internet sex offenders (ISOs) using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2) to determine whether ISO personality profiles are different to those of general sex offenders (GSOs; e.g. child molesters and rapists).

A number of theorists have speculated that this core illness may unilaterally disrupt normal personality functioning. However, recent data suggests that the relationship may be more complex and reciprocal than previously conceptualized. Furthermore, basic personality characteristics appear to be associated with numerous clinical phenomena. This article reviews the empirical literature pertaining to normal personality characteristics [structured around the five-factor model (FFM) of personality] in individuals with schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that certain personality characteristics may be uniquely related to the etiology of psychosis, as well as symptom severity, occupational functioning, cigarette smoking, substance use and violent behavior, social isolation, and suicidality in patients with schizophrenia. The implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n\nThe relationship between brain behavioral systems and the characteristics of the five factor model of personality with aggression among Iranian students.\n\nPubMed\n\nKomasi, Saeid; Saeidi, Mozhgan; Soroush, Ali; Zakiei, Ali\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAggression is one of the negative components of emotion and it is usually considered to be the outcome of the activity of the Behavioral Inhibition and the Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS): components which can be considered as predisposing factors for personality differences. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between brain behavioral systems and the characteristics of the five factor model of personality with aggression among students. The present study has a correlation descriptive design. The research population included all of the Razi University students in the academic year of 2012-2013. The sampling was carried out with a random stratified method and 360 people (308 female and 52 male) were studied according to a table of Morgan. The study instruments were Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire, NEO Personality Inventory (Short Form), and Carver and White scale for BAS/BIS. Finally, SPSS20 was utilized to analyze the data using Pearson correlation, regression analysis, and canonical correlation. The data showed a significant positive relationship between the neurosis and agreeableness personality factors with aggression; but there is a significant negative relationship between the extroversion, openness, and conscientiousness personality factors with aggression. Furthermore, there is a significant positive relationship between all the components of brain behavioral systems (impulsivity, novelty seeking, sensitivity, tender) and aggression. The results of regression analysis indicated the personality characteristics and the brain behavioral systems which can predict 29 percent of the changes to aggression, simultaneously. According to a predictable level of aggressiveness by the personality characteristics and brain behavioral systems, it is possible to identify the personality characteristics and template patterns of brain behavioral systems for the students which be presented to them as a necessary training in\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder and personality characteristics in older adults in the general Dutch population.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichielsen, Marieke; Comijs, Hannie C; Semeijn, Evert J; Beekman, Aartjan T F; Deeg, Dorly J H; Kooij, J J Sandra\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe authors wanted to examine the association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and personality characteristics and the potential mediating role of these characteristics in the relationship between ADHD and depression in older adults in the general Dutch population. Data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam in 2008/2009 were used in a cross-sectional design on 231 participants with and without ADHD aged 60-94 years. Questionnaires assessing self-esteem, self-efficacy, mastery, neuroticism, and social inadequacy were administered. ADHD was measured by means of ADHD diagnosis and level of ADHD symptoms. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between ADHD (symptoms) and personality characteristics. Single and multivariate mediation analyses were performed to examine the mediating role of personality characteristics in the relationship between ADHD (symptoms) and depressive symptoms. ADHD was significantly negatively associated with sense of mastery (BÂ =Â -2.44, tÂ =Â -3.14, dfÂ = 228, pÂ = 0.002), self-esteem (BÂ =Â -1.16, tÂ =Â -2.27, dfÂ =Â 228, pÂ = 0.02), and self-efficacy (BÂ =Â -2.33, tÂ =Â -2.02, dfÂ = 228, pÂ = 0.045) and positively associated with neuroticism (BÂ = 0.99, tÂ = 4.90, dfÂ = 228, pÂ <0.001) and social inadequacy (BÂ = 0.65, tÂ = 3.32, dfÂ = 229, pÂ = 0.001). In the single mediation analyses, all personality characteristics were mediators in the relationship between ADHD symptoms and depressive symptoms. In the multivariate analysis only mastery and self-esteem were mediators. Older adults with ADHD reported lower self-esteem and sense of mastery and higher levels of neuroticism and social inadequacy than older adults without ADHD. Mastery and self-esteem partly explained the association between ADHD and depressive symptoms in old age. The results implicate that in treatment clinicians should pay attention to the personality characteristics of older adults with ADHD.

It is not clear whether borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline personality related characteristics in a longitudinal cohort study of 1,116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline personality related characteristics measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline personality related characteristics at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesisâstress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology.

The participants, 32 individuals with PJ and 31 healthy volunteers completed measures of jealousy intensity, attachment type, love and relationship styles, personality, impulsivity, aggressiveness and social adjustment. Socio-demographic profiles were also obtained. Participants with PJ were significantly older than the control group, but no other important socio-demographic differences were observed. Participants with PJ were significantly more jealous and were predominately categorized with anxious-ambivalent attachment type, and Mania love style. They presented with elevated novelty seeking and harm avoidance, low self-directedness and cooperativeness, high levels of impulsivity and trait anxiety, and poor social adjustment. Multivariate analysis showed that jealousy intensity and trait anxiety were the variables that best distinguished participants with PJ from the control group. This study was limited by the cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size. PJ presents a particular pattern of attachment, love style, and personality structure, and deserves further attention as a specific potential disorder of the romantic bonding.

Personality pathology, symptom distress, treatment history, motivational factors, and sociodemographics were measured at intake in 923 patients, who subsequently enrolled in short-term or long-term outpatient, day hospital, or inpatient psychotherapy for personality pathology. Logistic regressions were used to examine the predictors of allocation decisions. We found a moderate relationship (R(2) = 0.36) between patient characteristics and treatment setting, and a weak relationship (R(2) = 0.18) between patient characteristics and treatment duration. The most prominent predictors for setting were: symptom distress, cluster C personality pathology, level of identity integration, treatment history, motivation, and parental responsibility. For duration the most prominent predictor was age. We conclude from this study that, in addition to pathology and motivation factors, sociodemographics and treatment history are related to treatment allocation in clinical practice.\n\nVocations as a source of identity: reciprocal relations between Big Five personality traits and RIASEC characteristics over 15 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nWille, Bart; De Fruyt, Filip\n\n2014-03-01\n\nAlthough work is a core part of life, the direction of influence from personality to work has typically been conceived as only unidirectional. The present study aims to contribute to the literature by considering reciprocal relations between personality and occupational characteristics, drawing on current perspectives from personality psychology (i.e., the social investment principle) and using a well-established framework to conceptualize career development (i.e., Holland's RIASEC theory). For this purpose, a longitudinal cohort of college alumni (N = 266) was tracked across a substantial and significant period in their professional career. Big Five personality traits and RIASEC occupational characteristics were assessed at the career start and 15 years later when their careers had unfolded. A combination of observed and latent variable analyses were used to disentangle the longitudinal and reciprocal relations between traits and occupational characteristics. Our results indicate that personality shapes and is shaped by our vocational experiences, suggesting that work can be a source of identity. The implications for theory and research on personality in the industrial and organizational literature are discussed alongside a number of practical implications for organizational and counseling settings.\n\nThe contribution of personal and exposure characteristics to the adjustment of adolescents following war.\n\nPubMed\n\nLavi, T; Green, O; Dekel, R\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe study examined the unique contribution of both personal characteristics and several types of exposure variables to the adjustment of Israeli adolescents following the Second Lebanon War. Two thousand three hundred and fourteen adolescents, who lived in areas that were the target of multiple missile attacks, completed self-report questionnaires assessing personal characteristics of gender and early traumatic events, subjective exposure (i.e., measures of fear and shortage of basic necessities during the war), objective exposure (i.e., exposure to missile attacks, knowing someone who was wounded or killed) and media exposure. Fifteen percent of the adolescents reported moderate or severe post-traumatic symptoms. Girls and adolescents who experienced earlier traumatic events were at higher risk for distress. While the level of direct exposure contributed to greater distress, the contribution of subjective exposure was significantly stronger. The discussion deals with the unique contribution of both subjective and objective characteristics to post-war adjustment.

After a review of the results from empirical studies, we discuss the ethical reasons which might explain-and justify-the views expressed in these studies. The paper develops a general framework based upon the causes of ill health and the consequences of treatment. It then turns to the question of the extent to which a personal characteristic-and the eventual underlying ethical justification of its relevance-could have any relationships to these causes and consequences. We attempt to disentangle those characteristics that may reflect a potentially relevant justification from those which violate widely accepted principles of social justice.\n\nCharacteristics of Persons Approving of Physician-Assisted Death\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBlevins, Dean; Preston, Thomas A.; Werth, James L., Jr.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe present study describes the characteristics and attitudes of non-terminally ill persons who support physician-assisted death (PAD) along with their expectations and preferences for care in the future.

To understand the personality trait characteristics and sexual functioning of nonpatient cross-dressers, 188 non-treatment-seeking male cross-dressers completed the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) and the Derogatis Sexual Functioning Inventory (DSFI). Respondents were classified as transvestites (TV; N = 83), transgenderists (TG; N = 61), or transsexuals (TS; N = 44) based on self-report and the nature of their cross-gender activities (e.g., use of female hormones, desire for sex reassignment, and amount of time spent in female role). These diagnostic groups did not differ on the five broad personality domains of the NEO-PI, but TS men scored higher than TV and TG men on the Aesthetics facet scale of Openness to Experience (O). In terms of the DSFI scales, TS men reported lower sexual drive than TV and TG men, and TS and TG men exhibited greater psychiatric symptoms and feminine gender role, and poorer body image than TV men. Upon exclusion of a group of 49 respondents who previously sought treatment for psychological problems, no significant differences emerged among the three diagnostic groups on the NEO-PI domain and facet scales. Consideration of the DSFI scales showed that TS men experienced less sexual drive, more psychiatric symptoms, and a greater feminine gender role than TV or TG men. This study suggests that cross-dressers not seen for clinical reasons are virtually indistinguishable from non-cross-dressing men using a measure of personality traits, a sexual functioning inventory, and measures of psychological distress. These results emphasize the importance of using clinical significance criteria as required by DSM-IV guidelines before diagnosing men who cross-dress with an axis I disorder.\n\nBig Five personality characteristics are associated with depression subtypes and symptom dimensions of depression in older adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoorevaar, A M L; Hegeman, J M; Lamers, F; Dhondt, A D F; van der Mast, R C; Stek, M L; Comijs, H C\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis study examined the associations of personality characteristics with both subtypes and symptom dimensions of depression in older adults.
