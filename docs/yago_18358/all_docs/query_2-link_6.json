        "text": "Joyce Cheng (鄭欣宜) will no longer be the spokeswoman for slimming and beauty institute Sau San Tong (修身堂), and some say her recent weight gain and arrogant attitude may be to blame.\n\nJoyce became Sau San Tong’s poster child of weight loss after dropping 93 pounds from her 235-pound frame. Her success gave hope to many local women, and brought business to Shirley Cheung’s (張玉珊) slimming company. With a healthier physique, Joyce was given many opportunities in the entertainment industry. Since her debut, she has released two music albums and participated in several dramas and films. She continued her weight loss effort despite a busy schedule, down to 128 pounds at her fittest.\n\nEven though things were going well for Joyce’s career, last year she officially announced her break up from boyfriend of 5 years, Mark Ryan. While filming this year’s Chinese New Year movie I Love Hong Kong 2013 <2013我愛HK 恭喜發財>, the press noticed that Joyce had gained a significant amount of weight. Most recently, reports claimed that Joyce has ballooned up to 180 pounds.\n\nSome speculate that her steady weight gain is damaging her relationship with Sau San Tong. At a recent grand opening event for Sau San Tong’s Shanghai flagship center, Anita Yuen (袁詠儀) appeared as the event’s special guest, but Joyce was nowhere to be seen. Sources claimed that Sau San Tong is hesitant to show off Joyce in public after an earlier embarrassment when an audience member loudly and publicly commented on Joyce’s weight.\n\nIn addition, there are rumors that Joyce has taken all the credit for her fitness success. The 26-year-old allegedly told others that Shirley Cheung had no hand in her weight loss journey, and that she had achieved the impressive results all on her own with dance exercises. Joyce’s attitude reportedly caused conflict with Shirley, who has decided not to renew the young star’s endorsement deal.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript\n\nWatch on\n\nReporters reached out to Shirley regarding Joyce’s spokeswoman status. When asked for reasons why Joyce was not invited to Sau San Tong’s Shanghai opening, Shirley replied, “Our contract has ended so we did not specifically reach out to her. She is not ready to lose weight again. She has been losing weight for a long time. I would not force her to continue if she doesn’t want to. She is a grown-up, it is honestly difficult for me to manage her. The most important thing is for her to be happy!”\n\nSource: Apple Daily"
