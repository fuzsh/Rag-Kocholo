        "text": "Joyce Cheng, born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, is a singer, actress and performer in Hong Kong. She is the daughter of the singer/actor Adam Cheng and the late TV host/comedian Lydia Shum from Hong Kong. Her parents got separated when she was eight months old and she was solely raised by her mother.\n\nCheng showed an immense interest in entertainment industry at a tender age, and she was frequently seen in the TV programmes where she sang child songs with her mum. At the age of 15, with the aid of her mother, she performed the song “Oops!… I Did It Again” by Britney Spears in a charity show, marking a milestone in her show-business life.\n\nHer mother Lydia Shum suffered from liver cancer in 2006. She dropped out of college and returned to Hong Kong to take care of her until her death in 2008. She then stayed in Hong Kong to develop her acting and singing career. She later starred in a heated TVB sitcom “Off Pedder” and she sang the ending theme song “No One is Perfect”, giving her a general acclaim from the Hong Kong public.\n\nThroughout her childhood, her weight and body shape were always the talk of the town among the Hong Kong society. She was seriously obese when she was young, and at the age of 15, she weighed 105kg. In 2003, she became the spokesperson for slimming company Sau San Tong Holdings Limited and embarked on her slimming journey.\n\nHer slimming journey was a massive success and her testimony initiated a craze for slimming among overweight kids and teenage girls in Hong Kong society. However, her weight increased gradually again when time went by and her weight reached 180 pounds in May, 2014. In June 2014, she posted a status on Facebook that as long as she is healthy, she will not take unnecessary outrageous slimming measures to lose weight.\n\nIn early 2015, she released a song “Are you thin enough?”, revealing the struggles throughout the slimming journey for her life so far, which is critically praised by the general public.\n\nRepresentative works:\n\n“Are you thin enough?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VQEy-qGf0Q\n\n“No One is Perfect” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lajkdos3Gs\n\n“Embracing Love” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtonhJFVvDM\n\nArticles:\n\nhttp://www.ettoday.net/news/20140627/372448.htm\n\nhttp://www.chinatimes.com/photo-app/20150609002041-260806"
