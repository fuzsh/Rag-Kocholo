        "text": "Early life\n\nCheng is the daughter of Hong Kong actor/singer Adam Cheng Siu-chow and comedian Lydia Sum Tin-ha. She has family roots in Taishan (Guangdong) and Shanghai. She is also the god-daughter of Alan Tang. During most of her childhood, she gained media exposure due to her mother. Cheng showed an interest in show business.

Later, Cheng remained in Hong Kong to pursue a music and acting career in Asia.\n\nCareer\n\nCheng has been the focus of a variety of media articles due to her struggles with her weight. At a young age, she was 226.5 lbs. Determined to overcome her weight issues, Cheng started a strict fitness regimen at the age of 16. Her fitness program was recorded in her book, My Weight Loss Diary.\n\nIn 2005, Cheng played the part of Snow White in the Hong Kong Disneyland opening ceremony.\n\nCheng's first music video, 靠自己, \"Kaau Zi Gei\" (literally Depend on Myself) aired on the TVB prime time show Scoop in 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Cheng performed in the Tung Wah charity fundraising telethon, raising HK$310,000, which included a special HK$10,000 from her mother, Lydia Shum.\n\nIn February 2007, Cheng performed in the Chinese opera, The Grand Stage.\n\nCheng recorded and showcased her music video, Connected Hearts on an October 2007 episode of the popular Hong Kong television show, Enjoy Yourself Tonight.\n\nCheng released her debut album on 6 January 2011.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, together with Sam Sullivan, mayor of the City of Vancouver, agreed to proclaim the following 1 June (her mother's Chinese birthday) to be \"Fei Fei Day\".\n\nOn 10 May 2008, Joyce performed a part originally played by her mother, in a performance from Lai Fa Palace during the 2008 Po Leung Kuk Charity Gala.

She said that she had just experienced her first Mothers Day without her own mother, but she knows that wherever her mother is, she will still be supporting her. She felt that in the same way, this young mother will still be supporting her child because the love of motherhood is great until the end. She hopes that the orphans will remember this and grow up as happy person.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, Joyce took part in a live radio show with fellow Hong Kong artiste Hins Cheung (張敬軒).
