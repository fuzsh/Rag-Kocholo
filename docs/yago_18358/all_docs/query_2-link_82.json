Therefore, I conducted a method of bilingual research by looking at materials from both English and Chinese sources. Accordingly, a translation was needed for the Chinese-language materials, either written (such as posters, magazine interviews and film reviews) or multimedia (such as film footage and songs). In this book, all films are referred to by their English title. The Chinese terms and phrases discussed in the book are also listed in the English–Chinese Glossary with a clear explanation of the original language. Unless otherwise specified, all Chinese-to-English translations are my own. Another aspect of the translation is the romanisation of Chinese names. This book primarily adopts the pinyin system, which is the standard transliteration based on Mandarin pronunciation. However, this standard is not imposed on all the characters mentioned in this book, due to the different transliteration systems used in places like Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some other overseas Chinese communities (in which the romanisation of a name either follows the Wade–Giles system or is based on the Cantonese pronunciation). In such cases, the romanisation of many Hong Kong and Taiwan names retain their original or most popular spelling (such as ‘Chow Yun-fat’ rather than ‘Zhou Runfa’) in order to minimise confusion. In terms of the textual presentation of Chinese names, this book follows the Chinese tradition by displaying surnames first and given names last. In cases where an individual chooses to adopt a name in English or other Western language, the spelling follows Western convention, i.e. given name first and surname at the end (such as ‘Andy Lau’, not ‘Lau Tak-wah’). In alphabetical listings, the family name appears before the given name, separated by a comma according to Western convention. Finally, two more considerations regarding nomenclature need to be addressed. First, there are cases where two characters are generally known by Not for distribution or resale.

For instance, there are two men called Tony Leung in the Hong Kong film industry, and both are well-known male stars of around the same age. Secondly, there is the issue of a person choosing to give the reader both his or her English and Chinese given names. In such cases, the name is presented in the order of English given name, Chinese surname and then Chinese given name (such as Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Tony Leung Ka-fai and Lawrence Ng Wai-kwok).\n\nNot for distribution or resale.

From the newspapers, magazines and tabloids to the multimedia vehicles of film, television and the Internet, stars not only help to promote products and services, but also, as Christine Gledhill (1991: xiii) pointed out, signify various social and cultural values and personal desires. Since the mid-1980s, an increasing number of Hong Kong actors have entered the global film market and have transformed themselves from regional celebrities to transnational stars. Perhaps as a result of the success of Hong Kong action cinema in the global commercial film market, the majority of Hong Kong stars, such as Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Michelle Yeoh, who have made their way into Hollywood and other major film markets outside East Asia, are those whose performances and images rely heavily on their control of their bodies and on their mastery of physical skills. However, although these Hong Kong stars’ screen images as action heroes or martial artists have helped to (re)define the Chinese image created by early Hollywood and even to impel the evolvement of the cinematic representation of Chinese people beyond East Asia in recent years, the prevalence of on-screen Chinese action heroes and martial artists has also established a new stereotypical image of Chinese men and women as constantly performing kicks, punches, jumps, spins and other spectacular action stunts. This in turn narrows the general public’s perception of Chinese (including Hong Kong) stardom in the global film market, as well as limiting job opportunities for Chinese actors outside East Asia. In response to these observations, this book investigates the construction and circulation of Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat’s star image across various entertainment industries and cultural markets. As with the aforementioned stars, Chow captured Hollywood’s attention through his performances in action films. However, he is also known in Asia as a versatile actor who has Not for distribution or resale.

This raises a question concerning the way in which stardom permeates across various cultural borders. By following Chow’s career path, this book examines how the different territories of Chow’s star image are selected by the mass media as a way of articulating the social perceptions of Hong Kong’s cultural identity in its specific historical, social and cultural contexts in relation to the discourse of gender, race, age, social mobility and political diversity. By using the term ‘territories’, I refer not only to the different aspects or layers of Chow’s star persona, but also to the specific industry and market conditions that have shaped his star image. As the book illustrates, star image shifts across various historical, geographic and cultural borders. In order to cater for, and sometimes to shape, the public’s taste and expectations, different media highlight certain dimensions of star image, while at the same time downplaying or even neglecting others. As a result, the star image we encounter is always temporary, fragmented and partially presented. An emphasis on the territories of stardom, however, does not imply treating different aspects of Chow’s star image as unrelated pieces separated by various borders; by contrast, it stresses the complex interfaces across boundaries. As such, this book argues that an understanding of star image should always be intertextual and multidimensional. Yvonne Tasker (1995: 76) argued that ‘the territory of the star image is also the territory of identity’. It is important to note that the film industry and its market conditions are determined by their own specific social and cultural locations of the time. In light of Tasker’s observation, this book’s discussion of the plural territories of Chow’s star image not only suggests the hybridity of Chow’s star image, but also reveals the tension among the different social forces that shape the public’s perception of Chow’s popularity in various cultural spaces, both within and beyond Hong Kong’s regional borders. Following the trajectory of Chow’s career moves, this book engages with the debates on glocalisation - the complex interaction between global and local – and aims to investigate the precise role of a star in modern global cultural industries.\n\nW hy C ho w Y un -f a t ? A S h o r t B iog r a p h y IN Co nt e x t Born in 1955 on Lamma Island, Hong Kong, Chow was the youngest son of a working-class family. After dropping out of school at the age of seventeen, Chow had worked in a variety of odd jobs, including as a hotel bellboy, a shop assistant and a postman. In 1973, he was recruited for an acting course organised by Television Broadcast Ltd (hereafter referred to as TVB). After fi ­ nishing his Not for distribution or resale.

The instant success of the film made Chow one of the most popular stars in Hong Kong in the subsequent decade. During this period of his Hong Kong career, Chow starred in over seventy films. Chow’s performance not only generated a huge profit for the studios, but also earned him numerous awards, including two Best Actor awards from the Asia-Pacific Film Festival and Golden Horse Awards for his role as Yip Kim-fay in Hong Kong 1941 (1984), an additional Best Actor award from Golden Horse Awards for his portrayal of Boat-head in An Autumn’s Tale (1987), and three Best Actor awards from the Hong Kong Film Awards for his performances in A Better Tomorrow, City on Fire (1987) and All about Ah-Long (1989) in 1987, 1988 and 1990, respectively. To understand Chow’s career success in Hong Kong, we need to consider the social changes that occurred in the city. During the early history of the Hong Kong film industry, many filmmakers and stars were migrants from mainland China. However, the border between Hong Kong and mainland China was closed in the early 1950s and the travelling to Hong Kong from the north became more difficult.1 The stringent border control saw gradually widening differences between mainland Chinese and Hong Kong societies during the next three decades in terms of their political systems, taste in cultural products, economic infrastructure and many other aspects. In mainland China, the Communist Party emphasised a centralised government and encouraged personal worship of the party’s paramount leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, from the 1950s to the 1970s. The national chaos caused by a number of political movements instituted by the party, such as the Anti-rightist Movement (1957– 9), The Great Leap Forward (1958–61), the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), and the Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement (1968– 78), not only damaged the country’s economy severely, but also disrupted the education system in mainland China during this period. In the meantime, in Hong Kong, the non-interventionist policy promoted by Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary at the time, Sir John James Cowperthwaite, saw the rapid growth of the city’s economy, which gradually transformed Hong Kong into one of the four ‘Asian Tigers’, together with Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.2 In 1971, the Hong Kong government introduced six years’ free compulsory education, and this was expanded to nine years in 1978. The booming economy and improved educational infrastructure saw an expanding middle-class society characterised by an increasing number of locally born Hong Kongers moving up the social ladder since the 1970s. Given this social context, local citizens started to question their ­self-identity as Hong Kongers. As such, a divergence between mainland Chinese and Hong Kong cinema emerged. Unlike mainland Chinese cinema, in which propaganda promoting Not for distribution or resale.

Although Hong Kong’s colonial government also adopted censorship to control criticism of the government,3 it did not interfere overly in other aspects of filmmaking and narrative morality, such as choices of genre, dress codes and make-up, and jokes about religion, gender, race, disability and so on. As aresult of the relatively relaxed censorship, Hong Kong cinema not only had the freedom to adapt traditional Chinese folk stories, theatre dramas, and classic and popular literature for its big screens, but could also borrow ideas vigorously from other screen cultures, such as those of Japan and Hollywood. However, simply borrowing stories or ideas from elsewhere could not satisfy the growing demands of Hong Kong audiences. The rapid urbanisation and industrialisation of Hong Kong in the 1960s and the 1970s urged local entertainment industries to produce cultural products, such as films, TV programmes and music, specifically telling local stories and addressing local social concerns. Along with the colonial government’s further loosening of control over film content since the 1970s, Hong Kong cinema gained more creative freedom (Liang 1992: 63). It is in this context that a new generation of filmmakers was coming of age. The presence of those locally born and locally educated talents brought ‘an all-new façade’ to local (Cantonese) cinema by following the track of modernisation while remaining sensitive to local and regional ­differences, as Hong Kong film critic Sek Kei (1999a: 54–5) pointed out. It was during such a period that Chow began his career as an actor and gradually attained his stardom in Hong Kong. One may note that many Hong Kong actors, such as Andy Lau, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Stephen Chow and Maggie Cheung, took a similar career path to Chow, starting their careers and achieving initial fame via the local TV industry before moving to the big screen. Chow was at the forefront of this trend, and can thus be identified as an ideal candidate for studying the system of stardom in Hong Kong. In this regard, the diversity of Chow’s star personae and his career moves across different industries enable this book to examine Hong Kong’s shifting cultural landscape. In addition, Chow’s career move from Hong Kong to Hollywood and then back to Chinese cinema provides an exceptional case to investigate a Hong Kong star’s role in mediating different social, political and cultural discourses in relation to Hong Kong’s relationship with China. The boom in the local film industry made Hong Kong one of the most important cities for film production in East Asia during the 1980s and early 1990s, and this resulted in the introduction of many local stars, including Chow, to the global film market. However, after more than a decade of prosperity, Hong Kong cinema went into a long period of recession. Annual film production in Hong Kong dropped by nearly 40 per cent, from 242 films in 1993 to 150 in 2000, and its revenue was almost Not for distribution or resale.

Chow, despite his commercial and critical success in local cinema, was not immune to the crisis in the Hong Kong film industry. As cited in Yang (1995: 26) he criticised the deteriorated condition of the Hong Kong film industry and market, which became flooded with low-quality films that were distinctive only in their derivativeness, inattention to original storytelling, and general lack of creativity. As a result, Chow appeared in significantly fewer films in the first half of the 1990s than he did in the second half of the 1980s.4 Many factors contributed to Chow’s popularity in local cinema (especially in action cinema), as well as to the rise and decline of the Hong Kong film industry during the 1980s and 1990s. One of the most popular explanations refers to the city’s uncertain political prospects for 1997, or what Stephen Teo (1997: 207) called the ‘China syndrome’. As Chris Berry and Mary Farquhar (2006: 158) noted, the star personae of many Hong Kong stars, such as Jackie Chan, Ti Lung, Danny Lee and Jet Li are often related to their screen images as national heroes or upright police officers who either fight for national pride or defend social justice. In comparison, many of Chow’s acclaimed screen roles frequently step across the boundary of legal society and the illegal underworld, such as his roles as Mark Gor in A Better Tomorrow (1986), Chung Tin-ching in Prison on Fire (1987), Joe in Once a Thief (1991), and Ah Jong in The Killer (1989). Julian Stringer (2004: 450) argued that the instability of Chow’s star image between being in and out of control helps us understand the narratives in A Better Tomorrow and The Killer as positioned within a historical situation identified in terms of the social mechanisms of paternity and survival. Similarly, Jillian Sandell (2001: n.p.) argued that male heroes in John Woo’s action films, particularly those played by Chow, ‘locate the fear, uncertainty, and moral confusion about Hong Kong’s future’. In these scholars’ readings of Hong Kong action cinema, Chow and his screen heroes represent Hong Kong’s rampant social anxieties created in the popular imagination by the city’s reunification with China in 1997. In a similar vein, some film scholars have deemed the social fears concerning Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule to have contributed to the growth of Hong Kong’s emigrant population, an issue closely related to the Hong Kong film industry’s crisis because of the reduction of the number of film industry professionals, investors and local filmgoers. From the film production perspective, Liang Liang (1992: 62–65) argued that investors were seeking quick returns on their capital investment before 1997; as a result, many studios and filmmakers ceased to make long-term schedules for filmmaking. In this regard, Chow’s comment on the market condition of Hong Kong cinema, as mentioned earlier, suggested that the star sensed a career crisis as a result of being a professional actor under the reductive way of filmmaking in Hong Kong. It was under these circumstances that Chow decided to relocate his career to Hollywood in 1995. Not for distribution or resale.

However, focusing primarily on the negative side of the crisis, namely the danger and threat associated with the approach of 1997, the interpretation of Chow’s star image as a man in crisis is only one side of the coin. In the Chinese language the word ‘crisis’ combines two characters, wei and ji. Whereas the former part of the word means danger and threat, the latter part refers to chance and opportunity. As Ronald Skeldon (1994: 37) argued, although emigration from Hong Kong at the time was high, the feeling of panic determining people’s desire to leave the city at any cost by seeking foreign passports was not widespread prior to 1997. Decisions concerning applications for emigration were, by contrast, often made after careful calculation and pragmatic consideration of such factors as social welfare, the education system and business opportunities. In addition, the deregulation of immigration since the 1980s by several Western countries has encouraged Hong Kong citizens’ global mobility by making it much easier for Hong Kongers moving abroad to seek new opportunities, as the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong at the time, David Robert Ford (cited in Ming Pao Weekly 1987: 87) noted.5 While I agree that wei played an important part in shaping a sense of self and local identity in Hong Kong’s citizens at the time, my study of Chow’s stardom beyond action cinema also suggests that ji is equally important to an understanding of Chow’s popularity in Hong Kong, as well as an understanding of the complex relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China prior to 1997 – a point I will discuss in various chapters in the first half of the book. As a result of the more favourable conditions resulting from the simplified immigration and international travelling procedures granted by these host countries, the emigration exodus that took place from Hong Kong during the late 1980s and 1990s was very much, as Skeldon (1994: 48) argued, ‘part of a regional system of migration, with Chinese peoples throughout that region responding in similar ways to global economic conditions’. Skeldon’s observations could be demonstrated by the situation in the contemporary Chineselanguage film industries (including those in Hong Kong). While the prosperity of Hong Kong’s commercial cinema during the 1980s gradually gained the attention of Hollywood, the emergence of the so-called ‘fifth-generation’ filmmakers also saw mainland Chinese films re-entering international film distribution after nearly two decades of absence from the global film market following the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960s.6 The rise of both Hong Kong’s commercial cinema and the fifth-generation filmmakers in mainland China not only prompted widespread interest in Chinese-language films, but also initiated an increasing amount of contact between filmmakers working within and beyond Chinese-language film industries.

In addition to Hong Kong stars like Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Sammo Hung and Chow, the list of emigrating Chinese filmmakers and actors also includes mainland director Chen Kaige, director and cinematographer Gu Changwei, and actors Joan Chen, Vivian Wu, Zhang Yu, Cong Shan, Zhang Tielin, Wang Ji and many more. Although few actors from mainland China have succeeded in building their stardom in the global film industry as some Hong Kong stars have managed to do, their emigration demonstrates that the outflow of film talent did not take place in Hong Kong alone. As Chu Yiu-wai (2004a: 46) pointed out, the ‘Hong Kong film industry has been long in pursuit of the Hollywood dream’. In an interview, Chow (cited in Yang 1995: 26) similarly stated that his intention in going to Hollywood was ‘to learn . . . to learn the language . . . and . . . to know local producers and production modes’. By describing working in Hollywood as an opportunity to learn new skills and to extend his professional network, Chow demonstrated how his emigration could be seen as revealing similar motivations to the mainland Chinese filmmakers and actors mentioned above. In considering his career prospects and personal development as a film professional, Chow’s decision to move from Asia to America was thus made because of his intention to seek new career opportunities on the global stage, rather than purely because of the fear of political and social uncertainty. It is important to note here that Chow did not experience any acclimation period before he was cast as a leading man in a Hollywood production. Unlike Jackie Chan, who re-entered the American mass market through his dubbed Hong Kong-produced Rumble in the Bronx (1995),7 or Jet Li who played a supporting role as the villain Wah Sing Ku in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) before becoming a leading man in Hollywood cinema, Chow bypassed these processes. In fact, although Chow’s Hong Kong films were circulated in Chinatown’s video shops, his star presence was somewhat limited to the cult circle in the American market before the mid-1990s. As possibly the first Hong Kong star to be introduced directly to the American public as a Chinese leading man by Hollywood (without any of his old films being released in American mainstream theatres, or himself appearing in a supporting role in a Hollywood film), Chow’s career transition across the Pacific thus also provides a ­compelling case for studying transnational Chinese stardom. In the meantime, filmmakers and actors from three Chinese-language film industries (those of mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong) have increasingly worked together to produce huayu dapian (Chinese-language blockbusters), which subsequently saw the formation of what has become known as huayu dianying (Chinese-language cinema) – a concept that has been adopted Not for distribution or resale.

As Sek (1999a: 54) noted, the combination of Chinese cultural traditions and Western influences imported during its rapid modernisation since the 1970s made Hong Kong the richest and most dynamic production centre of Chinese cinema. However, this unique feature of Hong Kong cinema started to fade when the industry was confronted by the rise of mainland Chinese cinema beginning in the late 1980s and China’s increasing interaction with the rest of the world. In this context, the Hong Kong film industry needed to rethink its production practices and to seek different solutions for improving the quality of locally made films and regenerating local film businesses when faced with confronting both the powerful Hollywood industry and the ­increasingly ambitious mainland Chinese cinema industry. As the (mainland) Chinese film market has continued to grow strongly, many of the émigré filmmakers and stars, including John Woo, Hark Tsui, Terence Chang, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Sammo Hung and Chow, have gradually returned to the Chinese-language film industry since 2000. Although, strictly speaking, Chow has starred in only a limited number of Hollywood films up to the present day, he managed to become probably ‘the first Asian film star to play a complex, romantic leading man in a serious, big-budget Hollywood movie’, as Dorinda Elliott (1999: n.p.) pointed out. Elliott’s observation is important, as she not only noted the dilemma that Asian stars face throughout the entire Hollywood film history, but also pointed out the significance of Chow’s casting in Anna and the King (1999). Although the film remains to this day the only Hollywood production to cast Chow as a romantic lead, Chow’s experience was highly valued by the Chinese-language cinema, which clearly has a vision of entering the global commercial film market. Placed within this larger context, Chow’s post-1997 career not only illustrates how a Hong Kong star has become an agent for mediating social perceptions of Asian men’s cultural identities in America’s film industry, but also maps the emergence of transnational Chinese-language cinema in terms of the star presence – a point I will discuss in detail in the second half of the book.\n\nU nd e r s ta n d i n g t h e S t a r I ma g e: Pr efig u r a t iv e M a t e r i a l s , S o c i a l Co n t e x t a n d In t er t ex t u a l Ana l y s i s The significance of the study of stardom as an academic discipline is not limited to merely understanding an individual star’s career achievement or revealing the ‘secret’ of a star’s private life, in the way that biography does. Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nin troduction 9 Instead, star studies aims to explore the social and cultural implications articulated through public discourse about a star. The cross-disciplinary value of the study of stardom is well reflected in Christine Gledhill’s observations: The star challenges analysis in the way it crosses disciplinary boundaries: a product of mass culture, but retaining theatrical concerns with acting, performance and art; an industrial marketing device, but a signifying element in films; a social sign, carrying cultural meanings and ideological values, which expresses the intimacies of individual personality, inviting desire and identification; an emblem of national celebrity, founded on the body, fashion and personal style; a product of capitalism and the ideology of individualism, yet a site of contest by marginalised groups; a figure consumed for his or her personal life, who competes for allegiance with statesmen and politicians. (1991: viii) It is according to this understanding that stars and their public images are identified as a valuable conduit through which a wide range of social and cultural values become interconnected. Similarly, rather than seeing star image as coherent and singular, Andy Willis (2004a: 1–2) pointed out that a star’s public images vary across different media texts in their specific social contexts, and that a star’s plural and even contradictory images offer the film studios a vital ground through which different tastes in the film market are mediated. In line with Gledhill’s and Willis’ observations, this book pays particular attention to the construction and circulation of Chow’s star image in what Martin Barker (2006: n.p.) terms ‘prefigurative materials’ (also variously termed secondary, ancillary or satellite texts), such as press releases, posters, trailers, ‘The making of . . .’ programmes, critics’ columns and reviews, Internet forums and even rumours. The construction of a star’s image is derived not only from the films in which he or she appears, but also from other media texts that can either be under, or beyond, their control. An acknowledgement of the importance of these prefigurative texts thus reminds us that these texts may not fit easily with critical approaches that focus on serious critical reviews or primarily text-interpretative approaches to film content. In his article about the promotion, exhibition and distribution of films, Barker (2006: n.p.) argued that extra-cinematic media texts, while appearing in the form of an accompaniment and a discursive address to a film, ‘guide and help construct the manner we attend to, and indeed often concentrate on, the films we watch’. By helping to build and connect these interests before, during, and even after the film is released at cinemas, prefigurative texts mediate distribution practices as well as film interpretation. Although Barker’s study is concerned with film distribution, his definition of prefigurative materials is useful for the examination of star image. This is Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n10 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom not only because stars often occupy a remarkable position within these prefigurative texts, but also because such media texts build a bridge between the production and consumption of star images in specific market sections. By guiding public attention to certain aspects of a star’s image or lifestyle, the prefigurative materials reflect, promote or, in some cases, denigrate particular social types. While the different cultural messages focused on in the prefigurative materials exhibit the hybrid nature of a star image, they also construct the star as a confluent site at which various perceptions and social values can interact. Thus, these media texts should not be seen as secondary or ancillary to, or as satellites of film texts or audience responses in the way that many representation and reception studies do. Instead, I argue that these media texts are essential to our understanding of the articulation of star image and its various social identifications within specific historical and cultural contexts. The scope of prefigurative materials is wide, and the materials analysed in this book can be divided roughly into four categories, although some of these prefigurative texts could be included in different groups or transmit their message from one group to another. The first category is that of industryproduced promotion materials: including posters, trailers, ‘the making of . . .’ programmes, press conferences, the film’s official website and so on. As a type of text directly related to the star’s appearance in the films, the promotional materials are probably ‘the most straightforward of all the texts which construct a star image, in that [they are] the most deliberate, direct, intentioned and self-conscious’ (Dyer 1998: 60). In order to target the right market section and to maximise the audience’s interests in a film, the marketing department of a film studio often conducts extensive market research, for example by holding interviews with selected audiences and focus groups, before the release of the film. As Andy Willis (2004b: 178) argued, a film’s marketing and promotional materials often demand ‘a certain level of mutual knowledge on behalf of the filmmakers and their audience’. Since audiences’ expectations and viewing practices vary in different contexts, marketing experts are well aware that they need to select and highlight different features of star image to cater for different tastes across the different film markets. Therefore, these promotional materials are useful for disclosing the dialogue between the production and consumption of a star’s image in specific film markets. Thus, this book pays particular attention to the sources of these types of prefigurative materials, all of which are targeted at or circulated in a specific market. The second category of prefigurative materials relates to a star’s appearances and performances beyond cinema. In Chow’s case, this includes commercial advertisements, music albums and TV dramas. As I will explore throughout this book, Hong Kong stars rarely restrict their performances to cinema alone, and their career development and management is frequently enacted across media industries. Although these types of materials are perhaps the most Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nin troduction 11 neglected texts in the study of film stardom, I argue that such extra-cinematic appearances play a vital role in shaping the star’s public image. Not only does the distribution of such material reveal the development of the stars throughout their careers, but it also helps to uncover different dimensions of the stars’ public image, which may or may not be consistent with their screen images as created by the film industry. Therefore, this type of material helps to shape and reshape the public’s perception of star image through ­reinforcement, ­contestation and contradiction. The third category of prefigurative materials is media publicity. Rather than appearing as a promotional tool, this type of prefigurative material reaches the public in the forms of news reports, ‘leaked’ information, tabloid photographs, rumours and even scandals. As both Paul McDonald (2000: 5) and P. David Marshall (2006a:5) noted, studios often assign a unit publicist to create and manage the publicity surrounding an individual production; and during the period leading up to the release of a film, the publicity department prepares stories about the production and its stars, which are then positioned by ‘planters’ in the trade and news media to maximise exposure. Although distinct from a film’s promotional materials, this strand of media publicity has a similar function to that of the first category of prefigurative materials mentioned earlier: Both types of extra-cinematic promotion to the public are heavily manipulated by the industry. However, this type of media publicity is conducted by channels operating independently of the star or film studios. Thus it serves to provoke debate regarding the star’s public and private images, which is crucial to the star’s fame and popularity. The last category of prefigurative materials analysed in this book is the film reviews, written either by professional film critics or by Chow’s fans during the period with which I am concerned. Although this type of material has conventionally been categorised as a reception text, it also constitutes, as Barker (2006: n.p.) argued, a ‘more or less patterned discursive preparation for the act of viewing’, which reveals the reviewer’s personal tastes and interests concerning a certain topic. Since film reviews always rely on information from other media, such as a reviewer’s knowledge of the star, genre and even the development of film technology, these texts offer valuable feedback concerning how an individual viewer interprets a star’s performance in a film, in association with his or her own engagement within particular social and cultural contexts. Despite the different producers, media channels, functions, and formats of these prefigurative materials, the texts analysed in this book share some common features. One such common feature is the mass distribution enacted in the public domain. As Chris Rojeck (2001: 13) argued, the representations of the mass media are crucial to the formation of celebrity culture, and a star’s presence in the public eye is essential to his or her status. The circulation of these prefigurative materials thus encourages public participation in the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n12 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom exchange of ideas and experiences in this process whereby audiences access and engage with a star’s image. The distribution of these prefigurative materials is not infinite or aimless. Instead, the production and circulation of these texts are confined to a specific market, society or community. In other words, prefigurative materials are subject to their own social, cultural and historical contexts. This leads to another feature of prefigurative materials: that of their strong performativeness. As detailed earlier, the content and delivery of many prefigurative materials are not random. They intend to raise the public’s interest by catering for, confirming, disavowing or providing alternative options to existing ideas and perceptions about the star in a specific market. Therefore, the content of prefigurative materials is well planned and manipulated in accordance with the interests of particular readers or audiences. The performative features of prefigurative texts suggest that the presentation and discussion of star image in these prefigurative materials is highly selective and fragmented. To some degree, this confirms Dyer’s observation that a star’s image is a structure of social and cultural polysemy, and is open to contradiction (1998: 2–3). It is important to note here that, although these prefigurative materials exist as different forms of media texts, they are also intertextually connected. This is not only because their meanings are mutually determined but also, as Sean Redmond and Su Holmes (2007a: 6) pointed out, because together they reveal that star image cannot be restricted to a single form of media. As both Frances Bonner (2005: 59) and P. David Marshall (2006b: 179) argued, media texts are not merely created as isolated, finished products for consumers, but are constructed as a direct response to consumers’ tastes and experiences within a historically and culturally specific context. Therefore, the critical interaction between different media texts and the intertextual analysis thereof helps to reveal the complexity of social meanings and values associated with the star image of an actor like Chow. By rejecting the rigid division between representation and reception in studies of stardom, this intertextual approach encourages the consideration of how the public encounters the star image through different forms of media contact. This approach thus places the investigation of Chow’s star image within academic studies of contemporary celebrity culture, which is defined by Jessica Evans (2005: 1), Su Holmes and Sean Redmond (2010: 5) and Graeme Turner (2004: 26) as a multimedia and multi-textual phenomenon. In order to relocate the media construction of Chow’s star image in its specific social, cultural and historical context, many prefigurative materials analysed in this book are drawn from the same historical period as the production and release of Chow’s screen works. This means that Chow’s screen works and acting career constitute a reference point from which different prefigurative materials communicate with each other. By so doing, this book recognises that the encounter Not for distribution or resale.

Such territorially defined star images cannot be understood without considering their specific social and cultural contexts. In order to delineate a clear picture of the context in which Chow’s star image is constructed, this book is organised in chronological order. It is roughly divided into two parts, each part containing four chapters. Part I examines Chow’s star images across different media forms and entertainment industries in connection with the formation of Hong Kong’s urban culture since the 1970s. I argue that the transformation of Chow from an ordinary young man to a new local icon is deeply imbedded in Hong Kong citizens’ growing awareness of being Hong Kongers. The cross-media construction of Chow’s star image as a local icon conveys the complexity of social mobility in Hong Kong during the period, in which the city experienced a rapid change in its politics, economy and culture. Chapter 1 examines Chow’s TV stardom during the 1970s and early 1980s. This chapter discusses Chow’s early TV persona as a modern xiaosheng (a type of young male character developed from traditional Chinese literature and theatre). I argue that the medium of TV played a significant role in contributing to Chow’s popularity in Hong Kong and to shaping audiences’ readings of Chow’s Hong Kong film stardom. Chapter 2 maps out the transition of Chow’s public image from a TV star to a film actor during the early 1980s. This chapter makes a strong case for a connection between Chow’s star image as a film actor and the shifting culture and aesthetics of Hong Kong’s Cantonese cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This chapter recognises that an actor’s professional reputation is located in a specific cinematic vogue within Hong Kong’s film industry and market, and that the transformation of Chow’s status from a TV star to a film actor offers a new perspective for investigating the shifting landscape of Hong Kong (Cantonese) cinema in relation to the social changes taking place in Hong Kong during the period in question. Chapter 3 tackles two key issues that have been overlooked in both star studies and film studies, namely a male film star’s image as a fashion and lifestyle icon, and the social implications of star endorsement beyond Western consumer culture. This chapter argues that the interaction between Chow’s on-screen images and his presence in consumer commercials creates a specific Not for distribution or resale.

The fourth chapter focuses on the crossmedia construction of Chow’s star image as a comedic actor in relation to the discussion of Hong Kong’s metropolitan history. This chapter explores the ways in which Chow’s comedic images updated Hong Kong comedies fundamentally by replacing an account of modernity based on technological mastery with one of spatial mastery. The second half of the book focuses on Chow’s star presence in American and transnational film markets, questioning an Asian star’s encounter with cultural barriers in global star promotion, as well as proposing an original investigation of a Hong Kong star’s negotiation of Chinese racial and politic identification in the global and local film markets. Chapter 5 investigates Chow’s career move from Hong Kong to America. This chapter investigates how Chow’s star image as an ethnic professional, as opposed to a merely exotic supplement, has problematised the formation of Asian subjectivity and Oriental objectivity in Hollywood. Chapter 6 considers the issue of ageing as it affects a star’s screen career, by interrogating Chow’s screen image as a master of martial arts in both Chinese-language and English-language films. This chapter investigates the complex and dynamic interactions between the industry’s practices of star employment, wider social understandings of ageing, and body traditions of martial arts cinema, which is arguably the most successful Chinese film genre in the global commercial film market. This chapter argues that, although ageing has become a challenge regarding Chow’s screen performances and film career in both American and Chinese film markets, it occurs in different ways as a result of the different social attitudes towards ageing and the different representations of the body in Western and Asian cultures. The rise of Chinese stars in the global film market has raised the question of how stars’ public appearances are used to sell films in different markets, and how their cross-border stardom should be understood in local contexts. Chapter 7 addresses these two questions by comparing the Internet discourses surrounding Chow’s star image on both English- and Chinese-language websites. Rather than seeing such cross-border stardom as homogeneously applied to the star’s public status in different film markets, this chapter argues that, in many cases, the perception of a star’s global status is often restricted to a certain regional and cultural space, and the recognition of Chow’s global value is fragmented and plural across different market sectors. Chapter 8 discusses how Chow’s star image is incorporated with the transnational Chinese cinema’s narrative of intergenerational relationships during a period in which China has been recognised as a key player in global affairs and international trade. Through the discursive discussion of the shifting of Chow’s star image, this chapter also illustrates how expatriate Hong Kong stardom is deployed Not for distribution or resale.

I need to point out here that, although this book is organised in chronological order by following Chow’s career moves, it does not mean that the arrangement of individual chapters is entirely linear. In fact, some of the specific dimensions of Chow’s star images discussed in different chapters are actually taken from the same period, which already demonstrates a case of multi-territorial stardom. Through a careful perusal of Chow’s media presence (including the star’s films, television programmes, music albums, commercial advertisements) and accompanying prefigurative materials in both English- and Chinese-language sources, this book attempts to break down the rigid distinctions between the production and consumption of the star image. Finally, as mentioned earlier, this book looks at the construction and circulation of Chow’s star image, both in regional and in transnational film industries and markets. Accordingly, it explores star agency in the translocal imagination of Hong Kong’s cultural identity. However, this book deliberately chooses Chow’s images in the films and media vehicles beyond such popular action films as A Better Tomorrow, The Killer and Hard Boiled (1992), as these have already been studied extensively. The intention here is not to undermine or deny the current interpretation of Chow’s action stardom. Instead, I argue that identifying different aspects of Chow’s star image helps us to understand the complexity of Hong Kong cultural identity, and the necessity for careful consideration when exploring Chow’s star vehicle.\n\nno t e s 1. In 1951, the Crown Colony Government of Hong Kong set up Frontier Closed Areas along the border of northern Hong Kong, and officially adopted policies to control migration. The controlled borders were extended further in 1962. For details see, Hong Kong Legislative Council Police Tactical Unit (2002) and Salaff and Wong (1997: 203). 2.

Hong Kong’s colonial government required every locally produced film to submit a synopsis in both Chinese and English before production, as well as requesting all films to be subtitled in English. This requirement, however, ironically helped the Hong Kong cinema to promote and distribute its films overseas. 4. From 1986 to 1989, Chow starred in between six and eleven films every single year, while from 1990 to 1995, the maximum amount of films in which he starred in a single year was three.

During the 1960s, many Western countries issued a limited number of visas to Chinese applicants (including those from Hong Kong) under the family reunification scheme.

In Canada, a heavy Chinese head tax was introduced at the turn of the 20th century to reduce the number of Chinese migrants (Chinese Canadian Military Museum n.d.; Poy and Cao 2011). Between 1923 and 1947, Canada also adopted a Chinese exclusion act, known as the Chinese Immigration Act (1923), to bar Chinese immigrants (Price 2012). It was not until the 1970s that the new immigration rules and policies in the United States and Canada allowed more Chinese people, especially those from Hong Kong and Macau, to enter North America as travellers, skilled workers and businessmen. For details of the Chinese Exclusion Act, see Law (2010) and Soennichsen (2011). 6. The ‘fifth generation’ refers to a group of Chinese filmmakers who achieved international fame during the 1980s and 1990s. The majority of these filmmakers graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in the early 1980s. They won many top awards at global film festivals and rejuvenated the popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Examples include Zhang Yimou’s Red Sorghum (1988), which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, while his The Story of Qiu Ju (1992) won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival; Chen Kaige’s Farewell My Concubine (1993) was awarded a Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival; Tian Zhuangzhuang’s The Blue Kite (1993) won the Tokyo Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Film Festival; and Wu Ziniu’s Evening Bell (1989) was awarded a Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. Many of these films were produced with investment from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong film industry has been heavily involved in the global distribution of these films made by fifthgeneration directors in mainland China. 7. In the early 1980s, Golden Harvest tried to introduce Jackie Chan, already a big star in Hong Kong, to the American market. Casting Chan as a young fighter in two Englishlanguage films The Big Brawl (1980) and The Cannonball Run (1981), Golden Harvest’s intention to promote Chan as a new male Chinese icon in the American market turned out to be a failure. Chan returned to Hong Kong without achieving any success, and subsequently concentrated on developing his own style of Kung Fu comedy.\n\nNot for distribution or resale.

The production of Hong Kong films was also hindered by import taxes and quota systems affecting films that were introduced in the 1970s in many Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, which used to be major overseas markets for Hong Kong films.1 By contrast, Hong Kong’s local TV industry experienced rapid growth. As Zhong Baoxian (2004: 240) observed, while the Hong Kong TV industry provided an alternative site for established filmmakers to continue to work when the Cantonese cinema experienced a downturn in the 1960s and early 1970s, it also cultivated many new talents who later became the key workforce of the Hong Kong cinema in the 1980s. To a great extent, the 1970s’ Hong Kong TV industry can be seen as an indispensable linkage connecting the Hong Kong cinema of the 1960s and the 1980s, not only because the operational correlation between Hong Kong’s TV and film studios in this period was too close to be ignored, but also because local stars and creative talents frequently traversed the two industries.2 Thus, it is important to look at these stars’ TV images if we are to develop an adequate understating of Hong Kong film stardom. In the 1970s, Hong Kong TV studios adopted a similar star system to 1960s’ film studios. Backed by strong financial input and a vast pool of viewers, TVB was known as the ‘cradle of stars’ and as a ‘dream factory of stars’ (Zhong 2004: 318; Pang and Zheng 2005). Following the example of the Shaw Brothers, Hong Kong’s biggest film studio in the 1960s and 1970s, TVB also tried to control its stars and their images.3 As one of these studio-trained actors, Chow spent nearly fourteen years at TVB before moving exclusively to the film industry. During this period, Chow acted in nearly a thousand episodes of TV dramas, which earned him the reputation of the ‘king of TVB drama’ by the Not for distribution or resale.

As the starting point of his acting career, Chow’s experience in the local TV industry and the circulation of his image in and around local TV dramas was crucial for establishing his stardom and popularity with the local public. The principal paradox of stardom is its combination of the ordinary and the extraordinary. As John Ellis (1991: 313) argued, television only presents a personality or celebrity because it ‘reduce[s] the star phenomenon by reducing the extraordinariness of its performers’. Placing the ‘presence–absence’ binary at the centre of his argument, Ellis emphasised that a star’s charisma comes from his or her absence from the daily lives of ordinary people, and only film’s photo effects could impute a ‘rarity value’ to a star’s image. This rarity value, according to Ellis (1991: 313), is the source of a star’s extraordinary glamour. As in Roger Silverstone’s (1994) study on television, Ellis (1991: 313) also regarded television as a medium that derives power and significance from everyday life. While agreeing with David Lusted’s (1991: 256) argument that television connects the popularity of these personalities with their audience by offering a crucial form of recognition and expression, Ellis further claimed that television performers do not activate any conflict of meaning or real enigma because of their frequent contact with the audience. Based on this observation, Ellis (1991: 314) argued that television performers ‘bear a fairly minimal relationship to the desire of the spectator’, because they are known by the audience for their familiarity rather than for their remoteness. However, while Ellis’ extraordinary–ordinary framework is a valuable tool in helping us to understand the differentiation between a celebrity/­personality and a star, his rejection of TV stardom is questionable. In her study of cult television stardom, Roberta E. Pearson (2004: 67) argued convincingly that the domestic nature of television viewing, the close affinity of the celebrity with the consumers of their images, and the continuity and integrity of character and actor, do not necessarily expel star charisma from TV performers. In a similar vein to Pearson, this chapter demonstrates how, under the circumstances in Hong Kong in the 1970s and early 1980s, the closeness and familiarity between a TV actor and the audience created a sense of intimate reality which, instead of diminishing the desire of spectators, enhanced such desires in tandem with the star’s extraordinariness.\n\nM o d e r n Xiaosheng : a R o m a n tic , G ood-l ook in g Y o u ng M an In 1957, Rediffusion Television (hereafter referred to as RTV; later restructured as Asia Television Limited in 1982 – hereafter referred to as ATV) aired the first TV programme in Hong Kong.

However, during the early period of Hong Kong’s TV history, the majority of programmes were imported from foreign countries, such as the United States, Japan and Britain. There was only a handful of locally produced programmes, which were hosted by, or starred, actors from early Cantonese cinema and Cantonese operatic theatre, such as Ng Cho-fan, Cheung Ying, Mark Sin-sing/Heung-kam Lee and Lydia Shum. To meet the public demand for local programmes, TV studios had to broadcast old Cantonese films, many of which were already adaptations of theatrical performances from classical Cantonese opera. With the depreciation of television prices, more working-class families have been to afford their own television sets since the 1970s. The rate of domestic TV-set ownership soared from 3 per cent in 1957 to 90 per cent in 1976 (Wong and Yu 1978: 3). The popularity of television not only led to a demand for TV companies to provide more Chinese-language programmes, but also required studios to produce more programmes concerning local life. To attract more viewers and to compete with each other, both RTV and TVB started to expand production of their own TV dramas and entertainment shows in the early 1970s. In order to secure talent resources for such productions, both studios started to ­organise training classes for in-house actors. In 1971, TVB and Shaw Brothers co-organised the TV studio’s first training class for actors. Two years later, Chow Yun-fat was recruited by TVB and became a trainee actor. After his graduation, Chow became a contracted actor with the studio. As a new actor at the studio, Chow was only given some walk-on parts and undemanding supporting roles during his first two years with the studio. In 1976, Chow was cast as a leading character for the first time, as Shao Huashan in TVB’s first long-length shizhuang ju (drama in modern dress) Hotel (1976, 128 episodes). Thereafter, Chow gradually attained TV stardom, finally becoming a household name through his performance in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly in 1979 (Zhong 2004: 253). Described by Leslie Fong (1980: n.p.) as ‘tall, elegant and with dark eyes so smouldering they can melt a girl’s heart at 20 paces’, the studio promoted Chow as a typical xiaosheng.4 In addition to his performance on the TV screen, Chow’s appearance and heterosexual attractiveness were frequently emphasised in his dramas’ promotion booklets, which were designed to inform and attract local audiences to watch the new drama. The booklet for The Fate (1981), for example, presented a pseudo interview between Ngai Chun, the character played by Chow, and a journalist. The pseudo interview script started with a short opening comment by the journalist, ‘You are strikingly handsome and generous, and it is widely known that you have many female fans in the public’ (TVB 1981a, n.p.). Similarly, the promotion booklet for The Good Old Times (1981) introduced Chow’s character Ouyang Han as a ‘handsome and charming young man who attracted many females’ (TVB 1981b, Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n22 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom n.p.). Instead of emphasising the actor’s acting skill and his personification of the character, TVB’s emphasis on Chow’s conspicuously good looks not only emphasised the extraordinariness of the TV star’s physical attributes, which distinguished Chow from ordinary people but, more importantly, reinforced the myth of a ‘star look’, propagating the notion that only a few handsome actors have the potential to become xiaosheng-type stars. It is interesting that, while Chow was generally considered to be a goodlooking young man in shizhuang ju, his appearance was often criticised as being unsuitable for playing pre-modern characters. Not only was the mention of Chow’s looks generally omitted in the promotion booklets for his TV dramas that were set in ancient times, but his pre-modern images, such as Liu Chi in The Lone Ranger (1982) and Linghu Chong in The Smiling Proud Wanderer (1984), were also frequently criticised by local critics as being improper and unsuitable compared to classical xiaosheng images promoted by early martial arts cinema and TV dramas (Zhong 2004: 253; Qiao 1991: 23). From texts concerning Chow’s appearance, the conclusion that Chow’s xiaosheng stardom was only acclaimed when set in a contemporary urban background could conceivably be drawn. The question raised is then what is it that makes Chow look good only as a modern character? Responding to just this issue, one of Chow’s fans, Zhou Chengzhen, questioned the legitimacy of differentiating between a man’s modern and premodern looks in his letter to the local film magazine City Entertainment.5 In the letter, Zhou (1982: 38) argued: What is the legitimacy for saying Chow’s image is not suitable for premodern characters? ... Is there any evidence that all ancient men looked like the model promoted by those critics who argued that Chow does not look like a pre-modern xiaosheng?... Those critics’ perception about ‘classical image’ is actually from the traditional Cantonese opera. Using such criteria to judge whether an actor is suitable for playing an ancient xiao­ sheng or not is inappropriate . . . Those xiaosheng images in Cantonese opera were stereotyped . . . That is why while Adam Cheng is deemed to have a ‘classical’ look, Chow is seen as ‘too modern’ with ‘no classical feeling’. Zhou’s argument is important here, as it not only highlights that the portrayal of xiaosheng characters in local TV was often stereotyped, but more importantly it notes that local perceptions of this pre-modern look were largely shaped by, and even derived from, the tradition of Chinese operatic theatre. It is undeniable that the emphasis on appearance is a typical discourse in the traditional Chinese theatre, and it often functions as a visual indicator of a character’s personality or even sexual appeal. Borrowed from Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nthe birth of a tv star 23 traditional Chinese operatic theatre, the concept of xiaosheng suggests that youth, good looks and heterosexual attraction are included in the criteria for casting a leading man. However, everyone has a different appreciation of beauty. Since there is no supplementary make-up to help to formulate the character’s appearance, the depiction of TV and film xiaosheng’s appearance relies, to a greater extent, on the actor’s own features. Zhou’s observation, therefore, is not sufficient to explain the reason that Chow’s pre-modern look became problematic in the eyes of local critics and audiences when the star was generally seen as being simultaneously a good-looking young man and a xiaosheng-type actor. While I agree with Zhou’s argument that there are no specific criteria for judging a man’s modern or pre-modern looks, I would like to further question why a fictional character’s historical background impacts on the local Hong Kong audience’s perceptions of the actor’s appearance. Unlike his counterparts in traditional Chinese operatic theatre, a xiaosheng on TV or on film does not need face painting to make his countenance more dramatic. However, his appearance still functions as a visual sign of social and cultural identity. Often adapted from characters in classic Chinese novels and folk stories, a pre-­ modern xiaosheng is therefore a fictional figure representing the double imagery of a man’s extraordinariness and a remote space in China’s historical past. By contrast, the modern xiaosheng featured in TVB dramas was more often seen in original productions. Many of TVB’s shizhuang ju were set in contemporary spaces with which Hong Kong audiences would have been familiar, telling stories of local people and local life. As ideas of a Western lifestyle and ideals of beauty became more popular in Hong Kong after the Chinese civil war, the portrayal of a modern xiaosheng often emphasised that the character belonged to an urban society and had a Westernised image. Accordingly, judgements of a modern xiaosheng’s appearance would refer increasingly to contemporary cultural ideals of manliness, in which the image of a local young man and a screen image drawn from the romantic lead in Western films and TV dramas were often integrated. Therefore, a modern xiaosheng often possessed two ambivalent features. On one hand, in conjunction with pre-modern xiaosheng and many glamorous film stars, he was considered to be an extraordinary man in terms of his charisma and sexual appeal. On the other hand, he represented an ordinary, local young man. Accordingly, the physical attributes of a modern xiaosheng often indicate both extraordinariness/ordinariness and remoteness/ closeness. As Pamela Robertson Wojcik (2004a: 166) argued, ‘Typecasting contributes to narrative economy, allowing audiences to quickly and easily recognize a character by associating him or her with an actor’s previous roles’. As mentioned earlier, local TV studios recruited many film and Cantonese opera actors in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many of these actors, such as Adam Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n24 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom Cheng, had already established their images as pre-modern xiaosheng before they moved to the TV industry. Even those actors who graduated from TVB’s early actor training classes, such as Wong Wan-choi and Lawrence Ng Waikwok, built up their star images as pre-modern xiaosheng through their performances in historical dramas and martial arts serials; two dominant genres on local TV screens during the early period of Hong Kong’s TV history. By contrast, far fewer actors were known by local audiences primarily for their modern images before the mid-1970s. It might be noted that, except for a few walk-on parts and minor characters, Chow did not play any important premodern characters before he starred in his first long TV drama – Hotel. Thus, at the time playing his first memorable character, any deep inscription of a pre-modern image simply did not exist. In addition, the success of Hotel led to an increase in the production of shizhuang ju, dealing with local young people’s dilemmas about personal growth (such as career development), interpersonal relationships (such as friendship, romance and family) and social problems (such as corruption and the wealth gap). After Chow achieved initial popularity through his urbanised and Westernised role in Hotel, TVB recognised the appeal of this specific type of xiaosheng image for local audiences. Chow was thus subsequently and frequently cast as a modern young man in TVB dramas, such as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and The Fate. Even in period dramas set in the 1930s and 1940s, Chow was always cast as a man who dressed in a Western suit, such as Hui Man-keung in The Bund (1980) and Ouyang Han in The Good Old Times (1981), in contrast to other characters who still wore changshan – a kind of traditional Chinese costume. These early TV works thus served to integrate an urbanised and Westernised image into Chow’s star persona. As a result, when Chow was cast in a pre-modern role in The Lone Ranger in 1982, his strongly established modern persona disrupted the association of his pre-modern look via his modern star image. In this sense, the criticism of Chow’s pre-modern looks indicates local audiences’ refusal to accept the movement of Chow’s image from closeness to remoteness. The relationship between xiaosheng and huadan6 should not be overlooked either. As another typical feature of the two types of roles, heterosexual appeal often suggests that the discourse of romance is a popular narrative in the Hong Kong media. For instance, the cover page of Family Feelings (1980) booklet features a photograph of Chow standing behind his female co-star Carol Cheng, cuddling her with their faces close together, which suggests the intimacy between the two. Furthermore, the booklet not only delineates the romantic story between the two stars’ on-screen characters, but also highlights the image of the two stars as screen lovers. Since it was the second time that Chow and Cheng had starred together in a drama involving a romantic relationship, the booklet explicitly raised the question of whether Chow and Not for distribution or resale.

In this regard, TVB’s promotion of Chow as a new screen icon not only closely followed the tradition of delineating a romantic relationship between a xiaosheng and a huadan, but also responded to the public’s curiosity about the stars’ private romantic lives. It was through these TV dramas, as well as through the discourse in the promotion booklets, that Chow became a star with extraordinary heterosexual attraction. Although the romance narrative in these TVB dramas does not entirely challenge traditional gender relations with their emphasis on male social power, one difference between Chow’s modern xiaosheng and a premodern xiaosheng in terms of ‘whom he loves’ can be identified. Unlike the typical narration of a pre-modern xiaosheng’s romance, in which the huadan is often depicted as a dependent, passive woman whose physical beauty is often highlighted, Chow’s xiaosheng often falls in love with the ‘new women’ who are ‘smart’ and ‘intelligent’ (TVB 1981a, n.p.), ‘independent’ and ‘brave’ (TVB 1980, n.p.), and ‘rebellious’ (TVB 1981b, n.p.). This is in contrast to the pre-modern xiaosheng, who often found females who shared their traditional patriarchal perceptions of gender roles attractive; an example would be that a woman’s domain should be confined to the family. Chow’s modern xiaosheng is more likely to devote his love to career women who challenge traditionally maledominated public and professional domains, such as the magazine editor and business woman Fong Hei-man in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the solicitor Dung Shun-wah in The Fate, factory worker Chow Tong in Family Feelings and so forth. Selecting these females as his ideal partners, Chow’s modern xiaosheng displays his ­appreciation of female talent rather than of physical beauty. Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n26 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom It should be noted here that the portrayal of Chow’s romantic image was informed by rapid social changes in gender roles. Along with industrialisation in Hong Kong, perceptions of gender and gender relationships started to shift in the 1960s as more women joined the workforce and even became their family’s breadwinners. Song Lin (2004) revealed that TVB, under public pressure, rewrote the ending of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly to reunite Chow’s Ching Wai and Cheng’s Fong Hei-man. Similarly, the initial plot of Family Feelings, in which Chow’s Shi Hui and Cheng’s Chow Tong were separated, dissatisfied the public, causing complaint letters to pile up at TVB. As a result, TVB re-shot the ending and added a scene in which Shi Hui confessed his love for Chow Tong in front of her grave. The collective creation of these characters and the popularity of Chow’s modern xiaosheng image in Hong Kong thus indicated that local audiences not only celebrated those female stars, such as Carol Cheng, who represented the rise of the new career woman, but also called for a male icon who valued career women and shared their perception of new gender relations.\n\nL o c a l Xiaosheng : a R o l e M o del of Ho ng Ko ng S uc c e ss Beginning in the 1950s, the rapidly growing economy turned Hong Kong into one of the four Asian Tigers in the 1970s. As Liang Kuan (2002: 123) and Yao Yao (2002: 16) pointed out, respectively, the urbanisation and modernisation of the city changed public taste in media content quickly, and national glory and heroic behaviour were no longer key concerns in Hong Kong’s TV programmes of the 1970s. Instead, local audiences started to show a preference for stories of individual struggles for upward social mobility, a narrative that is evident in many of Chow’s TV dramas. Indeed, this changing taste was underpinned by a growing sense of self. Michael Curtin (2003: 250–1), in his study of Hong Kong’s TV drama, pointed out that Chow’s Ching Wai in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly achieves success through meritorious labour rather than through favours or privileged advantages from friends or family; thus, the character was designed to represent a positive image of a local young man who provided the opportunity for local people to see themselves portrayed as ‘diligent, educated, and law-abiding citizens’ (Curtin 2003: 250–1). By contrast, Ching Wai’s younger brother Ah Chian,7 a chou-type character,8 was designed to represent an illegal immigrant from mainland China, embodying all that is poor, rural, lazy, uncivilised and law-breaking. Unlike an ancient xiaosheng, whose citizenship is often de-emphasised, vague or even absent from discourse, Chow’s TV characters often (though not always) have a clear Hong Kong citizenship, which facilitates local citizens’ pride in the rapid growth of Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nthe birth of a tv star 27 the economy. Consequently, Chow, as the star who portrays Ching Wai and many other similar roles, was recognised as providing a role model for local young men. Chow’s image as a Hong Kong role model was created not only via the characters he played, but also through his own experiences in both the TV and the film industries. With the boss of Shaw Brothers, Run Run Shaw, taking over the chair of TVB’s board of directors in 1980 and gradually moving his core business from Shaw Brothers to TVB, the old studio system was gradually approaching its end in the local film industry. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s film industry became more open to young talent. With increasing investment from the nouveau riche, Hong Kong’s film industry gradually revived and began to witness the growth of independent productions. Towards the end of the 1970s, there was an outflow of talent (including many of the later so-called New Wave directors, as well as actors like Chow) from the TV industry to the film industry. It should be noted that Chow started working in local cinema as early as 1976 – the year he gained his initial stardom through his performance in Hotel. However, Chow’s early attempts in the film industry did not attract much attention (I will discuss Chow’s early film career in more detail in the next chapter). As a result, Chow decided to concentrate on developing his TV career. However, Chow was not entirely satisfied with his personal development at TVB, despite having achieved the top rank of stardom in the TV studio following the broadcast of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. As Chow (cited in Ma 1985: 20) recalled in an interview, I did not have time to study the characters, especially in the TV industry. Each day I got the script for the next day’s scenes. Quite often we just had a brief meeting before the shooting, and the producer then told us what we needed to do in that scene. How could I get time to understand a character? Film is better – at least I get the script before filming; at least I know what I am doing. Dissatisfied with the fast, streamlined production of the TV industry, Chow clearly expressed his concern that the production mode at TVB, which inhibited his understanding of his characters, would affect his acting career negatively. Therefore, in 1980, as New Wave cinema came into force in the local film industry, Chow decided to re-enter the film industry. In 1981, Chow was offered a leading role in Ann Hui’s The Story of Woo Viet. However, his decision to star in the film encountered a resistance from TVB. With Adam Cheng leaving for Taiwan, Wong Yuen-san and Damian Lau Chung-yan moving to RTV, and Patrick Tse reaching middle age, TVB foresaw a shortage of xiaosheng-type stars available for roles as leading men in Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n28 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom its programmes and dramas. In the meantime, local audiences had gradually changed their preferences from long TV dramas to medium-length serials of around fifteen to twenty-five episodes, and such a change increased the demand for leading stars in different shows (Zhong 2004: 253; Qiao 1991: 23). TVB’s competition with its rivals RTV and CTV (Commercial Television) further required the studio to produce more original TV dramas in a speedy way, which again increased the demand for actors. Accordingly, TVB was trying to prevent Chow from acting in Ann Hui’s film. However, Chow was determined to accept the role regardless of TVB’s objections. Threatening to sue TVB over his contract, Chow finally obtained the chance to star in The Story of Woo Viet. However, the issue ultimately brought the star to a crisis in this career during the first half of the 1980s. As Chow (cited in Yang 1994: 49) confessed in 1994, ‘the relationship between TVB and me turned hostile when I was leaving. It meant that an actor’s career could be ruined.’ It is believed that Chow’s contract dissension with TVB caused him a few years of ‘frozen time’ shortly after TVB decided to promote more new in-house actors.9 As a kind of punishment, being ‘frozen’ meant that an actor would not be promoted by the studio, or might not even appear in any of the studio-produced programmes. Since an exclusive contract stops or restricts actors working for other studios during their contracted term, this practice often creates difficult times for the actors regardless of whether or not they are stars. Receiving only a notoriously low basic salary, the ‘frozen’ actors not only have to cope with financial pressure, but also have to face the possibility that their long-term absence from public appearance will lead to their being forgotten by the audience – a risk that could jeopardise their future screen careers. Although Chow was still allowed to appear in some TVB programmes after the contract dispute, Chow’s status as a top xiaosheng in the studio was quickly replaced by new actors (the ‘TVB Five Tigers’10 in particular) in the mid1980s, as Zhong (2004: 320) noted. In comparison to his early TV characters, Chow not only appeared in far fewer TV dramas, but also was more likely to be cast as a middle-aged man or as a supporting character during his last few years at TVB. For example, Chow dyed his hair grey and played a middle-aged triad leader, Lok Chong-hing, in the 1985 TV drama The Battle among the Clans. In another TVB drama, Police Cadet ’85 (1985), Chow was cast as a supporting character, Ging Shing, the uncle of the leading xiaosheng, Cheung Wai-kit (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). In his last TVB serial, The Yang’s Saga (which starred the ‘TVB Five Tigers’), Chow played a minor role, Lü Dongbin, a middle-aged character who is one of the Eight Immortals in Chinese Taoist mythology. These middle-aged supporting characters all seemed to indicate the fading of Chow’s xiaosheng persona. By then, however, Chow was increasingly being accepted as a serious film Not for distribution or resale.

Together with Chow’s move to the film industry and his eventual achievement on the big screen, Chow was also increasingly being recognised by the local audience as a man who managed to achieve success through his personal qualities of industriousness and a sense of self-improvement, just as Ma Hui (1985: 19) observed. Qiao Chu (1991: 22) pointed out that Hong Kong citizens in the 1970s did not want an imaginary hero; what they wanted was a real model whose success could also be theirs. Chow’s experience in the TV industry and his cross-media career exemplified, in some sense, an aura of credibility and reality: the message that extraordinariness is achievable. According to Qiao (1991: 22), Chow was seen by many of his local audience as an ‘aspiration’ rather than as an ‘imagination’ of achievable success. Qiao’s observation is illustrated well by local film critic Shu Kei’s comments in 1987 (cited in Sek et al. 2000: 108–9): The strongest attraction of Chow is that he belongs totally to Hong Kong. He is a star but he has at the same time a down-to-earth quality that enables the audience to identify with him. Few other stars have this rapport with the audience. The closeness we feel towards him comes in part from his television career and in part from his total accessibility. We know about his history . . . He started from the lowest rung in the ladder [TVB actors’ training class] and as he worked his way up step by step, we were there to witness the process. Although Jackie Chan is also a boxoffice guarantee, we cannot feel the same intimacy towards him. First, we know little about his history; secondly, he rose to fame overseas and not in Hong Kong, returning home to develop his career only after achieving success in Japan. His physical prowess elevates him to more of a hero figure than an actor. With Chow Yun-fat, it is the opposite It is clear from Sek’s comments that Chow’s TV experiences, particularly his small-screen characters, facilitated a sense of closeness between the star and the local community. In contrast to Jackie Chan, who was celebrated as a larger-than-life hero, Chow showed local audiences the process and possibility of an ordinary, local young man who not only managed to cope with difficulties and career uncertainty, but who also transformed himself successfully into an extraordinarily glamorous star. As Silverstone (1994: 22 and 175) argued, television is ‘part of the grain of everyday life’, and the consumption of television programmes is incorporated into our private spaces, times and practices. Seeing television as a domestic medium, Silverstone claimed that television is a member of the family in a metaphorical sense, as well as in a literal sense, ‘insofar as it is integrated into Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n30 c ho w y u n- f at and ho ng ko ng stardom the daily pattern of domestic social relations’ (Silverstone 1994: 40). Since other entertainment methods, such as karaoke and video games, did not become popular pastimes until the late 1980s, watching television was one of the most popular forms of entertainment for Hong Kongers in the 1970s and 1980s, as Qiao observed (1991: 21). As a pre-eminent TV star during that period, Chow appeared frequently on this domestic medium. The contact between the audience and the star’s TV characters thus took place in a more intimate, friendly and relaxed environment because TV screens decreased the distance between the actor and the local audience. Chow (cited in Xiao 1987: 3) once stated in an interview: I feel the Hong Kong audience takes me as a friend rather than an icon. Probably starting with TV, I became a son, a friend . . . I am not that kind of hero or xiake [martial arts errant-knight] . . . and I do not have that kind of mysteriousness or arrogance. Audiences see me every day. I have nothing to hide, so they take me as a friend. Chow’s understanding of his relationship with local audiences is well confirmed by Qiao’s (1991: 24) statement that ‘probably no [local] girls or boys took Chow as an icon as Leslie Cheung or Anita Mui . . . It is because Chow lives in their real life and no one would take their neighbour’s son as a biggerthan-life icon.’ From both Chow’s and Qiao’s comments, we may infer that Chow’s star charisma is closely related to the perception of his proximity to local citizens’ daily lives. Therefore, unlike watching an actor playing an idealised xiaosheng character on the screen, local citizens were witnessing the growth of a local young man who was part of their own community. This was particularly important during a period in which Hong Kong citizens began to question their own identities more than ever. Rapid economic progress had transformed Hong Kong into a metropolis by the 1970s, but mainland China still suffered from poor infrastructure, lack of public services and a chaotic financial system in the wake of ten years of the Cultural Revolution. Living conditions and material life in Hong Kong were far more advanced than they were in mainland China, despite the economic reforms in mainland China that began in 1978. In this context, Hong Kongers began to question their Chinese identity. The divergent political ideologies of capitalist Hong Kong and communist mainland China also challenged locals’ perceptions of Hong Kong as ‘Chinese’, especially when rumours of negotiations between the Chinese and British governments regarding the return of Hong Kong’s sovereignty became public in the late 1970s. In the meantime, the discussion about the return of sovereignty also reminded Hong Kong’s citizens of their colonial identity.

The city’s distinctive political status, remarkable economic achievement, and the public’s concern about Hong Kong’s future all increased local citizens’ desires to take control of their local communities. As a local young man who had managed his acting career successfully across media industries, Chow and his xiaosheng image thus allowed local audiences to hope that a local young man could manage to take control of his own fate.\n\nC o nc l u s i o n Chow’s popularity in Hong Kong is inseparable from his early TV career and from Hong Kongers’ growing awareness of their identity. The popularity of television during the mid-1970s created a large audience and fan base for Hong Kong’s local TV star. As a leading xiaosheng-type star at TVB, Chow starred in many long- and medium-length dramas broadcast on prime-time slots. As such, watching Chow on the small screen became ubiquitous entertainment consumed on a daily basis. Chow’s modern xiaosheng image not only helped him to achieve his initial stardom, but also satisfied the public’s demand for a local TV programme that portrayed the lives of ordinary local people. Unlike the pre-modern xiaosheng, whose image embodied imaginative associations with the past and remoteness, Chow’s modern xiaosheng image tended towards the present and an intimate proximity. Although Chow’s TV stardom was controlled well by the studio’s star system, his image as a romantic, urban young man was also the result of negotiation between his Hong Kong audience, his fans’ perceptions of local social changes and the studio’s conventional typecasting practice. Along with the rapid economic growth in Hong Kong’s society, local audiences began to call for a new local icon who could represent Hong Kong’s modern and metropolitan identity. While typecasting in the Hong Kong TV industry still emphasised a leading man’s appearance and heterosexual attraction, the shifting features of Chow’s xiaosheng images indicate the social changes underway during a period in which Hong Kong experienced rapid economic growth and an increasing awareness of political change. While Chow’s TV experiences de-glorified his star image as an extraordinary public icon, his career move provided local citizens with a window through which to view the process of a young man changing and controlling his own fate. The popularity of Chow’s xiaosheng image thus not only met local people’s desire for success but, more importantly, also fulfilled local citizens’ perceptions of themselves and of their society.

In the 1970s, the Indonesian and Malaysian governments introduced a film quota system. For instance, in Indonesia, the number of films imported from Hong Kong decreased from 766 in 1972 to 100 in 1978. Singapore and Thailand also substantially raised its film import and income tax on overseas films since 1976. In Singapore, the import tax on films reached nearly one-third of their price, and in Thailand the import tax increased by fourteen times. Meanwhile, Singapore and Malaysia imposed strict censorship on imported films. For more details, see Zhong (2004: 234–6). 2. In the Hong Kong TV industry, actors and actresses are generally referred to as yiren (entertainers) than as actors. One of the reasons is that actors also need to do additional jobs for the TV studios, such as hosting talk shows or children’s programmes, or singing and dancing in entertainment programmes and variety shows. Since this chapter is mainly concerned with Chow’s star image in TV dramas, I will use the word actor or star when I discuss Chow’s role in TVB. 3. Run Run Shaw, the owner of Shaw Brothers, was one of the major stakeholders at the time that TVB was established. He continued to increase his shares and became the largest stakeholder after Harold Lee Hsiao-wo passed away in 1980. Shaw was the chairman of TVB from 1980 to 2011. For details, see Zhong (2004: 247, 262–7). 4. The terms sheng, dan, jing, mo and chou refer to different character types in traditional Chinese opera. The characters are divided into these categories mainly according to their ages, genders and appearances. Sheng is a term for a male character, and xiaosheng refers to a good-looking young man who often has a romance with a huadan, the young and pretty female character. 5. Most of the critics’ comments and interview scripts analysed in this chapter were published in City Entertainment, a local influential, semi-professional and semi-commercial film journal in Hong Kong. It was also the founder of the Hong Kong Film Awards. 6. See note 4. 7. Ah Chian was the name of a character in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Due to the popularity of the drama, this name became a popular term to refer to other mainland Chinese characters on Hong Kong TV and in film, who are portrayed as uncivilised, dirty, foolish and trouble-making. For a detailed study of the image of Ah Chian, see Cheng (2002: 181–6). 8. Chou is another term from the typecasting in traditional Chinese opera. It often refers to funny or ugly characters, such as clowns. 9. Although TVB has never officially admitted to the practice, rumours about TVB ‘freezing’ its contracts with actors who brought ‘trouble’ to the studio are widespread. As a TV studio greatly influenced by the studio system, TVB adopted similar strategies to those of the Shaw Brothers in the 1950s and 1960s when controlling its contracted stars’ public images and careers. 10. ‘Five Tigers’ was a term used in a programme in an annual TVB jamboree show – the TVB All Star Challenge in 1983. Thereafter, it became a popular term to refer to five TVB contracted actors who attended this show. These five actors were Andy Lau, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Felix Wong Yat-wa, Michael Miu Kiu-wai and Kent Tong, who were all selected and promoted as xiaosheng-type actors by the studio in the 1980s.\n\nNot for distribution or resale.

This can also be confirmed by the list of numerous acting awards that Chow won, as mentioned briefly in the Introduction. To elaborate on this point, we could take a look at the Hong Kong Film Awards nomination list. Between 1985 and 1996, Chow was nominated almost every year, and in some years he even received two or three nominations.
