        "text": "Florida Atlantic University had an alternative this morning for anyone who wasn't lucky enough to win a ticket to see the Dalai Lama.\n\nBut few took advantage of it.\n\nJust a 10-minute walk from the packed arena where the Tibetan leader spoke, about 150 people went to a 2,400-seat auditorium in the Student Union to watch a live simulcast of the speech.\n\nBecky Weeks, a 24-year-old graduate student in the ocean engineering program, said she was \"bummed\" when she found out she didn't win a free ticket into the arena, but she already had the chance to see the Dalai Lama in person when he spoke at Rutgers University in New Jersey about six years ago.\n\n\"He was inspiring,\" she said. \"So I wanted to make sure I could see him again.\"\n\nHearing the Dalai Lama speak had special meaning for Abhijit Pandya, a computer science professor.\n\nHe said that the Dalai Lama blessed him in 1959, right after the Dalai Lama escaped from China to the mountains of India. Pandya was a baby at the time.\n\n\"Ever since that experience, whenever I get a chance to see him, I do,\" Pandya said.\n\nSteven Ghee, a 19-year-old sophomore, lives in university housing on the Boca Raton campus but still set his alarm clock to go off bright and early so that he could get a front row seat for the simulcast.\n\n\"I feel like this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\" he said.\n\nOthers got to experience the speech in person.\n\nJoshua Katz, an FAU psychology student, said he had several offers for the ticket he won in the student-faculty lottery.\n\n\"He is a global figure. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" Katz said. In research for a history class, Katz ran across a peace treaty between Tibet and China, dated 842. \"It was so well-written, almost poetic. It lasted a long time, too. It was poignant to see it.\"\n\nThere were a few disgruntled ticket-holders who found that the only remaining seats were high up and to the side of the stage, so that their view was obstructed by video screens and other equipment.\n\nSome students hanging out in the Student Union didn't even know the simulcast was going on, although they all knew the Dalai Lama was on campus.\n\nMichael Witcoff, a senior, said he normally deletes e-mails from the university and therefore missed the lottery for tickets and never heard about the simulcast.\n\nJean Ardoguein, a sophomore, said he knew about the simulcast but decided to skip it.\n\n\"It's a matter of time,\" he said while working on his laptop in the Student Union right outside the auditorium.\n\nFAU yoga instructor Christine Apter encouraged her students to come, many of whom showed up with their yoga mats.\n\n\"I wanted them to hear his message of peace and compassion,\" she said after the speech was over. \"To me, that's the answer. And he delivers it in such a pure way.\""
