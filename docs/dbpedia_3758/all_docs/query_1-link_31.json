        "text": "For many years now Indian youngsters have been dubbed as the next big thing in the world of chess! Some of them are very popular, some not so well-known, yet very talented. ChessBase India has always tried to identify the talents at a young age and hence, a tournament of the top 32 youngsters in Indian chess (born on or after 2000) was a very exciting one, not just for the viewers but for us as well! Who would win and claim the spot of the most talented junior in blitz? The Super Juniors Cup was organized from the 6th-10th of December 2020. It was a knockout tournament with all the matches being played at a different time and broadcast LIVE on the ChessBase India YouTube channel. The tournament was a huge success with GM Nihal Sarin edging out GM Arjun Erigaisi in the finals. We bring you the 10 most special things about the Super Juniors Cup 2020.\n\n1. 32 of the most talented players\n\nWhen we wrote to 27 of the top rated boys and top five girls, all of them accepted our invitation to play the event! Only IM Leon Mendonca could not be a part of the tournament as he was in Budapest preparing for the Sunway Sitges tournament to get his final GM norm.\n\nNihal Sarin, Praggnanandhaa, Aryan Chopra, Abhimanyu Puranik, Gukesh, Arjun Erigaisi, Raunak Sadhwani are some of the most talented Indian juniors. One of them might well go on to become the next World Champion from Indian chess. It was wonderful to have them all playing together.\n\nParticipants of the Super Juniors Cup 2020\n\nNo.NameFideIDFEDRtgClub/City1GMNihal Sarin25092340IND2620nihalsarin20042GMPraggnanandhaa R25059530IND2608Praggnanandhaachess3GMAryan Chopra5084423IND2585AryanChopra4GMPuranik Abhimanyu5061245IND2584abhidabhi5GMGukesh D46616543IND2563guki11246GMErigaisi Arjun35009192IND2559Inventing_Invention7GMSadhwani Raunak35093487IND2545Raunaksadhwani20058GMHarsha Bharathakoti5078776IND2509Harsha_Bharathakoti9GMIniyan P25002767IND2506superchess200210IMSaksham Rautela35046977IND2480Kcnock200411IMArjun Kalyan35018701IND2477Arjun200212GMPrithu Gupta46618546IND2472elrey200413IMRaja Harshit5089000IND2472Johnking14IMRahul Srivatshav P25059653IND2457indianstar15IMRaghunandan Kaumandur Srihari25004964IND2448kaumandur0116IMMitrabha Guha5057000IND2445mitrabha17IMRathanvel V S25002112IND2445dieselbot18IMAditya Mittal35042025IND2438Thunderbolt190919IMBharath Subramaniyam H46634827IND2437BHARATH_SUBRAMANIYAM20IMRaja Rithvik R35007394IND2408Infinity-Stones21IMAronyak Ghosh25072846IND2436Aronyak122IMKoustav Chatterjee25073060IND2431BetterThanYou2123IMHarikrishnan.A.Ra5081483IND2429hari220924IMSankalp Gupta5097010IND2429Sankalp_Gupta25FMSrihari L R46617116IND2414srihari24110526IMNeelash Saha5094160IND2413Neelash27IMKrishnater Kushager25041142IND2410kushu_attack28WGMVaishali R5091756IND2393vaishali200129WIMDivya Deshmukh35006916IND2305burning_phoenix30WIMVantika Agrawal25050389IND2286chiyabuddha31WIMSharma Isha35006665IND2276PHOENIXME32WFMSavitha Shri B35061887IND2261savithashri\n\n2. The unstoppable Nihal Sarin\n\nNihal Sarin was the top seed of the tournament and also one of the favourites, but there were so many other talented youngsters vying for the top spot. Nihal always makes you wonder - how does he manage to do this with such ease? Right from the first game Nihal kept complete control of the proceedings and managed to win the title by beating Arjun Erigaisi in the finals with a score of 4.5-1.5. If you are curious to know how Nihal was able to maintain control in many of the high pressure situations in different games, we recommend you checking out the interview below where IM Sagar Shah goes through all the important moments of the tournament with Nihal.\n\nIn the Semi-Finals Arjun got the better of Raunak Sadhwani and Nihal Sarin managed to edge out Abhimanyu Puranik by a whisker. The time control in the semis was 2 games of 5+1 and four games of 3+1. The battle between Raunak and Abhimanyu ended in victory for the latter who finished third.\n\n3. Prize money by the viewers\n\nThis was a tournament that happened because of the viewers! On the 57th episode of improving chess stream on ChessBase India, viewers contributed in a huge way via super chats. From that stream we raised Rs.5,23,345 with 492 individuals contributing. Because YouTube takes 30% of the revenue, the total amount that we received was Rs.3,66,342. Out of this ChessBase India had sponsored Rs.90,000 for Ilamparthi's training with Chuchelov in August. The remaining Rs.2,76,342 was to be utilized for this event. The shortfall of Rs. 23,658 (as the total prize fund we decided was Rs.3,00,000) was to be bridged by us (ChessBase India).\n\nChessBase India also launched their memberships (mentioned in a separate point below) and the total amount raised was Rs.47224. Hence in all the total prize fund disbursed during the Super Juniors Cup was Rs.567,224. Below is the break up of the prizes.\n\nRankNamePrize moneySpl.

Amazing plethora of commentators\n\nWhen you are watching a tournament LIVE online, you are very much looking forward to good commentators. IM Sagar Shah and Amruta Mokal were the hosts and were there throughout the duration of the event. Ilamparthi, the 11-year-old talent of Indian chess was present for almost 80% of the event. We had three of the best female players of India joining in - D. Harika, Tania Sachdev and Soumya Swaminathan. Youngsters Leon Mendonca, Aditya Mittal and Raunak Sadhwani also joined in. Surya Ganguly was impeccable with his commentary and it was amazing to have insights by GM Srinath Narayanan as well. Three of the top four in the tournament are players who are currently working with GM Srinath. GMs Karthikeyan Murali joined as a debutant commentator and it was wonderful to have Beast (Adhiban) sharing his thoughts from time to time. One of Nihal's initial trainers and a famous commentator Dmitri Komarov also joined in on the last day for a few minutes! The Wolfpack commentary during the finals was exhilarating as over 18,000 people joined in to watch Nihal and Arjun fight with comments by Anish Giri, Teimour Radjabov and Vidit Gujrathi. We also had the legends Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand who joined in for the Raunak Sadhwani vs Arjun Erigaisi semi-finals. To have the 14th World Champion and a World Championship finalist comment on their games, is a huge boost to these youngsters!\n\n5. Launch of ChessBase India Memberships\n\nIt's been almost a year since we thought about launching the ChessBase India memberships now. Our YouTube channel is one of the most active ones in the world of chess and a lot of people follow the content. Starting the YouTube Memberships would have been a sustainable source of income for the organization. However, the aim of ChessBase India has always been \"Powering Chess in India\". With so many people regularly asking us as to how they could support Indian chess, we decided to make available all the amount earned via memberships to Indian chess players. We started off with all the money raised via memberships from 6-10th December (the duration of the tournament) to be distributed in weighted average method to the top 8 players of the event. The details of all the people who have contributed are given below. We want to maintain the highest level of transparency so that you know that the amount you have donated has been used for the upliftment of Indian chess and Indian chess players.\n\nMembers of

Special prizes\n\nApart from the main prizes, the tournament also had a few special prizes. We are noting them down below:\n\n7. Exhibition Matches\n\nOn the final day, we had two exhibition matches to bring a different flavour to the livestream. One of the matches that was planned was Samay Raina + Ilamparthi vs Vaibhav Sethia + Anuradha Beniwal in a hand and brain encounter. Samay and Vaibhav, two of India's finest stand-up comedians, were part of the Improving Chess series. Ilamparthi was present when the prize money of the event was raised during episode 57. And Anuradha Beniwal has been doing some fantastic work in empowering young girls across India with the help of chess!\n\nThe tournament was organized by ChessBase India Foundation. Today the foundation has been doing consistent work in order to promote the game. A couple of years when we began there were a couple of individuals who believed in us and started the first two ChessBase India scholarships - MKG Scholarship by Jagadeesh Balakrishnan and Pursue your chess scholarship by Ashwin Subramanian.\n\n8. Team effort\n\nThe entire event was a team effort by several individuals in the ChessBase India team.\n\nShahid Ahmed (top left) made sure that each and every player was contacted before the event and all the technical requirements with regards to anti-cheating and broadcast were taken care off. He also did daily detailed reports on ChessBase India newspage and coordinated with all the players to be on time for each of the encounters. Avathanshu Bhat (top right) is just 15 years old but is already a prolific writer. He contacted all the players and wrote a 200 word bio about them along with a unique nickname! Abhyudaya Ram (bottom left) was the creative designer for the event and prepared all the posters and thumbnails which made the event professional and interesting. Vivek Sohan (bottom right) was the chief arbiter of the event and ensured that all the rules were adhered to with regards to pairing as well as anti-cheating measures. A word of special mention to Prakhar P. who is a video editor and edited some of the videos of the Super Junior Cup which were loved by one and all.\n\n9.
