        "text": "Parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom, 1945 onwards\n\nHarrow East is a constituency[n 1] in Greater London created in 1945 and represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Bob Blackman, a Conservative.[n 2]\n\nThe censuses of 2001 and 2011 show the overwhelmingly most common housing type of the area to be semi-detached houses – almost a majority – followed by mid-rise apartments (whether purpose-built or converted from older houses), then terraced houses and then detached houses. They also show a consistently lower-than-average proportion of social housing than for Greater London.[2]\n\nThe constituency is served by three separate commuter railway lines running into central London, and has many parks and sports grounds. Few arterial roads bisect Harrow East – further east is the start of the M1 motorway, and in the middle of seats further south in north-west London are the A40 Western Avenue and North Circular Road, omitting the boundaries drawn from the arterial road-building projects of the 1940s-to-1970s period.\n\nThe seat was created in 1945 and has been varied due to two sets of major ward reconfigurations and by other national boundary reforms. The predecessor seats were Hendon and to a much lesser extent Harrow.\n\nSince 1945 it has been a stronger area for the Labour Party than neighbouring Harrow West; nevertheless, the seat been mostly held by the Conservative Party. Labour did win here in landslide victories in 1945, 1966 and 1997, and after the latter, held on in the two subsequent general elections. The seat was regained in 2010 by a Conservative on a high turnout, though Labour's incumbent managed to hold on to Harrow West, largely due to boundary changes which favoured Labour there. Residents in the borough include fewer people in the category of no qualifications than the national average, in 2011, at 16.8%;[3] Notably, Harrow East was the most ethnically diverse Conservative-held constituency in the general elections of 2015 and 2017, apparently bucking a trend whereby the party is generally less supported than Labour among ethnic minorities.[4]\n\nCommencing with the 1979 general election, the seat has been a bellwether by reflecting the national result. The 2017 result produced the 29th-most marginal majority of the Conservative Party's 317 seats by percentage of majority.[5]\n\nBy the 2024 general election, it had bucked its bellwether status by being the sole seat in the United Kingdom in which the Conservative candidate won more than 50% of the vote, despite a landslide national victory for the Labour Party. It also saw the second-largest percentage majority of any Conservative-held seat, behind only Richmond and Northallerton, the seat of Conservative leader and then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\n1945–1950: The Urban District of Harrow wards of Kenton, Stanmore North, Stanmore South, Wealdstone North, Wealdstone South, and part of Harrow Weald ward.\n\n1950–1955: As above, but the whole of Harrow Weald, and without Wealdstone North or Wealdstone South.\n\n1955–1974: The Municipal Borough of Harrow wards of Belmont, Harrow Weald, Queensbury, Stanmore North and Stanmore South.\n\n1974–1978: The London Borough of Harrow wards of Belmont, Harrow Weald, Queensbury, Stanmore North and Stanmore South.\n\n1978–1983: The London Borough of Harrow wards of Canons, Centenary, Harrow Weald, Kenton East, Stanmore Park, Stanmore South and Wemborough.\n\n1983–2010: The London Borough of Harrow wards of Canons, Centenary, Greenhill, Harrow Weald, Kenton East, Kenton West, Marlborough, Stanmore Park, Stanmore South, Wealdstone and Wemborough.\n\n2010–2024: The London Borough of Harrow wards of Belmont, Canons, Edgware, Harrow Weald, Kenton East, Kenton West, Queensbury, Stanmore Park and Wealdstone.\n\nFurther to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency is composed of:\n\nThe London Borough of Brent ward of Queensbury.\n\nThe London Borough of Harrow wards of: Belmont; Canons; Centenary; Edgware; Harrow Weald; Kenton East; Kenton West; Stanmore.[6]\n\nThe Borough of Brent ward of Queensbury was transferred from the abolished constituency of Brent North, thus uniting the parts of the suburb of Queensbury in Brent with those in Harrow. Other boundary changes included the transfer of Wealdstone to Harrow West.\n\nElection Member[7] Party 1945 Frederick Skinnard Labour 1950 Ian Harvey Conservative 1959 by-election Anthony Courtney Conservative 1966 Roy Roebuck Labour 1970 Hugh Dykes Conservative 1997 Tony McNulty Labour 2010 Bob Blackman Conservative\n\nWith 53.3% of the vote, Blackman received the highest vote share for any Conservative candidate that stood in the election, and was the only Conservative elected with an absolute majority.[8] He was one of three Conservative MP's to be re-elected with an increased majorities.[9]\n\nGeneral election 2024: Harrow East[10] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 11,680 24.4 +7.9 Turnout 47,777 62.5 –6.1 Registered electors 76,386 Conservative hold Swing +3.6\n\n2019 notional result[11] Party Vote % Conservative 28,555 54.6 Labour 19,568 37.4 Liberal Democrats 3,930 7.5 Green 136 0.3 Brexit Party 98 0.2 Turnout 52,287 68.5 Electorate 76,299\n\nGeneral election 2019: Harrow East[12][13] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 8,170 16.5 +13.1 Turnout 49,491 68.6 −2.3 Registered electors 72,120 Conservative hold Swing +6.5\n\nGeneral election 2017: Harrow East[14][15] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 1,757 3.4 −6.3 Turnout 50,845 70.9 +1.9 Registered electors 71,755 Conservative hold Swing -3.1\n\nGeneral election 2015: Harrow East[16][17] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,757 9.7 +2.6 Turnout 49,000 69.0 +1.9 Registered electors 70,981 Conservative hold Swing +1.3\n\nGeneral election 2010: Harrow East[18] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,403 7.1 N/A Turnout 48,006 67.1 +5.8 Registered electors 70,510 Conservative gain from Labour Swing -7.0\n\nGeneral election 2005: Harrow East[19] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,730 9.3 −13.8 Turnout 50,823 60.5 +2.1 Registered electors 83,904 Labour hold Swing −6.9\n\nGeneral election 2001: Harrow East[20] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 11,124 23.1 +6.0 Turnout 48,077 58.4 −12.8 Registered electors 82,269 Labour hold Swing +3.0\n\nGeneral election 1997: Harrow East[21] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 9,737 17.1 N/A Turnout 57,020 71.3 −6.5 Registered electors 79,981 Labour gain from Conservative Swing -18.1\n\nGeneral election 1992: Harrow East[22] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 11,098 19.1 −11.6 Turnout 58,169 77.8 +4.4 Registered electors 74,733 Conservative hold Swing -6.2\n\nGeneral election 1987: Harrow East[23] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 18,273 30.6 +8.7 Turnout 59,582 73.5 +1.0 Registered electors 81,124 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1983: Harrow East[24] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 12,668 21.9 +1.4 Turnout 57,941 72.5 −5.4 Registered electors 79,926 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1979: Harrow East Party Candidate Votes % Majority 7,878 20.50 +11.09 Turnout 36,936 77.85 +2.95 Registered electors 49,354 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election October 1974: Harrow East Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,478 9.41 −1.75 Turnout 36,936 74.90 −7.48 Registered electors 49,315 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election February 1974: Harrow East Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,493 11.16 +0.65 Turnout 40,268 82.38 +6.44 Registered electors 48,878 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1970: Harrow East [26] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,021 10.51 N/A Turnout 38,270 75.94 −6.82 Registered electors 50,395 Conservative gain from Labour Swing\n\nGeneral election 1966: Harrow East [27] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 378 0.96 N/A Turnout 39,119 82.76 +2.78 Registered electors 47,267 Labour gain from Conservative Swing\n\nGeneral election 1964: Harrow East [28] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 2,259 5.88 −8.56 Turnout 38,355 79.98 −4.56 Registered electors 47,954 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1959: Harrow East [29] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 5,947 14.44 +5.58 Turnout 41,161 84.54 +1.92 Registered electors 49,273 Conservative hold Swing\n\n1959 Harrow East by-election[30][31] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 2,220 6.6 −2.2 Turnout 28,795 68.96 −13.64 Registered electors 48,820 Conservative hold Swing -1.1\n\nGeneral election 1955: Harrow East [32] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,622 8.86 +2.99 Turnout 40,864 82.62 −5.24 Registered electors 49,460 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1951: Harrow East [33] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,171 5.87 +3.10 Turnout 53,950 87.86 +0.63 Registered electors 61,408 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1950: Harrow East [34] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 1,464 2.77 N/A Turnout 52,922 87.23 +9.89 Registered electors 60,668 Conservative gain from Labour Swing\n\nGeneral election 1945: Harrow East Party Candidate Votes % Majority 6,770 11.39 Turnout 59,462 77.34 Registered electors 76,883 Labour win (new seat)\n\nList of parliamentary constituencies in London"
