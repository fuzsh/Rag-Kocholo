        "text": "Case Report\n\nWritten informed consent was provided by the patient to have the case details and any accompanying images published. Institutional approval was not required to publish the case details. The patient was a 78 -year -old African -American male who presented with diminution of vision of the right eye over the previous 24 hours. He stated that something went into his right eye while he was mowing the lawn. He was alert and neurologically intact. The signs of traumatic right eye injury was bullous sub-conjunctival hemorrhage and lid edema on the medial aspect of upper lid. He was a known diabetic and hypertensive. On examination, his visual acuity was hand movements in the right eye and 20/30 in left eye (best corrected visual acuity). He was found to have relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the right eye. There was no restriction of extraocular movements in both eyes. Slit lamp evaluation showed a bullous sub-conjunctival hemorrhage in the right eye, the posterior limit of which could not be defined. The cornea was clear in both eyes with an intact anterior chamber and no evidence of inflammation. There were cortical cataracts of both eyes. Intraocular pressure on applanation tonometer was 14 and 18 mm Hg in the right and left eye respectively. There was no view of a right eye fundus examination. The left eye fundus examination revealed mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy changes with grade I hypertensive retinopathy and trace epiretinal membrane.\n\nA B-scan ultrasound evaluation of the right eye revealed vitreous hemorrhage, macula off retinal detachment without any evidence of an intraocular foreign body or traction on retina. No retinal break was appreciated on the B scan. A spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was not possible in the right eye and in the left eye old focal laser scars, infero-nasal retinal folds and an epiretinal membrane were noted. A review of systems was normal without any evidence of a focal neurological deficit.\n\nAn orbital CT scan done prior to the visit to our facility, in an outside emergency facility revealed no intraocular/intraorbital foreign body, no disruption of the orbital wall but vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye ( – ).\n\nBased on our initial evaluation and radiological results blunt ocular trauma was thought to be responsible for such a presentation. The patient was informed of their condition and the need for globe exploration and the possible need of repair of retinal detachment. The patient agreed to the surgery and emergency surgery was performed after the appropriate consent was obtained. The patient underwent globe exploration with pars plana vitrectomy for the repair of a retinal detachment, along with endolaser and silicon oil infusion. During the globe exploration there was no evidence of any intraocular/intraorbital foreign body or globe dehiscence, but a small graze wound to the nasal side of the globe was present. This led the clinician to investigate further.\n\nThe history of a high-velocity injury, the presence of a bulbar conjunctival hemorrhage without the posterior defined limit, and the intra-operative graze wound on the nasal side of the globe led the clinician to re-investigate the neuroimaging to be able to understand the exact etiology of the subject’s vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. A repeat orbital CT scan along with a CT scan of the brain and sinuses was obtained ( and ). To our surprise an intracranial magnetic foreign body lodged in the right frontal lobe was noted. The patient was referred for an emergen cy neurosurgical evaluation, and he underwent urgent neurosurgical intervention for the removal of the intracranial foreign body.\n\nIt appears that a magnetic foreign body must have entered the right nasal orbit outside the muscle cone while the paient was mowing the lawn and it traversed to the frontal lobe where it became lodged. The foreign body was initially missed on the orbital CT scan done in the outside facility."
