        "text": "Toponym matching, i.e. pairing strings that represent the same real-world location, is a fundamental problemfor several practical applications. The current state-of-the-art relies on string similarity metrics, either specifically developed for matching place names or integrated within methods that combine multiple metrics. However, these methods all rely on common sub-strings in order to establish similarity, and they do not effectively capture the character replacements involved in toponym changes due to transliterations or to changes in language and culture over time. In this article, we present a novel matching approach, leveraging a deep neural network to classify pairs of toponyms as either matching or nonmatching. The proposed network architecture uses recurrent nodes to build representations from the sequences of bytes that correspond to the strings that are to be matched. These representations are then combined and passed to feed-forward nodes, finally leading to a classification decision. We present the results of a wide-ranging evaluation on the performance of the proposed method, using a large dataset collected from the GeoNames gazetteer. These results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform individual similarity metrics from previous studies, as well as previous methods based on supervised machine learning for combining multiple metrics.\n\nIn this paper we describe the participation of the LSI UNED team in the multilingual web person name disambiguation (M-WePNaD) task of the IberEval 2017 competition. Our proposal is based on the use of word embeddings for representing the documents related to individuals sharing the same person name. This may lead to an improvement of the clustering process that aims to eventually separate those documents depending on the individual they refer to. This is one of the first approximations to the use of techniques based on embeddings for this kind of tasks. Our preliminary experiments show that a system using a representation setting based on word embeddings is able to obtain promising results on the addressed task, overcoming the proposed baselines in all the tested configurations.\n\nDespite all existing methods to identify a person, such as fingerprint, iris, and facial recognition, the personal name is still one of the most common ways to identify an individual. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms: The first one uses sound techniques to create a multi-dimensional vector representation of names to compute a degree of similarity. This algorithm compares names that are written in different languages (cross-language) and transliterated names in English. The second algorithm builds on the first one and measures the similarities between full names, taking into account the full name structure. We evaluate the algorithms for transliterated names and across languages using Arabic and English as an example. Significant results are achieved by both algorithms compared with other existing algorithms.\n\nA person may have multiple personal name aliases on the web. Identifying aliases of a name is useful in information retrieval and knowledge management, sentiment analysis, relation extraction and name disambiguation. The objective of detecting aliases from the web is to retrieve all the information pertaining to a personal name whose content is described with different nick names in different documents of web. As of now, web contains aliases of popular personalities in various domains like sports, politics, medicine, music, cinema etc., and does not contain alias information about common man. Recently, there are proven methods of extracting aliases through lexical pattern based retrieval tested using real-world name-alias pairs in Japanese and English as training data related to limited domains. In this paper, we discuss on how this information retrieval process has been grown now, and what the future directions are and also the scope of alias extraction in Inter-disciplinary fields."
