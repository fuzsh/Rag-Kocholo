Looks alright at this moment, looks a good track. No grass on the pitch, I guess it will get slower. It's better than New York. We have to adapt to the conditions quickly. We have been here for a couple of days, we have played a lot of cricket. It's about understanding what we need to do in conditions like these. It's an early start. Usually start in the evening elsewhere. We enjoy playing here. We have made one change, Kuldeep comes in for Siraj.”\n\nFollow the IND vs AFG live score here\n\nMeanwhile, Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan, after the toss, said:\n\n“We would have liked to bat first. It's more about how you play the game in T20s. Happy with our preparations and how things have gone. We are facing good teams, need to control our emotions and play our natural game. It does help getting used to the conditions. We have to play good cricket. We have one change, Karim Janat is not playing, Zazai comes in.”\n\nALSO READ: 'Found 4-5 players...': Mohammad Hafeez exposes shocking dressing room secrets of Pakistan team following T20 World Cup exit\n\nALSO READ: RCB legend urges Rahul Dravid to let Virat Kohli bat at this position in India vs Afghanistan's T20 World Cup Super 8 clash\n\nIndia's Playing XI:\n\nRohit Sharma(c), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah\n\nAfghanistan's Playing XI:\n\nRahmanullah Gurbaz(w), Ibrahim Zadran, Najibullah Zadran, Hazratullah Zazai, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan(c), Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi\n\nALSO READ: IND vs AFG: Afghanistan struggle to find Halal food in Barbados ahead of Super 8 clash; forced to cook their own meals\n\nPitch Report\n\n“Lovely weather conditions. 58m, 67m square boundaries, 70m down the ground. It looks a really good pitch with a few cracks on it. The ball should come on to the bat nicely and the bowlers need to bowl in the right areas. Batters should prosper on this wicket. A bat first pitch,” reckons Sunil Gavaskar.\n\nHead-to-Head\n\nIf we look at the India versus Afghanistan's track record against each other in the T20 World Cups, Rohit Sharma's men have an edge over Rashid's brigade. The two teams have clashed three times with each other in T20 World Cups so far, with India emerging victorious in all encounters. Their most recent matchup in this marquee tournament took place during the 2021 edition in Dubai.\n\nMORE ON SPORTS TAK\n\nVeteran spinner quits captaincy after team's early elimination from T20 World Cup 2024\n\nBig News: BCCI announces India's home fixtures for season 2024-2025, 17 matches to be played in 5 months; Know full schedule\n\n'His knock was very crucial': Phil Salt credits this player as real hero for win over West Indies in T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 showdown"
