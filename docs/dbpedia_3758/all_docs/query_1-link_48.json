One such event is the 23rd Individual World Senior Chess Championship to be held in Opatija, Rijeka, Croatia under the organization of Chess Club Rijeka from November 11 to 24.\n\nMore than 250 players from all over the world and the 5 Continents will play (about 30 women, among them Nona Gaprindashvili). The 23rd World senior chess championship for men and women is open to all players representing the FIDE Chess Federations, regardless of their title or rating, providing that the men are older than 60 and women are older than 50 years of age. For example, each male participant in the 23rd World senior Championship must be born in 1953 or earlier (women -1963) to be allowed to participate. There is also no limit of participants per federation.\n\nAccommodation will be provided by the Grand Hotel Milenij and the championship will take place in the Congress centre Tamaris which is located within the hotel complex practically next to the hotel rooms.\n\nThe total prize fund of the 23rd individual senior chess championship 2013 amounts to 18.000,00 euro, of which 14.000,00 will be paid to the male players, while 4.000,00 euro will be reserved for female players.

The game may have been invented in India some 1,500 years ago, but the country got its first Grandmaster only in 1988. Similarly Norway had a strong chess culture, but did not have players who could pose a challenge to world champions.\n\nPrior to Carlsen, Simen Agdestein was Norway’s most famous chess player. In fact the 46-year-old, who won seven national championships and even made eight appearances for the Norway football team, competed with Anand during the latter’s world junior title run in 1987.\n\nAgdestein did not make it all that big in chess. For the record, his brother Espen happens to be\n\nCarlsen’s manager.\n\nIn a way, Bobby Fischer, Anand and Carlsen did what their countrymen couldn’t. When Fischer won the world title in 1972, he had brought an end to the Soviet hegemony in chess. Almost 30 years later, Anand did the same by putting Asia on the chess map. And if Carlsen succeeds in dethroning Anand, the Norwegian will become western Europe’s first world chess champion in 75 years. Dutchman Machgielis “Max” Euwe was the world champion from 1935 to 1937.\n\nIn that sense Euwe, Fischer and Anand took on Russia. But it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Carlsen is up against India. Nay, an Indian, who has been the undisputed world champion since 2007.\n\nLike Anand and Fischer, Carlsen is not quite a superstar in Norway. Each of these gentleman has, of course, greatly influenced the younger generation. Football is the top game in Norway, the equivalent of cricket in India. And for geographic reasons, skiing is a more popular sport in the Scandinavian country.\n\nThis year, Carlsen was awarded the title of the sportsman of the year by Norway’s leading newspapers. “Everybody recognises him (in Norway). He is not mobbed because the people are normally very polite. So they don’t run up to him. He can walk around (in peace). But definitely, everybody knows who he is,” Carlsen’s manager says.\n\nThat is more like Anand commenting on his public appearances since he shot to fame in the 1990s. Norway is also doing an India: they are trying to capitalise on Carlsen’s rise by organising a series of world chess events. Norway Chess 2013, held earlier this year, was one of the best tournaments of all time. The country will also host the Chess World Cup and the Chess Olympiad soon.\n\nWhen Carlsen came to Chennai in August, a couple of mediapersons accompanied him. They were from Verdens Gang (VG), an internet firm which sponsors Carlsen. Their tabloid reported on his visit to Chennai. They also covered his showing in the simultaneous display at a school where he played 20 games, lost four and drew six.\n\nThe report mentioned that some of the participants who were lined up against the jet-lagged Carlsen were rated 2,300 and above. It also pointed out that Garry Kasparov insisted that “none of his opponents be rated above 2,000 if he is to meet them in simultaneous play”.\n\nInterestingly, the paper picked out Ram Aravind of Trichy, the youngest player who beat the World No.1 Carlsen, and six-year old Savitha Sri who extended the Norwegian to 40 moves before losing.\n\nEver since Anand became a popular tournament player in the 1990s, India started producing many age-group world champions. The Carlsen effect in Norway is almost similar, though it will take them a few years to produce another world-class player. Grandmaster Ludvig Hammer is turning heads and is reportedly part of Carlsen’s team of seconds. But it will take him a while to join the big league.\n\nThe fundamental similarities apart, Anand and Carlsen have different personalities. While Anand is choosy about his sponsors, the Norwegian does fashion shoots with Liv Tyler, the American actress and model. He enjoys football-style sponsorship deals and was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people earlier this year.\n\nUnlike Anand, who became World No. 1 at 37, Carlsen reached the top when he was just 20. And he scaled the Mount Everest of chess by going past Garry Kasparov’s ELO rating of 2851. Carlsen wouldn’t want to follow Anand on one front. A very good tournament player, it took the Indian almost a decade to win the first of his five world titles. Carlsen looks hungry. He wants that title soon.\n\nFrom Alexandra Kosteniuk's\n\nwww.chessblog.com\n\nAlso see her personal chess blog\n\nat www.chessqueen.com\n\nDon't miss Chess Queen™\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nLabels: Magnus Carlsen, simen agdestein, Viswanathan Anand, word chess championship 2013\n\nPanama Chess Open 2013 Begins with GMs Lazaro Bruzon and Sergei Tiviakov as Top Seeds... in Panama ;)\n\nChess Blog for Daily Chess News and Trivia (c) Alexandra Kosteniuk, 2013\n\nHello everyone,\n\nAll that remains of 2013 is going to be a splendid chess season.

However, not many people realise that a lot of physical training goes into the making of a chess champion.\n\nHours are spent in the gym training to make the body a willing servant through which the mind can impose its will.\n\nThe World Chess Championship is likely to showcase the myriad facets of the game at the highest level as Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carslen face off.\n\nWorld No 1 Carlsen is well known for playing long and physically taxing games and is usually reluctant to agree to draws – something that goes with his terrier-like approach. Since the championship is expected to be a demanding affair, the 43-year-old Anand has been cycling, swimming and walking in his bid to be prepared for his much younger opponent. “Anand can expect some long games against Carlsen. That will be demanding on his body and considering that, he has to be at his physical best,” says GM Dibyendu Barua.\n\nDr Sanjeev Sahni, sports psychologist, who has worked with more than a few top chess players, can walk the talk in this department.\n\n“To be a top level player, one needs to have a combination of talents working in peak condition. The first few things that come to mind are good anticipation time, attentional focus and decision-making abilities. Each individual has an innate anticipation and focus, while taking decisions within a stipulated time helps in honing these strengths,” says Sahni.\n\n“After that, one looks at neuro-muscular coordination — the synergy between mind and body, and finally, electrodermal response, a change in the electrical properties of the skin in relation to stress.”\n\nSahni, a former Sports Authority of India scientist for 14 years, was known as ‘the electronic psychologist’ because of the psycho-diagnostic equipment that he helped develop for athletes back in the day.\n\n“The problem is that in India we still think that one psychologist for an entire team is a good bargain, whereas abroad each player has one!” he exclaims.\n\nThe most overlooked part in chess is the need for the body to be a good medium. Many people dismiss chess or even golf as sport because it doesn’t fulfill their idea of physicality.\n\nHowever, Dr Alok Pandey, avid chess player and psychologist feels that if the mind is in control then the physical will follow suit, but it is getting there that is difficult.\n\n“One little distraction can cause a monumental change in the game. Players have to stay alert and manage the conditions better than their opponent. Walking from time to time helps in releasing any muscle spasm from continuous sitting and consistent movement of the eyelids prevents strain,” he advises.\n\nPandey, a retired Indian Air Force Wing Commander, argues that while being patient has its rewards, having body awareness is imperative to withstand the various pressures that are always trying to surface. “There is no way around developing oneself if one wants to compete at the highest level. In the end it has to be a synthesis of mind and body and that is the ultimate test.” (The New Indian Express)\n\nFrom Alexandra Kosteniuk's\n\nwww.chessblog.com\n\nAlso see her personal chess blog\n\nat www.chessqueen.com\n\nDon't miss Chess Queen™\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nLabels: alok pandey, Chess, Magnus Carlsen, physical fitness, rohan sharma, sanjeev sahni, Viswanathan Anand, world chess championship 2013\n\nTagaytay City Wins Asian Cities Chess Team Championship (Dubai Cup)\n\nChess Blog for Daily Chess News and Trivia (c) Alexandra Kosteniuk, 2013\n\nHello everyone,\n\nThe Tagaytay City team has won the Asian Cities Chess Team Championship (Dubai Cup) held 19-27 October 2013 in Tagaytay City, Philippines.

Chennai is the home city of World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand. Understandably, there is a considerable chess following there.\n\nThe All India Chess Federation (AICF) has started a \"signature campaign\". It's an interesting way for fans to show support for the World Chess Champion. A vehicle - decorated with posters - tours Chennai. Along the way, fans scribble signatures in support of Viswanathan Anand.\n\nAccording to a press release, this special \"campaign vehicle\" was flagged off from the Nehru stadium recently. The Tamil Nadu Government, AICF and Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) are also hoping to create awareness about the forthcoming World Chess Championship and encourage children to play chess through this signature campaign.\n\n“This is a good start for the World Chess Championship and people will be more interested in chess as the trend picks up,” said Hariharan, AICF Secretary. “This is a unique way to create awareness — something very wonderful that starts from the land to which Vishwanathan Anand belongs,” added Bharath Singh Chauhan, CEO, AICF. Members from AICF, chess and sports enthusiasts signed on the canvas as a mark of support to Anand.\n\nThe AICF has planned to organise several events in the run up to the Championship. An open house competition in which citizens of Chennai will have the opportunity to challenge Indian chess players will be held on Monday. Several chess competitions and training camps were organised for school children by AICF and SDAT in the past month.\n\nThe FIDE World Chess Championship match between Vishwanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen of Norway will take place from November 7 – 28.

The chess feature also talks about Carlsen having assisted Anand earlier.\n\nBut, the big paragraphs to note are these:\n\nHowever, sources close to the Anand camp have informed that Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda, two Indian Grandmasters, had been working with the defending champion in Germany. It's a great honour for any player to be associated with the biggest match, but they are bound by a code of silence, signing contracts with the players concerned that they won't talk about it before the game gets over.\n\n\"You can say I have gone underground,\" Ganguly told TOI, when he returned to Kolkata a few days back for the festival break. While he would refuse to divulge where he was, it was understood that he, along with Chanda and a couple of others were in Germany with Anand and Aruna (his wife and manager) preparing for the game.\n\nRest of the chess feature involves \"data\" about seconds that is already known. All we can say is get ready for the big chess excitement this year as only 10 days are to go for the World Chess Championship 2013 in Chennai.\n\nFrom Alexandra Kosteniuk's\n\nwww.chessblog.com\n\nAlso see her personal chess blog\n\nat www.chessqueen.com\n\nDon't miss Chess Queen™\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nLabels: Magnus Carlsen, sandipan chanda, surya shekhar ganguly, Viswanathan Anand, world chess championship 2013\n\nEuropean Chess Club Cup 2013: Congratulations to G-Team Novy Bar, Cercle d’Echecs de Monte-Carlo for Winning Open, Women's Sections\n\nChess Blog for Daily Chess News and Trivia (c) Alexandra Kosteniuk, 2013\n\nHello everyone,\n\nG-Team Novy Bor of the Czech Republic has won the European Chess Club Cup 2013.

Chess fans have dubbed the clash as the most anticipated chess event of all time, surpassing even the celebrated Fischer vs Spassky encounter, way back in 1972.\n\n\"PH\" as he is called was Anand's trainer from the 2007 world championships in Mexico to last year's title defence in Moscow. Nielsen then sensationally joined Carlsen's team.\n\nAs befitting the royal game, a gentlemen's agreement means he will sit out this event.\n\nA pawn has not been pushed yet, but can the match live up to the hype? \"Depends\" he says guardedly. \"Chess is like soccer in that sense - a champion's league final can be 0-0, 3-3 or 5-0 even with equal teams. A lot depends on who scores first etc\" Nielsen is regarded as a highly original and deep thinker of the modern game. He places the context of the upcoming match in the broad flow of chess history.\n\nNielsen explains that the Kramnik-Kasparov encounter in 2000 which Kramnik won by grinding down his opponent was where the defence prevailed.\n\nHe thematically links this to Anand's celebrated win over Kramnik in 2008. \" That was to some extent the response and there attack prevailed.\" Nielsen says \"Kasparov would disagree, but there is some point to it\".\n\nSo in this battle between sword and shield, where would Chennai match come in? After all, in public perception, Anand has an inspiring, aggressive style preferring to take the fight into the opponent's camp.\n\nCarlsen is known for his patient, incremental approach, trying to improve his position with every move. The Norwegian waits for mistakes from his opponents and pounces immediately on even the slightest error.\n\nNielsen says, \"Both players are so all-round that what they really care about is the quality of their position. Maybe Magnus prefers longer technical games, and Vishy more dynamic positions, but they would both happily take a position in their opponents socalled terrain, if their position is objectively better\".\n\nCarlsen has also enlisted Kasparov in his campaign. The Russian great will be at hand to dole out expert advice to the Norwegian, who doesn't have any match experience. Nielsen doesn't think this will be crucial.\n\n\"I think the main battlefield by far will be the actual play.\" Nielsen points out that \"comparing with 1972 is difficult.\" There was a \"special political atmosphere\" around the cold war clash which made it memorable.\n\nIn the end, \"the hype was huge, the chess actually nothing spectacular\". Anand and Carlsen have played 29 times, with the Indian winning 6 and losing 3; the rest were drawn. Even in tournaments, fans mark out their games as something special, a gladiatorial contest between two of the greatest players. In that context, 12 back-to-back games promises the ultimate chess feast.

We are flooded with chess features, chess news reports and chess interviews coming in from around the world. Here is a summary of what all is going on:\n\nFirst, of course, we know that hectic work is on by the organisers in Chennai to ensure that all arrangements are the best possible. All details are being taken care of from players' security to playing area seating arrangements. \"Anand and Carlsen will be out of bounds for the public, media before the start of the match. The duo will come in a separate elevator and go straight to the playing area. Their entry and exit points will be barricaded,” according to Fide vice-president DV Sundar.\n\n“Only the chief arbiter and deputy arbiter can access the playing area apart from the players. Hotel staff will be allowed to serve refreshments to the players.\"\n\nThen, there are reports about various Grandmasters commenting on the match. GM Parimarjan Negi says, “Carlsen definitely has the better chance. He is mentally very tough and that is one of his strongest points. The one thing working against him is that everybody expects him to win. His chances of winning are good, but definitely not as high as they are being made out to be. He showed some nerves during the recent Candidates tournament.”\n\nGM Peter Svidler says, \"A lot will depend on how smoothly openings work for Anand as there is only one \"opening master\" in this match. If such an opening balance will be maintained then the match will be interesting and approximately equal. If Magnus has worked precisely on that part and if he manages to \"catch\" Anand in the opening as white, I should say it will be a hard life for Vishy. From the pure playing point of view Magnus is stronger and he has more energy. [...] Nonetheless, Anand is certainly experienced in not only playing the matches but in preparing to them. I guess it won't be easy to fight with his opening preparation. And then anything is possible. Well, we'll see.. It should be interesting!\"\n\nMagnus Carlsen will be accompanied by a Norwegian team that would include a bodyguard. Viswanathan Anand has said, for him, every match is the most important yet.\n\nAlso, the World Chess Championship will be shown in its entirety on the Indian national television channel Doordarshan Sports apart from live broadcast on the official website.\n\nWorld Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand is not too much on social media, but Magnus Carlsen has been tweeting a fortune cookie (that suggests success for him!) and fashion photos as well.\n\nThe first game of this historic world chess championship is barely two weeks away.

SOCAR was challenged by O.R. Padova, while Saint-Petersburg met Peristeri. Certainly the most closely contested matches were PGMB-Rostov (6th seed) – G-Team Novy Bor (5) and Clichy Echecs 92 (9) – Odlar Yurdu (8). Saint-Petersburg conceded only one point and O.R. Padova took 1,5 points from the defending champions. Malachite had no mercy and walked past Tammer-Shakki with 6-0.\n\nG-Team Novy Bor signed an important 4-2 win and GM Nidjat Mamedov saved the day for Odlar Yurdu by equalising the score against the French team. Norwegian GM Simen Agdestein was guest in the press room. He explained that today’s game with GM Alberto David was extremely complicated, that he was very close to winning, but just couldn’t find the right way during the time trouble.\n\nOn the question about his excellent results in recent months he first laughed – “Thanks for asking!” Agdestein said that he “Finally fixed a few things in his life” and thanked WGM Olga Dolzhikova for all the help with organization and the chess school. Now he has more spare time and he can prepare better.\n\nAgdestein confirmed that after brief absence he is back to full-time teaching and playing chess. The ultimate goal is to be in good shape for the 2014 Olympiad in Tromso.\n\nOn the question about football, he said that he is totally out of the game since his career ended due to broken knee. But he praised his students – “Our chess department is very good in football!”\n\n“The World Chess Championship Match in Chennai will be very exciting,” Agdestein said, “It will be a battle of Sportsman against Scientist”.\n\nIn the Women section Hou Yifan brought the first point for Cercle d’Echecs de Monte-Carlo by beating former World Champion Anna Ushenina of Ugra. Humpy Koneru soon followed the suit by forcing Natalija Pogonina to resignation. Pia Cramling later completed the demolition of Ugra for the final 4-0 score.\n\nSHSM Nashe Nasledie took a quick lead against BAS thanks to the win of Russian Champion Valentina Gunina and later completed the match with a convincing 3,5-0,5 victory. Mika Chess Club earned a narrow 2,5-1,5 win against Jelica PEP.\n\nPia Cramling visited the press room to speak with the journalists. On the question about today’s game she said that she equalized quite easily, then got some edge and later only needed some time to find the winning plan in the bishops’ endgame. This is her 7th year in Monte-Carlo and she highlights the excellent team atmosphere.\n\nWhat is her secret of staying on the top level for so long? – She stopped feeling pressure and now only enjoys playing chess.\n\nChief Organizer Nikos Kalesis is pleased with the progress of the tournament. The participants are obviously happy with the hotel and conditions as there hasn’t been a single complaint thus far.\n\nKalesis feels particularly proud that the live transmission of 176(!) games is going smooth and without problems. This is the highest number of broadcasted games in any chess event, except the Olympiads.\n\nFrom Alexandra Kosteniuk's\n\nwww.chessblog.com\n\nAlso see her personal chess blog\n\nat www.chessqueen.com\n\nDon't miss Chess Queen™\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nLabels: european chess club cuup 2013\n\n'Viswanathan Anand Sparked a Chess Revolution in India'\n\nChess Blog for Daily Chess News and Trivia (c) Alexandra Kosteniuk, 2013\n\nHello everyone,\n\nViswanathan Anand winning the World Junior Chess Championship and subsequently earning the GM title is an important landmark not just for Anand but for Indian chess too as it set up a chess revolution in India.

Being the first one to do so was all the more special,” said Manuel Aaron. Years of practice, dedication, sacrifice, travel helped Anand achieve something that was beyond the reach of youngsters at that time.\n\nAlthough India had an IM in Manuel Aaron and several talented players, none could get near the GM norm. “There were quite a few talented players then like TS Ravi and others. Apart from his talent, what helped Anand was opportunities. Anand played many tournaments both within and outside Tamil Nadu. This exposure made him refine his game and his ability to learn (read from books) set him apart. The other players, however talented, could not go up the ladder due to paucity of exposure,” explained Aaron.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Anand in his World Junior match in 1987 defeated Simen Agdestein, who later became Magnus Carlsen’s first coach. Anand scored 9/13 to win the title and defeat Agdestein, the top seed in a crucial match in the middle of the tournament. Simen’s brother Espen Agdestein is now the manager of Carlsen. After that Anand won the Sakthi Finance International Grandmasters tournament and bagged the GM title.\n\nGM RB Ramesh hails Anand’s feat of winning the GM title first and reckons it was an important landmark in Indian chess. “At that time we had only one IM in Manuel Aaron. No one could dream of becoming a GM and it looked like none would get there, for one needed money to go and play abroad. You have to play against and beat foreign players. Taking the cost in mind at that time, one thought becoming a GM was out of bounds,” said Ramesh.\n\n“It is here that Anand like a torchbearer showed us the path and gave us the self belief that we (Indians) too could become GMs. His winning the World Junior title was special and the GM title later was like icing on the cake. It is because of Anand we have 34 GMs in India today. Hats off to Anand,” complimented Ramesh.

The event was organized by the Academy of Chess Education Bhopal, M.P. State Level Chess Association, Sports & Youth Welfare Dept. Govt., on behalf of All India Chess Federation. A total of 272 players competed in the 13-round Swiss open tournament.\n\nInternational Masters Thejkumar M. S. and Ashwin Jayaram tied the first place with 10,5 points each, leaving the nearest followers a full point behind. Debashis Das, who shared third place, completed the requirements for the GM title and becomes first Grandmaster from Odisha state.\n\nTop nine finishers of this Championship qualify for forthcoming National Premier (National ‘A’) Championship. It is curious that only one Grandmaster in the field, Deepan Chakkravarthy, succeeded. (www.chessdom.com)\n\nFinal standings:\n\n1 IM Thejkumar M.
