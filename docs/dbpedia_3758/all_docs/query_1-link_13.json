Meanwhile, Pinky's cousin Dinky arrives who keeps pestering Annika and Gauri to not have blind faith in their husbands.\n\nOn the way, the Oberoi brothers have a chance encounter with Piya, a dance choreographer who drugs them, dances with them and makes a video of it. The next morning, the brothers wake up oblivious of what happened the previous night. They rush back home, only to find that Piya is also at the Oberoi mansion as Dinky's family friend's daughter. It is revealed that Dinky planned this charade.\n\nPiya initially threatens to show this video in public but gradually understands that they are truthful and trustworthy. She steps back but Dinky displays this video in Dadi's birthday party only to realize later that the brothers have earned the trust from their wives truthfully.\n\nThe next morning, Annika requests Shivaay for tamarind according to a diet plan she was planning to follow.

Only to realize later that Annika and Shivaay haven't consummated their relationship yet. After which they plan to consummate and succeed.\n\nAbhay returns with the claims of being another Oberoi brother. He also brings Svetlana into the Oberoi mansion claiming to be her husband. Meanwhile, Rudra still assumes Bhavya is married to Manav, berates her for one last time and fires her from the job only to realize that she was never married to Manav. Later Svetlana blackmails Shivaay into transferring Rudra and Omkara's property to her.\n\nThis leads to misunderstandings between Tej and Shivaay, resulting in Shivaay and Annika leaving the Oberoi mansion and going for their \"Vanvas\". They leave for Goa, while the Oberoi family and mansion are split in two. In Goa, they meet Veer Pratap Chauhan, their new neighbor, who turns out to be planted by Svetlana to seek revenge on Annika. He tries to prove Annika mad so that Shivaay would leave her and he would save Annika.\n\nFailed, he then tries to kill Shivaay. Meanwhile, Shivaay and Soumya bring Bhavya and Rudra face-to-face in his house in Goa one last time before Bhavya leaves for abroad, where Rudra confesses his true feelings to her and proposes marriage to her.\n\nWhile Rudra plans to marry in Goa with Shivaay, Tej performs Gauri's last rites as she fails to obey his orders. Disheartened, Gauri and Omkara also arrive at Shivaay's house in Goa. Happily, the three Oberoi brothers and their wives with grandmother's blessings perform Rudra and Bhavya's pre-wedding rituals. Soumya reveals to Veer that she is the younger sister of Svetlana and Tia and now she wants to marry Rudra. She joins forces with Veer.\n\nVeer tricks Tej into signing the house deeds to be auctioned, from which Shivaay saves them. At same time he exposes Svetlana and again lives in the Oberoi mansion as everybody blames Tej of the troubles and he leaves.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Annika figures out that Veer is not what he seems to be and tries to warn Shivaay but, that night Shivaay shoots Annika dead. Panicked and guilt stricken, he unknowingly takes help from Veer.\n\nThe next day Shivaay keeps a press conference where somebody plays the leaked video of Shivaay shooting Annika. As Shivaay is about to be arrested a police inspector brings a woman into the house with looks exactly like Annika.\n\nShivaay refuses to believe their claims as he knows that he had killed her and tests her in many ways which surprisingly she passes.\n\nLater that day Veer and Shivaay return to the place where they had buried Annika and find the real Annika in the coffin.
