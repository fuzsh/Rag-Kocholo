        "text": "Peet’s Coffee and Tea, founded in 1966 in Berkeley, California by Alfred Peet, is rumored to be the “grandfather of specialty coffee.” According to SeattlePi, “With his emphasis on specialty coffees and unique brewing techniques, Peet, the son of a Dutch roaster, put specialty coffee on the map — and in the process influenced the founders of Starbucks.”\n\nAlfred Peet was born in the Netherlands on March 10th, 1922. Peet was the son of a small coffee roaster, so from a very early age, coffee was immersed into his life, fueling his passion. Following the end of World War II, Peet left London, where he had apprenticed with a coffee and tea company, and worked as a tea taster in the Dutch East Indies and New Zealand, before deciding to move to San Francisco in 1955 where he worked in the coffee importing industry.\n\nRumored to be disgusted by what Americans considered suitable coffee, Peet opened the first Peet’s Coffee and Tea on April 1st, 1966, Berkeley California, on the Corner of Vine and Walnut Street.\n\nWhat set Peet’s apart and sparked a revolution was the manner in which he roasted his beans, using cheaper-end robusta and arabica, and mixing the blends together. The taste was phenomenal, and by 1969, Peet’s was a gathering for coffee devotees, called “Peetniks.”\n\nToday, Peet’s Coffee and Tea are located in California, Colorado, Illonois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Colombia. Peet’s products can also be purchased in grocery stores and other retailers.\n\nAccording to the Peet’s website, their top selling blend is Major Dickason’s Blend. “A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army officer Key Dickason brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn’t enough — Dickason’s rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major.”\n\nThis blend is a personal favorite of mine. I brew a cup in using my Keurig, and add a touch of Almond syrup with whip cream, an almond melange. The bold rich body of the coffee pairs well with the sweetness of the almond syrup, creating a smooth, rich taste that is full of liveliness."
