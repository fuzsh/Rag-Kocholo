        "text": "Career\n\nHe is most famous for introducing custom coffee roasting to the United States. After becoming dismayed at the poor quality of coffee in the United States (according to Peet, the reason that the quality of coffee was so bad in the United States of America is that people were still drinking World World War II style \"rationed\" coffee ), he opened his own coffee store in Berkeley, California, in 1966, and soon opened new stores in Oakland, Mill Valley and Menlo Park. Peet taught his style of roasting beans to Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker, who took the technique to Seattle and founded Starbucks in 1971.\n\nPeet is widely credited with starting the specialty coffee revolution in the United States. Among coffee historians, Peet is labeled as \"the Dutchman who taught America how to drink coffee.\"\n\nAn interview with Alfred Peet is included in the documentary \"Coffee Culture United States of America\" released in 2008.\n\nAfter retiring from the coffee business, Peet moved in 2001 to Ashland, Oregon, where he died on August 29, 2007, at age 87."
