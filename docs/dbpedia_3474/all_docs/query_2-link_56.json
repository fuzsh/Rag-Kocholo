It would take a book (or several) to tell you about all of them, so here are just a few of our favorite coffee history highlights!\n\nWe Have Goats to Thank\n\nCoffee was first discovered in the mountains of Ethiopia in 850 AD by...goats! As legend has it, one day a young goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats were acting strange—usually calm, they were dancing and jumping around. At first he thought they were possessed. Then he discovered that the goats had been eating some unfamiliar red berries. Taking a risk, Kaldi tried the berries (that were actually coffee cherries) and soon had as much energy as his goats!\n\nA Unique Farming Method\n\nEthiopians eventually brought coffee to Yemen. Much of the terrain in Yemen is mountainous, so farms were often set up on terraces built into the hillside—they're practical and beautiful! Some of the terraces have been around since 3000 BC! Coffee began to spread outside of Yemen around 1650 AD.\n\nCoffee Says \"Bonjour!\" to France\n\nAfter coffee had spread throughout Southern India, Indonesia, and to the Netherlands, it arrived in France—at Versailles! In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam gifted Louis XIV a young coffee plant that went straight to the Potager du roi, aka \"King's Vegetable Garden.\" Under the garden's supervisor Francois Le Normand, 12 coffee plants were cultivated to 13 ft in height!\n\nNo More Green Beans"
