Peet, the son of a Dutch coffee merchant who pioneered a revolution in roasting exotic dark beans that led to America’s love affair with high-end coffee, died Wednesday at his home in Ashland, Ore. He was 87.\n\nThe cause was cancer, several friends said. His death was announced Friday by a representative of the company he founded, Peet’s Coffee and Tea Inc.\n\nPeet, often called the “grandfather of specialty coffee,” started his business in Berkeley, Calif., in 1966, with a single retail coffee bean outlet that blossomed into a public company with 150 stores in 10 states.\n\nHe is credited with mentoring and inspiring a generation of coffee entrepreneurs, including the founders of Starbucks.\n\n“He was the guru of everyone in the gourmet coffee revolution,” said Corby Kummer, author of “The Joy of Coffee” and a senior editor at the Atlantic Monthly. “He was the big bang. It all started with him.”\n\nThe first Peet’s retail shop served as an anchor for a culinary corridor that would later be called the Gourmet Ghetto, a quaint commercial area in North Berkeley that gained fame with the opening of Chez Panisse, the restaurant owned by the chef Alice Waters, and specialty food boutiques like the Cheeseboard and Cocolat.\n\n“Everybody was drinking coffee that came out of a can,” said Waters, who credits Peet with introducing her to quality coffee. “But Alfred was a purist rooted in the European tradition. He taught us a new way to look at food, wine and coffee – paying attention to the preparation, the ritual – and understanding how the beans and ingredients were grown.”\n\nStarbucks owes much of its success to Peet, who trained the company founders and supplied Starbucks with its coffee blends when it first opened in 1971.\n\n“He generously shared with us how to cup, to roast and to blend, and instilled his uncompromising standards,” said Jerry Baldwin, a co-founder of Starbucks. “I’ll always be in his debt.”\n\nKummer, the “Joy of Coffee” author, said Peet would be remembered for introducing Americans to high-quality dark roast coffee blends while teaching them to appreciate varieties from every corner of the world.\n\n“His influence cannot be underestimated,” Kummer said. “The way Americans think about coffee and drink coffee are a direct result of his teachings.”\n\nHans Ruesch, 94, writer, racer\n\nHans Ruesch, a successful Swiss racecar driver in the years before World War II who later became a writer of well-received novels of adventure, two of which became Hollywood films, died Aug. 27 at his home in Lugano, Switzerland. He was 94.\n\nThe cause was cancer, his daughter, Vivian Ruesch Mellon, said.\n\nRuesch was believed to have been one of the last living drivers from the glamorous, dangerous days of European Grand Prix racing in the 1920s and ’30s. His novels include “Top of the World” (Harper, 1950), about Eskimo life; “The Racer” (Ballantine, 1953); and “South of the Heart: A Novel of Modern Arabia” (Coward-McCann, 1957).\n\nReviewing “Top of the World” in the New York Times Book Review, Max Eastman called Ruesch “a born storyteller” and the novel “a brilliant feat of poetic imagination.”\n\nThe book became a movie, “The Savage Innocents,” released in the United States in 1961. Directed by Nicholas Ray, it starred Anthony Quinn as the head of an Inuit family. Ruesch’s novel “The Racer” was released as the film “The Racers” in 1955. Directed by Henry Hathaway, it starred Kirk Douglas as a Formula One driver in Europe.\n\nEdward McGaffigan,\n\nnuclear regulator\n\nEdward McGaffigan Jr., the longest serving member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, died after a lengthy battle with a particularly dangerous form of skin cancer. He was 58.\n\nMcGaffigan died Sunday of metastatic melanoma at the Capital Hospice in Arlington, Va.\n\nA native of Boston and one of two Democrats on the commission, McGaffigan was appointed to the NRC, which regulates the nuclear industry, in 1996 and again in 2000 by President Bill Clinton. President Bush nominated him for a third term in 2005.\n\nMcGaffigan’s death reduced the five-member commission to three members. One seat has been vacant since the departure of Commissioner Jeffrey Merrifield earlier this year.\n\nNot known for being shy, McGaffigan often bluntly challenged his agency’s critics, accusing some of fear mongering in their criticism of the NRC’s oversight of the nuclear power industry and industry safety.\n\nJudah Nadich, WWII chaplain\n\nRabbi Judah Nadich, a military chaplain who advised Gen. Dwight Eisenhower on Jewish affairs after the discovery of Nazi concentration camps in the last months of World War II, has died. He was 95.\n\nHis grandson, Natan Meir, said Nadich died of a heart attack at his Manhattan home on Aug. 26.\n\nIn addition to his military service, Nadich was noted as an early supporter of the civil rights movement and as an advocate of equality for women in Jewish religious ceremony, including their ordination as rabbis.\n\nHe was the Army’s senior Jewish chaplain in Europe in April 1945 as advancing American and British forces liberated Nazi concentration camps in Germany. Eisenhower, the commander of Allied forces in Western Europe, named Nadich to advise how to cope with hundreds of thousands of displaced people being kept in military custody in squalid conditions little better than the camps they had survived.\n\n– New York Times, Associated Press\n\nOriginally Published: September 3, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
