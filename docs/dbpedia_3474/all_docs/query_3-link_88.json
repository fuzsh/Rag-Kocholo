        "text": "Alfred Peet, a man from Holland who had grown up in the coffee trade in Europe, moved to America after World War II. He was shocked at what Americans called coffee and decided to open a coffee shop in Berkeley, California. His coffee was made in small batches and used fresh beans of superior quality, creating a coffee that was rich and complex. This style of coffee was unlike anything Americans had tasted before.\n\nSource: It all began on Vine Street (n.d.). Peets.com."
