        "text": "Peet's Coffee is a San Francisco based specialty coffee roaster and retailer. Founded in 1966 by Alfred Peet in Berkeley, CA, Peet's introduced the United States to its darker roasted Arabica coffee in blends including French Roast and grades appropriate for espresso drinks. Peet's offers freshly roasted beans, brewed coffee and espresso beverages, as well as bottled cold brew and kombucha. In 2007, Peet's opened the first LEED Gold Certified roastery in the United States. Peet’s Coffee is still known for being the “Original Craft Coffee” and Alfred Peet is credited with starting the specialty coffee revolution in the US. Today, we still do things the way Alfred Peet did by maintaining our long-standing , direct-trade relationships resulting in the highest quality premium beans. Our 12 experts roasters roast to taste and taste to roast, never by computer. Our beans are hand roasted in small batches daily, roughly 200,000 pounds per day. Every batch is roasted to order and shipped.\n\nFor Peet’s, Social Responsibility starts at origin, where we go beyond Fair Trade prices and certifications to build direct long-term relationships that improve both quality of coffee and quality of life. We partner with Enveritas, a non-profit organization that focuses on working with farmers who lack access to existing supply chain certification or verification options to improve farming practices and are on track to have 100% verified by 2020. Our LEED (R) Gold-certified roasting plant equals Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design."
