        "text": "Time has an impact on every single person but it has been poorly studied by western intellectuals; especially philosophers and scientists. As Newton knew (and Einstein eventually realized): physics, as the study of material reality, is about Time, so this connection is reviewed here (without mathematics). Major attention is focused on the role of philosophy and even more on the bad uses of language (developed by the Great Greeks) that fails to expose the poor assumptions about Time and its critical role in relationships, especially between humans. Again, bad language (which concentrates on timeless nouns instead of time-oriented verbs, produced the illusion that Time could be understood via objective thinking (using static concepts) when our broad understanding is constructed on experiential intuition. SUMMARY This essay explores the vast range of human thinking about the difficult subject of Time. It begins with attempts to put this concept on a scientific or objective basis but concludes with human psychology, in particular, the critical facility of human memory. The overall framework is to adopt a philosophical view, as this is how most thinkers have approached the problem of the nature of Time. There is also a discussion of the history of ideas of Time across several civilizations and includes a critical analysis of how modern physics views Time, which is not as comprehensive as many think. The conclusion is that Time is NOT an illusion; it is all about Activity and that's the secret of living: doing, the quality actions in life, especially building relationships; substituting numerical views of life (or Time) is a complete waste of time. We show how metaphors are so important in abstract thinking.\n\nIn November 1915 Freud wrote one of his most beautiful, albeit extremely short, texts: ‘On Transience’. This text, consisting of a dialogue between Freud and a poet whom we now know was Rilke, is a rumination on the meaning and implications of transience in our life: does transience rob life of its value and meaning, or does it add to that value? In this article I explore the reflection on the passing of time that ‘On Transience’ suggests: how the passing of time interacts with our attribution of meaningfulness and shapes our approach to life. The article also deals with the tension between repetitiveness and the uniqueness or specificity of objects within time, and explores the question of the persistence of value, especially literary value, in the face of time and transience, and the link between death and literary creation. Finally, the article refers to the immediate historical context of this reflection on the ephemeral, namely the destruction brought about by war.\n\nThis paper analyzes Body Clock: Poems 2 in the perspective of Julia Kristeva's Desire in Language A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art. It explicitly sheds light on Eleni Sikelianos's poems in Body Clock with two different theorists such as Kristeva and Egan. Eleni Sikelianos' (1965-) both visual and verbal narrative style attribute an authentic outlook for readers, and they see the power of her performative style. The process of giving birth is narrated so creatively that when people read her poems, they will understand how life is a meaningful thing. The study will start with the life of Eleni Sikelianos, who is the author of Body Clock which reveals the idea of birth, womanhood, imaginative mind, and so on. Secondly, Body Clock is explained with its main concepts such as time, biology, motherhood including the growth of body and birth, and her drawings. The third part of the study will examine the poems of Body Clock from the perspective of Julia Kristeva's Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art. This analysis will concern four theoretical backgrounds: \"the speaking/ split subject,\" \"semiotic chora & symbolic device,\" \"maternal body/ drive,\" and \"poetic language/carnivalesque.\" In the fourth section of the paper, Body Clock is analyzed in terms of three concepts such as the mirror conception, body status and language in control of meaning in Mirror Talk: Genres of Crisis in Contemporary Autobiography written by Susanna Egan."
