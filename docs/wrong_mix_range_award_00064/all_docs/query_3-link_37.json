        "text": "Piazza Carducci owes its name to the house where the homonymous poet lived.\n\nOne side of the square is partly occupied by the monument dedicated to him, on which stands the statue of the poet in a frowning attitude, surrounded by his works represented in the form of full-bodied girls. Today the square, in addition to hosting the Casa Carducci Museum, is also home to the Museum of the Risorgimento.\n\nThe square dedicated to the great poet and his house, today a museum where books, letters and memorabilia are still kept, and the Museum of the Risorgimento. One of the few squares in the center where children still manage to play football and there is no shortage of benches.\n\nThe former church of Santa Maria del Piombo was Carducci's home and the space facing it, once occupied by the gardens of the convents of Santa Cristina della Fondazza and the Discalced Carmelite Nuns of via Santo Stefano, was named after the poet twenty-three years after his death .\n\nThe first name of the square, however, was Piazza Francesco Crispi and was changed to Piazza Giosuè Carducci only after an explicit request from the Deputation of National History.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1907 Giosuè Carducci chose an ancient deconsecrated church as his residence, which has now become a museum in which books, letters and relics left by the poet are still preserved.\n\nCarducci was the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize for literature, as well as the first Italian ever, together with Camillo Golgi, to win this prize in 1906.\n\nPosca was a refreshing drink from ancient Rome. The name only recalls the everyday life of this wine and not its ancient composition. Obtained from white grapes, it is the result of monthly topping up of a perpetual tank begun in 2011, with younger wine. Obtained from spontaneous fermentations, it is neither clarified nor filtered. The nose highlights the aromas of elderberry, white peach and gooseberry. The sip is very fresh, mineral with an overwhelming drinkability.\n\nIt is a unique and inimitable wine, the synthesis of the terroir for a constantly evolving sip.\n\nOrsi Vigneto San Vito is located on the Colli Bolognesi, in Valsamoggia.\n\nThis is an area historically suitable for viticulture: to fully respect this vocation, and to produce wines that are an authentic expression of this terroir, the winery practices agriculture capable of revitalizing the land, stimulating the plants and producing fruits with a strong link with the territory.\n\nThe fermentations are spontaneous without the use of selected yeasts, and no clarification or filtration is carried out on the wines. This is not a profession of faith or a marketing strategy, but a choice of taste: Orsi Vigneto San Vito wants wines with a distinguishable personality, which vary from year to year, not standardised.\n\n\"Everyone remembers things in their own way, everyone tells their own story a little. I was frank. With this book of statements perhaps my version will be better understood... Reality, if you look closely, is hard, not always right, but I take it as a challenge and I always say: let's go and see to the end. This is what makes us men, to go ahead despite everything, even if the reality around you sucks. My father was a socialist and not be sided in those years with the communists or the priests did not pay off, in Zocca. In the theater commune of Bologna I discovered Bakunin and the anarchists. Not those who place bombs, but better men, free, so responsible that there is no longer any need for one I'll tell you the rules. I'm not Vasco Rossi. I'm a person, I'm a man, not an invulnerable hero like Achilles. Where you hit me I bleed, Vasco Rossi no, he doesn't feel anything.\"\n\nOn each page you feel the sweat and effort, tears and blood, never experienced as burdens, but always as profound values.\n\nVasco Rossi, also known simply as Vasco and in the past with the name Blasco (Zocca, February 7, 1952), is an Italian singer-songwriter.\n\nSelf-defined \"provocatore\" is considered one of the greatest exponents of Italian rock music. Since the beginning of his career in 1977, he has released 34 albums.\n\nIn the eighties, the unregulated lifestyle characterized by alcohol, drugs, women and continuous frenetic tours, brought Vasco Rossi closer to the stereotype of the rock star, who became, over time, a true icon."
