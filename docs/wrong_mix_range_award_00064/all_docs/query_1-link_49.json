        "text": "Before knowing about the history of Italy, lets see some facts related to Italy:\n\nCapital :- Rome\n\nOfficial name:- Republic of Italy\n\nAnthem :- Il Canto degli italian\n\nGovernment :- Unitary Parliamentary Constitutional Republic.\n\nPresident :- Giorgio Napolitano\n\nPrime Minister :- Enrico Letta\n\nUnification :- 17 March 1861\n\nRepublic :- 2 June 1946\n\nCurrency :- Euro\n\nNational Animal :- Italian Wolf\n\nBorders :\n\nNorth :- France, Switzerland, Austria , and Solvenia.\n\nSouth :- Italian Peninsula, Sicily, Sardinia.\n\nEnclaves in Italy :- Sovereign states of San Marino and The Vatican City.\n\nExcl-ave in Switzerland :- Campione d‚ÄôItalia\n\nItaly was the founding member of European Union in 1993. Italy is the member state of :-\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, G8, G20, NATO, Council Of Europe and The United Nations.\n\n‚óò HISTORY\n\nThe term Italia , from Latin Italia, was borrowed through Greek from the Oscan Viteliu meaning ‚ÄúLand of Young Cattle‚Äù. Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italics , mentioned also by Aristotle and Thucydides.\n\nRome , a modest agricultural community , conventionally founded in 753 BC. According to legend , Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus in the heart o Etruscan Italy in 735 BC. Over the next several centuries , Rome expanded its its territories into what became known as The Roman Empire. The Romans named the Italian peninsula Italia.\n\n‚óò THE MIDDLE AGE ( 6th to 14th CENTURY).\n\nA brief history of Italy in the middle ages begins with a series of invasion . In 493 the Ostrogoth‚Äôs, an eastern Germanic tribe conquered the Italian Peninsula. The resulting Gothic war led to the Lombard‚Äôs , another Germanic tribe , establishing a kingdom in northern Italy and three regions in the south in 568. In 756 French defeated Lombard‚Äôs and granted the popes authority over central Italy and Papal states ere created.\n\n‚óò THE RENAISSANCE (14th to 16th CENTURY).\n\nAt this point, the disparity among the regions were extreme. In contrast to the prosperous northern states , central and southern Italy were economically depressed. The Papacy temporarily relocated to Avignon in France, returning to Rome in 1478. Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were controlled by foreign powers.\n\n‚óò FOREIGN RULE (1559 to 1814).\n\nOnce again in this history of Italy, a golden era is followed by a dark one. In 1494 France invaded northern Italy collapsed . In 1527 Spain and Germany attacked Rome. By the end of the ‚ÄúItalian wars in 1559, three Italian republics regained their independence- Piedmont savoy, Corsica were later sold to France- Cosica in 1764 and Savoy in 1860. By 1559 Spain controlled Milan, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia and southern Tuscan‚Äôs. It lasted until 1713. During the Napoleonic Era (1796 to 1814), Italy was briefly unite by Napoleon as the Italian republic and later the Kingdom of Italy, becoming a client state of French Republic.\n\nAfter the death of Napoleonic , in 1814, the congress of Vienna divided Italy in eight parts, most under foreign rule: Parma, Modena and Tuscan‚Äôs by Hapsburg‚Äôs, Lombard‚Äôs and Veneto were ruled by Austria, Piedmont , Sardinia, Genoa and the Papal states were independent.\n\n‚óò UNIFICATION (1814-1861).\n\nThe movement began in 1815 with a growing resentment towards the peninsula‚Äôs domination by Austria. Two prominent figures in the unification movement were Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\nMazzini was imprisoned in 1830 for his role in carbonian secret society. He mounted unsuccessful uprisings in Italy, but worked with Garibaldi with a dream of unification. He died in 1872.\n\nItaly was officially unified in 1861.\n\nAfter two world wars and dictatorship of Benito Mussolini , a popular mandate declared Italy a republic in 1946.\n\n(Source :- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy , http://lavezzi.org/5.html , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Italy , http://www.italianlegacy.com/brief-history-of-italy.html , )\n\nThe monuments of italy, thanks to the different civilizations that have left deep marks of their existence in different cities of italy üôÇ .

Basketball, Volleyball, and Cycling are the next most popular/played sports, with Italy having a rich tradition in all three.\n\n‚óò FOOTBALL\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Italy.

There are many national and international events every year.\n\nCinema of Italy\n\nThe Cinema of Italy comprises the films made within Italy, or by Italian directors. Since the development of the Italian film industry in the early 1900s, Italian filmmakers and performers have, at times, experienced both domestic and international success, and have influenced film movements throughout the world. As of 2013, Italian films have won 13 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the most of any country, as well as 12 Palmes d‚ÄôOr, the second-most of any country.\n\nEarly Italian films were typically adaptations of books or stage plays. By the 1910s, Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs, lavish costumes, and record budgets, to produce pioneering films such as Enrico Guazzoni‚Äòs Quo Vadis (1912) and Giovanni Pastrone‚Äòs Cabiria (1914). One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements, Italian Futurism, took place in Italy in the late 1910s. After a period of decline in the 1920s, the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film. A popular Italian genre during this period, the Telefoni Bianchi, consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds.[1]\n\nWhile Italy‚Äôs Fascist government provided financial support for the nation‚Äôs film industry, most notably the construction of the Cinecitt√† studios, it also engaged in censorship, and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films. Post-World War II Italy saw the rise of the influential Italian neorealist movement, which launched the directorial careers of Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, and Vittorio De Sica. Neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favor of lighter films, such as those of the Commedia all‚Äôitaliana genre. Actresses such as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period.[1]\n\nThe Spaghetti Western achieved popularity in the mid-1960s, peaking with Sergio Leone‚Äòs Dollars Trilogy, which featured enigmatic scores by composer Ennio Morricone. Erotic Italian thrillers, or giallos, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced the horror genre worldwide. During the 1980s and 1990s, directors such as Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Roberto Benigni brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema.\n\nHere are top 10 italian movies :-\n\n1. La Strada\n\nItalian film is unthinkable without Federico Fellini, and this heartbreaking classic about a poor girl who is taken away by a cruel strongman to become a circus performer is impossible to resist. With wonderful performances by Anthony Quinn and Giulietta Masina. For more early Fellini, check out Nights of Cabiria, also with Masina.\n\n2. Umberto D.\n\nVittorio De Sica‚Äôs 1952 neo-realist film about an old man who is stripped of his dignity is sad but not sentimental. We prefer it to The Bicycle Thief.\n\n3. 1900\n\nBernardo Bertolucci‚Äôs epic history about a peasant and a land owner over the course of the first half of the century stars Robert De Niro and Gerard Depardieu. If you don‚Äôt have the time (1900 is over five hours long), try The Conformist.\n\n4. The Battle of Algiers\n\nGillo Pontecorvo‚Äôs legendary re-telling of the struggle for Algerian independence from France is a timelessly powerful film.\n\n4. The Battle of Algiers\n\nGillo Pontecorvo‚Äôs legendary re-telling of the struggle for Algerian independence from France is a timelessly powerful film.\n\n5. The Best of Youth\n\nThis sprawling and all engrossing drama by Marco Tullio Giordana, the most recent film on this list, follows two brothers from the 1960s to the present. The film was first screened in Italy on television and in the U.S. as two films at three hours each. The times flies by.\n\n6. La Dolce Vita\n\nYet another masterpiece by Federico Fellini, La Dolce Vita features Marcello Mastroianni as the original Paparazzo who chases Anita Ekberg through the streets of room and right into the Fontana di Trevi.\n\n7. Open City\n\nRoberto Rossellini‚Äôs landmark film portrays the struggle of Rome‚Äôs citizens during the final days of World War II.\n\n8. L‚ÄôAvventura\n\nMonica Vitti plays a woman searching for a missing friend in the Mediterranean in Michelangelo Antonioni‚Äôs breakthrough film.\n\n9. The Leopard\n\nBurt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon star in an epic story of elegiac grace in Luchino Visconti‚Äôs Sicilian tale of revolution and decline.\n\n10. Cinema Paradiso\n\nGiuseppe Tornatore‚Äôs sentimental love letter to the movies is a film we love to hate, but we cannot ignore it.\n\nHere are few oscar wining Italian movies and awrd wining actors :-\n\nToday and Tomorrow, Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,Amacord, Cinema Paradiso, Mediterraneo and Life Is Beautiful. Additionally, Oscars were won by The\n\nBicycle Thief, Shoeshine, and Seven Beauties. And there are Italian film that won other awards: Two\n\nWomen (Best Actress), La Dolce Vita (Costumes), Divorce- Italian Style (Original Screenplay) and Il\n\nPostino (Original Score).\n\nThe Nobel prize has been awarded 853 times, of which 23 awards were to organizations.\n\nThere are 20 novel prize winners from Italy in different fields. They are :-\n\nMario Capecchi*, Physiology or Medicine, 2007\n\nRiccardo Giacconi*, Physics, 2002\n\nDario Fo, Literature, 1997\n\nRita Levi-Montalcini, Physiology or Medicine, 1986\n\nFranco Modigliani, Economics, 1985\n\nCarlo Rubbia, Physics, 1984\n\nRenato Dulbecco*, Physiology or Medicine, 1975\n\nEugenio Montale, Literature, 1975\n\nSalvador Luria*, Physiology or Medicine, 1969\n\nGiulio Natta, Chemistry, 1963\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo, Literature, 1959\n\nEmilio G. Segr√®, Physics, 1959\n\nDaniel Bovet, born in Switzerland, Physiology or Medicine, 1957\n\nEnrico Fermi, Physics, 1938\n\nLuigi Pirandello, Literature, 1934\n\nGrazia Deledda, Literature, 1926\n\nGuglielmo Marconi, Physics, 1909\n\nErnesto Teodoro Moneta, Peace, 1907\n\nGiosu√® Carducci, Literature, 1906\n\nCamillo Golgi, Physiology or Medicine, 1906\n\nBut among these novelist 6 novelist are more famous :-\n\nGiosu√© Carducci (Awarded in 1906)\n\nThe first Italian to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature was the poet Giosu√© Carducci in 1906, the so-called poeta vate, whose energetic verse was combined with the use of personal and collective reminiscences. He was considered the heir to a national and patriotic lyrical tradition that had been prevalent for centuries in Italy; the end of this widespread sensibility was embodied in Carducci‚Äôs poems. The following year, the Nobel Prize for Literature was received by Rudyard Kipling whose vivid energy was not so different from Carducci‚Äôs. The ideals of patriotism and national identity, evident throughout Carducci‚Äôs works, were a recurrent European intellectual theme at the beginning of the Twentieth century.\n\nGrazia Deledda (Awarded in 1926)\n\nIn contrast to Carducci‚Äôs nationalism, Grazia Deledda embodied a regional literary tradition, originating from Sardinia; her writing was a reflection of her native land‚Äôs sense of individuality and distinctiveness. Deledda‚Äôs narratives enthrall the reader, being the product of an imaginative mind and great sense of humanity. Her female presence in the Italian pantheon revealed to the peninsula a poignant awareness of the diversity of the Italian character in literature. D. H. Lawrence was attracted by Deledda‚Äôs emotional use of nature and human psychology, in which he found a major commitment to her island, Sardinia.\n\nLuigi Pirandello (Awarded in 1934)\n\nLuigi Pirandello was a playwright who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1934. The theatre of Luigi Pirandello had to resist the rise and decline of Fascism and therefore had to adopt a subtle language made of absurd and ironic sentences to escape the tragedies of the two World Wars. His great contribution to European literature was not limited to his theatre, since Pirandello also wrote a number of brilliant essays on literature, above all about the humoristic tradition of which he felt he was a part. His relationship with Mussolini‚Äôs government, whose largesse he occasionally profited from, came under scrutiny following death in 1936. However the ambiguity of his works prohibits any attempts to paint him as a Fascist.\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo (Awarded in 1959)\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo refined and re-wrote the classical canon and therefore reinvigorated it, placing it at the heart of Italian cultural life once again. One of his finest works, his translations from Greek poetry, contributed to shaping his poetic language. Quasimodo‚Äôs poems, some of them translated in English in the collection The Night Fountain, show his reluctance to abandon his sense of belonging to a ‚Äòprimitive Mediterranean‚Äô, and his internal, laconic rejection of the world of the European Belles Lettres. His works indebted as they were to mythology and religion, were perceived to be evidence of a regressive trend in Italian Literature.\n\nEugenio Montale (Awarded in 1975)\n\nWhereas Quasimodo embraced Italian lyricism, others struggled with its indifference to issues of the present day. Eugenio Montale rejected much of what was considered ‚ÄòItalian lyricism‚Äô and, through his sophisticated poetical ear, strenuously re-built the rhythm and language of Italian poetry introducing his own bitter and disenchanted images. His poetic influence can be also, and above all, to be found in other poets, both within and outside the Italian scene. In 1987 the Russian poet, Joseph Brodsky, during his Nobel Prize speech, declared that all twentieth century poetry was truly inspired by Montale. Beyond all national tribute, Montale‚Äôs influence on such a wide range of international poets still stands as an impressive legacy.\n\nDario Fo (Awarded in 1997)\n\nThe playwright Dario Fo, like Deledda, offered a regional approach to conceptions of Italian prose. His use of dialects and legends, mainly from the north of Italy, together with his corrosive irony, disentangled Italy from the common stereotype of the provincial art. Fo‚Äôs Mistero Buffo, his most important theatrical success, has reformed Italian theatre from its roots; although his political and intellectual sharpness mostly defines his monologues and dialogues, Fo‚Äôs greatness stands in his sense of closeness to the oppressed and marginalized in Italian history and politics.\n\nSource :- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country, theculturetrip.com/europe/italy/articles/six-italian-nobel-prize-winners-in-search-of-a-national-identity/)"
