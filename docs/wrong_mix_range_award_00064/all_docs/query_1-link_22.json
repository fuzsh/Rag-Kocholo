        "text": "Alfred Nobel\n\nChemist, Inventor, Awesome Administrator, Social Reformer.\n\n\"It could and should soon come to pass that all states pledge themselves collectively to attack an aggressor. That would make war impossible, and would force even the most brutal and unreasonable Power to appeal to a court of arbitration, or else keep quiet.\"\n\nHealth\n\nPaul C. Lauterbur Ph.D.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2003\n\nNobel Co-recipient Sir Peter Mansfield\n\nThe President's National Medal of Science - Physical Sciences 1987\n\nThe National Medal of Technology and Innovation 1988\n\nChemist. Magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\"Every great idea in history has the red stamp of rejection on its face. If you scratch any innovation's surface, you'll find the scars: they've been roughed up and thrashed around by the masses and the leading minds before they made it into your life.\"\n\nHealth\n\nGeorge Wells Beadle Ph.D.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1958\n\nCo-Nobelists Edward Tatum, Joshua Lederberg\n\nBiochemical Geneticist. Discovered that genes act by regulating definite chemical events. Brought era of classical genetics to a close and launched molecular age.\n\n\"It was a time when one went to work in the morning wondering what new excitement the day would bring.\" - Colleague and biographer Norman H. Horowitz.\n\nHealth\n\nFritz A. Lipmann M.D.,Ph.D.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1953\n\nCo-Nobelist Hans Krebs\n\nNational Medal of Science - Biological Sciences 1966\n\nPhysician, Biochemist. Discovered co-enzyme A, its importance for intermediary metabolism. Identified serine phosphate as constituent of phosphoproteins which contain phosphate. CMP represents metabolically active carbamyl donor.\n\nLiljestrand, Science Academy: â€¦Regarding fundamental discoveries laymen ask for immediate practical application. Counter question of Benjamin Franklin: Of what use is a new-born baby?\n\nHealth\n\nKlas Pontus Arnoldson\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize 1908\n\nNobel Co-recipient Fredrik Bajer\n\nParliamentarian, writer. Founder, Swedish Peace and Arbitration League. Inspiring orator.\n\nWithout peace there is no freedom, individual or national. War and hostilities are a form of slavery. Under such conditions, laws are silent. Without peace there is nothing truly human. Peace is harmony. Harmony is the highest ideal of life.\n\nHealth"
