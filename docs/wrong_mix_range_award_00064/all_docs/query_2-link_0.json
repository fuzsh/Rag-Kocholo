After graduating from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, he began teaching. In 1860, he was appointed the chair of Italian literature at the University of Bologna, where he lectured for more than 40 years. He was a popular lecturer and a literary and social critic who led an active political life. He was elected to the Senate in 1890.\n\nWork\n\nInspired both by his own time as well as his study of the classical and Italian poets, Carducci began writing poetry when he was a child. His first collection of poetry was Rime (1857). He was an atheist whose criticism of Christianity is most prominently showcased in the provocative poem “Hymn to Satan” (published in 1865).\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: Giosuè Carducci – Facts.
