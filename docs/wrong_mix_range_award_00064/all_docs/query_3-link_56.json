        "text": "In the Fog\n\nAnd I looked down at the land below.\n\nGone, all of it, drowned. Poured into a long,\n\nflat, sweep of gray, a sea without waves or shore.\n\nAnd piercing the air though just barely there,\n\nthe strange sound of small fierce cries: birds,\n\nfloundering, scared, in that groundless world.\n\nAnd high in the sky, the bones of the beech trees\n\nbobbed their lean skeleton selves. And beside them\n\nthe dreams of ruins, and of hermits' retreats.\n\nAnd a dog barked and barked, but from where\n\nwasn't clear, maybe next to the footsteps I thought\n\nI could hear, steps neither far nor near;\n\necho of steps, neither spry nor slow, endless\n\nand forward and back. I looked below: nothing,\n\nthough, and no one, that you, my eyes, could see.\n\nThe dreams of the ruins wondered: will he\n\nnot come or be gone? The skeleton branches\n\nwondered: And you, who continue on?\n\nAnd maybe I saw a shadow, a straying shade\n\nwith a weight on its back. In an instant I saw\n\nand did not see, and the instant remained only one.\n\nTo my ear all that came was the stir of the birds,\n\nbewildered and unmoored birds. And the bark of the dog\n\nin the sea without shore, and the steps neither near nor far.\n\nfrom A Last Walk through Town\n\nLAUNDRESSES\n\nIn a field half pale and half black\n\nfrom turned earth rests a plow\n\nwithout oxen to pull it.\n\nIn the deft sweep of mist\n\nthat surrounds, it seems left long behind.\n\nAnd in stretched stubborn rhyme\n\ncomes the song of the laundresses\n\ndown by the creek where they're washing.\n\nIt arrives with the thwack of wet sheets\n\npounded thick against stone:\n\nWind blows and like snow the boughs flutter\n\nand fall, and you haven't yet come back\n\nto town. What a state I was in\n\nwhen you left here back then!\n\nLike a plow above black, fallow ground.\n\nHENS\n\nUnlike our brooding wretched selves\n\nthe old heart of the farmer's wife\n\nwon't weep with grief at falling leaves;\n\nshrewd roosters keep her henhouse.\n\nAnd in the peace that sunrise brings,\n\nshe listens to the thickened cries\n\nand summonings of sturdy hens.\n\nHer granary is packed. Wine sings\n\ninside the vat. Come dusk the impish farm boys\n\nambush crackling heaps of crumpled leaves\n\nand bent beside her, blooming girls with thoughtful eyes\n\nhum lullabies while shucking husks of corn.\n\nThe Ox\n\nAlong a thread of river and between\n\nvague screens of mist, the ox\n\nlifts up his ample eyes to gaze downstream:\n\nthrough land that rolls as if set free\n\nthe water in the sky blue river\n\nmigrates toward an ever farther sea.\n\nPerceived thus by the ox's eyes, the willow\n\nand the alder grow, inside the glow\n\nof dusty light; the herd disperses\n\nslowly, looming here or there, and staining\n\ngrass that's green and stiff. They drift\n\nas if belonging to the rustic god of myth.\n\nRaptors flap colossal wings against the air\n\nand fire-tongued mute beasts roll by;\n\nthey look like clouds in the immense, deep sky;\n\nThe mammoth sun behind the soaring mountains\n\nsets: already every edge starts to detach,\n\nexpand—the large black shadows of a larger land.\n\nHoliday Morning\n\nWhat's with the bells\n\nwhich ring far from here\n\nand nearing us hover and thrum?\n\nIt's a hymn without end, limned\n\nin silver, now gold, a song\n\nfor the shadows at dawn.\n\nWith your calm lull and swell,\n\noh balm of gold bells, you beseech\n\nfrom the half-asleep sky.\n\nResounding song, you silver bells\n\nthat ring and ring, I love,\n\nI love, now sing\n\nthe song, oh balm of gold,\n\ncalm wave that sways\n\nfrom the sky above\n\nbut beneath the love,\n\nthat deeper voice\n\nof a grave responds, as if\n\nit responds to the song's true wish.\n\nfrom Sadnesses\n\nLIGHTNING\n\nAnd sky and earth were exposed:\n\nearth raked over, breathless and bruised.\n\nsky grief-stricken, laden, undone:\n\nstark white in the dumb wake of chaos a home\n\nappeared quick disappeared in one\n\nspark: like an eye, huge and confused\n\nin the dark, might open, then close.\n\nTHUNDER\n\nAnd inside the black night black as nothing\n\nis black: in a flash with a sound like a cliff\n\ncrashing down, the pounding of thunder cracked\n\nopen. Cracked, and then echoing back to drift\n\nlow, then slowing to rest into silence. And cresting,\n\nand broken, and gone. Soft then the song of a mother\n\nslipped in, and the smooth dip and lift of a cradle.\n\nValentino\n\nValentino, dressed up in new clothes\n\nlike bloomed branches of hawthorn!\n\nBut on your feet calloused by brambles\n\nyou wear just your skin: shoes\n\nyour mother once made and not costing\n\na penny, unchanged since the day\n\nyou were born. But the clothes\n\nthat she sewed you cost plenty.\n\nOh they cost her each cent\n\nof her jingling bank, the closed jar broken\n\nopen and spilled on the wood to be spent.\n\nTo replenish those coins, the whole\n\nchicken coop sang its cacophonous song\n\nfor well more than a month; now they're gone.\n\nThink back to the winter when firewood\n\nwaned, and you shivered for lack, Valentino.\n\nAnd the hens sang: An egg! Oh an egg!\n\nOh an egg! Then they clucked and March\n\nknocked and you slight country kid\n\nwere left only half dressed—like a bird,\n\nplush with feathers but barefoot.\n\nLike a bird who'd flown up from the sea\n\nto flit quick between cherries and pears,\n\nflitting all unaware (beyond how to peck\n\nfruit, how to love, how to sing) of what\n\nhappiness bright other worlds might bring.\n\nThe Hour in Barga\n\nTo this shade in the garden where all I can hear\n\nis the bristle of grain growing ripe in the fields,\n\nwind reels the sound of the struck hours down\n\nfrom a town in the hills that from here\n\nI can't see: the sound steady and falling\n\nin waves, like a voice that persuades.\n\nVoice of a bell that falls out of the sky:\n\nYou tell me, It's late. You tell me, It's time.\n\nBut please let me wait yet a while to look\n\nat the tree and the spider, the bee, and the stem,\n\nthings that contain in them hundreds of years or a year\n\nor an hour, and these clouds that keep waving away.\n\nLet me wait motionless here, let me stay\n\nwith the whirring of wings and the lichens and fronds;\n\nlet me listen to roosters call out from a farm\n\nand then hear, from another, some others respond\n\nor the song of the titmouse, its diligent trill,\n\nwhile my own soul's attention stalls, elsewhere.\n\nAnd again the hour sounds, sending down\n\nto me now first a silvery wonder, then\n\nblending, unending, that voice from before—\n\nthe same falling voice that calls\n\nsolemnly, heartening, solemnly saying\n\nthat it's time, that it's late.\n\nVoice of a bell that falls out of the sky:\n\nSo you want me to think of returning.\n\nBut it's lovely this last fringe of daylight that eases\n\ntranslucently through me as if through a veil.\n\nI know, yes, it's late, I know it's now time—\n\nBut please let me wait here a while to look.\n\nLet me look, through my solitude, into my heart\n\nLet me live my way into my past.\n\nThat there might throughout time be this bloom\n\non the shrub; that I might find a kiss\n\nI've not kissed. From this cloister of shade at the rim\n\nof my garden, please let me weep for my life.\n\nAnd again the hour sounds, sending down\n\nto me twice now a cry almost fretful,\n\nthen back to that slow, unfazed voice.\n\nIn my own garden's shade, it persuades me.\n\nIt's time. It's late. Yes, okay. Let's return there to where\n\nI am loved, where I love.\n\nFides\n\nWhen at twilight the air glowed a rare scarlet red\n\nand the cypress flared gold, a fine dusting of gold,\n\nthe mother explained to her very small son\n\nthat up there, it's all gold, it's a garden.\n\nHer son is asleep and he dreams of gold\n\nbranches, trees made of gold, golden forests.\n\nMeanwhile outside in the black core of night,\n\nthe cypress weeps rain, and wars with the wind.\n\ntranslated from the Italian by Taije Silverman and Marina Della Putta Johnston"
