What Rosenbaum does best is on display in the Woolf essay B archival sleuthing with a touch of the serendipitous and skilfull extrapolation from his materials. His discovery of the manuscript of the lecture allowed him to trace its development from its occasion to its printed form as well as allowing `us to defamiliarise the text and re-experience the originality of a work so original that it has become our commonplace.' The decision to leave the essays relatively untouched makes for an occasionally annoying repetition, but this is a minor cavil. Rosenbaum takes Wittgenstein's `fundamental notion of overlapping and criss-crossing similarities' as the basis for his conception of Bloomsbury's literary history and makes this volume its elegant instance. (JUDITH SCHERER HERZ) Robin Healey. Twentieth-Century Italian Literature in Translation: An Annotated Bibliography, 1929B1997 University of Toronto Press 1998. xxx, 606. $95.00 In the twentieth century, six Italian authors have won the Nobel Prize for Literature: Giosuè Carducci (1906), Grazia Deledda (1926), Luigi Pirandello (1934), Salvatore Quasimodo (1959), Eugenio Montale (1975), and Dario Fo (1997). For the serious literary scholar who comprehends Italian fluently, there is no substitute for the richness and subtle complexity embedded in the original texts of these authors. But for the vast majority of English readers who have a fondness for Italian literature, the only avenue for understanding and appreciation is a good fluid translation. Not only have the works of Italian Nobel laureates been translated frequently into English but there abounds, for example, a virtual plethora of translations into English of popular novelists such as Ignazio Silone, Alberto Moravia, Italo Calvino, and Umberto Eco. There have also been many translations, especially of modern Italian poetry, published by smaller, non-commercial presses of lesser-known Italian authors. Robin Healey's annotated bibliography is a shining testament to the abundant variety of these English translations. Healey earned his doctorate in 1976 with a dissertation entitled `Family and Social Change in a South Italian Town.' His love of Italian literature stems from that formative period in his career. His bibliography, which contains 2500 listings of some 1400 works, is an exemplary reference tool. Firmly grounded in biography and publishing history, it is a work of erudition and clarity, which complements and surpasses its predecessor, Nancy C. Shields's landmark study, Italian Translations in America (1931). humanities 477 Whereas Shields's scholarly bibliography is relegated to English translations in American editions from the beginnings of Italian literature up to 1928, Healey's bibliography documents practically the rest of the twentieth century, encompassing all countries in which English translations have appeared in monograph and serial form. The bibliography begins with a comprehensive introduction that gives an overview of the patterns in English translation, the economic aspects of publishing, the translators themselves, previous bibliographies in the field, the structure of the bibliographical entries, the bibliographical principles at work, and access points. Separate preliminary sections list the sources consulted and abbreviations employed. The bibliography is organized chronologically by year and then within each year entries appear alphabetically under each author's name. There is also an appendix of translations found by Healey at the penultimate stage of his work, primarily translations recorded in the OCLC WorldCat database. Bibliographical descriptions consist of a unique four-digit reference number, the main entry (usually the author's name), the uniform title (ordinarily the Italian title with the original date of publication), the English title, the name of the translator, imprint, series if any, pagination, notes, and sources of data (copies examined, another bibliography or an online database). Access to the bibliography is provided by six separate indexes keyed to item numbers: author, title, translator, editor, publisher, and periodical. There are many outstanding features of Healey's bibliography, including its organization, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and ease of access. `A good annotated bibliography,' Healey points out in his introduction, `should encourage readers who consult it to look..."
