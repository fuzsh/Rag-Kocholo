        "text": "Date: [unknown] [unknown]\n\nLocation: [unknown]\n\nSurname/tag: nobel_prize\n\nThis page has been accessed 413 times.\n\nSpace:Connectors_Chat Unconnected Notables\n\nIntroduction\n\n(Note: This page is a sub-page of the Unconnected Notables page, which, in turn, is a sub-page of the Connectors Chat page. For more details about what's going on here, please read the Connectors Chat page. Also, please post any messages about what's happening on this page on the Connectors Chat page.)\n\nThis table lists Nobel Prize laureates who have profiles on WikiTree that are not yet connected to the main tree.\n\nThe \"Branch Size\" number is the total number of profiles in the branch that contains that notable's profile. (If the branch size is 1, it means that that notable has not been linked to any parent, spouse, or child's profile.)\n\nThe \"Name\" is the full name for that notable, or the name by which they are commonly known.\n\nThe \"Last Name At Birth\" is normally that notable's last name at birth. (If that notable is from a culture which does not use last names, then the Last Name At Birth will be whatever is used in that person's WikiTree ID.)\n\nThe \"Country\" cell includes any country where somebody from that branch was born. (Note that many branches spread over more than one country, so you may miss some branches that are at least partly in the country you're looking for if you sort the table by this column. To make sure that you find all of them, try searching within this page using Control-F if you're running Linux or Windows, or Command-F if you're running macOS.)\n\nThe \"Discipline\" cell lists which Nobel Prize was awarded to that person.\n\nAn asterisk (*) in the \"Five Star\" column means that that person's profile is considered \"5 star\". In other words, it has received at least 1,000 total views from at least 100 separate visitors in the past year. These profiles need special attention to improve them, and help WikiTree put our best foot forward. See Chris' announcement, \"Will you help us improve the most-visited profiles?\" for more details.\n\nThe \"Year Awarded\" column lists what year that person was awarded a Noble Prize.\n\nIf there is an asterisk (*) in the \"1900\" column, it means that person was alive in the year 1900. This is to mark profiles that are eligible for inclusion in La Belle Époque Project.\n\nThe default sort for the list is first by whether the person is a \"5 star\" notable, then by the number of profiles in that branch, then by country, then by surname, then by given name, but you can sort the list by any column (Branch Size, Name, Last Name At Birth, Country, Notable As, or Working On) by clicking on the sort symbol in the header for that column.\n\nFree space profiles (like this one) work pretty much the same way that profiles for people do, so all the same syntax applies. So to show that you are working on a branch, edit this page, scroll down to the listing you want to work on, and replace the number at the end of the line with two opening square brackets ([), then your WikiTree ID, then a pipe (|), then your name, then two closing square brackets (]), like this: [[Example-123|Ferdinand Grubstake]].\n\nSimilarly, when you connect a branch (or discover one that's already connected), add Connected (or Found connected) and then the date. Put three single quotes (') before and after \"connected\" to put it into bold, like this: \"'Connected'\" February 29, 2020. One of the page pruners will then delete that entry in a couple of weeks, after everybody has had a chance to celebrate the new connection.\n\nFeel free to add more unconnected notables, but please do not add notables whose profiles are not set to Open. Connecting is hard enough without having to deal with privacy restrictions.\n\nFor more places to find unconnected notables, see the \"Resources\" section at the bottom of this page.\n\nUnconnected Notables\n\nBranch Size Name Last Name At Birth Country Discipline Five Star Year Awarded 1900 Working On 53 Nelson Mandela Mandela South Africa Peace * 1993 * 33 Knut Hamsun Hamsun Norway Literature 1920 * Found connected 2024-06-26. 25 Sully Prudhomme Prudhomme France Literature 1901 * 15 Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Chandrasekhar India Physics 1983 15 Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman Raman India Physics 1930 * 10 Rabindranath Tagore Tagore India Literature * 1913 * 9 Bernardo Alberto Houssay Houssay Argentina Physiology or Medicine 1947 * 8 Otto Loewi Loewi Germany Physiology or Medicine * 1936 8 Mother Teresa Bojaxhiu North Macedonia Peace * 1979 8 Lars Onsager Onsager Norway Chemistry 1968 * 7 Johannes Stark Stark Germany Physics 1919 * 7 Charles T.R.
