Biography

Field: poetry

Giosuè was born in 1835.

After studying on a scholarship at Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, Giosuè began teaching. He eventually became a Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Bologna.

In 1859, he married Elvira Menicucci, and they had five children.

While most notable for his poetry - displayed in collections Rime Nuove (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) - he also wrote many volumes of prose, including literary criticism, biographies, speeches and essays.

In 1906 he became the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature: "[...] not only in consideration of his deep learning and critical research, but above all as a tribute to the creative energy, freshness of style, and lyrical force which characterize his poetic masterpieces".

He passed away in 1907.
