Exeter striker Adam Stansfield has died at the age of 31 following a battle against cancer.

Stansfield was admitted to hospital at the end of March and diagnosed with bowel cancer following a series of tests for an abdominal complaint.

A club statement on Tuesday night read: 'It is with great sadness that Exeter City Football Club have to confirm the news that Adam Stansfield passed away this evening.

'Our thoughts are with his wife, family and friends at this time.'

The Tiverton-born forward began his professional career at Yeovil in 2001, making his debut in the Football Conference at Southport in November that year.

He joined Hereford on a free transfer in 2004 and two years later moved on to Exeter, where he made more than 150 first-team appearances, scoring 39 goals.
