        "text": "Two former Exeter City academy graduates have penned long term deals at their new clubs.\n\nBen Chrisene has extended his contract at Aston Villa, while Jay Stansfield has committed his future to Fulham until 2024.\n\nChrisene had made five appearances for the Grecians in the 2019/20 season before his move to the Premier League side, included becoming the club’s youngest ever player when aged 15 years, 7 months and 1 day, he appeared in the EFL Cup.\n\nThe highly-rated 18-year-old then went on to make his first-team debut in Villa’s FA Cup third-round tie against Liverpool last January, penning a professional contract just days later.\n\nRead More - Exeter City 'angry, disappointed and embarrassed' by small group of fans\n\nHe then duly went on to help the Young Lions celebrate FA Youth Cup success in May 2021, netting the opening goal in the final.\n\nThe England Under-17 international spent the first few months of this season on the sidelines but has recently returned to action.\n\nAcademy manager Mark Harrison said: “We are delighted that Ben has signed a new extended contract with us.\n\n“Since he joined us, Ben has continued to develop and this is just reward for the progression he has made, but also shows the belief and commitment we have in his potential.\n\n“This contract will hopefully give him the platform to work towards that transition of becoming a first-team player.\n\n“But, as like with all young players, this will only be achieved with continued hard work and the right mentality.”\n\nGet the best stories about the things you love most curated by us and delivered to your inbox every day. Choose what you love here\n\nIt comes as Stansfield – the son of former Grecian legend Adam Stansfield - has signed a new contract with Fulham until the summer of 2024.\n\nThe 19-year-old striker had only six months remaining on his previous deal and had been tracked by Premier League sides.\n\nHe has now committed to stay at Craven Cottage for at least another two seasons, with Fulham holding the option of extending his contract by a further year.\n\nStansfield has stepped into the first-team picture this season and has been training full time with the squad since the appointment of Marco Silva last summer.\n\nHe has made an impression on the Portuguese coach and has also featured in eight match-day squads this season, despite suffering a knee injury that required surgery in November.\n\nHe made his first full start against Birmingham City in the Carabao Cup in August and marked the occasion by scoring his first senior goal, a long-range strike from distance.\n\nHe has scored four goals in six Premier League 2 appearances this season, in addition to his two first-team appearances.\n\nBack at St James Park, Callum Rowe has left City to join Bath City on loan until the end of the season.\n\nThe 22-year-old summer signing has made three first team appearances for the Grecians so far this campaign, featuring in the League Two match at Leyton Orient as well as two Papa John's Trophy matches - against Chelsea U21 and Cheltenham Town.\n\nThis is Rowe’s second loan after he spent a month at National League South side Chippenham Town back in November.\n\nHe links up with fellow Grecians Jordan Dyer and Ben Seymour at Twerton Park, and will spend the rest of the 21/22 season with the Romans, who sit in 16th place in the National League South, and made his debut for Bath City against Hampton and Richmond Borough last night."
