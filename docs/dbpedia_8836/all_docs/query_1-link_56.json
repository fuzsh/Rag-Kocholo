        "text": "Jay Stansfield enjoyed the Birmingham City debut that dreams are made of on Saturday.\n\nIt doesn’t get much better than scoring a 95th minute winner in front of a sell-out St Andrew’s against the team your family despises. Plymouth Argyle were the perfect first victim for Stansfield, whose Exeter City roots run deep.\n\n“I’ve had loads of messages from all the Exeter fans already,” Stansfield said shortly after his match-winning performance. “I’m obviously playing for Birmingham but I was in Exeter’s academy and all my family live there. I played against them last season and didn’t score so to be able to come here and do it is special.\n\n“I couldn’t have dreamed of a better debut. It had no back-lift and I knew where the goal was, I took a right foot swing and luckily it went in.\"\n\nREAD: Blues show their other side & the Hall factor as Stansfield justifies hype\n\nREAD: Schumacher drops Aston Villa reveal after Jay Stansfield left him 'devastated'\n\nStansfield modestly described a goal which showed speed, intelligence, touch and technique in a few ruthlessly clinical touches. He can recall a better goal, though.\n\n“Probably the last time I was here to be honest,” quipped Stansfield, alluding to his first professional goal against Blues for Fulham in 2021. He added: “With the occasion, and the day, it would probably be the best goal I’ve scored so far.”\n\nStansfield has already revealed that his decision to reject half the Championship in favour of a move to high-flying Blues was partly down to the club’s location. The Midlands is far closer to his family home in Devon than Sunderland, who were among the teams courting him before Blues swooped.\n\nFamily comes first for Stansfield and Blues’ location means he doesn’t have to travel far to see them. It also means his nearest and dearest can come and watch him play in the Championship this season - although two of them missed his heroic Blues bow.\n\n“My mum and stepdad are on a cruise,” Stansfield revealed afterwards. “My girlfriend was here and a couple of my mates, so hopefully they were watching it on the boat! I’ve not been on my phone yet so I’m looking forward to that.”\n\nAfter watching Stansfield make his mark in League One during a loan spell with boyhood club Exeter last season, Fulham seriously considered keeping him at Craven Cottage and blooding him in the Premier League. Stansfield has already played a handful of top flight matches and penned a new four-year contract with Fulham before making the switch to Blues.\n\nFulham boss Marco Silva and Stansfield ultimately decided another loan move was in the forward’s best interests. Blues head coach John Eustace is thrilled that they did.\n\nStansfield explained: “I had a chat with the gaffer a couple of weeks ago just to see what he thought of last season and how I developed. He is always so helpful and so keen on me. He always gives me the right information and encouragement.\n\n“We said the best part of learning is going out and getting exposure to first team football. I could have pushed to try and get in the team there, but I’m still only 20 and this season is a big season.\n\n“I did well last season in League One so this is another stepping stone. I have signed a new contract there so hopefully when I go back there I can push harder to get in the team.”\n\nHis late dad, Adam, would have appreciated his goal at The Tilton Road end more than most. Stansfield senior, a fine goalscorer in his day with Exeter, tragically died in 2010, aged 31. Stansfield ended this interview with a nod to his dad.\n\n“My aim is to score as many goals as he scored and become a hero like he did. I think of him every day and I think in the last couple of weeks I could have done with him for a bit of advice.\n\n“I had so many teams coming in and I didn’t know which one to go to. It was quite tough to decide if I was going to move away from home, if I was going to move up the country or down the country.\n\n“I have all my family around me, my stepdad now who helps massively, and my mum who gives me a lot of advice on things. She doesn’t know much about football (laughs) but she’s very helpful when it comes to the family side of it.”"
