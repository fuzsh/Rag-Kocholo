Lets hope he's comes bac and is knocking on the first team door, looks hard for him to be doing that with us at the mo though.\n\nDecent move for Norwood chance to play at a useful level to develope himself!\n\nWhy is it I think it is a bad move, he is 20 and should be in the frame, Tis would rather have Cureton at whatever age and has shown a willingness to sign forwards from a higher level than that to which James has been sent, this is just one of the reasons I wouldn't climb onto the 31 bandwagon, as admirable as that effort is.\n\nOf course I could just be full of sh*t.\n\nNo 'cashback' to the 1931 Fund, but our promise is to pay the cost of Number 31 to ECFC. So if James being loaned out reduces the cost to City, then we pay less than the budgeted Â£12,000 this season to the club and there'll be a balence left in the fund in June 2011.\n\n1931 Fund members, I owe you an email. I'll pass the full info on when I've spoken with ECFC - sorry, I don't much feel like talking through the nuts and bolts of the loan deal just now.\n\nWhy is it I think it is a bad move, he is 20 and should be in the frame, Tis would rather have Cureton at whatever age and has shown a willingness to sign forwards from a higher level than that to which James has been sent, this is just one of the reasons I wouldn't climb onto the 31 bandwagon, as admirable as that effort is.\n\nOf course I could just be full of sh*t.\n\nBut hes only been a profesional for one year where most players would be a proffesional from 17 onwards etr so development wise he needs to drop down imho but i think he could a good future player for us..."
