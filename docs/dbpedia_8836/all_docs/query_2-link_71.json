Both games are being played behind closed doors due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe overall winner will go through to a Play-off final at Wembley later in the month, with the prize of a place in Division One.\n\nLord Mayor Cllr Peter Holland, who is seated next to Exeter City Club legend Adam Stansfield, said he wished the Club well in their quest for promotion.\n\nCity Council Leader Phil Bialyk, who is pictured sat next to the Lord Mayor, said “This is a fantastic initiative – getting the fans behind the team for what promises to be a massive game at St James and supporting the club through these difficult times. I’m happy to be playing my part and can’t wait for the game.”"
