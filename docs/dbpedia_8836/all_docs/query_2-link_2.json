        "text": "“A natural striker and a sunny personality.\n\nWhen Steve Guinan moved on after United’s first tilt at the conference play-offs, there was understandably some concern about where the goals were going to come from in the new campaign.\n\nBut those worries soon evaporated when it became clear what a gem Graham Turner had signed in Adam Stansfield. An ever-willing worker, Adam’s enthusiasm and readiness to chase lost causes quickly made him a popular addition to the Edgar Street staff.\n\nBut he was much more than just a workhorse. Skill pace and a deadly eye for goal marked him down as an ideal striker at Conference level, and as he was later to prove with Exeter, at a higher level too.\n\nAs well as having the pleasure of watching Adam score his goals and contributing to the team on all levels, I also was fortunate to interview Adam for the Hereford Times on a number of occasions.\n\nHe was never anything less than accommodating, honest, intelligent and interesting, putting forward his opinions on the game and the club in a thoughtful and straightforward manner.\n\nHis warm smile and enthusiastic greeting whenever you met him, at the club or in the city, is something that I shall remember for a long time."
