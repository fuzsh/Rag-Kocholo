        "text": "Coventry City fans have been given a hint of potential first team stars of the future after the club have handed professional contracts to two highy-rated teenagers.\n\nProlific goalscorer Harrison Nee and captain material George Burroughs have both been rewarded for their hard worth with the Sky Blues Under-18s with their first pro deals at the Championship club.\n\nNee, who has hit an outstanding 18 goals in 18 league games for the Under-18s despite missing two months with injury, and centre-back Burroughs, who has skippered the side for the last two years, will step up to the club’s Under-23s where they will attempt to bridge the gap into Mark Robins ’s senior side over the next few years.\n\nEighteen-year-old striker Nee joined the Sky Blues Academy as an Under 11 and is described as adaptable player who operates in the front third of the pitch and has great work rate off the ball.\n\nAcademy Manager Dan Bolas said: “In his Under 18 season, Harrison has really put together all the hard work and information given to him throughout his time with the club and had an excellent campaign, and it is great news that he has now signed his first professional contract with Coventry City.\n\n“Great credit should also go to his family for the excellent support that they have shown to Harrison throughout his time with us.\n\n“His challenge moving into the Under 23s squad is to transfer the ability and influence he has shown in Under 18s games and continue his development.\n\n“It is important that we celebrate the success of young players who have progressed through the Academy ages groups in going on to earn a professional contract, and everyone at the Academy wishes Harrison all the best for the next phase of his journey with Coventry City.”\n\nBurroughs, meanwhile, who is also 18, is the younger brother of Jack who recently made his Championship debut for City, going on as a substitute for the last two games of the season where he was deployed as a wing-back.\n\nGeorge, who is a centre-half, has been at the Sky Blues Academy since signing as an Under 9s player.\n\nLike his 20-year-old brother, George has also been involved in the Scotland youth set-up.\n\nBolas said: “Signing a professional contract is a great achievement for George and great credit goes to him for this achievement, and also to his family for the commitment and determination they have shown through their duration of time at the club in supporting George.\n\n“Whilst we are always looking for the players to continue to develop and improve, it is important to acknowledge the successes of young players who have developed through their time at the Academy and progressed to earning their first professional contract, and all of us at the Academy wish George the very best in the next stage of his journey with the club.”\n\nSadly, for every success story of players making it to the next stage of their development there are always disappointments for players who are released at the end of their scholarships.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2020/21 campaign, Dan Lafferty will leave the Sky Blues.\n\nThe third year scholar has been with City since a young age and showed determination to recover from serious injury and feature for the Under 23s last season.\n\nAlex Costa, Keelan Fallows, Kai Forsyth, Matthew Harland, Joe Nightingale, Sam Pitts-Eckersall, Hayden Purves and Adam Taylor have also not been offered professional contracts and will leave the Sky Blues at the end of the season.\n\nBolas said: “It is never an easy decision to release players from the club, especially as many have been with us at the Academy from a young age.\n\n“I would like to thank the players for their commitment and hard work over the years, and also thank their families for the support that they have provided too.\n\n“We hope that these young men will look back fondly at their time with us, and we wish them all the best of luck for the future.”"
