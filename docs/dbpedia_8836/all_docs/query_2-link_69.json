        "text": "The ECFC Walk of Fame | Strikers Mural was created in 2018 as part of the HLFSupported ECFC Museum project, in order to remember and to celebrate some of the club’s most memorable goal-scorers of the past fifty years\n\nIn addition, more than 1000 names from our A to Z of players collection have been incorporated into the background of the design to acknowledge almost everyone player who has appeared for the Exeter City first team since the club was founded as St Sidwell’s United in 1901.\n\nAlan Banks– The former Liverpool FC striker helped the club to its first ever promotion in his debut season at the Park. He was also the first player to reach 100 goals for ECFC.\n\nFred Binney– An entertainer on and off the pitch, Binney was one of the City stars of the early 1970s as he scored on average a goal every other game in the Football League.\n\nAlan Beer– Part of the 1977 promotion winning side, the Welshman formed a potent partnership on the pitch with Tony Kellow, and had it not been for injury, he would have certainly been one of the few players to play international football while on the books at ECFC.\n\nTony Kellow– The prolific Cornishman remains a popular figure to all his ‘cousins’ at the Park today, and is still the club’s record scorer with 150 goals.\n\nDarran Rowbotham– Only the third player to score more than 100 goals for ECFC, Rowbotham played a key role for the club as we won the Fourth Division in 1990.\n\nSteve Flack– Only a few players have made more appearances for ECFC, and fewer still have done so with more determination. Scored the club’s first league goal under trust ownership, and is an icon of this era.\n\nRichard Logan– ‘Logie’ scored the all-important goal as City claimed back-to-back promotions in 2009. To-date he is also number one for league goals in the Trust era with 47.\n\nAdam Stansfield– His effort and goals were vital to the Club’s return to the Football League and journey to League One. Will be remembered for years to come for his attitude on and off the pitch.\n\nOllie Watkins– The ECFC Academy Graduate burst onto the scene in 2014, and played a vital role for the club on our way to Wembley in 2017 before his transfer to Championship side, Brentford."
