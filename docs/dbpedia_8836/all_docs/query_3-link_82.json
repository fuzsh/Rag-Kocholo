        "text": "Jay Stansfield will wear father's number 9 shirt\n\nThe son of an Exeter City striker who died 12 years ago is to play in the number 9 shirt that was rested since after passed away.\n\nJay Stansfield has returned to Exeter on loan from Premier League side Fulham for the 2022/23 season.\n\nThe 19-year-old, who is son of Grecians legend Adam, began his career at the City Academy before signing for the London club in August 2019. He now returns to Devon for his first loan move as Matt Taylorâ€™s latest signing of the summer.\n\nThe St James Park club says Jay has been a pivotal part of the youth set up at Fulham, making his first team debut there in January 2020 in an FA Cup match against Aston Villa.\n\nThe striker has also represented England at under-18 and under-20 level, making eight appearances.\n\nStansfield will wear the iconic number 9 shirt, previously worn by his father Adam.\n\n\"I spoke to Jay back in June and it's been on the cards for such a long time, we just had to be patient,\" said manager Matt Taylor.\n\n\"He had a really strong pre-season with Fulham and it was great for him to have an impact on their Premier League campaign. I'm absolutely delighted we managed to make this happen.\n\n\"Jay will learn a lot about himself as well as about ourselves over the next few weeks, but his game can definitely adapt. He's scored so many goals in the academy and has carried that on into the under-21s, and showed signs in the first team as well.\n\n\"This is a signing for the fans to really get excited about.\"\n\nAdam Stansfield, who was 31, was a popular player whose name lives on in a charity named in his honour and the Adam Stansifeld family stand, sponsored by Stagecoach. The club decided to rest the number 9 shirt for nine years when he died."
