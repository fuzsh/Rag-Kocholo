        "text": "South Asian Heritage Trust have stated they 'reject any attempt to divide our communities' in the midst of far-right protests across the UK. They say it is ill-timed that riots are plaguing cities during South Asian Heritage Month, which takes place between July 18 and August 17.\n\nThe month celebrates South Asian culture and it's contribution to British society, however, many have expressed fear over Islamophobic and anti-refugee riots making their way across cities. Riots are rumoured to come to Jewellery Quarter where businesses have boarded up for safety.\n\nHowever, in a message of unity, South Asian Heritage Trust stated the celebratory month would still go ahead. In a statement, they said: \"The violence across the UK over the last few days has been driven by division and hatred, as well as ignorance and misinformation. We reject any attempt to divide our communities or our society in this way.\n\nRead more:Birmingham 'protests' live as Jewellery Quarter in lockdown and public warned to 'stay at home'\n\nPOLL: Are you worried about knife crime in Birmingham?\n\n\"South Asian Heritage Month is a time for celebration, commemoration and education. It's about understanding the commonalities and differences between different communities and cultures in order to bring them together better.\n\n\"The theme for SAHM this year is Free To Be Me, and yet so many of us don't feel free to be ourselves at the present time. We completely understand that fear and anxiety, as do the generations of South Asians who came before us.\n\n\"South Asians are an integral part of Britain. Trying to attack us or force us into hiding will not deter us from the work that we do. We remain proud of who we are, and even in the midst of this turmoil, South Asian Heritage Month will continue to run until 17th August as usual.\n\n\"We thank our many supporters across the country. We will remain defiant in the face of hatred.\"\n\nOther South Asian community events still going ahead include Birmingham Mega Mela, which will take place this weekend hoping to unite communities despite far-right fears.\n\nJoin our Brummie Muslims WhatsApp group here"
