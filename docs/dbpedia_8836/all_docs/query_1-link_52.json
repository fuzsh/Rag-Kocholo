        "text": "Welcome back to the Swansea.com Stadium for our Championship fixture against Southampton.\n\nI would like to start my programme notes by paying tribute to the fantastic support you gave Luke and the players at Birmingham last Saturday.\n\nTo have a sold-out away end for his first league game in charge speaks volumes of your backing for him, the players and this club, and we are incredibly grateful for that.\n\nIt has been a testing time but we are now looking forwards and we are excited about the journey ahead.\n\nI also want to take this opportunity as a club to express our deep sadness at the news that Tata Steel will cut 2,800 jobs across its UK operations.\n\nThe town of Port Talbot and the industry have been synonymous with our community for decades and almost everyone there has either worked at the site or has a friend or family member who does work there, or has worked there.\n\nNews of these job cuts are a devastating blow and I can assure you that Swansea City will be doing everything it can to open our doors to those affected and offer our support.\n\nThis also marks Luke’s first home league game in charge and we want to create a special atmosphere.\n\nBack in October, the Supporters’ Trust launched their Matchday Experience Project, in conjunction with the club, to try and identify and implement changes that make your matchday experience better.\n\nOne striking element from the results of that survey was around supporters wanting the matchday experience to include more elements of Welsh identity, which is something we are extremely proud of.\n\nWith that in mind, we are delighted to inform supporters that prior to kick-off against Southampton, Hymns and Arias will return and we encourage everyone to sing that song with everything you have just before the game kicks off and help generate a fantastic atmosphere.\n\nAs supporters are aware, we are in the midst of the January transfer window and there is a lot of activity going on behind the scenes.\n\nOur objective is always to make the club stronger in each window and that is our aim this month.\n\nWe are actively in touch with clubs and players and we will be ready to act when we can bring in a player that will make us stronger.\n\nOnce again, show your magnificent support as you have done all season and let’s hope we are celebrating together come full-time.\n\nEnjoy the game,\n\nAndy\n\nWelcome back to the Swansea.com Stadium for our Championship fixture against Southampton.\n\nWe return to home soil after picking up a point against Birmingham City last weekend, when we were so close to coming away with all three.\n\nTo concede so late was obviously disappointing, but there was plenty for us to take from the game; and every time we play we are getting more information to take forward and improve us as a team.\n\nI was pleased with the resilience the players showed, when there were moments where things did not go the way we wanted they fought for each other and for the 2,000 supporters who gave us such tremendous backing in a sold-out away end.\n\nIn the second half, apart from one early chance, we were the better side and I think one of the big learnings we will take from that is the need to stay on the front foot in games.\n\nWe were playing in a manner that had got us into the lead of the game and given us some control, and then we made the mistake of looking to defend the lead.\n\nIt’s an easy thing to do in those circumstances, but if the way you are playing has been good enough to get you in front, then it’s good enough to keep you there.\n\nSo, that’s been one of the things we have been clear about as a group this week. We are at the start of a process, so all these moments of learning are a real positive for us as we look to become the team we want to be; one that excites and connects with you, the supporter.\n\nWe welcome a Southampton side who have been in excellent form, and one we know will provide us with a stern test.\n\nTheir head coach Russell Martin is obviously someone I know from our time working together at MK Dons and Swansea, and he has done a really good job since going to St Mary’s last summer.\n\nThere is a great deal of mutual respect between us, and we enjoyed our time working together, but we are our own men each with our own different takes on what we want our teams to look like.\n\nThe challenge for us is to show the bravery required to make sure we are in the tussle to dominate the game.\n\nWe have to be really focused and brave enough to try and find our moments in the game.\n\nWe know they will be a huge threat and we know they are a good side, but we have to be brave enough to try and find a way to get a foothold in the game and establish ourselves.\n\nOff the pitch I know supporters will be eagerly waiting news of any incomings and outgoings during the January transfer window.\n\nI can promise you there is plenty of work going on behind the scenes, and ultimately the aim has to be to make sure that anyone we bring to this football club is going to come in and make an immediate difference, as well as being able to grow and develop further in their time here.\n\nYou don’t want to sign players for the sake of it, you want people who can make an impact, and we will see what happens in the weeks ahead.\n\nThis fixture is also dedicated to the work done by the Swansea City AFC Foundation in our city and community. We pride ourselves on being a community club, and it is only right that we shine a light on the projects and initiatives the Foundation deliver to help so many people.\n\nI'd also like to wish our under-21 team the best of luck when they face TNS this evening in the final of the Nathaniel MG Cup. I am sure they will do the club proud.\n\nIn the meantime, I’m looking forward to hearing you give the players the full-throated, partisan backing the Jack Army are known for as we look to deliver a performance you can be proud of.\n\nEnjoy the game,\n\nLuke\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome back to the Swansea.com Stadium for our return fixture against Southampton.\n\nAhead of our first game of the New Year against West Bromwich Albion, I delivered a message to supporters in which I said the club needed to act with haste to secure a new head coach.\n\nWell, what a difference 19 days can make! I am delighted to be the first Swansea City Supporters’ Trust board member to extend a warm welcome to supporters to watch Luke Williams’ Swansea City play their first EFL Championship home fixture since his appointment.\n\nAlthough we did not manage to secure all three points against Birmingham, I was staggered at the magnitude of the support shown by our travelling fans in the away end, and the bravery and desire shown by the team on the pitch. It was a much-improved performance, and I am hoping we can take it into this game.\n\nI know the result against Southampton on Boxing Day will be on all of our supporters’ minds, and everyone will be keen to put in an improved showing this time around.\n\nSouthampton are the in-form team in the Championship, having gone 20 games unbeaten in all competitions.\n\nI am under no illusions that this will be a difficult game, which is why it is so crucial that we get behind the team for the full 90 minutes, and build the atmosphere needed to push them over the line.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, I would like to give a special mention to the Trust’s Matchday Experience Project, which has been running since October 2023.\n\nEarlier this week the Trust released a statement summarising the findings of this project, as well as a full report for supporters to read. The results of our project demonstrate a clear and strong voice for changes fans would like to see made. You can view that release HERE.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I would invite supporters to keep an eye out for changes in our pre-match build-up for this game and in our upcoming home games. Additionally, if you have any other thoughts and suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact the Trust at info@swanstrust.co.uk.\n\nSpeaking of which, I know supporters are eager for further updates regarding, the January transfer window.\n\nAlthough the club has not yet signed any new players, it did say goodbye to Brandon Cooper, who has moved on a permanent transfer to Leyton Orient.\n\nBrandon has been some servant for the club, having been in its academy set-up since the age of six. It is always difficult to say goodbye to players who have grown up with the team, but I would like to wish Brandon all the best with his new opportunity at Orient.\n\nCan I also take this opportunity to wish Swansea City Under-21s the very best of luck in their Nathaniel MG Cup final against The New Saints. The game kicks off at 5.30pm at Jenner Park in Barry this evening. It’s been a fantastic cup run for them this season and it would be great to see them bring the trophy home to Swansea.\n\nFinally, as our supporters know, this fixture is live on Sky Sports and, as such, has been moved to 12.30 pm kick off.\n\nWhilst the revenue generated from a game being picked for television coverage is welcome, I believe the EFL needs to do more to give advance notice to fans and work with the FSA to develop an approach which balances fan welfare with the need to bring the action to audiences around the world.\n\nDiolch / Thanks,\n\nJames\n\nBlaenhonddan Primary School came out on top and secured a special prize as a number of schools took part in Swansea City AFC Foundation's EFL Utilita Kids Cup finals, and got the chance to show off their skills at Swansea City Academy's Landore Training Ground earlier this week.\n\nTen schools from Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire were in attendance – having qualified via local heats – looking to earn a place in the regional finals.\n\nThe tournament gave participants the opportunity to use the professional facilities at the academy’s training ground, with each side facing off in a round-robin tournament, before semi-finals and a final.\n\nAdditionally, a number of academy scholars were on hand to provide advice, lead warm-ups and talk to the aspiring young footballers throughout the day as club, foundation and academy combined to give the schools in attendance a day to remember.\n\nSwansea City AFC Foundation education manager Ceri Phillips was delighted to offer the schools opportunity to use the facilities at Landore, and thanked the academy for supporting the event.\n\n“It’s a really key part of our calendar, it’s a break from working with the schools in the school settings when they get to take part in our tournaments, and we are delighted to have held this event in Landore,” said Phillips.\n\n“We are really grateful to have been here, it’s a fantastic venue and it’s great that our participants have had the opportunity to play here.\n\n“There was plenty of competitive football, a really exciting finish to the tournament and it’s been a great day overall.”\n\nThere were 13 scholars on hand to help as Iestyn Jones, Ramon Rees-Siso, Tom Searle, Callum Deacon, Sammy Henia-Kamau, Josh Pescatore, Teo Minchev, Aidan Higgins, Rohan Davies, Ewan Griffiths, Cameron Llewellyn, Jack Cooper and Aimar Govea all attended.\n\nHead of academy education Jordan Morris was delighted to see the young players engaging with the community and feels it is a key part of their development as people.\n\n“It’s been good seeing them interact with the community, Swansea City is a community club so to see these players interact with young people has been a real highlight and they will take a lot from this,” said Morris.\n\n“The academy players involved will have been in the same position as the participants at one point, so we just want them to share the message of enjoying their football as much as they can.\n\n“We want to work with the community to see our players outside of football and expose them to these environments and develop others along the way.”\n\nBlaenhonddan came out on top after a dramatic penalty shoot-out win in the final. They will go on to represent the Swans in the regional tournament.\n\nBut, as an additional reward for their efforts, they will also be part of the guard of honour for Swansea City's Championship fixture against Southampton on Saturday.\n\nBlaenhonddan's captain Osian was delighted to win the tournament and is excited to welcome the teams onto the pitch at the Swansea.com Stadium.l this weekend.\n\n\"We've had an excellent day, loads of goals, loads of fantastic plays and I just want to thank all my teammates, they've been excellent and I'm just landed,\" said Osian.\n\n\"I'm so excited to be part of the guard of honour, I'm so pleased that we've won and just excited for Saturday.\"\n\nLuke Williams is a matter of weeks into his tenure as Swansea City head coach and his excitement is tangible. Here, he reveals why the lure of a return to SA1 was just too strong to turn down, the emotional connection he wants to foster between the Jack Army and their team, and how spending time working as a minibus driver and loading lorries at a warehouse fostered a hunger to achieve that has never left him.\n\nIn a modern age where discussions about football so often centre on systems, formations, structures and patterns, Xs and Os, there is something endearingly refreshing about the way Luke Williams’ eyes visibly light up when he talks about what he wants to achieve at Swansea City.\n\nThe 43-year-old is just a couple of weeks into his tenure as head coach at the Swansea.com Stadium, having returned to the club where he previously worked as an assistant head coach.\n\nIt has been a whirlwind period for the new Swans boss, who joined the club following a successful and record-breaking 18-month spell at Notts County.\n\nThat side secured a club-record points haul of 107, scored a record 117 goals – making them the topscorers in English football last term – and lost just three league games all season on their way to promotion.\n\nWilliams acknowledges it was only the pull of a club like Swansea that could convince him to leave Meadow Lane, and his feelings about the Swans become clear when he’s asked what he hopes to give the fans. It’s an answer that comes from the heart.\n\n“I want us to have a team that the fans connect with emotionally,” he says.\n\n“When you play football in a certain way that excites people and it makes them feel emotional, that is when those connections are made.\n\n“When you have a team that is positive and wants to score a lot of goals, and a team that has players working hard for each other, making big recovery runs and hunting for the ball, it gives a real energy.\n\n“I believe when people see and feel that, it is very powerful.\n\n“I remember from my first time here, beating Cardiff 3-0, and the way we played. When you do that, it’s impossible not to connect with the supporters.\n\n“When we scored the third goal that day, I turned round and was shouting ‘Come on’, and locked eyes with a fan behind the dugout who was doing exactly the same thing.\n\n“Those are the feelings we want people to have, and the connection we want to have.\n\n“We need to work really, really hard to ensure we make everyone proud of the team. That’s our mission here.”\n\nDuring his first stint in SA1, Williams helped produce a team playing a possession-based brand of football in-keeping with the best of the club’s recent traditions.\n\nBut his appreciation of what a Swansea team can, and should, look like predates his appointment as head coach by a decade.\n\nHe recalls a first visit to the Swansea.com Stadium in September 2013 for a Premier League fixture. Michael Laudrup was the Swans boss as they went toe-to-toe with Liverpool in an entertaining 2-2 draw.\n\nAnd it left a lasting impression.\n\n“The first time I came to Swansea was when Brendan Rodgers was in charge of Liverpool,” he said.\n\n“I came into the stadium, and I had never been here before. It just left such an impression.\n\n“It was really impressive and I had good seats and it just looked incredible; the lights were on, the pitch was immaculate. It just felt like a proper football ground and occasion.\n\n“Swansea were in all white, looking like Real Madrid, and Liverpool were in all red, the game started and Swansea started off really on the front foot.\n\n“They played quick combinations and the fans recognised what the team were doing.\n\n“It felt different, it was special and that was my first introduction and I never forget that night.\n\n“That’s what we associate with Swansea, playing attractive football but taking game to opposition and create opportunities to score.\n\n“But it was also the way the fans understood what they were watching, they were willing for the team to be patient and then explode into life when the chances created themselves.\n\n“I loved that, there was an acceptance and belief in it. It was special.”\n\nWilliams’ passion for football shines through, his hands are a blur of activity as he talks through his vision of the game, and his enjoyment of being out on the grass working with his players.\n\nThat enthusiasm and brightness is partly down to Williams’ experience as a player, where a chronic knee injury curtailed his aspirations following a stint in the Norwich academy.\n\nAs he attempted to switch to coaching, Williams spent time working as a mini-bus driver, loading lorries at a warehouse, and coaching a team of young offenders for West Ham.\n\nWilliams admits he was “lost” during that period of his life, but it has made him all the more determined and hungry to grasp and make the most of every opportunity that came his way.\n\n“Coaching was a way to make a living or, at the time, to sparsely make a living, to go out and try to do something positive and make a career,” he says as he reflects.\n\n“Then I guess I showed up enough and I tried hard enough that an opportunity came about, then another opportunity and another, and here I am today.\n\n“I heard the expression there’s no hunger in paradise and loading lorries at 5am in the winter months is not paradise, so then if you start to achieve more you don’t take it for granted.\n\n“The more you achieve, the more you want to achieve, so I’m hoping the start that I had and the journey I had will stand me in good stead to try and continue to appreciate and strive for more.”\n\nWilliams’ big break came when he was interviewed by then-Brighton & Hove Albion boss Gus Poyet, and coached their under-21 and reserve sides, all the time having regular access to and interaction with the Uruguayan and coaches Mauricio Tarrico and Charlie Oatway as the Seagulls started their climb through the divisions.\n\nA move to Swindon as assistant to Mark Cooper followed, with Williams also assisting Martin Ling before being handed the reins himself in 2016.\n\nHe left the Robins 14 months later, acknowledging it had been a tough and challenging experience, but he was soon back out on the training field with Bristol City Under-23s, winning praise from head coach Lee Johnson for his work in developing young players.\n\nStints at MK Dons and Swansea with Russell Martin, who is in charge of Saturday’s visitors Southampton, followed.\n\nDuring that first stint with the Swans, Williams helped deliver an exciting style of play that produced a number of eye-catching results and performances before departing the club owing to personal reasons.\n\nHe joined Notts County in the summer of 2022, and enjoyed a highly-impressive 18 months at Meadow Lane before sealing his return to the Swansea.com Stadium.\n\n\"I took something new from every experience I have had as a coach that I didn’t know before, and I tried to take at least one thing with me from each experience,\" says Williams.\n\n\"As long as there’s an opportunity to learn from that it’s all good. The last one was glorious and I’m hoping to recreate that again.\"\n\nInevitably his previous working relationship with Martin has dominated much of the talk in the build-up to this game.\n\nThe narrative has been shaped around Williams’ position as Martin’s assistant during those times at MK Dons and Swansea and, while the pair enjoyed their spell working together, he is keen to point out he had been coaching for a long time before the pair linked up.\n\nThere are similarities in their outlooks, but Williams is his own man with his own views on how the game can be played.\n\n“The notion that you only ever have one idea on what a team looks like is false,” says Williams.\n\n“We have some shared ideas, but we will have moved on from when we worked together because you constantly learn and evolve.\n\n“There is always evolution, they say a week is a long time in football so imagine the difference that can happen in the 18 months since we worked together.\n\n“Everything we have done since we worked together has given us different outlooks and tools to do the job.\n\n“I had been coaching for a long time before I met Russell, I met Russell on week two of his coaching journey.\n\n“He had great ideas, but I had been working at a number of different levels previously.\n\n“We shared a lot of ideas, we spent a lot of time together as were living in the hotel at the stadium at MK.\n\n“We spent a huge amount of time together talking about our ideas. It had a positive influence for both of us, and that’s the most important thing.”\n\nWilliams’ own positive influence has already been clear to see in his brief time as head coach, and as he departs ready for his next task those eyes again light up with twinkle of excitement as he sets about making those connections between supporters, players and staff.\n\nThis season marks the 30th anniversary of Swansea City’s first trip to Wembley for the Autoglass Trophy final in 1994. To mark it, our club historian Gwyn Rees takes us back through the story of that campaign and some of the key figures involved. Here, he profiles defender Michael Basham.\n\nAs a youngster Basham won no shortage of international honours, winning 14 caps for England at schoolboy and youth levels between 1989 and 1991.\n\nBasham, a Barking boy, signed on for local club West Ham United and went on to sign his first professional contract in July 1992 when aged just 19, but became frustrated as he found it hard to break into the Hammers’ first-team squad.\n\nHe joined Colchester United on loan, only for an injury to limit him to one appearance before he returned to Upton Park.\n\nBut Swans boss Frank Burrows had seen enough of the elegant defender, who was comfortable with the ball at his feet and was never afraid to receive a pass in tight situations.\n\nOn transfer deadline day in March 1994, Burrows got his man and brought Basham in on loan following injury to Keith Walker.\n\nBasham wasted no time making an impact, winning rave reviews for an accomplished performance on his debut away at Burnley.\n\nAfter just one further appearance he would be running out at Wembley as the Swans sought Autoglass Trophy glory against Huddersfield Town.\n\nHe would leave the home of English football with a trophy and winners’ medal to his name, and forged a solid partnership alongside Mark Harris in the Swansea defence.\n\nA full-time move following that summer, but Basham’s first full season at the club was affected by injury problems.\n\nHowever, he came back to put in a strong series of displays during a steady league campaign and an exciting FA Cup run, which saw the Swans knockout Middlesbrough before falling to top-flight Newcastle United.\n\nUnfortunately, niggling injuries continued to disrupt Basham’s time in Swansea colours and, after playing the humiliating 7-0 FA Cup defeat to Fulham the following season, he left to join Peterborough United on an initial loan deal.\n\nHe signed on at Peterborough in December 1995, but it wasn't until January 20 that he made his first-team debut in a 2-1 win away at Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nBasham continued to be plagued by injury and he would make 19 appearances for the Posh before joining Third Division Barnet ahead of the 1997-98 campaign.\n\nFor the first time in over four years the player was able to put together an injury free run of games, and he helped the Bees reach the play-offs where they were defeated by Colchester United.\n\nIn his second and final season at Barnet the club had a nightmare time. Basham remained a regular but was moved on to York City as the Bees headed for the indignity of relegation out of the Football League.\n\nThe move to York City initially worked out well for Basham, with the player featuring regularly in the side.\n\nBut financial issues at Bootham Crescent saw him loaned out to Chelmsford City before being released by York and making the move a full-time one.\n\nSpells with Thurrock and Gray’s Athletic followed before his retirement from playing, with that Autoglass Trophy success in 1994 being the sole honour of his long career.\n\nHalfway through the second half of a recent Swans match, the temperature started to fall dramatically.\n\nThe home side were trailing and the mood in the increasingly chilly stadium was plummeting with the temperatures.\n\nA fan near me stood up and started to stamp his feet in a bid to warm them by getting his circulation going.\n\nI’m not sure whether there is any scientifically supported benefit from doing this, but it’s definitely something I have done myself – especially when I used stand on the North Bank at The Vetch in deepest midwinter.\n\nIt seemed to be giving some relief to the fan as he continued to stand for a few minutes, shuffling from one foot to another.\n\nUnfortunately, his warming up routine attracted the attention of the stewards, who quite rightly pointed out that the Swansea.com Stadium is an all-seater arena and requested he sit down.\n\nThe fan explained he was just trying to warm up and politely pointed out that there was no-one sitting in the area behind him, so he wasn’t obscuring anyone’s view.\n\nHe also pointed out that just about everyone in the away end and the majority of the fans in the northeast corner of the stadium were also standing.\n\nThe stewards explained they were just doing their job and the fan complied with their request and sat for the remainder of the game – until the Swans equalised late in the game, which got the vast majority of fans out of their seats in celebration!\n\nThe exchange highlighted the difficulties stewards at grounds the length and breadth of the country face in enforcing the no-standing policy at all-seater stadiums and the frustration it sometimes causes when fans see others standing in a ground.\n\nIt’s been something of an elephant in the room across the entire country where away fans regularly stand throughout matches, along with sections of the home support.\n\nHow are stewards meant to enforce the rule if hundreds, sometimes many thousands of fans in the bigger Premier League stadiums want to stand?\n\nI was reminded of the above exchange when the Swans announced last month that safe-standing areas are to be introduced at the Swansea.com Stadium next season.\n\nThe club should be praised for taking this step, which will see independent barriers installed in the north-east corner of the stadium, as well as a section in the north stand for away supporters.\n\nTheir introduction will mean 1,431 seats in the home section, as well as around 500 seats in the away end, will have safe-standing barriers installed.\n\nThis means almost 10 per cent of all seats in the stadium will have a safe-standing option from the start of the 2024-25 season.\n\nTicket holders in the safe-standing sections of the stadium will still have a seat, but the independent barriers will give supporters in these areas the option to stand safely during matches.\n\nThe club has said it will introduce a code of conduct for the standing areas, which will be shared with fans before the start of next season.\n\nThe success of safe standing will depend on us supporters. It’s down to all of us to make sure the code of conduct is adhered to wherever we are in the stadium.\n\nWe shouldn’t forget why all seater stadiums were introduced in the top two divisions in 1994, when legislation came into force in the wake of the Taylor Report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.\n\nThe safety of fans must always come first. None of us ever wants to see the kind of tragedy that unfolded on that fateful day in Sheffield all those years ago.\n\nIt’s important all of us who won’t be in the safe standing areas stick to the all-seater rules which will continue to apply in all other parts of the stadium.\n\nAnd, of course, it’s vital those using the new areas stick to whatever code of conduct the club introduces.\n\nI have to admit, having spent all my Swans supporting days at the Vetch on the terraces, I wasn’t looking forward to taking my seat at our new stadium back in 2005.\n\nSince I first went to the Vetch in 1978, I had variously stood on the old East Terrace, which was little more than a big mound of earth and some railway sleepers, the bottom tier of the Double Decker, and of course the North Bank.\n\nApart from once sneaking into the top tier of the Double Decker as a teenager for the second half of a Welsh Cup tie against Shrewsbury, I never sat in any of the stands at the Vetch.\n\nSo the prospect of having to sit down for matches in the new stadium didn’t exactly fill me with joy.\n\nBut, almost 20 years later, I have to admit I’m a total convert to the experience of sitting down at a football match.\n\nThat may have something to do with my advancing years! But there will also be many younger fans who visit the Swansea.com Stadium, who will have never experienced standing on a terrace and have no desire to stand at a game.\n\nNo matter what your view on the subject, there is no doubt that modern all-seater stadiums like the Swansea.com Stadium have enhanced the matchday experience in so many ways – not just improving safety.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that those who do want to stand at matches should be denied that experience – especially now there is an option to do so safely. So, well done to the Swans for providing that option from next season.\n\nWhatever your choice next season, let’s make sure we all stand, or sit, together and make sure the Swansea.com Stadium continues to be a safe place for everyone to cheer on the team.\n\nCome on you Swans!​​​​​​​\n\nDate of Birth\n\n28/10/2003\n\nPosition\n\nWinger\n\nRight or Left-footed?\n\nLeft\n\nNationality\n\nScottish\n\nSigned for the Swans\n\n2023\n\nPrevious club\n\nKilmarnock, Manchester City\n\nBest moment as a Swan\n\nBeing on the bench for the first team, and playing in a 10-1 win for the under-21s.\n\nFavourite thing about Swansea\n\nThe people, everyone here has been really friendly to me and it’s a lovely place to live in.\n\nFootball idol\n\nLionel Messi\n\nFavourite Film\n\nThe 50 Cent one, Get Rich of Die Tryin’\n\nFavourite music artist\n\nLil Baby\n\nCheat Meal\n\nHas to be a Domino’s!\n\nBest subject in school\n\nP.E.\n\nFootball Bucket List\n\nPlaying for Scotland, and to play at the highest possible level in club football.\n\nA stadium you would love to play in or visit\n\nNou Camp\n\nFirst football memory\n\nThe first game my father took me to when I was six or seven; Rangers v Aberdeen.\n\nFirst football shirt\n\nIt was a Rangers shirt, or might have been an Argentina kit.\n\nOther positions you’ve played\n\nLeft-back, central midfield.\n\nAny other sports you play\n\nI like boxing, I used to do some in the gym as a kid.\n\nFavourite shirt number\n\nSeven or 11\n\nRoommate for away games\n\nIt was Azeem Abdulai because I knew him before I moved to Swansea.

It was You’re So Vain, by Carly Simon.\n\nSwansea City Women continued their excellent run of form as they beat Cardiff Met Women in their first Genero Adran Premier fixture of 2024 thanks to second-half goals from Robyn Pinder and Katy Hosford.\n\nThe Swans had been frustrated after a number of first-half chances went astray, with Lucy Finch and Hosford coming the closest to finding an opener.\n\nBut Pinder would break the deadlock six minutes into the second period, hitting a stunning strike into the top-left corner to give her side a deserved lead.\n\nHosford then netted twice in the space of three minutes to make the lead unassailable and secure three points.\n\nThe Swans went into the game off the back of a dominant 5-0 win over Cardiff Met a week ago in the Genero Adran Trophy, but the visitors were bolstered by the returns of Grace Corne and Ingrid Aadland, as well as the addition of Nieve Jenkins.\n\nThe Swans started positively as captain Hosford tried an effort from a tight angle that found the side-netting inside the opening three minutes.\n\nSammy Wynne then found time on the edge of the box after some nice passing interplay, but the midfielder’s effort went just over the bar.\n\nFinch came closest in the first half, a low effort from range forcing a good low save from the keeper.\n\nPinder thought she had given the Swans the lead, picking up a loose ball in the box following a corner to find the net, but she was judged to have been offside.\n\nJenkins had an opportunity for the visitors, her low effort forcing a good save from Chelsea Herbert, who pushed the ball around the post.\n\nBut the Swans responded and ended the half by creating two further chances. Hosford struck the post after getting into space down the left, while she and Stacey John-Davis were unable to convert after excellent pressing had won the ball back in the Met penalty area.\n\nThe dominance of the Swans continued in the second half, John-Davis sending a strike wide after being set up by Chloe Chivers.\n\nBut the hosts would finally get the breakthrough after 51 minutes, an excellent tackle from Ellie Lake winning the ball high up the pitch before Pinder hit a stunning strike into the top left corner of the net.\n\nHosford came close to doubling the advantage eight minutes later, rounding the goalkeeper only to see her effort cleared off the line by Sally Grimm.\n\nWynne then came close again, a nice bit of footwork finding her space in the box, but her strike would go over the bar.\n\nHowever, the Swans would soon have their second, a great ball from Chivers picked out Hosford and she steered the ball into the net with her left foot.\n\nThree minutes later the skipper would have a second, a cross from Lake setting her up to fire home.\n\nHosford almost had a hat-trick just three minutes later, turning her marker well before striking just past the post.\n\nPinder came close to her second goal in the final moments of the game following a great flick from Hosford, but nevertheless the Swans ran out comfortable winners.\n\nSwansea City Women: Chelsea Herbert, Lucy Finch, Steph Turner, Ellie Lake, Rachel Cullen, Robyn Pinder, Chloe Chivers, Katy Hosford (captain), Stacey John-Davis (Imogen Harris 89), Sammy Wynne (Emily Thomas 78), Sophie Brisland-Hancocks.\n\nUnused subs: Monet Legall, Kelsey Thomas, Halle Brace.\n\nCardiff Met Women: Carys Gittins, Sally Grimm, Anna Houghton, Tiggeraa Webb, Grace Corne, Emily Bayliss, Ellie Preece (Ingrid Aadland 46), Chelsea Cochrane (Eve Pearson 68), Esme Kliburn-Thompson, Nieve Jenkins, Erin Murray.\n\nUnused subs: Daisy Farrow, Leah Samuel, Kennesha Nanette.\n\nDo you have a nickname?\n\nSherbs\n\nYour date of birth\n\n16/11/2000\n\nYour nationality (according to UEFA)\n\nWelsh\n\nWhat position do you play?\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nWhich is your preferred foot?\n\nBoth\n\nWhich clubs did you play for before joining Swansea City?\n\nPort Talbot Town, Abergavenny Town, Barry United\n\nWhen did you sign for the Swans?\n\n2022\n\nWhat is your best moment in a Swansea City shirt?\n\nMy first league game which was against Pontypridd United.\n\nWhat is your favourite thing about playing for Swansea City?\n\nI’ve been a supporter of Swansea City for 18 years - and being able to play for them is the best feeling!\n\nWho is your football idol?\n\nNathan Dyer\n\nWhat is the first position you played in football?\n\nStriker!!\n\nWhat is your first memory of football (either watching or playing)?\n\nGoing to watch Swansea against Cardiff away for the first time, with a last minute 3-2 win.\n\nWhat is the first football shirt you owned?\n\nLiverpool\n\nDo you have any pre-match rituals or superstitions?\n\nI always listen to upbeat music before games.\n\nWhat is your full-time occupation?\n\nPolice Community Support Officer (PCSO)\n\nWhat is an interesting fact about you?\n\nI like to draw in my spare time.\n\nWho is the most famous person you've met?\n\nI met David Seaman in a goalkeeper camp.\n\nWhat is something that is on your bucket list?\n\nTo travel as much as possible.\n\nWhat is your favourite film?\n\nScream 1996.\n\nWho is your favourite music artist?\n\nRight now?
