Speaking on his new deal, Stansfield told the club website: \"I'm buzzing. I love it here, it really feels like home and I can’t wait to be able to come back next season a better player and hopefully play in front of everyone at Craven Cottage. \"It’s such an amazing club and I can see myself hopefully scoring many goals here.\"",

        "text": "Jay Stansfield has committed his future to Fulham by signing a new four-year deal, with a club option for an extra year.\n\nThe 20-year-old forward, who attracted interest from 12 Championship clubs, has also joined Birmingham City in a season-long loan move.\n\nThe England Under-20 international spent last season on loan at Exeter City — the side his father, Adam Stansfield, played for at the end of his playing career.\n\nSpeaking on his new deal, Stansfield told the club website: \"I'm buzzing. I love it here, it really feels like home and I can’t wait to be able to come back next season a better player and hopefully play in front of everyone at Craven Cottage.\n\n\"It’s such an amazing club and I can see myself hopefully scoring many goals here.\"\n\nIn addition to Mitrovic's departure, Fulham saw Layvin Kurzawa, Cedric Soares and Daniel James return to their parent clubs after their loan spells, while Shane Duffy, Neeskens Kebano and Manor Solomon left at the expiration of their contracts for Norwich, Al Jazira and Tottenham respectively.\n\nFulham have signed Calvin Bassey, Raul Jimenez and Adama Traore during this transfer window and they still retain all but one (Mitrovic) of their regular first team starters from last season.\n\nTheir success saw key personnel attract interest this summer, including Silva himself, who has not committed to a new contract despite turning down offers from the Saudi Pro League. He confirmed earlier this month that talks are ongoing.\n\nSilva said it is difficult to persuade players to sign when business is left late but also stressed that he is not panicking: \"I said last season that we can't stand still. Because if you think that's enough, that will be the first mistake to be in trouble. I want the best for the club, the players, the fans. I want everyone to support. The squad is far from complete. (But) worried is too strong. I'm confident, we have to get the players we need. We have a group of players who are really humble and ambitious. They showed their quality. We just need the right people to do a very good season again\"\n\nAs we reported earlier, Manchester City have completed the signing of Jeremy Doku from Rennes on a five-year deal, but what does he need to work on?\n\nUpgrading his off-ball movement in the final third and being more of a threat towards the back post will expand Doku’s skill set and, in theory, help him rack up impressive attacking numbers in 2023-24.\n\nBut for now, it’s all about enjoying his slick dribbling. If you’re fast enough to catch them that is.\n\nRead more about Man City's new signing below\n\nLeeds United will look to finalise the signing of Joel Piroe in the next 24 hours after agreeing a deal with Swansea City for the striker.\n\nUnited are close to landing a major target and their biggest deal of the summer following productive negotiations over the 24-year-old’s signature.\n\nLeeds are ready to pay in excess of £10million for Piroe who has less than one year left on his contract at Swansea and recently refused the offer of a new deal with the club.\n\nPiroe’s switch is still subject to the completion of a medical but Leeds are willing to meet his demands and are working to wrap up the move ahead of Saturday’s game at Ipswich Town.\n\nHe would become their fifth summer signing, following goalkeeper Karl Darlow, defenders Sam Byram and Joe Rodon and midfielder Ethan Ampadu into the club.\n\nLeeds spent £7m to secure Ampadu from Chelsea but Piroe’s fee would exceed that amount, with United and Swansea believed to have settled on a £12m fee.\n\nSouthampton and Leicester were both keen on Piroe but have not firmed up their interest at this stage or moved to rival Leeds’ bid.\n\nUnited, meanwhile, are being strongly linked with Bayern Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri, with sources in Germany claiming the Germany international is open to moving to Elland Road and the Championship.\n\nAmiri had been expected to join Marseille but that option appears to have collapsed after Marseille switched their attention to Inter Milan’s Joaquin Correa.\n\n(Additional reporting: Stuart James)\n\n“When you’re one-on-one with him, there’s only one thing left to do — pray,” Thierry Henry has said of Jeremy Doku, whom he worked with for the Belgium national team.\n\nThere is more lofty praise, too.\n\n“Recently, I was speaking with my father about a player who impressed me because of his speed qualities, that is Doku, at Rennes.” That was from Kylian Mbappe in 2021.\n\n“In five years as a professional, I have never seen someone from a standing start demonstrate so much power.”\n\nManchester City's new signing comes with eye-catching skills and Pep Guardiola is excited by his pace, dribbling and ability to shoot with either foot — but the big question is how does such a pacy, explosive winger fit into this delicately balanced City side?\n\nManchester City have completed the signing of Jeremy Doku from Rennes on a five-year deal.\n\nThe Athletic reported that City had agreed a fee of €65million (£55.5m) with Rennes for Doku.\n\nCity winger Riyad Mahrez left earlier this summer before Kevin De Bruyne suffered a hamstring injury that could see him ruled out until next year.\n\nFollowing Mahrez's exit, Bernardo Silva and Cole Palmer have stepped in so far this season, while Phil Foden put in a man-of-the-match performance from a similar position in Saturday's Premier League victory over Newcastle United.\n\nDoku said: “This is a great day for me, both personally and professionally. Manchester City are the best team in world football, so to be joining them is something very special for me and my family.\n\n“I am a young player with so much learning and improving to do. Working with Pep and his staff, and playing alongside these world-class players, will make me a much better player. I feel sure of that.\"\n\nDoku made 35 appearances for Rennes last season, scoring six goals. He will wear the No 11 shirt at City.\n\nCity are next in action this Sunday away to Sheffield United.\n\nMarco Silva has expressed his frustration at Fulham's transfer window as the west London club try to strengthen their squad and replace Aleksandar Mitrovic.\n\nFulham sold Mitrovic for £45million to Al Hilal last weekend and are now in the market for a replacement, in addition to reinforcements in other areas. These are are believed to be in both full back positions, a midfielder and a winger.\n\n\"I think everyone understands that it should have been our priority last month,\" he said. \"Seven players left our club at the end of the season. We sold another player in Mitrovic. When you lose seven players, and another one, and we just signed three players. It's clear for everyone how many players we need and that we are really light.\"\n\nMitrovic has been an integral figure for Fulham since his signing from Newcastle five and a half years ago. However Silva is keen for the focus to not all be on a new centre-forward.\n\n\"We have more positions to cover,\" he added. \"If we are going to sign a striker, it has to be the right one. It has to be someone to come to have an impact in our squad. I don't want to sign players just 'to sign'.\"\n\nArsenal defender Brooke Norton-Cuffy has joined Championship side Millwall on a season-long loan.\n\nThe 19-year-old full-back spent the first half of last season on loan at Rotherham United, before joining Coventry City on loan for the rest of last season in January and made 45 appearances across his spells at both clubs.\n\nNorton-Cuffy first came to prominence with his eye-catching performances on loan at League One side Lincoln City in 2022.\n\nThe defender was also part of the England under-19 side that won the European Championships in the summer of 2022.\n\nArsenal are next in action against Fulham at the Emirates on Saturday while Millwall take on Stoke City at the Den on the same day.\n\nArsenal and Real Sociedad are in talks over a loan move for Kieran Tierney.\n\nThe Scotland international, 26, is yet to feature in the Premier League so far this season having not been included in either of the matchday squads.\n\nHis last appearance came in the FA Community Shield when he replaced the now injured Jurrien Timber in the second-half.\n\n“It’s not really up to me,\" Tierney said last month on his future. \"I’m happy, I’m working hard every day and getting minutes. I’m just trying to do as well as I can.\"\n\nReal Sociedad are 13th in the La Liga table after two draws from the opening two fixtures of the season.\n\nBayern Munich are set to sign Maccabi Tel Aviv goalkeeper Daniel Peretz in a deal worth €5million (£4.2m).\n\nThe 23-year-old Israel international is scheduled to fly to Munich on Friday morning for a medical with the Bundesliga side, and is expected to sign a four-year contract.\n\nPeretz enjoyed an impressive season with the Israeli Premier League side last season, as he kept 25 clean sheets and conceded just 32 goals.\n\nHe also made his senior international debut, before joining up with the Israel Under-21 side for the European Championship this summer.\n\nPeretz continued his goalkeeping heroics at the tournament as he saved three penalties — two against Germany and during a quarter-final shootout versus Georgia — helping Israel reach the semi-finals.\n\nBayern Munich have been in search of goalkeeping reinforcements as their No 1 Manuel Neuer continues his recovery from a leg fracture sustained last December.\n\nThe reigning Bundesliga champions won their opening league game of the 2023-24 campaign, with their next fixture against Augsburg on Sunday.\n\nAl Ittihad have already signed Mohamed Salah's former Liverpool team-mate Fabinho.\n\nTheir first real statement arrival of the summer was Karim Benzema from Real Madrid, but they have since added N’Golo Kante from Chelsea and Jota from Celtic.\n\nFormer West Bromwich Albion defender Ahmed Hegazi captained the side to the league title last season, their ninth such honour and first since 2009.\n\nEx-Wolves and Tottenham boss Nuno Espirito Santo is in charge.\n\nThey share the 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Sports City stadium with Al Ahli, but their biggest rivalry is perhaps with Al Hilal, which has been dubbed the ‘Saudi Clasico’.\n\nAl Ittihad sit top of the early SPL standings on goal difference, having won both of their games so far.\n\nTottenham Hotspur attacking midfielder James Maddison was not pictured in training today ahead of his side's visit to Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\nMaddison had a scan on Monday to assess a foot injury he sustained during last Saturday's victory over Manchester United.\n\nThe 26-year-old was seen leaving the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on crutches and wearing a protective boot, though he told reporters they were just a precaution.\n\nMaddison played the full 90 minutes against and was again impressive as Tottenham ran out 2-0 winners.\n\nSpurs coach Ange Postecoglou is due to speak to the media tomorrow ahead of the Bournemouth game and is expected to give an update on Maddison's condition.\n\n\"It’s important for me to be in a Muslim country\"\n\nMohamed Salah is the latest to be linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League, with Benzema's Al Ittihad again interested in a move for the Egypt international as we have just reported.\n\nKarim Benzema spoke of his faith as he began a rush of players to Saudi Arabia this summer and officials say they are targetting Muslim players.\n\nAli Humayun explores its significance in a billion-dollar football revolution, its role in the game's growth and what awaits Muslims and non-Muslims\n\nRoss Barkley could face his former side Chelsea on Friday evening.\n\nThe 29-year-old midfielder, who spent four years at Chelsea, joined top-flight newcomers Luton Town on a free transfer this month and is in contention to make his debut for the club when they make a trip to Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"He could indeed,\" Luton manager Rob Edwards said when asked if the England international was fit enough to be in contention.\n\n\"He's been training with us obviously now for a couple of weeks. We've been delighted with him. So he's certainly in the mix.\"\n\nBarkley, capped 33 times by his country, was a free agent after leaving Ligue 1 club Nice this summer.\n\nHe has made 232 Premier League appearances for boyhood club Everton, Chelsea and Aston Villa and played for England at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nAs we have just reported, Monaco and Arsenal remain in negotiations over Folarin Balogun.\n\nWhile his club future may be up in the air, earlier this year he made a decision on his international future by swapping allegiance from England to the USMNT.\n\nThe forward, who played for the U.S. at under-18 level before switching to England, could have represented either country as he was born in Brooklyn, New York but moved to London when he was two years old. He was also eligible to represent Nigeria.\n\nRead more below on his decision to choose the USMNT...\n\nMonaco and Arsenal remain in negotiations over Folarin Balogun.\n\nThe Ligue 1 side had a verbal proposal for the 22-year-old USMNT international rejected following a pre-season friendly between the clubs earlier this month before a written offer was also knocked back.\n\nMonaco’s sporting director, Thiago Scuro, has a strong relationship with Edu, his opposite number at Arsenal, and talks are ongoing between the clubs.\n\nMonaco are in need of striking reinforcements following Switzerland international Breel Embolo's ACL rupture, an injury that will likely sideline him for “several months”.\n\nBalogun spent last season on loan in France with Stade Reims, scoring 21 Ligue 1 goals in 37 appearances."
