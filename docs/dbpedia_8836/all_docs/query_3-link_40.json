        "text": "If you were to name the attacking force that won Yeovil Town the 2002 FA Trophy you would of course name the goal scorers from the final at Villa Park, Carl Alford and Adam Stansfield.\n\nBut there was a third prong to that attack, a man who didn’t even make the bench on final day – Kim Grant.\n\nGrant has played for both Luton and Yeovil over his long, illustrious career.\n\nThe Ghanaian began his football career with Charlton where he made quite an impact and clocked up way over 100 appearances for the Addicks.\n\nWhen he left in 1996, he would join Saturday’s visitors Luton Town in a deal worth somewhere in the region of £250,000.\n\nNearly 50 games and a handful of goals for Luton followed in a spell that lasted over a year.\n\nGrant’s career path between Luton and Yeovil takes in five sides in three countries.\n\nHe moved to Millwall in a transfer with another six-figure fee attached, before a short loan stint at Notts County, he then headed to the Belgian Premier League to play for KFC Lommel before a very brief spell in Portugal with FC Marco.\n\nEngland would come calling again soon enough however when Scunthorpe United brought him back into the Football League system.\n\nJust five appearances for the Iron followed before Yeovil took their chance to sign the front man.\n\nIt was during his spell at Yeovil where he would win the FA Trophy scoring the first goal in the First Leg of the semi-final win over Burton Albion.\n\nA year later, he was part of the side who won promotion to the Division Three for the first time in the club’s history.\n\nHe was never the most regular member of the squad at Huish Park and having made more appearances from the bench than from the start during that second season he was back on his travels.\n\nPortugal came calling again before a season in Malaysia and a term in the Japanese 2nd Division.\n\nHe never actually got to play for the J2 League Side Shonan Bellmare instead deciding on a return to England with Gravesend and Northfleet.\n\nFour games for Wimbledon came next before he jetted off to Singapore splitting his time between two sides.\n\nGrant was capped seven times for his country before embarking on a career on the other side of the game.\n\nHe was initially a coach before starting his own side, FC Takoradi.\n\nHe remains the owner of the side and runs the academy alongside it as well.\n\nTakoradi play in the Ghanaian Division Two and have had another former Glovers, Abdoulai Demba on their staff roster.\n\nThe journey of Kim Grant may have taken him from Luton to Yeovil via much of the world, but your journey on Saturday is likely to be much easier."
