        "text": "A little boy had written a tribute to his hero and placed it carefully among the sea of flowers and football shirts strewn across the Big Bank.\n\nHe had put his card in a small blue frame and laid it lovingly on one of the shallow steps of the terrace at Exeter City's St James' Park ground.\n\nHe had begun with a formal heading and underlined it. \"Stanno - 1978-2010\", it said. Underneath, he had written out his meticulous message.\n\n\"Adam,\" he had written with heart-aching neatness, \"you were such a great player for all your teams. You were my favourite player and you always will be. You will never be forgotten. My favourite goals were the 2 you scored against Southend United.\"\n\nThen he had signed it. \"Josh Gilmour (Age 10),\" it said. \"A massive City fan.\"\n\nNow and again, a gust of wind caught one of the bouquets and sent it tumbling down the steps towards the goalposts where Adam Stansfield had often stood to take the acclaim of the supporters.\n\nEach time, a little girl who was wandering among the tributes with her father, ran after it, scooped up the flowers and put them back from where they had come.\n\nThe messages to Stansfield, the Exeter centre forward who was 31 when he died on August 10 after being diagnosed with bowel cancer near the end of last season, were glimpses of the life of a good man who was one of the icons of the lower leagues.\n\n\"Adam, you were my favourite Red Army player,\" a lad called Thomas Prout had written alongside a picture he had had taken with Stansfield.\n\n\"Thank you for sending me a birthday card each year. I shall remember the good times I spent with you when I was mascot. I will miss you so much.\"\n\nAll the messages had been written with pride and devotion. They lay there on that terrace, either on the steps or taped to the stanchions, like silent witnesses, gazing out over the Exeter skyline towards the rugged hills of Dartmoor in the distance.\n\n\"Adam,\" Kirstie had written, \"you were the sort of player us fans dream of - one who would always give everything out on the pitch. You were a true gentleman off it and always had time for us. We will miss you so much.\"\n\nHis commitment and his unswerving determination was what the Exeter fans loved their number 9 for. That came through again and again.\n\n\"You were wonderful to watch and gave everything to the very end,\" Paul Mason's message read. \"You represent (and always will) everything that is good in football. God Bless and Thank You.\"\n\n'To the very end', he wrote, and he was right. Stansfield was diagnosed with bowel cancer in April and despite surgery that appeared to have been successful, the cancer returned and his health deteriorated.\n\nBut a few weeks before he died, Stansfield turned up with the rest of the Exeter players for the first day of pre-season training.\n\nNo one had expected to see him there but he had always been the best runner and the most tireless grafter at the club and he dragged himself through the session.\n\n\"It was a gesture that showed everyone he was still around,\" said Steve Perryman, the Spurs legend who is now Exeter's director of football.\n\n\"He trained and then he was bombarding the manager, Paul Tisdale, with questions. He wanted to know all about the team. What combination of strikers the manager was going to use, who was looking sharp, what the prospects for the new season were.\n\n\"He was ill again by then but I'm not surprised he did the session. Stan was a runner. He pulled the rest of the team along. The more tired he was, the more he ran. He was the engine of our train.\n\n\"He was honest, too. The last game he played for us was at Wycombe near the end of March. It wasn't one of his best games and the manager brought him off after an hour.\n\n\"When he got to the touchline, I said 'Well done, Stan' just for something to say really because I liked the guy but he looked at me and shook his head.\n\n\"'No,'\" he said. \"'I didn't have the legs'. I wonder if that was when he began to realise something was wrong. Maybe that was the start of his cancer showing up.\n\n\"He was so honest that sometimes we found it exasperating. It wasn't that we wanted him to cheat but sometimes he'd be clipped in the box and he still wouldn't go down. It would have been easier to go down than stay up.\n\n\"He was old school in other ways, too. If he was hurt, he didn't want his opponent to see he had been hurt. I'd be standing on the touchline, yelling at him to stay down to get treatment but he would not stay down. He refused to stay down.\"\n\nLast Saturday, before Exeter's home game with Bristol Rovers, the club staged a minute's applause for Stansfield and announced that the number 9 jersey he wore had been retired in his honour.\n\nThis afternoon at his funeral, his coffin will be carried in a hearse from St James' Park to Exeter Cathedral before his wife, Marie, their three young children and family and friends attend a private service in Tiverton.\n\nStansfield did not live in a flash house or drive a flash car. He lived on a nice, neat estate in the Devon town where he was born and he played out his career in the Conference and Leagues One and Two with Yeovil Town, Hereford United and Exeter.\n\nThe reaction to his death, the way that it stunned the city where he played, emphasised again that the small clubs struggling to survive in England's lower leagues are still central to the identities of the communities in which they are based.\n\nClubs like Exeter have had to fight tooth and nail for their very existence and men like Stansfield, who helped to lead them back into the Football League, have established a bond with their communities that most Premier League stars never will.\n\nStansfield meant more to the fans of Exeter City than most of the rootless multi-millionaire players of the Premier League will ever mean to their supporters.\n\nHe scored 39 goals in 150 appearances for the club, a relatively modest return for a centre forward, but the way he played and the commitment he showed touched a nerve with the fans who watched him and idolised him.\n\n\"It has always interested me why fans link themselves to certain players and latch on to them,\" Perryman said. \"Stan had a lot going for him. He was local and he was an Exeter supporter. He was proud to wear the shirt. That all helped.\n\n\"But it was the way he played the game, too. If the fans had an image of the player they would like to be, it was Stan. They couldn't dream of being someone like Glenn Hoddle because Hoddle was like a magician from another planet.\n\n\"But the main part of Stan's game was his effort and his willingness to run for 90 minutes. That's what every fan imagines he would do if he could play for his club and so they associated themselves with him.\n\n\"I think seeing the tributes to Stan has made a lot of people at this club, and elsewhere, too, think about the time when this eventually happens to them and how they will be remembered.\"\n\nThe bouquets, the cards of tribute, the red Exeter shirts, the scarves left by fans of other clubs, the books of condolence and the inflatable football bobbing around on a piece of string have been removed from the Big Bank now.\n\nSome of them will be laid in Exeter Cathedral today. Maybe the mourners will see the message from Josh Gilmour in its blue frame. Maybe they will see the picture of Thomas Prout, smiling alongside his hero.\n\nAnd maybe they will read a message that carried no signature. \"Stanno,\" it read, \"you are, and always will be, a City legend. You were a special player in a game that is full of people who only think they are special.\""
