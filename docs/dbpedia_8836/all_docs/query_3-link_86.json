        "text": "Lillywhites? No Thanks!\n\nHuw Williams provides his weekly look at club events, this time focusing on the nickname.\n\nSo we are to be Lillywhites again. We hear that the team's unanimous choice was the all white strip. Perhaps we're going to be renamed Real Hereford. If so, I think we should be told. Apparently that's the reason that Leeds play in all white, having once been blue and yellow: Don Revie wanted to emulate the fabulous Madrid side of the fifties. Changing the shirts was as close as he got.\n\nI digress. Personally I think that the team are the last people who should be consulted. Hardly any of them have any connection with the club that goes back more than two years, so why does their opinion count? Most clubs have a poll of the fans if there's a choice to be made, and I think we should have had the chance to air our views.\n\nI can't say I'm too keen on the change, and I say we should have stayed black and white. It may have been our original colours, but apart from Bill Misery, there can't be very many current fans who have seen them play in all white. United have always been black and white in my time. I even liked the black and white quartered shirts which we sported for a couple of seasons back in the nineties, although I know they weren't popular.\n\nHaving said that, they are our team, and we'd support them even if they turned out in pink. Come to think of it, they very nearly did for a while. There was that awful away strip which had red and black diamond shapes all over a white background which gave an overall effect of a grubby pink. Thank god that didn't last.\n\nI hate the whole concept of an away strip as well. When I was a lad (I'm going into moaning old git mode now) clubs had a change strip which they wore when colours clashed, and only then. Why do we turn out in yellow when the opposition play in red, or blue? At least we don't have a third strip as some of the Premier clubs do, which the league allows them to wear a couple of times a season so that they can screw more money out of the faithful punters.\n\nI can cope with this change as long as it doesn't bring back the nickname to go with it. I vaguely remember them being referred to occasionally as Lillywhites back in the mid sixties when I started supporting, but I don't think anyone took it seriously? Let's face it, it's not too inspiring is it? I'm not even sure when we started being referred to regularly as the Bulls - it seems to have developed over the last ten years or so - but that sounds strong, proud, something you can feel good about shouting. But \"Come on you Lillywhites?\" Forget it.\n\nMonday Comment\n\nThis article has been written for Bulls News by Simon Wright of the West Bromwich Grorty Dick fanzine.\n\nRespect\n\nBack in my teenage years, those uncomplicated days that freedom that Shakespeare described as 'salad days', I had heroes. Dudley Tyler, Ken Mallender, Billy Meadows, Bruce Walker, Colin Addison - I thrilled to every move and every pass.\n\nAs I grew older and wiser, I no longer had any heroes for every idol seems to have clay feet. Respect for ability is as far as I would normally go but I was always willing to make exception for footballers who was as much a star off the field as on it. A move to the Black Country broadened my horizons. I never saw Jeff Astle play, save a few minutes as a fifty year old in a charity event but this guy will always be special as a man. More latterly 'Super' Bob Taylor and Richard Sneekes also have natural charisma by the bagful. And up there deserving respect for his off-the-field charm is John 'Tucka' Trewick.\n\nI remember him first as a player in the late 70s/early 80s. He'd come to Albion straight from his North-East school but this was a time of plenty for the Baggies and Tucka always struggled to maintain a regular place either in midfield or at left back because he was up against England internationals like Derek Statham and Bryan Robson. I have two clear memories of that period, firstly John's spectacular afro perm and secondly his infamous 'Great Wall' remark. Tucka was part of an Albion squad who were touring China in ground-breaking fashion. This was big news and with the players travelled a retinue of journalists and a camera crew. To this day, JT maintains he was stitched up. He had a five minutes session with the TV people and replied to one question about the Great Wall of China with 'once you've seen one wall, you've seen them all.' It was a joke. Tucka had a great sense of humour but the effect was changed completely on the BBC documentary when the throw-away line is used in complete isolation. To this day, Albion supporters will regularly remind him of his faux-pas.\n\nTucka's playing career never really hit any heights after he'd left the Albion and he slowly moved onto the coaching side. He's so good at it. John's not a ranter or raver, his touchline suggestions are inevitably well reasoned and sensibly put. He likes and insists upon passing football. It provides more evidence that the best players aren't the best coaches.\n\nLet's be clear that JT is perfectly capable of coaching adults as well as kids. He's even had a couple of brief spells as Albion caretaker manager - and as he'll tell you himself - the team were unbeaten under his tutelage. His solitary game in charge against March 2000 against Tranmere somehow put the smile back into the club. The players responded to the rational promptings and played with the sort of style unseen for at least a year. \"It's no secret that I'd like to manage at some stage, to work at first team level,\" said John in an interview a few years back. \"I've tasted it on two or three occasions at WBA. With the youth team, though, there is a lot of satisfaction, it's a medium to long-term environment, there's not that be-all and end-all result at the end of the week which I miss.\"\n\nI've long suspected that Albion first team managers saw him as a threat with this charm and honesty. Several fell out with him and his final departure was a very shabby episode in the recent history of WBA. I know a little of what went on and I suspect much more but John is too professional to tell tales. One day he was there, one day he was not. Let's just say that Gary Megson isn't on his Christmas card list. A few months later, Richard O'Kelly was shoved out in an equally unsatisfactory manner. Since then the Albion Youth went into decline and Tucka hasn't had the best of times. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nDuring the all too brief days of Ray Harford managing the Albion, Tucka was his trusted assistant. With travelling a big issue for Ray from his Southern base, Johnny T took training by himself as often as three days of the week.\n\nBut it's his work with the kids when Tucka stood out. His budget was next to nothing and facilties and equipment down to what he scrounge, bed or borrow. He was fund-raiser, pitch-marker, minibus driver, diplomat, agony aunt - he did everything. Once I suggested to him as a joke that he and Richard O could get involved in a discreet nude WI type calender as a fundraiser. Tucka was so up for it that I had to back off hastily.\n\nYet he produced super players. Lads comfortable on the ball in any part of the pitch. Lads who'd played in a variety of positions and had a great admiration for their coach. The legacy of John and Richard O was largely wasted but in their time they'd bought on Danny Gabbidon, Adam and Jay Chambers, Chris Adamson and Adam Oliver (the latter's career ended at 20 due to injury) all made some impact at first team level but there were others who deserved a chance and never got one. Like Tam Mkandawire - John was full of praise for the lad at the age of 16. Going back to the 'Chambo' twins, they were bought up by their Dad to follow the Dingles of Wolverhampton and at the age of 15, the Dingles tried to poach them. The lads turned down the offer out of loyalty to John and Richard O. Parents, charmed by the silver tongue of John, not only got little Johnny to sign for the Albion, not only turned up to watch but got involved in the day to day tasks of making a series of youth teams work with no resource.\n\nSome of my favourite moments of 25 years of backing the Albion came with following Tucka's kids. In one memorable season, they won two knockout competitions, one of which was won at Wembley. The team spirit was exceptional throughout and you always felt that the management were genuinely pleased to see you there. Grorty Dick fanzine, in various partnerships did our bit to raise money, putting together over five grand in the end but the Board received the cash with no great enthusiasm so we gave up in dismay.\n\nPost-Albion, Tucka scratched around a bit as competition was fierce. The period that he enjoyed the most was as first team coach at Derby under Jim Smith. He had help with training and the best players he'd ever worked with. Sadly, Derby were in a mess and there is so much that training can do. John's worked with local colleges, done some scouting and final horror was taking a job at the Wolves Academy. He has bills to pay, I understand that (your favourite wine doesn't come cheap, eh John?) but the Dingles? Dear oh dear..\n\nIn this game it's as much who you know as what you know. Tucka has a lot of friends in and out of the game. Try Jim Smith, Cyrille Regis (an agent with a lot of young players on his books), Gary Hackett (Stourbridge manager), Chris Evans (Academy manager of First Division Wolverhampton) Richard O'Kelly of course and Super Bob Taylor (needs a club?) just for starters.\n\nJohn has a comfortable house in Solihull where he lives with wife Yvonne and a rather unfriendly cat. His son is or was at university. Believe me , you'll like this guy and so will the players. I can think of no one better to replace Richard O'Kelly.\n\nCourt report from Burton\n\nBelow is a report from the Burton Mail on the court proceedings after trouble at Burton football ground last autumn.\n\nA dozen soccer hooligans who caused \"mayhem\" at a Burton Albion match have been caged for a total of 13 years.\n\nThe thugs, some of whom were in their 40s, were sentenced to between nine months and two years yesterday for what Judge Paul Glenn labelled \"a significant episode of public disorder\".\n\n\"Football authorities have done a great deal to prevent offences of this type, but unfortunately some people do not get the message that football violence will not be tolerated,\" said the judge.\n\nThe violence erupted at Burton Albion's Eton Park stadium after Hereford United fans stormed the home supporters terraces, Stafford Crown Court heard.\n\nStephen Thomas, prosecuting, said a line of stewards trying to keep the thugs at bay was over-run and parents with children fled for safety as the fighting broke out.\n\nOne Burton fan, James Goldsmith, was punched and attacked by around a dozen Hereford fans and another man was kicked as he lay on the pitch.\n\nBurton fans in the stand made 999 calls to the police on their mobile phones. Mr Thomas said the Conference game had no police presence, only stewards.\n\nThe whole incident was captured on video tape, which was played back to the court.\n\nThe trouble began during half-time of the Nationwide Conference match in September last year, when Hereford were trailing 2-0 after having had a goal disallowed.\n\nHereford fans began clambering on security fencing separating them from a \"no go\" area and the Burton supporters beyond.\n\nTo shouts of \"let's get the bastards\", \"a group of around 40 Hereford fans, intent on trouble, climbed over the fence, over-running the line of stewards and charged towards other supporters,\" Mr Thomas said.\n\n\"Some Burton fans fled in panic, shouting and screaming. There was nowhere to run to as far as the Burton Albion fans were concerned. Children and pensioners were boxed in with this group running towards them. Some parents had to put their children onto the pitch, out of harm's way. Parents were seen shielding their children from what was going on.\n\n\"The group, the Crown say, were creating mayhem in that particular terrace.\"\n\nEven after the first breach, the violence did not end. \"Stewards managed to shove the Hereford fans back, but some of them came back across the pitch and attacked the Burton supporters. That was a more determined attack, worse than the first,\" said Mr Thomas.\n\nIt was during this second wave that Mr Goldsmith was assaulted.\n\n\"Some Burton fans were so worried they began telephoning police on mobile phones, telling them what was happening.\"\n\nEventually the violence died down and the stewards were able to push the Hereford fans back. The match, which had been held up because of the disorder, was then able to resume.\n\nJohn \"Tucka\" Trewick\n\nJohn Trewick, who is now 47, played at the highest level as a professional for 18 years. Amidst the clubs he played for were West Bromwich Albion, Newcastle United, Birmingham City and Oxford United.\n\nSince his playing career ended he has been coaching players from eight and nine years of age at Centres of Excellence and Academies to seniors and international players.\n\nHe was appointed first-team coach and caretaker manager at First Division West Bromwich Albion, replacing Steve Round.\n\nBut Trewick left The Hawthorns following Gary Megson's appointment as the new Baggies boss and joined Derby County\n\nAn Albion player through most of the 70's, John 'Tucka' Trewick worked with Albion helping players from the Youth and Reserve sides to the First Team. His move to Derby in January 2001 was a sad moment for many Baggies fans.\n\nHowever another change of manager meant that Trewick was sacked from Derby.\n\nTrewick said at the time: \"As often happens, the first team coach is often a casualty as well and that's what proved to be the case. It was a classic case of me joining the right club at the wrong time.\"\n\nInterviewed whilst at Derby County for Grorty Dick by Simon Wright, Trewick said\n\n\"I'm first team coach. No, not acting assistant manager or anything else. But what's in a title? There's just Colin Todd and myself and he's not looking to bring anybody else in. We get on really well together so it's fine. I'm really enjoying it and I've got a three-year contract which is about as secure as it gets in an insecure profession.\"\n\nAsked what training qualifications he held,\n\n\"I hold the UEFA 'A' licence. I'm thinking about taking the new Pro Licence course. That's partly delivered over the Internet so that's a bit of problem to me as I'm the world's worst on the Net. It's a distance learning course over twelve months and it includes a couple of weekend seminars. Oh and I must visit a foreign club - like Juventus or Barcelona - tough one huh? - to study their coaching methods and then compile a report.\"\n\nObviously you work with the first team, but you must have had a peek at the Derby Academy?\n\n\"Well not really because they're completely separate and they train in a different ground. All the staff and players report to the old Baseball Ground? It's a bit shabby now but it's still a fantastic facility for the young lads. As I said, they have their own set-up and their link is with the reserve team coach. If they have any lads they want to push forward, it's him that they liaise with.\"\n\nRecently he gave a One on One Skills Coaching course to the Evesham's junior section coaches.\n\nThe course run by Premier Skills and funded through the Open Colleges Network aims to give as much help, back-up and information to grass roots football.\n\nLasting 20 hours over two weekends, with both practical and classroom tuition, United's coaches were instructed on many issues including role and function of the coach, football philosophy, child protection, health and safety, diet and nutrition, analysis of individual players and teams, psychological factors and how to plan, prepare and deliver structured coaching sessions.\n\nSimon Parry, chairman of Evesham United's junior section, said: \"The course has been invaluable and, to have someone as experienced and knowledgeable as John Trewick instructing us, has been a real bonus. We all learnt a great deal and we will be putting it into practice.\"\n\nJohn Trewick looks like he will be an excellent replacement for Richard O'Kelly.\n\nFans hope to save Wrexham\n\nBulls News yesterday reported that near neighbour Wrexham Football Club have cash problems. The future of that club is uncertain at present as a property developer has become involved and there are fears that his aim is to profit from the current problems.\n\nAs a consequence of our report we have been asked if we would publish more on the attempt by fans at Wrexham to save their club. The article and petition have been published elsewhere and the support for the petition has been excellent.\n\nBelow is a resume of the situation written by fans of Wrexham. A petition has been launched to save the club. The address is http://www.petitiononline.com/WREXHAM/petition.\n\nTwo years ago the then chairman of Wrexham Football Club, Mr Pryce Griffiths, who was a real Wrexham supporter and had the best interests of the club at heart, was struggling to cope with the increased stress of running the club due to ill health and decided to sell his 78% of shares in the club to a Mr Mark Gutterman, a property developer, believing after several meetings that he would continue to look after the club and take it forward.\n\nAfter Mark Gutterman took over, the club won promotion back to Division Two and everything seemed fine, but no money was ever provided for transfer fees by the new chairman/owner and then starting in November last year the players wages started to be paid late and carried on being paid late until his sudden resignation last week. On several occasions the phones had been cut off and also the players had no hot water at the training complex at Colliers Park.\n\nA Mr John Reames had appeared on the scene over the last couple of months, claiming he was here as a favour to Mark Gutterman and was not receiving a penny for his help, and on Monday night at a board meeting called due to Mark Guttermans departure he was made Managing Director. He was previously involved at Lincoln City where he was chairman and their fans cannot believe he has been allowed to obtain a position of power at another football club.\n\nAmazingly, Mr Reames has admitted that Mark Gutterman was never owner of Wrexham Football Club and the owner is in fact a Mr Alex Hamilton, another property developer who is a close friend and business associate of Mark Gutterman, and Mr Alex Hamilton has admitted himself \"that he has no interest in football\". Mr Alex Hamilton also bought the freehold of the ground from Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries over a year ago for £300,000 and this was never reported in the local press along with several other very important issues regarding the club. The club had a 125 year lease agreed for a peppercorn rent, this is now worthless as Mr Hamilton owns both the club and the freehold and can do what he likes with them.\n\nAccording to Mr Reames, Mr Hamilton wishes to demolish the Kop and Yale stands during the season after next and rotate the pitch ninety degrees during the summer break to \"free up\" more space for redevelopment, once this is done Mr Hamilton will walk away from the club with a handsome profit leaving the club debt free. This will lead to the loss of the club car park and a reduction in capacity of the ground by 1500.\n\nObviously this is very worrying for any Wrexham fan as the current ground is a very good stadium and is better left as it is, and can it really be believed that all the work can be done while the team still plays at the stadium? Why do we need to build a smaller stadium on the same site allowing a property developer to walk off with millions in profit and pay off debts that have been created while he has been the owner, it just doesn't make any sense apart from someone asset stripping the land for their own benefit.\n\nThe obvious main worry is that once the work begins an excuse will be made that we will have to groundshare because of the work taking too long etc and we will never return as the land will be sold once we are off site, and for anyone who doubts this is a possibility, just ask any Brighton fan who are now fully supporting our cause as can be seen from the petition, along with fans of all other football clubs including not surprisingly Lincoln City.\n\nWrexham fans are currently now organising themselves to raise the money required to buy out the club.\n\nMonday Comment\n\nThis is the first of an occasional feature by Huw Williams.\n\nThe Future's Bright, the Future's White\n\nLooking forward to a new season has usually been a case of optimism that things are going to be different, followed by a sinking feeling round about mid-October that it's the same old mediocre stuff again. This time it really is different. Graham Turner gave us a team to be proud of, and came close, so bloody close, to getting us back into the league, and this time there's every chance we can go all the way.\n\nThe excitement is building already. Season ticket sales are up (credit to Parkabull for his tireless campaign on the forum!), most of the players we wanted to re-sign have done so, and GT has already added a couple of promising players to the squad.\n\nOK, so some players have gone. The only one I think will be really missed is Guinan, who was the best all round footballer in the squad. A lot of people have said that all he did was put away the chances others created for him. What a load of rubbish! You could have said the same about Dixie McNeil or Steve White, or even Gary Lineker for that matter. Scoring goals is not simple. It's about making good runs, reading the game, being in the right place, and then putting it away coolly, not blasting it over the bar and wasting someone else's good work. His support play, holding the ball and bringing others into the game, and passing were all good too.\n\nI think we can have confidence in Turner's abilities in the transfer market. Over the years there have been a few duffers, but his successes outnumber the failures by a long way. The profile of the club is raised now, and he can point to Parry's rapid rise as an enticement to young players, and to Guinan and Smith as examples of former league players resurrecting their careers. All these factors wil help him in getting the right sort of player to the club.\n\nHe has a clear idea of what he wants, and won't get just any old bloke who happens to be available. He had a radical change of approach two seasons ago, and started to bring in promising young, skilful players who had something to prove, rather than old journeyman pros looking for a final payday. This paid off, and the quality of the play at times has been outstanding. The only drawback to this style of play is that it needs everyone to be on form, if not passes start to go astray and the whole team loses its rhythm and shape. Teams that play the long ball, percentage football can carry a couple of players having an off day much more easily.\n\nWe all await the announcement of ROK's replacement eagerly. I met O'Kelly once, briefly, and his enthusiasm for the game was remarkable, plus he came across as a genuinely nice bloke. It's a great shame that he's gone, but it was a good opportunity for him to progress, and I'm sure we all wish him well. I hope his replacement has the same beliefs and carries on with the same style of play.\n\nThe drawn out 'will he, won't he? Matt Baker saga is infuriating a lot of people. To be fair, he's only trying to get the best deal he can for himself. I'm sure that many of the people who are moaning about a perceived lack of loyalty on Baker's part are some of the ones who gave him all the abuse when he had a bad patch in the middle of last season. It's a short career in football, and there's never more than a two year deal on offer, so I don't blame him for trying. However there comes a point at which he will have to make a choice. If he pushes his luck too far I'm sure Turner will tell him to take a hike.\n\nSo there we are. The core of a decent squad is in place. We need another striker, I think someone with a bit more height. I don't want us to become a long ball team, but we need some options when playing teams with 6 ft 4 in centre halves. I'd like to see a genuine left footer in the team, either in midfield or left back. Travis would be far better employed on the right side where he can get a decent cross in. We could even shuffle the back line across, put Smith at left back, move Green into a central position (he did a great job there when Tretton was sent off) and play Travis at right back. And we really need someone who can deliver a decent ball in from set pieces, which to be honest has been a gap in our armoury for a while (don't mention Rose, how he got his reputation as a dead ball specialist baffles me!)\n\nWe'll be good enough to be challenging all the way next season. We need to get off to a good start. We all know the cliché about a championship being a marathon not a sprint, but even in a marathon you need to get into your stride early. Also the team need our sustained support, we don't want all the whingers and moaners sounding off at the first setback.\n\nBelieve me, the future's bright.\n\nAny comments on this article are welcome on the Independent Hereford United Forum.\n\nExeter in trouble again\n\nExeter City are currently banned from signing new players and were hoping that agreements recently made with the FA would allow them to lift the ban reports the Exeter Express and Echo.\n\nThe club announced in April that it was on the brink of having the ban lifted - until ex-boss Neil McNab contacted the Conference to complain about the £17,000 he was still owed.\n\nNow that McNab's claim has been incorporated into their Corporate Voluntary Agreement (CVA), the Grecians thought the FA would cancel the embargo.\n\nBut the FA's compliance unit has now written to Exeter to tell them the ban must remain in place, because of the £7,629 owed to City's former assistant commercial manager Gui Rivaud.\n\nRivaud worked at St James's Park for just six weeks last year before being sacked by former chairman John Russell for alleged \"industrial espionage\".\n\nExeter vice-chairman Julian Tagg explained: \"I said to the FA's compliance unit that it was becoming ridiculous. It doesn't seem right that they can keep coming up with a new person to stop us from having the embargo lifted. When I started to have a real go at them, they said they would look at it again.\n\n\"We've got our solicitors looking at it, but we don't believe that he (Rivaud) is a football creditor.\n\nJohn Moules of the Conference explained that, because Rivaud was sacked rather than his contract terminated by mutual consent, he falls into the category of football creditor.\n\n\"This is an FA rule and a rule that the Conference aren't overly keen on,\" he added. \"We have treated Exeter fairly, as we would all other clubs, and we are just acting on the instructions of the FA.\n\n\"Exeter can get the ban lifted at any time as soon as the football creditors are settled.\"\n\nTurner looking for several players\n\nGraham Turner has said that he is still looking for several players to bloster his squad after signing Adam Stansfield earlier this week.\n\n\"The search is on to further strengthen the squad,\" Turner told BBC Hereford and Worcester.\n\n\"I want another mid-field player despite signing Craig Stanley, and I'm still not certain what Matt Baker is doing.\n\n\"He came back from America.I'm understood he was going to make a decision on his future. I think he is on holiday now, so the search is on for a goal-keeper should he be leaving us.\n\n\"We have got to make provision now for an alternative although I had been prepared to leave certain positions into pre-season and had a look at one or two players during that period. I would like to get the squad as near settled as we can before we begin pre-season and then keep the options open. If there are one or two young lads that are going to start pre-season with us, we will be able to have a good look at them and keep an option open if they are good enough and we've got room to take them.\"\n\nGoing back to goalkeepers Turner continued:\"I would like to get that position nailed down. Ben Scott last season was fairly consistent in his performances in the reserves. I'm sure he thinks he is good enough to take Matt Baker's place, but I think we will also take somebody with a little more experience and that's what we are working on at the minute. We definitely need to get that one settled.\"\n\nTurner said that he had not made any more signings as yet.\n\n\"We are talking to a number of players,\" said the Hereford United manager.\n\nO'Kelly talks about Hereford\n\nRichard O'Kelly has given a long interview to the Non-League Paper in which he admits that leaving Hereeford was \"a really hard decision because the job at Edgar Street isn't quite finished.\"\n\nAfter talking about the past season and that decision to send off Andy Tretton in the play-off game, O'Kelly looks forward and says that he doesn't think that with some people leaving Edgar Street it will mean the break-up of the squad. He takes Chester as an example.\n\n\"Chester missed out in the play-offs and then won the league the following season. It will be hard for the Bulls but I think they are more than capable of bouncing back next season and going on to win promotion. The core of the team is still there.\n\n\"Hereford will always look for hungry players and I would tell anyone who is looking to get back into the Football League that Edgar Street is the place to come, as you will get a chance.\n\n\"Graham runs it like a League club. He picks up a lot of players who have been discarded by clubs higher up and lets them use it as a vehicle to get back into the League.\n\n\"The players are given an opportunity to play and show what they can do and, if they leave and move on to better things, then Graham will shake them by the hand and wish them all the best.\n\n\"Graham wished me all the best when I told him about the move to Bournemouth, even though he swore a few times when I first told him.\n\n\"It was nice to know he thought so highly of me and I have left with his full blessing.\"\n\nMoving to the South Coast side with its higher standard of facilities will be a bit different for O'Kelly from Edgar Street.\n\n\"You used to have to fill in the rabbit holes, mark out the pitch and put the nets up every day. I'm sure that helped the team spirit as everyone mucked in and had a laugh about it.\n\n\"That great team spirit allied to the ability within the squad is why I'm tipping Hereford to be as strong next year as they were this season.\n\n\"I have given Graham a list of names who could replace me, and he has his own ideas too, so it is a case of watch this space.\n\n\"But I'm sure that whjoever takes over the role will still have a talented, hard working bunch of players at his disposal and I'm sure they will make an impact next year.\"\n\nPitman confident for next season\n\nJamie Pitmam has been talking to the Evening News about next season. He is confident that the Bulls will be a force in the Conference again despite losing several players and coach Richard O'Kelly.\n\nThe Hereford United midfielder said:\" We've still got a big core of the side we had.\n\n\"Hopefully we won't concede as many goals as we did early and we can look as solid as we did last year, especially at the end of the season.\n\n\"If we play the way we were playing, still create the chances and bring someone in to take them like Steve Guinan did, we can do well.\n\nLooking back on how well the Bulls did last season Pitman continued: \"With us doing so well it was inevitable that players will go.\n\n\"If perhaps we had gone up then possibly I think they would have stayed but you can't begrudge them wanting to progress their careers - good luck to them.\n\n\"Especially with the way we played and the football we produced we were always going to attract other clubs. You expect players to go, that's the way it is in football.\n\n\"Richard was probably the biggest loss out of everyone with his whole impact on everything that has been going on at the club.\n\n\"He will be a massive loss to us. But again it is another thing for him. There are not many opportunities come around when you are coaching and he deserves it for all the good work he's done with us.\n\n\"His whole enthusiasm for coaching and just everything he did helped create a big bond between players and management.\"\n\nO'Kelly settles in\n\nRichard O'Kelly has settled in at Bournemouth and spoken to their official site on his plans.\n\nNew assistant manager Richard O'Kelly has vowed to bring a unique brand of attacking football to Bournemouth's play next season. He said, \"Football to me is being entertained and scoring goals is entertainment.\"\n\nO'Kelly coached at Hereford last season and the Edgar Street faithful saw their team rack up 103 Conference goals during the season. O'Kelly said, \"I've this thing about football that as a player and as a spectator I've got to be entertained because if I'm not entertained then why do it? You may as well do a job you don't enjoy but I love football and have done for years. Football to me is being entertained and scoring goals is entertainment.\n\n\"A lot of my sessions will be based on forward movement although I think it is important that players know how to defend. Your first attacking moves start from a good defence so I am an attacking coach but it is important you have a good defence to turn into attack. Historically Bournemouth have always been a good footballing side with a reputation for playing football that is entertaining to watch.\"\n\nO'Kelly was announced as the new assistant manager on Monday and he added, \"My first impressions are it is a friendly club, very well run and a wonderful facility. I'd played down here a long time ago at the old ground and I had a \"secret\" visit a few months back just to spend the weekend with Sean and have a chat about things but that was the only time I'd seen the new stadium.\n\n\"Straightaway everybody's been very welcoming and the whole place seems like a nice place to work. My ambitions for the next twelve months are to be successful and I see success in exactly the same way as Sean.\n\n\"What we can control is the way the team plays, the way they prepare for games, the way the players look after themselves etc. What we can't control is the bounce of the ball, referees decisions and freaks of nature. Success is managing the things we can control and preparing ourselves for the bombshells and freaks of nature and coping with those.\"\n\nRound Two at Chester\n\nA Sports journalist has hit back at Chester boss Stephen Vaughan after a fracas at an awards dinner according to the Chester Evening Leader.\n\n\"You hear about hooligans in the stands but you don?t expect them to be running football clubs,\" said David Emery, editor of the Non-League Newspaper.\n\nMr Emery was giving his version of events after a bitter punch-up between the two men at an end-of-season awards dinner.\n\nMr Vaughan yesterday refused to apologise for his part in the bust-up.\n\nToday, Mr Emery said it was a \"rather unseemly squabble\".\n\nHe said: \"We ran a story about Hereford being owed money by Chester City and reported the comments of Graham Turner, as well as speaking to David Burford, of Chester City.\n\n\"At the dinner I went across to Stephen Vaughan and congratulated him on the championship.\"\n\nMr Emery told Mr Vaughan about the article that was due to be printed the next day.\n\nAccording to Mr Emery, the Chester chairman then asked him to \"go outside\" to discuss the matter further.\n\nMr Emery says nothing happened outside, but Mr Vaughan became angry and made threats.\n\nHe added: \"He said he was going to sort me out. At 1am I was leaving the dinner and walked past his table.\n\n\"I said good night and he took hold of my hand. We wrestled and he tried to aim a very slow butt at me, which I managed to get out of the way of.\n\n\"We both fell to the floor and he was pulled off me.\"\n\nMr Emery said he was not totally surprised Mr Vaughan had acted in that way.\n\nHe said: \"You hear about hooligans in the stands but you don't expect them to be running clubs. It was all rather unseemly. I was prepared to walk away and ignore the whole kerfuffle. We had already done our squaring up but he was not prepared to forget it.\"\n\nMr Emery is not taking the issue any further.\n\nMr Vaughan, a boxer for most of his life, said the row erupted after Mr Emery approached him and told him about an article about Chester City which was due to be printed the next day.\n\nThe article claimed Chester City owed £18,000 in gate tickets to Hereford United, a claim Mr Vaughan says is completely unfounded.\n\nHe said: \"It simply was not true, I told Emery he needed to get his facts right to start with. He was aware the money had been paid after a little bit of a delay because of new FA stipulations.\n\n\"The truth is Chester City owed Hereford United £17,200 from ticket sales from Chester City's last game of the season. Initially I had sent a cheque to Hereford in the name of the management,Vaughan trading.\n\n\"Soon after, we heard of the new FA rules stipulating cheques could not be paid by third parties, a letter of explanation and an apology was sent to Hereford along with a cheque transfer.\"\n\nThe fracas happened in front of club shareholders, directors and Blues player Daryl Clare, who was at the dinner to collect his Golden Boot award.\n\nMr Vaughan said: \"David Emery was just inviting trouble from the start. Words were exchanged, I made my views known and at the end of the night David came over and had a go at me. I hit him all I did was defend the club and I am not apologising for it.\"\n\nPunches thrown at Chester dinner\n\nA Non-League sports journalist and the Chester chairman came to blows at an end-of-season victory awards dinner reports the Chester Evening Leader.\n\nChairman Stephen Vaughan has refused to apologise for the bust up, claiming he acted in self-defence in the bust-up with the editor of the Non-League Newspaper, David Emery.\n\nMr Vaughan said the row erupted after Mr Emery approached him at a trophy dinner, telling him about an article about Chester City FC that was due to be printed the next day.\n\nThe article claimed that Chester City FC owed £18,000 in gate tickets to Hereford United ? a claim that is completely unfounded, said Mr Vaughan.\n\n\"It simply was not true. I told Emery he needed to get his facts right to start with. He was aware that the money had been paid after a little bit of a delay because of new FA stipulations.\n\n\"The truth is that Chester City owed Hereford United £17,200 from ticket sales from Chester City's last game of the season. Initially I had sent a cheque to Hereford Utd in the name of the management, Vaughan trading.\n\n\"Soon after, we heard of the new FA rules stipulating that third parties could not pay cheques and a letter of explanation and an apology was sent to Hereford Utd, along with a cheque transfer.\"\n\nThe bust-up happened in front of club shareholder directors and City FC player Daryl Clare, who was at the dinner to collect a Golden Boot award.\n\nMr Vaughan, a boxer for most of his life, said: \"David Emery was just inviting trouble from the start. He came over to me and introduced himself at the start of the evening as the editor of the Non-League Newspaper and he started telling me about an article about the club.\n\n\"Words were exchanged between us. I made my views known and at the end of the night David came over and had a go at me.\"\n\nMr Vaughan said that things then became heated, leading to a fracas.\n\n\"I hit him; all I did was defend the club that I support that was being accused of wrong-doing. I am not apologising for it.\n\n\"Earlier in the night Mr Emery had made a suggestion that there had been a rift between me and Graham Turner, the manager of Hereford United. That was completely wrong. I had had my photograph taken with him on the night and in a speech I said I was bitterly disappointed for Hereford, who had not achieved what they wanted to in the league.\n\n\"That man spoiled the enjoyment of what should have been a great night for Chester City FC, and I have since put the matter in the hands of my solicitor.\"\n\nMr Emery could not be contacted this morning said the paper.\n\nThe Price of Success\n\nThe recent departures from Edgar Street are only to be expected given the success of Hereford United last season. Conference sides now receive more publicity than in the past, especially with games being shown on Sky, and the standard of football has improved. The demolition of Dagenham by the Bulls will have been seen and talked about in many circles.\n\nTwo seasons ago, Graham Turner only retained six members of the squad and even one of those, Scott Voice, was soon off to a lower club. None of those released at that time has figured in any club in the Conference let alone a higher league since leaving the Bulls.\n\nNevertheless Turner, then joined by Richard O'Kelly, built up a side which was unlucky not to get into the play-offs. Brought into the side were players like Steve Guinan and Andy Tretton.\n\nToday, just like two years ago. there are plenty of players out there looking for clubs. But this time around a position at Hereford United will command more respect after last years campaign which raised the profile of the club.\n\nMany of the players who have recently left the club have moved on to higher clubs. Parry to Cardiff, Guinan to Cheltenham, Smith to Shrewsbury, Rose to Yeovil and coach O'Kelly to Bournmouth. How long ago is it since this number of players left to go to higher League teams?\n\nAnd for the first time since the early nineties, the club is paying its way. The CVA is close to being paid off, and the bills are being paid on time.\n\nHereford United has to be a selling club. The extra income from transfers allows the club to function. To be able to have players to sell, they have to be improved and a club like Hereford can do this.\n\nThe signing of Craig Stanley, announced yesterday, is another player who has the potential to improve and in time be sold to another club.\n\nTurner should be able put a side together that can mount a strong challenge again this coming season. More signings are on the way."
