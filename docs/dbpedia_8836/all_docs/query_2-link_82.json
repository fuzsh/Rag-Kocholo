        "text": "Image via Complex UK\n\n1.\n\nRetiring shirt numbers isn’t a widely practiced trend in the world of football. But when it does happen, it happens for good reason. Generally used by clubs to recognise a player’s loyalty or substantial service, it’s also an often practiced way of memorialising a player after death.\n\nWith a long steeped history in major North American sports, its fairly recent introduction into football occurred around the 1990s when squad numbers for specific players came into use. Before this time players would be given numbers dependant on where they lined up on the pitch (issued 1 to 11), meaning a player would have worn different numbers throughout the season.\n\nSince that time some of the sport’s greatest names have been honoured, alongside some more relatively unknown but loyal servants to their clubs. We pick out 15 of the most notable shirt numbers to have been retired.\n\n2.Diego Maradona\n\nClub: Napoli\n\nShirt number: 10\n\nNapoli retired the shirt number in honour of Maradona’s services to the club after he practically single-handedly led them to a maiden Serie A title in 1986-87 and a Coppa Italia. Playing 259 matches for the club and scoring 115 goals, he still leads the Italian side’s top goal scorers list to this day.\n\nThen in 2002, the Argentine Football Federation (AFA) omitted the same shirt number when submitting their squad list of 23 players, shortly before the World Cup in South Korea and Japan. The move was subsequently rejected by FIFA, with the ever-popular Sepp Blatter suggesting the shirt be given to the side’s third-choice goalkeeper. The number 10 has been worn by other players since, most notably by Lionel Messi, whom Maradona considers his “successor.”\n\n3.Gianfranco Zola\n\nClub: Chelsea\n\nShirt number: 25\n\nEnglish clubs don’t have a long tradition of retiring shirts, but one name that most people can probably agree does in fact deserve the honour is the former Chelsea maestro, Gianfranco Zola. Having joined the West London club in 1996 from Parma, the Italian striker adapted to the Premier League almost immediately and would go on to be voted the ‘Football Writers' Player of the Year’ later that season, the only player ever to win the accolade without playing a full season in the English league. In his time, the 5ft 6in Italian would score 59 goals from 229 appearances.\n\nBefore leaving the club in 2003, he was voted Chelsea's greatest player ever and although his famous number 25 hasn’t been officially retired, the shirt has not been has not been reissued since.\n\n4.Stilyan Petrov\n\nClub: Aston Villa\n\nShirt number: 19\n\nA more contemporary case is that of Aston Villa’s Stilyan Petrov, who was diagnosed with acute leukaemia mid-way through the 2012/13 season in March 2012 and subsequently decided to retire from the game.\n\nIn honour of the club captain’s services to the The Villans, Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert announced that Petrov would remain the captain for the remainder of the season, with Ron Vlaar stepping in take over the captaincy in his absence. Petrov attended the club’s next game at Villa Park against Chelsea, where the crowd gave him an ovation in the 19th minute, the shirt number he wore for the club.\n\nWith Stilyan Petrov having made a recovery, the shirt was brought back and given to Darren Bent in 2014/15.\n\n5.Temuri Ketsbaia\n\nClub: Anorthosis Famagusta\n\nShirt number: 14\n\nA memorable figure for Newcastle fans in the late nineties, the fiercely competitive Georgian Geordie is not only immortalised for his on pitch performances but also his bizarre celebrations, including throwing his shirt into the crowd and assaulting advertising hoardings at St. James’ Park.\n\nHowever, it was Ketsbaia’s services to another club, the Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta F.C., where he’s most fondly remembered after winning the Cypriot Championship and domestic cup as both a player and manager. They retired his shirt in 2010.\n\n6.Bobby Moore\n\nClub: West Ham\n\nShirt number: 6\n\nPossibly the most iconic English footballer of all time (sorry, Becks), Bobby Moore spent 16 years at West Ham, where he made over 500 club appearances. Moore was chosen in the ‘World Team of the Century’ in 1998 and had his number 6 shirt number retired 50 years after he made his debut for the East London club and 15 years after his death.\n\nIn honour of his services, two shirts bearing the number were handed over to Moore’s widow Stephanie during a friendly against Villarreal at Upton Park.\n\n7.Marc-Vivien Foé\n\nClub: Manchester City, Lyon and Lens\n\nShirt number: 23 & 17\n\nWhilst on loan at Manchester City, Marc-Vivien Foé was part of the Cameroon squad for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. Cameroon faced Colombia on the 26th June 2003 and in the 72nd minute of that game, Foé collapsed in the centre circle and later died in hospital, with an autopsy later revealing he had a rare heart condition called ‘cardiomyopathy hypertrophia’.\n\nThe death of the 28-year-old caused shockwaves around the world with many players paying tribute to his “joyous personality” and “infectious humour”. The evening of Foé’s death, France’s Thierry Henry and other French players paid tribute by pointing to the sky after opening the scoring against Turkey.\n\nBoth Man City and Lyon, his parent club, announced that they would no longer use the number 23 shirt. His first French club, RC Lens, also followed suit. Lyon brought the shirt number back for Cameroon international midfielder Jean Makoun, who honoured to play for the club in Marc’s memory.\n\n8.Roberto Baggio\n\nClub: Brescia\n\nShirt number: 10\n\nIn the twilight of his career and in search of regular football, Italian icon Roberto Baggio resisted offers to move abroad and transferred to top flight strugglers, Brescia. Baggio completed mission impossible with the humble side and kept them in Serie A for the first time in the club’s history, contributing 10 goals and 10 assists.\n\nBaggio, or ‘The Divine Ponytail’ as he came to be known, spent a further three years at Brescia before retiring in 2004. He may be more famous for his stints at Inter, Fiorentina and AC Milan but it was Brescia who retired the number 10 shirt in his honour.\n\n9.Javier Zanetti\n\nClub: Inter Milan\n\nShirt number: 4\n\nInter Milan retired Zanetti’s number 4 shirt after an incredible 19 years of service (just call him the Italian Ryan Giggs). He retired last season after winning five league titles, which included a historic treble in 2010, which produced Inter’s first European Cup victory for nearly 50 years.\n\nIn almost two decades at the club Zanetti made 615 Serie A appearances, by far the most of any overseas player in Italy’s top flight and second only to Paolo Maldini. He also represented his country 145 times.\n\n10.Henrik Larsson\n\nClub: Helsingborgs\n\nShirt number: 17\n\nHenrik Larsson is a legend in more places than only Glasgow. The Swede carved a legacy at Helsingborgs IF, where he was one of the key players when they won promotion to the Allsvenskan in 1993, before moving onto sides including Celtic, Manchester United and Barcelona, where he won two league titles and the Champions League.\n\nFollowing the expiration of his contract at Barcelona, Larsson returned to his hometown club of Helsingborg, where he scored a further 38 league goals in 84 games.\n\n11.Paolo Maldini\n\nClub: AC Milan\n\nShirt number: 3\n\nHere’s one shirt that isn’t fully retired. Maldini’s number 3 shirt was put on hiatus by AC Milan once the defender retired after 647 appearances over 25 years. And the only time the Rossoneri will see that shirt number again is if one of Maldini’s sons plays for the club.\n\nThis isn’t just a novelty bet. Paolo’s son Christian was most recently on loan at Brescia from AC. He would become the third generation of the Maldini family to play for the club after Cesare won the Champions League in 1963.\n\n12.Lukas Podolski\n\nClub: FC Köln\n\nShirt number: 10\n\nPodolski joined FC Köln in 1995 at the age of 10 and went on to break into the first team in 2003, making 81 league appearances for the club with 46 goals (earning promotion to Bundesliga along the way). After catching the attention of some of Europe’s biggest clubs, the striker moved to Bayern Munich in 2006 but after an unhappy couple of years at the Bavarians, he opted to move back to his childhood club in 2009.\n\nFollowing his move to Arsenal in 2012, FC Köln, out of respect for his loyalty and achievements for the club, chose to retire his famous number 10 shirt as long as he is an active player.\n\n13.Ramón Morales\n\nClub: C.D. Guadalajara\n\nShirt number: 11\n\nMorales was an inspirational figure for Guadalajara over 11 seasons, leading them to a Mexican championship as captain. His shirt was never officially retired but all players intending to wear the jersey have to go to the unusual step of asking for Morales’ consent. Currently, the number 11 is worn by vice-captain Jesús Aldo De Nigris.\n\n14.Gyula Grosics\n\nClub: Ferencvárosi TC\n\nShirt number: 1\n\nLegendary Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, the keeper credited with developing the role of a ‘sweeper keeper’, was at constant odds with the country’s communist government and in 1962, he was punished when the Hungarian Sports Ministry stepped in to stop his dream move to Ferencvárosi TC. He retired as a result.\n\nIn 2008, that wrong was at least partially righted when Ferencvárosi TC let the 82-year-old begin a friendly match against Sheffield United, before being subbed out for the club’s regular keeper a few minutes in. After the game, Ferencvaros retired the No.1 shirt in his honor and, every year, his name features on the list of players which the club sends to the Hungarian Football Association.\n\nGroscis died in June 2014 at the age of 88.\n\n15.Phil O'Donnell\n\nClub: Motherwell\n\nShirt number: 10\n\nMotherwell captain Phil O’Donnell tragically collapsed and died during a game for the club against Dundee United in 2007. While O’Donnell enjoyed successful spells at Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday, it was in two separate stints with Motherwell where he made his biggest mark.\n\nIn the wake of his passing, Motherwell opted to rename the main stand as the Phil O’Donnell stand as a permanent tribute. His nephew, David Clarkson, has been the only player to wear O’Donnell’s number 10 shirt since his death.\n\n16.Adam Stansfield\n\nClub: Exeter City\n\nShirt number: 9\n\nExeter City striker Adam Stansfield tragically lost his battle with bowel cancer in August 2010, just one month after returning to the club for the first day of pre-season training after what was thought to be a successful operation to treat the illness four months earlier.\n\nExeter subsequently announced that Stansfield’s number 9 shirt would be retired for the next nine seasons. The club have also helped to set up two separate charities in Stansfield’s memory, The Adam Stansfield Family Fund which has been set up to help support his widow and three young boys and The Adam Stansfield Football Foundation, which has been created to provide funding for youth-orientated footballing ventures across the South West of England."
