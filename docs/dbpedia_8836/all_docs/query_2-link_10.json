        "text": "Today, Tuesday, August 10 marks thirteen years since the passing of our much-loved striker Adam Stansfield at just 31 years of age.\n\nStanno as he was affectionately known, played 160 games for City between 2006 and 2010, scoring 39 goals. He was an integral part of the team that led City from the Football Conference to League One and was adored by the supporters for his tireless energy, eye for goal and personality on and off the pitch.\n\nTo this day Stanno remains in the hearts of all Exeter City supporters and always will. He was loved and respected by everyone that knew him. A class act on the pitch and off it.\n\nTo honour Stanno, the grandstand at St James Park was fittingly named the 'Optimising IT Adam Stansfield Stand'. If you visit St James Park, or in the away stands when City are on the road you will always hear 'Sing a song for Stanno'.\n\nLast season, Jay Stansfield payed Adam the ultimate honour in spending the season on loan at St James Park and taking the No.9 shirt in his memory.\n\nAn incredible season for Jay saw him net 9 goals in the No.9 shirt.\n\nFollowing Adam's death, the Adam Stansfield Foundation was created with the aim of helping give young people the unique opportunity to develop life skills through the power of football and to assist them in their goals of living the dream. Click here to find out more and see how you can get involved.\n\nCity fans Tom and Jack Vickery have kept his legacy alive through their incredible fundraising efforts that have seen them raise an incredble ammount for the Foundation."
