        "text": "Birmingham City have ended their striker search with the acquisition of Fulham youngster Jay Stansfield.\n\nThe 20-year-old has joined Blues on loan to become the club’s tenth signing of the summer transfer window. Stansfield follows Tyler Roberts, Koji Miyoshi, Kevin Long, Krystian Bielik, Ethan Laird, Siriki Dembele, Dion Sanderson, Keshi Anderson and Lee Buchanan to St Andrew’s this summer.\n\nHe has been signed to compete for a starting place with Scott Hogan and Lukas Jutkiewicz, but head coach John Eustace believes his new recruit can operate out wide too.\n\n“He’s a really exciting young player,” says Eustace. “There were 12 or 13 teams that were after him. It just shows how far Birmingham City has come for him to choose us over other Championship clubs.\n\nREAD: Birmingham City predicted XI for Plymouth without Ethan Laird and Siriki Dembele\n\nREAD: Birmingham City give Laird and Dembele injury updates before Plymouth\n\n“He can play in a number of positions; off the left, up front, as a 10, off the right. He’s a young, hungry player that we have been looking at for a while and we’re all delighted he’s chosen Birmingham City.”\n\nStansfield - who scored his first senior goal for Fulham at St Andrew’s against Blues in 2021 - made a name for himself on loan at Exeter City last season. He scored nine goals for Exeter, including a final day hat-trick against Morecambe, and registered seven assists in 36 League One matches.\n\nStansfield wore the number nine shirt at Exeter in memory of his dad and ex-Grecians striker Adam, who tragically died in 2010 at the age of 31. Stansfield senior wore the shirt with distinction and Exeter retired the number after his death in tribute to one of their most popular players.\n\nWhen Stansfield junior signed for Exeter last summer, he decided to take the shirt number. Now that Stansfield has departed St James Park, manager Gary Caldwell says the number will be retired once more.\n\n“That number nine is a special number for me,” Caldwell said. “It was Adam Stansfield’s number and Jay wore it with pride and did some tremendous things in it last season and that shirt is always there for a Stansfield if he wants to use it.”\n\nStansfield was only seven when his dad passed away. Speaking about his decision to wear his shirt number, Stansfield said: “I don’t normally speak about it much. I keep it quite close to my heart because I just want to be able to make him proud and live in my own footsteps. The crowd always sing dad’s song. When you come down and watch it’s the only thing you hear. When I came on, to see the fans make a new song, it was quite heart-warming.”\n\nHe has already made five appearances in the Premier League for Fulham and was an unused substitute in their opening day victory at Everton. Stansfield has made nine appearances for England’s youth sides since joining Fulham from boyhood club Exeter in 2019.\n\nThe 6ft 1in striker has sponged information from the array of stars he has played alongside in Fulham’s first team, including Aleksandar Mitrovic. Stansfield told Sky: “I have learnt so much over the last couple of years being able to train with the likes of Mitro. I can’t really put it into words, just being around them, not just on the pitch, but seeing the people they are in the changing rooms and away from football.”\n\nStansfield will write the next chapter in a career which appears destined for the Premier League with Blues."
