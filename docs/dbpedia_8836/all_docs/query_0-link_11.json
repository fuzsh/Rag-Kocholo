On September 6th, armed police attended an address in Honiton, following a call claiming that a person had been shot and wounded at a property. At around 9.45pm police made contact with the partner of the person who made the call and it was revealed that he was suffering with men¬ tal health problems and nobody had been harmed at the property. However, Stephen Hannay, 67, says that isn’t the full story and before the hoax phonecall case was solved, police had banged on his door and aimed their weapons at him. During his ordeal, Mr Hannay said police pointed their guns at him, escorted himself and his daughter away from their home, handcuffed him and quickly searched his house. Mr Han¬ nay was then released, after police realised their mistake. Mr Hannay said: “I had just come out of hos¬ pital, as I have an issue with my leg. My daugh¬ ter, Lauren, was asleep in bed as she had college in the morning and I was just catching up on the telly. “There were two loud bangs at the door and I thought maybe it was one of my sons trying to make me jump or have a joke. “So I went over to the door and when I opened clima^ / Windows / Doors / Conservatories / Roofline ✓ Continuous Guttering / Sarnafil Fiat Roofs Phone 01297 35053 www.climaxwindows.co.uk the door there was nobody there. Suddenly I had guns and torches being pointed in my face.” Mr Hannay says he was then told to put his hands on his head and walk slowly down his garden path and to not make any sudden move¬ ments. Mr Hannay was then handcuffed and led away from his home. He was asked if any¬ one else was in the house, to which he replied his daughter was and that she was asleep. Three officers then entered the house and his daughter was escorted out of the house. Mr Hannay added: “Lauren looked petrified and I kept asking the police what was going on. I told Lauren not to worry, as we hadn’t done anything wrong and it was all a big mistake.” After police carried out a quick check of the property, Mr Hannay’s handcuffs were re¬ moved and he was told he could go back into his home. He said: “The whole incident has been a ter¬ rible ordeal. They came to my house with armed police and wouldn’t give me a straight answer. “I’ve been told by my doctor I should seek counselling, my daughter isn’t sleeping, the whole thing has been traumatising. “At no point did they produce a warrant, at no point did they sit us down and explain what had happened. I’ve lived in Streamers Meadow for 28 years and have no criminal record, so how could they get it so wrong?!” “We are all held accountable for what we do and the police should be held accountable for this. I want to know what gave them permis¬ sion to ‘gate-crash’ my home with no real expla¬ nation. It’s been more than a week and I still have no answer.” Mr Hannay has made a formal complaint against Devon and Cornwall Police and Pul- ■ MR HANNAY was escorted away from his house and handcuffed by police in what is believed to be a case of mistaken identity man ’s View from Honiton & Ottery St Mary con¬ tacted the police for a response.

The motion for a vote of no confidence was heard at an extraordinary meeting of the coun¬ cil on Wednesday, September 13th to a packed public gallery. Independent councillor Ben Ingham had pro¬ posed the motion following the closure of hos¬ pital beds in East Devon. It was seconded by independent councillor Val Ranger, and backed by 14 other councillors (a mix of independents and Lib Dems), and read: “On Tuesday, July 25th 2017, councillor Diviani chose not to represent the opinion of this council or the people we represent at the Devon County Council Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee meeting when he was clearly expected to do so. “This council no longer has confidence in Cllr Diviani’s commitment to represent our collec¬ tive interests nor lead our East Devon commu¬ nities as the figurehead for local government. “We call for his resignation.” The Devon County Council Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee narrowly resolved (7- 6) to not refer the NEW Devon Clinical Com¬ missioning Group bed closure process and decision to the Secretary of State for Health. Councillor Diviani voted against referral de¬ spite EDDC opposing the bed closures, which is what sparked the motion of a vote of no con- INSIDE this week's paper A-Z FEATURE Pages 10 & 11 EDUCATION Pages 20-26 COPING WITH BEREAVEMENT Pages 28 & 29 SUNDAY LUNCH Pages 30 & 31 VIEW 2-Pages 32-35 | JOBS-Page 36 PROPERTY - Pages 37-41 | SERVICES - Pages 42-47 MOTORS - Pages 48-52 | SPORT - Pages 53-56 Pulman's View Series of Newspapers view from Pulman's View Series of Newspapers, incorporating Pulman's Weekly News, is published at Unit 3, St Michael's Business Centre, Church Street, Lyme Regis, Dorset DT7 3DB | Telephone: 01297 446157 | Email: edit@viewnews.co.uk Website: www.viewnews.co.uk | This newspaper is committed to providing fair, accurate and balanced journalism.

He came und¬ er sustained fire dur¬ ing Wednesday’s mee¬ ting. Councillor Roger Giles (Ind) said: “In 26 years on this council I cannot think of an in¬ stance where the council leader has gone against the wish¬ es of his/her council. “I am certain that there has not been an occasion where the council leader has gone against the unanimous decision of the council on a very contentious issue, and where the council decision re¬ flects the view of the vast majority of local public opinion. ANTI-Diviani campaigners before the meeting “How could anyone - member of the public or member of this council - have even a shred of confidence in him after his quite deplorable ac¬ tions on July 25th? “A day of shame and infamy for our demo¬ cratic principles.” Councillor Peter Burrows said he did not think a referral to the Secretary of State for Health would have made any difference, but added: “But that is not the point, Councillor Di¬ viani should have represented the views of East Devon.” Cllr Diviani said that when he was voting at the committee meeting he was representing all district councils in Devon as part of the Devon GET IN TOUCH Managing Director PHILIP EVANS 01297 446155 Deputy Editor JAMES COLES 01297 446168 Sports Editor HOWARD LARCOMBE 01297 446152 Chief Reporter ANDERS LARSSON 01297 446142 Reporters FRANCESCA EVANS 01297 446154 PETER HODGES 01297 446162 Production Manager ROB LARCOMBE 01297 446140 Group Sales Manager NATALIE EDMEADES 01297 446145 Advertising Executives MATT TIPPING 01297 446163 LILLIE FILTNESS 01297 446160 Distribution ALISON KING 01297 446057 Accounts ANITA ROUTLEY 01297 446149 ^ Lovely Josephine needs a quiet home to relax in PROTECTION Honiton Cats Protection n www.honiton.cats.org.uk District Forum, not just EDDC. He also said that had the scrutiny committee resolved to refer the bed closure to the Secre¬ tary of State for Health, it would only have de¬ layed the inevitable, jeopardised care and increased costs. The bed closure programme comes under the NHS Sustainable Transformation Plan (STP) and Cllr Diviani explained: “Of 14 initial STP reviews referred to the Secretary of State for Health between November 1st 2013 and March 22nd 2017,14 were rejected - there being no al¬ ternative, evidence-based proposals to suggest they should be overturned. “The absence of alternative proposals and simply saying ‘don’t close our hospital beds’ would carry no weight at all. “Why would a referral from the DCC scrutiny committee be different to others that have failed? “In my view, a referral would only delay the inevitable, jeopardise care, increase costs and delay necessary change.” Heckling erupted after his speech and EDDC chairman Andrew Moulding (Con) threatened to have people removed from the chamber. He pointed at one person in the public gallery and said: “The lady over there dressed as a nurse will be the first to go.” Eighteen councillors voted for the motion of no confidence but 31 went against (with one ab- stension). It's never too late As GCSE students across Devon and Somerset celebrated their results, adult learners have also been jumping for joy having made the grades. Duncan Cousens was one of many adult learn¬ ers who returned to the classroom last year to study GCSE Maths with Devon County Coun¬ cil’s adult learning service, Learn Devon. Learn Devon provide a wide range of adult learning courses, including GCSE Maths and English. Both of which are free to eligible adults. Forty-three-year-old Duncan, father of two, took the course at Honiton Community College. He’d previously attained professional qualifi¬ cations in engineering and as a plumber, but until now, not GCSE Maths. “I really enjoyed the course. We all did,” said Duncan. “I’d realised that I wanted to get my GCSE Maths for several reasons, having missed out at school. I’ve two young children and I’ve wanted to be able to support them more with their maths homework. “I’ve also volunteered as an assistant at my local primary school and would like to study for my PGCE to enable me to become a teacher, for which I need a maths qualification.” There are GCSE Maths courses at Learn Devon locations across Devon. Honiton Com¬ munity College’s Learn Devon GCSE Maths course is on Wednesday nights from 6pm to 8:30pm. It runs until June 27th 2018.

V ^ Local police forces leading the way with ‘digital’ sniffer dogs DEVON & Cornwall Police - along with their counterparts from Dorset - are once again leading the way in investing in cutting edge ways to tackle crime. Hot off the heels of being the first police forces in the UK to set up a dedicated drone unit, the operations department has now announced that it has trained two digital storage detection po¬ lice dogs. Dorset Police and Devon & Cornwall Po¬ lice have added to their ranks police dogs Tweed and Rob. Tweed, a 19-month- old Springer Spaniel, and Rob, a 20-month- old black Labrador, are the first police dogs in the UK, and the only dogs outside of the USA, to be trained to detect digi¬ tal storage devices. Chief Superinten¬ dent Jim Nye, Com¬ mander for the Alliance Operations Department, said: “This is an historic step for the alliance and policing in the UK. These dogs will give the police a new way to fight the threat of terrorism, pae¬ dophiles and fraud¬ AXE YACHT CLUB Going to sea next year?

Tweed and Rob have been used by po¬ lice at crime scenes and executions of warrants, not just within Cornwall, Devon and Dorset, but across the whole UK. “The dogs have been used to sniff out data devices such as mo¬ bile devices, USB sticks, SD cards, hard drives and comput¬ ers. “Once again, we have shown that we are prepared to look at new technology and will always strive to get one step ahead to tackle criminal¬ ity.” In May 2015, Police Constable Graham Attwood, who is a po¬ lice dog instructor for the team, began to re¬ search the ability to train such a dog. PC Attwood identi¬ fied that the first dogs in the world to train in digital storage de¬ tection were trained at the Pioneering Connecticut State Po¬ lice Dog unit in the USA. Following his col¬ laboration with Con¬ necticut State Police and the FBI, a pilot scheme was started in December 2016. PC Attwood, said: “Myself and members of the alliance dog school initially han¬ dled and trained Tweed and Rob mainly in our own time as we were com¬ mitted to our usual daily duties of train¬ ing the forces’ other operational police dogs. “The majority of the dogs we have in both forces either come from our puppy breeding scheme or are gift or rescue dogs but, as this was a unique challenge for us, we identified and purchased Tweed and Rob last December when they were around 15-months-old and embarked on this journey with them.” Recently retired Connecticut State Po¬ lice Dog Instructor and co-founder of the American pro¬ gramme Mike Real along with Special Agent Jeffrey Calan- dra, who is the only digital detection dog handler in the FBI, were invited to Devon for a week in March 2016 to train with and assess Tweed and Rob. This formed part of an independent re¬ view of the ability of the dogs to detect dig¬ ital storage devices at the alliance police dog school in Middle- moor, Exeter. Under the watchful eyes of the visiting of¬ ficers from the United States, the dogs were put through their paces in a three-day assessment process of the dogs’ operational search abilities. Twe¬ ed and Rob passed with flying colours. Mike Real said fol¬ lowing the assess¬ ment: “Constable Attwood and the trainers at the al¬ liance police dog school have done a masterful job of bringing this new dis¬ ciple of police canine to the UK.” Special Agent Jef¬ frey Calandra of the FBI commented: “In today’s tech-driven world crime has no state or even country boundaries, so help¬ ing our law-enforce¬ ment partners around the world develop cut¬ ting edge detection ca¬ pabilities is key to fighting crime and terror.” PC Attwood, added: “Our digital dogs have already proven to be a success and have been used in more than 50 war¬ rants executed across the UK, including Hampshire, Essex, South Wales and North Yorkshire. “We have already seen some really fan¬ tastic results from these two dogs. “Tweed on one war¬ rant indicated that something may have been within what looked like a cola can. “This was then in¬ spected by a search of¬ ficer and discovered that it was actually a money box which had a number of SD cards hidden within it. “Rob has also indi¬ cated a small device hidden carefully in a drawer, likely to have been missed by the human eye, which just goes to show that they are able to locate these items, which as¬ sists us greatly with our searches.” Rob and Tweed are part of a trial and the forces will assess the success of these dogs and their new skills at the end of the 2017 with a view to rolling this out wider. The dogs live at home with their new full time police dog handlers, PC Martin King and PC Jill Curnow. Badger culling set to return across Devon and Somerset LICENCES have been issued for badger culling across Devon and Somerset. Culling is part of the government’s 25-year strategy to eradicate bovine TB, but oppo¬ nents say there is no evidence it is effective. A badger vaccination programme to stop the spread of TB is also restarting. The Badger Trust condemned the policy as ‘politically motivated’ and an ‘insult to the na¬ tion’s intelligence’. The new licences have been granted by Nat¬ ural England and it follows a decision to ex¬ tend culling areas around the South West. The government said it will launch a new advisory service for farmers in high risk areas this autumn advising them how to limit the spread of the disease. Farming Minister George Eustice said: “Bovine TB not only has a devastating impact on our beef and dairy farms, but causes harm and distress to infected cattle. “Vaccination is just one part of our compre¬ hensive strategy, which also includes tighter cattle controls, improved biosecurity and bad¬ ger control in areas where bTB is rife, to tackle the reservoir of disease in wildlife.\" The government’s chief vet Nigel Gibbens said: “Proactive badger control is currently the best available option and the licensing of further areas is necessary to realise disease- control benefits across the high risk area of England, rather than at local levels.” Dominic Dyer, chief executive of the Badger Trust, said 32,247 badgers could be killed under these new licences in the next six weeks. “The government is simply pandering to its core voters in the farming sector,” he said. “No credible scientist has ever suggested that culling badgers will make any significant impact on lowering TB in cattle and there is now clear evidence the policy is failing badly. “The government is simply imposing its will in an act of political aggression against both science and the will of the people.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), whose meeting are chaired by Tiverton & Honiton MP Neil Parish, said that in 2016, operations in Som¬ erset, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Devon, Corn¬ wall, Herefordshire and Wiltshire were all successful in meeting their targets for culling badgers. In total, culling will be carried out in 21 areas in England this year.

Council has five seats to fill HONITON Town Council are appealing for residents to come forward and join the au¬ thority to help put their turbu¬ lent year behind them. The council has been review¬ ing the reasons for its well publicised recent difficulties and has put in place a pro¬ gramme of actions to address outstanding issues to move forward with a new pro¬ gramme of service to the Honi¬ ton community. Honiton Town Council has experienced considerable tur¬ bulence in recent months due to a significant number of is¬ sues arising, with many in connection with the construc¬ tion of the new Beehive Com¬ munity Complex. Among other things, the council has experienced a Ju¬ dicial Review, resignations of one third of its councillors, staff absence and resigna¬ tions, audit problems, a police investigation and a series of code of conduct complaints about councillors. Members recently met infor¬ mally to acknowledge and dis¬ cuss the many problems that the they faced and to recog¬ nize the importance of their mission to serve the commu¬ nity in Honiton. At a subsequent town coun¬ cil meeting in August the council resolved to take sev¬ eral steps to set a new tone, ad¬ dressing the issues of the past as expeditiously as possible and moving forward to work on new projects for the benefit of the community. The initiatives, that the I Peter Hodges Reporter \\ peter@viewnews.co.uk council has prioritised in¬ clude working to provide new allotments for Honiton resi¬ dents, leading an initiative to provide a focus on tourism in Honiton, improving commu¬ nications within the town par¬ ticularly through social media, leading the develop¬ ment of the new Neighbour¬ hood Plan and working with others to ensure that the Com¬ munity Complex, which is now operating, continues to flourish while ensuring that it serves all sections of the com¬ munity. A number of councillors have recently discovered that they were subject to investiga¬ tion by the monitoring officer for council standards, follow¬ ing allegations from a former councillor. They were subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing and have spoken about their experience of being subject to such an investigation and of the importance of all involved with the town council, past and present embracing the fu¬ ture and leaving the past be¬ hind. Mayor Cllr John Zarczynski said: “Having been involved with the council over many years I have witnessed both the best and the worst in coun¬ cil life. “As mayor, I am determined that the council will rise above the arguments of the re¬ cent past and show just what a council that is united and fo¬ cused can achieve on behalf of the community”. Five vacancies exist for new town councillors and as elec¬ toral procedures have now been offered and not taken up Honiton Town Council have been authorised to co-opt the additional councillors. Co- option is a process where eligible members of the com¬ munity who are interested in serving on the council can put themselves forward for ap¬ pointment by the council to fill a vacancy until the next council elections take place. To be eligible for co-option a person must live or work within three miles of the town boundary, be of good charac¬ ter and be willing to attend council meetings and work with elected councillors to take collective decisions in re¬ lation to council business. Anyone interested in being considered for a role as a co¬ opted councillor should write to the acting town clerk by Wednesday, September 20th giving brief details about themselves and confirming that they meet the residence criteria. All applicants will be invited to the town council meeting on September 25th. They will be asked to make a short statement to the council saying why they wish to be considered for co-option on to the council following which councillors may ask some questions. The council will then consider all co-option candidates and vote to decide who they will then co-opt. Town band looking for new talent HONITON Band is inviting aspiring brass players to join the band's training section this autumn. Local community brass band, Honiton Band, set up its training section in 2016 to provide af¬ fordable opportunities for local people of all ages to learn to read music and play a musical instrument. With a new term commencing in October, the band is extending an invitation to anyone aged eight or older who would like to learn a brass in¬ strument, or perhaps is looking to take up play¬ ing again after a break. With instruments available to loan, the training band provides the ideal opportunity to try out a new instrument. Tuition sessions - run by experienced members of Honiton Band - are held on Wednesday evenings between 6.30pm and 7.15pm at The Beehive on Dowell Street. There are no tuition fees but students are asked to contribute towards the hire of the practice room (generally no more than £3 per week), making this an affordable way to learn an instru¬ ment. Honiton Band trombone player and training band tutor, Richard Brain, said: \"Ask any member of Honiton Band, and they will tell you what a joy it is to play a musical instrument - particularly in a brass band. \"We know that learning to play an instrument can sometimes feel a bit daunting, and can often be expensive. \"Our training band was set up to provide afford¬ able opportunities for local people to learn to play a brass instrument in a relaxed environment - tuition is free, you don't need to have your own instrument and all we ask for is a small contribu¬ tion towards room hire costs. \"People often think that these opportunities are just for children, but that is not the case with our training band. \"In fact, several of our current Honiton Band members only learnt how to read music and play an instrument in their adult years. \"Our tuition sessions are open to anyone aged eight or over who would like to learn, or redis¬ cover, how to play a brass instrument.\" To register your interest in joining Honiton Band's training section, contact Richard Brain on 07786 564491 or via email at richardbrain 29@gmail.com. For more information about Honiton Band, visit www.honitonband.co.uk or www.facebook.com/ honitonband MP takes tour of retirement village GITTISHAM Retirement Vil¬ lage, located in Honiton, re¬ cently welcomed local MP Neil Parish to the site. The MP met David Thomas, Group Care Director, and Vil¬ lage Manager Gaynor O’Dell, who gave him a tour, showing him the range of independent living available for the over 65s, as well as the 39-bed care home. Neil also chatted to residents who were able to give him an insight into what life is really like in a retirement village. Gaynor commented: “Neil commented on how well main¬ tained and attractive the vil¬ lage is which our maintena¬ nce team and gardeners will be pleased to hear! “Everybody works hard to make the village a beautiful, fulfilling place in which to enjoy later life. “This includes our team, which is responsible for the smooth running of the village, as well as the residents them¬ selves. They make life what it is here and organise many of our social events and activi¬ ties.” Neil added: “I think retire¬ ment village living really of¬ fers something special for retirees - independent stress- free living but with added se¬ curity, a community feel and care available on site. “I was also delighted to learn of the retirement village’s ef¬ forts to restore and enhance any historical buildings on its development sites, turning many of these beautiful build¬ ings into luxury communal fa¬ cilities for the use of resid¬ ents.” www.viewnews.co.uk OTTERYStMARY Tuesday, September 19th 2017 5 Volly team thrilled Western Storm won Women’s T20 THE Volunteer Inn in Ottery St Mary was thrilled to learn the Western Storm Twenty 20 team won this season’s Kia Super League. The pub had been delivering catering to the team when they were training at Exeter University’s Topsham Sports Ground over the summer. The Volunteer’s landlady and head cook Jacqui Down carried out a trial meal for the team in June and started the contract in July. Jacqui said: “We were delivering nutri¬ tionally balanced food to the training ground. “Meals included curries, tacos, chilli con carne and lasagnes, all designed to meet nu¬ tritional needs and keep the team in tip top condition for training.” Western Storm is an English women's I Peter Hodges Reporter \\ peter@viewnews.co.uk Twenty20 cricket team formed in 2016 to compete in the Women’s Cricket Super League. The captain is Heather Knight and the team includes overseas players Stafanie Taylor, Rachel Priest and Lizelle Lee as well as England players Anya Shrubsole and Fran Wilson. The catering contract came about after an approach by Trevor Griffin who coaches the team. Trevor owns the Cricket Shop at Cotleigh and is a regular visitor to The Vol¬ unteer in Ottery. “Everyone at the Volunteer was over the moon when we heard that the team had won,” added Jacqui.

Flu is a highly infectious dis¬ ease which can affect anyone, so people at risk are encour¬ aged to have the vaccination, which is now available in local GP practices. Some groups - including pregnant women, young chil¬ dren aged two to four, carers, those with long-term health conditions like heart disease or breathing problems, and over 65s - are more suscepti¬ ble to flu and its effects, so it is particularly important that they are vaccinated. They can have the vaccine free of charge. Dr Kate Gurney, a GP partner at Coleridge Medical Centre, in Ottery St Mary, and board member of Devon Local Med¬ ical Committee, which repre¬ sents and supports GPs in the county, said: \"Initial indica¬ tions suggest that this is going to be a worse flu sea¬ son than usual, with more cases, so I'd encourage peo¬ ple to take action and have the flu vaccination at their local GP practice. \"As the weather becomes colder and we head towards winter, the flu virus begins to circulate widely in the com¬ munity so it's important that vulnerable people are pro¬ tected as soon as possible. \"Don't take risks with your health - the vaccination is still the first line of defence against flu, as it helps protect against the changing strains of the virus that circulate each year. \"Having the vaccine only takes a few minutes out of your day and offers protection against a virulent virus, poten¬ tially stopping both you and your loved ones and carers from falling ill too.\" Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include a fev¬ er, chills, cough, headache, aches and pains in the joints and muscles, and extreme tiredness.

The tenants’ garden compe¬ tition is an increasingly popu¬ lar event, which is organised each year by the tenant partic¬ ipation assistant in Housing Services at East Devon Dis¬ trict Council. There were 51 entries in 2017’s competition (a signifi¬ cant increase on last year’s 36 entries) and the council’s ten¬ ants excelled themselves with a beautiful display of gardens. Kieron Bewes, who judged the competition again, award¬ ed a staggering 32 gold prizes, as well as 16 silver and three bronze prizes, using the Royal Horticultural Society judging method. Mr Bewes, Councillor Jill Elson and Councillor Megan Armstrong, together with sponsor Marc Williams of MD Group, presented the prizes and certificates to the win¬ ners. A raffle was held with prizes consisting of a bird box kit do¬ nated by The Men’s Shed, dec¬ orated assembled bird boxes and books donated by East Devon’s Countryside Team, as well as assorted garden sup¬ plies donated by Bev Ander¬ son, Tenant Participation Assistant. Sponsors for the 2017 East Devon Tenants Gardening Competition were: • Otter Nurseries, Ottery St Mary; • Kings Garden Centre, Exmouth; • Kieron Bewes - Horticultural Consultant; • MD Group; • Skinner Construction; • Thistle Insurance Group; • St Bridget Nurseries; • East Devon District Council’s Tenant Participation. Feedback from the event was excellent - tenants enter be¬ cause they are extremely proud of their gardens, which highlight the area they live in. Cllr Pauline Stott, ward member for Exmouth Halsdon and chairman of the Housing Review Board, said: “We are very lucky as a council to have tenants that take such great pride in their gardens to give the estates such a lovely array of flowers. “Every year they seem to get better with amazing disp¬ lays and with more and more tenants entering. “Our grateful thanks to all of you who took part in this year’s garden competition.” Cllr Jill Elson, East Devon’s portfolio holder for sustain¬ able homes and communities, said: “It was very inspiring presenting the prizes to our tenants who have made their gardens, hanging baskets, and vegetable plots so good. “We also had local tenant as¬ sociations who won prizes for making their areas so pleas¬ ant for all the tenants to enjoy all year round. Well done to our green-fingered tenants.” For further information, contact Tenant Participation on 01395 517453 or email ten- antparticipation@eastdevon.g ov.uk or visit http://east devon.gov.uk/housing/get¬ ting- involved-with-the-hous- ing-service/ways-to-get-involv ed-with-the-housing- service/annual-garden-com- petition GARDEN COMPETITION RESULTS Manor Close Tenant Association Gold in the Communal & Friends Garden category & Best on the Day competition winner; Mrs Bentley (Axminster) Gold & Overall Winner of First Time Entrants Category; Ms Benton (Broadclyst) Gold & Overall Winner of Back Garden Category; Mr & Mrs Hartnell (Exmouth) Gold & Overall Winner of Containers & Hanging Baskets Category; Miss Love (Woodbury) Gold & Overall Winner of Disabled Garden Cate¬ gory; Miss Packer (Exmouth) Gold & Overall Winner of Front Garden Cat¬ egory; Mr & Mrs Poulson (Poltimore) Gold & Overall Winner of Recycled & Organic Garden Category; Mrs Ward (Kilmington) Gold & Overall Winner of Overall Category; Master Whittet-Evens (Exmouth) Gold & Overall Winner of Youth Novelty Garden Category; Mr & Mrs Ander- ton (Axminster) Overall Gold win¬ ner; Mrs Bea (Sidmouth) Gold winner for Disabled Garden cate¬ gory; Mrs Beasley (Exmouth) Gold winner of First Time Entrants cate¬ gory; Mrs Bunting (Exmouth) Gold winner of Back Garden category; Mr Carr (Dunkeswell) Gold Overall; Mr & Mrs Cranch (Exmouth) Gold Back Garden; Ms Davey (Axminster) Gold Front Garden; Mr Fowler (Sidmouth) Gold Back Garden; Mr Glanville (Ta- laton) Gold Overall; Mr & Mrs Hamel (Exmouth) Gold Disabled Garden; Mrs Holman (Exmouth) Gold First Time Entrants; Ms lies (Exmouth) Gold First Time Entrants; Mrs Kelle- her (Broadclyst) Gold Front Garden; Mr Kimber (Newton Poppleford) Gold Front Garden; Mrs Le Sueur, Mr David Parr, Charlie, John Fowler & Friends of Lymebourne Park (Sid¬ mouth) Gold Communal & Friends; Mr & Mrs Marchant (Axminster) Gold Recycled & Organic Garden; Mr Ponsford (Broadclyst) Gold Overall; Mr Salter (Ottery St Mary) Gold Recycled & Organic Garden; Mrs Sleeman (Exmouth) Gold Back Garden; Mrs Sullivan (Sidmouth) Gold First Time Entrants; Mrs Travers (Sidmouth) Gold Disabled Garden; Mr & Mrs Webber (Dunkeswell) Gold Back Garden; Ms Whittet-Evens (Exmouth) Gold First Time Entrants; Mrs Beer (Broad¬ clyst) Silver Overall; Mr Denning (Seaton) Silver Overall; Mr & Mrs Dunnage (Axminster) Silver Back Garden; Mr Gallagher (Woodbury) Silver Disabled Garden; Mrs Higham (Exmouth) Silver Back Garden; Mr Hill (Lympstone, Exmouth) Silver Front Garden; Mrs Hill (Seaton) Sil¬ ver Front Garden; Mr & Mrs Hughes (Exmouth) Silver Front Garden; Mrs Jackley (Sidmouth) Silver Recycled & Organic Garden; Mr Miller (Ex¬ mouth) Silver Containers & Hanging Baskets; Mr Odubore (Honiton) Sil¬ ver Front Garden; Miss Rhodes (Sid¬ mouth) Silver Containers & Hanging Baskets; Ms Stokes (Exmouth) Silver Overall; Arcot Park & Friends (Sid¬ mouth) Silver Communal & Friends; Mr Ward (Exmouth) Silver Overall; Mr & Mrs Webber (Dunkeswell) Sil¬ ver Communal & Friends; Mr & Mrs Doran (Exmouth) Bronze Vegetable Garden; Mr & Mrs Nobes (Lymp¬ stone, Exmouth) Bronze Front Gar¬ den; Mr Williams (Exmouth) Bronze Disabled Garden. dentistry www.lymebaydentistry.co.uk Temple House, 63 Broad Street, Lyme Regis, DT7 3QF reception@lymebaydentistry.co.uk MIRRORS • BEDS • WARDROBES • CHEST OF DRAWERS • I The Rec^cISng m m § 1-5 The Regent Hall r Castle Hill, Axminster Devon EX13 5NQ Covering East Devon, West Dorset & Somerset Helping to raise money for Charity by Recycling Household goods Cn • STOOLS • LIGHTING • GARDEN FURNITURE • PICTURES www.viewnews.co.uk AXMINSTER Tuesday, September 19th 2017 7 Fortis signs Japanese contracts A COLLECTION has been started for a family whose house was the subject of an air rifle attack in Axminster. The family of Syrian refug¬ ees was rehoused elsewhere after the incident on Saturday, August 26th. The collection tin and a book, in which people can write messages of support, will be in The West Country Higgler in South Street until September 25th. They have been placed there, along with Refugee Support Devon leaflets, by local resident Beth Kellam. Speaking on September 11th, she said: \"I want anyone who might have harboured negative feelings to know that they are in the minority. \"And I want the family to know that we care - it is a bonus if we can send them a voucher which might help them get settled in a new place. \"I had hoped to raise £75 to send them some flowers and a shopping voucher, but cur¬ rently we have collected about £300, which is really wonderful. \"It's also lovely to read the supportive messages - it does a lot to restore my faith in hu¬ manity and the people of Axminster.\" As previously reported, po¬ lice were called to an address in The Cricketers. Nobody was physically in¬ jured, but an air rifle pellet hit a wall inside the house. Two men were subsequently interviewed at Honiton Police Station before being released under investigation. The incident was treated as criminal damage but police said they were \"keeping an open mind in relation to any possible racially aggravated issues\". Speaking on September 16th, a force spokesperson there were no updates to re¬ port. Anyone with information is asked to contact police via 101@dc.police.uk quoting cri¬ me reference number CR/07 2787/17. Police hope to reunite camcorder with rightful owner A CLOTHES manufacturer based near Axminster is set to double its turnover after se¬ curing a contract involving three Japanese fashion retail¬ ers. Fortis Clothing, established in 1997, has seen an increase in demand for its luxury out¬ door wear from a number of international markets in the past year. Last week the company an¬ nounced that it has secured a new contract to export its range to Japan with the sup¬ port of Lloyds Bank Commer¬ cial Banking. The new contract will see three Japanese fashion retail¬ ers stock its range of coats, trousers, bags and vests for three years. With the new contract in place, Fortis Clothing is ex¬ pecting to double its turnover in the next 13 months. Fortis Clothing, based at Hartgrove Hill Farm, Trinity Hill Road, makes clothes for the military, police forces, farmers and outdoor enthusi¬ asts across the country. It also exports products to Denmark and New Zealand and has an annual turnover of £500,000, employing 10 mem¬ bers of staff. The contract was secured after the business used Lloyds Bank’s International Trade Portal to identify and priori¬ tise the best overseas opportu¬ nities for its products or services. Director Oliver Massy-Birch said: “The demand for British- made clothing is growing, and being able to tap into new markets in Japan is a big step in our international growth plans. “Before we started export¬ ing, and due to the seasonal nature of our products, we would see a spike in sales dur¬ ing the UK’s colder months. “Exporting to countries ex¬ periencing winter at different times in the year has resulted in our sales book becoming more consistent year-round. “This has given us the headspace to explore new markets.” Phil Titherington, relation¬ ship manager at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: “British made products are now more competitive than ever to businesses buying in other currencies due to the weaker pound, opening up an opportunity for manufactur¬ ers to take advantage of this growing trend. “We’re committed to helping Britain prosper by supporting ambitious businesses like For¬ tis Clothing looking to export, and to underline this, we’re pledging to help 5,000 first¬ time exporters in 2017.” A CAMCORDER, believed to be stolen, was among items found during a recent police raid at an address in Axminster. A number of items were seized and Detective Consta¬ ble Matt Burnell, said: \"As part of our searches we have lo¬ cated a Sony digital camera and Samsung digital video camera that we believe to be stolen. \"I am keen to try and trace the rightful owner of the prop¬ erty. We are hoping that releas¬ ing these images, including of a distinctive black bag that contained the Samsung (pic¬ tured), and the red bag which contained the Sony camera, we can locate its owner. \"If you think you are the right¬ ful owner of these items, or know who they belong to, we would love to hear from you. \"Please email 101@dc.police, uk or call 101.\" Hangar 1.

The afternoon rain may have put some people off attending but the weather dried up and the procession went off in fine conditions. The collec¬ tion was down by about £600 from last year’s £1,800, to just over £1,200 this year, but organisers were pleased overall with how the event went. Carnival chairman Keith King and the team of committee members thanked everyone who attended, and commented: “In spite of the weather, plenty of people turned out to make this a wonderful carnival. We would like to thank all who gave up their time, the judges and marshals, in¬ cluding Rotary Club of Axminster. “The carnival would not take place without the generous support of Steve Herbert (fun fair), Emma Cole (burger van) and Scott Rowe Solici¬ tors, for which we thank them. A spe¬ cial thank you should go to Keith Sweetland, who provided vehicles for the event in the square, and a Bentley for our royal family, who did us proud. The police provided a friendly presence throughout the evening and Street Scene (East Devon District Council) cleaned up efficiently after¬ wards. The collection amounted to £1,212.01 and will be used to support local groups and charities.” Results were as follows: Beviss & Beckingsale Cup (Best in Procession) - Sid Vale CC, Greek Empire; Presi¬ dent’s Cup (Best Walking Entry) - A&A CC, Pablo’s Travelling Circus; Kilmington Players’ Cup (Best Drama Club Entry) - Axminster Drama Club, Spamalot; Tigers’ CC Club Cup (Best Costumes) - Logan Charles, In¬ dian Dream; Axminster Carpets Cup (Best Music) - Nunsford Nutters, Three Little Pigs.

Mr Cotton has been the president of Seaton Art So¬ ciety for many years, and has been represented in¬ ternationally by Messum's for more than 25 years. The exhibition opened on September 13th and Mr Cotton said: \"At art school, no one ever explained that the purpose of drawing is a process, to enable you to construct, to select or to eliminate. \"For me it is a vital part of the painting. In landscape you absorb the moment - the whole ambience of a place and try to capture it on paper. As I draw I am looking towards the fin¬ ished painting, selecting what I will include and what I will leave out.\" He is one of Britain's most distinguished painters, with work in important col¬ lections in Europe and North America, including the Royal Collection. SEATON and District Show is taking place this Sunday in The Gateway (aka Seaton Town Hall). The popular show returned last year, after a four-year break, when Seaton and District Lions Club took over organising and running the event. The comeback proved to be a great success as more than 50 people exhibited a total of more than 200 items varying from flowers, fruit and vegetables through to handicrafts, art and pho¬ tography. A show spokesperson said: “When the doors opened at 1.30pm a constant stream of visitors went round the show tables admiring the vari¬ ous exhibits and the work that had gone into them. “With the enthusiasm shown by the organis¬ ers, exhibitors and visitors, Seaton Lions de¬ cided to organise the show again this year. “A new programme has been available for the I Anders Larsson Reporter \\ anders@viewnews.co.uk past few months listing over 160 different classes in which people can enter. “There is everything from flowers, fruit, veg¬ etables, cakes preserves, art photography, sewing, knitting, embroidery, handicrafts, home made beers and wines and flower ar¬ rangements. There are separate classes for the under 16 years age group.” Programmes listing the classes and including an entry form are available from Animal Botanical in Queen Street, Byrne Jones in Ma¬ rine Place, Steve’s News in Fore Street and WH Smith Local in Harbour Road. The organisers are appealing for last year’s winners to make sure they have returned their cups and trophies to Animal Botanical in time to be presented to this year’s winners. Doors will open at 1.30pm, with trophy pre¬ sentations at 3.30pm. Man taken to hospital after town centre attack A MAN needed hospital treatment after an al¬ tercation in Seaton in the early hours of Sat¬ urday, September 3rd. The incident happened at about 12.30am near the town hall, and a police spokesperson said four persons were involved. There are three suspects - two white men and one white female, all believed to be in their 40s. The police spokesperson said: \"The victim sustained what is believed to be a number of puncture marks to his back plus other cuts and bruises. He attended Royal Devon & Ex¬ eter Hospital.\" Any witnesses are encouraged to contact police on 101@dc.police or by calling 101. The crime reference is CR/075448/17. Worries over safety of Fisherman's Gap gates THE Environment Agency has expressed con¬ cern about the safety of the gates at Fisherman's Gap in Seaton. A report to Seaton Town Council said: \"As you may be aware, each gate is over five metres long and the width of the path on the beach side of the wall is only 3.5metres. \"The gates are pushed closed and are quite heavy. \"The concern arises from the uneven ground under the arc of the gate and the effort required in getting the gates to move, and to stop them once they pick up momentum. \"One of the options being considered is whether to reduce the size of the gates since fishing boats no longer launch from here.\" The town council will discuss the matter and reply to the Environment Agency in due course.

The charity provides a free delivery service to the NHS, transporting blood and other medical sup¬ plies around the region by motorbike. The donation comes after a public vote where more than 178,000 people in Devon voted for a char¬ ity that should receive funding from the Masons as part of the Community Awards scheme. The Community Awards are a major part of Free¬ masonry’s 300th anniver¬ sary celebrations. The Masonic Charitable Foundation is distributing £3million to 300 charities across the country, with the public vote deciding on the range of awards from £4,000 to £25,000. The charity was pre¬ sented with their award at a special ceremony by the Provincial Grand Master Ian Kingsbury JP on be¬ half of the Masonic Chari¬ table Foundation at the Mount Edgecumbe Ma¬ sonic Hall Citadel in Ply¬ mouth. The £3million fund is being administered by the charitable foundation, which obtains all of its funding from Freemasons, their families and friends. It is estimated that half of Freemasonry’s total charitable expenditure of over £33m goes to chari¬ ties that help people in communities across the country. Rt W. Bro. Ian Kings¬ bury JP. said: “We are de¬ lighted to be able to celebrate 300 years of Freemasonry by helping local charities. “We’ve been active in charity work for all that time, but this is the first occasion we’ve asked the public to help us decide how to spend our money. “We are very pleased that so many people from Devon took part in the vote.” ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE TIME TO TRANSFORM EYE HEALTH The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Specsavers are urging people to have regular eye tests to help maintain and protect their sight. Research* commissioned by the charity and high street opticians has revealed that one in five people will live with sight loss in their lifetime, despite at least half of all cases being avoidable. With nearly six million people in the UK currently living with sight-threatening conditions, nearly every family in Britain is touched by sight problems in some way. While sight is the nations most precious sense by far, with 78% of people polled saying it is the one they would least like to lose, a quarter of UK adults are still risking avoidable sight loss by not having had an eye test in the past 2 years. Of those who had not been for an eye test during that time period, 33% did not think that there was anything wrong with their eyes, while 24% said that they just didn’t have the time. Specsavers believes that eye care should be accessible to everyone. Specsavers Healthcall offers a free NHS sight test at home and a comprehensive home eye care service to those who cannot visit a store unaccompanied. As with all Specsavers staff, the home visiting teams are becoming Dementia Friends to help people with dementia recognise sight loss. The research reveals that only one in three people who qualify for a home visit are aware of the service. It is vital that, in an ageing society, we meet the needs of these vulnerable people and Specsavers’ clinical spokesperson Dr Nigel Best said: ‘Some people are waiting until they experience sight loss before booking an eye test, which means they are potentially prevent¬ ing their optician from detecting signs of eye health problems or other medical issues at an early stage. Early intervention is vital in the management and successful treatment of many conditions’ RNIB acting CEO Sally Harvey added: ‘We would encourage anyone who has put off going for an eye test to book one at the earliest opportunity.’ * YouGov Survey commissioned by Specsavers and RNIB 23rd June - 7th July 2017 of 6,430 UK adults aged 18+. HERE IS MORE TO AN EYE TEST THAN JUST THIS Eye tests check more than your vision. They can also keep your eyes healthy and detect a range of health conditions. At least 50% of sight loss is avoidable. Book an eye test at specsavers.co.uk Transforming eye health increase awareness.

The NHS provides FREE vaccination programmes to try to keep our population healthy and well. However vaccination programmes are only successful in protecting our most vulnerable patients if enough people around them are also vaccinated. This is known as “herd immunity” which means we need enough people vaccinated to stop the spread of viruses around our population. The most vulnerable in our population: babies, children, the frail elderly and those with existing health problems are all at increased risk if they, and those around them, are not vaccinated. Think about your family members and your friends and neighbours too when you are considering whether to get vaccinated. You may believe that you are fit and well and able to cope with flu should you get it, but passing it on to your children, grand-children or elderly parents or relatives could be much more serious for them. All of your GP’s and medical practice staff have the vaccine to not only protect themselves but also to protect their patients. If we all adopt this attitude we can help to ensure that our local population are protected and prepared should Flu strike this year. This year for the first time the vaccine contains 4 strains of the flu virus, and is expected to be much more effective in helping to stop a flu epidemic than in previous years. The vaccine is not live and so should not result in any side effects at all for the majority of the population. Please do not wait for a letter inviting you to have your flu jab, we are trying to reduce waste and costs by not sending individual invitations to patients, so if you know you are eligible please just book now. NOW is the time to ring your surgery and book your FLU VACCINATION Contact the Axminster Medical Practice if you are one of our patients on 01297 32126 and choose option 1 for appointments With destinations throughout the UK and Europe, covering everything from city breaks to scenic tours, seaside holidays to shopping, we aim to make sure we can offer a holiday to suit everyone!

Current officers sat in the main part of the hall while members Barbara Eavis and Margaret Barrow took the helm. September is always a busy month after the summer, with a variety of news, business and notices. This was all dealt with very ef¬ ficiently. Members were given final details regarding the out¬ ing later in September and were also told about the Har¬ vest Lunch prior to the October meeting. The autumn group meeting is also in October and will be hosted by Seaton Wl. Some members had enjoyed a coffee morning in July and notice was given of a lunch planned for October. Diana Walters gave a brief, in¬ teresting talk about the history of bobbin lace. She explained how considerable lace making expertise was brought over to Devon and the East Midlands as people fled from France and Flanders at the time of the In¬ quisition in the 16th century. Locally, Branscombe, Beer and Colyton were important lace making places. The finished goods were then brought together in Honiton from where they were sent to London. At the next meeting, on Oc¬ tober 4th, the talk is entitled 'It's a Vet's Life' and there will be Harvest Lunch beforehand. For more information contact Elizabeth Harding on 01297 624250. J UST when I thought we were making some headway with reducing the stigma around mental health issues, Poundland have reignited my fears that this clearly isn't the case. I was at the self service ma¬ chine, paying for some inevitably low quality colouring pencils and spotted one of their own brand snacks, marauding as a packet of peanut m&m's. That wasn't what bothered me though. The name of the eye catching snack was 'Nutters'. Yes, I get that they are doing some kind of pun on the fact that they are chocolate covered peanuts, but that isn't where it ended. The images on the front (pictu¬ red below) were of sugar coated peanuts with deranged looking faces and big bites out of where their brains would be. Mental health campaigners have said that they can't believe these were allowed to get to the shelves and are distressed and disgusted by the design. In a statement Poundland have said: \"These chocolate-covered nuts have been a customer favourite over the last 12 months and that popularity suggests it hasn't caused offence to them.\" I'm not sure I agree. Just be¬ cause lots of people have bought them it doesn't mean that thou¬ sands more aren't upset and of¬ fended by it. I understand that this was prob¬ ably not their intention and I'm sure the thinking behind it wasn't malicious. However, this is the kind of thing that perpetuates the stigma surrounding mental health issues and the fact that people in the industry overlook the effect these messages can have is worrying. Especially with all the work going on to raise awareness of this subject. Norman Lamb, of the Liberal Democrats, whose 29-year-old son Archie has suffered with Ob¬ sessive Compulsive Disorder, said the word nutter is \"pejora¬ tive\" and \"not the sort of expres¬ sion we should be using these days\". He continued: \"If you just say nothing and allow these prod¬ ucts to be normal practice, it per¬ petuates a negative view of mental health - that there's something weird and odd about you. \"We need to be doing much more to recognise that it's noth¬ ing to be ashamed of and embar¬ rassed about and encourage young people to get help.\" This follows the news that over 25 per cent of people with a mental illness receiving Disability Living Allowance, have been re¬ fused Personal Independence Payment when being reassessed. The fact checking society. Full Fact, are currently looking into this and also whether or not they are receiving less benefit than before. It seems pretty clear to me that we are still living in a world where mental health is not considered to be as important as physical health. Even though research shows, time and time again, that the body heals quicker when the pa¬ tient has good mental health and people are less likely to get ill in the first place. Focusing on treating mental health issues when they first ap¬ pear could have a huge impact on saving money for the NHS in the long term. But I feel like this doesn't seem to register with the powers that be. But things are not all doom and gloom. There are pockets of in¬ credibly dedicated people who are doing some really positive work all over the country. I really do feel that things are starting to move in a positive di¬ rection in the general population, no matter how long it takes for that to filter back up to the top... ■ FENITON FLOWER AND CRAFT SHOW: The annual show was held recently with a total of 396 entries from 67 exhibitors. The period leading up to the show had not been good for the flowers with several days of strong winds and heavy rain. However, a good standard of entries were ex¬ hibited across the full range of classes. Mike Hawkins had another successful day winning the trophies for the vegetables, flow¬ ers and dahlias. He also achieved the most points in the show with Adam Carnall being the runner-up. Maggie Pipe won the cup for most points in the flower arrangement section and Les Ley came out on top in the cookery section with Jenny Broom picking up the award for the best exhibit. There was a particularly large entry in the craft section with the main winners being Mar¬ garet Imms, Bill Knollman and Lindsay Hamil¬ ton. The junior classes were split into two age groups and Finlay Barrass won the cup for 10 years and under with Alex Maries triumphing in the 11 to 16 group. India Morgen, Oliver White and Abigail Maries also did well in the Junior section. Brian Carnall was awarded the Parish Coun¬ cil Trophy for the best front garden. The flower ghow committee are grateful for the help of all those who provided sponsorship by way of vouchers for the various winners.

The ever-popular family fun dog show at¬ tracted 64 entries and judges commented that all the owners were extremely well-behaved. Other acts and activities enjoyed by the crowds included: Garwynn’s Reptiles and Bugs, Nerf/Battle Archery, Punch and Judy, Ash Wallis HB Act, Chard Evolution Ma¬ jorettes, The Dorset Youth Marching Band, Ma- jidah Tribal Belly Dancers and Chardstock’s very own morris troupe, The Chancers and Prancers. There were 65 stalls, selling goods and pro¬ duce which ranged from honey to walking sticks. The hugely popular paper-plane distance fly¬ ing competition, as well as other activities, took place in St Andrews’ Church, with the winning distance being 20.5 metres. The display of classic cars, competition cars, motorbikes and tractors attracted more than 58 exhibits with two magnificent Rolls-Royces ar¬ guably the stars of the show. Large crowds enjoyed a great range of live music, throughout the day, provided by The Liberty Sisters, Mydep, Eliezer, Mischa and his Merry Men, The League of Ukulele Gentlemen, the IOUs, Plain Sailing, The Jurassix, the Muzax and Rock the Night. Co-organiser Graham Vyse said: “Money is still coming in and there are some bills to be paid but the Street Fayre Team confidently pre¬ dict that more that £3,000 will have been raised to support local good causes including The Pro¬ ject, Devon Freewheelers, Devon Air Ambu¬ lance, Chardstock Community Hall Trust and Chardstock Cricket Club. “This sum will be further boosted by almost £1,000 raised by the Great Chardstock Duck Race and a pub quiz held earlier in the year. “The Street Fayre Team wishes to thank all those who supported the event in any way; the sponsors, the stallholders, exhibitors, the bands, the helpers and all those who attended and gave their money so generously; it was a fabulous day in a wonderful village. “It was also a great day on Saturday for one of our beneficiaries, Chardstock Cricket Club, who won the Devon D 1st XI League and clinched promotion by beating Barnstaple and Pilton in a close run match. Well done, CCC.” The game was played just up the road in Chardstock, and fayre visitors were updated through the fayre tannoy.

Millway Rise Ind Estate Axminster EX13 5HU 22 Tuesday, September 19th 2017 EDU CATION www.viewnews.co.uk THE Woodroffe School is in many ways something of a hidden gem. Despite its rural location, it is one of the highest performing comprehensive schools in the West Country. In 2017, its GCSE results were stunning, with 84% of students achieving at least 5 A*to C/4 grades, including English and Maths. 90% of students achieved a new standard pass in English, with a re¬ markable 79% achieving a strong pass; 88% of stu¬ dents gained a standard pass in Maths, with 68% a strong pass. Woodroffe has a thriv¬ ing sixth form which of¬ fers over 25 A-Level courses and a unique combination of academic support and pastoral care. Students leave Woodroffe to go to uni¬ versities all over the country, including Oxbridge and the Russell Group universities. The school has a na¬ tional reputation based on its work as a Teaching School (it leads an al¬ liance of twenty sec¬ ondary and around thirty primary schools - a group which includes both a grammar and an HMC in¬ dependent school). It is also one of only 30 Na¬ tional Maths Hubs, pro¬ moting Maths education across the South West. Rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted, Woodroffe is renowned for its pastoral care, its unrivalled range of extra-curricular activi¬ ties and its intense focus on learning. The school offers a unique blend of the traditional and the in¬ novative: students are re¬ markably well behaved, uniform is worn with pride and there is a real atmosphere of warmth and good will. And yet, the school has a forward- looking curriculum em¬ bracing both new technology (it is one of a handful of schools in the country equipped with a Lego Innovation Studio) and traditional academic subjects such as lan¬ guages and classics.

Due to the strong bonds formed with fam¬ ilies and a focus on self-help skills, children who remain with Pink Hippo throughout their early years are confident, ready and able to take the big step to move on to school and greater independence. Their fa¬ cilities include a dedicated sensory room and a large outdoor area, which has been developed to support the individual ways children learn. The dynamic curriculum and learning in¬ tentions are always based around children's individual interests and needs, with an em¬ phasis on them having a 'hands on' learning experience. Outings into the local commu¬ nity are key to achieving this including Axe Estuary Wetlands, the Donkey Sanctuary, Li¬ brary, and School. The latest focus is on de¬ veloping links with a local Residential Home for the elderly, with regular visits and activ¬ ities planned which benefit all involved. Government funded sessions for eligible 2, 3 and 4 year olds are available and the setting has the flexibility to provide ongo¬ ing and wrap around care for working par¬ ents or those who would simply like their child to socialise with others in a safe, stim¬ ulating and fun environment.
