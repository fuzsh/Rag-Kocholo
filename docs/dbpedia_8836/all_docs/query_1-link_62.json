        "text": "The population of Devon and Cornwall is about 1.7 million, nearly 3% of the population of England.\n\nArgyle are the biggest club in the two counties and should have the pick of young players, so you could argue that proportionate to that, roughly one out of every thirty or so English footballers should be coming through the ranks at Home Park (meaning say, six or so players in every age group who go on to have a good pro career).\n\nThere are reasons why that's a bit simplistic, but we should surely be averaging a couple of pro standard players per year, and at least one of Premier League/Championship level. There are well over a dozen or so players from Devon and Cornwall playing in the top two divisions, which I think demonstrates that this is totally realistic.\n\nAs it is, since Adam Randell (plus Klaidi Lolos in the same cohort) we have now had three straight year groups go through without producing a single pro player.\n\nIt's massive under performance that costs the club a lot of good players and millions of pounds in revenue but because it's not really visible it gets overlooked. I fear there is quite a lot that we are getting badly wrong.\n\nNot sure about the 12 players from the Championship/Premiership nor that at least 1 per year of premier/ championship ability. Obviously Watkins , Randell and Cooper , Christian Walton , Freddy Issaka ( just) , Matt Grimes , Adam Stansfield.\n\nPlayers are starting to come through and the under 16s have done well this year and we did well in the Milk Cup last season but it’s a long process .\n\nObviously it’s a big step from the under 18s to the Championship and the Club are going to need to decide how they bridge that gap - some players may “ only” be L1 or L2 level .Lolos is arguably a good example - you could take the view that he’s now more proven that Waine .\n\nIt’s not necessarily about only selling upwards but also downwards ( with sell on fees) as well . Exeter through necessity have been much better at promoting from their Academy although obviously at a lower level . The fact that we are in the Championship and the new Academy should help in attracting young players. With our development centres in Cornwall we should be picking up all of their talent .\n\nYou can’t though rule out “ poaching “ from the Premiership as happened with Harry McGlinchey who went to Chelsea at 14 for £30/40k .\n\nThe population of Devon and Cornwall is about 1.7 million, nearly 3% of the population of England.\n\nArgyle are the biggest club in the two counties and should have the pick of young players, so you could argue that proportionate to that, roughly one out of every thirty or so English footballers should be coming through the ranks at Home Park (meaning say, six or so players in every age group who go on to have a good pro career).\n\nThere are reasons why that's a bit simplistic, but we should surely be averaging a couple of pro standard players per year, and at least one of Premier League/Championship level.

I fear there is quite a lot that we are getting badly wrong.\n\nWe are very much in the speculate to accumulate stage...all out, nothing in. Until we sell a homegrown player we will be running the academy at a loss. If the rumours about Cooper are true then that will be the first return, hopefully subsidising the source. Until we convert trainees into established pros then that sell model will be needed. Of course the other return on the youth is high performing players in the team achieving success(or heading off failure like this year)...we are almost at the point where the sell model might come to bear, but we are not yet close on the second area(for a few years now) and an earlier poster hit the nail on the head... we are getting good youngsters but the train slows or stops when they reach 1st year pro. We don't have an established pathway, There is no reserve football so loans are the only option. The local teams are just the 1st stepping stone level... the parkways, Truro or Weymouth are great to start with but better players play with better players. Endacott played in league 1. Playing for Tavistock may give minutes but little else(not meant to insult the club or that level, but he trained with championship level players then played with much lower level ones... that must have been demoralising). The other aspect of young players is they are not oven ready so need 2 maybe 3 years of further development, steadily increasing the standard. The issue with that, especially at a lower level is the club need to support the youngsters for longer...as each year graduates that will start to add up and drains the budget. I assume that is why we let go the likes of Pursall and not Halls and Endacott. The counter is, how many players that we let go prove the decision wrong? Not many, but I think it is to simplistic to say they are all not good enough, it takes a lot to move on, prove yourself again after that rejection.\n\nI believe Brentford ditched this model after assessing that the investment did not deliver the value and you can see some merit in that, but they are in London, where I would say running the B team model is much easier to sustain.\n\nFinal point is that the higher the level of the first team the less opportunities there are... you just can't learn on the job and when you get an upwardly mobile team like we have been the trainees are having to keep up as everything around them gets better.\n\nI'm not sure what my overall point is really, but aside from some burgeoning starlets...maybe Freddie... the system is not there yet...hopefully the club have a plan else we will keep graduating and keep releasing.\n\nNot sure about the 12 players from the Championship/Premiership nor that at least 1 per year of premier/ championship ability.

Do they have a 'reserve' team in a local men's league or are they just better at picking suitable loan clubs than we are?\n\nThey have a much better record than we do of making sure their most promising youngsters don't hit a dead end in their development, so what are they doing they we aren't?\n\nWhat do Exeter do with their young pros?

It maybe their lower league position and shortage of funds to buy means they get the younger players in and around the 1st team after the loan periods . They still use the local teams(there are people popping up at Truro and parkway). Ollie watkins was at Weston-super-Mare. I don't think they have reserve football.\n\nThe other point I forgot in my original post is that for the last few years our youth teams have become more competitive against their peers...and this year even more so however the leagues look to be of variable quality. It is the FA youth cup where they get matched against the bigger clubs. The quality does seem to be improving...ie the raw material it is just those next steps that need sorting.\n\nUltimately no matter what club the odds on becoming a pro are very long and then year on year, remaining one...I imagine there are several hundreds being released again this year."
