        "text": "Emre Asikci\n\nEnglish player Jay Stansfield took his father's retired number nine shirt that his dad wore at the EFL League One club Exeter City.\n\n\"It means a lot to be wearing number nine. I know the pressure will be high, but it felt the right thing to do. I will be proud to wear it and follow in his footsteps and beyond,\" Stansfield said after the signing ceremony.\n\n\"This is the perfect opportunity for me to come and develop as a player, get some game time and gain some experience. I'm so ready to come and play,\" he added.\n\nExeter City had retired the number nine shirt as a mark of respect to their former player Adam Stansfield, who died of bowel cancer at the age of 31 in 2010.\n\nAdam Stansfield played for Exeter between 2006 and 2010, scoring 39 goals in 160 matches.\n\nJay, 19, started his career at the Exeter City Academy before inking for Fulham in August 2019.\n\nOn Friday, Exeter City had announced signing Stansfield on loan from Premier League club Fulham for the 2022-23 season."
