The Keep South Street Open campaign has been set up by local business owners with the support of Bridport Business Chamber to high¬ light the affects the closure - which would cost between £20,000 and £50,000 - will have on their businesses, as well as safety concerns, effects on the Bridport community and employment. A consultation launched by Bridport Town Council is currently underway for people to have their say on a trial three-month closure of South Street - from the town hall to Gundry Lane - next year.

She said: “There doesn’t seem to be any logi¬ cal reason to do it, it just seems to be something that they think might be a good idea. “We have contacted the town council and asked for them to tell us why they want to do this, but have received nothing. “We thought, we have got to do something about this. “Dad (Glyn Peach, owner of Peach Electri¬ cals) has been here for 30 years so we know our business, and we say it is a bad idea and we are not being listened to, which is why the cam¬ paign started. “We feel we are being railroaded into this trial, which could be the death of us, and there is no reasoning behind it.” Mark Dicker, of Animal House on South Street, agreed and said: “We are small, family run, independent businesses, we are not con¬ glomerates. “A company like Fat Face can stand six months of the business going a little bit hay¬ wire, because that is all part of it, but we can’t. “As an aspiration it seems really great, but it just doesn’t hold up, it makes no sense whatso¬ ever.” Bob Gillis, town clerk, said Bridport Town Council met with businesses at a meeting prior to the consultation starting, as well as alerting business owners when it started, in order to keep them informed on the process. He said: “The proposal to consult on this issue was a priority project in the council’s town plan and the town council took the decision to consult after considering a detailed report ear¬ lier this year.” This report is available on the town council website at www.bridport-tc.gov.uk The report states that the option to close South Street has been raised on numerous oc- ■ THE generous people of Bridport have stepped up to the mark again to enable a Shelter Box to be sent to the Caribbean to aid relief efforts following Hurricane Irma. Members of the Rotary clubs of Brit Valley and Brid¬ port collected £590 in less than three hours last week. This has also been matched by Bridport Rotary Club, with an additional donation of £590 from club funds. The charity report that a total of four Shelter Box response teams have been deployed to help families who have lost everything - 300 shelter kits are now in Antigua, with the remaining 200 en route to St Kitts and Nevis. Another team is going to the Dominican Republic, where they are hoping to pro¬ vide a further 500 boxes, whilst a fourth team is in the British Virgin Islands. Phil Payne, president of Brit Valley Rotary Club, and Bernard Pauli, president of Bridport Rotary Club, pictur¬ ed above collecting with Ro- tarian Mike Conway, said: \"The collection was a great joint effort for a very good cause. \"Because Rotary members are volunteers, every penny goes to Shelter Box. \"On behalf of our two clubs, we would like to say a big thank you to the people of Bridport, and quite a few vis¬ itors, for their generosity.\" casions by residents. A feasibility study for the options for South Street was undertaken by Dorset County Council in 2016, which included one way systems, full closure, shared space and occasional closure. ■ CONTINUED ON PAGE 3 GLASS & MIRRORS CUT TO SIZE GLAZING, GREENHOUSE GLASS DOUBLE GLAZED UNITS UPVC WINDOWS & UPVC SPARES Wlh Centre dJM j ESTABLISHED 33 YEARS | Wall and Floor Tiles, V safety flooring and carpets sales@bridportglassandtile.co.uk | www.bridportglassandtile.co.uk Monday to Friday 8.00am-5.00pm Saturday By appointment Telephone: 01308 427281 Carpets | Karndean | Wood | Vinyls | Bespoke Rugs Wells Carpet Come & see our vast selection of floorings over 2 showrooms All at competitive prices 01297 33771 www.wellscarpetbroker.co.uk sales@wellscarpetbroker.co.uk Castle Hill, Axminster, EX13 5PY Bridport Ba®ifersi Digital Print Banws Flags llillll 01308 459688 4a St Michaels I/E _ Free initial consultation Lexcel Law Society Accredited jT'% ii kj n • Buying & Selling Property • Business Issues • Agricultural Issues • Wills • Powers of Attorney • Trusts & Estates • Matrimonial and Family • Resolving Disputes • Negligence Claims • Employment • Debt Recovery Axminster Chard Lyme Regis 01297 32345 01460 63336 01297 443777 www.scottrowe.co.uk blue box RESIDENTIAL ESTATE AGENTS Sell your home from £649 01297 444687 info@blueboxresidential.com www.blueboxresidential.com D W MOTORS SU TEL 013C8 488 420 PARK DTt 108 ■ MOTS i.k SERVICING & REPAIRS FREE COLLECTION FREE COURTESY CARi YOUR TOWN, YOUR NEWS...YOUR VIEW - across West Dorset 2 Wednesday, September 20th 2017 DORSET www.viewnews.co.uk Gel in touch...

It comes after health chiefs re¬ vealed their recommendations for the biggest shake-up of ser¬ vices in a generation after months of campaigning and con¬ sultation. Recommendations were made a week ahead of a meeting where the NHS Dorset CCG governing body will make final decisions on its controversial Clinical Ser¬ vices Review which aims to plug a £158 million projected deficit by 2020. Dorset County Hospital will re¬ main as both an emergency and planned site with health bosses conceding a maternity and pae¬ diatrics unit should now remain for patients in the west of the county. It comes following a successful campaign to Save Kingfisher Ward with new options to be considered by both the Dorch¬ ester-based hospital and Yeovil District Hospital under new pro¬ posals which will go out for a second public consultation. This is instead of a move to centralise services in the east of the county. Delighted hospital campaigner Naomi Patterson said: “This is great news and shows the CCG recognises what we have been saying. “Our campaign aimed to demonstrate that it was vital to have paediatric-led services in the west of the county and I am massively proud they have lis¬ tened to us. If it wasn’t for our campaign group highlighting this issue we would be seeing services going to the east.” She added: “We now want to know what will happen with op¬ tions for Yeovil and DCH. I’d like to see people get together to have the best possible outcome for everyone.” Royal Bournemouth Hospital (RBH) is still the preferred major emergency centre which would leave Poole Hospital with no A&E but a 24/7 urgent care centre. This would mean Poole’s maternity and paediatric ser¬ vices would move to RBH. Dorset CCG chief officer Tim Goodson said: “We think this will secure a great future for all three of our acute hospitals. There will remain 24/7 urgent care facilities on all three. We did some further travel analysis but should emphasise we are trying to promote less travel to the acute sites by doing more in the community hubs by creating more alternatives to urgent care and extending GP access as well. “We are very confident this is the right course action to take. We think it will save lives and create better outcomes.” Many beds have been saved in community hospitals due to suc¬ cessful campaigns including at Westhaven Hospital in Wey¬ mouth until ‘a sustainable model for future services’ is es¬ tablished. Other community hubs with beds are set to be located at Wey¬ mouth Hospital as well as Brid¬ port, Swanage and Sherborne. Community care hubs without beds are set for Portland. Dorset police train dogs to sniff out digital data DORSET Police and Devon & Cornwall Police are once again leading the way in investing in cutting edge ways to tackle crime. Hot off the heels of being the first police forces in the UK to set up a dedicated drone unit, the op¬ erations department has now announced that it has trained two digital storage detection police dogs. Dorset Police and Devon & Cornwall Police have added to their ranks police dogs Tweed and Rob. Tweed a 19-month-old Springer Spaniel and Rob a 20-month-old black Labrador are the first police dogs in the UK, and the only dogs outside of the USA, to be trained to detect digital storage de¬ vices. Chief Superintendent Jim Nye, Commander for the Alliance Operations Department, said: “This is an historic step for the alliance and policing in the UK. These dogs will give the police a new way to fight the threat of terrorism, paedophiles and fraudsters. “Tweed and Rob have been used by police at crime scenes and executions of warrants, not just within Cornwall, Devon and Dorset, but across the whole UK. “The dogs have been used to sniff out data de¬ vices such as mobile devices, USB sticks, SD cards, hard drives and computers. “Once again, we have shown that we are pre¬ pared to look at new technology and will always strive to get one step ahead to tackle criminality.” In May 2015, Police Constable Graham Attwood, who is a police dog instructor for the team, began to research the ability to train such a dog. PC Attwood identified that the first dogs in the world to train in digital storage detection were trained at the Pioneering Connecticut State Police Dog unit in the USA. Following his collaboration with Connecticut State Police and the FBI, a pilot scheme was started in December 2016. PC Attwood, said: “Myself and members of the alliance dog school initially handled and trained Tweed and Rob mainly in our own time as we were committed to our usual daily duties of train¬ ing the forces other operational police dogs. “The majority of the dogs we have in both forces either come from our puppy breeding scheme or are gift or rescue dogs but, as this was a unique challenge for us, we identified and purchased Tweed and Rob last December when they were around 15 months old and embarked on this jour¬ ney with them.” PC Attwood, added: “Our digital dogs have al¬ ready proven to be a success and have been used in over 50 warrants executed across the UK, in¬ cluding Hampshire, Essex, South Wales and North Yorkshire. “We have already seen some really fantastic re¬ sults from these two dogs. Tweed on one warrant indicated that something may have been within what looked like a cola can. This was then in¬ spected by a search officer and discovered that it was actually a money box which had a number of SD cards hidden within it. “Rob has also indicated a small device hidden carefully in a drawer which would have likely to have been missed by the human eye, which just goes to show that they are able to locate these items, which assists us greatly with our searches.” Rob and Tweed are part of a trial and the forces will assess the success of these dogs and their new skills at the end of the 2017 with a view to rolling this out wider. The dogs live at home with their new full time police dog handlers, PC Martin King and PC Jill Curnow. Hangar 1. Marcus Road Dunkoswcll.

The bus company report that they were ad¬ vised by DCC on what was the best route and times for the service. The timetable published by First Dorset was slammed by councillors last week, calling it a “disaster” and an “absolute dog’s dinner”. A spokesperson for First said: “The original service 40 was run on a commercial basis by Damory but, unfortunately, they withdrew it from the end of July. “Since then, Dorset County Council has re¬ placed this lost route on a temporary basis. “The council has now enlisted our help to re¬ place some of the service between the school transport routes that we currently operate in this area. “Due to our commitment to providing the school services, we are unable to replicate the timetable exactly to fit around our current op¬ eration. “However, between 9am and 2pm, Monday to Friday, the council has recommended the most effective routes and areas to serve throughout the day, which we have agreed to do, ultimately keeping this route from being lost entirely. “We hope that the revised timetable will still offer enough capacity for the majority of the regular passengers to make their desired jour¬ neys. “We encourage residents of Broadwindsor and Gerrards Green to explore options avail¬ able through community transport, which may better fit their needs.” Cllr Jacqui Sewell, Dorset County Councillor for Broadwindsor, said she would like to know what evidence Dorset County Council based Lottie Welch Reporter \\ lottie@viewnews.co.uk these recommendations to First on. A spokesperson for DCC said that Yeovil is only included due to their recommendation. They said: “The original offer from First was a Bridport to Beaminster service. “Using passenger number information from Damory and from our own running of the ser¬ vice, we suggested that they included Yeovil in the service.” Cllr Sewell also explained that the village had four social housing estates/units - which would greatly affect those residents who rely on a bus service - and said that one of the resi¬ dents told her they were “virtually in prison” without the bus service. Magna Housing Association have social homes in Gerrards Green in Beaminster, Broadwindsor and Court Orchard in Bridport - all of which are no longer served by the bus. Tony Murray, housing director, said: “We have seen bus services cut over the years and we know that the lack of public transport in rural areas affects the demand for our proper¬ ties and therefore access to affordable rented housing. “It is not just elderly people who may be re¬ luctant to drive, but also families with children who don’t want to be confined to a village where there is no bus service or who need to get to work. “The more the bus services are cut, the harder we find it to let our properties and the fewer affordable housing options there are available to local people.” DCC say that discussions are continuing about the No 40 service to provide a suitable service for residents and that it will continue to gather information that allows it to make in¬ formed decisions, with their travel team con¬ tinuing to explore the options. Cllr Daryl Turner, the council’s cabinet mem¬ ber for built and rural environment, said: “We need to balance the local needs of residents with the realities of the numbers of people using these services. “The county council’s policy to remove bus subsidies means that a more flexible and com¬ munity driven solution is needed, DCC has had excellent success working with communities using our toolkit.” The toolkit can be found at www.dorsetfor you.com/communitytransport A spokesperson for DCC added: “There are a number of people in Broadwindsor, Gerrards Green and Netherbury who will not be serviced by the new timetable, and a collectively agreed community transport solution will be investi¬ gated to address this concern and we will be working with the communities to help them find solutions. “Students to Yeovil College and the Sir John Colfox Academy are serviced by the current bus, however, the timings are not ideal. “From Monday (September 18th) the council will operate a 7.30am service from Bridport to Yeovil College. “This is not a public service and there will be no fares as we are providing a service for the college. They [the college] will contribute to this and it will form a community college ser¬ vice. “Another issue that has been raised is the re¬ quirement for residents to attend Bridport Hos¬ pital. This connection is mostly used as a short hop from the town itself. Further discussions with the Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group will look at support for this. “Over the next three months, the council will continue to work with DCC withdraw Vearse Farm objections DORSET County Council as the highway authority (HA) has withdrawn its objections to the controversial Vearse Farm development in Brid¬ port. The authority has given the plans for 760 new homes its approval, following the sub¬ mission of revised transport plans from developer's Hal- lam Land Management. A spokesperson for the county council said: \"The submitted indicative site lay¬ out plan indicates a road lay¬ out that is suitable for public adoption under Section 38 of the Highways Act 1980 and fully embrace the princi¬ ples suggested by Manual for Streets (a guide for new streets and modification of existing ones), providing a safe and attractive place for all road users.\" The county council said that speeds of 20mph or less should be achieved through the site and that the plan in¬ dicated \"quality\" pedestrian and cycle links to Bridport's existing network is achiev¬ able. The spokesperson added: \"The submitted transport as¬ sessment (TA) has, in the opinion of the county high¬ way authority, complied with the recommendations of the TRICS Good Practice Guide 2013 (the national standard for trip generation) and pro¬ duced a robust daily trip generation for the proposed development. \"The conclusion reached within the TA is that all of the junctions assessed will oper¬ ate within capacity in the forecast design year for the proposed development. \"The TA confirms that the local highway network has sufficient capacity to safely accommodate the additional development traffic move¬ ments. The HA concurs with this view.\" To sum up, the highway au¬ thority considered the trans¬ port assessment to be \"satisfactory and robust\". The spokesperson said: \"Whilst it is accepted that the proposal will obviously in¬ crease traffic flows on the highway network, the resid¬ ual cumulative impact of the development cannot be thought to be 'severe', when consideration is given to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). \"All of these matters have been carefully considered by the HA and, following the submission of revised and updated information, there are no reasons for objection and the following revised de¬ cision issued.\" The approval follows objec¬ tions from Bridport Town Council and members of Ad- vearse, who complied a dossier highlighting the pos¬ sible traffic issues if the de¬ velopment goes ahead, which can be found at https://goo.gl/cwpsF4 The document includes photos and information of current traffic problems in West Allington and West Road, which campaigners say would be increased if the development was given the green light. A spokesperson for Ad- vearse said: \"When consider¬ ing this application, Advea- rse believes that West Dorset District Council should seri¬ ously consider the conse¬ quences for local residents and the duty of care it owes to members of the public. \"We believe that approval of this application may en¬ danger residents because of the shortcomings of the ac¬ cess routes between the site and Bridport town centre. \"The travel plan linked to the application will encour¬ age residents of the Vearse Farm development to walk and cycle from the site rather than use their cars, but the local highway network al¬ ready suffers from inade¬ quate and dangerous links to Bridport town centre - en¬ couraging more people to use them is irresponsible and an abandonment of duty of care. \"WDDC faces a dilemma; in refusing this application, could the authority incur legal costs resulting from an appeal or, by its approval, should it risk both public safety and public funds re¬ sulting from an accident and subsequent litigation. \"The prime duty of local planning authority is towards the people of West Dorset, not central government. \"We believe WDDC has le¬ gitimate grounds for refusing this application.\" Advearse urges everyone who objected to the Vearse Farm application to attend the planning meeting in Dorchester when WDDC in¬ form those who commented on the proposal of the time and date of the hearing - currently set for October 12th. Members of the public are allowed to address the plan¬ ning committee for up to three minutes providing they notify WDDC in advance. communities, compa¬ nies providing com¬ munity transport and the schools and col¬ leges to iron out these issues.” ■ CONTINUED FROM PAGE1 However, members of the town council’s highways working group noted that the traf¬ fic modelling so far undertaken cannot accu¬ rately predict the impact on traffic. Mr Gillis added: “The town council feels that to accurately assess the impact of the clo¬ sure of South Street, a temporary trial closure for up to three months should be considered. “However, before a decision is taken on whether to apply to the county council for a trial closure, it was agreed that a consultation should be undertaken to seek the views on the proposal and give everyone an opportunity to comment. “The town council will be keen to discuss the results of the consultation with the Cham¬ ber of Commerce and other key stakeholders and the town council will then decide on the next steps and whether to make a recommen¬ dation to DCC, who as the highway authority will have to agree any proposals for traffic management changes. “The chamber and local businesses will con¬ tinue to be kept fully informed at all stages of the process.” Members of the campaign also raised the issue that there are many misconceptions to the closure, including that the market would operate on the section of closed road, the amount of access vehicles will have in rela¬ tion to deliveries, residents and emergency services and what will constitute a perma¬ nent closure and who will decide. Bridport Business Chamber has published a leaflet recommending people to say no to the trial closure, stating a number of issues it could bring to the town. The consultation is open until October 1st and is available at www.bridport-tc.gov.uk with hard copies at Bridport Library, Mount- field and Bridport Tourist Information Cen¬ tre. . 1 § BOILERMAN 1 \\V LTD OIL & GAS HEATING & BOILER MAINTENANCE Breakdown Repairs & Spares Telephone: 01308 424861 BEARNEsC-i- HAMPTON LITTLEWOOD auctioneers and valuers AUCTION VALUATIONS For a no fee or obligation valuation please contact Sally Bartlett on 01308 456208 Sold for £2,400 St. Edmund’s Court, Okehampton Street, Exeter.

EcoHomes meeting success solar energy growing at 35 to energy by 2030. 45 per cent every year, it is For more information visit likely to be the main source of bridport.greenopenhomes.net Coffee morning and book sale DOZENS of people turned out for a meeting to find out more about the developments in solar energy. The talk, organised by Tran¬ sition Town Bridport, was part of the Open EcoHomes event which is taking place until September 24th. Stuart Houghton, of Current Energy Solutions, outlined the advances in solar panels over the last 10 years. A spokesperson for Transi¬ tion Town Bridport said: “While they have become more reliable, the price of a typical installation has fallen from £15,000 to £4,500. “The main advance is in strong batteries, which allow people with solar panels to use the generated electricity in the evening or on dull days. “This allows householders to be nearly independent of mains electricity. “Renewable energy is fast becoming cheaper than nu¬ clear or even fossil fuels, but can only be relied on if we can store it.” This coming weekend gives the opportunity for the public to see battery storage in ac¬ tion. Ten homes are opening to show ways of cutting down en¬ ergy use, and three of them have installed battery systems to store their solar electricity. After Stuart’s talk on batter¬ ies, Joe Burlington outlined how fast the worldwide clean energy is moving, particularly in countries like Denmark, Germany and China and with MEMBERS of the West Bay Community Forum (WBCF) will be holding a coffee morn¬ ing and book sale this Thurs¬ day (September 21st) from 10am to 12noon at St John's Church in West Bay.

Who can you trust? Say one thing and do another! With all the statutory consultees (the Highways Agency, Highways England and the Environment Agency) closing ranks. West Dorset District Council will be laughing all the way to the bank and having its own way in pushing through such an outrageous planning applica¬ tion; and, moreover, preventing the townspeople having its say by hold¬ ing the Hearing of the Planning Ap¬ plication in Dorchester and causing many from attending because of work commitments and travel prob¬ lems. That in itself is a diabolical de¬ cision. The people most affected, and whose decision will be made for them, are not listened to - and, if they are, their words go in one ear and out the other! Localism provides that each com¬ munity should be able to influence what happens in its locality to a much greater extent that there has been as, in the past, there has been too much central government inter¬ ference. This has not been applied by West Dorset District Council. But again, does this surprise one? DAVID TETT, West Allington A good old fashioned cup match ■ MAY I through the columns of your new¬ spaper thank both Bridport FC and Cad¬ bury Heath FC for putting on what I would call a real good old fashion cup tie at St Mary’s last Satur¬ day. The atmosphere was pure electric and real theatre through¬ out the match. Both sets of players were a credit to them¬ selves along with both clubs, and it was a brilliant advert for Toolstation West¬ ern League football and the early stages of the Emirates FA Cup. So if you are not doing anything on a Saturday afternoon get on down to St Mary’s field to see some good football.

Traders unhappy with street closure plans ■ THE Keep Bridport’s Sou¬ th Street Open campaigners recognise that the Bridport Town Council consultation is not a vote and not a refer¬ endum. Eventually the town coun¬ cil will decide whether or not to proceed with their plans for a trial closure by submitting a proposal to Dorset County Council. The Keep Bridport’s South Street Open is a raising awareness campaign to let people know about the pro¬ posal, as there are many misconceptions - for insta¬ nce, the market will not all move to South Street, there will have to be some sort of traffic control at the Town Hall (to let pedestrians cross East/West Street) and to presumably let out any ve¬ hicles that get into South Street and cannot do a U- turn to get out due to lack of space, and the top of South Street will not be traffic free as access is needed for deliv¬ eries, emergency vehicles and residents. We believe many people who will be affected are not being adequately consulted or informed and the conse¬ quences for smaller lanes around the town are not being considered. More traffic will be using the A35, which is already gridlocked in the summer and accidents/incidents occur regularly at the roundabouts and the dan¬ gerous Miles Cross junc¬ tion. We feel the town council is trying to make Bridport a tourist/visitor town and is not taking fully on board that Bridport is a working, trading, market town. If you would like any fur¬ ther information, please see our Facebook page, which has over 300 members or contact the Bridport Town Council directly or through their consultation to ex¬ press your views. We encourage you to make your voice heard. DEBBIE BOND, Bridport let’s keep all options open South Street ■ LISTENING to the band playing in the sunshine I can understand the sentiment of the proposed changes to encourage community spirit. The traders of South Street who live in and around Bridport share the same good intention as the Bridport Town Council to maintain our lovely Bridport. I feel that there is genuine concern about the health of the high street in general and the closure of South Street could poten¬ tially cause problems. We share a common fear that Bridport could end up desolate like some other towns who do have traffic-free zones like Yeovil, Weymouth or Seaton. We all agree that traffic and parking are problems so hopefully the consultation process may provide an opportunity for us to try to sort it out. Temporary closure for big events has worked well in the past so perhaps we could just continue to close the road when needed? From a personal perspective, the team at Twist and Shout Osteopathic Health Cen¬ tre have concerns about patients'access to our practice as some can be temporarily disabled by pain but not \"qualify\" for dis¬ abled parking. At the moment we are easy to find and there are a couple of parking spaces, as well as disabled bays right outside our clinic. Many patients have discussed their con¬ cerns and added some additional com¬ ments; Could the function of the traffic-lights at the top of South Street be reviewed to see if the timing could be improved? Could there be a one-way traffic system instead of total closure? Perhaps direct the traffic in South Street travelling from Gundry Lane up towards Bucky Doo with a left turn into West Street. Also, discontinue the right turn into South Street from West Street. Could the funding be better spent on an overflow carpark or park and ride? (One suggested a pony and trap ride for sum¬ mer!) Could we keep flexible by only closing South Street on market days? With hope that all remain flexible about this matter!

Kathleen Caddick, a well known artist and much exhib¬ ited painter from Somerset, urged the members to ap¬ proach their work with the prime intention of enjoying the process. Reg Mussett, the other judge, a highly experienced art edu¬ cator and painter, encouraged entrants to relax into their work and let ideas flow and not to feel too constrained. The judges awarded the best in show to Jane Hooper for her acrylic painting ‘Pentle Bay’. Jane was also awarded the prize for acrylic paintings and the Peggy and Arthur Silk Award. The winners in other cate¬ gories were: Karen Hodgson - watercolour; David Kyle - oil, who also gained an aw¬ ard as a first time exhibitor; Mary Fowler - mixed med¬ ia; Heather Pope - pastel; and Bron Jones - print making. The judges commended the Lottie Welch | Reporter \\ lottie@viewnews.co.uk exhibits of Audrey Pewson, Angela Seckington, John Bird, Julia Cordy, Jo Strong, Douglas Drinnan, Pat Snel- grove, Phillipa Grier and Jan Workman. The many visitors to the ex¬ hibition voted ‘The Flood’ by Patricia Snelgrove the most popular painting, followed by ‘A Walk on Dartmoor’, a pas¬ tel by Heather Pope. Barry Allsop, president of Mosterton Art Group, thank¬ ed the committee for its work, especially Douglas Drinnan, the chair of the group, and also Jos Wallis for her admin¬ istration of the exhibition. Special mention was made of Pat Clayton and Linda Man- nion for their highly profes¬ sional hanging and display of the work. Mr Allsop also praised nine new members of the art group for exhibiting their work for the first time. • MOSTERTON Art Group meets on Tuesday afternoons at Mosterton Village Hall and attracts members from Bur¬ ton Bradstock, Beaminster, Bridport, Chard, Crewkerne and Yeovil. For more information, visit www.facebook.com/moster- tonartgroup New book celebrates the history of A NEW book detailing Parnham House's history as a design school has been launched. This month marks 40 years since courses first began at Parnham College near Beamin¬ ster, the famous design school created by John Makepeace OBE, that trained a new gener¬ ation of international design¬ ers. Celebrating the milestone an¬ niversary, John Makepeace, winner of the 2016 Prince Philip Designers Prize, has re¬ leased 'Beyond Parnham' - a 184-page book detailing Parn¬ ham College's vision and cul¬ tural legacy, revealing for the first time, highly personal re¬ flections from the designer- makers and the tutors who trained them. The limited edition book high¬ lights the history of the col¬ lege, the award-winning desig¬ ners that went there, accompa¬ nied with a range of photog¬ raphs and anecdotes. The college moved away from Parnham House in 2001, when John Makepace sold it to the late Michael Treichl. The house was ravaged by fire in April 2017.

They enjoyed a day-long workshop with Rob Mitchell and Kamina Walton (pictured) of Calling the Shots, with Megan Dunford of Bridport Arts Centre. Shopping catalogue party YOUNG people working to¬ wards the re-development of Bridport’s outdoor skatepark and the resurrection of the in¬ door Trick Factory are hoping to make a film about what they are striving to achieve. The group met with profes¬ sional film makers from the Bristol based production com¬ pany, Calling the Shots, and hope their creation will be shown through Channel 4’s ‘Random Acts’, which is dedi¬ cated to the arts and features expressions of creativity from the worlds of art, music, dance, animation, spoken word and performance. The group are also receiving help from Bridport Arts Cen¬ tre to develop their film. Megan Dunford, Bridport Arts Centre’s participation of¬ ficer, said: “Bridport Arts Lottie Welch Reporter \\ lottie@viewnews.co.uk Centre is really excited to be working with young people who use the skate park to de¬ velop their film making skills. “Calling the Shots and Ran¬ dom Acts offered us the chance to work with them to support young people in the area that have a particular idea about a film they want to make. “With generous support from Arthur Woodgate and the young people’s families, they will submit an applica¬ tion to Random Acts and, if successful, receive £5,000 and lots of support to make a film. “We are really excited about this opportunity and want to help them in any way we can to make this happen.” A day-long workshop headed by creative practitioners Ka¬ mina Walton and Rob Mitchell gave the young people the op¬ portunity to experience suc¬ cessful short films with specific themes, and to then experiment with film making themselves. A final brainstorming ses¬ sion threw up enough ideas to make an epic, let alone the three-minute short they even¬ tually hope to make if the funding comes through. Rob Mitchell congratulated the group - aged 13 to 21 - on the mutual support they had all shown one another throughout the day. Morgan Scadding, 16, agreed to lead the bidding process, with support from other young people, the arts centre and the Bridport Young Per¬ sons Action Trust (BYPAT). The skate park/Trick Fac¬ tory development is a partner¬ ship between BYPAT and Bridport Town Council, and also actively involves young people, a number of parents and grandparents and other interested adults.

The event is part of We Shall Overcome, a national week¬ end of gigs which will see more than 250 concerts across the UK - and beyond - all under one banner. We Shall Overcome is a com¬ munity effort led by musi¬ cians and music promoters who want to do something practical to help people in their area who are being hit by homelessness and poverty. Several thousand musicians will perform as audiences are encouraged to bring food for food banks or make donations to homelessness and other projects. The We Shall Overcome fundraiser at The Ropemakers will take place on Saturday, October 14th and the organis¬ ers hope this show of solidar¬ ity will also highlight the human cost to the politics of austerity. Organiser Keith Hatch said: “We Shall Overcome is very much a pro-community initia¬ tive with events the length of the country aimed at support¬ ing local projects. “We wanted to do our bit here in Bridport to show soli- Lottie Welch | Reporter \\ lottie@viewnews.co.uk darity and be part of some¬ thing big that is happening right across the country. “Cupboard Love has been doing a brilliant job providing food parcels to those in need in the area, and unfortunately the numbers that need to make use of their services con¬ tinues to grow. “I thought it really impor¬ tant to get involved in We Shall Overcome and support our local food bank.” Last year’s event raised more than £800 to help people in Bridport using the food bank, and this year organisers hope to top that.

Town council says no to North Mills homes plan PLANS to convert The James Building at North Mills into six homes have been recom¬ mended for refusal by Bridport Town Coun¬ cil. Members of the council's planning com¬ mittee met to discuss the revised applica¬ tion submitted by Montpellier Land and Developments Ltd, which included convert¬ ing the existing milling building into six homes, all with associated parking and pri¬ vate gardens, as well as amended plans for car parking. The plans now include provision for 10 parking spaces, rather than the previous 12 - which also prevented access to 7 North Mills - including allocated parking for existing residents. Residents of North Mills used the opportu¬ nity to raise their concerns with councillors. Paul Taylor said: \"In the revised plan they now offer to provide three spaces for exist¬ ing residents; beforehand it was going to be more spaces, and only three spaces are al¬ located to about seven or eight cars using this land for parking. \"The road is a single carriage way to a dead end and there is no extra parking ca¬ pacity anywhere at North Mills, so if this is to go ahead in its current form, it could well cause parking chaos for all residents of North Mills, not just the houses that adjoin the land. \"I think overdevelopment is an issue be¬ cause the proposed number of houses join¬ ing the land is going from four to 10, so though the building may be smaller, the amount of footfall, driving and so on is going to increase significantly.\" Ann Sparks, another resident at North Mills, said: \"I actually got all the residents to park their cars where they propose spaces will be, and we couldn't turn the cars round to get out of there, so that means no emer¬ gency services, no dustbins. \"There are too many houses for this to go ahead.\" Cllr Dave Rickard agreed that it would be over development and the number of extra cars would be too much. He said: \"Bridport's car parking spaces are very small, even in car parks, because their design specifications are 20 to 30 years old and cars are considerably bigger now. \"This is true down here too. I have parked down here on occasion and have had con¬ siderable difficulty finding a space to park and also more difficulty trying to get back out again. \"I think the impact of cars in this area is disingenuous, you can't just put some lines on a map and say, 'that's 12 spaces' - it really is down to the reality of the car move¬ ment. \"Looking at this, anything that stops a fire engine getting through from the estate to the street, or vice versa, we should not con¬ template.\" Cllr Sarah Williams said: \"I don't see this changes our views on this application. Something can be done in this building, just not quite this.\" The application can be found on www. dorsetforyou.gov.uk using application num¬ ber WD/D/ 17/001240.

Co-cars operates across the South West with its headquarters in Ex¬ eter. It aims to provide sustainable mo¬ bility for all by operating out of loca¬ tions in Dorchester, Salisbury, Cran- brook, Exeter, Newton Abbot, Chag- ford, Plymouth, Truro and Fal¬ mouth. Now, the team at Co-cars wants to bring a base to Bridport for residents to be able to have the use of their cars. Mike Hodgson, founder and manag¬ ing director of Co-cars, came to speak to members of Bridport Town Coun¬ cil with the idea of coming to the town. He said: “We have been talking to Bridport Co-housing about Co-cars (having their vehicles based at their site near Bridport Hospital), but I am also interested in cars being in Brid¬ port itself (the town centre). “We are in Dorchester and we have talked to Dorset County Council about options. “Bridport has got quite a name for itself in terms of what it does and as¬ pirations seem to fit quite well with what we are interested in. “What we want to do is have a think about where we could put one in the centre and we want to do a bit of promotion and events to see if peo¬ ple are interested - it would be a car for Bridport. Lottie Welch Reporter \\ lottie@viewnews.co.uk “If we had one at the co-housing and one in town, that gives you a bit of resilience in terms of at least there is another car around. “Ideally you will have more cars, but obviously we have got to be real¬ istic.” Mr Hodgson explained that they would want a central location on the road for the car, with its own dedi¬ cated space and electrical charging point. Cllr Dave Rickard suggested one of the electric charging bays in East Street car park as he felt that the use of them doesn’t warrant having two all the time, but Cllr Ros Kayes sug¬ gested Bucky Doo Square would be an ideal central location. Those who want to use the car join Co-cars for £25 a year and are able to book online via smartphone when they want to use it, and unlock their reserved hybrid car with their smartcard before entering a PIN number to drive it. When they are finished they just return the car to its dedicated parking bay. Membership covers fuel, insur¬ ance, breakdown cover, road tax and maintenance. It costs £3.75 per hour and 15p per mile to hire the car, or day rates from £25. The scheme helps to combat con¬ gestion, emissions and parking prob¬ lems, while also giving mobility to people. Cllr Kayes said that this could help commuters in the midst of buses being cut if Co-cars could offer an A to B service, rather than just the A to A option they currently offer. She said: “In the winter, the train service from London stops in Dorch¬ ester at about 8.15pm but the last bus back to Bridport leaves at 7.15pm, so we have had a lot of people who com¬ muted to London and were unable to get back. “If you had a system where you had a car in Dorchester that you could leave in Bridport, and then possibly even drive back, I think there would be a massive use of that. “A scheme like this, if you were able to get from A to B, would revo¬ lutionise transport for people. The issue is there are people who cannot commute. It would be wonderful if we could do car shares based on this type of thing and take several people and come back again and do that as their daily commute.” Mr Hodgson said that they would have to explore the option of A to B and that they are increasingly get¬ ting approached - including from many major employers - with the same request. Cllr Julian Jones highlighted that it is not a solution to buses between Bridport and Dorchester and that it is more important to get that service up and running. Cllr Dave Rickard said: “One of the problems in Bridport is that we are basically five or six parishes joined together and most of the problems we have are people who live in the outer parishes. “If they have to walk into Bridport to get a car, that is going to prevent people from using it as they have to get to town first.” Mr Hodgson explained that they do have a number of people who cycle to the cars and chain them up on the Co-cars sign post before taking the car. To find out more about the scheme, visit www.co-cars.co.uk Training exercise at West Bay WEST Bay will be the loca¬ tion of an Environment Age¬ ncy training exercise next week on Tuesday, Septem¬ ber 26th. Visitors to West Bay will see up to 60 metres of tem¬ porary coastal defence bar¬ riers deployed in East Beach car park in prepara¬ tion for any future tidal inci¬ dents. The barriers - one of four types used by the agency - are large, self supporting, recyclable containers filled with aggregate and are covered with an impenetra¬ ble membrane which pre¬ vents water from getting through. They are also fitted with a lid to prevent loss of fill ma¬ terial during over-topping and extreme weather con¬ ditions. Dan Hooper, exercise or¬ ganiser and engineer, said: \"West Bay is a high risk flood area because of strong south westerly winds, high tides and close proximity of properties to the sea and nearby River Brit, so it is essential we are 'incident-ready' by carrying out exercises like this. \"These barriers are rela¬ tively new to the agency, so this exercise provides us with an opportunity to get to grips with them - how we open, connect and fill them - using a stockpile of beach materials already lo¬ cated on site. \"Sharpening our practical skills and knowledge means we can better protect homes, businesses and the environment quickly and safely should a major inci¬ dent be expected in West Bay or anywhere along the Dorset coast.\" Partner agencies have been invited to observe the exercise, including repre¬ sentatives from the British Army, Dorset Local Re¬ silience Forum - including Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, local authorities, Dorset Police and the Civil Contingencies Unit - and the West Bay har¬ bour master. Part of the car park will be cordoned off, but vehicle users will still be able to ac¬ cess the remainder of the car park and beach. I Safe, Secure & very, very strong....

For a limited time, there is no charge for the museum and Local History Centre tours, how¬ ever, since it is a charity, a sug¬ gested donation of £3 per person is very welcome. The presentation at the town hall is charged at £5 per person. The curator, Emily Hicks, is also available to give talks to local groups.

These will be placed on tables and have two sides, one say¬ ing 'I am happy to chill' and the other saying 'I am happy to share this table' to encourage people to talk to each other. A spokesperson for the festival said: \"We are asking people to try and reduce loneliness which can lead to mental illness. \"The idea is that when you go into anywhere, you be aware of the people around you, and yeah, you actually smile and talk to each other. \"We know it is not terribly British, but why can't we talk to each other to make Bridport an even friendlier place than it is? To help with this, a number of locations will be having coasters on their tables. \"We are very grateful to Ian Dicks for drawing the cartoons. We hope that people will find them amusing and encourage people to talk to each other, but please respect those who just want to chill out.\" Any proprietors of an establishment that would like to have some coasters, please email info@bridportmindfest.org Organisers would also like to thank everyone who has helped fund the first Bridport Mind Fest to enable it to go ahead. The spokesperson added: \"Thank you to all the individuals for your kind and generous donations, to Bridport Town Council who started it off, the Bridport Round Table for fund¬ ing all our street banners, to Dorset County Council for fund¬ ing the festival for young people - it has been amazing.\" To find out more about the events on offer and to book, visit www.bridportmindfest.org There will also be a number of events for children, including a matinee of Disney's 'Inside Out', which will include free squash and biscuits.

The idea was raised by Cllr Kelvin Clayton at the council's recent environment and social wellbeing committee meeting. He said: \"I was approached by someone who commented on the lack of public art, bearing in mind it is such an arty town, think¬ ing there is probably scope for public art. \"Also my own experiences this summer going to different places and being aware of the amount of public sculpture there was and there is absolutely nothing in Bridport. \"It seems to me to be the right place with the number of artists here for public art and public sculpture. \"I mentioned this to Bob and I think the sug¬ gestion was that perhaps a number of coun¬ cillors that may be interested try to form a small working group with some of the local artists and just see what ideas we could come up with.\" Councillors agreed that a group should be set up to involve artists. Cllr Clayton added: \"I would love to think there is some kind of scope for an annual competition for a piece of public sculpture. \"It was just a thought but the more I think about it, the more Bridport should be avail¬ able for public art. \"One of the things we are looking at is roundabouts and a couple of people have also commented to me about how ugly the roundabouts are, how uninspiring they are when you come into town - a prime space for art and a sculpture.\" nections’ by Jane Feretzi Sheppard; ‘Caring for the Coast - The Next 100 Years’ by Tony Flux; ‘My Family and Other Smugglers’ by Roger Gutteridge; and ‘Working Be¬ hind the Scenes With The Na¬ tional Trust’ by Andrew McEl- wee.

This can only happen with the help of sponsored teams of adults and young people taking on the challenge of beating last year’s fantastic effort by Bridport Barracudas’ ‘Burkistic’ team of swimming 100 laps in 50 minutes. Now in its 25th year, the swimmers taking part in the event have raised nearly £70,000. To enter a team, pick up a form from Bridport Leisure Centre or visit www.bridportlions club.org Any companies that would like to sponsor the event, which takes place on Sunday, October 1st, or take part as a team, should contact Lucy Pauli on 01308 281621. Members would like to thank Amsafe in Brid¬ port who have once again agreed to act as the main sponsor for the fundraising event, and with the help of other local sponsors, this will help cover most of the event’s costs. This means that all money raised by the swimmers will go directly to charities. ■ THE annual Bridport Lions' Swimarathon ret¬ urns to the leisure centre next month. Pictured above are the Bridport Brownies team, from a previous event, with Lion Peter Garlick. Scrap store could return A SCRAP store could be returning to Bridport, following a request from a local artist to the town council. A proposal was put to councillors for help in finding a suitable location for a scrap store and community workplace where artists - among others - could source unusual materials, share ideas and make together; local businesses can also recycle materials otherwise headed for landfill. Bridport previously had a scrap store, which was run by Bridport TLC recycling project, but it closed in 2013. Now that the scrap store in Puddletown has closed, the closest to Bridport are now in Yeovil, Exeter and Poole. Scrap stores allow the town to reduce its waste, provide a creative materials resource and support its creative artists. The proposal was submitted to Bridport Town Council by Eileen Haste, which read: \"We ask that you consider the value and benefits such a project would provide and ask that you con¬ sider supporting it. \"Finding a venue is the biggest initial issue and our request is that you would support us in finding accommodation for the project. \"In order to maximise footfall and achieve op¬ timum accessibility, we suggest that it has a Bridport town address. \"While we appreciate buildings are at a pre¬ mium within Bridport, at the initial stage of such a project we would suggest that it would be feasible and indeed viable to start in a small setting, such as a temporary classroom placed on underused council town.\" Town clerk Bob Gillis suggested that they could include the project as a potential com¬ munity use of some of the buildings potentially coming to the town in the future. Cllr Dave Rickard said: \"If we or they can find a space, I don't see any problem with it. \"It was an enormous task persuading people, but I think the fact it has been done and there was one in Bridport as well, it is probably going to be a much easier task now the concept is there and the experience is there.\" Campaign for reusable water bottles THE Refill Dorset campaign, led by Litter Free Coast and Sea, will be receiving support from Bridport Town Council, with councillors suggesting options for Bridport. Initiatives are being pro¬ moted around the country to encourage people to use reusable water bottles. This includes a national cam¬ paign - 'Refill' - that aims to make refilling water bottles as easy, convenient and cheap as possible by introducing refill points on every street. The scheme aims to reduce plastic waste and there are cur¬ rently four premises in Bridport and one in Burton Bradstock acting as refill stations, which include: No 10 cafe bar; Aroma; Bearkat Bistro; The Green Yard Cafe and the Three Horseshoes pub. Members of the town coun¬ cil's environment and social wellbeing committee were asked to consider options to support the campaign. Bob Gillis, town clerk, said: \"One idea is to promote reusa ble water bottles branded with the successful branding we use on our market bags.\" This idea was supported by Cllr Kelvin Clayton who said: \"We have got other branded town items, we could easily do others and sell and promote it.\" Cllr Dave Rickard also raised the option of providing drink¬ ing water points in open public spaces in the town.

The Recycle for Dorset kerbside collection service has been in place for up to six years now and is working well. Dorset residents are among the country’s top recyclers, raising the recycling rate to almost 60 per cent - a fantastic achievement. But now that most people have become ex¬ perts at putting the right waste in the right bin, the DWP wants to go one step further and pre¬ vent that stuff ever being thrown away in the first place. It’s a common misconception that recycled material generates revenue for local councils. Recycling is significantly cheaper than house¬ hold rubbish to deal with, the latter of which can cost up to £130 per tonne to treat or send to landfill. But recycling still costs money to process - council tax money that would be better spent on other essential services. So the ‘Slim Your Bins’ campaign has been launched by the DWP to get residents to start reducing how much they throw away in terms of rubbish, recycling and food. The campaign will include roadshows across the county, starting in Bridport on Thursday September 21st with future dates and locations to be announced. The message of the “Slim Your Bins” campaign is simple:- • Recycling your waste is good - if you need to bin it, can it be recycled? • But reusing it is better - do you need to throw it away, or can it be used for something else? • And reducing your waste is best - could you avoid buying it in the first place? Creating less waste saves money for your household and council. By keeping rubbish and recycling out of your bins by not throwing it away in the first place, you can help protect the environment too. The campaign will provide useful advice for Dorset residents on how they can stop throw¬ ing so much away. Hints and tips include:- • Using cloth nappies instead of disposables • Avoid buying disposable items • Choosing products with less packaging • Home composting food waste Councillor Tony Alford, chairman of the Dorset Waste Partnership’s Joint Committee, said: “We’re incredibly proud of Dorset’s resi¬ dents and their continued recycling efforts. Thanks to you, we are recycling more than ever and even less rubbish is being treated or sent to landfill, which costs Dorset’s taxpayers over £8million every year. “But we know we can do even better. The bot¬ tom line is that the less waste we receive the bet¬ ter. This will help cut your shopping bill down, as well as save money for your local council.” ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE TIME TO TRANSFORM EYE HEALTH The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Specsavers are urging people to have regular eye tests to help maintain and protect their sight. Research* commissioned by the charity and high street opticians has revealed that one in five people will live with sight loss in their lifetime, despite at least half of all cases being avoidable. With nearly six million people in the UK currently living with sight-threatening conditions, nearly every family in Britain is touched by sight problems in some way. Specsavers’ clinical spokesperson Dr Nigel Best said: ‘Some people are waiting until they experience sight loss before booking an eye test, which means they are potentially prevent¬ ing their optician from detecting signs of eye health problems or other medical issues at an early stage. Early intervention is vital in the management and successful treatment of many conditions’ RNIB acting CEO Sally Harvey added: ‘We would encourage anyone who has put off going for an eye test to book one at the earliest opportunity.’ While sight is the nations most precious sense * YouGov Survey commissioned by Specsavers by far, with 78% of people polled saying it is the and RNIB 23rd , une _ 7th July 20 i 7 0 f 6,430 UK one they would least like to lose, a quarter of UK adults aged 18+ adults are still risking avoidable sight loss by not having had an eye test in the past 2 years. Of those who had not been for an eye test during that time period, 33% did not think that there was anything wrong with their eyes, while 24% said that they just didn’t have the time. Specsavers believes that eye care should be accessible to everyone. Specsavers Healthcall offers a free NHS sight test at home and a comprehensive home eye care service to those who cannot visit a store unaccompanied. As with all Specsavers staff, the home visiting teams are becoming Dementia Friends to help people with dementia recognise sight loss. The research reveals that only one in three people who qualify for a home visit are aware of the service. It is vital that, in an ageing society, we meet the needs of these vulnerable people and increase awareness. HERE IS MORE TO AN EYE TEST THAN JUST THIS Eye tests check more than your vision. They can also keep your eyes healthy and detect a range of health conditions. At least 50% of sight loss is avoidable.
