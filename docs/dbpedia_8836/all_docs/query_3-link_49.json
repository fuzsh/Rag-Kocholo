        "text": "9.30am: Good morning and welcome to our daily sports news blog. Throughout the day we'll update this page with stories, links and what's expected to happen in the hours ahead. Time permitting, we'll try to post below the line, answering your questions and comments.\n\n9.50am: Pop quiz hotshot: who also made their debut for England on the same night as David Beckham at Moldova in 1996? JD\n\n10am: Southampton's League One fixture at MK Dons this weekend has been postponed as a mark of respect to Saints' late owner, Markus Liebherr, who died yesterday aged 62. \"Having recently lost my own father I can understand just what a difficult time this is for all concerned,\" said Dons chairman Pete Winkelman.\n\nExeter City, meanwhile, will make a decision as to their weekend fixture at Dagenham & Redbridge later today in the wake of the death of Adam Stansfield. JD\n\n10.32am: We've just had a fire alarm here at Guardian Towers, which at least gives us an excuse for the lack of updates. While we were all shoving our colleagues out of the way in order to be first into the escape pod, two of today's live blogs have made their appearances. Talking Horses, with racing editor Tony Paley, and the County Cricket blog, with Andy Wilson, David Hopps and Mike Averis, are ready for your perusement. JA\n\n11.10am: Exeter have been given permission to postpone their League One match at Dagenham on Saturday after the death of Adam Stansfield. A statement from Exeter read:\n\n\"As you can no doubt imagine the impact on everyone associated with the football club has been intense and immense and Dagenham and Redbridge, along with the Football League, have kindly agreed to the postponement of the game. We are extremely grateful to Dagenham & Redbridge for their understanding.\"\n\nJD\n\n11.15am: Our West Brom season preview is now live, while Celtic have confirmed they are looking to sign Craig Bellamy on loan from Manchester City. JD\n\n11.30am: As mentioned below the line earlier this morning, the Football Weekly team are back today. Joining James Richardson in the pod today are Barry Glendenning, John Ashdown and Sean Ingle and you can download and listen to it from around 4pm this afternoon. JD\n\n11.50am: After his infamous 33-day spell at Manchester City, Steve Coppell has walked out on Bristol City - after two games. JD\n\n12.35pm: Don't worry Becks, West Ham still want you. Oh. Co-chairman David Gold has told the BBC:\n\n\"We still have an open invitation to David to join us. Our belief is that he is still a great player and it would be a fantastic statement if he came to West Ham. He's an east end boy and it would be a fitting end to his career ... I see the value in David Beckham after his playing career is over. If he wasn't an east London boy, I wouldn't have the same enthusiasm.\"\n\nJD\n\n12.45pm: Asafa Powell's planned meeting with Tyson Gay is off after ongoing back troubles forced the Jamaican out of tomorrow night's Diamond League meeting at Crystal Palace. In a statement, Powell said:\n\n\"I visited the doctor and he has advised me not to run in order to help the recovery of my injury. I had hoped it would be better but unfortunately this is not so.\"\n\nJD\n\n12.50pm: As for the Steve Coppell debacle at Bristol City, here are some of the shortest managerial stints in history, as detailed by the Knowledge. Can you better them? JD\n\n1.10pm: \"Milan Mandaric, chairman of Leicester City, has today announced that a new international consortium has acquired Leicester City and plans to work in partnership with him to secure 'our ambitious' and 'our exciting plans for the future',\" begins a statement on the Foxes' website. It goes on:\n\nThe consortium is led by Thai businessman, Aiyawatt Raksriaksorn of the King Power Group, the duty free empire based in Thailand, who last week secured a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with LCFC.\n\nJD\n\n2pm: Want to know more about new Manchester United signing Bébé? Then click on this link. JD\n\n2.55pm: A flurry of afternoon reading for you:\n\nPremier League preview No18: West Ham. Here's an extract:\n\nCompared to last season's incessant lurch between farce and fire-fight at Fratton Park, Avram Grant is right to expect a calmer year in charge of West Ham as he takes charge of his first competitive game on Saturday at Aston Villa.\n\nBut any serenity drawn from having escaped the madness of Portsmouth will not extend to the expectations of David Gold and David Sullivan, the co-owners, and fans after West Ham finished a place above the relegation zone in May.\n\nThis is how Grant wants it. All he desires is to be able to concentrate on football matters and be judged on them. The Israeli was frustrated and ended his tenure on the south coast exhausted by the constant demands of non-playing issues.\n\nEwan Murray picks over the bones of Scotland's 3-0 defeat in Sweden last night.\n\nAnd Richard Williams argues that only injury or an outbreak of extreme selectorial eccentricity can now stand between Joe Hart and a permanent role in England's qualifying campaign for Euro 2012. JD\n\n3.10pm: johnbarnesjnr writes below the line:\n\nHello, probably too late to get on the pod and they'll probably mention this topic anyway. But I'm quite a callous person whose unaffected and doesn't care about deaths of public figures. However I think the pod should mention something about Markus Liebherr. I'm a Liverpool fan but two of my mates were supporters of Southampton. Quite a lot of people have a soft spot for southampton because of Le Tissier really, the best England player that never was. I was sad to see them go down and get into the trouble they did, at which point my two friends were despairing. Then this quiet guy comes in, buys the club and develops a great fondness for them. It's a shame he's passed away because he was plotting a slow sustainable rise for the Saints. I understand he's set them up for the future despite his passing; it's a shame because he seemed like a nice fella who Saints supporters really held a lot of respect for, for all that he'd done at his brief time as owner.\n\nThe tragic deaths of both Adam Stansfield and Markus Lieberr are indeed discussed in the pod. JD\n\n3.55pm: Anyone waiting for updates from the first round of the US PGA at Whistling Straits will have to wait a little longer: fog has delayed play on day one. Have had an each-way look at Dustin Johnson at 50-1 to win this week: who do you think will win? JD\n\n5.15pm: Apologies for the scarce postings this afternoon, but we've been snowed under. Here's the first Football Weekly podcast of the new season by way of compensation. Cheers, James."
