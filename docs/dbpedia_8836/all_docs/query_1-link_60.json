        "text": "Crisis hit Cambridge United have their fans to thank for paying the wages this month.\n\nCambridge Fans United have loaned the club £20,000 to cover this months wage bill, with a statement reading: \"CFU would like to state again that the costs, lack of revenue and investment need to be addressed before the club can move forward. It would also like to thank all the supporters for helping to raise this money and for their recent messages of support.\"\n\nGraham Turner has previously noted that players were attracted to the Bulls in some cases simply because the club was paying it's wages on time.\n\nMichael Branch has been sent home from training and placed on the transfer list by Chester City.\n\nThe creative midfielder, 27, fell out with boss Mark Wright in March shortly after Wright's re-appointment at the Deva Stadium. Now, after being banished from the club after the incident, Branch arrived for the first day of pre-season training today was was immediately shown the door.\n\nBranch has 12 months left on his Chester contract and is likely to command a fee. The player is likely to interest Bulls boss Graham Turner who appears yet to have signed the creative midfielder that Bulls fans have been craving.\n\nMeanwhile, Chester have been fined £15,000 for their poor disciplinary record last season.\n\nGraham Turner told tonight's VP Club AGM that he was currently in talks with four more players over moves to Edgar Street.\n\nAs usual, Turner declined to name the players but indicated that they were currently plying their trade in the Premiership, Championship and two League Two sides. Turner suggested that the recent problems with older players and injuries meant that the players he was looking at were younger and \"more ambitious\".\n\nTurner also revealed that initial fears of a hefty reduction in the capacity of Edgar Street were likely to be calmed. Initial discussions with safety officials suggested the capacity of Edgar Street could be as low as 6,200 for the coming season but, after further discussion and safety work, the final figure is likely to be only 500 under the current capacity.\n\nThe meeting was told that the VP Club handed over nearly £32,000 to the football club in the year ending May 31st, and the Vice Presidents membership fee for next season was set at £450.\n\nYeovil are set to make a £40,000 move for Cardiff's former Bull Paul Parry if their third offer for Accrington's Gary Roberts is rebuffed.\n\nAccrington have slammed Roberts and Yeovil over the transfer saga that has seen two offers rejected and a third £50,000 offer still on the table but any further delay will mean boss Russell Slade will set his sights on former Bulls wide man Parry, who is the victim of budget cuts at Ninian Park.\n\nCardiff boss Dave Jones has signalled his intentions to have an 18 man first team squad complemented by young professionals from the Academy side. Parry has played 75 times for Cardiff, half of them as sub, and been capped six times for Wales since leaving the Bulls in early 2004. A dozen players have already been released or sold since the turn of the year as the Cardiff boss looks for Premiership quality rather than quantity.\n\nFrom left to right: Richard Rose, Glyn Thompson, Jon Wallis, Tim Sills and Gareth Sheldon\n\nPicture by Andy Compton\n\nThe Hereford Times has confirmed four signings this morning.\n\nJoining the rumoured recruits - Tim Sills, Richard Rose, and John Wallis - is ex-Shrewsbury goalkeeper Glyn Thompson.\n\nSills, 26, is a former Aldershot player who Oxford paid an undisclosed sum for in January, scoring just once in 13 League Two matches. He was claimed by manager Jim Smith to be the highest earner at the club. His record in Conference football is undoubted, having averaged a goal every other game for the Shots.\n\nRose, 23, is a utility player who can play across the defence and midfield who was released by Gillingham after 64 games over six years, mostly in the Championship. He also had a spell on loan to Bristol Rovers in 2002.\n\nWallis, 20, was also released by Gillingham in the summer after a single first team season in which he played 20 times for the Gills. A midfielder by trade, he was a surprise release but struggled to get a first team chance once manager Neale Cooper left the club in November.\n\nThompson, 25, has had five different clubs and three spells at Shrewsbury. He was a Shrews trainee before Fulham gambled £50,000 on the untested youngster six years ago. A string of loan moves and free transfers took in the likes of Northampton and Mansfield before returning to Shrewsbury last summer, making just one appearance.\n\nBulls coach John Trewick has been speaking to the Hereford Journal about new signing Gareth Sheldon.\n\nSheldon, 26, signed a one year deal a week ago and Trewick was optimistic about the signing: \"Gareth is a player who can operate in one or two different positions. He was doing pretty well with Scunthorpe a couple of years ago. He moved on and spent a short period at Kidderminster and he has just been allowed to drift a little bit.\n\n\"I think, potentially, there is more to come from Gareth. He knows he has got to get himself back to the level that he was and we feel we can get him back to that level.\"\n\nTrewick also spoke about the coming season: \"This is what it is all about. At the start of last season we were looking for the really tough games, now they are all tough. The teams we will be playing this season will be better than last season, but we will be improved as well.\"\n\nTomorrow sees the players report for pre-season training for the first time.\n\nThe day is also the much anticipated \"Press Day\" where several new signings are likely to be announced, while Graham Turner will round off the day at the Vice Presidents Club AGM to be held that evening.\n\nWith several names having been brought up on the forums over the last few weeks, fans should find out whether the likes of Tim Sills, Richard Rose, and Jon Wallis have indeed signed for the Bulls. Up to ten new faces are likely to be joining the Bulls but, on recent history, only a few are likely to be confirmed tomorrow.\n\nWith pre-season training kicking off tomorrow, it will be one of the shortest pre-seasons for some time with just over five weeks to go before the first League Two fixture. The friendly list is also looking a little thin, with just one away friendly confirmed at Forest Green and the usual trips to the likes of Aberwrystwyth and Ludlow conspicuous by their absence.\n\nAccrington have received a new bid from Yeovil for winger Gary Roberts.\n\nYeovil tabled the bid, believed to be £50,000, yesterday after seeing a £20,000 offer rejected as \"derisory\". Manager Russell Slade told the Western Daily Press: \"We've made a final offer but we've not been given permission to talk to the player yet. We can only go so far and we think we've made a fair, sensible bid. Hopefully Accrington will regard it as a fair offer. If they don't then we'll move on to other targets.\"\n\nBut Accrington chairman Eric Whalley was critical of both Yeovil and Roberts, telling the BBC: \"He is under contract, so Yeovil are out of order. This is down to money. Gary has decided he wants to move because of the offer Yeovil have made him. They are working through an agent.\n\n\"But I would prefer to make him sit on his backside for a year, because he has 12 months left on his contract.\"\n\nCraig Stanley has spoken to the Morecambe press about his move to the Shrimpers:\n\n\"As a player I want to get hold of the ball and play good attractive football that is good on the eye. Every time I have played against Morecambe they have been tough games. I want to get my place in the team, work hard and play some attractive football\n\n\"The Conference is a tough league, when I was at Hereford it took two years to get out of it. But here, we have a good squad, and we will definitely be pushing for promotion, either automatic or through the play-offs. Automatic is the main aim and I think we have got a very good chance of doing that.\n\nSpeaking on playing against Morecambe for the Bulls, Stanley added: \"They have always been tough games. In the semi-final there wasn't much difference between the two sides. They have always been tough games and the way they play football has always impressed me.\"\n\nStanley will officially sign later in the week after passing a medical today.\n\nKidderminster have signed former Wolves and Derby striker Dean Sturridge on a one year deal. The 32 year old has averaged a goal every three games in his career, but has failed to net a senior goal since leaving Wolves 15 months ago.\n\nChester are chasing Shrewsbury midfielder Jamie Tolley after delays in their move to sign Exeter's Glen Cronin. Chester are looking to Tolley as a direct replacement to Ben Davies, who made a switch to the Slop earlier in the summer. Grimsby have signed striker Isiah Rankin from Brentford on a two year deal, their first signing of the summer. Wrexham are set to lose another striker following Jon Walters decision to quit the Racecourse for Chester. Lee McEvilly is due to sign on a free transfer for Bradford in the next couple of days.\n\nFarnboro are in trouble again, as they announce moves to return to Administration after finding out they defaulted on their CVA arrangements SEVEN years ago. The club have a transfer embargo placed on them, and have lost their manager and two players so far to Grays. They are believed to owe as much as £500,000 and the move to Administration has staved off a winding up order from the Inland Revenue.\n\nCrawley's players have been offered three weeks wages to leave the club. Most of the players are owed two months wages and have contracts for next season, as well as being owed bonus money for most of last season. Crawley's wage bill is estimated at £25,000 per week.\n\nCanvey's former Chairman has claimed he was offered \"several thousand pounds\" to throw a Conference match at the end of last season by their opponents. Keith Johnson has refused to name the opponents who made the offer, but noted that Canvey did not lose the game. Cambridge have signed former York and Gillingham keeper Paul Crichton as player-coach. The veteran stopper left Gillingham halfway through a two year deal after playing just once for their first team. Cheltenham boss John Ward has confirmed that Steve Guinan will sign a new deal this week. The one year deal is believed to have a second year clause triggered on appearances in the coming season.\n\nThe Official Hereford United Website has confirmed that Tamika Mkandawire has signed a new one-year deal at Edgar Street with the League Two outfit.\n\nMkandawire is fully expected to take over from Tony James as club captain, despite having filled in as skipper for the most part of last season when James, recentely departed to Weymouth, was out of the team.\n\nMkandawire is the final player from last seasons team to sign up for The Bulls again. From now on, it will be all new faces at Edgar Street.\n\nHe has played over 100 games for the Bulls since originally arriving on loan from West Brom in October 2003, and is the third longest serving player behind Rob Purdie and Simon Travis.The next week is expected to be a busy one for signings, with up to ten new faces expected to be signed before the start of the new season in less than six weeks and pre-season training starting on Thursday.\n\nBoston chairman Jon Sotnick has quit the club to take a Chief Executive role at rivals Darlington.\n\nSotnick, who had been chairman since the illegal payments scandal forced former chairman Pat Malkinson to stand down two years ago, leaves after failing to secure a satisfactory pay package for his role, telling the official Boston site: \"It is with great sadness that I today convey this news, as I would have really liked to have completed the job I started, but the facts are that Boston United are unable to remunerate me, and having dedicated the last two-and-a-half years to this club, I know I have to think of my own family and take steps to ensure that they are looked after. By that, I mean to provide a home and continue to provide a healthy environment for my children to grow up.\"\n\nSotnick, who will take up his new post shortly, has been replaced by former player Jim Rodwell who steps up from his Director of Football role.\n\nCambridge United are to call and Extraordinary General Meeting to seek new investment after their Chairman quit after just four months.\n\nCambridge face a cash crisis after a concert - Abbey Aid - lost £135,000 instead of the expected £50,000 profit to add to their annual estimated £400,000 loss. The club, which announced a £581,000 loss in their last accounts in January, needed £250,000 to complete the pre-season and had originally estimated a £250,000 loss for the current year. With the shortfall from the Abbey Aid concert, as much as £300,000 may be needed to cover current operating losses in the short term.\n\nChairman Terry Baker quit this week saying: \"Those primarily responsible for the fiasco wouldn't walk the plank, and I thought it was easier for me to take the responsibility.\"\n\nHe will be followed by Finance Director Nick Pomery, a man declared a saviour after pulling the club from the brink 12 months ago, who appears to be the main person responsible for the concert, telling the Cambridge Evening News: \"What the club needs is a new board where everyone is heading in the same direction, so the club can really move forward. Any direction is better than no direction, which is what the club has had in recent times.\"\n\nCraig Stanley is set to sign for Morecambe, according to reports coming from a sponsors evening held in Morecambe last night.\n\nSubject to a medical, Stanley will make the switch on Monday to the beaten play-off semi finalists. Stanley told the Hereford Times he was not staying, but Graham Turner was unsure as to his status on Friday when interviewed on BBC H&W.\n\nOnly Tamika Mkandawire is now the last man from last season's squad to decide on his future. With Stanley's departure, five of last season's squad have chosen to leave Edgar Street - four of them to remain in the Conference.\n\nMeanwhile, Danny Carey-Bertram is likely to have a different strike partner at Cambridge with giant forward Fola Onibuje set to sign for Swindon on a three month deal. The 6ft 6in Nigerian born target man had an indifferent season at Cambridge, scoring just nine times all season.\n\nEx-Bull Danny Davidson is also on the move, having signed for Moor Green after his release from Tamworth. He joins up with former Burton striker Dale Anderson, who left Burton after deciding against a full-time move.\n\nStockport County manager Jim Gannon is happy with the fixture list which sees The Bulls travel to Edgeley Park for the opening game of the season on August 5th.\n\n\"Obviously the fact that we're at home on the opening day gives us a great chance to start off with a victory, That's what we're looking forward to.\" said Gannon speaking to the Official Stockport County website, www.stockportcounty.com\n\n\"Hereford have done well, they've got themselves out of the Conference. And they're not to be underestimated because the Conference is a tough league to get out of.\"\n\n\"They've done especially well getting through the difficult play-offs and it will be a tough game.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they will have an extra spring in their step coming to Edgeley Park. But hopefully our players will as well.\"\n\nThe future of The Non-League Paper, and it's sister The League Paper, are in doubt after the company was placed in Administration for the second time.\n\nA large hole has been found in the company accounts, and the Finance Director and Account Manager have both left the company. The hole may be the subject of a Police investigation.\n\nEditor David Emery said: \"We were in the process of doing a management buyout involving myself when we discovered these problems. We are trying to discover where the money has gone and how. This is a problem for lots of small companies who rely on financial experts to handle their accounts. Personally it is a horror that people who you trust in a small company can betray you so badly that it puts the business in jeopardy.\"\n\nEmery expects The Non-League Paper to continue but placed doubt on The League Paper's continuance, adding that the fledgling paper would be at the mercy of new owners just six months after it's debut. Current major backer Chris Ingram, Chairman of Woking, has financed the company in the interim until a buyer can be found.\n\nWork actually begins on a fixture list two years in advance. The Football League's fixtures department is already working on season 2008/09.\n\nSandra Whiteside, Head of Fixtures, Events and Competitions, and David Cookson, Fixtures Secretary, have the arduous task of trying to accommodate the requests of FIFA, UEFA, the FA, the clubs, the police and the fans into a 46-week fixture calendar.\n\nWith more than 50 years experience at The Football League between them Sandra and David have built up a wealth of knowledge that allows them to know instinctively what will work and what won't.\n\nSandra said: \"There are lots of misconceptions that surround our job. It has got increasingly difficult over the years and there is far more fixture congestion now. But the job is still interesting.\n\n\"It has become a real balancing act and we do try our best to come up with the fixtures that are balanced. At the end of the day we want a published set of fixtures that the clubs can complete.\"\n\nThe fixture preparation begins when FIFA announces its list of international dates. UEFA and other federations around the world then schedule their own international fixtures based on FIFA's list.\n\nAnother complication to the preparation of the fixture list is club\n\nrequests.\n\nDetails are collated via a questionnaire which is sent to clubs each March/April. This allows clubs to work with their local police force to identify certain dates when they would have difficulty hosting a game - ie when major events are on in the area such as Gay Pride in Brighton, major religious celebrations such as Eid, or the Northampton Balloon Festival.\n\nIn addition clubs and their police forces will identify opponents they cannot host over Bank Holiday periods.\n\nThe experience of the staff involved irons out most of the potential problems before working parties meet in June to formulate the final list.\n\nBut any movement of fixtures at the drafting stage can cause serious problems.\n\nSandra explained: \"It is another misconception that you can simply move a fixture. Any game that is moved involves at least two teams on four playing dates and more often than not you could be looking at reviewing the fixtures for 12 clubs on four dates. This is because teams are grouped with their pairings and any movement will affect pairings up and down the country and may put several sets of fans in one area at the same time.\n\nDavid added: \"It is never simply a case of clubs playing home and away on alternate Saturdays throughout the season.\n\n\"There are certain rules, like clubs can't have three successive home Saturday matches or three consecutive away matches. It is a misconception that all clubs can have a perfect home and away sequence.\n\n\"One thing we have always tried to do is minimise travel around holiday periods, but supporters need to recognise that some clubs prefer to make long journeys in midweek - it cuts down on their overheads because they don't need to pay for overnight accommodation. The club will travel on the day of the game and head straight home after the match. These requests mean we now have very limited options when we try to minimise travel with supporters in mind. Fans do need to know that we do try and help them as much as we can, but at the end of the day The Football League has to get the fixtures played.\"\n\nThe sequences are worked out by hand and on computers at the offices of Atos Origin in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Their draft list is then put before representatives of the clubs, the police and supporters groups, who review and alter the list where necessary.\n\nOnce the initial list is finalised and released, clubs have a 10-day period in which they can request matches to be moved to - usually by a day ie Wednesday to Tuesday or Saturday to Friday.\n\nThe job of fixture preparation has become more and more complicated over the years, and with ever increasing demands of European competition and international fixtures it is not set to become any easier in future years.\n\n\"It makes life harder and it makes it harder to sequence,\" Sandra said. \"The more things in the equation the harder it becomes to get an acceptable fixture list.\"\n\nNotts County manager Steve Thompson has told their official website that Steve Guinan will remain a Cheltenham player.\n\nThompson publically named Guinan last week as a target, and the Bulls were also believed to be interested in their former striker, but the manager has admitted defeat in his efforts to take Guinan to Meadow Lane:\n\n\"Before I had my job interview for this job, I had to be armed with players I was going to bring in straight away. And to be fair, we've landed all the ones I have wanted, except Guinan who has told us now he will more than likely be staying at Cheltenham.\n\n\"I had targeted him and spoken to him. He was tempted to join us, but one factor was his partner is expected a baby any time soon so he was keen to stay in the area he was in, plus the challenge of playing in a Division higher was too much to resist.\n\n\"He told me had I taken the job two weeks earlier it was more than likely he would have joined us, but he is one to monitor during the season. We wish him well.\"\n\nGraham Turner returned to Edgar Street yesterday after a short break and is understood to be spending most of his time talking to potential new signings. But the one deal every Hereford United supporter hopes has been completed is that with Tamika Mkandawire.\n\nThe pointers suggest that Mkandawire and Turner have done a deal. Hopefully it will be announced later today.\n\nMeanwhile Turner is understood to be meeting Jon Wallis who was recently released by Gillingham today.\n\nFinally there is speculation that a deal with a striker is close. Several names have been banded about but with many current contracts not ending until the end of the month supporters may have to wait at least another week or so for news on new players joining Hereford United.\n\nIn any case Turner is unlikely to rush into signing of players without ensuring their fitness. He will not want to give a contract to someone like Stacy Coldicott who hardly played a game for the Bulls all last season.\n\nSky have named the Leyton Orient - West Brom Carling Cup clash as their live game.\n\nThe match will be shown on Thursday 24th August.\n\nMeanwhile, Chester's £100,000 move for former winger Kevin Ellison has collapsed with the player joining Tranmere for an undisclosed fee. Swindon have signed ex-Rotherham winger Andy Monkhouse on a free transfer. Notts County have signed striker Tcham N'Toya from Chesterfield on a permanent deal, leaving just one striker spot free for the side chasing Steve Guinan, and taken defender Austin McCann from Boston. Macclesfield have signed striker Marvin Robinson from Lincoln on a free transfer. Swansea are still waiting on an answer from Wycombe for defender Roger Johnson, with the manager's job still vacant and the player on holiday.\n\nEx-Bull Jay Lovett, who spent two months at Edgar Street on loan towards the end of the 2002/03 season, has joined Eastbourne from Lewes.\n\nCraig Stanley has left Edgar Street after failing to agree terms on a new deal, according to the Hereford Times.\n\nStanley, 23, played 94 times for the club in two seasons, missing just eight games in his time at the club after signing from Telford. He was named by Alex Inglethorpe as a target for the former Exeter manager before his St James Park departure, and may still follow Adam Stansfield to Devon.\n\nHowever, young prospect Sam Gwynne has signed a new deal and brings the number of players currently contracted to nine. Stanley's departure means the Bulls are likely to bring in up to a dozen new faces for their return to the League.\n\nOnly Tamika Mkandawire's future remains unresolved with the main stumbling block believed to be over the length of the contract. Tam is believed to be looking for a 12 month deal, which will mean he could leave on a Bosman free next summer, with the club offering a two year contract.\n\nThe Hereford Times also reports that Season Ticket sales are strong with £10-15,000 worth of sales each day since the opening day rush, suggesting that around £100,000 has been banked from sales.\n\nHalifax Town are beleived to be interested in signing Leo Fortune-West.\n\nThe 6ft 4in striker was released by Doncaster at the end of last season. His appearances for the club were curtailed by injuries.\n\nRushden and Diamonds are also thought to have made enquires about the player. It is reported that their manager Paul Hart met West recently. Hart is set to sign a striker on Friday according to the R&D website.\n\nNow 35, Fortune-West has said he might become a referee or possibly combine playing for another season whilst he trained as a referee.\n\nMeanwhile Halifax manager Chris Wilder has cited Hereford United as an example to follow to get the Shaymen out of the Conference.\n\n\"Hereford is the model we are looking to run on,\" Wilder told Halifax Today.\n\n\"When they were relegated they had financial problems and gradually improved those over the years.\n\n\"Off the pitch they came out of a cva and then went on to look at the playing side to get into a position where they could compete to get out of the league.\n\n\"If we can keep on improving the club we might enjoy a bit more success.\"\n\nHereford United are understood be close close to signing a new striker. Should the addition to Graham Turner's squad be made, it will be the first \"new\" player to sign on for the League campaign. Wayne Brown, recently made a permanent squad memeber, was the first signing after a year long loan deal at Edgar Street after he transfered from Chester City.\n\nThe forward is said to be in the \"Guy Ipoua mould\" and so a big powerful player is expected. Hopefully the player will be more lucky with injuries than Ipoua was and will put in more games throughout the course of the season. A player in that build gives an alternative option in attack which, with Stuart Fleetwood and Andy Williams already contracted to the club, may well compliment the two youngsters style of play.\n\nThe signing has, though, not been confirmed as Turner is away until tomorrow. It is thought though that the player will put pen to paper soon after Turner's return. Rumours have previously suggested that Leo Fortune-West had been a target for Hereford, but again it is not know whether he is the unnamed striker in question.\n\nFormer Bulls striker Adam Stansfield expects to be a Football League player in 12 months time.\n\nSpeaking to the Exeter Express and Echo, Stansfield expects his new side to become his third Conference promotion side: \"I have been promoted with the last two clubs I have been with and there is no reason why Exeter can't be the third. I do feel I am only dropping back into the Conference for one year as I am confident we can get promoted next season.\"\n\nStansfield also expects 20 goals a season from himself, a target he failed to hit at Edgar Street: \"At the start of every season I set myself a target of at least 20 goals. If I can stay injury-free then I am sure I can achieve that.\"\n\nStansfield then went on to speak about the Bulls: \"Leaving Hereford was hard, it is a lovely place and the people there have been really good to me and my family. But they wouldn't offer me more than a year and I needed to look after my family and the offer from Exeter was a good one. And coming back to Devon will be good for the kids. It will be nice for them to see their grandparents more often.\"\n\nBut Stansfield refuted reports that he had 'done the dirty' on the Bulls: \"What has come out has actually made me look quite bad, but I rang Hereford a week ago last Friday to let them know I was rejecting their contract offer.\"\n\nThe Carling Cup first round draw is at noon tomorrow.\n\nThe Bulls have been placed in the South draw, along with the likes of Birmingham, West Brom, and Cardiff. The draw includes all 72 Football League sides with the 12 Premiership sides not playing European football joining in the second round, and the remaining eight sides joining in the third round.\n\nSince the Bulls last played in the League Cup the format has changed slightly with the first round draw pitting Seeded clubs, the higher placed teams in the League structure last season, against Unseeded clubs. The draw format guarantees a tie against at least a League One side. The first round is now a single tie rather than a two-legged affair and will be played in the week beginning 21 August, with ties decided on the night with extra-time and penalties if necessary.\n\nSouth Seeded Teams:\n\n1 Birmingham City\n\n2 West Bromwich Albion\n\n3 Crystal Palace\n\n4 Coventry City\n\n5 Norwich City\n\n6 Luton Town\n\n7 Cardiff City\n\n8 Southampton\n\n9 Plymouth Argyle\n\n10 Ipswich Town\n\n11 Queens Park Rangers\n\n12 Southend United\n\n13 Colchester United\n\n14 Millwall\n\n15 Brighton & Hove Albion\n\n16 Brentford\n\n17 Swansea City\n\n18 Bristol City\n\nSouth Unseeded Teams:\n\n19 Gillingham\n\n20 Yeovil Town\n\n21 AFC Bournemouth\n\n22 Northampton Town\n\n23 Leyton Orient\n\n24 Cheltenham Town\n\n25 Milton Keynes Dons\n\n26 Swindon Town\n\n27 Walsall\n\n28 Wycombe Wanderers\n\n29 Peterborough United\n\n30 Shrewsbury Town\n\n31 Boston United\n\n32 Bristol Rovers\n\n33 Barnet\n\n34 Torquay United\n\n35 Notts County\n\n36 Hereford United\n\nThe Non League Paper has published the winners of its awards for performances in the Conference.\n\nHereford United's now ex-player Ryan Green won the Goal of the Season award for his winner in the Play-off game against Halifax.\n\nTamika Mkandawire came close to winning the Player of the Season title but that award went to Ian Craney of Accrington Stanley.\n\n\"There were a lot of votes for Tamika. In fact he was very close to winning the player of the year outright. He was just edged out by Ian Craney,\" said the NLP editor talking to BBC Hereford and Worcester.\n\n\"But Tamika ran him very, very close and there was some very nice things said about him.\n\n\"We all think he is an absolute star.\"\n\nConsolation for Mkandawire however as he won the Young Player award.\n\nTwo of the players Graham Turner is beleived to be talking to are Jon Wallis and Richard Rose. Both were released by Gillingham last month.\n\nBoth players will know Dean Beckwith and Bulls physio Wayne Jones. Wallis is expected to meet Turner on Friday to talk terms according to the Kent press.\n\n\"When I was told about being released it was a bit depressing,\" said Wallis.\n\n\"I'd never had a setback in my career before but I'm looking to improve now.\n\n\"I made a few mistakes but I've learned from them but those might have cost me.\n\n\"I wasn't playing in my best position and the manager knew that but he didn't fancy me in midfield.\n\n\"I've got a chance now where I can play in midfield and hopefully get more experience.\"\n\n\"I'm 20 now and I want to be playing, I don't want to be playing reserve football for a League 1 side.\"\n\nWallis also said a move to League newcomers Hereford and the chance of some regular football alongside familiar faces is an option to him.\n\nWallis is a 20 year old midfielder according to soccerbase.com. He started his career with Gillingham in 2003 and played 20 games for the Gills last season.\n\nRose is described by soccerbase.com as a 23 year old 5ft 11in defender who started with Gillingham in August 2000. He had a loan spell at Bristol Rovers in early 2003. Last season he started 17 times for the Gills.\n\nNotts County manager Steve Thompson has confirmed that he is interested in signing ex-Bull Steve Guinan.\n\nThompson, who signed two strikers last week to add to the one still at Meadow Lane, is still looking for two more forwards and admits Guinan is a target, telling the official Notts County site: \"Guinan is one I am pursuing. Obviously we are looking at a number of players, but he is one we are pursuing.\"\n\n\"Hopefully we will have a week as busy as last week with some positive results. We will have to wait and see though. Like I said we might not get all the players we want, but if we can get some of them then I will be happy.\"\n\nMK Dons are struggling to assemble a pre-season schedule after four different sides cancelled friendlies with the side after pressure from fans.\n\nQPR are the latest side to withdraw from a proposed friendly, with QPR chairman Gianni Paladini saying: \"After several phonecalls and threats from our own supporters, I have decided not to go ahead with the game.\"\n\nQPR join Colchester, Ipswich, and non-league Histon in cancelling games with Histon chairman Gareth Baldwin adding: \"Sometimes ethics and principles have to come before making money.\", and a statement from Colchester reading: \"It would be an unwise PR move for Colchester United to proceed with our fixture.\"\n\nCurrently only one League side, Notts Forest, is scheduled to meet MK Dons in a friendly match.\n\nGraham Turner has spoken of his belief that Hereford United must continue to budget carefully for life in Division Two.\n\n\"There are certain things we have to come to terms with. Where squad budgeting was 65 percent [of turnover] in the Conference, it's 60 percent in the second division of the Football League and that's mandatory,\" Turner told BBC Hereford and Worcester.\n\n\"They do give clubs warnings that there may be sanctions against clubs who are getting close to going over their budget with transfer embargos and all those sorts of things.\n\n\"I don't think deducting points is in the rules at the moment as it was in the Conference.\n\n\"But it is something we have to be mindful of when preparing all the figures.\n\n\"Something we have been very careful of over the past few years - spending money we haven't got is no way forward - and that will continue in the Football League.\n\n\"The aim of the club is now to increase our turnover by a third.\n\n\"We've been just over the £1 million pound mark. We're hoping to take it up to around £1.5 million in our first season in the Football League.\"\n\nThis is an edited version of an article about players contracts which has appeared on several sites. It is assumed that it covers the situation at Hereford United but the dates will be May 23rd and June 23rd.\n\nThe players who were out of contract and offered new terms at the end of last season have one month from May 20th to make a decision whether or not to accept the terms offered to them.\n\nMay 20th is the re-engagement date that applies across the country and the contracts must remain on the table for a period of one month from that date as per Football League re-engagement regulations (the date of May 20th is amended to three days after the last game for those clubs involved in the play-offs). (This explains why the dates are May 23 and June 23 for Hereford United - ed)\n\nDuring this month, clubs can increase the contract offer, but they cannot decrease or withdraw any offers made but once June 20th arrives that restriction is lifted and clubs can increase or decrease any contract offer, or completely withdraw a contract offer.\n\nSo, although players have until June 20th to accept, decline, negotiate the offers currently on the table or even sign for someone else as a free agent (*Compensation would be required for any player under the age of 24 who has been offered a new contract), there is nothing to stop the decision period going beyond June 20th if that is the will of both club and player.\n\nWhat is removed after June 20th is the protection offered to the player that the club cannot decrease or withdraw any offers made.\n\nFrom the above it seems that the three Hereford United players who haven't yet agreed new contracts are likely to sign, or not as the case might be, by next Friday.\n\nFormer Hereford United defender Ryan Green is being tipped for a possible return to the Welsh squad.\n\nGreen's new manager at Bristol Rovers, Paul Trollope, has spoken on their website about Green.\n\n\"He hit the scene with Wales quite early, and I think sometimes that doesn't work out in your favour\n\n\"He fell by the wayside a bit, but he's got his career back on track, and we need players with ambition and desire to further their careers at the club.\n\n\"He has had the taste of playing at a higher level, both for club and country, and we want him to come in the building and show that that so that hopefully we can move up together.\"\n\nTrollope was in the Wales side when Ryan Green made his debut aged 17.\n\n\"He should have ambitions to play for Wales again, because he's certainly got the ability. At the moment, John Toshack is giving younger players a chance, and that is what Ryan has to look at.\n\n\"He is a player of tremendous potential and if he realises that with Rovers over the coming season, then I see no reason why his name won't be in the frame for Wales once again.\"\n\nFollowing on from the revelation that Accrington are likely to have to play their games on the same Saturday as near-neighbours Burnley, chairman Eric Whalley has said that the Milkmen will probably play more home games on a Friday night.\n\nLast season, they switched their game against the Bulls to a Friday evening and the gate was higher than usual.\n\nThe first occasion was against Hereford United on October 7 last year, with the crowd increasing by almost 400 on the previous weekend's home game against Gravesend and Northfleet reported This is Lancashire.\n\nNo mention was made of the fact that the Bulls took much more support to the Interlink Stadium than Gravesend and in any case the Bulls should have been more of an attraction than Gravesend to home fans.\n\nGiven the thoughts of chairman Whalley, it's quite possible that when the Bulls travel to play the Milkman this season the game will be on a Friday evening. It is hoped that Hereford supporters can find somewhere to park near the ground.\n\nTwo Conference clubs, Crawley and Scarboro, are on the brink of liquidation after it was revealed both had not paid wages for several weeks.\n\nThe representative of Crawley's players, David Woozley, admitted that every player was seeking employment elsewhere after failing to be paid for six weeks. Woozley told the Crawley Observer: \"What he told me was the club doesn't own any assets - there's nothing to sell to give the creditors any money. He (Chas Majeed) said he can stop it going into liquidation by finding some money from other parts of his business, but only if the administrator is able to get the creditors to take a much smaller offer.\n\n\"Chas said he foresees it going into liquidation unless the creditors accept what I would imagine amounts to next to nothing. For the players it's a real kick in the teeth. To get any money at all you have to terminate your contract for next year. But if the club goes into liquidation there will be no contracts next year anyway. Every single player at Crawley Town is actively seeking other clubs at the moment.\"\n\nScarboro boss Neil Redfearn claims his players haven't been paid for two months: \"Things are getting ridiculous now. None of the players who were released have been paid, while all of the staff are owed two months and my assistant manager Eric Winstanley is owed three months. I have been advised by the League Manager's Association and the PFA not to bring any more players in until this is sorted out.\n\n\"You just can't work in this sort of situation because the word has got out now. Any player you talk to asks you straight away if the wages are being paid at the club. A player turned us down last week to sign for Blyth Spartans, which is just embarrasing for the club.\n\n\"Players can't go for two or three months without being paid - some of them have mortgages and young families. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I've discovered that I can sue the club for 12 months pay because it is a breach of my contract, but I don't want it to come to that. I want happy players and things to be on a level playing field - when people are not being paid that is not going to happen. We desperately need to sign players because we start pre-season in three weeks, but that isn't going to happen as things stand.\"\n\nIt was announced late last night that Adam Stansfield has joined Exeter.\n\nThe Official Exeter City Website confirmed the move of the Hereford United striker from Edgar Street.\n\nExeter City FC is pleased to confirm the signing of Adam Stansfield on a 2 year deal.\n\nAdam joins us from Hereford where he scored 22 goals in the 2004/05 season and helped fire them to a play-off spot in the last two seasons.\n\n27 year old Adam, has previously been on the books at Elmore and Yeovil before joining Hereford.\n\nA local Tiverton lad, he has decided that his future resides playing for Devon's premier club, and it speaks volumes that he still wanted to come to Exeter even though he knew we had no manager.\n\nWelcome Adam and we hope you can help us to promotion this season.\n\nMore trouble for Accrington Stanley as local residents want a ban on parking by supporters going to watch games at the Interlink, now renamed the Fraser Eagle, stadium.\n\nAt the first meeting of the Accrington Stanley Residents' Liaison Group, set up to improve relations between the club and residents, people complained fans arriving by car were causing parking problems and congestion.\n\nAccording to the Lancashire Evening Telegraph, Local Borough traffic manager, David Law, said club officials have agreed to ask the owner of a former brickworks site, in Whinney Hill Road, if it can be used as a car park.\n\nThey are also understood to be exploring other potential car park sites.\n\nParking at the Fraser Eagle Stadium is said to be insufficient to meet demand on match days and after the club's promotion to League Two, the number of fans going to games is likely to increase.\n\nTamika Mkandawire has confirmed that he is close to agreeing a new deal.\n\nSpeaking to the Non-League Paper, Tam said: \"I just need to iron out a few things, but it will definitely be with Hereford. I hope to be signing in the next couple of days. (The Captaincy) is part of the deal. The gaffer has said he'd like me to stay as captain, which I was very pleased about and that is obviously a factor in me signing the contract.\"\n\nEx-Landlord reveals how Wayne Brown got his Superman tag.\n\nTwo things happened at Leicester in May. Firstly, the Bulls won promotion and secondly, 'keeper Wayne Brown was the subject of a T Shirt campaign that was to confirm him as the season's Superman hero.\n\nThe chant 'Wayne Brown is Superman' had been heard on the Meadowend from early March but few people are aware of it's origin. Many will recall the cancelled game at Morecambe on Saturday 4th March when the Bulls' faithful had made the long trip north only to be told of the 'unfit' pitch not much more than two hours before kick-off time.\n\nThe Fun Bus Crew were unsurprisingly amongst the hundreds who made the trip and had reached the Morecambe junction on the M6 when the news of the postponement reached them. The first thought was to hit the Bars of Blackpool but yours truly took a dim view of staying sober through having to drive fifteen staggering fans back to the Shire hours later. The alternative was to find a game to watch. York and Halifax had also been called off and Blackburn were playing away, so a swift phone call to Burnley's Turf Moor HQ was made.\n\n\"We are Hereford United supporters who have travelled to a game in Morecambe that has been called off. Can we come and watch your lot play Reading?\"\n\n\"How many are you?\"\n\n\"Sixteen\"\n\n\"£18 a head\"\n\n\"Yes that will be fine!\"\n\nSplendid, Burnley it was versus top of the table Reading.\n\nThe much traveled mini-bus was parked a short walk from the ground in good time for the away end Bar at Turf Moor to be tested and for us to receive a warm welcome from the visiting Reading fans who were a little bemused by having a band of extremely noisy Bulls fans in their midst. Reading easily won the game 3-0 despite having Leroy Lita carried off and the fans were very vocal. They have a strong, tall central defender called Ibraham Sonjo who has become a bit of fans favourite and his song is 'Sonjo is Superman'. It didn't take long for our lot to join in with the Reading singing, including a fine rendition of Danny Lee's 'We all love you'.\n\nOn the way home there was a discussion about the 'Superman' song and it was soon decided that Browner was to be the one who should be stuck with it. So, Mr Brown, if you don't like it blame the ref who called off the Morecambe game!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSuperman T-shirts will be available from the club in about a weeks time priced at just £10.99. The Shirts are extremely good quality and will be available in medium, large and extra large from the club shop. Other sizes can be printed but must be paid for in advance and will be available for collection 7/10 days from date of order.\n\nGraham Turner thinks he is close to agreeing a deal with Tamika Mkandawire.\n\nThe Hereford United manager told BBC Hereford and Worcester earlier today that \"things are moving in the right direction for us\" with Mkandawire.\n\nIt seems that Turner has offered a two-year deal to the club captain but Mkandawire wants only a year long contract.\n\nTurner also said that Chester had \"agreed to release\" Wayne Brown from his contract.\n\n\"I think he is an important player for us,\" commented Turner.\n\nAs regards Craig Mawson leaving, Turner said the club was sorry to lose him.\n\n\"I think he had a brilliant attitude, kept Wayne Brown on his toes, made sure there was competition for his place.\n\n\"So we need another keeper and I'm talking to one or two at the present time.\"\n\nTurner also spoke about Adam Stansfield.\n\n\"I spoke to him a week or so ago. He asked for a second year but the offer was for one year.\n\n\"He then asked if he played a certain number of games could a contract for a second year kick-in which I agreed.\n\n\"I thought he was away on holiday but I now read he's going to sign for Exeter.\n\n\"You lose one or two players. I won't lose any sleep over Adam going to Exeter. We wish him well. He did a decent job for us here.\"\n\nTurner then revealed that there had been a problem with Stansfield two or three months before the end of the season.\n\n\"We got word that Adam had already spoken to Exeter, then denied it, but we were not too happy about that situation. So Adam Stansfield and Exeter - it's been a link for quite some time.\"\n\nTurner mentioned the move of Ryan Green to Bristol Rovers.\n\n\"I would have liked to have kept Ryan Green but he's disappeared from the scene. If he wants to go somewhere else, fair enough. We'll get a player that wants to come in and play for us.\"\n\nTurner said that most of his time at present is taken up by talking to players from other clubs.\n\n\"I saw two yesterday. I'm hopeful that they will both say yes but you can never tell in football.\"\n\nFinally Turner said that people were still talking about that final.\n\n\"Even at the League Chairman's conference, there were a lot of people who watched the game on television who thought it was a great game.\n\n\"I read the Leicester paper who felt it was the best game seen at the Walkers Stadium all season.\n\n\"We have to move on but there is a momentum about the place and we need to keep it going to order to keep the supporters coming back.\"\n\nRochdale have announced a small trading loss for the financial year to May 31st 2005.\n\nThe £27,008 loss on a turnover of £1.7million featured £1.4million spent on players wages with the club narrowly missing the League Two play-offs. By comparison, for the same financial year, the Bulls spent just £0.6million on players with a £1.1million turnover, finishing second in the Conference.\n\nSquad budgeting rules for the coming season are tighter than the Conference, with only 60% of turnover allowable to be spent on wages rather than 65%. Rochdale spent 82% of their turnover on wages in this comparison, the Bulls spent just 56%.\n\nAccording to the Official Cambridge United website former Hereford striker Danny Carey-Bertram has signed for Cambridge United on a free transfer.\n\nThe 21-year-old joined Hereford from West Brom in August 2003 and scored nine goals in the Conference last season for the Bulls, who won promotion to the Football League last month via the play-offs.\n\nIn his three seasons at Edgar Street, Carey-Bertram scored 17 times in 32 starts and 38 substitute appearances, but he decided to leave in search of more first team football.\n\nA number of Conference clubs were interested in signing the pacy striker but he opted for Cambridge United and signed after passing a medical.\n\n\"We've seen good performances from him, and he's a good addition to the squad,\" said manager Rob Newman.\n\n\"He's got electric pace, he's an exciting player, and he was unlucky not to play more games for Hereford last year, so we're delighted to bring him in.\n\n\"He has a proven goalscoring record in the Conference and just lacked games at Hereford, so hopefully he can come to us and give us the pace we need in the Conference. If we play to his strengths then he will make us much stronger.\"\n\nCarey-Bertram joins another former Hereford United player, Jon Brady, at the club.\n\nThis article comes from the Malawi website Nation Online and was first published on May 24th:\n\nA Malawian football prodigy Tamika Mkandawire is making waves in English football where he has inspired Hereford FC earn promotion from the Conference League into the English League Two. To add spice to an already hot mixture, the defender was also voted the club's player of the season Tuesday.\n\nMkandawire, 22, wrote his name into Hereford folklore on Saturday when he captained the Bulls' return to the Football League after nine years of agony.\n\nFam president Walter Nyamilandu said Tuesday the association is already planning to persuade the tough-as-teak defender to play for his fatherland.\n\nThe right back, who once expressed serious interest to play for the Flames while turning out for English Premiership outfit West Bromwich Albion's reserve side, was the driving force as Hereford beat Halifax Town 3-2 in extra time to wing into League Two.\n\n\"I watched the highlights of the game on TV on Sunday and I was impressed with the Tamika's performance. We are now going to intensify our drive to persuade him to play for Malawi. We cannot take chances because if we are to live to our dream of qualifying for the 2008 Africa Nations Cup in Ghana, then these are the type of players we need.\n\n\"If we are to have any realistic chances of beating teams like Morocco then we have to convince players like Tamika to come and play for their nation, he is a quality player and I was very impressed,\" said Nyamilandu.\n\nMkandawire, who has a Malawian father and British mother, expressed interest to play for the Flames three years ago, but the authorities here never followed up the matter with him. He scored six goals for Hereford in the just ended season.\n\nAccording to a match report, Welsh international Ryan Green grabbed a wonderful extra time winner to secure the Bulls' promotion. His sweet left-footed effort curling beyond the helpless Town 'keeper Jon Kennedy to spark amazing scenes and send the 10,000 travelling Bulls into raptures with 10 minutes of extra time remaining.\n\nThere were fireworks as man-of-the-moment Mkandawire lifted the Bob Lord Trophy.\n\nCurrently, Malawi has only five notable players plying their trade in European leagues namely Joseph Kamwendo, Clement Kafwafwa and Heston Munthali who are based in Denmark, Essau Kanyenda who plays in Russia and Dan Chitsulo who is based in Germany.\n\nNotts County have appointed former assistant manager Steve Thompson as their new boss.\n\nThompson last managed a side in 2005, when an unsuccessful 23 game spell ended with Cambridge United being relegated to the Conference. He also has previous spells with Lincoln and Sheffield Utd.\n\nThe appointment has not gone down well with the Supporters Trust, which owns 30% of the club, releasing a statement: \"Once we were informed that Steve Thompson was the preferred candidate for the team manager position the trust board made its concerns known to club chairman Jeff Moore. Many of these concerns relate to a previous turbulent time when Thompson was manager along with Colin Murphy. It is clear that many Notts fans still view this period as a highly traumatic one.\n\n\"A delegation from the trust board met with Jeff Moore and he outlined his belief that given the current situation at the club with respect to budgets and playing staff, Steve Thompson was the best choice for the role. The trust board expressed their deep concerns about the appointment. The chairman reiterated that he believed Steve Thompson was the best choice available. The trust board made clear that they could not support the appointment.\"\n\nBristol Rovers are facing a boardroom battle for control of the club.\n\nThree directors from an eight strong board have quit in the past week after one of them, Mike Turl, made proposals to inject £500,000 into the club. The trio claim the offer was rejected by the rest of the board before the full details were given to them.\n\nThe proposals included the removal of current long-serving chairman Geoff Dunford from the post, a move now backed by Supporters Club chairman John Malyckyj: \"In taking this decision, we realised the implications that it would have for chairman Geoff Dunford and his colleagues. But based on the information provided, it appeared to provide a real opportunity to begin the task of taking Bristol Rovers forward once again. The loss of Mike Turl, Kevin Spencer and Colin Williams represents a hammer blow to Bristol Rovers and in my view their return to the board and the implementation of Mike's plan should be a priority for everyone.\"\n\nThe supporters club have a director and an associate director on the board but the majority shareholders, two other directors holding 54% of shares between them, are currently backing Dunford.\n\nSupporters of Hereford United will be able to purchase season tickets from this morning.\n\nTicket prices have risen on the one hand to reflect that there are 23 home games this season in League Two as opposed to 21 in the Conference and on the other hand to reflect the higher level of football this coming season at Edgar Street.\n\nBelow is a list of season ticket prices as released by the club:\n\nMERTON STAND (Blocks B,C & D)\n\nAdult £300\n\nChild/Senior Citizen £224\n\nMERTON STAND (Block A - Beefeater section)\n\nAdult + 1 Child £350\n\nAdult + 2 Children £390\n\nAdult + 3 Children £425\n\n2 Adults + 1 Child £600\n\n2 Adults + 2 Children £635\n\nSenior Citizen £200\n\nLEN WESTON STAND\n\nAdult £300\n\nChild/Senior Citizen £224\n\nGROUND\n\nAdult £260\n\nChild/Senior Citizen £180\n\nThere is an under-16 concession if a ticket is purchased before July 14th. Prices are Stand - £130, Ground - £100.\n\nThese prices are a real discount and work at at just over £5 per game in the stands and just over £4 in the ground.\n\nPlease note that the club may require proof of age when purchasing any sort of concession ticket.\n\nHereford United's young striker, Andy Williams, recently gave an interview to boredatbreak.com.\n\nHere's a flavour of what Williams said:\n\n\"I got lucky with injuries this year, Guy and Adam were out for a long time. But I got on the bench at Accrington and came on. But the turning point was when I came on against Burton at Edgar Street and won a penalty. Then I got into a run.\n\n\"The first time I heard the crowd sing \"WILLO\" I was buzzing. It's the best feeling, amazing!\n\n\"I've always said I never want to leave Hereford without them receiving a fee for me. I've got an improved contract with the club and I'm very happy! I trained a lot in the summer very hard. I got myself in better shape and grew a lot as well.\"\n\nWilliams has always wanted to play football.\n\n\"There was never anything else that I wanted to do. I've tried coaching but it's so frustrating! I couldn't watch Hereford much as a youngster, I always played football on a Saturday morning. I used to go in the stands, I only went in the Meadow End a couple of times.\"\n\nThe full interview can be read on www.boredatbreak.com\n\nSwansea may be cooling their reputed interest in Tamika Mkandawire, with the Daily Mirror reporting that they will double their bid for Wycombe captain Roger Johnson.\n\nThe Swans have already had a £100,000 bid for central defender Johnson rejected, and will return next week with a £200,000 offer. In the paper Swansea manager Kenny Jackett is happy to wait for an answer: \"The club doesn't seem to be in a hurry to sell. We'll play a waiting game. It's not as if we have to get Johnson in by next Saturday.\"\n\nIn other news former Bulls striker Steve Guinan, subject to rumours of a return to Edgar Street, has passed his UEFA A coaching licence at Lilleshall. Guinan, 30, was one of only eight of the 29 strong class to pass the course, but told the Gloucestershire Echo that he would still wait and see what would happen: \"I am pretty certain I will be going elsewhere. I've had a few offers come in but I'm taking my time and weighing things up.\"\n\nOf those players offered contracts, only three remain to commit themselves to Hereford United for another season, or leave.\n\nIn alphabetical order they are Sam Gwynne, Tamika Mkandwire, and Craig Stanley.\n\nSam Gwynne is still just 18 and although he is yet to start for Hereford United there is little doubt he is a talented midfielder.\n\nTurner obviously rates him as he is often seen travelling with the first team even when not on the bench. Beleived to have been watched by Birmingham, Gwynne may need another season before he is a regular.\n\nTamika Mkandawire is the one player of the three every supporter hopes will stay at Edgar Street. Reported to have been offered the captain's armband as part of a new contract, Mkandawire has formed an excellent partnership with Dean Beckwith in defence and would be difficult to replace.\n\nThere is little doubt that he will leave Hereford United for a bigger club in the near future, but, like Andy Williams, he may feel another year under the guidance of Graham Turner will do his career no harm. In any case Turner will probably agree to a clause in any contract allowing him to talk to other clubs.\n\nSwansea City are one club rumoured to have tracked Mkandawire recently.\n\nCraig Stanley has matured as a player in the past season. His partnership with Andy Ferrell in the heart of midfield still needs working on, but Stanley is young enough to improve.\n\nRecent speculation linking the midfielder with Exeter suggests that Turner may not have made him, in his opinion, a very good offer. Perhaps the Hereford United manager sees Stanley as no more than a squad player in Division Two.\n\nOn the other hand most players have agents and it is not difficult to feed a story to the press with the intention of trying to get a better deal.\n\nWhatever the truth, Graham Turner told those players offered contracts he wanted answers from them quickly.\n\n\"They have been given a set period of time to consider the offers presented to them,\" Turner said last month.\n\nThe Exeter Express and Echo has reported that former Grecian manager Alex Inglethorpe has delivered striker Adam Stansfield as his parting gift to Exeter City.\n\nStansfield, who was born at near-by Tiverton, is said to have turned down a deal at Edgar Street in favour of a return to Exeter where he had a trial when he was 19.\n\n\"He is a player I would have loved to have worked with,\" Inglethorpe told Echo Sport.\n\n\"His ability is there for all to see. When he returned to the Hereford side towards the end of last season it triggered an upturn in their fortunes and he was the catalyst they needed to go on and finish the season strongly.\n\n\"He is a proven goalscorer and his importance was shown by the fact that Hereford started with him in both play-off semi-finals and the final.\n\n\"Any combination of him, Lee Phillips and Jamie Mackie will prove very difficult for opposition defences.\n\n\"Adam is 27 and in his prime. He is at a great age for a striker and is ready to give his best years to Exeter City. And with Lee at 25 and Jamie at 22 and both getting better all the time, there is a very promising and very exciting set of forwards at the club.\"\n\nThe paper also suggests that any move for another Hereford player, Craig Stanley, is highly unlikely.\n\nThe Western Morning News also reported the move. It quoted Julian Tagg, Exeter's sporting director.\n\n\"It's an excellent signing,\" said Tagg\n\n\"Adam has a proven track record in this league, he is a local boy returning to the area, which is also important, and what is also important is that, although Alex has gone, he still wants to come here.\n\n\"He was looking forward to working with Alex, but it is a measure of how far we have come that someone still believes enough in the club and the advances that it has made, even though there is not a manager in place.\"\n\nAccording to the Lancashire press, Accrington Stanley's first season in League Two could be tight financially.\n\nIt is said that police has decided that Accrington should play their home games on the same day as Burnley and appeals to the police for the Milkmen to be paired with Blackburn instead have been dismissed.\n\nStanley could lose £100,000 in revenue from gate receipts with the absence of Burnley fans who are said to follow Accrington when their team is away.\n\nBurnley Chairman Barry Kilby said:\n\n\"Both me and Eric Whalley (Stanley chairman) are really annoyed about the decision, particularly Eric as he has been the one making representations to the police.\n\n\"It's going to cost them up to £100,000, and it will hit us to some extent because there are people that would want to go to the home games of both Burnley and Accrington and obviously won't be able to now.\n\n\"Accrington and Blackburn are in the same police division and it seems they are reluctant to police the two matches, although what policing a game like Accrington v Macclesfield would require, for example, I don't know.\n\n\"Neither us or Accrington want this decision.\"\n\nThe local Exeter papers are reporting that Adam Stansfield has signed for Exeter on a two year deal.\n\nRumours on the forums over the past week suggested that the Bulls had offered him a one year deal, with Stansfield wanting two years, and that former Exeter boss Alex Inglethorpe was quoted as saying he wanted to 'see one deal through' before leaving for good.\n\nShould the story be confirmed, Stansfield's departure will leave the Bulls with teenage strikers Andy Williams and Stuart Fleetwood as the only strikers at the club following Danny Carey-Bertram's departure yesterday.\n\nStansfield started just one third of the Bulls matches this season after struggling with a series of injuries, and also struggled to be fit for long periods of last season with Graham Turner now notably cautious about offering longer deals to players seen as injury prone.\n\nStuart Fleetwood has joined Rob Purdie, Simon Travis and Wayne Brown in signing on for Hereford United according to the Official Hereford United Website. Fleetwood, like Purdie and Travis, has signed a one year deal at Edgar Street.\n\nFleetwood has been with Hereford United since his release from Cardiff City in January.\n\nThe Official site also reports that fellow striker Danny Carey-Bertram has left Edgar Street. Carey-Bertram is said to be looking for first team football, which he didn't get much of in his three year spell with The Bulls."
