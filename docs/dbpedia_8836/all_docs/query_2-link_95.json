        "text": "THERE were celebrations at Exeter City Football Club on Thursday, October 25 when it officially unveiled its new £3.4 million stadium redevelopment.\n\nThe project, which has seen the construction of a new stand, changing rooms, away end, and associated facilities, will be opened to fans for the first time today, Saturday, October 27.\n\nIt also features a heritage display which has been created thanks to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the work of the Supporters’ Trust history group and the Grecian Archive, in partnership with the University of Exeter.\n\nJulian Tagg, chairman of Exeter City FC, said: “It was wonderful to welcome so many friends of the club to celebrate the opening of the new stand, from our loyal supporters’ groups and our fantastic sponsors, to the contractors who worked on the development, as well as Exeter City Council.\n\n“It is a huge achievement to build new facilities such as these and deliver on schedule. There have been numerous hurdles to overcome along the way, from legal challenges to the student housing, to the everyday problems that building a development like this in a working stadium creates.\n\n“We have been very lucky to have a dedicated team, working closely with excellent contractors and project managers to deliver this successfully. I am looking forward with great anticipation to seeing the first fans in their seats – and I’m sure they are as well.”\n\nThe match against Forest Green Rovers today will see the Stagecoach Adam Stansfield Stand in use for the first time and filled to 50 per cent capacity – a requirement of the Safety Advisory Group (SAG) which oversees stadium safety.\n\nThe Away End will be opened for the first time to fans from Blackpool FC on November 9 or 10 for the first round of the FA Cup.\n\nThe original stand dated back to 1926 and would have needed extensive repairs, and possibly faced permanent closure if its safety certificate had been withdrawn by the SAG.\n\nMr Tagg added: “This whole project wouldn’t have been possible without Exeter City Council. The stand, along with the ground it is built on, is owned by the council and we owe it a huge debt of gratitude for providing the majority of the funding of this development, from the proceeds of the sale of its land behind the Big Bank.”\n\nIn his speech at the opening event, Bob Dennison, managing director Stagecoach South West, said: “At Stagecoach, we are, and always have been, about people, from the people that we employ, to the people that we carry on our buses right in the heart of our community.\n\n“Community is something we believe very strongly in and is one of the major reasons we have supported Exeter City Football Club, a true community organisation, for more than 12 years.\n\n“Through our enduring partnership we know that this is a club which puts its supporters and the city at the heart of everything it does, a club with which we share many of our core values.\n\n“We were also very pleased to recognise one of Exeter’s truly great players and share the naming rights of the stand, to make it the Stagecoach Adam Stansfield Stand.”"
