        "text": "Exeter fan in peace. Just reading through this thread for obvious reasons and thought I'd clarify a few things.\n\nLiam McAlinden isn't on loan, he signed a permanent deal with us in the summer of 2016, from Wolves. I like him and I hope he'll be an adequate Wheeler replacement when he leaves. Liam is only 22 and I see plenty of scope for improvement, particularly as we do have a good record of improving players.\n\nAs Hintonsboots alluded, Wheeler came to professional football comparatively late. He also suffers with asthma and during his first couple of seasons with us he rarely completed 90 minutes and was often used most effectively as a super sub. I suspect that his upturn in both consistency and form may in part be down to his learning how to manage his condition within the rigours of professional football. He is a great finisher and he is one of the best players in the air I've seen. He regularly out jumps defenders far taller than himself and he is also very quick. As he is over 24 we wouldn't get a penny for him if he chose to let his contract run down so unfortunately he'll be available for a lot less than Ollie Watkins\n\nI can't shed any light on whether Watkins is a done deal yet, however 2.4 million is what I'd expect as a minimum and I'd want add ons too, certainly a percentage of any sell on profit. He is special and I feel sure he'll replicate this form and goalscoring ability at a higher level.\n\nAs for Ethan Ampadu, I'm afraid you guys have no chance at all. He is the son of Kwame Ampadu, a former Exeter player who is now an academy coach at Arsenal. He's been watched by all the biggest teams for a number of years and almost certainly would have gone years ago had his parents not insisted he complete his education first. He is currently in year eleven at school and will be off at the end of the season. The smart money is on Arsenal but any of the top 6 is possible. As he is yet to sign a pro deal with us we'll end up with a pittance as a consequence of the EPPP, a system that means Premier League clubs pay a fixed tariff for academy players from lower league teams. It's daylight robbery. Look it up if you haven't heard of it as it includes Championship clubs. If he was already a pro with us we'd already be talking millions rather than thousands for his services, based on his potential alone. He was recently named the Wales Young Player of the year when he had just turned 16.\n\nGood luck with the rest of the season\n\nExeter fan in peace.
