        "text": "This was the team that was assembled in our Conference days that won at Wembley on 18th May 2008 taking City back into the Football League after 5 years:-\n\nSTARTERS\n\nPaul Jones Olejnik\n\nSteve Tully ???\n\nGeorge Friend ???\n\nMatt Taylor Sweeney\n\nRyan Harley ditto\n\nDan Seaborne JMT\n\nRob Edwards ???\n\nRichard Logan Reid\n\nMatthew Gill James\n\nAdam Stansfield Wheeler\n\nDean Moxey Holmes\n\nSUBS\n\nBen Watson\n\nAndy Marriott\n\nLee Elam\n\nBertrand Cozic\n\nWayne Carlisle\n\nHappy days! I wouldn't say no to that squad this season tbh.\n\nI've done a comparison above..\n\nProper full-backs, a defensive midfielder and both strikers looked like they had goals in them. The latter could be rectified now if the correct options were chosen (i.e. Wheeler or Watkins without Simpson) But there are three fundamental positions we are really struggling in now, in comparison. The centre midfielders aren't as good either but the conf. midfield had one big advantage, Rob Edwards! A player in a similar mould might make the world of difference to Harley and James.\n\nOn paper the rest isn't too bad. The biggest difference between then and now though is a somewhat forward thinking manager who mixed it up, set his team up in a balanced fashion with a decent spine with no clear weaknesses. This is opposed to a manager now who is too comfortable, reactive as opposed to proactive and either too stubborn or blinded to rectify the ****ing obvious.\n\nThat team would absolutely smash our current no hopers out of sight.\n\nDeano and Friend both made it to the Premiership whilst Jones, Seaborne, Taylor, Harley and Gill made it the Championship. The rest made it to L1 with us.\n\nMost of that team were with us when we were promoted the following season.\n\nOf course the likes of Friend and Moxey were wet behind the ears in 2008 and were nowhere near the players they turned out to be.\n\nI reckon only Holmes and Reid from today's team would feature in the Wembley team."
