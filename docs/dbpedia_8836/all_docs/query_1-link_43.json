        "text": "The eleven players that Graham Turner chose to play the first 45 minutes yesterday against Notts County looked as though they could be a force to be reckoned with as long as Turner can sign trialist Andy Ferrell.\n\nThe midfield of Ferrell, Coldicott and Brady gave the Bulls some strength that has been missing over the past couple of seasons.\n\nIt is uncertain whether Ferrell has agreed a deal with Hereford. Press reports suggest Darlington are still interested in him, but in this age of agents and the like, it is difficult to know whether the press are being fed a story to put pressure on Turner to offer Ferrell a particularily good deal or whether Darlington are still chasing him.\n\nDarlington have another friendly either tomorrow or Tuesday, (Darlington manager Hodgson is likely to give Ferrell a chance to stake his claim in a behind-closed-doors game against Queen of the South on Tuesday according to the Nortern Echo.) and Hereford on Tuesday. Time will tell whether Turner can persuade Ferrell to come to Edgar Street, but his signature would be a quality signing.\n\nStacy Coldicott's signing is expected to be announced either tomorrow (August 1st) or Tuesday. It is beleived he is still under contract at Grimsby until tonight.\n\nAs regards the other trialists recently seen at Hereford, none featured yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile Turner seemed pleased with yesterday's performance.\n\n\"We have said all along that the results are secondary through pre-season but it is good for the players confidence to hold on for a win, and against a League-quality side,\" Turner told the Non-League Paper.\n\n\"There was some good stuff at times and also some areas we need to improve on but, with a fortnight to go, it's now a sharpening up process.\"\n\nHere is an edited report from Notts County:\n\nThe Magpies rounded off their pre-season programme on Saturday afternoon at Hereford United, and didn't end things as they would have liked with a 2-1 defeat against the Conference National side.\n\nThe opening period of the game saw a tight start from both sides, with Notts setting out on the attack once more and knocking a few balls into the Hereford box, but they were well dealt with by the solid defence, but it was home side who took the lead in the early exchanges thanks to a goal from a former Football League forward.\n\nGuy Ipoua, a player who gave Notts a torrid time last season when with Mansfield, was the man who opened the scoring for the home side on eight minutes following a cross from the right-hand side with a close range header that just managed to beat the unlucky Kevin Pilkington - while a few moments later Ipoua, who got in behind Julien Baudet for the opening goal, gave Notts another scare as he burst clean through, but Pilkington saved from the eventual move as Notts let their solidarity status slip, something they had gained over pre-season.\n\nHereford, a side who finished second in the Conference in each of the last two seasons, certainly were giving Notts a tough start and were already signalling their intentions for the new season as Notts tried to draw themselves back into the game.\n\nNotts' first chance came on around fifteen minutes into proceedings with Wales Under21 International David Pipe powering into the box and crossing for Steve Scoffham who hit the ball into the ground and the ball evaded Andy White, who was later caught offside as he tried to get hold of the ball. Chris Palmer also had a shot a few moments later which shot wide for a goal kick.\n\nChris Palmer was again in the thick of it a few moments later with the best chance for the Magpies in the opening stages falling to the head of Andy White who headed just inches over the crossbar as Gudjon Thordarson's men tried to grab their composure after a rocky start.\n\nDespite forcing their way back into proceedings, Hereford were always looking the better side in attack with Ipoua causing the defence no end of problems with Wilson and Baudet having their hands full while Mkandiware forced Kevin Pilkington to save well while Mike Edwards glanced a header over the bar following a Palmer corner.\n\nBut, just as Notts got back into proceedings former Wolves defender Ryan Green nodded home from close range to make it 2-0. The chance arose after the quick footed Adam Stansfield burst away from Baudet and crossed for the Welshman to put the ball away from Pilkington once again. No doubt Notts were in for a real rollicking from Gudjon Thordarson at the break, severely losing their 'difficult to beat' tag and making it far too easy for the home side.\n\nA corner just before the break put Notts under more pressure but the defence did manage to get the ball clear, with the Magpies looking well out of sorts with defeat for the first time in pre-season looking on the cards as the half-time whistle sounded at Edgar Street.\n\nThe half-time break no doubt saw Gudjon Thordarson dish out a few harsh words to is squad, with changes expected and they did happen with Rob Ullathorne coming off the bench for Dan Martin, as did Glynn Hurst and Gavin Gordon as they replaced Scoffham and White in attack as Thordarson looked to give his side a boost and push their way back into the game.\n\nChris Palmer had a long-range shot a few seconds into the half that failed to trouble the home goalkeeper while a route one piece of football saw Pilkington's long clearance find the head of Gavin Gordon who found Glynn Hurst who burst through but shot straight at the goalkeeper while as Notts really went all out attack David Pipe's cross was well gathered by Moore.\n\nAlthough chances were few and far between as the game reached the hour mark, there was a certain improvement in Notts' play with the midfield linking up a lot better and the use of the ball a lot better with a few moves coming together although the final ball was lacking as Notts got into the final third.\n\nNotts did draw themselves back into the game with Jake Sheridan scoring just a minute after coming off the bench to score with a good effort after showing some trickery on the right-hand side and his eventual shot went through a number of players and found the back of the net.\n\nSheridan was again at the centre of things but sending a delightful ball into the box ahead of Gavin Gordon, who just missed the ball as the ball went to the goalkeeper and moments later he picked up the ball at the far post, but the Bulls managed to clear under pressure as Notts continued to have the better chances. When Hereford did threaten, Pilkington dealt with things well.\n\nPipe was proving dangerous with his overlapping runs from right-back behind Jake Sheridan and delivered a fine ball towards Hurst, but the South African headed the ball over the crossbar as they sought to get back on to level terms.\n\nPilkington did well to deny sub Danny Carey-Bertram with a fine one-handed save as Hereford finally got a shot in at goal and from the resulting corner Notts switched off and Mkandiware headed over with the goal there for him to aim at, showing the home side were not out of things, but with time running out Notts' chances dried up although Gill's long range effort was well saved four minutes from time.\n\nThe game, against a strong Conference side was certainly a good workout for Thordarson's side. Being 2-0 down at the break gave him chance to see his players react to being behind, and a strong second-half performance will have no doubt given him some positives to take into this weeks training sessions ahead of the journey to Torquay in the League Two opener next weekend.\n\nHereford United played their final home warm-up game before the Conference season begins on August 13th against League Two outfit Notts County. The County side included a number of well known players including former Premiership players Kevin Pilkington, Rob Ullathorne and Gavin Gordon.\n\nGraham Turner opted for a 3-5-2 formation with trialists Andy Ferrell and Stacey Coldicott pairing up with Jon Brady in the middle of the park. Their was also a debut for Guy Ipoua following his signing yesterday alongside Adam Stansfield in the attack. Wayne Brown, signed from Chester City on a one-season loan, was named on the bench before being introduced to the home crowd midway throught the second half.\n\nUnited started very brightly with some neat football, allowing County very little in terms of possession and so it was no surprise when the home side took the lead after eight minutes. Ferrell fed a neat pass out wide to Brady on the right flank. His pin-point cross was met at the far post by Ipoua, whose diving header beat Pilkington at the near post.\n\nIpoua showed good strength and held up play very well; he seemed the sort of attacker that Bulls fans have been longing for. A neat flick on the by-line found Ryan Green moments after the opener but the Welshmans shot was parried away. Ipoua collected the ball again and won a free kick on the right. Brady squared it to Alex Jeannin but his low effort was saved without much trouble.\n\nThe Magpies had a couple of decent chances later in the half but neither hit the target as Steve Scoffham and Andy White attempted to level things up. Ipoua was once again felled on the right and Tamika Mkandawire went close with a close range header following Brady's excellent delivery. Hereford did manage to make it 2-0 before the break though.\n\nIpoua held off his marker and threaded a pass through to Stansfield. He raced onto the through ball and marginally beat Pilkington to it. He poked a foot at the ball, which seemed to hit a defender before flying into the air, before being met by the head of man of the match Green, who converted from inside the box.\n\nCounty came back into the game after the interval and grabbed a goal back moments after both sides had made changes. Coldicott and Ferrell were withdrawn and replaced by Craig Stanley and Rob Purdie and within two minutes Jake Sherriden, who'd only been on the pitch a couple of minutes himself, scored from the edge of the box. His inswinging cross-come-shot caught Craig Mawson out and dropped into the far bottom corner.\n\nIpoua and Mawson were taken off as Brown was handed a home debut in goal and Danny Carey-Bertram was given a run out in the attack. Brady set up another attack in which Stansfield crossed for Purdie, who couldn't find the target, before United made their final two changes with Andy Williams and Sam Gwynne taking the places of Brady and Stansfield.\n\nCarey-Bertram's sprint down the right and cut back inside won The Bulls a corner as his near post strike was pushed over the bar. Jeannin crossed to the far post where Dean Beckwith nodded back into the middle for Mkandawire who managed to head inches over from no more than two yards out.\n\nIn the closing stages Brown made a good stop for Hereford while, at the other end, Williams hit a snap shot wide and Stanley's effort was deflected behind.\n\nThe crowd of 777 were treated to United's best display of their pre-season campaign so far. Should Graham Turner secure the signings of Stacey Coldicott and Andy Ferrell, Hereford will have a very strong squad for the start of the season. After todays performance most Hereford fans will be hoping that Turner will be able to name the same starting eleven from today against their first opponents, Scarborough, of the season in two weeks time.\n\nHUFC Team: Mawson, Green, Jeannin, Beckwith, James, Mkandawire, Brady, Coldicott, Ferrel, Ipoua, Stansfield. Subs: Brown, Carey-Bertram, Purdie, Stanley, Gwynne, Williams.\n\nGuy Ipoua was with Doncaster last season although he didn't see that much action with the club. In fact he spent two spells on loan.\n\nFirstly he went to Mansfield last October:\n\nMansfield boss Keith Curle feels loan signing Guy Ipoua was his secret weapon in the Stags' win over Notts County.(could be again tomorrow?-ed)\n\nCurle has recruited Ipoua for a month from Doncaster and handed the former Gillingham and Scunthorpe forward his debut in Saturday's 3-1 victory.\n\n\"I'd like to apologise for not making public that we had signed Guy. I wanted to keep the element of surprise,\" Curle told his club's website.\n\n\"It probably threw a large spanner in the workings of County's gameplan.\"\n\nSecondly to Lincoln City last February:\n\nLincoln City have signed their 567th striker of the season, with the loan signing of ex-Iron Guy Ipoua on loan from Doncaster.\n\nThe 29-year-old Cameroon forward joins the Imps for a month, after failing to make an impact on Doncaster's first-team.\n\nLincoln boss Keith Alexander said: \"Guy has got plenty of experience and knows what is required at this level.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Pennies from Heaven un-official Doncaster site seem to be glad Ipoua was leaving Belle View. They commented:\n\nWho's stupid enough to sign Guy Ipoua!\n\nGuy Ipoua - Going to Hereford. Oh joy, oh joy, oh joy! Never mind betting odds, I'll pay his train fare and buy him a cup of coffee and a paper for his journey.\n\nThis item was originally published whilst Guy Ipoua was at Livingston FC.\n\nBest Goal Scored:\n\n\"I think it was during my spell with Scunthorpe, when I scored two in a Second Division game against Burnley, which was on TV. I'd say those were the best two goals of my career that day. The first one was a volley, and in the second one I took the ball from my own half and went on a mazy run before lobbing the goalkeeper.\"\n\nBest Game Played in:\n\n\"Probably when I scored four goals for Scunthorpe in one game, against Mansfield. I played quite well on the day, but obviously scoring the goals makes that game stick out in my mind. Even better, that game came just a few days after I scored a hat-trick in the FA Cup against Hartlepool. Seven goals in a week!\"\n\nBest Player Played With:\n\n\"One of my best friends, Valerien Ismael is playing for Werder Bremen and doing well at the top of the Bundesliga, while David Perpetuini, a former team-mate at Gillingham, is also a good mate. Both are good players, and also great people personally.\"\n\nBest Stadium:\n\n\"Vincente Calderon, Athletico Madrid's stadium. It is fantastic stadium, especially in terms of atmosphere. When there are 80,000 people there it's brilliant; the crowd are so passionate.\"\n\nBest Career Influence:\n\n\"I have to say my brother Samuel, who is a footballer as well. He played in the 1998 World Cup for Cameroon, our country. When I was younger I always used to look up to him. He wanted to become a professional player from an early age, and I didn't want to be left behind.\"\n\nBiggest Achievement:\n\n\"I think it is still to come. I have played for some great clubs - Torino, Athletico Madrid, Seville - but I didn?t really succeed there as much as I wanted. In the future it would be a big achievement for me to play in a World Cup for Cameroon or something like that.\"\n\nHereford United has announced its second signing this week.\n\nGuy Ipoua is joining the club from Doncaster. He has agreed a one year deal.\n\nIpoua is a center forward who played twenty minutes or so for the Bulls against Bristol Rovers in a friendly last Saturday. On the day he looked unfit.\n\n29 year-old Ipoua was born in Cameroon. He is just over 6ft and is said to weigh a little over 13 stone.\n\nHe started his football career at Bristol Rovers in August 1998 so would know a few of Ian Atkins squad.\n\nAfter a year he moved to Scunthorpe. He then went to Gillingham, whilst Wayne Jones the Hereford physio was there, and afterwards to Livingston.\n\nHe transferred to Doncaster in July last year, but has fell out of favour at Belle View. He spent loan periods at both Mansfield and Lincoln last season.\n\nMeanwhile there are rumours this evening that another club is interested in trialist Graham Evans.\n\nCaersws Manager Mike Evans told the Powys County Times: \"Graham is currently playing in some Hereford United friendlies and he is doing very well and scored a couple of goals.\n\n\"He is enjoying the experience and we'll just wait and see what happens.\"\n\nGraham Turner has told the Worcester News that he feels there is room for improvement around the penalty box after the Bulls only scored twice against Bromsgrove.\n\n\"I think there was a disappointment in as much as we weren't sharp enough in and around the penalty area. I thought we had the ball in good areas and never made the most of it,\" he said.\n\nThe Hereford United manager was happier with his defence.\n\n\"I thought we defended well. We protected the goalkeeper in the main. Whichever one has been on, Brown or Mawson, has not had too much to do in the entire game.\"\n\nMoving on to tomorrow's friendly, Turner said that he will put out a stonger side, with both Ryan Green and Tony James back from injury.\n\n\"We have people like Ryan Green and Tony James to come in and one or two other injured players ready to come back in so it'll be a different side again than the one we played against Bromsgrove.\"\n\nIt isn't often that the two managers at a game have the same initials, but it will happen at Edgar Street tomorrow.\n\nGudjon Thordarson, who hails from Iceland, is the manager of visitors Notts County.\n\nThe match will be the Magpies final friendly of pre-season and Thordarson has named a strong squad for the trip to Hereford.\n\n\"Saturday is our final game. It is important they show me they are ready for the season. It is a big week ahead, and I look forward to the hard work ahead,\" Thordarson told the official Notts County Website.\n\nHe also commented that Hereford United are a good side who will prove a good test.\n\n\"We are going to go down there and get a good workout. We need to continue being disciplined and keep our formation and shape of the team.\"\n\nTrialist Stacy Long is again included in the squad, as is Brian O'Callaghan for the first time in a First Team friendly since scoring at Hucknall at the start of July. Saul Deeney is again included in the squad and will provide backup for Kevin Pilkington.\n\nThe game is the final test for the Magpies ahead of the trip to Torquay, so it should be an interesting afternoon at Edgar Street.\n\nNotts County were due to play against Burton Albion last night but the game was called off as the pitch was waterlogged.\n\nGraham Turner is likely to play his first choice team tomorrow. However he may be without Ryan Green, who missed Wednesday's friendly at Bromsgrove. However he will probably give both goalkeepers, Craig Mawson and Wayne Brown, some action.\n\nThe selection of the remainder of the team could depend on whether any other signings are announced before kick-off which is at 3pm.\n\nIn his interview last Monday, John Trewick, the Hereford United coach, suggested that there would be more than one signing this week. But, as yet, only the loan deal of Wayne Brown has been revealed.\n\nMeanwhile according to sources at Caersws, Graham Evans was still registered with the Mid-Wales side as of last evening. They suggest that he is having a two-week trial with the Bulls.\n\nEvans has also had a trial with Aldershot Town. He played 45 minutes for them in their first pre-season friendly against Farnborough on July 8th. Aldershot lost 2-0.\n\nGraham Evans, the Welsh League striker from Caersws, has featured in four of Hereford United's five friendlies so far. The only game he missed was the first against Bristol City.\n\nTo have played him in four games must mean that manager Graham Turner thinks he has some potential. But it is a fair step up from the Welsh League to the Conference.\n\nEvans knows where the back of the net is as his record shows. He has scored 131 goals in 191 games for Caersws; his best tally was 25 in 2000/1.\n\nTwo of the Bulls current squad, Tony James and Ryan Green, will have played with Evans in the Wales team that played in the Four Nations tournament in 2003.\n\n25 year-old Evans spent two seasons with Aston Villa before returning in March 2000 to Caersws who are managed by his father Micky Evans. Evans senior played 368 games for Wrexham.\n\nSome supporters who have seen him in the friendlies are comparing him to former Bulls player David Brown. However Evans is probably not as fit as he might be as Caersws are part-time.\n\nOne difference between the two is that Evans seems to stay on his feet whereas Brown was prone to lose his footing.\n\nShould Evans be offered a contract, it is unlikely to be an expensive one. But like others before him from lower divisions there is always a risk factor. Turner will remember both Scott Voice and Steve Pearce, both of whom could score goals at a lower level but couldn't produce the goods whilst at Edgar Street.\n\nIf a deal is sorted it will probably only be for this season.\n\nGoals from Danny Carey-Bertram and Graham Evans sealed a 2-0 win for Hereford United this evening against Bromsgrove Rovers. Loan signing Wayne Brown made his debut in goal and there were starts once again for trialists Rees Smith and Evans.\n\nIt took Hereford a while to get going in the first half, they finally did after some good work from Evans, Rob Purdie collected the ball and after beating a defender tested the 'keeper with a powerful shot but the goalie made the save. Minutes later Alex Jeannin crossed in and after the keeper missed it, Evans volleyed over from a good position. Evans was once again in the thick of the action after a good ball through from Smith, his low shot was tipped into the path of Andy Williams but the Bromsgrove 'keeper Andy Price was once again equal to it making another decent save.\n\nA free kick from Alex Jeannin was hit over, but shortly aftrwards Bromsgrove striker Lee Greenaway tested Brown with a low shot but the goalie saved with ease. Approaching half time, young winger Rees Smith had two good chances but both times his shots went wide.\n\nThe Bulls were unchanged at the start of the second half. Early on Bromsgrove threatened, once again Greenaway got space but, as before, his shot was easy for Brown. Just four minutes into the second half, Hereford took the lead. Evans beat a defender down the left and he passed into Danny Carey-Bertram, who, from close range fired a shot past the Bromsgrove goalkeeper and made it 1-0 to Hereford.\n\nHereford settled into the lead and in the sixtieth minute, they doubled their advantage. Good work from Andy Williams down the left led to his pass finding Evans who then powerfully struck a left foot drive past the 'keeper. Craig Stanley was replaced by trialist Matt Morrison, Purdie made way for Jon Brady and Tamika Mkandawire left the field with Rob Williams coming on for him.\n\nDebutant goalkeeper Brown had little to do although was tested by Barnes-Homer but his shot was once again saved. Goalscorers Carey-Bertram and Evans both came off and were replaced by Adam Stansfield and trialist Nathan Brown. Brady had opportunities towards the end of the game to make it three but Price saved from his long range effort and Brady then narrowly missed the top corner with another long range shot. Craig Mawson played the final twenty minutes of the game in goal replacing Brown and Danny Campbell got ten minutes as he came on for Dean Beckwith.\n\nA second pre-season win for Hereford United was watched by about 300. Once again Sam Gwynne and Andy Williams impressed as did striker Graham Evans. It was a good work out for the Bulls but Bromsgrove never looked like scoring; Saturday's game against Notts County will be a much tougher test.\n\nHereford: W.Brown, Gwynne, Jeannin, Mkandawire, Beckwith, Smith, Stanley, Purdie, Evans, Carey-Bertram, A.Williams.\n\nSubs: Stansfield, Mawson, Ferrell, R.Williams, Brady, N.Brown, Morrison, Campbell.\n\nAndy Ferrell, who impressed many Hereford United supporters when he played against Wrexham last week, is not named in tonight's Darlington squad which is playing Bradford City.\n\nFerrell returned to Darlington last Saturday for their game against Middlesborough, but there has been no mention of him getting a contract there.\n\nMeanwhile it is reported in the Non-League Daily today that Carl Heiniger has moved from Team Bath to Hereford United. (There doesn't appear to be any other news on this - maybe it is a mistake - ed)\n\nHeiniger is a central midfielder who started out at Newcastle. He played for England students who defeated Wales 2-0 in the 2005 Home Nations Championships in Edinburgh.\n\nHe put the final result beyond doubt in the 87th minute by scoring from the penalty spot.\n\nUPDATE Wednesday: From the Non-League Daily\n\nCarl Heiniger, born in 1982, was a highly-rated young midfielder with Manchester United and then Newcastle United, he really came to notice after playing for Team Bath in the FA Cup during the 2002/03 season.His performances, along with a number of other students from the same side, earned him a move to German side KSV Hessen Kassel in the summer of 2003, but things didn't work out and he was quickly back in England and in his adopted north-east.Has since had something of a nomadic career, taking in stops at Bishop Auckland, Durham City, Seaham Red Star and, from December 2003, Newcastle Benfield Saints.He returned to Team Bath in December 2004 after trialling back in Germany.\n\nFinally Gravesend manager Liam Daish has told his local paper how he failed to sign Gillingham's Dean Beckwith.\n\n\"I did try to sort something out with Dean, but I think he had already agreed to go to Hereford. I think there is a connection there as their physio Wayne Jones knew Dean from their time together at Gillingham. But there you go - some you win, some you lose.\"\n\nThree goals in the second half saw Hereford United beat Ludlow this evening. A mixed team of first team players, trialists and youngsters took to the field as Graham Turner took another look at striker Graham Evans, midfielder Rees Smith, defender Rob Williams and 'keeper Clint Davies.\n\nDanny Carey-Bertram nearly gave Hereford the lead within the first minute when he was sent through by Evans but his chip was deflected over the bar. Andy Williams, who played on left midfield sent a deep cross in and trialist Smith volleyed just over from close range. Ludlow tested Bulls 'keeper Davies but he was equal to their efforts.\n\nAndy Williams impressed down the left hand side and his cross across the face of the goal should have been converted by Evans who, from close range failed to make good contact on the ball. Ludlow won a free kick which resulted in a shot that hit the side netting. Hereford's best chance of the first half fell to stand in captain Craig Stanley, Carey-Bertram held up the ball well and Stanley burst from midfield to meet the lay-off but his low shot was tipped wide by the Ludlow 'keeper.\n\nThe Bulls kept the same side for the start of the second half as they looked to break the deadlock. Stanley took a quick free kick and nearly caught everyone out with his sweetly taken shot, but he was unlucky to see his shot rebound off the post. In the fifty-fifth minute, Carey-Bertram finally gave Hereford the lead. Evans had the chance to score but he passed to Carey-Bertram, who, from close range shot past the helpless Ludlow 'keeper.\n\nAlex Jeannin replaced Rob Purdie and Tamika Mkandawire came on for Ryan Green and Jeannin was unlucky minutes later with a free kick. He blasted just wide off the post from twenty-five yards. In the sixty-second minute, United scored for the second time. Evans found space on the edge of the area and curled a low shot past the 'keeper. Stanley came off shortly afterwards to give a run out to striker Adam Stansfield.\n\nHereford added a third in the seventy-second minute after good work from Sam Gwynne who got into the box and was bought down by a Ludlow defender. Carey-Bertram took the penalty and confidently placed the ball past the keeper. Trialist D Campbell came on to replace Dean Beckwith and came on to play on right wing. Hereford continued with their pressure and a corner by Jeannin was met by Stansfield but his header was saved by the Ludlow 'keeper. Campbell sent in a cross that was met by Evans but his header was too weak to beat the 'keeper.\n\nHereford United: Davies, Green, Gwynne, Beckwith, R.Williams, Stanley, Smith, Purdie, Carey-Bertram, Evans,A.Williams.\n\nSubs: Mkandawire, Mawson, Stansfield, Jeannin, Campbell.\n\nHereford United have two friendlies this week. This evening they play at Ludlow and on Wednesday they travel to Bromsgrove. Both games start at 7.45pm.\n\nThe Ludlow game, which has become a regular friendly for the Bulls, usually draws a good crowd. It will be Hereford's first friendly against lower opposition and should allow the Bulls to find the back of the net quite often through the game.\n\nIt is thought that Graham Turner will still need to look at several of his trialists before offering any of them a contract. Both strikers, Graham Evans and Guy Ipoua, on view on Saturday may get another chance to impress. So far, neither have looked quite good enough to join the Bulls although Ipoua seemed far from fully fit.\n\nMeanwhile Steve McCormack, joint mamager of Ludlow Town, told the South Shropshire Journal last week that his side are more than capable of holding their own.\n\n\"Looking ahead to this big game against Hereford on Monday, I think we are more than capable of holding our own. We've got some good players who will defend well.\n\n\"Hereford are a good footballing side, but I am looking forward to it. It will be useful to see how good they are, so I can take some ideas from it for the new season, and it's a good opportunity for the lads to pick up some ideas as well.\n\n\"Hopefully there'll be a good crowd and Hereford have said they'll send up a strong side.\"\n\nThe Coors stadium at Ludlow is on the left hand side of the A49 travelling north. To get to the stadium take the left turn at the second roundabout and travel down into Ludlow then turn right past the schools and road-humps.\n\nStriker Anthony Elding has told the Non-League paper that he want to play at a higher level than the Conference.\n\n\"I put in my transfer request because I want to better myself. I feel I have done all I can in this league.\"\n\nElding, who is 23, recently appeared to fall out with manager Graham Westley after he was stopped from going to Spain with his team mates.\n\n\"The gaffer said he'd rather let me rot at home than let me go.\"\n\nHowever Westley has responded writing in yesterday's programme notes.\n\n\"No player will mess us about and move if we don't want him to.\"\n\nElding is a useful striker who has featured in the England non-league team. He played in the Stevenage team that defeated Hereford United in the Conference play-offs last season.\n\nMeanwhile Stevenage have reduced prices for concessions to watch games at Broadhall. They are also reported to have reduced refreshment prices.\n\nThis could be to try and attract more support at the club which is thought to be losing money on a day to day basis.\n\nThe reports about Elding may also be to do with money. Players wages at Stevenage were said to be much higher than at several other Conference clubs.\n\nUPDATE: Elding did not play for Stevenage in a friendly against Peterborough this afternoon.\n\nThis a very slightly edited report of this afternoon's friendly from the Bristol Rovers Official Website.\n\nRovers triumphed by the odd goal in five in an entertaining pre-season friendly match against Hereford United at Edgar Street this afternoon.\n\nGoals from Steve Elliott, Jefferson Louis and trialist and former Blackburn Rovers trainee Marc Richards won the match for the visitors, in a game that saw both teams hold and chase the lead.\n\nRovers made a bright start to the game, and created four decent chances within the opening ten minutes. Good play from Ryan Williams found Jamie Forrester in space only for the ball to get stuck under the striker's feet, and then the duo combined again moments later with Williams firing high after a Forrester pass. Richard Walker picked out Forrester on another Rovers attack forward, but this time the former Hull City front man could only hit a tame effort towards goal from around ten yards out.\n\nMatt Somner headed over from a Chris Carruthers cross, before the home side came forward for their first attack of the game with Graham Evans shooting straight down the throat of Shaun Marshall. Stuart Campbell went close to giving Rovers the lead as he slid in at the back post in an attempt to make contact with a low Forrester cross, and then Hereford broke at the other end with former Yeovil Town man Adam Stansfield latching onto a long ball forward before volleying wide of the target.\n\nAs the first half progressed Hereford came more into the game, with Evans only denied by the quick thinking of Marshall as the goalkeeper came out to push the ball away from the feet of the home striker. John Brady blazed over from the edge of the penalty area as Hereford searched for way through the Rovers defence, before at the other end it was the visitors that took the lead with just three minutes of the first half remaining.\n\nWilliams swung a trademark dangerous corner right into the middle of the Hereford box, and a rising Elliott was there to meet the ball with a powerful header from just inside the six-yard box.\n\nThe second half started off sluggishly for both teams, before seemingly exploding into life as the hour-mark approached. Good play from Stansfield led to Rob Purdie being picked out on the edge of the 18-yard box, and a superbly struck curling shot from the Hereford man left Marshall with no chance to save as the ball flew into the top corner of the Rovers goal.\n\nRovers could have restored their lead just moments later after Forrester found Walker who in turn managed to round the goalkeeper, but after being forced out wide by the shot-stopper he could only cross the ball back into his strike partner, and Forrester would have been disappointed to have fired over from just eight yards.\n\nHereford took the lead for the first time on 62 minutes with another sweetly struck shot. Stansfield was picked out on the edge of the box and his powerful effort left Marshall with absolutely no chance as the ball hammered its way into the back of the net.\n\nRobbie Ryan tried his luck with an ambitious right-footed shot that was comfortably saved by the Hereford goalkeeper, and Steve Elliott was denied not long after with a rasping free-kick that struck the Hereford defensive wall. Marshall fumbled a shot from Craig Stanley before redeeming himself to concede a corner under pressure from Guy Ipoua, before Rovers twice went close at the other end with Lewis Haldane and Louis both failing to find the target from inside the Hereford box.\n\nWith the game entering its closing stages, Rovers managed to get the equaliser they'd been pressing for through much of the second period. Good play from Matt Somner and Richards saw Louis picked out just inside the area, and the striker made no mistake as he rifled a low drive home into the corner of the goal.\n\nRovers pressed hard for the win in the closing stages as Richards fired a shot against the woodwork, Somner went close from around the penalty spot, before eventually the dominance told with Louis winning an aerial challenge to find Richards, and with his back to goal from eight yards out, he turned and volleyed the ball home.\n\nIt was another encouraging display from Rovers who scored three decent team goals against a very good Conference side, and had it not been for some blistering clinical finishes from two Hereford players it could very easily have been a far more comprehensive outcome.\n\nBristol Rovers scored two late goals to beat Hereford United this afternoon. Rob Purdie and Adam Stansfield were on target for United but goals from Steve Elliott, Jefferson Louis and Mark Richards saw the League Two outfit come away with victory. Graham Turner included Stacy Coldicott in his starting line up in a 3-5-2 formation. Tony James returned to the defence and there was a start up front for Graham Evans.\n\nThe first half saw few chances at either end, but it was Bristol Rovers who created more. A well worked corner saw Somner go close to giving Rovers the lead but his header was just over the bar. Dean Beckwith had to make a goal saving challenge after Ryan Williams pulled back to Jamie Forrester but the striker couldn't manage to get the ball out of his feet and Beckwith slid in to clear the danger.\n\nHereford's best chances in the first half came courtesy of captain Tony James and winger Jon Brady. James met a Beckwith cross but his header went wide. Brady shot from the edge of the area but his shot was always rising and caused the Rovers defence no problem. In the fourty-second minute, Rovers took the lead. Defender Elliot met a corner from Ryan Williams and from six yards, his header was too powerful to stop.\n\nAt half time Craig Stanley replaced Coldicott despite a decent performance from the former Grimsby midfielder. Alex Jeannin whipped in some useful free kicks and on one occasion Beckwith leapt above all defenders but failed to make good contact on the ball. In the fifty-eighth minute, Hereford drew level thanks to a superb goal by Purdie. Stansfield stopped the ball from going out for a goal kick and passed to Purdie who cut inside and from the edge of the area curled in a delightful shot past the keeper and into the top corner.\n\nDanny Carey-Bertram replaced trialist Evans up front and sub 'keeper Clint Davies came on for Craig Mawson. Just four minutes after The Bulls had drawn level, they found themselves in front. This time it was Stansfield who got it, Brady found him and Stansfield from twenty-yards shot powerfully past the Rovers 'keeper. Hereford made subs once more after the goal with Stansfield coming off and being replaced with another trialist, Guy Ipoua. Youngster Sam Gwynne also got a chance coming on for Brady.\n\nHereford were pushing for a third and Craig Stanley's well struck volley from thirty-five yards was saved by the Rovers 'keeper, the follow up fell to Ipoua who shot straight at the 'keeper. The Bulls made more subs as Rob Williams came on for Tamika Mkandawire and Rees Smith replaced Purdie. The changes helped Bristol Rovers as Hereford looked unsettled. In the eighty-sixth minute, Louis struck after sub Mark Richards found him, Louis drilled home from the edge of the area.\n\nAndy Williams replaced Ryan Green but it was Rovers who looked as though they were going to get the winner. Richards struck against the post after a goal mouth scramble but just three minutes later, Richards got the winner. Louis won a header and Richards acrobatically fired home from close range past the helpless Davies.\n\nAn attendance of 749 saw some good football from The Bulls and although defeated, it was a good performance from Hereford. Two late goals will not concern Graham Turner as when they were scored, the side was mainly made up of trialists. 99 away fans go back to Bristol after seeing a good display from their side.\n\nHereford: Mawson,Green, Jeannin, Beckwith, James, Mkandawire, Brady, Coldicott, Stansfield, Evans, Purdie.\n\nSubs: Stanley, Carey-Bertram, A.Williams, Gwynne, Smith, R.Williams, Davies, Ipoua.\n\nBristol Rovers: Marshall,Gibb, Carruthers, Anderson, Edwards, Elliot, Campbell, Somner, Walker, Forrester, Williams.\n\nSubs: Ryan, Book, Louis, Disley, Trollope, Husbands, Richards, Haldane.\n\nIt has been confirmed that the trialist who came on as a striker for Hereford United was Graham Evans from Caersws.\n\nGraham Turner will have seen him in action a couple of years ago when watching the Four-Nations tournament when it was held in Wales.\n\nEvans is the son of former Wrexham favourite Mickey Evans, who was in the stands last night as a spectator.\n\nBelow is an edited report of the game which appears in this morning's Daily Post:\n\nWREXHAM would have expected nothing less than the tough test they were given by Conference hosts Hereford at Edgar Street last night.\n\nIn January, Graham Turner's ambitious side went close to derailing the Dragons' journey to last season's LDV Vans Trophy final and, once again, there was plenty of cut and thrust in an entertaining and keenly contested clash.\n\nTurner and his Racecourse counterpart Denis Smith took the opportunity to run the rule over a total of 37 players during the 90 minutes.\n\nAlex Smith, who has impressed in Wrexham's previous two friendly outings, deputised for Andy Holt on the left flank against a United side featuring three close-season signings and several trialists.\n\nIt was former Chester City midfielder Jon Brady who struck first when he put Hereford ahead in the 13th minute.\n\nDennis Lawrence might have done a better job of intercepting Rob Purdie's cross, but the ball flew off his boot and Brady, a summer signing from Stevenage, volleyed past Mike Ingham.\n\nAnd Wrexham - Lee Roche in particular - were caught ball-watching in the 25th minute when Brady's looping cross was firmly headed home by Adam Stansfield to double United's lead.\n\nIt was no more than the Conference side deserved, their pace and strength on the ball having caused the uncomfortable Dragons all sorts of problems. But the visitors stuck to their tried and tested methods and slowly began to force their opponents onto the back foot.\n\nDarren Ferguson picked out Jon Walters, who drove a good effort narrowly wide, before Smith and Walters combined and Ferguson's shot brought a fine save from goalkeeper Craig Mawson.\n\nIt was Lee McEvilly who reduced the deficit four minutes before the break, driving a free kick from outside the area low into the corner of the net.\n\nThe striker went close to doubling his tally three minutes later, meeting Roche's cross to bring another impressive catch from Mawson.\n\nBulls' boss Graham Turner made four changes at the break, giving Welsh semi-pro international Evans his opportunity, but the visitors continued where they had left off, winning two early corners before substitute keeper Clint Davis got his first touch in holding Ferguson's shot.\n\nSmith shuffled his pack on the hour, sending on five replacements including Maltese international goal-keeper Saviour Darmanin and teenage trialist Aaron Samuel, who scored both Wrexham goals at Colwyn Bay last week.\n\nInevitably the game dragged a little, but the Dragons continued to pose the greater threat with Dennis Lawrence just clearing the bar with one header before a McEvilly shot from 20 yards caused Davis some concern.\n\nAnd Wrexham were on level terms after 72 minutes when Levi Mackin showed fine awareness to score from 25 yards after Davis had punched away under pressure from McEvilly.\n\nBut the home side finished strongly, providing Darmanin with a chance to show his skills in twice saving well from Evans.\n\nThere were three new trialists in the Hereford United squad that draw 2-2 with Wrexham this evening.\n\nGoalkeeper Clint Davies, midfielder Andy Ferrell and striker Graham Evans all had their first game or part game for the Bulls.\n\nFerrell started the game in mid-field but moved to left-back during the second half. He looked a useful player and drilled the midfield before being moved.\n\nDavies replaced Mawson at the start of the second period and made several good saves. The Wrexham goal was from a shot which higher class goalies might not have dealt with.\n\nEvans came on during the second period but took time to get into the game, but nearly scored with a twenty yard shot from the right channel but was just tipped to safety.\n\nOf the three Ferrell looked worth a contract, Davies might make a second string goalkeeper, but the jury is probably still out over Evans. He would need another game with longer on the pitch to show how much ability he has.\n\nAndy Ferrell may have been a trainee at Newcastle who spent last season with Watford. He is 21 years old.\n\nClint Davies, an Australian, is beleived to have been a trainee at Birmingham and played with Bristol City last season. He has had spells at Tamworth, Nuneaton, Woking, Bradford and Halifax.\n\nThere is a Graham Evans who plays for Caersws, but it is uncertain whether he is the same Evans who turned out for the Bulls this evening.\n\nAlthough still not signed Stacy Coldicott was on the squad list. He didn't make an appearance this evening.\n\nWrexham, who visit Edgar Street for a friendly against Hereford United this evening, have been told by their administrators that the club can only have 20 players this season.\n\nEarlier this week, according to ic Wales, the administrators went to the High Court to win an injunction stopping Alex Hamilton, who currently owns the club, from evicting the club from the ground and a hearing for the case has been set for November, unless the long drawn out attempts to buy out Hamilton happen in the meantime.\n\nAll this uncertainty does little for the nerves of the Wrexham faithful, or manager Denys Smith. The former Stoke star said: \"I am allowed 20 players because we are in administration. I have 18 signed and must be very careful how I fill the other two gaps.\n\n\"With the help of the supporters' trust, I have been able to secure contracts for some of the players, I love these people to bits because they have been such a great help in the situation we are in.\"\n\nSmith is expected to have a couple of trialists at Edgar Street this evening.\n\nWrexham line-up: Whitely, Lawrence, Williams, Ferguson, Bennett, Mark Crowall, Matthew Crowall, Mark Jones, Pejic, Holt, Spender, Mackin, Quinn, Done, Michael Jones, Harrison, Evans, Ingram, McEvilly and Walters.\n\nLee McEvilly, a striker, who played against the Bulls in the Conference last season, recently moved to the Racecourse from Accrington Stanley.\n\nThe friendly is due to start at 7.45pm and admission is £7 for adults and £4 for concessions.\n\nThe Hereford United Vice Presidents held their AGM last evening and once again the secretary reported that the club has had a good year especially in its fund raising for the Bulls.\n\nThe meeting, chaired by Phil Cleeton, was attended by 31 members plus directors Graham Turner, Joan Fennessy and Granville Smith.\n\nThe treasurer reported that the Vice Presidents raised over £32,500 for the Bulls in the last year - a record for the VP Club despite spending more than £4,000 on refurbishment of the Lounge - and up from £20,500 last season.\n\nHowever it was agreed that the cost of being a VP is to rise by £25 to £375.\n\nAfter the main business Graham Turner addressed the meeting.\n\nHe thought that last season had been a credible one and reminded members that financial matters at the club are now much better with the CVA paid off, and the club operating at a profit.\n\nAs regards the ground he informed members that the leases needed to be renegotiated as League criteria require at least a 10 years lease remaining to enter the Football League.\n\nHe also said that the ground needed major refurbishment. However an architect had been appointed, and plans were ongoing.\n\nAs regards the forthcoming season, Mr Turner told members that three new players had joined the club and another signing was imminent. But he was disappointed to have lost a couple of good players.\n\nIn answer to questions, Mr. Turner expected 21-22 players to be signed, and is signing a few on two year deals. The Chief Scout is primarily looking for first team players.\n\nHe acknowledged that maybe the runner-up spots in the Conference should be noted in the honours list in the match-day programme.\n\nThe manager finished on an optimistic note by saying it was his intention to win the title this season.\n\nBulls News would like to thank Martin Watson, secretary of the VP club, for his help in putting together this article.\n\nThis is an edited report from the Official Bristol City Website of this afternoon's friendly at Edgar Street.\n\nSteven Gillespie bagged a brace to help City defeat Hereford United by four goals to nil at Edgar Street this afternoon. The striker helped City into a two-goal lead inside the first 18 minutes and Cole Skuse added a third goal before the interval.\n\nThe second half for long periods was a non-event, that was until Dave Cotterill steered home four minutes from time.\n\nA total of 317 City supporters took up seats inside Edgar Street to watch Marcus Stewart make his debut. And they only had to wait seven minutes for the former Sunderland man's first telling contribution. Cotterill fed Stewart, who in turn found Gillespie unmarked at the back post for the opening goal.\n\nAt the other end a Jon Brady free kick from 25 yards forced City trialist keeper Colin Stewart into a fingertip save. Livewire winger Rob Purdie's jinking run moments later set up Carl Jones in the area, but the trialist's header landed safely into the arms of Stewart.\n\nBut Hereford's short spell of pressure was ended on 18 minutes when Stewart and Gillespie combined well again for City's second goal of the afternoon. A brilliant step over by Stewart allowed his colleague a clear run on goal and the former Liverpool man finished in style.\n\nA Craig Woodman cross three minutes later almost saw Stewart open his City account. However the 32-year-old, who joined on a Bosman free from Sunderland in the summer, fired straight at Craig Mawson from just ten yards out. Gillespie should have celebrating a hat-trick ten minutes before the interval when Stewart's header found him free in the box, but with the goal gaping the 20-year-old blazed high over the crossbar.\n\nGillespie looked desperate to bag a hat-trick and curled a short against the crossbar soon after the restart. The afternoon ended for Stewart and Danny Coles on 67 minutes as Jamie Smith and Luke Ballinger entered the fray. Gillespie sent a long-range effort just wide of the Hereford goal on 76 minutes and was soon replaced by Academy youngster Dean Grubb. Further Academy products Mike Taylor, Jennison Williams and Griff Jones all followed from the bench.\n\nWilliams had an immediate impact, crossing for Cotterill to slot home City's fourth and final goal of the game.\n\nHereford United were defeated 4-0 in their first pre-season friendly at Edgar Street against League One outfit Bristol City. City were 3-0 up at the half time interval thanks to some good attacking play, aided by some sloppy football by the home side.\n\nHereford's side boasted several trialists althought only one, Carl Jones, started the match alongside Craig Stanley. New signings Alex Jeannin and Jon Brady both started with the latter impressing the home crowd on his debut. Mike Parkin, Rob Williams, Rhys Smith and Tony Collins, all on trial, were named on the bench with Dean Beckwith, who made a debut appearance later on in the game.\n\nCarl Jones was at fault for the first goal when he gifted the ball to an opponent in his own half. City's new signing Marcus Stewart was unselfish in front of goal, as he slipped the ball square for his strike partner Steven Gillespie to fire home from six yards after six minutes. At the other end Brady went close with a free kick from twenty five yards, but the 'keeper tipped it over the bar.\n\nThe Bulls played some nice football in stages, but these stages were few and far between as Bristol dominated. Danny Carey-Bertram released a pass for Rob Purdie on the left, who found Adam Stansfield in the box. He picked out the run of Jones with a pin point cross, but the latters header was easily saved from a good position. Jeannin stung the hands of the 'keeper with a thirty yard drive from a free kick but Gillespie doubled the lead for the visitors after eighteen minutes.\n\nGillespie should have made it three just after the half hour mark, but fired over from five yards out but City did notch a third soon after when Stewart picked out the run of Cole Skuse who tucked away from close range having held off the challenge of skipper Tony James.\n\nGillespie again went close to a hat trick just after the restart, but saw his curling effort from outside of the box cannon back off the bar before Brady delivered a perfect cross from the right, but Stansfield headed wide of the near post. Both sides rang the changes in the second half with Graham Turner giving chances to a number of trialists, all of who put in a decent performance.\n\nSubstitute Andy Williams had three efforts, although none really threatened the Bristol goal, in an rather lacklusture second period. Bristol completed the scoring four minutes from the end when sub Jensen Williams crossed for David Cotterill who had a simple task of converting from three yards. Jeannin went close for United right at the death when his inswinging corner was cleared off the goal line, with what appeared to be the use of a defenders arm.\n\nThe Bulls, all in all, were out classed by their higher league opposition, but the game should prove a good work out for the squad. It is clear that a few new signings will be needed in time for the start of the season and the players definately need some more games under their belt in order to gel.\n\nOne Notts County player won't be seen at Edgar Street when Hereford United entertain the East Midlands club for a friendly as he was released this afternoon.\n\nShaun Harrad, 20, had a year remaining on his contract but with opportunities limited and the player eager to be playing first team football at this stage of his career, it was mutually agreed to terminate his contract reports the Official Notts County Website.\n\nThe 6ft 1in Nottingham-born forward signed professional terms with the Magpies after progressing through the Youth System. He made 32 appearances in total for the club.\n\nA loan spell at Tamworth in 2004/05, his first season as a professional, saw him net three goals in three games to push him into the first team, and he followed that up with his first ever goal for the club at Shrewsbury Town towards the end of the campaign.\n\nGraham Turner may have no interest in this particular player but there is little doubt that there will be players like Harrad who will be looking for clubs to further their careers. He is described as a skiful and pacy attacker."
