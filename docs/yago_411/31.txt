QUENTIN Tarantino probably thought his first ever film My Best Friend's Birthday would never see the light of day after it was mostly destroyed in a film lab fire.

But almost 30 years on, what remains of his first efforts has found its way to the Internet.

The famed director co-wrote, produced, directed, edited and starred in the film about a man called Clarence who tries to surprise his pal on his birthday.

It was shot back in 1987, when the Reservoir Dogs director was working at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California.

Roger Avary, who went on to co-write Pulp Fiction with Tarantino, is credited as a cinematographer on the film too.

According to IndieWire, it was shot on 16mm and originally had a run time of 70 minutes before the fire destroyed half of it.

As Tarantino's career has reached greater heights, the remaining 36 minutes has been played at film festivals all over the world.
