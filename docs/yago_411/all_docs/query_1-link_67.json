        "text": "Oscar-winning director-screenwriter Roger Avary -- who co-wrote the ground-breaking Pulp Fiction (1994) besides directing The Rules of Attraction (2002) and Killing Zoe (1994) -- talks at length about the cult movie, and hiring a man who would visit a video store and stank a lot, and would later go on to be known as Quentin Tarantino.\n\nAvary is currently serving as a jury member at the 65th Locarno International Film Festival, Switzerland.\n\nWhen I was young, I picked up a job at a video rental library as I was friends with the owners. There was this one guy who would keep coming to the store. He smelt really bad.\n\nHe knew almost everything about the movies. That annoyed me because I thought I was the one who knew everything about the movies.\n\nHis knowledge was so vast that it was crazy. He was hired by the rental video library.\n\nHis name was Quentin Tarantino.\n\nIn the beginning, we had this sort of rivalry. I don't think we liked each other then. As co-workers in the store, we didn't care about hiring out the big films to people. Instead, the idea was to push rare experimental films to the public and Quentin and I fought over the title that would be on display to attract people.\n\nIt was like a film school. We would put out a movie -- Quentin usually liked the exploitative or Kung fu cinema while I would pick a Kubrick title. We would discuss, debate, and deconstruct a film and every now and then a customer would see this and join in the conversation."
