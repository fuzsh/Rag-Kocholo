        "text": "Watch : Brad Pitt Doesn't Want to Be at the \"Ad Astra\" Premiere\n\nIt's been a huge year for Brad Pitt!\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor, who turns 56 today, is closing out 2019 having produced or starred in some of the most memorable movies of the year, including a few that have already garnered awards buzz.\n\nOn-screen, the performer wowed audiences when he partnered up with fellow A-lister Leonardo Dicapio for Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.\n\nThe star is nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture at the Golden Globes for his portrayal, and the film got some love too with a nod for Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy.\n\nThat wasn't the only time the celebrity graced the silver screen, either. Pitt also starred in Ad Astra, a drama set in outer space that received wide praise from critics.\n\nWhile we love the actor for his abilities to embody any character, he's also a bonafide producer, with his company Plan B Entertainment having produced The Last Black Man in San Francisco, which saw its debut at Sundance, and The King starring Timothée Chalamet.\n\nPitt has been influential in front of and behind the camera for nearly three decades and has received wide recognition for his work.\n\nIn fact, on Thursday, the Producer's Guild of America announced that Pitt, along with his producing partners Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, will be receiving the David O. Selznick Achievement Award at the organization's award ceremony this upcoming January.\n\nTo celebrate one of our favorite actors, and arguably one of the last true movie stars, we've rounded up some of his best roles to date.\n\nCheck out the many characters Pitt has played and then sound off on which is your favorite!\n\nPoll\n\nBrad Pitt's Best Roles\n\nWhich of Brad Pitt's roles is your favorite?\n\nJ.D. in <i>Thelma & Louise</i>\n\nJ.D. in Thelma & Louise\n\n1.9 %\n\nFloyd in <i>True Romance</i>\n\nFloyd in True Romance\n\n1 %\n\nLouis de Pointe du Lac in <i>Interview with the Vampire</i>\n\nLouis de Pointe du Lac in Interview with the Vampire\n\n2.9 %\n\nDetective David Mills in <i>Se7en</i>\n\nDetective David Mills in Se7en\n\n4.8 %\n\nJeffrey Goines in <i>12 Monkeys</i>\n\nJeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys\n\n4.8 %\n\nTyler Durden in <i>Fight Club</i>\n\nTyler Durden in Fight Club\n\n20 %\n\nWill Colbert in <i>Friends</i>\n\nWill Colbert in Friends\n\n3.8 %\n\n\"Rusty\" Ryan in the <i>Ocean's</i> franchise\n\n\"Rusty\" Ryan in the Ocean's franchise\n\n12.4 %\n\nAchilles in <i>Troy</i>\n\nAchilles in Troy\n\n9.5 %\n\nJohn Smith in <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i>\n\nJohn Smith in Mr. & Mrs. Smith\n\n12.4 %\n\nAldo Raine in <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>\n\nAldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds\n\n3.8 %\n\nBilly Beane in <i>Moneyball</i>\n\nBilly Beane in Moneyball\n\n3.8 %\n\nGerry Lane in <i>World War Z</i>\n\nGerry Lane in World War Z\n\n1.9 %\n\nDon \"Wardaddy\" Collier in <i>Fury</i>\n\nDon \"Wardaddy\" Collier in Fury\n\n1 %\n\nBen Ricket in <i>The Big Short</i>\n\nBen Ricket in The Big Short\n\n1 %\n\nCliff Booth in <i>Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood</i>\n\nCliff Booth in Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\n\n13.3 %\n\nRoy McBride in <i>Ad Astra</i>\n\nRoy McBride in Ad Astra\n\n1.9 %"
