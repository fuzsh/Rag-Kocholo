        "meta_description": "When you think about when you first heard the name âQuentin Tarantinoâ you probably think of âPulp Fiction.â The 1994 film was a huge success and immensely influential. Itâs not where it all started for Tarantino, though. Before âPulp Fiction,â Tarantino made another film steeped in genre with âReservoir Dogs.â Without âReservoir Dogs,â we donât get âPulp Fiction,â which means we donât get âKill Bill,â âOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodâ or whatever Quentin has left before his purported self-imposed retirement. Here are some facts about the movie that put the young, upstart director on the map before he was put âon the map.â",

        "text": "âReservoir Dogsâ is Only Sort of Tarantinoâs Debut Film\n\nOstensibly âReservoir Dogsâ marked Tarantinoâs debut as a feature filmmaker. Thatâs technically true, but it almost wasnât. When he was still working at a video store in California he co-wrote, co-produced, and director a 1987 amateur film called âMy Best Friendâs Birthday.â It was originally 70 minutes, which would have made it a feature-length film. However, a fire caused a bunch of the film to be lost, and what was left is a spliced-together short film thatâs 36 minutes long.\n\nThis Was Almost Another Amateur Movie\n\nThe original plan for âReservoir Dogsâ was for it to be another of Tarantinoâs films made on a whim. His plan was to make it a 16mm black-and-white movie with less ambition, and a budget of only $30,000 dollars. It was just going to be made with his friends, including Lawrence Bender, who ended up producing âReservoir Dogs.â\n\nHarvey Keitel Was Vital to the Film\n\nYou never know what chain of events will occur in a filmâs production. Bender gave a copy of Tarantinoâs script to his acting teacher. That teacher gave it to their wife, and their wife gave it to Harvey Keitel. Keitel, an established actor, signed on as a co-producer, resulting in a budget somewhere between $1.2 and $3 million.\n\nShockingly, Tarantino Had Some Movie Influences\n\nTarantino is known for his love of film, and for using a lot of influences, homages, and what have you in his moviemaking. He had a few influences for âReservoir Dogs,â the primary of which was âKansas City Confidential.â\n\nThe Naming Convention of the Film is Also a Reference\n\nThe crew that puts together the robbery in the film doesnât use their actual names. Instead, they are referenced by colors, such as Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Green. This is directly lifted from the original âThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three,â where the criminals do the same thing.\n\nOne Member of the Cast Knew the Lay of the Land\n\nEddie Bunker plays âMr. Blueâ in the movie. He had a few notable movies under his belt and wrote on the films âStraight Timeâ and âRunaway Train.â That was a bit of a second career for Bunker. In his youth, he was repeatedly jailed for crimes, including robbery.\n\nAnd Yet Bunker Was Not the Problem on Set\n\nLawrence Tierney had a lengthy career in Hollywood. Read any stories on him and you begin to wonder why. Tierney was often drunk and violent, and he was arrested dozens of times in his life. He was also immensely difficult on set, and Tarantino said that he and Tierney got into a physical altercation. Also, while filming âReservoir Dogsâ the actor was arrested again. Why? Because he got drunk and shot at his nephew.\n\nWe Donât Know What the Title Means\n\nâReservoir Dogsâ is certainly an evocative title, but what does it mean? Well, we canât tell you, mostly because Quentin wonât tell us. People have their theories online, but Tarantino has never given an explicit answer, and it was not an existing phrase.\n\nOne of the Most Famous Names in the Movie is Just a Voice\n\nTarantino makes use of diegetic sound in the film, which is to say the music comes from sources within the film. This includes radios tuned into K-Billyâs âSounds of the Seventies.â We hear the DJ do their patter here and there, and you might know the voice. The DJ is none other than standup Steven Wright.\n\nMr. Blonde is Related to Another Tarantino Character\n\nMr. Blondeâs psychopathic tendency to violence causes a lot of problems during the movie, but heâs also one of the members of the crew whose name we know. Blonde is Vic Vega, and that last name may be familiar. Vic is the brother of Vincent Vegas, John Travoltaâs character from âPulp Fiction.â\n\nThere are Multiple Reasons We Donât See the Heist\n\nNotably, âReservoir Dogsâ is a crime film where we donât see the crime at the center of the story. The heist happens off-screen, and we only see the lead-up and the aftermath. Tarantino has said that he thought of stories like âGlengarry Glen Rossâ which also features a robbery we donât see. He wanted it to be clear the film was about other things. Also, Quentin has also admitted that not showing the heist made the movie cheaper to do and kept it on budget.\n\nâReservoir Dogsâ Had a Successful Sundance\n\nYouâll hear about a movie screening at the Sundance Film Festival and being so well-received that it gets picks up on a big deal. âReservoir Dogsâ was one of the first notable success stories. It became the talk of the town and got picked up by Miramax which got the movie a wide release. The movie made $2.8 million at the North American box office but did even better in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Film Got a Lot of Walkouts\n\nThe violence of âReservoir Dogsâ can be pretty grim, even if one of the most upsetting things happens just off-screen. This led to walkouts, including a purported 15 at a screening at the Sitges Film Festival. Two of the people who walked out allegedly were Wes Craven and Rick Baker, known for their work in horror movies. That could be Tarantino embellishing for the sake of telling a story, but we do believe there were definitely plenty of walkouts.\n\nA Lot of the Costuming Came From the Crew\n\nThere was not exactly a real costume budget on âReservoir Dogs.â A lot of the clothing worn by the characters was from the personal wardrobe of the actors. This includes the tracksuit that Chris Pennâs Nice Guy Eddie wears.\n\nThe Warehouse Was an Old Mortuary\n\nMuch of the film takes place in a big, empty warehouse, in part because they couldnât afford much in the way of set rental. In fact, Mr. Orangeâs apartment was staged upstairs in the warehouse. That warehouse had previously been a mortuary, fitting for a set that featured a few deaths.\n\nTarantino Seeded a Future Film in the Movie\n\nOn the radio, you might hear an ad for Jack Rabbit Slimâs. You later see Jack Rabbit Slimâs in âPulp Fiction.â Itâs the â50s-themed restaurant Vincent and Mia go to for expensive milkshakes (that are worth it) and Steve Buscemi as a waiter dressed like Buddy Holly.\n\nA Lot of Money Went into Securing One Song\n\nTarantino spent the entirety of his soundtrack budget on one song: âStuck in the Middle with Youâ by Stealers Wheel. Itâs vital to the scene it is featured in, so we can see that. The director got his song, and Stealers Wheel forever became associated with ear violence.\n\nMadonna Disagrees with the Movieâs Take on âLike a Virginâ\n\nIn classic Tarantino fashion, the movie begins with the crew having breakfast while Mr. Brown, aka Tarantino himself, expounds graphically on what he believes Madonnaâs âLike a Virginâ is about. While Madonna liked the film, she disagreed with the ribald assessment of her hit. She reportedly sent Tarantino an autographed copy of her album which included a line that points out her song is about love; not what Mr. Brown thinks it is.\n\nAll That Blood Caused Problems for Tim Roth\n\nPoor Mr. Orange spends the bulk of the movie in a pool of his own blood after being shot during the heist. Tim Rothâs character is quite bloody, and in fact, a paramedic onset was used to make sure the amount of blood he was losing was consistent and accurate. And yet, there were still complications. The fake blood repeatedly dried out during films, leaving Roth to be peeled off the ground, which was a difficult process.\n\nGET TICKETS\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTo learn more;\n\nhttps://www.psucollegian.com/culture_lifestyle/why-reservoir-dogs-is-quentin-tarantino-s-best-movie-blog/article_0b3e5c96-a0f2-11ed-a13a-1b83cd821238.html\n\nhttps://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/20_facts_you_might_not_know_about_reservoir_dogs_091923/s1__35357441#slide_12"
