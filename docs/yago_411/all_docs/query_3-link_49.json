        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock (3)\n\nTaylor Swift's Celebrity BFFs Through the Years\n\nSince becoming a global superstar, Taylor Swift has amassed quite the crew of celebrity friends. The Grammy winner aligned herself with the likes of Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid and Karlie Kloss in the early 2010s. That exclusive squad eventually evolved to a smaller, tight-knit group. “In my 20s I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend,” Swift wrote in a May 2019 Elle essay. “So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone.” Swift noted the importance of “learning the difference between lifelong friendships” and “situationships,\" explaining, “It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships.” She realized true friends were “the ones who stuck around” through highs and lows. “I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I'm #canceled,” she wrote. “They were there in the worst times and they’re here now.” Scroll down to see Swift’s A-list BFFs through the years!\n\nCredit: Jeff Vespa/WireImage\n\nJessica Chastain\n\nThe pair were spotted smiling together at the 2014 Golden Globes, and then the Oscar winner was seen rocking out at Swift's Eras Tour in Mexico City in 2023.\n\n“She’s actually really sweet … the best, it’s crazy,” Chastain said of Swift during a December 2023 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “I met her in 2011 at the Met Ball, and we were both — it was, like, the first year I was invited to the Met Ball. First year I had movies out and we were both sitting next to each other.” Chastain had “just gone through a breakup” and chatted with Swift about the split.\n\n“We went and danced together. It was such a fun night,” the actress shared. “Then, the next day, I had an e-mail from iTunes that said, ‘Taylor Swift,’ whatever. I just thought it was a Taylor Swift album. She had made me a breakup playlist that she sent me.” Chastain called the gesture “the sweetest thing.”\n\nCredit: Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images for MTV\n\nIce Spice\n\nIce Spice appeared on the May 2023 remix of Swift’s song “Karma” and performed the song live with her at The East Rutherford, New Jersey, Eras Tour stop that month. The duo first connected after Ice Spice’s team heard her praising Swift’s 2020 documentary Miss Americana.\n\n“What I took away from Taylor’s documentary is you really do need to work hard, and not everything is going to be as easy as it seems,” Ice Spice told Variety for a September 2023 profile on her. “My manager heard me talking about that and had reached out to her team, and then they had a song for me.”\n\nSwift also contributed to the piece, telling Variety via email, “I relate to Ice in many ways, but I think her dedication and focus is what blew me away from the very start. She’s extremely professional without being cold. Playful and fun without ever taking her eye off the prize. She knows what is and isn’t ‘her’ and sets those boundaries with grace. She studies the industry and other artists’ careers but is very clear about charting her own definitive, original path. It’s her ability to carefully find that balance that impresses the hell out of me.”\n\nThe two musicians became friends after their collaboration. They were seen dancing, chatting and laughing together at the September 2023 MTV Video Music Awards and watched the Kansas City Chiefs win the February 2024 Super Bowl together from the same VIP box.\n\nSome have theorized that Swift and Ice Spice’s friendship isn’t genuine, citing the “Karma” remix coinciding with Swift’s former flame Matty Healy getting heat for making disparaging remarks about Ice Spice. However, Ice Spice shut down the speculation during a July 2024 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\n“[It’s] so rude to me, [because] why would she not want to be my friend?” Spice said of those who think her friendship with Swift is fake. “Taylor f—ks with me. She’s so funny. I think our personalities mesh really well.”\n\nThe “Princess Diana” singer added that she “never really cared” about the Healy controversy and said “he apologized multiple times.”\n\nCredit: James Devaney/GC Images\n\nMiles and Keleigh Teller\n\nMiles and Keleigh, who tied the knot in 2019, both appeared in the November 2021 music video for Swift’s Red (Taylor’s Version) vault track “I Bet You Think About Me,” which was directed by Blake Lively.\n\nMiles portrayed a groom haunted by memories of Swift, the ex he let get away, on his wedding day. Keleigh played his wife and mouthed “thank you” when Swift presented her with a gift box containing a red scarf, an iconic piece of Swiftie lore from the Red song “All Too Well.”\n\n“So grateful for @Miles_Teller for being the greatest dance partner and friend to me,” Swift wrote via social media after the video’s release. “And @keleighteller, who is the coolest living human on planet earth. The bride was willing to risk it all 🥰🧣.”\n\nMiles later revealed that his wife had gotten emotional on the set of the project.\n\n\"When we were shooting the music video, Taylor played for Keleigh the ‘All Too Well (10 Minute Version)' for the first time,\" he told E! News in July 2022. \"Keleigh was just looking at Taylor in her wedding dress and Taylor and I dancing while she was listening to ‘All Too Well,' the new one, and she was just bawling her eyes out.\"\n\nIn December 2023, Swift was spotted in Manhattan with Miles, Keleigh and Selena Gomez on the eve of her 34th birthday.\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nJack Antonoff\n\nThe duo seemingly met at the 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and they began their prolific songwriting relationship in 2013 with the track \"Sweeter Than Fiction\" (written for the movie The One). Antonoff, who was dating Swift's pal Lena Dunham at the time, went on to write three songs with Swift for her album 1989, including the hit \"Out of the Woods.\" He has worked on every subsequent Swift album, including her re-recordings.\n\nAntonoff's two Album of the Year Grammy Awards were won for Swift's 1989 and Folklore.\n\n“@taylorswift , from 1989 to here ... goddmann. you are the one who let me produce records first,\" Antonoff wrote via Instagram in a tribute to Swift after scoring their Folklore Grammy in 2021. \"Before you i just “wasn’t a producer” according to the herbs. i just wasnt let in that room. then i met you, we made out of the woods and you said, “that’s the version” and that changed my life right there.\"\n\nHe later appeared in her 2022 music video for \"Bejeweled\" and made a May 2023 appearance at the Eras Tour as a guest performer.\n\nSwift was spotted at his New Jersey wedding to Margaret Qualley in August 2023.\n\nCredit: Christopher Peterson / SplashNews.com; Gregory Pace/Shutterstock\n\nSuki Waterhouse\n\nThe Daisy Jones and the Six actress has been close with Swift since the mid-2000s. In October 2016, Waterhouse was spotted among Swift’s squad going to a Kings of Leon concert. Us confirmed in June 2019 that Swift and Waterhouse went on a double date with Joe Alwyn and Robert Pattinson in Hollywood. (Swift and Alwyn called it quits in April 2023.)\n\nIn August 2023, Swift gushed over Waterhouse’s talent as a singer and sang her praises for being a loyal friend. \"Suki has always seemed like she stepped out of a time machine. Her music is so raw and hopelessly romantic because that's how she moves through the world,” Swift told Ssence. \"When we hang out, I often come away wondering how someone can be simultaneously spontaneous and free — and also preternaturally wise. She is the wildest person I know who I would also trust to keep any secret.\"\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for iHeartRadio\n\nPhoebe Bridgers\n\nBridgers was featured on the song \"Nothing New\" from Swift's rerecorded album Red (Taylor's Version), which was released in November 2021.\n\n“I think that the specificity of Phoebe’s lyrics and the vulnerability she expresses in her voice when she delivers them is what makes her music so deeply impactful and moving for me as a fan,” the \"Maroon\" musician told the Los Angeles Times for its April 2022 profile of Bridgers, who was one of many artists opening for Swift on her Eras tour.\n\nIn March 2023, the \"Motion Sickness\" singer presented Swift with the Innovator Award at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. In her introduction, Bridgers gushed about her fellow songwriter's authenticity.\n\n\"Taylor has always told the truth. She’s written songs from exactly where she is. Her music shifted genre in the same way life does —in the same way being 16 is totally incomparable to being 18, 22, 25, 28. I’m grateful that I’ve grown up in a world with Taylor Swift in it. Or, ‘The World (Taylor’s Version),'\" she said.\n\nCredit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nDylan O'Brien\n\nThe Teen Wolf alum was Swift's \"first choice\" to star in the \"All Too Well\" music video, and the pair formed a tight bond as they worked on the project together. \"I had a feeling he would be great at ad libbing and adding nuance to his character, which enriched the story tenfold,\" the \"Nothing New\" singer wrote in an email to Bustle in March 2022. \"He absolutely blew me away and I feel really lucky that I gained such a great friend from the experience too.\"\n\nO'Brien was equally effusive about his new BFF, praising her for allowing him and costar Sadie Sink to contribute to the creative process with the dramatic post-dinner party argument. \"For someone who’s that meticulous, she’s so trusting. ... Everything was planned to be to music,\" he told the outlet. \"But then when we played out that scene [with dialogue]. [Taylor] immediately marched over and was just like, ‘This is it. I’m going to play this in the video.’ The confidence to just identify that in the moment on set and take in what we were bringing to it [shows how] she’s so sound with relationships and her instincts.\"\n\nThe \"All Too Well\" short film star made a subtle appearance on Swift’s Midnights album in October 2022. In the song, “Question…” clapping can be heard, and the album's credits reveal that O’Brien, Swift’s brother Austin, music producer Jack Antonoff and his sister Rachel proves the sound effect. The actor also played the drums on the track “Snow on the Beach.”\n\nCredit: Instar (2)\n\nZoë Kravitz\n\nWhile filming The Batman in London amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Kravitz and Swift were in the same pandemic pod. NYT Magazine editor Jake Silverstein later told Women's Wear Daily that Taylor helped Kravitz with a virtual photoshoot.\n\n\"Zoe was being very strict about it anyway because she's shooting a movie,\" Silverstein said. \"And Taylor Swift was in her pod and willing to assist.\"\n\nWhile the singer got a \"special thanks\" shout-out in the December 2021 issue, she also gave Kravitz's performance her approval in March 2022 during the movie's opening weekend.\n\n\"@zoeIsabellaKravitz IS THE CATWOMAN OF DREAMS,\" Swift proclaimed via her Instagram Story alongside a photo of Kravitz as Catwoman on a movie theater screen. \"The Batman was PHENOMENAL!!!\"\n\nIn October 2022, it was revealed that The Batman star cowrote and provided background vocals on Swift’s opening track, “Lavender Haze.”\n\nThe pair were seen hanging out in New Jersey at Jack Antonoff and Margaret Qualley's rehearsal dinner in August 2023.\n\nCredit: Richard Young/Shutterstock\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nThe “Déjà Vu” singer, who describes herself as a Swift “fangirl for life,” sparked a friendship with the Grammy winner after dropping her first single, “Drivers License,” in January 2021. After hearing the track, Swift wrote Rodrigo a letter and sent her one of her rings as a gift.\n\n\"I don't want to divulge too much because it's really sweet and personal, but she talks a lot about how, I think, you make your own luck in the world,\" the Bizaardvark alum told Billboard in its May 2021 cover story. \"I don't know, she put it so eloquently, and when I say it now ... it's not as cool.”\n\nRodrigo later gushed about Swift after meeting her at the 2021 BRIT Awards in May. \"It's so nice to be welcomed into the music industry and so great to be supportive of other women,\" she told Variety in August 2021.\n\nCredit: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nCamila Cabello\n\nSwift has been a good friend to the former Fifth Harmony member over the years, throwing her an 18th birthday party and later inviting her to serve as an opening act on the Reputation tour.\n\nIn August 2021, Cabello revealed that she thought of Swift as her \"fabulous godmother\" after her guidance helped her find her way professionally.\n\n\"I started out and I was a teenager when I met her, like 18 or something, and she always gave me great advice,\" the \"Havana\" singer told Entertainment Tonight at the time. \"She was always really supportive of me and really nurturing and sweet. So in the industry, I would say her.\""
