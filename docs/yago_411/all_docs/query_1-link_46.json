        "text": "List compiled by Eddie on 3/06/2016\n\nWith the recent release of The Hateful Eight we’ve now been treated to (aptly) eight Quentin Tarantino films that have all in their unique ways entertained us, shocked us and showcased to us the gift QT has for his craft as both a director and a writer.\n\nOver the course of 8 feature length films, a couple of guest directing gigs and even a couple of episodes of C.S.I and a singular E.R venture, QT has stamped his voice onto the industry with his original way with both the written word and skill behind the camera, not to mention his ability to draw performances out of struggling or no named actors (here’s looking at you John Travolta).\n\nIt could be argued that QT has never made an irremediably bad film and while there were suggestions that the highly intelligent director (whose I.Q rates well above average) and one time video story employee would stop making feature films after his 10th movie, there’s hope that for many years yet this original talent will continue to work in the industry that needs him more than ever.\n\nFor consistency sake, guest directing jobs that QT has worked on in the films Sin City and Four Rooms are not included in the below list while his somewhat mysterious first feature from 1987 that was a D.I.Y effort, My Best Friends Birthday has also been excluded.\n\nHappy reading and happy watching!\n\n8. Death Proof (2007)\n\nA homage to old school Grindhouse, Death Proof (which was a part of the Grindhouse double bill experiment with Robert Rodriguez) is a light yet enjoyable film that was also QT’s biggest Box Office and critical flop. There’s small moments of genuine brilliance here but only the most dedicated of QT fans could defend Death Proof when compared to his filmography overall.\n\nBare feet shown – Yes\n\n7. Jackie Brown (1997)\n\nHow does one follow up the 1 and 2 double hit of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, if you’re Tarantino it’s with this Pam Grier lead thriller that also features one of Tarantino’s most star studded cast’s. Reception upon release for Jackie Brown was somewhat muted but in the proceeding years that’ve followed it’s found itself a small yet vocal fan base.\n\nBare feet shown – Yes\n\n6. The Hateful Eight (2015)\n\nA love letter to westerns of old, The Hateful Eight is arguably Tarantino’s most dialogue heavy and dialogue focused feature that spreads itself over 5 chapters. A majority of these chapters are fantastic but as the run time continues to tick and the narrative drives itself into a corner, The Hateful Eight becomes an enjoyable if somewhat lacking entry into the directors loaded canon.\n\nBare feet shown – No\n\n5. Kill Bill: Vol 1 + 2 (2003/2004)\n\nArguments may be made as to why the Kill Bill volumes aren’t separated on this list, Kill Bill was made and directed by Tarantino as one 4 hour long film that was then split for financial reasons by the Weinstein’s. Kill Bill which takes many of its ideas and even scenarios from the legends of Japanese cinema, is a violent tale of revenge and samurai swords that is both gleefully fun and highly intense. Style over substance for sure, the Kill Bill adventure is a highly enjoyable one.\n\nBare feet shown – Yes\n\n4. Reservoir Dogs (1992)\n\nWho would’ve thought that a low budget movie set almost entirely within an abandoned warehouse and where most of the interesting scenarios play out off screen would’ve launched the career of one of the modern era’s greatest filmmakers? Gathering what would’ve been then a dream cast, Tarantino’s feature length debut showcases what’s best about the filmmaker, scripting, characters and stories and to this day this low budget grunge filled crime film is a real blast.\n\nBare feet shown – No\n\n3. Inglorious Basterds (2009)\n\nQT does World War 2 and boy does he do it well. Introducing the world to Christoph Waltz, a scalp loving Brad Pitt and an alternative ending to the terrible war, Inglorious is an epic war time yarn that is brutal and bloody but also a heck of a lot of fun.\n\nBare feet shown – Yes\n\n2. Django Unchained (2012)\n\nA film that is both brutal and funny and also far too close to home for some, Django Unchained saw QT team up with Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz to great effect. Django, which was a huge box office and critical success, saw QT at his best since his early beginnings and one can only hope that he acts upon his desire to direct three Western films.\n\nBare feet shown – Yes\n\n1. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nLittle needs to be said of Pulp Fiction. QT (and no doubt Roger Avary) created the rare type of film that has seeped into pulp culture of all kinds as both a lauded and loved film from critics and audiences alike. Reviving the career of John Travolta and in some ways Samuel L. Jackson, creating a unique McGuffin filled narrative and giving airplay to gimps the world over, Pulp Fiction is an out and out Palme d’Or winning masterpiece of the likes we will perhaps never see again.\n\nBare feet shown – Yes\n\nHow does list compare to your thoughts? Perhaps there’s another #1 on your mind or is there an underrated gem in Tarantino’s filmography? If so we’d love to hear from you in the comments below!\n\nFor The Movie Guy’s other director lists see below\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nDario Argento\n\nTerrence Malick\n\nRidley Scott\n\nThe Coen Brothers\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nJohn Carpenter\n\nTim Burton"
