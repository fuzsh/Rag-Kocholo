        "text": "Over the years, Taylor Swift has built wholesome (and honestly, aspirational) friendships with other girlies in the entertainment industry—see: Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid, Emma Stone, Blake Lively, the Haim sisters, Sabrina Carpenter, BEYONCÉ. The list of her high-profile besties is truly the gift that keeps giving. Oh, and we obviously can’t forget how her infamous squad continuously made headlines in the 2010s. In conclusion: We want in on the friendship bracelet making, tysm.\n\nBut before Taylor became a Grammy winner, pop culture icon, billionaire, etc., she and a redhead named Abigail Anderson became best friends when they were in high school. Day One Swifties know that Tay and Abigail go *way* back and that she was the ~muse~ behind the Fearless track, “Fifteen.” And, in case you needed proof, here’s a MySpace-era digi cam pic of these two:\n\nIt turns out that the duo is still going strong in our good year 2024, and we simply love to see it. If you want to take a trip down memory lane and relive Taylor and Abigail’s best friendship moments from the past 20 years (!!!), keep on scrolling for the sweetness.\n\nCirca 2004\n\nTaylor and Abigail met during English class when they were bbs at Hendersonville High School in Nashville, Tennessee. According to Abigail, they bonded over Shakespeare (ya know, as one does).\n\n“We were the ones in the back of the class saying negative things about Romeo and Juliet because we were so bitter toward that emotion at the time. We just really connected…and ever since then we have been inseparable,” Abigail said when she surprised Taylor on The Ellen Show (more on that later).\n\nAlso, just going to leave you with this:\n\nMarch 3, 2008\n\nTaylor dropped the music video for “I’m Only Me When I’m With You,” aka a super-sweet song about friendship, which features homemade videos with her family and Abigail.\n\nMarch 14, 2008\n\nThe music video for Taylor’s song “Picture to Burn” is released, and of course, Abigail makes a cameo in the *iconic* opening scene where they’re parked outside Taylor’s ex-boyfriend’s house. (Can anyone else recite this entire scene? Just me?)\n\nJune 12, 2008\n\nTaylor attended prom with a superfan in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for MTV’s Once Upon a Prom special. Of course, Abigail was there to help her prep for the big night since she was on tour and didn’t go to her actual high school prom. According to People, the pair went on a double date with the fan and his best friend.\n\nA fellow T. Swift historian uploaded the entire thing to YouTube, for our viewing pleasure:\n\nNovember 11, 2008\n\nTaylor’s sophomore album, Fearless, is released and features a song called “Fifteen” that was inspired by Abigail with lyrics like:\n\n“You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail and soon enough you’re best friends / Laughing at the other girls who they think they’re so cool. We’ll be out of here as soon as we can.”\n\nAbigail appeared in the music video for the song too.\n\nThe day the album was released, Taylor made an appearance on The Ellen Show to promote it, and she was not only surprised by her celeb crush at the time, Justin Timberlake, but also by her childhood bestie, Abigail:\n\nMay 15, 2009\n\nDuring her interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Tay gushed about her friendship with Abigail, saying, “But my best friend, Abigail, we met when I was 15. First day of school freshman year, we sat next to each other in English. She wanted to be a swimmer and go off on a college scholarship for swimming and I wanted to be a singer. Now she’s off at Kansas on a swimming scholarship and I’m singing.”\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes Q&A on Oprah’s website, Taylor also dished that her perfect day off would be one where she pays a visit to Abigail at Kansas University. “I love going to go visit her. It’s this little college town and it’s kind of fun, because you always wonder about the path you didn’t take, and the path I didn’t take was going to college. So, when I have days off, I like to visit Abigail and experience college without having to take tests and study,” Taylor said in the clip.\n\nCirca 2010\n\nNot sure when this was exactly, but these webcam selfies are giving big Speak Now vibes and I felt compelled to share:\n\nNovember 2, 2012\n\nAbigail officially joins Instagram! Some of her first posts? Just a few grainy selfies with Taylor at the CMA Awards:\n\nDecember 7, 2012\n\nAbigail seemed to be hanging out with Taylor as she posted a pic of her equally famous cat, Meredith.\n\nAugust 6, 2013\n\nThe filter? The high exposure? The kissy faces? I’m considering this post a peak Instagram artifact:\n\nAugust 10, 2013\n\nAbigail posts a cute pic from her boat day with Tay:\n\nDecember 13, 2013\n\nAbigail wishes Taylor a happy birthday on Instagram, writing, “Happy 24th birthday you beautiful girl! I love you and miss you dearly! 🎈@taylorswift #comehometomesoooon.”\n\nDecember 31, 2013\n\nIt looks like Taylor did indeed come home to Abigail soon, because they celebrated New Year’s together and seemingly soft-launched the 1989 era with this polaroid:\n\nApril 6, 2014\n\nTaylor sent Abigail a homemade card for her 24th birthday, writing, “Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Abigail whose spirit was as fiery as her hair. She never did anything the way they told her to, fell hopelessly in love, and turned 24 without a single regret. Happy birthday. Love, Taylor.”\n\n“Words cannot describe how grateful I am for your friendship (and the absolutely breathtaking package of presents I just received). You truly are the most wonderful human being. From the bottom of my heart...thank you @taylorswift I love you,” Abigail wrote in her caption.\n\nJuly 26, 2014\n\nThe duo spent a day out in nature, complete with Friends references:\n\nOctober 2, 2014\n\n“We need a prop. I’ll grab a cat,” Taylor allegedly said before posing for this selfie with Abigail and Olivia.\n\nOctober 28, 2014\n\nAbigail celebrates the release of 1989, writing, “On behalf of all the ears across the world—Thank you for the most beautiful collaboration of magic and meaning. It’s a privilege to watch this all unfold. Here’s to your best one yet, @taylorswift 🎉 #1989 #YouCanHearItInTheSilence.”\n\nNovember 2, 2014\n\nA few days later, she and Lily Aldridge apparently bought a ton of copies of the album from Target, and of course, it was documented:\n\nDecember 13, 2014\n\nAbigail attends Taylor’s star-studded 25th birthday party in NYC, per these Insta posts:\n\nDecember 31, 2014\n\nAccording to these snaps, the BFFs celebrated New Year’s together for the second year in a row.\n\nFebruary 7, 2015\n\nThe duo attended a pre-Grammy gala with Taylor’s other gal pals, Haim.\n\nFebruary 8, 2015\n\nThe very next day, Abigail was Taylor’s date to the Grammys. They also blessed us with these bestie pics:\n\nFebruary 19, 2015\n\nAbigail posts a clip of Taylor blow-drying Olivia because she jumped into the bathtub. Just cat-mom things!\n\nApril 5, 2015\n\nAbigail seemingly celebrates her 25th birthday/Easter with Taylor and a buncha other people:\n\nAaaand she even received a surprise performance from Dashboard Confessional’s Chris Carrabba. Legendary.\n\nSeptember 27, 2015\n\nAbigail attended Taylor’s 1989 World Tour and posted this epic video of her “I Knew You Were Trouble” performance. “‘Is that a world tour...or your girls tour?’ #Both #PowerStance #FlipsHairWalksAway @taylorswift,” she wrote in her caption.\n\nJuly 4, 2016\n\nNaturally, Abigail was in attendance at Taylor’s iconic Fourth of July party in Rhode Island.\n\nJuly 5, 2016\n\nThe next day, the best friends tore up some Spice Girls karaoke alongside the Haim sisters and Kesha.\n\nJuly 19, 2016\n\nAmid Taylor’s infamous public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Abigail posted some tweets in the singer’s defense. Per Entertainment Tonight, she had been thinking of the couple’s daughter, North West, during the drama as she wrote:\n\n“Lord, hear my prayers.…I pray God helps your daughter understand, that despite how many times she’ll hear daddy reference all women as ‘bitches,’ she isn’t one,” she wrote on Monday. “I pray she understands her father actually IS faithful to her mother, despite all the adulterous comments she will hear her father making.…I pray that she will understand ‘adultery and bitches’ are just daddy’s form of art and not to worry because not every man thinks like him.”\n\nShe reportedly deleted the tweets above and explained, “For the record, I usually delete my tweets once the death threats start rolling in. Nothing more or less than that. #MovingOn.”\n\nDecember 13, 2016\n\nAbigail wished Taylor a happy birthday with another snap from her Fourth of July celebration, writing, “Wishing the happiest of birthdays to this girl!🎈Thank you for all the light you shine, @taylorswift ✨ Here’s to taking your arm paint just as serious for the next 27 years! 🎂.”\n\nDecember 24, 2016\n\nTaylor and Abigail celebrated Christmas together, and it might have also sparked the beginning of Tay’s signature blue-tinted photo filter...\n\nOctober 4, 2017\n\nWhile Taylor was mainly ~off-the-grid~ ahead of her Reputation era, she “came out of hiding” to be a bridesmaid in Abigail’s wedding. According to People, the wedding was held in Martha’s Vineyard. A source on the scene told the outlet, “She looked gorgeous. She had dark-red lips and carried her friend’s train as they went into the church. Security asked the crowd not to rush her.”\n\nAnother bridesmaid also posted a ton of pics including Tay:\n\nOctober 26, 2017\n\nAbigail teases Reputation with this silly photo bomb:\n\nAugust 26, 2018\n\nAbigail attended the Reputation Stadium Tour in Nashville, where she was spotted dancing with Karlie Kloss and her sisters.\n\nAbigail also posted a pic of Taylor’s “Dress” performance on Instagram, writing, “I’ve never been more inspired by any one person in my entire life.

I am completely inspired by everything that is you, @taylorswift 💕Congrats, buddy.”\n\nDecember 13, 2019\n\nTaylor turned 30, and of course, Abigail was at her birthday party!\n\nJanuary 31, 2020\n\nTaylor’s Netflix doc, Miss Americana, is released and features this relatable convo between her and Abigail:\n\nWatch 'Miss Americana' on Netflix\n\nMay 3, 2023\n\nAbigail shared a sweet selfie with Taylor, where they’re seen laughing while lying down. “‘Cause when you’re… 33 🦊,” she cheekily captioned the post, referencing the lyrics to “Fifteen.”\n\nJuly 2, 2023\n\nAbigail supported Taylor at the Eras Tour in Nashville! Tay played “Fifteen” as one of the surprise songs and dedicated it to her “beautiful redheaded high school best friend.” 🥹\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nAbigail subtly gave her stamp of approval for Taylor’s budding romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.
