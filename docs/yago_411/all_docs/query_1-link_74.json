        "text": "While a critic is just that, a filmmaker is always a student to the arts, which means they’re always learning.\n\nWith that said, I think Quentin Tarantino is perfectly in the right in sharing his thoughts on a film that he had no part in.\n\nYesterday the Internet exploded when Tarantino criticized David Robert Mitchell‘s modern horror masterpiece, It Follows.\n\nI mean, Tarantino tore the movie apart. And as good as It Follows was, he’s not wrong. Still, Mitchell was irked enough by Tarantino’s critical analysis that he tweeted out the perfect response…\n\nNow, let’s be clear, Mitchell is playing it cool. Yet, if Tarantino is allowed to publicly shame his movie, I think Mitchell should do the same back at him. Seriously, Mitchell should go off and shove it right up Tarantino’s you-know-what. If Tarantino can dish it, he better be able to take it, no?\n\nIt’s also important to note that, as critical as Tarantino was, he had previously stated that he “really liked It Follows.”\n\nShit, I acknowledge the film’s issues in my review and still gave it a perfect score. Oxymoron? Maybe.\n\nI think the biggest no-no here is that Tarantino is using a platform to shit on a lesser known filmmaker’s work. He may be ethically in-bounds, but I still think it’s shitty of him…\n\nThoughts?"
