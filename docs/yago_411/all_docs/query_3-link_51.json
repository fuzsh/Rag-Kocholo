        "text": "Dear Eric: This may be immature but there’s a snub that has bothered me for 70 years.\n\nIrene was my best friend since elementary school. We lived next door to each other and were inseparable. She was outgoing; I was introverted.\n\nIrene’s parents decided not to invite me to her 15th birthday party to which they invited several young men, fearing that my presence might detract some attention from Irene.\n\nI was profoundly hurt and never spoke to her again.\n\nEven years later, when l was married, my father saw Irene in front of our building pushing a baby carriage holding twins. Irene asked about me, said she would like to talk to me, and gave him her contact info. But l just could not do it. I never called her.\n\n— Still Hurt Friend\n\nDear Friend: What Irene’s parents did to you was unfair and unkind. It’s not immature to still have feelings about it. It’s a core wound that came at an especially sensitive time in your development.\n\nBecause this was Irene’s parents’ doing and, presumably, not hers, talking to Irene may have offered you some closure or even a bit of healing.\n\nBut it’s OK not to be ready.\n\nHowever, if this is bothering you enough to write to me about it, I think it may be an indicator that the wound wants to close.\n\nRelease Irene’s parents for making a bad choice in what they thought was the best interest of their daughter. Release Irene for being caught in the middle. And, most importantly, release yourself. You didn’t deserve the snub. You should have been invited. It doesn’t have to define you anymore.\n\nMore advice\n\nAsking Eric: How do I support my nephew’s newborn without condoning my nephew’s behavior?\n\nDear Abby: I’m in my 40s and disabled, and the dirty looks I get from people in public upset me\n\nAsking Eric: Should we decline an invitation to the wedding of my husband’s probably racist cousin?\n\nDear Abby: My husband and I have become political opposites and it’s putting a strain on our marriage\n\nDear Abby: My neighbor has stopped speaking to me. How should I handle attending her son’s wedding?"
