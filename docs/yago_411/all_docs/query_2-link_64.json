        "text": "Whether it's honeymoon phase or heartbreak, most songs ever written seem to be about romantic love. But where's the love for our besties? Everyone should celebrate their BFFs whenever they can. After all, they're the ones that cheer us up on a bad day, and cheer us on on a good one. We love 'em â€“ and what better way to show it than making them the ultimate best friend playlist?\n\nOn this list of the best friendship songs, youâ€™ll find huge pop blockbusters alongside classic rock anthems, rappers shouting out their squads and Doja Cat shouting out her BFF twerking. Listen with your bestie and youâ€™re sure to find yourself crying in each otherâ€™s arms â€“ or hitting the dance floor. Here are the best friendship songs ever.\n\nContributors: Andrew Frisicano, Andy Kryza, Ro Samarth, Ella Doyle, Chiara Wilkinson, Georgia Evans.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nðŸŽ¤ The best karaoke songs\n\nðŸŽ‰ The best party songs ever made\n\nðŸŽ¶ The best â€™80s songs\n\nðŸ•º The best pop songs of all time\n\n1. â€˜Lean on Meâ€™ by Bill Withers\n\nAnyone whoâ€™s ever nursed a friend through a family crisis, messy breakup or filthy night out knows the value of this song. The line, â€˜Lean on me / When you're not strong / And I'll be your friend / I'll help you carry onâ€¦â€™ really takes you back to holding your bestie close (or their hair back) in times of turmoil. Itâ€™s a sweet-natured ode to working together and uplifting each other even when things get rough. This reciprocal nature of friendship isnâ€™t one you come across often, which is perhaps why it tugs so much on the heartstrings. Or maybe itâ€™s just Withersâ€™ soothing vocal tones.\n\nGeorgia Evans\n\nCommercial Editor, Time Out\n\n2. â€˜Best Friendâ€™ by Saweetie and Doja Cat\n\nThe bouncy opening riff of â€˜Best Friendâ€™ is almost as catchy as its feel-good rap loop: â€˜Thatâ€™s my best friend, sheâ€™s a real bad bitchâ€™. This 2021 collaboration between Doja Cat and Saweetie is the ultimate TikTok-era banger for self-affirming, gal pal appreciation. Picture the scene: youâ€™re not quite feeling your best, your girlfriend comes round and hypes you up, you end up having a big night out looking hot as hell. With its minimal trap drums and infectious chorus, youâ€™ll be twerking along in no time.\n\nChiara Wilkinson\n\nFeatures Editor, UK\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. â€˜You Got a Friend In Meâ€™ by Randy Newman\n\nSometimes, when things are rough, you just need a really good hug from your best mate. But if theyâ€™re not in reach (or you donâ€™t have any), the next best thing is a couple of listens to this song, most probably accompanied by a sunny stroll in a park. Randy Newmanâ€™s raspy-toned tune (of â€˜Toy Storyâ€™ fame) is a sweet, slow cuddle of a song, which packages up all lifeâ€™s troubles into the simple refrain â€˜Youâ€™ve got your troubles / Iâ€™ve got â€˜em too.â€™ Ainâ€™t that right.\n\n4. â€˜With a Little Help From My Friendsâ€™ by The Beatles\n\nGood for Ringo that Paul and John wrote this songâ€™s hummable, easily sing-able melody with their buddyâ€™s distinctive baritone in mind (and before things between them got really contentious). It perfectly captures the ins and outs of going through life with your friends.\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. â€˜Stand By Meâ€™ by Ben E. King\n\nBoth the R&B hit and the 1984 film classic that bears its name stand as timeless tributes to camaraderie. We know weâ€™ll be OK as long as our friends are right there by our sides, even if weâ€™re enduring the universal childhood experience of confronting a knife-wielding Kiefer Sutherland while searching for a dead body.\n\n6. â€˜All My Friendsâ€™ by LCD Soundsystem\n\nJames Murphyâ€™s ode to those true companions who trade a few years of life for a drug-fueled rampage to the raveâ€™s 5am daylight hours â€“ or something more melancholy than that. Either way, itâ€™s a guaranteed indie dance-floor destroyer.\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. â€˜Thank You for Being a Friendâ€™ by Andrew Gold\n\nEven though it serves superbly as the Golden Girls theme song, Goldâ€™s tune stands alone as a timeless tribute to friendship and gratitude. If you don't know how to let your pal know how much you appreciate them (or if you want to play Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, and Sophia with your squad) , this oneâ€™s a great choice.\n\n8. â€˜Thatâ€™s What Friends Are Forâ€˜ by Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight & Stevie Wonder\n\nThis star-studded collaboration was recorded to raise money for AIDS research. That's what friends are for, right? Helping out. Play this track and there wonâ€™t be a dry eye in the house.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. â€˜Youâ€™re My Best Friendâ€™ by Queen\n\nItâ€™s hard to think of a better match than Freddie Mercury soaring voice and Brian May's searing lead guitar, both of which are in fine form on this timeless ode to friendship. Itâ€™s a classic track for montages detailed all the shenanigans and good times you've gotten up to with your best buds.\n\n10. â€˜Best Friendâ€™ by Harry Nilsson\n\nEveryoneâ€™s had that experience of having a new friend you just have to tell everyone about. Harry Nilsson didnâ€™t quite shout this one from the mountaintops, however â€“ the original, â€˜Girlfriend,â€™ found its way out on album, but this version was relegated to being the theme song to TVâ€™s The Courtship of Eddie's Father with no official release for a long time.\n\nAdvertising\n\n11. â€˜Weâ€™re Going to Be Friendsâ€™ The White Stripes\n\nWhile most of Jack and Megâ€™s ouvre delves into fuzzed-out bombast, this tender-hearted tune opts for soft-spoken lyrics and plucked acoustic guitar. It details the beginnings of something very special. Sweet, ainâ€™t it?\n\n12. â€˜Jogaâ€™ by Bjork\n\nThe Icelandic avant-pop sorceress named the best song on her best album after her best friend, which should make you question your level of commitment to your own BFF. Itâ€™s a wondrous mix of baroque strings and electronic burbles and splooshes, with a soaring, heart-swelling chorus encapsulating the nature of a close, transformative friendship: â€˜You push me up to a state of emergency/How beautiful to be.â€™\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. â€˜Started from the Bottomâ€™ by Drake\n\nDrakeâ€™s anthem is about bringing his whole team with him on the way up. He shouts out those who have been with him from the beginning, encouraging him along the way, and standing by him through it all.\n\n14. â€˜Girlâ€™ by Destinyâ€™s Child\n\nThis isnâ€™t just a song about friendsâ€™ ability to make you feel better. Itâ€™s a rallying cry stating that no girl will be left behind when she needs a shoulder to cry on. â€˜I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls. Don't you know that we love you.â€™ Even if youâ€™re alone, BeyoncÃ© is there for you.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. â€˜Best Friendâ€™ by Young Thug\n\nHip hop is full of shoutouts, but seldom does a rapper full-on celebrate their buddies for a full song. Young Thug rectifies the situation, proclaiming â€˜That's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend â€“ go best friend,â€™ over a signature trap beat. Bump it next time your bestie comes into the room and you'll make their day.\n\n16. â€˜Friendshipâ€™ by Tenacious D\n\nJack Black and Kyle Gassâ€™ folksy grunge-pop ripper spells out the broad allure of close friendship, including such universal experiences as running naked in the sand together, fighting a bear and starting a world-conquering band. We can all relate.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. â€˜Old Friendsâ€™ by Everything But the Girl\n\nTracey Thorn and Ben Wattâ€™s moment of remembrance for friendships maintained and friendships lost over the years is a bittersweet bite of nostalgia. Old friends are still a big part of life, even if theyâ€™ve faded to the background.\n\n18. â€˜Count on Meâ€™ by Bruno Mars\n\nThis simple, happy little ditty gets straight to the point. Bruno lets us know that being a friend is not just about the good times, but being there for someone when they need it most. Go on, let your friend know they can count on you.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. â€˜Graduation (Friends Forever)â€™ by Vitamin C\n\nVitamin Câ€˜s biggest hit might focus on a short moment of conflicted feelings â€“ the joy and sadness of saying goodbyes at graduation â€“ but the Pachelbal sample makes the sentiment feel timeless. It's goodbye for now, but friends forever. Or at least until you get to college and find suitable replacements.\n\n20. â€˜Wannabeâ€™ by Spice Girls\n\nThis is how friends roll: â€˜If you wannabe my lover, you gotta get with my friends.â€™ No, that's not an invitation to an orgy. The Spice Girls keep it real with this iconic friend song. Any romantic relationships are to be judged by the friend group, no exceptions.\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. â€˜People Who Diedâ€™ by Jim Carroll Band\n\nPoet Jim Carroll lived life on the edge, and so did everyone else he knew in New Yorkâ€™s druggy arts scene. His most famous musical work is literally a roll call of fallen comrades and their causes of death: overdose, suicide, leukemia, a pack of angry bikers. It ainâ€™t pretty, but it is riotous - a punk rock elegy, played fast enough that no one has time to get sad.\n\n22. â€˜Friendsâ€™ by Flight of the Conchords\n\nThis sparse, mostly a-capella ode to friendship is as sweet as it is absurd, with Jemaine Clement and Brett McKenzieâ€™s sing-songy lyrics talking about the things that make a friendship strong. â€˜Iâ€™ll cheer you up if you're depressed/If you get murdered Iâ€™ll avenge you're deathâ€™ they promise, and itâ€™s hard to think of a better expression of lifelong friendship than that.\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. â€˜22â€™ by Taylor Swift\n\nSure, itâ€™s been adopted by countless cheugy office workers as an anthem for a big night at TGI Fridays, but Taylorâ€™s pop confection captures the very essence of a night out with your friends, one where you can let your inner dork thrive among intimates. Itâ€™s pure joy that no doubt makes this endless apps go down extra easy, and now that Taylor's Version of Red is out, the songâ€™s backward-facing nostalgia is even more potent."
