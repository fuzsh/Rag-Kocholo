        "text": "Full of gory violence and bright colors, \"Inglourious Basterds,\" which opens next Friday, marries a \"Dirty Dozen\"-style plot to a spaghetti-western soundtrack -- another manic mash-up from Quentin Tarantino, Hollywood's prince of repurposed pop culture.\n\nExcept he doesn't quite see it that way.\n\nAnd bristles a tiny bit, right at the start, when I suggest that the opening title -- \"Once upon a time in Occupied France\" -- not only alerts audiences to the coming \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" references, but provides a slight don't-take-this-too-seriously warning.\"I don't know that I'm saying don't take this seriously,\" he says. \"I think it's more an idea of the movie as fairy tale.\"\n\nAlbeit a fairy tale with Brad Pitt as a backwoods commando, Jewish-American soldiers scalping Nazis and a scene that borrows a typical Axis war atrocity and gives it to the Allies. Oh, and did I mention the Manson Family-style forehead carvings? Or that Tarantino also rewrites some pivotal history?\n\nIt's all confidently implausible. And the most confident, implausible thing in all of it might be Tarantino himself.\n\nHollywood's least likely success story was born 46 years ago in Knoxville, Tenn., and grew up in the poor neighborhoods of Southern California, raised by a single mother who'd named him after a character on \"Gunsmoke.\" He obsessed over a wide variety of movies -- Three Stooges shorts, Jules Verne adaptations, Hitchcock films -- and dropped out of high school to become an actor or director.\n\n\"A lot of that (decision) came from immaturity, actually,\" he admits now. \"I realize now that if I'd actually finished school and gone to college, I would have loved it. But I didn't know that in ninth grade -- it just seemed like more school. And I figured I didn't need to go to film school to see films. I could get my education at a video store.\"\n\nEventually Tarantino got a spot behind the counter at an eclectic rental place, hunting down obscure videotapes and debating their merits with his fellow clerks. It was the very definition of a slacker's dead-end job -- and, he says, something that he purposely used for inspiration.\n\n\"Really, chief at the time was my decision that I was not going to have a fallback position,\" he says. \"Because I had no intention of falling back. There's an aspect to that that I do believe. There's no falling back. You have to go forward, always.\"\n\nIt took him years of weekends and scraped-together cash to shoot his first feature, \"My Best Friend's Birthday.\" It was never properly finished. But what Tarantino is \"proudest of in my life\" was that he immediately started work on another screenplay.\n\n\"When you spend three years on something and you have nothing to show for it, and everyone knows it -- I didn't know anybody else then who could have just kept going on,\" he says. \"And the fact that I felt sorry about it for just a little bit, and then started writing 'True Romance' -- I'm still pretty proud of that.\"\n\nHe sold that script, and \"Natural Born Killers.\" But his own breakthrough as a director came with \"Reservoir Dogs,\" a retro-hip heist movie with a black-suited gang falling apart after a robbery. Suddenly, Tarantino was the poster boy for pasty film geeks.\n\n\"It was only a kind of cult celebrity, but that was the kind I'd always wanted,\" he says. \"And then I got a gigantic taste of the other kind of celebrity when we went to England to do press, because the movie was a phenomenon over there ... Suddenly, I saw the difference between having a really groovy art film and having the No. 1 movie in the country.\"\n\nAnd he knew which one he preferred.\n\nYet he saw the beginnings of some nagging criticism, too. \"Dogs\" was decried in some circles for its push-the-envelope sadism; worse, the story was attacked for being pretty much an unacknowledged steal from the Hong Kong actioner \"City on Fire.\" Soon, critics began looking for other quotes and influences in his work, a process that only grew as Tarantino's career progressed.\n\nIt's led to a peculiar love/hate situation for Tarantino. As a lifelong movie freak, he loves layering his films with \"touches,\" homages or, sometimes, outright borrowings; yet, as someone very proud of his own style, he hates it when critics focus on those nods, or accuse him of piecing together crazy quilts out of other people's work.\n\n\"It's like I've got a target on me,\" he complains. \"Critics know I'm a cinephile, and they know I'm not shy about embracing genre, and they turn it into a kind of checklist. ... It's just, you know, it's vaguely insulting. 'Oh, he takes a slice of Leone, adds a pinch of Cimino,' that whole thing. I wouldn't have lasted this long if that's all there was to it.\"\n\nThe irritation is, frankly, pretty indefensible; if you're going to put dozens of in-jokes in a movie, you can't very well complain when people notice them. Still, it's in keeping with Tarantino's thin-skinned, generally combative nature, which has led him into a few public feuds, and even the occasional physical altercation.\n\nYet calling him unoriginal misses the point. Although he was hardly the first to shuffle time around (check out Stanley Kubrick's 1956 \"The Killing,\" for one), he was a leader in subverting structure. And while other directors have done simple homages before -- like DePalma's overpraised Hitchcock retreads -- Tarantino layers the borrowings, making a movie remix in which a Japanese yakuza story unfolds via the extreme closeups of a Sergio Leone Western.\n\n\"Fusion cuisine,\" Tarantino laughingly calls it.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" was, undeniably, the peak for everyone in 1994. It helped affirm Miramax's position as the premiere indie studio, and it revived John Travolta's career. It made Tarantino's name and made everyone a lot of money. At Cannes, it won the Golden Palm; at the Academy Awards, it picked up a sole screenplay prize (\"Well, the screenwriters are always the coolest branch anyway\") which Tarantino shared with co-writer Roger Avary.\n\n\"It was pretty heavy back then,\" Tarantino admits now, \"having my name thrown around, and being invited to all those parties, and having a movie that -- and it had its bad reviews\n\ntoo -- but was talked about as being fresh, and that people were really responding to. But I could never stop, and by the day after the Oscars, I wanted a year off.\"\n\nHe took it, and a little more, directing one-fourth of the anthology film \"Four Rooms,\" dating Mira Sorvino and writing and co-starring in the gory vampire thriller \"From Dusk Till Dawn.\" (That critics have never really embraced Tarantino as a performer -- and found his casting there as George Clooney's brother a trifle farfetched -- remains another sore point.) It was three years before he made another feature.\n\n\"Jackie Brown\" was an interesting departure for him -- less antic and self-consciously hip, it added a blaxploitation feel while staying true to the original Elmore Leonard story. It makes a nice and intriguing companion piece to Steven Soderbergh's own Leonard adaptation, \"Out of Sight\" (which came out the next year) and suggested that, after making movies about other people's movies, Tarantino might finally be interested in making a movie about other people.\n\nInstead, he didn't direct for six years, then jumped back into pumped-up genre flicks. \"Kill Bill\" delivered a sort of informal history of the exploitation film, channeling Hong Kong, Japanese and American influences (and doing it at such loving length that it finally had to be released in two parts). \"Grindhouse,\" made with good friend Robert Rodriguez, had the ambitious idea of inventing an entire flea-pit double-feature, complete with trailers for nonexistent films and deliberately \"missing\" scenes.\n\nIt flopped, disastrously.\n\n\"That hurt my feelings,\" Tarantino says, suddenly sounding a lot younger than 46. \"I had never had something like this happen before, and I took it hard -- that first week (after the release) was very, very depressing. But Robert and I had gotten a little too used to the idea of taking audiences and leading them down these interesting paths we wanted to explore. I had done my crazy two-part exploitation movie, and Robert had done 'Sin City,' and we thought we could almost do it with impunity. And so we led them down this path they really didn't want to follow.\"\n\nAfterwards, Tarantino went back to \"Inglourious Basterds,\" a script he'd been working on for years; the movie may be his biggest gamble since he dropped out of 9th grade. It's an expensive, shot-in-Europe period piece, something he's never tried; it stars Brad Pitt, but in the kind of dark, offbeat role the star's fans have rarely embraced. The film premiered at Cannes; reaction was mixed.\n\nTarantino seems mixed, too.\n\nAt times he seems to have begun to second-guess the box he's put himself in; he describes \"There Will Be Blood\" as \"the best movie of the last five years\" but says \"I don't really know if I want to do something like that, at least not now \"\" I don't know if that's the best use of my time.\" At other times he proudly hails \"Inglorious Basterds\" as \"the best writing I've ever done\" and says he might do a spin-off or prequel, given \"how much I've already written -- we'll see how this one does.\"\n\nAnd that's the contradiction that's Quentin -- an artist who wants to be taken seriously but can't help cracking on-screen jokes, a film buff who loves making obscure references but gets annoyed when too many people get them, a director who starts his latest film with a tremendous dramatic scene -- and soon follows it with a jokey sequence that introduces his commandos with the funky style of some forgotten drive-in movie.\n\n\"Yeah, that always gets a big laugh from the audience,\" he says of the moment. \"But it's not a cheap gag. People go with it, you know. I do feel part of it is, you know, they realize, well, Quentin is still going to be Quentin. He's always going to deal with the material his way.\"\n\nStephen Whitty may be reached at swhitty@starledger.com or (212) 790-4435."
