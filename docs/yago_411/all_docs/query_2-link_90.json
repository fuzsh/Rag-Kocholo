        "text": "\"Suddenly, a familiar song. And, you're off your chair in one, exquisite movement... wondering, searching, sniffing the wind like a dapple deer. Has God heard your little prayer? Will Cinderella dance again? And then, suddenly, the crowds part and there he is: sleek, stylish... radiant with charisma. Bizarrely, he's on the telephone. But then, so are you. And then he comes towards you... the moves of a jungle cat. Although you quite correctly sense that he is... gay... like most devastatingly handsome single men of his age are, you think... what the hell. Life goes on. Maybe there won't be marriage... maybe there won't be sex... but, by God, there'll be dancing.”\n\nJulianne embarked on this quest in search of a husband when she was actually in search of a titular best friend. She had clung to her relationship with Michael like a life raft, rather than expanding her post-collegiate friendships. She said goodbye to Michael and Kimmy not knowing what would be next for them. Yet, George surprises Julianne at the reception in a fantastically staged reveal. Director P.J. Hogan really milks the entire phone call in delightful fashion. As George drops hints that he can see her, she scans the reception area almost as if she’s in a horror movie. Roberts knows how to give great reaction shots and hold the audience’s attention.\n\nWhen she finally spies George waiting at another table, he saunters over with all the charisma and confidence of James Bond. After all, George is Julianne’s one true love. He’s the one that was chasing after her, being her confidant and shoulder to cry on and going along with her schemes. The final scene creates a wholly original version of true love. Yes, it’s still a man and a woman, but it’s the bond between a woman and her gay best friend. While the two dance the night away, Julia Roberts flashes her trademark smile. George has been the hero all along.\n\nIt’s worth noting that it was rare for this type of role to be played by an out gay man. Everett had come out professionally in 1989, which posed severe limits on the types of roles he was offered. This partially explains what makes George such a refreshing figure, even if he’s not always used to his fullest potential. By having an out gay man play him, the character feels fully fleshed out. Even when he’s flamboyant or singing, George exists in a grounded universe, more so than some of the wackier characters (love you Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston). As we’ll see through this series, these characters often come off more cartoon-ish when played by straight actors.\n\nWe began with My Best Friend’s Wedding because it expertly embodies all the machinations of a romantic comedy while also twisting them. It shows you can make a different picture with the same puzzle pieces. George is still very much the prototypical gay best friend. However, the way he was used in the plot and given depth by Everett represented a major turning point. For those reasons, this felt like a good place to start in examining the trope. There will be worse versions, there will be better versions. Diversity will (slowly) make its way into the framework. Still, George is who I instantly think of when I think of a “gay best friend.”"
