A sweatshirt embroidered with their favorite Taylor Swift lyric they can cozy up in while listening to an endless loop of Folklore and Evermore (crying in the bathtub at the same time is not required but also not frowned upon).\n\n2. A set of LED light saber chopsticks for your BFF who is the Chewbacca to your Han Solo (and also happens to be who you get sushi with every Friday night).\n\n3. A challenging 1,000-piece gradient puzzle that'll take them more than one session to finish — they may want to throw it across the room, but they'll thank you for the mental distraction.\n\n4. Minnie Mouse stud earrings you can count on to bring some extra magic into their life and make them feel like it's their birthday every day.\n\n5. A subscription to Atlas Coffee Club to bring aromatic, fresh beans from all over the world right to their front door.\n\n6. A Beauty Bento Bouncy Eyeshadow Trio by Kaja — the super-convenient stack of stunning shadows ideal for getting-ready routines at places that aren't their native vanity (i.e. hangouts at your place).\n\nSephora\n\nPromising review: \"These are so cute and the glitter is beautiful! I love how easy they are to use and they’re great as a eyeshadow topper.\" –Mishaa16\n\nGet it from Sephora for $26 (available in 10 shade combinations and finishes).\n\n7. A mug warmer that'll be invaluable to your roomie who has a terrible habit of making themselves a cup of tea then lingering for so long at your doorway while updating you on the latest development in the \"Driver's License\" drama that their drink gets cold.\n\n8. A P.volve subscription for your workout buddy who has been getting bored of the same old routine and has been itching to mix things up.\n\n9. A face wash foamer they can use to make the cleanser they're already accustomed to feel extra fancy.\n\n10. A gift set of hair products from Function of Beauty you can customize to their exact hair type, make their favorite color, and even name the concoction after them or one of your many inside jokes.\n\n11. A nostalgic Apple Watch stand that'll pay tribute to their favorite handheld video game. Ah, to be young again.\n\n12. A cozy throw blanket with adorable pompom detailing for elegantly draping over their favorite accent chair (and later cocooning themselves in while they binge their favorite TV show in the wee hours of the morning).\n\nAmazon\n\nWe've also got you covered with some more cozy bedroom products available on Amazon.\n\nPromising review: \"This blanket is soft, beautiful, cozy but not too hot. I have already washed and dried it and it shows no change. My dog who is normally always in my lap prefers to be cuddled with this blanket because that’s just how comfortable it is. It would make a great gift. I got the 90“ x 90“ and I’m so glad I did. It’s very large, which I wanted, but I’m sure the smaller sizes are great as well.\" –Tracy\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in four sizes and 19 colors; clip the coupon on the product page to save 18%).\n\n13. A Jeopardy trivia book to properly commemorate one of the greatest men to ever grace our televisions and their favorite thing to watch on a weekday evening.\n\n14. A candle from Evil Queen that'll literally become the *light of their life* thanks to the sassy labels and delicious scents.\n\n15. A comfy onesie for a fun addition to their loungewear — go on, treat yourself to one too so you can match.\n\n16. A skeleton ice cube mold tray, so the master mixologist in your life can take their concoctions to the next level. Even if they claim to be ~dead inside~ they'll appreciate this present.\n\n17. A gift certificate to the Bronx Zoo for a virtual hangout with one of their favorite animals — they'll get up close and personal (from a distance) with a warthog, porcupine, cheetah, penguin, or sloth!\n\n18. A Baby Yoda Bluetooth speaker that's *almost* as adorable as the real lil' guy in The Mandalorian, great for anyone who wants to blast their favorite tunes all across the galaxy.\n\n19. An under-eye brightening corrector from BECCA Cosmetics that might seem like a strange gift at face value, but is actually what your makeup-obsessed Galentine has likely been trying to track down since seeing it blow up on TikTok.\n\n20. The World of Critical Role book for anyone who is infatuated with Dungeons and Dragons, the cast of the show, and, like myself, has taken the time to binge-watch their YouTube episodes over the last few months.\n\n21. A Ruth Bader Ginsburg action figure to keep them company at their desk while they sift through endless emails.\n\n22. A four-pack of pizza socks they won't find ~cheesy~ at all when their toes are as toasty as a pie fresh out of the oven.\n\n23. A mini disco ball to reflect light and add *many* a dazzling touch to their favorite hangout space, as well as up the funk factor. 🕺\n\nPromising review: \"This was a gift for my daughter. This disco ball feels very well-made. It's got a little bit of weight to it, but not so much that it's cumbersome. It's just heavy enough to let you know that it's not some junky toy. As far as I can tell the mirror tiles are real glass. Shine a light on it and give it a little spin and you have an instant party and a beautiful display. I was indifferent to disco balls prior to this but after getting this one and hanging in my daughter's bedroom, I can definitely see why people love these things.\" –Amazon Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $12.99.\n\n24. A splurge-worthy Ullo wine purifier and aerator that'll impress the pants off of your most *extra* friend who is forever asking to celebrate their big day at a vineyard.\n\n25. An extremely glamorous padded and embellished headband to make them feel like the belle of the ball on Zoom calls.\n\n26. A Parent Trap-inspired mug for your childhood BFF who you have been watching this iconic movie with for over a decade when either of you has a bad day. They can sip out of it while snacking on peanut butter and Oreos.\n\n27. Mascara with a plethora of rave reviews, guaranteed to impress your bestie who spends most of their weekends watching makeup tutorials on YouTube.\n\n28. A unique book featuring 70 detailed pages that'll describe their personality traits and insights about their birth chart based on their birthday — a fantastic gift for your buddy who reads their horoscope every morning.\n\n29. An anti-fog spray, perfect for anyone who wants to be able to both see *and* wear their mask at the same time during any birthday outing (even if it's just to pick up their free Starbies).\n\n30. A hand crank music box that plays the \"Song of Storms\" from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time that might just bring a tear to any gamer's eye.\n\n31. A set of resistance bands and a marbled yoga mat that'll impress your fit friend and add a pop of color to one of their go-to workouts.\n\n32. A mini Fujifilm Instax camera so your bestie can capture memories in a fun and tangible way, rather than trying to navigate the elusive filters and modes of an iPhone.\n\nPromising review: \"My niece and nephew visited me this summer and I thought it would be a fun way to document the things they did. They enjoyed the pictures and making a book with all the activities they did with family and friends. It's easy to use. The instructions are small so you might need a magnifying glass for them, but once we figured it out, we have taken it everywhere with us.\" –Amazon Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $74.85+ (available in six colors and a bundle pack).\n\n33. A cold brew coffeemaker because their iced coffee obsession is getting a little out of hand and you don't want to make yet another trek to a cafe with them in the middle of the day. *Voila* now they can have barista-level cold brew from the comfort of their own kitchen!\n\nPromising review: \"I have been drinking caffeinated beverages everyday for half my life. Usually brewing hot then cooling it down with ice which was quite a process to do every morning. Then I came across this cold brew pitcher and thought I'd give it a try. It's great, easy to use and clean, very convenient, lasts for a couple weeks, I love it! Making a pitcher of coffee take less time than a normal brewer and makes enough for at least one cup a day for about a week, depending on how much coffee concentrate is used. I haven't used my normal coffee or espresso machine since I got this cold brew system. The coffee seems to taste better as well, not a huge difference but it's somewhat noticeable.\" –Birnbaum\n\nGet it from Amazon for $20.99+ (clip the coupon to save an extra $3.15; available in two sizes and three colors).\n\n34. A Jeni's ice cream pick-your-own mix for your frozen treat–obsessed BFF who would enjoy nothing more than diving into a pint while watching all three of the To All the Boys I've Loved Before movies.\n\n35. A trio of Balm Dotcom by Glossier, the skin and lip salve that truly is the bomb (dot com!). From scents like mango and coconut to birthday cake and cookie butter, your bestie will feel so spoiled when they see the three tubes you selected for them.\n\nGlossier\n\nNote: Some of these balms are tinted.\n\nPromising review: \"I bought them all because they’re so great. No other balm / salve compares. Some have the perfect pop of color for your lips, and some can be used for dry skin patches. I’m a lifer for this product!\" –Amelia H.\n\nGet the trio from Glossier for $36 (available in nine scents).\n\n36. And a Lizzie McGuire crewneck for your bestie who will always be your karaoke partner for \"What Dreams Are Made Of.\"\n\n37. A lip gloss for your BFF who loves a bit of glamour and shine in their life, but hates sticky glosses that feel like glue.\n\n38. A spunky fern in a chic pot that will grow with nourishment and care, just like your ~friendship~.\n\n39. A literary-themed cocktail book for that bookworm friend who is constantly looking for any excuse to throw a Gatsby-themed party.\n\n40. A deck of positive affirmation cards with beautiful designs and sayings for meditation, reflection, and a daily dose of good vibes for your best friend.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"These are the absolute best. They are BEAUTIFUL and have really quality affirmations. I find these much more related than others I've seen or owned. The quotes on the back a great touch. Just bought a second pack as a Christmas gift.\" –Monarch14\n\nGet the deck of 52 cards from Amazon for $16.95 (available in two styles).\n\n41. A charm necklace by Frasier Sterling that takes a traditional initial chain above and beyond, since it can house up to nine letters. Whether you customize it for your pal's full name, nickname, or even just a one-word message, this trendy piece is sure to become a sentimental staple.\n\nFrasier Sterling\n\nFrasier Sterling is a woman-owned accessory brand that specializes in personalized and unique jewelry.\n\nPromising review: \"The best necklace purchase I’ve ever made. It’s so cute and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments. I like how adjustable it is because I can make it longer or shorter depending on my shirt. It does take a while to ship since it’s custom but totally worth it!\" —Yun H.\n\nGet it from Frasier Sterling for $66.\n\n42. A Golden Girls blanket in a PopArt style for cuddling up with all the coziness they feel when hanging with you — their bestie!\n\n43. A handheld electric milk frother they can use to turn their morning brew in a foamtastic and fluffy coffee shop–level experience.\n\n44. A pair of Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones so they can work out, get a snack, or ignore text messages while listening to their favorite playlist — all without being ~tied down~.\n\n45. A set of laboratory-style shot glasses to truly make drinking a science. Experimenting with different kinds of tequila? Perfect.\n\n46. A challenging and cool-looking Rubik's cube-style puzzle that'll look even more art-like before it's completed.\n\n47. A gorgeous textured travel wallet that'll store their cash, boarding pass, passport, credit cards, and more — all while looking like a chic mini clutch.\n\n48. A wedge ice cube set that'll perfectly chill any libation WITHOUT watering it down — and it also happens to look really cool.\n\n49. A cute and colorful air frier that'll harness the magic of circulating hot air to add a crunch to all their favorite foods with ease. Just a warning, the gift of perfectly crispy fries, wings, and more at home without hauling out a deep frier might bring a tear to their eye.\n\n50. An at-home gel nails kit for your friend who hasn't missed a nail appointment in years. This kit has everything one needs for an at-home gel mani, which lengthens the nails the same way acrylics do while being way easier to apply. This was one of my random midnight Amazon purchases months ago, and I haven't seen a nail tech since.\n\n51. A Rosie By Jane Dulce eau de parfum, because gourmand is back, baby! Gourmand is any scent that smells like a warm dessert — think, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate — and this stuff smells like the grown-up version of that Warm Vanilla Sugar body spray your bestie* loved. They'll get that gourmand they crave with the vanilla added inside, while hinoki wood adds a woodsy scent and nude musk grounds the fragrance.\n\n52. A waterproof cleansing brush to help your skincare-loving friends scrub every last bit of debris from their skin. This brush is made of antimicrobial silicone, which ensures an effective yet gentle exfoliation process that won't ever tear at the skin or spread bacteria.\n\n53. A patch sweatshirt they'll probably want to live in for the rest of cold-weather season, and can you blame them? The ~out of this world~ design is simple but cute and it comes in many vibrant colors.\n\nGenevieve Scarano / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com\n\n\"I personally own this sweatshirt and I wear it all the time! It goes well with joggers and leggings and it's my go-to piece of clothing whenever I'm relaxing at home or spending solo time outdoors.\" —Genevieve Scarano\n\nPromising review: \"I love these shirts, I got the black alien and the white wave shirt.

Magic!\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"I was given my first Rocketbook by a family member as a gift. The app and the ability to send sheets directly to email, Google Drive, Dropbox, or other places is one of the best features.

'That'll never work,' I thought to myself. We stuck it on the shower wall that day and have had no issues since. It's still sticking some 60 days later and shows no signs of slipping. It holds beer cans and plastic pint glasses like a boss, and for those days when I'm feeling super bougie, I make a cocktail, dump it in a tumbler, and it fits, too! Shower beers will never be the same again!\" —Morgan\n\nGet it from Amazon for $12.95+ (available in six styles).\n\nYou, after presenting your bestie with their birthday gift:\n\nSome reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nLooking for the perfect gift for any occasion?
