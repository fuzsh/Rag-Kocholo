        "text": "The original version of this thread accidentally listed Jackie Brown twice in the poll. I can't find a way to correct that, so I'm encouraging the mods to delete the original.\n\nI'm put in mind of this because I'm currently watching \"Django Unchained\" for the Nth time (plainly my favourite Tarantino movie, eclipsing Jackie Brown), and I'm curious to see how Tarantino fares on the board.\n\nChoices on the poll consists of movies directed by Tarantino.\n\nGood topic.\n\nI gotta go with Pulp Fiction, which I saw in theaters 3 times when it came out.\n\nNot only was it a great film, but it was influential, fun, colorful, filled with quotable dialogue, wonderful performances, and scenarios.\n\n(Pulp Fiction will probably always be to Tarantino what Citizen Kane was to Orson Welles, even though both men have gone to make other great films.)\n\nEver since, I've made it a point to see every Tarantino movie in the cinema at least once.\n\nHere's how I rank them:\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nJackie Brown (his most underrated IMO)\n\nInglorious Basterds\n\nKill Bill 1\n\nKill Bill 2\n\nDjango Unchained (so far, I've seen it once, but I may bump it up with repeat viewings. I also haven't seen the Kill Bills in years, though I did see them multiple times when they debut in the cinema and on DVD.)\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nDeath Proof\n\nI know he directed a scene in Sin City and a skit in Four Rooms, but I don't know that it's enough to rank them in the same list as the other full-length features.\n\nI had a buddy who was working at the Sundance festival in '92 and he kept going on about Reservoir Dogs, I had to see it, it would change my life etc. So as soon as it hit the local art house we went, and it actually lived up to the buildup he had given. I'd never seen anything like it. We almost counted the days to Pulp Fiction, and it didn't disappoint.\n\nMy favorite, though, is Jackie Brown; I thought it had a lot of heart and some really nice, \"human\" performances, as opposed to glib, bantering cool cats and cool chicks. I had hoped that Tarantino would continue in that direction, but the later movies got more cartoony, stylized, ironic and inside-referential. The Kill Bills and Django were OK, but I really hated Inglorious Basterds by the end. Overall, Tarantino hasn't gone in a direction that interests me much.\n\nI'm hoping he does make Kill Bill Vol 3 because I'm 90% sure it will be about Vernita Green's daughter trying to get revenge on Bea.\n\nThe first two really do work best as one entity. Because the moment when Budd shoots Bea is funnier if you watch it right after the O-Ren sequence (Knowing then that if just ONE of those people had a gun instead of a sword it would have been over immediately).\n\nAs I mentioned in the other thread I like his earlier genre play movies more than I like his later revenge porn movies.\n\nPart of the charm of KBv2 derives from Bill being in many ways the Mirror Universe version of Kwai Chang Caine. I'm an enormous fan of Kung Fu, so I literally don't mind at all watching Bill and Beatrix simply talk for the extended period it takes for the tension to slowly build to the awesome climax. Basterds also has prolonged dialog exchanges and monologues, the nature and context of which help make it the exceptional movie it also is. YMMV.\n\nI just reread your post above. Awesome climax? Five fingers of death, three seconds of alleged suspense. Part Two's so much longer than one, which also kills its momentum for me.\n\nYep. Very awesome. I was totally surprised that they went there, to that place that's quite fitting of the chop-socky genre. They'd dropped a few hints along the way and established that there was such a technique in plenty of time so that it's definitely not deus ex machina. But they also played it close enough to the vest to keep it a total surprise that it would end that way, at least to me. Really good balance there, I thought. But as I said also, YMMV.\n\nNow DEATH PROOF's ending is chintzy beyond belief, yet wildly fulfilling just the same. Kurt Russell was hilarious in the end.\n\nThe ending was the one thing I liked about Death Proof.\n\nI would say The Great Dictator was the 1940s version of The Interview only The Great Dictator was actually funny. (That one came out BEFORE America entered the war.)\n\nIn it Charlie Chaplin plays both Hitler and a Jewish barber, and in the end they switch places and Hitler is dragged away as a Jew.\n\nI'm hoping he does make Kill Bill Vol 3 because I'm 90% sure it will be about Vernita Green's daughter trying to get revenge on Bea.\n\n[...]\n\nAs I mentioned in the other thread I like his earlier genre play movies more than I like his later revenge porn movies.\n\nAnyone else see the glaring contradiction here?\n\n(Hint: KB1 is by far the revenge porniest of Tarantino's films to date, as is, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, KB as a whole.)"
