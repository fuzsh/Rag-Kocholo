        "text": "The Birthdayest of Birthday’s\n\nA review of Tim Brayton provided by so many of us who care about you.\n\nHappiest of birthday’s Tim – it’s hard to know what to get for a grad student to needs everything… ha! Honestly, when we met in 2008 you were the last person in the room I expected to be friends with. You were far too smart and far too nerdy and I would never have imagined that we could find anything to talk about (haha!)… and isn’t it funny how you’re still too smart and too nerdy for me, but somehow you still keep me as your friend, so that I’m lucky enough to share the best parts of you… your kindness, your patience, your sensitivity, your ball jokes and your unwavering friendship. Thankful for you today and every day. -Carrie J\n\nIn 2020, a few months after lockdown started, I was feeling down in the dumps and burnt out on Zoom call game nights. I stumbled on Tim’s reviews linked from Reddit, which inspired me to start seriously watching movies again after I’d completely stopped when my first kid was born a few years earlier. Three-plus years later, Alternate Ending is my favorite community online, I’m watching movies daily, and I have my own podcast and movie review site. Happy birthday, and thanks Tim for spreading your good word on cinema with the world — it’s had a genuine positive impact on my life. – Dan S\n\nTim, I hope you understand how much you mean to the entire AE community. We came together over both our love of movies and our love of your insightful, elegant, and very quotable commentary thereupon. On this and all your following birthdays, we will always celebrate you for the innumerable gifts you’ve given us (most importantly, the ability to wear shirts that say “it looks like a dead dog’s asshole on a hot day”). Much love and best wishes for getting the hell out of grad school, Mandy\n\nDear Tim, For over a decade now your film writing has been an endless source of knowledge and joy. Your writing continues to give me a deeper appreciation for cinema and for that I am eternally grateful. So, to the man, the myth, the legend! I wish you a very happy birthday. Of all the Tim Braytons, you’re the Tim Braytonest. Your longtime reader, Hallvarður Jón\n\nDear Tim, Happy birthday, and holly jolly holidays! I’m so glad you’re our smart, funny, incisive critic. Never change, except maybe your clothes every once in a while. Here’s hoping this next year you’ll be able to get a breather and maybe even a few dozen pay raises. Sincerely, Bleach-errrrrrrrr\n\nThanks as always for being a rock of sanity in the sea that is film criticism on the internet. Your words; your method; your philosophy towards film analysis is a beacon for us confused travelers looking for a station. May your birthday and your holidays be full of happiness and good cheer. Sincerely – Travis Neeley\n\nBest Wishes from the First Place Trivia Podium, hoping you have a great birthday and an excellent subsequent year” -STinG\n\nHappy birthday, Tim! Thanks for the gift you’ve given all of us in your insights and your sense of humor. I imagine it might be a difficult time to celebrate, given the hurt of your recent loss. That’s a hurt I know doesn’t pass quickly. But I hope you’re surrounded by the people you love, and that this coming year brings only things worth celebrating. All the best, Caleb\n\nHappy birthday, Tim, and thank you for 12+ years of informative reviews. – Gavin"
