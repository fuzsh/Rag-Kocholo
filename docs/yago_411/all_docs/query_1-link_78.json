        "text": "Quentin Tarantino’s first movie Reservoir Dogs has one eye on the past. The soundtrack is littered with 70’s music, we hear snippets from a radio station “super sounds of the 70’s”, the characters talk about the past. This is something that has been a key to his career ever since, creating something original by repackaging the past. The reason it works is that he doesn’t take the best of the past, he takes the cool, and the quirky. But he doesn’t only look back, he has always had an eye on the future, or more precisely his legacy. His intention to make just ten films then retire. The idea being that the final films great directors tend to be rubbish. Given he has just celebrated his 60th birthday and is reported to be working on his final film, it seems like a good time to look back on his movies to date. What better way to do that than a ranking.\n\nA few notes on the ranking: I have only included feature films directed by Tarantino, not films he scripted, acted in, or co-directed. I have also judged the films as they were released in the UK, Therefore, Death Proof is included as a standalone film, The Grindhouse Project is not included, Kill Bill is two separate films. Finally, and most importantly, there is no measure or metric to this ranking, it is just my preference. If you have a differ ranking feel free to share it, but remember, neither of us is right or wrong, they are just opinions.\n\n1 – Pulp Fiction: What can I say, the film is perfect. Despite the broken timeline it all makes perfect sense and hangs together as a single piece. The casting is perfect throughout, as are the performances, but the real star is Tarantino’s script that keeps the movie moving at a perfect pace. The film has some of the best dialogue ever filmed. The two and a half hours zip past as if it were 90 minutes. It has been copied and emulated from the moment it came out. The film has no great subtext or deeper meaning, but if you are looking for that why watch a movie called Pulp Fiction?\n\n2 – Jackie Brown: Probably the best plot of any Tarantino movie, but it isn’t his! Based on the novel Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard, the director adapted it himself and injected his own style, swagger, and dialogue. The cast is amazing throughout, but Pam Grier totally owns it. It is a film that tends to divide opinion but is probably the most accessible Tarantino movie and one that people who are lukewarm on his more indulgent projects should still enjoy.\n\n3 – Reservoir Dogs: I was 16 when the movie came out, I first saw it at the cinema two years later (it took another year before it got a video release), I have seen every subsequent film on release at the cinema. The genius of the film is the twist on convention, it is heist movie that doesn’t show the heist. There isn’t much plot, it’s all about the characters, their relationships, and interactions. These encounters are accentuated by Tarantino’s unique dialogue. The other key to the brilliance is the casting.\n\n4 – Kill Bill Vol. 1: Remember Pulp Fiction? Uma Thurman plays an actress whose biggest role came in a TV pilot that didn’t get picked up. Her character was from a group of female assassins, sound familiar. The story goes that she pitched the idea of The Bride on the set of Pulp Fiction. The fact that it is in the script suggests Fox Force Five predates The Bride, even so the characters and the idea are credited to both Turman and Tarantino. Objectively some of the films on the list are better than this, but the film is so much fun, it is just dripping with style, the soundtrack is amazing, and one of the chapters is breathtaking: Show Down at House of Blue Leaves!\n\n5 – Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: I was really concerned when Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was announced. Firstly, we don’t need another movie about Charles Manson, but more significantly, is Quentin Tarantino capable of the sensitivity needed to tell the story of the horrendous murder of actress Sharon Tate? My fears were exacerbated by the fact I didn’t particularly enjoy his last film, The Hateful Eight (spoiler, its bottom of this ranking). I needn’t have worried, the film is an absolute blast and a true return to form. Taken on its own merits it is a fun, and often funny film that somewhat recaptures my favourite of his films, Pulp Fiction. It is also a fitting love letter to Hollywood as a whole, and the birth of New Hollywood. A director who has always had an eye on late 60’s, and 1970’s cinema, he has finally visited the era, and it was a rich and rewarding trip. The film has its issues, but they are easily forgotten simply because they are outweighed by everything else that is so good. Not Tarantino’s masterpiece but an accomplished work and for only the second or third time in his career, he isn’t just entertaining us, he has something to say.\n\n6 – Inglourious Basterds: The last line of Inglourious Basterds is. “This might just be my masterpiece.” It may just be that! Bringing together all the elements of his previous films but giving them a bit more depth despite the apparent brevity he brings to a serious subject. It also has something that Tarantino is never normally accused of. He is commenting on the way movies rewrite history, and people take this fiction as truth. It’s a film I appreciate a little more with every rewatch.\n\n7 – Kill Bill Vol. 2: The to Kill Bill movies should have been one, but it was too long and Tarantino wouldn’t cut it down. The story from the first film unfolds and is revealed here. Still excellent, just not as much fun as the first movie.\n\n8 – Death Proof: Originally intended as part of Grindhouse, a double feature of Death Proof and Robert Rodriguez’s Planet Terror. When Grindhouse underperformed at the US box office the two films were released separately in some territories including here in the UK. At nearly two hours, it plays in a slightly extended cut from the Grindhouse version. It is still made to look like a Grindhouse movie with two connected stories put together in a perfect disjointed way as if they were two features edited down and cut together for a fleapit or drive-in. The first half of the movie is dialogue heavy; the second part is all action. Both are filled with countless movie references including a lot of 70’s car movies. Not his best movie but a hell of a lot of fun.\n\n9 – Django Unchained: I like this movie, but I have only watched it a couple of times. The main issue is that it is unnecessarily long to the point of being self-indulgent, not as much so as the movie below, but still self-indulgent. There is a scene some way into the film were Jamie Foxx’ Django meets a character played by Franco Nero, the eponymous anti-hero of Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 Spaghetti Western Django. This just makes me think, I would rather be watching that film.\n\n10 – The Hateful Eight: This is the film where Tarantino lost me. He has made no secret of the fact Rio Bravo is one of his favorite films. For all its action, most of the film consists of a group of people sitting in a room talking. Was he trying to remake that? It has some great moments, but they are so spread out. An unnecessarily long film that adds nothing to the genre or the director’s catalogue.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n“You wake up to eerie silence. You call out ‘Hello?’ but no-one answers. You’re alone except for a film projector and speakers with infinite battery life and five of your favourite films at the foot of the projector. You have nowhere to be so start watching the films. What are they, where are you and how will your story play out?”\n\nThis is the scenario presented to us by Claire Packer at the recently rejuvenated Cinematic Delights. Her expectation goes beyond just choosing the five films. Find out more HERE.\n\nMy five films: What are the five films you would happily watch for the foreseeable future and why?\n\nMy fate: Where have you been deserted – are you adrift like Hanks in Castaway or are you an end of the world survivor like Smith in I Am Legend?\n\nMy finale: How will your time alone end? Will you be saved by Spielberg or will you live happily ever after on your own like Disney?\n\nLet’s start in the middle where am I? I prefer to go with the Desert Island Discs/Hanks in Castaway option, as it always gives a degree of hope!\n\nAs for the movies, I set myself an extra challenge. Eleven years ago, hosted a similar event that I called Desert Island DVD’s also taking its inspiration from the long running BBC Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs. I have decided not to choose any of the eight movies I picked before, they were: My movies back then were:\n\nCasablanca (1942)\n\nSome Like it Hot (1959)\n\nTwo Lane Blacktop (1971)\n\nGoodfellas (1990)\n\nDazed and Confused (1993)\n\nPulp Fiction (1994)\n\nOldboy (2003)\n\nSerenity (2005)\n\nLike last time, it isn’t just about my favourite films, its about films I can watch over and over and not tire of. One thing I can say fore sure, limiting us to just five films was cruel!\n\nChinatown (1974): I’m not sure there has ever been a film dripping with despair as Chinatown. Not only is it one of my favourite movies, but it is strangely perfect for this scenario. When I watched it during the first lockdown last year there was something comforting about watching people whose situation was more hopeless with than me.\n\nFandango (1985): The most sentimental film on the list. The film that give its name to my Blog and twitter handle. This film has to be on the list for so many reasons. Just taken on its own merits, it’s a great and under seen film. It also lends a little much needed brevity to my list. It is also associated with great memories; the favourite film of a close friend, it was on hard rotation when I was a student, we also visited some of the filming locations while on holiday in West Texas a few years back.\n\nThe English Patient (1996): I loved the film from when I first watched it at the cinema twenty-five years ago. It has since been either forgotten, overlooked, or dismissed. I don’t care what anybody thinks, it’s an absolute masterpiece. One of the few films that I actually think is better than the book on which it’s based. Like Chinatown, I see more every time I watch it.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015): There is a conversation at the heart of the movie between Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) about why the characters are doing what they are doing. The answer is simple, they are all looking for either hope or redemption. That’s kind of what all movies are about! And that’s just one of the reasons the film is so perfect.\n\nAtomic Blonde (2017): Comparisons with another film that came out a few years before are inevitable, but Atomic Blonde is both the slickest and most fun of its type. It does the near impossible task of invoking other great films, without making me wish I was watching them.\n\nThe final question: How will your time alone end? That’s not for me to say, but we are nothing without hope!\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles, California is a world famous “revival houses”. Its legend is helped by the fact it is owned by Quentin Tarantino. He purchased the 1920’s building that includes the cinema in 2007 to save it from redevelopment but acted more as a landlord than proprietor, until now. The director had always vowed to show double features in 35mm, but has now taken it a stage further and has taken over programming and will be showing double features from his own 35mm private collection. I’m sure he will show some of his own movies from time to time, but what would he pair them with? Here are my ideas:\n\nReservoir Dogs (1992) and The Killing (1956)\n\nThree films are often credited with influencing Reservoir Dogs: Ringo Lam’s City on Fire (1987) (undercover cop and the suits), Joseph Sargent’s The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) (the Mr [insert colour here] names) and Stanley Kubrick’s The Killing (the overall plot). All great films but I am going with my favourite and possibly the least well know, The Killing.\n\nPulp Fiction (1994) and Go (1999)\n\nThere are so many films I could pair with Pulp fiction, I am going with Doug Liman’s Go. The narrative structure is different to the one used in Pulp Fiction but does use a group of intertwined stories in a similar way. For all the films that have influenced Tarantino, it is nice to include a film that is most probably influenced by him.\n\nJackie Brown (1997) and Nikita (1990)\n\nThe obvious choice, Out of Sight (1998), both are based on Elmore Leonard novels and even feature a shared character Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton). However I am going for Nikita, a very different film but with a similar thread, both films are about woman who get drawn into worlds that they don’t want to be in.\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)\n\nI am not going to pair these films with anything , instead I am going to put them together the way they should have been originally, as one film.\n\nDeath Proof (2007) and Doomsday (2008)\n\nDeath Proof started life out as part of the Grindhouse project and therefore already has a paired film, Planet Terror. My first thought for a paired film was the movie it most directly references Vanishing Point (1971), but I went a different way, of recent films Neil Marshall’s Doomsday is the film that best captures the exploitation cinema vibe that Tarantino was looking for in Grindhouse.\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009) and Casablanca (1942)\n\nI considered various movies: resistance films, Flame and Citron (2008) or Black Book (2006), WWII behind enemy lines story Saving Private Ryan (1998) or ludicrous comedy Tropic Thunder (2008), however I went with Casablanca (1942) for no particular reason, I could just see these very different WWII movies working together.\n\nDjango Unchained (2012) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\n\nThe obvious choice Django (1966) (original Django, Franco Nero has a cameo in unchained) but when you strip away the themes of Django Unchained you are left with a buddy movie disguised as a western and the best buddy movie disguised as a western has to be Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nRead Full Post »"
