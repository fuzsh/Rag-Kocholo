        "text": "Louis of France, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy (16 August 1682 – 18 February 1712), was the eldest son of Louis, Grand Dauphin, and Dauphine Maria Anna and grandson of the reigning King Louis XIV of France. He was known as the \"Petit Dauphin\" to distinguish him from his father, who died in April 1711, when the former became the official Dauphin of France. He never reigned, as he died in 1712 while his grandfather was still on the throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the Duke of Burgundy's son became Louis XV.\n\nIssue[edit]\n\nLouis of France, Duke of Brittany (25 June 1704 – 13 April 1705) died in infancy.\n\nLouis of France, Duke of Brittany (8 January 1707 – 8 March 1712) died of measles.\n\nLouis of France (future King Louis XV of France) (15 February 1710 – 10 May 1774) first engaged to Mariana Victoria of Spain but married Marie Leszczyńska and had issue.\n\nTitles[edit]"
