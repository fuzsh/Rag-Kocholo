        "text": "Brunswick Cathedral was established by Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, as a collegiate church between 1173 and 1195. He and his wife, Matilda of England, were both buried in the church while it was still unfinished.\n\nTheir tomb was made between 1230 and 1240, and the church was eventually consecrated in 1226. The Cathedral is now the final resting place of many more royal women, such as Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of King George IV of the United Kingdom. The crypt underneath the cathedral can be visited, though I was quite lucky to be allowed through the gates for a closer look.\n\nTomb of Princess Christine Louise of Oettingen-Oettingen and her husband Louis Rudolph I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nEpitaph of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and his wife Mathilda of England\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMarker for Beatrix of Swabia and her husband Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nEntrance to the crypt\n\nThe first two tombs belong to Ferdinand Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern and his wife, Christine of Hesse-Eschwege.\n\nTombs of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife, Antoinette Amalie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\nTombs of Ferdinand Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern and his wife, Christine of Hesse-Eschwege\n\nTomb of Ferdinand Christian of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern\n\nTomb of Frederick George of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern\n\nTomb of Henry Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern\n\nTomb of August Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern\n\nTombs of William, Duke of Brunswick and his aunt Caroline of Brunswick, Queen of the United Kingdom\n\nCaroline of Brunswick was unhappily married to the future King George IV of the United Kingdom and was the mother of Princess Charlotte of Wales. After being famously turned away from her husband’s coronation, Caroline died a mere three weeks later, and her body was returned to Brunswick.\n\nTomb of Albert of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\nTombs of Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick\n\nTombs of Eleonore Charlotte Kettler (daughter of Frederick Casimir Kettler, Duke of Courland and Semigallia) and her husband Ernest Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern\n\nShared tomb of Gertrude of Brunswick the elder, Margravine of Meissen (d.1077), her grandson Egbert II, Margrave of Meissen and his sister Gertrude of Brunswick the younger, Margravine of Meissen (d.1117)\n\nTombs of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and his wife Mathilda of England\n\nTombs of Leopold of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Antoinette Amalie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. The heart urn contains the heart of Philippine Charlotte of Prussia, wife of Charles I.\n\nTomb of one-year-old Frederick William of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, son of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Antoinette Amalie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\nTombs of brothers Ludwig Ernest of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Frederick Francis of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\nThe so-called Welfentumba\n\nThis contains the bones of those buried in the nave before 1707. Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick, had his ancestors exhumed and buried together in this tomb. In this tomb is, among others, Beatrice of Swabia. Her original tomb is commemorated with a plaque, as you have seen above."
