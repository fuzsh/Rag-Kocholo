ROBERT the Strong (LAMBERT 1, RODBERT 2, THURINGBERT 3, RODBERT 4, ROBERT 5)\n\nd. 2 July 866 Battle of Brissarthe\n\nLittle is know of the origins of this family, however, it seems as though they had their origins in Hesbaye or Metz. During the reign of Louis the German they moved from East Francia to the west. No definite proof has so far been identified of the identity of Robert \"le Fort\" with the son of Robert Graf im Wormsgau. However, Regino provides possible indications of the ancestry of Robert \"le Fort\" in two passages, although they are not precise enough to exclude the possibility that they refer to relatives of Robert's wife. Firstly, he names \"Megingaudus comes, nepos supradicti Odonis regis (son of Robert)\" when recording his death in 892. Secondly, he names \"Waltgerius comes, nepos Odonis regis, filius scilicet avunculi eius Adalhelmi in Aquitanien\" when recording his battle against \"Ramnulfum et fratrem eius Gozbertum et Ebulonem abbatum de sancto Dionysio \" in Jul 892(2).\n\nRobert was named for the first time in Germany in 836, \"son of the late Rodbert Graf von Wormsgau\", as the donor of property at Mettenheim(1). Robert was named as lay abbot of Marmoutier in 852 (3).\n\nRobert was Margrave of Neustria and was first nominated by Charles the Bald missus dominicus in 853 for the provinces of Maine, Anjou and Touraine. The missus functioned as a intermediary between royal and local admistrations and supervised the administration of mostly justice in the king's dominions. He also had control of the ancient ducatus Cenomannicus, a duchy centered on Le Mans and corresponding to the regnum Neustriae. Robert's rise was designed to curb the power of the family of the Rorigonids and to defend Neustria against Viking and Breton raids.\n\nCharles the Bald invested Louis the Stammerer with the regnum Neustriae in 856 and compensated Robert for his losses by giving him the counties of Autun and Nevers in Burgundy. He had to defend Autun from Louis the German following the death of Lothair I, but, following the assassination in Nov. 857 of Erispoe, Duke of Brittany, Robert joined a revolt against the king leading the nobles of Neustria with the Bretons under Salomon and invited Louis the German to invade West Francia and receive their homage. Louis the German reached Orleans in Sept. 858 and received delegations from the Breton and Neustrian leaders as well as from Pepin II. The rebels had chased Louis the Stammerer from Le Mans earlier in the year. Charles the Bald made peace with Robert and appointed him Count of Anjou. In 862 Charles the Bald granted his son Louis the Stammerer the abbacy of St. Martin of Tours, a small benefice compared with the kingdom he had received in 856 and lost in 858. Louis then rebelled and was joined by Salomon who supplied troops for a war against Robert. Two groups of Vikings, one fleet recently forced out of the Seine by Charles the Bald and the other fleet returning from a Mediterranean expedition, were hired by Salomon to attack the Loire valley. Robert captured twelve of their ships and killed all on board. He then negotiated with the former Seine Vikings and hired them against Salomon for 6,000 livres. The peace between the Franks and the Vikings only lasted a year as in 863 Salomon made peace with the Vikings and they then turned on Neustria. Also in that year he had to defend Autun again from Louis the German. In 865 and 866 the Bretons and Vikings were ravaging the environs of Le Mans and Robert was killed at the Battle of Brissarthe on 2 July 866 fighting against Salomon and the Viking chief Hastein. During the battle, Robert had entrapped the Viking commander in a nearby church. Thinking he was not endangered, Robert took off his armour and began to besiege the church. Once Robert was unarmoured, the trapped Vikings launched a surprise attack and killed him before he had time to re-arm.(4) His success against the Vikings led to his heroic characterisation as \"a second Maccabaeus\" in the Annales Fuldenses.\n\nIssue-\n\n· I.

Robert was at the Siege of Paris in 885. He was appointed ruler of several counties by his brother, including the county of Paris and he was Abbot in Commendam of several abbeys. He became Dux Francorum, a high military honor. Robert did not claim the throne of Western Francia upon his brother's death in 898, but recognised the supremacy of the Carolingian king, Charles the Simple who confirmed his offices and possessions. He continued to serve King Charles, defending northern Francia from the attacks of the Norsemen until about 921 when Charles' rule and his partiality for Haganon, aroused considerable irritation. Supported by the clergy and some of the most powerful Frankish nobles, Robert took up arms against Charles and drove him into Lorraine and he was then crowned King of the Franks at Rheims on 29 June 922. Charles regrouped and on 15 June 923 at the Battle of Soissons, Robert was killed, according to one story, in single combat with his rival Charles.\n\nDenier of Robert I from the mint at Tours.\n\nIssue- first two children by Adele, last two by Beatrice.\n\n· I.

St. Denis\n\nHugh was the Great Duke of France as well as Count of Paris and Duke of Lower Burgundy.\n\nUpon the death of Rudolph, Duke of Burgundy in 936 Hugh was in possession of nearly all the region between the Loire and the Seine corresponding to Neustria with the exception of the territory ceded to the Normans in 911. He took an active part in bringing Louis IV, son of Charles the Simple, from his exile in England in 936, but in the same year Hugh married Hedwige of Saxony and soon quarrelled with Louis. At the time of Hugh's betrothal to Eadhilda he sent sumptuous gifts to King Athelstan including spices, jewels, horses, three holy relics and a gold crown.\n\nHugh even paid homage to the Emperor Otto the Great, and supported him in his struggle against Louis. When Louis fell into the hands of the Normans in 945, he was handed over to Hugh, who released him in 946 only on condition that he should surrender the fortress of Laon. At the council of Ingelheim in 948 Hugh was condemned, under pain of excommunication, to make reparation to Louis. It was not until 950 that he became reconciled with his suzerain and restored Laon. But new difficulties arose, and peace was not finally concluded until 953.\n\nOn the death of Louis IV, Hugh was one of the first to recognize Lothair as his successor, and, at the intervention of Queen Gerberga, was instrumental in having him crowned. In recognition of this service Hugh was invested by the new king with the duchies of Burgundy (his suzerainty over which had already been nominally recognized by Louis IV) and Aquitaine. But his expedition in 955 to take possession of Aquitaine was unsuccessful. In the same year, however, Giselbert, duke of Burgundy, acknowledged himself his vassal and betrothed his daughter to Hugh's son Otto. At Giselbert's death on 8 April 956, Hugh became effective master of the duchy, but died soon afterwards, on the 16 or 17 June 956, in Dourdan.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy Dante meets the soul of Duke Hugh in Purgatory, lamenting the avarice of his descendants. According to a prophecy, Saint Valery rewarded Hugh the Great, the father of Hugh Capet, for translating his body and that of Saint Riquier. To thank Hugh the Great, Saint Valery appeared to him in a dream and revealed that Hugh's descendants would reign as kings of France for seven generationsprecisely the amount of time between Hugh Capet and Philip Augustus.\n\nSaint Valery appears to Hugh the Great.

St. Denis Basilica\n\nDenier of Hugh Capet- Beauvais Mint\n\nHugh inherited his father estates and became one of the most powerful nobles in the West Frankish kingdom. However, since he was still a minor at his father's death, his uncle Bruno, Archbishop of Cologne, acted as regent. Of course his neighbors took advantage of this regency and Theobald of Blois took the counties of Chartres and Chateaudun and Fulk of Anjou carved out a principality for himself out of Hugh's lands and that of the Bretons.\n\nFrom 977 until 986 Hugh Capet allied himself with his cousins, the German emperors Otto II and Otto III and with Archbishop Adalberon of Rheims against King Lothair. By 986 Hugh was king in all but name. After Lothair and his son died in early 987, Adalberon and Gerbert of Aurillac convened an assembly of nobles to elect Hugh Capet as their king. In front of an electoral assembly at Senlis, Adalberon gave a stirring oration and pleaded to the nobles:\n\nCrown the Duke. He is most illustrious by his exploits, his nobility, his forces. The throne is not acquired by hereditary right; no one should be raised to it unless distinguished not only for nobility of birth, but for the goodness of his soul.\n\nHe was elected and crowned rex Francorum at Noyon in Picardy on 3 July 987, by the prelate of Reims, the first of the Capetian house. Immediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son Robert. Hugh's own claimed reason was that he was planning an expedition against the Moorish armies harassing Borrel II of Barcelona, an invasion which never occurred, and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition. Ralph Glaber, however, attributes Hugh's request to his old age and inability to control the nobility. Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December that same year.\n\nGenealogical tree for Hugh Capet. Ivo of Saint-Denis, Vita et Passio Sancti Dionysii\n\nHugh Capet possessed minor properties near Chartres and Angers. Between Paris and Orléans he possessed towns and estates amounting to approximately 400 square miles (1,000 km²). His authority ended there, and if he dared travel outside his small area, he risked being captured and held for ransom, though, as God's anointed, his life was largely safe. Indeed, there was a plot in 993, masterminded by Adalberon, Bishop of Laon and Odo I of Blois, to deliver Hugh Capet into the custody of Otto III. The plot failed, but the fact that no one was punished illustrates how tenuous his hold on power was. Beyond his power base, in the rest of France, there were still as many codes of law as there were fiefdoms. The \"country\" operated with 150 different forms of currency and at least a dozen languages. Uniting all this into one cohesive unit was a formidable task and a constant struggle between those who wore the crown of France and its feudal lords. As such, Hugh Capet's reign was marked by numerous power struggles with the vassals on the borders of the Seine and the Loire.\n\nWhile Hugh Capet's military power was limited and he had to seek military aid from Richard I of Normandy, his unanimous election as king gave him great moral authority and influence. Adémar de Chabannes records, probably apocryphally, that during an argument with the Count of Auvergne, Hugh demanded of him: \"Who made you count?\" The count riposted: \"Who made you king?\"\n\nHugh Capet\n\nHugh made Arnulf Archbishop of Reims in 988, even though Arnulf was the nephew of his bitter rival, Charles of Lorraine. Charles thereupon succeeded in capturing Reims and took the archbishop prisoner. Hugh, however, considered Arnulf a turncoat and demanded his deposition by Pope John XV. The turn of events outran the messages, when Hugh captured both Charles and Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991, which obediently deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Gerbert of Aurillac. These proceedings were repudiated by Rome, although a second synod had ratified the decrees issued at Reims. John XV summoned the French bishops to hold an independent synod outside the King's realm, at Aachen, to reconsider the case. When they refused, he called them to Rome, but they protested that the unsettled conditions en route and in Rome made that impossible. The Pope then sent a legate with instructions to call a council of French and German bishops at Mousson, where only the German bishops appeared, the French being stopped on the way by Hugh and Robert.\n\nThrough the exertions of the legate, the deposition of Arnulf was finally pronounced illegal. After Hugh's death, Arnulf was released from his imprisonment and soon restored to all his dignities.\n\nBasilica de St. Denis- Burial Place of Hugh Capet\n\nIssue-\n\n· 10I.

In 991, he helped his father prevent the French bishops from trekking to Mousson in the Kingdom of Germany for a synod called by Pope John XV, with whom Hugh was then in disagreement.\n\nAs early as 989, having been rebuffed in his search for a Byzantine princess, Hugh Capet arranged for Robert to marry the recently-widowed daughter of Berengar II of Italy, Rozala, who took the name of Susannah upon becoming Queen. She was many years his senior. She was the widow of Arnulf II of Flanders, with whom she had children, the oldest of whom was of age to assume the offices of count of Flanders. Robert divorced her within a year of his father's death. He tried instead to marry Bertha, daughter of Conrad of Burgundy, around the time of his father's death. She was a widow of Odo I of Blois, but was also Robert's cousin. For reasons of consanguinity, Pope Gregory V refused to sanction the marriage, and Robert was excommunicated. After long negotiations with Gregory's successor, Sylvester II, the marriage was annulled.\n\nFinally, in 1001, Robert entered into his final and longest-lasting marriage: to Constance of Arles, the daughter of William I of Provence. She was an ambitious and scheming woman, who made life miserable for her husband by encouraging her sons to revolt against their father.\n\nRobert, despite his marital problems, was a very devout Catholic, hence his sobriquet \"the Pious.\" He was musically inclined, being a composer, chorister, and poet, and making his palace a place of religious seclusion, where he conducted the matins and vespers in his royal robes. However, to contemporaries, Robert's \"piety\" also resulted from his lack of toleration for heretics.\n\nThe kingdom Robert inherited was not large, and in an effort to increase his power, he vigorously pursued his claim to any feudal lands which became vacant, which action usually resulted in war with a counter-claimant. In 1003, his invasion of the Duchy of Burgundy was thwarted and it would not be until 1016 that he was finally able to get the support of the Church and be recognized as Duke of Burgundy.\n\nThe pious Robert made few friends and many enemies, including his own sons: Hugh Magnus, Henry, and Robert. They turned against their father in a civil war over power and property. Hugh died in revolt in 1025. In a conflict with Henry and the younger Robert, King Robert's army was beaten and he retreated to Beaugency outside Paris, his capital. He died in the middle of the war with his sons on 20 July 1031 at Melun and was buried with Constance in Saint Denis Basilica. Robert was succeeded by his son Henry, in both France and Burgundy.\n\nIssue-\n\n·I. Hugh Magnus- b. 1007, d. 17 Sept. 1025\n\n· 11II.

He had little influence and power until he became sole ruler on his father's death.\n\nThe reign of Henry I, like those of his predecessors, was marked by territorial struggles. Initially, he joined his brother Robert, with the support of their mother, in a revolt against his father in 1025. His mother, however, supported Robert as heir to the old king, on whose death Henry was left to deal with his rebel sibling. In 1032, he placated his brother by giving him the duchy of Burgundy which his father had given him in 1016.\n\nIn an early strategic move, Henry came to the rescue of his very young nephew-in-law, the newly appointed Duke William of Normandy (who would go on to become William the Conqueror), to suppress a revolt by William's vassals. In 1047, Henry secured the dukedom for William in their decisive victory over the vassals at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes near Caen.\n\nA few years later, when William, who was cousin to King Edward the Confessor of England, married Matilda, the daughter of the count of Flanders, Henry feared William's potential power. In 1054, and again in 1057, Henry went to war to try to conquer Normandy from William, but on both occasions he was defeated. Despite his efforts, Henry I's twenty-nine-year reign saw feudal power in France reach its pinnacle.\n\nHenry had three meetings with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, all at Ivois. In early 1043, he met him to discuss the marriage of the emperor with Agnes of Poitou, the daughter of Henry's vassal. In October 1048, the two Henries met again, but the subject of this meeting eludes us. The final meeting took place in May 1056. It concerned disputes over Lorraine. The debate over the duchy became so heated that the king of France challenged his German counterpart to single combat. The emperor, however, was not so much a warrior and he fled in the night, despite this, Henry did not get Lorraine.\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Matilda, King Henry searched the courts of Europe for a suitable bride, but could not locate a princess who was not related to him within illegal degrees of kinship. At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, which returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna). Anne and Henry were married at the cathedral of Reims on 19 May 1051.\n\nKing Henry I died on 4 August 1060 in Vitry-en-Brie, France, and was buried in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Philip I of France, who was 7 at the time of his death.\n\nFor six years after Henry's death in 1060, Queen Anne served as regent for Philip, who was only seven at the time. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent.\n\nA year after the king's death, Anne, acting as regent, took a passionate fancy for Count Ralph III of Valois, a man whose political ambition encouraged him to repudiate his wife to marry Anne in 1062. Accused of adultery, Ralph's wife appealed to Pope Alexander II, who excommunicated the couple. The young king Philip forgave his mother, which was just as well, since he was to find himself in a very similar predicament in the 1090s. Ralph died in September 1074, at which time Anne returned to the French court. She died in 1075, was buried at Villiers Abbey, La-Ferte-Alais, Essonne and her obits were celebrated on 5 September.\n\nIn 1717, Tsar Peter the Great stopped in the cathedral in Reims where the French monarchs were crowned. He was shown the missal on which all French kings since the 11th century swore their coronation oaths. To everyone's surprise, he began reading from the missal which was written in Old Church Slavonic, the ancestor of all literary Slavonic languages, and used in Christian Orthodox Churches during the services; its function was the same as Latin in Western Europe.\n\nAnna had brought the missal with her from Kiev to the Church where she and Henry had taken their vows. All French monarchs, save the Bonapartes, were crowned after swearing their oaths on it.\n\n11th-century fresco of the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev representing the daughters of Yaroslav I, with Anna probably being the youngest.

Cathedral of St. Paul, Tarsus\n\nHugh \"the Great\" was an ineffectual leader and soldier, great only in his boasting. Indeed, Steven Runciman is certain that his nickname Magnus (greater or elder), applied to him by William of Tyre, is a copyist's error, and should be Minus (younger), referring to Hugh as younger brother of the King of France. Hugh succeeded as Comte de Vermandois et de Valois by right of his wife. In early 1096 Hugh and Philip began discussing the First Crusade after news of the Council of Clermont reached them in Paris. Although Philip could not participate, as he had been excommunicated, Hugh was said to have been influenced to join the Crusade after an eclipse of the moon on February 11, 1096.\n\nThat summer Hugh's army left France for Italy, where they would cross the Adriatic Sea into territory of the Byzantine Empire, unlike the other Crusader armies who were travelling by land. On the way, many of the soldiers led by fellow Crusader Emicho joined Hugh's army after Emicho was defeated by the Hungarians, whose land he had been pillaging. Hugh crossed the Adriatic from Bari in Southern Italy, but many of his ships were destroyed in a storm off the Byzantine port of Dyrrhachium.\n\nHugh and most of his army was rescued and escorted to Constantinople by the Byzantine admiral Manuel Butumites. They arrived in Constantinople in November of 1096. Prior to his arrival, Hugh sent an arrogant, insulting letter to Eastern Roman Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, according to the Emperor's biography by his daughter (the Alexiad), demanding that Alexius meet with him:\n\n\"Know, O King, that I am King of Kings, and superior to all, who are under the sky. You are now permitted to greet me, on my arrival, and to receive me with magnificence, as befits my nobility.\"\n\nAlexius was already wary of the armies about to arrive, after the unruly mob led by Peter the Hermit had passed through earlier in the year. Alexius kept Hugh in custody in a monastery until Hugh swore an oath of vassalage to him.\n\nAfter the Crusaders had successfully made their way across Seljuk territory and, in 1098, captured Antioch, Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. Alexius was uninterested, however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the siege of Jerusalem, went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the minor Crusade of 1101, but was wounded in battle with the Turks in September, and died of his wounds in October in Tarsus.\n\nIssue-\n\n· 13I. ELIZABETH/ISABEL- b.c.1081, m.1.
