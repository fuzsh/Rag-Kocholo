        "text": "Saint-Epvre basilica and Square. The market square and general trading centre in the Middle Ages, the fountain in the middle has a statue of Duke René II of Lorraine, who defeated Charles the bold, Duke of Burgundy, at the Battle of Nancy in 1477. Built in the 19th Century by Prosper Morey, Saint-Epvre’s Basilica is decorated with stained glass and wood panelling in part made in Bavaria. It was richly endowed by Napoleon III, Emperor Franz-Joseph, Ludwig II of Bavaria and Pope Pius... who donated the beautiful stone paving in the choir that came from the Appian Way. The Saint Epvre Church towers above one of the largest and busiest squares in the old town. Up till the end of the 19th century the square with its fountain topped by a statue of Duke Rene II was the site of the town's market. The present-day Basilica (it is not the cathedral) was built in the second half of the 19th century in the current gothic revival style. Among its generous donors were Napoleon III of France and the Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria. Much of the interior decoration was due to artists from numerous European countries.\n\nThe New Town\n\nFounded by Duke Charles III in 1588, with its streets all at right angles the New Town has a totally different layout from the Old. It has its own market square and a famous parish church: the Primatial (today’s Cathedral). It was in a position to rival the Old Town as it even had its own independent fortifications. The New Town is in the process of being restored today."
