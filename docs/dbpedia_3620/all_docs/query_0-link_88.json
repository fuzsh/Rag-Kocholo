        "text": "A 10-year-old boy who died in prison in 1795 was Louis XVII, titular king of France, scientists say.\n\nOn June 8, 1795, as France was in the throes of revolution, a 10-year-old boy succumbed to tuberculosis in the drafty tower of the Temple prison and one of the great mysteries of French history began.\n\nWas this unfortunate child the Dauphin, sole surviving son of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, both of whom had been executed by republicans on the guillotine? Or was he a stand-in, with the heir to the throne of France having been spirited away to safety?\n\nOn Wednesday, modern DNA analysis in laboratories in Belgium and Germany provided what should be the decisive answer to this enigma: The unfortunate little prisoner, the researchers concurred, was in fact the Dauphin. For before the boy was buried in a common grave in eastern Paris two days after his death, the surgeon who performed the autopsy removed and kept the heart, wrapping it in a handkerchief and carrying it away in his pocket.\n\nMore than two centuries later, tissue from that withered organ has solved the riddle, in what Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, the dean of French historians, called a \"magnificent conquest\" for both science and history.\n\nFor 29 months, after his father, Louis XVI, was beheaded on the present-day Place de la Concorde, young Louis Charles of France was recognized by his mother and such European powers as Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia as Louis XVII, rightful ruler of France. And throughout the 19th century, no fewer than 43 people surfaced who claimed to be the Dauphin.\n\nThe pretenders included a stable boy, a convicted murderer, a mason, a field marshal and an American colonel. In Mark Twain's 1884 novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, one of the most colorful characters, an itinerant con artist, also says he is the Dauphin, son of \"Looy the Sixteen\" and \"Marry Antonette.\"\n\nThe most persuasive claimant of all, Berlin clockmaker Karl Wilhelm Naundorff, died in 1845 in the Netherlands and was even given an official death certificate by the Dutch identifying him as Louis XVII.\n\n\"I knew five respectable people who were convinced they were members of the royal family,\" said the Duke of Bauffrement, France's relics custodian and the man who commissioned the DNA investigation. \"Three of them were completely crazy, but two were very solid.\"\n\nIf the victim in the tower was indeed the Dauphin, it was a somber page in the annals of the fledgling French republic. \"I am not against the Revolution, but these people were exterminating a clan, and that's very shocking,\" Le Roy Ladurie said in an interview. But the belief that the boy was an impostor allowed France's small but devoted contingent of royalists to hope that a direct living link with the main branch of the Bourbons still remained.\n\nThe doctor who performed the autopsy, Philippe-Jean Pelletan, placed the dead child's heart in a crystal vase filled with ethyl alcohol, and it stayed for 15 years on his shelf. It was stolen by one of his students, then returned, and finally given to the archdiocese of Paris for safekeeping.\n\nIn 1830, as yet another republican revolution shook Paris, the building where the heart was kept was burned down. Pelletan's son, also a physician, later found the shards of the crystal vase, and the heart, buried under a pile of sand.\n\nThe organ, now as desiccated and hard as a piece of wood, has been preserved in a crystal urn in the crypt of the basilica of Saint-Denis north of Paris, resting place of the kings and queens of France, since 1975. In December, two small tissue samples were compared with DNA extracted from the locks of hair preserved from the Dauphin's mother, Marie Antoinette, two of the ill-fated queen's sisters and contemporary descendants of the Hapsburg dynasty, to which the Austrian-born Marie Antoinette belonged.\n\nOn Wednesday, the researchers who performed the DNA tests, Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the University of Louvain's center for human genetics in Belgium and Ernst Brinckmann of the University of Munster in Germany, issued their findings.\n\nIn the heart tissue, \"the two scientists found more DNA than they thought,\" reported historian Philippe Delorme, who had the idea for the analysis. He said the DNA tests also turned up positive with two living Hapsburgs.\n\nThe Dauphin, in fact, may have been sired by Marie Antoinette's Swedish lover, the Count Axel von Fersen, Louis XVI being notorious for his lack of virility.\n\nHe was born March 27, 1785, with the title of duke of Normandy, and became Dauphin, or heir to the throne of France, upon the natural death in 1789 of his older brother, Louis Joseph, duke of Burgundy.\n\nOn Jan. 21, 1793, 3{ years after revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison in Paris, Louis XVI was guillotined. For five months, the royal family had been imprisoned in the Temple, the former Paris quarters of the Knights Templar. Upon his father's death, the Dauphin was 8.\n\nIn a decision now difficult to interpret as anything other than needlessly cruel, the Committee of Public Safety, the main instrument of anti-royalist terror, ordered that the Dauphin should be taken away from Marie Antoinette and kept isolated in a well-guarded tower of the Temple. Historians say there were several rival plans to get the boy out _ by monarchists who dreamed of a restoration, but also by republicans who wanted him as a hostage.\n\nThe official cause of death was ruled as tuberculosis, but there are widespread suspicions that, at the very least, his captors let him die to extinguish the royal bloodline. The death certificate was made out to \"Louis Charles Capet, son of Louis Capet, last king of the French.\"\n\n_ Information from the Washington Post was used in this report."
