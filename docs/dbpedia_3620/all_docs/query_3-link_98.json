        "text": "favorite\n\nMary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nLouis, Duke of Burgundy\n\nLOUIS, DUKE OF BURGUNDY - French son of Louis de France and later Grand-Dauphin to Louis XIV (his Grandfather) Date: 1682 - 1712\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 14274728\n\n© Mary Evans Picture Library\n\n1682 1712 Burgundy Dauphin Grandfather\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis striking portrait captures the young and ambitious Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1682-1712), the eldest son of Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans. Born into the French royal family, Louis was the grandson of King Louis XIV and held the title of Grand Dauphin from 1683 until his father's death in 1711. The Duke of Burgundy was known for his military prowess and political acumen. He served as a general in the War of the Spanish Succession and played a significant role in the diplomatic negotiations that followed. His marriage to Maria Anna of Austria in 1685 was a strategic alliance aimed at strengthening the House of Bourbon's position in Europe. Despite his impressive military and political achievements, Louis' reign as Dauphin was marked by intrigue and power struggles. He was a favorite of his grandfather, King Louis XIV, but his relationship with the regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, was fraught with tension. The Duke of Burgundy's untimely death in 1712, just a year after his father, left the French succession uncertain and led to the Regency of Philippe II. This portrait, created around 1682, captures the Duke of Burgundy in his prime. He is depicted in the regal attire of the time, with a serious expression and a confident posture. The artist has skillfully captured the young man's strong features and the intensity of his gaze, reflecting his determination and ambition. The portrait is a testament to the Duke of Burgundy's status as a powerful and influential figure in French and European politics during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nSAFE SHIPPING\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
