DUKES of BURGUNDY [918]-956\n\nA. DUKES of BURGUNDY 918-952\n\nRICHARD, son of comte BUVINUS [Bouvin] & his wife --- d'Arles (-[31 Aug or 1 or 29 Sep] 921, bur Abbaye de Sainte-Colombe de Sens, Yonne) . The Annales Bertiniani name \"Richardus frater Bosonis\" when recording that, after the capture of Vienne by the forces of King Carloman, he took uxorem Bosonis et filiam eius back to comitatum suum Augustudensem in 882 . Gingins-la-Sarra suggests that Richard was the uterine brother of King Boson, their mother having married secondly Theoderic [VI] le Trésorier Comte d´Autun (see the document CAROLINGIAN NOBILITY) . He refers to the testament dated to [Jan 876] of Ekkehard Comte d´Autun, possibly the brother of Theoderic [VI], which names \" Theoderico et Richardo filio eius \" among the beneficiaries . He identifies Richardo with the future duke of Burgundy, although there seems to be no basis for assuming that this co-identity is correct other than the name. The name Richard is well-established in the Bosonid family, which does not appear to be the case in the Theoderic/Nibelung family to which Theoderic [VI] belonged, where it was probably recently introduced through Theoderic´s wife (Settipani suggests that she was the sister of King Boson´s father ). In addition, Richard Duke of Burgundy named one of his sons Boson, although this is not conclusive for establishing his paternity as the name also appears in Duke Richard´s maternal line. On the other hand, none of the typical names of the Theoderic/Nibelung family appear among the descendants of Duke Richard. In any case, the chronology does not appear favourable. Richard is named as count in 876 (see below). If he had been King Boson´s uterine brother, he could not have been more than ten years old at the time, which is incompatible with his bearing the comital title. Gingins-la-Sarra´s hypothesis cannot be dismissed entirely. However, it is a convoluted interpretation of the otherwise simple statement in the Annales Bertiniani that Richard was King Boson´s brother. Unless further information comes to light in other sources, it is suggested that the simple explanation is the best. An agreement dated Feb 876 of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks names \"Bosonis ducis et sacri palatii archiministri atque imperiali missi, Richardi comitis \" as present in Italy with the king, although it fails to specify the family relationship between them . \"Richardus comes\" is named as present in a charter dated 4 Sep 876 under which Emperor Charles II \"le Chauve\" granted property \"villam Piredus in pago Senonico\" . He presumably assumed the role of his brother Boson as missus in Italy in early 877, when the latter was recalled by Emperor Charles II. \"Richardi comitis, Teutbaldi comitis, Bernardi comitis\" subscribed the charter dated 25 Jul 879 under which \"Boso et coniunx mea Hirmingardi proles imperiales\" donated property \"in pago Laticense in villa Lantinus\" to the abbey of Montiérender . Comte dAutun. At first sight, this might appear to provide the missing connection with Theoderic [VI], who was also Comte d´Autun. However, it is recorded that King Boson disputed Theoderic´s right to the county, in which case it is unlikely that he would have awarded it to Theoderic´s son. Richard established himself in the future duchy of Burgundy, north of his brother's realm, with his capital at Autun. Carlomannus Rex restored property villam Taniacum to the church of Autun, at the request of Richardi Comiti Augustodensis, by charter dated 1 Dec 880, the text ending with Theodoricus Comes ambasciavit . He was invested as lay abbot of Saint-Symphorien by Carloman King of the East Franks in 880. He led the Carolingian army which besieged his brother King Boson at Vienne in 882. The counties in Burgundy, except Mâcon, submitted to him. He succeeded his wife's uncle Hugues l'Abbé as Comte d'Auxerre in 886. He was later known as RICHARD \"le Justicier\" Duke of Burgundy, although it is unlikely that he was considered at the time as founder of a unified duchy of Burgundy as such, rather as the suzerain of various counties who held the title \"duke\". \"Richardo marchione eius filiis Rodulpho, Hugone atque Bosone comitibus\" were present at the restitution of property at \"Tiliniaco et Canavis\" by charter dated 5 Sep 916 (anno XIX = reign of Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks) . Guillaume de Jumièges records that Rollo besieged Carnotenam urbem [Chartres] but was forced to withdraw by \"Richardus Burgundionum dux...cum...Antelmus episcopus\" . Ricardus comes et dux Burgondiæ, on the advice of Manasse ceterorumque fidelium nostrorum, restored de Liciaco [Lecey] villa...in pago Lingonico, previously donated by Amadeus comes in suo nomine et uxoris suæ, necnon et filii eius Anscharii, to Langres by charter dated 18 May 918, subscribed by uxoris nostræ atque filiorum fideliumque nostrorum...Adoelehit...Ugo...Rodulfus...Boso...Aldo...Vuilingus...Vualterius...Vuitbodus...Odolbertus...Gotafredus . A charter dated 5 Sep 918 records the restitution of res Sancti Nazarii sitas in villa...Canavas ad Tiliniacum to the church of Autun, in the presence of Domno Richardo...Marchione...et...illius filiis Rodulfo atque Bozone . The death of \"Richardus marchio de Burgundia\" is recorded by Flodoard in 921 . The Annales S. Benigni Divionensis record the death \"II Kal Sep 921\" of \"Ricardus comes\" . The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death \"Kal Sep\" of \"Richardus dux Burgundiæ\", and his burial \"in basilica sanctæ Columbæ\" . The sacrementaire of Sens cathedral records the death \"III Kal Oct\" of \"Ricardi comitis\" . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 1 Sep of \"Richardus comes\" .\n\nm ([887/88]) ADELAIS, daughter of CONRAD Marquis of Transjurania [Welf] & his wife Waldrada --- (-after 14 Jul 929). \"Adeleth comitissa\" donated property \"villam Poligniacum in comitatu Warasco\" to Autun naming \"filii mei Hugonis comitis\" by charter dated 24 Apr 922, subscribed by \"Hugo comes, Rodulphus comes, Boso comes\" and witnessed by \"Wallonis comitis \" . Her origin is deduced by her being named as sister of \"Rodulfi regis\" (Rudolf I King of Burgundy) in the latter's 10 Jun 888 charter , as well as in her own 14 Jan 929 grant to Cluny, the 929 charter also naming \"Richardi principis domni mei\" . Ricardus comes et dux Burgondiæ restored de Liciaco [Lecey] villa...in pago Lingonico to Langres by charter dated 18 May 918, subscribed by uxoris nostræ atque filiorum fideliumque nostrorum...Adoelehit...Ugo...Rodulfus...Boso... . After her husband died, she retired to a monastery. She transferred the monastery of Roman-Moutier to the monastery of Cluny by charter dated 14 Jul 929 .\n\n[Mistress (1): ---. As mentioned below, it is likely that Duke Richard's son Gebuin was illegitimate. If this is correct, the name of his mistress is not known.]\n\nDuke Richard & his wife had [four] children:\n\n1. RODOLPHE [Raoul] (-Auxerre, Yonne 15/16 Jan 936, bur église de l'abbaye de Sainte-Colombe de Sens) . Flodoard names \"Rodulfo filio Richardi\" . \"Richardo marchione eius filiis Rodulpho, Hugone atque Bosone comitibus\" were present at the restitution of property at \"Tiliniaco et Canavis\" by charter dated 5 Sep 916 (anno XIX = reign of Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks) . Ricardus comes et dux Burgondiæ restored de Liciaco [Lecey] villa...in pago Lingonico to Langres by charter dated 18 May 918, subscribed by uxoris nostræ atque filiorum fideliumque nostrorum...Adoelehit...Ugo...Rodulfus...Boso... : the reason for Rodolphe/Raoul to follow Hugues in this document is unclear, when all other sources seem to indicate that Rodolphe/Raoul was the oldest brother. A charter dated 5 Sep 918 records the restitution of res Sancti Nazarii sitas in villa...Canavas ad Tiliniacum to the church of Autun, in the presence of Domno Richardo...Marchione...et...illius filiis Rodulfo atque Bozone . He is named \"Rodulfo rex filio meo\" in the grant of \"Adeleydis comitissa soror Rodulfi\" to Cluny dated 14 Jun 929 . Rodulfus Glaber names \"Rodulfus, Richardi ducis Burgundiæ filius\" . He succeeded his father in 921 as RAOUL Duke of Burgundy. He was elected as RAOUL King of France in 923 to succeed his father-in-law, consecrated by Gauthier Archbishop of Sens at the abbey of Saint-Médard de Soissons. Flodoard records in 923 that, after King Charles III had retreated \"trans Mosam\", Rodulfum...regem...[filius Richardi] was elected and consecrated apud urbem Suessonicam . Flodoard records in 936 (as the second report in that year) the death of rex Rodulfus and his burial Senonis apud sanctam Columbam . The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death \"XVIII Kal Feb\" of \"Rodulfo rege\", specifying his burial \"in basilica aanctæ Columbæ\" . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 14 Jan of \"Rodulphus rex\" . m ([911/19]) EMMA, daughter of ROBERT \"le Fort\" Marquis en Neustrie, Comte de Paris [later Robert I King of France] & his [first/second wife ---] (-2 Nov 934). Flodoard names \"Emma regis Rotberti filia\" when recording that she obliged Seulf Archbishop of Reims to consecrate her queen at Reims in 923 in the absence of her husband fighting . Rodulfus Glaber names \"Emmam sororem magni Hugonis\" as wife of \"Rodulfus, Richardi ducis Burgundiæ filius\", suggesting that she was instrumental in persuading her brother to support her husband's accession as king . \"Emme nostri imperii consortis\" and \"Emma coniux mea\" is named in the charters of \"Rodolfus Francorum rex\" dated 21 Jun 931 and 1 Jul 931 . Flodoard records the death of \"Emma regina\" at the end of his passage dated 934 . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"IV Non Nov\" of \"domna Emma regina\" . King Raoul & his wife had two children:\n\na) LOUIS (-before 14 Jun 929). The Chronicle of St Bénigne de Dijon records that \"Rodulfo rege filius eius Ludovicus ex Emma regina\" died before his father, the latter dying \"absque liberis\" . He must have died before his paternal grandmother's 929 grant to Cluny as he is not named among the witnesses, unlike his presumed sister.\n\nb) [JUDITH (-([14 Jun 929/935]). \"Juditte filie Rodulfe regis\" witnessed the grant of \"Adeleydis comitissa soror Rodulfi\" to Cluny dated 14 Jun 929 . Settipani assumes that this indicates that she was the daughter of Raoul King of France, but this is not beyond doubt. The charter in fact refers to three individuals named \"Rodulfi regis\", the donor's brother Rudolf I King of Burgundy, her nephew Rudolf II King of Burgundy, and her son. The last named is referred to in the witness list, in a later position than the entry naming Judith, as \"augusti Rodulfi regis\", which may suggest that he was a different \"Rodulfi regis\" from the one who was Judith's father. If Judith had been the daughter of Rudolf I King of Burgundy, it is most likely that she would have been named \"soror Rodulfe regis\" in the subscription, referring to her living brother. The most likely possibility is that she was the daughter of Rudolf II King of Burgundy, presumably his oldest child and the only one who at the date of the charter was considered old enough to have witnessed the document. If it is correct that Judith was the daughter of Raoul King of France, she must have predeceased her father if the Chronicle of St Bénigne de Dijon is right when it says that he died \"absque liberis\" .]\n\n2. [ERMENGARDE (-after 9 Dec 943) . Ermengarde, wife of Giselbert, has been accepted as the daughter of Duke Richard since Du Chesne in 1625 . More recently this affiliation has been challenged, in particular because she is not mentioned in her supposed mother's will . In addition, if it is correct that Giselbert's mother was the daughter of King Boson (see the document BURGUNDIAN NOBILITY), she would have been her husband's first cousin, which seems unlikely to have been accepted by the church. \"Ermengars\" sold land in Colonicas (pago Matisconense), with her husband \"Gillevertus\", by charter dated May 926 . Gislebertus...comes Heduensis atque aliarum patriarum, at the request of Roberti Divionensis, granted property to suo fidele Guitbaldus... by charter dated III Id Dec Indictione XIV anno VII regnante Ludovico rege [dated to 942 by Duchesne, probably 943, follow her husbands hyperlink for the explanation], subscribed by Gisleberti comitis, Ermengardi quæ consensit, Adaleidis filie eorum similiter quæ consensit... . m (before May 926) GISELBERT, son of MANASSES Comte de Vergy & his wife --- (-956). He became GISELBERT Duke of Burgundy, after Raoul and Hugues \"le Noir\" ceded him their rights to Burgundy in [936]. After his death, Lothaire King of France took direct control of his part of Burgundy .]\n\n3.HUGUES \"le Noir\" (-17 Dec 952, bur Besançon) . Flodoard names \"Hugo filius Richardi\" . The recent study made by Marcellin Babey analyses the known surviving primary sources in which Hugues le Noir was named, distinguishes him from numerous other contemporaries named Hugues, and provides important background material concerning Burgundy . Comte in the area outre-Saône, the future Franche-Comté, before 914. \"Richardo marchione eius filiis Rodulpho, Hugone atque Bosone comitibus\" were present at the restitution of property at \"Tiliniaco et Canavis\" by charter dated 5 Sep 916 (anno XIX = reign of Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks) . Ricardus comes et dux Burgondiæ restored de Liciaco [Lecey] villa...in pago Lingonico to Langres by charter dated 18 May 918, subscribed by uxoris nostræ atque filiorum fideliumque nostrorum...Adoelehit...Ugo...Rodulfus...Boso... . A charter dated 18 Jan 926 records that femina Bertagia claimed res...sitas in pago Equestrico, et in curte Avenaco, de res que de parte jugale suo...Alteo...et filio suo...Alteo from Leutardus, that Rodolphe III King of Burgundy ordered Turumbertum comitem et Anselmum comitem de pago Equestrico, atque Ugonem comte palatio to enquire into the matter, that Leutardus et Teodoricus vel ipsa femina attended a hearing at which ipsa...femina claimed that \"Ugo comes filius Ricardi et germanus suus Giboinus\" had granted the property to her husband, calling named witnesses . He is named \"Huguone aliis quoque filiis meis\" in the grant by \"Adeleydis comitissa soror Rodulfi\" to Cluny dated 14 Jun 929, listed before Boson . Comte de Mâcon from 931. \"Hugonis frater meus\" is named by \"Rodulfus Francorum rex\" in the latter's 1 Jul 931 charter . \"Hugo...comes et marchio\" donated property \"in comitatu Belnensi...in uilla...Nolliacus et...in uilla Crisentiaco\", for the souls of genitoris nostri Richardi et Adheleidis, in the presence of Gilbertus comes, Albericus comes et filius eius Leotaldus et Adso noster fidelis, by charter dated 1 Sep 936, subscribed by ...Roberti uicecomitis... . After the death of his brother King Raoul in 936, he and Hugues \"le Blanc/le Grand\" Capet, and his possible brother-in-law Giselbert, divided Burgundy between them. He was seen by Hugues \"le Grand\" Capet as a potentially too powerful candidate for the French throne after his brother's death in 936, prompting Hugues to recall the future King Louis IV \"d'Outremer\" from England, whom Hugues \"le Noir\" refused to recognise as king until 938 . He is named \"nostri principes alter Hugo dux scilicet Burgundionum\" in a charter of \"Ludovicus rex\" dated 1 Jul 946 . The Chronicon Floriacensi records the death in 952 of \"Ugo Dux Burgundionum et Alanus Brittonum\" .\n\n4.BOSON (-Sep 935, bur Reims, église de l'abbaye de Saint-Rémi) . Flodoard names \"Boso filius Richardi\" . \"Richardo marchione eius filiis Rodulpho, Hugone atque Bosone comitibus\" were present at the restitution of property at \"Tiliniaco et Canavis\" by charter dated 5 Sep 916 (anno XIX = reign of Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks) . Ricardus comes et dux Burgondiæ restored de Liciaco [Lecey] villa...in pago Lingonico to Langres by charter dated 18 May 918, subscribed by uxoris nostræ atque filiorum fideliumque nostrorum...Adoelehit...Ugo...Rodulfus...Boso... . A charter dated 5 Sep 918 records the restitution of res Sancti Nazarii sitas in villa...Canavas ad Tiliniacum to the church of Autun, in the presence of Domno Richardo...Marchione...et...illius filiis Rodulfo atque Bozone . He is named \"Bosone aliis quoque filiis meis\" in the grant of \"Adeleydis comitissa soror Rodulfi\" to Cluny dated 14 Jun 929, listed after Hugues . Comte in Upper Burgundy, lay abbot of Moyenmoutiers. He was killed at the siege of Saint-Quentin, Aisne against Hugues \"le Grand\" Capet . m ([928], separated) as her first husband, BERTA d'Arles, daughter of BOSO Comte d'Arles, later Marchese of Tuscany, & his wife Willa --- (-after 18 Aug 965). \"Bertam, Willam, Richildam et Gislam\" are named (in order) as the four daughters of Boso and Willa by Liutprand , who in a later passage names Berta as \"Bosonis Arelatensis comitis viduæ\" and mentions her marriage soon after the death of her first husband to Raymond, by virtue of which she was deemed guilty of incest . She married secondly ([936]) Raymond Comte de Rouergue Marquis de Septimanie, who became Duke of Aquitaine in 936.\n\nDuke Richard had one child [probably illegitimate] by [Mistress (1)]:\n\n5.GEBUIN . A charter dated 18 Jan 926 records that femina Bertagia claimed res...sitas in pago Equestrico, et in curte Avenaco, de res que de parte jugale suo...Alteo...et filio suo...Alteo from Leutardus, that Rodolphe III King of Burgundy ordered Turumbertum comitem et Anselmum comitem de pago Equestrico, atque Ugonem comte palatio to enquire into the matter, that Leutardus et Teodoricus vel ipsa femina attended a hearing at which ipsa...femina claimed that \"Ugo comes filius Ricardi et germanus suus Giboinus\" had granted the property to her husband, calling named witnesses . It is likely that he was illegitimate as he is mentioned in none of the sources which list the other brothers of Hugues.\n\n- COMTES de DIJON, COMTES d'ATUYER.\n\nB. DUKE of BURGUNDY 936-956\n\nGISELBERT, son of MANASSES Comte [de Dijon] & his wife Ermengarde --- (-Paris after Easter 956) . The parentage of Giselbert is confirmed by a combination of documents: \"Hirmingardis comitissa Walonis filii eius, Gilleberti filii eius alterius\" subscribed the testament of \"Heriveus Æduorum episcopus\" dated 1 Nov 919 which names \"genitricis nostræ domnæ Hirmingardis venerabilis comitissæ et fratrum nostrorum domnus Walo pius Præsul et noster avunculus\" ; the Vita Sanctii Viventii Presbyteri names \"Manasses filius Gislebertus eiusdem Burgundiæ Dux\" ; \"Warulfus virum nobilem filio equivoco eius Warulfo\" petitioned \"Ermengardis comitisse seu filii eius Gisleberti comitis\" for some donated property of Saint-Marcel-lès-Chalon by charter dated Jun 924 . Flodoard records that in 924 \"Raginardus\" captured \"castellum Mons sancti Iohannis\" supported by \"nepotum suorum, Walonis et Gisleberti\", but that \"Rodulfi rex\" recaptured the castle later in the same year . \"Gisleberto comiti\" is named in a charter of \"Vuarulfo\" dated 5 Jun 926 . \"Hugo...comes et marchio\" donated property \"in comitatu Belnensi...in uilla...Nolliacus et...in uilla Crisentiaco\", for the souls of genitoris nostri Richardi et Adheleidis, in the presence of Gilbertus comes, Albericus comes et filius eius Leotaldus et Adso noster fidelis, by charter dated 1 Sep 936, subscribed by ...Roberti uicecomitis... . He became GISELBERT Duke of Burgundy, after his possible brothers-in-law Raoul and Hugues \"le Noir\" ceded him their rights to Burgundy in [936]. Comte dAutun: Gislebertus...comes Heduensis atque aliarum patriarum, at the request of Roberti Divionensis, granted property to suo fidele Guitbaldus... by charter dated III Id Dec Indictione XIV anno VII regnante Ludovico rege [dated to 942 by Duchesne], subscribed by Gisleberti comitis, Ermengardi quæ consensit, Adaleidis filie eorum similiter quæ consensit, Rodberti...Hengeltrudis, Rodulfi filii prædicti Roberti... . This charter is dated to 11 Dec 934 by the editor of the Dijon Saint-Etienne cartulary . The difficulty appears to lie in calculating the regnal years of King Louis IV: although this charter is not listed by Prou, he shows other charters dated anno VI and anno VIII which he attributes to 942-944 (although the Induction years are inconsistent) , suggesting that 943 is the more likely date. The Annales Nivernenses record the death \"apud Parisius post pascha 956\" of \"Gislebertus comes\" . The Chronico Senonensi Sanctæ Columbæ records that \"Gisleberto Principe Burgundionum\" died \"feria tertia post Pascha\" . The Chronicon of Odorannus records the death in 956 of Gislebertus comes Burgundionem, adding that honorem eius cum filia...Leudegarde, ex qua postea a Radulpho Divionensi pipicus factus est was received by Otho frater Hugonis ducis . After Giselbert died, Lothaire King of the West Franks asserted control over the duchy of Burgundy .\n\nm (before May 926) ERMENGARDE, daughter of --- (-after 9 Dec 943). \"Ermengars\" sold land in Colonicas (pago Matisconense), with her husband \"Gillevertus\", by charter dated May 926 . According to Du Chesne in 1625 , she was Ermengarde, daughter of Richard \"le Justicier\" Duke of Burgundy. More recently this affiliation has been challenged, in particular because she is not mentioned in her supposed mother's will . In addition, if it is correct that Giselbert's mother was the daughter of King Boso (see the document BURGUNDIAN NOBILITY), she would have been her husband's first cousin, which seems unlikely to have been accepted by the church. Gislebertus...comes Heduensis atque aliarum patriarum, at the request of Roberti Divionensis, granted property to suo fidele Guitbaldus... by charter dated III Id Dec Indictione XIV anno VII regnante Ludovico rege [dated to 942 by Duchesne, probably 943, see above], subscribed by Gisleberti comitis, Ermengardi quæ consensit, Adaleidis filie eorum similiter quæ consensit... .\n\nDuke Giselbert & his wife had [three] children:\n\n1.ADELAIS Werra ([930/35]-) . Gislebertus...comes Heduensis atque aliarum patriarum, at the request of Roberti Divionensis, granted property to suo fidele Guitbaldus... by charter dated III Id Dec Indictione XIV anno VII regnante Ludovico rege [dated to 942 by Duchesne, probably 943, see above], subscribed by Gisleberti comitis, Ermengardi quæ consensit, Adaleidis filie eorum similiter quæ consensit... . The Chronicon of Odorannus records the death in 956 of Gislebertus comes Burgundionem, adding that honorem eius cum filia...Leudegarde... was received by Otho frater Hugonis ducis and that aliam...filiam...Werram married Robertus comes Trecasinorum . \"Trecassine urbis comitem Robertum\" donated land to \"Gratianum abbatem monasterii Sancti Petri Dervensis\" by charter dated 6 Aug 959, signed by Rotberti...comitis, Adelais comitissæ, Erberti filii eorum... . Lot indicates that Werra indicated la Guerre, noting that M. Longnon ma fait observer justement que Werra nétait quun surnom . Her birth date range is estimated from her own daughter's estimated birth date of [950]. m (before 950) ROBERT Comte de Meaux, son of HERIBERT II Comte de Vermandois & his wife Adela [Capet] (-after 19 Jun 966). He became Comte de Troyes in 956 on the death of his father-in-law, by right of his wife.\n\n2. [--- ([930/32]-[947/55?]) or ADELAIS ([930/32] or [940/45?]-after Jul 987) . This is one of several proposed origins for the wife of Lambert Comte de Chalon: follow his hyperlink for discussion of the other possibilities, and also discussions about her possible earlier marriage, her alternative birth and marriage dates, and about Lamberts possible earlier marriage. Presumably, if this person Adelais was Giselberts daughter, she would have been different from his known daughter Adelais Werra who married Robert Comte de Meaux. A completely different possibility is that Giselberts daughter was Lamberts first wife, and that she was not named Adelais at all. Lot (in 1891) indicated that il faut...nécessairement que la femme du comte Lambert soit Adélaïde, fille de Gilbert, on the assumption that Lamberts appointment to Chalon was in succession to Duke Giselbert, the previous holder, by right of his wife . Poupardin (1907) accepted Lots conclusion . Chaume (1925) disagreed, commenting that Cétait oublier...la qualité de primus comes fondateur dune ligne nouvelle, sans lien avec la précédente, que les textes assignent à deux reprises à Lambert . Chaumes observation appears supported by the source cited in the document BURGUNDY DUCHY-CHALON & BEAUNE which records that Lambertus... obtained comitatum Cabilonensem primus, assentante rege primoribusque Franciæ . On the other hand, Settipani highlights firstly that, even in the 9th century avant l´hérédité formelle des charges, the king prenait garde en général to appoint to a county a person with local connections afin déliminer au maximum les risques de contestations et daugmenter lassise politique de son protégé, and secondly that the phrase assentante rege does not exclude et même présuppose, un droit à la succession. Settipani concludes that il reste donc une certaine vraisemblance à lidée dun lien entre Adélaïde et Giselbert, mais certainement pas de certitude comme on le croyait . m firstly ([943/46] or ([956/60?]) [as his [first/second] wife?] LAMBERT Comte de Chalon, son of ROBERT Vicomte de Dijon & his wife Ingeltrude --- (-22 Feb 978, bur Paray-le-Moniale). m secondly (Mar 978 or [Mar 978/early 979]) as his second wife, GEOFFROY IGrisegonelle Comte d'Anjou, son of FOULQUES II Comte dAnjou & his first wife Gerberge [de Maine] ([938/40]-Marçon 21 Jul 987, bur Châteauneuf, église Saint-Martin).]\n\n3.LIETGARDE (-after 958) . A manuscript, whose attribution to Orderic Vitalis is disputed, refers to the wife of Duke Otton as the daughter of Giselbert without giving her name . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also refers to the wife of \"Otto [filius Hugo rex] dux Burgundie\" as \"filiam Gisleberti\" without naming her . The Historia Francorum Senonensis refers to \"filiam Gisleberti ducis Burgundiæ\" as the wife of \"Ottoni, filio Hugonis Magni\", when recording his succession to his father-in-law's dukedom . The Chronicon of Odorannus records the death in 956 of Gislebertus comes Burgundionem, adding that honorem eius cum filia...Leudegarde, ex qua postea a Radulpho Divionensi pipicus factus est was received by Otho frater Hugonis ducis and that aliam...filiam...Werram married Robertus comes Trecasinorum . This document appears to indicate that Lietgarde was the older daughter. However, if that is correct it is unclear why Adelais was the only daughter who subscribed the charter dated 943 (see above). The reference in the Chronicon of Odorannus to Leudegarde, ex qua postea a Radulpho Divionensi pipicus factus est is assumed to indicate her later infidelity: Millin suggest that pipicus, derived from picus indicating magpie, indicates cuckold, by analogy with the cuckoo and based on the mistaken impression that the two birds have similar nesting habits . This suggestion is corroborated by the Annales Nivernenses which record in 958 that Rodulfus Divioni comes captured Belnum [Beaune] castrum seniori sui Optonis [later Otton/Eudes Duke of Burgundy] and what was worse abducted uxorem suam...filiam...Gisleberti and married her, but that the castle was recaptured ab Optone et a suis fidelibus Kal Mai [no further mention of the fate of his wife] . m [firstly] ([Easter] 955) OTTON [Eudes], son of HUGUES \"le Grand\" Capet Duc des Francs & his third wife Hedwig of Saxony ([945]-22/23 Feb 965, bur Saint-Germain dAuxerre).

The Historia Francorum Senonensis names (in order) \"Hugo, Otto et Heinricus\" as the three sons of \"Hugo Magnus dux Francorum ex filia Odonis regis\" . Comte dAuxerre. On the death of his father-in-law in 956, Lothaire King of France installed Eudes as Duke of Burgundy at Beaune. \"Otto filius Hugonis\" was installed as Duke of Burgundy in 960 . Flodoard records the death in 965 of \"Otto filius Hugonis qui Burgundiæ præerat\" . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 23 Feb 963 of \"Otto Burgundiæ Marchio\" . m ([Easter] 955) LIETGARDE, daughter of GISELBERT Duke of Burgundy, Comte d'Autun & his wife Ermengarde [of Burgundy] (-after 958). A manuscript, whose attribution to Orderic Vitalis is disputed, refers to the wife of Duke Otto as daughter of Giselbert without giving her name . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also refers to the wife of \"Otto [filius Hugo rex] dux Burgundie\" as \"filiam Gisleberti\" without naming her . The Historia Francorum Senonensis refers to \"filiam Gisleberti ducis Burgundiæ\" as the wife of \"Ottoni, filio Hugonis Magni\", when recording his succession to his father-in-law's dukedom . The Chronicon of Odorannus records the death in 956 of Gislebertus comes Burgundionem, adding that honorem eius cum filia...Leudegarde, ex qua postea a Radulpho Divionensi pipicus factus est was received by Otho frater Hugonis ducis and that aliam...filiam...Werram married Robertus comes Trecasinorum .

The Historia Francorum Senonensis names (in order) \"Hugo, Otto et Heinricus\" as the three sons of \"Hugo Magnus dux Francorum ex filia Odonis regis\" . Flodoard names \"Hugonem et Oddonem clericum\" as brothers of \"Otto filius Hugonis\", when he records that the rectores of Burgundy named them as his successors . He adopted the name HENRI, and the title Duke of Burgundy. He possessed the counties of Autun, Beaune and Avallon, and was suzerain of the Counts of Chalon, Tonnerre, Nevers and Auxerre, and probably of the Counts of Mâcon and Oscheret . King Lothaire confiscated the counties of Langres and Dijon in 967 and gave them to the Bishop of Langres . Duke Henri married the widow of the ex-king of Italy who had sought refuge in Autun in 971 and adopted her son by her first marriage, Otto-Guillaume, who later became Comte de Bourgogne et de Mâcon. The Chronicle of Saint-Bénigne, interpolated into the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, records the death in 1002 of \"dux Burgundie Henricus\" . Rodulfus Glaber records the death of \"dux Heinricus\" in the third year of the millennium at \"Castrum Pulliacum super Ararim\" in Burgundy and his burial at Auxerre in Oct . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 15 Oct of \"Henricus Burgundiæ marchio\" . m firstly ([973]) as her second husband, GERBERGE, widow of ADALBERTO II di Ivrea ex-King of Italy, daughter of [LAMBERT Comte de Chalon] & his [first wife ---] or [second] wife Adelais --- [or daughter of Adelais by a possible first marriage] ([945/47]-11 Dec [987/91]). Her name and her two marriages are confirmed by the Chronicle of Saint-Bénigne, interpolated into the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, which names \"Guilelmum Ottonem et eius matrem Gerbergam\" when recording that her son was adopted by his mother's second husband \"dux Burgundie Henricus\" . Her birth date is estimated from the estimated birth date of her son by her first marriage in [960/62]. Her family origin is indicated by the Gesta pontificum Autissiodorensium which, in recording Hugues de Chalon Bishop of Auxerre, notes that Henrici ducis [Henri Duke of Burgundy] married ejus germanam . Follow her hyperlink for discussion about her possible parentage. Roclenus Nevernicæ sedis...præsul donated altare...in provincia Nevernensium...[et] in villa Guarigniaci to Nevers Saint-Cyr by charter dated Apr 986, subscribed by ...Henricus Burgundiæ dux...Guillelmus comes...Girberga comitissa, Landricus gloriosus miles... . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 11 Dec of \"Gerberga comitissa uxor Henrici ducis\" . m secondly (before Jun 992, repudiated 996 before 24 Oct) GERSENDE de Gascogne, daughter of GUILLAUME Sanchez Comte de Gascogne & his wife Urraca de Navarra. This second marriage is deduced from the evidence provided by three charters. \"Domnus Hugo comes atque mater sua Adeleidis\" donated property \"in pago Cabilonensi\" to the abbey of Paray-le-Moniale by an undated charter signed by \"Hugo comes, Adeleidis matris suæ, Mauritii filii eius, Enrici ducis, Garlindis uxoris eius\" . \"Henrici ducis [et] dominæ Garsindis comitissæ\" and \"Henricus dux, Gersindis ducatrix\" are named in two charters of Saint-Symphorien d'Autun dated Jun 991 or 992 and 10 May 993 respectively . Her parentage is confirmed by the Historia Abbatiæ Condomensis which notes that \"Gimbaldum Comitem, patrem Ugonis Episcopi\" donated property \"ecclesiam S. Johannis, Cablisa\" to the convent of Condom and also \"nobilissima femina Gavarsens eius videlicet neptis, soror Sanctii Guasconiæ Comitis\" after returning from \"quadam provincia Burgundia ubi maritum habuerat\" . Bouchard suggests that Garlindis/Garsindis are name variants of \"Gerberga\", the wife of Duke Henri named in earlier sources (and assumed to be his first wife) . However, this appears unlikely to be correct as the suffix root elements of these names \"-sendis\" and \"-berga\" are not normally interchangeable and appear separately with different prefix roots in many different contemporary names . It therefore appears likely that \"Gersende\" was a different person from \"Gerberge\". Bouchard also highlights that the only allusion to the origin of Duke Henri's supposed second wife is a satirical poem written about Landry Comte de Nevers which includes an obscure reference to a wife who felt distressed and \"sought Gascony\" . She also comments that the context of the poem implies that, in any case, it was Landry's wife to whom this refers . However, it does not appear that she was aware of the passage in the Historia Abbatiæ Condomensis, quoted above, which appears to confirm Gersende´s parentage conclusively. Duke Henri [Eudes] had [two] illegitimate children by unknown mistresses:\n\na)EUDES (-after 25 Aug 1005) . The Chronicle of Saint-Bénigne, interpolated into the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, names \"Odo vicecomes Belnensis\" as son of \"Henrici ducis Burgundie, frater ex matre Guillelmi Ottonis\" . The absence of any reference to his claiming the succession to the duchy of Burgundy indicates that he was illegitimate rather than Duke Henri's son by his first wife.\n\n- VICOMTES de BEAUNE.\n\nb) [HENRI (-before 1023) . Seigneur de Vergy. J. Richard suggests that Henri Seigneur de Vergy was the illegitimate son of Henri Duke of Burgundy . He asserts that the transfer of the seigneurie de Vergy from Henri's son Humbert to Jean, son of Eudes Vicomte de Beaune, indicates a close family relationship, which he assumes to be one of first cousins. However, Vergy was recorded in the hands of Jean several years before the death of Humbert, suggesting a transfer by sale rather than inheritance. In any case, the natural heir to Vergy if it had passed by inheritance would have been Geoffroy Comte de Mâcon, son of Humbert's sister Elisabeth. The same author links the father of Bishop Humbert with the Henri who signed a charter at Flavigny in 992, along with other Burgundian lords.\n\n- SEIGNEURS de VERGY.]\n\nB. DUKES of BURGUNDY 1032-1361\n\nROBERT de France, son of ROBERT II \"le Pieux\" King of France & his third wife Constance d'Arles ([1011/12]-church of Fleury-sur-Ouche, Côte dOr 8 or 18 Mar 1076, bur Abbaye de Saint-Seine, Côte dOr) . The Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and his wife Constance . Rodulfus Glauber names \"Heinricus rex germanium suum Rotbertum\" when recording the latter's installation as duke of Burgundy by his brother . His mother supported him as candidate to be consecrated associate king in 1027, in place of his older brother Henri who was supported by their father. His father named him heir to the duchy of Burgundy in 1030. He was installed as ROBERT I Duke of Burgundy in 1032 by his brother King Henri I. Comte d'Auxerre in 1040, when he conquered the county after Hugues Bishop of Auxerre died in 1039. He lost it after the 1060 council of Autun which ended his war with Nevers . Robertus Burgundie dux renounced rights in villa...Gilliacus... in favour of Saint-Germain-des-Prés by charter dated 22 Sep 1040, subscribed by ...Elie conjugis eius... . Robertus dux Burgundiorum cum uxore mea Helia donated terram...Villare Bichet...in pago Belnensi to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, with the consent of filiorum nostrorum Hugonis et Henrici, by charter dated to [1043/44] . Robertus dux et duo filii mei Hugo et Henricus renounced rights to revenue from land in Gilliaco in favour of Saint-Germain-des-Prés by charter dated 2 Feb 1053 . The necrology of Cîteaux records the death \"VIII Id Mar\" of \"Robertus dux Burgundie\" . The necrology of Molesme records the death \"XV Kal Apr\" of \"Robertus dux Burgundie et Ermengardis uxor eius\" . There is some mystery surrounding his death: a narrative by Pierre de Saint-Julien deacon of Chalon records that Robertus dux died nuper dedecorose in the church of Fleury-sur-Ouche, without providing further details .\n\nm firstly ([1033], repudiated [1048/50]) HELIE de Semur, daughter of DALMAS [I] Seigneur de Semur-en-Brionnais & his wife Aramburge --- ([1016]-Semur-en-Brionnais, Saône-et-Loire 22 Apr after 1055). \"Robertus dux Burgundionum\" confirmed the possessions of Cluny by charter dated [1040] subscribed by \"Ilie uxoris eius\" . The date of the marriage is deduced from the charter, dated to [1034], which is subscribed by \"Roberti ducis et uxoris sue\", under which \"Gibuinus\" confirmed a donation to Saint-Etienne de Dijon . Robertus Burgundie dux renounced rights in villa...Gilliacus... in favour of Saint-Germain-des-Prés by charter dated 22 Sep 1040, subscribed by ...Elie conjugis eius... . \"Robertus dux et rector inferioris Burgundiæ\" donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon by charter dated 1 Mar 1043 which names \"Helie uxoris mee \" . Robertus dux Burgundiorum cum uxore mea Helia donated terram...Villare Bichet...in pago Belnensi to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, with the consent of filiorum nostrorum Hugonis et Henrici, by charter dated to [1043/44] . Her parentage is confirmed by the Vita S Hugonis, which records that \"Dux Burgundie, gener eius\" killed the father of St Hugues (abbot of Cluny) by his own hand . The \"Notes historiques sur le prieuré de Marcigny\", included in the cartulary of Marcigny-sur-Loire, name (in order) \"sancti Hugonis abbatis Cluniacensis et Gaufredi Sinemurensis, Andræ levitæ, Joceranni et Dalmatii, et sororum eorundem Materdis, Adalaidæ et Cecilæ atque Evellæ\" as children of \"Dalmatius\", but do not make the link with Duke Robert . \"Robertus dux et uxor sua Hylia\" donated money to the church of Saint-Etienne de Dijon by undated charter . She was repudiated, presumably on grounds of consanguinity, before [1050] when Jean Abbot of Fécamp wrote to Pope Leo IX recording that \"Tedbaldo comite et Burgundionum duce R\" had \"abdicatis legitimi thori connumbiis\" and had \"in inhonestis et consanguinitate fdatis thalamis\" . She became a nun as PETRONILLE after her repudiation . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 22 Apr of \"Helya uxor Rotberti ducis\" .\n\nm secondly ([1049]) as her second husband, ERMENGARDE d'Anjou, widow of GEOFFROY II\"Ferréol\" Seigneur de Château-Landon, Comte de Gâtinais, daughter of FOULQUES III \"Nerra/the Black\" Comte dAnjou & his second wife Hildegarde de Metz ([1015/20]-[church of Fleury-sur-Ouche, Côte dOr 18 Mar 1076]). The Historiæ Andegavensis names \"Goffridi de Castro Landono et Ermengardis filia Fulconis Comitis Andegavensis\" as parents of \"Fulco comes Andegavensis\" . Considering that she gave birth to at least one child by her second marriage, it is unlikely that Ermengarde was born earlier than [1015]. She must therefore have been considerably younger than her brother. Her first marriage is dated very approximately to [1035]. Her second marriage is deduced from a genealogy of the Comtes d'Anjou which names \"Fulco (pater) Gosfridus et Ermengardis (mater) Gosfridus (et) Fulco (et) Hildegardis, de altero patre, filia Roberti ducis fratris Henrici regis\" . Her second marriage is dated from the letter written before [1050] by Jean Abbot of Fécamp to Pope Leo IX recording that \"Tedbaldo comite et Burgundionum duce R\" had \"abdicatis legitimi thori connumbiis\" and had \"in inhonestis et consanguinitate fdatis thalamis\" . The necrology of Molesme records the death \"XV Kal Apr\" of \"Robertus dux Burgundie et Ermengardis uxor eius\" . This suggests that Ermengarde died on the same day as her husband, possibly at the same place and in the same circumstances, although it is not infrequent for medieval necrologies to record couples on the same day maybe in commemoration of a joint donation to the religious institution in question. No other source which elucidates the circumstances of Ermengardes death has been identified.\n\nDuke Robert I & his first wife had three children:\n\n1.HUGUES de Bourgogne ([1034]-killed in battle [1059/60]). \"Hugonis ducis filii, bone indolis pueri\" is named in a charter of \"Robertus dux Burgundionum\" dated [1032/39] . \"Robertus dux et rector inferioris Burgundiæ\" donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon by charter dated 1 Mar 1043 which names \"Helie uxoris mee seu filiorum nostrorum Hugonis atque Heinrici\" .

The wife of Henri de Bourgogne has not been identified with certainty. Abbé Maurice Chaume suggested that she was a relative of Ramón Borell I Conde de Barcelona, pointing out the use of the name \"Borel\" by her son and grandson Dukes Eudes I and Hugues II. Szabolcs de Vajay proposed more specifically that she was --- de Barcelona, daughter of Berenguer Ramón I \"el Curvo\" Conde de Barcelona & his third wife Guisle de Ampurias, married while her husband and his father were in Barcelona on crusade in Spain. There appears to be nothing to support the suggestion that her first name was Sibylla. Jean Richard suggested that the wife of Henri de Bourgogne was possibly named Clémence, a name used by her descendants, and that she may have originated from Poitiers. There does not appear to be any direct proof to support any of these theories. Henri de Bourgogne & his wife had seven children:\n\na)HUGUES de Bourgogne ([1056/57]-Cluny, Saône-et-Loire 29 Aug 1093, bur Abbaye de Cluny, Chapelle de Sainte-Marie) . He is named as son of Henri by Orderic Vitalis . His parentage is confirmed by the charter dated [21 Mar 1076/24 Jan 1077] which names \"Hugo post decessum Rotberti ducis\" and which specifies that Robert was \"patris Heinrici genitoris nostri\" . He succeeded his grandfather in 1076 as HUGUES I Duke of Burgundy, although the former intended Hugues's uncle Robert de Bourgogne as his successor. Orderic Vitalis records that Hugues succeeded in expelling Robert, along with his younger brother Simon, from Burgundy . \"Hugo Burgundionum dux\" made a donation to Cluny dated 19 Feb 1078, subscribed by \"Oddonis fratris eius, Rotberti alterius fratris eius\" . Duke Hugues left for Spain in [1078/79] to fight the Moors, helping Sancho I King of Aragon to take the kingdom of Navarre. Orderic Vitalis records that he abdicated as duke in favour of his younger brother Eudes, and became a monk at Cluny , dated to [Oct/Nov] 1079.\n\nb)EUDES de Bourgogne ([1060]-Tarsus, Cilicia 23 Mar 1103, bur Abbaye de Cîteaux, Côte-d'Or, Chapelle Saint-Georges) .

He became a Benedictine monk at Molesmes, being a friend of St Bruno who founded the Order of Chartreux . The cartulary of Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon includes a funerary elogy of the life of \"Roberti Lingonensis episcopi regum Franciæ ac ducum Burgundiæ stirpe genitus\" dated 19 Oct 1111 .\n\nd)BEATRIX de Bourgogne (-after [1111/12]) . \"Odo dux Burgundie\" confirmed a donation by \"frater meus domnus Hugo\" to the abbey of Molesme with the consent of \"fratres mei Robertus archidiaconus, Henricus puer, Beatrix et Helia sorores mee\" by charter dated to [1081/84] . \"Odo dux Burgundie\" donated the village of Marcenay to the abbey of Molesme with the consent of \"omnes eius fratres et sorores Robertus, Henricus, Beatrix, Helia\" by charter dated to [1080/83] . \"Beatrix soror Rotberti Lingonensis episcopi\" donated property to the abbey of Molesme by charter dated to [1085/1106] . \" Widone filio predicti Widonis et uxore eius Beatrice et filiis eorum Roberto et Widone\" consented to the donation by \"Oddo et Albertus fratres\" to the abbey of Saint-Etienne de Vignory by charter dated to [1081/1112] . \"Domina Beatrix uxor domini Widonis de Wannulriaco\" donated property to Molesme by charter dated [1111/12] which names \"fratris sui Roberti Linguonensis episcopi\" . m (after 1082) GUY [III] Seigneur de Vignory, son of GUY [II] Seigneur de Vignory & his wife Hildegarde --- (-before 1126).\n\ne) HELIE de Bourgogne (-after [1081/84]). \"Odo dux Burgundie\" confirmed a donation by \"frater meus domnus Hugo\" to the abbey of Molesme with the consent of \"fratres mei Robertus archidiaconus, Henricus puer, Beatrix et Helia sorores mee\" by charter dated to [1081/84] . \"Odo dux Burgundie\" donated the village of Marcenay to the abbey of Molesme with the consent of \"omnes eius fratres et sorores Robertus, Henricus, Beatrix, Helia\" by charter dated to [1080/83] .

An indication of his age is given in the charter dated to [1081/84] under which \"Odo dux Burgundie\" confirmed a donation by \"frater meus domnus Hugo\" to the abbey of Molesme with the consent of \"fratres mei Robertus archidiaconus, Henricus puer, Beatrix et Helia sorores mee\" . His parentage is confirmed by an early 12th century document at Fleury which records that \"Ainrico uni filiorum, filio ducis Roberti\" married \"alteram filiam non ex coniugali\" of Alfonso VI King of Castile . He took part in the war in Spain against the Moors, with his two brothers Eudes and Robert, in 1087. His aunt Queen Constance invited him to the court of Castile. Señor de Braga [1093]. He was installed as HENRIQUE Conde de Portugal in [1093] or [1095] by Alfonso VI King of Castile.\n\n- KINGS of PORTUGAL.\n\n3.CONSTANCE de Bourgogne ([after 1045]-[Jan/Feb] or [3 Apr/25 Oct] 1093, bur Sahagún, León, royal monastery of Santos Facundo y Primitivo) . The Chronicon Trenorciensi records that \"Constantiæ filia Roberti Ducis\" married firstly \"Hugonis Cabilonensis Comitis\" and secondly \"Hispaniæ Rex Adefonsus\" . Considering the estimated date of her first marriage, it is unlikely that Constance was born before [1045]. She was therefore considerably younger than her brothers. A charter dated 5 Aug 1087 of \"Ducem Burgundiæ Oddonem\" restored property to Tournus abbey by \"comitissa Cabillonensis filia Rotberti ducis\", after the death of \"mariti sui Hugonis comitis\", adding that she subsequently became \"Regina Galliciæ et Hispaniarum\" . \"Infanta donna Urraka Regis domni Adefonsi filia\" names her mother \"Constantie regina\" in her donation to Cluny dated 22 Feb 1117 \"Spanish Era\" , although the date was presumably AD as 1117 Spanish Era was equivalent to 1079 AD. An early 12th century document at Fleury records that \"filiam Roberti ducis Bugundionem Constantiam\" married Alfonso VI King of Castile and was mother of a daughter who married \"Raymundo comiti\" . The Chronicon Regum Legionensium names \"Queen Constance\" as the second of the \"five legitimate wives\" of King Alfonso . Her second marriage date is estimated based on the likely estimated death date of her first husband in [Nov/early Dec] 1079 and her subscribing a document dated 25 Dec 1079 at Dueñas with her second husband . Queen Constance was instrumental in having the Roman rite replace the Visigothic rite in the churches of Castile. \"Adefonsus Hispaniarum rex cum coniuge mea Constantia regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Salvador de Oña by charter dated 1 May 1092 . The date of her death is fixed by her last known mention in a charter dated 25 Jul 1093 and a donation by King Alfonso to the monastery of Sahagún dated 25 Oct 1093, which does not include Queen Constanza's name in the subscription list . Pérez´s history of Sahagún monastery, published in 1782, states that \"Doña Berta Reyna está enterrada no lejos de Doña Constanza en la Capilla\" of the monastery, but does not quote the inscription which confirms this statement . m firstly ([1065]) HUGUES [II] Comte de Chalon, son of THIBAUT Comte de Chalon & his wife Ermentrude--- (-in Spain [Nov/early Dec] 1079). m secondly (late 1079 or 8 May 1081) as his second wife, ALFONSO VI King of Castile and León, son of FERNANDO I King of Castile & his wife Sancha de León (Compostella [1036] or before Jun 1040-29 or 30 Jun 1109, bur Sahagún, León, San Mancio chapel in the royal monastery of Santos Facundo y Primitivo).\n\nDuke Robert & his [first/second] wife had two children:\n\n4.ROBERT de Bourgogne (-poisoned [1113]) . He is named as son of Duke Robert by Orderic Vitalis . Petit, followed by Jean Richard, suggests that Robert and Simon were sons of Duke Robert by his second marriage . Given his active career in the early 12th century, a birth date in the 1050s is more likely than in the late 1030s/early 1040s, but there appears to be no surviving primary source which points either way. Orderic Vitalis records that he was declared heir to the duchy of Burgundy by his father, after his older [half-]brother died, but was dispossessed by his nephew Duke Hugues I . A charter dated 5 Aug 1087 of \"Ducem Burgundiæ Oddonem\" restored property to Tournus abbey by \"comitissa Cabillonensis filia Rotberti ducis\", after the death of \"mariti sui Hugonis comitis\", adding that she subsequently became \"Regina Galliciæ et Hispaniarum\", subscribed by \"Rotberti avunculi ducis fratris Reginæ\", the charter signed at León . Orderic Vitalis records that he \"made a friendly alliance\" with Adelaida, widow of Roger I Count of Sicily, who arranged his marriage and appointed him co-regent for her son . He was murdered by his mother-in-law with a poisoned draught after Count Roger II came of age . His death date is estimated from Orderic Vitalis recording that \"for ten years he defended the principality [Sicily] vigourously against all attacks\" . m (1102 or 1103) [SIBYLLE] of Sicily, daughter of ROGER I Count of Sicily & his second wife Eremburge de Mortain. Orderic Vitalis records that Adelaida, widow of Roger I Count of Sicily, arranged the marriage of \"her daughter\" (unnamed) to Robert de Bourgogne whom she appointed co-regent for her son . Van Kerrebrouck says that Sibylle was the possible name of this daughter and that she was born from his third marriage , presumably reading the passage in Orderic Vitalis literally. It seems more likely chronologically that she was the daughter of Count Roger's second marriage.\n\n5.SIMON de Bourgogne (-after 1087). He is named as son of Duke Robert by Orderic Vitalis . Petit, followed by Jean Richard, suggests that Robert and Simon were sons of Duke Robert by his second marriage . He was expelled from Burgundy with his brother Robert . Bouchard speculates that \"Simon\" was an error for \"Hugh\", who is not mentioned by Orderic Vitalis. However, as Hugues had been dead for some time when Orderic wrote his chronicle such an omission may not be surprising .\n\nDuke Robert & his second wife had one child:\n\n6.AUDEARDE [Hildegarde] de Bourgogne (-after 1120, bur Poitiers, [église abbatiale de Saint-Jean l'Evangéliste de Montierneuf]) . The Chronicle of Saint-Maxence records the marriage of \"Guido comes\" and \"Aldeardim filiam Roberti ducis Burgundiæ\" after he repudiated his previous wife . Her precise parentage is deduced from a genealogy of the Comtes d'Anjou which names \"Fulco (pater) Gosfridus et Ermengardis (mater) Gosfridus (et) Fulco (et) Hildegardis, de altero patre, filia Roberti ducis fratris Henrici regis\" . m (Mar 1069, separated 1076) as his third wife, GUILLAUME VIII Duke of Aquitaine, GUILLAUME VI Comte de Poitou, son of GUILLAUME V \"le Grand\" Duke of Aquitaine [GUILLAUME III Comte de Poitou] & his third wife Agnès de Mâcon [Bourgogne-Comté] (1023-Chizé near Niort, Poitou 25 Sep 1086, bur Poitiers, église abbatiale de Saint-Jean l'Evangéliste de Montierneuf).\n\nEUDES de Bourgogne, son of HENRI de Bourgogne & his wife --- ([1060]-Tarsus, Cilicia 23 Mar 1103, bur Abbaye de Cîteaux, Côte-d'Or, Chapelle Saint-Georges) . He is named as son of Henri by Orderic Vitalis . \"Hugo Burgundionum dux\" made a donation to Cluny dated 19 Feb 1078, subscribed by \"Oddonis fratris eius, Rotberti alterius fratris eius\" . He succeeded in 1079 on the abdication of his brother as EUDES I \"Borel\" Duke of Burgundy. He led the expedition to Spain to fight the Moors in 1087, accompanied by his brothers Robert and Henri, but was defeated at Tudela in Navarre. \"Ducem Burgundiæ Oddonem\" restored property to Tournus abbey by \"comitissa Cabillonensis filia Rotberti ducis\", after the death of \"mariti sui Hugonis comitis\", adding that she subsequently became \"Regina Galliciæ et Hispaniarum\", by charter dated 5 Aug 1087 at León, subscribed by \"Rotberti avunculi ducis fratris Reginæ\" . He made large donations to the monastery of Cîteaux in 1098. \"Odo dux Burgundie\", on the point of leaving for Jerusalem, donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon \"in memorie Hugonis ducis fratris mei Robertus dux avus meus\" by charter dated 1101 . He went to Palestine end-1100 with Etienne Comte de Blois and Hugues Comte de Vermandois, but was betrayed by Emperor Alexios and fell into the hands of the Muslims . \"Hugo dux Burgundie filius Odonis ducis\" donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon by charter dated 1102 which specifies that his father died \"in itinere Hierosolimitano\" , presumably misdated if the date of death of Duke Eudes is correctly stated here. The necrology of Cîteaux records the death \"X Kal Apr\" of \"Odo dux Burgundie\" .\n\nm (1080) SIBYLLE de Bourgogne, daughter of GUILLAUME II \"le Grand\" Comte Palatin de Bourgogne & his wife Etiennette --- ([1065]-after 1103). \"Sybilla uxor mea\" witnessed the donation to Cluny of \"Oddo dux Burgundie\", also witnessed by \"Wilelmus comes genitor iam dicte uxoris mee\" . Her origin is also recorded by Orderic Vitalis . Nun at the abbey of Fontevraud.\n\nDuke Eudes I & his wife had four children:\n\n1.HELIE de Bourgogne ([1080/83]-28 Feb 1141) . She is named by Orderic Vitalis, who also records her parentage, her two marriages and names her eldest son by each marriage . The contract of marriage between \"Bertrandus Raimundi filius\" and \"Electæ\" is dated Jun 1095 . If this document is correctly dated, it is unlikely that Hélie was born much later than [1080/83]. A bull of Pope Pascal II dated 4 Feb 1107 names \"Bertrannus comes\" and comments that he had been \"propter uxorem abiectam et multiplicata adulteria iamdiu excommunicationi subiectus\" . The document gives no more details of these charges, which from the context appear to have been brought some time before the date of the bull, whose main purpose was a threat of further excommunication against Bertrand for having attacked the monastery of Saint-Gilles. She accompanied her husband to Palestine . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Willelmum Talavatium married Ala...quæ fuerat antea uxor ducis Burgundiæ [incorrect], and had duos filios et totidem filias . \"Guido comes Pontivi\" donated property to Cîteaux with the consent of \"pater eius Willelmus comes et mater eius Hela\" by charter dated 18 Dec 1139 . m firstly (Jun 1095) as his second wife, BERTRAND de Toulouse, son of RAYMOND IV \"de Saint-Gilles\" Comte de Toulouse & his first wife --- [de Provence] ([1065]-in Palestine 21 Apr 1112). Regent for his father in Toulouse from Oct 1096, when the latter left for Palestine. He succeeded his father in 1105 as BERTRAND Comte de Toulouse. He conquered Tripoli 12 Jun 1109, declaring himself BERTRAND Count of Tripoli. m secondly ([late 1112/1115]) [as his second wife,] GUILLAUME [I] \"Talvas\" Comte de Ponthieu, son of ROBERT [II] Comte d'Alençon Earl of Arundel and Shrewsbury & his wife Agnès Ctss de Ponthieu (-30 Jun 1171, bur La Hoguette, Calvados, église abbatiale de Saint-André).\n\n2. [FLEURINE de Bourgogne (-murdered near Philomelum, Asia Minor [1097]) . Albert of Aix records that \"Florina filia ducis Burgundiæ\", widow of \"Philippensium principi\", accompanied the expedition of \"Danorum regis filius Sueno\" across Asia Minor \"sperans post triumphum Fidelium tanto tamque nobili sociari marito\" but that they were attacked between Philomelum and Pherna and killed . The dating of the supposed expedition to 1097 is consistent with the context of the passage. Albert of Aix appears to be the only source which gives any information relating to her. She is not mentioned in any of the Burgundian sources which have been consulted during the preparation of the present document. If she did exist, the chronology dictates that Eudes I must have been the duke of Burgundy who was her father. There appears to be no satisfactory way of identifying her husband \"Philippensium principis\". The text of Albert of Aix does not clearly indicate her betrothal to Svend of Denmark, although secondary sources assume that it took place. It is of course not impossible that Albert´s report is garbled and that, when he left on crusade in late 1100 (see above), Duke Eudes took with him one of his daughters whom he married to a local dignitary. If that is correct, the expedition during which she was killed must have been different from the one reported by Albert of Aix and the connection with Svend of Denmark (whose participation in the 1097 expedition is also recorded by William of Tyre ) doubtful. Van Kerrebrouck doubts that Fleurine, who \"died in Palestine [1102], married to a Macedonian Lord\", existed . m --- \"Philippensium principis\" (-before 1097).] [Betrothed (1097) to SVEND Svendsen of Denmark, son of [SVEND II Estridsen King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild Sveinsdatter] ([1053]-murdered near Philomelum, Asia Minor 1097).]\n\n3.HUGUES de Bourgogne ([1085]-soon after 6 Feb 1143, bur Abbaye de Cîteaux) .

He was appointed regent in Burgundy by his father end-1100 before leaving for Palestine. He succeeded his father in 1103 as HUGUES II \"le Pacifique\" Duke of Burgundy. \"Hugo dux Burgundie filius Odonis ducis\" donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon by charter dated 1102, which specifies that his father died \"in itinere Hierosolimitano\" , presumably misdated if the date of death of Duke Eudes is correctly stated above. \"Hugo dux Burgundie\" donated serfs to Dijon Saint-Etienne, for the soul of \"patris meis Odonis\" and with the consent of \"fratre meo Henrico\", by charter dated 1103 .

According to Europäische Stammtafeln, the first wife of Geoffroy [III] is not known, referred to only as \"B 1151\" , but this reference can presumably be identified with Geoffroy's second wife who is referred to as such in his charter dated 1151.
