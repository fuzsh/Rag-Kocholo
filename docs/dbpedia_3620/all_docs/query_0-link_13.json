        "text": "Outside of the Basilica of St. Denis\n\nLast weekend I went on a Groupon day trip to Paris. While the organisation around the trip left something to be desired, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I visited several places, and I will be posting them in several articles as I have MANY pictures. My first stop of the day was the Basilica of St. Denis, the traditional burial place of French kings and queens. The area is quite rough, and of course, the outside of the Basilica was under construction! It was a lot smaller than I expected it to be actually.\n\nInside the main area of the Basilica of St. Denis\n\nThe main area is free to visit, but the crypt costs 8,50 Euro. I didn’t think that was too bad. They have English language maps and folders available.\n\nA small exhibition inside the Basilica\n\nOn the way to the necropolis\n\nConstruction was also happening inside, some tombs were partially blocked, but I did manage to see most of them.\n\nFrancis I (1494 – 1547) and Claude of France (1499 – 1524)\n\nCharles, Duke of Orleans (1394 – 1465), Louis, Duke of Orleans (1372 – 1407), Valentine Visconti, Duchess of Orleans (1366 – 1408) and Philippe, Count of Vertus (1396 – 1420)\n\nCharles Martel (685 – 741), Clovis II (635 – 657), Isabella of Aragon (1247 – 1271), Philip IV (1268 – 1314) and Philip III (1245 – 1285)\n\nCharles VI (1368 – 1422), Isabeau of Bavaria (1371 – 1435), Marie of Anjou (1404 – 1463), Charles VII (1403 – 1461) , Bertrand du Gueschlin (1320 – 1380) and Louis de Sancerre (1342 – 1402)\n\nCharles V (1338 – 1380) and Joanna of Bourbon (1338 – 1377)\n\nHenry II (1519 – 1559) and Catherine De’Medici (1519 – 1589)\n\nLouis VI (1080 – 1137), Henry I (1008 – 1060), John I (the posthumous 1316), Joan of Valois (Queen of Navarre 1311 – 1349), Robert II (970 – 1032), Constance of Arles (984 – 1032) and Louis X (1289 – 1316)\n\nLouis XII (1462 – 1515) and Anne of Brittany (1477 – 1514)\n\nLouis of France 1244 – 1260 (son of Margaret of Provence and Louis IX) and Philippe of France (died 1235, son of Blanche of Castile and Louis VIII)\n\nBlanche of France (died 1320), daughter of Margaret of Provence and Louis IX\n\nCharles, Count of Valois (background 1270 – 1325), Blanche of Navarre (1332 – 1398) and her daughter Joan of France (died 1371) by Philip VI.\n\nUnknown queen\n\nLouis of France, Count of Evreux (died 1319) and Margaret of Artois (died 1311)\n\nClementia of Hungary (1293 – 1328, Mother of John, the Posthumous)\n\nBeatrice of Bourbon, Queen of Bohemia (died 1381)\n\nMargaret of Flanders ( Died 1382, Margaret I, Countess of Burgundy)\n\nJohn II (1319 – 1364) and Philip VI (1293 – 1350)\n\nPhilip V (1294 – 1322), Jeanne d’Évreux (1307 – 1371), Charles IV (1294 – 1328) and Blanche of France (1296 – 1326) daughter of the previous two)\n\nHenry II and Catherine De’Medici\n\nMary of Bourbon 1515 – 1538\n\nUnknown princess\n\nUnknown princess\n\nCharles II of Alençon (1297 – 1346) and Maria de La Cerda y de Lara (died 1379)\n\nStatues of Louis XVI (1754 – 1793) and Marie-Antoinette (1755 – 1793)\n\nClose-up\n\nThe Chapel of the Princes\n\nLouis XVII’s heart (1784 – 1795)\n\nLouis XVIII (1755- 1824)\n\nMaria Theresa of Spain (1638 – 1683)\n\nHenry IV (1553 – 1610)\n\nLouise of France (1737 – 1787), Elisabeth of France (1764 – 1794), Adelaide of France (1732 – 1800), Victoire de France (1733 – 1799) and Charles de Valois (1573 – 1650)\n\nChapel of the Bourbons, Gaston of Orleans (1608 – 1660), Philip of Orleans (1674 – 1723), Louis XIV (1638 – 1715) and Marie De’Medici (1573 – 1642)\n\nMarie Leszczyńska (1703 – 1768)\n\nLeft from top to bottom: Louise of Lorraine (1553 – 1601), Marie Antoinette and the empty grave of Charles X (1757 – 1836).\n\nRight Top to bottom: Louis VII (1120 – 1180), Louis XVI and Louis XVIII (1755 – 1824)\n\nAregund, the wife of Clotaire I (515 – c580)\n\nI was very overwhelmed by it all and I didn’t really want to leave. The Basilica is amazingly beautiful and the tombs are simply breathtaking. If you’re ever in Paris, I highly recommend going here. It’s very easy to get to, it’s on the second to last stop on line 13 to St.Denis Université and is on the edge of zone 3 so you can use the Paris Visité zone 1-3 pass."
