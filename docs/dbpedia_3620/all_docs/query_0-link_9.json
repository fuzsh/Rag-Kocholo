        "text": "Images of Medieval Art and Architecture\n\nThe Treasures of Saint Denis\n\nThe Abbey of Saint-Denis and its Ancient Treasures\n\nBy Sir W. MARTIN CONWAY, F.S.A.\n\nRead 4th February, 1915.\n\nThis article by Martin Conway was written in 1915. Many parts of it have been added to or superceded by subsequent research. However, much of this article still vaulable.\n\nWebmaster's note: It has been surprizingly challenging to take a work on pages in a book and make it useable in cyberspace. It will very interesting to see how the process of finding and using information changes as cyperspace evolves.\n\nI have done the following:\n\nRenumbered and changed the footnotes to endnotes, and added hyperlinks to the appropriate place in the text\n\nadded section headings to serve as guideposts, since there are no longer physical pages\n\nchanged many of the figure numbers to links to appropriate cyber pages containing images and information.\n\nJane Vadnal\n\nSources\n\nTHE authorities relied upon for the following account of the Abbey Church and treasures of St.- Denis are in the first instance the three well-known published volumes:-\n\nJacques Doublet: Histoire de . . . S.Denys Paris, 1625. 4to.\n\nS. G. Millet:Le Tresor Sacra. . . de Sainct-Denis(4me. éd.). Paris, 1645. I 2mo.\n\nMichel Félibien: Historie de . . . Saint-Denys Paris, 1706. fol.\n\nI shall cite these frequently by the initial letters, D, M, and F.\n\nBesides these books are also such of the inventories of the treasures, made at different dates, as have been preserved. The oldest existing inventory is dated 22 janvier 1504 (1505, n. s.). This has been published in extenso from the manuscript in the Bibliothéque nationale (f. fr. 18766) by Monsieur H. Omont in Mémoires de La Société de l'Histoire de Paris, etc., tome xxviii (Paris, 1902, 8vo), pp. 166-99. I shall cite this as 'Inv. 1505'. Monsieur Omont evidently considers it to be an original and complete document; but a careful comparison of it with the inventory next to be mentioned proves it to be merely an abstract, the omissions in which are important and sometimes misleading. For example, the item no. 199 begins 'joygnant ledict autel'; now the last altar mentioned is 'le grant autel', but the altar intended to be referred to is 'the altar of the relics' or 'of Saint-Denis', which had been mentioned in the complete inventory though passed over in the abstract. There are several other like obscurities due to abbreviation or omission. (1) According to Millet (p. 83) an inventory was made in 1534, whilst Félibien (pp. 460, 464) refers to others of the years 1576, 1581, 1598, and 1634. Of these only the last mentioned exists, actually in three manuscript copies, two in the Bibliothéque nationale (f. fr. 4611 and 18765) and one in the Archives nationales (LL 1327). The example examined by me is the MS. f. fr. 4611, the leaves of which are numbered; I shall refer to this as 'Inv. 1634' followed by the number of the leaf. The corresponding leaf in MS. f. fr. 18765 can be found by adding one to the figure. There is also an inventory made in the year 1739, likewise printed in full by Monsieur Omont in the publication above referred to (pp. 199-212); I shall cite this as 'Inv. 1739'.\n\nIt is necessary to say a word or two more about the inventory of 1634. This obviously incorporates in full the complete inventory from which the abstract was made in 1505 which Monsieur Omont printed. The order in which the objects are enumerated is the same, and so for the most part are the actual words employed, but the later document is much fuller and has besides many additions made in the year 1634, describing changes in the condition of particular objects, damage done to them, losses of stones, or actual complete destruction undergone in the intervening 130 years. Hence the inventory of 1634 is the really important document, which deserves to be studied in much more detail than I was able to attain during a short visit to Paris. It catalogues practically every stone of any value in each of the wonderful treasures which belonged to St.-Denis at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The earliest writing to give any account of St.-Denis is an anonymous manuscript in the Bibliothéque nationale, Paris (no. 12710), entitled Descriptio qualiter Karlus Magnus clavum et coronam domini a Constantinopoli Aquisgrani detulerit qualiterque Karlus Kalvus haec ad sanctum Dyonisium retulerit. It was composed and written at St.-Denis before 1100 and probably even before the First Crusade.(2)\n\nBesides these texts there are the five large engravings included by Félibien in his volume. Four of these (pl. III and IV) depict the contents of the four armoires in which the treasure was displayed throughout the eighteenth century. Each object is distinguished by a letter on Félibien's plates, which I shall cite thus, e.g. ' F. pl. iii M.' Other representations of treasures once belonging to St.-Denis have been preserved. Thus there is an engraving of ' L'escriptouere monsr. Sainct Denis' facing p. 23 in the Palaeographia Graeca of Bernard de Montfaucon (Paris, 1708, in- fol.). There are also colored facsimiles of three important lost objects amongst the drawings which belonged to Peiresc and are now in the Cabinet des Estampes; while in the same collection is a most important drawing of 'l'Escrain Charlemaigne'. This and the Peiresc drawings, which will be referred to in their place, have been admirably reproduced in colour in the following work: J. Guibert, Les Dessines du Cabinet Peiresc, etc. Paris, 1910 4to. (3)\n\nFinally, and in some respects most important of all, is the remarkable picture (one of two wings of a late fifteenth-century altar-piece representing incidents in the legend of St. Giles) formerly in the Dudley Collection, on the sale of which collection one wing was purchased by the National Gallery; it will not here concern us. The other, the important wing for us, now belongs to Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie (pl. II). It is curious that no careful study of it has ever been made. The painter's name is not known. He was probably a north-French or south-Netherlandish master, who worked in France, and, like the Maitre de Moulins, shows the influence of Hugo van der Goes. The subject of the wing in question is 'St. Giles saying Mass', and the painter has chosen to show him as officiating in the great church of St.-Denis, with Charles Martel (4) kneeling beside him at the glorious altar of which we shall hereafter have much to say. The picture, therefore, is of extraordinary historical importance, because the altar in question was of great beauty and fame, and this is not only the single representation of it that exists, but is the only record of the aspect of the great Royal Abbey of France in the time of its splendor, as it were photographed in color in actual use, before civil wars, reformations, and revolutions had swept it and so many other wonderful medieval treasures off the face of the earth.\n\nViollet-le-Duc knew of the existence of this picture, but never saw it, and relied upon an inaccurate drawing of it which is printed in his Dictionnarie de l'Architecture. (5)He states that the altar in question is the Matutinal altar of St. Denis and that the cross above it was Suger's, and he invents a chasse and introduces it under the canopy behind the altar. I shall show that the altar is not the Matutinal altar, whilst others have long ago proved that the cross was not Suger's. St. Louis's chasse, moreover, lay above and not beneath the canopy. If Viollet-le-Duc had put himself to the inconvenience of crossing the Channel to see the picture, which was easily accessible in Lord Dudley's house, it is safe to assert that he would have restored the chevet of the church differently, and that he would not have put the monument of Dagobert together exactly as was done, omitting the deep recess or hollow molding which should divide the sculptured background from the framing archivolt. The head of the figure of Queen Nanthilde would likewise not have needed to be wholly invented by the sculptor Geoffroy-Dechaume in 1862.\n\nLayout of the Church of Saint Denis\n\nNumber of altars\n\nBefore beginning the detailed description of such of the treasures of St. Denis as survive, or of which representations exist, it will conduce to clearness if we first of all consider the ancient arrangement of the church itself and the place occupied by some of the more important objects. And first let us reply to the question, How many principal altars were there in the axis of the church, and what were their positions ? In the seventeenth century there were only two, as shown in Félibien's plan, and so Viollet-le-Duc restored them; but in the time of Suger and down to the year 1610 there were three, and only one of them, the altar of St. Denis, occupied the position of either of the restored altars. Thus, in 1529, when Cardinal de Bourbon came to take possession of St.-Denis as its Abbot, and was received by the clergy, he 'fit trois stations en entrant dans l'église, la première devant l'autel matutinal, oú reposait le saint Sacrement, la seconde devant le grand autel, et la troisi&grave;me à l'autel de Saint Denis ' (F., p. 383). Doublet says that the Matutinal altar is so called because of the High Masses which was celebrated there immediately after Prime. He says there were four High Masses celebrated every day: the first at the altar of the Martyrs (St.Denis), the second at the Matutinal altar, the third in the Chapel of Our Lady (chanted by the novices, the fourth, the great Mass of the day, at the 'Maistre Autel'. Each of these altars stood within its own enclosure-screens and was the centre of a number of precious objects placed in relation to it. We shall more easily avoid confusion, therefore, if we take each enclosure and its altar in turn and discover how each was decorated and by what treasures it was accompanied, before proceeding to consider the treasures themselves individually in chronological sequence.\n\nScreen and pulpitum\n\nThe choir was entered from the nave through a screen, on the 'frontispiece ' of which, says Doublet (p. 286), was the legend of St. Denis 'industrieusement taillez et bien representez' in stone, but at what date he does not say. Above it was one of Suger's crucifixes, a wooden one, between images of the Virgin and St. John, whilst on the gallery of it was planted, likewise by Suger, a pulpitum whence the Gospel was read. This pulpitum was made up out of old materials, which appear formerly to have covered the whole gallery, and consisted of tablets of ivory sculptured with figures (presumably like the ivory throne at Ravenna) mixed with animals made of copper. The whole thing was ruined by the Huguenots at a later date. The pulpit presented to Aix- la-Chapelle Cathedral by the Emperor Heinrich II before 1014 may give some idea as to how these decorative panels were arranged.\n\nMatutinal Altar\n\nWithin the choir the central object was the eagle lectern of bronze. It was adorned with figures of the four Evangelists and others. Dagobert captured it at Poitiers and presented it to St.-Denis, and Suger had it gilded. The altar of this part of the building was the Matutinal altar. It was also called the altar of the Trinity and the Choir altar, and in the time of Suger 'l'Autel Saincti.' (6)Its position can be fixed with some accuracy. In Félibien's plan the position (AA) of Charles the Bald's tomb is plainly marked.(7) It is sometimes described as being beneath and sometimes in front of the altar of the Trinity, so that this altar must have stood approximately in a line with the east end of the stalls. Moreover, the altar was attached to the iron screen which here closed the choir, and no doubt was fixed to the two great arcading piers against which the stalls end. Again, we are told (8) that the Matutinal altar was under a heam of wood which was at the east end of the choir and on which at one time stood the gold cross of St. Eloy. The altar itself was built by Suger of black marble and embellished with sculptures in white marble representing the martyrdom of St. Denis. Upon it was an image of the Trinity in silver-gilt, which was destroyed in the time of the Armagnacs in the reign of Charles VII. A silver-gilt retable for the altar on this site had been given by Robert, Abbot of Corbie; Suger preserved it and enriched it with (9). Further, to the old altar, which Suger thus replaced, certain relics had been attached by Charles the Bald. Suger reset these in what appears to have been a portable altar of porphyry, described as framed in a chassis of wood, 'et ce chassis remply d'or fin' and set with gems. This portable altar is later on found in the Treasury. The other fittings and treasures belonging to the altar are enumerated in the inventory of 1505 (nos. 162-84).(10)\n\nImmediately behind and belonging to it was an elaborate structure consisting of a square column of copper-gilt supporting a wooden cross, covered with gold, and a unicorn's (narwhal's) horn 6 1/2 ft. long with a silver crown round it. From this cross, or a jutting bracket, there hung an openwork lantern of silver-gilt, containing a round cup of gold set with stones, and in it a smaller round box, likewise of gold, and set with many stones, which was the ciborium to hold the Host. These gold boxes were stolen in 1610 and the thief never discovered. (11). There hung from the roof down in front of this altar a silver basin, six lamps and a 'nef'. A piece of wall behind this altar supported the chasse of St. Denis of Corinth. It was of copper-gilt garnished with embossed images and capitals of silver-gilt and set with stones, probably a thirteenth-century work. Beside this altar was a wooden chest containing two chalices and patens, a spoon pierced with many holes, described as ' of ancient fashion ', to which we shall recur, two silver basins, a 'byberon' with a lion's head, two silver candlesticks, two censers of silver, a silver pax, some minor implements, and a finely bound MS. of the Gospels.\n\nTombs\n\nEast of the choir-screen and Trinity altar was an open square space beneath the crossing, and this was given up to the monuments of kings and the opening to the royal vault. We are not concerned with these monuments except in so far as what we learn about them throws light on other matters. Immediately behind the Trinity altar St. Louis was buried in a stone coffin between the graves of his father Louis VIII and Philip Augustus. (12) His body only remained there till l298, when, after his canonization, it was taken up and put into a chasse, but the tomb with the silver effigy upon it remained till the precious metal was stripped off by the Armagnacs or the English in the days of Charles VII. (13) Other tombs in that wretched time were treated in the same fashion, so that the two remaining near this altar were mere anonymous wrecks in 1505.(14) At the east side of the crossing was another iron screen, perhaps led up to by some steps which, however, were farther east than the steps made in 1610 and shown on Félibien's plan, because these are recorded to have partly covered the tomb of the wife of St. Louis.\n\nThe High Altar\n\nWe thus come to the enclosure which contained the High altar, the 'Maistre Autel' or 'grand autel' as it is sometimes called, the altar of St. Peter and St. Paul, as was its correct designation. We possess numerous descriptions of it, and it is this and no other that is depicted in the picture of the Mass of St. Giles. But that picture proves that its position about the year 1500, doubtless its original position, was directly in a line with or even a little west of the centre of Dagobert's monument, whereas in 1610 it was moved somewhat to the east of it as marked on Félibien's plan, where the restored altar now stands.\n\nIt is related (15) that when Pope Stephen II visited France in the year 754 to appeal to Pepin for protection against the Lombards, one day during his stay at St.-Denis kneeling before this altar he had a vision of 'the good shepherd Monseigneur St. Peter, and the master and doctor of the Gentiles Monseigneur St. Paul' and also of St. Denis who was splendidly clad, and of his two fellow saints, and he heard and reported word for word their conversation and even their gestures, but unfortunately the passage is too long to be copied here. The upshot was that the Pope, who had been suffering from illness, was forthwith restored to health and next day consecrated this altar to the honour of the two saints; and thereat he crowned Pepin king and anointed his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. In memory of this very important event, which led to such great future developments as the revival of the Empire of the West and the solid foundation of the temporal power of the Popes, Pepin gave two life-sized figures in gold of St. Peter and St. Paul and two fine porphyry columns for them to stand on, which were placed close to the back angles of the altar ('joignant les deux boutz du derri&grave;re dudict autel', Inv. 1505). If the columns do not appear in the St. Giles picture, though the gold figures had before then been destroyed, it is because they were hidden by the curtain. The altar was of black and white marble and stood on four white marble columns, on one of which were the letters M. P. V. IIII. Dagobert was buried beneath it, (16) though his monument was to the south where St. Louis afterwards reconstructed it, and it is the reconstructed monument that appears in our picture, the prominent standing figure on the left being Queen Nanthilde, Dagobert's second wife, who was buried with or near him.\n\nSuger himself has described for us the splendid decorations of this altar in his day. He relates how there was in front of the altar a very precious altar-frontal of gold (seen above the altar as a retable in our picture (pl. II and X I)), given by Charles the Bald, which alone did not seem to him fine enough to make the altar as splendid as he wished it to be. So he encased it (as Angilbert encased the still existing altar at Milan) with three more golden sides, one with figures in relief of a singular and admirable sort, but all enriched with precious stones, so that about this altar nothing was seen except gold and jewels. It was made to appear still more sumptuous by the golden jeweled table itself and by the precious treasures placed upon it, when Mass was celebrated there on days of solemnity. There were the fine gold candlesticks, weighing twenty marks, enriched with jacinths, emeralds, garnets, and other sorts of gems given by King Louis le Gros; also the great cross of gold made by St. Eloy, Bishop of Noyon, with many other smaller crosses, and above all these was that very precious treasure named 'l'Escrin de Charlemagne' (pl. X), given by his grandson, the Emperor Charles the Bald. All these objects were enriched with so many jewels that they produced an admirable and ravishing effect. If one adds to all this the two great golden images of St. Peter and St. Paul, of the height of a man, which were given by King Pepin and placed on two columns of porphyry at the sides of this altar, it must be admitted that it was altogether resplendent and majestic. So that Abbot Suger said that when he looked at it, with all its fittings, he was so ravished by the sight as to imagine himself not on this earth, but near Paradise; and some inhabitants of Jerusalem, who came to France and saw these rare magnificence of St.-Denis, told him that they surpassed the treasures of the temple of St. Sophia of Constantinople which they had seen.\n\nAs for the gold encasement of the altar, that also had disappeared by 1500, except the frontal, which was used as a retable, and two of Suger's panels, hidden in the picture perhaps by the embroidered frontal. Millet (p. 40) relates that there used to be six 'great tables of gold' belonging to St.-Denis, one given by Dagobert, one by Charles the Bald, and four by Suger. Of these, he says only the second remained in his time. The others, as well as Pepin's two gold images, Louis le Gros's candlesticks, the image of the Trinity belonging to the Matutinal altar, Suger's great cross, and many other treasures, were destroyed in the troublous times of Charles Vl and VII-' ravies par les Anglois', he says, though Félibien tells another story.\n\nOne other feature shown in our picture connected with the High altar remains to be considered: the four columns surmounted by figures of angels holding candlesticks, which columns support the rods for the curtains enclosing the altar on three sides. They are mentioned (no. 191) in the inventory of 1505, where it is stated that the columns are of latten and the angels of copper-gilt. Evidently they belong to about the time of St. Louis, during whose days so much was done in the way of rebuilding and decorating the church. (17)\n\nThe Shrines of Saint Louis\n\nBehind the High altar in our picture rises a metallic vaulted structure which was the platform that supported the chasse of St. Louis. At first sight it seems to be a canopy resting on six columns, but it is important to observe that there are only four, the two arches on either long side being separated by cusps, not by columns. The cusp on the south side can be plainly seen. This structure is thus described in the inventory of 1505 (no. 192): 'Au derrière dudict autel (the High altar) quatre coulompnes de laton de fonte, et sur icelles ung entablement aussi de laton doré d'or de painctre: et sur icelles columpnes et entablement ung coffre de bahu d'ancienne facon, fort caducque, rompu dessus, plus par caducqueté que par force, et dedans icellui le corps de monseigneur saint Loys, roy de France.' The following important passage from the inventory of 1634 (f. 259v), which I could not entirely decipher, was kindly copied out for me by Monsieur J. J. Marquet de Vasselot of the Louvre: ' Au derrière dud. autel quatre colomnes de fonte et dessus icelles un entablement aussy de laitton doré d'or de peintre, garny tout allentour de fleurs de lys placqués; quatre angeles aux quatre coings, tenans chascun un chandellier aussy de laiton, l'un des chandelliers rompu, et estoient au derrière du dit entablement; l'an m IIIe. IIIIx. douze et six [sic] fut cy présent ce tabernacle assis; Charles de France Roy size [sic] le donna, Pierre Rozette le fist et acheva; et a esté par lesd. relligieux dict et déclaré que les susd. quatre colomns de laiton et les quatre angeles furent desmolis lors du couronnement de la royne en six cent dix, et furent vendus pour réparer la demolition qui en avoit esté faicte.\n\n'Dessus le dict entablement un coffre de bahut d'environ deux pieds et demy de long et un pied de large, couvert de cuir bandé de fer et semé de petits clouds, fermant ê clef et scellé sur le bou de la clef d'un scel de cire (fol. 260) et dedans icelluy coffre les ossemens du corps Monsieur St Louis, ledit coffre for ancien et caducque rompu dessus à force plus que par caduceté. Dessus ledt coffre un tapis semé de fleurs de lys.' (18).\n\nSt. Louis's much venerated remains had a very chequered history. When he died in Tunis in 1270, the flesh was boiled off his bones in a cauldron of wine and water.(19) The flesh was taken to Monreale in Sicily and there buried, whilst the bones were wrapped in scented silk and brought with the heart to France. On the 22nd of May, 1271, the bones were buried in St.-Denis in a stone coffin behind the altar of the Trinity and adjacent to the tombs of Louis VIII and Philip Augustus. St. Louis had prescribed that his grave should be quite plain, but his son ' luy fit dresser un tombeau magnifique où l'or et l'argent estoient ce qu'il y avoit de moins considéré', says Félibien (p. 249) in his vague fashion. Doublet (p. I 240), whom Félibien despised as a writer, more accurately states that the tomb was covered with silver, which was carried off later on by the English and Armagnacs in the time of Charles VI.\n\nIn 1297 St. Louis was canonized, and in the following year, on the twenty-eighth anniversary of his death, his bones were taken up out of their grave and with great ceremony put into a chasse which Millet (p. 76) was mistaken in describing as of gold. This chasse was set behind and above the High altar.\n\nSeven years later, in 1305, the skull of St. Louis, except the jaw-bone, was given to the Sainte Chapelle, at the request of Jeanne d'Evreux, in exchange for a reliquary in the shape of a chapel containing specimens from all the relics in the Sainte Chapelle. The jaw-bone, retained at St.- Denis, was in the fourteenth century set in a special reliquary, of which an engraving is included in Félibien's plates (F. pl. iii c). Later on at different times other fragments of St. Louis's bones were parted with as gifts or in exchange.\n\nIn 1368 Charles V gave money to cover the chasse of St. Louis with gold, so that obviously it cannot have been of gold to start with. Apparently what was done, however, was to begin making an entirely new gold chasse. This, according to the inventory of 1634, was made by Juivre Vogette and was not finished until 1392, when Charles VI brought it to St.-Denis and saw the relics moved into it.(20) At the same time the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Touraine gave the jewels they were wearibg to be fastened on to the chasse, whilst the king also gave 1,000 francs to pay for making the tabernacle above described.\n\nThe gold chasse only lasted twenty-five years. In 1418, in the evil days of the English wars, the gold was melted down and made into coin for the needs of the government, and the relics remained in the iron-bound box. The fort caduque condition of this box in 1505 has been noted above. Finally Cardinal de Bourbon, who was Abbot of St.-Denis (1529-57), had a new silver-gilt chasse made in 1557 which, after being restored in 1657, lasted till the Revolution and is engraved by Félibien (pl. v A). This chasse stood (I suppose after the choir rearrangement in 1601) on a pillar of wood with a copper base behind the High altar. But in 1633 the royal commissioners thought that 'this position was not decent', so they had the chasse removed into the Treasury, till a more honourable place should be prepared. It seems, however, thenceforward to have remained in the Treasury. It was there at all events in 1739.\n\nThe Alterations of 1610\n\nThe alterations in the church, made in preparation for the coronation of Marie de Médicis, changed the whole aspect of the Maitre Autel and all that lay eastward of it. Unfortunately Viollet-le-Duc reconstructed the interior as thus changed, not its originally planned by Suger and represented in our picture. The best succinct account of what was done in 1610 is given by Millet (p. 71), who relates how the Matutinal altar 'fut demoly et transporté au lieu où il est maintenant, servant de grand autel, car le grand autel qui estoit pour lors fut aussi demoly et n'a point esté restably depuis; mais les matériaux d'iceluy, qui estoient de marbre, ont esté employez en la fabrique du bel autel des corps saincts, qui est au chevet. Fut aussi ostée la closture de fer qui fermoit le chceur par en haut, et le separoit d'avec cette grande place, qui est soubs le milieu de la grande crois&eqcute;e entre le maistre autel et le mesme choeur, dans laquelle on voit tant de sepultures de Rois anciennes et modernes'. New stone stairs were also made on either side of the Maitre Autel by which to ascend to the chevet.\n\nIt is the church thus altered that is represented on Félibien's plan, and was reconstructed by Viollet- le-Duc. It is not difficult to imagine how injurious all these changes must have been to the old church; but they pleased the people who made them. Marie de Médicis was majestically crowned before the new High altar on May 13, 1610. The herald mounted to the gallery of the Jubé, cried aloud 'Largesse' and cast down numbers of silver medals, with the likeness of the queen on one side and on the other a crown and emblems, whilst gold pieces were distributed among the courtiers and ambassadors. Great preparations had been made, and decorations set up for the triumphal entry of the king and queen into Paris. But before this could happen all the glory and rejoicings were turned into sadness by the murder of Henri IV on the day after his queen's coronation. His body in due course was brought to St.-Denis, and there lay till it and the bodies of all the kings were torn from their graves by the mad Revolutionary mob, who likewise destroyed every destructible feature of the great church, so that for years it lay abandoned like a ruin and open to the sky. The history of its restoration can be read in the admirable handbook by MM. Paul Vitry and Gaston Brière, entitled L'Église abbatiale de Saint-Denis et ses Tombeaux. (Paris, 1908).\n\nThe inventory of 1634 (f. 260r et seq.) enables us, with the help of other authorities and of our picture, to form an accurate idea of the arrangements that existed behind the Maitre Autel prior to 1610, and they are very important for a proper understanding of our subject. All authorities make frequent reference to a vault existing behind the Maitre Autel and under the pavement in front of the altar of Saint-Denis or of the relics.(21) Doublet (p. 1196) in describing the tomb of Dagobert writes: ' Son corps gist sous le Maistre Autel, qui est dès lors du premier bastiment de l'Église de Sainct Denys, avec le caveau des Saincts Martyrs, vis à vis d'iceluy, o reposoient lcurs saincts et sacrez corps.' Elsewhere (p. 250) he describes it as ' l'ancien caveau oè le Roy Dagobert avoit mis iceux corps saincts'.(22) He also tells us (p. 252) that when Suger had made his great crucifix of gold he set it up 'au lieu et endroit où avoient reposé les corps de S. Denys et de ses compagnons par longues années, afin que la memoire n'en fust perdue, et que l'on honorast tousjours ce sainct lieu'.(23) Finally (p. 286) Doublet, in reference to the crucifix that spoke to Dagobert, says that Suger set it up on ' la cave basse et Chapelle de S. Demetre martyr, derrière le Maistre Autel, où autresfois avoient reposé les corps des Saincts martyrs'. This is the only mention I have anywhere found of a chapel of St. Demetrius. Félibien says nothing about it, and his plan affords no assistance.\n\nThe inventory of 1505 (no. 193) likewise describes the Talking Crucifix as being in a vault ' derrière ledict grant autel ', and indicates (no. 194) an armoire as up against the door of the said vault, outside it on the left (' joygnant l'huys de ladicte voute à costé senestre par dehors'). Finally, over the portal of the same vault the inventories of 1505 and 1634 locate (nos. 195-8) the great cross of Suger.\n\nFrom all this it is clear, I think, that the vault so often referred to is no other than the existing crypt under the chevet, in which are the coffins of Louis WI, Marie Antoinette, and other royal personages. That vault, at the time when our picture was painted, was entered by the door depicted in the middle of its west end and immediately behind the Maitre Autel. At present the entrance to it is at its south-west corner, immediately behind the monument of Dagobert. The only reason for hesitating to accept the evidence of the picture on this point is that it does not show any trace of the cross of Suger, which must have been standing above the entrance when the picture was painted, and ought to appear in it. One must conclude that the artist simply left it out. If he had known how much that cross would interest posterity he would have given himself the needful extra trouble involved in depicting it. Clearly the front wall of the crypt under the chevet stood somewhat farther back, eastward, than now. The ascent to it was made, not by steps corresponding in position to the present stone staircases, but by a steep wooden staircase, which can be perceived in the picture leading up to a wooden door in the wooden screen which enclosed the chevet along its west front. The said door admitted into a kind of wooden porch, and that to the chevet. Before leaving the picture we may finally note how it shows the apse-walls, above the great arcade, to be hung with tapestries, the hanging of the church with such on the occasion of great ceremonials being often mentioned in contemporary descriptions.\n\nThe inventories give detailed information, where the picture fails us, as to the arrangements on the upper level within the chevet. Here was the altar called of Saint Denis, or of the Martyrs, or of the Relics. We do not know exactly where it stood because, in 1628, it was entirely rebuilt, partly out of materials taken from the old Maitre Autel, and it was set up in a new position, at the extreme east end of the apse, close against the arcade piers. Suger's altar, however, stood well out away from these piers, for it had the tabernacle covering the chasses of the martyrs behind it and the great ' Cuve de porphyre', which Dagobert gave, behind the tabernacle. The inventory of 1505 (no 227) describes the chapel of St. Eustace as being on the left of the altar of St. Denis. This chapel still exists; it is on the north side of the most westerly part of the chevet. the altar can scarcely have been level with that. Viollet-le-Duc set up his Autel des Reliques in the centre encircled by the apse, and this was no doubt approximately the correct original position. His restoration of the altar and the tabernacle behind it, (24) made in accordance with Doublet's description, is praised by Labarte for its general form; (25) but he adds that the decorative details are all incorrect, as is shown by the minute description of them given in the inventory of 1634 (f. 267v). On the left side of the altar was an armoire, on the right side three armoires in a row, all containing treasures. In front of it was an eagle lectern and a coffer containing a chalice and so forth for use at the altar. When the new altar was made in 1628 the 'Cuve de porphyre' was moved into the chapel of St. Hilaire. Before 1739 it was put into the chapel of Notre-Dame-la-Blanche, where it was used for the blessing of holy water on Easter and Whitsun eves. In 179I it was sent with the throne of Dagobert and other objects to the Cabinet des Médailles; and there it can still be seen on the ground floor just facing a person entering from the street.\n\nAs nothing remains, either of the altar of St. Denis, or of the retable given by Pepin, or of the tabernacle behind it and the chasses it contained, it is not necessary for us to consider them here in detail. (26) Suffice it to say that the tabernacle was in the form of a building with central nave and lower aisles, containing chasses under the roofs, and the actual coffins of St. Denis, St. Rusticus, and St. Eleutherius in the basement beneath and extending in part also under the altar. The tabernacle and altar were constructed by Suger; the retable used was one that had been given by Pepin. The altar and reliquaries were consecrated with great ceremony in the presence of royalties, archbishops, bishops, and all the hierarchies, and they existed in splendour to the joy of many generations till the evil days of the Huguenot wars. In 1567 the altar was dreadfully damaged, ' sacrilegé, pillé et desrobé ', says Doublet, only certain movable parts of the front of it having been taken away in time and hidden. But for that caution, he says, nothing would have been left. In 1627 it was decided to make a new altar and reliquary, in place of the old which was entirely taken away. The new altar was set up at the very end of the chevet against a wall, the three chasses being put into a niche contrived in the wall about six feet above the floor and behind the altar.(27) Of course this in turn was utterly destroyed in the Revolution.\n\nThe Oriflamme\n\nFastened against the two most easterly piers in the chevet were two important relics. One was the pastoral staff of St. Denis. The other was the Oriflamme. 'Against a pillar in the corner, on the left side, a standard of \"cendal\" (28) very dilapidated, twisted round a staff covered with copper-gilt with a longish iron point at the top end, which the said monks say is the Oriflamme ' ( Inv. 1505, no. 201).\n\nThe Oriflamme was, in fact, a red silk flag on a gilt staff; those were the essential colours according to Doublet, who wrote a chapter on it (p. 299). Guillaume Guyart, a poet of the thirteenth century, thus describes it:\n\nL'oriflamme est une bannière\n\nAucun poi plus forte que quimple,\n\nDe cendal roujoyans et simple,\n\nSans pourctraiture d'autre affaire.\n\nFélibien says that it had the form of an old-fashioned banner or gonfalon, with three points or tails ending in green tassels. Much has been written about this flag, but the central fact in connexion with it seems to be that it was the flag, not of the kings of France, but of St. Denis. A Merovingian king gave Le Vexin to the abbey. By the ninth century it had been enfeoffed to a family of counts, and the Count of the Vexin was called the premier vassal of St. Denis, and as such carried the flag of St. Denis. When the Vexin was reunited to the royal domain under Philip I, the king became a kind of honorary feudatory of St. Denis, and so thenceforward adopted the Oriflamme. It was customary for the king, before going to war, to come in state to the abbey and take the flag from the shrine of the Saints, to whom it was returned with equal ceremony when the war was over. Charlemagne was fabled to have borne it. Philip Augustus certainly took it in 1190. St. Louis fetched it away to both his crusades. King after king carried it to the wars. All through the fourteenth century they fought beneath it. Last of all, Charles VI, after flying it in the Civil wars, whereby it seems to have lost its luck, came to St.-Denis for it on the eve of Agincourt, at which battle the bearer of it was slain. On this occasion we read nothing of any ceremonial return of it to St.-Denis. Its prestige was gone. No king ever bore it to the wars again. The kings of France adopted a new flag, 'la cornette blanche', and the old magic banner passed into oblivion. The last mention of it is in the inventory of 1594. (29)\n\nThe contents of the chapels of the chevet\n\nWith the contents of the ten chapels round the chevet, each of which contained in a chasse the body of a saint, and of the other chapels in different parts of the edifice we need not be concerned at any length. In Millet's days (p. 81) the chasses remaining were two of copper (St. Hippolyte's and one of an Innocent), the rest of wood painted and gilt, made by the Cardinal of Lorraine to replace the wrecks. Originally, he says inaccurately, all were of silver-gilt except two, and some were enriched with many jewels, but the Huguenots in 1562 and 1567 robbed and destroyed them. The inventory of 1505 (nos. 227 and later) contains a list of the treasures at that time in the chapels. They include four silver-gilt and seven copper-gilt chasses, only one of the latter being said to be enamelled, ten reliquaries (some evidently very fine), nineteen silver chalices and patens, three precious statuettes of the Virgin, and various silver lamps, candelabra, ivory and other pyxes, crucifixes, altar frontals, and other objects, beside several boxes of precious fragments fallen from chasses, and the like. In the chapel of the Abbot were seven mitres, four fine pontifical rings, and three crosiers. Finally (no. 321), in the last chapel in the nave there was a wooden monument ' and on it the figure of a man in armour, the whole very decayed and damaged, but once covered with copper-gilt, enamels, and jewels' -the finest and richest tomb in the church--and beneath it, on the pavement, a long coffer of wood, unnailed and open, containing the bones of Alphonse, Count of Eu, 'fils de Jehan de Basme, roy de Jherusalem et empereur de Constantinoble' -evidently a Limoges monument resembling that of William de Valence in Westminster Abbey. Of enamel work on such tombs splendid fragments remain at St.-Denis, from the tombs of the children of St. Louis. (30) These tombs were originally set up in the choir of the abbey of Royaumont, but have been removed to St.-Denis in recent times. They are examples of the best work of their day. It is evident that the Limoges enamellers were much employed by St. Louis for chasses and other fine objects given by him to the abbey, none of which have survived. The plaques from the tombs of his children may, however, be taken to represent the kind of work of which they were composed. A small Limoges chasse, of copper enameled and gilt, of thirteenth-century date, preserved in the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre (31) certainly belonged to St.-Denis, but I cannot identify it in the inventories. It may well enough have come from one of the chapels. Another existing Limoges chasse will be referred to later.\n\nThe Treasures of Saint Denis\n\nEarliest Period\n\nThe Vase of Cana\n\nHaving thus briefly considered the arrangement and contents of the abbey church of St.-Denis in the days of its splendour, let us now turn our attention to some of the individual treasures, whether placed permanently in the church or generally kept in the Treasury. It will be convenient to treat them in their chronological order. The most ancient still existing object, which belonged to St.- Denis, is probably the broken fragment of an alabaster vase preserved in the Cabinet des Médailles. It was already broken when engraved by Félibien,(32) and a further fragment has parted company from it since. The vase was evidently Egyptian, perhaps of Saite days, or even later. It had a slightly tapering body and a flat shoulder with two handles. It is a portion of the upper part that remains with parts of the handles. Neck and base are gone. It was fabled to have been one of the vessels used at Cana for the miracle of turning water into wine. Several so-called Cana vases still exist in ancient ecclesiastical treasuries. There is one of alabaster in Quedlinburg, Cathedral, a wedding present to the Empress Theophanu, wife of Otto II. Its broken-off handle is said to be preserved as a relic at Cologne or Aix-la-Chapelle. There is a porphyry Cana vase in Santa Maria in Porto at Ravenna, and a porphyry fragment at Hildesheim; one of pottery is at Mittelzell in Reichenau. Best of all is an Egyptian vase of grey granite inscribed with the name of Artaxerxes in the Treasury of St. Mark at Venice. This was not the only Cana Vase at Venice, for San Niccolò of the Lido claimed to possess one. There is yet another of alabaster in the Jewish gallery in the Louvre from Port-Royal, and a porphyry example with two masks in relief in Angers Museum (from the cathedral), which King René brought from the convent of St. Paul at Marseilles. These do not exhaust the list, but they are those I have personally come in contact with. All are genuine antiques, and several are of hard stones, probably Egyptian in origin. The alabaster examples are likewise probably Egyptian. (33)\n\nIt might have been suspected that the vase of Egyptian porphyry, which Suger set so splendidly with the head and wings of an eagle (pl. WII, fig. 2),would likewise be called a Cana vase, but Suger himself says nothing about it. The hard material and the-finish of the workmanship excited his admiration. This vase in the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre always attracts attention. There is something compelling about its aspect and it has been admired from that day to this. It is, however, the setting rather than the vase itself that receives the praise. We could easily make another such porphyry vase, but who now could design for it an eagle's head and wings like Suger`s ? (Editor's Note-Click here for more infromation about Suger's eagle-JV).\n\nBath of Porphyry\n\nThe great 'Cuve de porphyre' (34) now in the Cabinet des Médailles, which Suger placed behind the altar of St. Denis in the chevet of his church, is evidently an antique bath. No doubt it was made in Alexandria in early imperial days. Some wealthy Roman we may believe brought it to Gaul to furnish the bath-room of a stately palace. Thence it appears to have passed into the baptistery at Poitiers, where it was used as a font. St. Martin of Tours is said to have been baptized in it by St. Hilary. When Dagobert captured and looted Poitiers this was one of the fine things he carried away. (35) He presented it to St. Denis and there five centuries later Suger found it. Like all such great porphyry basins it is of very simple form-the size and shape of a modern bath rounded at both ends. Except for two imitation round handles carved on the front, the visible parts of the bath are quite plain. The lip is conveniently moulded for comfort of entry, and that is all; but the workmanship is excellent and the preservation perfect.\n\nCup of the Ptolemys\n\nFar more important than the foregoing objects, which are rather of manufacture than of art, is the splendid two-handled cantharus of agate, generally known as the 'Coupe des Ptolémées ', now one of the greatest treasures in the Cabinet des Médailles (fig. I).(36) It is engraved by Félibien on a large scale in the fine setting of gold and jewels with which Suger endowed it, but this was stolen and melted down in 1804, only the vase itself being recovered. The vase is so well known that we may deal with it briefly. The surface is covered with figures wrought in high relief representing Bacchic scenes and emblems. Its date may be about the first or even the second century, AD, but some think it Hellenistic. The dating of objects of this class is uncertain, as few. exist for comparison. The Farnese Tazza at Naples is the most splendid, and is probably Alexandrian work of late Hellenistic date. The Gonzaga vase at Brunswick is attributed to the age of Augustus. The beautiful ewer of St. Martin at St. Maurice d'Agaune belongs to about the same period. All these cameo-vases of sardonyx are enriched with figure-decoration. The I Hamilton vase now in the Wyndham-Cook collection, is another splendid example of such work in precious stone, but, except for two satyrs' heads, its embellishment is of foliation. it is doubtfully called Hellenistic. The beautiful Waddesdon vase in the British Museum is likewise decorated with foliation cut in cameo, but it is of later date and has even been set down to the fourth century AD, though, in my opinion, that is at least a century too late. The inscription on the foot of the 'Coupe des Ptolémées ', added by Suger, states that it was presented by Charles III, who has been wrongly assumed to be Charles the Simple. Seeing that Suger himself in his own writings calls Charles the Bald Charles III, and as Charles the Bald gave many treasures of great value to St. Denis, whereas Charles the Simple is not otherwise known to have given any, it is practically certain that Charles the Bald was the donor. (37) How he came by it we shall probably never know, but we may guess that it had belonged previously to Charlemagne. On the occasion of their coronation the queens of France, says Millet (p.110), 'prennent l'ablution en ce calice, aprés la saincte communion'.\n\nScepter of Dagobert\n\nThe golden sceptre (38), called the sceptre of Dagobert, raises questions no longer answerable. Doublet describes it in detail, and Félibien's engraving helps us to picture it. He notes that some antiquaries of his day thought it to have been a consular staff. On the top was a golden group of Ganymede carried by an eagle, each of whose wings was set with four emeralds and a garnet surrounded by eight pearls. This was planted on a globe held by a hand, with likewise a little branch garnished with pearls, enamels, and coral. The hand was at the end of a golden rod, also enameled and set with stones. Probably the summit group and perhaps other parts of this sceptre were antique, but it is unlikely that we shall ever know more about it.\n\nThrone of Dagobert\n\nThe bronze throne of Dagobert, on which the kings of France were crowned, was repaired and used for Napoleon and is still in existence-one of the most interesting pieces of furniture that have come to us from antiquity (pl. V, fig. 2`).(39) St. Eloy was said to has e made it, but this is no longer believed. St. Eloy did make two chairs for Dagobert, as his eighth-century biography clearly records, but they appear to have been a pair, and one of them was certainly of gold and set with gems. There is no reason why the chair from St.-Denis in the Cabinet des Medailles must be one of these, though Suger thought it was. Modern archaeologists are of opinion that it is more ancient, and that it is a Roman Curule Chair, of the folding X type, which maintained itself from the days of ancient Egypt down to the sixteenth century. On ivory diptychs of the sixth century consuls are seated in such chairs as this, which brings us down to a date not far removed from Dagobert. Of course it originally had no back-piece and only the lower, narrow member of the arms. Suger added the upper members with foliated scrolls and the back-piece, all finely cast in bronze, and an authoritative example of the kind of bronze casting that was done at St.-Denis in the twelfth century. As for the rough clamps and other coarse mends, they were the work of some common blacksmith, botching the thing together for Napoleon's coronation.\n\nCup of Solomon\n\nThe famous bowl of Chosroes II, Sassanian king of Persia (AD 590-628), is another precious object so well known as to call only for brief mention here (pl. VI). Charles the Bald is said to have given it to St.-Denis. The bowl is of gold; the medallions of crystal, and red and green coloured glass are set in it à jour. The large central medallion is finely cut into a cameo of Chosroes seated on his throne, and it is scarcely necessary to remark that, in the Middle Ages, this was believed to be a likeness of Solomon in all his glory. (40)\n\nRelics of Saint Denis\n\nFive relics were said to have belonged to St. Denis himself-two staves, a ring, a chalice, and an inkstand. (Editor's note: click here for an image -JV) Of the two staves, we have seen that one was attached to a pillar in the chevet behind the altar of the Saint. (41) This was the top end only of his pastoral staff, or, as Millet says, ' le crosson qui n'estoit que de bois, maintenant est couvert d'or, enrichi d'émaux et de pierreries, et de 48 perles orientales'. Félibien's print shows it as a most peculiarly shaped, wide opened crook, with a fleur-de-lis stuck on at the end. The decoration may not date from before the time of Suger, and the fleur-de-lis looks like a yet later addition. Dublin Museum possesses several examples of the staves of Irish saints thus embellished.\n\nThe other staff is called the walking-stick of St. Denis.(42) This was quite as elaborately mounted; it was inscribed ' Baculus Beati Dionysii Areopagitae'. Neither of these relics survives, and we can gather little from Félibien's engraving; but the splendidly mounted fragment of the staff of St. Peter in the cathedral of Limburg-on-the-Lahn is an existing example of the way such relics were treated towards the end of the tenth century.(43)\n\nAs for St. Denis's inkstand, we can do no more than reproduce the engraving (pl. VII, fig. I) of it inserted by E3. de Montfaucon in his Palaegraphia Graeca (Paris, 1708, p. 23), and add a translation (44) of the description with which he accompanied it. The object itself may have been at least as old as the fifth century of our era.\n\nIn the treasury of the monastery of Saint-Denis in France there is an inkstand of the most remote antiquity, for the use, once upon a time, as they think, of Saint Denis, the first bishop of Paris. It is a tablet of ebony, of the shape and size here depicted. From the middle of the lowest, which is also the narrower part of the tablet, there stands out a case constructed with four holes for putting in four reed-pens; since the holes are bigger than would be necessary for putting in quill-pens. At the top, which is broader, the tablet is faced on both sides with silver-plate, about a thumb's breadth, ornamented with birds and other figures. Likewise the top of the case is enclosed with a silver plate, where the four holes are. And in the same way the bottom of the case, which is narrower, is faced with a silver plate ornamented with figures. The four edges of the case are held from top to bottom by four little plates of silver which are smaller and held on by silver nails, as you can see in the engraving. The lower part of the case is covered with blackish leather ornamented with designs. The vessel for the ink is of wood, likewise covered with blackish leather, and edged round the top with a silver plate, and it contains another vessel of bronze for receiving the ink. The original lid of that has long ago perished; but the one now remaining, substituted several centuries ago, is different both in material and shape and is already worn away and damaged by age. On each side of the wooden tablet there are rings for passing a cord or strap through, by which the whole contrivance used to be hung up. On the upper part of the tablet in an unornamented round space there projects a movable ring of brass, made up of four semicircles, from which the ink-vessel is suspended.\n\nTo this rather verbose description there is little to add. The engraving seems to be accurate, but it is possible that the decoration may have been refined by the engraver. The ornament at the top presents a singular resemblance to that of a gilt bronze brooch of which two examples exist in the Mayence Museum, one of them engraved with runes attributed to the fifth or sixth century. The clamps which hold the cord-rings closely resemble a strap-fastening from Charnay, now in the Musée de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which is probably of the fifth century, so that that may be the approximate date for 'L'escriptouere monsr sainct Denis' of the 1505 inventory. (45)\n\nSerpentine Paten\n\nIn the Galerie d'Apollon is a well-known paten (pl. VII I, fig. I) made of a disc of green serpentine set in a border of gold and gems. (46) Eight golden dolphins were inlaid in the serpentine, whereof one had been already lost in 1634 and another has fallen out since. The inventory of 1634 also notes the stones gone from the setting. Félibien falls into an error in grouping this paten with the chalice of Suger. All the earlier authorities clearly state that it belonged with the ' Coupe des Ptolémées'. It is always considered to have been of Carolingian date, yet I have no doubt but that it was, in fact, made in the East, perhaps at Byzantium, about the time of Justinian. The probability is that both the splendid agate chalice and this paten came together as gifts from some Eastern emperor to Charlemagne or some other king of the Franks. Such gifts were constantly coming from quite early days and are frequently recorded. The chalice most likely belonged to the imperial treasure, which by the sixth century retained almost a monopoly of such objects. Treasures of that kind, if carried off as loot by barbarian chieftains, soon met an untimely end by rough usage. Only in the ancient world were there hands deft enough to preserve them through such troublous times as the fifth to the ninth centuries. Probably it was to Charlemagne himself that both chalice and paten were sent, and Charles the Bald gave both together to the abbey of St.-Denis. The gold dolphins are a common Early Christian decorative feature, descending from an ancient Greek tradition. Constantine the Great gave a gold lamp to St. Peter's, which was adorned with figures of dolphins. A dolphin is engraved on the back of the top stone of the Ecrin de Charlemagne, the other side of which bears a Greek monogram. There is a Byzantine intaglio of a dolphin in the Cabinet des Médailles (no. 340), and instances might be multiplied. The border, moreover, is of early date. There are no pastes but only stones, and these are set in plain, closely-fitting box mounts. The heart-shaped designs are of Eastern form, similar to those on the little gold chalice of Gourdon in the Cabinet des Médailles, which was clearly made by an Eastern craftsman. The arrangement of the red cylindrical stones round the outer edge with a ring of gold between each is paralleled (47) in the Bowl of Chosroes and the golden fibula with three tails found at Nagy Mihçly in Hungary, now in the Hofmuseum at Vienna, a fine example of East Roman work of about the fifth century (pl. VIII, fig. 2). The absence of all filigree and enamel, the plainness of the chatons, the strong design, the lack of exactness in symmetry-all these features point to a date as early as the sixth or even the fifth century, and to the Eastern Empire as the place of manufacture for the St.-Denis paten. (48)\n\nMerovingian Treasures\n\nGolden Spoon\n\nThe earliest object of Merovingian make of which we receive a hint, unless the inkstand of St.- Denis be Western, is a gold spoon (49) 'of ancient fashion' pierced with many holes, and used as a strainer over a chalice. We have no representation of the spoon, but its recorded aspect of antiquity suggests that it may have been one of the perforated spoons which were not uncommonly used by Anglo-Saxons and Franks in the sixth and seventh centuries for some unknown purpose, and have been found several times in association with crystal balls. One of silver, set with garnets, was found at Chatham (50), others came from Sarre, Bifrons, Sibertswold, and Stodmarsh, all in Kent; and yet others from Crundale, Hunts., and Chessell Down, I. W.. These are all of the sixth century. Somewhat later is a fine silver example in Prag Museum from Svetec. (51) Germany has yielded one, and four were found in France (Dept. Aisne) by Moreau whereof two are in the Musée de Saint-Germain. A spoon of this character might easily have been given to St.-Denis in the time of Dagobert, and thus survived down to the Revolution A perforated spoon of early date is figured by Rohault de Fleury. (52) Two silver examples are, or were, in the Barberini collection. 'Theophilus, in the eleventh century, describes how such spoons should be made, and that is not the last of them. The St.-Denis spoon, therefore, need not necessarily go back to the time of Dagobert.\n\nSt. Eloi\n\nCharacteristic works in precious metals of Dagobert's day are those which' were attributed to St. Eloy and artists contemporary with him. It should be remembered that all through the dark ages, approximately from the sixth to the end of the tenth centuries, Orfévrerie was the leading art.(Note- \"orfévrerie\" generaly means \"works made by goldsmith\"-JV) As a rule, work in jewelry and the precious metals is a minor art, employing the hands of crafts: men of a rank subordinate to that of artists in architecture, sculpture, or painting. But at the time with which we are dealing, it was not so. Architects, sculptors, and painters were the minor artists; goldsmiths were the great artists. Just as the thirteenth century was the great age of architecture, and the fifteenth and sixteenth of painting, so the period from the seventh to the eleventh century was a great age of Orfévrerie. Some of the leading men of the day were goldsmiths, and such as St. Eloy.\n\nHe was born about 588 near Limoges, and received his training in the workshop of Abbon, the local coiner and goldsmith of that city. Having favourably impressed Clotaire II, he was appointed by him head of his Mint, and was made Treasurer by Dagobert. Like other studious or artistic persons of those days, he was impelled to seek a quiet life in a monastery, but he was dragged forth into affairs again in 640 and appointed bishop of Noyon. He was famed as a preacher. He made missionary journeys. He died in 663. Whether living as an official, as a monk, as a bishop, or as a statesman, his main work and interest in life was the designing and making of splendid works of Orfévrerie--chasses, altar-frontals, tombs, chalices, and the like. Just as Rubens might perform the functions of a diplomatist, while remaining always and above everything a painter, so the Bishop of Noyon, while satisfactorily episcopating, remained essentially an artist, and, what is more, the greatest Western artist of his day. Dagobert, of course, had the chief claim on his services and gave to St.-Denis several works by the splendid minister-goldsmith.\n\nCross of St. Eloy\n\nPrincipal amongst these by universal repute was the magnificent cross always known as 'the Cross of St. Eloy'. Many descriptions and one painting of it have come down to us (pl. II).(53) Doublet says this cross was of the height of a man. The inventory of 1739 states that it was six feet high or thereabouts. In the midst of the cross was an agate cameo, assuredly antique. At the bottom, under a glass, was a small enameled reliquary containing a piece of the True Cross which may have resembled the early Byzantine Beresford-Hope reliquary in the Victoria and Albert Museum. There were numerous precious stones on it, and all the ground on the front and back of it was inlaid with glass mosaic of various colours (like the chasse at St.-Maurice d Agaune), as we]l as with pieces of mother-of-pearl. The metal of it was gold and silver, except for a certain attached repoussée copper-gilt plaque with the images of St. Denis and two angels which was fastened at the foot of the back of the cross. This cross was made to stand above the High altar, and there it was placed by Dagobert and left by Suger, who describes it as 'illam ammirabilem sancti Eligii crucem'. It was still there in 1505, according to the inventory, in which it is briefly described as ' une grant croix d'or, les bordures d'argent, (54) nommée la croix sainct Eloy ', and it is depicted in this position over the retable of Charles the Bald in the painting of the \"Mass of St. Giles\".(55) In the days of Doublet and Millet (seventeenth century) the cross of St. Eloy had been moved and was over the place where the Matutinal altar had stood. It was on a great beam painted blue and dotted with gold fleurs-de-lis which Doublet says was 'au bout du Choeur tirant vers le maistre autel', and which Millet describes as 'cette longue pièce de bois azurée et semée de fleurs de lys qui traverse le choeur par le bout des chaires'. In the inventory of 1739 it is stated to be standing 'on the grille of the choir'.\n\nThe picture of the Mass of St. Giles, which now belongs to Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie, and was kindly lent by her to the Society for the meeting, enables us to fill out the written descriptions of this cross. It is, however, surprising to find that the cross shown is very far short of ù ft. high or of the height of a man. We are forced to conclude that a stem, hidden behind the retable, accounted for a considerable fraction of the total. It will be observed that the cross is not actually on the top of the retable but just behind it, so that the existence of such a stem is implied. In other respects the description and the picture are in fair, agreement. In the middle of the crossing is a kind of quatrefoil medallion with a cameo head in the centre. The ground is evidently inlaid with flat stones, and the small white cruciform spaces may be filled with mother-of-pearl. At the foot is the little frame that contained the small cross inscribed ' de cruce dni '. There are large jewels at intervals down the front, and there is a string of pearls set all round the inlaid field.\n\nVase of St. Eloi\n\nSt. Eloy made a splendid tomb for St.-Denis and several chasses for the abbey, but these need not detain us, as there is too little known about them. A piece of his handiwork almost came down to our time. This was a jade gondola which he mounted in gold and pastes. It was one of theca small number of the treasures of St.-Denis that escaped the Revolution and was placed in what should have been the security of the Cabinet des Médailles. But in 1804 robbers got at it and some other precious objects, and it has never been seen since. There is indeed in the Cabinet des Médailles a jade gondola (no. 374) which claims to be this one, but is of altogether different forrn.(57) De Linas, by the help of Félibien's engraving and the detailed description in the inventory of 1634, succeeded in making a restoration of it, which is here reproduced (pl. IX, fig. I). It must be admitted to be rather difficult to see in the reconstruction the great beauty which beholders seem to have united to find in the vase itself. It was set and rimmed with gold and adorned with sapphires, garnets, plasmas, and seventy oriental pearls. The nature of the stone puzzled all the old writers, who did not know jade, and this may have had something to do with its prestige. Félibien seems to have been the first to call it jade. Though made by St. Eloy, this gondola was not given to St.- Denis by Dagobert in the seventh century, but by Suger in the twelfth. It had been part of the royal treasure till Louis le Gros pawned it. Ten years later he allowed Suger to redeem it and present it to St.-Denis.(58) Suger describes it thus: ' Quod vas tam pro pretiosi lapidis qualitate quam integra sui quantitate mirificum, inclusorio sancti Eligii opere constat esse ornatum, quod omnium aurificum iudicio pretiosissimum aestimatur.'\n\nShoulder of John the Baptist\n\nLittle need be said about the silver-gilt reliquary of the shoulder of John Baptist, another of Dagobert's gifts to St.-Denis.(59) The engraving shows an obviously Gothic reliquary. (Editor's note: Click here to see image-JV)All the authorities, however, refer to it as an ancient (Byzantine) casket which the Emperor Heraclius sent as a gift to Dagobert. The inventory of 1739 knows enough to describe the style of it as Gothic, and yet continues: 'ledit reliquaire a été donné à l'abbaye par le roy Dagobert.' Millet leaves it doubtful whether it was the reliquary or only the relic that Heraclius sent. Thus we have no account of what the Byzantine reliquary was like, or when and why it was replaced by the one engraved.\n\nMerovingian Eagles\n\nOn Félibien's plates(i and ii, our pl. III) there are representations of two eagles with spread wings set with gems. One is attached to the nail-reliquary, the other is an independent ornament and was believed to be the mantle-clasp of Dagobert. The latter is frequently mentioned.(Editor's note- click here for image-JV) (60) Doublet describes it as 'an eagle, very rich, of gold embellished with fine sapphires, rubies, and other jewels'. The inventory of 1739 specially mentions one big sapphire which Millet says was on the stomach of the bird and was one of the finest sapphires ever seen. As for the other eagle attached to the chasse, (Editor's note- click here for image-JV)it may be the silver-gilt eagle set with stones of the inventory of 1505 (no. 38). Millet (p. 125) also refers to a silver-gilt eagle set with stones, 'qui a aussi servy d'agraffe à quelque manteau royal'. Both eagles, he adds, were of about the size of a skylark. It is evident that these eagle-clasps are a later development of the same type as the two bronze-gilt brooches in the Cluny Museum from Valence d'Agen, and the similar gold brooch from Ravenna which belongs to the German Museum at Nuremberg. (61) Authorities are divided in the attribution of them to Byzantine or Gothic craftsmen. It is evident, however, that the type was admired by the rich men of the new peoples, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and the rest, and that it continued to be made down to the days of Dagobert and perhaps even later.\n\nBracelets of Queen Nanthilde\n\nThe last gift to St.-Denis of the time of Dagobert that calls for brief mention is the pair of bracelets that belonged to his queen Nanthilde. Doublet describes them (p. 245) as 'so rare and exquisite as not to be compared with any other'. Suger attached one of them to the middle of the cross of Charlemagne and the other to the reliquary of the head of St. Denis. They had disappeared before the time of the earliest inventory.\n\nCarolingian Objects\n\nBracelets and other gifts of Pepin\n\nAnother pair of bracelets of great value was given to St.-Denis by Pepin, the next royal donor with whom we have to concern ourselves. These had belonged to Waifar (Doublet calls him Gayfier), Duke of Aquitaine, with whom Pepin waged a war of life and death from 760 to 768. Aquitaine had enjoyed relative tranquillity for many years, so that the arts had been able to flourish there, notably in the city of Limoges, where St. Eloy learnt his craft. In the last year of Pepin's life, 768, he finally overthrew and slew Waifar after utterly devastating his whole country. Pepin took the splendid bracelets from him and caused them to be attached behind the High altar of St.-Denis on the front of the Martyrium, which we discussed at length above.(62) They were called, says Doublet, 'les Pierres Gaifiéres'. Suger took them away from this place (when he moved the bodies of the saints) and fixed them over the arms of the crucifix on the great cross which he set up as aforesaid. Pepin's other important gifts were the above-mentioned gold figures of SS. Peter and Paul on the porphyry columns, and a splendid square retable covered with gold and jewels, which Suger appears to have placed over the altar of St.-Denis in the chevet.(63)\n\nScreen of Charlemagne\n\nA number of precious objects said to have belonged to Charlemagne was included in the list of the treasures of St.-Denis; they were not, however, gifts of the great Emperor, but were presented by Charles the Bald. Finest among them was the famous 'Éscrin de Charlemagne ', of which Félibien has preserved an unsatisfactory representation. (64) Fortunately a good, large-scale, coloured drawing of it exists in the Cabinet des Estampes (pl. X). It has been reproduced by Monsieur J. Guibert in the book above cited, where he shows that the drawing was made after the 30th of September, 1791, and shortly before the destruction of the Écrin in the public mint. In form it was a kind of upright scaffolding, shaped like the facade of a church, and resembling in a general way the arcaded framing which decorates the pages of the Eusebian canons at the beginning of Carlovingian manuscript gospels. The inventory of 1505 says it was of silver-gilt that of 1739 describes it as all of gold, covered with pearls and precious stones. In Félibien's engraving it is shown with a Gothic base, an addition made in the time of Abbot Philippe de Villette (1363-1398), including a sort of long box with crystal windows to display the relics within. On the top of this box is a row of great jewels running all along the foot of the facade. The lower story of it is an arcading of four round arches, from the summit of each of which depends a crown, made of jewels strung together. Higher up is a second arcading with various pendent devices in jewels; whilst within the pediment above are yet more such devices. At the top of all is an antique gem surrounded by eight jewels; this is the small portion that still exists, from which alone we can gain some idea of the character of the whole work. It was enriched with an extra ordinary multitude of precious stones, each being separately described and valued in the inventory of 1634.\n\nThe centre of the surviving top member is a very fine beryl or aquamarine with an intaglio portrait of Julia, daughter of Titus (fig. 2), one of the best glyptic portraits in the world, signed with the name of the artist, Euodos. It was set face downwards on a foil of gold which caused the head to appear like a relief. It is not unlikely that this gem, which must have belonged to the Roman imperial treasure, was sent to Charlemagne as a gift from the Byzantine court. A confirmation of this supposition is supplied by the uppermost of the surrounding jewels, one side of which is engraved with a dolphin, the other with a Byzantine monogram of the letters A M e X .... . But if the stones are of Byzantine provenance, the setting is Western. Each gem is held by a band of metal soldered within a stout ring of the same, and from the extremity of each springs a little metal stem and calyx(65) holding a fine oriental pearl, pinned through on to it. The workmanship may be called rough, but is highly decorative, and implies for the whole écrin a splendour of effect which is not easily re-created even by an instructed imagination.\n\nNail Relic\n\nAmong the treasures gathered together by Charlemagne and deposited by him at Aix-la-Chapelle were the following- famous relics: part of the Crown of Thorns (including eight thorns), one holy nail, one piece of the cross, the sudarium of Christ, the swaddling clothes of Christ, the Virgin's shift, and the arm of St. Simeon. Charles the Bald is related, in the Descriptio above cited, to have given the first three and 'alia quoque multa' to St.-Denis. The sudarium was deposited at Compiègne. The gift of the nail and crown was recorded on his tomb. Holy nails are not uncommon relics, but whereas there should not be more than four of them at most, upwards of thirty are still preserved at Monza, Rome, Venice, Nuremberg Prague, and so forth. They may have been multiplied, like the key relics of St. Peter's chains, by being copied out of ordinary iron with a little fragment of some master-relic welded into them. (66) Constantine was said to have had two of the true nails. It was related that one of them was wrought into the bit for his horse and the other affixed to his helmet. Both Carpentras and Milan claim to possess the former, while the latter is said to exist within the splendid crown at Monza. Millet states that Charlemagne obtained his nail as a gift from Constantine V. At St.-Denis it had a chequered history. (67) What the original case that contained it was like is not recorded, but it may have been of the form of the beautiful tenth- century nail-reliquary still preserved in the cathedral at Trèves. It was at any rate small, for Charles VI (C. 1397) gave a bigger reliquary in which, on a silver-gilt base, were gold figures of Charlemagne and St. Louis holding the old reliquary, whilst other gold figures kneeling represented himself, his queen, and his eldest son. This, however, did not survive the troublous times, so that in 1642 a new one was made, and this it is that Félibien's print depicts. He likewise tells a capital story about how, in the year 1233, one day when relics were being venerated by the populace and the nail was held out to a poor woman to be kissed, it fell into her lap, and she went off with it, feeling something heavy and hoping it was gold. She hurried home and found only a bit of iron to which she attached no consequence. Meanwhile the loss of the nail had been obserxred. the abbey doors were locked too late and every one was searched, of course with no result. How the relic was recovered is too long a tale to set down here and must be sought in the pages of Félibien.\n\nCross of Charlemagne\n\nThe third important treasure at St.-Denis which belonged to Charlemagne was a famous cross, said to have come out of the emperor's private chapel. There can be no doubt that it was the work of his day or even before, so that the tradition that assigns it to him is quite credible. It was one of the gifts of Charles the Bald. This is not the cross of St. Eloy above referred to and so carefully depicted over the High altar in the painting of the Mass of St. Giles. The inventory of 1534 minutely describes the cross of Charlemagne, and Félibien likewise gives an engraving of it. (68) The inventory of 1505 is very vague about it, but implies that then it was in the Treasury. The manuscript inventory of 1634 is full of detail, and De Linas carefully studied it. Doublet describes it as adorned in the middle by a very fine oriental amethyst hollowed out within like a cup, and enriched with emeralds, sapphires, garnets, and pearls, containing also many holy relics. He also states that Charles the Bald had it set up between his tomb and the Matutinal altar, and that in the midst of it was fastened one of the bracelets of Queen Nanthilde, but here he is only citing the statement of Suger himself. (69) The inventories inform us that this cross was 2 1/2 ft. high, and the arms 2 1/4 ft. in span, and they highly prize the amethyst, which is plainly seen as a large one in Félibien's engraving. De Linas cleverly shows that the ground of Charlemagne's cross was covered with green pastes and garnets set within circular metal cloisons, the green pastes being circular and the garnets filling up the interstices between the circles. This appears to conform closely with what we see as the ground of the cross of St. Eloy. We must therefore conclude that the crosses of Charlemagne and St. Eloy were work of the same school and perhaps even of about the same date.\n\nCross of Saint Lawrence\n\nCharles the Bald was said to have given another gold cross which Félibien caused to be engraved. (70) The arrangement of the jewels on this cross resembles that on Charlemagne's, but its four ends break out into large fleurs-de-lis, and the whole has a less convincingly early aspect. It was called the Cross of St. Laurence, because the substance of it was made of two bars of the gridiron of his martyrdom. At a late date it was changed into a processional cross by the addition of a socket of silver-gilt to fit it to a staff. It was decorated with cabochon sapphires, garnets (some hollowed out, others pointed), pearls, and enamels. The presence of enamels shows that this cross can scarcely date from the time of Charles the Bald.\n\nSword of Charlemagne\n\nThe monks of St.-Denis believed themselves to possess the royal insignia of Charlemagne, including a crown, sword, spurs, hand of justice, and scepter. Modern critics have decided that all of these objects are of later date, but I am inclined to doubt the attribution of part at any rate of the sword to as late a date as the twelfth century (pl.V, fig. I). Doubtless it has been subjected in the process of time to many restorations and repairs. The blade may be, as is claimed, medieval, and the grip modern, but the pommel finds no corresponding neighbors so far as I can discover amongst objects of the twelfth century. It was therefore with no little pleasure that I met with a different interpretation of it given by Monsieur Dieulafoy in his L'Art antique de la Perse (vol. v, p. 164). He calls attention to the pair of attached wings and the ornament rising above them, and points out how they reproduce in their form, their disposition, their style, and their most minute details the emblematic wings which surmount the tiara of the latest Sassanian kings. The central ornament is a mixed solar and lunar emblem. 'La broderie, les entrelacs formés par les oiseaux, la forme, et surtout la disposition si particulière des ailes, et l'aspect de la garde elle-même, accusent une filiation perse sassanide incontestable.' He does not think the actual workmanship oriental, but holds that it was done in the West by some Western craftsman imitating a Sassanian original of about A.D. 640. With the pommel go necessarily the quillons, so that, if M. Dieulafoy is right, the sword in its original condition may have been made for or belonged to Charlemagne, and may be the sword named 'Joyeuse',(71) as was reputed at St.-Denis. It should be added that the grip of the hilt was remade for the coronation of Napoleon, and the blade is asserted to be of the same modern date. A drawing in the Gagnière Collection shows the whole in its original state. The blue velvet and fleurs-de-lis were added to the scabbard in 1824 for Charles X's coronation. The reset gems may have belonged to the original. The inventory of 1505 includes three other swords. (72 Of these, one was said to have been carried by St. Louis on his first Crusade; another belonged to Charles VII; the third had the name of Archbishop Turpin attached to it. None of them exists at the present day; neither does the sword of Jeanne d'Arc, which Doublet (p. 347) and Millet (p. 134) mention.\n\nOther Objects\n\nThe remaining objects at St.-Denis traditionally associated with Charlemagne were all of later date. They included a set of ivory chessmen and chessboard, a crown, spurs, hand of justice, and scepter. We shall deal with them later. It was not Charlemagne himself but his grandson, Charles the Bald, who presented to St.-Denis the various treasures which may have belonged to the great Emperor. He also gave the bowl of Chosroes, the 'Coupe des Ptolémées ', and a so-called unicorn's horn. The tusk of the male narwhal whale, or seaunicorn, generally figured among medieval relics as a unicorn's. Such tusks may be from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in length. The fabulous unicorn, however, was believed to be a native of India. It was depicted with the body of a horse, the tail of a lion, and a long straight horn growing out of the middle of the forehead. It was employed as an emblem of chastity. The belief in the efficacy of these tusks as an antidote to poison lingered on into the seventeenth century, when one of them, brought home from Spitzbergen in 1615, was sent out to India with the merchant fleet next year and offered for sale at a high price to Shah Jehan and others. But the scientific spirit was already abroad and they would not purchase it, because it failed to save the life of a poor fellow who was poisoned for the experiment! The St.-Denis tusk was 6 ft, 7 in. long, and was fabled to have been sent to Charlemagne by 'Aaron, King of Persia', about the year 807. We have seen above how it was fixed over the Matutinal altar in the time of Suger.(73) Doublet states that in his day it was in the Chapel of St. Louis. He writes a whole chapter (xliii) to disprove the statement of some skeptics that no such beast as a unicorn exists. It is full of entertainment. Incidentally he gives a list of unicorn relics known to him. St.-Denis likewise possessed some elephants' teeth, the claw of a griffin, and other curiosities, regarded as semi-relics.\n\nCharles the Bald was also said to have given a copper-gilt lantern set with thirty-five crystals, which disappeared between 1505 and 1739. (74) In 1505 it is simply called a lantern. Doublet says it belonged to Malchus, that it was of a very old-fashioned type, and that the light shone dimly through the crystals. He observes that it shows the mark of St. Peter's sword, Malchus having held up the lantern to defend himself, but the sword glanced off one of the crystals and took away his ear. Both he and Millet say it was called the lantern of Judas. At the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford is a bronze lantern of about the twelfth century, set with twenty-five crystals, which may give some idea of what the other was like.\n\nWe cannot delay over most of Charles the Bald's other recorded gifts-his crown, the rich altar- tables, the horn of Roland, a great vase of amber, a large silver bowl plated with gold, seven silver lamps (to burn in memory of certain relations and friends), and seven great silver candelabra- because nothing of special interest is recorded about them and they have utterly vanished. Many of them may have been of later date.(75)\n\nGolden Altar Frontal\n\nOne great treasure, however, the great golden altar-frontal-unquestionably, I think, given to St.- Denis by Charles the Bald, and utterly destroyed in the Revolution-is, in part at any rate, depicted with care in the painting of the Mass of St. Giles where it is seen as a retable above the Maitre Autel (pl. XI). The small scale of the picture made it impossible to depict every stone, so that the artist w as constrained to some simplification of the great masses of jewels with which the gold plaques were set, and of which we can read the tale, stone by stone, in the inventory of 1634, or in Doublet's pages. (76) The means thus placed at our disposal enable us to reconstitute the frontal with tolerable accuracy and even to feel something of its splendour and beauty. When it was made it was by no means a unique gift to a church which a powerful king or wealthy bishop delighted to honour. The ninth-century gold altar-casing in the Cathedral at St. Ambrose at Milan is the only surviving contemporary example of this kind of work, but in the great days of Orfévrerie Europe had many such to show. In the nature of things few of them could survive; still it is rather tantalizing to remember that the grandfathers of plenty of people still living might have beheld this frontal of Charles the Bald, and yet that the only representation of it has to be sought in the background of a small painting of the fifteenth century. I have seen it stated that the frontal was originally a triptych, and that it was made into the form in which we see it by Suger. Such was not the case. Suger left it in the main as he found it. Some repair or addition may have been made to the original frame, but nothing more. It is likewise wrongly stated that Suger made a retable of it. This was not so. He continued to use it as a frontal, and added three other sides. (77)\n\nIn 1505 it was used as a retable, and so it appears in the picture of the Mass of St. Giles, to which we must now refer. We see that the face of it was an expanse of gold embossed with designs and figures, and richly set with gems The main division is into three panels side by side, each surmounted by a round arch supported on pilasters. There are wonderful masses of jewels in the spandrels. Five-sixths of the central panel are visible and about two-thirds of the left, whilst only the top of the right appears above the head of the officiating priest.\n\nThe central panel contains a figure of Christ enthroned, surrounded by a mandorla of a figure-of- eight shape, the upper lobe being much larger than the lower. A similar mandorla is found on a fine ivory, once in the Odiot Collection and now in the Berlin Museum., which presents other features of agreement with our altar-piece, so that there is no doubt but that both came from the same school and were of about the same date. The ivory (Goldschmidt, no. 23) is assigned to the so-called Ada Group; that is to say, it belongs to the group of ivories that resemble a number of manuscripts made for Carlovinogian emperors in some workshop maintained by them. (78) The Christ of the Berlin ivory is beardless, and is blessing after the Greek manner, a sufficient indication of where the influence came from that affected the carver. In the vacant space by either shoulder is a six- winged seraph, and the like is seen on the altar-piece outside the closer fitting mandorla. The central gold-repoussé panel of the binding of St. Emmeran's Gospels at Munich shows (Christ in a similar mandorla surrounded by eight-rayed stars. The repoussé plates in question probably belonged to the original binding of the manuscript when it was given by Charles the Bald in the first instance to St.-Denis, and they may even have been wrought at St.-Denis. The binding was redecorated at Ratisbon after Emperor Arnould had taken it away from St.-Denis and presented it to St. Emmeran's Abbey. (79) A comparison should also be made with the central panel of the frontal of the golden altar in the church of St. Ambrose at Milan.\n\nThe painting shows a rich setting of jewels, but it is only when we read the detailed description of the inventory that we realize the wealth of jewels actually employed, far more numerous than the painter could possibly reproduce on the scale of his work. Even at the risk of some prolixity it may be well to set down what is related about a small portion of the work. The cross in the hand of Christ was set with garnets, plasmas, amethysts, and pearls and with a fine aquamarine like an eye. There were twenty-eight garnets in the nimbus as well as three large sapphires, four plasmas, and sixteen very fine pearls; also on the cross of the nimbus were eight garnets, two plasmas, and two knobs set with garnets, also eighteen more pearls. The border of the robe was garnished with twenty-two garnets, thirteen plasmas, and thirteen pearls. The edge of the throne had twelve garnets, seventeen sapphires, nine plasmas, and twenty-nine pearls. On the binding of the book held in the left hand was a great jewel called a 'strin' surrounded by twenty-four pearls, with four sapphires at the corners, four plasmas, two garnets, and the edges set with garnets. On the background around the figure were seven heart-shaped settings of garnets with two larger ones artfully shaped, also twelve crosslets of garnets with a pearl to each, and chalcedonies at each side of the hands. There were likewise an alpha and an omega, each of six plasmas, six garnets, and six pearls. The footstool contained one great and four smaller garnets, two sapphires, eighteen plasmas, and fifteen pearls. The mandorla held two hundred and three pearls, thirteen plasmas, and at the top of it a big hollowed aquamarine and a fine sapphire. Over this was a tablet with a similar aquamarine, surrounded by twenty-two large, rough pearls, sapphires in the four corners, seven plasmas, four garnets, and a fine engraved chrysolite gem, and so forth. It is hardly necessary to continue the enumeration, which, for the whole altar-piece, fills twenty-seven folio pages in the manuscript inventory.\n\nThe two side panels resembled one another. The lower part was filled by an arcade of three round arches with a saint holding a book in his left hand under each. They had jeweled nimbi and there was a jeweled star over the head of each. There were also twenty-four jeweled crosslets on the background around them (a Carlovingian feature which can be paralleled from the ivory). Above these arches were two angels and between them a pendent crown adorned with three rows of pearls. The jeweled chains from which the crowns seemed to hang, like the crowns of Guarrazar, were held by a hand under the top of the great encompassing arch, and of course these great arches and the pilasters below them were likewise a mass of jewels. Enough has perhaps been said to give the reader some notion of the matchless splendour of this wonderful work, which the French Revolutionists broke up into its component parts of stones and gold. (80)\n\nWe shall probably never know the name of the artist who presided over the making of this wonderful work, but the question as to where it was made may not remain unanswerable. It was perhaps in the abbey of St. Denis itself. Labarte (p. 368) points out that a school of goldsmiths of high repute existed in Carlovingian days within the abbey. A letter of Abbot Loup de Ferriéres of the first half of the ninth century expresses his gratitude for the admission to this school of two of his young monks. Carlovingian goldsmiths, in fact, rivaled their contemporaries at Constantinople, so that the Patriarch of Grado, for instance, obtained precious pieces of work for his church both from the Eastern capital and from Carlovingian workshops.\n\nCameo of Augustus\n\nA charming fragment of jewelry (81) in the Cabinet des Medailles (no. 234) was taken off the reliquary of the head of Saint-Hilaire, made in 1606, where it was fastened below the neck in the middle of the orphrey of the collar of the cope. Of course it came from some much earlier work, the nature of which is not recorded. It consists of a beautifully carved sardonyx cameo of Augustus, of the best Roman days, set in a wreath of jewels, simply but most effectively held together (pl. XII, fig. I). The six large stones, rubies alternating with sapphires, are separated by little groups of irregularly shaped pearls, three in each group. The great stones are held by claws. Few pieces of ancient jewelry exceed this fragment in simple but very subtle charm. Every time I see it in the Cabinet des Médailles it seems to me more beautiful than before. The setting has been so much tampered with that it is difficult to date it. It may be as late as the thirteenth century.\n\nCrystal Ewer\n\nThe tenth century is the approximate date of a fine crystal ewer (82) preserved in the Louvre among the treasures of Mussulman art to which it properly belongs (pl. XIII, fig. 2). Charles the Bald is said to have given it to St.-Denis, but it can scarcely have existed in his day. In the British Museum is a crystal reliquary said to have belonged to harles the Bald, but that is absolutely plain work which might have been produced in the ninth century when Egyptian and Syrian craftsmen were perhaps just beginning to tackle the difficult problem of crystal carving. The .St.- Denis ewer is the work of a practiced workman of Fatimite days, living probably in Cairo not earlier than the tenth century, nor much later It retains its g-old lid and the chain attaching it to the handle. It is cut, handle and all, out of a single block of crystal. Three crystal ewers of this type and date are known. The second is in the Treasury of St. Mark at Venice; the third in the Victoria and Albert Museum. At Berlin is the cast of another which vas once at Cologne but is now lost. The date of all these ewers is about the tenth century and they came from one centre. The Venice example is securely dated between the years 975 and 996. Its handle is surmounted by the figure of a recumbent ibex; another such ibex has been partly broken off both from the Louvre and the London specimens. The Arabic inscription, which Millet noticed on the St.-Denis ewer, means ' Peace and content to the donor'. Parroquets and foliation have been laboriously carved with the wheel on the body of the jug in relief. No European artist could have made anything like it at the time or for some centuries after.\n\nEvangelary\n\nThe Louvre (83) possesses a magnificent gold Boite d'evangeliaire (pl. XIV), which was in the Treasury of St.-Denis in Doublet's time, who thus (p. 346) describes it: 'Un riche livre en parchemin, couvert d'or à petits rameaux d'or à filets torts, avec plusieurs beaux esmaux d'applique, et images d'argent doré bien industrieusement enlevées de demie bosse, entaillees dedans ledit esmail dapplique. Ce livre enrichy de presmes d'esmeraudes, de saphirs, amatistes, grenats, cassidoines, agathes, aulnisses, et quantité de perles d'Escosse et d'Orient.' The centre of the front is occupied by a repoussé group of the Crucifixion surmounted by a round arch. The sides and spandrils of this arch are later restorations and include some of the Palermo enamel buttons, the like of which are on the sardonyx vase. In the corners of the cover are four splendid translucent enamels of the emblems of the Evangelists. The rest of the area is covered with filigree, jewels, and eight pieces of enamel set like jewels but evidently not made for their present positions. This binding is usually described as French, but merely because no one knows where it was made. Other enamels of the same character as those on this book-cover are the following:\n\nA book-cover in the treasury of Milan Cathedral.\n\nA book-cover in the library at Munich (Cim. 57).\n\nThe cross of Velletri.\n\nEnamels on the St. Andrew reliquary at Treves.\n\nThe Soltykoff cross in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nA Portatile at Conques (eleventh century).\n\nAll these works are of late tenth- or early eleventh-century date. It is claimed that the enamels that adorn them were made in Lorraine, in Burgundy, in Italy, in France, as the case may be. The enamels are all similar, and, except for their subjects, resemble Byzantine work. The only possible conclusion seems to be that they were all made by itinerant Byzantine craftsmen, who had come West and were working for Western patrons and carrying out Western designs. There is no indication of the existence at this time of any settled atelier in western Europe where work of this kind was produced. It appears here and there sporadically, and was produced not at one centre but by one group of craftsmen, wherever any of them happened to be employed. (84)\n\nTreasures of Suger\n\nAfter Charles the Bald we have to wait a long time, till well into the twelfth century, before we hear of another royal donor of works of art to the abbey, and then the pair of gold candlesticks presented by Louis VI were so small a matter compared with the immense gifts of the great Suger, who in fact had them made respectable according to his ideas by the addition of jewels to them, that we need not delay over them but can turn at once to the work of the great Abbot-Minister himself. He was elected Abbot of St.-Denis in 1122, and retained that office till his death in 1151, that is to say during the reigns of his masters Louis VI and Louis VII. With his great works as a builder we are not now concerned, nor with his influence on the artists of his day in the matter of the subjects treated by them, an influence recently emphasized by Professor E. M&acurc;le in a valuable article in the Revue de l'Art.(85). What concerns us here is merely the group of works in the precious metals which Suger caused to be made and which he presented to St.-Denis. Fortunately he himself wrote an account of his doings to which we have already more than once referred, so that the authenticity of what comes down from him admits of no question. (86)\n\nHe relates that, when his rebuilding operations were completed, he took in hand the provision of ornaments for the church. He provided the new and splendid shrine for St. Denis in the chevet; he marked the saint's old resting-place by erecting a high cross over the entrance to the crypt; he added gold sides and back to the High altar-frontal of Charles the Bald; he had Louis VI's candelabra set with gems. Then he took the Matutinal altar in hand. He restored its porphyry table set with relics and jewels and equipped it with a cross ciborium, etc. He remade Charles the Bald's seven silver lamps to hang before it, and he likewise remade his seven silver candelabra. He set up the cross of Charlemagne near by. He remade the choir-stalls and restored the pulpitum the eagle lectern, and Dagobert's throne. He filled the windows with stained glass, much of which was soon copied at Chartres and elsewhere. Finally he presented for use in the church a series of magnificent vases to which we must presently refer in detail.\n\nCross of Suger\n\nMuch of the above work has already received our attention, but a word must be said about the great cross which Suger set up over the entrance to the crypt. This has recently been made the subject of careful study by Prof. E. Mâle in the article in the Revue de l'Art (87) to which reference has already been made, and the reader is referred to it for much interesting detail. This cross on its pillar was about seven metres in height. The cross was covered with gold; the crucifix fastened to it was of gold, and the wounds were rubies. The pillar was square and covered on its four sides with enameled copper plates, seventeen enamels on each face, viz. eight pairs of types and antitypes and one larger subject. These enamels and the other parts of the work were made by Godefroy de Claire of Huy in the Lower Lorraine of those days, and his assistants, in all sometimes five sometimes seven in number. It occupied them for two years, and was finished in the year 1147. At the base of the pillar were seated figures in the round of the four Evangelists writing, with their emblems behind them, whilst at the top of it, on the faces of the square capital, were four half- length figures of the elements. We cannot now behold any part of the original work, but there fortunately exists an interesting replica of the base and capital in the form of the foot of a cross now in St. Omer Museum, which probably belonged to the abbey of St.-Bertin (pl.VII, fig. 2). This small reproduction, 30 cm. in height, was itself likewise made in the worksho"
