I\n\nAt the visitor enters the Museum of Antiquities at the\n\nSydney University, which originated in the intelligent\n\npatriotism of Sir Charles Nicholson, the First Chancellor\n\nof that academical institution, he will (if he stops short in\n\nthe doors)) find himself nearly opposite to a quaint\n\nlooking, and rather shabby picture-frame, hanging over\n\nthe fireplace not containing any painting within its deep\n\nrecess, but surmounted by the small, rudely finished, dingy\n\nportrait of a flabby faced man, wearing a ducal cap and\n\nrain On consulting the manuscript catalogue compiled\n\nby the Curator, he will find that this painting purports to\n\nbe (right or wrong) a portrait of John the Fearless, Duke\n\nof Burgundy and that the old, gilt frame, beneath the\n\npicture, is (what, for want of another name, we\n\nmust call) a reliquaire,-containing part of the\n\nremains of Jean bans Pour, the second duke\n\nof the Second Ducal House of Burgundy and of Margaret\n\nof Bavaria Hainault, his devoted wife Having received\n\nthis piece of information with a smile, or a shrug of\n\nincredulity, the visitor (in nineteen cases out of twent)y\n\nprobably passes on unprepared to believe in the assumed\n\nfact which has been stated to him, and not able, perhaps,\n\nfully to realise it if he did It is, as we all know, one of\n\nthe easiest things in the world for a superficial man to be\n\nsarcastic and sceptical, and thus it is that every brainless\n\nfool takes up that n le, as a matter of course flattering\n\nhimself with the idea that he must infallibly be looked upon\n\nas a critical judge of everything, and as a general tar an, in\n\nexact proportion to his conceited incredulity) and complacent\n\nignorance of His mind to him a kingdom is but not in\n\nthe grand and beautiful sense of the Earl of Bristol's famous\n\nsong'. He puts up and sets down in his own narrow,\n\nintellectual domain, with a marvellous Impartiality and\n\nrapidity , but his mind is less like a flourishing kingdom\n\nthan a small, barren, waterless run It is something utterly\n\nworthless, even the most desperate free selector cannot find\n\na single green spot in such an inhospitable waste These\n\nmen believe in nothing, and therefore they learn nothing,\n\nand know nothing, the only sign of mental activity which\n\nthe) manifest is on indecent eagerness to let you understand\n\nthat they cannot possibly be imposed upon State to such\n\npeople an interesting historical fact, and they immediately\n\n(to show their acuteness) surmise that it must be a crafty\n\nlie , shew them an Osinde Inscription on papyrus, and (ton\n\nto one they meet you with the gratuitously insulting suggestion\n\nthat it is\" very probably a forgery, direct their\n\nattention to some rare old Greek coin, and the) disgust you\n\nby rude remarks as to the thousands of them that are\n\nmanufactured at Birmingham If irrefragable proofs of the\n\nauthenticity of any earthly) thing be brought under their no\n\nlike, the) receive them with a listless inattention orangeries\n\nindifference, if \" reasons were as plenty as blackberries \"\n\nthey would obviously be quite ready, Uko Falstaff and his\n\n86' fares, to regard them with supreme contempt\n\nWell, they are wise in their generation they know\n\nnothing importers, and this \" Old World ' sketch is certainly\n\nnot made for them \"Ac jades marom teas, etc' -\n\nwe do not usually feed saying with pearls, It has been found\n\nto it said without offence) to be one of the incontestable ro\n\nvaults of experimental science that pigs greatly prefer to be\n\nnourished with a less cost), more succulent-not to say\n\ngrosser kind of food And so we gradually return to the\n\nreliquary) of the bones of the Duke and Duchess of Jot e\n\nand Bourgogne, and proceed with our memoir.
