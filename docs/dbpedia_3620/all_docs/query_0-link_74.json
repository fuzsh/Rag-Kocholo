        "text": "Pages\n\ndescription Page 1\n\nA New DESCRIPTION OF The most Remarkable things IN THE CITY OF PARIS. (Book 1)\n\nBEfore I enter upon the matter, it may not be amiss to say something of the Original of Paris. If this great City be not one of the Ancient∣est in Europe, yet at least she may boast, that Caesar speaks advantagiously of her in the sixth Book of his Commentaries; where he says, that having subdued divers Nations amongst the Gauls, he was forced to lay Siege to Paris, which at that time was wholly enclosed between the two\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nArms of the Seine, into which place all the In∣habitants of the Neighbouring Country were re∣tired. Here they defended themselves with so much resolution, and made so stout a Resistance that he was constrained to draw together all the Force he could to attack and fight them. It is true he subdued them, but it was not with∣out much Labour, and after several bloody Fights; and in fine, to reduce them entirely to his Obe∣dience and to keep 'em so, he built the Great Châtelet, and placed in it a strong Garrison. Not∣withstanding we read in other Historians, that Ju∣lian the Apostate being retired among the Cauls (where he remain'd a long time in that part of Pa∣ris which is now call'd the Hôtel de Cluny) he built this Fortress, as a Check upon the People of those Parts who were very uneasie and apt to rise: after all we must confess there is no great certainty of these things, by reason of the Ignorance of those Ages that went before us, which have lost or de∣stroy'd those Memorials which should have infor∣med us of the truth, had they been now in being.\n\nAs to the name of this Town; some say it was called Lutetia from King Luous, who was of great esteem among the ancient Gauls; others, from the Latin word Lutum which signisies Dirt and Mud; possibly because its Situation, being between the two Arms of a River, there was con∣tinually plenty of Water and Dirt. And without doubt it is for this reason that the little space of Ground which lies at the further end of the Petit Pont, between the new street of Nostre-Dame, and the Street de la Calande, is at this day still called le Marchè palud. Other Authors say, that the name Paris might well have been derived from the Greek word 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 which signifies Near,\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nand from the Goddess Isis who had formerly a Temple in that place where stands at present the Church of St. Germain des prez; from which place Paris was not far distant. And the Village of Issy near to Vaugerard might perhaps have also taken name from her, that Goddess having had a Temple there, serv'd by certain Priests, for whose maintenance the Lands that lay about that place were appropriated; which Lands belong at present to the Abbey of St. Geneviéve du Mont. In the mean time Isis was not the only Deity that was Worshipp'd about Paris, Cybele had also her Temples there. To maintain which conjecture we may here take notice of the Discovery which was made some years past in the Garden of Mon∣sieur Berrier, in the Street called Coquilliere not far from the Church of St. Eustache. As they were digging there deeper than ordinary to make the foundation of a Wall, they discovered the ruins of an old Tower, with a Bust of Brass, represent∣ing a Womans head something bigger than the Lise, and Crowned with a Castle composed of four Towers, with the ancient sort of Pinacles in such manner as we see 'em in the old Bass reliefs of Rome, or upon Medals representing the God∣dess Cybele who was invoked for the fruitsulness of the Earth, and whom the Poets called Turrita Mater. All Antiquaries who saw this Piece did not in the least question its Antiquity. Among others the Reverend Father du Moulinet one of the Learnedst Men of the Kingdom in these things, has printed a small Tract to prove that this head might have serv'd in some Temple built in this place where this Goddess was adored. And even in the Library of S. Geneviéve they preserve a Model of this Head taken off in Plaister with all the ex∣actness\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nthat could be from the Original, which is at present in the Cabinet of Monsieur the Pro∣cureur-General de Harlay, which illustrious Ma∣gistrate is perfectly acquainted with the true value of such curious things. There are other Etymo∣logies beside these, as that of Paris King of the Gauls, whose dominion extended round about these parts, from whence it comes as some say, that the Inhabitants of the Neigbouring Villages were called Parisii or Parisiaci.\n\nIt would be tedious to speak of the several en∣largements of this Town. It is easily concluded that it was not always of the fame dimensions as it is at present. Under the Reign of Clouis it was as yet shut up within the two Arms of the Seine, that is, that it took up no more ground than the Isle du Palais, which is that part which at pre∣sent we call the City, with some few houses on the Bank of the River next St. Germain l'Aux∣erois; where was at that time a Wood called la Forest des Charbonniers. But however tho it was then but very little, it was considered as a Place of very great importance, since in that par∣tition which the Sons of Clouis made of the King∣dom, they agreed among themselves that Paris should remain neuter and belong to neither of the four; further, that if any of them should enter there without permission of the other three, he should lose all the part which he might other∣wise pretend to.\n\nUnder the second Race, the Town became a little more considerable: they began then to build on both sides of the Seine: all about the Church of St. Geniviéve, which Clouis had raised: at the upper end of the Place-Maubert; where after∣wards Charlemagne did dispose the Learned Men\n\ndescription Page 5\n\nwhich he invited hither out of Greece and Italy; near St. Martins des Champs; and in divers other places in the Fields about the Town.\n\nBut under the third Race it was much more in∣creased. Philip Augustus caused it to be paved throughout, and a certain Financier (or Exche∣quer-Officer) called Girard de Poussy gave to this use out of his own proper Revenue 11000 Marks of Silver, and this he did freely without any constraint from the King, in whose Service he had doubtless attained this great Sum. This was an Example of Generosity altogether extra∣ordinary; and was done in the year 1185. as Monsieur de Mezeray tells us in his History of France. This King also caused the several Quar∣ters to be enclosed with Walls. Those of the Uni∣versity extended from the edge of the Seine be∣ginning at the Gate of St. Bernard, or the Gate of the Tournelle, and so up behind St. Geniviéve to the Gate of St. James, and then down again to∣wards the River to the place where stands at pre∣sent the Colledge of the four Nations, and where heretofore was the Gate of Nesle taken down not long since to enlarge the Place. On the North side of the River it was also enclosed with Walls which had almost the same extent. There was in former times a Gate near the place where now stands the Quinze-Vingts, which answered to an∣other called the Porte-neuve, (or New-gate) on the Bank of the River pulled down some years ago, near which was a very high Tower: another Gate in the Street Coquilliere, at the end of the Street Grenelle: another in the Street of St. Denis, near the Fountain de la Reine, which was called the Painters Gate: another in the Street of S. Mar∣tin, at the end of the Street aux Ours: and an∣other\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nnear S. Johns Church-yard which was called the Porte Bodais, because it led to the Château or Castle of that name, which stood in that place where now is the Village of St. Maur des Fossez beyond Charenton. Since those times this great City is much augmented, and continually extend∣ed into the Fields, till not long since for several weighty Considerations, there have been certain Bounds prescribed, beyond which it is not lawful to raise any buildings. It is to be observed that Paris being thus bounded, its extent is the more considerable, in regard there is not to be found in it any place that is not extreme full of People, and as thick of Houses as can be contrived, in some of which there are continually several di∣stinct Families in one house, which is rarely to be seen in other Towns, where every one desires to dwell apart, and where there are few houses to be found of seven Stories high, as they are all about the Palais; near the great Chatelet; and round the place called la Halle; in which Houses the least Rooms are full of Inhabitants and let out at dear Rates.\n\nThis is all that we shall say of Paris in Gene∣ral▪ Let us now come to particulars.\n\nThe LOƲVRE.\n\nHistorians say that this Palace was first found∣ed by Philip Augustus in the year 1214. Who made the great Tower, in which Ferrand Earl of Flanders was kept Prisoner after that King had won the famous Battel of Bouvines; in which the Earl who had Revolted from King Philip was made a Captive. This Tower was standing in\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nthe last Age, and had served not only to keep the Kings Treasure, but also had been built to receive therein the Homage and Oath of Fidelity of those who held Lands of the Crown; or rather, as one may presume, it was the Seige Seigneurial (or Head of a Tenure) upon which several Fiefs did depend. For it is well known that our Ancestors had a custom always to build in their Châteaux (or Chief Seats) a great Tower, and to raise up∣on that another lesser, which they called the Don∣••on, this they esteemed the Mark of a Seigneurie; and without doubt this Tower at the Louvre was of the same nature. It was taken down when Francis the First began that building which at present is called the old Louvre. But Death hin∣dred that Prince from performing much of what he intended. Henry the Second his Son, carried on the building after the designs of his Father, and for the performance he made use of the Ab∣bot of Clugny, and John Gougeon, both Parisi∣ans and the ablest Architects of their Time, since those few things which we see of theirs pass for the most regular and finest Architecture of the World. They were preferred to the illustrious Sebastian Sorlio, who was expresly sent for from Italy, but had the displeasure to see his designs not followed. In the Hall of the hundred Swisses we see a kind of Tribune of the Workmanship of this John Gougeon, it is supported by four Caria∣tides, of a Design so regular and so well contri∣ved that M. Perrault of the Royal Academy of Sciences hath caused it to be engraved and inserted in the Translation of the Works of Vitruvius, where he hath proposed it as a compleat Model. The following Inscription Henry II. set over one of the Gates.\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nHENRICUS II. CHRISTIANISS. VETUSTATE COLLAPSUM REFICI COEP. A. PAT. FRANCISCO I. R. CHRISTIANIS. MOR∣TUI SANCTISS. PARENT. MEMOR. PIEN∣TISS. FILIUS ABSOLVIT AN. A SAL. CHRISTI. MDXXXXVIII.\n\nThis being ruined by Age, and begun to be repaired by Francis I. the most Christian King: Henry II. The most Christian King, as a pious Son who was mindful of the de∣sign of his dead Father, caused to be fini∣shed, in the year from the Redemption of the World, MDXXXXVIII.\n\nLewis the 13th. whose Designs were always Great and Magnificent, caused to be built the Great Pavilion which is over the Entrance. The Sieur Mercier had the charge of that work, in which he followed the first design and form. But being forced to raise his Work higher than the Bo∣dy of the Building, upon the Corinthian and Composite orders, he added a Cariatide Order in imitation of that in the Hall of the 100: Swisses aforementioned, upon which he placed a double Fronton. The old Gate of the Louvre is under this Pavillion, the Roof of which is supported by two Ranks of Ionick Pillars of one piece, pla∣ced two and two, and are extreme remarkable for their bigness. The Court in the middle of this building is great and exactly square. The King hath raised three Wings which are not yet finished. The Work consists of three Ranks of Pillars, Corinthian and Composite; the top is in the manner of a Terrasse, which appears of a Beauty most magnificently surprising. The great\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nGate is on that side next to St. Germain l'Auxer∣rois placed in the middle of a long Façade (or Front of Building) adorn'd with Corinthian Pil∣lars two and two of a most beautiful greatness, which standing off from the rest of the Work make a great Portico on each side of the Gate, on which stands the Fronton composed only of two Stones, of one piece, each of which is fifty foot in length; a great Terrasse runs on the top of this Façade, from which one may discover all Paris. In the old Louvre, many things are to be seen.\n\nThe Cabinet of Pictures.\n\nThe place where the Kings Pictures are kept, is in an Apartment near the end of the great Gal∣lery. It is difficult to find more in number or more rare pieces in any part of Europe than are in this place. Here are some of all the most fa∣mous Masters of Italy and Flanders and other parts; all which the King hath caused to be gra∣ved, of which there are two great Volumes ex∣tant; but of late years they have removed a great part of these Paintings to Versailles to adorn that magnisick Palace. Yet there still remain several of diverse Masters, among others the last Supper of Paul Veronnese, a Picture of an extraordina∣ry greatness, so are the Battels of Monsieur l' Brun, from which they have made several Pieces of cu∣rious Tapestry. The Paintings of Pousin are here preserved with care, as are also those of several other French Masters, of which he is the Chief without dispute.\n\ndescription Page 10\n\nThey are continually working in Sculpture in two several places of the Louvre. M. Girardon hath his Work-house under the Cabinet of Pi∣ctures where you may see some Statues which he hath finished for Versailles, those that are in the Grotto there, were made in this place; here you may see the Model of Cardinal Richelieu's Tomb, which is to be erected in the Church of the Sor∣bonne.\n\nAt the end of the Court that lies before the Gate under the Pavillion on that side next the Ruë Saint Honorè, you ought to view the Sta∣tues which are to be placed on the Tomb of Monsieur de Turenne which the King hath caused to be erected for him at St. Denys. You may also there observe several other curious pieces, which are all of the design and invention of Mon∣sieur de Mercy one of the best Statuaries of the Kingdom. He is at present about certain figures intended for the Tomb of Monsieur the Duke of Noailles at St. Pauls. The Sieur Renaudin hath also his Work-house near that of M. Girardon, which ought to be seen by the Curious.\n\nBut above all we ought not to neglect before we leave the Louvre to visit the Hall, wherein the Gentlemen of the French Academy assemble, whom the King honours with so particular a Pro∣tection, that he is willing to have them in his own Palace. This Illustrious Academy is com∣posed of learned Persons who take continual pains in perfecting the French Tongue, and meet three times a Week.

The same day all the Members of the Academy procure a Mass to be sung in Musick, after which a Panegyrick of St. Lewis is pronounced by some able Preacher. Monsieur the Abbot Pelisson has composed the History of the French Academy, and writ it af∣ter such a polite and delightsom manner, that his Book passes for one of the finest and best things in the French Language. They have some Pi∣ctures in their Hall; one of the Holy Virgin; another of the King in his ••oronation habit; the Picture of Cardinal Richelieu Founder of the\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nFrench Academy, that of the Chancellor Seguier who after the death of the Cardinal became its Protector, and in fine, another of Queen Chri∣stina of Swedeland, who came to these Assem∣blies, where she shewed her extraordinary Genius for all curious things.\n\nWe cross over here and pass into a Hall where we may see two Models made for the great Stair∣case of the Louvre, the fairest of which was made by the famous Mansard, the other by M. du Veau, he who made the designs for the New Buildings at Vin••ennes, but the first of these excells the other infinitely for the Grandeur of the gust and hardiness of design.\n\nIn the old Tenis-Conrt, in the middle of the Court they are at work about the Model of a Sta∣tue of the King on Horseback, raised on the top of a Rock with his Enemies subdued at his feet, and four Rivers with their Urns who seem ama∣zed to see this great Monarch arrived to the highest step of Glory. Nothing can be greater than this Work; and if it be performed according to the de∣sign, all Europe cannot shew a more magnisick Monument. It is of M. Girardons designing.\n\nThe Gard-Meuble or Repository of the Kings Moveables.\n\nOn the Bank of the River at the Corner of the Street des Poulies is the Garde-Meuble in an Old house which was formerly called the Hôrel du pe∣tit Bourbon, in regard the Princes of that Family dwelt there. The outside has no fine shew, but\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nit is within this place that they preserve the preci∣ous moveables of the Crown; here one may see a Surprizing quantiy of Tapestry both anci∣ent and Modern, here are some pieces which Francis I. caused to be made after the Designs of Julio Romano, and which were wrought at Anuers by a famous Master of that time who had an extraordinary Reputation. These pieces re∣present the Acts of the Apostles, and the History of Scipio the Great. This King hath caused a∣bundance to be made at the Gobelins, enriched with Gold and Silver, after the designs of M. le Brun, of which he hath no less than 24000 Ells; not reckoning a great Footcloath in the manner of Turky-work, which is working in a place built on purpose at the end of the Cours d•• la Reine, commonly called the Savonnerie, which is to be the full length of the great Gallery of the Louvre, but is not yet finisht. Together with these you may see abundance of Vessels of Precious Stones, as Agat, Onix, Jacinth, Cornelian, Christal of the Rock, admirable as well for their Size as Workmanship, several Branches of Coral, but one among the rest very great, and black as Ebo∣ny, which is extremely rare: Small Cabinets of Chrystal of the Rock, and of Amber garnished with Gold and Jewels. But that which is most observable is a great Ship of Gold inriched with Diamonds, of most curious Workmanship, made by the Sieur Balin, and valued at one hun∣dred thousand Crowns. After this you may see the Vessels of Massie Silver consisting of divers Basons, upon which the History of this King is cut in Chis••l-work, they are of such weight, that it requires the strength of two men to bear 'em upon a kind of Handbarrows made of the same\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nmetal and workmanship. Here are also Tables, Stands, Looking-glass Frames, Branches for Can∣dles, extraordinary great, Orangers, two great Tubs of Silver which served at the Baptism of Monseigneur the Dauphin, Branches to set upon Stands, Chenets, Cassolets or perfuming-pots, and generally all Sorts of Goldsmiths work for their weight as well as workmanship to be admi∣red; most of which things were wrought by the famous Monsieur Balin, of whom I have alrea∣dy made some mention. He was the chief Artist of this Age for Silver Work, and died about five or six years since. They shew here also Embroi∣dered Beds, extreme Rich, with Hangings for Alcoues of the same fashion. You may see in the same place the Cup-board of Francis I. of certain pieces of Silver gilt, very well wrought. In another Room, apart, they preserve a great quantity of curious Arms of all sorts, among others the Armour of Francis I. which he wore at the Battel of Pavie, where one may discern on the cuirasse the Blows which he received before he would yield himself a Prisoner to the Spani∣ards, to whom he dearly sold his Liberty. There is also a Fusil or small Gun which the City of Paris presented to Monseigneur the Dauphin, and which is here preserved because it was the first Fire-Arms he ever shot in. In fine, the Curious, and all others, may here find rarities enough to satisfie their eye, for beside the singular Beauty of the Work, one may here see a mighty quantity of Gold and Silver, which is a very great entertainment to such who are apt to be dazled with the Splen∣dor of the metal and consider that, more than the excellency of the Work. Of late the King hath caused the finest things in the Garde-Meuble\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nto be removed to Versailles, yet still there remains a great number that are well worth see∣ing.\n\nThe Palace of the Tuilleries.\n\nHaving seen these things you ought to go next to the Palace of the Tuilleries, which extends it self along the Garden in one continued Line; it is composed at the ends of two great square Pa∣vilions adorned with Pilasters of the Composite Order, and of one great Pavilion, like a Dome, in the middle, under which is the great Hall and Stair-case that leads to the Apartments. It is to be observed that the middle of this Building, namely the great Pavilion, the two Terrasses, and the two lesser Pavilions at the Ends, were built at the char∣ges of Katharine de Medicis, who was very skil∣ful in Architecture, as we perceive by these Buil∣dings, which are all of a most curious proportion after the Ionick and Corinthian Orders, there are three Ranks of Pillars, with an Attick over head. For this work she employed Philibert de Lorme and John Bulan, the prime Masters of their Age. The rest of the Buildings were performed by Henry IV. and Lewis XIV. who in our days hath repaired this Palace as we now see it. There stood once under the Pavilion in the middle, a great Stair-case, which was one of the finest things of its kind in the whole World, for its disposition, and for the strange boldness of the Work. Which Stair∣case was built after the designs of the foremen∣tioned Pilibert de Lorme, but of late, to the great regret of the Curious, it has been taken\n\ndescription Page 17\n\ndown for the meliorating the Prospect of the Tu∣illeries to the Court, and for employing the Great Hall to the enlargement of the Kings Apartment. Which Apartment, as also that of the Queen, and that of Monseigneur the Dauphin are enrich'd with excellent Paintings of the ablest Masters of France. In a Gallery which reaches the whole length of the Kings Apartment on the Court-side, you may see several Cabinets enrich'd with Migna∣tures and Chissel-work extremely fine, with seve∣ral Tables of inlaid Stone-work very beautiful, among others one very large, upon which is the representation of a Salamander, which was the device of Francis I. and therefore this is suppo∣sed to have been his Table. Here are also some of Sicilian Marble of one Piece, of a wonderful variety of Colours. This Gallery hath often ser∣ved for the Reception and Audience of Ambassa∣dors, and at such times it hath been adorn'd with Rich Tapistry and other precious moveables.\n\nIn the Rooms below are preserved abundance of antient Statues, and the Bust of this King made by the Cavalier Bernin when he came from Rome to draw the Designs of the Louvre. One may see there also the Plans raised of all the strongest places of Europe, which have been drawn out with all care and exactness that is possible.\n\nThe other moity of the Building on that side next the Rüe St. Honorè contains the Chappel, which is not yet finished; and the Theater, other∣wise called la Salle des Machines: in which the Court was formerly entertain'd with Comedies, of which Psyche was the last, which after it had been Acted for many years▪ did still draw a world of admirers. But since the invention of Opera's came to us from Italy, serious Playes though\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nmingled with musick and Entries of Ballets have given place to Song and continued Musick on whatsoever Subject it be. This Theatre, with∣out contradiction, is the most magnifick of Eu∣rope, not excepting that of the Duke of Parma so much boasted of. One cannot desire any thing to be better contrived. Every Person may see and hear extreme conveniently. The Room be∣hind the Stage for the Machines is very large. As for the Decorations no Costs have been wanting, all the House is painted in Marble Colours. The Galleries are supported with Pillars whose Capi∣tals and Pedistals are gilded, as is also the Ceil∣ing which is curiously Carved.\n\nThe Prospect of all this Palace is into the Garden of the Tuilleries, to which Garden this Palace also serves as a most Magnifick Perspective, every one of its Allies being answered with a face of the Building of most beautiful Archite∣cture. This Garden is at present one of the most regular of Europe, though it be not as yet adorned with Statues, as in time it will be. There is in it an open Theatre; with all the necessary parts thereunto belonging, as the Ancients contrived them, and which we see in those of Rome: Trees are planted here which serve in the like manner with the Ordinary Deco∣rations in other Theatres. It is extreme great and may contain a great number of People. On the other side of the great Ally stands the Statue of Truth, raised upon a great Pedestal. It is the Work of a famous Sculptor called Ville Franche, who came from Cambray. Monsieur le Nostre continued the Works in the Tuilleries, and it is he also who manages those admirable Garden-Works at Versailles. You must by no means\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nneglect to see his Cabinet which is very well fur∣nished with Pictures, and Busts of Marble, most of which came out of Italy; among others one may easily observe a Picture of indifferent size, done by Dominicain, representing Adam and Eve in the Terrestrial Paradise, this is esteemed one of the finest Pieces in all Paris.\n\nWe ought to observe that the old Louvre is joyned to the Palace of the Tuilleries by the great Gallery which extends it self all along the River; at the end which was begun first there are several Paintings and other Ornaments of the design of Monsieur Poussin, but they being found too small for the Place where they stand, the Work ne∣ver proceeded further but remained imperfect as it is, the beginning of this Gallery is the work of Philibert de Lorme, and the rest of Mete∣zeau, he who undertook that great service at the Ditch of Rochelle, which was the chief occasion of the taking that Rebel Town. Upon this sub∣ject the following Epigram was made in his ho∣nour,\n\nHaeretico palmam retulit Methezaeus ab hoste, Cum rupellanas aggere cinxit aquas. Dicitur Archimedes terram potuisse movere, Aequora qui potuit sistere, non minor est.\n\nO're Rochell Metezeau Triumphant stood. Curbing with a a bold Dike the Rebel Flood. In Fame scarce Archimedes equal is, As he could move the Earth, this fix'd the Seas.\n\nThe Salle des Antiques, or repository of Anti∣quities, is under the end of this Gallery, it is in∣crusted with Marble, and full of Ancient Statues,\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nthe best and scarcest that can be seen. The King has caused 'em all to be engraved by Melan. And there are two great Volumes of them extant in Folio, besides those other Pictures of which we have already spoken.\n\nThe Apartments under this Gallery are all in∣habited by divers famous Artists who are imploy'd in the Kings Service, and to whom he has assign'd these Lodgings.\n\nThe Royal Printing-house is also here, of which the Sieur Mabre-Cramoisy, is the Governor or Di∣rector: where you may see a small Room filled only with such Books as have been printed here.\n\nMonsieur Silvestre a famous Graver, Monsieur Melan of whose hand the publick has several ex∣traordinary fine Gravings, M Coepel a Painter; M. Herard, M. Valdor, are lodged here. M. Cas∣siny hath also his Chamber here thô his ordinary dwelling is at the Observatory, so hath Monsieur the Abbot Siry so well known for those curious Italian Memoires which he hath published upon History, Madamoselle Stella in whose apartment are several curious Pictures of Poussin; Monsieur Bain, a famous Enamellor, who has found out the secret to make Enamel as bright and beauti∣ful as precious stones, and who hath now under his hands, for the King, a great Bason of Gold adorned with Mouldings on the Edges, this will be without all dispute a most exquisite piece when it is finished, as well for the Workmanship as for the materials, for it amounts to an hundred thou∣sand Franks, he makes commonly Enamell'd Watch-Cases, and divers things of that sort. Near him is M. Boul who makes a sort of Mosaick works extreamly neat, and which the Curious preserve ve∣ry\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nchoicely; Messieurs Sanson, Sons of the fa∣mous Geographer have also Lodgings in this place; they are continually imployed, and from time to time publish some new thing in Geography.\n\nThe Kings Balaneier (or Mony-Stamp) is also kept in these parts. Here it is where they make those Curious Medals both Stamped and Cast, in Gold, Silver, and Copper. M. the Abbot Bizot, one of the most intelligent and able persons of all the Curious in Paris, had the direction formerly of these matters, after the famous Varin. One can∣not desire to see any thing more choice than his Cabinet, which is compleatly furnished with Pi∣ctures, Medals, ancient and modern, Agats, Fi∣gures in Brass, Porcelains, and a thousand other rarities of such sort.\n\nThe Petite Ecurie, or lesser Stable, takes up the rest of the Buildings, which is very long, and full of excellent Horses.\n\nSt. Germain l'Auxerrois.\n\nSomething may be said here of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, the Parish Church of the Louvre. It is one of the ancientest of Paris, for Childe∣bert was the Founder as well of this as that of St. Germain des Prez, both which he dedicated to St. Vincent, he having deposited in these Churches some Reliques of that Saint Which he brought out of Spain. They have here on great Feasts, very magnificent Ornaments given by the Queen Mother; which are of Cloath of Gold and Silver very rich: These the Republick of ••e∣noa presented to that illustrious Queen and were\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nby her immediately bestowed upon this Church. The other things most remarkable in this Church are, the Tribune (or Gallery) of Germain Pi∣lon's designing, who was esteemed in his Age the ablest Workman in all France for Sculpture and Architecture, and the Chappel of Monsieur the Marquess de Rosteing, in which are some Busts in Marble of several illustrious Persons of that Fa∣mily. In the Room where the Churchwardens Assemble hangs a very good copy of a Last Supper, by Leonard de Vincy, whch Picture was former∣ly placed in the Church and its Beauty never ob∣served, till it was known that the Cavalier Ber∣nin had admired it. Upon which it was quick∣ly removed and placed in this Room, for the more choice keeping. The most considerable Persons who have been interred in this Church are Monsieur Seguin, who was Dean here, very ju∣dicious in the value of Medals: Joachim du Bel∣lay, one of the famousest Poets of his Age: Monsieur Varin, one of the ablest Gravers of Medals that France ever had; Monsieur Balin, a famous Goldsmith, of whom we have already spoken, this was he who invented those Curious Ornaments where the History of the Old and New Testament are represented in Cartouches of admirable Workmanship. Here is also the Tomb of Madamoiselle Silvestre represented in Painting on a Black Marble fixed to a Pillar behind the Quire, after Monsieur le Bruns way. In the lesser Chappels are to be seen several well esteem∣ed Pictures of le Sueur's Work.\n\nThere is a Landskip in Perspective done by Francisque, worth seeing, in one of the Houses in the Cloister.\n\nIn that great space of Ground which is between\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nthe old Louvre and the Palace of the Tuilleries, are many fair Houses, among others\n\nThe Hôtel de Crequi, in which lives the Illu∣strious Maréchal of that name. Its outside makes no great shew, but within it is very well funished: above all the Stair-case extremely well design'd. In the Street of St. Thomas du Louvre is\n\nThe Hôtel de Longueville formerly called the Hôtel de Epernon, which wants a whole wing of Building. So much as is finished is of a very beau∣tiful design, chiefly the Portal, of the Ionick Or∣der, as is all the rest of the House, which wants a Square or place before it, to give the more advan∣tagious view. The Apartments are convenient, and the Garden pleasant tho it be inclosed on eve∣ry side. You must not forget to see a Ceiling in one of the Chambers, painted by M. Mignard, high∣ly esteemed.\n\nIn the Turn-again-Lane near this place stands the House of M. de Guitry, which is very handsom.\n\nIn the same Street of St. Thomas is also the Hôtel de Montausier, formerly called the Hôtel de Ramboüillet, heretofore the most delightsom Seat of the Muses, and which still serves at this day as a Retreat and Sanctuary to all ingenious Persons by the favourable protection they find from the Duke of Montausier formerly Governor to Monsiegneur the Dauphin.\n\nHaving thus satisfied ones curiosity on the Sub∣ject of the Louvre, in which many particulars may be observed which are not here mentioned to avoid prolixity, let us begin our next Journey at the nearest place which is\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nThe Quarter of St. Honorè.\n\nThis Quarter begins at the Rüe de St. Denis, where we may see, in the first place, a handsom row of Houses, built uniform with the same Sy∣metry, at the Charges of the Canons of St. Ger∣main l'Auxerrois, who raise out of 'em a con∣siderable Revenue. This place hath been en∣larged upon the Church-yard of the holy Inno∣cents, which lies behind. The Charnel-houses which are built round that Church-yard, were built, as reported, out of the Confiscate Goods of the Jews when they were expelled Paris under the Reign of Philip Augustus. In probability there is not any one place in the whole World in which more dead bodies are interred; which caused the Spanish Ambassador who resided in Paris during the League, to advise the Citizens at such time when the Famine pressed them cruelly, to grind the Bones of the dead in this Church-yard to make Bread; but this Counsel was not followed com∣ing from a drolling Spaniard: M. de Mezeray, so well known of the Learned for his delicate Histo∣ry of France, is here Interred. You may see in this Place a Pyramid adorn'd with Bass-releifs, much esteemed, on the top of which is erected a Cross, this was set up in the last Age during the horrible Confusions of the League. There is in the same place a Skeleton of the Workman∣ship of Permain Philon. Further on, is\n\nThe Cross du Tiroüer where, as it is said, Queen Grunehault was, by the Command of Clotaire, drawn at the Tail of a Wild horse.\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nBut this is not well proved: and it is much dispu∣ted among the Historians, whether this Queen was the most illustrious, or the most wicked of her Age. For there are as many that speak well of her, as ill. St. Gregory the Great, Pope; Gre∣gory of Tours, Fortunatus Bishop of Poictiers, Paulus Aemilius, du Tillet, the Bishop of Meaux, and Pasquier in his Enquiries of France, are all full of her Encomiums. Those who condemn her are Aimoin, Gaguin, Minister-general of the Mathurins, Belle-Forest, du Hail∣lant, and Vigner, whose Authorities are of great force in History. So that it will be difficult to affirm any thing positively of this great Princess, who has been more spoken of than ever any Queen of France hath been. Something lower are\n\nThe Fathers of the Oratory, whose house stands in the same place where formerly was the Hôtel de Bouchages. Tho their Church is not yet quite finished, it is however already extreme handsom, and of a design very Regular. They have here on their great Altar a Tabernacle of a magnifick sort of Architecture, the Pillars are of an admirable Sicilian Marble. It is a Dome raised very high with four Porticoes, supported with six Pillars of the composite order which stand out from the Work; the Ornaments of which are perfectly well wrought, and the Proportions ex∣act. A great Fabrick after this Model might well please the most difficult Persons in matters of Architecture. The Cardinal de Berulle is Inter∣red in one of the Cha pels, where his Tomb may be seen, and on it his representation in white Marble. He was their Founder, as all men know. These Fathers have a very handsom Library. The\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nplace in Truth is a little too dark; but that does not impair its value, in regard it contains a great number of excellent Volumes both Printed and Manuscript, among which are a good number of Greeks and Arabians, given them by Monsieur de Sancy, Ambassador of France to the Porte. Who during the time of his Embassie made an exact search and collection of such Greek Rarities which had scaped the Barbarity of the Turks Such a Library this could never be better disposed of than into the custody of these Fathers, there being among them some Persons of most profound Learning, as appears by their Works, so much sought after and bought up by all Scho∣lars. One might mention here Father Cointe, and Father Senault, both which have left the World such excellent Writings, the one in Histo∣ry, the other in Moral Philosophy; Father Mal∣branche who composed the Enquiry of Truth; Father Thomassin who wrote the Discipline of the Church in three Volumes in Folio; Father Dubois, who by order of Monseigneur the Arch-Bishop, is now about the Ecclesiastical History of Paris. This Congregation hath also furnished us with the ablest Preachers, as Monsieur the Bishop of Agen, so famous by the name of Father Mas∣caron, the Course of whose Sermons were most emphatical; Father le Boust, and Father Hubert who Preach'd a Lent at Nostre-Dame to a mar∣vellous concourse of People, and the last year at Court; not to mention Father Morin, and di∣vers other famous Preachers who lived not long since.\n\nAs you leave the Fathers of the Oratory, and pass on along the Rüe St. Honorè, you ought to visit\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nThe Palais Cardinal, which the People now call the Palais-Royal, because the King was here Educated when young. The Hôtel de Sillery stood formerly in the little Court which is before the Gate, which Cardinal Richlieu caused to be pulled down to give the better sight to the Palace, he had then caused to be built here after the des∣signs of the Sieur Mercier, who had been esteem∣ed a very able Architect, had he raised his Build∣ings something higher; and that is the only fault of this Palace, extremely convenient in all things else. It is composed of two square Courts, of which the first and least is compassed about with Battlements, and the second is divided from the Garden by a row of Arches which support an open Gallery which reaches from one Wing to the other, through these Arches, which are in∣closed with Iron Grates you have a Prospect into the Garden, which was form'd as it is by Mon∣sieur le Nostre after the same Model with the Tuilleries. As for the Apartments they are all most beautiful and convenient, and all the Court resided here a long time during the Regency. A∣bove all, we ought to see the Gallery where Car∣dinal Richlieu caused to be painted all the famous men of France, From the time of Suger Abbot of St. Dennis, down to the time of his Ministry: That is in effect the whole French History from Lewis the young, to the Reign of Lewis XIII. Monsieur the Duke of Orleans dwells here at present, thô the House belongs to the King, to whom Cardinal Richlieu bequeathed it in his Will, together with five hundred thousand Crowns and that Curious Suit of Tapistry which is exposed on the great Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\ndescription Page 28\n\nYou must not forget to see the Cabinet of Monsieur the Chevalier de Loraine, where are curious Pictures of the best Masters, it is near the Garden which adds not a little to its beauty.\n\nIn a Hall belonging to this Palace is the Thea∣tre where they represent the Opera of famous M. de Lully, which draws to it continually a mighty concourse of People lovers of Musick. No part of Europe yields more pleasing Objects, be it for the Dances, or for the Symphonie, or in fine, for the singularity of the Habits; but that which is most considerable, is the wonder∣ful agreement of the French Musick with the Italian, which was once thought a thing impossi∣ble, and yet even in this M. de Lully hath been mighty successful. Nor has the Age been un∣grateful to his extraordinary Parts, for he draws a very great Revenue from the Representations of these Pieces. The Verse is ordinarily composed by Monsieur Quinault of the French Academy: Monsieur Corneille the younger hath also made some things, and Bel••rophon is of his writing. From hence you go to\n\nThe Hospital of the Quinze-Vingts, which St. Lewis caused to be built in his time for 300 blind Gentlemen whom he brought with him out of the Holy Land where they had lost their Eyes in fighting against the Sarazens. Over the Gate o•• this Ho••pital there stands a Statue of that Holy King which (thò of ill Workmanship) resembles him very much, as the Antiquaries pretend.\n\nFurther in the same Street is St. Roch the Parish Church for all this Quarter, in which there is a very exquisite Crucifix wrought by Monsieur An∣guerre.\n\ndescription Page 29\n\nA little higher stands the Convent of the Jaco∣bins, wherein is nothing very remarkable, unless it be the Library, which is one of the finest in Paris.\n\nAfter this you may take notice of the Portal before the House of Monsieur Pussort Counsellor of State, it is lately built, of the Ionick Order, with an Attick over head, in which are the Arms of the Owner. This is a small piece of Archi∣tecture, very well esteemed. The inside of the Fabrick is handsom, especially on that side next the Garden, which is very curious and pleasant. Near this on the same side is\n\nThe Convent of Feüillans, Henry III. first brought them out of Languedo••, in number sixty, with the blessed John de la Barr••ere, Author of the Reform of St. Bernards Order. At first they were lodged at the Bo••s de Vin••••nnes, till this house which was building for 'em should be finished. The great Gate which fronts upon the Rüe Saint Honorè, is but newly built; it is com∣posed of four Corinthian Pillars, that support a Fronton on which are the Arms of France. The first Court which serves as a Paruis (or open Place) before the Church, is very well; and the Building over the Gate where you enter is not ill contrived. The Portal of the Church is one of the most Regular of all Paris, and it was the first Essay of Monsieur de Mansard. Here are two Orders of Pillars, Ionick and Corinthian, fluted and set off with Ornaments. Within the Church are some Chappels handsom enough, among others that of Monsieur the Marquess of Rostaing, adorn'd almost like that at St. Ger∣main l'Auxerrois, with Pillars and Busts of Marble. On one side of the great Altar you may\n\ndescription Page 30\n\nsee a Tomb after the ancient manner. It is of white Marble, with a great Urn of the same, cu∣riously wrought; tho it has no Epitaph, yet we may conclude from the Arms in the fore part of it, that it belongs to the Illustrious House of Rohan. The Quire behind the great Altar, where the Religious Sing, is adorned with Pi∣ctures representing the Principal Actions of our Saviours Life.\n\nThese Fathers have very Magnisick Ornaments which with all their Plate also were given by se∣veral Persons of Quality. They have a Library, not very numerous, but however there are in it very curious Pieces. In their Cloister you will find divers Paintings representing the Life of St. Bernard their Founder. Among these Reli∣gious there are some famous Preachers. As the Reverend Father Dom. Cosme, at present Bishop of Lombez, the Reverend Father Hieresme, and some others. As you go from hence you pass before the Capuchins, where there is nothing re∣markable, and so on to\n\nThe Nuns of the Assumption. These Nuns had their abode formerly in the Street called Ruë de la mortellerie, where they were Hospital-Sisters under the name of Haudriettes, their House in that place having been founded by one Stephen Haudry Esquire to the King St. Lewis, to Har∣bor, and they to serve the poor and sick, as Histo∣rians tell us. But being too much straitned for Room in that street they removed to this place, where they changed their name as well as Situa∣tion. Of late years they have raised here several Noble buildings, especially their Church, which is a Dome or Cupulo after the Roman manner, very high; the inside of which is adorned with\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nCorinthian Palasters supporting a Cornish, over which is a Row of Windows, between which hang certain pictures representing the Life of the Holy Virgin, well painted. But the Plafon (or Painting within the Ceiling) of the Dome is that which is most remarkable, it was done by M. de la Fosse, and represents the Assumption, with the Angels carrying and following the Blessed Virgin into Heaven, all which is both for the boldness of the painting, and the design, the finest that can be, and one of the most finish'd things of Paris. The Nuns Quire is very handsom, but is difficult to see, by reason of the great Grate that divides it from the Church, which Grate is no ill imitation of that at Val-de-Grace. As you go out you ought to take notice of the Portico supported by eight Corinthian Pillars, with a Fronton and a Cornish, the Carving Work of which is not yet finished.\n\nAll this Building was designed by M. Herard, director of the Academy of Painters which the King maintains at Rome.\n\nHaving seen these things you need to proceed no further this way, there being nothing consi∣derable in the Fauxburgh of St. Honorè, unless it be the Workhouse of Monsieur Anguerre, where you may see some works in Sculpture; and a young Garden or Nursery which in Spring time has very curious Flowers. This last belongs to the King, who caused it to be made here, from hence to furnish the Tuilleries with such Flowers as are needful to set of the Parterres, there is al∣so in this place a great number of Orange-Trees, well kept and preserved.\n\nOver against the Nunnery of the Assumption is the Hôtel de Luxembourg, belonging to Mon∣sieur\n\ndescription Page 32\n\nthe Marechal of Luxemburg, who inhabits here. The Garden is extreme pleasant.\n\nNext to this are the Capuchin Nuns, founded by Henry IV. in pursuance of the pious intenti∣on of Loüise de Loraine, Widow of Henry III. They live very austerely. On one side of their Gate, a Fountain has been erected on which are these two Verses of Monsieur de Santeüil.\n\nTot Loca Sacra inter pura est quae labitur Ʋnda, Hanc non impuro, quisquis es, ore bibas.\n\nThrough Sacred Cells has this pure Wa∣ter pass'd, With lips as pure do thou this Water tast.\n\nThe Hôtel of Vendôme is near this, and takes up a long Space in the Street. It was built by the Duke of Vendôme natural Son of Henry IV. who always lived here. The inside is very beau∣tiful. The Front of the great Stair-case which is of the dessigne of M. Mansard, is adorn'd with many Pillars which as you come in make a deli∣cate shew. The Garden is great but neglected as is all the rest of the House. The Duke of Ven∣dôme Governor of Provence, and Grandson of him above-mentioned lives at present in the Temple, with Monsieur the Grand Prior of France, his Brother.\n\nHaving thus run through the Street of St. Ho∣norè, let us now enter upon the next Quarter which is called la Butte St. Roch.\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nThe Quarter de la Butte St. Roch.\n\nTo view this Quarter in Order, you should begin at the Ruë de Richelieu, where as soon as you enter, you have on the right hand\n\nThe Palais Brion.\n\nPeople give it that name because the Duke of Amville Earl of Brion, for some time made his abode here. This Building is part of the Palais Royal, and was begun by the Cardinal of Riche∣lieu, who designed it for his Library. But some years since the King hath given it to two Acade∣mies, that of Painting, and that of Architecture. The first of these was established by M. des Noyers, under the direction of M. de Chambray Brother of M. de Chant-Loup, from whose pen we have several excellent pieces in print, among others, The Parallel of the Ancient and Modern Archi∣tecture, Palladio translated into French, &c. This Academy was re established by Monsieur the Chancelier Seguier, after whose death that beautiful Catafalque at the Fathers of the O∣ratory, was erected to his Memory as to their Protector. Monsieur Colbert succeeded him in this Charge and in the affection he bore them. Every day here is exposed a naked man, which is the Model by which the young Scholars design, in order to attain from Nature her self the great\n\ndescription Page 34\n\nArt of Painting, an Art that requires a most assi∣duous Study. The great Hall where they meet is full of abundance of Pictures done by the most able Masters in the Academy, and of all those pie∣ces that have been won for Prizes, which are here distributed to raise emulation among the young Artists▪, and of the Master-pieces of those who have desired to be admitted into the Academy. The Representations and Busts of several persons who have contributed to the establishment of this Academy are here also preserved. And in regard Painting is not the only thing here exercised but Sculpture also, they have got hither from Rome the models in Plaister of the most famous Statues of Antiquity, as that of Flora, of Hercules in the Palace of Farneze, of Venus, of the two Wrest∣lers, and of several others. Here are also several Bass-reliefs, and Sculptures better than ordinary.

There is a very considerable number of them which are placed in Ranks one degree higher than another as in an Amphitheater; in which place there stands also a Model in Plaister of that beautiful Pillar which the Roman Senate Consecrated to the Memory of the Emperor Tra∣jan, which is the best Monument that remains of the ancient Grandeur of Rome: by this we may see the Perfection to which the Ancients had brought the Art of designing. The King caused this Model to be made at a very great expence: It hath cost near two hundred thousand Franks. Francis I. had made the same thing with a design to have raised such another Pillar at Fontainebleau; but Death preventing▪ the Stones ••ay by neglect∣ed, and were after made use of to build a stable. M. Felibien hath the care and oversight of these things, to place them in their proper stations. No man understands these matters better than himself, as appears sufficiently by his Works. We shall say in its proper place how much the Learn∣ed are obliged to him for those Books with which he has enrich'd the Publick, as his Dictionary of the Arts; his lives of the Painter, which he has published in four Volumes, perfectly well writ, besides which we have hardly any thing on that Subject in our Language: with several other pieces on divers subjects of Archi tecture and Painting.\n\ndescription Page 39\n\nThe other Academy established in this Palais Brion is that of Architecture, which takes up all the Apartments at the further end of the Court. This Academy the King erected in the year 1672. and placed it under the Authority of the Super∣intendant of the Buildings, of which the illustri∣ous Monsieur Blondel is the Director. Who had the honour to teach the Mathematicks to the Dauphin, of whom we shall speak more at large when we come to treat of his Cabinet. It is he also who makes the publick Lectures of Archi∣tecture in this place. The Hall where the Mem∣bers of this Academy assemble is adorned with curious designs, and one may easily distinguish from the rest, the Model which the Chevalier Bernin made of the Louvre when the King sent for him from Rome on this account.\n\nIn the middle of the Court is placed a Horse of Brass a little bigger than the life. This the King caused to be brought from Nancy. It stands upon a Pedestal, and remains here till it be re∣moved to some place where it may be more ex∣posed to publick View.\n\nWhen you go from hence you ought to visit the House of Monsieur de la Fosse, who dwells cross the way: here you may see several Pieces of Painting in his way, much esteemed.\n\nObserve as you go that the Rüe de Richelieu for the length, and for the beauty of the Houses, which are all built in a strait Line, is one of the most beautiful and regular Streets of Paris. It takes its name from the great Cardinal de Riche∣lieu, who during his Ministry, caused it to be considerably enlarged, and the Gate to be made at the end which leads out of Town on the side next Montmartre. In the same Street these\n\ndescription Page 40\n\nVerses of M. de Santeüil, are engraved on a Fountain.\n\nQui quondam tenuit Magnum Moder amen a qua∣rum, Richelius, Fonti plauderet ipse novo, 1674.\n\nThe Sea did once submit to Richlieu's will, This Fountain's part o'th' mighty Em∣pire still. 1674.\n\nAs you go forward you come to the house of M. Mignard, who has by him many Curiosities. From thence you go to\n\nThe Hôtel de Jarz, so called from a Com∣mander of Malta, who bought the Ground of the Abbot of St. Victor, and built it. It is one of the best Works of Monsieur Mansard for de∣sign.\n\nThe Gate is a curious piece, and the Stair-case is very light, and consequently pleasant: The Apartments are large and high. But to say the Truth, they are not so convenient as beautiful. On the Garden side are contrived two small Ca∣binets (or Closets) supported with Pillars with much Art and Industry, but they are two small for the bigness of the Pillars which support them.\n\nAdjoyning to this is the Hôtel de Louvois: there are many things to be taken notice of in this house, but more especially the Stair-case, and the Room of Audience. As for the Apartments they are contrived to the best advantage, and no man can desire better Furniture than is seen here.\n\ndescription Page 41\n\nRich Tapistry, Branches for Candles, Tables, Looking-glasses of Silver, Embroidered Beds, and in fine, all that can contribute to magnificence and neatness, may be here seen, every thing in its proper place. The face of the Building on the Garden side, and that next the Court correspond and are both of a curious Symetry. You must not neglect to observe as you pass, the Locks on the doors, which are very finely wrought, and kept with such care that they shew like Silver.\n\nOver against this Hôtel is a long Gallery, in which was formerly kept the Library of Cardinal Mazarine, at present in the College of the four Nations. The Stable was underneath. The Duke of Nevers uses the Chambers that are at the end, where you may see some Ceiling pieces well Painted. Of late this Gallery hath been broken through, to make room for a new street that runs cross from the Rüe Vivien to the Rüe de Richelieu, to which they have given the name of Monsieur Colbert.\n\nAt the further end of the Rüe de Richelieu you come into the Street of S. Augustin, so called from the Religious men of that Saints Order, other∣wise called les petits Peres (the little Fathers) whose house stands at the end and takes up part of this Street.\n\nIn this Street are many very fair houses. About three or four years since the Sieur Douilly Receiver of the Generalty of Poitiers, built one over against the Nuns of S. Thomas, on which he hath laid out one hundred thousand Crowns: there is nothing wanting but a little more Room, but it was impossi∣ble to have allotted more to the Work, it being shut up between the Petits-peres, and the R••e Vivien. Otherwise all is handsom. The Stair-case\n\ndescription Page 42\n\nis very light and large, and the Gate contri∣ved after the manner of a Vault is very well pro∣portioned; I say nothing of the Moveables, for one may well conclude that a house which appears so well without, wants for no Furniture, and that the beauty within is equal to that on the out∣side.\n\nIn the same Street stands the Hôtel de Gra∣mont. This House hath for a long time been justly esteemed one of the fairest of Paris. It did once belong to the Sieur Monerot, who spa∣red no Cost to make it Glorious. And it still preserves its Beauty, for its Furniture is most magnificent, since it came to the Duke of Gramont. It looks towards Montmartre which renders its situation extreme pleasant.\n\nNear this is the Hôtel de Grantè, not all out so magnificent, but very commodious and plea∣sant, because of its Garden which is one of the neatest of Paris, the abode of the Mareschal of that name. This Hôtel did once belong to the Sieur Thevenin, who was a very curious per∣son.\n\nNot far from hence is the House of St. Cotte-Blanche. Here was formerly a very good Libra∣ry: and it was once adorned with very good Fur∣niture and curious Pictures, but its Master having changed his Fortune, all these things are now dispersed.\n\nThe House of M. Fremont, and several others that look upon the Fields, are not unpleasant.\n\nThe House of M. de Bois-Franc, Intendant of the Duke of Orleans, which is on the other side of the Street, is one of the most finished things that can be seen. The face of the Building next the Court is extreme regular, set off with a kind\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nof Portico whose Pillars are of the Ionick Order, with Vases on the top done about with Festons and other Ornaments, all which give you a plea∣sing object as you enter. Round about the Court are Busts of Emperors placed between the Arches that support the Building. The Stair-case is very spacious, with a Balustrade of Wood painted like white Marble, and wrought with a great deal of design. The Bas-reliefs on the Doors of the se∣veral Apartments, tho they be but of Plaister, are notwithstanding very Ornamental. There is also in this House a Cabinet (or Closet) of very choice Books. As you go out you ought to ob∣serve the great Gate which is extremely well con∣trived on a very odd sort of a Foundation.\n\nThe Rue Vivien.\n\nIn this Street are several great Houses. That where dwells Monsieur Desmarais, Intendant of the Finances, and Nephew of Monsieur Colbert, deserves to be viewed: but above all\n\nThe Kings Cabinet.\n\nThe House wherein this is kept hath but a very ordinary appearance; and one would hardly be∣lieve by the outside, that it contains within so many curious things.\n\nFirst, here is kept the Kings Library, which was heretofore at Fontainbleau, which Charles V. began, and which has been since much augment∣ed by Francis I. and Catherine de Medicis.\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nBut of late years it hath been made much more numerous, in regard that at present here are more than fifty thousand Volumes, among which are twelve, or fifteen thousand Manuscripts in He∣brew, Greek, Arabick, Syriack, Latin, French, and almost all Languages. As for printed Books, there is no rare piece that can be heard of▪ but you may find here a Copy. Here are several very ancient Manuscripts of St. C••prian, which Cathe∣rine de Medicis brought with her, as also divers other very scarce Books, out of the famous Li∣brary of Laurence de Medicis. There are also some pieces of the History of France, which have been Collected very particularly and are kept here with great care. The Duke of Bethune, hath composed a considerable number touching the most important Negotiations which have been from the time of Francis I. to the Mini∣stry of Cardinal de Richelieu. All these Volumes are curiously bound in Turkie-Leather of a Flame-colour, gilt, and the Kings Arms on the Covers. Books of Prints have here also their proper places, of which there are here several great Volumes Collected by Monsieur the Abbot Marolles, the most curious person of his time, in these matters. The several Masters are pla∣ced in several Shelves, the Italians, Flemings, the Dutch, and the French, so that without much trouble one may observe their peculiar ways and fancies, and how these great Masters arrived to perfection in the Art of Painting, by different Roads. Here are also several Ancient Volumes of Limnings or Miniatures, well and carefully preserved, in which one may remarque the singularity of the Habits of our Ancestors, and their odd fancies in designing; but the most\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nbeautiful things of this kind are certain Collecti∣ons of Animals and Plants, design'd upon Vellum, after the life, by Monsieur Robert, who hath la∣boured a long time to render this Work com∣pleat as we now see it. Here you may see a very great Volume in Folio, containing all sorts of Sea-Fish, this the States of Holland presented to Cardinal Mazarine, after a good Office re∣ceived from that Minister, in a long Negotiation; and after his death it was placed in this Cabinet. In fine you may view in this Library whatsoever Book you can desire upon any Subject. Monsieur the Prior of Nogent, Son to Monsieur Colbert, is the Library keeper, M▪ Carcavi is Keeper un∣der him, and M. Clement hath under him the care of placing the Books, and keeping the Cata∣logue.\n\nBooks are not the only Curiosity to be seen in this place. The Medals here are one of the most considerable Treasures. Here are of all sorts, Ancient and Modern, no less than twenty thou∣sand. Certainly there is not in all Italy a more considerable Collection, They are placed accor∣ding to the order of time in little Cabinets of Cedar, whose Drawers are▪ gilt and Titled neatly; The sequel of the latter Greek Empire is so compleat, that the Learned M. du Cange hath composed from hence the last Volume of his Bi∣zantine History. As for the Moderns here are all that can be met with not only of Popes, Kings, Princes of Grmany and Italy, but of every other Nation, even the very Jettons (or Counters) which remarque any particular event of History are here preserved. Here are also a great number of ancient Agates, among others one represent∣ing Constantine the Great Crowned with Lawrel,\n\ndescription Page 46\n\nextremely rare for its variety of Colours, and for its bigness, besides that it was wrought in the time of that Emperour as all Antiquaries agree. Also several others representing divers matters.\n\nBut one of the greatest and most singular Rari∣ties of this Cabinet, in the Judgment of all men, is the Tomb of Childeric the fourth King of France, who lived in the year 458. and was the immediate Predecessor of Clouis. This Monu∣ment was discovered at Tournay in the year 1653. As certain Workmen were digging near the Ca∣thedral Church in an old Burial-place in order to lay a Foundation for a Sacristy; they first disco∣vered the skeliton of a Horses Head, and after that near the same place a long Stone in nature of a Tomb, which Stone the Workmen were fain to break before they could remove it; But they were surprised to find under it the Bones of a Man all lying in their natural and pro∣per situation. Curiosity urging them to exa∣mine this discovery still further, they found among the Bones a good quantity of Greek Medals of Gold, of the latter Empire, with a great num∣ber of Flies of the same metal, with their wings half open, and enamelled with Cornelian. The noise of this spread over the Town immediately, and the Canons of the Cathedral Church came to the place to consider what these things might discover. In fine, they still found further a kind of Clasp, a great Buckle, and an Oxes head of Gold also, which last was apparently the repre∣sentation of that Divinity which they at that time Worshiped. There was also a Sword garnished with the same metal. But that which effectually discovered this to be the Tomb of King Childe∣ric, was a Seal-Ring of Gold, on which was cut a\n\ndescription Page 47\n\nhead, with these words about it, Sigillum Chil∣derici Regis. We need not say that there was also certain Table-books, with their needle or pen, of gold, the Iron head of a Battle-axe almost consumed with rust, with a Ball of Christal solid and round like an egg which served in his Sickness to cool his mouth, or for some other use accor∣ding to the Custom of that age, now unknown. All these things were collected together with a great deal of care. And the Arch Duke who was then Governor of the Low-Countries, desi∣ring to have this precious Monument for his own Cabinet, the Canons of Turney could not refuse him; but that Prince dying, it came to the Em∣perours possession. After this the Elector of Col••gne, who had used his utmost endeavours to obtain it from the Arch-Duke in his life-time, made now the same requests to the Emperour, who sent him the Monument as soon as he desired. This the Elector presented to the King, who caused it to be placed in his own Cabinet, where it is now preserved as an evidence of the high An∣tiquity of the French Monarchy, and the original of the Flowers-de-Lis, contrary to what Chiflet hath writ in his Book called Anastasis Childerici, to which Book Monsieur de St. Amant hath ex∣tremely well answered and made it apparent that those things which they found in the Tomb like Flies, were indeed Flowers-de-Lis, and not Bees, as that Author imagines.\n\nUnder M Carcavi, abovementioned, M. Vail∣lant is employed in keeping the Medals, who hath been several times in the Levant, to make Collections of such things. He published in La∣tin not many years since a History of the King∣dom of the Seleucides, collected from the Medals\n\ndescription Page 48\n\nin this Cabinet, in which he has discovered his pro∣found knowledge in this Science, and hath at the same time been mighty serviceable to the Learned in explaining many things, which they would hardly have understood perfectly without his help.\n\nHere you may see also over the Chimny several other Antiquities, as Lacrimatories, such as the Ancients used to gather the tears in of those that wept at Funerals and then place 'em in the Tombs; Lamps; little Idols, and abundance of such like things.\n\nThe Academy of Sciences, meet in this house; for whose use the King caused the Observatory to be built. The Learned Men who compose this Academy, labour continually for new Discoveries in Natural Philosopby and the Mathematicks, who being persons of extraordinary Science, the Reader will not be displeased to see their names and they are\n\nM.

Pequet, P.\n\nM. Roberval, P.\n\nM. The Abbot Picard, M.\n\nM. Gaïer, P.\n\nM.

All their Rooms are filled with Books, every Author being obliged to give a Copy here, to obtain his Priviledge, which makes the Number augment daily.\n\nThe Rue des Petits Champs.\n\nFrom the Rüe Vivien of which we have been treating, let us now turn to the Rüe des petits Champs which lies at the end of the other. The first thing which we find remarkable in this Street as you enter from the Rüe St. Honorè, is\n\ndescription Page 50\n\nThe Hôtel de la Vrilliere, the abode of Mon∣sieur de la Vrilliere de Château Neuf, one of the four Secretaries of State. This Hôtel is one of the fairest of Paris, and best exposed to view, by reason it fronts full upon the Rüe des Fossez. The Portal is supported with Pillars of the Dorick Order, with two great Statues upon Pedestals above. The forepart of the house is in manner of a Terrase, and joyns the two Wings. The Court is exactly square; and the outside of the Buildings hath all the 〈…〉〈…〉 be desired, the Ornaments being 〈…〉〈…〉 exceeding just and regular proportion. For the Apartments beside their Gilding and Sculpture, they are adorn∣ed with most magn••••••ck Furniture, among other things one may there ••••e a Suit of Tapistry repre∣senting the twelve Months of the year, of a most singular design. The Gallery is full of excellent pictures, of the ablest Masters. There is one piece of Bassan highly esteemed, and admired by all the Curious. This Beautiful House is the De∣sign of Francis Mansard. Almost cross the way is\n\nThe Hôtel de Emery, in which Monsieur Fou∣quet dwelt for some time, and after him Monsieur the Mareschal de Turenne: It is one of the most capacious houses that you can meet with. M. Per∣rault Controller of the Buildings uses one part of it, which he has fitted up extreme neatly. Af∣ter this you come to\n\nThe Hôtel de Ceneterre, which hath this pe∣culiar, that it is encompassed on all sides with Streets. It is vast and Commodious, and the Garden extream pretty. The Sieur le Févre of Orleans was the Architect that built it. The Furniture is Magnifick. Going still forward in the same street you come to\n\ndescription Page 51\n\nThe Hôtel Colbert, where dwelt the deceased Monsieur Colbert Minister and Secretary of State, and Controller general of the Finances (or Reve∣nue.) There appears in this Fabrick much re∣gularity with an excellent Gust and very peculiar. The Court is square, and the Buildings about it of such a neat contrivance that you can hardly meet with the like elsewhere. The Apartments are disposed with wonderful Judgment. But that which is most observable is the Portal on the Court-side, which is formed Vault-fashion ex∣treme skilfully, with the Kings Bust in the far∣ther part of it, of Chevalier Bernini's hand. This piece of Work is in its kind one of the best per∣formed and handsomest things that can be seen. The Library is none of the least considerable Or∣naments of this Hôtel, it is one of the fairest that we have at present, for the number of Books, but chiefly for the very considerable Manuscripts which are not to be met with else where. Among others there is a very Ancient Bible, of the time of the Emperor Charles the Bald, with a great many Volumes of Negotiations in the time of Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarine, which take up all that end of the Gallery next the House, Mon∣sieur the Abbot Baluze is the Library-keeper, which Learned Person is so well known through all Europe that it is needless to say any thing here in his commendation. He hath published several Works which sufficiently discover his profound knowledge, among others Capitularia Regum Fancorum in three Volumes in Folio; certain Learned Dissertations on several contested Sub∣jects, and in fine, some Pieces which time had concealed, and which with great Study and pains he daily brings to light under the Title of Mis∣cellanea,\n\ndescription Page 52\n\nto which he prefixes proper Prefaces, by which we are acquainted with the Lives and Me∣rits of the Authors. Most part of these excellent things he draws from the Manuscripts of this Li∣brary. On one side of this House lies\n\nThe Hôtel de Boüillon la Marq. Of late this is joyned to the Hôtel Colbert, and as it is now re-built it is much more commodious and neat than formerly.\n\nThe House of M. de Menars Master of Re∣quests in the Generality of Paris is in the same Row next the Rüe du Mail. You may here see the famous Library of the Messieurs de Thou. The Name of those Illustrious Persons to whom it hath belonged, cannot but raise our esteem and curiosity for such a Collection, and by the print∣ed Catalogue we may easily perceive the number and rarity of the Books. M. Quesnel who hath the care of them, hath placed them in the exact∣est order that can be desired, and this Library hath lost nothing of the Beauty and Reputation which it formerly had when it belonged to Mes∣sieurs de Thou, which makes us hope that it may also e're long be publick as it was formerly. Re∣turning again from the Rüe de petits-Champs, you go to\n\nThe Palais Mazarin. There is no place in Paris where you will meet with more Curiosities. or see richer Furniture than in this Palace. The front of the Building on that side next the Court is of Brick and Free-Stone, with two Statues of white Marble, which shew curiously as you enter. The Stair-case on the right hand leads to the A∣partments, composed of many Chambers whose Cielings are adorned with Gilding and Pictures of the best Masters of the Age: As for the Fur∣niture,\n\ndescription Page 53\n\nit is in all the Rooms Magnific, and it is continually changed with the Season of the year; In one of the Chambers, all the Gold∣smiths Work, as a great Branch for lights, the Chenets, and several other things, were all de∣sign'd by the famous Cavalier Bernini, which is infinitely more esteemed by the curious than the Metal of which they are wrought. After you have gone through several Chambers on the same floor, hung with rich Tapistry heightned with Gold and Silver, you are brought into a Gallery filled on each side with Cabinets adorned with precious Stones, and Chizil-work in Gold and Silver, placed upon Tables of Marble or inlaid Stone. You see there also Vases of Jasper and Alablaster of several sizes, with little Statues in Brass of delicate Workmanship. The floor of this Gallery is covered with a Turky-work Carpet all of one piece, and of an extraordinary length. The Apartments below Stairs are no less magnific than those above. All the Rooms are full of Germain Cabinets, and China, with Trunks of Japan, wonderfully light and sweet: besides this here are abundance of Marble Statues brought out of Italy with extraordinary Cost. In one of these Rooms you may see on a Table, a small Figure of the same Piece; it is about half a foot high and represents a Cibelle holding a Book in her hand, this is mightily esteemed. In another Room near this are several great Tables of Por∣phyry and Marble; the Lower-Gallery and the Hall through which you pass to it, are also full of Busts and ancient Statues. This Galery is of the same length with that of which I have already spoke. In fine, no one place can shew us toge∣ther so great variety of curious things; Clocks,\n\ndescription Page 54\n\nPendulums of an extraordinary nature, Statues of Silver, and Silver gilt, with Vases of the same, and all these things very numerous. On Corpus Christi Day some of the Rich Tapistry belonging to this Hôtel is exposed to publick View, of which there is enough to hang a whole street.\n\nBefore the Gate they place the rich Housses, (or Trappings) embroidered with Gold and Silver, which Cardinal Mazarine caused to be made a∣gainst the Cerimonies of the Kings Marriage; they are surprisingly magnificent. Those belong∣ing to the Mules and Led-Horses are embroidered upon red Velvet, with the Arms of the Cardinal in the middle, and several devices in the corners, with other Ornaments To conclude, one cannot express all the rich and brave things that are in this Magni••ick Palace.\n\nFurther on, is, The House of Monsieur de Saint Poüange, which belongs at present to Monsieur de Bechamel Marquess of Nointel. This House is very well Built; the inside is extraordinary neat, and so is the Garden and Stair-case, which last are reckoned among the best of Paris. But that which is chiefly to be observed, is the excellent piece of Perspective Painted by the Sieur Rousseau on one of the Court-Walls; it is in its kind the best of the Kingdom, and one cannot meet with any thing more pleasing to the Eye than that magnifick Architecture which is there represent∣ed. You come next to\n\nThe Hôtel de Lionne, which the late Monsieur de Lionne, Marquess of Berni, and Secretary of State, built from the Ground, for which he em∣ployed the Sieur de Veau the Kings Architect. Monsieur the Mareschal de Villeroy, and the Duke, his Son, dwell here at present. The out∣side\n\ndescription Page 55\n\nof this Hôtel is of a very handsom contri∣vance, set off with the Ornaments of Archite∣cture. The inward parts are extreme commodi∣ous, and the Garden which lies behind is very ad∣vantagious to its graceful View. There was a design of building a Library here, but the Ma∣sters death arriving too soon, put a stop to the performance.\n\nNear this is a great House newly built at the very corner of the Rüe St. Anne, belonging to Monsieur de Grand-Maison, heretofore Trea∣surer of the Extraordinaries of War, who hath spared no cost to make it so beautiful as it is.\n\nAlmost exactly cross the Way is the House of the Sieur Baptist de Lully of whom we spoke when we treated of the Opera, this House is ador∣ned on the outside with great Corinthian Pilasters.\n\nIn the Rue Sainte Anne\n\nIs the House called les novelles Converties, (or New Converts) built about ten or twelve years ago, with the Alms of several Persons of Quality, among others, the famous Monsieur de Turenne, for the Habitation of those Families who should embrace our Religion. Their Church is but small, and there is nothing curious in it to observe.\n\nThe Convent des Petits-Peres stands in this quarter, at the further end of the Rüe Sainte Augustin. King Lewis XIII. was the Founder, and left 'em wherewithal to begin the Fabrick of their Church which is not yet finished. There is nothing observable in their house. On the\n\ndescription Page 56\n\nFountain which stands at their Gate you read this Inscription.\n\nQuae dat aquas, Saxo latet Hospita Nympha sub imo. Sic tu cum dederis Dona, latere velis. 1684.\n\nThe Nymph lies hid which do's this Water yield, So be thou, when thou'rt doing good, conceal'd.1684.\n\nIn the Rüe des Fossez, which is near this, is\n\nThe Hôtel de Pompone, where dwells Monsieur de Pompone, formerly Secretary of State. This House was heretofore called the Hôtel de l'Hôpital, and belonged to Monsieur the Mareschal of that name. Not far from these places of which we have spoke you go to\n\nThe Hôtel de Soisons belonging to Madam the Princess of Carignan, and Madam the Dutchess of Nemours, Heiresses of the late Monsieur the Comte de Soissons, Lewis of Bourbon, Prince of the Blood. It was first built by Catherine of Medicis for her retreat after the death of Hen. II. her Husband, and here she remained a long time during her Widow-hood. The outside of this House is but mean, but the Apartments are hand∣som and extremely well furnished. The Garden is one of the greatest of Paris, and furnished with very handsom Orangers. Here is a great Pillar raised in one of the Corners of the Court, with a small Stair-case contrived within it, in imi∣tation\n\ndescription Page 57\n\nof that of Trajan at Rome, Report says that this was built by Catherine of Medicis, who had great skill in Astrology, and that she used fre∣quently to go up to the top of this Pillar to make her Observations. Joyning to the Walls of this Hotel stands the Chappel which serves only for the use of those of the Family. It is called the Queens Chappel, because it was built at the same time with the rest of the House, and Catherine de Medicis came often hither to hear Mass in publick. Near this is the Street called Rüe de Gre∣nelle in which stands\n\nThe Hôtel Seguier. This was formerly called the Hôtel de Bellegarde, it being built by the Duke of that name while he was great Master of the Horse of France under the Reign of Hen. IV. who imployed him in great Negotiations and sent him to Florence in order to his Marriage with Mary of Medicis. Monsieur the Chancellor Se∣guier, when he came to dwell here enlarged it very considerably, and built that beautiful Gallery which takes up one side of the Garden. The inside is extreme handsom, and the Wain scot Work is of the best kind that one can desire to see, all is gilt and adorn'd with Pictures done by the Sieur Voëte, who had the Reputation in his time, of a good Painter. There are also some Landskips done by other good Masters, which are admira∣ble. That which was very remarkable in this Gallery during the life of Monsieur the Chancel∣lor, was a great number of Porcelain Vessels that were placed all round the Gallery upon the Cor∣ni••••••, and which made the finest shew that could be. It was difficult to find in any one place a greater quantity, and better collected. Here were also Cabinets placed between the Windows\n\ndescription Page 58\n\non both sides. At the end of this Gallery you enter on the left hand into a Chamber which was richly adorned with Tapistry, where were several rich pieces of Goldsmiths work, among others, a great Frame curiously wrought in which stood the Picture of the late Monsieur the Chancellor done by M. le Brun.\n\nYou might also have seen here a Cabinet of Ebony enriched with ancient Agates representing the Emperors heads, and in a little Cabinet near this, a great number of Animals very considera∣ble, some in Vases, and some in Pictures, wrought by the best Masters of Italy, and by those who dwelt at Limoges in the last Age. Madame the Chanceliere, who deceased not long since, had here a Cabinet of Crystal most delicately cut, with abundance of Watches and Clocks, enriched with precious stones: few Houses in Europe had a greater quantity of Silver Vessels. You might have seen here a whole Service of Silver gilt most magnificently, each piece being extraordinary both for the bigness and workmanship. But that which was the greatest Ornament of this Noble House was the numerous Libary, valued at near two hundred thousand Crowns. Which Library was first begun by Monsieur the President Seguier, and by him given in his Will to his Nephew, Monsieur the Chancellor. It was situate over the Gallery of which we have already spoken. We need not say that it was full of very curious Books, that may easily be supposed since it was collected by the ablest man of his Age, and to say all, by him whom the French Academy made choice of for their Protector after the decease of the great Cardinal de Richlieu, in whose House they al∣ways assembled till such time as the King setled\n\ndescription Page 59\n\nthem in the Louvre, where at present they re∣main. There were in this Library a great num∣ber of very rare Manuscripts, whose names we find cited by Authors who have here made use of them. We may expect one day to see a Ca∣talogue of them, which was never yet made publick. But this will not be till the Inventory be finished, and then all these choice Books which have been so long collecting together with so much pains by the greatest men of their time, shall be exposed to publick Sale, and dispersed among those who will give the prizes demanded. Such was the state of this Hôtel during the life of Monsieur the Chancellor Seguier, who held that great Office for many years with universal applause, and that during very unsetled times:\n\nAt the end of the Rüe de grenelle, you come into the Rüe Platriere, in which Street stand two fair Houses.\n\nThat of Monsieur de Bouillon, and that of the late Monsieur de Herval, Controller-Ge∣neral of the Finances. The last of these was built with much care. You may see there se∣veral good paintings of Monsieur Mignard, and a Bed with its Furniture extreme Rich. This House stands in the place where were former∣ly the Stables belonging to the Hôtel de Eper∣non.\n\nIn the Rüe Coquéron at the end of the Rüe du Bouloy, is\n\nThe Hôtel de Gesures, whose outside is neat and Furniture within very handsom. It did once belong to Monsieur de Fontenay-Mareüil, so well known for his famous Embassies, and above all for that to Rome.\n\ndescription Page 60\n\nFurther on is the House of the Sieur Monginot, built but four or five years since. On which he hath made a considerable expence. It looks very great on the Court-side, and the Apartments which are disposed in enfilades (or through Pro∣spects) are magnificently furnished with Tapistry, Chenets of Silver, and all the Furniture for the Chimny of the same; In fine, all is extreme neat, and nothing seems wanting, unless it were a lit∣tle more light to the Stair-case, but as it is pla∣ced it is impossible to make it lighter.\n\nThe Church of St. Eustache.\n\nThis Church was formerly but a small Chappel dedicated to St. Agnes, and depended upon the Chapter of St. Germain le Auxerrois. The pre∣sent Fabrick was begun to be built in the year 1521. and the first Stone was laid by the Provost of Paris, by name John de la Barre. It is at present the greatest and most spacious of the Kingdom. The Grandeur of the Building, the number of the Pillars which in truth are a little too thick crowded together, and the heighth of the Roof, with the Chappels that are round it, considered altogether, render this Edifice Maje∣stick. Among other things the two Chappels which are on each side of the great Gate ought to be observed. One of which is appropriated to Baptism, and Painted by Monsieur Mignard, the other for Marriage, and Painted By Monsieur de la Fosse: Monsieur Colbert did contribute to their decoration. In the Chappel of Marriage stands the Model of the great Portal which is to be raised before this Church, which Work will be\n\ndescription Page 61\n\nvery expensive. The Pulpit is well wrought in imitation of that at St. Estienne du Mons, but it falls short of that. Overhead is a great Picture representing the Apparition of our Lord, painted after the manner of Monsieur le Brun; this Pi∣cture was given by Monsieur Colbert, as seems by his Arms at the bottom. Adjoyning to one of the Pillars in the Nave on the left hand as you enter, you see a great Bas-relief of white Marble on a Foundation of black, which is the Epitaph of the famous Monsieur de la Chambre, so re∣nowned for his Writings, this is contrived in a Medaillon held up by Immortality, and to make her more obvious and better understood, over head is a Cartel or Scroul with these words out of the Scripture graven therein\n\nSpes illorum Immortalitate plena est.\n\nTheir Hope is full of Immortality.\n\nThis curious piece is the Workmanship of the Sieur Baptist Turcy, who wrought after the de∣sign of Monsieur le Brun. The other things in this Church are of no great consideration. Mon∣sieur the Chancellor Seguier, and Monsieur de Bullion Sur-Intendant of the Finances under the Ministration of Cardinal de Richolieu, were Be∣nefactors to this Work. Monsieur de la Mothe le Vayer, formerly Tutor to Monsieur, and so well known for his rare Writings, and Monsieur the Abbot of Bourfay of the French Academy, are enterred here.\n\nIN the Rüe Coquilliere which is near St. Eusta∣che, stands the House of Monsieur Berrier Secretary of the Council: in whose Garden was\n\ndescription Page 62\n\nfound the Bust of Cybele, formerly▪ mentioned. The Portal, tho it makes no great shew outward∣ly, yet within it is of singular beauty, adorned with Corinthian Pilasters of an admirable Gust. The Garde des Sceaux (or Lord-Keeper of the Seals) de Chateau-neuf dwelt here.\n\nThese are the principal things that are to be seen in this Quarter.\n\nBehind St. Eustache lies the Rüe Montmartre, near the further end of which Street stands the little Church of St. Joseph, in whose Church∣yard is interred the famous Moliere, so well known for his Comedies.\n\nNear St. Eustache is the great Market called la Halle which place ought to be avoided as much as may be, because of the continual Crowd of People that frequent it. Formerly they executed the Criminals here as they do now at the Greve. And we read in the History of Charles VI. that the Provost of Paris, named Montaigu, who was also great Treasurer, had in this place by means of the Duke of Bourgoyn his head chopt off; to the great regret of the Parisians, he be∣ing a very good man. But the King abhorring this cruel Act of Injustice, which had been done in his Name during the time of his distraction, restored his Memory and Family again to their former honour; and the Celestins of Paris, to whom he had given his House of Marcoussy, went and took down his Body from the Gibbet at Monfaucon, four Months after his Death, and having performed his Funeral Offices in the most Magnificent manner they could, they interred his Body at Marcoussy, where they raised him a Mo∣nument, which remains at this day. This was a rare example of gratitude and generosity in\n\ndescription Page 63\n\nMonks, as is well observed by Juvenal des Ʋrsius Arch-Bishop of Reins, a faithful Historian of that Kings Reign.\n\nNear the Rüe Montorgueil is the Hôtel de Bour∣gogne; which House the ancient Dukes of that name formerly gaveto the Brotherhood of the Pas∣sion established in the Church of Trinity-Hospital in the Rüe S. Denis, on condition that they should represent here interludes of Devotion; but since those times Peoples Relish being changed, they have since represented here other Plays of Profane Subjects. And at present the Italian Comedians are possessed of this House, since the union of the two Companies of French Players, which the King caused three or four years ago. This Thea∣tre is perhaps one of the Ancientest of Europe, for it is thought that there have been publick Shows in this place six hundred years ago. In former times Comedies were only represented by wandring Companies of Pilgrims of the holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, who were since called Jongleurs. These having no certain Residence used at the corners of Streets, to relate the Adventures which they had met with in their Travels, and People being concerned at their stories, and com∣miserating the several dangers they had passed through, would give them very liberally conside∣rable Alms. The ancient Dukes of Burgundy, seeing People take some pleasure in hearing them, he gave them a Room in his Hôtel, where all people might come and hear them with better conveniency than in the Street. But in time, these Masters of devout Subjects degenerated into profane Tales, and in effect so very profane that they became meer Farces and very irregular re∣presentations. In such sort that Christianity could\n\ndescription Page 64\n\nnot honestly permit them. Thus it lasted during the ignorance of those Ages. And it was this that still gives occasion to those who do not con∣sider the difference between this ancient sort of Comedies and those now acted, to consound all together. Whereas in truth the nature of Co∣medy is so far changed, by the care of the great Cardinal de Richelieu, that there remains nothing of that which made it Condemned.\n\nADjoyning to the Rüe Montorgüeil, is the Rüe Mont-martre, and divers little streets run from one to the other, the Principal of which is the Rüe de Cleri in which stands the House of M. Bertelot, Intendant of the Houshold to Madam the Dauphiness. It is composed of two joyning Courts, of a very particular design. The Furniture is very handsom.\n\nNear this is another House belonging to the Sieur Rolland, built after the designs of Monsieur des Argues a famous Architect: by the outward appearance you may easily conclude that it be∣longs to one of an excellent Judgment. But the inside and the Front next the Court surpass all the rest. Nothing can be more regular nor bet∣ter proportioned than the Staircase, which is raised upon a very odd sort of Plan, and where the Ar∣chitect had need of all his Art and Study to have made it as it is.\n\nThis is all of note in this Quarter. Some other things there may be of which I have not spoke; but they appear of so little Consideration that they are not thought worth mentioning. In the next place we pass to\n\ndescription Page 65\n\nThe Rue St. Denis.\n\nThis Street begins at the great Châtelet, which stands at the end of Pont au Change▪ as we have al∣ready said. In this place the Civil and Criminal Courts are held for the City and Prevôtè (or Pro∣vostship) of Paris; which Jurisdiction is at pre∣sent divided into two parts, according to the course of the River, into the old and new Châtelet; and the Officers know their several Divisions.\n\nThe great Butchery, which is near the great Châtelet, is the oldest of all Paris, nay hereto∣fore it was the only one. It did heretofore be∣long to a Community of Townsmen, who made among themselves a kind of little Republick, which bore such Credit and Authority among the Inhabitants, that often times there happened great Disorders through the discontent of these People, who under the Reign of Charles VI. took part with the Factious. At present this Butchery is reunited to the rest of Paris. Further on is\n\nThe Hospital of the Nuns of St. Catherine, These are bound to entertain for one night such poor Maids as are in want. They are also obliged to bury the Bodies of those that are found dead in several places, and who are to be exposed some days at the Châtelet to see if they can be known.\n\nNear this is the Church of St. Opportune. This was formerly a Priory of Nuns depending on the Abby of Almaneche in Normandy, with∣in the Diocess of Seeze, but at present it is a Col∣legiate Church of eight or ten Chanons, who here perform the Ecclesiastical Offices. Going still forward, you come to\n\ndescription Page 66\n\nThe Fountain of the Holy Innocents.\n\nThis Fountain stands at the corner of the Rüe aux-Fers, a Street full of Mercers and Silk-men. It is the admiration of all that are skilled in Ar∣chitecture and Sculpture, and without doubt it is one of the handsomest objects in its kind that can be seen, by reason of the Basses-tailles ex∣tremely fine, both for the design and performance; most of the Figures represent Nymphs in divers Postures pouring Streams of Water out of their Urns. The Chevalier Bernin, who was of a Gust difficult enough, admired this Work, and prosessed that he had not seen any thing so fine in all France. It was made by the famous John Gougeon, who finished it in the year 1550. In the upper part you may read this Inscription\n\nFontium Nymphis.\n\nTo the Nymphs of the Fountains.\n\nA little beyond stands the Church of the holy Sepulchre, which was first built for the Pilgrims of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, who were here entertained for some days. At present it is a Collegiate-Church the Collation of whose Cha∣nons belongs to the Chapter of Nôtre-Dame. The Altar is very handsomly wrought, and the Picture over it was Monsieur Colberts gift, and Painted by Monsieur le Brun.\n\nThe Church of St. Leu, and St. Giles is a little further. In one of the Chappels here is interred the Mother of Monsieur the first President de La∣moignon,\n\ndescription Page 67\n\nwhose Tomb of Marble is a well wrought thing and designed by Monsieur Girar∣don, on it is a Bas-relief much esteemed. The Picture over the great Altar is also highly valued, it being the work of one Porbus a famous Painter.\n\nA little higher is the Hospital of St. Jacques, on the other side of the way. It was founded by the Alms of certain Citizens who obtained a Licence of Lewis Hutin in the year 1315. It was formerly appointed for the entertainment and lodging of those who passed this way in their Journey to St. James in Galicia. At present the Revenue is annexed to the Invalides.\n\nWe say nothing of the Hospital of the Trini∣ty nor of the Church of St. Saviour, there be∣ing nothing curious in them, no more than there is in the Houses of the Penitent Nuns, and of those called Filles-Pieu which were built and endowed by St. Lewis; yet at the Church of these last you may observe the great Altar, which they have built of late after the same manner with that of St. Martin des Champs.\n\nThe Kings Statue.\n\nIn the Hôtel de St. Chaumont, where dwells Monsieur the Mareschal de la Feüillade, we ought to see the Kings Statue, which that illustrious Mareschal hath caused to be made at a great ex∣pence representing the King in a Roman Habit Crowned with Lawrel. It is about eleven or twelve foot high and but of one block of Mar∣ble, the greatest that was ever yet seen at Paris. The Pedestal on which it must be placed will be\n\ndescription Page 68\n\nvery high, and on the four sides will be several Bas-reliefs in Brass, representing the History of divers great Actions in this Kings Reign, as, the taking of Bezanzon, the famous Passage of the Rhine, the general Peace of Nunegu"
