        "text": "You would probably say that Marlon Brando was the actor who said, “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.” He played the character Don Vito Corleone in the movie The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Mario Puzo wrote both the book, published in 1966, and the film, produced in 1972.\n\nHowever, the line spoken by Don Vito Corleone in the movie is just a bit different. He says, \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" It's actually Al Pacino, playing Vito's son Michael Corleone, who said, \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\" Variations of the famous quote appear three times in the movie and in both sequels, The Godfather: Part II and The Godfather: Part III."
