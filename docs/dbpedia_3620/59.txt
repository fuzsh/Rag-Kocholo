Outside of the Basilica of St. Denis

Last weekend I went on a Groupon day trip to Paris. While the organisation around the trip left something to be desired, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I visited several places, and I will be posting them in several articles as I have MANY pictures. My first stop of the day was the Basilica of St. Denis, the traditional burial place of French kings and queens. The area is quite rough, and of course, the outside of the Basilica was under construction! It was a lot smaller than I expected it to be actually.

Inside the main area of the Basilica of St. Denis

The main area is free to visit, but the crypt costs 8,50 Euro. I didn’t think that was too bad. They have English language maps and folders available.

Construction was also happening inside, some tombs were partially blocked, but I did manage to see most of them.

I was very overwhelmed by it all and I didn’t really want to leave. The Basilica is amazingly beautiful and the tombs are simply breathtaking. If you’re ever in Paris, I highly recommend going here. It’s very easy to get to, it’s on the second to last stop on line 13 to St.Denis Université and is on the edge of zone 3 so you can use the Paris Visité zone 1-3 pass.
