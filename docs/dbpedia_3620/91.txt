For other dukes of Burgundy named Louis, see Louis, Duke of Burgundy (disambiguation).

Louis Joseph Xavier, Duke of Burgundy (13 September 1751 – 22 March 1761), was a French prince of the House of Bourbon, and as such was second-in-line to the throne of France, ranking behind his father, the Dauphin Louis, himself the son of Louis XV and his popular Queen, Marie Leszczyńska. Although Louis was his parents' first son to be born alive, he died of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis at the young age of nine. As a result of his untimely death, all three of his three younger brothers - Louis Auguste, Louis Stanislas, and Charles Philippe - became kings of France.
