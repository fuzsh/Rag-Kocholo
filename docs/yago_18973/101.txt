As a victim of the 2009 Tamil genocide, watching "Vanni Mouse" was an agonising yet necessary experience.

The film delves into the horrors of the Vanuvinya concentration camps, where nearly 300,000 Tamils were imprisoned and tortured by the Sri Lankan government (forces) for months after the brutal genocide. Despite its short length, Vanni Mouse delivers a hauntingly authentic glimpse into the horrors of the Vavuniya concentration camps.

What struck me most was the film's unique approach. While it garnered an award categorised as fiction, the fictional label feels like a cruel irony. The film tackles a very real and horrific event. The true cruelty lies just beneath the surface, making it all the more impactful.

The director masterfully employs shadow play. We see two mice scurrying across a stark landscape, their movements a stark contrast to the atrocities taking place just beyond a white screen. This creative technique allows us to witness the horror through silhouettes, screams, and chilling sound effects. It's a testament to the filmmaker's skill that even without graphic visuals, the film evokes a profound sense of dread and despair.

The voice acting, particularly during the film's final, harrowing scene, is nothing short of phenomenal. The actress's raw performance pierces through the shadows, leaving you shaken and utterly heartbroken.

The film's pacing is deliberate (I think). The long stretches with the mice might seem slow to some, but for me, they offered a chance to catch my breath, a stark counterpoint to the emotional turmoil the film evokes. Each moment of respite was desperately needed, as survivor's guilt and a flood of memories threatened to overwhelm me. It took me several days to gather the courage to finish this 10-minute short film, a testament to its raw emotional power.

Vanni Mouse doesn't preach or sensationalise. It simply confronts you with a grim reality. While some viewers might find it challenging, I believe it's a vital piece of cinema, especially for those who haven't personally experienced such atrocities.

Though Vanni Mouse was released fifteen years ago, it still remains a chillingly relevant piece of cinema. The film serves as a harrowing record of a dark time, but it also acts as a stark reminder that atrocities like this continue to occur around the world.
