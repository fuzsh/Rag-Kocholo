(de)\n\nVanni Mouse (Tamil: வன்னி எலி) is a short film produced and directed by , a Sri Lankan Tamil from the diaspora. It won the best award in an international festival. It won the best film award in the fiction category in the nine-day 11th (ISIFF) in Dhaka 2010. Commenting on the award, Barrister S. J. Joseph of Eelavar Cine Arts Council, based in London, told TamilNet this was the first time a Sri Lankan Tamil artist had been awarded at an international film festival. \"As far as content is concerned, the film is against violence perpetrated in the name of national integrity. To convey this message, the director picked up a form, which is an interesting combination of wild life cinematography, surrealistic backdrop and realistic incident. A monotonous journey of some mice ends up in an unexpected revelation of a human tragedy. The approach is quite original for anti-war film,\" said the Jury Recitation during the announcement of the award. (en)\n\nrdfs:comment\n\nVanni Mouse ist ein Kurzfilm aus dem Jahr 2009.
