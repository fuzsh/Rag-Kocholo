The document discusses the earliest literature on Indian dance, the Natya Sastra by Bharata, which encompasses all artistic elements of theatre including dance, drama, music, and expression. It notes that while dance was originally part of drama in ancient India, there was no distinction between the arts. The Natya Sastra describes in detail the elements of Natya, including Nritta (dance), Abhinaya (expression), and music that together form the complete art form.",
