        "text": "A R Rahman and his Tamil projects in future A R Rahman and his Tamil projects in future\n\nTopic started by hi (@ 61.11.79.20) on Sat Dec 11 02:10:54 EST 2004.\n\nAll times in EST +10:30 for IST.\n\nA R Rahman is surely busy with many Hindi projects of International standards with Subash Ghai, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Rajkumar Santoshi. So how many Tamil films is he gonna take in future. His experiments are not being aplauded in Tamil. For eg: Aayitha Ezhuthu music appealed only to the urban mindset audience. New had nothing great and his E20U18, Udhaya, Parasuram showed carelessly composed tunes. Desam is a good album, but will the Tamil mass lap it up along with the movie? Swades and Kisna are really doing good business and are being critically acclaimed.\n\nSo, what are the projects Rahman will take in Tamil in future. He is doing K S Ravikumar's Ajith starrer Godfather, may be S J Surya's next and of course Mani Ratnam's next. Shankar has teamed up with Harris for now and no news from director Kathir. Rajeev Menon is also planning a Hindi venture. But there is a small scoop, Bollywood's favourite director Rajkumar Santoshi is planning a film in Tamil after directing 10 Hindi films. He is a Tamil lover and likes old Tamil tunes too. Ilayaraaja did the BGM for his Lajja. So, will ARR compose the music for Rajkumar Santoshi's Tamil film, as he has done Pukar, The Legend of Bhagat Singh for the Hindi director and also composed for his produced Priyan directed, Doli Sajakhe Rakhna.\n\nHis regional film interest seems to be low. What say???\n\nhttp://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2004/10/29/stories/2004102902960100.htm\n\nResponses:\n\nFrom: psdigitek (@ 203.187.245.178) on: Sat Dec 11 03:37:56 EST 2004\n\n'New' had nothing great in it? C'mon, I think the songs Thottal Poo Malarum and Sakkarai will feature in any top songs of 2004 list, not to mention the wonderful melody 'Amma'. IMHO, He had a huge gap from tamil films in 2001-02 years. Now he is starting to get back after AE and New. I agree with you that some of his projects aren't getting the public attention eg. Kangalal Kaidhu Sei which had amazing melodies but the movie was crap so the songs never picked up.\n\nFrom: sohan (@ 202.142.80.16) on: Sat Dec 11 07:50:58 EST 2004\n\nHe is doing 3 films with S J Surya - Anbulla Nanbane, Isai and Ezhumalai v/s Chitra\n\nFrom: MADDY (@ 203.94.218.15) on: Sat Dec 11 08:08:55 EST 2004\n\nthat's gr8 aint it???ARR shuld stop composing for Tamil films and he shuld place himself in Mumbai or london......imagine if Boys wud have been a hindi album, it wud have been the biggest hit of the year....here i have to haplessly convince ppl. of TN that it is a gud album even......ARR shuld give a big middle-finger salute to TN and leave from there, simply bcos they dunt deserve him....even if Sachin Tendulkar had been a tamilian he wud have been insulted the samwe way....thnk god he is a maharashtrian....\n\nppl. here, dunt tell me ARR's success is bcos of tamil ppl.....i wud never accept it.....it was northies who accepted him as one of the legends and a reincarnation of the Burmans......here ppl like subbudu and other worthless idiots put him down for IR's sons also....they r so cheap......arrey Ir is gr8 yaar but y do u lick his son's foot also...pathetic old b*stard....sh*t mannnnn if i cud meet ARR i wud beg him to come here.......\n\nFrom: Jacky (@ 61.1.202.165) on: Sat Dec 11 09:00:02 EST 2004\n\nhttp://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=13208728\n\nCool down dude!

I am back to my regular chores.\n\nAccording to sources close to the director, he is writing a script for a Tamil film for which he plans to start shoot by April 2005 with all new comers.\n\nFrom: God father (@ 210.210.7.6) on: Fri Dec 17 06:02:49 EST 2004\n\n\"here i have to haplessly convince ppl. of TN that it is a gud album even\" - No one convinced TN people when Roja and Bombay released. It had great acceptance b'caz of itz quality. If that is not the case with \"boys\", then the MD has to think what went wrong.\n\n\"ARR shuld give a big middle-finger salute to TN\" - Itz always good to resign before being dismissed.\n\nFrom: Sala (@ 62.84.181.183) on: Sun Dec 19 05:01:06 EST 2004\n\nI dont think ARR will leave TFM...though he is busy in national and international albums, its only TFM that brought him up and got him fame... I even remember ARR telling this in one of the interview...\n\nNo one will wish to leave their mother land and will neglect which bought them name and fame...\n\nAs ARR is busy at the moment, he is not able to commit himself for TFM...he will come back soon.. he always try something hard to give in TFM, you can see that, when Godfather and other movies he has commited...\n\nCome on guys, give ARR sometime with TFM...\n\nFrom: MADDY (@ 203.94.234.234) on: Sun Dec 19 06:42:51 EST 2004\n\nno, i personally feel ARR shuld come to Mumbai.....here, he will get the respect he deserves and he will find life pretty cool here and can relax more.....we adore him here......even though all r not his fans they know his value and they accept his gr8ness.......ARR shuld leave TFM but shuld not leave India.....that's the ultimatum.....come on guys, everyone will be happy if this happens, both IR fans and ARR fans and common man(of TN) too.....ARR, come to Mumbai-this is ur Swades.....\n\nFrom: Isaipriyasakhi (@ 141.7.2.14) on: Mon Dec 20 06:31:28 EST 2004\n\nARR said that his home is CHENNAI. Its not important where he lives or not. He started his career in Chennai and will stay there... Sorry Maddy, no chance for ur request. Just be his fan...and expect good music frm him in future. Desam songz r amazing! Very nice lyrics in Tamil!\n\nFrom: MusicLover (@ 216.127.68.137) on: Mon Dec 20 07:55:04 EST 2004\n\nMADDY MAD MAN,\n\nYour verbal violence against IR & his family is understandable. When one is burning inside, such will be the hatred. We all understand ARR didn't go anywhere after Roja. He stuck to MR,BR,Shankar,KB,Kathir and others he thought can give him success. You see, success will never be success when you don't have talent and rely on others to carry it. Success will be success when regardless of the movie or the director you still can compose soul stiring tunes and better still, people still listen after 25 years.\n\nLike I said, we all understand ARR didn't \"go\" anywhere after Roja. You call Bombay Dreams Mozartian? You call the soundtrack to Warriors of Heaven and Earth successful??...may be in heaven. How many of MR's films are successful after Roja? Compare that to how of MR's film are successful after Mouna Raagam? You dare compare a person who's Anakili to Viswa Thulasi is being talked about and listened all these years to a jingle composer? Please go rethink your brain. If that statement doesn't make sense then let it be....for it is enough for a MadMan.\n\nFrom: zz (@ 203.145.176.177) on: Mon Dec 20 08:00:51 EST 2004\n\nViswa Thulasi ya...mothama 100 cassettes viththurukkuma?...\n\nsorry..I don't actually take a dig at IR personally...but ML your comment made me laugh..my dig is at you not IR..\n\nSari karagattakaari ketteengala...super hit songs illa...top of the charts dhaan..\n\nBangalorela...music world fulla andha padalgal thaan....Forum(Bangalore) pakkam ponaal ore soundu.....sema kalakkal.....Top selling album of this year...saariii kovichikaadheenga...of this decade nu podaren.\n\nFrom: MusicLover (@ 216.127.68.137) on: Mon Dec 20 08:30:34 EST 2004\n\nBy trying to act smart by sarchaism is still not going to change the fact mentioned above.\n\nYou're still a kid.\n\nFrom: Guess Me (@ 202.83.34.0) on: Mon Dec 20 10:31:05 EST 2004\n\nMusiclover,\n\nwhat you have mentioned are hardly facts - those are the words of a fanatic who knows ARR's arrival marked the end of IR era.\n\nARR didnt go anywhere after Roja? What abt his 4 National Awards, compared to IR's 3? And where did this Raja go after Annakili? After all he is a tamil composer who composes for South Indian languages alone, whereas ARR is the most successful South Indian composer in Hindi. And who talks abt Vishwathulasi? May be the fans alone. Like zz said not even hundred cassettes (who wud care to buy wasting money on CD) would be sold.\n\nAnd I dont care if Warriors of Heaven and Earth was not successful. The point is the songs of WOHE never sounds like the composition of a South Indian. ARR used traditional chinese instruments bring out such an excellent composition.\n\nImagine what wud have happened if IR composed WOHE. When an emotional scene comes, all you wud hear in the bgm would be some violin crap. And when action comes, you wud hear drums alone. And when a heroic scene comes, there wud be a saxophone music. Thats all, and that was what IR made the tamils believe bgm is, until the arrival of ARR.\n\nNow dont even dare compare ARR to IR.\n\nFrom: MADDY (@ 203.94.217.231) on: Mon Dec 20 14:55:35 EST 2004\n\nMusic lover, get ur facts rite......we respect IR and his family as he is a gr8 man......now u guys learn respect.......u learn to post decently with sense......u call me MAD,zz a kid just bcos we like ARR....very bad....i felt pained to see such reaction........wat i was telling is that ARR doesen't suite TAMIL thinking so he needs to come to a more cosmopolitan environment.......and that's all.....i never criticise IR and his family......i do criticise IR's jaldraas like subbudu kezhava,Kamal hassan.......\n\nFrom: zz (@ 203.145.176.177) on: Tue Dec 21 07:26:05 EST 2004\n\nMaddy and Gme...never mind...\n\nI did not take it seriously what ML said....\n\nAs maddy has put it...we have respect for IR but his jalra's hatred towards ARR drive most of Non-IR bashing- ARR fans furious.\n\nFrom: zz (@ 203.145.176.177) on: Tue Dec 21 07:28:34 EST 2004\n\nOne doubtuuu..\n\nIs this MusicLover...the ever famous MUSICLOVER whose keyboards caps lock key got stuck up during the manufacturing state itself..\n\nHey ML are you the same...ML...\n\nhaaha...avanaaa neeyii...vantaanyaa....vantaanyaa.\n\nNOM:))))\n\nFrom: Guess Me (@ 202.83.35.226) on: Tue Dec 21 10:59:04 EST 2004\n\nYes zz, I also have respect for IR.
