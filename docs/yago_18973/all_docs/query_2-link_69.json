        "text": "Uncouth: You make an excellent point.\n\nFirstly, whoever gave birth to the notion that loving someone and “getting” that dream girl are one and the same?\n\nOne can only truly get his dream girl once he marries her.\n\nTake my case study for instance. I come in Top 20 in academics. Two friends of mine one who is on the borderline of being average and the other well below average.\n\nBut they are committed. In the sense they are in love. I am in 12th for that matter and my friends too.\n\nThe below average guy is a Muslim and the one he loves isn’t.\n\nThere’s a sense of uncertainty looming large in this kind of love. Would my friends go on to marry the ones they love now? That is something future can answer.\n\nOn the other hand naa inga comment panninu theriyuren. I haven’t really tried but I make my point.\n\nClearly in this age of puberty and past it, love is about hearts not brains. Its about personality and charm than economy.\n\nThis kind of so called love is what is being shown in films of Dhanush.\n\nAnd as for stalking, somebody gave an excellent point in another thread of similar nature pertaining to stalking being a cultural phenomenon.\n\nIn a country like India and especially in Tamil nadu, I myself cannot but fear being judged when I talk to a girl in public. I have first hand experience on it too if anyone would need it.\n\nIn Schools too save for a few, talking with girls is a taboo.\n\nDhanush in his so called stalker movies plays a school boy or at max a college guy. In this, hearts come into play rather than brains.\n\nAnd the whole plot of such so called stalker movies is about getting an yes and may be the family’s opposition. In short, the first communion of hearts is the main crux of the whole film.\n\nOnce in love, there’s that relationship that must stand the test of time for a few years. There is nagging, breaking up, cajoling and all that stuff.\n\nThen there is the ultimate test of conveying the wish to get married and then comes into play the real life. Occupation, salary, all comes at that time.\n\nIf as BR says, if a computer engineer and a doctor fall in love, it is not because they are engineer and a doctor. It is because they like each other. Their occupation just happens to be a decent one so the perception makes us thing and preach, “their real life matters for them” kind of stuff.\n\nTo make myself even clear, Padikkadhavan could very well have a sequel, Padichchavan, wherein Tamanna could set her terms that Dhanush should be in such and such position if they were to take the relationships forward.\n\nSensible directors know what I am trying to convey to a section of guys in here. In 3, which happens to be one of those rare Dhanushs so called stalker movies wherein he gets married too, we are shown that he wants to lead a happy life and gets a flat. He is shown to be a working husband too.\n\nTake for the instance, Raanjhanaa. All that so called stalking is done and dusted. But Zoya was never his. Was she? Initially she might have reciprocated, but she found someone better. Life is as such.\n\nAnd only in Padikkadhavan is Dhanush a loser. In other so called stalker films of his he is a school going or college going guy even if it isn’t made explicit. Which explains why he hasn’t an occupation as yet.\n\nIt would then be foolish to term him loser because the film has not portrayed him so. His so called stalker films showed the first love that brews in young minds.\n\nIt never asserted it would be their last or the ever lasting one. So forget about getting the dream girl.\n\nWhat happens is what you get. Naadhari pasanga ella girlfriend vechu thiriyuraanunga. So it is no exaggeration. Most of them don’t last long. Dhanushs so called stalker movies too haven’t ended on the note of having them being married, have they? Because only after marrying do you truly “get” your dream girl.\n\nIt just so happens that MR, GVMs stories revolve around working class. That’s about it.\n\nSegregation of working class stalking and a mere infatuation painted as love that has so much uncertainty in it is like telling enaku vandha ratham unaku vandha takkali chatni.\n\nIn such turn of events I fail to grasp how this IS NOT elitist nature into play?\n\nIn Raanjhanaa it was sheer perseverance though the means might have been “following”, in Padikkadhavan it was anything but stalking that led her to fall for him. In 3, once Janani tells him not to follow, Ram doesn’t. How’s that for a consent or respecting a woman’s words?\n\nEven in Raanjhanaa Dhanush only follows her the first time. She asks him to come daily and get slaps. It is upon her calling that Dhanush goes. Where is the stalking?!\n\nIn Thangamagan, Amy falsely accuses of Dhanush stalking him though their meeting is rather circumstantial, and only then Dhanush follows her and informs her before he does. What chivalry!\n\nAlso Samanthas character was so discussed in here about how they portray in bad light about women how unreal sort of stuff but no one noticed equally modern raring Amy. That’s totally another matter though.\n\nClearly from my observations, following someone alone has never led to the blossoming of love in Dhanush’s case. Also if someone is ears, I will further tell the legends of Thirumangalam, Madurai, wherein girls fell in love with guys when the girls brother beat him black and blue for loving her and he receiving those punches for her sake evokes pity in her and they start loving. Enna kaadhal da saamy. This kind of love may not last long, but is it a sin to portray this in a film?\n\nWould the film maker be charged of planting the idea that getting beaten black and blue will make a girl love you?\n\nWait a second. Film makers are never really blamed here. So I guess the hero would be. And what about the cultural phenomenon? Ah, that shit ain’t exist in here.\n\nAmit, I thought – in the stalking thread – we had made some dent in your thinking about what exactly constitutes stalking, when you admitted to thinking that girls would respond the way heroines do on screen.\n\nNow, with your full-on defence of what Dhanush does not being stalking, I’m not so sure. I haven’t watched the other films you reference, so I will stick to the one I have watched.\n\nDisclaimer: I like Dhanush’s acting in the film; I thought he was brilliant in the role. The character, however, made me pause: yes, as BR points out, the character is a stalker. Where I will part ways with BR is that the behaviour is not identified as stalking, and was in fact, defended as the way small-town youth behave. [Cue cinema-reflecting-life-reflecting-cinema.]\n\nYour defence plays out when they are school children – she is both attracted to, and repelled by his ‘love’ for her. So 15 slaps later, she hugs him. But when he realises that she is not in ‘love’ with him, he threatens to slit his wrist, and in fact, does so as well, frightening a teenager into ‘accepting’ his ‘love’. [There’s a reason the ‘love’ is in quotes, so bear with me.] Her parents send her away.\n\nYears later, when she returns, he’s still pining for her – or his ideal of her – while she’s even forgotten who he is. When he insists that he loves her and that she loves him (they are on the scooter), she tells him flatly that she has no such feelings for him. So he has to punish her – to the extent that he exposes her boyfriend as a Hindu, leading to him being murdered. You think this is ‘LOVE’? You can defend this behaviour? You can defend what he does, says, as something that is just a portrayal of infatuation? And you bring in economic class here? Whether that woman in this instance was upper class or of his same economic class has no bearing on the fact that his behaviour was egregious. Period.\n\nMy problem is not with showing the uncertainty of love, or indeed, the first flush of attraction, infatuation, whatever. It is when, the male character (insert hero of your choice) insists upon teaching the female character about the ‘purity of his love’, by importuning her against her consent to the point where he ‘wins’ her.\n\nAs for your argument that it is not ‘winning’ unless Dhanush (for example) is shown ‘marrying’ her, that’s laughable. It’s very rarely in our films that we get the full arc of a relationship from the courtship to marriage. I think it was Alaipayuthey, which first showed what happens ‘after the happily ever after’.\n\nBut who, in heavens’ name, told you that marriage has to be the be-all and end-all of relationships? So, if it doesn’t culminate in a marriage, then it cannot be love? It cannot be a committed, successful relationship?\n\nWhat bothers me here is not your fandom of Dhanush. It is that nothing that has been discussed on these pages, in previous posts/threads, has made any difference in the way you think about man-woman relationships. That is disheartening to me because this is the generation we are trying to reach through these discussions/petitions; this is the generation that has to bring about the change we are hoping will evolve. But I see that fandom supersedes any thought about the other part of the equation – the girl. And her consent.\n\nNo time to address individual points here, but in general:\n\nRegarding the “undeserved personal hatred” targeted at SK, the blurring lines between the professional and personal is often the effect of deliberate manipulation and targetted image-building by stars themselves so that a gullible public that swallows all the PR spin dished out about the ‘real life virtues’ of the star may then use it as a reason for adulation where there is no sufficient cause to cheer an actor’s professional achievements or acting prowess. Classic case in point: Ajith. While recognizing his severe limitations as an actor, he has invested a lot of effort into brand-building with his ‘acts of goodness’ (the veracity of which I don’t question now, for that’s not the debate here). Following the same template, being “mentor-less” and “not from a film family” kind of background, SK has gone on to build a very smart brand of himself, mainly targetted at children and teens, with the ‘family audience’ thrown in for good measure. When a person thus markets himself as a product, then what gets criticised is the brand for what it sells by association. The SK brand has been peddling misogyny and stalking for a good while now, with the person SK adding his gems of wisdom in his interviews to show selective virtue-signaling. That selective virtue-signaling has always been the stock-in-trade of Tamil cinema heroes, right from MGR. The reason it is being called out now is because of the proportion. MGR and Rajini might have used objectification and casual misogyny as one of the ingredients of their many-headed monster of masala entertainment, but SK’s films (and this one in particular) relies disproportionately on it. Also, the notion that with passing years, we need to push for being a little more progressive and not recede into caveman times.\n\nAs for those who still justify stalking, thank you very much. You are the reason we live in fear all our lives. May you remain blissfully unaware of the kind of mental-health crisis you are triggering in a substantial percentage of half the world’s population.\n\nAs for those take the ‘elitist’/class stick to beat us up with, I have seen through the likes of you in the last few months. In a substantial portion of these ‘oh-that’s-so-classist’ critics, I only see thinly-veiled MRA pack behaviour – to basically stand behind men (apparently across class barriers) in an effort to silence the discourse on gender by diversionism. Gender problems are REAL, and so are class problems, but pitting one against the other (especially when I see it done by privileged males) is just a devious trick to get women who raise their voice to shut up. Since YOU rake up the class question with respect to Tamil cinema, please go on and name how many times you have voiced out against women of an underprivileged class being underrepresented or misrepresented in Tamil cinema. If you can’t recall having done that enough, SHUT UP.\n\n****Addressed to women who really feel underrepresented or victimised by the fairness myth the film industry is peddling or by the way your aspirations are not given a voice, please speak up more! Don’t let privileged males hog the space with their all-men theories of class.\n\n@uncouthvillager: but then sensible feminist is an oxymoron😛\n\nPutting a smiley at the end of an offensive statement does not make it less offensive.\n\nSo, it eventually boils down to one thing – dark skinned/vela vettityilla hero pursuing white skinned/Pizza Hut heroine, a class thing😀.\n\nPlease explain to me why all the heroines these men chase are ‘fair-skinned/Pizza Hut’. Or why all the men who do the chasing are dark-skinned louts who boast about their lack of education? When film-makers make the ‘fair-skined/ Pizza Hut heroine’ an aspirational fruit, that is not classist? In a sort of ‘Show that rich b!tch her place in the world’? But pointing it out make us classist? Really? (I also pointed out in an earlier comment that it’s very rarely that the stalker is upper-class/fair skinned/educated himself, and when he is, he’s usually the villain; he not only does not get the girl, but is also punished at the hands of the hero – who does precisely the same thing.)\n\n@Arun:\n\nUnless the change starts from with in the minds of woman who are very much the heart of THE society, their is no point in expressing frustration in the forum or blaming the actors or blaming male fantasy. Period.\n\nWell, how do you want that change to start? Unless this topic is pulled out of the darkness and examined, unless it is discussed and debated, unless we can change even one mind by our arguments, what hope do we have? If we say, it’s no use expressing our frustrations in this forum (or anywhere else), or blaming male actors for choosing roles they know are insane in present context, or trying to point out to impressionable males that their fantasies are just that – fantasies, then what do you suggest we do?\n\nHow do we change a woman’s mindset and get her to protest, when the next thing she knows is that she’s getting raped or murdered?\n\n@Billa: Say, X =boy, Y= girl. X is interested in Y. Y is interested in X. X admits his interest. Y admits her interest, privately by a smile or a wink or whatever signal ($). [emphasis mine]\n\nBilla – that, right there, is the whole crux of what we are screaming about, no? ‘Y admits her interest. There, right in front of you, man, is the whole point – she has consented to the ‘mating ritual’. What happens when Y does not admit interest, and in fact, says ‘No’?\n\nWe are talking about stalking – which is a whole different ball game; when the man pursues the woman despite her saying ‘No’; the man believing that because his love is ‘pure’ (barf!), the woman has to consent to a relationship with him; that if she doesn’t, he’s allowed to throw acid on her face, or abduct her and keep her confined until she consents, or even murder her, like the unfortunate young women who have lost their lives in these past few months.\n\n@Sifter, thank you.\n\n@Iswarya: I can see why you are burnt out. It’s frustrating to not be heard, or even mocked for being a ‘feminist’. Thank you for fighting the good fight.\n\nNow that I’ve successfully lost my temper, let me hasten to remember that I was at least brought up to be a lady, and apologise for being intemperate.\n\nArun, I apologise for that nasty comment. You just bore the brunt of my exasperation. It was not personal even though your comment triggered that response.\n\nLet me try and address your comment in a proper manner:\n\nNot even one comment says anything about the word Stalking or the way SK treats woman in the movies..\n\nYou don’t see the irony in saying that no one commented about stalking before?\n\nWhen we do talk about stalking, we are asked ‘Why didn’t you protest before?’ Well, for various reasons. And we are protesting now, aren’t we? But are we being heard? Or are we being dismissed for not having protested before? Shouted down for being ‘feminist’ and therefore not sensible?\n\nThe point is no body cared anything so far and suddenly Remo has opened their eyes.\n\nYou know that, how? We women have always protested. You’re only hearing it now because the voices are now getting too loud to dismiss as ’emotional’. You’re hearing it now because real-life situations are being exacerbated by the normalisation of this behaviour. Try telling the families of the young women who were killed that they are being ’emotional’.\n\nbut I see he is being singled out here unfairly..\n\nSivakarthikeyan is being picked on here because it under a review of his film that this topic came to be discussed. Despite that, many comments referenced Dhanush as well, so much so Amit felt he had to defend his hero by minimising what women feel about the stalking.\n\nI am not a Tamilian; I don’t give a damn whether SK is heir apparent, star kid or outsider. Insert any hero of your choice here, from any language, who’s built his brand up by regularly stalking women in the name of love, and I will say the same things I did here. It is the content, the behaviour and the defence of it that I am protesting.\n\n[SK is also being picked on because, tone-deaf that he is, he had to defend his stalking as ‘pure love’ because he ‘always marries the women he stalks’. The man actually thinks he’s doing us a favour.]\n\nKamal in his early career was singing “Kattai vandi Kattai vandi”, “Nethu Rathiri Yamma”..\n\nNo one is excusing Kamal or Rajini or MGR or Sivaji or whoever, for what they did. Those films have come and gone in an era where most of us commenting were little kids. If Kamal did a movie right now where he stalked a heroine against her will, forcing her to ‘fall in love’ with him, he would be crucified – and rightly so.\n\nAlso, pointing out that someone was ‘worse’ does not negate your hero’s responsibility. That’s a kindergartner’s response. In today’s context, films like these have a wider reach through the Internet and television as well as theatres, and it cannot be said often enough or loud enough that these sort of portrayals must stop.\n\nwould have shown similar outrage, wrath on this movie, then it would have raised huge huge awareness among the general public and Film makers would have made a pause before they show or say anything stupid on the screen..\n\nAnd so now, when we are outraged, and are trying to raise public awareness among the general public and struggling to ‘get film-makers to pause before they show anything stupid on screen’, you are castigating us for raising our voice and protesting now when [you claim] we didn’t before.\n\nCan you not see how dismissive this is, of our experiences, our voices, our struggle to be accepted on an equal footing?\n\nFeminism is not a bad word, guys. It is only a call for equality for half the world’s population. Don’t use it as a pejorative.\n\nAs for women who proudly claim not to be feminist [thereby tinging the word with negative connotations], please remember that if it weren’t for the feminists who fought for your right to be heard, you wouldn’t be able to voice this opinion today. You wouldn’t be doing half the things you are able to do, today, if it weren’t for the brave women [and men] at the vanguard of the feminist movement.\n\nStalking should not be defended in any form in any kind of film.\n\nBR: That was a far more convincing comment which I too agree upon. Instead of being a trope upon which the plot should have its base, the trope becomes the plot which becomes a bit of a problem.\n\nQuoting (1.) but since I saw defence, I countered along the same lines.\n\nMaha: It would be an exciting prospect but not really on the lines that you are thinking. And in trying to count your eggs too early don’t end up having an egg on your face.\n\nAnu: In the other thread, I was thinking stalking was harmless. It is not to be now. I stand by the fact that I still consider stalking to be bad. Consent is important.\n\nAlso see (1.) which was defended though in some class and thrashed in another. That’s wherein lies the cause for my comment.\n\nSumma summa inga defend pannala.\n\nAnd Raanjhanaa. Why, she could have let him bleed. He wouldn’t have gone further to slit his throat. Even if he had, it would be a happy death of a stalker.\n\nAn empowered woman should have no compunction of his being hurt if she had no place for him in his heart, no? Sympathy is okay when he does it in front of her eyes, regardless of what\n\nshe feels for him or if she feels at all. But I do have the ominous feeling that someone or the other would come up with “See, woman are still responsible, men aren’t” kind of thing.\n\nGod save me if someone indeed turns up!\n\nNonetheless, you can very well see how she caresses him over his chest that is so so obviously suggestive of what she feels for him, until of course she finds him to be Hindu.\n\nThen we see a hint of resentment. Then we see the split. His being Hindu was the singular reason for her to leave him and I see no reason why Dhanush’s action of\n\nrevealing Abhay’s religion is justifiable.\n\nNow, if you expect him to keep mum along the lines of “Oh, my love! Wherever, with whomever you be with, thou shalt only experience true delight and nothing else”, then sorry\n\narguing further is out of my bounds and that you truly haven’t felt what Dhanush would have.\n\nAs for Marriage, how could I be so careless knowing how it would be perceived? Okay. Marriage is the first, significant, lawful step in getting a dream girl. It is a sign that law recognises and the society too that you are hers and she is yours. I don’t want to discuss infidelity, extra marital, cuckoldery, adultery stuff now.\n\nIf it cannot culminate in marriage, is it not love? It is. But a largely uncertain one which comes in the age of around 20 whose age group Dhanush plays.\n\nAlso, if someone falls in love with me, then elopes with other or marries another, what am I? A loser.\n\nNow were she to marry me and then elope or marry another, I can file a lawsuit for the law sees her to be mine. There’s a sense that she will be mine alone, which is what I would mean when I say I got a girl.\n\nThis is what I had taken much pains to explain in my previous comment. That the movie only shows the part of getting an yes for the first immature love. Nothing more.\n\nHonest Raj: This latest definition of stalking is surely I can thoroughly understand. Thanks BR! Will look it up.\n\nAs for Elitists being called Elitists: Here’s the usual scenario.\n\nA: This film is so crap and shows stalking!\n\nB: May be, but you know of that A centre film? I think that too was like it in some ways.\n\nA: Whoa! That’s risible. justifies\n\nB: Ah, I think I can justify it too as in justifies\n\nA How misogynistic of you to defend such a film??\n\nA1: Me thinks you are right. Misogynistic indeed.\n\nB: But… but…\n\nB feels like he is been invited to debate with Arnab Goswami who justifies himself and when B does it he is shut stop by labelling B.\n\nAlso have to agree with someone who said SK should do one with GVM. Simbu has done outrageously misogynistic stuff in almost every film that he may well be the poster boy of misogynistic hero but see the effect of GVM! Simbu has become as pure as the pope!\n\nLet there be no defending on any films of any nature where stalking is depicted in any manner.\n\nTwo strange people ending up together in a train with absolute lack of logic rechristened as chance and the hero wantingly venturing to be with her are one and the same, portrayal differing; end result being the same.\n\nAlso when did middle class become under privileged? Also Amma Kanakku comes to mind which is representational of underprivileged women though I will not equate middle class to underprivileged. And what irony of its producer?\n\nRahini: Ayoo avlola yosikkadhinga. I said I haven’t tried. I have got proposalS for that matter. It was to highlight that love at this stage is quite immature in the sense they don’t care of academic which will bear a mark on their future, that is they are not too worryful of real lives as yet.\n\nP.S\n\nAlso fair ladies being the heroines, who are the dark skinned heroines? Aishwarya Rajesh perhaps. It is not in the wildest dreams of the director to show a low class hunting for high class.\n\nIt is just that all heroines look like high class are all fair skinned and will attract eye balls which is good for BO. That’s about it.\n\nAnd people calling SK, Donald Trump, Donald Trumps are cynical creatures and a rarity. What’s not a rarity is the American citizens akin to our audience which helps in paving way for more such Donald Trumps with glee and pomp. SK is definitely not to be blamed. He only caters to the needs of the people.\n\nThe needs of the people must change. If he tries to change what people need, then for sure, people will change him, as in replace him with who gives them their stuff. And SK wouldn’t be foolish enough to disregard such love and fandom from people.\n\nA negligible criticism by some 100 people in this blog is unnoticable to him.\n\nWhen people change, films change.\n\nWhy, she could have let him bleed. He wouldn’t have gone further to slit his throat. Even if he had, it would be a happy death of a stalker.\n\nAn empowered woman should have no compunction of his being hurt if she had no place for him in his heart, no? Sympathy is okay when he does it in front of her eyes, regardless of what\n\nshe feels for him or if she feels at all. But I do have the ominous feeling that someone or the other would come up with “See, woman are still responsible, men aren’t” kind of thing.\n\nGod save me if someone indeed turns up!\n\nHave you been responsible for another human being hurting himself fatally? He doesn’t have to slit his throat for him to die. In case you didn’t know, cut the vein in your wrist and you will bleed to death. No decent human being will want to stand by and allow that.\n\nSecondly, this is again the problem – women are conditioned to believe that everything is their fault. When they are raped, the first question is what did you do? Followed by where did you go? What were you wearing?\n\nIn such a scenario, a woman feels trapped. Even an empowered woman will think twice in a society that first blames the victim. Never mind. Defend Dhanush’s character, because … Dhanush.\n\ncan file a lawsuit for the law sees her to be mine. There’s a sense that she will be mine alone, which is what I would mean when I say I got a girl.\n\nGod in heaven, boy! No, she is NOT YOURS. She is not property. If she leaves you and elopes with another man, then she never was yours, legally or morally or romantically. You can file a law suit for adultery, yes. Absolutely. But the law cannot force her to return to you because you married her! Damn it! Marriage does not make me my husband’s property.\n\nAnd of course, if not marriage, you can only think in terms of adultery, extra marital affairs, cuckoldry. You cannot conceive a relationship where a man and woman may love each other deeply, live together in a commited relationship and not get a stamp of legal approval? Your imagination is very, very limited then.\n\nThat the movie only shows the part of getting an yes for the first immature love. Nothing more.\n\nPlease take it from us that immature or mature, this is NOT the way to show love. The girl you love does not become yours because you decided upon seeing her that you love her. It becomes love only when she returns your affections and responds to your overtures. Smiling at you, laughing with you, talking with you does NOT signify romantic interest all the time. We women can actually smile and laugh and talk with male friends the same way we talk with our female friends. We are not in love with them either.\n\nTwo strange people ending up together in a train with absolute lack of logic rechristened as chance and the hero wantingly venturing to be with her are one and the same, portrayal differing; end result being the same.\n\nI don’t know who you are talking about here, but I haven’t said anything of the sort. B) If the hero and heroine meet in a train, and there is a mutual attraction which persuades the hero to go look up the heroine, that does not come under the purview of stalking. We are talking about consent. The women’s consent. Which is very important. No one gets to decide for me whether I should fall in love with them or not. I reserve the right to say ‘No’ to someone who loves me.. I also reserve the right to say ‘Yes’ if need be. You don’t get to decide for me who I should say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to.\n\nt is not in the wildest dreams of the director to show a low class hunting for high class.\n\nIt is just that all heroines look like high class are all fair skinned and will attract eye balls which is good for BO. That’s about it.\n\nReally? Then explain why all these fair-skinned heroines are usually educated and wealthy, while the hero is usually not as educated, not as wealthy, not… ?\n\nYou know the wildest dreams of the directors? I don’t. But I do know what I see on screen is usually some porukki who teaches the rich girl how to be a ‘nalla ponnu’. Who slaps her ‘thimiru’ out of her; who stalks her despite her being engaged/ in a relationship/ saying No [most importantly]. And in the end, the woman always has to be tamed.\n\nI don’t think you understand. Or you deliberately won’t understand when I, and several other women in this thread and in the previous one tell you what we women feel, what we are made to feel. It feels like hitting my head against a stone wall, hoping the stone wall will eventually break.\n\nI hate invoking the ‘Daughter/sister theory’ but if that is the only way it will get to you: think, if you can – think it is your sister engaged to be married; she’s educated, capable, and is happy with her fiance. And then some random guy decides he is in love with her; stalks her coming and going; lies to her at any given opportunity; threatens to harm her, himself if she doesn’t marry him… but insists that his love is ‘pure’ and that, after all, he wants to marry her and ‘make her his’ – you will stand by and marry her off to him, I suppose? And if you don’t, you won’t mind him abducting her, confining her until she agrees to marry him? After all, it is a legal stamp, no?\n\nYou know what? I give up.\n\nI’m beginning to understand Iswarya’s depression now. Because you, Amit, and all the other apologists for this behaviour because it involves your favourite heroes, are doing yourselves and the women in your life – present and future – a huge disservice.\n\nI’ve already hogged BR’s comment space in spades. My sincere apologies, BR.\n\narun: Just because the words “stalking” or “misogyny” aren’t there in a review, it doesn’t mean the review doesn’t refer to them. Read this sarcastic passage from my Rajini Murugan review:\n\nHe sets up a tea stall opposite the house of a girl (Keerthy Suresh) who hates him – because, in Tamil cinema, when she says no, she’s really saying yes, yes, yes, oh baby, yes. This is how you know Sivakarthikeyan is some kind of star. Imagine how you’d have reacted to this character had he been played by, say, SJ Suryah.\n\nOthers: Can we try to look beyond the argument that “if you did not call this out in a film made in 1991 (or 1988 or 2005 or whatever), then why do this now”? This is like assuming that the German people were silent about Hitler in the 1930s/40s, so they’d behave the same way now, and if they protest, then we should remind them of how they stayed silent then.\n\nTwo, VTV is not stalking. The girl doesn’t say no. The hormonal moment on the train clarifies everything. You may not have liked the scene — that’s a different thing. But they talk. They talk all night. They become friends. They find mutual attraction. Then the kiss happens. Which she does not exactly mind… That’s a different kind of situation.\n\nThe boy has got a signal. He understands the girl is interested, yet something’s keeping her away. So the story is about that. It’s not about “I know she does not like me, but if I keep at it, she will succumb and I’ll get this chick.” (I hated Minnale; I’m talking about the more recent GVM films, not that one-off.)\n\nNo one’s calling for a ban on these situations being depicted in films. The outrage (if you want to call it that) is when no psychological detailing is brought to bear upon this kind of situation, when the girl is just a pawn/plaything in the hero’s mind…\n\nThree, we need to consider the general milieu of the film, the general sensibility of the filmmaker. Is it just about the situation? Then okay, maybe that’s just the story. Like Sethu. Like Raanjhanaa.\n\nBut if you can make out there’s something deeper — say, the girls being referred to as “figure-u” or “kattai,” or boobs being drawn in the air, or consistent “other-ing” dialogues like “girls are like this only, girls are like that only… we guys are always the wronged party machi”…\n\nDo you seriously not see the difference?\n\nThree, the whole job thing I spoke about earlier isn’t just to say only engineers or doctors can dream of getting the girl. That is SO not the point. The point is about having other dreams/aspirations as well, about being a well-rounded person, about doing something with your life that the girl can also respect…\n\nThese films are about a loser who wants NOTHING but getting the girl. He won’t do anything with his life. Not make any effort to improve his lot. And yet, the audience walks away from the feeling that “poor chap, after all the effort he put into chasing her, I’m glad he got the girl finally…”\n\nAgain, is it so hard to see the difference?\n\nAmit: Allow me to be rude here, but you have this tendency of commenting on “subjects” in which you are completely uneducated (one of the problems in with “cinema”, and for that matter art, in India is that because it is freely available to everyone, people who have no understand of the art in question, start believing that they have the right to offer “serious” opinions on it). You have exposed your complete lack of knowledge (or experience) in this regard (the topics being discussed- stalking et al) and yet you are defending your opinions rather dogmatically (this inspite of the fact that Iswarya, Rahini and Anu have patiently explained their arguments to you).\n\nAmit, this is not about you “opposing” Iswarya’s views. This is about simply not knowing what one is talking about, and hence coming across like an idiot while doing so. The least you can do Amit is shut up. Like Olemisstarana, I am also giving you the benefit of the doubt here. But if you continue in the same vein, people will stop tolerating the sort of drivel you are regularly coming up with in the name of opinion. I don’t start debating with Anu and Iswarya on feminism simply because I don’t know enough about the subject. The best thing I can do is to listen to them and try and learn from them, not offer my nuggets of wisdom. I know this sounds incredibly self-serving, but this is what it is. And Amit, as far you are concerned, I see that offering completely uninformed opinions is not just limited to this particular topic, but also to films. You are making short-films, you want to make a career in the movies and you don’t even know what a “trope” (in the context of cinema) means (I say this as someone who actually liked your film. But I find it more than a little offensive when people like you, who don’t even know the most basic things about cinema, start complaining that the system/society is not giving them enough “opportunities” to get into cinema).\n\nYour entire comment on Thodari thread is beyond ridiculous (do you even know what an offbeat film means?!). Much of what you are saying here actually comes under “bad manners”. I am not trying to gag you, but one should have some amount of humility while talking about things in which one doesn’t have any serious knowlege (take someone like BR. His is clearly a very informed voice when it comes to films. And yet when he encounters a film in a lnguage he doesn’t understand, he is quick to admit that if something is not working for him in the film, it might because it is his inability to get the context becuase of the linguistic/cultural barrier. Very few Indian critics have this sort of humility. Then again they are not too many Baradwaj Rangans.).\n\nAnd it’s one thing to talk about films this way, quite another when it comes to discussing something as serious as stalking. Very quickly you are becoming the kind of commenter whose comments I would have to avoid like I would avoid plague. Anyway, don’t bother about what I am saying, but do listen to someone like Olemisstarana because not only is she a top-notch commenter, but also because her opinion is clearly coming from a very honest place.\n\nUncouth – BR pointed out that the review, in fact, had a comment about the behaviour? Two, we are defining stalking for you – even legally, stalking is a course of conduct directed at a specific person that involves repeated (two or more occasions) visual or physical proximity, nonconsensual communication, or verbal, written, or implied threats, or a combination thereof, that would cause a reasonable person fear.”\n\nWhat part of consensual do you not understand?\n\nIn the other films that people are discussing nuances, they are pointing out that there is a measure of consent – non-verbal, perhaps, but it is there. Which removes the behaviour from ‘stalking’ to ‘pursuing an interest’. Was there any of these films in which the hero continues to treat the woman as if her consent is not required, or even important? I will call that out as well.\n\nThis happened to be on the Remo thread, so I referenced this film. The petition that Iswarya cited is calling out all films that glorify this behaviour. Not just Remo. We are using this film as an example. That’s all.\n\nAnd you seriously compared taking a sick child to a doctor and watching a film as equivalent? Okay, then, but your analogy is seriously flawed. If it had been that Y was penalised for taking his sick spouse/parent/dog/himself to a doctor, yes, it is discriminatory. Otherwise, you’re comparing apples to oranges.\n\nthen why are the feminists here ignoring the fact that BR casually dismisses off instances in MR films as “not stalking”\n\nYou see, ‘feminists’ are capable of seeing nuance just as well as non-feminists. I will take every film on a case-by-case benefit, and I doubt any of us here are ignoring stalking because ‘class’. If a film is willing to show the nuance – either by showing the woman’s consent (verbal or non-verbal), or by showing her horror/fear at being stalked, or is a film from the stalker’s POV (as in Guna) where a backstory establishes why the hero behaves the way he does, and how that particular female character reacts to that particular male character – I may not like the film, but I will accept the filmmaker’s right to tell his story the way he sees fit.\n\nOn the other hand, when hero-stalking-heroine-because-pure-love is a lazy detail mined for maximum effect (cue snappy song/taming-the-shrew/showing-women-their-place), and is not so much a plot device but a general pandering to what ‘good’ women must be like, and how she should behave – adakkama othukkama – and how beautiful girls shouldn’t have ‘thimiru’ and how they should accept the boy because he ‘did soooo much to woo her’ – yes, I do have a problem with that. So should any decent person.\n\nstalking in cinema is justified? That is plain weird and hardly any “NUANCE”.\n\nNo. It is not ‘justified’. But neither is it glorified. Nor normalised. It is not shown as the ‘Get a girl – 10 easy lessons’. In Guna, for instance, the man is mentally ill. You show it as abnormal: not the norm. But in films like Remo (for example), this is the trope. You like a girl, you stalk her whether she even knows you exist or not, and then, of course, she will fall in love with you.\n\nIn Alaipayuthe, I don’t understand what your question is.\n\nThat story was about Madhavan pursuing Shalini after she smiles at him, and expresses her interest/non-verbal consent. It was about what happens after the ‘happily ever after’.\n\nIt appears that you’re asking what if this didn’t happen? Why didn’t the director show what would have happened if…?\n\nNow, if it was about what Madhavan would have done if Shalini had rejected his advances, that would have been a different movie altogether, no? Or do you want the director to posit all the different ways one scenario would have played out? I’m sure there are films like that out there.\n\nMinnale, on the other hand, was a stalker movie, and i have no hesitation in calling it that. So will I call out any other movie, any other hero where this practice is glorified as the way to a woman’s heart.\n\nAnd if you cannot understand those nuances, then I’m afraid I can’t explain it any further.\n\nThis is seriously absurd. No one who is fighting for the women here is willing to fight against class discrimination.\n\nSo the only reason we are yelling ‘stalking’ is because the men are from the lower class. Is that what you’re saying? Therefore: class discrimination. What do you want women to do, ayya? Say ‘yes’ to any guy – irrespective of whether she likes him or not – because if she doesn’t, she’s discriminating against him because of his class? .\n\nAnd again: If all the heroes are uneducated jobless youth, and all the heroines who are being taught the error of their ways are beautiful fair-skinned damsels who are wealthy and educated, isn’t that a sort of reverse class discrimination? Sort of ‘Let’s show these wealthy educated b—! their place’? Again, if a rich guy was shown stalking, he is almost always the villain. In all these stalking-as-romance films, the rich girl’s equally rich BF/fiance is always bad. Not class discrimination on the part of the story writer/director? No? Class discrimination only works one way?\n\nFor me, personally [and I warrant, for other women here as well], I don’t give a damn if the stalker is dark, fair, educated, uneducated, rich, poor, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isaayi: I have been stalked; I don’t like the feeling. ‘Love’ is not the emotion that rises in me when I see someone intrude into my personal space. Sympathy is not what I feel when he has ‘done so much for me’ [And if socio-economic class had a role to play in our responses, then Donald Trump wouldn’t be facing accusations of sexual assault from multiple women. He’s rich and powerful and he too thinks that he can get any woman he wants, because…]\n\nBut never mind. I’m not going to change your opinion that all scenarios are equal and the same, and therefore, our calling out anything at all is a sheer waste of time. As it is, I’ve wasted enough of BR’s comment space, in trying to engage in a discussion on what stalking means to women, and what it means to have it normalised, justified, glorified on screen.\n\n@Aadhy : Thankfully at the place I work, time in office is a separate metric, calculated (uneditable) by the system, to save us employees from subjective managers :). I have clearly explained why I have a soft corner for SK – not for the reason you are attributing to. You have the right to not call out something, and I have the right to point that out – even stevens ?\n\n@Sharan : I felt blank after the movie. No emotions – parts of it were mildly entertaining, rest meh. If I really think hard, I might have felt wasted money and time.\n\nAnu: BR again took the logical route – did not accuse Arun of patronizing. I see that you have apologized. Do you really want me to explain again how in each of the movies I had mentioned, there was stalking involved. From what I have seen Shalini(was not encouraging, neither was she discouraging, is that a yes in wooing lingo ?), Trisha(clearly explains why theirs will not be a good match and STR doesn’t stop his pursuit), Sameera(I would be spooked if some random person, whom I had a conversation in a train with turns up at my home.She even explains why she is different from him,her aspirations and how this might not work out, and yet he decides to fly to US to pursue her. That she agrees is AFTER the stalking happens all the way to US) were clearly reluctant participants in the initial wooing process. But then they HAD to accept the heroes proposal – strange isn’t it – but I’m fine with it.\n\nIswarya : Kudos on doing something, when most of us leave with commenting. I’m a longtime lurker here – I remember all the things from BR’s Alavanthan post in Anbe Sivam, people questioning BR on why he didnt review Dhasa, to the King and his times, to kadakumar spoiling the party, to GVM ? thanking BR, rahini mentioning in one of the posts that all comments end up in MR,GVM,IR,to the time when i missed BR’s post due to his Berlin travel, to his Bitty ruminations and all the way to your guest post on stalking. I also promptly went through the studies you had linked. Have I earned the cred to post here 😀 – now that was a patronizing post :). I for one am still not convinced, we need more data and rigorous scientific analysis on this subject. The existing studies are sparse – smoking – cancer linkage studies are still debated. Asking for data is not denying the existence, of a phenomenon. The onus to prove, is on those who claim that it exists.\n\nUncouth village youth: Since there’s no way I could read your mind, I have no clue if anyone with a new moniker has been a lurker. Your previous responses didn’t reveal that you had read through all that had led us this far. Anyway, I was expressing my exhaustion which is real & complete. Frankly, “Out of the ~80 million people in TN, we have zeroed in on a few isolated incidents and ‘scientifically’ linked them to stalking on screen. That’s one hell of a sample space I would say” is no way to give anyone a hint that you have gone through a 10-year compilation of medical research already.\n\nHad you probably expressed your disagreement with the research citations in an earlier thread (and if I had remembered that), I might have chosen to use a different tone. Anyway thanks for acknowledging what we do. Of course we know there will be people unconvinced by any kind of data and willing to split hairs. It’s alright. It’s not a perfect world anyway.\n\nArun: I must admit your translation “I don’t know what the hell – enna naragam da pesure” just cracked me up. But then, at the expense of sounding like some gatekeeping grandpa here, I wonder if you are new to this place. People have said pointedly nasty things about and to others here, especially in the glory days of a certain banned commenter. Yes, of late, we have been trying to do a lot of clean housekeeping but even then I don’t think anyone here was attacking SK below the belt. He has made terrible career choices, the consequences of which, have unfortunately not been confined to himself. So, those among the aggrieved are bound to use strong language to express their protest. How is that surprising? You see that SK is hardly ready to budge despite the bludgeoning. You think pillow fight might bring better results?\n\nOlemisstarana: I know this is out of the blue, but yeah, I now sense your frustration and see why you felt that the petition was tepidly worded. Working with refugees, acid attack/rape survivors, stalking victims, etc on a regular basis does erode one’s preening need for politeness. As a fellow campaigner and filmmaker was telling people the other day, the only true response to “But why are you SO ANGRY?” is “Why the hell aren’t YOU angry, living as you do in this incredibly *messed up world? Is it simply because your privilege is blinding you and you don’t give a flying *fig about fellow humans suffering?” (There, I self-censored against swearing!)\n\nmak: As I’ve been repeating here, I confess I’m very tired. I may happily engage in a discussion with you on another occasion. So please excuse me when I don’t answer all the points you have raised. But thanks for liking my letter. I’m running pillar to post with video shoots, campus drives and press interviews to the point where I have lost track of where the stuff I write gets published. So, I didn’t even know that Times of India had published my letter. Would you be kind enough to provide a link? Also, did this appear in print? Date?\n\nEveryone who has been writing, arguing, keeping the discussion alive, thank you. If the stalking trope eventually disappears from Tamil cinema (as marrying the rapist seems to have done), you can be proud that you contributed to it.\n\nAlso glad to share with others who don’t read Tamil magazines that, Vikatan has come out with a scathing review of Remo in its print edition, calling it “bad both for Tamil cinema as well as society,” hard-hitting words that it had not even used for the epic disgrace of a film called “I”. So, yes, there is hope yet!\n\nFinal note: Data related to stalking and media influence is right now being gathered in Chennai as a result of this campaign. The results of the study, headed by a professor of Criminology here in Chennai, will be out in a few more months. Those who insist on data, please hang around for updates.\n\nRight. It’s the end of a long long day now for me people, so I apologise in advance if I sound rude/terse. Every cell in my body is begging me to go to sleep but I feel compelled to write.\n\nAnu, Iswarya, Rahini and a few others- What can I say? Heartfelt thanks for fighting the good fight. It’s amazing how much energy you have to try and find a way through what seems like a brick wall. Amen to that.\n\nIswarya – The petition you started has been such an excellent catalyst to stir up things and make people (in media and cine industry particularly) not ignore the issue anymore. I read the articles you had written and watched your TV interviews with much admiration. Not only that, a nice cross section of media (reaching people from different backgrounds) seems to have picked up this issue now. For instance, was pleasantly surprised to find this very female-centric review of Remo in Ananda Vikatan (https://twitter.com/hashtag/vikatan)\n\nUncouth youth – “X is bad, I agree. But Y is also bad. So how can you call out X?” – We are saying ‘call out Y as well’. Seriously, how hard is it to comprehend? If my manager says ‘You are not putting in the requisite hours in office. So is X. But then I will continue to call out only you’, I’m going to be mighty pissed off. And I’m sure the company policy too would not accept his line of thinking.”\n\nUmm – IMO its NOT an example of the stalking issue we are talking about here – we are talking apples and oranges buddy. I will give you another example. Imagine there is this new student X who has taken to bullying your kid at school. X is funny, popular, charming, charismatic, comes from a non-academic family background and has made it to school through hard work and hard work alone. Now you have become aware of recent nasty incidents happening to bullied kids in your child’s school which have resulted in death or life-changing circumstances for some. Now when your child’s health, mental well-being and even his/her life is at stake, what would your priority be? Scouring and analysing which bunch of graduated kids may or may not have bullied your kid previously which has next-to-no bearing anymore on your child’s imminent future, or furiously working with the authorities NOW to make sure your child’s current bully i.e. X doesn’t cause anymore trouble and is himself (or herself) educated on bullying issues? Maybe X doesn’t realise he is actually a bully, maybe he thinks its all a bit of fun – he is probably not aware of the trauma he is actually causing your child, or maybe he isn’t aware his popularity (and his inherent role-model qualities) is creating more copy-cat bullies, or maybe he knows everything and still doesn’t care – are these not the more relevant questions to you as a parent? Your analysis of class/socio-economic make-up of graduated kids might be good research material to understand bullying, but no way are you telling me it is a prerequisite (particularly one that will get you mighty pissed off otherwise) to identify and call out every privileged ex-student who might have been a bully in that school, before you would even consider doing anything about the issue at hand – i.e. X.\n\nOn SK – My personal opinion is this. He is a likeable boy-next-door personality with a natural sense of humour, and there is definitely space for people like him in cinema. However it is clear to see for anyone that he is bidding for stardom. Now we all know, while a movie with a normal actor revolves around the script, a movie with a star actor revolves around the star mainly (except a few). All normal logic is thrown out the window and with it any respect for the female leads mostly. I for one, was hoping it will all end with Rajini, Kamal, Vijay, Ajith and the lot and that the new crop of actors will be much more sensible. It looks like I was wrong. Well then, is it too much to ask that the new (wannabe) star actors are at least more socially responsible (like the new versions of poisonous-chemicals-within-permissible-levels instant noodles)? They are obviously Kidding themselves if they think what they do is ‘just art’ and that it will have no influence on youngsters and that they are only reflecting life. As the cliche goes, with great power comes great responsibility and if they can’t handle it, they should release a statement saying they shouldn’t be considered role models. So SK, with his quest for new age stardom, will indeed be validly subjected to criticism and calling out, and nothing is unfair about it.\n\nLastly, Sigh… Feminists feminists feminists – When did feminism become such a complex word to comprehend? Reading some of the comments here reminded me of this https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/22/bridget-christie-feminists-sex-men-book-extract I can’t say it better than Bridget Christie. It’s a little Frenchy so reader discretion is advised. (Feminists – it will hopefully provide you some much needed comic relief).\n\n@ sameoldnewbie: I only now came to know about Serena herself jumping into the fray. No, I don’t agree, she is not one of the greatest athletes ever. She has only had to play other women and not men so we do not have any evidence to go by to suggest that she would have been one of the greatest athletes ever in a combined comparison (on the other hand, her loss in 2001 to a 200th ranked male player indicates that she may not have been). And when you use the gender-neutral ‘athlete’ without male/female suffix, it implies combined. It is not disrespectful to say Serena is the greatest female tennis player; it is simply an allusion to the fact that she plays only against female players (whereas chess legend Judit Polgar has played against male opponents and who was ranked as high as no.8 and beaten among others Kasparov, far more legendary than Serena imo ).\n\nAs for the articles, I first came across references to this in a strident article written by a feminist where among other things she referred to how Serena is acknowledged as the greatest female tennis player but not the greatest tennis player which shows that women still have to battle gender discrimination. I don’t remember the title of the article and hence am not able to link it. I came across another dumb article on Guardian which attempts to make a case for Serena being the greatest sportsperson ever without making a single substantial point in that direction, just a load of rhetoric.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/serena-williams-greatest-sportsperson-ever\n\nI will quote the sub headline here: “and been way ahead at the top of the game for two decades. What man can match her?” – Um, Tendulkar for example?\n\nJust browsing through the net I found more evidence of this kind of sly imposing of ideological slants. This one from Huffington Post, as ever in the lead:\n\n“To box her into the category of “female athletes” ― to say she is great, but just great “for a girl” ― is a dig, accidental or not, that she has every right to call out.”\n\nLink here: http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/serena-williams-greatest-athletes_us_577e884ee4b0344d514e3d7d\n\nAgain, it’s not a dig and if she really feels so sore about it, she should have taken up Johnny Mac on his invitation for a Battle of Sexes against him. Calling her one of the greatest female athletes simply recognises the nature of the competition she chose to play in. I am sorry but she simply wants to have the cake and eat it too.\n\nReading and relishing the comments here, with a special shout out to The Warrior, Ole Miss, Iswaryam and Rahini Goliath for continuing to give witty and erudite responses to what is essentially the same response to the same tired, half-baked defenses of cinematic flotsam like Remo and all it’s predecessors.\n\nI’m especially bemused by this argument that goes “You call out SK for the creepy stalker character he plays. You give Madhavan and Surya a free pass for playing one. You’re elitist”\n\nHahahahahahahaha….wha-whaaaaaat?????\n\nFirst off, someone point me in the direction where I can get myself these “Alternate Cuts” of AP and VA, because they must have seen some version I didn’t. For the record I love AP but can’t understand the love for VA, an overlong narrative mess that got by on Surya’s six pack and a hot HJ soundtrack. Having said that…….\n\nMadhavan and Surya’s characters exhibit stalker behavior? In which Planet???\n\nGuys who espouse these points of view must not get out much on the dating scene.\n\nTake it from someone who HAS been on the dating scene. A Lot. In a country with a vibrant dating culture where you’re not only lucky enough to go out with interesting Indian women, but interesting women of other cultures. And while not all of them ended memorably (some could even be classified a disaster on par with Oil Spills, Rainforest Exterminations, Ozone Layer Depletions and Remo), they did give me many an insight into Male-Female relationships, one of which, the MOST important one, Lord KayKay will now proceed to dispense to you clueless saps.\n\nYou ready?\n\nThe universal law of relationships goes thus (grab a pen if your memory retention is poor.):\n\nMen do the picking, but women do the choosing.\n\nThere. Blow it up, laminate it, frame it, and hang it someplace that catches your eye before you head out on a date, or proceed to comment on conversations like this based on some pretty literal interpretations of movies to bolster your argument.\n\nIf a woman finds you interesting based on those first interactions, NOT in that stupid “I love you, need to have your baby ASAP” shit peddled by our filmmakers but as in “Hmmm, this guy’s interesting, wouldn’t mind getting to know him a little better” , then you’re given a little more leeway with regards to things like, maybe calling her later that night after a date, just because, you know, you wanted to check that she got home safely, or sending some flowers to the office or hell, even showing up at her place(maybe). Read the first line of this para again. ONLY if she finds you interesting.\n\nIf on the other hand, you come across as an arrogant, condescending asshole who confuses wit with caustic put downs and confidence with macho posturing (hallmarks of your garden variety Tamil Phillum Mass Hero) , then show up later at her house, and she’ll hit the speed dial for police assistance.\n\nAnd sometimes, guys, because life can be a bitch, you may be none of the above, just….safe and dull, sparking absolutely zero interest in the lady. That’s just the way the cards fall. Pick yourself up and move on.\n\nIn both AP and VA, Madhavan and Surya approached their girls with wit, charm and oodles of charisma. Their ribbing and mockery was tinged with good humor, not spite fanned with insecurity. And we’re conflating this with those cringe-inducing scenes of Vijay/Dhanush/SK spewing their venomous bile designed not to woo the lady in question, but the hooting masses of misguided males who lap that shit up in the cheap seats? These guys don’t like women. Acknowledge that. These guys DON’T LIKE WOMEN.\n\nNote: Obviously, when I’m using the name of the actors above, I’m actually talking about the way their characters are written. Vijay/Dhanush/SK may all be paragons of chivalry in real life for all I know.\n\nAnd that’s my issue with love stories depicted in so many Tamil movies. Too much Crass, not enough Class. And Class has Jack Shit to do with your Caste/Skin Color/Upbringing, for those who think I’m hopping on THAT bandwagon. It’s that witty banter, that teasing out of interest, the joy of having an interesting conversation with an intelligent woman, it’s a crater-sized void in many scripts for so called “Romantic” (hahahaha!) Tamil movies.\n\nDate Night for most of these writers and filmmakers must consist of clicking on PornHub and having wet wipes on standby.\n\nChange needs to happen there. The men greenlighting these scripts and financing these films need to consist of those who have had REAL conversations and interactions with women, not one-sided encouragements shouted out to your favorite disrobing porn star.\n\nKayKay : Thanks for the laughs dude. Your post certainly made my day.\n\nGuys who espouse these points of view must not get out much on the dating\n\nNow, that you have proved to us that you can figure out stuff about random internet commenters, please go and join NSA. The world needs you right now. Why spend enormous amount on NLP,Data Mining and stuff when we have guys like you giving out gyaan for free.\n\nTake it from someone who HAS been on the dating scene. A Lot\n\nYeah right. We all absolutely believe the brag of some anonymous guy on the internet. I for a moment thought that a rediff commenter has misposted here. Are we supposed to be in awe of your achievements with dating women – or is that what you yearn yourself to be in the virtual world. You know what, you are like the North Indian Amits who studied engineering with me. They bragged about their GQ(girlfriend quotient), because obviously we Madurai/Tirunelveli guys never go out on a date. We always thought, date could be found, only on the calendar. You guys made for good laughs then – seems like there is not much improvement.\n\nMen do the picking, but women do the choosing.\n\nVery true that, women are never capable of picking, they just stand on sub urban trains waiting to be picked. And yeah, people will pin this, laminate this whatever.\n\nNow on to your passionate defense of ‘ribbing and mockery was tinged with good humor, not spite fanned with insecurity’. Take the scene from AP, here is a medical student, on her way to college.You walk up to her and say, suggestively that you don’t look beautiful, blah blah , in what is effectively a cheesy pick up line. In one swoop, you have reduced an accomplished aspiring woman, to a ‘beautiful’ woman. Because, nothing else matters, nothing does . Same in VA, you woo the girl by singing ‘Penne un mel pizhai, you smile like Bougainvilla’ type pethals, which btw is way better than -nee enakku venum, ilayna sethuruven :P. Sameera, very clearly defines her aspirations and her qualifications without putting down Surya, and you guys take it as an yes. I’m reassured now, not every No, is a no, classy ‘Nos’ are come-hither signals.\n\nNow that I think about it, I should also add NEP to this exalted list. How do you win over an ex ? Track her down , barge into her workplace and try to prove the superiority of your love, in front of impressionable school children, no less. And no, politely dropping a mail/sms will not work – take it from the man who has multiple notches on his bed post :P. Yay – ribbing and mockery with good humor. But then GVM, himself has accepted that it is AP(or evano oruvan song, I forgot) which inspired his love trilogy.\n\nJustification of stalking, by saying the woman said yes – is an afterthought. Let’s say I’m pulling into my driveway and a police officer finds that i’m DUI. Should he leave me because, I caused no harm so far, on the roads ? It will be more like the smoking warning we are seeing these days – either it is a stalking scene or it is not, with no in between.\n\nTo all the others who are saying – we/I are/am using class as a cudgel, to beat a specific caste, come down from your high horse. Your statements are eminently laughable, when today in TN, every caste considers itself as upper caste socio-politically. Travel to Nagercoil/Sivakasi, Periyakulam/Theni, Dharmapuri/Salem to know what I mean. My grouse is only about people referring to dark skinned hero as a trope,project Dhanush/SK as the only culprits, while relatively fair skinned heroes(Karthi,Jiva,Simbu – how times change,Madhavan) are given a pass. This is not the Jim Crow south, where white women have to be protected from the black men. Thankfully Iswarya’s petition steers clear of this stereotypes – thank you for the small mercies.\n\nNow, off to PornHub/xvideos to relieve myself.\n\nWell i just popped in to check out, how the hell does a sivakarthikeyan film review gets 200 + comments?. well now i know. its the old maalai nerathu mayakkam situation. I havent seen many SK movies , maybe 2 or 3. i find him no better or worse than every other superstar aspirant out there except VJS- who is ofcourse in a class of his own.\n\nI dont have much to add to what others have already said, but just want to say that I am simply amazed by the fortitude, patience , persistence, Linguistic skills,.. shown by the likes of Iswarya, Anu ,Rahini,…etc not only in putting for their views on the subject – which they have done relentlessly and untiringly in blog after blog- but going to the extend of clarifying, re clarifying, explaining, apologising,… to get their point across – to people who simply wont or dont want to understand their pov- to the point that leave me totally exhausted. if it was me in you place, i would have tried once, may be twice and just said to hell with it and moved on. More than all the great points that you have put forth , your attitude and your passion shows the importance of issue at hand\n\nIshwarya,just saw your interview. you rocked. You were so spontaneous, eloquent and precise to the point in putting forth your views. i wish you had got more time to articulate your views. but the way you still were able to put across so many important points regarding misogyny and stalking in cinema was applause worthy. i wonder whether you got a copy of questions in advance or it was all spur of the moment. Anyway it was great.\n\nAnu, your comments as always are so beautifully written. you know Kaykay is considered the superstar commenter around here – and rightly so 🙂 – , the way he can put across his views in such jazzy entertaining language is hard to top. but yours are the most beautiful . Even when if i dont agree with you on everything you say – and there has been so many in the past-, i am totally mesmerized by how you say them and never more so in this thread.\n\nRahini, its always nice to see you are fair about the subject that you are commenting about and knows when to separate the misogynistic from the stupid 🙂 i am sorry i havent visited your blog for some time – or for that matter here- now due to severe time constraints brought about work pressures. i always tend to miss out on great debates that are happening here . by the time i get here , its almost over. Regarding that scene in VA, i would like to call it romantic fantasy ,and like all fantastic romantic gestures, it does comes across as stupid. Honestly that entire Young surya- Sameera reddy episode is straight out of fantasy. As Kaykay was saying, the narrative structure of the film is quite a mess . An uneasy mix of romantic fantasy and reality. It was a great conception by GVM but not very well executed. Hence it come across as stupid.\n\nVenkatesh, i am not sure what SK is doing is any different or worse than what some one like Vijay did (with the help of his father) or TRS is doing (crowning himself the Little superstar and shamelessly aping Rajni’s mannerisms) to achieve stardom. May be you know something that i dont\n\n“No women would ever be GOAT ever in any sport except chess ? .. Don’t you think this is problematic ?” – Well, they could probably match men in gymnastics, for instance, which IS an olympic sport. Is it problematic? Not objectively speaking, because men are physically stronger and until such time as that changes, this will continue to be the case. This is the whole reason men and women don’t compete against each other in sport. It would be unfair to the women. Now for whatever reason, the feminists, Nike and Serena want to upend this, claiming it is ‘discriminatory’ to call her ‘only’ greatest female athlete. Fine, but in that case, you have to compete with the men too if you want to establish yourself as the greatest athlete. It has to be earned. It is an epithet, not an entitlement. But there is a simple solution to mollify both sides. Just stop using gender neutral epithets in sports where the two genders don’t compete against each other. So, instead of GOAT, let’s use GMOAT (greatest male player of all time) and GFOAT (greatest female player of all time). Semantic issues can be solved by adjusting the vocabulary. They do not need structural reforms and they most certainly can be carried out without waging a war on the ‘other’.\n\n“Comparing Serena and Roger is comparing apples and oranges .” Indeed, and that is why it would be objectively bad to call her GOAT, because they do not play in comparable competitions. But it is not I who have initiated the comparison, it’s they who wanted it, whoever that they encompasses, be it Nike, be it columnists or be it Serena herself. Now, once you compare, the physical strength of the male player weighs on the equation.\n\n“I myself am a Federer fanatic and cried everytime he lost Finals, he could have won.” – Serena’s lost slam finals to Kerber, Muguruza, Sharapova, none of whom have double digit slam figures. Federer has yet lost only one slam final to a player not named Nadal or Djokovic and that’s Del Potro in 2009. I think the real problem is the lack of respect Fed fans have, for whatever reason, for Nadal and Djokovic as if they are unworthy and it’s all Fed’s fault he’s lost to them. No, they just happen to be all time great players too. The only player who would enter an ATG conversation from Serena’s era is Venus. That is not her fault but that is also why comparing slam totals of players in different tours makes no sense. To extend this point further, Navratilova, winner of 18 slams, played the much older and washed out Connors, winner of 8 slams, was given the doubles alley while Connors was given only one serve. Connors still won and serve volleyed more than he probably ever did in his career! So just because Serena has more slams in the WTA than Fed in the ATP doesn’t mean she’s a better player than Fed.\n\n“But are they really feminists in the first place even if self-proclaimed..I don’t think they are IMHO. ” – And those feminists would then disagree with you and accuse you of man splaining or whatever.\n\n“So we should be ignoring the men haters and giving space for real feminism.” – Right, and I am not denying them the space either. I had made a lot of contributions in the earlier thread about the depiction of stalking in films where a lot of people were very defensive about what they regarded as censorship of films when we were only advocating an appeal to voluntarily stop depicting stalking/boycotts by viewers. But when feminists lament that the term feminism is regarded as a pejorative these days (would have been unthinkable in my college days), I have to point out that they, or rather some of them, are part of the problem. That is all I was trying to address by bringing up the man-hating side of feminism. I believe it is precisely this side which chooses to pick on purely semantic issues as the above with Serena and thus burn the credibility of the movement when there are far more pressing problems yet to be addressed. They are more interested in somehow staying relevant rather than being committed to the movement.\n\nRahini: Thanks. It takes a brave soul to agree with someone who has just been labelled Mr Trump. 😛\n\n“Steffi in her prime could have been considered the greatest tennis player in the world even above here male colleagues . ” – There I don’t really agree. I mean, if a baseliner like Seles was happy to pull her wide on the AD and come in behind the serve, I don’t see Sampras or even Krajicek facing any real problems against her. It’s difficult to explain the difference between the two tours because TV does not really capture topspin. And topspin is the main difference why men can keep generating effortless power without missing much while the ladies make more errors (well, the aggressive ones and not thinking of the Wozniacki/Radwanska types). I can understand the power aspect of it but I have never understood exactly what impedes the female tennis players from mastering topspin. The only female tennis player who I thought was one heck of a topspin wizard (and who IIRC even Fed acknowledged as an influence/inspiration) was Martina Hingis. Unfortunately, she lacked the brute strength in a time when women’s tennis became more about raw power. The ladies are also impeded on serve more due to skill issues than strength. It doesn’t necessarily take a lot of strength to hit a fast serve (most people who have never played the game don’t realise how small a tennis court actually is) but because most women don’t play sports that involve throwing, they struggle with the ball toss. I should know since I was horrible at throwing in school days and that problem haunted and continues to haunt me when I took up tennis.\n\n“It is imperative that we celebrate the women for their achievements but not for the wrong ones. If someone was to say that Meryl Streep is the greatest american actor in the last 50 years irrespective of their gender, then i would wholeheartedly agree. if someone says the same about shabhana azmi in the indian context, i would agree with that too.Same with Lata Mangeshkar or P.Susheela when it comes to singing. but not with Serena williams being the greatest tennis player of all times , no way..” – Yes, fully agree with this line of reasoning if not necessarily all of the examples (where it boils down to personal preferences rather than any objective gaps in skill in any case). I would like to see the best actress/best female playback singer awards done away with and merged with best actor/best singer. There used to be only a gender neutral playback singer award in the Filmfare awards once. I believe that today tastes have matured enough in India that actresses and female singers could win awards even in a combined field so why not! In sport, the separation is necessary to give them a level playing field, as counter-intuitive as this sounds. Hey, if some people still find this reasoning sexist, whatever floats your boat. I have already proposed the solution – let the women compete with the men in sports. It will not be pretty, though, and they get a much better platform to showcase their talents the way things are at present.\n\nMadan – Tx for the links. Let’s break this down.\n\n‘What man can match her?” – Um, Tendulkar for example?’\n\nIt is not the first time Guardian editors have forgotten Asian achievers (male and female equally) nor will it be the last. It has got nothing to do with feminism.\n\n‘Just browsing through the net I found more evidence of this kind of sly imposing of ideological slants. This one from Huffington Post, ‘\n\nRight. There will be individuals using hyperbole from all walks of life and ideologies and the world of feminism isn’t spared of it. But its the stereotyping that gets to me sometimes. You had brought up a couple stereotypical examples from the net; but you have met more than three ‘feminists’ here who disprove that stereotype (like Iswarya for instance). So all I ask is to get past prejudices and look at it from a non-prejudiced non-myopical non-antiquated view because it is a bit frustrating sometimes (I don’t know how to explain this further but how do you feel about a lot of westerners still thinking of India as the land of snake-charmers or whatever?).\n\n‘on the other hand, her loss in 2001 to a 200th ranked male player indicates that she may not have been)’\n\nTo keep things in perspective, she was 16 at the time, playing against someone double her age.\n\n“she should have taken up Johnny Mac on his invitation for a Battle of Sexes against him.”\n\nAnd what exactly would these one-off exhibition matches prove? It is just entertainment; nothing more. Federer lost his first three games against Andre Agassi. Djoko lost his first four against Federer, 2 against Nadal (He has only won 3 times in his first 10 appearances against either of them). All I can infer from it is that it is impossible to speculate on a player’s talent and limit based on their first game against someone. Given enough time in the men’s league, who knows what Serena might achieve? There is a lot of scientific studies and research being done on the male vs female physicality thing, some with surprising results. I am not going to go into all of them but will leave a couple of links here\n\nhttp://isreview.org/issue/72/are-men-really-better-athletes\n\nhttp://time.com/money/4265912/equal-pay-tennis-djokovic-williams/\n\n“No, I don’t agree, she is not one of the greatest athletes ever. “\n\nNot sure if you heard this expression “Can he do it on a cold, wet Wednesday night in Stoke though?’ An English football commentator had a dig at Messi winning Balon d’Or in 2010 saying Messi can score at will in sunny warm La Liga in Spain, but that he would ‘struggle on a cold night at the Britannia Stadium’ which is the home of the English Premier League (EPL) team Stoke and is known to have some of the harshest winter conditions for play. It was kind of a pompous statement implying EPL is a tougher, more physical, more brutal league than La Liga and that flair players like Messi would suffer in the EPL (as if!). That expression is now firmly embedded in sports language in the UK; and is used in a jokey way to question the credentials of a successful team, and Britannia stadium has become a benchmark of sorts.\n\nI guess it is only fair that people will have different benchmarks in sports depending on various things; and as per yours, Serena isn’t a great athlete (fine by me). But in my view, in a planet filled with 7.5 billion people, she deserves to be one of the best athletes right now (male, female, naikutty all included. Note: I am NOT saying she is the best or the only – I am only saying she deserves to be one of them).\n\n“It is not the first time Guardian editors have forgotten Asian achievers (male and female equally) nor will it be the last. It has got nothing to do with feminism.” – But he’s not the only one, though. Before him, Don Bradman too had played for two decades and his average merely and barely dipped below 100 when he was done. So the argument itself is false and has nothing to do with Asians. And that article is full of falsehoods, whether they be by design or accident.\n\n“So all I ask is to get past prejudices and look at it from a non-prejudiced non-myopical non-antiquated view because it is a bit frustrating sometimes ” – And all I ask is for feminists to acknowledge the problem amongst those whom they may regard as like minded allies than to simply rail against those who have come to regard feminism as a bad word. I do not regard it as a bad word but I am also saying there is a reason why such a perception has taken hold. No liberal would have ever recoiled at the word feminist before but today there are those who do. Either you can acknowledge that the radical strain of feminism is costing it support and do something about it or you can bury your head in the sand.\n\n“To keep things in perspective, she was 16 at the time, playing against someone double her age.” – True enough, but in ’99 she also beat the previous GOAT of WTA, Graf who was also nearly double her age at the time. And she has since then avoided such matches as she would not like to be embarrassed. Here’s Karsten Braach the player himself, “but when I saw Venus a few months later at the French Open she came up to me with a big smile on her face and said, ‘You know that thing in Australia – it never happened!'” By the way, men use more topspin today than they did back then, so the gap has only widened in that regard.\n\n“And what exactly would these one-off exhibition matches prove? It is just entertainment; nothing more.” – But she wouldn’t even play an exhibition match with a player who was then 56 years old and last played a pro singles match in 1992. It’s a really long time. It may be difficult to arrive at an answer talking in generalities but I have observed her general serve speeds, the pace and spin of her groundies and her slices (or lack thereof) and I don’t see anything there that can challenge the top players of the ATP. So, no, 1-6 against Braach is not going to suddenly turn into 6-4 against Federer, not even if she plays him 10 times. What is regarded as one of the fastest serves for the women’s game is still only regarded as decent pace on the ATP. Berdych generally maxes out at 200 kph just like Serena and it is said that he is not able to leverage his height to serve as hard as he could because of technical issues. It’s not just about one or two players. I have watched Muster v/s Krajicek in CTL in the stadium followed by Pennetta v/s Cornet (both high ranked players, Pennetta had just then won the USO and retired). Pennetta and Cornet both served between 150-170 kph, like Muster, and a good deal slower than Krajicek’s 190-200 (and he was 43 and long retired). Whereas local lad Ramkumar Ramanathan was serving as fast as Krajicek is able to today (used to serve faster in the 90s when he was a pro). So I don’t see any strong evidence to suggest that the gap has closed significantly and if anything the advent of polyester strings have allowed men to refine topspin generation even more and pull further ahead of women.\n\nRe the book, I would have to read the whole thing to come to any conclusions but just on the point of the marathon, at Rio, the men’s bronze medallist was still 15 minutes faster than the women’s gold medallist. 15 minutes is a lot of time; that means she wasn’t in the ballpark. So…leave men in the dust in endurance, really? It is good to know that in some races the average time of the top 200 female participants was faster than that of the men but they are still a long way away from even challenging them on peak performance. Whether it’s 100 m or marathon, it’s the same story. And as far as tennis, the trend since the late 90s has been for women to bulk up to improve their power (and get it somewhere in the ballpark of the men). But this comes at the cost of agility. Federer or Djokovic are still very wiry like tennis players have usually been and this helps them cover court quickly without expending too much energy. So in a long five setter, the two males would have more stamina than Serena or Venus simply because it’s easier for them to keep running around.\n\n“Not sure if you heard this expression “Can he do it on a cold, wet Wednesday night in Stoke though?” – But this is not about one stadium. It is about observed differences in the performance level of the players across all conditions. Only in last year’s Wimbledon, Fed came up with a serve that absolutely jammed Murray and forced a very weak return from him; I have never seen the women even attempt those angles on the serve. And remember, we are talking about Murray who was consistently returning 147 mph bombs from Raonic in this year’s final. Even Serena only tries to ace her opponents with sheer pace rather than wicked angles. The old adage in tennis is that you are only as good as your second serve and the men’s second serve today is a monstrous kicker that denies the returner the chance to step in and pound it. Very few women use the kicker and Serena doesn’t use it very much if at all. And the serve is the one shot where she comes closest to the level of the men. The gap is greater once we get to the groundstrokes.\n\n“I guess it is only fair that people will have different benchmarks in sports depending on various things” – Fair as long as it is respected that I and others with this opinion may have valid reasons for our benchmarks instead of trying to launch a character assault on us.\n\n“and as per yours, Serena isn’t a great athlete” – No, I did not say that. I said she is not one of the greatest. There is a difference and I will come to it.\n\n“But in my view, in a planet filled with 7.5 billion people, she deserves to be one of the best athletes right now” – I agree with this but this is also different in connotation from “one of the greatest athletes of all time”. One of the greatest athletes of all time means Ali, Jordan, Federer, Bolt etc. To get into that category, she would have to be one of a kind in all tennis, not just women’s tennis. Now don’t say Ali shouldn’t be there because from that standpoint, calling a tennis player a great athlete is also very dubious and we should then restrict ourselves only to champions of track & field. Serena was addressed as “one of the greatest female athletes of all time” and she snapped that she would prefer to be addressed as one of the greatest athletes of all time. That seems to suggest the Federer, Bolt category and not just one of the most elite athletes from our heavily populated planet.\n\nKJO is much smarter than his films lead us to believe :). It was really nice of him to mention Brangan and loved his overall take on film criticism. I wish more filmmakers would have that attitude .\n\nwhat exactly is the end game ? Is it a total ban on stalkerish behavior on screen ? A disclaimer at the beginning and end of the movie, or a marquee on screen every time someone stalks ? Who decides on what is stalking on screen and what is not\n\nUVY, i think the campaign \\ petition is very clear that its not for bans or blanket censorship. its a request to the filmmakers – who in this case could be the best judges on what and why they put these misogynistic\\stalker elements in to their pictures – to voluntarily refrain from glorifying these aspects in their films which more or less happens purely for commercial reasons.\n\nSivakarthikeyan or Dhanush may publicly come with a 100 justifications about why their characters are behaving the way they do in films, how it is just an expression of love and not stalking, etc,etc but privately, i believe that they are intelligent enough to understand the damage they are doing.Its just another form of pandering to the youth audience’s baser instincts to achieve instant success.It is just that attitude that we expect them to renounce.\n\nAlong with that , the campaign hopes to get the support of the movie watching public to stop encouraging the films that do so. As in any other demand and supply market – and cinema being purely a commercial enterprise for the majority of producers and financiers -, once the demand for the product goes down its natural that the suppliers wont be foolish enough to keep peddling the same wares. they will have to change the nature of the product\n\nThere are always gray areas – no doubt about it – as there are in every social issue depicted in a subjective art form like cinema. But at least in areas where there is real clarity or objectivity – and there is definitely in this case – relative to this subject, it would be expected of the artists and the audience to support this endevour.\n\nThis is the only way we could have a reasonable solution to this problem. There is a limit to what the law can do and enforce . And censorship is definitely not the solution, leave alone the scrolls that appear randomly on screen -which is ridiculous to say the least-.Just that the artists show a reasonable amount of social responsibility.\n\nBut, what are we trying to achieve through this campaign – what exactly is the end game ? Is it a total ban on stalkerish behavior on screen ? A disclaimer at the beginning and end of the movie, or a marquee on screen every time someone stalks ? Who decides on what is stalking on screen and what is not – the censor board or the panel which decides on tax exemption￼ Then , we will have the same accusations as of now – X’s movie was let off, while mine was caught. I’m not comfortable with a total ban, since far worse stuff is shown on screen. I’m also not comfortable with endless marquees scrolling through the screen every time, a criminal act is shown\n\nThere is a link to clarifications/FAQs that addresses doubts regarding the petition in the petition itself.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/tamil-filmmakers-and-actors-stop-glorification-of-stalking-in-tamil-films\n\nI’ve copy pasted the questions here :\n\nValid questions about the petition, and its intentions and scope as FAQ’s:\n\nAre you saying that movies are the cause of Swathi’s death?\n\nNo. Cause-and-effect relations are complex and hard to establish, but it is an undeniable fact that movies are a potent influence in validating what kinds of behaviour are acceptable and which are not within any society. Further, scientific studies have established that media exposure can cause children and young adults to internalise the subconscious messages they see on the screen, accepting such values and depictions as “real.”\n\nAre you against cinema?\n\nNo, we care deeply for the most pervasive entertainment option available to us here in Tamilnadu and want it to be the best it can be.\n\nAre you blaming cinema as the primary reason for crimes that happen around us?\n\nNot at all. There are multiple and complex reasons for the occurrences of crimes around us and we will not make cinema a scapegoat. However, considering the level of influence that movies can have on the public, we believe that filmmakers should voluntarily take efforts not to glamorise or glorify criminal behaviour.\n\nAre you against freedom of expression or in favour of censorship?\n\nNo. A big NO. We believe that art has always pushed boundaries and should continue to do so without fear of either draconian regulations or extrajudicial fringe groups. However, when it comes to cinema that gets a ‘U’ certification, we want filmmakers to be fully aware that their work is being authorised to be exhibited before audiences of all ages. Bearing this in mind, we want filmmakers to refrain from reinforcing subliminal messages that serious crimes such as street sexual harassment (eve-teasing) or stalking are actually just harmless fun.\n\nDon’t other crimes such as murder, rape, smuggling, etc. matter? Should they also not be shown in films?\n\nOf course, other crimes are serious too. However, the cultural conditioning in our families as well as the codes of civics included in our education teaches children that these are crimes. Social taboos ingrained from childhood against killing, rape, etc. give us enough perspective to see onscreen depictions of such actions as aberrations. However, stalking was not recognised as a crime in the Indian law until the Criminal Law Amendment of 2013, following reactions to the Nirbhaya case. I.P.C. 354D being a new legislation, many people are not even aware that stalking, by itself, (sans any other physical harm done to a woman, such as acid attack) is an offence that can attract a jail term. Further, it is difficult to justify acts such as murder or rape in a movie and the character committing the crime is generally not let off without any penalties or consequences. However, stalking is regularly portrayed as acceptable behaviour that will eventually be rewarded rather than as a punishable crime.\n\nDo you want disclaimers to be put in whenever a character on screen commits any crime (like the present smoking/liquor warnings)?\n\nNo. We believe that such warnings are distracting and largely useless since they are not organic to the film. If a film does not inherently make smoking or drinking unappealing, a mere disclaimer that is added as an afterthought will hardly have any effect.\n\nShould movies never be made about a character who is a stalker?\n\nNo. Movies ought to be made about all kinds of characters. However, we ask filmmakers to refrain from (a) glorifying stalking as the way to win a woman’s love, and (b) inserting such insidious messages into movies that are meant to be consumed by audiences of all ages. In the case of films that are certified ‘A,’ we do not call for any restriction. However, promoting or normalising stalking in movies that target impressionable young adults has to stop.\n\nIf your intention is mainly to protect children and young adults, shouldn’t this petition be directed at CBFC asking for films that glorify stalking behaviour to be certified ‘A’?\n\nThat would definitely be the logical next step of our #CallingOutStalking campaign. However, we believe that the filmmakers themselves would be willing to make reforms if sufficient public support is gathered for our campaign at this stage.\n\nA clarification:\n\nI don’t and won’t show an iota of support for Remo.\n\nFirst of all, for all that’s holy, Kadhal Konden, Devathayai Kanden, Padikkadhavan, Raanjhanaa are the films Dhanush is guilty of having acted in.\n\nRaanjhanaa is exempted for reason BR states.\n\nDevathayai Kanden, Kadhal Konden has very much the plot for the stalking, in the sense “getting her by any means”, which isn’t to say that I am justifying it. Both films couldn’t have gone either way too as in Raanjhanaa.\n\nSo Padikkadhavan remains whose limit was what I stated. I Didn’t justify its content for the hecks sake.\n\nAs for the statement made in defense for importuning love by showing the purity or whatever, stands.\n\nHe has done it in Aadukalam too, the slitting thing. The heroine doesn’t hug or console him or anything that Zoya does. She looks on. She doesn’t fall for him even if he shows his “pure” love.\n\nAnd with regards to marriage being the culmination, I now realise that not everyone looks beyond the movie. For most of them they are winning the girl.\n\nBut again, Padikkadhavan is such one off film. I very well agree.\n\nAs for the daughter-sister question, what would sense my agony that I spent these many days recollecting where this scene played out in Raanjhanaa and to find it in Remo, of which I had spoke no word at all, makes me cringe and coming from whom?\n\nMaking a point is okay. But make it so that it is relevant for whom you are making it. Or else the point would remain irrelevant.\n\nAs for my narrow minded views, I spent a heck of a day convincing my friends that Radhika Apte isn’t a slut for having acted in Parched. I was relentless till they acknowledged that what she did was what very few artists have the finesse and courage to do. That she is the finest talent.\n\nWhen my friends secretly sneaked into Trisha Illana Nayantara, they came out with a view that they would go out to any extent to find a virgin girl for them. I haven’t still been able to fully make them understand that that is extremely narrow to think of it that way and that past relations should never come in way and they should have no qualms if the girl of choice isn’t virgin. That never should be the parameter.\n\nThey looked down upon me for that.\n\nHeck I don’t even judge Sunny Leone. I would not call her names. She is doing her profession.\n\nI explained that a woman can be a “kudumba kuthuvilakku” if she doesn’t do the dishes or cook, or if she earns. Earning isn’t really a men domain and household isn’t exactly a woman’s domain. It is a maid’s. This much I have reasoned out well. That use of quotes is to signify that their general perception was quite opposite and quite regressive.\n\nAnd yet, yes I am a narrow minded person just because someone simply sensationalized what I meant with a SENSE of her being mine and my being her, just to the point of ownership when your wife introduces her husband as EN purushan. But I was made to look like as if I meant she’s a property to be bought, forever locked in Hitlers concentration camps enslaving her throughout her life, is another matter.\n\nThank you very much. Times of India must really be watching this space out.\n\nAs for marriage, I think it of as a social construct. And my imagination is quite good enough to not think of a happy live in relationship. But I meander beyond what’s apparent and think of what would happen if they have consensual sex and be blessed with a baby. What society would percieve, what effects it would have on the baby when it would hear that their parents aren’t actually married but lead a very wholly radical life, what would go through the baby when it hears, “oru appanukku porunthurunthundha” shit.\n\nI very well had a daughter-sister question along the same line as a retort but I know better than to ask it.\n\nMarriage is something which defines the couple for themselves and for the society. Why else then do we need witnesses to these events? It is all well if you can stay happily ignoring mind numbing judgements that gets passed on you , but if you care for what society thinks of you, your life will be pretty much crippled.\n\nOh! Just found this gem,\n\nAt the end, they two realize that they cannot be only in love forever and decide to get married.\n\nGuess from where? From the Wiki Page of OK Kanmani directed by the so revered one in here, the man himself, amidst applause, Mr. Mani Ratnam! Talk about legal stamp now!\n\nBeing radical is one thing, to spout non sense just so as to make a point is quite another.\n\nAs for calling someone’s point of view uninformed is pretty immature for you is not he. You and he differs by a plethora of factors.\n\nThis is why I didn’t judge the man who said Kareena kissing Arjun was wrong in Ki and Ka thread and took the professional way of explaining the matter out. It is the surrounding he’s been in or has been brought up in and has to be considered and respected to make a collective decision. Altman makes an excellent point on this front.\n\nAs for someone who took back something which he must have thought he had given me, you would be surprised to know that I pretty much knew what was gonna be said when I said, “hope I don’t sound immature”. It was like baiting for the fish I already had.\n\nI also knew if I were to put the same in here, I would get a contrasting answer. But then I never did expect more.\n\nAs for echo chambers, it is no doubt, that everyone here would agree that the diaspora in here is extremely limited. The views are polarised to a positive side. The negative and the general side that predominantly exists in the society hardly comes in here to take part in the discussions. In such a case if alternate views are respected and discussed upon than judging them would be good for the blog and will save it\n\nfrom becoming an echo chamber.\n\nLastly this comment covers and represents what my previous comments stood for.\n\nRahini: Please find my comment above. What I find irksome is, Dhanush is invariably called whenever stalking is the issue, when clearly Padikkadhavan which was a problematic one released long back and he has given many movies later which hadn’t had woman as some trophy to be possessed.\n\nIn 3, the pursuit was stopped when she asks him not to follow. Her words were respected.\n\nSo what’s with calling him every time? Even by BRs own definition, Dhanush has hardly acted in 4 aforementioned movies which is stalkerish. But then words are thrown preposteroulsy as in Dhanush being the poster boy of stalkers. That’s where the problem lies.\n\nI catch every movie I can on TV. In fact I have been to Dhanush films in theatres only 3 times. I can’t afford to view videos in YouTube.\n\nJio sim vaangra kastam ena"
