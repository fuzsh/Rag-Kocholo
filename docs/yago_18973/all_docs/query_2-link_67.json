        "text": "The history of Indian English poetry is very vibrant, rich and vast, and the contributions made by women poets attest to their determined efforts to carve a niche of their own in the field of poetry. Indian English poetry written by women came into being as a definitive genre by itself only in the 60s of the last century. The post-independence phase of Indian English poetry by women not only bears the stamp of a woman‟s sensitivity and perceptivity of the realities of the commonplace, but also acknowledges the complex nature of the problems confounded by women in the contemporary society. The postmodern era has witnessed the birth of several Indian women poets whose poetry very often becomes a reflection of their experiences and sensibilities. The present article proposes to examine the select poems of Eunice de Souza that are considered to be representative of her role as a woman-poet, and in which Eunice has deftly tracked the emotional and psychic growth and development of feminine consciousness towards acquiring a sense of selfhood in a social order that allows no scope for the exploration of her inner urges and creative potentialities. A look back at the history of Indian poetry written in the English language shows the profound and revolutionary of poetry written during the last few decades. It is obvious that in the last fifty years Indian English poetry has experimented with a variety of themes and has also come under varied influences. During the pre-Independence phase of Indian English poetry, Indian English women poets showed an affinity to the British Romantic poets, and so their poetry was highly sentimental and romantic in their approach. But in the latter half of the twentieth century, Indian English women‟s poetry came to the centre stage, and became more allied with the social modes of behaviour and life. Poetry, thus, evolved as a significant and effective medium to capture and analyse the sensibilities and ethos of modern Indian socio-cultural life structured around patriarchal value systems. Poetry by women poets therefore transcended the borders and boundaries of the domestic spheres of life to emerge as powerful voices representing the collective consciousness of the women community. The modern Indian English women poets, unlike their predecessors, display their non-conformist stance by questioning the socio-cultural, economic and political conditions of the times in which they lived.\n\nIndian English women poetry can be viewed as an attempt at self- revelation, as there are determined efforts on the part of the women poets to carve out an individual space of their own in the familial as well as social life. Women poets of the postindependence era include Mamta Kalia, Sunita Jain, Gauri Deshpande, Suniti Namjoshi, Imtiaz Dharkar, Melanie Silgardo, Eunice de Souza and so on. They give voice to their dissatisfaction, bitterness, and frustration. Eunice de Souza is one of the most famous confessional poets of second half of twentieth century. Her poetry allow us to peep into her sufferings and tortured psyche on the one hand and the paradox and complexity of the female psyche on the other hand. She reveals the tensions and frustrations which a woman faces because of the discrepancy between the way she wants to behave and the way she is made to behave. De Souza‘s dealing with love and sexuality in her poems show how she is dissatisfied with the society which demands si...\n\nPutting the focus on Chandra Talpade Mohanty theory about the understanding that western feminist scholars have on women of the “third word”, this essay seeks to analyze the artistic work of Gioconda Belli, a Nicaraguan poet, activist and feminist. In that sense, the poetry of Belli is presented as an example of how western feminism has little to say about women in the “third world” (about Latin American women). The complexity of the context in which Belli wrote the poems shows the impossibility of analyzing a “third world women” in universalistic terms. Thereby, western feminists generalization about women. in non-western countries misnamed or ignored the experience of too many women, usually omitting or belittling vital information that stemmed from differences of class, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and ability. Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg Institut für Soziologie Global Studies Programme Department: European Social Thought\n\nWhile the academic world talks of different waves of feminism that have emerged in Europe and the US in the past few centuries, the feminists from the third world countries have reservations on the use of a western framework of feminism in investigating the challenges faced by the women from third world countries. The structural discrimination that permeates the gender divide in India is so variegated that a homogenous reprisal will be inadequate to understand the problems that persist among several ethnic communities in a postcolonial context. Neither religion nor education could erase the structural discrimination that continues to exist in these ethnic societies because of the persistence of regressive “customary laws” that allow male domination. This essay argues that the emerging feminist voices like Monalisa Chankija and Mona Zote from India’s north-east have used “performativity” as a tool to counter these gendered societies on one hand, and on the other hand it has also un-g...\n\nThe research attempts to evaluate the depiction of women&#39;s oppression in specific postcolonial contexts at the hands of the interlocked power pattern formed by manifold factors like patriarchy, class conflict, religion, ethnicity and imperialism in the selected poetry of the renowned Pakistani poetess Fehmida Riaz, the Latino American Poetess Pat Mora, and the Japanese poetess Sanbonmatsu. It applies the theory of Postcolonial Feminism to bring to the fore the oppression of postcolonial women at the intersection of gender, class, race, religion and culture, hence, offering a critique of Western Feminist discourse and its slogan of sisterhood, which tends to erase heterogeneity in women&#39;s situations across the globe. The theory of Third World Feminism as well as the portrayals in these poetic compositions from a variety of postcolonial social formations, highlight the fact that postcolonial women are not a monolithic and archetypal suffering category as presented in Western d...\n\nIn the pervasiveness of the dominant male voices in literature, the resistant female voices have traditionally got drowned. This has made the act of identification and foregrounding of the works of women an important political act, enabling women to gain agency by focusing attention on the silences and taboos on their bodies, sexualities, desires and pleasures thereby disrupting the hegemonic patriarchal establishment. It is in this context that this paper attempts to make a reading of 'Tattooed with Taboos: An Anthology of Poetry by Three Women from Northeast India', a collection of seventy-seven poems which tries to understand what it means to be a woman in a society fettered with the shackles of patriarchy. The resistance in the anthology (first published in 2011), complied by poets who hail from a peripheral province in the Indian nation-state, begins with the cover design, which powerfully foregrounds a picture of the hem of a 'phanek' (a traditional sarong-like dress worn by women in Manipur), which, because of the norm created by the social matrix of the patriarchal Manipuri society, is regarded as inauspicious and untouchable for the menfolk because of its association with the body of the woman. The paper endeavours to explore how the picture of a vilified piece of dress, symbolising the social control of women's bodies, becomes in the hands of these women poets potent cultural capital as they go about resisting in/through their poetry the sexual colonisation of their bodies and the smothering of their desires by a patriarchal society. In this context, the paper attempts to look at how the poets in this anthology try to re-historicise the pain, sufferings and trauma inscribed on the 'abject' bodies of women by questioning the existing discourse and trying to find a new way of viewing/writing their bodies. This endeavour on the part of the poets, as this paper tries to show, leads them to express a desire to trespass into spaces usually denied to women in the personal and the public.\n\nFeminism is the advocacy of woman's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. The various feminisms, however, share certain assumptions and concepts that underlie the diverse ways that individual critics explore the factor of sexual difference and privilege in the production, the form and content, the reception and the critical analysis and evaluation of works of literature: The basic view is that Western civilization is pervasively patriarchal (ruled by the father)-that is, it is male-centered and controlled and is organized and conducted in such a way as to subordinate women to men in all cultural domains : familial, religious, political, economic, social, legal and artistic. As Kamala Das is known for its extreme frankness in its nature of writing which encompasses all her sufferings and grievances, this present paper will traces out this feminine sensibility in her poetry with special references to her poems-An Introduction, Summer in Calcutta, My Story and The Sunshine Cat."
