Set in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai, the romantic-comedy starring Sanya Malhotra and Abhimanyu Dassani focuses on trials and tribulations of a young couple – Meenakshi and Sundareshwar.\n\nAccording to the official synopsis, 'the film encapsulates the various interlinked aspects of relationships, joint families, the awkwardness in a new marriage and everything in between.'\n\nHere’s the teaser:\n\nMeenakshi Sundareshwar is directed by Vivek Soni and co-written by him and Aarsh Vora. The film will arrive on Netflix on November 5. The teaser shows that the movie explores Tamil culture but on social media, people are saying that it has stereotyped Tamilians in the most cliched manner. In the teaser, you can see the causal representation of the Tamil songs that has resulted in people getting pissed.\n\nOne of the Twitter users wrote, “Stereotyping at its best (worst)! Another bollywood film to stereotype south indians as vegetarian, folk song listening, Rajinikanth loving, pretentious English speaking people. Grow up guys.”\n\nAnother wrote, “It ain't south Indian, it's totally wrong, it's bullshit. I don't know why Bollywood is doing this without any knowledge of South India and still portraying wrong about South. If you don't know pls don't. This is not a joke.”\n\nHere’s how people reacted on social media:"
