        "text": "The author argues that a Westernized approach has so far failed to offer a holistic image of Indian cinema. Hindi and Telugu cinemas together constitute the greater part of the Indian film industry. Since the dawn of the talkie era (1931), both these cinemas have reflected a pan-Indian culture largely drawn from an ancient Indian heritage, including fine arts. However, approaching Indian cinema through the Western theories of psychoanalysis and Marxism since 1980s has resulted in underrating of early Indian cinema and, further, overlooked the contributions of Indian classic cinema to world cinema. As a result, several awkward theories to interpret Indian cinemas have emerged. Murthy offers not only an overview of the lacunae in such theories, but also a de-Westernized approach as a holistic cultural model that subsumes both Indian semiotics and phenomenology. The chapter is predicated on the argument that negotiating the frames of Indian cinema from the perspectives of semiotics and phenomenology is a real challenge that calls for a rich knowledge of ancient Indian heritage, its culture and aesthetics. It thus argues that a de-Westernized approach to Indian Cinema is an ideal way to understand it in its entirety.\n\nThe aim of this project has been to explore the possibility of applying Phenomenology and Classical Indian Theories to cinema with the hope that their systematic application would generate new insights in a deeper understanding of cinema. This need has been felt in the context of the existing film discourse having reached a stage of stagnation, even a “crisis”, in recent times. The reason for this moribund state of contemporary film discourse has been analyzed in my thesis as due to the failure of the existing film theories to incorporate film audiences‟ ordinary experiences of cinema, viz. the romance, the thrills, and the emotions which motivate them to come to the cinema halls all over the world. The film theories have failed to acknowledge the importance of this phenomenon which is built on the audiences‟ embodied experiences of the world and their socio-cultural practices that have grown on top of them which together form, at the very basic level, what constitutes the audiences...\n\nIn this chapter I shall outline some of the main contours of psychoanalytic film theory in the Anglo-American context since the late 1960s. I shall begin with a number of methodological remarks. First, since a vast amount of words have been expended on the subject, my account will necessarily be selective. Second, since the field is so wide and varied, I have, where possible, focussed on the elucidation of key concepts, positions, and arguments that cut across the writings of different authors. Third, psychoanalytic film theory is a notoriously opaque discourse and often assumes a large amount of prior knowledge on the part of the vexed and taxed reader. In order to remain intelligible, I have employed the strategy of trying to reconstruct the arguments of psychoanalytic theorists in my own words. Fourth, the history of psychoanalytic film theory is one that often displays an arbitrary selection and deployment of psychoanalytic ideas and manifests a blurred or distorted self-understanding by film theorists of the status of the concepts they are using. This chapter seeks to diagnose some of the conceptual confusions and misunderstandings that are manifested in psychoanalytic film theory, as well as to plot a history of ideas. The result, I hope, is an account of psychoanalytic film theory that will provide impetus for reflection and reconsideration , rather than simply regurgitate a seemingly obscure and arguably moribund set of doctrines. In the first section I shall sketch the reasons why psychoanalysis has occupied such a prominent place in thinking about cinema and lay out a series of distinctions that will serve as a framework for subsequent discussion. In section 2, I shall sketch in more detail the ways in which Freudian and Lacanian theories have been used to explain the affinities of cinema with the irrational and the nature of the spectator's identification with the cinematic image and with visual fictions. In section 3 I shall explore how, by using psychoanalysis to diagnose the hypnotic power of mass culture, cultural theorists in the Marxist tradition sought to explain the seemingly irrational allegiance of the masses to a system that perpetuated their own subordination, and how Freud's dream analysis became a model for decoding and thereby exposing the ideological character of specific films. 123\n\nSummary Different disciplines have contributed to weaving a theory of psychoanalysis in the cinema: ranging from the loans from anthropology and experimental psychology, to proposals belonging to the specific sphere of film theory, such as Filmology, Text Analysis or Feminist Theory in films. In all cases, the aim is to establish a relationship between the significance structure that governs the cinema and psychology, so as to confirm that the cinema’s system of representation is modelled on our unconscious psychological apparatus, as was explained by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, among others. The arrival of psychoanalysis in film thought forges the idea that considers the cinema as an auxiliary psychological device capable of making us subjects and submerging us in the emotions in play in the conflicts proposed by any audiovisual story."
