        "text": "Wondering if this review will get you hate from the mallu folks like Jai Bhim did with the Tamil folks.I hear what you are saying but multiple interviews point to the fact that these incidents that looked dramatic were real . The police station thingy happened according to the real manjummal boys and in fact the police took away their money as well. The director did mention he was going mad including 11 people because of the flaw that you brought up where it becomes hard to define each one’s personality . He ultimately decided to keep all 11 because it would have been unfair on the real 11 manjummal boys .\n\nPer the director , the movie is mostly real as narrated to him by the real manjummal boys. I would recommend you check out the director’s interview in Cue studio and interviews with the real Manjummal boys post the release of the movie . It really is a case of facts being stranger than fiction .\n\nI disagree with your take on the movie going on a while after the rescue. I felt connected with them showing the survivor’s ordeal with PTSD. The real guy who survived told in an interview he could not sleep properly for around 3 years and he indeed had his mom sleep next to him .\n\nAnd finally thanks for pronouncing Manjummal the way it should be and wonderful finishing take on what the Malayalam film industry must be like when everyone comes together to achieve these Herculean tasks of putting out quality movies out there. Good review, Baddy 🙂\n\nThe scene where he gets called god for having cheated death sounded too corny for a malayalam movie, that i knew it had to have happened for real. And i was right. It really happened, according to the director.\n\nAlso, the cops were much worse with them and stole their money too. Even the random throwaway conversation about the god too happened between those 2 characters. All the scenes u call cliche seems to have happened for real.\n\nU seemed to have loved an average male ego fantasy movie like animal, that has gone out of its way to be vulgarly shocking to grab eyeballs. The very premise of that movie and the childish antics and arguments of ranbir with his papa was cliche ridden and predictable.\n\nLike one of the youtube comments said, u didn’t expect the director to cast a heroine and have an item dance while the rescue was happening. did u?..o but thay would have made it a typical average tamil movie then.\n\n“that really happened” is hardly an excuse to overlook a film’s shortcomings 🙂\n\nIf I want “what really happened”, I will read a non-fiction account about the Manjummel boys. In a MOVIE, you — at least, I — expect a certain kind of finesse in the writing… and I found that missing here. This was a blunt instrument of a movie.\n\nIs it an effective film? Yes. Is it a “really good” film? IMO, not quite.\n\nA writer’s job is to streamline the real-life account and make the best account possible on screen. Saying “I wanted to have all 11 people to honour the real Manjummel boys” — that is not a good screenwriting decision if half of them come up like “extras” on screen.\n\nAnyway, I am in the minority on this one. It won’t be the first. It won’t be the last 🙂\n\nI am happy for its success!\n\nI do understand your pov. But I liked the fact that the lack of big corporate production houses in malayalam industry makes it possible for these smallish “in-house” production houses to make emotional decisions like keeping all 11 friends to honor them and keeping the story as real as possible. Kind of like the movie itself…refusing to desert the friend .\n\nIf you can watch the directors interview given to the cue channel, he does say that he wanted less people for the same reasons you said and to make the filming easier, but decided to keep all 11 to not disappoint them.\n\nAlso, the reason the director took the story outside the cave is bcoz he didnt want it to be another malayankunju with all the story happening inside the claustrophobic cave and putting off the audience. I thought it was a wise decision.\n\nAnd personally, I feel that elaborating on all the friends and giving them character arc etc would have made it serial like and diluted the intensity of the climax dramatic rescue scene.\n\nMalayalees seems to have cracked the formula to reel in tamil audience . It is by not putting in commercial songs and fights…but by hooking them emotionally with all old tamil movie references…lol. Premam did that too.\n\nThe biggest plus about Manjummel is precisely that it achieves what it seeks out to do – a. keeps you at the edge of your seat, b. you absolutely sense the relief at the end; and the “theater highs” are pulled off spectacularly. I am not a fan of the genre – I felt Malayankunju was in parts excruitatingly boring for eg. and was always at the arm’s length, I didn’t like Malootty and despite all the “ahead of its time” stuff it was a mid film for me. 2018 was a cringefest personally and didn’t work for me even though it shouldn’t have been hard since most of us were affected by the floods and the emotional investment was there from the start.\n\nHere for me, Chidambaram has stayed entirely true to the story and yet pulled this off which is a rare feat.\n\n(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nLet’s keep aside the wonderful set design/cinematography – but even the light/god callback that didn’t work for you (which actually happened) was expected, but it was underplayed from a directorial POV and it was immediately followed by Subhash screaming and grabbing Kuttan by his neck. The tug-of-war thing was neatly incorporated IMO, not just the fact that they pulled him out, the fact that the specific technique was used to get him unstuck was lovely and created an insane “theater moment”.\n\nOn the other hand, I loved Premalu, but I saw that beer can stuff coming miles ahead and it played out exactly the same way and felt it to be a forced tailend/callback. Feel you’re being a tad uncharitable here to MM.\n\nThe fact that Chidambaram pulled this off and connected with the audience is a spectacular feat, I was not bored for a single moment and wept at the end. The beautiful shot of Subhash coming out of the pit like a newborn – how he’s “born again” from the pits of the earth – justapoxed beautifully with the “undaana kaayamengum”/”manithar unarndhu kolla” was just one of the best emotional/goosebump worthy moments I’ve watched in my memory. And one of the best use of a Raja song in the longest time IMO.\n\nyes I liked Bramayugam the best from the three :).\n\nThat was a great piece of cinema made out of a B movie genre by a director who puts his fingerprints on every frame and who eschews B movie tricks like jump scares and grotesque creatures and so on for 95% of its running time (only wish that Chathan was never visually represented, that’s where he dropped the ball) and elevates the horror to an intellectual level. Manjummel Boys worked for me like a solid B movie. it goes directly for your gut with a potent mixture of nostalgia, cinephilia and the ‘Bro’ sentiment and as everybody else I was very moved by the end, it’s impossible not to at the moment when Subhash is lifted from the cave and Kamal Haasan’s voice and Ilayaraja’s immortal song underscores it. It’s well made for sure, but it remains a visceral experience. It had the potential to be a much greater movie if the director had worked out the characters more deeply with a more clearer story arc. Premalu was an out and out entertainer and a ‘vibe’ movie with a great script and fresh cast, who all give vibrant performances. It’s film that I enjoyed the most, though it’s not very deep or artistically accomplished like Bramayugam.\n\nAlso, both MB and Premalu celebrates other language cultures and films unabashedly; (MB and Tamil , Premalu and Telugu) and that helps them in connecting with the audiences in those regions. I would also like to say that I don’t think there is another state, film industry in this country that celebrates the films and culture of another state\\language the way Malayalam cinema does. 🙂\n\nAnd then we have people like Jeyamohan (a Malayali himself) who rants at Malayalis like a deranged racist. There are some truths in what he says regarding alcoholism, substance abuse, irresponsible behavior etc etc , but to attribute all that stuff to just Malayalis and generalizing it to all Malayalis (not to mention the hate-filled tone of his rant) seems demented at best. WTF happened to him?. Is it something that comes over him from time to time – like 10 years ago when he blasted MGR and Sivaji?\n\nMovies like 2018 and manjummel boys is the way to go pan indian for malayalam movies. The trick is to keep the story very basic and fill it with emotional gimmicks so that it connects well to mass audience across languages. I would be surprised if movies like brahmayugam that requires more attention to be paid in terms of story and subtext would even work across borders.\n\n“If such grown people can’t understand the trouble they’re causing others”.\n\nThey are young men from working class families from a different state who came to the cave as fans of guna and kamal hassan. It will be kind of dumb to expect them to know the details of a cave that they saw kamal hassan running around in a movie.\n\nIt took them 13 official (50 or more unofficial deaths )in those caves to put a grill there to keep tourists out. I don’t know why they didn’t put one before.\n\nAccording to the boys,they didn’t know the dangers in the cave. All they saw is some board in tamil language (which might have been warning signs to keep out) and they saw some tourists coming out of the cave, which made them think that it is safe to can go in the cave.\n\nOut of state tourists aren’t aware of the extreme dangers that the locals are familiar with. Maybe that ignorance is the reason kuttan was ready to go down the hole to save his friend, while the locals were frozen into inaction bcoz they are aware of the danger .\n\nMaybe the reason the movie has emotionally got connected more with tamilians is bcoz they know the dangers and risks of the cave more, while for malayalees it is just a random cave.\n\nIf the officials can make money out of that place by naming and publicizing it after a movie, they should at least be responsible enough to take measures to keep tourists out of danger. Anyways, even if late, it is good that there are barricades and grills put in place now.\n\nAnd no matter how reckless the boys were, I dont think it was alright for the cops to harass them when they were already going through hell. But it is India… so such behavior from police is expected and normalized , I guess.\n\n“Sixon’s loud way of talking often annoyed his friends. In real life, he worked at a metal manufacturing unit. The noisy workplace forced him to talk loudly and it became a habit for him. Incidentally, Subhash got lucky because of this,” Chidambaram concluded.\n\nSubhash’s belt , Kuttan’s guilt, Sixon’s talk- these are the kind of interesting detailing that any good director would instantly include in his film. But looks like all these detailing that would have given the film texture is all omitted. That’s what happens when the director goes for the broad strokes, high emotional moments and shock effects at the expense of the nuances. I was very surprised to see Soubin’s Kuttan suddenly deciding to become the savior. Till then he’s shown to be a passive guy, he’s the mature one in the team , but he’s pretty passive. And immediately after he saves Subhash he goes back to being his passive self. He finds it difficult to react even when Subhash’s mother apologizes to him in the end. His guilt factor is a major missing link in his characterization. I thought that since Soubin is the film’s producer, he exercised his power to be the heroic savior 🙂\n\nOne thing i noticed is that there was never a single scene where we get to see what makes Manjummel Boys tick as a team (except for that tug of war sequence replicated again in the end) just one scene where there are together and in conversation with one another (except for the one on ones like the one about god). Surprisingly, except when they are in the vehicle , we hardly see them together, once they are out they instantly scatter around and come together only at the moment when Subhash falls into the pit. So we never find out What is the interpersonal dynamics between the various members of the team. I was also expecting the boys and maybe the film as well to do some introspection regarding the reckless actions of the boys that lead to them almost losing a member of their team- this never happens, maybe not to spoil the emotional high at the end. Also, The film does show that the boys were drunk and reckless and entered a restricted area where they had no business going , which resulted in the tragedy, but the film is careful not emphasise this so that the Boys do not lose the audience’s sympathy.\n\nI liked Premalu a lot and enjoyed it but loved Manjummel boys\n\nHonestly when I seriously needed a stress reliever, watched Premalu and enjoyed it thoroughly though I felt it was a bit overlong for this kind of fun movie…(like MANK)\n\nManjummel boys, I went in speculating the premise of too many actors and a known story succeeding in holding the audience captive but then absolutely fell for the movie for the emotions that it invoked it me. I also wondered at least in the first half why there were too many friends…. felt irked by the loud friend etc. But in the second half, I felt it was neatly packed with even these small traits like the tug of war needing more people to pull them out.\n\nAnd IMHO “they had it coming” is rather a harsh statement and no ground for criticizing movies or survivors of disasters, then survivor drama movies are bad…as every disaster had it coming due to some negligence, etc.\n\nNot justifying the boys’ recklessness, but all said and done they belong to a lower-income group and we have to see them for what they are not as some intellectual and cautious beings. Also, there’s a difference between restricted and dangerous areas.\n\nI also think there’s a difference between wanting fake FIRs on them and subduing them with reason, even if it’s done harshly, and yes I can see where the police are coming from feeling exasperated with the frequent duties involving suicide points, smuggling, and whatnot in such locales.\n\nI feel that the film achieved what it set out to achieve, a survivor drama where we know what the story’s outcome would be and still manages to keep us engaged throughout the movie, especially the highs.\n\nI am a huge foodie who enters the theatre with a huge tub of popcorn and with Manjummel boys mine was untouched in the second half.\n\nAs for the belt part which the director has told in some of his interviews, I think that came as an answer to the question of “why Subash survived where no one else had?”, so the belt got stuck in a tree breaking his fall and thus saving him. Chidambaram says he has missed to include in the movie due to some technical reason like lighting etc (probably just an excuse but that’s hardly a sin) but I don’t think he expects us to imagine it or anything.\n\nTo be fair every director may have such moments that they feel they could have included or edited out. Nor do I feel his including this scene would have changed the general opinion of the film (it still would have the reckless drunkard men, too many characters (a back story for them), police drama, etc. whatever made this movie less likable for some.\n\nI think the biggest conceit of the movie is not having any emotional song on friendship to prove theirs’ and taking a completely romantic song and dialogue which was a brilliant move either by chance or fluke.\n\nWatched this and feel BR’s assessment is just right. It is an effective film and nothing more. Malayalam deserves this success though considering the quality of their films in general.\n\nThe problem here is that the boys get into trouble due to their recklessness. That is not a good way to get me behind the protaganist. I was mildly relieved when the rescue succeeded, but I left thinking the guy should have been a Darwin award winner but somehow left with just a nomination. All the friendship and bromance they tried to sell fell flat.\n\nFWIW, I don’t think spelunking (or any boundary pushing risky activity) is wrong and people are free to take risks with their lives however they please. As long as they are aware of the risks and go in prepared.\n\nI wonder if instead of blocking it off completely, they simply charge a high fee, only let certified cave divers in, with written declarations stating that there won’t be rescue missions in case anything happens…Seems like a Win-Win to me.\n\nI liked that the director didn’t get into minute details and nuances. The fact that the director kept it simple and said the story in broad strokes, is one of the reasons for its wide success. A major chunk of the audience wouldn’t have been able to sit through the movie and come for repeated watching, if the director were to show off by intellectualizing it or get lost in nuances and intricacies of the story.\n\nIf one were to watch the interviews of the REAL Manjummel boys, one cannot help but be floored by how casual they are about the whole thing. And also how accepting they are of their friends for what/ who they are with all their flaws. Not once have I seen them be annoyed by a friend for interrupting or talking over them during their interviews..lol.\n\nIt is difficult not to like them especially the real kuttettan who should have been hailed as the hero, but he is so unassuming and so ready to be in the background and share the glory with the rest of the boys and not take the center stage . It is kind of easy to understand how he is not the kind to talk/ introspect/philosophize /intellectualize it . It feels like saving his friend was something that came naturally and innately to him and he has an expression that looks like he is asking what is the big deal…lol.\n\nFor all the questions asked about his heroic deed, kuttettan doesn’t seem to have much to say except that there was a bigger force that made him do it .I cant help but think that his christian background and church fellowship played a huge part in him being selfless and ready to risk his life for his friend. Even subash in his earlier interviews is mostly short of words and seem to be unable to put his ordeal in words.\n\nIn the movie, It would have looked so out of place and out of character if they were all seen waxing eloquent about the heroic deed they did. They don’t look like the lot to introspect and intellectualize what they did. They are ordinary people capable of doing extra ordinary things without giving it a second thought, which is a rarity. That could be the reason people are going in hordes to watch the movie.\n\n“Not justifying the boys’ recklessness, but all said and done they belong to a lower-income group and we have to see them for what they are not as some intellectual and cautious beings. Also, there’s a difference between restricted and dangerous areas”\n\n– Recklessness comes from a sense of entitlement and doesn’t necessarily have anything to with income groups. On the road, you can see these guys cutting through smallest of gaps at high speed, scaring the crap out of other drivers all the time. On some days these are guys driving BMW or Jawa. On some days these are young kids driving triples in a deo. This recklessness comes from the feeling that you can get away with it. When they end up getting hurt, you do know that they had it coming. People may come forward to help them but nobody’s going to feel sorry for them. That’s the price you pay for putting yours and other people’s lives at risk.\n\nThat’s how I saw the boys in the film too. Like someone said, I was mildly relieved that he got out alive but those guys just brought this upon themselves and I had no sympathy for them. If it’s restricted, that’s because it’s dangerous. Why else would a place be restricted?\n\n“I was very surprised to see Soubin’s Kuttan suddenly deciding to become the savior. “\n\n@MANK – Was it sudden though? We see Kuttan feeling guilty after seeing Subhash fall down and realizing he wouldn’t have joined the trip if Kuttan hadn’t forced him through his close-up shots peppered all throughout the time after the boys realize that Subhash has fallen down and when they learn of how dangerous his fall actually is. And I felt that it made complete sense that Kuttan becomes the saviour solely because there was no one else ready to do it even within the rescue team and it actually went with his passive nature that he wasn’t all too excited about it either. He does it in a sort of dejected way when he sees that even within their friends gang , no one exactly volunteers to do it when the officials all cite reasons to not enter into the cave.\n\nEven while watching the film,I wondered how Subhash hadn’t fallen down further down the cave and was half expecting him to fall down even further in a dramatic way when he is close to being rescued by Kuttan. The whole belt explanation seems apt now but I get how the director must be stumped to show its significance throughout the survival drama episode.\n\nI agree completely about Sixon’s talk though. That could have been better etched out in the beginning and could have even become another semi-dramatic callback moment a la the tug-of-war scene at last.\n\n@madhusudhan19 – I usually get pissed at these reckless guy gangs and uncle gangs who create a ruckus at sightseeing places and become a nuisance to the other tourists and officials alike but I was able to keep my annoyance away here . I’m not exactly sure why , maybe because we see them catching a couple of guys coming out of the place right at the time when they are thinking of entering or maybe because apart from entering into the cave they rarely showcase their entitlement/recklessness otherwise (except maybe one of their lone members causing a scene in the wedding stage). Now if this was one of Venkat Prabhu’s gangs like in Chennai-28 I don’t think I would be feeling sorry for them.\n\nThis film had a couple of moments but that’s it. Almost the entire first half had absolutely nothing going for it. You barely get to know these guys unlike say in a Venkat Prabhu movie where he manages to establish the camaraderie in a big group of fellas with humour and you feel like you are part of the gang, as the vibe just pulls you in. That just did not happen here. So it is difficult to invest in the film.\n\nI agree with the comments which pointed out the bad behaviour of this gang and I don’t think it can be justified. Kodaikanal is a beautiful place with a delicate ecosystem that is savagely violated on a daily basis by rowdy, reckless, inconsiderate tourists from all walks of society and it is reprehensible. These drunken groups of ‘bros’ who scream and shout in public, make an unholy mess, ignore warning signs and do whatever the heck they want to without giving a crap about consequences piss me off. Even the fact that the Manjummel Boys trashed the car, drove me up the wall. It is very hard to root for louts who are guilty of this kind of conduct. And I don’t see why we have to gloss over this because a disaster of their own making overtook one of their own. The fact that we keep overlooking gross deeds to paint ourselves as sympathetic, bleeding heart liberals is the reason Incredible India is treated worse than a public latrine by a great majority who feel free to void their bowels and bladders in public spaces. And don’t tell me it is because there are more temples than toilets in India. Seriously, why do we have to excuse the inexcusable?\n\nIn a comment above BR got pulled up for praising a film like Animal and not getting orgasmic over this one. Since I am guilty of the same, I will add that I liked Animal more for its honesty. Period. I saw it as a no holds barred take on the innate ugliness of the male ego which masks ridiculous levels of insecurity with even more ridiculous levels of bombast. And no, I haven’t watched Sandeep Vanga’s interviews etc. In my view, it is hardly necessary. He offered up his movie for public consumption and I will judge the movie alone based on how I interpreted it. With Manjummel Boys, again, I find it unnecessary to track down interviews etc. of the director or the real life characters involved. As it stands, enormous chunks of the movie don’t work. At all. Most of the characters felt like extras as BR pointed out, and the writing was broad, unwieldy and amateurish. It was touching to see a brave, unassuming soul risk his life to save a friend but I draw the line at worshipping on the altar of foolishness in any form. Yuck!! But I get why it is so relatable to so many. However, it didn’t really work for me.\n\nJust watched this movie. Gripping and also entertaining. Almost flawless. I got angry at them for breaking the rules and I also empathised with them for their helplessness. Cant compare this film with other movies. Loved the way the film showed what happened after the marathon rescue. Watched in tamil. Thank god there was no heroine and a song with her. Even that song after rescue was not needed. That took away the seriousness of the moment.\n\nBy the way, if we dont break the rules, there wont be any innovation happening. Humans are divided into risk takers and status quoists. While Subhash accidentally fell without asking for risks, his friend Kuttan took the real risk and did not give up until he got Subhash to safety. His friends did not abandon the mission due to friendship or just to be with others in their hour of trial.\n\nWatched this today and just loved it. Especially because there’s a personal connection to most of the people like me who went to Kodaikanal with a group of adventurous friends. I instantly went looking into my old albums and started looking at these group images, such was the heartfelt camaraderie in the movie. Even reminded of the suicide points and I instantly thought of how my friends sat at the edges of hanging rocks for a picture, leave aside the caves. The boys deserved the benefit of doubt. Cave exploration is a mesmerizing for many and breaking natural barriers is kind of natural for college youth. I call bullshit if someone says it’s a Malayali drunkard trope.\n\nProbably this movie was made with such a high quality that it almost killed my interest in million dollar budget Hollywood movie. Malayalis are making movies at a different level wrt the kind of subjects and the no-nonsense approach to filmmaking. The way this movie portrayed a disaster is masterly. Take for eg. how they showed Subash falling into pit in 5 seconds but was very impactful. While some of the emotions were OTT, they gelled well because the meat in the core story is very less and the rest needed fillers. The visual setup was such a good quality that the shortcomings in the writing could be easily ignored.\n\nI wished they put lot more fiction into this, but they gave us something that we are missing in a busy life. A world of best friends. That itself is satisfying enough."
