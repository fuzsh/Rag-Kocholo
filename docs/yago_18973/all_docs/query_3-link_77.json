        "text": "Besides excavations, evidence of Tamil antiquity is preserved in written records, such as literature, inscriptions, and palm leaf manuscripts in one form or the other. Efforts were made constantly to alter the perceptions of the past into new forms while contesting to foreign influences of many kinds. To synthesize the indigenous past from these textual sources, however, one must first have a deep understanding of them and apply appropriate inter-textual research methods. This often involves sifting through many pieces of evidence and distinguishing between foreign and native Tamil elements. In most cases, one can find a trajectory from one point in history to the other through changes that might have taken place gradually to change the indigenous perceptions to foreign. Without a sense of historiography and efforts to record history in the past, one is obligated to read in between lines and make connections where necessary. To cite an example, indigenous Tamil rituals have always been one of the significant pieces of evidence to trace Tamils' history and we find many forms of them through various means, including archeological, inscriptional, and literary. The term tiruppatiyam viṇṇappañceytal (cf. SII2 No. 65), is recorded in many Tamil inscriptions to denote Tamil's indigenous form of ritual in parallel to Sanskrit rituals during the medieval period. Subsequently, this term leads one to other related terms such as kaḻañcu poṉ, taḷiccērip peṇṭir, ōtuvār, paṇṭāram, pūcāri and so on and so forth to attribute to the dialogues of Tamils' antiquity. In Sangam literary texts we attest evidence of Tamil's rituals in the form of folk deities with special connotations of vēlan veṟiyayar, veṟiyāṭṭam (cf. Kuruntokai 53, 360), vēlan ēttum veṟi (Paripāṭal 5-15) and others. Thus, one is tempted to trace the trajectory and analyze the dialogues over the change of perceptions belonging to the ancient past to a newly introduced form of tiruppatiyam viṇṇappañceytal or tiruppatiyam pāṭutal. (see Renganathan 2021 for a detailed account of these terms and the later development of the concept of Tamil Arccanai). Thus, these terms and the cultural nuances associated with them become the cultural clue to trace the history of the Tamils. What is significant to note is that such terms form the consolidated pieces of evidence to be correlated with other evidence from literary and archeological evidence. Along these lines, this paper aims at capturing both cultural and literary evidence that can be treated as the base for tracing the history of the Tamils through change in perceptions. As for literary sources, it will be attempted how the imageries and artifacts as employed in Sangam period transitioned through the medieval and modern periods. Specifically, it examines the literary sources from the Sangam and medieval periods to explore how the use of the objects such as Āḷi and ñāḻaṛ pū reflect a shift from a secular to a religious perspective. By using these inscriptional and literary evidence to track historical trajectories and the change in perceptions that occurred throughout, one can contribute to parallel research in the fields of archeology, numismatics, and other relevant fields by shedding light on the historical changes of the ancient past.\n\nThis paper shows how the existence and the culture of the Tamil tribe in the city of Medan. Given the city of Medan is known for its diversity with various tribes and religions and one of them is the Tamil Tribe community. Using a qualitative approach, data were collected through interviews with informants who are Tamil tribes in the city of Medan. The results of this paper indicate that the existence of the culture of the Tamil tribe can be described from several cultural elements that they have, namely language, kinship system, knowledge system, life equipment, arts, livelihood, and religious systems. Through this cultural element, Tamil people residing in the city of Medan began to adapt and adapt to the environment and cultural diversity in the city of Medan. This can be seen from the shifts and changes that occur in the cultural elements of the Tamil tribe. These changes are influenced by several factors which in this paper are divided into internal factors and external factors."
