        "text": "Career\n\nJai Akash, a Tamilian of Sri Lankan origin settled in London, sent his modelling photographs to the \"Star Search\" service run by Suhasini's entertainment portal website TamilTalkies.com during the late 1990s. K. Balachander when casting a new actor to portray a small role in Rojavanam (1999), used the \"Star Search\" platform and selected Akash to be in the film.[2]\n\nJai Akash began his career with . His first film in Telugu, Anandam, was directed by Sreenu Vaitla and produced by Ramoji Rao. He acted in four Telugu films, before he returned to Tamil and played the lead in Inidhu Inidhu Kadhal Inidhu (2003) opposite Neha, which was a remake of Anandam, also produced by Ramoji Rao. In 2004, he teamed up with Sreenu Vaitla again in Anandamanandamaye. He also starred six Tamil films between 2004 and 2005 Ramakrishna, Kicha Vayasu 16, Gurudeva, Sevvel, Amudhey and Kaatrullavarai. That year, he also starred in eight Tamil films, but the films either remained unreleased or had a delayed release and went on become commercial failures and his career was dubbed \"jinxed\".[3][4] Furthermore during the initial stage of his career, several films were announced but discontinued including Onnum Onnum Naalu co-starring Mallika and Fair and Lovely alongside Madhumitha.[5]\n\nJai Akash returned to the Telugu film industry and acted in three films produced by Mega Super Good Films Andala Ramudu (2006), Nava Vasantham (2007) and Gorintaku (2008).\n\nIn 2013, Akash starred in the film Anandam Arambam, the sequel to Anandam.[6][7] In 2016, he bought the distribution rights of a low-budget film called Oruthal.[8] In January 2017, he began work on a film titled Aama Naan Porukkithaan, where he would appear in five different roles.[9]\n\nIn Telugu, his next film are Donga Prema followed in Tamil, Oruthal (2016), Aama Naan Porukkithan (2017) and Chennai 2 Bangkok (2019).\n\nControversy\n\nIn 2005, Jai Akash's Guru Deva released and Akash was appreciated for his acting, but the film didn't become a commercial success. The Telugu dubbed version of the film, Guru, also failed with Muppa Ankanna Rao, the executive producer of the version, failing to promote the film. Akash complained at the producer council, that his film was killed by the producer purposely.\n\nIn 2009, Jai Akash filed a complaint to the Nadigar Sangam against actress Sunaina for not giving dates to complete his film \"Madhan\". He brought Sunaina from Telugu film industry as a new comer to Tamil film industry and allowed her to act in \"Kadhazhil Vizunthen\", while she was on his contract, but Sunaina demanded more payment after the success of her film.[10] Denying such reports, Jai Akash complained that Sunaina doesn't have any gratitude as he is the one that introduced her into the Tamil film industry and that he allowed her to act in Kadhalil Vizhunthen (2008) when she was in his contract. But, after the film became hit, she is not giving him dates to finish his film.[11]"
