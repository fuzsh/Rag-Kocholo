His political and diplomatic efforts and military exploits in that struggle have been extensively researched in India and in Southeast Asia and published. With the passage of time, his sacrifices and determined efforts will become legendary to young Indians and eventually fade from their memory. What has not been distilled from his voluminous writings, speeches and exhortations about the social, economic and inter-racial and religious problems of India and Indian society, would be worth further researching. Ms Nilanjana Sengupta has in her publication touched on some of the societal problems that concerned Bose and how he sought to address them from his early times, while he was engaged in leading the Municipal Corporation of Calcutta and while profiling himself actively as a budding freedom fighter. Ms Sengupta has drawn attention to his efforts to forge HinduMuslim unity; his interest in the emancipation of Indian women; and his attempts to prevent the exploitation of peasants and workers in India, among other issues. What comes to the fore from this research is his inexhaustible concern for the variety of social and economic problems that afflicted Indian society and cried out for redress. ix\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 9\n\n2/13/12 9:12:53 AM\n\nForeword\n\nMs Sengupta has discovered in the course of her research how Bose took the opportunity, while establishing his Indian National Army and the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, to consider the possibility of translating some of his beliefs and ideas and trying them out, among the men and women in the two military organizations that he established in Southeast Asia. This book by Ms Sengupta should help stir memories in India, if not in the state of West Bengal, to encourage further research and understanding from his writings and speeches, the views he expressed for addressing India’s economic and societal problems, and consider which of them would be worthy of trying out in the context of today’s India. S. R. Nathan Sixth President of Singapore 6 February 2012\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 10\n\n2/13/12 9:12:53 AM\n\nMESSAGE\n\nMost Indian families of my generation in Singapore and Malaysia would have had some connection with Subhas Chandra Bose and his struggle for India’s independence through the Indian National Army. Even after World War II had ended, and for many years later, Bose’s picture took pride of place in our homes. Following my assumption of duty as Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in 2002, I had several conversations with then-President S.R. Nathan. He noted that, while there were many accounts of Bose’s life and wartime exploits, his legacy had not been explored sufficiently and written about. Mr Nathan hoped that this would be done. It was against this background that I decided to commission a book on Bose which would highlight his contributions to the emergence of nationalist movements in Southeast Asia. I also wanted the book to show how Bose had affected the lives of ordinary men and women living in Malaya. About ten months ago, I came to know Nilanjana Sengupta. I discussed the idea of her writing the book. Coming from Calcutta, Bose’s home town, she had a first-hand feel for the subject in the larger Indian context. What she needed was knowledge of developments in and around Southeast Asia. Reading voraciously, she came up to speed on the subject and completed writing the book in a record ten months. Although this book is very well xi\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 11\n\n2/13/12 9:12:53 AM\n\nxii\n\nMessage\n\nresearched, it is written engagingly for both the scholar and the layman. It brings to life an epic period of Singapore and Malayan history through the iconic figure of Bose and the legacy that he so richly left behind. I would like to express my appreciation to Nilanjana for working so assiduously on a legendary personality who remains enshrined in the hearts and minds of many. I would also like to thank Rinkoo Bhowmik, another daughter of Calcutta, and the staff of ISEAS Publications Unit for all the hard work they have put into the production of this book. K. Kesavapany Director, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 12\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nMESSAGE\n\nNilanjana Sengupta casts her net widely in this ambitious volume exploring the post-war impact of Subhas Chandra Bose on Southeast Asia. Because the study of Bose has been extensively explored by generations of scholars, Sengupta necessarily addresses some familiar ground. Throughout the volume we hear echoes of his early spiritualism, secularism and egalitarianism. We hear also references to his mother’s worship — extending to Bharat Mata [Mother India] — and his fostering of women’s political and military roles, in for example his creation of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. We encounter again his early political role in Calcutta and its extension to his relations with Gandhi and the Congress, preparing him for an even larger stage in Southeast Asia. We shift to Burma and Malaya and the embryonic nationalism there in the 1920s under colonial rule and a discussion of the Japanese alliance. Subsequently, for a while the scene shifts to the Red Fort Trials in India and their impact on the British Indian army spread across Southeast Asia. Sengupta discusses Bose’s communication and propaganda techniques, his modern understanding of the mechanisms of mass communication, including his awareness of his personal impact. His emotional and absolute commitment to the goal of military liberation was a significant ingredient of his mesmerizing impact xiii\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 13\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nxiv\n\nMessage\n\non audiences. The Rebellion of 1857 and the martyrdom of the Rani of Jhansi helped to foster his conviction that the military paradigm was imperative. Sengupta forges new ground in her discussion of Bose’s post-war impact on Southeast Asian leadership, the growth of nationalism, and the burgeoning labour union movement. Throughout Southeast Asia, political organizations such as the MPAJA and labour unions grew in each country, as Sengupta details. The consequence was that British and Dutch post-war attempts to reassert their colonial rule were thwarted by resurgent nationalism. The experience of INA veterans, the personal example of Bose’s leadership, and the body of officers trained by the Japanese gave the colonial powers a rude awakening. Southeast Asian nationalism was now an established force in Southeast Asia. Historians will welcome Sengupta’s contribution to our understanding of Bose’s continuing impact on the political landscape of Southeast Asia. Joyce C. Lebra Professor Emerita, University of Colorado\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 14\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nPreface\n\nFor me it all started with meeting three little old men at an Udipi restaurant on Serangoon Road, Singapore. Bala A. Chandran, Girish Kothari and Kishore Bhattacharya — all three in their eighties, with one of them having undergone an intestinal surgery in the recent past. I was chasing an article for a newspaper in Bombay for which I had already missed the deadline. As they filed in, refusing assistance from the young Tamil waitress and started speaking of their INA (Indian National Army) days, I noticed an unmistakable straightening of the shoulders and an Ancient Mariner like glitter in their eyes: it was that momentary transformation which sparked my interest in their story. Was it the easy camaraderie of old boys speaking of their alma mater? Around the same time I read another story of Laxmi Indira Panda of Orissa who had joined the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. After many frustrating trips down the corridors of power, she finally met the President of India when in her nineties. As she walked down the carpeted corridors of Rashtrapati Bhawan, she stopped to salute the pictures of national leaders. What was it about these men and women, I wondered, that made them less ordinary? The 1940s was a decade of violence and trauma for Southeast Asian communities, as it was for the rest of the world. It began with the mass exodus of Burmese-Indian refugees in the face of Japanese invasion, witnessed the tragedy of Hiroshima and xv\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 15\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nNagasaki — the only nuclear holocausts the world has known and the ruthless massacre of the Chinese communities as they faced the fury of Japan’s wartime atrocities. The war, when it finally ended, had systematically torn apart indigenous ecosystems of culture and tradition, of old habits and communal practices. The INA, as a movement, placed a motley group of individuals against this bleak terrain. Remarkably, it was a group that transcended barriers of caste, religion or race. Even the small crosssection at Singapore that I had the opportunity to meet consisted of expatriate Indians from the far-flung states of Kerala, Gujarat and undivided Bengal. Those who enlisted for the army were similarly widely diverse in their economic and educational backgrounds: just as there was a Ponnampalam who enlisted from a plantation at Seramban where he dried rubber sheets on a clothes line, there was also an S. A. Ayer, Reuter’s Special Correspondent in Bangkok. These men and women’s lives intersected for a brief while during the years 1943 to 1945 and at the end of the war the network unraveled again, even as life limped back to normalcy. Once the INA was disbanded, the former soldiers pursued divergent career paths: John A. Thivy founded the Malayan National Congress and worked as a diplomat in his later life, Janaki Davar travelled to London to work at the Indian High Commission and then returned to Malaysia and a career in politics and then there was also an L. Krishnan who joined Shaw Brothers and pioneered Malay film production. Yet the INA experience — the learning and memories, remained with them like an omnipotent alter ego. At times the past found manifestation in little physical gestures — like the Jai Hind with which the INA community greet each other even today and at times returned in haunting nightmares of near-fatal airattacks (in his memoirs M. Z. Kiani wrote of the nightmares that plagued him for many months after his return from the front). During the period of occupation, Japanese-trained voluntary and independent armies dotted almost every region of Southeast\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 16\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\nAsia. Militant bands of men sporting uniforms and carrying weapons were ubiquitous in Burma, Java, Sumatra, Malaya, Indochina and the Philippines. The Japanese had raised these armies over a period of time — while the BIA (Burma Independence Army) of Burma had been raised before the outbreak of war in the Pacific, PETA (Sukarela Tentara Pembela Tanah Air) in Java was created only in October 1943. The range and quality of training offered to these armies had also differed — unlike the voluntary armies of Malaya or Indonesia, the INA and BIA had been trained by graduates of the Japanese Army Intelligence School, the Nakano Gakko. But here too the INA was remarkable in being the only army which enjoyed military status and fought alongside the Japanese as her ally.1 If the INA and its men were remarkable then it was a reflection of the leader, Subhas Chandra Bose, a major source of the veterans’ perception of life. He was a man who had marched to the beat of a different drummer — at a time when the Indian political scene was dominated by Gandhi, he had distanced himself from the “authoritarianism” of the Gandhian movement and sought an alliance with the Axis Powers to press forward the independence struggle of his country.2 He had escaped the confining political space of India and used Southeast Asia as a sounding board for his alternate viewpoint. He had united the contentious Indians and led them on a hitherto unknown path of armed struggle: Indians, forcibly disarmed by the British since the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 (and the Singapore Mutiny of 1915), took to armed resistance against the British after the lapse of many decades. Bose is a leader who still arouses extreme emotions — to some he is a martyr and to others a quisling. His image too oscillates between fields of reality and the distortion thereof: even on my last visit to Netaji Research Bureau, Calcutta, in August 2011, I met a gentleman claiming Bose was alive and continued to reside in the high mountain passes of Russia!\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 17\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\nFor independent India, Subhas Chandra Bose had envisaged the political model of a secular, democratic, federal republic. During his presidential address at the Maharashtra Provincial Conference of May 1928, he had argued that though democracy was an occidental institution, it was not alien to the culture of India and cited examples of early models of democracy which had historically existed in the country: Speaking for myself, I stand for an independent Federal Republic … India must fulfill her own destiny and cannot be content with colonial self-government. … While striving to attain liberty we have to note all its implications. … You cannot establish political democracy and endeavour at the same time to resist the democratization of the society. … Privileges based on birth, caste or creed should go, and equal opportunities should be thrown open to all …3\n\nThe vision of an independent India with no state religion and based on equal opportunities for all was important to Bose and he was wary of any possible encroachments. In the early 1940s when the possibility of the INA marching into India at the head of the Japanese Imperial Army arose, he was careful in striking a deal with his allies. He insisted that the first drop of blood to be shed on Indian soil should be of a freedom-loving Indian and refused to walk on the proffered “stilts” of Japanese aid.4 Bose was chary of the Japanese because of earlier Sino-Japan relations, on which he had commented that in attempting to satisfy her “imperial ambitions”, Japan was wont to expand “at the expense of China”. “The vastness”, he wrote, “the potential richness, and the internal weakness of China, constitutes the greatest temptation for Japan”: qualities, which he was aware, were equally true for the Indian subcontinent as well.5 In his search for an economic model that would institute complete, all-round undiluted freedom, a socio-economic structure\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 18\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\nand body-politic that would bring maximum happiness, Bose was convinced he had found the answer in Socialism. Socialism by providing every human being with the right to work, the right to a living wage and equal opportunities for all could ensure a fair, just and equitable distribution of wealth. And for this if necessary the State could take over control of the means of production and distribution of wealth.6 As a political philosophy for free India he sought a synthesis of the “national unity and solidarity” of Fascism (he called it “National Socialism” and mentioned what he sought was distinct from what had been achieved in contemporary Germany) with the “planned economy of Communism”.7 In his later years he amended his views on democracy and felt for the immediate future of post-independent India, it was necessary to institute a State with some authoritative powers “… a State of an authoritarian character, which will work as an organ, or as the servant of the masses, and not of a clique or of a few rich individuals.”8 Once India had achieved a stable social, political and economic framework based on justice, equality, freedom, discipline and love, a government in accordance with the “will of the people” would be instituted. In my explorations of this enigmatic leader, there are a few images, amongst others, of which I am particularly fond. One is from his early manhood when he was the favourite Rangakakababu [uncle] to his brood of young nephews and nieces: he listened to them with such serious intent that they felt they were adults speaking to a friend. This image reflects Bose’s very genuine compassion for the people around him and his ability to relate to them — qualities which would win him the love of the multitudes in Southeast Asia. The other picture is of Bose in his mid-thirties, when he was exiled to Europe during 1933–34. His friends noticed him purchasing books on India in languages that he could not read: this almost obsessive passion for India would remain with him and drive him all his life. The last image\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 19\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nxx\n\nPreface\n\nis more poignant: Habibur Rahman, narrates the last few hours of Bose’s life spent in a Japanese hospital at Taipei. The leader was convinced his end was near and told Habib that he had no regrets apart from not being able to witness his country attain freedom. Habib should go and tell his countrymen that he had fought for India’s independence till his last breath.9 Apart from the theme of sacrificial patriotism, these words reiterate a recurring motif of his speeches and writings — that of being true to one’s pledge, of not breaching a promise. A Gentleman’s Word is about this promise that Subhas Chandra Bose made to the Indian people of Southeast Asia who had placed their love and trust in his hands. The book looks beyond the ubiquitous garlanded portrait of the leader and attempts an analysis and assessment of all that he left behind. At an individual level it looks at certain personalities like Aung San and Ahmad Boestamam who were influenced by his ideology as they continued their nation’s struggle against colonialism. For the expatriate Indian community of Southeast Asia, the book traces the evolution of certain movements like those fostered by the emerging Indian trade unions and the Malayan Indian Congress which would help shape the community’s socio-political future in the years to come. The book devotes considerable space to the issues of feminism that the Rani of Jhansi Regiment helped nurture. At a wider level, it captures some of the highlights of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind’s [Free India] intercommunal relations with Burma, Malaya, Thailand and Japan. Subhas Chandra Bose, in his first public appearance in Singapore on 4 July 1943, had mentioned: By participation in this common fight, we shall be qualifying for our freedom. By shedding our blood in a sacred cause, we shall be paying the price of liberty and, at the same time, we\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 20\n\n2/13/12 9:12:54 AM\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\nshall be laying the only enduring foundation for our national unity. And last but not least, by winning freedom through our own efforts and sacrifice, we shall be acquiring the strength whereby we shall preserve our liberty for all time.10\n\nA Gentleman’s Word tells the tale of this journey of self-discovery of those who were inspired by him.\n\nNotes 1.

Since February 2011, which is when I started working on this book in all seriousness, I have met countless people, most of whom have become friends or at least close acquaintances. There was nobody I approached with details of the project, who did not reciprocate in all earnestness, and with each encounter my book was enriched with a new layer of understanding. On top of the list is K. Kesavapany, Director of ISEAS, who gave new meaning and direction to my life by offering me this project: it was he who set me off on this wonderful journey and encouraged me at every turn. I was overwhelmed when S. R. Nathan, former President of Singapore, agreed to actually read my manuscript. His critical marginal notes and the discussions he had with me gave me new insight. He even very kindly shared books from his personal collection with me. I met Krishna Bose, Chairperson, Netaji Research Bureau (NRB), Calcutta, twice over the course of the year and each time was an experience — Subhas Chandra Bose still resides over a large part of her consciousness and I could feel his palpable presence when I spoke to her. Her very illustrious son, Sugata Bose, Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs, Harvard University, and author of some wonderful books, set aside time from his very busy schedule and spent two long afternoons at NRB with me. As I heard his measured tone xxiii\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 23\n\n2/13/12 9:12:55 AM\n\nxxiv\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nand analysis of historical events and continuities, I could not resist anxiety pangs at my own temerity in deciding to research the same subject on which he had dwelled so knowledgeably and for so many years. During the year I shared a warm, albeit long-distance relationship with Joyce Chapman Lebra, Professor Emerita, University of Colorado, who was kind enough to read my initial project proposal and later clarified doubts and answered queries. Then there were the INA (Indian National Army) and Rani of Jhansi veterans. Despite their advanced years they were eager and energetic in sharing with me details of that period of their lives which they unanimously claim to be the most glorious. We rendezvoused at restaurants and residences and each time I came away fired by their enthusiasm for their leader. Today if Malaysia feels like a second home to me it is because of people like Rasammah Bhupalan, Dominic Puthucheary and Janaki Athi Nahappan who live there. The latter and her son, Ishwar Nahappan, welcomed me into their home and we spent a whole weekend ruminating and thumbing through her old albums. My guruji, Swami Muktirupanandaji and Swami Samachittanandaji of Ramakrishna Mission, Singapore, freely shared information and books from the RK Mission library. My friends at ISEAS — Tansen Sen, Head, Nalanda-Sriwijaya Centre, Geoffrey Wade, Senior Visiting Research Fellow, Asad-ul Iqbal Latif, Visiting Research Fellow — gave me a crucial sense of academic comradeship even as I spent many solitary hours at the ISEAS library. Rinkoo Bhowmik very kindly agreed to do the artwork for the cover and helped me in innumerable different ways in putting the finishing touches to the book while Madan Kunnavakkam added an interesting new dimension with his photographs. I had very perceptive editors in Triena Ong and Sheryl Sin who steered the project towards its logical conclusion. There were others — Johan Saravanamuttu, Norshahril Saat, Christina Goh, Desmond Yong\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 24\n\n2/13/12 9:12:55 AM\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxxv\n\nof ISEAS and others — numerous staff members and librarians of Netaji Research Bureau, ISEAS and the National Library, Singapore who contributed to making this book what it is today. And of course there was my loving family — my husband, Arindam, who smilingly welcomed Subhas Chandra Bose as the fourth member of our household and our eight-year-old daughter Ananya. Once in a while she tiptoed into my study to express her concern about my long working hours and then, closing the door with infinite care, left to watch some more television — much to my consternation! May the merits of this book be shared by all I have or have not mentioned above while the inadvertent flaws and follies come to my share.\n\n00 GentlemanWord.indd 25\n\n2/13/12 9:12:55 AM\n\nChapter 1\n\nA JOURNEY: A DREAM\n\n“… Come my friends, ‘Tis not too late to seek a newer world. … To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die.” — Ulysses, Alfred Tennyson\n\nPrelude On 9 February 1943 Subhas Chandra Bose embarked on an undisclosed journey on a submarine, as a guest of the German navy. As he set off on this eastward journey he was unaware that he would not survive the war or that he was swiftly moving towards what would turn out to be the final phase of his life. His sole companion was an aide, Abid Hasan, a young nationalist who had joined Bose in his military mission in Berlin and would continue to work closely with him in Southeast Asia. Like other young, educated men who had thrown in their lot with Bose and the Indian nationalist cause in Europe, Hasan, a Hyderabadi Muslim, was part of a small, politically inclined Indian diaspora.1 Their journey together would span the next three months, first\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 1\n\n2/13/12 9:13:25 AM\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nin German and then Japanese submarines. Hasan writes that as he stepped aboard the German U-boat, the envisaged “romance” of travelling by a submarine fast dissipated: Bose was allotted a bunk in an unenclosed recess in the passage and the “stench of diesel” permeated the air.2 They travelled through the North Sea, the strait south of Iceland, navigated around the Cape of Good Hope and after a hazardous submarine-to-submarine transfer off the coast of Madagascar, finally landed at an isolated islet near Sumatra on 6 May 1943. The trajectory would take Bose half way across the globe and he would arrive at Southeast Asia to spearhead the Indian nationalist struggle and lead the community to a new age of political consciousness. This was not Bose’s first expedition to Southeast Asia. In 1925 he had been detained at Mandalay, as a political prisoner of the British Raj — one of the many terms of captivity he served as an integral part of his tumultuous political career. The Mandalay prison, where Bal Gangadhar Tilak had spent six long years of captivity, was notorious in its reputation. Bose, confined in this wooden prison for over two years, was not only exposed to the dust and storms of Burma but also caught a first-hand glimpse of the Burmese people. With characteristic dry wit he observed to his brother Sarat Chandra Bose, “The wards in this jail are made of wooden bars or palisades and are not brick built. I am sure when we are locked in at night, to an outsider we look like so many human beasts prowling about in a lighted cage ... God only knows where our metamorphosis is going to end.”3 It was during this period of incarceration, with typhoid and sand-fly fever raging among the inmates that Bose had picked up the rudiments of the Burmese language and decided that “… Burma is a marvellous country”. He admired the considerably advanced social system of Burma where “women were more powerful than in any European country”, their indigenous education system\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 2\n\n2/13/12 9:13:25 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\nand folk art and wondered when the Burmese people, like the Indians, would be free once again.4 When setting off for Southeast Asia, his wife Emilie Schenkl came to Berlin to bid him goodbye. They had had a long and committed relationship for the previous nearly ten years and their daughter, Anita, was barely a few months old.5 For a person like Bose, wont to form enduring bonds with family and friends alike, this parting must have been quite a wrench. But then, he was used to making emotional sacrifices for his cause. He had already lost his father while exiled in Europe in 1934 and shortly afterwards was to lose his mother while leading the nationalist campaign in Southeast Asia.6 The journey to the Southeast was kept under wraps till the very last minute. Clandestine arrangements had been underway for several months with even Hasan being unaware of the developments. When told that he was to leave with Bose for an unknown destination, he had surmised that he was being sent to Mecca for a haj pilgrimage to form contacts with the Indians there. It was only when they arrived at Kiel that he realized that there were other plans afoot. This would again ring a familiar bell. Bose’s previous secret getaway to Europe via Kabul and the Soviet Union had been similarly shrouded in mystery. In 1941 when he eluded the British police and escaped from Calcutta, while interned at his residence, nobody apart from a select few of his family coterie knew of his whereabouts.7 The next day’s Hindustan Standard had carried a double column headline: “What has happened to Shri Subhas Chandra Bose? Unexpected exit from home”, even as international press and the British police got into a major furore for the next few days over his unexpected disappearance.8 In fact in a life intercepted by many journeys, the one to Southeast Asia was not an exceptional one at all. One of the first\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 3\n\n2/13/12 9:13:25 AM\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\njourneys of his life had been from his native town of Cuttack in Orissa to Calcutta to study at the Presidency College. By then he was an assiduous reader of Swami Vivekananda and as he moved to the seething metropolis, he promised himself, “I was not going to follow a beaten track, come what may; I was going to lead a life conducive to my spiritual welfare and uplift of humanity.”9 Even as he was moving from the easy familiarity of his hometown to the anonymity of city life, he was undertaking a parallel journey in his mind towards a better understanding of the self and a firmer hold of his convictions. The same convictions and a need for a higher purpose in life would drive him to study Sri Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda while still in his teens and set him apart from the crowd of the city. In his unfinished autobiography, The Indian Pilgrim, he himself acknowledges this with self-deprecatory humour: he writes of a reception for Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose where much to his repugnance young participants put up an English play and even sang “God save the King” in honour of the famous scientist, “Amongst a gathering of boisterous young men, I sat with my eyes closed like a stern puritan.”10 Chronologically reviewed, the next vital journey of his life would be the one he made to Europe to continue his studies at Cambridge and to sit for the qualifying exam of the Indian Civil Service. It was in England, even as his severely anti-British mind was full of misgivings about the imminent career choice, Subhas for the first time breathed the air of a free country. It dawned on him what it meant to be free citizens of a free republic, to live outside the police regime of India where every student was a “revolutionary suspect”.11 But in terms of moving closer to his dream of assimilating himself in the freedom struggle raging in India, perhaps his return journey from Cambridge was of more significance. It was by the time of this journey that he had shaken\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 4\n\n2/13/12 9:13:25 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\noff all indecision and emerged as a man of destiny. He had already tossed aside the career option in a foreign bureaucracy and decided to commit himself wholeheartedly to his cause. Albeit the decision had not come easy: he had spent months grappling guilt, “I know how many hearts I have grieved — how many superiors of mine I have disobeyed. But on the eve of this hazardous undertaking my only prayer is — may it be for the good of our dear country.”12 He had already written to his would-be political guru, Chittaranjan Das, from Cambridge and on the homewardbound ship he mulled over the possible strategies for the Indian National Congress, “In my view the Congress-League scheme is entirely out-of-date. We must now frame the Constitution of India on the basis of Swaraj [self-rule] … I am of the view that right from now when the work of destruction is going on, we must begin to create.”13 Even as his young, enthusiastic mind bubbled over with ideas, many of which he would eventually implement in India and thereafter in the Southeast, the die had been cast — from here onwards with each journey he would move further away from all that was familiar and yet each step would bring him closer to self-actualization. From this return journey home from Cambridge in 1921 to his final exodus to first Kabul, Moscow and onward to Europe under the guise of Orlando Mazzotta with an Italian passport was a long gap of twenty years. In the meantime he had risen to become a political leader of national repute in India, his career as the young radical in the Congress had gone through many twists and turns even as he realized co-functioning with the more conservative Gandhi conformists was virtually impossible. When all else failed Bose had tried to build up a clandestine nexus with the various factions of the Axis Powers. From late 1938 he tried to reach out to Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet-directed Comintern. Between the years 1933 and 1938, he had met German\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 5\n\n2/13/12 9:13:25 AM\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nand Italian officials during his visits to Europe, though he had been denied a visa to the Soviet Union. On 22 December 1938 he met the Nazi officer, Dr O. Urchs in Bombay. He was aware of the evils of Nazism; however in his realpolitik view, Germany was the only power which could confront the British. The Japanese as the war allies of the Germans were another potential ally to whom Bose sent out feelers. As he set off on his long trek to Germany in 1941, Bose by now in his fourth decade was already half way to becoming a legend. He had set aside an eminent career in the ICS and pressed himself to the service of his country. Added to this was his flawless academic record, his humanitarian work at the time of floods and famines in India, his popular appeal with the youth and minorities of his country and the unprecedented second victory as the Congress President. All these factors had figured in giving him an almost super-human aura, a reputation akin to that of a mythological hero. His secret and perilous escape to Europe amidst the greatest war known to humankind in an attempt to carry the nationalist struggle outside the borders of India would further reinforce this reputation. In Germany he would raise the Azad Hind Fauj [Free India Army]: an army formed of British Indian prisoners-of-war captured during Rommel’s blitzkrieg in North Africa who would be trained by the Germans and wear the German uniform and yet swear an oath of allegiance to their leader, Subhas Chandra Bose. They would march to the tunes of a Hindustani adaptation of Tagore’s “Jana gana mana” and would fly the Congress tricolour with a springing tiger evocative of a certain Indian pride and aggression as their emblem.14 And perhaps more importantly, hereafter Bose would be addressed as “Netaji”, the Indian equivalent of a respected leader. The epithet coined by his own men would give him a specific Indian term of reference.

Bose’s close-to-mythical reputation, the legends and symbols surrounding his every act of patriotic sacrifice would reach their climax in Southeast Asia. The foundation of the political and military model that had already been laid at the Indian Legion in Germany would be played out to its logical conclusion on the other side of the globe. But as Bose, accompanied by Hasan, headed to Southeast Asia with the news of Hitler waging war against Soviet Russia and the Axis disintegration hanging heavy in the air, there were certain things which set this journey apart from all the others he had undertaken in the past. For one, right from the time they switched to the more spacious Japanese submarine commanded by Captain Izu, there was a feeling of elation and home-coming: “… we did feel that we had come back to an Asian nation … it was something akin to a home-coming. We could be less formal … the food was entirely to our liking.”15 After their landing as well, Bose achieved quite a few early successes. On the submarine Bose had allowed himself little rest as he clocked in his usual long hours of work, rigorously preparing himself for his role in the Southeast Asian theatre and his first encounter with the Japanese Premier. Hasan reminiscences of the elaborate sessions of role-play Bose conducted, with him taking the part of the Japanese Prime Minister Tojo. Bose would leave for Tokyo almost as soon as he reached the island of Sabang in Indonesia and eventually meet General Tojo on 10 June 1943 at the Japanese capital. The latter was impressed with Bose and on 16 June at a session of the Imperial Diet pledged “everything possible” to help India wrest her freedom.16 Unlike Berlin where Bose was increasingly getting the feeling that he was being used as a bait to create pressure on the British and had to wait till the very end for\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 7\n\n2/13/12 9:13:25 AM\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\na meeting with Hitler, a meeting which did not yield any concrete results apart from a promise of transport to Asia, in Asia it did not take Bose too long to garner the unreserved backing of the Japanese Prime Minister.17 Whereas in Europe, Mussolini’s Foreign Minister, Count Ciano noted in his diary with obvious scepticism: “I received Bose, head of the Indian insurgent movement. He would like the Axis to make a declaration on the independence of India, but in Berlin his proposals have been received with a great deal of reserve.”18 Despite Bose’s repeated proposals, a firm German declaration supporting Indian independence had eluded him. Bose had managed to achieve the establishment of a propaganda centre called the Free India Centre where radio scripts had been prepared in more than half a dozen Indian languages which were then broadcast by a powerful German transmitter. But in a turn of events, in the eastern theatre of his nationalist campaign, Bose would first take over the formal leadership of the Indian Independence League (IIL) and the Indian National Army (INA) from the ageing Indian revolutionary, Rashbehari Bose and then on 21 October 1943 would officially proclaim the Provisional Government of Free India at the Cathay Theatre in Singapore. In the space of those first few months he would also initiate the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, the first all-women army for the national cause. The sense of home-coming in Asia was perhaps reaffirmed by the presence of a large Indian diaspora in the Southeast. The Indian community of Burma, Malaya, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, milled around Bose in tumultuous ovation as thousands came forward in response to his call of “Total Mobilisation for Total War”. There was another factor, which contributed to a sense of familiarity — the Ramakrishna Mission at Norris Road, Singapore. Here Bose would spend long hours in meditation away from the war raging outside.19 As he once again faced his\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 8\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\nchildhood idols, Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, it was almost as if Bose had completed a full circle and putting his past behind him was poised at an imperative juncture of his life. But even as he prepared to pitch himself into the Asian theatre of the war, which would eventually stretch on for many years to come and prove to be longer and perhaps even more complex than the one in Europe, providence would surely have smiled at the irony of it all. For Bose, despite his best efforts, was already running late. 1942 was a year when the course of the Second World War shifted. Hitler’s troops were held up in the USSR, facing their first Russian winter, while the U.S. had swung into action in aid of the Allies. In fact just as Bose was setting off on his eastward journey, the Germans suffered their greatest defeat at Stalingrad. The Japanese Imperial Army after their amazing conquests at the beginning of their offensive had been badly beaten in naval engagements in the Coral Sea and at Midway. Had the long cherished attack on India happened in the first flush of Japanese victories, maybe then Bose would have emerged a winner. But history took other turns and the British intercepted the messages sent by Rashbehari Bose to him. In the meantime the British had formed the South East Asia Command (SEAC) and in October 1943 Churchill appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia. Major interventions were afoot to revive the greatly depleted and demoralized British Army. The momentum of the war was already moving against the Axis Powers. In the meantime most of the year 1942 was wasted while the Japanese first overcame their internal dilemma about importing Bose to Asia and replacing the leadership of Rashbehari Bose and then worked out his complicated transportation logistics with the Germans. In fact even before Bose and the INA started the military campaign, the shadow of failure loomed large.\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 9\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\n10\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nIt would not be correct to assume that Bose was unaware of these developments of the war. He had always maintained his own sources of military intelligence, which were independent of the Japanese war propaganda. In one of his early letters to a close friend, Dilip Kumar Roy, he had argued for the Bengal revolutionaries, citing an Irish parallel: “You might just as well say that the Sinn Fein movement is a failure also since it hasn’t delivered the goods yet … A revolutionary movement for national liberation is not like a chance detonation which makes the agelong prison-walls topple once and for all. It is a slow laborious work of building up brick by brick a citadel of strength without which you can’t possibly challenge the powers that be.”20 He had looked beyond the apparent failure of these movements and been aware of the symbolical value of waging war against British imperialism. In reconfirmation of the same rationale, Bose and the INA would meet with failure in the campaigns of 1945 and yet manage to leave a legacy for India and Southeast Asia. As the emerging Asian nations struggled to shed their colonial skins, from the INA’s defeat would emerge a myriad legacies of Bose, which would remain a part of collective popular memory for the years to come.\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose: Some Facets of His Philosophy and Belief By the time Subhas Chandra Bose arrived at Singapore on 2 July 1943 to spearhead the Indian freedom movement in Southeast Asia, he had already spent over two decades closely involved with the nationalist cause in India. His political career was marked by certain strong convictions: his belief in an armed struggle and military discipline as an alternate path for wresting freedom, his faith in an all-encompassing secularity and a firm belief that no\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 10\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n11\n\ncountry could be completely free when the women and minority groups were not involved as equal partisans of the struggle. These beliefs had evolved with the years and would characterize the INA movement in Southeast Asia.\n\nRepudiation of Passive Resistance The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in 1919 was a human tragedy of the dimension Indians had not witnessed in the recent past. It occurred on 13 April — a day that happened to be Baisakhi, one of the largest festivals of north India. Fifty soldiers of the British Indian Army, under the orders of Brigadier General Dyer, opened fire on an unarmed, motley gathering of men, women and children. The shooting continued till ammunition ran out and the number of fatalities rose steadily. The bloodshed of thousands of innocents had a symbolic value that history could not ignore. Anti-British sentiments in India surged to an all-time high and more importantly it catapulted to the forefront of the political arena three leaders who would shape the future of nationalist India — Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose.21 As noted historian, Gerard H. Corr mentions in The War of the Springing Tiger, for both Bose and Gandhi the road to destiny began in 1919, the year of Jallianwala Bagh. In Bose’s work The Indian Struggle, large parts of which were written during his first exile in Europe and the second part completed just before his departure to Southeast Asia, there is a comment on Gandhi amongst the other more polemical writings, which sums up his attitude towards the senior leader rather succinctly: “He [Gandhi] has failed because while he has understood the character of his own people — he has not understood the character of his opponents …”22 The comparatively innocuous sentence captures well the dichotomy of Bose’s opinion\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 11\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\n12\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nwhich did not alter much over the years: while he admired the senior leader for propelling the Congress from an elitist debating body to a national organization with mass appeal and his instant connect with the teeming millions of India, he did not subscribe to his philosophy of Civil Disobedience. Bose, fed on the activism of Sri Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda, embodied an alternate philosophy of leadership based on a commitment to an uncompromising armed resistance to the British. Freedom would not come with across-the-table negotiations with the British; it had to be wrested. In one of his early speeches delivered at Kuala Lumpur he declared: “From my experience, I am convinced that so long as the Indian people remain unarmed, so long as the British Government has a modern army under its control and so long as we do not take up arms for our struggle of freedom, we shall not be able to achieve independence for India. I do not know of one instance … where a nation has been able to achieve full independence without resorting to arms.”23 It was this philosophy and commitment to an armed resistance against the British opposition that he would be imparting to the multiethnic communities of Southeast Asia. It is true that the easy camaraderie and emotional bonding which Bose had shared with his political guru, Chittaranjan Das, on whose death he had grieved like at the death of a father and about whom he would openly admit: “As for myself I can say that I fought with him on innumerable questions. But I knew that however much I might fight, my devotion and loyalty would remain unshaken. And that I would never be deprived of his love” were never replicated in his relationship with Gandhi.24 Bose came away disillusioned from his first meeting with Gandhi at Bombay: “… there was a deplorable lack of clarity in the plan which the Mahatma had formulated … did not have a clear idea of the successive stages of the campaign which would bring India\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 12\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n13\n\nto her cherished goal of freedom.”25 And this feeling remained over the years: Gandhi would always be the Mahatma and never became the Bapu he was for Nehru. But his lack of faith in the passive resistance of Civil Disobedience did not stem from this emotional divide. As a ringside observer of the Civil Disobedience movement in his own country, Bose had watched it unfold and was not too happy with the outcome. Non-cooperation as a Civil Disobedience movement emerged under the stewardship of Gandhi as India’s defence mechanism to the Jallianwala Bagh bloodbath. It did not take the movement long to spread its wings as spinning the charkha [spinning wheel for making cotton yarn], wearing khadi [indigenously manufactured cotton fabric], enrolment in the volunteer corps, boycott of all things British, including government institutions and government functions became ubiquitous. As in the past the British reacted with hostility and by the end of 1921 most of the nationalist leaders, apart from Gandhi, were imprisoned and Congress volunteer organizations declared unlawful. But despite British reprisals, the popularity of the movement did not wane, with the average Indian assuming spontaneous leadership. In 1922 when non-cooperation was at its height, Gandhi decided to abruptly call it to a halt after the violent attack on a police outpost at Chauri Chaura. In a response that was ironical as it was expected, the British arrested Gandhi, jailed him for six years and effectively put an end to the first phase of Civil Disobedience. Political stalwarts like C. R. Das (Chittaranjan Das) and Motilal Nehru were taken by surprise and decided to branch off from Gandhi and form their own Swarajist Party in 1923. Bose, then a political initiate, would later observe in Indian Struggle: “No one could understand why the Mahatma should have used the isolated incident at Chauri Chaura for strangling the movement all over the country … situation in the country as a whole was\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 13\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\n14\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nexceedingly favourable for the success of the Civil Disobedience campaign.”26 He would also recall Das’ deep frustration: “The Mahatma opens a campaign in a brilliant fashion; he works it up with unerring skill; he moves from success to success till he reaches the zenith of his campaign — but after that he loses his nerve and begins to falter.”27 The same sense of futility and missed opportunity would assail Bose time and again as would the ineptitude of the strategy of passive resistance adopted by the Congress. In 1927 with the political support for the Conservatives in Britain being considerably grim and with the Labour Party already emerging as a credible alternative, the Simon Commission was sent to India to review constitutional reforms somewhat earlier than scheduled. The people of the subcontinent viewed the Commission right from its inception, comprising as it did of seven British MPs including Chairman Sir John Simon, with suspicion. The Commission was met by outraged crowds, with hartals [closure of shops etc. as protest] and black flag demonstrations wherever it travelled. Even as the country went up in flames, Congress decided to boycott the Commission and challenged Lord Birkenhead, the Secretary of State for India, to draft a constitution that was acceptable to the people. Bose would work throughout the summer of 1928 on the all-party “Nehru Report”, a memorandum on the new Dominion Constitution for India that eventually the British ignored and refused to implement. But the “Nehru Report” also created its own share of controversies within the Congress. At the Madras session of the Congress in December 1927, Nehru with the support of Bose and other young leaders passed a resolution to change the goal of Congress from dominion status for India to one of complete independence.28 But Gandhi, though not present at the Working Committee meetings, was of the opinion that the resolution had been passed a year too early and described it in Young India as\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 14\n\n2/13/12 9:13:26 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n15\n\n“Hastily conceived and thoughtlessly passed”.29 With the senior leader’s opposition, the resolution stood rejected. Subsequently in 1928, during the Calcutta Congress when Gandhi proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant dominion status to India within two years, it was the turn of the younger nationalists to oppose the move. By the time Congress’s call for Purna Swaraj [complete independence] finally came in 1930, the situation according to Bose, had deteriorated: “There is absolutely no doubt that if the Congress Working Committee had taken courage in both hands, they could have anticipated the movement of 1930 by two years and the appointment of the Simon Commission could have been made the starting point of such a movement.”30 As the Congress remained entangled in its own controversies and vacillated between resolutions, manifestos and counter-manifestos, for Bose this was again loss of precious time when the country was ready, but the leaders were found wanting and in this dilemma, the only party which gained any advance was the British.31 Gandhi’s Dandi March, the second of his pan-India movements, began in March 1930 immediately following the declaration of Purna Swaraj. This non-violent protest against the British salt laws proved to be a political masterstroke. It was beyond any socially divisive possibilities and provided a crucial link between Swaraj and rural grievances of India — sweeping up the country on a tidal wave of Civil Disobedience. On 2 March Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, offering to stop the march if his demands of reduction of land revenue, cutting down of military spending, waver of the salt tax were met. However, Irwin chose to ignore his letter and Gandhi remarked, “On bended knees I asked for bread and I have received stone instead.”32 Though the salt satyagraha [Gandhi’s policy of civil resistance] proved to be an unprecedented success in India and made non-violence the cynosure in the eyes of the world press, it failed to yield any major concessions from the British for dominion status and what was even more\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 15\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\n16\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\ndamaging, it failed to attract Muslim support — in fact many Muslims actively boycotted the satyagraha. Gandhi was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona. Civil Disobedience continued through the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and the subsequent Roundtable Conferences of 1930–32. Again, the Roundtable Conferences that were organized by the British as damage control after the debacle of the Simon Commission, did not yield anything concrete for Indians or the Indian Constitution. On the other hand they only succeeded in further accentuating the inter-communal divisions already prevalent in the country. The First Roundtable was held without any participation from the Congress, while in the Second, Gandhi was the sole official Congress representative and understandably it ended in failure. Bose, disturbed by this prospect would observe: “… leaders arrayed against him in a solid phalanx, he would be at a great disadvantage.”33 In 1939 Viceroy Linlithgow declared India’s participation in World War II without consulting the provincial government. As Bose went in and out of prisons and continued his bitter wrangling with the more conservative Gandhi conformists, he was slowly driven to the realization that a parting of ways with Gandhi and non-violence was necessary. Not only was the shared political space becoming too stifling for the coexistence of two viewpoints which were so radically opposed to each other, Purna Swaraj would not be achieved through Civil Disobedience. The endless cycle of resistance followed by ruthless reprisal would continue without any compromise forthcoming from the British. Another factor that convinced him was the war. As the war took shape and gradually enveloped all the continents, Bose realized that a nation that did not possess military strength could not hope to preserve its independence.\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 16\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n17\n\nOn 3 September 1939, Subhas Bose was addressing a Forward Bloc mass rally on the Marina Beach at Madras when he received the information that Britain had declared war on Germany and that the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting the Congress or any other representative body had announced India’s participation in the war.34 For Bose this was an opportune moment to strike against the British, weakened as they were at the prospect of war and their dependence on the British Indian Army, but the majority of the Congress leaders thought otherwise. According to Gandhi it was not the way of non-violence to “seek India’s independence out of British ruin”. The final parting of ways happened with Bose’s departure to Europe while under house arrest to seek collaboration with the Axis military alliance, leaving the country open to Gandhi’s third and most powerful national movement — Quit India and the consequent August Revolution. Both men with a burning sense of mission continued to forge their own paths of destiny: Gandhi even as he rode the crest of the popular Quit India movement was increasingly disheartened by the communal tensions under which India was disintegrating while Bose started on an unchartered journey which would end at the battlefields of Burma.\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose: The Evolving Soldier A variety of images do the rounds among the wide circle of Bose aficionados. Just as Bose himself at one point in his life had been in a quandary about whether he should join Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan or join the Ramakrishna Mission for humanitarian work or teach at the National College, the different images convey the evolution taking place within as life’s experiences taught him diverse lessons at different times. In some he wears an elegantly draped Kashmiri shawl\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 17\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\n18\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nwith the Bengali dhoti and kurta [Bengali attire], in some he is the pucca colonial in western attire while in others he wears the Congressman’s Gandhi cap. But the image which has retained its hold over popular imagination is where he is the soldier: in khaki tunic, forage cap and knee-high boots, preferably astride a stallion, looking on with an expression of unwavering self-belief. This is the image he consciously adopted once in Southeast Asia and today Netaji has become synonymous with his military greens. This is the image one is accustomed to seeing at busy crossroads of Bombay or Calcutta or in lovingly preserved portraits at Malaysia. This is the last picture that is available of him in the words of his sole companion, Colonel Habibur Rahman, on that final fateful flight to Tokyo, “So he stood with his clothes burning and himself making desperate efforts to unbuckle the belts of his bush coat … As I was fumbling with his belts I looked up and my heart nearly stopped when I saw his face, battered by iron and burnt by fire.”35 The symbols evocative of valour and a martial code of life that he had initiated with the Azad Hind Fauj, first in Europe and then in Asia, found their final fructification through being embodied by the man himself. Interest in the military and everything martial was one of the enduring passions of Bose’s life. This active bias towards the military was the source from which sprang his later-day faith in armed resistance as an alternate strategy against the British. The military interested him partly because he saw it as a way to gain physical strength and confidence; a disciplined solution for making Indians physically competitive with the British. The idol of his growing up years was Swami Vivekananda, who advocated salvation through sweating it out at a football field rather than a philosophical understanding of the Gita. It also came from his adolescent years in Bengal when the nationalist youth was under the influence of Sri Aurobindo and his radical, hard-line\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 18\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n19\n\nleadership. Physical fitness was considered a pertinent trait for being a nationalist and was actively promoted at community fairs such as the Hindu mela. Indigenous martial sports like lathi [a martial sport played with long wooden sticks] and wrestling were encouraged by revolutionary organizations like the Anushilan or Jugantar Samities.36 Perhaps all of this was a reaction to the Martial Race theory propagated by British army officials: an order of classification of the Indian ethnic groups into neat little racial boxes.37 Men like Lieutenant-General Sir George MacMunn saw Indians as the “great bearded Sikh with his uncut Nazarite hair” or the “square-shouldered Musalman” or the “squat, pug-faced little Mongolian Gurkha” for the ease of army recruitments.38 The theory postulated the genetic qualities that make a useful soldier which apart for a few exceptional cases, were considered to be lacking in most Indians. Bengalis unfortunately fell under the non-martial category and were considered physically weak, effeminate and not battle worthy. Bose, like other Bengalis of the time, rose to the challenge and in adapting a militant lifestyle, endeavoured to prove the British assumption wrong. Bose’s first brush with the military was soon after his arrival to Calcutta from Cuttack where he volunteered for service in the newly formed 49th Bengalees but failed the eye test and was refused admission. He was more successful in his second attempt. While he was studying at the Scottish Church College, the Government of India started a university unit of the Indian Defence Force. Bose was one of their zealous recruits and took a spontaneous liking to camp life. He felt the military training added to his “strength and self-confidence”. In the Indian Pilgrim he describes an incident when they entered Fort William which was normally out of bounds for Indians: “… we experienced a queer feeling of satisfaction, as if we were taking possession of something to which we had an inherent right.” At Cambridge too\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 19\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\n20\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nhe attempted to gain admission to the University Officers’ Training Corps but was not allowed to do so by the War Office. Later in his political life he tried to import some of this military discipline to the Congress. It was customary at Congress sessions to have the volunteers organized into something akin to army units or Volunteer Corps, who, though unarmed, would provide the guard of honour and maintain law and order. In 1928, the responsibility of managing the Volunteer Corps as a part of the Calcutta Congress fell to Bose. He took the project with seriousness and starting with a recruitment drive, going on to give the volunteers military training and uniforms. Once the Calcutta Congress was over, it was Bose’s plan that the skills and training of the volunteers should reach the villages of Bengal and beyond.39 Eventually, with the successful completion of the war of independence, the regiment could be absorbed into the national army of independent India. However, Gandhi as a “sincere pacifist” was not comfortable with this show of military muscle and later sardonically described it as the “Bertram Mills circus”. However, what is of import, the nucleus of the idea to form a battle-hardy Indian army had already taken hold and waited to find tangible form in the Azad Hind Fauj of Europe and then Asia.\n\nSecularity and Ethnic Unity Bose sought to create a spirit of justice, equality and discipline in the INA. These were the values from which emerged the INA watchword — Ittefaq, meaning unity which would be the cornerstone of its philosophy. Both in Europe and Asia, while working with the rich panoply of Indian castes, religions and races, his emphasis, right from the outset, was on secularism. At every step of the way he reinforced secular practices to forge a close bond within the multi-ethnic community of the INA\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 20\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n21\n\n— be it by introducing communal living, joint celebration of religious festivals, merit-based promotions or strict penalties for discriminatory behaviour. Yet, Bose’s understanding of secularity was a little different from that of Nehru. Unlike Nehruvian secularism that relegated religion to a completely private realm, away from the mainstream of a nation’s life, for Bose secularism meant a harmonious and informed coexistence. Unlike Nehru, his secularism did not exclude but included — he believed in integration based on a robust understanding and acceptance of differences. This philosophy of composite nationalism came naturally to Bose, part of a subliminal understanding of the world around him from his childhood days. In Cuttack he had grown up in a colony that was predominantly Muslim, where his Hindu father was a respected patriarch and it was customary for the family to participate in Muslim festivals: “In fact, I cannot remember ever to have looked upon Muslims as different from ourselves in any way, except that they go to pray in a mosque.”40 For him the Hindu-Muslim rift was an “artificial creation” by the British for their own advantage, a sort of Catholic-Protestant divide found in Ireland.41 In fact, Bose was sensitized to discrimination early in life. When at the age of seventeen he went on a precocious hunt for a guru, he had faced the caste divide of India: “At Buddha Gaya we had a similar experience … when we went for a bath we were told by some men there not to draw the water from the well because we were not Brahmans.”42 Apart from the sense of personal rejection, this must have been quite a blow for a young, vociferous reader of Hindu philosophy. During his growing up years in Calcutta there was a rising political consciousness among the Muslims of Bengal. The Bengal partition from 1905–12 had heightened this consciousness. The Muslim League had already been formed in 1906 in Dacca and\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 21\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\n22\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nvoiced the need to accept communal electorates. Bose started his political career under the tutelage of C. R. Das who recognized the need to involve all factions and minority groups of the Bengali society — Muslims, peasants, workers, the youth and women. At an early presidential address to the Bengal Provincial Congress, Das reached out to all religious communities: “We can frankly tell the Anglo-Indian community that there are no Extremists among us, no Moderates. The Hindus and Mahomedans of Bengal are all Nationalists … We want Home Rule, broad based on the will of the people of India.”43 Das was instrumental in forging the Bengal Pact in 1923 with the Muslim leaders of Bengal. The resulting Hindu-Muslim alliance lasted for the next couple of years and was one of the high watermarks in the relationship between the two communities. Just as Das had spoken as a Bengali populist reaching across class, ethnic and caste lines, so would Bose in his political career. As the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and in the spirit of the Bengal Pact, Bose was of the view that a percentage of new and replacement positions should be assigned to Muslims where qualified candidates from the community were available. He faced stiff opposition from a range of nationalist newspapers; though Gandhi wrote in his defence in Young India: “I note that the chief executive officer of the Calcutta Corporation has come in for a good deal of hostile criticism because of his having given 25 out of 33 appointments to Mussalmans … it is a creditable performance.”44 Later too, he would repeatedly earn the ire of the Hindu nationalist camp for his attempts at inter-communal rapprochement, but as he said himself, he could put his own popularity at stake rather than “forsake truth”.45 In Bengal, Bose endeavoured to bring together the Hindus and Muslims — two communities sharing the same history, speaking the same language, in most cases following the same customs;\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 22\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n23\n\nwith religion as the only, though seemingly insurmountable, dividing line. In Southeast Asia his canvas would be much wider — the INA would encompass Gujarati merchants, Tamil plantation labourers, Bengali clerks, Sikhs from the British Indian Army — men and women from all castes and all religious beliefs … yet his overarching strategy would remain the same: communal harmony at all cost. All his life, Bose himself would be a practising Hindu and yet religion would never be a part of his public persona, it would remain restricted to a corner of his room or a secluded monastery in Singapore.\n\nWomen as Equal Partisans in National Politics From the start of his political career in Bengal, Bose was careful in encouraging and aligning the nationalist struggle led by the women with the mainstream independence movement of the country. As early as in 1920 he had written from Cambridge to his dear friend Hemanta, conveying his enthusiasm for the women’s role in national politics: “Really, when will Indian women once again assume their role as educators of society? So long as India’s women will not wake up, India will never wake up. When I heard Mrs Sarojini Naidu speak here the other day, I could hardly contain the happiness that was surging within my breast.”46 Later, after beginning his active political career, while touring the districts of Bengal he was consistent in addressing the women of the towns. He would urge them to boycott foreign cloth, carry on propaganda among women and organize Mahila Samities [women’s societies] for concerted effort. As he kept reminding them, more than their responsibility to their homes, the women had an even “greater duty” to their country.47 He would create a separate cadre of women in the Bengal Volunteers at the time of the Calcutta Congress in 1928. The women formed a 300-strong\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 23\n\n2/13/12 9:13:27 AM\n\n24\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\ncontingent of volunteers, dressed in the national colours of green saris with red borders and paraded on the streets of Calcutta.48 Latika Ghosh, niece of Sri Aurobindo, was their commander and was referred to as “Colonel Latika”. Despite naysayers, the sight of these uniform-attired women parading on the streets of old-fashioned Calcutta created quite a stir. The newspapers of the time mention: “As the ladies clad in their spectacular saris marched past to the sound of the bugle and the beating of the drum, there could be traced not a touch of all the frailties that are so commonly attributed … with the womanhood of Bengal.”49 Besides, bringing women volunteers to the forefront in the political arena, the women’s wing of the Bengal Volunteers served another purpose: it formed the nucleus which tied the other groups of women revolutionaries at work in Bengal at that time, into a loose network. Thus while there was active interface with Lila Nag’s Deepali Sangha in Dacca, women for the Bengal Volunteers were recruited from Kalyani Das’s Chhattri Sangha in Calcutta. Educated in the foremost women’s academic institutions, Victoria and Bethune of Bengal, this was a new breed of young avant-garde women who led and volunteered for these groups. The organizations encouraged education, gave training in physical fitness and encouraged political awareness among women.50 Geraldine Forbes, who had interviewed many of these women, has written: “If there were a living figure who encouraged their activities, it was Subhas Chandra Bose, considered by many of the women revolutionaries Bengal’s champion of women’s rights.”51 The Bengal Volunteers and the ensuing women’s movement that evolved with the Bengal revolutionary groups acting as feeders to the movement was a crucial link to the Rani of Jhansi Regiment that was to take shape later. This experience of networking and recruiting women from various women’s groups and women’s\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 24\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n25\n\ncolleges and initiating them into self-defence training would prove to be of great value for Bose in Southeast Asia. Though Bose’s primary objective was nationalism, he worked with a much larger canvas while dealing with women, both in India and in Asia. The comprehensiveness of his vision can be gauged from a speech he delivered at Vienna in 1935. In it he delineated the work on women being done in India in three broadly outlined categories: a. Social and educational programmes which covered women’s education, vocational training, mother and child welfare programmes, health and sanitation. b. The organizations which focused on specific women’s movements for the furthering of their basic rights like equal voting rights or right to property. c. Those organizations such as the women’s wing of the Congress which formed the political voice of women.52 In the same spirit in 1938, Bose, along with Nehru, insisted that a separate Planning Commission for women should be formed. One of the most comprehensive reports prepared under the aegis of the National Planning Commission would be on women and their future role in independent India. The Women’s Commission, chaired by Rani Lakshmi Bai Rajawade, had a predominantly female membership and the report recognized economic inequality as one of the key reasons for the subordination of women. It also dealt with the absence of fundamental rights for property, lack of mobility and the existence of gender discrimination in professional fields. The report proceeded along the lines suggested by the Fundamental Rights Resolution adopted at the Karachi Congress in 1931 and advocated equal opportunities in education for both men and women. What was remarkable\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 25\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\n26\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\nabout the Women’s Commission was that it was controlled and driven by women themselves. In a perpetuation of the same vision, under the Provincial Government in Southeast Asia, Bose would appoint a separate planning commission for women for conducting research in areas on nation-building where women could particularly contribute.53\n\nSoutheast Asian Responses and Legacies Bose arrived at the island of Sabang near Sumatra on 6 May 1943 and on 16 August 1945 he left on his final journey to Bangkok and thereafter to Saigon. The period of his intense involvement in Southeast Asia was packed into a compressed time-frame lasting only a couple of years and yet elicited a powerful reaction from the resident Indian community. As INA propaganda took Bose on countless journeys crisscrossing Malaya, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia and French Indochina, the immigrant community of civilian Indians was swept up on a tidal wave of nationalist sentiments. Everywhere the reaction was noticeably uniform: he spoke in stirring Hindustani or English, rapidly translated into Tamil for the large Tamil-speaking diaspora and the audience responded with equal fervour, committing their services and material possessions to the Indian nationalist cause. He was the nationalist who had brought Indian political consciousness and freedom struggle to Southeast Asian soil and could with ease reach across barriers of caste, race, age or sex. It was a rare opportunity for the immigrant community to integrate with the sacrifice of past martyrs and prove themselves to be worthy sons and daughters of India. Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Bose’s military secretary, later to be tried for treason at the Red Fort, records the first reactions of the Southeast Asian Indians in that they: “… felt that almost a God had come there … here was the man\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 26\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n27\n\nwho had come in answer to their prayers … he would be able to lead them on the right path, the path to Indian independence.”54 This was one of the most common responses to Bose in Asia — one of blind, almost hypnotic adulation. He was nothing less than a messiah who had come to deliver salvation to the masses and his mass rallies were like a personal epiphany to some. It was a time when Indian households took pride in hoisting the tricoloured flag and in a fascinating story, the Syonan Sinbun on 29 October 1943 reports that some Indians looked upon Bose as the “Lord Krishna of the moment” who had appeared to scourge the evils of colonialism. This kind of reaction contributed to the making of the legend that is inextricably linked to the persona of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose of today. It deifies him as a heroic figure for whom no sacrifice is impossible. The legend is fed by rumours and actual incidents of his life. It remains palpable over the years as it draws from the well of frustrated reaction to postindependence reality. The legatees of the myth remove him from the ordinary, place him on a pedestal and take him to be an idol fit for worship, albeit from a distance. In a poem penned by James J. Puthucheary, a Malayan of Indian origin and a lieutenant from the Azad Guerrilla Regiment, who fought at the Burma front, there is yet another kind of response to the nationalist struggle and so in effect to Bose. In emotional content it is as powerful as the first but there is no psychological distancing from the idol. The poem titled, “Death Curse”, reads: Blood from my wounds drip Drop by drop Into an uncongealing pool Wounds do not pain There’s even a joy in them\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 27\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\n28\n\nA Gentleman’s Word … For my blood would have choked Your throat and sealed your lips And only then my blood congeal.55\n\nThe poem is remarkable because it is so close in expression and rhetoric to some of Bose’s own writings. The concept of selfless sacrifice, of the merging of pain and pleasure, the sense of urgent need for a kind of self-immolation for the cause — these are all recurring motifs in Bose’s writing. From the prison in Mandalay he had written: “I am not sure that there is no happiness in the pain you get by banging against the iron bars of this cage. The realisation that my love for my country — the love that has brought me here — is real comes through this pain. This is why, I think, even if the heart bleeds, one finds in this some happiness, peace and a sense of fulfilment.”56 What Puthucheary’s poem implies is a more evolved internalization of the ethos that Bose stood for than what is evident in the first response recorded by Sahgal. It is this kind of subliminal identification with the man that would lead to the more informed choices and a more definitive perpetuation of Bose’s legacy. Some of the Indians who had experienced his presence and leadership would lead lives of dedication like him — for a cause, men and women who would keep his memory alive with their action — be it in the field of nationalist struggle, women’s movements or in their attempt at improving the economic and political lot of their nations. Like the first, in this reaction too there is an element of seeking the unattainable, but it is the unattainable which makes the fight all the more dearer, more worthwhile. Rasammah Bhupalan was a girl of sixteen when she witnessed Netaji’s oration at a mass rally at the Ipoh Club Padang. She would soon join the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, much against the wishes of her family and move to the Singapore camp at Waterloo\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 28\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n29\n\nStreet and later travel to the Burma battle front. She writes in her autobiography: “For all the Indians in SEA, this was a great event … My sister … and I were deeply moved. We regarded our sacrifices to be far more important for India than our sheltered lives.” 57 This is yet another facet of the reaction that Bose elicited. Layered in its implication, it expresses the impulse of a young girl to go beyond the call of everyday life and identify herself with a cause that would eventually take her closer to self-discovery and fulfilment. This kind of response would create an enduring legacy of import among the women of Southeast Asia. Participation in the nationalist struggle invested the migrant Indians, living as a minority community across Southeast Asia, with a rare sense of dignity and pride. The INA was a conduit which helped them connect back to their roots and make a meaningful contribution to the freedom struggle of their country. The military training and the attendant handling of arms bestowed on them a new found self-confidence and honed their leadership skills. Simultaneously, exposure to Subhas Chandra Bose’s speeches and INA propaganda meant an immersion training in national and world history. At the INA camps the Indian society came together in a powerful alchemy of new ideas and political views as the partisans were exposed to not only nationalism but also to diverse radical schools of political thought. Many INA veterans recall being initiated to the writings of Bernard Shaw, Marx, Lenin, and the works published by the Fabian Society during their INA days and emerging at the end of the war with a more politicalized understanding of the world around them.58 As the war drew to a close and the INA was disbanded, the same sense of pride and political awareness in the Indian community would diversely express itself: in the Indian workers’ widespread and often militant labour movements, in drawing the Asian Indian women out of their more traditional roles and expectations and\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 29\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\n30\n\nA Gentleman’s Word\n\ninspiring some of them to take up mainstream roles for causes of equality and emancipation and in a more prominent participation by Indians in Southeast Asian politics. The INA experience left in its wake a large and maybe still not completely mapped terrain of legacy. The Indian community of Southeast Asia was the foremost to be impacted. But the seismic waves of socio-political change would spill over to the Asian nations as well. Anti-British exhortations by the INA and the subsequent Red Fort trials of November 1945, which triggered powerful public resentment in India, were instrumental in subverting Indian loyalty to the armed forces of the British Empire. This meant the British Indian Army, the supreme tool for perpetuating British hegemony in Asia, could not be used for suppressing local nationalist movements as effectively as it had been done before. Bose’s arrival in East Asia also heralded an era of better understanding between the Indian and some of the other indigenous communities. Bose was formally introduced to the Asian leaders of the time at the Greater East Asia Conference, held in Tokyo in November 1943. Right from the initial days Bose attempted to forge close diplomatic ties with them. This translated into better inter-communal relations during the war, particularly with Burma and the evolution of a more cohesive anti-colonial movement. Subhas Chandra Bose himself emerged as a role model in speech and military strategy towards whom some from the new generation of Asian leadership would gravitate. On 5 July 1943 he made one of his first public appearances at the Singapore Padang, opposite the Municipal Building (now City Hall) to address the INA. The 5 July speech set an important precedent and the subsequent larger-than-life INA rallies left a trail of memories in the oral history recordings of the time.59 S. R. Nathan, former President, Singapore, writes: “In retrospect, Bose’s great Padang speech marked the dawn of\n\n01 GentlemanWord.indd 30\n\n2/13/12 9:13:28 AM\n\nA Journey: A Dream\n\n31\n\nmass politics in Malaya among Indians … Malays and Chinese were not parties to the Indian struggle but, nevertheless, Bose’s presence created a certain atmosphere which led many to take an active part …”60 Indeed the period immediately following the war saw Southeast Asia awakening in a connected crescent of protest: the anti-colonial voice was determined to be heard and a new generation of leadership emerged which was aggressive, more militaristic and less inclined to procrastinate over acrossthe-table negotiations. In his last note addressed to the Indians of East Asia, Bose held out a promise: “The roads to Delhi are many and Delhi still remains our goal … India shall be free and before long.”61 The words have come to personify an indomitable human spirit in the face of impossible odds. And in the ultimate analysis, it is this spirit of human courage and determined action that is perhaps his greatest legacy. Whether in his alliance with the Japanese or in his dealings with the British, Bose refused to acknowledge a subordinate position for himself or his countrymen. In the subsequent years his anti-British resistance might have lost its relevance but Bose, as an embodiment of sheer human will, can never cease to impress and inspire.\n\nNotes 1.

Even as war broke out in Europe, the thought of an alliance with the Axis Powers to free India gripped his mind. In December 1940 he was moved to his home for medical reasons following a hunger strike while under detention. It was during this phase of house arrest at his father’s residence at Elgin Road, Calcutta that he managed to escape under cover to Europe with the help of a few family members. He reached Berlin in April 1941 via Kabul and Moscow, two-and-ahalf months after leaving Calcutta. 8. The double column headline in Hindustan Standard mentioned in S. N.

Bose could not make much progress in Germany and the time he spent in Europe eventually turned out to be largely an unnecessary detour primarily because of Hitler’s ambivalent stance towards India and the British. While for him Indians were way down the racial ladder, the British were the only other Anglo-Saxon race at par with the Germans. Despite the Germans waging war against the British, Hitler still harboured dreams of a future alliance with them: “England was still Hitler’s love.
