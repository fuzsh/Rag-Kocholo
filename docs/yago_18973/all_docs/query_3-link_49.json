Vijay is also called Thalapathy Vijay.\n\nEarly Life\n\nVijay, a well-known actor in Tamil cinema, is the son of a famous Tamil film director, producer, and writer S. A. Chandrasekar. Vijay was born in Tamil Nadu, Madras (now Madras known as Chennai) in 1974 on 22 June, and in June 2022, he will be 48 years old. Vijay's father has directed more than 70 films. Vijay's mother belongs to a Hindu family, and his father belongs to a Tamil Christian family. Vijay's mother's name is Shoba Chandrasekhar, and she is a Carnatic vocalist, producer, director, and playback singer.\n\nVijay also had a younger sister named Vidhya, but she died when she was 2 years old. His younger sister's death was traumatic for him, and Vijay was broken from the inside. Vijay's mother says that Vijay was very naughty and talkative in his childhood but became very serious and silent after his sister's death.\n\nEducation\n\nVijay was fond of becoming an actor since childhood. Understanding the importance of education, Vijay did his early studies at Fatima Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Kodambakkam. After studying till 10th in this school, Vijay took admission to Matriculation Higher Secondary School for his further studies, and this school is in Virugambakkam. Moreover, after completing his 12th grade, Vijay took admission to Loyola College, Chennai, to complete his graduation. Vijay pursued the course of Visual Communications at this college, but he left his graduation in the middle to begin his career in acting.\n\nFilmy Career\n\nVijay's father is one of the most famous Tamil and South film industry directors, and because of this, Vijay has been very interested in films. Since childhood, he liked acting more than studying, and due to this, when he was only 10 years old, he did a small role in the film Vetri as a child actor; this movie was released in 1984, and it was Vijay's first film, and only at the age of 10 Vijay began working in films.
