        "text": "When I saw Dev Patel in his film debut, the surprise hitÂ Â Slumdog Millionaire âwhich pre-release rated so low it was supposed to go straight toÂ DVDâIÂ didnâtÂ think much of him at all. Freida Pinto, whom Dev dated after Slumdog Millionaire,Â stole every moment of Devâs playing time.\n\nDev was gauche and unimpressive in Danny Boyleâs overrated Chawl drama. And then on top of the unimpressive screen presence, Dev went on to do all the wrong films including the disastrous M Night Shyamalanâs 3D Â Air Bender,Â followed byÂ About CherryÂ andÂ The Road Within, one worse than the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI thought that was the end ofÂ Patelâs cinematic journey. I was wrong. Soon after these disasters, Dev (named lovingly by his Mom after her favourite actor) was seen as the mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan inÂ The Man Who Knew Infinity.Â I thought Patel, aÂ Gujarati by birth, got the Tamil accent right. He also wore the dhoti better thanÂ Shah Rukh Khan inÂ DevdasÂ and Aamir Khan inÂ Lagaan.\n\nPatel owned the character with the same prideful yet humble authority as Ben KingsleyÂ exercisedÂ on Gandhi. Patelâs Tamilian accent was neither exaggerated nor exhibited. The natural tone does slip off once in a while. But the stumbling stance adds to the humaneness of the character. Garth DavisâÂ LionÂ was the next giant step ahead for Dev. Although child actor Sunny Pawar who played the younger version of Patelâs character stole the show, Dev was impressive enough as an adopted child in Australia who returns to India looking for his roots.Â This was a Manmohan Desai plot masqueradingâvery effectively, I might addâas a Bruce Beresford drama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDev was nominated for the Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor(I am still to figure out how Dev was a supporting actor inÂ Lion). But he lost to an extremely worthy contenderÂ Aaron Taylor-Johnson inÂ Nocturnal Animals. The lionÂ was characterized by the same problem that Dev Patel faced in his debut film: the child actor Sunny Pawar who plays Saroo Brierley as a child is far more spontaneous unrehearsed and impactful than Dev Patel who takes over the role-baton mid-way through the film. By then, little Pawar has already lodged himself in the audienceâs subconscious as the soul of Saroo. We are looking for little Pawarâs parents in the slums. Dev Patel becomes just the carrier, a gloriously engaging carrier no doubt, of hope. His timing was wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately for Dev, everything is going just right now. His performance in the title role ofÂ Â The Personal History Of David CopperfieldÂ and as King Arthurâs nephew inÂ Green KnightÂ has come in for a hefty encomium, although I must confess a brown David Copperfield was hard for me to swallow. There is no doubt that Dev is marching ahead and is today the most coveted actor of Indian origin inÂ America, leaving hisÂ Slumdog MillionaireÂ co-star FreidaÂ Pinto far behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, Dev turns director withÂ Monkey Man,Â a Netflix production in which Dev plays the lead and also co-produces. The film was completed aÂ year ago. There is no information on its release. Letâs hope Dev gets to see his dream of turning director soon on screen. The slumboy is no more slumming on big screens.\n\nAdvertisement"
