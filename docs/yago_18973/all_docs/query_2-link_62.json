Her first role as an actress was in the Telugu film Coolie No. 1. In December 1987, Boney Kapoor launch two Big Films, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja and Prem. In Prem, Tabu was signed opposite Sanjay Kapoor. The film took eight years in making. Tabu once jokingly said “I should get a the most waiting newcomer of decade”. Her first release in Hindi as a leading lady was Pehla Pehla Pyar which went un-noticed. She came into prominence with her role in Vijaypath (1994) opposite Ajay Devgan for which she received the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award. This was followed by many films that did not do well at the box office.\n\nSuccess (1996–present)\n\nIn 1996, Tabu had eight releases. Two films Saajan Chale Sasural and Jeet went on to be hits; both were within the top five films of that year. Her other significant film, Maachis, was critically acclaimed.

Her portrayal of a bar dancer met with unanimous praise, and she won her second National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance. Critic, Taran Adarsh said, “Chandni Bar is Tabu’s film all the way and there are no two opinions on that. Her performance deserves the highest marks and of course, all the awards. Her work is flawless and the impact her character makes on the minds of the viewer is also due to a tailor-made role”. Another critic mentioned, “if there is one actress who can carry a film on her shoulders, it is Tabu. As usual, she sparkles”.\n\nShe has acted in a number of Telugu movies, many of them very successful, such as Coolie No. 1 and Ninne Pelladutha, the latter being one of her most famous and popular movies. In 2003, Tabu starred in an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth. The actress played Nimmi based on the character Lady Macbeth. The film titled Maqbool was directed byVishal Bharadwaj and premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Maqbool was a box office failure but was met with huge acclaim. Tabu’s performance opened to much appreciation; critic Ron Ahluwalia said, “Tabu shines in a dark role. The most versatile actress in Bollywood takes to villainy like a second nature. She is menacing and seductive, but keeps an innocent look on her face, making her even viler. The way Tabu delivers her taunts simply perfect. Her gradual insanity is heart-wrenching and her final outburst is easily the highlight of the film.” Another critic said, “Tabu is fantastic in a complex role. Her performance in the film is worthy of awards. After Chandni Bar, this is another role that will be remembered for a long, long time.”\n\nShe had a supporting role in Fanaa (2006), with Aamir Khan and Kajol. The film went on to become the fourth biggest hit of that year.\n\nIn 2007, Tabu starred in her first Hollywood film, The Namesake, directed by Mira Nair. The film was a big hit overseas. She also starred in Cheeni Kum in which she played a 34 year-old woman who falls in love with a 64 year-old played by Amitabh Bachchan. Critics were generally positive towards the film; Taran Adarsh said, “Tabu stands on her feet despite a formidable co-star’s domineering presence. She’s excellent.” Though the film did not do as well domestically, it performed well overseas, especially in UK and USA.\n\nShe started off 2009 by being featured on the cover of Vogue India’s January 2009 issue.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nShe is the life member of International Club of Asian Academy Of Film and Television, Noida.\n\nIn 1998, Tabu was charged with poaching two blackbucks in Kankani during the filming of Hum Saath Saath Hain along with co-stars Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre andNeelam.
