        "text": "Just lull\n\nGot famous much recently as a lockdown favorite, this film ended up being just another uninteresting survival story. Last week when I watched ‘Helen’ I wasn’t mighty impressed with it but ‘Trapped’ made me like the former more at least because of the entertainment. ‘Helen’ had a great outside premise and had the luxury of going to it every now and then when it felt monotonous. Also, Anna Ben was terrific in her role whom no one can hate. But here it was more depressing because it’s all about one man stuck in flat for, we don’t know how many days, without any luxury of going out in between the cuts.\n\n‘Helen’ feels like a thriller but ‘Trapped’ is more claustrophobic and gets to us. We feel, why couldn’t he have escaped in spite of knowing that he wouldn’t. The director, Vikramaditya Motwane, succeeds in that way we feel trapped but we give up before Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao) does because its exhaustive. There were no interesting scenes to back up every now and then. Watching all the survival films off late, it makes me think how wonderful Robert Zemeckis made ‘Cast Away’ and how good was Tom Hanks in it. Even though it was one of the very first movies I watched, the way it held my attention was tremendous.\n\nRajkummar Rao plays the typical naïve ‘Kai Po Che’ guy yet again and Geetanjali Thapa was tremendous as Noorie. Heroines are great assets in Rajkummar Rao films. Especially the strong female leads with a definitive opinion. It’s so lovely to watch. Be in Amrita Puri in ‘Kai Po Che’ or Geetanjali Thapa here. In fact, the role reversal in Queen too was awesome. His role was the reason why we liked Kangana more in the film. It would go down as one of his underrated movies. In fact, such kind of charm even works when he messes up the steps in dance. For example, “pallo latke” in ‘Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana’ which appears so cute. Not all men have this charm to mess up.\n\nSo, after initial few minutes, it’s all him. I didn’t like the close up shot of the lock when it got closed, wish there had been something more interesting than that to show that he was locked up. I loved the rat scene where he doesn’t fetch water. That’s something which would have irritated many people who don’t have that kind of fear. In fact, the angst when he tries to shoo it off after killing pigeon was honest. The second time he kills pigeon and walks off bare chest should have been a much heroic scene than that. It was a wasted opportunity. Look how effortlessly Vikram comes out with a syringe in ‘Kadaram Kondan’ in a similar scene.\n\nThankfully the film ends on right note which gave me a feel of how it does once I come back after vacation where I expect people to ask me where I had been all the while, see the office environment different, food court with same menu etc. It’s the same feeling which Shaurya has when he comes back to normal world. It’s all the same out there and her girlfriend had moved on (rightly so). So much so that even the guy next to him in the table doesn’t say a ‘hi’. How nostalgic.\n\nThe watchman (R. N. Shukla) was another interesting character where he doesn’t mind who goes in or comes out. Has an old transistor to accompany him all the while. Especially, the look he gives Shaurya when he comes out was amazing.\n\nAll of Them Husbands\n\n‘Rosemary’s Baby’ suits the National Film Registry’s definition of “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” films to the tee. It’s impossible to believe that the film is 50+ years old. With other favorite horror films of mine like ‘The Shining’ or ‘Exorcist’ at least the year is evident, even though the film is still awesome. But with ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ we don’t feel the age at all. It’s like the taste of old wine with new wine even though if it’s not new.\n\nThe best feature of a horror film would be to not make it look like a horror film. Not waiting for something to jump into screen from nowhere. Not having that eerie haunting music or a crescendo which is about to hit anytime. And more importantly not masking all these behind a layer of human emotions. Even though ‘The Shining’ and ‘Exorcist’ does some of it, it does those things in a style of its own. But with ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ there is nothing of that sort. Not even a single jump scare. The only scene where something close to it happens is when Rosemary (Mia Farrow) calls Dr. Hill (Charles Grodin) from phone booth and a figure appears behind her. But that too is not a shocker but a carefully infused scene.\n\nThe film starts with Rosemary and Guy Wodehouse (John Cassavetes) checking out an apartment to rent. May be that could be the only eerie sequence of the whole movie. That follows a death, post which they get introduced to the neighbors Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) who are weirdos in their own way. Minnie especially. But how brilliant was Ruth Gordon in playing such a role.\n\nOne aspect of the film which impressed me a lot is the characterization of Rosemary. Rightly called ‘Rosemary’s baby’, the film revolves around her. And towards the later part the way she tries to protect her child by handling the situation was amazing. She’s not too sentimental to break down and unlike typical horror film heroines she doesn’t sweat it out, gets scared and finally goes for the kill. But carefully analyses what happens and acts accordingly. That was beautiful to watch, a self-sufficient independent woman who is capable of handling her own.\n\nInitially when Rosemary and Guy make out, there comes a dream typical to that of many horror films. Sex is kind of an integral component of horror films but luckily, here its just the one act. But an act made well. It in fact sets the whole tone of the movie for being a psychological horror than being a mere plain horror. I thought because the title had ‘baby’ in it, the whole film would revolve around making babies and go into ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ mode but thankfully it didn’t.\n\nThe climax is a curious one and also a depressing one. The child in the end becomes ‘McGuffin’ which in a way irritates but it irritates right. That’s the emotion the director expected from the audience I believe. I’d have hated it if whatever Rosemary were imagining were all lies so at least in that aspect I was saved but seeing her become one among them was depressing.\n\nAn impressive story line but not so impressive screenplay defies ‘Maachis’ from being a great film\n\nThis Gulzar film was in my list for a really long time, thanks to the song “Chappa Chappa” which used to be a constant in good old ‘Rangoli’ days. But never knew it’s this serious a movie, all the while. Every time you watch a film on once burning issue and read about it, its irritating to the core. That’s why the war movies of the west work. World War and Vietnam war movies could be watched upon for the glamour and choreography without any guilt. But when it comes to our movies, we can’t help but have to ride with guilt.\n\n‘Sikh insurgency’ is one such concept where its shameful to even admit whatever happened against them. In fact, being in lockdown and thinking of various hiking places around India and seeing the practical threats it looms about, is highly disheartening. If climatic change is a threat which would spoil few treks there are border issues spoiling others. And who ends up being the loser, we the people, who can’t enjoy the place. At least climatic changes are brought back to normal, thanks to Corona. But I don’t know when world leaders are really going to talk proper politics instead of doing politics against each other. Like Kamal told in ‘Vishwaroopam 2’\n\nLeaving off the personal lamentations and talking about the movie, two of the most famous songs “Chhod Aaye Hum” and “Chappa Chappa” came out of nowhere. It’s needless to have employed flashback technique for a film like this. It doesn’t achieve anything by not being in chronological order. The only reason I could think of the director not making it in chronological order was to place the songs with equal gap. What a waste…\n\nOtherwise the film keeps happening in the same tempo, slightly on the slower side. The film gets into the issue right away when Jaswant Singh Randhawa (Raj Zutshi) gets taken away by the police and returns home with serious injuries. That makes Kripal Singh (Chandrachur Singh) agitated and by chance he joins Sanathan’s (Om Puri) gang. All happens by chance and that was the most problematic thing about the film. We don’t get to really see what Kripal is thinking and why he’s wooed to become terrorist. Even the bomb scene by Sanathan doesn’t make any impact. It’s confusing to know what Kripal is thinking all the while.\n\nBut Tabu with so less screen space has such clarity of thoughts that whenever she makes appearance during the last part of the film, her appearance is felt. I guess that’s what made her the muse of most of the parallel Hindi cinema directors like Vishal Bharadwaj, Nandita Das etc. If not for the needless songs appearing all of a sudden, her impact would have been even more terrific.\n\nThe most interesting character out of the lot would definitely be Sanathan because we know that he’s doing something for a cause but it can’t be straightaway defined whether its right or wrong, we get hint that he killed Kuldip (Ravi Gossain) on his way back to home. What’s interesting is its not explained to the rest, anywhere in the movie. Plus, we don’t know whether he regrets that at least. This event could be taken as something done by a tough task master or by a mercilessly terrorist warlord. We get a glimpse of both through his character and as usual he’s prolific in his acting as well. His part was the masterclass in the whole film.\n\nAnother good thing about the film is that it seemed to have been made on location and in harsh conditions. Even though there were so many films made in cold place we tend to forget one common dialogue which many utter there. Saying that it’s cold out there. People who have travelled those places would know about it. So, it felt good to see such a scene there.\n\nBut on a whole the film wasn’t really gripping, that too after ‘Maqbool’ just last week, it was not very defiant. Wish the story line had more conflicts than being uni dimensional so that it could have been better.\n\nA less warranted repeat\n\n‘Sin city 2’ looks just like an extension of part 1. Technically the film is smoother than the first one but doesn’t quite create the impact the first one did. In spite of being just around ninety minutes, the film felt longer than its time. May be personally I didn’t find it interesting because it didn’t have much to do with Nancy’s (Jessica Alba) character and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) appears as only a ghost, so that was a bummer. “That Yellow Bastard” being my favorite part of the first movie, didn’t have much loose ends to be filled in second movie.\n\nIn fact, the whole problem of the movie was, trying to tie the loose ends and give a proper conclusion. It’s not a movie to be made that way. But when the film started and Marv (Mickey Rourke) appeared, it got me excited. Without my knowledge I seem to have become a fan of the film. I was looking forward to what’s going to happen next. The only question being, what new can be done in second film, everything seemed to have already been done in first film.\n\nThis movie had a stellar cast, much more than first movie. Except for one disappointment in the form of Clive Owen not being there to repeat the Dwight character, the others were really good. But the problem is the whole movie focuses on Dwight’s (Josh Brolin) story. With little amount of time and more action, Dwight’s story didn’t really appeal me in first movie so needless to say, it was another bummer.\n\nMy eyes lit up as soon as I saw Eva Green’s name in the list and the character she played suited her to tee. Ava Lord (Eva Green) is a lady or goddess who manipulates everyone and gets things done. Who better than Eva Green to play such a role and in addition to it, there is a lot of nudity too. Without saying, Eva Green and nudity go hand in hand, I’ve never seen someone do nude scenes more confidently than her. May be Margot Robbie in ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ but other than that I couldn’t think of anyone who owns their body as much as Eva Green does.\n\nIt also stars another favorite actor of mine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I was wondering how he’d fit in such a movie but he did his job really well. That’s the mark of his sincerity. And only that. He puts so much hard work and tries to fit in whatever he does. I couldn’t really understand Johnny’s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) story, on what it was trying to say, he shows a lot of promise, only to be mercilessly killed by the Roark (Powers Boothe). It was sadistically funny though. I’d have enjoyed it more if I had been a fan of Powers Boothe rather then being a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nThe film began with a lot of promise and I loved it till the point where Marv kills some people who call him by his coat name, that was a nice nostalgia. The Ava Lord part was nice thanks to Eva Green and the skin show, otherwise it’s another plain storyline. The old city and climax weren’t really interesting. Jessica Alba couldn’t really fit in as part of Sin City, she was better as a hot looking Nancy. Merv tries to light up those scenes by cute romance but that’s that, it doesn’t work apart from that sequence.\n\nDown the memory lane\n\nThis movie which I watched some fifteen years back in a newly bought computer, with my movie count hardly in two digits, was one movie which I remembered for so long. It’s something which truly affected me back then. Made me understood that films don’t have boundaries. It can be any thing and could be made in any way. What was more interesting was that I was amazed that I was able to understand and like such a movie. It was a surreal feeling, like knowing the rhythm pattern of a song just by hearing. This and ‘Watchmen’ would always be my two go to superhero movies which I watched without any movie knowledge and still liked it without knowing why.\n\nThe only thing I remember about the movie apart from the making is the Jessica Alba Kiss. Wonder why the kiss in ‘The Notebook’ is always hailed. This should have been ‘The Kiss’, by the way its been haunting me for a decade. I guess for people of my generation, Jessica Alba would have been ‘The woman’, the first name that a newbie Hollywood movie watcher would notice. Apart from it, it had an amazing Bruce Willis too which made the Yellow Bastard epic.\n\nWonder why Robert Rodriguez is not as much celebrated as his dear friend Quentin Tarantino, for he too makes really quirky movies. Even in the dual features, Tarantino gets more mention than Rodriguez. He might not need fanboys like Tarantino’s but at least he could do with more general fans because he is one of the master satire directors. I guess he went overboard in few of the films and people didn’t understand the ingenuity of his making style. That’s why he couldn’t get that much of fame. But personally, his movies have always been a treat to watch.\n\n‘Sin City’ might take a few minutes to settle, because we don’t know what we’re up to. But once we know, it’s amazing to watch. Giving a mighty tribute to pulp fictions, this film is much better than ‘Pulp Fiction’ in giving a proper tribute because even the way it was shot was how we see in the comics. One needn’t really be a fan of comic books to understand the ingenuity of the film because the film feels like a comic pulp fiction. It’s something which was thought, could never be achieved in live action. But using an animation template and making it a live action template itself is a great achievement.\n\nOut of the four stories, “The Yellow Bastard” worked the best for me because it was the first which came up and had terrific actors, great villain and a superb storyline. The climax was a bit of let off, considering the genre but the film being an unemotional one, that kind of worked too because we don’t feel like pondering over it for a long.\n\n“The Customer Is Always Right” was one of the shorts which was purely for style and was made strictly for the same reason. The way it gets our attention instantly is something commendable.\n\n“The Hard Goodbye” is the one which makes the most out of the film. A complete superhero film without a known superhero. In fact, he isn’t even a superhero who has great values. It’s personal revenge but the way he’s projected is like a superhero movie. The escape sequences and the car shooting by the twin sister were superb scenes. The action sequence where Marv (Mickey Rourke) handcuffs Kevin (Elijah Wood) is one of my favorite action scenes ever, for the idea. Speed vs raw power. Bane vs Batman’s first fight in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ came close but the ‘Sin City’ one remains my all-time favorite action idea.\n\n“The Big Fat Kill” didn’t really work for me with respect to the film but I could get the idea of how the director wanted a big fat ending to the film through this. In fact, only in the extended version does it come at last, so it makes more sense. If it had come in the middle it would have only needless spoilt the flow. This part looked least stylized out of the lot and if not for Clive Owen’s charm I don’t think, this part would have even had half its charm.\n\nA charmingly disguised commercial thriller\n\nThe first thing that you associate with Nani is charm. That has been both a boon as well as bane for him. Thankfully I watched his ‘Jersey’ where I could seem him stripped off charm and still exhibit so much exuberance through acting. So ‘Naan Ee’ was the only film where I saw him in his usual charming self. That’s why there is always an interest in watching his films. ‘Gang Leader’ through thrives much on that factor and exudes charm.\n\nIf Nani is a kind of interesting character, Vikram Kumar too is. The director who started with a promising 13 B (which I didn’t like as much as others) and churned away hits like ‘Manam’, ‘24’ and such, is a director who makes films look classy but, in the end, is still a masala director. But Masala done in a way that it’s enjoyable and not overpowering. Gang Leader too falls in the category. And when the you have a star like Nani, he keeps you afloat with his charm and when compared to other films of Vikram Kumar, this looked more stable. It’s nevertheless a make-believe film but at least its something which respects emotion more than the glamour.\n\nJust like a number of movies in the recent past, this starts with a heist scene too where a dog and few people get killed. The heist is quick and nobody cares about the bank or the money it lost. We care about the people. A letter arrives to few women mentioning about a gift they’d be getting. They all arrive to see the one who posted it, Saraswathi (Lakshmi), who tells them about her plan to kill the one person who killed the remaining in the heist. The sentiment doesn’t really work but the director makes us buy it. They scout for a person to do his job and that’s Pencil Parthasarathy (Nani). He agrees to it as he can finally get to write an original novel.\n\nIf you had hated the film by now for shallow storyline, you’re never going to like it further, but if you’re a masala fan like me, the rest would be enjoyable as well. The way they trace to villain and try to get hold of him were all very bleak. There could be million ways he could have escaped. Let me not get into the detailing part of it, I was not even interested about it at first place. But the characters and the chemistry between the family were really good. By having a girlfriend, daughter, sister, mother and grandmother. The director ticks all the boxes and they too perform effortlessly. Even the gay manager of the bank, Santoor Senakkayala (Vennela Kishore) does a decent job. In fact, I’ve become a fan of him off late. His comic sense is really good. In spite of not having much romantic scenes, the chemistry between Parthasarathy and Priya (Priyanka Arul Mohan) was really good and she looked lovely too. With few laugh out loud moments and a couple of sentiment scenes. Lakshmi and Saranya Ponvannan provide a good back up to the film so that we don’t lose interest.\n\nIn a film where the entire first half goes by in searching the villain, the main criteria it should have satisfied would be, it ought to have a powerful villain. But here Dev (Kartikeya Gummakonda) is a loser, who doesn’t have any card up his sleeves and provides no fight for Nani’s gang. There were a couple of interesting scenes in the second half like Saraswathi’s back story and Nani’s. I loved the motive of revenge for Saraswathi. That’s the only thing I could genuinely appreciate for writing and that’s the only take away for me from the film. Rest all were made up craft. The point when she says that whether they’d have all ganged up if she had been seeking revenge for an eighty-year-old was bang on face. It’s a question of priority. Like, ‘Saving Private Ryan’, where we can keep on debating whether it was right or wrong. That was a lovely one.\n\nDuring the climax the only thought that came to our mind was how it’d be a perfect remake material in Tamil with Sivakarthikeyan in the lead because he could do everything which Nani had done in the movie. A top hero like Vijay or Ajith definitely wouldn’t fit the bill because it’s not as heroic as expected but for someone like SK it’d fit the bill perfectly where he’d get his due of comedy, little bit of sentiment and a story with twists. That one action fight in the end would satisfy his fans too. All said and done, I wonder whether I’d have watched it by putting so much effort, if the movie had been originally made in Tamil with SK in the lead 😛\n\nA sweet little thriller\n\nWonder how and why, this film isn’t not much talked about. In spite of not being a horror fan, this film scared the shit out of me as well as made me watch it in awe due to its ingenuine writing and brilliant acting. It was much better than the movies which even not core horror fans would like, yet had the thrill which typical horror fan would like to indulge.\n\nIn fact, what started as a film for indulgence became an inspiration altogether thanks to the eclectic filmmaking. Without reason, the title grabs the attention and keeps you hooked. Even before the end of the title I was feeling how wonderful it would have been if I had watched it in theatre. It’s not only because it’d have been more thrilling and scarier if I had watched in theatre but its like a mark of respect that it was not a film with just cheap thrills and jump scare. In fact, I’m not really against jump scare but I don’t like it when the film tries to be pretentious and masks itself being an intelligent movie without using jump scares. Jump scares work when you come to watch a horror movie as if taking a ride in amusement park so the expectations had to be set right and see what could be done in certain formula.\n\nAfter the titles the opening sequences are truly horrific and gory but it’s a dream, obviously, but a well made one that. Followed by it was one of the best preludes before it becomes a horror movie. Be it the characters, their profession, family etc. That ten to fifteen-minute bit can be separately watched as a feel-good short film because its so ingenuine and feels really as the ‘feel good’ tag.\n\nBecause of the poster we get to know that the sweet little thing from the orphanage is the one who’s going to bring in chaos. That couldn’t help us but stop and admire her beauty. Even though she’s a little one, its not that the cuteness which attracts first but the sheer beauty like how the princess possess (someone like Madhubala). So, when she’s called a little princess by Sister Abigail (C. C. H. Pounder) we can’t help but agree. A pure Russian beauty as per the film bio, no matter where she was originally from.\n\nEsther (Isabelle Fuhrman) enters the house of Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) and immediately bonds with Max (Aryana Engineer) but Danny (Jimmy Bennett) detests Esther. So, in all the formula gets clear and the initial few days in the house is a breeze. Things start going awry when she seems Kate and John ‘fuck’ and doesn’t give a fuck about it. Sex scenes are integral part of horror movies but it was better than a random ghost seeing you make out. In fact, it was nice to know that Esther wasn’t a ghost at first place, a reason why I didn’t watch the movie all this time.\n\nThings start getting escalated with other activities where she slowly plots to finish off people whom she doesn’t like. Instead of seeing her as a kid who needs help, we get to know that she had come from mental asylum and that makes an interesting choice. The way she manipulates was brilliant, it was ‘Gone Girl’ level crazy but done by a pretty little thing, so that’s an icing on the cake. On the other hand, the way her history was not revealed right away was really well written, it wasn’t like they intentionally tried to split it up to keep the thrill. The events which happens in the middle so that Kate doesn’t get the complete information was superbly made.\n\nIt wasn’t an all sweet climax as well. It explodes superbly and ends with a little bit of disarray where loses happen but not entirely gory and depressing so that it becomes all plasticky. News is that there is going to be a prequel to it titled, Esther. Generally, its not a good idea to fiddle with horror film but knowing the twist of the film, it could be a great material because there is lot of scope to make a prequel with such kind of story.\n\nSafe Bet\n\nThinking of taking a break from Malayalam movies for family viewing, I thought I’d check for some feel-good movies in Telugu. Out of my Prime list, this seemed to be the safest bet of all. Luckily for me it ended up the same way. ‘Chitralahari’ is not a kind of movie, you dig in and watch as a non-Telugu viewer but watch it as a normal audience of that language who’re not stressing out to watch the gems of cinema of that particular region. Now that I’m in a free head space and there is no compulsion to get indulged in world cinema, this was a correct watch.\n\nI couldn’t stop thanking enough for the lockdown even though I was feeling pathetic the Sunday after watching the movie for wasting two hours in the morning without writing reviews. And also, this movie spoilt my routine of not watching back to back movies of same language. In spite of that, the ‘safe bet’ tag was firmly stuck to the movie so that I couldn’t hate it. In fact, it is one of the movies which the directors would love to making for upcoming commercial heroes, a coming of age movie which is not really depressing but mildly sad enough to make you feel passionate about.\n\nThe new template nowadays seems to be having an important event at the start of film or a surprise factor so that we could go back and see what’s that about, in the rest of the film. Similarly, here too the protagonist is in the court, hurt, telling about his past, why he’s a loser. No, don’t ask me whether the court will have all the time to hear his story. It’s not that kind of a movie.\n\nVijay (Sai Dharam Tej) explains about how he’s a loser because of various factors. It’s not something really appealing. But on the surface level, it works for a commercial movie. The only good thing to have happened to him is his lover Lahari (Kalyani Priyadarshan), I loved her other name ‘Lorry’ though. Lahari is someone who believes whatever people say. Even though that sounds dumb AF, thanks to the cuteness and the sincerity through which she has performed, it was lovely to watch her. Third character, whom I thought to be the third vertex in love triangle, Swecha (Nivetha Pethuraj) was actually not a lover or a one side lover but someone who’s judgmental on just about anyone. On paper its as pathetic as it could be with a so-called loser whom we couldn’t empathize, a kid who’d listen to just about anyone and a judgmental stern-faced bitch. But somehow the director seems to have convinced them to do it in more human likeable way so that we can see a bit of goodness in them. I don’t know why people are so hell bent in casting Nivetha Pethuraj in same kind of role, either the makers or her has to take a conscious decision and do something else.\n\nI was not aware of Sai Dharam Tej before but he did his job well in the movie by not being over dramatic or over pathetic. Kalyani Priyadarshan too was such a doll and her costumes were so lovable. The last I liked a heroine for her costume in the movie was Alia in ‘Dear Zindagi’ but that at least looks fashionable and filmy. Here she looks lovely as an everyday woman.\n\nApart from acting, the movie hinges on a couple of incidents, a TASMAC scene and few songs, which were actually nice. The director sustains the interest of the audience reasonably well through his antics which doesn’t only look like gimmicks. The ambulance and SIM card idea gives skeleton to the film so that it moves forward but doesn’t really keep you want to know about the movie. The film can be considered a low scale ‘3 Idiots’ kind of movie where it doesn’t really go heavy duty and move you to tears but keeps you engaged enough to pass your time.\n\nA reasonably interesting story led down by bad acting and direction\n\nI don’t know how this film got national award that year. Were the other movies in Telugu worse than this or just because it had a national message it was selected? The entire movie lacked coherence, scenes were misplaced and acting was elementary like a school project. It felt like how I felt when I watched ‘4 students’, after it become a sensation in Malayalam film industry. These were topics which were beaten to death in Tamil cinema and even if otherwise it wasn’t made interestingly.\n\nThe film opens with an interesting shootout scene between the mafia landlord Irfan Khan (Pavan Malhotra) and police. Somehow the setting got me reminded of ‘Sarfarosh’, may be because of the time period of the film and the way it looked. As Irfan’s brother dies in the shootout, he plans for a revenge of him and tries to escape after forty days. The plan looks decent when he says but it remains a question of how it’ll be executed because he asks for four boys outside his gang so that no one would get any doubts. Parallelly we get to know the story of four boys and a girl who have some or the other problems. A typical lazy writing with characters which would come to mind immediately when you think of hijacking.\n\nWe get to know of these characters one by one on how they struggle for money but it still remains curious as to how they’d be able to pull such a big act. Meanwhile we get a song where they all dance in rain, one of the fathers who needs dialysis and other regular template scenes. The motivation to do such big crime is not inspiring. But only during interval we get to know that they indeed were not trying to do the crime. Instead they kidnap him so that they could get fifty lakhs from government.\n\nThe very twist was silly. But I guess where it went wrong is, the director didn’t have idea whether to make it a sarcastic or a serious film post that. As impossible it might be to just escape with a king of mafia. At least post that it could have been something passionate like how people get kidnapped in ‘Samurai’ or be a fun film where they don’t know what to do with him.\n\nOf course, they don’t know what to do with him. One of them says out the name, one of them goes without mask and all these scenes which you write when you’re given a compulsory homework, appears on screen. The humor too doesn’t work. Their amateurish nature only irritates as to why they’d be doing such an act. On top of it, the acting of Pavan Malhotra was over the top. He didn’t have the charm of a gang leader. If it had to be made in as funny psycho kind of way, cue could have been taken from Paresh Rawal’s character in ‘Kshana Kshanam’. Because there is one specific scene towards the climax where he’d be shooing off a monitor lizard when his men appear. Those are the scene which should have induced genuine laughs but bad acting spoils that too.\n\nAfter everything, the way all decide not to take the money and how it returns back to them again didn’t work at all. It was done in a more fun way in a not so famous movie called ‘Pudhayal’ where even though it was not meant to be taken seriously, worked as a great fun film. Here I was flabbergasted with the intention.\n\nMorbid masterpiece\n\nThe posters of Irrfan and Tabu was misleading. The story felt more haunted and the poster had a certain bit of togetherness between Tabu and Irfaan. But when you watch the film you get to know that there is absolutely no togetherness between them. It’s about individual tyranny and they suffer in their own way. It would have been better if I had read and understood Macbeth, I could have appreciated the nuances of direction and writing but even without it, it works just as brilliant as a standalone film.\n\nVishal Bharadwaj is a master craftsman when directing from Shakespeare epic. You feel like he’s someone who has truly understood the meaning of the masterpiece. Plus, he’s a musician. So that’s an icing on the cake. That makes him think about the film in a poetic way. That’s why the Shakespearean morbidity works so beautifully for him. Just like how it works for Sanjay Leela Bhansali whose works and romance are so ingenuine too, like a Shakespearean act.\n\nThe film opens with a bang and sarcasm right from scene one. Inspector Pandit (Om Puri) and Inspector Purohit (Naseeruddin Shah) fiddle with someone before killing him. Both being brilliant actors, the villainy just seeps through them. They light up the screen like anything and set the tone of the film right away. We get introduced to the other two characters Maqbool (Irrfan Khan) and Kaka (Piyush Mishra) next in a drinking scene. Just imagine all of them in a single room and drinking together. Seriously too much power on the screen, it feels like each one is teaching you acting in a separate way and you can’t grasp it. Everybody being performers, even a slight twitch of the muscle looks like a cinematic miracle. Most surprising of the lot was Om Puri whom I always imagined to be a wise guy, so to see him as a bad guy was so much fun.\n\nThen there is Nimmi (Tabu), a charmingly cunning female who swoons you right away. Tabu in Vishal Bharadwaj’s movie is always great. She has some discreet charm about her. Loved her cunningness, just like how the lady in ‘Gone Girl’ behaves. And the best of the lot, Abbaji (Pankaj Kapur) comes at the last. The one who controls everyone. With so little movement he exhibits so much authority. One interesting titbit is that Kamal was actually supposed to act as Maqbool but that failed but in a way that was good too. He’d have stolen the limelight. Here it was about Abbaji more than anyone. I don’t think Kamal would have been so vulnerable like Irrfan.\n\nThere is something cynical about the movie throughout. There is not a word of good about the people we see so we don’t really care who lives or who dies. That’s the zone which Vishal Bharadwaj keeps us through his writing. The first half is entirely about setting about the character, the charm of underworld, how happy people who are in power could be and all of that and things take a dark turn when one of them move out of position and commit a crime out of passion, instead of doing it as a job, that jeopardizes the whole situation. I think that’s the rule of any mafia, you do what you ought to do. Anything apart from it would put you deep in dumbs, unless if you’re the one who’s going to start a mafia. A typical Scorsese thing.\n\nIf the first half holds the interest, its actually the second half which makes the film epic. How each character turn against each other and how whatever they do affect them. The hallucination of the leads especially is haunting. That’s where it psychologically affects us as viewers as well. The change of tone from a crime drama to personal morbidity worked beautifully because the transition was seamless. When I think about it, I can’t select a specific scene after which it happened. Generally, that’s the mistake which amateur directors do where they split one part and another through a single act which doesn’t happen in reality. It’s just some lazy writing. In reality a sequence of events leads to a sequence of things which change the consequence. This single act difference works only for sci-fi where things have to look sudden.\n\nEven though ‘Haider’ is a more celebrated film amongst his. This film impacted me a lot personally."
