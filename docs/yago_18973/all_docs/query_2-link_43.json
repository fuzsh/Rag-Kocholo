        "text": "This article deals with architecture, temple design, and art in ancient India and also with continuity between Harappan and historical art and writing. It fills in the gap in the post-Harappan, pre-Buddhist art of India by calling attention to the structures of northwest India (c. 2000 BC) that are reminiscent of late-Vedic themes, and by showing that there is preponderant evidence in support of the identity of the Harappan and the Vedic periods. Vedic ideas of sacred geometry and their transformation into the classical Hindu temple form are described. It is shown that the analysis of the \" Vedic house \" by Coomaraswamy and Renou, which has guided generations of Indologists and art historians, is incorrect. This structure that was taken by them to be the typical Vedic house actually deals with the temporary shed that is established in the courtyard of the house in connection with householder's ritual. The temple form and its iconography are shown as natural expansion of Vedic ideology related to recursion, change and equivalence. The centrality of recursion in Indian art is discussed.\n\nThis article begins with general ideas on cosmology that are essential to situate Indian thinking on the physical world, and then takes up different aspects related to physical law and chemistry. The Vedantic description of transformation of atoms into energy under certain conditions is described. The Vaiśeṣika system is presented in terms of the main propositions on motion and force and ensuing inferences. Further sections include the treatment of relativity of motion by Āryabhaṭa, transformation and evolution, conceptions of atoms and molecules, acoustics and music. The article closes out with a broad summary of Indian chemistry.\n\nRasa, meaning gist, is the essence that one feels when experience an art piece, be it performance or static art. Rasa, in Indian context, applied to both the performer and the audience is considered an alaukika (other worldly) experience. An integral part of aesthetics both Indian and Greek (although European performing arts moved away from the original concept of Greek aesthetics) is improvisation on the rules that are suggested for a clear structure, which by definition is fluid and allows room for ‘newness. Using Bharat Gupt’s study of the poetics and Natyashastra, this paper will focus on similarities in both Indian and Greek aesthetics, also highlighting when and why contemporary notion of aesthetics in European theatre moved away from the Greek, which was more similar to the Indian sensibility. There will also be a focus on the concept of hieropraxis (art as worship, pleasing both people and Gods), which was common, both to Indian and Greek art forms. Finally, the paper will illustrate through examples of Bollywood and interviews with BharatNatyam teachers (in Sweden) how improvisation, and newness is brought into various aspects of performance arts, thereby challenging Sheldon Pollock’s reading of the Natyashastra, as being rigid and frozen in time and devoid of bringing novelty, making them irrelevant to our times."
