        "text": "Homepage\n\nBollywood\n\nNews\n\nGanesh Chaturthi 2021: How Lata Mangeshkar, Sonu Sood, Subhash Ghai And Others Celebrate The Festival And Bring Ganpati To Their Homes\n\nHere's looking at how Lata Mangeshkar, Sonu Sood, Subhash Ghai and others celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi every year.\n\nEvery year in the Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar’s home Prabhu Kunj on Peddar Road, the Ganpati Festival is a period of great joy and celebration. The doors of the famous Mangeshkar home are thrown open for family and friends. The entire Mangeshkar clan of four sisters, one brother and the spouses and children throw in their fervour for a fortnight, all professional commitments forgotten for the interim.\n\nGanesh Chaturthi is the socially most active time of the year for Lata ji. She once said to me, “We Mangeshkars give a lot of importance to Ganesh Chaturthi. We celebrate it for the full period of its occurrence. Relatives and guests are welcome all day long. It is the one time when the entire family comes together .Yes, I’d describe it as the happiest time of the year. For me my family means happiness.”\n\nOn the other end of town in Juhu, movie moghul JP Dutta and his wife Bindiya Goswami treat Ganesh Chaturthi with just as much reverence and affection as the Mangeshkars. For the Duttas, Ganesh Chaturthi holds a special significance.\n\nSays Bindiya, “When our younger daughter Siddhi was born JP left us at Breach Candy and drove towards the SiddhiVinayak temple.Would you believe it, at 2 am in the morning the temple lights were on and the temple services were in full swing! JP went inside.There was a pundit in the temple and no visitor except JP. At that moment he felt a divine connection with Ganeshji. We decided to name our daughter Siddhi and host a Ganesh Chaturthi celebration in our house . We’ve maintained that tradition for 15 years now ever since Siddhi was born.”\n\nBindiya considers their open-house Ganesh Chaturthi celebration the equivalent of the Punjabi langar. “Anyone can come to the house anytime during Ganesh Chaturthi. We spend days and weeks decorating the Ganesh idol. Every year my daughters and I do a different theme on the idol.We’ve the priests from the Siddhi Vinayak temple coming in the morning and evening for the aarti. Yes, like Lata ji said to you, this is the best, most peaceful and purifying time of the year. JP experienced a miracle with Ganesh’s blessings. And it’s JP’s mannat that Ganeshji should come home for the last 16 years. ”\n\nThe Duttas host a seven-day Ganesh celebration in their home. A similar fervour is shared by various other families in Bollywood. It’s a Maharashtrian thing, to a large extent.\n\nSays Subhash Ghai, “We’ve been bringing Ganpati home for decades .And we feel blessed. If you grow up in Maharashtra you grow up with Ganpati being a part of your life. It is everywhere.In your emotions, spirit, mind and soul and when the annual Ganesh Chaturthi happens all those emotions connected to Ganesh bubble to the surface.”\n\nWhat gives Shabana Azmi added joy during the festive season this year is that Eid and Ganesh Chaturthi fall on the same day.\n\nSays Shabana, “My sister-in-law Tanvi brings Ganpati home. This year it feels terrific because we celebrate Eid and Ganesh Chaturthi back-to-back.This year we go straight from Biryani to Modak! Such is India’s syncratic culture, which I’m proud to be part of.”\n\nShabana recalls many Ganesh Chaturthis from her childhood. “As children my brother Baba and I would be taken to Sarvajanik Ganpati mandals in our area in Girgaum. I have extremely warm memories of those visits.I love the mangalmurti aarti. Many of my close friends bring Ganesha home.And we go visiting them.Among the people we visit are Neetu,Rishi Kapoor, Rani Mukherjee, Anil Kapoor and his wife Sunita, Mona Kapoor(producer Boney Kapoor’s ex-wife) and Manish Malhotra. No other country boasts as many religious festivals as we do. The diversity of religious celebrations is our strength. Abba(father Kaifi Azmi) used to be big on celebrating all festivals.We carry the tradition forward.”\n\nPoet-lyricist Prasoon Joshi who grew up in North India became familiar with Ganesh Chaturthi later in his life. “I love the festival! In my growing years I had only heard of it.But over the years in Mumbai I’ve become very attached to the whole celebration. I don’t bring Ganesh home. But I join friends every year. I think it is one of the most beautiful festivals in the world.”\n\nFor outsiders the Ganesh Chaturthi is quite a cultural delight. Tamilian superstar Hema Malini and her two daughters religiously go through the Ganesh Chaturthi each year. Sameera Reddy who is originally from Andhra Pradesh observes this festival with her family.\n\nActor Samir Soni who is from Delhi and singer Rekha Bhardwaj say Ganesh Chaturthi has no ritualistic significance for them .\n\nSays Soni, “Growing up in Delhi where it is not a big event it’s never had a huge importance in my life other than the frenzy it generates on the roads. But I do visit friends in Mumbai for darshan and Ganpati meals. Other than that I believe God is within us and an extremely private relationship. Hence I shy away from public demonstration of devotion.”\n\nRekha Bhardwaj says Ganapati is everywhere in her house, and yet not a reason for religious celebration. “I don’t follow any religion. I don’t do Ganpati puja. I’ve done Ganpati and Navratri puja when my son Aasman was very young to familiarise him with all this.And I’ve lots of Ganapati idols at home that I’ve collected over the years.”\n\nDirector Abhinay Deo who is the son of the veteran stage and film actors Ramesh & Seema Deo says the Ganpati was never a part of their home. “Our family never got the Ganpati home. But I’ve lots of childhood memories attached to the Festival.”\n\nFor Punjab-born Sonu Sood, however, Ganesh Chaturthi is very important. “I’ve been keeping Ganapati for the past eleven years and I look forward to it every year.This year I am shooting in Mysore. But I’ll be home for a day to bring Ganapati in.”\n\nSays Sameera, “Ganesh utsav is very important to me.He is vigneshwar(the obstacle remover). He gives stability and new beginnings.We are devotees of the GSB Seva Mandal. My family has been its patrons for years.”\n\nShatrughan Sinha and his wife began bringing Ganesh home when their twins Luv and Kush were born. Lately the practice has been aborted because of the family’s traveling plans.\n\nSays Shatru’s wife Poonam, “Ganesh Chaturthi is very important for us. Ganesh is the God of all auspicious beginnings in our lives. Nothing moves without His blessings.We did bring Ganpati Bappa into our home Ramayan for 14 years after Luv and Kush were born. Hamare Luv,Kush and Sonakshi Ganpatiji ki kripa hai hamare oopar. Because of our schedules we discontinued the Ganapati at our home. But we visit Ganapati at relatives and friends’ homes.\"\n\nShilpa Shetty has recently begun bringing Ganpati home. “This is the second year he’s gracing our home.I will continue the practice as long as I can. I’m a huge believer in Lalbaugcha Raja.So I get a miniature version of Him at home.”\n\nThough married into a Muslim family Ayesha Takiya observes the Ganpati season with gusto. “My grandmother keeps a Ganpati at home for 1 ½ days.Since childhood me and my sister and cousins went with our grandmother to select the flowers and jewelry for the idol and of course to taste the sweets. My grandmother’s coconut modak is everyone’s favourite. Each year for Ganpati the entire family gathers together at my great grandparents’ home in Colaba.All us girls used to go for the immersion. No more. Now we wait at home. It’s a sad moment when Ganesh leaves.”\n\nTV actress and BJP politician Smriti Irani is a diehard Ganapati devotee. “Every year for the last 11 years we are fortunate to have Ganapati come home to bless our family. It’s an occasion for us to give thanks for all the good health and success bestowed on us.”\n\nTV and film actor Ronit Roy has become a Ganapati convert in recent years. “We have Ganapati home for 1 ½ days.We’ve been observing this tradition for the last six-seven years. My wife started the practice. I followed her.”\n\nGanapati songs and sequences shot during the immersion in Mumbai are prevalent in Hindi cinema. Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan have shot Ganapati songs in Don and Wanted,respectively. Salman, in fact, was looking forward to celebrating both Ganapati and Eid in his home this year. All festivity in the Khan residence has been rudely interrupted by the superstar’s illness.\n\nThe entire climax of Bejoy Nambiar’s Shaitaan was shot during the Ganapati visarjan in Mumbai and then edited into the film.\n\nSays filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, “If you’re a part of Mumbai Ganesh utsav is an intrinsic part of your being. I’ve grown up with the images of the festival . They’re embedded deep in my psyche.And they signify a great sense of spiritual exhilaration for me. There is no getting away from Ganapati in Mumbai.”\n\nImage Source: Instagram/lata_mangeshkar/azmishabana18/subhashghai1/samirsoni123/sonu_sood/theshilpashetty/smritiiraniofficial/beingsalmankhan\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Matrix Resurrections Trailer OUT: Priyanka Chopra Is Unmissable As She Aids Keanu Reeves' Neo And Teases With Mystery\n\nDon't Miss\n\n9X Tashan Yaaran Da Podcast: Episode 44 With Ali Brothers\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may like\n\nGanesh Chaturthi 2021: Divyanka Tripathi, Arjun Bijlani, Rahul Vaidya And Others Beam With Joy As They Bring Ganpati Home-See PICS ­­­­­­­­­\n\nAmruta Khanvilkar Is Eagerly Waiting For The Arrival Of Ganpati Bappa, Watch Her Fun VIDEO ­­­­­­­­­\n\nGanesh Chaturthi 2021: 5 Easy Maharashtrian Recipies For Your Bappa To Make Your Naivedya Extra Special ­­­­­­­­­\n\nEntertainment News Round Up: Shilpa Shetty Welcomes Lord Ganesha, Vidyut Jammwal On Sidharth Shukla; Man Hit By Rajat Bedi's Car Dies ­­­­­­­­­\n\nAmitabh Bachchan Gives The First Glimpse Of This Year's Ganpati Celebrations At The Iconic Lalbaugcha Raja ­­­­­­­­­\n\nGaneshotsav 2021: 7 Marathi Ganpati Songs That Are A Must-Have For Your Festive Playlist ­­­­­­­­­"
