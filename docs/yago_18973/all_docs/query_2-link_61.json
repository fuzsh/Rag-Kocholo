        "text": "A timely tip-off from a retired police officer averted what could have possibly been a murderous attack on Kamal Haasan. Apparently, this benefactor, an old Kamal Haasan fan, advised the actor not to travel alone under any circumstance, as his life was in danger.\n\nHaasan was warned on Wednesday when the verdict on the screening of his banned film Viswaroopam was awaited in Tamil Nadu.\n\nConfirming this, Kamal said: “Yes, I was warned. I wouldn't want to name the kind gentleman since his life would also be jeopardised. But yes, I was told not to travel alone.”\n\nNevertheless, the actor says he isn't afraid to die. “Death is what my opponents desire for me anyway. Creative death. Besides, Jan 30 would have been a good day for me to be killed. My Bapuji (Mahatma Gandhi) was killed on this day,” said Kamal, who had directed Hey Ram, a film on Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse in 2000.\n\nHe says he would anyway die if he is barred from making movies freely.\n\n“I don’t understand politics. I am not a politician. I am a film-maker and an actor. If I am not allowed to make the movies that I want to, I will die. It is as simple a s that,” he said.\n\nHe says, “I spoke at the press conference in Chennai about leaving the country and working in exile. Why should my fans feel shocked at my departure? Subhash Chandra Bose did it, didn't he? He moved out of the country in the latter part of his life, and still remained a true Indian patriot. The same goes for me.”\n\n“No matter where I go, I will remain a Tamilian and an Indian. No one can take away my national identity,” he added.\n\nIn another interview, Kamal said his phone had been tapped and he has a track record of women spoiling his premiere plans, taking a clear dig at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\n\nJAYA blames kamal for the fiasco\n\nMeanwhile, at a press conference in Chennai on Thursday, Jayalalithaa slammed Kamal Haasan for not agreeing to submit early his movie to Muslim protesters .\n\nShe said the entire controversy over the film could have been avoided had Kamal screened the multi-lingual thriller to representatives of 24 Muslim groups who objected to some portions.\n\nShe said Haasan, who has produced and directed the movie besides playing the lead role, cancelled a screening for them at the last moment.\n\nOn the losses Kamal Haasan and his production house would incur due to the 15-day ban in Tamil Nadu, she said he was “a responsible adult” who took a calculated risk in pledging all his property against the movie.\n\nIt was his decision and the government was not responsible for that, she said.\n\nShe also ridiculed charges that she had acted against the movie because she had a grudge against Kamal and because the latter had implicitly batted for Finance Minister P Chidambaram as India’s prime minister.\n\n“I have been in politics for more than 30 years to know that Kamal Haasan does not select the PM of this country...“I have no personal grudge, no personal interest in banning the movie. There is no political vendetta,” she said."
