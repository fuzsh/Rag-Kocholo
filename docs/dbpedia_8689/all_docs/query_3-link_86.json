        "text": "After many years as the shining jewel in Simon Cowell's X Factor machine, Lewis is finally striking out on her own.\n\nAfter the release on 2012's Glass Heart album the singer wasn't sure if she wanted to carry on in the music business. She may have been phenomenally successful but she had never seemed totally at ease in the industry.\n\nApproaching 30, she carried on writing music but only for her own pleasure, unsure what to do next.\n\nA chance encounter with Fleetwood Mac legend Stevie Nicks after an intimate gig for the band changed all that. Lewis is a huge Nicks fan and couldn't believe it when her idol rushed over to her.\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN TO FIVE TRACKS FROM LEWIS' NEW ALBUM\n\n“She grabbed hold of me, hugged me and started singing my song to me,\" the overwhelmed Lewis remembers.\n\n\"She sang Bleeding Love and then she was like, 'You have to keep going, we need you, we need your music.'\n\n\"She won’t know what a huge impression she made on me and how much she inspired me and inspired this record but she did give me that spur of encouragement.\n\n\"She is awesome. Everyone needs a Stevie in their life,” she laughs.\n\nLISTEN TO A PREVIEW OF LEONA'S NEW ALBUM I AM\n\nThe new album I Am is deeply personal, filled with references to Lewis' new-found sense of identity and voice.\n\nWe were lucky enough to attend Lewis' electrifying album preview gig and were struck by how liberated and exhilarated she seemed.\n\nOn title track Leona sings powerfully about being “stronger without you” and on the ballad You Knew Me When, she insists, “I’m not the me I used to be.”\n\nThe intimate and moving Thank You is a heartfelt dedication to the support she has always received from her parents.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You are!’\n\n\"They’ve supported me, especially over the last couple of years but also when I was growing up there was a lot of sacrifice, so that song is dedicated to them.”\n\nHappily settled at her new label Island Records, Lewis' vocals are as glorious as ever, but she has also finally found her voice.\n\nLeona Lewis' new album I Am is out on September 11."
