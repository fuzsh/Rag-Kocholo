        "text": "Re: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nSo one of the members on DS has posted this, they aren't the normal source, so I ain't 100% confident with it, but the person who I do trust reckons its true as the way its written reminds him of the same source he talks too. So its up to you whether you believe it or not. The person who posted is a regular member though, so I can't see them just lying.\n\n- Leona IS recording for a new era. This will take time. Island records have teamed up with Def Jam on her project in the US. There are great plans and the new music is sounding nothing short of amazing.\n\n- She has really not forgotten her fans... She loves us an appreciates our loyalty... On the other hand, great things are now really happening for Leona's career and her fans. They have a plan which my source says will start this year... So we should hear great things very soon!\n\n- Leona is a world super star artist, you know, and she is now managed by a US team. Great things mostly start in the US and usually have US involvement. Syco is UK based but she has now left Syco to peruse a worldwide career with major labels and situations in the US.\n\n- Leona is working hard in studios accross the US.\n\nI especially hope the Def Jam and the plans to start this year are true, I just want things to kick off and Leona to tell us these things.\n\nThis might as well say 'Leona is a woman'. What a heap of non-information.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nThis might as well say 'Leona is a woman'. What a heap of non-information.\n\nThey have gave us information, that is if they are telling the truth.\n\nWe never knew about her label teaming up with Def Jam for the project in the US, and I think that is a huge deal, so I'm very grateful for the news.\n\nPlus they said things would start very soon, and Leona hadn't said that since moving labels I believe, so we were sort of in the dark about when things would happen, a lot of people thought nothing would happen this year. And it turns out this is true, considering her managers tweet and the fact she has had an album photoshoot.\n\nPlus they seem to put a lot of emphasis on the US in those comments, leading me to believe they plan on focusing their aswell.\n\nOverall I took a fair bit away from that, and when things are very quiet on the news front, stuff like that helps.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nDoes anyone else not want this album to be released this year? I love Leona, I want her to do well and unless she has an absolute behemoth of a single up her sleeve I can see the same thing happening to her again. I would much rather her tackle the international market all at once in January when it is traditionally quiet.\n\nMaybe a single this quarter if it is strong enough.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nI don't know. I could easily deal with an album every year. I want her to smash, she deserves it, but I don't think it's going to happen so I'd settle with her being one of those artists who are \"all about the fans\". Although where's their passion if they're not getting success?\n\nDoesn't really matter if she finds a strong song, someone will insist on making an inferior song the lead single and we'll all be scratching our heads. As per.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nI don't know. I could easily deal with an album every year.

As per.\n\nNo offence but she really doesn't seem like she's all about the fans?! I mean ya, she likes them but Lovebird/every shitty single choice/poor international releases/poor promo/no Glassheart single etc. etc.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nThen again, if your label is making crappy decisions that have a negative impact on your career, I can understand why you'd lose motivation somewhat. I imagine it's like going to work at a job you're no longer passionate about, for bosses who don't give a shit (or maybe I imagine Leona was in this position because I'm in it right now... unpack the violins, etc.).\n\nA new label could be the fresh start she needs in terms of her being inspired to put the work in to re-establish herself.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nSomeone uploaded the alternate versions of Bleeding Love and Better In Time, plus a crap pre X Factor song called Never Say Goodbye and an extended mix of I See You. Oh and all the official Echo instrumentals.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joaophsantos...ive?in=joaophsantos/sets/alternative-versions\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joaophsantos...ive?in=joaophsantos/sets/alternative-versions\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joaophsantos/never-say-goodbye\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leonapandora/01-i-see-you-pandora-mix\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joaophsantos/sets/leona-lewis-echo-official-instrumentals\n\nBleeding Love's ending is a little different, Better In Time has a some differences in the lyrics and instrumental.\n\nThanks. The alternate version of Bleeding Love has been taken down. Can you find a mirror so I can listen?\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nGlad she was honest enough to write that. That's quite unlike her really.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, I can't help but feel that her star has dwindled so much that she'll never be as big as she could have been. We've no real evidence yet that she can write that massive monster smash single herself and I just can't see any of the big writers willingly giving a huge song to her when there are females singers out there who are far more popular and of the moment. Particularly because her voice clearly isn't as good as it used to be. It's so sad because she had the potential.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - General Discussion\n\nReally didn't think Leona would write an open letter about Syco, shows what a shitty little label they are, glad she got out of it and managed to get them to not say they dropped her, maybe Simon intervened, he has always and even is still being very supportive of her, so I could see him stopping that happening.\n\nI think this letter is coming out now because they are gearing up to start this album campaign, we know she did the photoshoot last week for the album, so this letter is funny timing imo.\n\nEdit: Sure enough, I just checked twitter and Leona's manager has just tweeted this,\n\nexcitement in the air. the passion is real.\n\nSomethings coming, I can feel it. Haha"
