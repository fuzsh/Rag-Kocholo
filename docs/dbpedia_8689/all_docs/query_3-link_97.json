        "text": "It would help if Leona released great music.\n\nI know Leona has a lot of loyal fans who insist that the new album is excellent. Well, I think Leona has proved to be an excellent female vocalist since her X Factor days, but apart from Fire Under My Feet, I've not been wowed by any of the other songs I've heard from the new album.\n\nEach song sounds like it's trying to be an already successful song. FUMF = Rolling In The Deep. I Am sounds like it's trying to be Heaven by Emeli Sande. Another Love Song sounds like an album track off Avicii's last album. There's nothing \"Leona\" about her new album.\n\nI'd be happier if there was an album of mostly ballads to the quality of I See You (the song from Avatar) which gave me goosebumps when I first heard it. I'm just not getting this new album at all.\n\n0\n\nHer career is far from over.\n\nHer US single is in the iTunes top 200, her album is in the iTunes top 30 in the US. She's got some major promo coming up in the form of Ellen DeGeneres and James Corden in the US. 'Thunder' is also top 30 on the official Hot Adult Contemporary Billboard charts in America.\n\nEDIT: Oops my opening line is a copy of the two posts above me.\n\n0\n\nSYCO weren't the problem, it was always Leona. No matter how good the music, public interest will plummet if you're a dry performer. She may have the vocal chops like Mariah and Whitey, but she lacked massively in presence and personality.\n\nThe more control Leona has of her career, the more it will burn out quickly. I mean this is the woman whom rejected We Found Love!\n\n0\n\nSYCO weren't the problem, it was always Leona. No matter how good the music, public interest will plummet if you're a dry performer. She may have the vocal chops like Mariah and Whitey, but she lacked massively in presence and personality.\n\nThe more control Leona has of her career, the more it will burn out quickly. I mean this is the woman whom rejected We Found Love!\n\nAgree with that and not just about Leona. Just because you're a talented singer doesn't mean you have any idea how to run your career. There are very few Taylor Swifts or Madonnas or Streisands, who seem to have been born with that business sense\n\n0\n\nThere does appear to be a few desperate moves coming from camp Leona. Selling on Grindr and already priced at £5.99/£6.99 on Itunes are hardly the moves of an artist in demand.\n\nLeona's career as a major artist does appear to be in danger, but she still has an incredible voice she just needs help finding that big comeback single.\n\n0\n\nI'm not really a Leona fan, I haven't listened to any of her music for a long time. I don't wish bad on her though. She has a fantastic voice, but she's never had the right material in my opinion.\n\nI've always preferred smaller venues to arenas so I'd be pleased about seeing her in a small place if I was going to see her.\n\n0\n\nLeona was never going to big massive long term.\n\nNo matter what her fans want to believe she does'nt have \"Star\" quality.\n\nShe seems to be a lovely person with a good voice (though even this seems to be waning going by some recent performances) and she was lucky enough to be given a World stage with appearing on the X Factor and having Cowell behind her.\n\nOnce the glow of the X Factor began to disappear so did a lot of people's interest in her and she herself just didnt have enough keep a lot of people interested in her.\n\n0\n\nHer career will continue but she won't be having commericial success again.\n\nI agree. I think Leona is at the same point of her career now where Alexandra Burke was in 2012 after Heartbreak On Hold underperformed in the charts. It took Alexandra a while to find her bearings but she has reinvented herself as a west end star.\n\nI think Leona could do something similar.\n\n0\n\nShe doesn't have star personality and that counts for a lot these days, She comes across as dull and whether she is or not the fact she seems dull will make people think she is\n\nSimilar issue for Pixie Lott, People like her but she is boring\n\n0\n\nThe album is now 5.99 for the standard and 6.99 for the deluxe on iTunes.\n\nGlad I didn't pay full price for it last week!\n\nkinda taking the piss out of the hardcore fans isn't it....how does anyone who bought it for £12 feel about it being half that price 3 days later.\n\n£11.99 did seem a bit ambitious though, what were they thinking, nobody has paid that for an album since the 90's\n\n0\n\nI had a quick listen to her new album and it's absolute shit. She should have stuck with Cowell and done a covers album.\n\nI dare say you're right about sticking with Cowell.\n\nAs Joni Mitchell once sang \"you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone\". Rings very true in this case. Leona went top 3 in December 2013 with One More Sleep.\n\nI'm sure she would love to still have that type of impact but the fact is, her new album has so many weak songs that nobody will remember in 3 months time yet alone 3 years.\n\n0\n\nFantastic voice but she's had crap material for years and I don't think it's going to change anytime soon under Syco or Island.\n\nAs mentioned above, all the songs are b-side versions of other successful songs.\n\nI don't think her career is over as such, she's still got a big fan base who will buy her songs.\n\n0"
