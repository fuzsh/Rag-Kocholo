        "text": "Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton Honored\n\nWHAT\n\nTickets are available for the upcoming Global Down Syndrome Foundation (Global) Be Beautiful Be Yourself DC Gala, a high-style fashion show and fundraiser taking place at the Mayflower Hotel. More than 19 models with Down syndrome—many from the DC region—will take to the runway during the event, which features a performance by British singer/songwriter and philanthropist Leona Lewis. Known for chart toppers such as “Bleeding Love,” Lewis has already sold more than 20 million albums. Other celebrities include HLN’s Kyra Phillips, Fox News’ John Roberts, and members of Congress. During the event, Global will honor Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton with the Quincy Jones Exceptional Advocacy Award for their support of those with Down syndrome.\n\nWHEN\n\nWednesday, May 7, 2014; 6:00 p.m. — Reception; 7:15 p.m. — Dinner, fashion show, live auction and Leona Lewis performance\n\nWHO\n\nLeona Lewis, singer/songwriter\n\n25 models with Down syndrome, escorted by celebrities and members of Congress\n\nHonoree Sen.

Down syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal condition, affecting an estimated 400,000 Americans, but is the least-funded genetic condition by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), securing an infinitesimal portion of NIH’s annual budget.
