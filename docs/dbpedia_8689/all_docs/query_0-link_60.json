        "text": "Leona Lewis has reportedly been dropped from her record label Island Records, a label under Universal.\n\nUniversal is planning on keeping Lewis in the Universal group by signing her to another label under the umbrella, but there is no word on exactly which label that will be.\n\nLewis signed with Simon Cowell‘s record label Syco after she won X Factor in 2006, but creative differences on her fifth album caused their separation in 2014. Lewis later signed with Island Records where she released her fifth album I Am in 2015, which flopped tremendously on the UK charts, selling only 8,500 copies in its first week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Sun Newspaper of Britain, “It simply didn’t work out with Island. She made a great record and the label really championed her, but something just didn’t click.” A source told the paper: “… There has been interest from other labels too, but right now she’s concentrating on her debut in Cats.”"
