        "text": "According to a new interview with the Daily Star, British singer and X Factor UK winner Leona Lewis reveals that she was originally asked to record the vocals on “We Found Love,” the track produced by Calvin Harris and ultimately made a huge hit by Rihanna.\n\n“I worked with Calvin and we recorded ‘We Found Love,’ but he went touring with Rihanna and she ended up releasing it,” Lewis reportedly said. “I didn’t commit to it because I wanted ‘Trouble’ to be my first single, so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better.”\n\nPHOTOS: VMAs 2012: Best and Worst Moments\n\nStill, don’t expect to hear an alternate Leona version anytime soon. “I still have the recording but I’d never leak it; That’s so unprofessional,” the diva told the British tab.\n\nBesides, songs are often passed around from artist to artist until a commitment is made, so other than some good-natured boasting, there’s not much controversy here. Said Lewis: “There are so many songs I’ve recorded, only to hear other people singing them. It happens all the time. It was a bit annoying to see how big a hit it was around the world, but if I’d released it maybe it wouldn’t have done as well.”\n\n“We Found Love” reached No. 1 in over 25 countries."
