        "text": "Leona Lewis is to make her film debut in a musical featuring the songs of Madonna and Cyndi Lauper.\n\nThe film, titled Holiday!, also stars comedian Katy Brand. It will be directed by Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini, the team behind the successful StreetDance franchise.\n\nThe move into film could prove to be a wise decision. Her last single, \"Lovebird\", failed to chart in the top 200. However, the X Factor winner is said to be readying a Christmas album with \"quite a Motown feel\".\n\nLewis appeared to be excited about the movie on Twitter.\n\n\"Feeling very lucky to be part of a project in which everyone is so passionate and supportive of one another,\" she tweeted. \"I'm loving the experience.\"\n\nAnother post read: \"Just wrapped for the day! So excited for you guys to see this, such great moments being captured. Lucky to work with amazingly talented people.\"\n\nThe movie, which is shooting in the UK and Italy, will feature songs including Wham's \"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\" and \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" by Cyndi Lauper."
