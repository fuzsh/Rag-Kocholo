        "text": "â€” It's certainly a good month to be a diva.\n\nJust before Mariah Carey is expected to storm the U.S. pop charts, import Leona Lewis has become the first British solo artist to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard tally, having sold 205,000 copies of her debut, Spirit, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nBoth artists have a connection to television juggernaut American Idol, the vocal competition show that's become a consistent supplier of hits to the music industry. Last week was Carey week on Idol, in which the contestants tackled the songs of the pop superstar, and Lewis was the 2006 champion of a similarly minded, Simon Cowell-produced British series, The X Factor.\n\n\"A lot of people criticize these shows and ask if we'll ever find a truly international star,\" Cowell says. \"Funnily enough, I said at the beginning of that particular year that my main purpose was to find an artist who could sell all over the world.\"\n\nLewis, who worked odd jobs as a receptionist and waitress while pursuing a music career, says she was talked into auditioning for The X Factor.\n\n\"I had watched the show, but I never thought I was going to go and do it,\" she says. \"But someone said I should just try it, and it was an opportunity. At the end of the day, you should take every opportunity that comes your way.\"\n\nAlthough other winners of The X Factor haven't been given a strong U.S. push, Lewis' Spirit has a contemporary R&B sound that should be familiar to American audiences. Smash single \"Bleeding Love\" is a slow-building Whitney Houston-influenced number, and more upbeat numbers such as \"Forgive Me\" sprinkle in some hip-hop flourishes.\n\n\"I first studied classical, and then went into jazz and blues,\"says Lewis, who cites American vocalists such as Eva Cassidy and Minnie Riperton as influences and is signed to Cowell's Syco Music.\n\nLewis' Spirit also represents the first full-on partnership between Cowell and Clive Davis' J Records. Davis, known for finding Bruce Springsteen, Santana and Houston, among others, has overseen the careers of many an Idol star, including Kelly Clarkson and Daughtry.\n\nDavis and Cowell lined up Alist producers such as Akon and Stargate for Spirit. The album arrived on these shores after securing a No. 1 post in Britain, where it became the fastest-selling debut when it was released in November.\n\nShe also benefited immensely from a March appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in which she performed \"Bleeding Love.\" Soon after, \"Bleeding Love\" went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts.\n\nWith Carey's E=MC2 hitting this week's chart, Lewis isn't expected to repeat at the top, but her momentum shouldn't slow. She's set to appear on Wednesday's American Idol.\n\n\"I feel like I'm just getting started,\" Lewis says. \"People are just kind of hearing about me, and I hope this is setting me to do more things and have a long career.\""
