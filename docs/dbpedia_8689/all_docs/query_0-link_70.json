        "text": "Post by Baronessa on\n\nLeona Louise Lewis (3 April 1985)\n\nVocal Range: C3 - F♯6\n\nWhile it might seem for the more recent generations that Leona Lewis has been around forever, she's actually only one generation behind the most recent contemporary R&B canon of melisma queens. With the help of her springboard to success through winning the 2006 X Factor and signing under Simon Cowell's magnetic label, ever since \"Bleeding Love\" first hit the billboards Leona has continued the legacy of the pop diva while diversifying it with a slightly posh sensibility that defined especially the European R&B of the mid-to-late noughties.\n\nEven though her first album is reaching nostalgic territory by this point, Leona's vocals have only aged gracefully, if not improved, and she continues to be the most successful act to ever come out of the X Factor. She might not go down as among the most artistically inspired of all R&B acts, but Leona's moment at its height will be remembered for making the genre ubiquitously 'pop' in a way that arguably Mariah and Whitney never quite could.\n\nSignificant High Notes:\n\nF♯6 (\"Loving You\")\n\nE6 (\"Lady Marmalade\" live The X Factor 2006, Week 7)\n\nE♭6 (\"Can't Breathe\", \"Power\", \"Take a Bow\")\n\nD6 (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" live The X Factor 2006, Week 6, \"I Am\", \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\")\n\nC♯6 (\"Fireflies\", \"Headlights\", \"Loving You\")\n\nC6 (\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", \"All by Myself\" live The X Factor 2006, Week 10, \"Bleeding Love\" live Brit Awards 2008, \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\", \"Could It Be Magic\" live The X Factor 2006, Week 8, \"The Essence of Me\", \"Happy\", \"L.O.V.E.
