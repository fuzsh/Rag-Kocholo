        "text": "British global singing sensation Leona Lewis has sold over 40 million records worldwide. The singer/songwriter – who is also an actress and philanthropist - reached #1 in over 35 countries with her hit single ‘Bleeding Love’. A vocal powerhouse who is renowned for her vocal range and ability, Lewis is a 3-time GRAMMY Award nominee, 7-time BRIT Award nominee, MTV VMA and World Music Award winner, and has been nominated for MTV EMAs and Billboard Music Awards. Lewis became the first British female solo artist to top the US Billboard 200 album chart in more than 20 years with her debut album Spirit.\n\nAlongside her impressive music career, Leona is an extremely passionate humanitarian and animal rights activist working with organizations such as The Prince’s Trust, RED, MTV Staying Alive, Teenage Cancer Trust, Sports Relief, WWF, Humane Society, World Animal Protection and Hopefield Animal Sanctuary. Leona was nominated for a CMT Award and recognized with the Music Pioneer Award at the United Nations Women’s Entrepreneurship Day.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats playing the highly prestigious role of ‘Grizabella’, performing the world-famous song ‘Memory’. Leona joined up with Calum Scott on ‘You Are The Reason’. The song is certified GOLD in the US with over 460 million video views and 550 million streams. Leona’s first regular role in a TV series came with SONY Crackle in the 50 Cent executive-produced The Oath, filmed in Puerto Rico. In the same year, Leona reunited with superstar songwriter/producer Ryan Tedder, reaching #1 on the US Latin pop and Latin digital song sales charts with ‘Solo Quiero (Somebody To Love)’ featuring Juan Magán and Cali Y El Dandee. Leona was recently announced as Patron of Hackney Empire, and released Christmas, With Love Always, a special repack of her highly successful 2013 festive album Christmas, With Love last November. In 2021 Leona was a judge on the global singing competition from the makers of RuPaul’s Drag Race (World of Wonder) – ‘Queen of the Universe’ – alongside Vanessa Williams, Michelle Visage, and Trixie Mattel. 2022 saw Leona co-compose and appear on the soundtrack for the moving, female-directed documentary Hidden Letters which premiered at Tribeca film Festival and was shortlisted for an Oscar nomination. She also collaborated with Alexis Ffrench on a classical crossover single ‘One Look’ – the stunning video garnered 1 million views in its first few days of release. Leona is currently back in the studio working on new music."
