        "text": "Post by CowboysForever9 on\n\nMy issues with releasing OMH right now mainly focus on the fact that it just doesn't fit or suit the time of year (more than likely this 2nd single will go be released mid-January) and I think it would be to drastic of a shift following Happy's lack of success. If you're going to try to release something totally new, you have to have some type of momentum and that's clearly something that's not present at this time.\n\nFor me IGY is catchy, it connects and I think it's definitely more of a winter type of song. It's also got more of a driving force behind the song as opposed to Happy. If IGY does end up doing decent, following up with OMH in the spring/summer (around April or May) is going to give that song the best chance to do well and having two decent hits will definitely help the struggling/poor opening album sales.\n\nI do know a lot of people here want OMH because it's totally something different and new for Leona. The flip side of that is go look what happened with poor Jordin Sparks when she went out of the box. Didn't work out to her advantage at all and backfired big time.\n\nIn conclusion, bottom line for Leona is ANYTHING released at this point is risky and you just have to hope for the best with the choice. They're really put themselves in a big hole after Happy. Both OMH and IGY have their positives and negatives, but I do believe IGY was the way to go. Time will tell.\n\nPost by BrokenArrow on\n\nMy issues with releasing OMH right now mainly focus on the fact that it just doesn't fit or suit the time of year (more than likely this 2nd single will go be released mid-January) and I think it would be to drastic of a shift following Happy's lack of success.

Time will tell.\n\nIts a nice song, but if your not American, you have to come hard with an amazing song.\n\nLikewise, Taylor Swift can get away with run of the mill stuff in the US, she won't get played on UK radio unless she comes with a great song.\n\nPost by starr on\n\nLeona has to start recording more up-tempo songs for her albums. She's too comfortable with the ballads and mid-tempos.\n\nIf Leona wants to be an Adult Contemporary artist that will work. But if Leona wants to be a Pop star then she needs to record more up-tempos. Leona is becoming a Celine Dion type artist. Celine is an adult contemporary artist.\n\nWhen Leona was on \"The X Factor\" she was also very comfortable in doing just ballads. The only time she ever did an up-tempo on that show was when judge Louis Walsh wanted to see her do something different because he thought she was a one-trick pony not capable of doing up-tempos.\n\nAlso, Leona has to start working with other music producers. She needs to learn how to get comfortable with other producers. She relies on Ryan Tedder too much."
