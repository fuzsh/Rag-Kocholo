        "text": "Earlier this week, Leona Lewis announced she had signed a new record deal with Island, signifying her departure from Simon Cowell‚Äôs Syco label after a beautiful seven years together. Obviously, the Internet‚Äôs first reaction was to presume Cowell had dropped the former X Factor star ‚Äì but in fact, her contract was up and LeLew fancied a change of scenery.\n\n‚ÄúI feel honoured to be given the opportunity to sign to perhaps the most iconic label of all,‚Äù she said in a press release. ‚ÄúTo me, Island has always been a place where artists can really flourish and are encouraged to express themselves.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to start making music with my new team,‚Äù she finished.\n\nThis move to a new label is exactly what Leona‚Äôs career needs. Last year‚Äôs Christmas album did pretty well, but the one before that was a flop, and back in 2008, when she released Bleeding Love, Leona looked like a superstar in the making.\n\nWhat the hell should she do now though? I‚Äôve weighed up all the options so Leona can make the right move to get her career back on track.\n\n1. A ‚Äúclassical crossover‚Äù album.\n\nWhy she might do it:\n\nObviously, Leona Lewis has an amazing voice. This is undeniable, regardless of whether you like her music. She‚Äôs also no stranger to a classical crossover. On her recent festive album, she had a crack at Ave Maria, and has, in the past, sung with poperatic boyband Il Divo.\n\nShould she do it?\n\nFor some reason us Brits love this kind of thing ‚Äì why else would ITV have commissioned Popstar to Operastar? ‚Äì so it could be a lucrative move. However, an album featuring nothing but tasteful strings and impressive high notes might not break the myth that Leona Lewis is, well, a bit boring.\n\nVerdict: It‚Äôs a nope from me.\n\n2. An album of massive power ballads.\n\nWhy she might do it:\n\nLeona‚Äôs (proper) debut single, Bleeding Love, is a massive power ballad and one of the best songs of the noughties, hands down. Written by Ryan Tedder (who also penned Beyonc√©‚Äôs Halo and Jordin Sparks‚Äô Battlefield), this track propelled Leona to global stardom and became the best-selling single in the world in 2008.\n\nShould she do it?\n\nAn album of souped-up power ballads could definitely work for Leona ‚Äì she‚Äôd be able to show off her vocal prowess without the faff of dance routines, which aren‚Äôt really her thing. She‚Äôd have to be careful not to slip into midtempo balladzzz territory, though, so I‚Äôd suggest booking in some studio time with Tedder (again) and the incredible Sia. Imagine if Leona released something along the lines of Sia‚Äôs new single Chandelier. Imagine!\n\nVerdict: Just imagine!\n\n3. An album of BANGERZ.\n\nWhy she might do it:\n\nBack in 2011, Leona released a club banger called Collide, which after a tiny issue regarding copyright, ending up featuring dance DJ (and friend of Madge) Avicii. The track wasn‚Äôt a massive smash, but it did chart at number four on the UK‚Äôs Official Singles Chart, and proved that LeLew could hold her own on a house tune.\n\nShould she do it?\n\nA difficult one. So-called ‚ÄúEDM‚Äù is already sounding dated, so recording an album of Calvin Harris-aping club bangers might make Leona seem behind the curve. But what if Leona belted out some almost gospelly ‚Äô90s-style house tracks ‚Äì think CeCe Peniston, or even Sonique ‚Äì that could sound pretty special, right?\n\nVerdict: If done well, this could be absolutely amazing. Can she cover Pride (A Deeper Love) please.\n\n4. An album of ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù and ‚Äúreal‚Äù music.\n\nWhy she might do it:\n\nSince she won The X Factor, Leona‚Äôs fan-base has grown up, and so has she. And she was never entirely ‚Äúdown with the kids‚Äù anyway ‚Äì she loves her horses too much, tbh. So it wouldn‚Äôt be foolish for her to do an album of adult contemporary tracks penned by people like Gary Barlow ‚Äì the mum market would love it, and she‚Äôd be a shoo-in for a promo slot on Alan Titchmarsh‚Äôs daytime chatshow.\n\nShould she do it?\n\nThis album could do well for Leona. It might not reach the multi-million selling heights of her debut, Spirit, but if released in time for Mother‚Äôs Day, with the right single, it would probably make Number One and secure her another album. But then again, it wouldn‚Äôt help with the old ‚Äúboring‚Äù problem, would it?\n\nVerdict: This is the most likely to happen, which is kind of a shame, really.\n\n5. A duets album.\n\nWhy she might do it:\n\nPure commerce, babes. An album teaming Leona with the likes of Michael Bolton, Gary Barlow and Olly Murs (obviously) could potentially sell shedloads, especially at Christmas.\n\nShould she do it?\n\nNo, just no. It would be cheap, boring and kill any modicum of cool the Hackney belter is managing to cling onto in 2014.\n\nVerdict: LeLew, don‚Äôt do it üôÅ\n\nWhat do you think Leona should do next? Let us know in the comments section below."
