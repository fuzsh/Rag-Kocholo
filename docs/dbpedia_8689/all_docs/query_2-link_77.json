        "text": "Leona Lewis was one of the many well-deserved people who was made an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the New Year's honour list, honoured for services to music and charity.\n\nThe singer rose to fame when she won the third series of The X Factor in 2006. She went on to release hit after hit including Bleeding Love, Run and Better In Time. The 38-year-old is the first British female solo artist to reach the top five with eight singles, surpassing Olivia Newton-John's record of seven.\n\nShe won two MOBO Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award, and two World Music Awards. The musician was also nominated for six BRIT Awards and three Grammy Awards. The star sang I See You from James Cameron’s hit film Avatar in 2009, and in 2016 she made her Broadway debut replacing Nicole Scherzinger as Grizabella in the revival of Lord Lloyd-Webber’s musical Cats.\n\nNot only is she a widely celebrated artist, but she's also known for her support of many charitable causes. She's worked with The Prince’s Trust, Teenage Cancer Trust and WWF.\n\nLewis and her husband, German-born creative director Dennis Jauch, opened a coffee shop with sustainability at its heart in Los Angeles, planting a tree for every cup they sell having partnered with the National Forest Association.\n\nOther big names being honoured include Game of Thrones actress Emelia Clarke - who has been awarded an MBE for her work with charity SameYou, which she founded. It provides vital support for people with brain injuries.\n\nNational treasure Dame Shirley Bassey was awarded one of the most coveted Damehoods going, becoming just the 64th living member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.\n\nOther big names given the nod included Paul Hollywood, who got an MBE for services to baking and broadcasting, while Rishi Sunak's favourite author, Jilly Cooper, became a Dame. Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis is knighted for services to music and charity, while film director Sir Ridley Scott had his knighthood upgraded. DJ Tony Blackburn was awarded an OBE, and fellow DJ Steve Wright got an MBE. Game of Thrones star Oliver Ford Davies also got an OBE for services to drama. There was also an OBE for retail expert and Mary Queen of Shops TV star Mary Portas.\n\nThe government says the aim of the honours list is to credit people who \"made achievements in public life\", and \"committed themselves to serving and helping Britain\". It also adds that \"they'll usually have made life better for other people or be outstanding at what they do\"."
