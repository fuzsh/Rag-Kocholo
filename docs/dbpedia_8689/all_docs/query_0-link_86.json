TEF Gold institutions are those that achieve the highest rating and are considered to be consistently performing at an exceptionally high standard in the areas that matter most to students. A TEF Gold rating could be an important factor in a student choosing where they want to study, as it is a trusted mark of quality.\n\nPoint Blank also received 86% for Teaching, 91% for Freedom of Expression and 81% for support of our students' mental health and wellbeing in 2023's National Student Survey (NSS) results. Academic excellence, student voice, and inclusion are very important to us and we are overjoyed to be recognised and awarded these results from our students. We’ve been teaching the art of music production and related arts for almost 30 years. We offer a range of degrees*, diplomas, certificates and professional courses in various music industry-based disciplines including sound engineering, DJ performance, vocal performance, music business, songwriting, music software development and radio, audio and podcasting. All of our courses are taught by expert lecturers who currently work within the music industry, with small classes (16 max) focused on delivering plenty of 1-2-1 student / lecturer time.

We also run a wide range of professional diplomas, certificates and short courses across our schools in Los Angeles, Ibiza, China, Mumbai and online. Our courses cater for all music industry careers, so if you’re looking to become a music producer, sound/recording engineer, music software programmer, performing vocal artist, songwriter, DJ, artist manager, tour manager, booking agent, TV/film or game music composer, music arranger, label manager, A&R manager, radio producer/presenter or any other professional within the world of music, then Point Blank Music School is the place to be.\n\nIf you want access to the best lecturers, facilities and connections out there, then join Point Blank’s global community now and step inside the music industry...\n\n‘If you’re serious about your music, Point Blank is where you wanna be…' - Pete Tong MBE\n\n*Degrees are not delivered in the US.
