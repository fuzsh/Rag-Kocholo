        "text": "Over a decade may have passed, trends have changed, and The X Factor fails to capture audiences like it used to, but it's still a memory that remains fresh in many of our minds.\n\nThe iconic win broke the first of many records for Lewis. Amongst others, she became the first female winner of The X Factor and boasts the best-selling debut album by a female artist in the UK in the 21st Century. Ten Brit and Grammy Award nominations, and over 30 million global album sales later, her portfolio features some incredible achievements. When we meet in her PR’s chic headquarters in Mayfair, Lewis laughs and shakes her head in disbelief reflecting on that iconic night.\n\n“It's mad! In one breath it does feel like 15 years because I’ve done so much in that time, so much has happened and so much has changed, you know? But in another breath, it feels like yesterday. A lot of people would be surprised to hear it's been over a decade! When I'm back in the UK people still tell me that they voted for me on The X Factor, and it’s so crazy how it takes people back to that moment in time, and how vividly people remember that night.”\n\nSince stepping out from the comfort of Syco, Lewis has tested major record labels and imprints, most recently dipping into the waters of independent music, and for the last five years she has navigated life on her own terms. With the space and time to experiment with new ventures, she admits it's been tough with a small team, but ultimately the decision has led to some unique opportunities, unearthing a love of acting, performing in Cats on Broadway, and even featuring in The Oath, a TV series produced by 50 Cent.\n\n“I’ve done so many things that I never thought I would, that I probably wouldn't have had the time to do in a record deal. It's given me so much more time to explore a different side of myself.”\n\n“Right now, I'm working with Sony on my Christmas album, and it’s amazing that I have a lot of support, which I need for a record like this. As far as new music goes it's been really fun and I hoped to release some music this year, but with everything that’s happened it's been pushed back. I'm still working on those songs now, so there'll be an EP or an album out in the next year or so\", Lewis explains. \"Since everything stopped, I didn't feel like I’m chasing anything or feel any sense of urgency, so there's really not much pressure, but all that pressure comes from myself. I just need to stay true to what I wanted to do, which was to bring these songs to fruition. I can be that person who starts a thousand things and never gets round to finishing them, so I took this time during lockdown to finish off a lot of ideas as well, like a TV show concept, and an independent film I’d love to shoot at some point too.”\n\nReflecting on her Nine Songs selections, both the choices and our conversation are full of nostalgic time capsules for Lewis - the soulful R&B vocals of 90’s girl bands, first-dance wedding grooves in Sting’s Tuscan mansion, an operatic education, and the tragic death of Lady Diana. The songs span the breadth of her musical career, from bursting out with love ballads as a tiny tot, to classic hits that have remained a constant throughout her life. Our discussion turns to longevity in talent shows, and I ask her about The X Factor’s downfall in recent years.\n\n“I feel like with everything, you embrace it and then sometimes the audience craves something new. Or, the problem is you're trying to chase something that's already happened, but lightning doesn't strike twice. You’ve almost got to go away and re-think it, stop grasping onto something that's already happened and do something completely new, out-of-the-box fresh. It can be revitalised in a new way, but things run their course and nothing lasts forever - we don’t, nothing does.”\n\n“When I first auditioned there was more of a focus on people who seriously wanted to be recording artists, because the prize was a record deal. But I feel like people always crave talent shows, especially programmes like The X Factor, where you also get to know the person and a bit of their story. You really humanise the person. It exposes that we're all normal people, and yes, some of our situations are very different, but we're all going through different challenges and obstacles.”\n\nIf we could somehow zip back in some wonky time machine, there are so many achievements the singer/songwriter might want to revisit in her career. Maybe a trip to witness one of her many broken records, perhaps the release of debut album Spirit, or even one of her quieter moments? But ahead of her 15-year X Factor milestone, we revisit her mindset at the time. Of course it's no easy feat being thrown into stardom at any age, let alone in the minefield of your early-20s. Amongst the chaotic kaleidoscopic blur of lights, cameras, and being broadcast to millions of people across the country, she tells me it was all too easy to get wrapped up in the negatives.\n\nI wonder: if you could travel back in time, what one piece of advice would she give to 2006 Leona Lewis? \"I would say, just listen to your gut\", she admits. \"Go with that first instinct and don’t take it all so seriously! Just have fun, life goes so fast.\""
