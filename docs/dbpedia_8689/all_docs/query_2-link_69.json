        "text": "Leona Lewis, the British pop singer known for the song “Bleeding Love,” plays her final performances as Grizabella in the revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats October 9 at 1:30 PM and 7 PM at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nActress Mamie Parris, who also concludes her run October 9 in Lloyd Webber’s School of Rock at the Winter Garden, will succeed Lewis as the faded glamour cat beginning October 17.\n\nThe revival opened July 31.\n\nBased on Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the original Broadway production opened in 1982 at Broadway’s Winter Garden Theatre, where it ran for 7,485 performances and 18 years. The musical was originally produced on Broadway by Cameron Mackintosh, The Really Useful Company Limited, David Geffen and The Shubert Organization.\n\nThe creative team for the new Broadway production includes John Napier (scenic and costume design), Natasha Katz (lighting design) and Mick Potter (sound design), with additional choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, based on the original choreography by Gillian Lynne, and direction by Trevor Nunn.\n\nThis new production of Cats is licensed by The Really Useful Group. Nina Lannan serves as executive producer.\n\nRead: Diva Talk: 8 Grizabellas, Including Betty Buckley and Elaine Paige, Share Their “Memory”s\n\nVisit catsthemusical.com."
