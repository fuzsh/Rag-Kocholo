        "text": "Leona Lewis has criticised Simon Cowell’s record label and said she won’t be censoring any of her material now that she has signed Island Records.\n\nIn an online video, which you can view below, she claims she felt “taken advantage of” at Cowell’s Syco label and won’t be holding back when it comes to slamming her former colleagues on her new album.\n\nShe added: ”A lot of people were telling me how to be and how to act and what to say. No one is one-dimensional.\n\n”I’m going to say whatever it is I want to say. I’m not going to compromise myself any more. I’m not going to censor myself.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the lyrics on her new tracks also suggest her relationship with Cowell’s label was dysfunctional.\n\nThe song ‘I AM’ features the lyrics, I am breathing without you, I am somebody without you, I am free without you, I am stronger without you while on ‘Fire’ she refers to ”drowning in quicksand” singing, I’m set free. I begin to spread my wings. I’m happy and I’ve earned it.\n\nLast week the singer took to Instagram to share a clip of a new track.\n\nRecommended\n\nLeona Lewis won the third series of the X-Factor in 2006. In August 2014, she announced her split from Simon Cowell’s Syco label and a new deal with Universal’s Island Records.\n\nFollowing the exit, Lewis penned an open letter to her fans detailing the creative differences that led to her decision. She wrote: “At some points I felt extremely depressed and other times experienced amazing highs, but it got to a place where the downs were outweighing the ups. So I’m writing this letter for anyone who has ever felt the same way.”\n\n“After several years, I thought about leaving over and over again. I was terrified of walking away from a somewhat secure relationship, even though I knew that we were no longer right for each other and at times even bad for each other. However, I clung to the safety net I had grown so attached to,” she added.\n\n“One day everything changed. For my fifth album, I was asked to make a record that would not have been true to myself. By all means as an artist in this climate, I was thankful to even get the chance to make another record. But I cannot make music that does not speak to my soul, and as scary as it seemed, I could no longer compromise myself, and so I decided to leave.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMVMNGK_BRQ"
