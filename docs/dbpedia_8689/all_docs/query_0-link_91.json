        "text": "A Syracuse native is set to perform a stunt at the Olympics closing ceremony, according to multiple reports.\n\nTom Cruise will skydive to the famed Hollywood sign as part of the Aug. 11 handoff from Paris to Los Angeles for the upcoming 2028 Summer Olympics, TMZ sources said. The stunt was secretly shot in March, according to the celebrity news site.\n\nCruise will rappel down the top of Stade de France and land on the stadium field with the official Olympic flag, according to TMZ. Then the broadcast will show a previously recorded video of Cruise flying to L.A. with the flag and jumping out of a plane to the Hollywood sign.\n\nIt will be part of a “major Hollywood production” for next week’s closing ceremony, an insider told Deadline. The event will feature L.A. Mayor Karen Bass ultimately receiving the Olympic flag from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, but other details have been kept secret.\n\nCruise, who was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, N.Y., is an Oscar-nominated actor known for performing his own stunts in movies like “Mission: Impossible” and “Top Gun: Maverick.” He was been spotted in Paris cheering on Team USA athletes like Simone Biles during the Olympic Games.\n\n“It’s awesome,” Cruise told Reuters. “Great stories, great athletes. It’s incredible what they have to do, the sense of accomplishment.”\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter noted that Olympics closing ceremonies are typically a star-studded affair to build excitement for the next Olympics. In 2008, Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis performed Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” in Beijing on top of a fake bus headed to London. In 1984, the L.A. Games featured performances by Lionel Richie, The Beach Boys and “Star Wars” composer John Williams."
