        "text": "Leona Lewis has been left “heartbroken” and has revealed that “life will never be the same” following the death of a beloved family member.\n\nThe Bleeding Love singer, who recently shared a rare snap of her daughter Carmel, announced on Tuesday, 6 August that her pet dog Forrest had sadly died. In an emotional Instagram post, Leona, 39, shared a series of snaps of little Forrest as she paid tribute to her Chihuahua.\n\n“I don’t really know where to begin…I’m heartbroken. I had to say goodbye to my little Forrest, my best friend through so many phases of my life,” she wrote.\n\n“I had only just gotten to the point of being able to talk about the loss of Zion, my beautiful Doberman who passed away 2 years ago. It was only 2 weeks after the birth of Carmel so it was very difficult to process the pain of losing him at that point.”\n\nThe former X Factor contestant added that her two dogs were “the most precious gifts” and added that they even accompanied her to the studio as she worked on making music.\n\n“Forrest and Zion were two of the most precious gifts and I’m so grateful for each day I got to spend with them. My studio companions, my protectors from squirrels, my snuggle buddies, my baby boys.\n\n“Life will never be the same without you but I still feel you around me and I know you are with each other laying by a window in that little bit of sunlight you both loved so much,” she added.\n\n“Forever grateful I got to be your earth mama and thank you for opening up my heart with your love.”\n\nIn response to the moving message, Leona’s followers flocked the comments section with messages of condolence. “Oh Leona I’m so sorry. Soul furbabies are the greatest gift. Sending you so much love and a big hug. Be gentle with yourself xxx,” wrote one.\n\n“I’m sorry for your loss. It’s incredibly hard to say goodbye to our fur babies. They’re truly a part of our families,” another added. “I am so sorry. My heart goes out to you, they’re forever in your heart and never forgotten best friends and family,” a third commented.\n\nThe heartbreaking news comes after the A Moment Like This singer performed at the wedding of Taylor Ward and Riyad Mahrez as they tied the knot for the third time in a romantic three-day celebration in Lake Como.\n\nFor the wedding reception Leona sported a gorgeous embellished gown as she took to the stage and was joined by Taylor’s mum Dawn, who danced along to her performance."
