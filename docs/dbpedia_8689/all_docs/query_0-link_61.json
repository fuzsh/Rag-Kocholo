        "text": "Leona Lewis has reportedly been dropped by her new record label only one year after splitting from former mentor Simon Cowell's company, Syco.\n\nThe singer, who won the third series of the X-Factor in 2006, had formerly broken records with her powerful vocals.\n\nIn 2007 her hit, Bleeding Love, stayed at number one for seven weeks and, since releasing her debut album, Spirit, that same year she has brought out several other albums, including 2015's I Am.\n\nHowever, sources say her contract with Island Records, announced last year just hasn't worked. A source told The Sun: \"It simply didn't work out with Island. She made a great record and the label really championed her but something just didn't click.\"\n\nWith her legendary vocals though, we have no doubt it won't be long until she's snapped up again. Who knows, she might even return to Simon Cowell's management. He's made no secret of the fact that he has a \"soft spot\" for the singer and the \"door will always be open\"."
