        "text": "Lewis Capaldi has broken up with his girlfriend Ellie MacDowall after two years together, it has been reported.\n\nThe Scots singer began dating actress Ellie back in 2022 but according to reports, the pair had been spending more time apart due to work commitments.\n\nA source told The Sun that their split was a mutual decision and it was all down to distance making things difficult.\n\nThey said: \"Lewis and Ellie had some long conversations and decided it was best for them to end things. It was a mutual decision. They are still friends and have been talking, so all is not lost.\n\n\"Ellie is still based in Edinburgh and Lewis lives in London so it’s been hard for them to see each other.\"\n\nLewis and Ellie have mostly kept their two-year relationship private and the star is currently on a career break although last month he hinted that he could be making a comeback.\n\nThe Someone You Loved singer was spotted spending time in his home studio with fellow British musician Dan D'Lion, suggesting he may be dipping his toes back into the musical waters.\n\nLast June, after a poignant performance at Glastonbury where he had difficulty singing his tracks, saying he was \"annoyed with myself\", Lewis announced his intention to take a break to focus on \"getting my mental and physical health in order\".\n\nThis followed the roaring success of his second album 'Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent', which soared to the top of the charts.\n\nHe shared at the time: \"I want to make absolutely sure I'm 100 per cent before getting back out there again properly for more shows and doing what I love more than anything.\""
