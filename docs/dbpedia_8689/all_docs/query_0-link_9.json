        "text": "This article doesn't prove that she has no personality; it proves that she's really rude and that she is trying to SHOW personality, but she came across as a total prude(\"Little sh*ts\"??Is she kidding??).Anyway, her statements are not what bothers me; I just hardly ever read them.What bothers me is that she shows no personality or emotion in her voice.I don't care what she shows in her interviews, but I do care what she shows on stage.\n\nIt kind of baffles me how the same woman that said that has also stated that she is \"a whole lot of trouble\" on 'The Guardian'.It's also quite funny that the same woman who just said the word \"hoodrats\" is alleged to have recorded a trip-hop version of 'Trouble' and some soul-influenced songs.It just doesn't fit.Her whole career seems like pieces of a bunch of different puzzles.Not only does she have no personality, but she seems to have no artistic identity or specific musical direction either and that's what annoys me. (Source for the whole paragraph)\n\n(Btw, I don't 100% disagree with her opinion, but she expressed it SOOOOO passionately that it seems beyond fake and scripted)\n\n0\n\nGod help any 'Nice British Singers' they get torn to pieces it seems you'd rather see them either fail or commit suicide just to entertain you. Personally id rather see nicer people who are funny and then turn into a different person on stage which is what Leona does. Im not a massive fan and i didnt particularly like 'Spirit' bit had a soft spot for 'Echo'.\n\nI actually think that people think that she is controlled by some sort of puppet master are very funny! no human does that! especilly not someone who Syco are lucky too have.. IMO she could start being a complete bitch and syco would play along.. it makes it even nicer too see that it hasnt changed her!\n\n0\n\nEveryone has a personality, but Leona's is incredibly bland. It feels as she's been told to shake it up lately so she's trying her hardest to some out with something more colourful than usual.\n\nUltimately, whatever she comes out with to the press is irrelevant. She needs to show some colour and emotion on stage or in her music, and I don't see that happening.\n\n0"
