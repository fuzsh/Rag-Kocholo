Remedy Entertainment is a Finnish computer game developer founded in 1995 and based in Espoo, Finland. Aside from Alan Wake, the company is best known for its Max Payne series of video games.

History[]

In 1997, Remedy created a program called Final Reality, a 3D benchmark program. In November 1997, Remedy created a new company that would handle its 3D benchmark program called Futuremark. That program would turn into 3DMark, a popular 3D benchmark program that determines the performance of a video card with the latest graphics.

Before forming Remedy, four of the founding members were in the demoscene group Future Crew. Originally there was some industry speculation that Remedy was comprised entirely of Future Crew members, but this was dismissed by Joe Siegler of partner-company 3D Realms.

The Max Payne series of games are based on the character Max Payne and his living nightmare through New York City. Payne is a fugitive undercover cop who is framed for murder and hunted by the NYPD and the mob. The Max Payne series is best known for popularizing bullet time in a video game as well as being influenced by film noir. In 2002, Remedy sold all rights to Max Payne to Take-Two Interactive for US$10 million and 969,932 shares of stock.

The first Alan Wake game takes place at the fictional small town of Bright Falls in Washington state, where Alan Wake meets the evil forces of the Dark Presence and combats them to save his kidnapped wife Alice. He has to sacrifice himself and take her place in the Dark Place, and begins working on writing himself out. This sets the scene for Alan Wake's American Nightmare, where Wake has written himself into what most fans think is an episode of Night Springs in Arizona, where he combats his evil doppelganger, Mr. Scratch. The games were published by Microsoft Game Studios.

Their next project, known as Quantum Break, was originally to be released in 2015 on the Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. However, due to the technical issues, the game was delayed and finally released on April 5, 2016. The studio has recently begun development on a new title, Control, which was released on August 27, 2019 for PS4 and Xbox One. Control received two expansions: The first one, The Foundation, was released in march 26, 2020. The second one, AWE, was released in August 27, 2020. While the base came had easter eggs and elements from the Alan Wake franchise, AWE was the first full crossover between two of Remedy's titles.

On September 7, 2021, an open letter from Sam Lake was published on the fan-site 'The Sudden Stop', thanking the Alan Wake and Remedy communities for their support and revealing a remastered version of Alan Wake which was to be released on PS5/4, Xbox Series S/X, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Later, the game was widely revealed via a trailer on September 9 during PlayStation Showcase 2021, and launched on October 5.

On December 10 2021, Alan Wake 2 was officially revealed during The Game Awards 2021 and released October 2023.
