        "text": "Introduction: We are in an interesting time for the Lord’s People, both Jews and Christians, and for the Nations of the world. The world is addressing a Pandemic and must confront an uncertain future in terms of health and economics. God’s people face a certain future of Resurrection and the Kingdom to Come. There is anxiety and worry all around us and we need not partake of that. We can trust the Lord. We are His. And in that trust we can have peace and assurance that whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. We can continue in Hope because nothing of this world can separate us from the Love of God which is Messiah Yeshua, (Christ Jesus), our Lord. With that foundation, we face this present situation from an eternal perspective. We do not do this in some fatalistic manner. We must struggle in this life against problems of health and economics. But we do not worry or panic as others who have no hope.\n\nWe concluded a series just under a year ago, about “Chavurot and house churches”. The focus of that series was to begin to inform us and prepare us for circumstances and situations that would require us to maintain community as a congregation without being able to meet publically and fully. We are presently in a series on “Waiting for the Kingdom to Come”. These are certainly related and as we decided to move in the direction of limiting our gathering during the next three weeks in compliance with government and health agencies’ request for “Social Distancing”, I could not decide if I should adapt the present series or return to the Chavurot and House Church one. Actually this message would fit in both but since I do not see the present situation as a prophetic event, it seems that we should treat it as a more common human problem. So I have placed it in the chavurot and house church series.\n\nWhy do we need Chavurot and house Churches?\n\nAmerica is and has been a place where Jews and Christians can worship and practice their religion without fear or serious resistance. This is not to say that there has not been antisemitism and anti-Christian acts and actions but against the rest of the world, that has been a minor issue. But there are, at present, rumblings of anti-Semitism and anti-Christian sentiment that are pushing us to the margins of this secular society and which are a potential threat to our present manner of gathering as believers.\n\nThe DiscipleCenter was formed, in part, as a laboratory for using a new model of congregation. Not really a new model but a composite of aspects from the diaspora models of congregation from Judaism and Christianity that has survived the two greatest threats to our existence – Assimilation and Persecution.\n\nAssimilation for Judaism is the gradual loss of Jewish identity and covenant as Jews intermarry or secularize. It also can involve conversion to another religion. While they remain Jews in the ethnic sense, the assimilated Jew no longer expresses the light of Torah among the nations. In the same way, Christian assimilation is the gradual loss of Christian identity, worldview and values that mark a disciple of Jesus (Yeshua). The present rate of assimilation among American Christians and Jews is frightening and this is because discipleship has left the home and the congregation. And the Gospel is made to accommodate this secularization so that it will be relevant to the culture. This significantly alters the Gospel. We are losing the third generation. The DiscipleCenter as a private congregation attempts to focus our priority on the home and to use the congregation to reinforce that home priority so that our children’s children will be disciples of the Lord fully equipped in the knowledge and disciplines of the faith.\n\nPersecution of Jews and Christians certainly exists in other parts of the world but has not been a major concern for Jews and Christians in America until recently. We may find this is changing. Anti-Semitism is on the rise and this will spill over into anti-Christian acts as well. The Jews have been likened to “miner’s canaries”. Miners take canaries with them into the mines. If dangerous gasses enter the mine, the canary dies which warns the miner to flee. Persecution often begins with Jews but it seldom ends with Jews. We Christians who serve the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, through our Lord Jesus will not be exempt from the hatred of the anti-Semite. This will increase even more as our Judeo-Christianity is further influenced by Judaism in general and more specifically Messianic Judaism.\n\nThe DiscipleCenter is a private congregation that that somewhat insulates us from public view as we disciple our children and converts and as we walk carefully in an increasingly hostile secular society. This, in part, is why we must be prepared for the future by being able to operate without full gatherings and even perhaps without a facility. This involves regular meeting in our homes as the early Jewish and Gentile Yeshua disciples did.\n\nOther Reasons for Chavurot and House Churches\n\nHuman history is filled with natural disasters, wars, plagues, famines as well as economic disasters. These are a normal part of human history and we should not be surprised or unprepared when they happen. We cannot ever be fully prepared, and we must remember that we have a Father in heaven who knows our challenges and who is compassionate towards us in our need. But the way of this world is vanity and difficulties mount. There will be times, as we are seeing now, when disease and economic panic will overwhelm the places where we wait for the Lord to return. We also need to be ready in these times to protect our vulnerable – the poor, widows, children and the elderly -- and to cooperate as a community even though we may not be able to meet together fully. This next three weeks of “Social Distancing” in the face of this virus serves as a reminder and a real situation where our previous preparation can be tested and we can learn to be better prepared next time, for there will certainly be a next time.\n\nWe must be ready when earthquakes, terrorism, supply-panics and economic disasters take place. Chavurot and House Churches can allow local neighbors to work together and when technology is available, we can gather as a dynamic virtual community as we are doing today. But we must not depend on technology as it can also be controlled by others, disrupted and overwhelmed. This weekend, most synagogues and churches have either canceled or significantly curtailed their service. Many, like us, are experimenting with technology as an alternative way to do their regular services. But that is short-sighted. Even if the technology works today, there is no certainty that it will work next time. We need to be able to connect relationally in our homes and neighborhoods.\n\nFinally, there are local snags, like freeway construction, or gas shortages, weather conditions or other local issues that have and will arise, and we need to be prepared as households and as a congregation to weather those as well. We have done so in the past and that also prepares us for the future.\n\nThe Future We Wait For\n\nThe future we await is the return of the Lord. In His return, we anticipate the restoration of the Kingdom to Israel (Acts 1:6), and the nations saying to one another “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob”. Then the “Torah will go forth from Zion and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem”. And war shall cease (Isaiah 2:1-4). But the Lord has told us through the prophets and apostles, that the day of the Lord will be preceded by great darkness, deceit, apostasy and persecution. We must be prepared for that future.\n\n\"But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. \"Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory. \"And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven. \"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. \"Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the door. \"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. \"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.\n\n\"But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. \"Take heed, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come. \"It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert. \"Therefore, be on the alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning— in case he should come suddenly and find you asleep.\n\n\"What I say to you I say to all, 'Be on the alert!'\" Mark 13:24-37\n\nWe do not know when this will occur. But the Lord said to all to be alert and prepared. Not because it will happen in our lifetime, though it may. But, we prepare because it may happen in the lifetime of our children or their children. We must be prepared and we must prepare them and they must prepare the next generation. This faith is handed down from generation to generation. It is not invented new each generation, nor is it improved. It is more than passing down the scriptures but also the way of life that enables us to be doers of the word.\n\nAnd preparation is not getting supplies and plans. Those are necessary, but even without those the Blessed One who carried Israel through the wilderness can supply all our needs. We need experience with “practicing the presence of God” and “practicing the presence of the Body of Messiah”. That happens in Chavurot and in Households through relational connections.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the next three weeks, consider what your household can do. Can it be a chavurah or house church for the DC? Can it also be a place where guests from other congregations may find fellowship and hope? Can it be a place where an unbelieving friend or co-worker who is panicked or frustrated can find peace and the good news?\n\nWho in the DiscipleCenter needs to be connected, and to whom? How can we learn from this situation that will prepare us for the next?\n\nWe will always have the threat of assimilation and persecution as we wait for the Kingdom to Come. But we need not be unprepared. Let us consider the temporal preparations that we will need, but more importantly, let us consider the relational preparation that we will need. That is the household, the chavurah or house-church and the local congregation. And let us remember that the congregation is not the central place. The central place is the home and Chavurah (house-church). As the Lord said to all, “Be Alert”."
