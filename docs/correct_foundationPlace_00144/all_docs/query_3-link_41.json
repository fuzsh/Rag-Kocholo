        "text": "2010\n\nAfter a long delay in steel delivery, work on the new Jack’s Fresh Market grocery store just east of Pamida is moving along briskly, and even with this week’s return of cold and wind and snow, the construction is progressing well. Owner Jack Ziminski says they are currently on track for a targeted opening date of May 13. The 43,000-square-foot store – more than twice the size of the existing SuperValu on Maple Street – will feature spacious aisles and a long list of amenities, including a sit-down eating area and made-to-order sandwich bar, a beverage bar for coffee, espresso, hot chocolate and soda, and more.\n\nAnother organization has come forward to rescue the Folkfest celebration from oblivion. The 21st annual summer festival, which takes place this year on July 9 and 10, is now being headed by the Schoolcraft County Chamber of Commerce. The chamber’s involvement comes on the heels of last summer’s announcement that the core group of longtime Folkfest Committee members was retiring, leaving the festival’s future in doubt. In December, the Manistique Recreation Board said they were going to take over management of the event, but soon after that decision was announced, board members changed their minds, concerned about the amount of work involved, especially given the board’s busy summer schedule, which already includes the annual Central Park celebration and a full slate of youth recreation programs. With Folkfest’s future once again in limbo, the chamber board stepped in and agreed to take over the event.\n\nConstruction on Manistique’s water treatment plant upgrades is expected to get underway in September. A pilot study on using ozone to improve the treatment process is now underway and bids for other portions of the improvement project are expected to go out soon. During a brief City Council meeting Monday night, Water- Wastewater Supervisor Corey Barr provided an update on the project, which has been in the works for several years. The goal is to bring the city into compliance with tightening federal standards on the levels of haloacetic acids in municipal water supplies. The total cost of all the improvements is estimated at $5.2 million. Of that total, $2.5 million will be covered by a grant from USDA Rural Development, the balance by a low-interest USDA loan.\n\nFifteen years after it was first announced and nine years after construction began, a new Type II landfill is getting ready to open in Schoolcraft County. The Hiawatha Shores Landfill, owned and built by local businessman Stan Zellar, has received its license from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment. The facility will accept its first loads of garbage this month. The opening will mark a new era for Schoolcraft County, which has been without an operating landfill for the disposal of general municipal waste since 1992, when the state shut down the city-owed facility on M-94. Since that time, local garbage has been hauled to disposal sites in other parts of the Upper Peninsula, including Alger and Chippewa counties. The first official event of Manistique’s sesquicentennial summer takes place this Saturday at the Little Bear West Arena with a free ceremony and concert organizers describe as the city’s “150th birthday party.” The ceremony marks the first of five consecutive Saturday celebrations in Schoolcraft County. It will be followed by the sixth annual Pioneer Days hosted by the Schoolcraft County Historical Society on June 26, the area’s Independence Day festivities on July 3, the 21st annual Folkfest on July 9 and 10, and the city’s third annual Central Park celebration on July 17. All of those events will feature elements designed to highlight the sesquicentennial observance.\n\nThe Manistique Downtown Development Authority has taken another small step toward the possible construction of an RV park and camp-ground on the city waterfront. At their regular meeting Sept. 21, DDA board members approved a $3,000 contract with Escanaba-based Bittner Engineering to do a preliminary study and conceptual plan for the project. The DDA has been discussing the idea of a publicly-owned campground for the past several months, reviving a topic that has been on and off the local agenda several times over the years and at one point was included on a list of long-range city goals. The current proposal focuses on a campground large enough to contain 50-plus sites, situated along the river and harbor south of the marina. The area is located between the east-side fishing pier and the boardwalk parking lot at the foot of Range Street. A smaller portion of that same property was considered several years ago for a lakefront museum and interpretive center.\n\nThe federally-funded dredging of the main navigational channel in the Manistique River and Harbor is well underway this week. Now, city officials are scrambling to make sure they can get their portion of the project done at the same time. The $1,473,800 federal project is being funded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and carried out by Ryba Marine Construction of Cheboygan. The company is removing about 114,000 cubic yards of accumulated sand and sediment to take the navigational channel back down to a depth of 13 feet. The city project includes dredging about 5,000 cubic yards of material, taking the marina to a depth of seven feet and the “upper river basin” (the channel area just outside the docking site) to an eight-foot depth.\n\nThe Schoolcraft County Board of Commissioners made it official last week, voting 5-0 to proceed with plans for a new 56-bed county jail and place two millage issues on the Feb. 22 election ballot. The decision came at the board’s audit-finance committee meeting on Dec. 9. The county will ask local voters to approve a 20-year, $5.96 million bond issue, which will require an estimated first-year tax levy of .92 mills and an average levy of 1.21 mills over the life of the issue, which would run from 2011-2030. The second ballot question will seek an additional half-mill levy for the next 20 years to operate the facility. That millage would bring in approximately $161,250 in the first year.\n\n2011\n\nStep by step, the city of Manistique is moving closer to a major infrastructure project – a $10 million upgrade to the water and sewer delivery systems on both sides of town. At their regular meeting Monday night, City Council members approved the required notices of intent, a legal formality stating that the city will be issuing bonds to finance the work. Under discussion for the past two years, the project will see the replacement of nearly 3.3 miles of water main and 3.5 miles of sanitary sewer lines, the installation of nearly two miles of new storm sewer lines, plus improvements to manholes, catch basins and other structures. The water portion of the project is being paid for with a USDA Rural Development funding package that utilizes federal economic stimulus money. The package, approved by Rural Development last summer, includes a $3,064,000 low-interest loan and a $936,000 grant. The sewer work will be paid for with a second funding package that comes from normal Rural Development sources, not stimulus dollars. Approved in October, it includes a $1,494,000 grant and a $4,575,000 loan.\n\nMore than five years ago, when they first unveiled their plans for a new health care center west of Manistique, officials from Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital adopted the theme “Dare to Dream.” Today, that dream is closer than ever to becoming reality with the announcement that the project has received funding from USDA Rural Development. The Pioneer-Tribune learned late last week that SMH had been approved for a $19 million low-interest loan from the federal agency. That was confirmed this week by the office of U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, which was set to make the formal funding announcement on Thursday. Combined with a $3 million Rural Development loan received earlier to install water and sewer lines to the building site in Thompson Township and money the hospital has already spent on design work and property acquisition, the new loan package will complete the financing for the estimated $24 million project.\n\nTimothy R. Noble of Manistique has been appointed the new prosecuting attorney for Schoolcraft County. Noble will step into the position May 22. The appointment was made Monday by 11th Judicial Circuit Court Judge William Carmody, to fill the seat vacated when long-time County Prosecutor Peter Hollenbeck retired April 30 after nearly 29 years in office. Until Noble’s appointment takes effect, prosecutor duties are being handled on an interim basis by retired Mackinac County Prosecutor Prentiss Brown III. Noble is a recent graduate of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School and completed his undergraduate work at Western Michigan University. He worked with Hollenbeck while a law student and is currently working in the prosecutor’s office as a volunteer.\n\nControversy continues to swirl around the Garden Township Wind Energy Project, even as work continues on the project’s two electrical substations and the early stages of turbine construction. The debates, which have taken place up and down the Garden Peninsula for more than four years, reached a new high in recent weeks with the release of letters from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Heritage Sustainable Energy of Traverse City, the project developers, citing serious concerns about the impact of the wind turbines on migratory birds and bald eagles. Heritage, a company best known for the large Stoney Corners Wind Farm in downstate Missaukee County, first began investigating the Garden Peninsula as a potential wind-generation site in 2007. They began by conducting meteorological and environmental studies and entering into leases with area landowners, primarily farmers, for approximately 10,000 acres in Fairbanks and Garden townships. Late last year, Heritage signed a 20-year agreement with Consumers Energy of Jackson, Mich., to purchase the power produced on the peninsula. Initial construction began earlier this year, as the substations were built in Garden and on US-2 near Garden Corners – part of the infrastructure required to move electricity from the wind turbines to the grid. Construction on the first turbines began in early fall.\n\nIt’s been just over two months since production resumed at Manistique Papers Inc., and officials say things are going well as the mill continues its return to stability and financial good health – a process that will include an expected sale of the 91-year-old company by auction this winter. That’s good news for a company that filed for bankruptcy just four months ago, and narrowly escaped an attempt to liquidate the entire operation. The story began on Aug. 5, when MPI announced that they were halting production and seeking bankruptcy protection. Over the next several weeks, a plan was put together to prevent the mill’s lender, RBS Citizens NA, from converting the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to a Chapter 7 liquidation, which would have meant the dismantling and sale of the mill, equipment and real estate. That was averted Aug. 24, when a financial agreement was announced. The transaction, which involved Manistique-based mBank and the Michigan Strategic Fund of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, saw MPI’s existing loans and two unfunded letters of credit purchased from RBS, removing them from the picture and eliminating the immediate liquidation threat. The bank also committed to a $5 million debtor-in-possession line of credit, with 49 percent participation by the MEDC – funding intended to give MPI working capital to buy raw material and resume paper production as they worked their way through the bankruptcy process. With that money in place, laid-off employees were called back to work and the mill resumed operation on Sept. 19.\n\n2012\n\nAfter a brief closure and filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011, the former Manistique Papers, Inc. was purchased in April of this year. The nearly 100-year-old paper mill was purchased by the Watermill Group, a Boston-area private investment firm. In November 2009, Watermill purchased the FutureMark Paper Company in Alsip,\n\nIll., which was touted by the company as being the leading recycled coated paper producer in North America. In the months following the sale of MPI, the group changed the mill’s name to FutureMark – Manistique, a sister company to the mill in Illinois.\n\nFourteen wind turbines now stand visible on the Garden Peninsula – the result of a years-long project of Heritage Sustainable Energy. Despite opposition from some residents, the Garden Wind Farm now produces power sold to downstate-based Consumers Energy. The project was completed in September, with the 295-foot turbines spread over approximately 10,000 acres of land leased from Garden residents. Each turbine is capable of producing 2 megawatts, and is expected to produce over 70,000 megawatt hours of energy each year.\n\nTwo wildfires wreaked havoc over the summer, one of which burned over 21,000 acres in Luce County. Known as the Duck Lake Fire, the blaze lasted nearly three weeks and was the third largest wildfire in Michigan’s history. The Duck Lake Fire was believed to have been ignited by a lightning strike and was first detected on May 24. There were approximately 141 properties within the perimeter of the fire, 136 structures of which were lost, including: 49 homes/ cabins (including a store and a motel), 23 garages, 38 sheds/outbuildings, and 26 campers. A separate wildfire, the Pine Creek North fire, within the Seney National Wildlife Refuge boundaries, burned approximately 3,400 acres before it was contained. The fire, like the Duck Lake Fire, was believed to have been started by a combination of dry conditions and a lightning strike. The fire was first reported on May 21, and contained by the end of the month.\n\nThe historic East Breakwater Lighthouse became part of a “disposal” plan by the U.S. General Services Administration earlier this year. While the city of Manistique had the opportunity to acquire the property for free, by committing to site upgrades and improvements, the city council recently decided not to pursue the structure. When city council first learned of the possibility to acquire the light, they voted to spend approximately $2,500 to finance an engineering plan. Recently, Shook informed the city that approximately $266,000 would be needed to bring the lighthouse up to the standards put forth by the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. The city council decided during that same meeting to take a “wait and see” approach with the light, noting they were not in favor of committing to such a large amount of money. The light will now go to public auction unless another public entity comes forward to pursue it.\n\n*\n\nDespite some bumps in the road, residents saw the completion of a multi-million dollar infrastructure project this summer. The $8.6 million project upgraded water, sewer and storm sewer lines throughout the city, and was funded through a USDA Rural Development grant and city matches. The project took place over the summer on both the east and west sides of the city. Separate projects, including a Michigan Department of Transportation M-94 upgrade and a Safe Routes to School grant-funded sidewalk replacement on the east side, ran concurrently with the USDA project. The final portion of the project, paving, was completed in October. During the project the city and construction companies ran into multiple obstacle, including the need to blast instead of drill in areas on the east side, adding in the cost of sidewalks to portions of the west side, and installing temporary water lines on both sides of the city during the construction process. Following the completion of the project, city council members were informed that one block of Park Avenue would also have its water and sewer system upgraded, thanks to leftover. Park Avenue was originally included in the project, but cut due to funding restraints. The block will see its upgrade work completed in 2013.\n\n*\n\nA case that baffled many in the community came to a close earlier this year. In January, Nicholas Alexander Smith, 22, of Manistique was sentenced to 13 to 20 years in prison for the stabbing death of his brother in 2011. Smith was originally arrested in March 2011, after officers from Manistique Public Safety were called to the apartment he shared with his brother, 26-year-old Michael Peter Clement Smith. Upon arriving at the scene, officers discovered Michael dead from apparent stab wounds. Nicholas was arrested and charged with open murder, a charge that would have allowed a jury to consider either a first- or second-degree murder charge. On the same day he was set to go to trial in November, Smith changed his plea from not guilty to no contest for second-degree murder. Smith was given credit for 313 days already served in the Schoolcraft County Jail and was ordered to pay $198 in fines and costs. The Downtown Development Authority has been busy, and though the group has even more projects slated, its future remains uncertain.\n\nSeveral projects now rest in the hands of the Manistique City Council, which must determine whether or not to extend the life of the DDA. The DDA is currently approaching the close of its 30- year life span, set to end in 2018. The Group has been approved for a multi-million-dollar grant from the Michigan Waterways Commission for projects including: river and harbor dredging, upgrades to the west side boat launch, and various improvements to the marina. The money is to be received in phases, each funding one of the projects. Phase 1, river and harbor dredging was completed in 2010. In order to embark on Phase 2, new broadside docking along the river’s edge to accommodate larger vessels, a new harbor master building, fuel station, and vessel pump-out facility, the DDA must seek bonds to fund their match for the project – approximately half of $1.6 million. If bonds are obtained, the DDA will need to exist long enough to pay them off – resulting in the extension request. In October, city council members voted unanimously to allow the DDA to continue talks with its bonding attorney and for its members to come up with a proposal for council.\n\n*\n\nA story unique not only to the area, but to the state, came to light this summer, as officials from the Eva Burrell Animal Shelter revealed their new training program – located within the walls of the Alger Correctional Facility. According to Warden Catherine Bauman, who also serves on the shelter’s board, the idea to have prison inmates train shelter dogs was pitched during a board meeting, and took over a year to get up and running. She described it as the first type of program in the state at the prison’s higher security level – Level 4. She also noted the prison has now been split into Level 4 and Level 2 units, and all future dogs will be located in the Level 2 portion. The program has now been operational since late 2011, with two pre-screened and qualified prisoners assigned to each dog. Shelter volunteers hold various learning sessions with groups of prisoners and the entire cost of the program is covered by the animal shelter. The first three dogs of the program were trained within eight weeks and were immediately adopted. Future dogs of the program will first be deemed safe and ready to enter the community, and will then be placed on the shelter’s website for adoption. Dogs do not re-enter the shelter, which potentially eases the burden on the shelter volunteers.\n\n2013\n\nThe Yorktown made its way into Manistique last August, dazzling spectators as it drifted offshore near the marina. The ship, part of the Great Lakes Cruise Company fleet, made two stops to the area last year, and plans to visit four more times this year. The massive cruise ship anchored near the lighthouse and used two of its own boats to carry approximately 120 passengers into Manistique. Next year, the cruise ship will be able to dock in the marina, giving passengers more direct access to the downtown area. The visits are expected to boost tourism to the area.\n\nFinal payments were made to the vendors involved in the $8.2 million USDA Rural Development grant-funded infrastructure project this past summer after the completion of Park Avenue. Elmer’s Crane and Dozer, Inc., of Traverse City, handled construction on the east side of town, while Hebert Construction Company, of Iron River, tackled the west side. The project, the bulk of which was completed over the summer and fall of 2012, included water, sewer and storm sewer line upgrades in various locations on both sides of the city.\n\nFutureMark – Manistique celebrated its anniversary in May, boasting 24 new hires, new maintenance programs and new production equipment, with plans for additional capital investment, just one year after Future- Mark Paper Group purchased the mill. As a result of the improvements made, the FutureMark – Manistique facility has added 60 new customers over the course of the year, and reached a 5-year high in total tonnage of recycled paper manufactured per day.\n\nAfter a long battle, the DDA won permission from the Manistique City Council to amend its original TIF plan. The organization sought the amendment after learning in 2012 that it had been approved for a Michigan Department of Natural Resources Waterways Commission, which will cover 50 percent of an approximately $4.2 million marina renovation project. The ongoing project includes: construction of new broadside docking, replacing binwalls, constructing new floating piers, installing pumpout stations and a fuel station, constructing a new harbormaster’s house and public restrooms, constructing parking lot improvements and installing playground equipment. In light of the amount the DDA would need to pay its match, the authority sought to amend the original 1988 TIF plan. Along with a list of new goals and projects of the DDA, the amendment to the TIF plan also included an extension of the authority, which was set to expire in 2018. The extension will allow for financing the grant match over the course of approximately 20 years.\n\nThe Manistique River was designated as an Area of Concern by the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1980s, following tests that showed contamination from wastewater treatment issues, as well as the presence of PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyl). The PCBs were the result of a past process performed by Manistique Papers, Inc, now FutureMark – Manistique, which used solvents to ‘deink’ paper. These solvents leeched PCBs into a lagoon on their property, and, eventually, into the river. While the mill has since walled and filled in the lagoon, preventing any further leeching into the river, PCBs remain in the sediment of the river – continuing its AOC designation. This past summer, representatives EPA, Department of Environmental Quality, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Geologic Survey, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers visited the area to conduct testing to design a remediation plan. The project, slated for fall 2014, could run anywhere from $10-20 million, with funds coming from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. No matching funds are required from either the city or the county.\n\nManistique was announced as one of six inaugural winners of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Roadmaps to Health Prize. As part of the honor, Manistique received a cash prize of $25,000 in recognition of its efforts during a Feb. 20 event held at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J. The city of Manistique was recognized for its innovative strategies to improve health, including: partnering with the Sault Tribe Strategic Alliance for Health Project, developing the Manistique Farmers’ Market, working to create easier access for non-motorized modes of transportation, and partnering with Manistique Area Schools to create access to healthy choices throughout the school day.\n\nThe East Breakwater light was originally tagged for “disposal” by the GSA in mid-2012 and listed on its Real Property Utilization and Disposal website. Under the stipulations of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000, those eligible to obtain ownership of the light, without any up-front cost, included the city, which officially turned down the opportunity in November 2012. In July, Newbury, Ohio resident Bill Collins placed the winning bid on the lighthouse and became its new owner. Collins came forward to reveal his identity shortly after in an attempt to ease concerns from residents about any alterations to the light. He did make one change to the light, however. In September the structure received a fresh coat of paint.\n\n*\n\nAfter years in development and construction, the new Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital opened its doors in April. The state-of-the-art facility on U.S. 2 replaces the original hospital, built in 1950 on Main Street in Manistique. On August, 19 2011, hospital officials hosted a ground-breaking ceremony at the site of the approximately $24 million facility. The 62,130 square-foot hospital was funded through a combination of a $19 million USDA Rural Development loan, approximately $3 million in bank loans, and $2 million of the hospital’s own funds. Featuring\n\n12 private inpatient rooms; a large, multi-room emergency department; energy-efficient design; and two state-of-the-art operating suites, the new hospital was officially opened to the public on April 22, 2013.\n\n*\n\nIn July, the administration of SCMCF approached the\n\nSchoolcraft County Board of Commissioners, seeking assistance for what was soon deemed a “grave” financial situation. The then-administrator, Jerry Hubbard, explained the facility had run into trouble with expenditures consistently higher than revenues. He also pointed out that the facility had a declining census, and having a problem obtaining reimbursements for Medicaid and Medicare bills While exact figures about the extent of the facility’s financial situation fluctuated, the county’s finance committee estimated the facility was losing approximately $50,000-75,000 per month. Following the resignation of Hubbard and the exit of several other administrative employees, a report from an outside financial consultant revealed Hubbard had known about the seriousness of the facility’s situation, but failed to reveal this to the SCMCF board and even took steps to keep certain areas of the facility’s finances from its members. After an increase in the facility’s census, and pay cuts to the staff, the facility was able to survive without financial assistance from the county board, but still sought and obtained a up to 1.5 mils from county residents in the November election.\n\n2014\n\nTension and uncertainty was high heading into the November 2013 election, but Schoolcraft County voters overwhelmingly approved two millages from Schoolcraft County Medical Care Facility and the Schoolcraft County Public Transit. For the medical care facility, a millage request of up to 1.5 mills for operations was approved 1,575 “yes” votes to 545 “no” votes. A total of 2,120 votes were cast. On the other side of the aisle, voters also approved the SCPT proposal with 1,431 in favor of the .587 mill request, which will support operations and expanded hours. Residents cast 684 “no” votes.\n\nResidents in Schoolcraft County’s Inwood Township became embroiled in a wind energy controversy early in 2014, when plans for a potential wind farm were revealed. Before long, Heritage Sustainable Energy, out of downstate Traverse City, confirmed the rumors about their long-term plan to establish a farm similar to one they own in Garden, Mich. In March, the Schoolcraft County Planning Commission passed amendments to sections 102 and 508 of the Schoolcraft County Zoning Ordinance. To date, Heritage has leased approximately 4,000 acres of land in Inwood Township. In October, county commissioners took a step back, adopting a one-year moratorium on all wind development in the area. Commissioner LaFoille stated at the time that the amended wind ordinance had been sent to the county’s attorney at Foster, Swift, Collins, and Smith PC, located in Lansing, for review. On Dec. 18, Heritage filed a lawsuit against the county alleging their property rights had been taken away by the amended ordinance. The company is seeking compensation in excess of $25,000.\n\n*\n\nWhat had begun as just another November election ended quite extraordinarily in December, with one vote breaking a tie and nullifying a tie-breaker. The race for the District 3 Schoolcraft County Commission seat had been up in the air for just over one month. After polls closed for the Nov. 6, General Election, voting machines indicated the District 3 race had ended in a tie – with 351 votes being cast for both Democratic candidate Gary L. Demers and Republican candidate Larry F. Mersnick. Using direction from the Election Officials’ Manual, produced by the Michigan Bureau of Elections, Schoolcraft County Clerk Beth Edwards announced a drawing would be used to break the tie. During the tie-breaker, Demers pulled the word “elected” from a hat; Mersnick, unluckily, pulled the word “not-elected”. Following the drawing, Mersnick announced he would seek a recount of ballots. Prior to the drawing, no winner had been established, so no defeated candidate could make the recount request. Five weeks later, on Dec. 11, Mersnick, Demers, their representatives, the Schoolcraft County Board of Canvassers and others gathered for the recount. The canvassers spent more than three hours counting and re-counting ballots, eventually discovering a voting machine had failed to count one lightly colored vote in favor of Mersnick. The vote put Mersnick at 352 total votes – Demers stayed at 351. Mersnick will officially take a seat on the county commission in January.\n\nA $1.7 million marina project was completed in March, including a harbormaster building that was ready to welcome boaters, visitors, and residents. The project was part of the Manistique Downtown Development Authority’s threephase, approximately $4.2 million renovation of the marina. The harbormaster phase of the project included dredging; removal of existing structures, excavated material, sidewalks, and drainage and sewer pipes; site work such as site grading, sidewalks and signage; the replacement of the fueling system; broadside docking; installation of water main and sewer main; and the construction of the harbormaster building, flag pole, radio tower, and landscape. The harbormaster building includes restrooms and showers for those who purchase a slip in the marina, public restrooms, the harbor master’s office, and a public information area.\n\nIt was the end of an era in June, when the majority of the old Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital was demolished. The hospital was no longer needed, as a new facility was constructed and opened just outside of town in 2013. The SMH Board of Trustees voted in 2013 to demolish the old hospital using funds from USDA Rural Development. The project consisted of the demolition of the actual hospital portion of the building, leaving behind the Rural Health Clinic and the Schoolcraft County Medical Care Facility. Both had previously been connected to the hospital. The demolition lasted nearly 60 days – leaving what will be a grassy area in the place of what served as the county’s hospital for more than 50 years.\n\nWith plenty of public comment both for and against the change, Manistique City Council approved in July a “road diet” for the stretch of U.S. Highway 2 running alongside the city. Following the approval, the Michigan Department of Transportation effectively trimmed the five-lane highway down to three lanes. Originally consisting of four driving lanes and one center turn lane, the stretch of highway beginning near the Manistique State Police Post and ending at Chippewa Ave. was cut down to two driving lanes, one center turn lane and various right turn lanes to businesses and roadways. According to City Manager Sheila Aldrich, the city had been communicating with MDOT for years about pedestrian and biker safety issues before and after the Manistique River Bridge on U.S. 2.\n\nIn the early months of 2014, the entire Upper Peninsula, including Schoolcraft County, was in the midst of a propane shortage. Numerous residents faced significant price increases for the fuel, which is used as a heat source for many homes. A broken pipeline, increased demand; winter weather setting in sooner and more severely than anticipated; a rail closure in Canada; and difficult driving conditions were all factors in the shortage. The shortage eventually sparked a declaration of an “energy emergency” from Gov. Rick Snyder, which lasted until March 1. On average, propane prices were $2.40 above the 2012-13 winter rates. During the shortage, a statewide effort led to many agencies offering heating assistance to those unable to afford to fill their propane tanks. In fall of 2014, residents were advised to fill tanks earlier and at lower rates to avoid any situations similar to the previous winter.\n\n2015\n\nThe top story of the year is one that weighed heavily on the area. The murder of three area residents, Jody Hutchinson, 42, and sisters Carrie Nelson, 31, and Heather Aldrich, 25, occurred in April. Though three suspects were initially arrested and charged with the murders, one, Marietta Carlson, 28, died in June while awaiting her preliminary hearing. Following Carlson’s death, Garry J.C. Cordell, 47, admitted to murdering the three victims and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November. Kenneth Brunke, 46, pleaded guilty to two lesser charges – with a combined penalty of up to nine years in prison, in October. He is scheduled to be sentenced in January.\n\n*\n\nIn March, Manistique’s iconic paper mill closed its doors – leaving 147 area workers without employment. At the time, the mill’s owners, the Watermill Group, said it could not “return to profitability and consistently achieve positive financial results” after acquiring the mill in 2012. The mill had been owned by Remark Paper Company, Inc., but the company filed bankruptcy on the mill in 2011. This year’s loss of one of the area’s largest employers remains evident in Schoolcraft County’s unemployment rate, which was the highest in the state in October. 3. A renewal of hope was welcomed by area residents in November, when local company Zellar Excavating and Sons, Inc. purchased the vacated paper mill. The former FutureMark – Manistique mill had been sitting empty since March, with 147 workers left to find employment elsewhere. Following the purchase, Zellar Excavating and Sons, Inc., which also owns the former Camp Manistique prison, Zellar Sanitation, and Hiawatha Shores Recycling and Disposal, last said they plan to lease the former mill to a company which specializes in the paper industry.\n\n*\n\nThe prospect of wind energy systems within Schoolcraft County continued to capture the attention of area residents in 2015. The debate over whether wind turbines should be allowed within the county culminated in January, when news broke that Heritage Sustainable Energy LLC and Heritage Wind Leasing LLC, both of Traverse City, Mich., were suing Schoolcraft County. The court filing alleged that the county commissioners had taken away the plaintiffs’ personal property rights by adopting restrictive amendments to its zoning ordinance. In November, commissioners extended a one-year moratorium on the development of any wind energy systems while it works to update its ordinance. Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court Judge William W. Carmody was recently briefed by both attorneys in the lawsuit, but no other progress in the case has been made.\n\n*\n\nThe city of Manistique spent much of its summer tackling blight to improve the appearance of the area. In July, the city received an approximately $201,000 grant from the Blight Elimination Program of the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. With an additional $10,000 committed by the city and another $10,000 pledged from a private citizen, the city council had approximately $221,000 to demolish 12 blighted structures. After facing a higher than expected asbestos abatement cost, the Manistique City Council voted in October to provide another $35,398 to get the project completed.\n\n*\n\nA controversial Public Peace and Good Order ordinance that caused a stir in 2014 was updated this year. In June, Manistique City Council approved updates to section No. 207 of the 1984 regulations, which included outdated “offenses” such as one that stipulated residents may not appear in a public place “in clothes not belonging to his or her sex with the intent to conceal his or her sex.” The more modern ordinance was based on that of the city of Petoskey and included no references to one dressing outside of their sex.\n\n*\n\nA controversy based on a yearsold section of the Schoolcraft County Ordinance surfaced as the year came to a close. During a recent meeting of the Schoolcraft County Board of Commissioners, the audience was flooded with concerned residents – the majority of which were voicing opposition to Section 501, titled “Renting and Leasing”. The ordinance prohibits the rental of a home, cabin, or cottage for any purpose, for a period of less than 30 days. The county’s interim building codes administrator recently announced that Section 501 would be enforced after years of the regulation going unacknowledged.\n\n2016\n\nAfter more than a year of sitting vacant in the background, Manistique’s iconic paper mill was up and running by June. The paper mill was purchased in October 2015 by Zellar MPI Real Estate, Inc. By April 2016, UP Paper, LLC had agreed to lease and operate out of the facility, bringing it back to life. The facility was converted to allow for the production of lightweight recycled Kraft papers. In the past, the mill had produced printing and writing grades of paper. Currently, UP Papers, LLC employs approximately 75 employees, but expects to increase employees and productions by mid-2017.\n\n*\n\nIn February, Kenneth Brunke, 46, was sentenced to serve 40- 60 months in prison on one charge of obstruction of justice and 32-48 months in prison on one charge of lying to a peace officer. Brunke was the co-defendant in a 2015 triple homicide case. The sentences are being served concurrently and Brunke was given credit for 299 days served in the Schoolcraft County Jail. As part of his guilty plea agreement to the two charges, 12 other charges originally brought against Brunke in the homicide case were dropped. However, following his sentencing, Brunke was charged with two counts of controlled substance, deliver/manufacture, less than 50 grams, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $25,000; one count of controlled substance – deliver/ manufacture, 450 to 1,000 grams, a felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison and/or an up to $500,000 fine; and one count of conspiracy to commit controlled substance – deliver/ manufacture, 50 to 449 grams, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison and/ or an up to $10,000 fine. He is scheduled to appear for a pretrial on April 17.\n\n*\n\nThe issue of short-term rentals was prevalent in 2016. In late\n\nJanuary, Section 6.21, along with the rest of the newly revised Schoolcraft County Ordinance was approved. The section states:\n\nThe renting or leasing of a home, cabin, or cottage for any purpose, for a period less than 30 days (such as by the day or by the week) shall be considered a commercial use and permitted by right or by conditional use permit only in districts where this use is specifically listed. Renting ‘by the month’ is permitted in all zoning districts without conditional use approval.” Following the outcry of numerous Schoolcraft County residents, claiming the strict regulation of short term rentals hurts the local economy, amendments to Section 6.21 were made in late May. In these amendments, the board proposed adding short term rentals to the list of conditional uses in four of the county’s zoning districts, including: Residential 1 District, Residential 2 District, Lakeshore and River 1 District, and Lakeshore and River 2 District. As an added conditional commercial use, short term renting under 6.21 is subject to the certain requirements prior to approval, including the submission of an application and fee, as well as periodic inspections.\n\nA vacation for one family visiting the area ended in tragedy in late-July. A father and his two sons were rescued from the waters of Lake Michigan July 28. Manistique Public Safety Department officers and EMS responded to a call at Range Street and U.S. Highway 2, where it was reported that a 10-year-old was having difficulty getting to shore while swimming in Lake Michigan. Upon arrival, officers were advised that there were three victims in the water. Witnesses stated that two young boys had been swimming when they began having difficulty in the high waves. The father of the boys had gone into the water to help his children. All the victims were retrieved from the water by officers and EMS personnel. The boys did not need any treatment, but the 53-year-old father was transported to Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital and subsequently air lifted to U.P. Health System Marquette, then to a hospital downstate before eventually passing away.\n\nA new Manistique city campground will open in the summer of 2017. Earlier this year, the city and Manistique Downtown Development Authority pursued and received an approximately $235,000 grant from the Great Lakes Fishery Trust. The city was first awarded a DNR Trust Fund grant in 2013 for the campground parcel, which consists of 23 acres of land located along Trader’s Point Drive, on the corner of U.S. 2. When completed, the project is expected to include a campground, public beach, kayak launch, pavilion restroom, and fishing access. The public access point will be to the left of the property and will include a beach and fishing stations, as well as restrooms and parking. The GLFT grant will cover the cost of developing the public portion of the project. Work for the project commenced in late summer 2016.\n\nFresh in the minds of residents is the recent M-94 infrastructure and re-paving project. The M-94 project included roadway reconstruction, sanitary and storm sewer replacement, water main replacement, concrete curb and gutter installation, new sidewalks, and drainage improvements. The streets receiving updates included: Chippewa Avenue, and Deer, Elk, and Maple streets. MDOT had initially planned to only repave the stretch of highway, but the city requested working with the department to also tackle their infrastructure, which needs to be updated in order to meet a Department of Environmental Quality Combined Sewer Overflow closure deadline of 2019. This deadline was set in 1988 and requires the city to have all of its sanitary and storm lines separated. In 2013, the city completed an approximately $8 million infrastructure project on the east and west side of Manistique. The paving portion of the M-94 project was funded by MDOT. The remainder of the project was paid for with USDA RD funds, including an approximately $1.6 million grant and $464,000 loan for the water portion, and an approximately $1 million grant and $745,000 loan for the sewer portion. The project wrapped up in early November. Permanent paving markings and other finishing touches will be completed in spring.\n\nThe future of the Schoolcraft County Chamber of Commerce was a much-discussed topic toward the end of 2016. The chamber’s board of directors voted in August to terminate former chamber executive director Connie Diller. The termination, resignation of multiple board members, and other factors, including mismanagement and a steadily declining membership led to a recent vote by chamber members to dissolve the SCCC and possibly create a new organization. The new organization will likely be a combination of the chamber, Schoolcraft County Economic Development Corporation, and the Manistique Merchants Association – after each dissolves. In the meantime, the chamber has three new board members, and has been steadily working to correct its financial and membership issues in order to work toward the merger, which may be final as soon as April.\n\nThe Schoolcraft County Public Transit transformed into the Schoolcraft County Transit Authority Oct. 1. The Authority now operates autonomously from the Schoolcraft County Board of Commissioners. The SCPT currently employs approximately 18 employees who drive seven busses and four vans. The agency provides around 60,000 rides a year to the people visiting or living in Schoolcraft County. Other Upper Peninsula counties operating transit authorities include Alger, Delta, and Marquette. Luce and Chippewa counties operate the Eastern Upper Peninsula Transit Authority. 2017\n\n2017\n\nOn June 13, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan issued a Judgement of Acquittal in the United States of America’s case against a Roy P. Hinkson. The case stemmed back to Nov. 15, 2014 when the U.S. Forest Service charged Hinkson with constructing a camp on National Forest System land without obtaining the necessary authorization – in violation of 36 C.F.R. 261.10(a).1. The court stated: “This case involves an individual being charged with a crime for inheriting a permanent structure that was mistakenly built – at the direction of the US Forest Service officers – on National Forest System land by a different person nearly 40 years ago.” The court found that the government had not proven beyond reasonable doubt that Hinkson violated 36 C.F.R. 261.10(a).\n\nIn June, the hospital announced it would expand its current facility and expects construction on the project to get underway by early next year. The new hospital opened in 2013, and staff additions over time has led to the need for a 12,000 square-foot addition. The project will accommodate the staff and expand the Rural Health Clinic.\n\nHeritage Sustainable Energy’s 14 turbines from Phase I have been dotting approximately 10,000 acres of leased land throughout the Garden Peninsula since becoming fully operational in 2012. In May 2017, the company put into operation the first utilityscale solar energy installation in the Upper Peninsula. The facility utilizes 3,670 photovoltaic solar panels and 31 string inverters. In early September, Heritage sent a letter to landowners informing them that the company would be moving forward with Phase II of the Garden Wind Farm Project. The company is currently working with Delta County officials and Garden residents to determine the number and placement of the turbines.\n\nIn January, members of local law enforcement and emergency medical services were honored for recent lifesaving efforts. During the award presentation at Manistique City Hall, Manistique Public Safety Director Ken Golat said members of his department, Manistique EMS, the Sault Tribe Police, and the Schoolcraft County Sheriff’s Department had gone above and beyond the call of duty to save the lives of those in danger in both 2011 and 2016. Both incidents involved swimmers who encountered dangerous swimming conditions off the shore of Lake Michigan. Those awarded for their lifesaving efforts in this incident included: Manistique Public Safety Sgt. Charles Willour, Officer Kevin Smith, and Officer Eric Dombrowski; Manistique EMS Paramedic/ Firefighter Kyle Levin; Schoolcraft County Sheriff’s Department Deputy Charity Potier and Deputy Paul Furman (now sheriff); and Sault Tribe Police Officer Matthew Hunkele.\n\nIn May, Kenneth Brunke, who was serving prison time for his role in a 2015 triple homicide, was sentenced for the long-term drug dealing which the county’s prosecutor says played a significant role in the demise of three people. Judge William W. Carmody ordered Brunke to serve 225 months to 360 months in prison for the first two counts, and 752 days for the third count. He was also ordered to pay more than $500,000 in court fines and costs. Brunke has been serving an up to five-year prison sentence in the Michigan Department of Corrections Alger Correctional Facility after pleading guilty to one count of obstruction of justice and one count of lying to a peace officer in connection with the April 2015 triple homicide. The plea bargain in this case was offered in exchange for his testimony against the other suspect in the murder case – Garry Cordell. Cordell is currently serving three life sentences in the MDOC Michigan Reformatory near Ionia, Mich. The third suspect in the case died while awaiting trial.\n\n*\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation announced in April that there would soon be increased speed limits in the Upper Peninsula due to the passage of Public Act 445. The Michigan Department of Transportation and Michigan State Police identified 900 miles of non-freeway state highways for speed limit increases to 65 mph, including the stretch of U.S. 2 from St. Ignace to Rapid River. Public Act 445, passed by the Legislature in late 2016, tasked the two agencies with increasing speed limits on some state highways and freeways based on 85th-percentile speeds (the speed at or below which 85 percent of traffic is moving) and the results of engineering and safety studies. Shortly after the new 65 mile per hour speed limit was implemented on the area’s stretch of U.S. 2, residents and officials began to express concern. In response to the complaints, MDOT re-signed the west portion of U.S. 2, just outside of Manistique city limits, to 55 mph. The speed does not again increase to 65 mph until after passing Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital. There remain calls to reduce the speed limit in other areas of concern, such as the town of Gulliver.\n\nIn July, the Michigan State Police – Negaunee Post announced that they were searching for an area woman who had gone missing with a Delta County man. However, evidence soon pointed to the missing persons case being that of a kidnapping. On July 9, Eric Scott Ruska had lured in his victim, a co-worker, under the guise of a fishing trip on Chicago Lake in Delta County. While on the boat, investigators say Ruska announced his intention to kidnap the victim and then traveled to locations throughout the central and eastern Upper Peninsula with the victim restrained. On July 13, Ruska and the victim were located at the Shell Gas Station in the city of Munising. Ruska was then taken into custody and charged in the United States District Court. In November, he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and three counts of aggravated sexual abuse. The felonies are punishable by up to life in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced in February 2018.\n\nThe end of June brought with it the grand opening of the Manistique Lakeshore Campground. The campground, which cost approximately $2.5 million to develop, includes 60 sites with water, sewer, electric, and Wi-Fi, as well as primitive camp site offerings. The public portion of the project includes a day-use pavilion, boardwalks, and public access to the west breakwall and fishing stations, via a boardwalk, as well as to the beach. Additions to the campground will likely include walking paths so campers may easily access the Manistique River Bridge and the businesses directly across from the campground on U.S. Highway 2 and adjustments to the tent campsites. By the end of summer, a new sign for the campground had been installed near the highway to direct visitors. The campground closed for the year Nov. 1 and in its first season, it was not only rated highly by the Good Sam RV Club, but also listed on CampgroundViews.com, where potential guests can virtually tour the campground, see detailed photos, read about the facilities, and write reviews. Manistique Lakeshore Campground will open again in May 2018. Those interested in learning more about the campground or making reservations may visit manistiquelakeshorecampground.org/.\n\n2018\n\nA grant from the Svelata Foundation, as well as one from Central Upper Peninsula Planning and Development, funded Manistique’s first mural on Oak Street. With the assistance of Mia Tavonatti, designer and lead artist of the Power of Words Project mural, visiting and local artists spent a month completing the work of art, which was revealed Aug. 6. Prominent features of the mural include: a depiction of the Manistique East Breakwater Lighthouse, Kitch-iti-kipi, Seney National Wildlife Refuge, the Lake Michigan shoreline, the Manistique boardwalk, the historic Manistique water tower, the Manistique River, and the all-encompassing rings, which represent tree rings – a nod to Manistique’s logging history. Local artists included: Casey Hinkson, Carrie Lambert, Ryan Gilroy, and Sara Bagley. Student scholarship artists were: Georgia Johnson, Ava Curran, and Lila MacKinnon.\n\nThe Manistique Recreation Department and the Schoolcraft County Veterans Affairs Board brought the Vietnam Moving Memorial Wall to Manistique Aug. 2-6. The wall, a half-size replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., has been touring the country for 34 years, commemorating those killed in or missing as the result of the Vietnam War. The wall was available for viewing 24 hours per day in the Manistique Marina.\n\nIn January 2018, the city of Manistique Recreation Department was awarded a $150,000 grant to help fund the creation of the Blanchard Paul Bunyan Park. The park, which will be located adjacent to the Habitat for Humanity – Hiawathaland building and Restore, will likely include a pavilion, skate park, volleyball court, access paths, and site amenities. The park currently boasts swings, merrygo rounds, a t-ball field, and benches that will remain. All other playground equipment will be removed. The city’s once-famed Paul Bunyan statue is a planned feature of the park, but was not approved as part of the grant. The reinstatement of this iconic statue, constructed in 1960 and destroyed by high winds in 1975, is reliant on private fundraising.\n\nGood Neighbor Services, which offers a variety of services locally, received a donation allowing them to move to a larger location in March. The organization had outgrown its location adjacent to the Habitat for Humanity Restore. An area philanthropist donated $100,000 to assist in purchasing the former grocery store on Deer Street – just down the road from their current location. The new building is still in need of certain repairs, so fundraising continues. Beside the thrift store, Good Neighbors Services also offers a food pantry, utility assistance, soup kitchen, counseling, is involved with a yearly can-a-thon and the Schoolcraft County Community Resource Fair, and assists in organizing and fundraising to bring Feeding America food distribution trucks to the area.\n\nThe Upper Peninsula Film Union announced in early December that they had decided to save the U.S. Highway 2 Drive In. Built in 1953, it is last drive-in theater in the Upper Peninsula had been officially closed for almost two decades. The Upper Peninsula Film Union is a nonprofit organization comprised of Manistique residents Kevin Knaffla, Don Erickson, and Eric Sherbinow. The Union, with the assistance of U.P. corporate sponsors, has produced free drive in movie events for the community over the past three years. During these special events, various nonprofit groups have operated the concession stand, retaining the funds raised by sales. The drive-in will continue to host open, free events. A “Go Fund Me” page for the Upper Peninsula Film Union has been created to fund the drive in as a permanent fixture in the Upper Peninsula. For more information about the theater or the U.P. Film Union, search the organization on Facebook or visit www.upfilmunion.org. The Union is a 501c3 nonprofit and all donations are tax deductible.\n\nThe paramedics and emergency medical technicians of the Manistique EMS Ambulance Service received a much-needed donation in March – a house. The new living quarters for on-duty employees was gifted the house, by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, for use by Manistique EMS. The gift of the house, located on Oak Street in Manistique, was accepted by Manistique City Council members. Paramedics, who frequently travel from areas south of the Mackinac Bridge to work in the area, now utilize the house. They had previously used the Community Center located next to Central Park.\n\n2019\n\nA decades-long endeavor came to an end this summer. The dredging project aimed at delisting the Manistique River Area of Concern was a multi-agency project involving the Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, U.S. Geologic Survey, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The goal of the project, which began in the late 1990s, has been to de-list the Manistique River as an Area of Concern by removing contaminated sediment from the river’s bottom. The Manistique River has been listed as an Environmental Protection Agency “Area of Concern” since 1987, due to repeated contamination from PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), oils, and combined sewer overflows. PCBs belong to a family of manmade organic chemicals known as chlorinated hydrocarbons, and were the result of a past process performed by the former Manistique Papers, Inc., which used solvents to “de-ink” paper. These solvents leeched PCBs into a lagoon on its property, and, eventually, into the river. The removal of the contaminated material equated to 42,500 cubic yards or about 2,000 truckloads. Approximately $20 million has been invested by the federal government since beginning the Manistique AOC delisting process. Two impairments remain in the Manistique River – restrictions on fish consumption and restrictions on dredging activities. While the current dredge project is designed to correct both these impairments, EGLE officials say it is anticipated to be a few years before “fish tissue concentrations” are in line with Little Bay de Noc, which is the “comparison site”.\n\nHigh winds and water levels wreaked havoc on the area’s shoreline this summer. A section of the Manistique Boardwalk washed away following high winds and water levels in late July. Additional high-water level damage was caused to the boardwalk in September and October. Among the areas negatively affected by the storm were the boardwalk, the Thompson historical marker site, Roger’s Roadside Park, and the Mackinaw Trail Winery. Some areas of the boardwalk affected fall under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Manistique City Manager Sheila Aldrich said multiple points along the boardwalk will need to be reinforced, as they are affected by the high-water levels of Lake Michigan. The city is exploring possible grant opportunities to complete this reinforcement.\n\nSince a millage for the renovation of the former armory building for use of jail was denied by voters last year, the Schoolcraft County Board of Commissioners’ Jail Committee has been exploring alternative options for its dilapidated facility. During a meeting in November, the committee proposed a 2.5- mill millage for jail construction on the front lawn of the current jail. This millage that would bring in roughly $922,654 a year. Based on the 3 percent interest rate currently offered by USDA Rural Development, the county could afford an approximately $12 million jail replacement project cost. The total yearly payment for a 20-year loan, plus contingency payment required by USDA RD, would be approximately $887,304 a year. Financial information has been submitted to the county’s architectural firm, which is expected to produce a conceptual jail design based on those figures. The committee is also expected to pursue a five-year companion millage for the operation of the jail. The millage is expected to appear on the August 2020 ballot.\n\nThe city of Manistique is seeking a combination of grant and loan funds to cover the cost of a more than $1 million emergency infrastructure repair. The repair was the result of a sewer pipe failure and subsequent sinkhole in U.S. Highway 2 near Trader’s Point Drive Sept. 23 and 24. Once crews were mobilized and on site, a bypass system for the sewer infrastructure, consisting of more than 4,000 feet of hose and pipe and multiple pumps, was put into place. Since that time, the failed sewer pipe has been abandoned and a new pipe installed. The city is currently seeking loan and grant funding from the USDA Rural Development to cover the cost of the repair, which is estimated to be just over $1 million.\n\nContractors spent much of the summer battling high water levels in an attempt to complete the third phase of the years-long Manistique Marina update. The project will include: an updated parking lot on the eastern half of the marina, new sidewalks, new electric and water service, lighting upgrades, and the installation of new, floating docks. The portion of the marina roadway that goes beyond the parking lot will be removed and made into green space and new walkways and railings will be installed around the docks. There will be 19 boat slips available, as well as the existing broadside docking. The creation of a boulevard entrance into the marina originally included as part of the project was delayed and the project no longer includes dredging of the marina proper which was deemed unnecessary due to the high lake levels. The nearly $2.4 million project will see wrap-up work completed in spring of 2020 with the expectation that the marina will be fully operational for the entire 2020 season.\n\nmBank, the largest community bank headquartered in the Upper Peninsula, announced in October that it had made its second significant purchase of the year by buying the former Jack’s Supervalu Building on Maple Street. Unlike the purchase and pending donation of the former Creighton building to Lake Effect Community Arts, mBank will retain its newest purchase. The bank plans to renovate the entire building and occupy approximately 15,000 square feet of the 19,000 square-foot building, using it as non-client interfacing office space for operational and administrative offices for current and possible future staff additions. Additionally, plans are in place to create space for an executive training center and community conference room for utilization by local and visiting businesses or organizations. The space is expected to accommodate approximately 70 people. Construction is currently underway in the building and is expected to be completed and ready for use early next spring.\n\nManistique’s newest Power of Words Project “Imagine” was unveiled July 31. Mia Tavonatti, designer and lead artist of the project, as well as visiting and local artists have spent a month completing the artwork. The mural adorns the former Creighton building located on the corner of Oak and Cedar streets which is the planned mBank Arts and Cultural Center. The “wing wall” allows spectators to become a part of the artwork and have “wings” by standing in a certain spot in front of the wall. The Svelata Foundation has partnered with Schoolcraft Tourism and Commerce and Lake Effects Community Arts Center to create both Manistique murals. A future mural project is being planned for the alley between St. Vincent de Paul’s two buildings on a smaller scale.\n\nThe Manistique Lakeshore Campground remains a bright spot for the city of Manistique. In February, the Manistique Downtown Development Authority voted to pursue a land acquisition grant from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund. The land the DDA is looking to acquire consists of seven acres of land west of the current campground. This acquisition would allow for the expansion of the campground, which has been astonishingly successful in its first two seasons. By the end of the year in 2018, campground revenues were at $237,683, while expenses were $116,657. In 2019, approximately 7,668 nights were reserved at the campground. For 2020, the city is anticipating $278,000 in site reservations, with a total anticipated revenue of $288,900 and $288,521 for expenses for the campground. The final figures for 2019’s season will be released when the city completes its financial audit and submits it to the state Dec. 31, 2019."
