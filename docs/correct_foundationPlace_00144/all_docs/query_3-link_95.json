        "text": "One prominent example of such efforts is the so-called metaverse. Not surprisingly for the promotion of supposedly ‘ground breaking’ technologies, the metaverse is a rather old idea. The term itself derives from the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson (1992), a book often credited with predicting many of today’s technologies, and supposedly revered by many a tech guru in Silicon Valley (see Robinson 2017). The term ‘metaverse’ has subsequently been used somewhat loosely to describe a range virtual world-type technologies and massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and indeed, did not escape the attention of education technology researchers.\n\nIn an editorial for a 2008 issue of Educause Review entitled ‘Looking to the Future: Higher Education in the Metaverse’, Collins (2008: 51) opens by asserting that virtual reality technology is ‘over twenty-five years now’. Later, the purpose of the issue is suggested to be a demonstration that ‘legitimate educational uses of virtual worlds are already being discovered and documented and that the academic inquiry into virtual worlds is of a very serious nature indeed’ (52). Remember that? Who could forget the many appraisals of Second Life as the new frontier of online pedagogy (e.g., Warburton 2009), or as ripe territory for the expansion of campus real estate (e.g., Gough and Dearnley 2009)?\n\nBut the metaverse is more, apparently, than a single virtual world platform. As Collins suggested back in 2008:\n\nwe can imagine multiple and myriad digital mirrors of the real world existing alongside multiple and myriad digital worlds that do not represent the real world, all used for a variety of purposes, tied into a variety of communication methods, and populated by any user with Internet access, as well as a steady stream of data originating from objects and devices in the real world. (Collins 2008: 52-52) (emphasis from the original)\n\nIt is perhaps this more intricate vision of seamlessly connected virtual and augmented technologies, alongside cojoined ‘things’, that has excited the entrepreneurs of the tech sector in recent months. That the term ‘metaverse’ probably scores quite highly in Google search metrics currently stems from Mark Zuckerberg’s ceremonial endorsement of the idea at the annual Facebook conference in October 2021 (see Milmo 2021). Well, endorsement is probably an understatement, given the company formally changed its name to Meta in the same year, and has apparently committed $10 billion to the cause of metaverse development (Milmo 2021). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the idea of the metaverse, and in particular Mark Zuckerberg’s reveal video,Footnote 1 was quickly derided, parodied and memeified. However, the lampooning and mockery doesn’t seem to have distracted the tech industry and its investors, which hints at something important about the idea itself.\n\nOf course, mentioning Facebook these days isn’t very de rigour. It’s not where the cool kids hang out anymore. But let’s not forget that it wasn’t that long ago that Facebook was considered rather seriously, if not critically, as a novel space for learning (Selwyn 2009; Aaen and Dalsgaard 2016). And I don’t doubt it still is by many. Nevertheless, the metaverse, supposedly, is bigger than mere Facebook, or rather Meta. Indeed, noting the recent appointment of a metaverse lead at Disney (Josephs and Hoskins 2022), it would be more appropriate for the word count in this editorial to list those companies not, allegedly, involved in the metaverse. And that might be a short list.\n\nUniversities and other educational institutions are, of course, already publicising their involvement (e.g., Busfield 2021; Tannen 2022). In conclusion to her editorial back in 2008, Collins (2008: 62) suggests: ‘it seems safe to predict that within the next three to five years, a higher education institution without a virtual worlds presence will be like an institution without a web presence today’. Collins may have been right with respect to institutional commitments to Second Life, and she may be proved right again if the hyperbole around the metaverse becomes more concrete. Or maybe more virtual?\n\nThere have been critical responses to the metaverse too, for example, Genevieve Bell’s (2022) allusion to the Great Exhibition of 1851 as another example of futuristic ‘world-making’, albeit one that ‘reproduced various kinds of social inequities’, namely those of the British Empire of the time. As Bell further suggests of the Great Exhibition: ‘even as it opened up new spaces of possibility–and profit–it also amplified and reproduced existing power structures through its choices of exhibits and exhibitors, its reliance on the Royal Society for curation, and its constant erasure of colonial reality’. Bell (2022) calls attention to the ways in which any future metaverse might represent the worldview of its (privileged) creators, whilst failing to include the voices and perspectives of others. If Meta’s (née Facebook’s) previous algorithmically driven networks are anything to go by, the metaverse’s ‘world-making’ seems unlikely to promote ideological diversity (see Bakshy 2015).\n\nFurthermore, David Beer (2022) questions the practicality and desirability of a social network rendered in virtual or augmented space, suggesting it would be ‘hard to see this extra layer or dimension within social media space being anything other than superfluous to the actual interactions that populate it’. Beer (2022) argues that, whilst virtual mobility makes sense in a gaming-type space, as a dimension of the competition or entertainment itself, it is made somewhat meaningless in social media spaces that are primarily realised through connection and communication.\n\nYet, this doesn’t mean that social media use is somehow disembodied. Once again, rather well-established ideas about online presence and virtuality seem appropriate to reconsider, such as Allucquère Rosanne Stone’s essay ‘Will the Real Body Please Stand Up?’ (1991), which argued eloquently for an understanding of the persistence of the body in cyberspace. Ray Land (2004) drew on this work and others to refute the ‘incorporeal fallacy’ that learning online might be disembodied, and thus risk-free and inauthentic. Indeed, it seems that only an impoverished understanding of embodiment online would assume social networks are straightforwardly disembodied, and therefore in need of ‘re-embodiment’ through some kind of virtual metaverse populated by rudimentary avatars. Yet here we are, 30 years into the future.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons the idea of the metaverse seems appealing is precisely because it resurfaces old ideologies of anti-statism and techno-utopianism, deep-rooted in the Silicon Valley tech culture (Barbrook and Cameron 1996; Turner and Barbrook in Jandrić 2017). In many of the descriptions of the metaverse, there is a palpable sense of the desire to re-build the Internet itself, and that those involved are pioneers, staking out a new territory like their cyber-forefathers before them. On the surface, then, one might draw parallels with so-called cyberlibertarians like John Perry Barlow, author of ‘A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace’ (1996), who proposed a self-governing Internet, liberated from the authority of the state. And here is where the idea gains power. The metaverse is not simply a platform developed by one company, implying the usual constraints of monopolisation, but rather a new plane of existence, not just void of control by any single corporation, but also free of incursions by any state entity or government. In this sense, a generous view of the metaverse would perceive it as a political project, and one that seeks to continue the ideals of independence and frontierism that excited the early protagonists of cyberspace.\n\nHowever, if all this talk of techno-utopic cyber-libertarianism sounds familiar, it is because, of course, we’ve been here before. Written during the explosive growth of the dot-com era of the 1990s, Barbrook and Cameron’s essay ‘The Californian Ideology’ (1996) encapsulates what is now a long-standing critique of the paradoxical political foundations of the Silicon Valley tech sector, rooted both in the leftist counterculture of the 1960s and the laissez faire economics and individualism of the right. Notably, they describe the ‘cybernetic frontier’ of the 1990s as ‘retro-futurism’, precisely because of allusions, from both the political left and right of the time, to the Internet as a ‘Jeffersonian democracy’, where liberty is founded on the individual ownership of private property (and for Thomas Jefferson himself, as Barbrook and Cameron (1996: 63) emphasise, this included the ownership of human beings as slaves). They further suggest:\n\nthe Californian Ideology is … an exclusive faith. If only some people have access to the new information technologies, ‘Jeffersonian democracy’ can become a hi-tech version of the plantation economy of the Old South. Reflecting its deep ambiguity, the Californian Ideology’s technological determinism is not simply optimistic and emancipatory. It is simultaneously a deeply pessimistic and repressive vision of the future. (Barbrook and Cameron 1996: 63)\n\nThat it has been possible to uncritically promote the metaverse with little acknowledgement of the problematic Silicon Valley frontierism of the past suggests a predictable return to the pessimistic and repressive future cautioned by Barbrook and Cameron (1996). Presumably, the form of statelessness envisaged by today’s ‘big tech’ companies and their investors is characterised by a desire to forestall regulation related to data privacy, rather than deriving from any real interest in pursuing the ideals of philosophical liberalism. As Beer (2022) astutely points out, the fancy gadgets of metaverse immersion–virtual reality (VR) headsets, augmented reality (AR) glasses or haptic clothing–all imply expanded modes of data harvesting, as tech companies seek to datafy not just our online behaviours in software platforms, but our connected bodies and emotions too.\n\nAs Freuler and Cruz (2021) contend, the metaverse, rather than being especially novel, is merely an extension of current practices of profit-making from user data. They further suggest, ‘[u]ltimately, the metaverse is about exercising an even more pervasive form of power – it is an obvious next step for capitalist logic and a distinct challenge to our future collective imagination’. Such critical perspectives have not escaped the attention of those interested in the impact of the metaverse on education. Preston (2021) suggests a number of scenarios in which virtual or augmented spaces might be used to further monetise higher education, dramatically altering the role of the academic in the process.\n\nThe more one searches for information about the metaverse, the more one encounters enthusiastic descriptions of seamless connectivity and futuristic gadgets. There is plenty of pessimism too. This is perhaps where the real value of the metaverse lies, and where more critical attention might be directed. Rather than any kind of actual arrival or launch-date for the metaverse, that moment when the dream of a brand-new virtual-augmented-and-real Internet is finally realised—it is the promise of tomorrow itself that should be scrutinised. Beer (2022) articulates this well in suggesting that the metaverse may simply be ‘a vanishing point on the horizon’ and therefore act as ‘a way of justifying actions and developments as they occur now’.\n\nThe point here is that, in order to begin to evaluate the metaverse and its role in education, we don’t need to wait until lecture halls and classrooms are kitted out with VR headsets and students are issued with haptic vests at the point of admission. Rather, one can look at what is being justified right now, in the name of the metaverse. That is not to say all the answers are already known. As Williamson et al. (2019: 88) suggest, there is much work to do in identifying and examining ‘the new political economy of the digitised and datafied twenty-first century’, as a research priority for the area of education technology research. Given the significant investments that appear to be directed towards the metaverse, the promise of a new Internet terrain seems to be emerging as a significant factor, suggesting orientations towards particular kinds of technologies and specific practices of data extraction and modelling that may warrant continued critical inspection. When new kinds of technologies appear on the horizon, education inevitably seems to get pulled along for the ride, in some form or another. Understanding just what is being envisioned for the political economy of the metaverse may shed some light on the ways education might be shaped in the future.\n\nMost of the commentary seems to situate the metaverse firmly upon the skyline of Silicon Valley. But the real power and appeal of the metaverse are in its uncritical assumption of a frontier territory ripe for the taking, where, supposedly, anyone displaying an entrepreneurial spirit can stake a claim. This makes the horizon of the metaverse much wider than the prospect of California. As The Economist (2022: 51–52) recently reported: ‘there is a metaverse gold rush in China to match the hype in Silicon Valley. By the end of 2021 some 1,600 firms had applied for 11,000 trademarks with the Chinese word for metaverse (yuan yuzhou)’. The article goes on to suggest that China’s ‘deep-pocketed tech firms’ such as Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba, with their already-existing cloud-computing infrastructure, are well-placed to play significant roles in any future metaverse. However, China’s interest in the metaverse implies a more profound direction for future virtual worlds, and one that seems to challenge the kind of frontierism presumably envisioned by the Silicon Valley set.\n\nWhilst the likes of Meta, Google and Microsoft might harbour dreams of new data-hungry virtual domains that can stay one step ahead of privacy laws, the recent regulatory landscape in China (see Knox 2021) suggests that the notion of statelessness would hold no meaning in a Chinese metaverse. As with AI technology before it (remember when AI was ‘on the horizon’?–see Knox 2020), recent state endorsements from the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (see Shen 2021) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (see Global Times 2022) suggest that the metaverse is being corralled into the broader strategies of geopolitical competition. As The Economist (2022: 52) suggests, ‘[i]n official parlance, this is known as “overtaking the curve”’, where new technology horizons such as the metaverse are seen as ‘a chance to beat the West’. Of course, the threat of China’s technological prowess is itself frequently used (as it was with AI) as a ‘vanishing point on the horizon’ in order to justify technology strategy elsewhere, particularly in the USA.\n\nNevertheless, the possibility of a Chinese metaverse suggests more than a simple tale of cold war rivalry over the latest tech innovations. It overturns the frontier ideology that has, arguably, underpinned the entire Silicon Valley project of digital revolution, including the ways social media platforms and services are presented to us today. In discussing the early counterculture origins of Silicon Valley, Turner and Jandrić emphasise ‘very deep American beliefs in the power of the individual, in the existence of an open landscape, a frontier where the self could be remade’ (in Jandrić 2017: 67). Whilst such visions of individual empowerment may have motivated Facebook to pursue the metaverse as some kind of return to the techno-liberal ideals of the past, rendered in endlessly customisable environments and avatars, the cultural history of frontierism has little resonance in China. It is beyond the scope of this editorial to attempt to articulate China’s cultural history of the Internet; however, Guo’s (2021) study of a vibrant, creative and sophisticated interplay between freedom and control might be one place to begin to speculate about how a Chinese metaverse might unfold.\n\nIf the digital ‘has lost its novelty or salience’ (Fuller and Jandrić 2019: 215) in these postdigital times, the heralding of a new tech frontier may fall on less enthusiastic ears. At least, that might explain the lukewarm, if not cynical, response to the metaverse, perhaps best captured by the tech-weary ‘Icelandverse’ parody, extoling the very real Icelandic outdoors, accessed without ‘silly looking headsets’.Footnote 2 However, a brief glance at the financial news suggests that investors might see things rather differently, with one example, perhaps unsurprisingly, promoting the metaverse as a ‘$1 trillion-dollar revenue opportunity’ (see Holmes 2021). So why is the metaverse being taken so seriously, when the idea itself seems a bit ‘old hat’?\n\nOne answer lies precisely in its attempt to revive the frontierism that characterised the early days of Silicon Valley, not necessarily for the liberal philosophy, but rather because it makes good business sense. Discussing the counterculture communities that influenced the digital revolution of the 1990s, Turner and Jandrić suggest they ‘did not think they were embracing new beliefs. They thought they were finding their way back to an older and better world’ (in Jandrić 2017: 67). For the contemporary metaverse enthusiasts, the better world they want to return to is one of unfettered innovation on the digital frontier. Frontierism, one might therefore suggest, is a kind of modus operandi of the tech sector, allowing it to maintain the position of chief protagonist in a world of persistent technological disruption, where the rules of the digital game are in constant flux.\n\nIn this sense, the metaverse isn’t so much an innovation, but rather a reset button, rendering obsolete everything that has become established and institutionalised about the current Internet, and in its place, conjuring up a new virtual and augmented wilderness, for which the tech entrepreneurs are our only chaperon. As Holmes (2021) suggests in a guide for metaverse investment, ‘Confused? Don’t worry, you’re in good company … If you’re of a certain age, you probably recall feeling similarly lost when the Internet came to prominence in the 1990s’. There is power in the maintenance of the frontier, where everyone but the tech gurus feels lost and confused. Indeed, it seems more than coincidental that Facebook, not long after the shift to ‘Meta’ and the boosting of the metaverse, announced its first ever drop in users (see Naughton 2022), motivating the push for a new frontier.\n\nRather than get caught up in the hype, educationalists would do well to recognise the cynical nostalgia bound up in the promotion of the metaverse, and remember the already-existing and significant academic engagement with themes of virtuality, embodiment, presence and absence, as Collins (2008) reminded us, over 20 years ago. But more than simply being cautious about which brand of new VR headset to procure, those engaged with the metaverse might recognise the inherent politics, ‘pre-installed’ if you will, of new technological frontiers, for which the metaverse seems to be a palpable example. Education has a vital role to play in casting any new AR and VR domains as spaces of political contestation, where new economies and social relations might unfold, and certainly where new regimes of somatic datafication may come to (re)define public life."
