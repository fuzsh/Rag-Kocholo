        "text": "Qualcomm moving ahead of Allwinner et al. in CPU and GPU while trying to catch up with Allwinner in Ultra HD\n\n[Updated Feb 27, 2013] The ”Allwinner phenomenon” coming from nowhere in 2012 is threatening all established players in the SoC industry, even the industry’s undisputed leader Qualcomm. This was the reason why Qualcomm was forced to strengthen its Cortex based S4 Play class ahead of time already twice in the recent months, and came the time to announce its next-gen Krait microarchitectures with significantly enhanced GPU and video processing unit capabilities.\n\nIn fact it was necessary to introduce two microarchitecture steps at once: Krait 300 and Krait 400. Even the SoC classification was further changed with the corresponding S600 (for mid-high tier smartphones and tablets) and S800 (for premium smartphones, Smart TVs, digital media adapters and tablets) “processor brand tiers” while the company was yet unable to decide how the existing S4 Play, S4 Plus and S4 Pro classes, introduced just in August 2011, should be transformed into the new S200 (for entry level smartphones) and S400 (for high volume smartphones and tablets) “processor brand tiers” in order to remain competitive. While Qualcomm will undoubtebly be able to defend its SoC leadership position with the announcements already made there will be even bigger trouble for the already ailing giant with Intel’s biggest flop: at least 3-month delay in delivering the power management solution for its first tablet SoC [this same ‘Experiencing the Cloud’ blog, Dec 20, 2012].\n\nUpdate: Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, 400, 600 and 800 at Mobile World Congress 2013 [Charbax YouTube channel, Feb 27, 2013]\n\nUpdate: Qualcomm Reveals the Snapdragon™ 400 and 200 Processors [OnQ Blog by Qualcomm, Feb 20, 2013] the essence of which I will include into the updated table below in order to make it easy to compare with everything introduced earlier by Qualcomm in the new “Krait era” of Snapdragon SoCs:\n\nUpdate: LG Optimus G Pro, 5.5″ 1080p IPS display, 1.7Ghz Qualcomm S600\n\n[Charbax YouTube channel, Feb 26, 2013] a full HD (1080p) LTE device said to be ”available in Q1 in globally selected markets” [4:11-4:18]\n\nOriginally launched in key target LTE markets, the LG Optimus G is making its debut in over 50 countries. The newest addition to LG’s Optimus G series, the Optimus G Pro, was recently introduced to the Korean public. The Optimus G Pro is a 4G LTE-equipped smartphone with a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display, 2GB DDR RAM and compelling new UX features such as Dual Recording (capture video with the two chambers of the phone, the front and rear simultaneously to create content PiP [Picture-in-Picture]) and Virtual Reality (VR) Panorama (create 360-degree images of both environments horizontal or vertical). The Full HD IPS display G Optimus Pro, developed with LG Display, offers a resolution of 1.920 x 1080 pixels at 400 dpi. This smartphone battery provides more capacity in its category, 3140 mAh, allowing you to enjoy for hours viewing experience in Full HD on your mobile. It also has a front camera of 2.1 MP and a 13 MP rear. Thus, users can capture images and videos in Full HD, the same quality as HDTVs.\n\nMore information: OPTIMUS G PRO, LG’S FIRST FULL HD SMARTPHONE, LAUNCHES THIS WEEK IN KOREA [LG Electronics press release Feb 18, 2013]\n\nUpdate: HTC One announced with UltraPixel camera, 4.7-inch display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor [BGRIndia YouTube channel, Feb20, 2013] to be available in March worldwide\n\nHTC One announced with UltraPixel camera, 4.7-inch 1080p display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor Byhttp://www.bgr.in The HTC One is finally official. Yes, all the leaks of the past few weeks were true and we are indeed looking at HTC’s first smartphone with an “ultrapixel” camera. It looks every bit like the leaked render and we are indeed talking about a 4.7-inch full HD 1080p display with a pixel density of 468PPI in a unibody machine chiselled chassis.\n\nMore information: Ubuntu and HTC in lockstep [‘Experiencing the Cloud’ blog, Feb 19, 2013]\n\nUpdate: Snapdragon 400 as now defined by Qualcomm (see MSM 8230 under the S400 in the above table) came first to the market with the Huawei Ascend W1 introduced at CES 2013. See Huawei Device – The Stage is Yours with the Ascend W1 [HuaweiDeviceCo YouTube channel, Jan 8, 2013]\n\nThis device is also The first Windows Phone 4Afrika from Huawei for $150 = Huawei Ascend W1 for $240 (in China) and more elsewhere [Feb 5, 2013], and as such it is part of the Microsoft’s 4Afrika Initiative [Videos4Afrika YouTube channel, Feb 5, 2013]\n\nWatch from [0:54] to [1:10] part of the video for Huawei 4Afrika device with MSM 8230 Snapdragon 400 inside. This is showing quite well that for this 3-year initiative by Microsoft this Snapdragon 400 SoC will satisfy the entry-level requirements too, and not only in the smartphone space but in the tablet space as well.\n\nUpdate: The All-New Snapdragon 800 Series [QUALCOMMVlog YouTube channel, Jan 24, 2013] for which devices were said to be available in the middle of 2013\n\nSnapdragon 800 processors bring the power of 4G LTE advanced, delivering download speeds up to 150 mbps. Now you can stream movies, surf the web, and do so much more, better and faster.

What I call it premium, which is aligned with HBO and Showtime quality, networking cable quality” she said. “Then, of course we’re looking at alternative, reality, live events. All of the premium. It’s a premium service. Also we are looking at each content as what it would be best. Whether in format, whether in time. So we are not constrained in the same way traditional media distribution companies are, having to produce something at certain length. We have 46 million global users all connected. With all the premium service we offer may be behind, being part of the the membership.” [06:05]\n\nIn addition to producing content internally, Tellem said she was also looking at partnering with “traditional media partners, studios and creatives.”\n\n“[The] Xbox brand stands for the best, most interactive, most amazing entertainment you can get,” Yusuf Mehdi said, comparing it to low-cost media streamers like the Roku. [08:35] “Our current and future investment is about doing the things that are big and premium. Let really do things that are amazing for customers.” [08:43]\n\nWould you become a pay-TV provider? [09:18] “For questions like this it always goes back to what do we feel we can really be best in the world we are doing, what’s our value add” he said. “Our value add is not being another distributor of content that comes from many good sources today, it’s about adding that level of interactivity, creativity, fidelity that makes it come alive.” [09:36]\n\n[12:46] Nancy Tellem: “I think one of the perfect example of more live events as you’re looking at, this is more hypothetical as obviously we’re not there yet, but certainly if you do a comedy show, and you can actually from a transactional standpoint know where the comedians going to be performing, buy tickets, that’s an example. You can also, not just from a Twitter standpoint, but actually share with your friends, actually experience it together. He or she may be on the other side of the United States or in anthor country, Ireland or wherever, that’s kind of the real time experience that really is quite unique. We’ve already done a joint venture with Sesame Street where from children’s programming the kids can actually interact with the video itself and have a real interactive experience with …” [13:50]\n\nShe saw episodes ranging from as short as 10 minutes to an hour and a half, multiple episodes being produced, and using Xbox’s interactive capabilities, be it the voice-and-gesture-enabled Kinect or the second-screen SmartGlass app.\n\nXbox Execs Talk Momentum and the Future of TV [Microsoft feature story, Feb 11, 2013]\n\nLiving room entertainment is in its largest evolutionary period since the transitions of black-and-white to color, and from standard definition to high definition. The Xbox 360, alongside Microsoft’s entertainment industry partners, is at the forefront of that evolution as one of the only devices that brings all forms of entertainment together in one device, while making access to content easy and providing new ways to interact with existing programming. In 2012, the amount of TV and other entertainment offerings on Xbox almost tripled, now surpassing 100 custom, voice-controlled TV and entertainment apps on Xbox LIVE.\n\n“Yes, we started with video games, but we have been on a journey to make Xbox the center of every household’s entertainment,” says Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment Business.\n\nToday Mehdi, along with Nancy Tellem, president of entertainment and digital media at Microsoft, participated in a D: Dive into Media session, facilitated by Peter Kafka, to discuss that journey and the opportunities that lie ahead. Mehdi revealed some new data that illustrates how entertainment usage on the Xbox has exploded during its living room transformation, and Tellem shared more about her newly created Los Angeles-based Xbox Entertainment Studios.\n\nToday, there are more than 76 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. That’s three times the number of original Xbox consoles sold. And a Kinect sensor now sits next to roughly one third of those Xbox 360 consoles; the company has sold 24 million Kinect sensors since launch.\n\nSocial has been an important part of Xbox from the beginning, and that’s true today more than ever. The Xbox LIVE community has grown to 46 million members, a 15 percent growth since last year.\n\n2012 also marked the Xbox’s biggest year for entertainment and games usage. Users enjoyed more than 18 billion hours of entertainment in 2012, with entertainment app usage growing 57 percent year over year globally. Last year in the United States, Xbox LIVE Gold members averaged 87 hours per month on Xbox, an increase of 10 percent year over year.\n\nThose numbers strongly indicate that consumers enjoy all kinds of entertainment via Xbox, and Mehdi believes the future of entertainment is even brighter, as Microsoft plans to keep the momentum rolling.\n\n“We believe that Xbox is being used by more people in the household, during more hours in the day and for more forms of entertainment,” he says. “People are using Xbox in the morning to work out with the Kinect Nike+ Fitness program, kids are watching cartoons, families are enjoying movies, and of course people are playing blockbuster games like ‘Halo 4.’”\n\nThe Future of TV Is Interactive and More Engaging\n\nAccording to Mehdi, Xbox has something in the living room no one else has – a large installed base of devices already in the home, connected to TVs, and over half of those are already linked together, delivering amazing personalized and social entertainment experiences via the Xbox LIVE network.\n\nMicrosoft believes that the future of TV and entertainment is one where the TV becomes interactive and more engaging, Mehdi and Tellem explain. Microsoft sees that viewers want to do more with their TV shows, movies, sports and other forms of entertainment.\n\n“We believe that we are at the start of the next wave of truly interactive entertainment,” Tellem says.\n\nTellem is spearheading a new L.A.-based studio called Xbox Entertainment Studios, where the mission is to create true interactive content for Xbox and other devices that will change the way entertainment content is experienced and delivered. Tellem also now oversees live event programming for Xbox LIVE. Xbox has had success with live events such as the Elections 2012 Hub on Xbox LIVE, which aired the presidential debates with an added interactive polling capability. Viewers submitted 3 million answers to on-screen questions during the live telecast of one of the debates. More recently, Xbox aired an interactive red carpet experience for this year’s Grammy Awards and will be doing the same for the 85th Academy Awards.\n\n“When I worked in traditional TV, we would find ourselves saying things like ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we could add an interactive aspect directly into the show and engage directly with the viewers?’” says Tellem. “With Xbox, that is possible today.”\n\nXbox already offers content such Kinect Sesame Street TV, which blurs the lines between traditional linear TV show and interactive experience, where a kid can jump into their beloved Sesame Street and throw coconuts at Grover.\n\nBut it’s not just about new types of entertainment; it’s also about new business models and new engagement opportunities for advertisers. Mehdi called the launch of NUads – a new ad format that harnesses Kinect and natural user interface – an important moment for TV advertising. NUads deliver what is most scarce to advertisers today: consumer engagement. NUads enable natural interactivity using the simplicity of a spoken word or the wave of a hand. The first wave of NUads, which launched last fall with interactive polling, saw a record level of consumer engagement with 37 percent of people responding. With this model, passive TV advertising is transformed into engaging and actionable experiences.\n\nPioneering the Future of TV\n\nIn addition to Xbox Entertainment Studios creating content that will highlight what’s possible and demonstrate the capability of the Xbox platform, Microsoft will continue to partner with content creators, networks, aggregators and advertisers to “pioneer the future of TV,” says Tellem.\n\nDuring 2013, Microsoft is planning to launch more than 40 new voice-controlled, customized TV and entertainment apps on Xbox.\n\n“We want to partner with the industry to bring entertainment into a new era,” she says. “It’s an era when interactive entertainment becomes the greatest form of all entertainment – and we couldn’t be more excited to play a part in it.”\n\nWill Next Gen Xbox Win With Premium Media Combo? [Breaking Analysis] [siliconangle YouTube, Feb 12, 2013]\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox 360 has been morphing from a gaming console to an entertainment console, and Microsoft intends to capitalize on that in its future Xbox consoles. Although Microsoft has not confirmed that a next gen Xbox is in the works, details have still been leaked about a new console. SiliconANGLE Contributing Editor John Casaretto shared his knowledge regarding the source of the leaks, a person by the name of SuperDaE. SuperDaE made headlines last year when he tried to sell a Durango development kit on eBay. Durango is allegedly the code name for the next gen Xbox project. Casaretto concluded, “He’s got a lot of information, a lot of it seems really poignant, and he’s a very credible source.” Casaretto named some of the new features of the new console, noting there are some interesting twists to them, such as the ability to run multiple games simultaneously, required game installations, and the compatiblity with a new, improved (and mandatory) Kinect sensor. He explained that some of the features that were previously optional are now unified into one grand Xbox. Microsoft’s senior VP of interactive entertainment, Yusuf Mehdi, claimed that the Xbox 360 is transitioning from a gaming console to an entertainment before their eyes. Casaretto believes this is a natural evolution and expects to see more gaming, more video content, and even more shopping coming through the Xbox, turning it into a genuine family entertainment center. He predicted, “I think we’ll see this symbiosis of entertainment and gaming, and this will apply to Nintendo and Sony as well. They’ll certainly follow suit.” There is also some speculation that Microsoft will expand its popular monthly subscription service, Xbox Live, to include original shows, just as Amazon and Netflix have done. Casaretto stated that their success in this area will depend on the type of content they put out. He said if they’re trying to make completely original shows, such as sitcoms, it could easily turn into a money pit very quickly in trying to keep up with other popular shows out there. However, if it’s in alignment with game releases and other events, he said it’s possible Microsoft could be right on the money with this expansion idea, but it will take some time to establish their presence in this space. Likewise, in other new media TV developments, Intel Media has confirmed they are currently working to launch internet television this year. The Verge reported that Intel Media plans to provide “live television, catch-up television, on-demand [and] a set of applications.” Their hardware package will include a set-top box and a camera, which could be used for synchronized viewing with other viewers across the country. Casaretto observed that Microsoft has been very quiet about their new branding strategy with Xbox. He reminded viewers that Sony is expected to say something about their new Playstation soon, and he believes Microsoft is waiting to key off of Sony’s announcement.

Having recently joined the team, I have the benefit of fresh perspective, and one of the things that has struck me is the amount of opportunities we have ahead.\n\nBefore joining Xbox, I had the fortune of being a part of some incredible periods of innovation and incubation such as in the early days of Windows and Internet Explorer, and, more recently, with the creation of Bing. I have also had a great passion for gaming and entertainment, and watched the growth of MSN into one of the world’s largest media sites on the Internet.\n\nSimilar to many of those experiences, the Xbox has arrived at an important inflection point in its growth and development. In particular, in the last year, the Xbox has transcended from a gaming console to a broad entertainment device inclusive of movies, TV, music and sports. I will give you an example of what that means.\n\nA few weeks back, my family and I decided to escape a rainy Sunday afternoon by watching a movie. The need for indoor entertainment in Seattle in May is (sadly) no surprise, but what really struck me was the way my son went about finding a movie. After my children finished a heated rock-paper-scissors battle to determine who got to choose what we would watch, my son sprinted to the Xbox 360. He didn’t first turn on the TV or go to our relatively hefty collection of DVDs. For him, the Xbox is now the gateway to what he wants to watch.\n\nNow, my household may be a little biased, but my son isn’t alone. Xbox will always mean games, but for tens of millions of people around the globe, it also means music, TV, movies and more. Xbox LIVE subscribers now spend an average of 84 hours per month on the console. For comparison, the average American watches a little more than 150 hours of TV in the same period. The more entertainment options we add, the more time people spend on Xbox. In the last six months, we’ve grown our entertainment library on Xbox to include more than 60 voice controlled applications and more than 200,000 premium movies and TV shows.\n\nAs a result of people engaging with Xbox more frequently for more entertainment activities, we have been able to defy gravity compared to where consoles traditionally are at this point in their lifecycle. Sales for Xbox 360 in year five were greater than in year four, sales in year six were greater than in year five, and sales in year seven were greater than in year six.\n\nSince 2005—when we launched Xbox 360—we have sold 67 million consoles and have generated more than $56 billion at retail, and we’re still going strong in our seventh year. With 47 percent share of the current-generation console market in the U.S., we are hitting our stride largely as a result of the success of Kinect for Xbox 360 (19 million sold worldwide) and the flood of new entertainment options through Xbox LIVE (40 million members worldwide).\n\nTo date, our success with Xbox has been led by a box in the living room. Moving forward, Xbox will go beyond the box to reach all new families of devices. Just as Xbox has grown to mean more than just games, it also is more than just a console. This year, Xbox becomes the premium entertainment service for Microsoft. Whether on your PC, tablet, TV or phone, Xbox will be a gateway to the best in music and video, your favorite games and instant access to your friends. With the launch of Windows 8, we’ll bring Xbox entertainment to everyone. With Xbox on Windows 8 devices, we rapidly accelerate the reach of Xbox entertainment from more than 60 million people to hundreds of millions of people worldwide.\n\nWe understand that entertainment has become a multi-screen experience where you and your friends are watching TV, listening to music, and playing games while interacting with your tablets and phones in new ways. We’ve got ideas for making all the entertainment you love more personal, interactive and social across the devices you love—and on the phenomenal Windows 8 devices that are to come.\n\nYou’ll see the first of that next week at E3 where we will showcase the very best of Xbox. We’ll unveil new games, show new ways to enjoy the entertainment you love and, as always, we’ll have a few surprises to share!\n\nWe can’t wait. We kick things off on Monday, June 4 at 9:30 a.m. PT. You can watch us on live TV though our partnership with Spike TV, on the Web (Xbox.com), and for the first time ever – on Xbox LIVE.\n\nPosted by Yusuf Mehdi\n\nChief Marketing Officer, Interactive Entertainment Division, Microsoft\n\nIntroducing the New Entertainment Experience from Xbox [The Official Microsoft Blog, Oct 22, 2012]\n\nBelow is a post from Yusuf Mehdi, Chief Marketing Officer for Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment Division, announcing details about a major new update to the Xbox dashboard and the launch of Xbox SmartGlass, which brings games, music, TV and movie experiences off the console and onto your phone, tablet and PC.\n\nSteve Ballmer recently stated that 2012 will be “the most epic year in Microsoft’s history.”\n\nNot only do we have major releases coming to the PC, tablet and phone, but we have worked extremely hard to ensure those screens work together with the other major screen in peoples’ lives, the television. People often call out the role Microsoft design style is playing in this new wave of experiences from the company. Whether you are using a phone, PC, tablet or console that is running our software you have an experience that is distinctively Microsoft, elegant, intuitive and integrated.\n\nNow, there is another common thread that ties all of these experiences together – Xbox entertainment.\n\nToday marks the beginning of two major launches for Xbox entertainment.\n\nFirst, on top of what is the greatest year for games in Xbox history, beginning today a brand new update will roll out broadly for every Xbox 360 owner in the world that brings entirely new TV entertainment experiences. We are bringing the Web to the TV like never before with Internet Explorer, launching a brand new music service, and making it even easier to find the entertainment you love using Kinect and Bing voice search. This release is the next step in our journey to transform Xbox 360 from a games console to an all-in-one entertainment system.\n\nSecond, we are bringing Xbox Entertainment off the console to your phone, tablet and PC to deliver great games, music, TV and movie experiences. And as a part of this effort with Xbox SmartGlass we are going to introduce amazing multi-screen entertainment experiences.\n\nBack in June, we talked about how this is the year Xbox becomes the premium entertainment service for Microsoft. While our success with Xbox to date has been led by a box in the living room, we’re now reaching individuals in new and exciting ways across PCs, tablets and phones. Xbox will be a gateway to the best in movies, TV shows, music, sports, your favorite games and instant access to your friends, wherever you are.\n\nThis week, with the launch of Windows 8, followed shortly thereafter by Windows Phone 8 devices, we’ll flip the switch on that transformation with the launches of four new experiences that make entertainment better on every screen in your life:\n\nXbox Music,\n\nXbox Video\n\nXbox Games; and\n\nXbox SmartGlass.\n\nAt that moment, we will rapidly accelerate the reach of Xbox entertainment from more than 67 million consoles to literally hundreds of millions of devices worldwide. Also this week, we will take our biggest step ever to increase our global reach, extending Xbox entertainment experiences to 222 countries from 35.\n\nWe realize some may ask, “Why are all these apps called Xbox, isn’t Xbox just a game console?” For us the decision to have Xbox stand for our broad entertainment efforts was a simple one. It is a natural evolution of our consumer offering. Even as Xbox has become the number one game console in the world, and continued to deliver arguably the best line up of games in our history, we have seen the use of Xbox broaden to watching TV/movies and listening to music.\n\nDuring the last couple of years, we have grown our global entertainment portfolio to more than 62 TV and entertainment partners. Our Xbox LIVE subscribers now spend more time enjoying entertainment apps than multiplayer games. And this is occurring even when multiplayer gaming is also growing on our console.\n\nAlso, we live in a multi-device world. The millions of people enjoying entertainment on their Xbox are doing so within arm’s reach of another device. We believe your entertainment should travel seamlessly across devices, that devices should work together to make your entertainment more accessible and create entirely new experiences. We knew we needed a single name for all entertainment experiences from our company and nothing means entertainment at Microsoft more than Xbox.\n\nXbox SmartGlass is a great example of our approach to multi-screen entertainment. With SmartGlass we are focusing on two key objectives:\n\nMake discovering and controlling your entertainment simple, no matter the device you’re using; and\n\nEnsure you get more from your entertainment experience.\n\nXbox SmartGlass is a free downloadable app that takes your Windows 8 and RT tablets and PCs, Windows Phone 8, iOS and Android devices, and converts them into smart second screens for the entertainment you are enjoying through your Xbox.\n\nToday, we are unveiling our first wave of experiences and partners for Xbox SmartGlass. They are the first of many to become available over the coming months.\n\nNavigate your Entertainment – Your phone and tablet will become the best remote controls in your house. Use the touch screen on your smartphone or tablet to control your Xbox 360, and use your devices to pause, rewind or advance entertainment.\n\nTV & Movies – With Xbox Video, start a TV show or movie on your Windows 8 tablet and finish it on the big screen through Xbox 360; see the names of cast and crew for the film you are watching and discover related films. To give you one example of what you can expect, coming next season, HBO GO’s “Game of Thrones” will offer groundbreaking Xbox SmartGlass experiences.\n\nSports – While watching the game, use a second screen to follow real-time stats, player bios, news and highlights you may have missed. All of this and more will be available for NBA Game Time, ESPN and UFC in the coming months.\n\nMusic – Control your Xbox Music experience on the TV using your smartphone or tablet, discover related artists and songs, cue up additional music, read artist bios and more.\n\nInternet Explorer for Xbox – The Web comes to TV like never before with Xbox 360 and Xbox SmartGlass. With your smartphone or tablet, pan or pinch and zoom to explore the Web on the largest and best screen in the house, enjoy easy text entry with the keyboard on your tablet or phone, and then move your browser back to your device to take it on the go.\n\nGames – Get more from your game when you can use a second screen. Turn you phone or tablet into a virtual GPS in Forza: Horizon. Don’t stop the dance party in Dance Central 3 by going back to the menu to choose your next song. Instead, queue it up on your tablet or smartphone. In HomeRun Stars, use SmartGlass on your favorite device to throw a surprise pitch to your friend up at bat in front of Kinect. See detailed stats on how you are progressing in Halo 4, or check up on friends. All of these features and much more will be available when your favorite game extends to multiple screens.\n\nAnd we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what’s possible. In the future, new games will be created, TV shows and movies will be re-imagined, and sports will be broadcast from the ground up with Xbox SmartGlass in mind.\n\nMoreover, we are making it easier than ever to buy an Xbox 360 console. Starting this fall, we are rolling out the “Entertainment for All” pricing plan that enables you to buy an Xbox 360 for $99 when you sign up for 2 years of Xbox LIVE. Entertainment For All Plan will include U.S. retailers: Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, Toys R Us and the Microsoft Store.\n\nWith these new technologies, services and pricing, Xbox entertainment has never been:\n\nMore simple and engaging\n\nAvailable on so many new devices; and\n\nMore affordable.\n\nSo, yes, this is certainly an epic year for Microsoft. But more importantly, it’s an epic time for all of you that love amazing entertainment.\n\nThen there is certainly Nancy Tellem:\n\nMicrosoft Names Longtime Entertainment Executive Nancy Tellem Entertainment & Digital Media President [Microsoft press release, Sept 18, 2012]\n\nMicrosoft Corp. today announced that Nancy Tellem, former president of CBS Network Television Entertainment Group, has joined Microsoft as Entertainment & Digital Media president.\n\nIn her role reporting to Phil Spencer, corporate vice president, Microsoft Studios, Tellem will oversee the launch of a newly created production studio in Los Angeles that will develop interactive and linear content for Xbox and other devices. In addition to running the production studio, she will help spearhead the company’s efforts to turn Xbox into a destination where consumers can enjoy all their entertainment in one place.\n\nTellem and her group will collaborate with the creative community to develop unique, compelling storytelling experiences for the Xbox brand. More than just a gaming console, Xbox has evolved into a consumer destination for the world’s most popular TV, movies, music and sports content. With a roster of more than 65 entertainment apps, including Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO GO, MLB.TV, ESPN, YouTube and VEVO,global video consumption on Xbox LIVE has increased 140 percent during the past year. In addition, this September, Microsoft will introduce 2-way TV experiences from renowned entertainment partners Sesame Workshop and National Geographic that will further expand the Xbox platform beyond games, offering entertainment options for everyone in the family.\n\n“I am excited to be a part of the continued evolution of Xbox from a gaming console to the hub of every household’s entertainment experience,” Tellem said. “The Xbox is already a consumer favorite, and we now have a tremendous opportunity to transform it into the center of all things entertainment — from games, music and fitness to news, sports, live events, television series and movies — so consumers have one destination for all their entertainment needs. I look forward to building a studio team that embraces the challenges of creating true interactive content that the Xbox platform supports and to work with talent to create content that will change the way entertainment content is experienced and delivered.”\n\n“Whether you are voting for your favorite contestant on a TV show or playing a game, entertainment is becoming more personalized and social, driven by the Internet and new tools to interact with content,” Spencer said. “We are embarking on a new chapter with the creation of a studio dedicated to making original interactive and linear content, and I’m excited to have Nancy leading this effort.”\n\n“With her impressive background in entertainment innovation, I am thrilled to have Nancy join our team,” said Don Mattrick, president of the Interactive Entertainment Business Group at Microsoft. “Under her direction, we look forward to building and extending our creative offerings from the living room to all your devices.”\n\nTellem has been a CBS executive since 1997, most recently as senior adviser to CEO Leslie Moonves, where she explored business and strategic opportunities — domestic and international — involving content partnerships, new production models, emerging media and technologies. As president of the CBS Network Television Entertainment Group, Tellem supervised programming, development, production, business affairs and operations. She oversaw the network’s prime-time, daytime, late-night and Saturday morning lineups (with shows like “CSI,” “Survivor,” “Everybody Loves Raymond” and “The King of Queens”). Before joining CBS, Tellem was executive vice president of Business and Financial Affairs for Warner Bros. Television and was part of the team that launched the landmark programs “Friends” and “ER.”\n\nIn 2006, Tellem was inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame for her contributions to the electronic arts. In 2008, Forbes ranked her 32nd on its list of “The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women” and Entertainment Weekly named her the third-smartest person in TV for quickly restoring CBS’s entire primetime lineup after the 100-day writers’ strike. That same year, the National Association of Television Program Executives awarded Tellem a Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award in recognition of her “extraordinary passion, leadership, independence and vision in the process of creating TV programming.”\n\nAbout Xbox\n\nXbox is Microsoft’s premier entertainment service for the TV, phone, PC and tablet. It’s home to the best and broadest games, as well as one of the world’s largest libraries of music, movies, TV and sports. With Kinect, Xbox 360 transformed gaming and entertainment in the living room with a whole new way to play games and find entertainment — no controller required.

Jones and why she’s not into violent entertainment: “I don’t like blood.”\n\nNancy Tellem, who had been a consultant to CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves for nearly three years after stepping down as president of the CBS Network Television Entertainment Group in 2009, became entertainment and digital media president at Microsoft on Sept. 18. One of her primary mandates: to create a TV studio in Los Angeles during the next year, where she and her staff will make original content for the 40 million customers worldwide who subscribe to Xbox Live, which already features fare from Netflix, ESPN, HBO Go, Amazon Prime and other providers. Tellem, 58, a mother of three sons who is married to sports agent Arn Tellem — and who spends what little free time she has bicycling, reading and doing yoga — spoke with THR at her temporary office at Wasserman Media Group in Los Angeles.\n\nNancy Tellem, who had been a consultant to CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves for nearly three years after stepping down as president of the CBS Network Television Entertainment Group in 2009, became entertainment and digital media president at Microsoft on Sept. 18.

Tellem, 58, a mother of three sons who is married to sports agent Arn Tellem — and who spends what little free time she has bicycling, reading and doing yoga — spoke with THR at her temporary office at Wasserman Media Group in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter: Is it scary to move from traditional TV to a tech company?\n\nTellem: For me, it was a natural next step. I was always interested in where the next distribution platform was happening and was very engaged with talking to tech companies.\n\nTHR: Xbox Live already gives users access to tons of video. Why do you need original content?\n\nTellem: Incredible content really raises the brand — look at Mad Men with AMC. So original programming gives us an opportunity to kind of brand the Xbox. And looking at the technology the Xbox console provides, we are really a bit ahead of the more traditional media companies in having the ability to develop and produce interactive content.\n\nTHR: What types of shows do you plan to make?\n\nTellem: We’re looking at all forms of content for every member of the family. So that certainly covers live events, reality, game shows, documentaries and scripted comedy or drama. We’ll cover it all. We’re figuring this out as we go. But we certainly intend to produce things with high production value, with the same breadth of storytelling that you see on traditional TV.\n\nTHR: Interactive TV hasn’t taken off yet. What are you going to do differently to make it popular?\n\nTellem: We’ve all tried to produce multiplatform programming, but the difficulty has been that you don’t have the technology to support it. This is where Microsoft and Xbox are in a unique position. The technology is there, not only for the audience that just wants to watch passively, but also for those who want to engage the content more, whether by mobile, tablet or on TV.\n\nTHR: Will you be able to attract major TV talent to make shows for a tech company?\n\nTellem: I certainly hope so. I know that before my arrival, they were able to attract a certain level of great talent. I invite everyone to come and listen to what we want to do. There’s a great playground we have here.\n\nTHR: What agents and talent have you spoken with so far?\n\nTellem: I’m somewhat overwhelmed by the interest, but I can’t say. It’s a little too early.\n\nTHR: Have you made any major hires yet?\n\nTellem: Not yet. We’re obviously taking advantage of all the existing people we have in Seattle, but at the same time we want to build a top-notch staff in L.A. for what will certainly be a full-fledged production studio.\n\nTHR: Why did you leave CBS?\n\nTellem: It’s probably the toughest decision I’ve made in my career. I’m very, very close to Leslie and close to all the executives there. We’re like a wonderful family. I just felt that I had done the job, and hopefully I did it well, and there were new challenges I wanted to take on. I wanted to be a little less comfortable, and I was always so intrigued with where television was going.\n\nTHR: What exactly did you do as an adviser to Moonves?\n\nTellem: I’ve always been interested in looking at the next generation of television. In the early days, I ran CBS.com before CBS acquired CNet, and I initiated the mobile strategy. So I’d try to embrace what’s on the horizon. I was also interested in the global production model, so I did a lot of that, going to places like India and exploring.\n\nTHR: Can you give me an example of a crisis at CBS when you were there and how you handled it?\n\nTellem: I don’t want to be specific, but there are situations where talent has personal issues and it’s like an athlete: Do you throw them out in the field if it hurts them but helps the team? Ultimately you have to think about the well-being of the talent. I guess I’m referring to the Charlie Sheen, Angus T. Jones type of situations. But among the executives, it should be a collaboration, and we should listen to different points of views to come to a conclusion we can live with while also protecting the show.\n\nTHR: How would you handle the controversy over Two and a Half Men star Jones’ plea for people to stop watching the show because it’s “filth”?\n\nTellem: I was just thinking this morning that it’s a good thing I’m not at CBS. Nina [Tassler, CBS Entertainment president] and Leslie and the Warner Bros. people are handling it appropriately. Who knows what motivates these things, but I think his apology was correct. We’re all blessed to be in this business.\n\nTHR: Is any part of traditional TV in jeopardy because of advancing technologies?\n\nTellem: It’s certainly disruptive. We always compared ourselves with the music industry and said we had to be much more nimble and accepting of change. The TV industry has done just that.\n\nTHR: How does the industry combat DVRs and ad-skipping?\n\nTellem: With VOD and embracing the whole concept of giving consumers their content where and when they want it. And there have been studies — and I do this also — where I watch the commercials because I forget I’m watching a recorded show. Ratings aren’t reflecting what’s really happening. It’s interesting, though, that when you download something, you end up watching the commercials, because you’ve made the decision to watch it free with ads instead of paying for it without ads. Because of that proposition and the intimate relationship people have with their computers and tablets and such, people are accepting commercials and watching them more.\n\nTHR: What was your favorite CBS show with which you were involved?\n\nTellem: Oh my God. You know, it’s like, as Leslie would always say, “They’re all our children.” But obviously, the things that made a huge difference in turning around that network were shows like CSIand Survivor and, my gosh, Everybody Loves Raymond.\n\nTHR: What do you like to watch now on TV?\n\nTellem: I’m quite enthralled with Game of Thrones. I’ve been watching Newsroom a lot on HBO. I love Homeland, of course, because everyone does, and Modern Family. I hate to admit it, but I agreed with most of the Emmy Awards this year. I love television. I spent the last 25 years in it, you know?\n\nTHR: Now that you’re at Microsoft, is there pressure to become a gamer?\n\nTellem: I love FIFA and I play Madden and golf games, and I think it’s due to the influence of my kids. I was aware of Halo, Call of Duty and the shooter games, but I didn’t play Halo until four days ago. It’s really amazing, but shooter games aren’t my cup of tea.\n\nTHR: Do you have a political problem with them?\n\nTellem: It’s funny. Like in television, we’re all fine with violence but not sex. The shooter games are much like procedural series, which I’ve never embraced. I don’t like blood.\n\nAnd that’s not all as Microsoft Names Longtime Technology Entrepreneur Blake Krikorian Corporate Vice President in Its Interactive Entertainment Business [Microsoft press release, Jan 10, 2013]\n\nProven innovator and leader in media and technology brings strong entertainment background to Xbox team.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. today announced the appointment of Blake Krikorian as corporate vice president for its Interactive Entertainment Business (IEB). Krikorian will report to Marc Whitten, chief product officer for IEB. This announcement follows the acquisition of Krikorian’s company, id8 Group R2 Studios (R2 Studios).\n\n“We are thrilled to have Blake join the Xbox team,” Whitten said. “He’s a proven innovator and well-respected leader in both the media and technology industries, having created simple, elegant products that have transformed the way people engage with and consume content. We look forward to his contribution to our team as Xbox continues to evolve and transform the games and entertainment landscape.”\n\n“I am excited to join Microsoft and be a part of the Xbox team. As a 10-year Xbox LIVE subscriber, I have seen firsthand how Xbox has delighted us by reinventing how consumers experience games and entertainment,” Krikorian said. “I look forward to helping the team define the future of entertainment and contribute to the next decade of continued innovation.”\n\nKrikorian most recently founded R2 Studios. Before that he served as the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Sling Media Inc., inventors of the Emmy® award-winning Slingbox®, which is now owned by EchoStar Corp. Krikorian served on the board of Amazon.com Inc. and also co-founded the Philips Mobile Computing Group where he co-led the team that created the award-winning Velo 1 handheld PC running Windows CE. He has received numerous lifetime achievement awards including the Lifetime Technology Leadership Award from Broadcasting & Cable, as well as the TechFellow Award for Disruptive Innovation from TechCrunch, Founders Fund and NEA.\n\nMicrosoft has acquired id8 Group R2 Studios [Neowin.net, Jan 10, 2013]\n\n… Microsoft apparently was the winner in the race to acquire R2 Studios with Google and Apple both reportedly also interested in buying the company. R2 Studios’ only product was a $99 Android app, R2 Control For Creston, which allows users to remotely control devices such as security systems, lighting and more on an Android smartphone or tablet.\n\nThis move could be a signal that Microsoft’s next version of the Xbox console will have some kind of expanded remote control features. The company has already launched Xbox SmartGlass apps for Windows 8, iOS and Android device owners for use as a “second screen” experience for some Xbox 360 games and media.\n\nR2 Android App Controls Crestron Systems [CrestronElectronics YouTube channel, Sept 23, 2010]\n\nBlake Krikorian of id8 Group shows off his new Android app, R2. Designed to work with the existing Crestron Mobile framework on the backend, R2 integrates and programs just like an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad.

Utilizing the R2 app and Crestron processors, customers can now control AV, lighting, thermostats, security systems, and thousands of other products via their Android device from anywhere in the world.\n\nR2 was initially unveiled at the Crestron booth at CEDIA Expo last September. Since then, R2 conducted a seven month private beta test program consisting of hundreds of residential, commercial and government Crestron-authorized integrators from around the world. The input from this beta team helped R2 achieve a sophisticated solution compatible with a multitude of Android devices.\n\nR2 was developed by id8 Group Productions, a product development and technology lab. Co-founder and inventor of Emmy award-winning Slingbox, Blake Krikorian founded id8 Group Holdings (parent company of id8 Group Productions) in 1999. R2 is the first product developed by id8 Group since Slingbox expanded in 2004 to form Sling Media®, Inc. Sling Media was subsequently acquired by Echostar Corporation in 2007.\n\n“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to collaborate with an innovator like Blake and officially support Android,” says Fred Bargetzi, Crestron VP of Technology. “The R2 control app for Android is the latest development in our ongoing open-standards platform which also includes integration with iOS, MAC OSX and Windows.”\n\nKrikorian initially conceived of R2 for his own use. “In addition to being able to control aspects of my home via Crestron remote controls and iOS devices, I really wanted to be able to use my new Android-based phone,” says Krikorian. “I desired a software platform that allowed me to further optimize the home control experience for general purpose smartphones and tablets, beyond the industry’s current state of the art. R2 and Android provides the flexibility to do just that.”\n\nR2 Key Features\n\nCommunicates with Crestron 2-Series and 3-Series™ control systems via WiFi and cellular network\n\nControls multiple systems/homes from one Android device\n\nUses the same Crestron development tools to create projects for R2.

The iPlayer is the promise to consumers, to audiences that we would make the unmissible truly unmissible. And so what does that mean: basically all the BBC output, everything on radio and television networks, is available from transmission points plus seven days on over 650 different devices. And so this is not a cherry pick of a variety of products for output, this is literally everything. So if you missed something you don’t have to record it because it’s already there. It’s a cloud based service that offers you catch up. [03:50]\n\nADDITIONAL INSERT BBC WiE: Daniel Danker on evolving the BBC iPlayer [TheBBCAcademy YouTube channel, Aug 9, 2012]\n\nDaniel Danker, general manger, BBC iPlayer, explains how the nation’s favourite catch-up service has evolved. http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/news/view/wie_iplayer\n\n- Android: An update [Dave Price, Head of BBC iPlayer on BBC Internet blog, Dec 12, 2012]: “Android as a platform is becoming increasingly complex and fragmented with a huge difference between video playback capabilities across the 1500+ Android devices.”\n\n- BBC has new competitors, warns iPlayer boss Daniel Danker [BBC Ariel, Feb 8, 2013]\n\nDaniel Danker, the general manager for on-demand and iPlayer, said that the BBC’s fiercest and most nimble competitors are no longer likely to be Sky, Channel 4 and ITV.\n\n‘I think we are measuring ourselves against the wrong competitors, because actually the companies that are most likely to be disruptive in what we do are Google through YouTube, Amazon through LoveFilm and Netflix,’ he told Ariel in an exclusive interview on Thursday.\n\n… Today, iPlayer reaches about 25% of the UK every month, he said, but YouTube reaches about 40%. …\n\n… American giant Netflix is leading the way by releasing its drama House of Cards online to its subscribers. It took a gamble by releasing the entire series, a remake of a BBC political drama from 1990, immediately.\n\nDanker, an Israeli-born American who spent 11 years at Microsoft, said the series is ‘pretty good’ and has attracted big names, including Kevin Spacey. He called Netflix ‘innovative and nimble’. …\n\n… The iPlayer manager said that in YouTube’s Soho offices, artists and content creators are being asked to ‘professionalise their content’ at specially built studios. He predicted that it won’t be ‘skateboarding chimpanzees’ for much longer, but high-quality content. …\n\n[~12:00] “I don’t believe that the industry’s ready for pure a’la cart [where you only pay for the channels you want]“, he stated and suggested that this would be a great opportunity to create offers that provide users with greater flexibility. “I believe there’s value in bundles, I believe that is a form of curation” he concluded.\n\n[~ 13:30] “This thing looks like a leap in time of 10-20 years compared to what you have today. That is much more personal, that learns about you, that actually cares about who you are.”\n\n[~14:00] “We think there’s real value in the ability to actually identify the various users. Today, television doesn’t really know anything about you. It’s the same television service for everyone in the household. In order to actually recognise who is there and to offer you your personal experience, rather than having to log in or put your fingerprint or do a retina scan whatever, to make it completely seamless you need a camera. If you don’t like the idea of a camera, you think it’s creepy there is a nice little shutter and you just close the camera” Huggers said.\n\n[~19:00-20:00] “Intel is very interested in getting into consumer businesses, having a direct relationship with those consumers. Intel as a company is making a big shift towards, what Intel calls, becoming an experience driven company.”\n\n[~22:00] “We have gone out of our way to bring a completely new class, new type of skill sets into this crew. And we’ve set the group up in such a way that it is run in its own building, complete own building, with our own security, we have our own culture. We are still proud to be part of Intel, don’t make any mistakes, but this is a new effort.”\n\n[~25:00] “It’s not a value play, it’s a quality play where we’ll create a superior experience for the end user.”\n\n[~35:00] “The model that we are envisioning is a model where live TV and catch up TV all live in the same paradigm. These are not different applications, and so if you’re a programmer why would you want your catch up programs to live in an app somewhere else? Why doesn’t that live under your brand?”\n\nVideo – Dive Into Media:\n\nIntel’s Erik Huggers on What’s Next for Web TV - WSJ.com [Feb 12, 2013]\n\nIntel’s Erik Huggers took the stage with Walt Mossberg at D: Dive Into Media on Tuesday [Feb 12, 2013] to talk about the company’s forthcoming TV device that he describes as revolutionary.\n\nMy transcript (lead reporter is Walt Mossberg, his second in command is Peter Kafka):\n\n[00:38] We have been working for about a year now to set up a new group called Intel Media. It’s a completely new division with new people, sort of a mix of existing Intel people with a lot of people from outside the company. To give you an example we hired people from Apple, from Jawbone, from Microsoft, from the BBC, and the list goes on, even Netflix and Google. So it’s a new group focused on developing an Internet TV platform.\n\nThere’s no other Internet TV platfom?\n\nThere’s quite a few out there but my opinion is that not many have yet actually cracked it, not many have truly delivered.\n\nHave any cracked it in your opinion?\n\nNo, actually. That’s my opinion.\n\nJust to be clear. You are talking about becoming a pay TV service to deliver video over the web like instead of paying cable company for video I will pay you.\n\nThat’s right. And so for the first time what we will do we will actually deliver a couple things to consumers. We will deliver a new consumer electronics product that consumers will buy directly from us or through retail under a new brand. This is obviously associated with Intel brand. [01:56]\n\n[02:12] It is an Intel powered device, it is a consumer electronics product with beautiful industrial design powered by, obviously, an Intel chip. That’s not where it ends, it’s not just the device. Where it really gets interesting is, we are working with the entire industry to figure out how do we get proper TV delivered via the Internet to consumers.\n\nThis is an over the top service where we will deliver both live television, broadcasts, cable nets and other output, but also have catch up TV and introduce that properly to this market Because I personally think catch up TV still really doesn’t exist here, not as it exists in Europe today. And will have on demand and a host of applications. [02:57]\n\n[03:08] At the BBC we launched the product in 2007 called BBC iPlayer. The iPlayer is the promise to consumers, to audiences that we would make the unmissible truly unmissible. And so what does that mean: basically all the BBC output, everything on radio and television networks, is available from transmission points plus seven days on over 650 different devices. And so this is not a cherry pick of a variety of products for output, this is literally everything. So if you missed something you don’t have to record it because it’s already there. It’s a cloud based service that offers you catch up. [03:50]\n\nIn the UK with the BBC what happened was that iPlayer became sort of synonymous with on demand. Just like Xerox is copying and Kleenex is tissues. So I think that in this market we have yet to see a proper catch up TV service, like the one that I just described. [04:09]\n\n…\n\n[04:45] When you say proper TV, I was struck by the term of that, I like that, proper TV, because you are talking about what I get through my cable box. And this is the key, because I have a Roku, I have an Apple TV on my big television at home. They give me a lot of interesting things but they don’t get me cable. … the cable box right up to pay a lot of money to the cable company and the effect of three things. You tell me you’re going to be one thing that would do almost three things?\n\nOur ultimate vision is you need one …\n\nUltimate vision? That means …\n\nUltimately we think there is an all in one solution. … Rome wasn’t built in a day. It takes time sometimes but where we will start, to be clear, is: we will have live TV, catch up TV, consistent. We will have on demand and we’ll have a set of applications. But the proper TV piece is something that I want to just pause for a second. Why do I say that?\n\n[05:57] I think that what we’ve seen so far in the industry are sort of … it’s like the interface is that you have to date on all these variety of television connected devices [the so called smart TVs] they all look like Web pages from the 1990s blown up to ten foot. … They’re pretty clumsy to use, they are hard to use and … When I say proper TV the other thing I think about is I think about when my five year old came to me over the weekend literally, and he is — like probably every other five year old — a wizard with iPads and Android devices, he is completely self sufficient. Yet he comes to me on Saturday morning and gives me two remote controls and says ‘Daddy can you please put up …’ some PBS stuff, I forgot what it was, because he literally doesn’t know how to use it. It is impossible. [06:56]\n\n[07:53] So are you doing something different or are you going to do what I am already getting?\n\nWe are going to do a lot of things different.\n\nFirst of all, in the pay TV space today what you get from experience perspective is, let’s talk about the EPG (electronic program guide) for just a second. EPG today is equivalent to a spreadsheet, it’s basically columns and columns and rows and rows, and you have to go through and through and through it, until you’re blue in the face. It is not very friendly, it is not very easy to use, and it is sort of feels like, it reminds me of my days of my first computer, the Commodore 64. There’s a lot of room for improvement there. If you look at what people are used to today on iPads, on iPhones, on Apple TVs and other devices out there, there is a massive gap. So I think that’s one, the incredible user experience that is completely easy to use. [We have] the people that we brought over from the UK, the people that did the iPlayer UI. So we’ve got a team that really know how to do this sort of stuff.\n\n[8:00] The second thing is that we’ll have a scenario where you don’t need a lot of different inputs anymore. You do not need to have all these different HDMI inputs. Today in my home I had to buy an HDMI switch because I have too many devices. [09:22]\n\n[10:15] The bundle thing that Peter [Kafka] mentioned is really really important. It’s a piece of the puzzle. There’s loads of people who deeply resent their cable and satellite company, for a number of reasons, but one of them is this bundle. I have to buy all these channels, I don’t watch all these channels, I don’t want all these channels. … You are going to revolutionize TV, you are going to bring us this box, but a minute ago I heard you say you’re still going to have these bundles. Is that right?\n\n[11:17] I agree with you that what consumers want is choice, control and convenience. I do believe that there is value in bundles actually. The whole world talks about curation because there’s such a mass of information out there. In a way if bundles are done right, bundles are bundled right, for the lack of a better way to explain it, then there’s real value in that. … I think there are opportunities out there to create a much more flexible environment where the end user has more control than what they have today. I don’t believe that the industry’s ready for pure a’la cart. [11:56]\n\n[12:19] All I’m talking about … is the fact that I believe there’s value in bundles. I believe that is a form of curation. [12:27] … it’s somewhere in the middle [between current bundles and pure a'la cart] [12:34]\n\nSo it’s still bundles, but more intelligent bundles, or smaller bundles …\n\nThat’s a great way to explain things.\n\n… things that are more logical to me as a consumer?\n\nAs a consumer.\n\nI may be so glad to not see the bundle Comcast makes me buy that I’ll say these guys at least giving me a better set of choices\n\nThat’s the hope.\n\nIt’s not a pure a’la cart but at least a better set of choices\n\nIt’s way towards more control, more choice for audience. [13:00]\n\nAre we going to save money?\n\nWhat this is not about for sure, it’s not about a value play. … What I believe is that if you get a vastly superior experience where the delta literally, when you get to see it ready to show you, this thing looks like a leap in time of 10-20 years compared to what you have today. That is much more personal, that learns about you, that actually cares about who you are versus being just … [13:40]\n\nThe boxes would be a caring box?\n\nWe hope so. …\n\n… There is a less positive way to spin that caring box, this is the box that watches what you are watching, and targets you with advertising …\n\nWe think there is real value in the ability to actually identify the various users. Today TV doesn’t really know anything about you. It’s the same TV service for everyone in the household.\n\n… little creepiness here?\n\nI don’t think so because one of the features we put on there is, in order to actually recognize who is there and to offer you your personal experience, rather than having to log in or put on your fingerprint or do a retina scan whatever, to make it completely seamless, you need a camera, but if you don’t like the idea of a camera, you think it’s creepy there is a nice little shutter and you just close the camera and off your uncle. [15:00]\n\n… But cameras in iPads [etc.] are for those people to turn them on if they want to have a chatter, to take pictures something with it. It’s not looking at them for the purpose of serving up ads based on them. …\n\n[15:58] But there is value. Let me talk about the value of a camera if we have to explain that. Imagine a scenario where you are watching your favorite TV show whenever that may be. … The idea of television back when I grow at least was that it was truly a social experience, a family experience. You’re together in the living room. What if you could actually watch that episode completely synchronized across the country and have a real social experience.\n\n… but we are talking about the camera watching you for the purpose of targeting, and that’s not the same as voluntarily Peter and I turning on the camera\n\n[17:02] I didn’t talk about that we will use the camera for targeting. What I’ve talked about … it’s gonna watch you because: imagine the following scenario … I’ll give you another example. I have a Netflix account, and my five and nine year old will use that Netflix account all the time. When its my time to use that Netflix account with my wife the recommendations that I get are usually cartoons. They are not relevant to me because it’s a household account versus a personal account. That sort of the enviropnment is the living room. But if I can just … Want your kids a separate account. I’m cheap I am Dutch. … If you have the ability to actually distinguish that it’s you or Peter, or me or the kids, or me and the kids, then you can create an environment where you can recommend me ads actually relevant for you.\n\n[18:14] Why is Intel getting into the consumer business?\n\nOver the weekend I visited the Intel museum for the first time. … Tjere was a quote on the wall that actually stuck with me. One of our founders, Robert Noyce, he said, apparently, don’t be encumbered by past history. You go off and do something wonderful. So that’s what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to get closer to the end user. We understand that the end user audiences have a much bigger control these days over the direction of travel.\n\n[18:56] When you use the term end user then you’re not all the way there yet?\n\nAudiences, audiences … We talk about one thing. Back of our card, of the Intel Media card, it says: the audience is at the heart of everything we do. So we really care about audiences.\n\n[19:32] Is it just because Robert Noyce said … or is it because Intel’s principal business making chips for PCs has been flat or down in recent years?\n\nIntel is very interested in getting into consumer businesses, having a direct relationship with those consumers. Intel as a company is making a big shift towards, what Intel calls, becoming an experience driven company. So if you think about it what better way to learn what experience driven is all about than through digital media, through a service that directly relates to audiences, that directly delivers experiences to audiences. [20:16]\n\n…. [Will the coming CEO sign off for that as well?] …\n\n[20:40] Intel Media is governed by a small board, some of the most senior people at Intel. While our CEO is certainly a very important proponent of what we’re doing here with Intel Media there is a very broad support for …\n\n[20:58] Why are you going to be better at having that kind of resonance with the consumer than big companies that happened to have a lot of consumer wealth already? Apple, Microsoft … Google. These are not companies that have to come from someplace different. They are right there in the consumer space. Look at this room and look at the logos of the devices, and they don’t say Intel. Intel somewhere in the device but … The point is what makes you thinking to compete with these guys?\n\nIn the end of the day all comes down to people … people, people, people. I spent the last twelve months putting together an incredible leadership team. We have a lady from Apple who’s been there for literally twelve years. She launched most of their iProducts. She’s our head of marketing. We have a gentleman from Jawbone who put Jawbone, the Bluetooth company, in twenty thousand retail outlets around the world. We have a gentleman from Microsoft who built the Mediaroom platform that AT&T U-verse runs on. The list goes on and on. We have gone out of our way to bring a completely new class, new type of skill sets into this crew. And we’ve set the group up in such a way that it is run in its own building, complete own building, with our own security, we have our own culture. We are still proud to be part of Intel, don’t make any mistakes, but this is a new effort. [22:43]\n\nIn many ways I sort of compare it with … when I’m [going] back in the day when I was at Microsoft, many years ago, there was this moment when Microsoft indeed got into the gaming console business, and a lot of people said what are they doing, you make enterprise software you don’t know anything about this space. Yet ten years later or maybe more it’s the enormous success … [23:10]\n\n[23:26] Why do you think no one else [from those already consumer companies] has stepped forward [in the TV space] so far?\n\nI don’t know frankly. It’s hard to tell. I mean those companies [already in the consumer space and trying] should speak for themselves.\n\n[24:16] We’ve taken the leap of faith that time is here. I mean broadband capability is here, it works. Compression of video is completely changing landscapes again. I mean we are moving to a new codec HEVC [H.265] which again compresses fifty percent better than H.264. So the ability to deliver super high quality video via the Internet live and on demand is here today. We have the silicon and the software, and the knowledge and the know how to create an incredible product with an incredible UI, with a new user paradigm. Rather than wait for others to jump into that market and see it take off we’re jumping in, and we’re going to try and make … [24:57]\n\n[25:22] But it’s not a value play, this is not a kind of cutting our cable bill\n\nIt is not a value play, it is a quality play. It is a play where we will create a superior experience for the end user.\n\n…\n\n[30:57] You’ve got all these connected devices already. Why just not build apps for them?\n\nWhen we started the discussion we talked about the fact that I built this thing called iPlayer in the UK. We made that service available to over 650 different devices. Everything from phones to tablets, to game consoles, to smart TVs, to Blueray … literally anything that plays back audio and video as I play on it. … It’s fair to say that with the experience that we’ve had over there in the UK, this is definitely a direction that we’re going to follow with this as well.\n\nWhy build the device it’s an excellent question. I happen to believe that if we want to deliver the experience that we have in mind for the living room there is no platform out there today where we can do that. In order to deliver on our vision of that new experience you need to control everything, you need to control the chip, you need to control the operating system, you need to control the app players, you need to control the sensors etc. That sort of the reason why we were there. If there were platforms out there where we could deliver exactly what we have in mind there wouldn’t be a need to do it but there isn’t. [32:15]\n\n[32:30] At the end of the day I believe in the world where you have a good, better, [and] best experience. The best experience that we have in mind. We will deliver on that device that we will ship and sell to audiences.\n\n[32:55] The programmers are taking billions and billions of dollars from the cable companies. What incentive do they have to unbundle and work in different ways? No matter how beautiful your devices are going to be, what incentive do they have to break their established business models and give you some of their content, no matter how much are they getting paid for?\n\n[33:12] First of all I didn’t say that we will unbundle. What I said we will create new bundles. … But your question is a very valid question.\n\nLet’s take a look at history. We went from over the air television to cable TV, to satellite TV, to telco driven television. Constantly there were new forms of distribution out there. For programmers to get new distribution is a good thing in the end of the day. So I believe that this is just another step in the evolution of distribution. The internet has finally got to a point where you can deliver a true television experience where channel zapping becomes the same experience that we lost twenty years ago when we went digital. In the analog days when you zap to channel it was instant. In today’s digital world if you zap a channel you have 2-3 seconds of nothing in your waiting. We can bring an incredible TV experience via the Internet to consumers, and that is a real opportunity for programmers.\n\nThe final thing I would say is that the model that we are envisioning is a model where live TV and catch up TV all live in the same paradigm. These are not different applications, and so if you’re a programmer why would you want your catch up programs to live in an app somewhere else? Why doesn’t that live under your brand? If you were an NBC or something like that, why do I need to go to the service provider catch up service to find the NBC programs when actually I wanted to find it through … [34:58]\n\n[35:14] The ability to wirelessly beam things from these devices to your TV, which Apple brands AirPlay and other companies have something like it, but I think Apple’s is the only one that’s really taken off and a lot people use so far, is that can be a feature of what you do? Wireless beaming from my other devices?\n\nThis is certainly something that we’re looking for sure. It is an important use case where consumers have obviously a multitude of media capable devices, whether it’s photos, audio or video. The ability to display that on another screen a certain something I’m of intense interest.\n\nHistorical evidence\n\nInsight: Intel’s plans for virtual TV come into focus [Reuters, June 8, 2012]\n\nIntel is counting on facial-recognition technology for targeted ads and a team of veteran entertainment dealmakers to win over reluctant media partners for its new virtual television service\n\nBut so far it’s proving a challenge to get the service off the ground, thanks to an unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let Intel unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay.\n\nIntel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has kept its strategy to launch a slimmed down cable TV service under wraps as the tech giant risks getting into a completely new line of business.\n\nAccording to five sources who have been negotiating with Intel for months, the company is emphasizing a set-top box employing Intel technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising.\n\nThe set-top box pitched by Intel doesn’t identify specific people, but it could provide general data about viewers’ gender or whether they’re adults or children to help target advertising, two sources said.\n\nIntel’s plans put it in the middle of Silicon Valley’s battle for the living room. Heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Google believe the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem – dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc. – is ripe for disruption for reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to ever-increasing programming costs.\n\nWhile none of these companies have so far been able to make major inroads, Intel thinks it can build a better set-top box and over-the-top subscription service to deliver TV content to consumers, even though the initiative catapults it into virgin market territory. A successful TV service showcasing Intel technology could be a big step toward making its chips prevalent in more living room devices.\n\n“If they can create a virtual network and it incorporates proprietary Intel technology, they could certainly bring something different to the subscription TV model.” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna.\n\nIntel’s offering aims to exploit one of the TV industry’s major issues: the reliability, or lack thereof, of Nielsen ratings data on audiences. Nielsen has long been the dominant provider of TV ratings, but the accuracy of its data has come under attack by some network programmers, who argue that its polling system of 50,000 homes is antiquated for the digital age.\n\nFor its part, Intel claims that the new interactive features in its set-top box would add greater value to TV advertising and help offset reduced revenue from licensing fees for network owners.\n\n“They’ve told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money. But it’s just a little unproven,” said one executive who has been involved in the talks.\n\nAn Intel representative declined to comment for this story.\n\nChip features making it easier for Hollywood studios to protect content streamed to computers, as well as tools for detecting faces and analyzing audiences, are examples of current proprietary technology that Intel would like to see widely adopted.\n\nBEYOND PCs\n\nWhile Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs, its chips have not achieved a significant presence in smartphones, tablets and other interconnected devices. Intel executives say they are eager to make sure its semiconductors play major roles in new markets with big growth potential.\n\nAccording to a company source, ensuring that its chips become prevalent in home entertainment devices would be the driving reason behind any Internet TV service it launches.\n\nComcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smarpthones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers — which typically also use Intel chips.\n\nIntel last year wound down a push to make chips specifically for “smart” TVs after Google TV, which it had backed, failed to make a major splash with consumers.\n\nAt the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group with a mandate of promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms.\n\nAccording to sources, Intel is proposing to media companies a service could include both a bundle of TV channels similar to a normal cable package and an on-demand component.\n\nENLISTING HEAVYWEIGHTS\n\nIntel is intent on launching its video service before the end of the year, sources said. Original plans called for it to be launched by November, said one of the sources, but that deadline likely will not be met.\n\nThe biggest problem Intel faces is its inability to reach deals with major content providers, which are reluctant to license their networks and TV shows at rates that could undercut their larger established cable and satellite partners.\n\nIntel wants to keep its costs down by licensing smaller packages of TV networks instead of replicating the basic cable TV bundle of more than 100 channels. But network owners won’t agree to smaller bundles without being paid a premium for the channels they choose to license.\n\n“Why would I want you to take subscribers away from another distributor at a lower price?,” asked the same media executive who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nTo change that mindset, Intel has assembled a team of television industry veterans well-schooled in negotiating distribution deals. Leading the group as head of Intel Media is Erik Huggers, who worked on media at Microsoft before going to the BBC. Huggers enlisted as an adviser Garth Ancier, who most recently served as president for BBC Worldwide America and before that worked at NBC, FOX, and Disney.\n\nIn addition to Huggers and Ancier, sources said, two other names prominent in TV circles have emerged as consultants for Intel: entertainment lawyer Ken Ziffren and former MTV executive Nicole Browning.\n\nBrowning, who previously negotiated on the other side of the table for MTV, has been handling some of the talks with partners, sources said.\n\nZiffren built his reputation representing Hollywood talent – he was instrumental in negotiating the deal that returned the “Tonight Show” to Jay Leno. Lesser known is his firm’s work negotiating deals for DirecTV’s video-on-demand service and carriage agreements for pay-TV network Starz.\n\nBut even that quarte"
