        "text": "One sunny afternoon 14 years ago, I went up to visit the product designer Yves Béhar at his weekend place on the Northern California coast. The house, which Béhar still owns, sits atop a bluff; from a patch of lawn you can watch the Pacific surf coming in below, as we did that day, one perfect set after another. Béhar, who turned 40 that year, kept one eye on the waves as we sipped beers and talked about his latest projects. He is a guy who in many ways seems most comfortable in a wetsuit—a Swiss-born adopter of California’s national pastime, which he has taken up with a convert’s zeal. In conversation, Béhar melds European formality with Golden State cool, a duality mirrored in his elegantly exuberant work, which has run the gamut from tech devices to office furniture to electric motorcycles to remote-controlled crystal chandeliers to prefab houses.\n\nAs we sat and watched the crashing waves, a trio of school-age neighborhood kids ambled into the yard. They were drawn to a peculiar green-and-white object Béhar held in his hands. It was the XO Laptop, one of his recent designs and the centerpiece of the One Laptop Per Child program instigated by Nicholas Negroponte at MIT’s Media Lab, a massive initiative to bring educational technology to kids in the developing world. The device was achieving fame as the “$100 laptop,” based on its projected (and ultimately elusive) price point; the New York Times called it “the laptop that will save the world.” With its Lilliputian seven-and-a-half-inch screen, twin earlike Wi-Fi antennas, rounded edges, and robust slate of games and activities, the XO reminded me of something that might have sprung from the imaginations of Sid and Marty Krofft. Béhar—who, with his tousle of blond hair, resembles Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s Little Prince (the hero of a book that enchanted him as a boy)—handed the little machine to the three kids. They toggled through its features with frequent exclamations of “whoa!,” making it clear that this laptop was as kid-friendly as it was serious: an innovative, perhaps even revolutionary object you couldn’t keep your hands off of.\n\nBéhar will turn 54 in May. He has made a career out of designs that are as irresistible as they are visionary, and which have the power to ripple through entire product categories or to create new ones altogether. The One Laptop Per Child, or OLPC, helped drive the emergence of low-price laptops for educational purposes, the category that includes Chromebooks and the like. It also drove Béhar’s reputation, making him the most high-profile product designer in America, along with Apple’s former chief design officer, Jony Ive. (Béhar’s Jawbone Bluetooth earpiece was sold alongside the original iPhone.)\n\nLike Ive, Béhar’s work is virtually synonymous with Silicon Valley. Unlike Ive, Béhar has never professed in-house fealty to a corporate patron. Since founding his trailblazing San Francisco design studio, Fuseproject, in 1999, Béhar has taken on clients from all over: Nike, Herman Miller, Birkenstock, Mini Cooper, Movado, Nivea, L’Oréal, Swarovski, Puma, Kodak, Samsung, on and on. (In 2014, Béhar sold 75 percent of Fuseproject for a reported $46.7 million to the Chinese conglomerate BlueFocus; it took full ownership in 2017, with Béhar as CEO.) He is a pioneer of “venture design,” a business model in which designers partner with start-ups, bypassing traditional payment structures for equity; it has meant more creativity, commitment, and culpability—along with an enhanced risk of failure. He has executed projects of every scale and type, commercial and civic; the New York City Department of Health, for instance, hired him to design condom dispensers and the official condoms they would dispense. There’s no way to reduce Béhar to a trademark style, as you might do with Ive, who cannily applied Bauhaus principles to iPods, iPhones, and MacBooks. (In 2019, Ive left Apple to found the firm LoveFrom with another design superstar, Marc Newson.) “Style doesn’t interest me,” Béhar once told me. Yet each of his projects, from the Leaf desk lamp for Herman Miller to the Jambox Bluetooth speaker to JimmyJane vibrators, bears a Béharian thumbprint—surprising, colorful, and beguiling, with envelope-pushing three-dimensional form and fluidity, not so much modernistic as futuristic, even utopian.\n\nThis past winter, I caught up with Béhar, who was spending the season with his family at a house in the Lake Tahoe ski region. “I still like to play some of the games on that,” he said of the XO Laptop, reminiscing over the phone about that afternoon in 2007. I had seen Béhar periodically in the years since, but it was hard not to think about the interval between then and now: an economic meltdown, an unabated climate crisis, political dysfunction, a reckoning with systemic racism, and a pandemic that made it impossible for us to meet in person, as we had in the past, in San Francisco, Milan, New York, or Miami, when the designer was accustomed to constant motion. There was, too, the fact that the OLPC Foundation had disbanded in 2014, falling short of its goal of blanketing the world with XO Laptops and triggering criticism about the wisdom of applying first-world tech solutions to developing-world problems. Even so, the device did ship to three and a half million children. From the vantage point of 2021, with the migration of classrooms to Zoom, the XO looks downright prescient. In fact, it still looks like a vision of the future.\n\nSuch visions abound in the whopping monograph Yves Béhar: Designing Ideas, out this spring from Thames & Hudson. It’s a 350-plus-page wonder cabinet crammed with every kind of project, product, initiative, and environment imaginable. You can read it not only as a timeline of Béhar and his two decades with Fuseproject, but of 21st-century design in general, with its preoccupations laid out page by page, from tech to lifestyle to sustainability. The book is unusually conversational (the text is, in fact, a dialogue-like collaboration with the journalist Adam Fisher), an amiable and frank journey into the twists and turns of the design process that provides rare insight into what it takes to create a seltzer machine (SodaStream) or an electric motorbike (Mission One, for Mission Motors, which set land-speed records) or sustainable packaging (the Clever Little Bag for Puma sneakers) or a robotic bassinet (the Snoo, a recent collaboration with the pediatrician and best-selling author Harvey Karp) and bring it to the market.\n\nAs a career retrospective, the publication is well-timed. Béhar, after all, is no longer an upstart maverick or radiant idol. He has endured failures, even something of a backlash from the design press, and may be entering the most crucial—and perhaps consequential—phase of his career. In the midst of a global coronavirus shutdown and its attendant doubts, Béhar insisted that his utopic vision remains undimmed. When I asked about his ongoing high-wire act of designing for a future that, by definition, isn’t here yet, he deployed a quote from Pippi Longstocking, one that could be a personal motto: “I have never tried that before,” he said, savoring the epigrammatic ring of it, “so I think I should definitely be able to do that.”\n\nWhen they’re not hunkered down in Tahoe or at their weekend place on the coast, Béhar and his wife, Sabrina Buell, live on a steeply inclined street in the Cow Hollow district in San Francisco; their house is a minimalist jewel set amid the rows of fanciful Victorian structures, with views of the bay. It’s been featured in Architectural Digest and in Vogue, which said it “may be the highest-tech house in San Francisco.” The energetic Buell—her father is a developer, her mother is a Mondavi, and her stepmother cofounded the brands Esprit and The North Face—is in her mid-40s. She is a leading West Coast art consultant, one half of the advisory firm Zlot Buell. Their house is dotted with the work of contemporary artists. Robert Longo and Barry McGee are among their favorites; last year, just before the pandemic, Béhar made a pilgrimage to James Turrell’s colossal land-art project Roden Crater, in Arizona. Between Buell’s social and art-world connections and Béhar’s dual immersion in design and tech, they are an indelibly glamorous, if low-key, Bay Area power couple. During the 2016 campaign, they cohosted an event for Hillary Clinton.\n\n“Family was always important and grounding for him,” Medda said. For all of the couple’s success, the focus does not stray far from their four children, whom Béhar is known to bounce design ideas off. (The oldest, age 13, is from Béhar’s previous relationship.) He remains close to his parents, who still live in Lausanne, the city on Lac Léman, in Switzerland, where Béhar grew up with two younger brothers. His father, Henry, is a career philatelist, with a small shop dealing in stamps. Antique postage and letters fascinated the young Yves; their intricate designs held human stories: a lesson internalized. His father’s family are Sephardic Jews who, through the centuries, migrated from Spain to Venice to Istanbul, where Henry was raised. Béhar remembers family gatherings where Ladino was still spoken. His mother, Christine, is a translator from Pomerania, a region that straddles Poland and the old East Germany. At age 17 she escaped to the West, eventually finding her way to London, where, in a scenario out of Antonioni’s Blow-Up, she met Henry in a nightclub in 1966. The couple moved to Lausanne. Yves was born in 1967.\n\nThe young Béhar immersed himself in science fiction and fantasy, absorbing the illustrations in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and writing his own stories. “I tended to live in alternate worlds,” he said. In his teens, Yves began sewing his own clothes, making eight-millimeter movies, and taking photographs. He acquired a workbench and started banging together furniture and contraptions, such as a jury-rigged ski-and-sail apparatus that allowed him to cruise across icy Swiss lakes—“freezing my ass off and going at dangerous crazy speeds,” he said. He gravitated toward punk, loving the humor of it (“I remember laughing as much as grooving to the Dead Kennedys,” he said) but even more the movement’s DIY spirit—you could experiment, explore, make a mess. “It gives us permission to fail and try again,” he said, “without being an expert.” Béhar showed me a photograph of his teen self amid the sweaty crowd at a punk show at La Dolce Vita, a club in Lausanne; he’s easily discernible in the profusion of faces: the blond tousle, the intent, inquisitive expression.\n\nThe young Béhar yearned to escape Switzerland. “It was a small place,” he said, “and people were not as open to new ideas and new constructs.” His parents weren’t enthusiastic when he announced that he wanted to become an industrial designer, but they allowed him to enroll at the Swiss branch of the Art Center College of Design; in 1990, he transferred to the main campus, in Pasadena. In Southern California, his French accent made him feel like a goober, “fresh off the boat,” so he got rid of it. (Today, there’s a subtle trace of transatlanticism in his plain, general american-accented speech.) In Pasadena, he met artists such as Longo and Keith Haring, designers such as Luigi Colani and Victor Papanek; he fell for the outlandish futurisms of Syd Mead (who designed the movie Blade Runner), the utopianism of Buckminster Fuller, and the everyday good design of Charles and Ray Eames, whose total studio approach—an interdisciplinary mix of furniture, graphics, architecture, photography, filmmaking—was arguably the biggest influence of all.\n\nBy 1992, Béhar had moved to San Francisco. It was a time when young graduates flocked to the Bay Area to make art, start bands, wait tables, and slack. For the young Swiss, anything-goes San Francisco was a revelation. “It was a mind bend for me,” he said. “It was so antithetical to the culture I had grown up in.” He lived in the Tenderloin and swung through a series of gigs (“It was survival time”), most notably at the Silicon Valley-based Lunar Design and at Hartmut Esslinger’s Frog Design, the firm responsible for developing the so-called Snow White design language for Apple computers in the 1980s. In terms of learning how design and tech might work together, he could not have landed at a better shop.\n\nYet Frog Design, Béhar concluded, “seemed counter to the idea of design as an integrated experience”—the Eames dream. After a short-lived partnership with the designer Thomas Meyerhoffer, he established Fuseproject in 1999: “a studio that would fuse the disciplines of design at the service of an idea.” Integration would come before specialization, ideas before products. Béhar also had another fusion in mind: European design and California tech. “I started to understand how technology was going to affect every contemporary human experience,” he said, seeing this as a hinge moment in history, one that could benefit from the humanizing influence of design. (Fuseproject now has more than 75 employees and is based in a graffiti-art-covered building in Potrero Hill.)\n\nAt the time, Béhar said, European friends and designers looked upon his project with skepticism. America was seen as a design backwater; the era of the Eameses, George Nelson, Eliot Noyes, and Raymond Loewy was long past; advertising and marketing had taken over. Computers and tech gadgets didn’t need design; they were just what they were. “There was more packaging than design,” Béhar recalled, “meaning wrapping pretty skins around boxes.” The big game was furniture and home goods, centered around legacy Italian manufacturers—Cassina, Cappellini, Kartell, and Alessi. Curiously, some of Fuseproject’s important early clients were from non-tech companies, who were fascinated by Béhar’s tech-design background and his ability to create complex, expressive forms. He designed a provocatively swaying shampoo bottle, of all things, that in 2001 won laurels from the design magazine I.D. “Suddenly,” Béhar said, “we were on the map.”\n\nBéhar’s bold optimism was apparent to all; his good looks and surfer mien did wonders in uptight boardrooms. “There was nothing dark about Yves—ever,” Medda said of her impressions of Béhar as he ascended to star status and became a presence at design fairs and in the pages of design and lifestyle magazines. “He had these incredible crystal-blue eyes. He looked like an angel who fell from heaven.” And so Béhar became the face of resurgent industrial design in the aughts, a proselytizer for a new golden age. He predicted that companies unwilling to revivify their design DNA would be “left in the dust by companies that do.”\n\n“I started to take some of what I had learned about technology and how to integrate technology in products, and apply it in areas that hadn’t seen it,” he said, an early example being his 2003 Birkenstock prototype Learning Shoe, recyclable footwear with embedded computer chips that would allow the company to improve and customize the product based on the wearer’s usage habits. Fuseproject was well situated and conceived to feed off the utopianism, disruption, and sheer money spout of Silicon Valley, and Béhar became a default designer for innovations. But it would be incorrect to assume he’s a Silicon Valley cheerleader. Béhar has positioned himself as a skeptical conscience, using his perch to frame moral imperatives and articulate humanistic positions. He has excoriated social media for trapping users in “echo chambers and emotional deserts” and insisted that designers work “in such a way that we don’t become emotionally addicted to what we create.” Béhar was hired to design equipment for Elizabeth Holmes’s blood-testing start-up, Theranos; when the company’s problems came to light he labeled the enterprise a “fraud,” an unsavory example of Silicon Valley’s rampant “hubris.” He sees artificial intelligence as a huge opportunity, but argues that its most meaningful application “will touch those with greater needs and lack of access”—in other words, it should be used to bridge the digital divide, not widen it by merely providing distractions for the well off.\n\nBéhar’s projects can feel like inquiries into what is possible, scouting missions into the next chapter of our existence, test flights into the unknown. The speculative, futuristic nature of his work is high-risk. “Certainty is not the way we engage in the world as designers,” he said. Inevitably there have been fails. In 2014, Stephen Colbert mocked a Béhar-designed smart cup on air: “There’s so many times when Vessyl’s beverage-identifying technology will come in handy, like when you order a Coke but it tastes kind of like a Diet Coke but you’re not sure.” A $700 Wi-Fi-enabled juicer was lambasted as a useless, expensive gewgaw (Oprah Winfrey allegedly bought 365 of them for gifts), the kind of overwrought innovation that went against Béhar’s own dictum, “Good design removes complexity from life.” A 2018 takedown piece in Fast Company derided Béhar’s “oversaturated celebrity.” The contrarian stance was surprising, given that magazine’s role in boosting Béhar’s name recognition with years of glowing coverage. Béhar might be a tall poppy at design fairs, but compared to luminaries in adjacent fields, such as Elon Musk, Frank Gehry, Philippe Starck, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, his celebrity is of fairly modest wattage.\n\nWhen I alluded to the blowback, Béhar sidestepped the subject with laid-back equanimity. But he did make an observation that harkened back to his punk days. “At this stage, maybe I am an expert at the process of design,” he said, “meaning being okay with things not working out.” The notion runs throughout Yves Béhar: Designing Ideas, which, at times, is reminiscent of Moss Hart’s classic theater memoir, Act One, in which Hart tells the excruciatingly Byzantine story of getting a play to the stage. In his book, Béhar made sure to include, even highlight, failures, flops, and screwups. “The pretty picture at the end,” he said, “doesn’t mean that much if you haven’t understood the full arc of the struggle that it takes to bring a new experience to the world.”\n\nIf the measure of success, as implied by some of the critiques leveled at Béhar, is inventing the iPhone or achieving unicorn status or, to go back to the greatest hits of American design, coming up with the first molded-fiberglass chair, then that’s a very high bar. Charles Eames was in his 40s when he and his wife, Ray, unveiled that breakthrough chair design. Béhar, who had museum shows in his 30s and unveiled the XO Laptop at 40, is still in his early 50s and will most likely be working for decades. “Designers and architects don’t tend to retire,” he said. “They tend to die at their desk.”\n\n“My hope is that people can see that when technology is applied with a humanist point of view it can make a tremendous difference for people,” Béhar told me. The traumas of 2020 sharpened this aspect of his practice—design for the aging, the sick, the very young, the marginalized. “Design resilience,” Béhar said, is now a central theme at Fuseproject. It means a focus on strong foundations and long-range planning—an antidote to short term-itis. “We have a minimally viable product mentality in a lot of our institutions,” he said, extending the critique beyond design. He is questioning projects and priorities with renewed vigor: “What’s the purpose? Is there a tangible social value?”\n\nThe pandemic grounded the relentless travel that comes with being Yves Béhar—client visits, design fairs, lectures. It’s meant more family time, regular Fuseproject Zooms. “We’ll all have saved money and carbon in the process,” he said. Béhar’s design approach has always been what he calls “proactive,” anticipating needs that might arise a few years down the road—the futurist in him. But the pandemic also required Fuseproject to be reactive. As Béhar put it, “We decided to put ourselves at the service of others and what was needed.”\n\nReacting to a real-time catastrophe made Fuseproject an analogue, in miniature, of an auto plant that shifts its output from sedans to tanks during wartime. Béhar mentioned that the firm designed posters for the United Nations and helped get the entire town of Bolinas, California (population 1,077), tested for COVID-19. When Massachusetts General Hospital issued a call for the rapid design and fabrication of ventilators to meet the coronavirus crisis, Fuseproject, teaming with the tech start-up Cionic, came through with the winning entry, the Vox ventilator, developing the lifesaving device in record time. “I realized that that’s what animates me, gets me out of bed—responding to conditions no matter how dramatic or terrifying,” Béhar said.\n\nThe do-gooderism of Fuseproject has always been conspicuous, with projects highlighting sustainability and philanthropy, such as bringing eyewear to Mexican schoolchildren. But a recent spate of projects suggests that this, and not high-end juicers, is the true focus of Fuseproject in 2021 and beyond. Béhar designed low-cost 3D-printed houses for the charity New Story that were built in Mexico last year, and a 4,000-square-foot undersea research lab called Proteus, with the oceanographer Fabien Cousteau, that is planned for the waters off Curaçao. (Béhar also recently designed sunglasses made from recycled ocean detritus for a Dutch nonprofit, The Ocean Cleanup.) He has designed Moxie, a cute, expressive robot pal that helps autistic kids acquire social skills, and ElliQ, a robot companion for the elderly that looks like a luminous sculptural object. Such projects, Béhar said, will help us see robots and AI as “humanizing and not dehumanizing,” erasing our terror of being ruled by HAL 9000.\n\nHis most celebrated robotic design is arguably the Snoo, a sleeper and bassinet developed with Karp, author of The Happiest Baby on the Block, and his wife, the filmmaker Nina Montée Karp. Following Karp’s principles, the Snoo can swing and sway and shush (microphones detect a baby’s cries and the crib reacts with soothing sounds), and it comes with a snug little sack that achieves perfect swaddling—the blanket-burrito effect that parents struggle with. It does all of this while looking cool—a midcentury-modernish piece of quality furniture with hairpin steel legs. “Our goal was to have something so beautiful and so welcoming to a child and so approachable to a parent—and yet it’s technology,” Karp told me. “His design made those counterpoints go together so well.” Montée Karp picked up the thread: “It’s a robot—but he made it so sweet and poetic.”\n\nThe Snoo is the kind of baby accessory that makes you tempted to have another child. It’s also the rare one that may defend against SIDS, by preventing infants from rolling onto their stomachs, and help alleviate postpartum depression by making new mothers less exhausted and frustrated. The FDA has recognized the Snoo as a “breakthrough device,” and it has taken up floor space in hospitals and in museums, including the Victoria and Albert and the Cooper Hewitt (the Smithsonian’s design museum), which acquired one for its permanent collection. (It retails for $1,400 but is offered in a more affordable rental program, and, Karp said, it is now an employee benefit at a number of corporations.) Béhar considers it one of his most rewarding projects, a case study in how tech, with the aid of design, can solve problems, not proliferate them. “There are certainly elements of technology that make us feel like we’re paralyzed,” he said, “but technology isn’t something that I feel powerless about. In social media, financial services, and other places, there are technologies that take advantage of us. I want it to be the other way around.”\n\n“If I were a young designer,” Medda told me, “I would aspire to be Yves Béhar.” He is now what Charles and Ray Eames were in an earlier age, a designer that up-and-coming practitioners emulate and seek out for mentorship. “It’s incredibly rewarding to have young designers tell me they got into the field because we inspired them,” Béhar said of Fuseproject. “It is important to provide hope for younger designers.”\n\nEver the optimist, Béhar is still scanning what’s ahead, imagining today’s plans taking shape in a tomorrow we can’t yet discern. He admitted to being a little impatient to get there. “I never think it’s going to be 5 or 10 years out,” he said, before clicking into a Zoom conference. “I think it’s, like, two or three. But I have learned that things to do take more time.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that Sabrina Buell’s mother was no longer alive.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Why Meghan and Harry’s Revelations About Racism Within the Royal Family Were So Devastating\n\n— After the Year of No Bras, Things Are Looking Up\n\n— The Hamptons Rids Itself of Donald Trump Jr. Ahead of High Season\n\n— The New, Sad Irony of the Rift Between Prince William and Prince Harry\n\n— Caroline Rose Giuliani’s Unicorn Tale: Three-Way Sex Has Made Me a Better Person\n\n— A Brief History of Piers Morgan’s One-Sided TV Feud With Meghan Markle\n\n— 20 Women-Owned Fashion Brands for Celebrating Women’s History Month\n\n— From the Archive: Meghan Markle, an American Princess\n\n— Not a subscriber?
