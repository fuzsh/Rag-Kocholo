        "text": "The interrelation and dependencies between the business model and its environmental context has until now rarely been the object of systematic and empirical study. By means of a case study, we analyze a disruptively changed industry value chain and its effect on the business model of non-trivial products (technological, aesthetic and entertainment components). Therefore, we examine the business model changes of an established games developer in a transition phase. The games industry is an interesting example, because there is no other industry that has emancipated itself over such a short period of time from a niche market with the cliché of producing only products for teenagers and &quot;nerds&quot; into a mass market which itself has become a crucial direct or indirect success factor for the largest IT companies in the world. The technological and non-technological innovations as a result of the digitalization have led to an explosion of new business model types in the games marke...\n\nPurpose This study aims to investigate how manufacturing firms in the creative industries harness digital technologies to undertake business model innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study used in-depth case studies to examine the complex interplay between digital technologies and business model innovation. A longitudinal approach was selected to capture major events both within the firm and in the business environment. Building on the firm’s archival data, interviews and secondary data that was available to the public, the authors carefully analyzed impactful digital technology events and the firm’s responses to the technological changes that occurred over the period of 2004–2020. Findings The findings suggest that digital technologies alone are not sufficient for business model innovation to be successful; support from sociotechnical factors is also required. Additionally, firms should reinvent a new business model when the existing ones seem to start to diminish. Researc...\n\nPrevious studies on business model innovation were considered to have several problems specifically related to the clarity of the construct and gaps with antecedents, contingency and results. Most researches focused on variables outside the organization as antecedents of business model innovation. This study examines variables that are within the organization, namely transformational leadership, innovation culture and information technology as antecedents of business model innovation and measures their impact on firm performance. The study was conducted on 196 firms in the creative industry in Indonesia. Structural Equation Model was used to analyse statistical data. The result shows that transformational leadership, innovation culture and information technology do not directly impact firm performance. They need to be mediated by business model innovation.\n\nThe topic of cultural and creative industries has been strongly debated by economics and business scholars over the last two decades. At the same time, the Business Model tool was developed. Assuming that both of the topics have created enormous debates among scholars and practitioners, the definition of cultural industries is shifting to the wider definition of creative industries. Such extension is meant to comprehend all of those industries and all of those sectors that are including dynamics of generation and exploitation of intellectual property. Such approach led to the embracing of a wide range of industries that were rarely associated to the cultural and creative domains in the past. Furthermore, the Business model has shifted from being an architecture specifically designed to serve the e-business, to a flexible yet hard to define “good-for-all” method to better understand and/or improve any kind of business. Surprisingly, studies on the Business model specifically applied to the Creative industries appeared to be fragmented. The present study aimed to briefly review the Business Models literature applied to the Creative industries, in order to measure how much the tool has been studied within the CCIs and through which lens and objectives. Additional goals have been the analysis of the subsectors within the creative industries that had already been treated from scholars prior, highlighting the ones that should be analyzed further in the future.\n\nThis study adopts a dynamic capabilities perspective to explore the activities and processes through which business model innovation arises in established organisations. New and innovative business models are fundamental to the commercialisation of latest technologies, performance, competitive advantage, as well as the creation of value for customers, the focal company and its ecosystem. Yet, our current understanding of how established companies design and implement new business models is limited by a lack of empirical research. The dynamic capabilities perspective offers a promising route to investigate the managerial and organisational activities and practices through which business model innovation is enacted. Based on a review of the business model, business model innovation and dynamic capabilities literatures, business model innovation is framed as a dynamic capability and research questions are developed. These questions are investigated using grounded theory methodology, collecting and analysing data from five case studies from the manufacturing, financial services, media, consulting, and healthcare industries. Findings from an initial sample suggest a business model innovation process consisting of an inception, evolution and diffusion phase, encumbered by cognitive, emotional and behavioural challenges. Linking the findings to the dynamic capabilities perspective, three micro-foundations, namely, process orchestration, learning, and deployment mechanisms are identified. Findings from a subsequent theoretical sample not only unravel the underlying managerial and organisational activities of these micro-foundations, but also reveal further details on the challenges faced, as well as the key role of senior management for orchestrating and enacting this process and its underlying activities. Considered collectively the findings offer a novel understanding of how business model innovations come about in established organisations, a practice labelled ‘crafting business models in statu nascendi’. The dissertation closes with a discussion and synthesis of the findings, the theoretical contribution and managerial implications, as well as limitations of the present study and areas for future research. Keywords: Dynamic capabilities, business models, business model innovation."
