The DirectX API is architected in a way that takes all this into account and maximizes performance throughout the entire pipeline from NVMe drive all the way to the GPU. It does this in several ways: by reducing per-request NVMe overhead, enabling batched many-at-a-time parallel IO requests which can be efficiently fed to the GPU, and giving games better control over when they get notified of IO request completion instead of having to react to every tiny IO completion. The DirectStorage API will be available on Windows 11 PCs with NVMe SSDs, but will also be support in Windows 10 version 1909 and newer.\n\nWinDirStat(Windows Directory Statistics) is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for various versions of Microsoft Windows.\n\neBPF for Windows is an eBPF implementation that runs on top of Windows. eBPF is a well-known technology for providing programmability and agility, especially for extending an OS kernel, for use cases such as DoS protection and observability.\n\nSysinternals Suite is the entire set of Sysinternals Utilities rolled up into a single download. Also, checkout the Sysinternals Utilities Index.\n\nSecure boot is a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that a device boots(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS) using only software(such as bootloaders, OS, UEFI drivers, and utilities) that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).\n\nMicrosoft Defender Security Center is a user portal where you can access Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capabilities.

An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match with ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM’s built-in emulation. The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the current ARM64 ABI in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.\n\nNOTE: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip will be available in mobile devices starting Mid-2024.\n\nSnapdragon X Elite is its all-new custom CPU architecture, codenamed Oryon. The X Elite includes a total of 12 Oryon cores, rather than a mix of large and small cores like Qualcomm has used in past designs. When all cores are active, they can run at peak speeds of up to 3.8 GHz, though when just one or two cores are boosting they can go up to 4.3 GHz.\n\nQualcomm says that the X Elite's Adreno GPU has upgradeable drivers, which means new capabilities can be added over time. it will support a 4K 120 Hz laptop display, plus a total of three 4K external displays (or two 5K external displays). The GPU supports the DirectX 12 graphics API—no Vulkan support, at least not yet—and Qualcomm says it will feature upgradeable drivers. Qualcomm compared the X Elite's GPU performance to both Intel's Iris Xe and AMD's Radeon 780M. The Adreno GPU is reportedly up to 2x as fast as the Iris Xe and up to 80% faster than the Radeon 780M, while using about one-fifth as much power.\n\nThe chip also includes respectable media encoding and decoding capabilities, with support for hardware-accelerated H.264, H.265/HEVC, and AV1 video encoding and decoding, plus hardware-accelerated decoding support for the VP9 codec.\n\nThe X Elite can use up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM with up to 136 GB/s of memory bandwidth to the chip. The image signal processor (ISP) supports up to 64 MP cameras and 4K HDR video capture. The chip supports PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs and the UFS 4.0 and SD 3.0 storage standards, as well as up to three USB 4 ports (plus two more 10 Gbps USB 3.2 gen 2 ports).\n\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n\nGeekbench 6 (multi-core) scores Snapdragon X Elite (Config A) 15,130 Snapdragon X Elite (Config B) 14,000 Apple M2 8,911 Apple M2 Pro 14,965 Apple M2 Max 14,939 Intel Core i7-13000H 12,171\n\n3DMark Wild Life Extreme Unlimited Snapdragon X Elite 44.5 fps (Config A) MacBook Pro 14-inch M2 Pro 73 fps MacBook Pro 14-inch M2 Max 80 fps MacBook Pro 13-inch M2 40.5 fps\n\nBack to the Top\n\nNote 1: Before performing any upgrade to your system make sure to do a full backup of your system in case anything happens during the upgrade process!\n\nNote 2: Some anti-cheat software for video games(like Valorant) will require TPM, Secure Boot on Windows 11.\n\nWays to install Windows 11 on Unsupported hardware | Microsoft Support\n\nFido is a PowerShell script that is primarily designed to be used in Rufus, but that can also be used in standalone fashion, and whose purpose is to automate access to the official Microsoft Windows retail ISO download links as well as provide convenient access to bootable UEFI Shell images.\n\nFido\n\nOR\n\nRufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives.\n\nRufus\n\nIn Rufus 3.19:\n\nAdd a new selection dialog for Windows 11 setup customization:\n\nSecure Boot and TPM bypass have now been moved to this dialog.\n\nAllows to bypass the mandatory requirement for a Microsoft account on Windows 11 22H2.

This may also apply to single-player games with an embedded or dedicated multiplayer portion. Use at your own risk.\n\nDXVK is a set of software libraries that translates DirectX API calls to Vulkan API calls. It supports DirectX versions 9, 10 and 11. Vulkan and APIs similar to it (DirectX12, Metal) are a a lot better at making use of multi-core/multi-threaded CPUs to batch up work that needs to be done by the GPU thereby making better use of both CPU and GPU. This can lead to significant performance boosts in some games.\n\nFirst, do these steps:\n\nDownload the latest release of DXVK from GitHub.\n\nUse 7-Zip to unzip the dxvk-x.x.x folder (where x.x.x is the version number).\n\nDo these steps for each game:\n\nImportant information you need to know about the game you want use DXVK with:\n\nThe version of DirectX it uses.\n\nWhether it's using 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nIn most cases, you can find out both of these from a game's API section section on PCGamingWiki. There may be some clues in the file/folder names your game's folder about it being 32-bit or 64-bit. If there's a steam_api64.dll there then it's probably 64-bit or if there's a binkw32.dll it's likely to be 32-bit.\n\nOpen the folder where your game's executable is (.exe file).\n\nOpen the folder where you extracted DXVK and go the appropriate folder for your game's bitness, x32 for 32-bit, x64 for 64-bit.\n\nCopy the following files to the folder where the game's executable is depending on the game's DirectX version:\n\nDirectX version Files to copy 9 d3d9.dll 10 d3d10.dll, d3d10_1.dll, d3d10core.dll, d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll 11 d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll\n\nIf your game supports multiple DirectX versions copy all the applicable DLLs.\n\nThat's it! Now run the game.\n\nUnfortunately, DXVK isn't going to work in all situations. So far I've been unsuccessful in getting it to work in the following scenarios:\n\nXbox Game Pass (and likely Microsoft Store) games.\n\nSteam In-Home Streaming with exclusive fullscreen games.\n\nBack to the Top\n\nDirectStorage is a feature intended to allow games to make full use of high-speed storage (such as NVMe SSDs) that can can deliver multiple gigabytes a second of small (eg 64kb) data reads with minimal CPU overhead. Although it is possible to saturate a drive using traditional ReadFile-based IO the CPU overhead of increases non-linearly as the size of individual reads decreases.
