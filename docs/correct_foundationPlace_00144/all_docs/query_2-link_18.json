        "text": "3DV Systems is a pioneer and world leader in three-dimensional video imaging. Established in 1997 and headquartered in Yokne'am, Israel, the company has developed a unique patented technology which enables cameras to capture the depth dimension of objects in real time, high speed and very high resolution, using low or no CPU resources. 3DV was founded by Dr. Giora Yahav and Dr. Gabi Iddan, two veteran scientists of Rafael, Israel's leading defense industry. Leveraging their experience and know-how gained through leading development of electro-optics missile technology, they came up with a ground-breaking concept of measuring distance from objects using the Time-of-Flight principle.\n\nA-Med Systems Inc. develops products that provide circulatory support during“beating heart” cardiovascular surgery. These devised could help speed up apatient’s recovery time. Its product, the A-Syst, helps keep theheartpumpingduring coronary artery bypass surgery without a conventional heart lungmachine. About 800,000 people worldwide are expected to have cardiac bypasssurgery this year. Fewer than 20 percent of the procedures are done without theconventional heart-lung machine for support. The percentage is expected togrow dramatically. The company nailed down a promising partnership in early2000 with an affiliate of Deerfield, Ill.-based BaxterInternational forexclusive distribution rights in Europe. It sold its first product in Europe inMarch 2000. Founded in the Silicon Valley, A-Med moved in 1998 to WestSacramento.\n\nAbrizio was a fabless semiconductor company which made switching fabric chip sets. Their chip set, the TT1, was used by several large system development companies as the core switch fabric in their high value communication systems."
