If you find yourself facing this question, we’ll show you what you can do and the best fix to stop windows from leaking water. Are Your Windows Leaking Water? Here’s How to Tell First, let’s talk about how to be sure that your windows are leaking water. Sometimes it looks like your windows are leaking water, but the leak is coming from somewhere else–like your ceiling. So, how can you be sure that your windows are leaking water? Water stains around window frame Peeling paint on the wall or interior frame Visible mold on or near window, such as the sill Damp or musty smell Warped or damaged window sealant Condensation between double-glazed panes What Causes Windows to Leak Water? Your window is leaking water. Now what? Let’s talk about the why. Knowing why your windows leak water can help you learn how to stop the leak. Windows can leak water for several reasons: Poor installation Worn-out sealant Old wood windows deteriorating Your house needs window flashing When windows are not correctly installed, gaps or spaces pop up between the window frame and the building structure, allowing water to seep through. This is especially true when there’s no window flashing, which protects your home from water damage. Meanwhile, the sealant used to keep water out can break down due to exposure to the elements, such as sun, wind, and rain, leading to leaks. Older windows may also become less effective at keeping water out as their materials, like wood or caulking, deteriorate. Another common cause of window leaks is the failure of the window's drainage system. Windows are designed with weep holes that allow water to escape from the frame and prevent pooling. If these holes clog up with debris, water can back up and enter your home. How to Stop Windows from Leaking Water Now, here comes the big question–how do you stop windows from leaking water? Once you determine that your windows are leaking water, it’s time to take action. Here are some ideas to help stop windows from leaking water. Look for cracks or holes in or around the window Water can seep inside cracks or holes in the window. Here is how to find them and patch them up: Regularly inspect window frames and sashes for cracks or damage. Seal any cracks or holes with caulk or sealant immediately. Check for gaps between the window frame and the house structure. Ensure weep holes are clear of debris to allow proper drainage. Window weep holes drain water from your windows while preventing airflow into your home, and small flaps cover the holes to keep the wind from blowing through them. For significant gaps, use expanding foam insulation for a tighter fit. Check the weatherstripping and caulking When weatherstripping and caulking fails, it can lead to water leaks. Here is how to address those issues: Inspect weatherstripping for wear or damage. Replace worn or damaged weatherstripping promptly. Check caulking around window for cracks or gaps. Re-caulk areas where old caulking has failed. Ensure caulking is smooth and fully seals edges. Choose high-quality, weather-resistant caulking material. Silicone is best! Pay attention to old wood windows Sometimes old windows–wood, especially–will leak water. The truth is that new caulking or weatherstripping is often a band-aid approach. Your old wood windows might be failing if: The wood frames are visibly rotting or warped. Paint on the window frames is peeling or blistering. You can feel drafts coming through the window edges. The operation of the window (opening/closing) is compromised. Condensation frequently forms inside the glass of double-paned windows. There's a noticeable increase in your heating or cooling bills. The window sash or frame has become soft to the touch. Are Your Windows Leaking Water? Coastal Can Help!

It’s not a surprise that your exterior siding comes in relation to curb appeal, and vinyl siding happens to be one of the most popular options in New England. That's why it's important to think about the process of maintaining vinyl siding in the spring–but luckily, there isn't too much to maintain! When it comes to vinyl siding maintenance, you’ll be happy to hear that there is not a lot involved. Here are some tips to make sure your siding is in good shape for Spring. Keep in mind that premium spring siding materials will make a difference in your home's performance throughout the year! 1. Check for Signs of Moisture Damage This is one of the more ominous issues when it comes to your home exterior. Moisture damage will directly impact the siding performance. However, vinyl siding is a non-porous and sustainable siding material. This means that water will not penetrate the exterior and cause problems like rot. That's why you need durable siding for spring weather–and vinyl is a top choice for New England homeowners! Common Signs of Moisture Damage in the Spring Season With wood siding, it’s a different story. You may see holes in your siding too. You will need to look for signs such as: -Chunks of the exterior have crumbled away. -The wood is soft and the screwdriver sinks into it the last time when you push it into the wood. -There is mold, mildew or algae growth present. -The siding is dry rotting. -There are bubbles in your siding. -The siding seams are popped out of place. Since wood is an organic material, this makes it is a good source of food for insects. The bad news is that it can ultimately end up destroying wood siding. This is why many homeowners choose to switch from all wood siding to new vinyl. The better news is that there are plenty of options for vinyl siding that looks like wood, all without the worry of moisture damage and wood rot. 2. Look Out for Termite and Insect Damage When it comes to replacing siding on a house in the spring, you’re doing yourself a favor by deterring insects. Our vinyl siding is treated to repel insects, even termites! According to Progressive Foam, “Termites destroy wood in foundations, walls, and roofs of houses, and the damage they leave behind can be an expensive and difficult task. Most people aren’t aware of the damage caused by termites until it is too late to eliminate them.” We incorporate a termite inhibitor in our insulating foam for several reasons: Termites will tunnel through ordinary foam insulation for shelter. Insects are undetected behind your siding so they can have easy access to the wooden parts of the home structure. The tunnels that termites leave behind damage the insulating value of the foam and compromise its strength of the foam. All it takes for a termite infestation to begin is an entry point of 1/32”. If your old wood siding is filled with holes or loose panels, it’s inviting these pests to further destroy the exterior. Meanwhile, termites need a warm and moist environment to thrive. Wet wood siding serves as a haven. However, if moisture is found behind the panels of old vinyl siding, an infestation can still begin. Remember that termites tend to gravitate to untreated wood siding. Don’t forget that termites aren’t the only pests to worry about with wood siding! Carpenter ants are more than happy to make a home out of your wood siding as well. Common Signs of Termite & Insect Damage on Wood Siding: -Buckling wood -Termite swarms -Termite tunnels -A strange smell in your home that is similar to mold or mildew -Holes in the wood -Swollen walls, floors, or ceiling -Your wood siding looks like it has a hint of moisture damage -You may find peeling paint or loose wallpaper in your home Tip: Foamback siding does more than just save energy; it protects your home from insect damage. 3. Do Not Pressure Wash Your Vinyl Siding: Try This Instead Many homeowners ask how to clean vinyl siding. What is the correct way to wash vinyl siding in the spring? There is one warning that we need to make clear: it’s a bad idea when it comes to pressure washing a house with vinyl siding! Over time, atmospheric dirt may stick to the siding. Cleaning vinyl siding is easy, and there are several ways to approach cleaning this exterior: -Handwashing with a soft cloth and mild cleaning solution. Homeowners can make cleaning solutions by mixing mild dish soap with warm water. -Another option is to create a 70/30 mixture of water and vinegar. This vinegar solution can also successfully remove mold and mildew. If the vinyl has a textured surface, use only a bristle brush to remove stains from the grooves. Avoid using cleaners that contain nail polish remover, furniture polish or undiluted chlorine bleach.

For best results, clean vinyl siding by following the directions from the manufacturer. 4. Check the Siding for Cracks and Breaks Cracks or breaks in the siding can cause water leaks in your home, especially during the rainy spring season, or if you wash the exterior with a garden hose. Top Causes of Breaking and Cracking Siding: -Old siding ages become moisture-damaged -Then produces breaks or cracks -Very heavy wind storms and downpours can also produce cracks -Be careful with your lawnmower or rock buildups against your siding. Tip: Don’t forget to look at your interior walls for damage. If your vinyl siding is cracked or broken, it can’t protect the exterior walls. This may result in interior wall damage, such as cracks. 5. Ensure Straight Panel Installation Check to make sure that your vinyl siding is properly installed. This means that the panels are positioned straight on your exterior. If the siding panels are not properly installed, they won’t effectively protect your exterior from the elements. Signs of Poor Quality Siding Installation: -Loose or sagging panels that flap in the wind, or they are hanging off the exterior of your home -Missing panels that are missing, which expose your home to the elements and may easily result in costly moisture damage -Warped or wavy siding -There is a gap between where the seam of your roof and the siding meets If any of the above is discovered, you will need to have your siding either repaired or replaced. Allowing your exterior to be exposed to the elements will result in narrative problems.

Insulated vinyl siding can save up to 5% or more on heating and cooling bills in our region. Not only does insulated siding increase energy savings and protect the home against damage, but it’s also engineered to last for life. Carefully inspect your siding for signs of wear and tear, especially if your exterior is wood. When wood siding begins to decay, it’s not always obvious to the naked eye. If your wood siding is untreated and you haven’t performed routine maintenance in some time, it’s a good idea to check for wood rot. In the most extreme cases, wood siding (and even wood window frames) can crumble away at the touch of a hand. As top-rated spring siding contractors, we see a lot of wood rot after winter. But luckily, vinyl is durable siding for spring weather! Vinyl siding installation is ideal for New England homes due to its durability and low maintenance. High-quality vinyl siding will not deteriorate from the weather or rot. If you discover rotted wood siding, don’t attempt to install vinyl panels on top of it. Doing so can cause the new siding to fall off while attempting to cover up the issue at hand. You may also need a termite inspection to check the cause of the wood rot. The best action is to contact a vinyl siding company in MA or surrounding areas of New England for a free estimate on spring installation siding services.
