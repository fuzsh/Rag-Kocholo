        "text": "What is architectural atmosphere? To answer this question, we propose a paradox: a precise definition of the inherently vague and ambiguous concept of atmosphere that satisfies, as so far as possible, scientific criteria and methodology. We suggest that the term atmosphere, understood in an architectural context, defines a state of resonance and identification (sensorimotor, emotive, and cognitive) between an individual and their surrounding built space. Human beings can empathise with inanimate rooms when they interiorly establish an embodied simulation of certain architectural features. Thus, atmospheres might be determined, mapped, and measured through quantitative methods tracing emotional, cognitive, and neurophysiological responses of individuals to spatial conditions. The exploratory study illustrated attempts to test this hypothesis, by undertaking an experiment informed by phenomenological and embodied cognition theories. We analysed the spatial unit of the corridor, altere...\n\nThe presented research work attempts to offer new insights on the human responses to the public space through quantifying the impact of varying qualities of the built environment to the individual experience [1]. The objective is to afford architects and urban designers with novel metrics on spatial cognition and emotional states for supporting design intuition and better informing urban interventions [2]. The research methodology includes the measuring of the spatial experience and psychological transactions of test subjects while navigating and exploring the urban environment, leveraging the emerging technological opportunities of mobile wearable sensing tools. Two research experiments are discussed, exploring the relationship between (a) urban attractors and user attention in walking tasks, and (b) urban proxemics and psychological states through different modes of transportation. The first study addresses the influence of specific elements in the urban environment on people’s me...\n\nBy exploring a series of perceptual devices, which constituted a notable disci- plinary expansion in the fields of art, architec- ture and design, particularly in the 1960s, the aim of this paper is to present apparatuses as instruments of embodied knowledge. The key proposition is that, situated in a liminal space between æsthethics and politics, perception and action, the discussed devices can be seen as tools of both critical analysis and radical intervention. They act as &#39;performative mani- festos&#39; which by acknowledging the agency of perception and by challenging conventions, reveal alternative spatial, somatic and societal realities, raising &#39;atmospheric awareness&#39; and promoting a co-production of new ecologies.\n\nIn understanding the multiple relationships between 'drawing' and 'interior design' we realize the techno-aesthetologic nature of the drawing discipline. Here we propose to do this in the light of two notions that we consider coextensive: the psychological one of 'affordance' (James Gibson) and the philosophical one of 'atmosphere' (Tonino Griffero) which-according to a particular neuropsychological definition of 'conscience' and 'feeling' (Antonio Damasio)-practically highlight the 'what', the 'almost what' and the 'notwhat' can be represented for descriptive and prescriptive purposes when studying or designing-drawing-an environmental artifact. The crucial question is: 'how are atmospheres depicted?' A question that is usually considered pertinent to individual poetics, which cannot be analyzed in structural and morphological terms. Instead, starting from the observation that there are also conventional atmospheres, we propose some features of a method of analysis for these cultural categorizations, a method based on the development of the axiology of the spatial enhancement modes given by Jean-Marie Floch thirty years ago, albeit revising it in the light of more recent acquisitions in the semiotic field and according to the perspectives opened by the Deep Learning computer techniques.\n\nContemporary videogames make use of a diverse array of physical and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with diverse mechanics and logics (Jorgensenn, 2013). As these new interfaces beckon, one might well wonder if we are still phenomenally limited, as Thomas Nagel (1974) once argued, to the 'resources' of our own minds. This chapter proposes that scholarship consider seriously how videogame aesthetics can articulate novel kinds of sense-perception at the edges of ludic and narrative experiences, and in forms distinct from previous scholarship concerned with experiential implications of VR (Helsel and Roth, 1991) or the phenomenology of physical interfaces (Keogh, 2018). Through a post-phenomenological understanding of atmospheres as ‘quasi-objective’ aesthetic objects (Griffero 2017; B hme, 2017) I argue that videogames offer us cyborg access to alien forms of experience, as well as new defamiliarized perspectives on human sensation."
