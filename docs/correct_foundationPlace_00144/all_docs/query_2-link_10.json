Most of these visions require a long time to materialize, some might never become true, and many have become reality already.Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) applications already create significant business benefits in industry sectors such as heavy industry, architecture, engineering & construction (AEC) and real estate, healthcare and education, INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION and the potential of these immersive technologies for these and other sectors is growing. In the meantime, the consumer VR market is slowly maturing, slowly gaining momentum and anticipating lower entry price levels, while consumer AR applications for smartphones and tablets are ready to make a larger impact in the near future.The popularity of face modification filters in Snapchat and Facebook and the AR gaming phenomenon Pokemon Go have already shown a glimpse of the potential AR content possesses. FINLAND, with its excellence in engineering and design, has been fertile ground for adopting and developing innovative technologies and creating business opportunities, which can be seen in the impressive amount of local XR (XR = VR,AR and MR) activities within the past few years.The Finnish XR scene is a tightly-knit developer community of tech\n\n4. 4 current business, research and education initiatives and network groups of the VR, AR and MR technology field. It serves as a database and contact point for all individuals interested in the opportunities that immersive technologies have to offer in Finland today. All research materials for this report were gathered during the summer of 2017 through a questionnaire and verbal interviews. A total of 60 companies out of 94 targets in FIVR’s growing XR company database responded to our survey and in effect became a part of this report.We kindly thank all involved parties for their help and support in making this report, with special thanks going to Tekes as the enabler.We wish success and best of luck to every developer and VR/AR enthusiast in Finland! Team FIVR: Santeri Suominen, lead author Tuukka Takala, co-author Olli Sinerma, co-author enthusiasts, which has drawn its power from hackathons, game development and visual computing expertise, high quality education and academic research. In recent years the Finnish XR scene has moved on from experimentation into establishing solid businesses.The developer community desires to share knowledge and best practices locally in order to reach a common goal: a healthy development ecosystem in Finland.A healthy development ecosystem is capable of providing complementary services and form partnerships with other players within the field in order to develop an early domestic market and compete globally. It thrives on fair competition, reducing early risks of startups through networks and community support and encourages companies to develop distinctive business profiles. THIS is an overview of the Finnish XR ecosystem in 2017, with information of INTRODUCTION\n\n5. 5 TERMINOLOGY AR and MR. However, terminology regarding immersive technologies still remains elusive for the public at large. Eventually, everyday use of XR devices and applications will create a language for itself. Many in the industry are using existing definitions borrowed from the scientific world: the most clear and widely adopted taxonomy is Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino’s reality-virtuality continuum, which has played a major part in defining many of VR’s core concepts. TERMINOLOGY OF VR, AR, MR AND XR THE TERMINOLOGY of VR, AR and MR can be confusing.What are these R-things exactly? Those new to the field often find themselves unable to distinguish between VR, AR, MR and 360 video.This makes communication of ideas between developers and clients difficult. Umbrella terms, such as extended, or “X” reality (XR) or “immersive technologies”, have great use in general discussion, as they provide cohesion and an easy alternative to always separately mentioning VR, \"WHAT ARE THESE R-THINGS EXACTLY? THOSE NEW TO THE FIELD OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN VR, AR, MR AND 360 VIDEO\"\n\n6. 6 THIS CONTINUUM has fully immersive virtual environments and real environments at its extremes. An application mixing real world elements and virtual elements together is an MR application. AR is a smaller subset of MR, with less virtual elements than real ones. On a conceptual level, the continuum is a great tool for understanding how interrelated VR, AR and MR are. In current practice, AR devices are generally regarded as head-worn, see-through displays, but the term can also include smartphone or tablet based AR. The terminology is partially muddled because the distinction between mixed reality and augmented reality has become a branding strategy between competing companies. TERMINOLOGY Mixed Reality (MR) Virtuality Continuum (VC) Real Environment Augmented Reality (AR) Augmented Virtuality (AV) Virtual Environment \"ON A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL, THE CONTINUUM IS A GREAT TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW INTERRELATED VR, AR AND MR ARE.\"\n\n7. 7 COMPANYSIZES The remaining 7% are large digital service providers and consultation companies with over 50 or 100 employees, that are expanding into the field of immersive technologies.These big players are building their XR capabilities in order to prepare for future demand from customers. COMPANY SIZES AT THE MOMENT Finnish immersive technology companies are currently quite small on average, with 68% having a headcount of less than 10.These are mostly startups that have emerged in great numbers during recent years, quickly developing capabilities and capitalizing on new business opportunities. However, this group also contains seasoned companies that over the years have focused on R&D or indie game development instead of company growth. 15% of the companies are somewhere between 10 and 20 employees and an additional 10% have grown over 20 employees.These are companies with several years of business experience in 3D graphics and modeling, visual design, games, films or various tech endeavors, which has eased their adoption of XR technologies when compared to newcomers. Number of employees in Finnish XR companies (2017)\n\n8. 8 COMPANYFOUNDINGYEARS THE NUMBER of newly found XR companies has peaked in the recent years: 40% of the companies involved in this study were founded after the beginning of 2016, and 77% since 2010. Many of the newer startups are founded strictly for VR/AR development and services, as passionate early adopters and enthusiasts desire to experiment with new technology and explore its business potential.Various IT companies have pivoted towards XR business since 2015 with ever growing intensity and this number will likely grow in the future, as immersive technologies gain more foothold in different industry sectors. COMPANY FOUNDING YEARS 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2002 2000 1998 1997 7 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 4 4 2 2 6 14\n\n9.

Especially in the case of large companies that are transitioning towards XR business, the XR revenue can be just a small portion of the overall revenue. For this reason, some companies had to be omitted from the revenue chart altogether to help it reflect the current situation better.\n\n11. 11 BRACKETEDREVENUE BRACKETED REVENUE THE FINNISH XR business sector is in its infancy, but significant growth can be expected in the near future, especially on the business to business application side. Between 2015 and 2016, the combined revenue of Finnish XR companies increased by 94% and combined XR- specific revenue increased by 368%. Most companies that have started their operations in 2016 are still in the middle of their first full fiscal year in 2017. Some are expecting to generate revenue after their R&D endeavors start to bear fruit, which can be seen in the amount of companies having zero revenue. Some companies, on the other hand, have had a successful business since launch, growing their revenue above the 1 million threshold in a few years. Client relations have begun to form during 2015 and 2016 and most eager early clients of VR/AR companies can be found in the AEC and heavy industry sectors, even if most use cases are currently restricted to marketing. Further major integration of XR technologies into design, personnel training or manufacturing processes is yet to happen at a large scale, although significant pilot projects are currently driving this progress. Many large companies, both clients and providers, are experimenting with new technologies and waiting for a favourable moment before fully committing into XR development and solutions. On the consumer entertainment side, most self-funded or customer revenue funded game startups currently work on VR game projects with a minimal burn rate. Some generate additional revenue from other sources, such as non-VR games and B2B VR projects. In practice,\n\n12. 12 BRACKETEDREVENUE 0 <100k€ 100–500k€ 500k–1m€ 1m–5m€ The differently colored column portions and numbers within them signify amount of companies in every respective revenue bracket. Below each year’s revenue column is the same year’s XR specific revenue column. The bracket ranges and their colors can be seen from the legend on the right. securing external funding is a must if a team wishes to focus entirely on VR game development.

Funding opportunities are currently in great demand, as XR companies are trying to get their business started and establish client relations. Funding situation of Finnish XR companies Customer revenue Self-funded from savings Seed / angel funding A / B round private funding Public institution funding 8% 34% 74% 22% 52% Demand of VR and AR services is on the rise in the near future as use-cases accumulate, public awareness spreads and more companies wish to reap the benefits offered by these technologies. Providers need to match the increase in demand by scaling up their development resources.\n\n14. 14 PLATFORMS PLATFORMS 60 COMPANIES shared information of the platforms they use with a multiple choice questionnaire.AR developers mostly employ current smartphones and tablets for their services, anticipating a near-future increase in consumer use. Some companies have already taken a head start with the Microsoft Hololens, which is still expensive and has technological imperfections, but nevertheless shows the future promise of wearable mixed reality devices. VR developers have found the high- end PC headsets Vive and Rift as the most efficient devices for their products and services. Even if the consumer install base of these devices is modest, the high-end headsets still see extensive B2B use.The largest install base of VR devices is found in the mobile side, where the Samsung GearVR stands out as the most used platform, followed by Google Daydream. New devices are generally anticipated by developers, especially the ones that are situated between the mobile and high- end PC headset categories. It is possible that the launch of new standalone VR headsets and Windows Mixed Reality headsets will reshape the consumer VR landscape, and force price cuts on the more expensive devices.

COMPANIES in the Finnish XR ecosystem are associated with a wide spectrum of activities and multiple industry sectors. Individual companies are almost impossible to summarize with just one area of expertise, as diversity of the field offers many kinds of business opportunities for developers with well-rounded skill sets. Some wish to focus exclusively on a specific area of expertise, while others pursue multiple opportunities in order to develop versatility in preparation for future demand. Usually there are many things in simultaneous development for different platforms, clients and purposes. A game studio, for example, may develop a VR game, a traditional computer game and B2B projects at the same time. B2B service providers do not necessarily discriminate between VR and AR applications, but actively research and develop both.Therefore most companies cannot be strictly classified as pure VR or AR developers. 16 COMPANIESINTHEXRECOSYSTEM COMPANIES IN THE XR ECOSYSTEM \"USUALLY THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN SIMULTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT FOR DIFFERENT PLATFORMS, CLIENTS AND PURPOSES.\"\n\n17. Major market and industry sectors associated with the Finnish XR ecosystem: 17 COMPANIESINTHEXRECOSYSTEM Content and service functions: • Adult entertainment • Aerospace • Architecture, engineering, construction (AEC) and real estate • Automotive • Games • Education • Healthcare • Heavy industry • Maritime • Travel • 360 photography and video • Content management • Design • Developer tools • Exercise • Graphics • Hardware development • Maintenance • Marketing • Performance measurement (benchmarking) • Training • VR arcades\n\n18. VR & AR business solutions are currently the mainstay of XR activities in Finland. The reasons behind companies entering the VR/AR field are roughly threefold: 1) Supply: Existing expertise in visual computing domains such as 3D animation, visualization, real time graphics, stereoscopic display technologies, computer vision, stereo camera capture systems etc. Experience in these domains has greatly helped in the transition to VR/AR development. 2) Demand: Client needs in industry sectors that already employ computer aided design methods. Such sectors include AEC, aerospace, automotive, heavy industry, and maritime industry for example. Immersive technologies have already spread into these sectors and their importance will continue to grow as integration between CAD and VR/AR methods deepens. 3) Passion, vision and timing: Developers believe greatly in VR and AR’s potential to revolutionize design, healthcare, learning, marketing and training.The technology is mature enough to be borderline cost effective, but the potential, supported by strong early experiences and customer feedback, is very promising. Getting a head start now is the key for future success. 18 COMPANIESINTHEXRECOSYSTEM \"DEVELOPERS BELIEVE GREATLY IN VR AND AR’S POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE DESIGN, HEALTHCARE, LEARNING, MARKETING AND TRAINING.\"\n\n20. 20 VRSOLUTIONSFORBUSINESSES 360FILM 360 VIRTUAL REALITY GLOBAL (2016) VANTAA Licensing, production and distribution of 360 films.

Largest user-generated interactive 360 image database that helps students orientate to the subject of study, and create their own 360 tours and virtual experiences. Target audiences include teachers, educational organizations, school districts, cities as well as media companies. 3 million teachers and students worldwide use ThingLink and create 250,000 new interactive stories per month.\n\n47. 47 “I quit my PhD program at the faculty of education in Helsinki to build ThingLink. I had an early vision of an augmented reality experience that lets users learn more about the things they see by simply touching them. That is where the name ThingLink came from; it's a link that can turn anything into a point of navigation. Technically it’s enabling hyperlinks for images so that one thing always leads to another! Functional hyperlinks are especially critical in creating interesting immersive experiences. We believe anyone from elementary school onwards should be able to easily tell stories in 360 degrees. It’s like giving them a chance to discover and explain the world in their own voice; students love it, and it builds their character, creativity and confidence! It’s good to remember that mobile VR is accessible to everyone with a smartphone or a tablet. When creation and consumption can happen on the same device, teachers and students are able to build virtual environments to teach each other. On a grand scale this leads to a user-generated a virtual universe with U.L.As (Universal Learning Assistants) that will transform the way we learn about the world.” UllaEngeström,CEOofThinglink VRSOLUTIONSFORBUSINESSES\n\n48. 48 http://tridify.com/ VRSOLUTIONSFORBUSINESSES TRIDIFY (2012) HELSINKI MARKETING CONTENT MANAGEMENTAEC A Software as Service based VR content delivery service.

In addition to game development, many game developers are actively seeking new opportunities in the B2B sector to showcase their VR know-how. The VR games market is currently an extremely competitive and challenging market to maneuver, where content supply largely exceeds customer demand. The demand will naturally increase in the future as VR devices will become more common among consumers. In the meantime various services that provide people first VR experiences, such as VR arcades and cinemas, are extremely important in educating the public and creating local distribution channels for content creators. Interest towards VR and AR is at an all time high, so consumer entertainment services are a lucrative business as well. Another development worthy of mentioning in the Finnish consumer entertainment field is the emergence of augmented physical exercise / VR exercise, which likely will raise its profile globally in professional eSports and casual exercise in the coming years.
