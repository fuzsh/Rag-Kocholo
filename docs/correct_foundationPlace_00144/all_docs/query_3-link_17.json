Don Weeden Weeden Foundation New York, NY\n\n2. Main point : Small foundations can effectively support International Conservation. (You don’t have to be a Moore, MacArthur, Marisla, Packard, or Hewlett-sized Foundation) What’s small? Weeden Foundation $30 million endowment ($1.7 million annual grants); 2 staff Mission : Protect Biodiversity Allocation: 2/3 biodiversity funding (40% international). Bottom line : Involvement of more small and medium-sized foundations could mean tens of millions more funding $$$ There are scores of small to medium US foundations engaged in biodiversity conservation But currently – less than 1/2 to 1/3 fund internationally .\n\n3. Reasons smaller foundations “shy away” Belief that small grants can do little internationally Political uncertainty is high – too risky Non-profit certification difficult outside U.S. Difficult to monitor and evaluate overseas projects - lack staff, travel budget Smaller foundations more family-based, generally more local-, or regionally-focused\n\n4. Since 1989 : over twenty 20k-100k grants for direct land acquisition, mainly in Latin America One-off grants , at least one per year as part of Weeden’s Habitat Protection Program Different approaches: Loans Direct purchase Conservation Concessions Support operating costs and restoration activities WF International Conservation grant making: Late 80s – several 100k grants for debt-for-nature swaps\n\n5. Guidelines/Rationale for WF International Conservation Program Accept greater risk – for expected more bang for buck 10k-20k grant internationally = 50k in US 20k-100k grants do make a difference especially early on (leverages larger amounts) Be open to : different approaches (e.g. loans and swaps); countries outside program preferences Preference : Protecting large undeveloped landscapes , “The Last Great Wild”/ Don’t’ follow hotspot criteria/go where funding is scarce Work mainly through US-based intermediaries\n\n6. WF Long-term International Programs: Chilean Patagonia – since 1989 5-8 grants per year; average 20k grant One of 5 current US funders for Chilean conservation Grants direct to Chilean NGOs/1-2 monitoring trips per year Long-term activities: NGO capacity building Advocacy to stop/reform bad projects/industries Promoting private land conservation legislation/networks using US model Supporting ongoing private conservation efforts\n\n7. Altai Republic , Russia – since 1999 3-4 grants per year; average 20k grant Only consistent US funder/ Support 50% of NGO activities Mix: advocacy (mainly opposing bad projects); community-sponsored nature parks; anti-poaching measures; alternative energy capacity building key responsibility grants through US-based intermediaries\n\n8. El Refugio Huanchaca, Bolivia Managed by the Weeden Foundation 1987, WF funded first debt-for-nature swap for 3.7 million acre Beni Preserve in Bolivia 1992 Purchased 125,000 acre property adjacent to 4 million acre Noel Kempff National Park, WF manages preserve as conservation science research station Ongoing collaboration with park authorities, Bolivian research institutions, and local communities\n\n9. El Refugio Huanchaca Cost to acquire and manage 125,000 acres of Bolivia wilderness? $400,000 to purchase $ 40,000 facilities improvement $40,000 annual operating cost Tremendous conservation dividends Ownership to be transferred to joint Bolivian/American non-profit ownership\n\n11. End Game : Get small and medium-sized US foundations more involved in international conservation initiatives Encourage through affinity groups Consultative Group on Biological Diversity and Environmental Grantmakers Association 60 and 300 foundation members respectively Developing Country and intermediary NGOs need to do better job in identifying and persuing potential US foundations"
