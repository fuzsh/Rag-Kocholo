        "text": "Chapter 13 of Mark has a conversation between Jesus and his disciples as they left the temple and Jerusalem, walking back to Bethany where they spent their nights. Jesus took advantage of this “teachable moment.” A casual remark about the magnificent temple by a disciple led Jesus to make a startling prophetic statement about the fate of the temple. The group paused on the Mount of Olives, where they could glance back across the valley toward Jerusalem. Perhaps they watched the sun set behind the ancient city.\n\nSeveral disciples chose that moment to ask two curious questions: When will these things happen? What will be the sign? With his answers, Jesus prepared his disciples for the difficult years ahead. He warned them about false messiahs, natural disasters, and persecutions. But he also assured them that he would be with them to protect them and make his kingdom known through them. Jesus promised that, in the end, he would return in power and glory to save them. Jesus’ warnings and promises to his disciples also apply to us as we look forward to his return:\n\n• We must be ready.\n\n• We must continue to proclaim the gospel.\n\n• We must endure great trials.\n\n• We must wait patiently.\n\n13:1 As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” NIV Jesus and the disciples were leaving the temple (this may have been either Tuesday or Wednesday evening of the week before the Crucifixion). This was Jesus’ last visit to the temple area. He would do no more preaching or public teaching. One of the disciples remarked on the incredible beauty of the temple. Although no one knows exactly what this temple looked like, it must have been magnificent, for in its time it was considered one of the architectural wonders of the world. This was not Solomon’s temple—it had been destroyed by the Babylonians in the seventh century B.C. (2 Kings 25:8–10). This temple had been built by Ezra after the return from exile in the sixth century B.C. (Ezra 6:14–15), desecrated by the Seleucids in the second century B.C., reconsecrated by the Maccabees soon afterward, and enormously expanded by Herod the Great.\n\nAbout fifteen years before Jesus was born (around 20 B.C.), Herod the Great began a massive reconstruction project to help the Jews remodel and beautify their temple. Herod had no interest in the Jews’ God, but he wanted to stay on friendly terms with his subjects, as well as build what he thought would be a lasting monument to his dynasty. Though the Jews disliked Herod, they were very proud of the temple. At this time, the construction project was still going on, for Herod’s reconstruction of the temple would not be finished until about A.D. 64 (just a few years before it was destroyed by Rome).\n\nThe temple was impressive, covering about one-sixth of the land area of the ancient city of Jerusalem. It was not one building, but a majestic mixture of porches, colonnades, separate small edifices, and courts surrounding the temple proper. Next to the inner temple, where the sacred objects were kept and the sacrifices offered, there was a large area called the Court of the Gentiles (this was where the money changers and merchants had their booths). Outside these courts were long porches. Solomon’s porch was 1,562 feet long; the royal porch was decorated with 160 columns stretching along its 921-foot length. The disciples gazed in wonder at marble pillars forty feet high, carved from a single solid stone. The temple’s foundation was so solid that it is believed that some of the original footings remain to this day. The Jews were convinced of the permanence of this magnificent structure, not only because of the stability of construction, but also because it represented God’s presence among them. The massive stones the disciple mentioned were huge white stones, some of them measuring twenty-five by eight by twelve feet and weighing more than one hundred tons.\n\n“The eyes of our Lord Jesus Christ could find no pleasure in looking at the very temple which contained the holy of holies and the golden candlestick and the altar of burnt offering. Much less, we may suppose, can he find pleasure in the most splendid place of worship among professing Christians, if his Word and his Spirit are not honored in it.”\n\nJ. C. Ryle\n\n13:2 Then Jesus asked him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.” NRSV Jesus acknowledged the great buildings but then made a startling statement: This wonder of the world would be completely destroyed. As in the days of the prophet Jeremiah, the destruction of the Jews’ beloved temple would be God’s judgment against them for turning away from him. Jeremiah had spoken God’s words to the rebellious nation, “I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals” (Jeremiah 9:11 NIV). Jerusalem had been attacked and leveled before. Here Jesus prophesied that Jerusalem and the beautiful temple would again be completely destroyed. This happened only a few decades later when the Romans sacked Jerusalem in A.D. 70.\n\nGazing at the massive stones, the disciples surely found it difficult to believe that not one of the stones would be left on top of another. Because the temple symbolized God’s presence among them, the Jews would be horrified to see it destroyed.\n\nToday, are we proud of our large churches, our high attendance numbers, and our great Christian institutions? What are our symbols of power and victory? our best-selling authors? our Christian magazines? We must watch out for pride. All that truly matters is each person’s relationship with Jesus Christ.\n\nTOPSY-TURVY\n\nWhile the disciples admired the incredible temple, Jesus foresaw its destruction. When the disciples asked for honor and glory in his kingdom, Jesus told them that the last would be first. Truly, Jesus sees a reality behind and beyond what we see.\n\nWhat is your relationship with God? All the show of religious observance won’t cover emptiness at the center of your life. Is your life given to Jesus? People can resemble buildings that are outwardly impressive but inwardly crumbling and bound for destruction.\n\nJesus wants to build your life to last forever, strong and true. Let him be your architect.\n\n13:3–4 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple. NKJV The Mount of Olives rises above Jerusalem to the east. As Jesus left the city to return to Bethany for the night, he would have crossed the Kidron Valley and then headed up the slopes of the Mount of Olives. From this slope, he and the disciples could look down into the city and see the temple, with the sun setting behind it to the west. The prophet Zechariah predicted that the Messiah would stand on that very mountain when he would return to set up his eternal kingdom (Zechariah 14:1–4). This was a fitting place for the four disciples to ask Jesus when he would come in power and what they could expect at that time. It is natural for us to want to know also.\n\nPeter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately. NKJV The inner circle of disciples (this time with Andrew added—Andrew was Peter’s brother; James and John were brothers) came to Jesus privately because they wanted to understand what Jesus meant and when this terrible destruction would happen. These were the first four disciples whom Jesus had called (1:16–20).\n\n“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?” NIV The disciples’ question had two parts: (1) They wanted to know when these things would happen (especially the destruction of the temple), and (2) they wanted to know what sign would show that they are all about to be fulfilled. The second part of their question referred to the end of the age. In the disciples’ minds, one event would occur immediately after the other. They expected the Messiah to inaugurate his kingdom soon, and they wanted to know the sign that it was about to arrive.\n\nJesus gave them a prophetic picture of that time, including events leading up to it. He also talked about far future events connected with the last days and his second coming when he would return to earth to judge all people. Like much of Old Testament prophecy, Jesus predicted both near and distant events without putting them in chronological order. The coming destruction of Jerusalem and the temple only foreshadowed a future destruction that would ultimately usher in God’s kingdom.\n\nIn order to understand the prophecy, picture yourself standing on a mountaintop looking across a distant mountain range. The mountain peaks appear to be next to each other, while in reality they are miles apart because of the valleys in between. Jesus’ prophecy pictured “mountain peaks” (significant future events) as though they would occur together, when in reality they may be thousands of years apart. Some of the disciples lived to see the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, while some of the events Jesus spoke of have not yet—to this day—occurred. But the truth of Jesus’ prediction regarding Jerusalem assured the disciples (and assures us) that everything else Jesus predicted will also happen.\n\nThere are three primary views on the Olivet discourse:\n\n(1) that all of chapter 13 is describing both the destruction of Jerusalem and the last days before Christ’s return;\n\n(2) that the first part of the prophecy (13:2–23) deals only with the destruction of Jerusalem, and then the last part (13:24–27) switches to the return of Christ;\n\n(3) that all of chapter 13 gives a prediction only of the destruction of Jerusalem; it says nothing about the return of Christ.\n\nIt is reasonable to interpret this, as with most Old Testament prophecies, as having a double fulfillment. Jesus was predicting the destruction of Jerusalem and the end times. However, in the first part of the prophecy, the destruction of Jerusalem is more prominent; in the second part, the last days before Christ’s return are more prominent.\n\nREADY AND WAITING\n\nJesus warned his followers about the future so that they could learn how to live in the present. Jesus did not make these predictions so that we would guess when they might be fulfilled, but to help us remain spiritually alert and prepared at all times as we wait for his return. We must live each day close to Christ, always mindful that he is in charge of the timetable.\n\n13:5–6 Then Jesus began to say to them, “Beware that no one leads you astray. Many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray.” NRSV Jesus first answered the disciples’ second question about the end of the age and the coming kingdom. The disciples wondered what sign would reveal these things, but Jesus warned them against seeking signs: “Beware that no one leads you astray.” Jesus knew that if the disciples looked for signs, they would be susceptible to being deceived. There would be many “false prophets” (13:22) with counterfeit signs of spiritual power and authority. Jesus predicted that before his return, many believers would be misled by false teachers coming “in Jesus’ name,” that is, claiming to be Christ. Even more confusing, these people would falsely use the words I am, long known as words claiming deity (see Exodus 3:13–14). Many scholars believe that 2 Thessalonians 2:3–10, which talks about a man of lawlessness who will lead people astray, is built upon this passage. Throughout the first century, there were many such deceivers (see Acts 5:36–37; 8:9–11; 2 Timothy 3; 2 Peter 2; 1 John 2:18; 4:1–3).\n\nIn every generation since Christ’s resurrection, individuals have claimed to be the Christ or to know exactly when Jesus would return (remember Sun Myung Moon and David Koresh?). Obviously, no one else has been Christ, and no one has been right about the timing of the Second Coming. According to Scripture, the one clear sign of Christ’s return will be his unmistakable appearance in the clouds, which will be seen by all people (13:26; Revelation 1:7). In other words, believers never have to wonder whether a certain person is the Messiah. When Jesus returns, believers will know beyond a doubt because he will be evident to all.\n\nDON’T BE SIDETRACKED\n\nBeware of groups who claim special knowledge of the last days because no one knows when Christ will return (13:32). In fact, it’s not important to know. Jesus tells us that the best way to prepare for the future is to stay faithful to him and away from imposters. We must not be sidetracked by promises for social, economic, military, or political reform. The only sure way for the disciples (and all believers) to keep from being deceived is to focus on Christ and his words.\n\n13:7 “When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still to come.” NRSV The key phrase in this verse comforts all believers, do not be alarmed. As political situations worsen, as wars and rumors of wars ravage the world, Jesus instructed his disciples and all his followers not to be afraid that somehow God had lost control of his creation or that his promises would not come true. Just as false messiahs and religious frauds come and go, so do worldly crises. Even when the world’s situation gets worse, God is in control. This must take place as part of God’s divine plan. However, the wars and rumors of wars do not signal “the end” (the end of the world). The disciples probably assumed that the temple would only be destroyed at the end of the world as part of God establishing his new kingdom. Jesus taught that horrible events would happen, but the end is still to come.\n\nWAR\n\nWar always hurts people, even when people fight for just causes. War’s suffering prompts us to want the world to end and Christ to return. For many war victims, the world does end.\n\nHold on, Jesus says to his followers. Through the pain of war, hold on. Don’t let even war discourage your hope. God is in control; Jesus is coming. The violence that rips your world today will pass. Worldly empires will rise and fall. God promises peace of heart no matter what happens, and complete peace in the new heaven and earth.\n\nMany Christians speculate on when and how Jesus will return. Charts and signs abound. Some churches predict the future with scientific zeal. But Jesus wants us to stay faithful to him even when imposters and violence seem to rule. He gives no charts, only a promise and a pledge. Don’t guess about the future; instead, give your days to him until he comes.\n\nJESUS’ PROPHECIES IN THE OLIVET DISCOURSE\n\nIn Mark 13, often called the Olivet Discourse, Jesus talked a lot about two future events: the end times and his second coming. Jesus was not trying to encourage his disciples to speculate about exactly when he would return by sharing these prophecies with them. Instead, he was urging all his followers to be watchful and prepared for his second coming. Serve Jesus faithfully now and you will be ready for his return.\n\n13:8 “For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.” NRSV The “wars and rumors of wars” (13:7), the nations at odds, and the earth’s turmoil revealed in increased earthquakes and famines would not signal the end. Instead, this is but the beginning of the birth pangs; in other words, these would be preliminary sufferings. Jesus’ words subtly explained to the eager disciples that there would be a span of time before the end of the age and the coming kingdom—it would not happen this week, or immediately upon Jesus’ resurrection, or even right after the destruction of Jerusalem. Instead, much suffering would occur as a part of life on earth, while history is moving toward a single, final, God-planned goal—the creation of a new earth and a new kingdom (Revelation 21:1–3). The description of sufferings as “birth pangs” is a typical biblical metaphor for the beginning of pre kingdom travail and suffering (see Isaiah 13:6–8; 26:16–18; Jeremiah 4:31; 22:20–23; Hosea 13:9–13).\n\nBut all these troubles must not make Christians alarmed. Because Jesus has warned us about them, we know that these are a necessary step on the way to the coming of God’s glorious kingdom. Preachers on prophecy who count up the number of earthquakes as signs of the end have not read Jesus’ words carefully. Everything will happen according to God’s divine plan. Our responsibility is to be prepared, to endure, and to continue to preach the Good News to all nations (13:10).\n\n13:9 “You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.” NIV Jesus personalized his prophecy by explaining that the disciples themselves would face severe persecution; thus, they must be on their guard in order to stay true to the faith. Being “on guard” means to be cautious and careful. We should not be shocked or surprised that the world hates us (see John 15:18–21). On the other hand, we shouldn’t be overly suspicious or totally withdraw from the world (see 1 Corinthians 5:9–11). As the early church began to grow, most of the disciples experienced the kind of persecution that Jesus was discussing. Luke recorded many of these persecutions in the book of Acts. Being handed over to the local councils referred to the local Jewish courts (sunedria) held in the synagogues (smaller versions of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem). Jesus didn’t say it, but the disciples would find out that loyalty to Christ meant separation from Judaism. Two of the disciples listening to Jesus (Peter and John, 13:3) faced the Sanhedrin not long after Jesus’ resurrection (Acts 4:1–12). At that time, they certainly remembered these words of Jesus. On account of the disciples’ belief in Jesus, the Jews would brand them as traitors or heretics, pass down the sentence right in their synagogue, and have them flogged. Flogging was the punishment given to Jews who were found guilty of serious offenses. A flogging consisted of thirty-nine lashes across the back with a leather whip. This was based on Deuteronomy 25:1–3, which calls for forty lashes; thirty-nine were given in order to avoid accidentally giving too many. The apostle Paul wrote that he had received such floggings five different times (2 Corinthians 11:24). This punishment could only be given to Jews who would submit to it in order to remain in the Jewish community.\n\nNot only would Jesus’ followers be in trouble with Jews, they would also find themselves standing trial before Gentile governors and kings. But such trials would have a purpose—the disciples were to be witnesses to these leaders. It would be through such trials that Gentile rulers would be able to hear the gospel (perhaps their only opportunity). The apostle Paul spoke to the Sanhedrin (Acts 22:30), Governor Felix (Acts 24:10), Governor Festus (Acts 25:1–6), and King Agrippa (Acts 26:1) and had hoped to speak to the emperor himself (Acts 26:32).\n\nPeter later wrote this advice to persecuted believers: “Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that, though they malign you as evildoers, they may see your honorable deeds and glorify God” (1 Peter 2:12 NRSV). He also urged them to remember the suffering and abuse that Jesus had borne for their sakes (1 Peter 2:21–25). The apostle Paul also endured an incredible amount of persecution and suffering. Paul wrote from prison that he suffered gladly because it helped him know Christ better and do Christ’s work for the church (Philippians 3:10; Colossians 1:24). The early church thrived despite intense persecution. In fact, late in the second century, the church father Tertullian wrote, “The blood of Christians is seed” because opposition helped spread Christianity.\n\n“It is important to know of pain. It destroys our self-pride, our arrogance, our indifference toward others. It makes us aware of how frail and tiny we are and of how much we must depend upon the Master of the Universe.” Chaim Potok\n\nPERSECUTED BELIEVERS\n\nSince the time of Christ, Christians have been persecuted in their own lands and on foreign mission fields. Though you may be safe from persecution now, your vision of God’s kingdom must not be limited by what happens only to you. A glance at a newspaper will reveal that many Christians in other parts of the world face hardships and persecution. Persecutions are an opportunity for Christians to witness for Christ to those opposed to him. These persecutions serve God’s desire to have the gospel proclaimed to everyone.\n\n13:10 “And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.” NKJV Jesus said that before his return, the gospel of the kingdom (the message of salvation) would be preached throughout the world. This was the disciples’ mission—and it is ours. Jesus talked about the end times and final judgment to emphasize to his followers the urgency of spreading the good news of salvation to everyone. Although they would face persecution, Jesus’ followers must never give up in their mission of actively preaching the Good News to all the nations and getting the Word of God to every language group.\n\nBy the time Mark’s readers would hear these words, Jesus’ prediction had already begun to happen. It occurred at Pentecost (Acts 2:5–11) and was spreading to all the world (Romans 1:5, 8; 15:19; Colossians 1:6, 23; 1 Timothy 3:16). It will also happen at the worldwide revelation of Jesus’ power and glory at his second coming (13:26–27).\n\nPREACHING SKILLS\n\nHow are your preaching skills? You’re a plumber, you say, and not much of a public speaker. You’re a waitress, or you’re a computer programmer, not a speaker?\n\nPreachers aren’t the only ones who preach, at least as Jesus used the term. By using your skills, your mind, and your tongue (even in conversation), you “preach” the Good News and witness to Jesus’ love and power.\n\nIt’s wrong for Christians to expect professional clergy to do all the preaching. This mission belongs to every believer. Use your many talents to share Jesus’ message until every part of God’s world has heard.\n\n13:11 “When they bring you to trial and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.” NRSV Not if the disciples would go on trial, but when they would go on trial, they were not to worry about defending themselves, but instead they were to concentrate on proclaiming the gospel. Standing before the Jewish leadership or Roman proconsuls or governors would be intimidating, but Jesus dealt with that fear ahead of time, explaining that the Holy Spirit would give them God’s peace and the words to say. These words would help the disciples be bold witnesses as they made their defense before the rulers (13:9). Notice that Jesus did not guarantee acquittal. James, one of the disciples here listening to Jesus, would be killed because of his faith (Acts 12:1–2).\n\nTAKING THE STAND\n\nJesus did not imply that studying the Bible and gaining knowledge is useless or wrong. Neither was he saying that a preacher should not prepare his message. Every Christian is responsible to study Scripture, and those who teach must know Scripture well. Jesus was teaching the kind of attitude to have when we must take an unexpected stand for the gospel, when we are forced to make a defense without any preparation. We don’t have to be fearful or defensive about our faith because the Holy Spirit will be with us, giving us the right words to say.\n\nWe must be prepared spiritually: “Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have” (1 Peter 3:15 NIV). But most often we will not be able to prepare the words ahead of time when defending our faith. So we must trust the Holy Spirit to give us immediate guidance for each present situation. (For example, see the defenses Paul made in Acts 22 and 26.)\n\n13:12 “Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.” NIV Jesus warned that in the coming persecutions his followers would be betrayed by their family members and friends as well as by religious and civil authorities. Certainly this was a reality for the Roman believers to whom Mark was writing. The fear of being put to death for one’s Christian faith would pit family members against one another.\n\nChristians in every age have had to face this possibility. Sometimes hatred of the gospel has caused betrayal. More often, it has been the desire to get approval from oppressors by betraying Christian parents. Betrayal of Jews during the Holocaust, revealed how desperate people can get. It is reassuring to know that even when we feel completely abandoned, the Holy Spirit will stay with us. He will comfort us, protect us, and give us the words we need. This assurance can give us the courage and hope to stand firm for Christ no matter how difficult the situation.\n\n“Not all that the world hates is good Christianity, but it does hate good Christianity and always will.” William Temple\n\nHOME ALONE\n\nEveryone dreads isolation. To be imprisoned alone for long periods is a form of punishment called solitary confinement. When we are shunned or betrayed, we feel unable to trust and unable to have a friend.\n\nGod created us to experience life together, connected to others. But Jesus warned us that we may face solitary confinement as part of the world’s reaction to our faith in God. Two promises will keep us steady: (1) The Holy Spirit is our constant comfort and companion, here and now, no matter what. (2) In heaven we will have a wonderful crowd of friends, dearer than any we’ve yet known. A day or two of loneliness here cannot compare. As you face persecution and ostracism, remember God’s promise to be near and your future in heaven, and take hope (see Romans 8:28–39).\n\nENDURE TO THE END – (Verses taken from NRSV.)\n\n“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” Matthew 10:22\n\n“By steadfastness … we might have hope.” Romans 15:4\n\n“When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure.” 1 Corinthians 4:12\n\n“Patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering.”\n\n2 Corinthians 1:6\n\n“As servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger.” 2 Corinthians 6:4–5\n\n“May you be prepared to endure everything with patience.” Colossians 1:11\n\n“Remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.” 1 Thessalonians 1:3\n\n“Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.” 1 Timothy 6:11\n\n“Share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.” 2 Timothy 2:3\n\n“Therefore I [Paul] endure everything for the sake of the elect.” 2 Timothy 2:10\n\n“If we endure, we will also reign with him.” 2 Timothy 2:12\n\n“You have observed … my steadfastness.” 2 Timothy 3:10\n\n“Always be sober, endure suffering … carry out your ministry fully.” 2 Timothy 4:5\n\n“Tell the older men to be … sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.” Titus 2:2\n\n“Endure trials for the sake of discipline.” Hebrews 12:7\n\n“Because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps … When he was abused, he did not return abuse; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly.” 1 Peter 2:21, 23\n\n“I, John, your brother who share with you in Jesus the persecution and the kingdom and the patient endurance.” Revelation 1:9\n\n“I also know that you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake of my name, and that you have not grown weary.” Revelation 2:3\n\n“Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.” Revelation 13:10 (14:12)\n\n13:13 “And you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.” NRSV Not only would the disciples face hatred from religious and civil leaders as well as their own families, they would be hated by all. For a Jew to convert to Christianity would soon become very dangerous, because it would lead to hatred and ostracism. And Jesus’ words looked forward to the time of the end when hatred of Christians would again occur. To believe in Jesus and endure to the end will take perseverance because our faith will be challenged and opposed. Severe trials will sift true Christians from fair-weather believers. Enduring to the end does not earn salvation for us; it marks us as already saved. The assurance of our salvation will keep us going through the times of persecution. While some will suffer and some will die, none of Jesus’ followers will suffer spiritual or eternal loss. On earth, everyone will die, but believers in Jesus will be saved for eternal life.\n\n13:14–16 “But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand).” NRSV Jesus warned against seeking signs, but as a final part of his answer to the disciples’ second question (13:4), he gave them the ultimate event that would signal coming destruction. The desolating sacrilege (also translated “abomination of desolation”) refers to the desecration of the temple by God’s enemies. Mark’s phrase, let the reader understand, was a sort of code for his Roman readers. A more precise explanation might have been dangerous for them if the letter fell into the wrong hands, so Mark urged them to understand Jesus’ words in light of the prophecy from the Old Testament prophet Daniel (see Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). The “desolating sacrilege” refers to pagan idolatry and sacrifice (see Deuteronomy 29:16–18; 2 Kings 16:3–4; 23:12–14). The “sacrilege” or “abomination” (pagan idolatry) that would occur in the temple itself would cause the temple to be abandoned (left desolate).\n\nThe first fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy occurred in 168 B.C. by Antiochus Epiphanes. He sacrificed a pig to Zeus on the sacred temple altar. This act incited the Maccabean wars.\n\nThe second fulfillment occurred when Jesus’ prediction of the destruction of the temple (13:2) came true. In just a few years (A.D. 70), the Roman army would destroy Jerusalem and desecrate the temple. Mark’s Roman audience understood the sacrilege that would occur, for the Roman army was notorious for its disregard for the religious life and freedom of the peoples it conquered.\n\nSome scholars say that the third fulfillment is yet to come. Jesus’ words may also look far forward to the end times and to the Antichrist (the Greek reads, “the desolating sacrilege set up where he should not be”). In the end times, the Antichrist will commit the ultimate sacrilege by setting up an image of himself in the temple and ordering everyone to worship it (2 Thessalonians 2:4; Revelation 13:14–15).\n\n“Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains; the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away; the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.” NRSV Many of Jesus’ followers (including Mark’s readers) would live during the time of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70. Jesus warned his followers to get out of Jerusalem and Judea and flee to the mountains across the Jordan River when they saw the temple being profaned. The Jewish historian Josephus wrote that from A.D. 66, Jewish Zealots clashed with the Romans. Many people realized that rebellion would bring the wrath of the Empire, so they fled to Pella, a town located in the mountains across the Jordan River. As Jesus had said, this proved to be their protection, for when the Roman army swept in, the nation and its capital city were destroyed. The reference to the housetop points to the construction of homes where a flat roof was used like a family room. People used the housetop to work and converse; in the evening, they enjoyed the cooler air on the roof.\n\nThe people were to leave immediately, without trying to pack bags to take along or even to return from the field to the city to get a coat (a most basic necessity). They should leave everything behind as they fled from the coming crisis.\n\nWHEN TO RUN\n\nBy constraint of their conscience, some Christians have faced death rather than flee from murderous oppressors. Their deaths have served as witnesses for Christ in their countries. Some missionaries have chosen to stand with national citizens who could not flee rather than abandon them. But these words of Christ show that he permits us to provide for our own safety in times of calamity. Fleeing from certain death does not diminish our Christian character. While it is true that God sometimes gives special help, we should not neglect whatever preparations we can make. The apostle Paul often fled from one city to another to protect his life so he could live on to present the gospel. We should ask God to tell us when to stay or when to run. We need both courage and wisdom.\n\n13:17 “How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!” NIV Here Jesus expressed sympathy and concern for those who would have difficulty fleeing because they were pregnant or had small children.\n\n13:18–19 “Pray that this will not take place in winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again.” NIV Jesus told the disciples to pray that the crisis would not break in winter because that would make it difficult for everyone to get away. Winter means swollen rivers, which would make passage difficult across the usually small streams, as well as across the Jordan River, as they made their way out of Judea.\n\nNO KIDS?\n\nSome Christian couples who are contemplating pregnancy have been discouraged by this verse. They wonder if kids should be brought into a world like this. Since the end is near and the world is decadent and dangerous, should they risk pregnancy and child rearing?\n\nThe decision to have children is personal and private. Many couples feel strongly that they want to add more Christians to the world. The church needs strong and faithful young men and women to continue to carry out its mission.\n\nAt times, however, risking a pregnancy may be unwise. Even today, there are situations so desperate and dangerous that adding the further burden of a pregnancy would cause harm to both the mother and the child.\n\nJesus was not making a general warning against pregnancy. All periods of history have risks and drawbacks; no place or time is perfect. At all times, Christian couples have the support of the church in their child-raising task, which is, after all, one of life’s greatest joys and responsibilities. Above all, we must remember that God will look out for the welfare of our children as he has looked out for us.\n\nJesus gave this warning to get out quickly because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning. The time would be evil and filled with suffering. This language, while sounding like an exaggeration, is not unusual in Scripture when describing an impending disaster. The Jewish historian Josephus recorded that when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and devastated Judea, one hundred thousand Jews were taken prisoner and another 1.1 million died by slaughter and starvation. So many Jews were crucified that the hills were emptied of trees in order to build enough crosses.\n\nWhile Jesus’ words could be taken as referring to the coming destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70, they are so emphatic and clear that they must point ultimately to the final period of tribulation at the end of the age, because, as he stated, nothing like it had ever been seen nor would ever be seen again.\n\n13:20 “If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.” NIV Many interpreters conclude that Jesus, talking about the end times, was telescoping near future and far future events, as the Old Testament prophets had done. Many of these persecutions have already occurred; more are yet to come. While a certain amount of persecution happened in the destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus may also have envisioned the persecution of believers throughout history. The persecution will be so severe that if the Lord had not cut short those days, that is, if they had not had a specific ending time, no one would survive. This refers to physical survival (as opposed to 13:13, which speaks of spiritual survival). The time would be cut short for the sake of the elect, God’s chosen people. The shortening of the time will limit their duration so that the destruction will not wipe out God’s people and thus their mission. God is ultimately in charge of history and will not allow evil to exceed the bounds he has set. Jesus had predicted the Cross for himself; here he was predicting persecution, death, and resurrection for his disciples.\n\nThose who believe that Jesus will return in the middle of the Tribulation (mid-Tribulation rapture) center on this verse, linking it with Revelation 11:7–14, where the Tribulation is interrupted after “three and a half days” or halfway through the tribulation period. The main thrust of Jesus’ teaching, however, is to show God’s mercy toward the faithful and to show that God is in ultimate control.\n\nWho are the “elect”? In the Old Testament, “elect” referred to Israel, particularly those faithful to God (see 1 Chronicles 16:13; Psalm 105:43; Isaiah 65:9, 15). In the New Testament, “elect” refers to the church (Romans 8:33; Colossians 3:12; 2 Timothy 2:10; 1 Peter 1:1–2). In this verse, the words “elect” and “chosen” refer, not to Old Testament Jews, but to all faithful believers, whether Jews or Gentiles. Paul wrote, “For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son…. Those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified” (Romans 8:29–30 NRSV). Some believe these verses mean that before the beginning of the world, God chose certain people to receive his gift of salvation. Others believe that God foreknew those who would respond to him and upon those he set his mark (predestined). What is clear is that God’s purpose for people was not an afterthought; it was settled before the foundation of the world. People are to serve and honor God.\n\nWhen the time of suffering comes, the important point for the disciples and all believers to remember is that God is in control. Persecution will occur, but God knows about it and controls how long it will take place. He will not forget his people.\n\n13:21 “Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, He is there!’ do not believe it.” NKJV In times of persecution even strong believers will find it difficult to be loyal. They will so much want the Messiah to come that they will grasp any hope that he has arrived. To keep us from being deceived by false messiahs, Jesus explained that his return will be unmistakable (13:26); no one will doubt that it is he. If they had to be told that the Messiah has come, then he hasn’t (Matthew 24:27). Christ’s coming will be obvious to everyone.\n\nMost false messiahs like Jim Jones and David Koresh build their following from faithful church attenders who have been led astray. So often the leader’s appeal is based on “I am the true way,” “I will fulfill the expectations you have,” or “I will be the power you need.” Church leaders must be alert and prevent weak Christians from becoming sucked into such cults.\n\nTRULY FALSE TEACHING\n\nTo penetrate the disguises of false leaders and teachers, we can ask\n\n• Have their predictions come true, or do they have to revise them to fit what’s already happened?\n\n• Does their teaching utilize a small section of the Bible to the neglect of the whole?\n\n• Does the teaching contradict what the Bible says about God or about known Christian morality?\n\n• Are the practices meant to glorify the leader or Christ?\n\n• Do the teachings promote isolation from or hostility toward other Christians rather than love for them?\n\nJesus’ warnings about false teachers still hold true. Upon close examination it becomes clear that many nice-sounding messages don’t agree with God’s message in the Bible. Only a solid foundation in God’s Word can equip us to perceive the errors and distortions in false teaching.\n\n13:22 “False Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect—if that were possible.” NIV The Old Testament frequently mentions false prophets (see 2 Kings 3:13; Isaiah 44:25; Jeremiah 23:16; Ezekiel 13:2–3; Micah 3:5; Zechariah 13:2). False prophets claimed to receive messages from God, but they preached what the people wanted to hear, even when the nation was not following God as it should. There were false prophets in Jesus’ day, and we have them today. They are the popular leaders who tell people what they want to hear—such as “God wants you to be rich,” “Do whatever your desires tell you,” or “There is no such thing as sin or hell.” Jesus also said that false Christs would come, and he warned his disciples, as he warns us, not to be swayed by whatever signs and miracles they might produce. They will be able to perform miracles designed to convince people that their claims are true. But their “power” will be by trickery or from Satan, not from God. Both false and true prophets can work miracles (see Deuteronomy 13:1–5; 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12; 1 John 4:1–3; Revelation 13:11–18).\n\nYet will they be so convincing that they might even lead the elect astray? Is it possible for Christians to be deceived? Yes, and Jesus pointed out the danger (see also Galatians 3:1). The arguments and proofs from deceivers in the end times will be so convincing that it will be difficult to be faithful. If we are prepared, Jesus says, we can remain faithful. With the Holy Spirit’s help, the elect will not give in and will be able to discern what the deceivers say as false.\n\n13:23 “So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.” NIV The disciples had been given special knowledge about the coming kingdom, as well as the coming crises and deceptions preceding it. This gave them all the more reason to be on guard or alert so as to be aware of the deceptions. While they might not be taken in, they would be responsible to help keep others from being deceived. Spiritual vigilance is a major theme of the Olivet Discourse. Spiritual alertness and moral preparation are taught by Jesus and portrayed by Mark throughout chapters 13 and 14: Beware that no one leads you astray (13:5); be on your guard (13:9, 23, 33); keep awake (13:35); do not be found asleep (13:36); keep watch (14:34); watch and pray (14:38).\n\nALWAYS VIGILANT\n\n“Don’t let your guard down” is good advice to anyone facing an enemy. Jesus warns that our spiritual enemies are never on vacation, that we must be vigilant every day (1 Peter 5:8–9).\n\nKeeping our guard up is smart defense. It’s our side of the two-way arrangement that will see us through troubles to come. God has promised to protect and save; but we must also be alert and ready.\n\nWe stay “on guard” through regular prayer and Bible study by ourselves and with others, worship, cultivating loyal Christian friends, and learning to discern between right and wrong, true and false. We must keep these projects going, always in progress. These disciplines make or break a Christian’s preparedness for whatever the enemy throws at us.\n\nJESUS TELLS ABOUT HIS RETURN / 13:24–31 / 202\n\nThis section provides Jesus’ true answer to the questions his disciples asked in 13:4. But Jesus went well beyond what he had been asked. The original questions focused on the destruction of the temple and the devastation of the nation. In his answer, Jesus predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and his return in full glory without any of the limitations he took on by becoming human. He was not speaking of his immediate resurrection, but his eventual, glorious return.\n\nIn the previous paragraphs, Jesus painted a picture of hardship, confusion, and waiting. But when it seems as though things can’t possibly get any worse, they will. Heaven and earth will be irreversibly changed. There will be a sunset, but no sunup. That completely dark stage will make the arrival of the Son of Man visible to all.\n\n13:24–25 “But in those days, following that distress, ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ ” NIV The little word but reveals a huge contrast between the false prophets and messiahs and the return of the true Messiah. The phrase in those days signaled that Jesus was talking specifically about the end times (see similar wording in the Prophets: Isaiah 34:4; Joel 2:30–31; Zechariah 8:23). After the time of tribulation, nature itself would experience change. As taught in Romans 8 and 2 Peter 3, the entire universe became involved in humanity’s sin predicament; thus, the entire universe will be changed when humanity is changed.\n\nThe changes in the heavens will be an intended contrast to the pseudo “signs and omens” (13:22) of the false messiahs. There will be a variety of changes—the sun going dark, the moon not being seen, stars falling, heavenly bodies being shaken (perhaps planets going out of their normal orbits in the solar system). These words also recall the words of the prophets (Isaiah 13:10; Joel 2:10–11). What Jesus here described, John saw in his vision of the end times recorded in Revelation: “I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black … the whole moon turned blood red, and the stars in the sky fell to earth…. The sky receded like a scroll, rolling up” (Revelation 6:12–14 NIV).\n\nMark 13:24–26 and Matthew 24:29–31 form the heart of the teaching that Jesus’ coming will not occur until after the Tribulation (post-Tribulation rapture). Those who hold this view feel that Christ will not come until the ultimate destruction has occurred. But the connection of these verses to their Old Testament roots in the prophets seems to connect them more with judgment on the nations and the political powers than on the destruction of the world.\n\nThe coming persecutions and natural disasters will cause great sorrow in the world. But when believers see these events happening, they will know that the return of their Messiah is near, and they can look forward to his reign of justice and peace. Rather than being terrified by what is happening in our world, we should confidently await Christ’s return to bring justice and restoration to his people.\n\nTHE LONGED-FOR LEADER\n\nGod’s promise of a future kingdom where Christ rules in great power and glory gives us reason for hope.\n\nToday, leaders are shortsighted, prone to bend principle for political gain, and sometimes corrupt. Yet we ask them to be for us what only Christ can be. When Christ returns to rule, his leadership will be just, strong, and wise. He will bring the world for which we have hoped and longed, led by the leader we needed and for whom we have waited.\n\nWhen injustice ruins your plans today, spoils your program, or angers your soul, take hope. God calls us to work and live for the next administration, led by the one whose program brings justice and love.\n\n13:26 “Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory.” NRSV After the cosmic events recorded in 13:25, all the people on earth will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds.’ Jesus’ return will be unmistakable; no one will wonder about his identity. The “clouds” are pictured as the Son of Man’s royal chariot, bringing him from heaven to earth in the Second Coming (to the Jews, clouds signified divine presence; see, for example, Exodus 13:21; 19:9; Psalm 97:1–2; Daniel 7:13). Jesus’ second coming will not be as a humble, human carpenter, but as the powerful, glorious, and divine Son of Man. He will arrive to defeat Satan, judge all people, and set up his kingdom (8:38).\n\n13:27 “And then He will send His angels, and gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven.” NKJV Upon his return to earth, Jesus will send his angels out to gather together His elect from the four winds (that is, from all across the world, see also Psalm 50:3–5; Isaiah 43:6; 66:18; Jeremiah 32:37; Ezekiel 34:13; 36:24; 37:9; Daniel 7:2; 8:8; 11:4; Zechariah 2:6). The angels’ gathering of the elect signifies the triumphant enthronement of the Son of Man, who will be revealed in all his power and glory. The manifestation of the angels and the gathering of the people will gloriously mark the end of Jesus’ keeping secret his divine power and authority. Jesus’ second coming marks the core of the Christian hope. When he comes, the whole world will know that Jesus is Lord, and Christians’ hope and faith will be vindicated.\n\nMark’s wording, from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven, combines a couple of Old Testament expressions—from Deuteronomy 13:7 and Deuteronomy 30:4. The wording gives special stress to the concept that none of the elect will be overlooked or forgotten. God won’t lose track of anyone.\n\nSome have interpreted He will send His angels to mean that Christ will not touch the earth, that the angels will gather up the elect. But Jesus refers to the gathering together of the saints from everywhere, not to lifting them up from earth to heaven.\n\n13:28 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.” NIV In the form of a parable, Jesus answered the disciples’ question regarding when the events he spoke about would happen (13:4). So far in this lengthy discourse, Jesus has traced two key themes: (1) the disciples’ suffering and (2) their need to be watchful. The Greek word engus means “close” or “nearby”; it does not mean “soon” or “immediately.”\n\nThe disciples, like anyone living in Palestine, knew how to interpret the coming of summer from the twigs and leaves of the fig trees. Fig trees lose their leaves in winter and bloom in late spring. The dry, brittle twigs getting tender with rising sap and the leaves coming out were certain signs that summer was near.\n\nSUMMER BREEZE\n\n“Pay attention,” Jesus urged. “Summer follows spring. My return is as certain as these signs,” he said. “Don’t worry, I’m coming.”\n\nOf seasonal change we feel confident. We plan on it and never worry about mix-ups in nature’s timetable. With the same confidence we should hope for Jesus’ return.\n\nBut what about today? Are you deep in a personal winter? Do you need more warmth right now? more light? God’s sunshine comes to you today by faith in the living Christ. God’s warming winds bring out the new leaves on your life’s tree and promise you a long and gentle season ahead—the summer of Jesus’ return.\n\n13:29 “So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.” NRSV In the same way that they could interpret the season by the leaves on trees, so the disciples could know when these significant events would occur. When they saw these things (referring to the events described in 13:5–23), they would know that the destruction of Jerusalem would soon follow. Some scholars feel that the phrase he is near refers back to 13:14 and the coming desecration of the temple. But this interpretation makes too abrupt an interjection in Jesus’ thought. Since Jesus was reassuring the disciples, it makes more sense to interpret “he” as referring to the Son. Thus, this verse means that the second coming of Jesus is near. The fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy would assure the disciples that the other prophecies he had given regarding the end times would also come true.\n\n13:30 “Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.” NRSV The solemn phrase Truly I tell you introduces an important truth, an assurance like an oath. There are three views of the meaning of this verse: (1) It refers only to those alive at this time who would be alive also at the destruction of Jerusalem; (2) it refers to the end times only; (3) it refers both to the destruction of Jerusalem and the end times.\n\nJesus singled out this generation, using the Greek word genea, which can refer both to those living at a given time as well as to race or lineage (therefore, he was speaking of the Jewish race). That makes the third view above most likely. Jesus used “generation” here to mean that the events of 13:5–23 would occur initially within the lifetime of Jesus’ contemporaries. Jesus explained that many of those alive at that time would witness the destruction of Jerusalem. In addition, the Jewish nation would be preserved and remain on earth, so Jews also would witness the end-time events.\n\n13:31 “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.” NKJV There could be no doubt in these disciples’ minds about the certainty of these prophecies. While heaven and earth as we know them would eventually come to an end, Jesus’ words (including all his teachings during his time on earth) would never pass away into oblivion. They were true and would remain for all eternity.\n\nTRUTH NEVER CHANGES\n\nIn Jesus’ day the world seemed tangible, dependable, and permanent. These days many people fear its destruction by nuclear war or environmental disaster. Jesus tells us, however, that even if the earth should pass away, the truth of his words will never be changed or abolished (see also 2 Timothy 2:9). God and his Word provide the only stability in our unstable world. People who spend their time only learning about this temporary world and accumulating its possessions, while neglecting the Bible and its eternal truths, are very shortsighted! Focus on God’s “world,” not this one.\n\nJESUS TELLS ABOUT REMAINING WATCHFUL / 13:32–37\n\nProbably because Jesus knew that the question about when he would return would be asked most often, he saved his answer to the disciples’ question, “When will all this happen?” for last. His answer was blunt: “No one knows; not even me.” He then pointed out that the mark of a disciple was not having inside information, but serving Christ faithfully. Spiritual vigilance, “not sleeping,” becomes the essential theme of the entire chapter. Jesus’ servants must be so busy that they have no time to speculate about his schedule.\n\n13:32 “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” NIV While Jesus had given general “signs” to observe regarding the coming of the end, he clearly explained to the disciples that the exact day or hour was not known by the angels or the Son (Jesus himself). When Jesus said that even he did not know the time of the end, he was affirming his humanity (see Philippians 2:5–8). Of course, God the Father knows the time, and Jesus and the Father are one. But when Jesus became a man, he voluntarily gave up the unlimited use of his divine attributes. On earth, Jesus laid aside his divine prerogatives and submitted to the Father’s will. Thus, only the Father knows the exact time of Jesus’ return.\n\nThe emphasis of this verse is not on Jesus’ lack of knowledge, but rather on the fact that no one knows. It is God the Father’s secret to be revealed when he wills. No one can predict by Scripture or science the exact day of Jesus’ return. Jesus was teaching that preparation, not calculation, was needed.\n\nThe desire of power in excess caused angels to fall; the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall.\n\nFrancis Bacon\n\n13:33 “Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.” NIV Because no one except the Father knows when Christ will return (you do not know points to every one of us), Jesus explained that believers must be on guard and alert, ready for his return to happen at any moment. Christ’s second coming will be swift and sudden. There will be no opportunity for last-minute repentance or bargaining. The choice that people have already made will determine their eternal destiny.\n\n13:34 “It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.” NRSV In this parable of watchfulness, Jesus described himself as a man going on a journey (literally, to another country or abroad; Jesus would be returning to heaven). The disciples are those left behind to carry on their work. The doorkeeper, another of the slaves, is commanded to keep watch for the master’s return. The slaves understand that they are in charge of themselves, had their own work to do, and would not want the master to return suddenly and find them being lazy.\n\nJESUS AND THE FATHER ARE ONE\n\nDuring his earthly life, Jesus subordinated himself to the will of his Father. He perfectly obeyed what his Father willed (see John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; 7:28; 8:29). The cult called Jehovah’s Witnesses has used these verses to attack Jesus’ divinity. Others have used similar arguments to undermine faith in Jesus. (References are quoted from NIV.)\n\nBUT in context, in his earthly ministry, Jesus took upon himself a functional subordination of his will and divine powers. During his incarnation, he was dependent upon God for his divine attributes.\n\nBUT in context, Jesus voluntarily took on limitations to accommodate his humanity. These are not limitations of his essential divinity, but only of his physical humanity.\n\nJesus and the Bible affirm the Trinity and Jesus’ essential oneness, equality, and interchangeability with God the Father. See Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; 17:21–22; 2 Corinthians 13:14.\n\nEach of us has enough assigned work to do that we shouldn’t be neutralized or paralyzed by fear or doubt. We do not need to worry about how other servants compare to us; instead, we should devote ourselves to doing what God has given us to do.\n\nPOSTPONED PREPARATIONS\n\nMonths of planning go into a wedding, the birth of a baby, a career change, a speaking engagement, the purchase of a home. Do you place the same importance on preparing for Christ’s return, the most important event in your life? Its results will last for eternity. You dare not postpone your preparations because you do not know when his return will occur. The way to prepare is to study God’s Word and live by its instructions each day; remain morally alert and avoid the spiritual lethargy Paul warned about in 1 Thessalonians 5:6; and refuse to be distracted from doing the work or fulfilling the role that God has assigned to you.\n\n13:35 “Therefore, keep awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn.” NRSV Not just the doorkeeper, but all the slaves want to keep awake. In the context of the parable, this meant that the slaves were doing their various work conscientiously. Jesus meant that none of his followers would want to be found spiritually lax, but instead conscientiously going about the work given by God for them to do.\n\nMark’s depiction of the four watches of the night (evening, midnight, cockcrow, and dawn) is another evidence of his writing for the Roman audience. This was the Roman format; Jews had only three watches of the night. The doorkeepers or guards, those on duty during their particular watches of the night, were never to be found asleep on duty. All believers must be ready and alert for Jesus’ return, working for the kingdom, both because they know of the certainty of Christ’s return and because they don’t know when that return will happen.\n\nIt is good that we believers don’t know exactly when Christ will return. If we knew the precise date, we might be tempted to be lazy in our work for Christ. Worse yet, we might plan to keep sinning and then turn to God right at the end. Heaven is not our only goal; we have work to do here. And we must keep on doing it until death or until the return of our Savior.\n\n13:36 “If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.” NIV Jesus told the disciples to keep a constant watch for his return. Although nearly two thousand years have passed since Jesus spoke these words, their truth remains: Christ is coming again, and when he returns, his followers must not be sleeping. We need to watch and be spiritually fit. This means working faithfully at the tasks God has given us. Don’t let your mind and spirit be dulled by careless living or the foolish pursuit of pleasure. Don’t let life’s anxieties overburden you. Instead, be ready to move at God’s command. Jesus’ followers should be less concerned with knowing the exact date and more concerned with being prepared—living God’s way consistently—so that no matter when Jesus comes in glory, he will claim us as his own.\n\nONE EYE OPEN\n\nMust we never sleep? We’re meant to have regular periods of real sleep, of course. We need sleep to stay alert. “Sleep” here refers to spiritual sluggishness, the kind we experience when sports consumes a Sunday, when frenzy pushes prayer aside, when books and magazines replace the Bible—and we hardly notice. In this sleep we doze away wondering, Who is God, anyhow? How does he fit in?\n\nIn all your varied interests, keep one eye peeled for Christ. Be like a smoke detector, always charged. Be like a fire station, always ready.\n\n13:37 “And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!” NKJV Jesus had spoken this discourse to only four of his disciples (13:3). Here he instructed them to carry these words to the rest of the disciples, for their truth was of vital importance. By extension, the words were meant for all believers. Even today, we do well to be on the alert, watching out for false teaching and watching expectantly for Christ’s return as we do his work in the world.\n\nSO NOW WHAT?\n\nThe entire thirteenth chapter of Mark tells us how to live while we wait for Christ’s return:\n\n• We are not to be misled by confusing claims or speculative interpretations of what will happen (13:5–6).\n\n• We should not be afraid to tell people about Christ, despite what they might say or do to us (13:9–11).\n\n• We must stand firm by faith and not be surprised by persecution (13:13).\n\n• We must be morally alert, obedient to the commands for living found in God’s Word.\n\nThis chapter was not given to promote discussions on prophetic timetables, but to stimulate right living for God in a world where he is largely ignored. Jesus’ purpose was to warn us to be prepared. Will you be ready? The only safe choice is to obey him today.\n\nwww.Upwards.Church\n\nMessage Audio/Video and Outline: https://upwards.church/watch-now/leander-campus-videos\n\nWatch Messages: YouTube-Upwards Church\n\nFacebook: Upwards Church\n\nNIV Scripture quotations marked NIV are taken from the Holy Bible, New International Version®.
