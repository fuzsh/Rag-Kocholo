FIWARE Coordinator and Chief Architect juanjose.hierro@telefonica.com, @JuanjoHierro (twitter)\n\n2. The FIWARE Public-Private Partnership (PPP)  Goal: capture opportunities derived from the new wave of digitalization of life and businesses that is coming  Strategy: Build an ecosystem that will work as catalyst for capturing the opportunities, engaging data providers and entrepreneurs  Pillars: • FI-WARE : a generic, open standard platform which serve the needs of developers in multiple domains • FIWARE Lab : a meeting point where innovation happens and data providers plus entrepreneurs can be engaged • FIWARE Ops : the suite of tools easing deployment and operation of FI-WARE instance nodes • : a program that funds developers and entrepreneurs, and ignites roll-out of the ecosystem • FIWARE mundus : reach a global footprint, opening to regions that share the same vision and ambition eHealth tourism Transport, Mobility and Logistics e-government Smart Energy Grid … 1\n\n3. What does FIWARE provide as a platform? 2\n\n4. Being “Smart” requires first being “Aware”  Implementing a Smart Application requires gathering and managing context information  Context information refers to the values of attributes characterizing entities relevant to the application 3 Boiler • Manufacturer • Last revision • Product id • temperature Users • Name-Surname • Birthday • Preferences • Location • ToDo list Flowerpot • Humidity • Watering plan Context Information Application\n\n5. Being “Smart” requires first being “Aware”  Implementing a Smart Application requires gathering and managing context information  Context information refers to the values of attributes characterizing entities relevant to the application 4 Bus • Location • No. passengers • Driver • Licence plate Citizen • Name-Surname • Birthday • Preferences • Location • ToDo list Shop • Location • Business name • Franchise • offerings Context Information Application\n\n6. Different sources of context need to be handle  Context information may come from many sources: • Existing systems • Users, through mobile apps • Sensor networks (Internet of Things)  Source of info for a given entity.attribute may vary over time 5 Place = “X”, temperature = 30º What’s the current temperature in place “X”? Standard API A sensor in a pedestrian street The Public Bus Transport Management systemA person from his smartphone It’s too hot! Notify me the changes of temperature in place “X”\n\n7. A non-intrusive approach is required  Capable to integrate with existing or future systems dealing with management of municipal services without impact in their architectures  Info about attributes of one entity may come from different systems, which work either as Context Producers or Context Providers  Applications rely on a single model adapting to systems of each city 6 Application/Service Standard API System A System B attribute “location” attribute “driver” Context Producer Context Provider\n\n8. Connecting to the Internet of Things  Capturing data from, or Acting upon, IoT devices should be as easy as to read/change the value of attributes linked to context entities 7 Context Broker Standard APIStandard API GET <Oauth token> /V1/contextEntities/flowerpot-1/attributes/humidity PUT <Oauth token> /V1/contextEntities/flowerpot- 1/attributes/status “watering” Setting up the value of attribute “status” to “watering” triggers execution of a function in the IoT device that waters the plant Issuing a get operation on the “humidity” attribute enables the application to find out whether the plant has to be watered\n\n9. Connecting to the Internet of Things  Capturing data from, or Acting upon, IoT devices should be as easy as to read/change the value of attributes linked to context entities 8 Context Broker Standard APIStandard API GET <Oauth token> /V1/contextEntities/lamp1/attributes/presenceSensor PUT <Oauth token> /V1/contextEntities/lamp1/attributes/status “light on” Setting up the value of attribute “status” to “light on” triggers execution of a function in the IoT device that switches the lamp on Issuing a get operation on the “presenceSensor” attribute enables the application to get info about presence of people near the lamp\n\n10. Context Management in FIWARE  The FIWARE Context Broker GE implements the OMA NGSI-9/10 API: a simple yet powerful standard API for managing Context information complying with the requirements of a smart city  The FIWARE NGSI API is Restful: any web/backend programmer gets quickly used to it 9 Application/Service Context Broker NGSI API Boiler • Manufacturer • Last revision • Product id • temperature Users • Name-Surname • Birthday • Preferences • Location • ToDo list Flowerpot • Humidity • Watering plan\n\n11. FIWARE NGSI: Basic interaction  Context Producers publish context information by invoking the updateContext operation on a Context Broker.  Context Consumers can retrieve context information by invoking the queryContext operation on a Context Broker 10 Bus = “X”, location = (x, y) updateContext Context Broker Context Producer Context Consumer queryContext\n\n12. FIWARE NGSI: Subscription to notifications  Context Consumers can be subscribed to reception of context information complying with certain conditions, using the subscribeContext operation a ContextBroker exports. Such subscriptions may have a duration.  The Context Broker notifies updates on context information to subscribed Context Consumers by invoking the notifyContext operation they export 11 Bus = “X”, next_stop = “A”, arrived = “Yes” updateContext (context_info) Context Broker Context Producer Context Consumer (consumer1) notifyContext (id, context_info) Id = subscribeContext (consumer1, condition, duration )\n\n13. FIWARE NGSI: Context Providers  Context Providers can be registered to the Context Broker as “holders” of certain context information.  A Context Broker will invoke the queryContext or updateContext operations exported by Context Providers whenever they are queried for, or asked to update, context information they hold 12 Bus = “X”, location = (x, y) queryContext / updateContext Context Broker Context Provider (provider-x) Context Consumer queryContext / updateContext registerContext (provider-x, registration_data, duration, id) )\n\n14. Integration with existing systems  Context adapters will be developed to interface with existing systems (e.g., municipal services management systems in a smart city) acting as Context Providers, Context Producers, or both  Some attributes from a given entity may be linked to a Context Provider while other attributes may be linked to Context Producers 13 queryContext (e1, attr1, attr2) Context Provider queryContext (e1, attr1) Context Consumer updateContext (e1, attr2) Application Context Broker System B (e.g. Transport system) System A (e.g. GIS, POIs)\n\n15. Integration with sensor networks  The FIWARE backend IoT Device Management GE enables creation and configuration of NGSI IoT Agents that connect to sensor networks  Each NGSI IoT Agent can behave as Context Consumers or Context Providers, or both 14 FIWARE Context Broker IoT Agent-1 IoT Agent-2 IoT Agent-n IoT Agent Manager create/monitor FIWARE Backend IoT Device Management OMA NGSI API (northbound interface) (southbound interfaces) MQTTETSI M2M IETF CoAP\n\n16. Open data publication Once context information is gathered, a lot of useful complementary FIWARE enablers can be used 15 Context Broker Advanced Web-based UI (AR, 3D) Data/Apps visualization Big Data AnalysisComplex Event Processing Multimedia processing\n\n17. Context Processing and Analysis 16 Applications Complex Event Processing (CEP) Context Management Processing and Analysis BigData Analysis (Hadoop- based) Context Broker Programming of rules NGSI-9/10 NGSI Context Source s Simple Processing (aggregation, averages, …) Sensor2Things\n\n18.

Smart Cities can be engines of growth  Cities are where daily life and businesses actually happen …  Smart Cities are not simply about more efficient municipality services but transforming Cities into ICT platforms enabling development of smart applications  This way, cities would transform into engines of economy growth and improvement in the well- being of citizens 31\n\n33. Why standards are relevant for Smart Cities  The current lack of standards means an impediment for the development of Smart Cities • The target market for solution and services is not large enough to attract investment • Solutions and services become tailor made, therefore expensive. • Cities get locked-in to solution/application providers  Pillars of the FIWARE programme support the creation of a sustainable ecosystem: • The FIWARE platform brings the necessary standards • The FIWARE Lab becomes the meeting point where cities meet entrepreneurs and innovation takes place • The FIWARE Acceleration programme helps to attract a first wave of developers (startups/SMEs) • The FIWARE mundus programme helps to expand globally • The FIWARE Ops suite of tools ease the task to deploy FIWARE instances 32\n\n34. Target Smart City platform  Smart city platform as a Data/Knowledge Hub  Non-intrusive, open to third parties CKAN Big Data Context Broker Accounting&Payment&Billing IDM&Auth Short-term historic data BigData Processing Data Quering/Action, Publish/Subscr Open Data publishing Real-time processing BI ETL RULES DEFINITION TOOL OPERATIONA L DASHBOARD KPI GOVERNANCE OPEN DATA PORTALS Service orchestrator Context Adapters CEP 33 IoT Backend Device Management measures / commands IoT Broker & Config Management (from sensors to things) IoT/Sens or Open Dataactuators Media streams Real Time Media Stream Processing City Services GIS Inventory Specific Enablers Generic Enablers\n\n35. How can standard Smart City data models easing common solutions be defined? The problem  Smart City apps can be ported from one Smart City to another once their platforms provide the same set of APIs, that’s why FIWARE brings a rather high value  Without standard data models, Smart City apps would need to come with adapters that transform data made available by the city so that it complies with the data model handled by the app but that has proven to be easy with OMA NGSI (overall if NGSI is at both ends)  Creation of standard Smart City data models would allow to avoid performing this kind of adaptation and make portability of Smart City apps across Smart City platforms a pretty straightforward task  How creation of these standard Smart City data models can be fostered? 34\n\n36. How can standard Smart City data models easing common solutions be defined? The solution  A “design by committee” approach would not be the best approach: • Such kind of approach has proven to be wrong in many other standardization efforts in the past • Who grants that the defined model is suitable for what apps need and developers want to have?  We need a “driven by implementation” approach: • Identify real applications that solve a real problem and cities would like to see running in their cities • Check what data models they have been designed to work with and take them as input • Carry out a “data curation” process where input data models converge into a single common model  You will end with a set of standard data models and soon a portfolio of killer Smart City apps working! 35\n\n37. How can standard Smart City data models easing common solutions be defined? FIWARE  The FIWARE Accelerator program enables to identify killer Smart City apps developed by entrepreneurs • These applications can serve as basis for definition of a standard set of Smart City data models and drive curation process • Involvement in this process becomes also an incentive for the entrepreneurs to join the program (“I want to influence the standard so that my app can easily align with it”, “I want to provide one of the first example applications”) • There are 80 M€ for entrepreneurs that can be put at work!  Cities would play a key role: • Their data models will be contrasted/analyzed against those coming from the apps and other cities • They would get involved in the data curation process  Liason with other initiatives that may contribute 36\n\n38. Open and Agile Smart Cities initiative  Launch of the Open and Agile Smart at CeBIT: • Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg • Finland: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Oulu, Tampere, Turku • Spain: Valencia, Santander, Málaga, Sevilla • Portugal: Porto, Lisbon, Fundão, Palmela, Penela and Águeda • Belgium: Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp • Italy: Milan, Palermo and Lecce • Brazil: Olinda (Recife), Anapólis (Goiás), Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), Vitória (Espírito Santo), Colinas de Tocantins (Tocantins) and Taquaritinga (São Paulo)  Other countries and cities welcome to join !  Some of them already in the pipeline 37 (*) Ordered by country and date of incorporation\n\n39. Open & Agile Smart Cities initiative principles  API: Adoption of a lightweight, open-licene standard API to gather, publish, query and subscribe-to in-time context information describing the state of the city. Specifically, the FIWARE NGSI API will serve as a first common API which the supporters will implement.  Data model: Adoption of a simple initial standard data model required for effective interoperability when exchanging context information. Specifically, CitySDK, which is available through the FIWARE NGSI API, functions as a basis  Open Data Platform: Adoption of a flexible, easily-distributable open data publication platform which any organisation can set up at a low cost if it is not already being used. Specifically, CKAN will serve as the initial standard platform for publication of datasets or NGSI API resources. CKAN is already integrated and extended as part of the FIWARE Reference Architecture 38\n\n40. Open & Agile Smart Cities initiative principles  Approach: Adoption of a “driven by implementation” approach towards experimental consolidation of initial standard data models as well as specification of new standard data models. The goal is that communities and developers can (1) co-create their services based on basic but commonly-defined data models, (2) influence the definition of new models by implementing and experimenting, and (3) help “curate” existing data models. Specifically, this will mean engaging organisations and communities, leveraging relevant initiatives, e.g. startups/SMEs selected through the FIWARE Accelerator Programme (projects focused on Smart Cities), the OrganiCity Experimentation-as-a-Service facility and open calls, Code for Europe and/or other relevant programmes, including national networks, that may help to engage wider communities of stakeholders and developers. It will also mean leveraging the FIWARE Lab, OrganiCity facility etc. as joint, major hubs for experimentation with the proposed APIs, data models and platforms 39\n\n41. The way ahead 40 FIWARE = Open APIs for Smart Cities CitySDK = FIWARE APIs + Standard Data Models for Smart Cities Open & Agile Smart Cities = cities building City SDK by following a driven by implementation approach"
