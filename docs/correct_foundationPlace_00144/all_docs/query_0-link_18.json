        "text": "1. Aalto Telecom Forum Smart Cities: IoT Service Creation Paul Houghton Director, Wizardry and Development Futurice\n\n2. The World is Just a Giant Reactive Hashmap\n\n3. We create digital services and products for people to love. • Founded in 2000 • 300 employees from 18 countries • 8th year in a row profitable growth • YOY growth 30%\n\n5. Business Successful IoT Service Great UX Easier Seamless Ecosystem Integrated Much Better Real Open Useful Service Design Technology\n\n6. LSC is a multi-disciplinary way of working that maximizes the probability of creating successful digital services Lean Service Creation\n\n7. Our toolbox\n\n8. Innovation World View Design & Business General Specific Tech Bottom up vs Top Down\n\n10. Bottom Up Example: Networking Traditional Cloud Cheap and easy IP Works anywhere Address by DNS Local Cloud New and strange, more work but.. Bluetooth LE and WIFI Faster and more reliable Phone, IoT device Address by name/function Content Centric Networking Combine with traditional cloud\n\n11. Top Down Example: Disneyland Business: I want people to spend more money and not realize they are doing it Designer: I want something cool to make your experience magical and effortless\n\n12. From the first email sent in 1971 to control your home from your mobile it has been a fast ride.\n\n15. IoT = Internet of Things Two Supply Drivers: 1. Single Board Computer Price 2. Wireless Price\n\n19. IoT = Internet of Things Two Demand Drivers: 1. Economics 2. UX\n\n20. IoT = Internet of Things Two Demand Drivers: 1. Economics 2. UX\n\n21. The next generation of services will make use of more than one connection EmotionalPhysicalWireless\n\n23. PUBLIC SQUARE CONFERENCE NEIGHBORHOOD SMART BUILDING / SMART HOME SUPERMARKET Hyperlocal Marketing, Accessibility, Transportation… Networking, Multimedia, Knowledge Sharing… Marketing, Customer Care, Navigation, Support…Smart Cities, Transportation, Cultural, Community… Scenarios & Blueprints\n\n26. Great. But is IoT really different from mobile? Can’t I just keep designing and building services like I always have?\n\n27. Good IoTss services are fundamentally different Physical + Digital = If: 1. Fast 2. Reliable 3. Intuitive\n\n28. Good IoTss services are fundamentally different Physical + Digital = If: 1. Fast 2. Reliable 3. Intuitive 4. Trusted\n\n30. Services are inside everything The tech is just a tool So Ask yourself: what world do you want to live in?\n\n32. Smart Cities New Connections: The City as an Open Ecosystem\n\n34. How can we create a city where everyone can be an active part of it?\n\n35. How can we create a city where people own and control their own data?\n\n36. How can we create a city where businesses prosper by having rich, instant access to everyone?\n\n37. Open Protocol BUSINESS Services Start-Ups Small Businesses COMMUNITY Makers Entrepreneurs Non-Profit Org. OPEN, REAL-TIME MARKET FOR COMPANIES AND THE COMMUNITY OPT-IN CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PRIVATE, SECURE SERVICES Sensors Live-Data Human InputInfrastructure CITY HUB\n\n38. “Thing Browser”\n\n41. • Real Time Awareness about services in the city • More efficient and tailored services • Privacy & Security - Control of their own data • Increases trust and transparency of the city Benefits Citizen\n\n43. Please pick me up at Reuter Street, 55 Berlin\n\n44. In a Smart City Ecosystem collaboration is essential Break the silos Data Protection Policies Collaboration Models\n\n45. Yes. But which tech will win? What should I look for? • Heterogeneous, open standards • Local cloud + traditional cloud • Local examples: Bluetooth LE / WiFi Aware / 5G D2D • No single point of failure • No single point of control • Continuous connection is not required • Online/offline no longer exist – just best effort and caching • Users in control Trust yourself, not an external service provider • Zero touch ad-hock wireless connections Trust the content itself, not the connection, not the source\n\n46. How do we organize this? 5 Ways to Organize Information (LATCH) 1. Location 2. Alphabet 3. Time 4. Category 5. Hierarchy\n\n47. How do we organize this? 5 Ways to Organize Information (LATCH) 1. Location 2. Alphabet 3. Time 4. Category 5. Hierarchy Hash\n\n48. How do we simplify this? Simple = Easily observed cause->effect relationships 1. Location cause->space->effect Spatial complexity 2. Alphabet cause->sequences->effect Sequential complexity 3. Time cause->time->effect Temporal complexity 4. Category cause->types->effect Heterogeneous complexity 5. Hierarchy cause->structures->effect Hierarchical complexity\n\n49. How do we simplify this? The world is a giant hash map that is… 1. Location cause->space->effect Distributed 2. Alphabet cause->sequences->effect Unordered 3. Time cause->time->effect Cached 4. Category cause->types->effect Type-neutral 5. Hierarchy cause->structures->effect Flat and democratic\n\n50. How do we simplify this? Look for best-effort, fully decentralized, democratic solutions: Information Centric Networking (ICN) Content Centric Networking (CCN) Named Functional Networking (NFN)\n\n51. Here & Now • Thing browser • Indoor maps and cards UI for finding and controlling • Initial focus on office environment • Secure, only available when physically in the office • Private, no records • Real-time database, ad-hoc content-centric network • Open source (coming to Github, not yet published) • End-to-end reactive using http://reactivecascade.com\n\n53. So: An IoT NFN is Just a Giant Reactive Hashmap a1 = Hash((Integer) methane_level_restroom_a) a2 = Hash((Boolean) availability_restroom_a) .. bathrooms = Hash(set(a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2)) bestBathroom = Hash(“(Bathrooms br) -> availableBathroom(br) -> nicestBathroom(br) -> nearest(br)”) bathrooms.subscribe(bestBathroom) .subscribe(myMap)"
