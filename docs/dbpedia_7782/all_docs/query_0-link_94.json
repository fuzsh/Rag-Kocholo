        "text": "This episode of the Popperian Podcast features an interview that Jed Lea-Henry conducted with Jeremy Shearmur. They speak about the time that Jeremy spent working with Karl Popper at the London School of Economics, the seeds of classical liberalism within Popper’s epistemology, the role for free markets as constant feedback mechanisms for the consent of people, the failure of politics to achieve this level of responsiveness, how Friedrich Hayek’s views differ from Popper’s and where Popper was influenced by Hayek, the problems/challenges that face classical liberalism, and the future direction of classical liberalism.\n\nJeremy Shearmur was educated at the London School of Economics, where he also worked as Popper’s assistant. He subsequently taught philosophy at Edinburgh, political theory at Manchester, and was Director of Studies at the Centre for Policy Studies in London. He then worked as a Research Associate Professor at the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University, and subsequently taught political theory and then philosophy at the Australian National University. He is now retired from the ANU as an Emeritus Fellow and is living in Dumfries in Scotland, where he is still very much engaged in academic work. He is the author of ‘Hayek and After’ and ‘The Political Thought of Karl Popper’, and for anyone interested in his ongoing lecture series on Karl Popper and critical rationalism, Jeremy can be reached at: jeremy.shearmur@fallowfield.info\n\nFor enquiries not related to the lecture series or upcoming conferences, please instead use: Jeremy.Shearmur@anu.edu.au\n\nSupport via Patreon – https://www.patreon.com/jedleahenry\n\nSupport via PayPal – https://www.paypal.me/jrleahenry\n\nShop – https://shop.spreadshirt.com.au/JLH-shop/\n\nSupport via Bitcoin - 31wQMYixAJ7Tisp773cSvpUuzr2rmRhjaW\n\nWebsite – The Popperian Podcast — Jed Lea-Henry\n\nLibsyn – The Popperian Podcast (libsyn.com)\n\nYoutube – The Popperian Podcast - YouTube\n\nTwitter – https://twitter.com/jedleahenry\n\nRSS - https://popperian-podcast.libsyn.com/rss\n\n*** Underlying artwork by Arturo Espinosa"
