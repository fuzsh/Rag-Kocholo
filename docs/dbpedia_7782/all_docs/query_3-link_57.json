        "text": "Service during World War II\n\nRobbins served in both world wars; he was wounded as an artillery officer in the First War and worked as an economist very near the seat of power during the Second. He started as one of the economists attached to the War Office, his more noticeable contribution was helping establish war rationing of consumption goods to a point system. He then became the Director of the Economic Section in the underground warren of offices under Whitehall from where Churchill directed the war. These offices can be paid an enthralling visit today. He was material to transforming the British economy into an effective war machine.\n\nAround 1943 he increased his collaboration with Keynes, who was working at the Treasury nearby, principally on the design of the economy of the post-war world. With the other economists of the group, he had to travel frequently to the United States. With Keynes, he made a signal contribution to the British side at Bretton Woods. When the war ended he helped negotiate the American loan, whose intent was to help the United Kingdom to keep a fixed exchange with the dollar, despite the UK’s twin deficits of the balance of payments and the budget. The loan was frittered away in trying to keep the pound at the over-valued rate. Luckily, the Marshall Plan intervened and the United Kingdom together with the other European allies received large additional fund for reconstruction.\n\nThe History of Economic Thought\n\nDuring his 1950 sabbatical year Robbins engaged on a new line of research and publication, where he excelled: the history of economics. He had had an abiding interest in the past of the subject, witness his initiative of having the School republish classical texts. He started teaching the subject in 1953. His first book in this field was The Theory of Economic Policy in English Classical Political Economy (1952) where he undid the usual presentation of the Classical School as a single orthodox movement for non-interventionism. He reinforced this line of thought with Robert Torrens and the Evolution of Classical Economics (1958), a book that was special in many ways. It underlined Colonel Torrens’s discrepancies and coincidences with other economists of the time. It threw a new light on the evolution of economic analysis, especially in the field of international trade. And it was an outstanding exercise in scholarship. He later published The Theory of Economic Development in the classical period (1968), when growth and development were becoming hot topics. His work was a paragon of historical empathy without falling into the temptation of doctrinaire anachronism. I was lucky to attend his LSE lectures on the history of economic thought and have read with great pleasure the publication of the notes of this course by [Warren J.] Samuels and [Steven G.] Medema (1998). All these, I must say, were precious lessons for the historian I was trying to be.\n\nThe arts and other occupations\n\nOne of the outstanding traits of Robbins’s personality was his love of the arts—paintings, the opera, the ballet were not only enjoyed but the object of his administrative care. He was immensely knowledgeable; he cared deeply for that part of civilised life. I especially remember a visit to the Prado in his company and that of Iris his wife. Among other requests his principal wish was to see Rogier van der Weyden’s “Descent from the Cross”. He stood transfixed before that supreme work for a long time and I saw tears welling up in his eyes.\n\nAt some point in his life he was Chairman of the National Gallery, a trustee of the Tate Gallery, the Director of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden. His contributions to these institutions were not only based on his vision and good taste but also on his excellent relations with Governments and civil servants and the administrative capabilities he had honed during his war service.\n\nThis was not all. He was also simultaneously Chairman of the Financial Times and a director of British Petroleum, while he went on presiding the Economics Department at LSE, with all the administrative and academic work that implied. He took it all in his stride but the University. Authorities decided he had to give up his chair, a move that made him very unhappy. There was more to this move than meets the eye: a number of the economists at LSE thought that Robbins’s conception of economics was somewhat passé and that the School had to move into the mainstream by becoming much more mathematical and econometric.\n\nThe ‘Troubles’\n\nThough Robbins had spent most of his adult life connected with LSE, he had to give up his professorship, as related above, and when nearing seventy simply kept giving some lectures there. It is ironic for an educator so caring for the cultural and professional aims of University that he should have been involved again in the School’s affairs during the ‘troubles’ of 1966/7 and 1968/9. In those years the Universities of the English speaking world went through a time of conflict, which in 1968 spread to France and Germany. At LSE they took the form of objections by the more radical students to the appointment of a new director, whom they accused of racialism. Robbins was Chairman of the Court of Governors during the second period of troubles coinciding with demonstrations against the Vietnam War, matters came to such a pass that the School had to be closed for twenty five days. This was a bitter pill to swallow, later sweetened by the success of the Appeal for a new Library. That facility was named after him and is now in full swing.\n\nHe crowned his life as an economist and a historian with a last book: Political Economy, Past & Present (1976), where he reviewed the leading theories of economic policy. And in 1998, as I said, the notes of his course on the history of economic thought were published, much to the satisfaction of those of us who had had the pleasure of attending along the years.\n\nThe Old Lion\n\nI hope I have painted Lionel Robbins’s portrait ‘warts and all’ but recalled the reasons for his greatness. A mane of hair that had turned white when I met him crowned his imposing figure. His strong carrying voice had traces of earthiness as became the son of a farmer. He spoke with clarity and conviction and, as many said who knew him, he had a capacity for concentration and a prodigious memory that helped him in the many intellectual battles that he waged in his academic, political, corporate, and administrative posts. His ability for lucid exposition, elegant and precise pen, outstanding capacity for marshalling evidence and argument, great powers of concentration and memory, contributed to making him the outstanding public figure he became.\n\nIn his way he was an arch-establishment figure but one that never sounded hollow. He truly understood and respected the civilisation in which he was born and grew. He loved paintings, opera and ballet and was able to help reform and finance the museums and theatres that he advised and directed with the same effectiveness as he applied to his war service. A restrained sense of beauty shone through his prose and increased its power.\n\nAs an historian he was a meticulous scholar who did not commit the solecisms of so many of his peers, who today for example invent denominations such as ‘neo-Keynesian’ that Keynes would have repined at.\n\nAs an economist, which is after all what he essentially was, his achievements were mixed though he may have been less out of line than he appears today. He was an inspiring teacher and lecturer. He was a political economist who did use statistics to understand and predict the situations he studied. He is out of favour today because he shunned using mathematics, his models were verbal, and he was born too early to incorporate econometrics to his reasoning. It is a pity that on some crucial questions he moved away from the Austrian School of his youth. For example, his famous definition of economics as the science which studies the relationship between given ends and scarce means with alternative uses lacks the dimension that Hayek would underline in his 1945 on “The Use of Knowledge in Society”, that ends may be unformulated and means undiscovered, and that therefore economic calculation was far from an engineering problem. Again, his move nearer to Keynes during WWII by stressing aggregate demand as the mover of the economy was a plain mistake that Mises could have warned him against.\n\nLet me conclude that I was indeed lucky to have him as a mentor."
