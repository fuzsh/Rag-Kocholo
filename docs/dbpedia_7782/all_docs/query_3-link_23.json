        "text": "For 125 years, research has been at the heart of LSE’s teaching and engagement with the world. In this series, we’ve paired up four of our historical figures with four early career academics, reflecting continuity and change across the years.\n\nKarl Popper shaped 20th century philosophy of science in many ways, and also produced one of the most powerful critiques of totalitarianism ever written, The Open Society and Its Enemies.\n\nWhat stands out for me is how his social and political philosophy and his philosophy of science are intricately connected. He found the roots of totalitarianism partly in bad (social) science. And he proposed that critical public scrutiny is key in a democracy just as critical scrutiny of theories is crucial in science. This marriage of philosophy of science and social, moral and political philosophy is something that still characterises the work of many of us in the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method that Popper founded, and something that makes the department unique.\n\nGiven that social sciences, in particular, shape public decision-making, philosophical scrutiny of the science and philosophical analysis of the decision-making and resulting social conditions should go hand in hand. That’s also the spirit in which I teach the Philosophy of Economics, and Philosophy for Public Policy at LSE.\n\nMy own research, too, bridges philosophy of science, practical rationality, and moral and political philosophy. In particular, I am interested in both methodological and normative questions at the intersection of philosophy and economics. For instance, in my recent work I have been interested in attitudes to risk. On a methodology level, I consider to what extent and in what way different economic theories under their different interpretations can accommodate aversion to taking risk. I am further interested in whether aversion to taking risks is rationally and morally permissible. And lastly, I study how risk ought to be managed in public policy.\n\nIn the future, I look forward to seeing the new BSc in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at LSE, of which I am programme director, further flourish. As senior co-chair of the Women’s Caucus of the European Philosophy of Science Association, I also care deeply about making philosophy and academia more generally more welcoming to women."
