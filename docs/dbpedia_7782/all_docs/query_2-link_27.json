        "text": "If anything like a change in direction can be distinguished in the development of the work of Friedrich August von Hayek, it does not lie in his supposed abandoning of the idea of equilibrium (which is based on a mistaken interpretation of his work). It is rather the transition of a radically systematic approach to problems and the elaboration of their solution that is characterized by a high level of analytic sophistication to a more associative approach. Examples of the former are Hayek’s theory of mind and his monetary, business cycle and capital theories; his theory of evolution and social and political philosophy are examples of the latter. Hayek’s economics constitutes a research programme. One of the factors that influenced its further development was Sraffa’s criticism of Hayek’s Prices and Production. In reply to this, Hayek developed his highly sophisticated capital theory and his ideas on neutral money and the international monetary order. I intend to show that the development of Hayek’s economic research programme can only be understood if one takes into account his radically systematic and analytical approach. ADDED COMMENT The paper has “radical ECONOMIST” in the title because I wanted to point out to the audience of the Department of Economics of NYU that the almost generally accepted idea that Hayek’s theory of capital is fatally flawed is wrong. It is one of the (alas!) several red herrings that keep freely swimming in the sea of Hayek research. In the early 1930s Piero Sraffa critized Hayek’s Prices and Production. One of his criticisms was that Hayek had not taken account of the fact that every factor of production has its “own rate of interest.” Hayek took this criticism seriously and with the thoroughness that is characteristic of all his work in all of the various disciplines – at least up till the publication of The Sensory Order in 1952 - set out to solve the problem Sraffa had indicated. That led to a series of articles and eventually The Pure Theory of Capital, in which he had meticulously constructed a highly abstract theory takes into account each productive input's own rate of interest. Hayek showed how entrepreneurial decisions on investment process involve all these own rates. The paper shows that this type of radicalism characterizes the rest of Hayek’s work, too. This more than once became a case of the better being the enemy of the good: because Hayek did not succeed in solving the (often very difficult) problems he had put on his agenda at all, or not in time, he either decided not to publish his attempt to solve it (in the case of his reply to Popper’s criticism of The Sensory Order – see my paper on “How artificial is intelligence in AI?”) or it was too late for the scientific community to take notice (the case of Sraffa’s criticism).\n\nKarl Popper and Friedrich von Hayek became close friends soon after they first met in the early 1930s. Ever since, they discussed their ideas intensively on many occasions. But even though an analysis of the origins and contents of their ideas and correspondence reveals a number of important and fundamental differences, they rarely criticize each other in their published work. The article analyzes in particular the different ideas they have on the role of reason in society and on rationalism and the roots of these differences. Popper’s “Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition” of 1948 contains a criticism of Hayek’s idea—published, for instance, in “Individualism: True and False” of 1945—that we must accept tradition without trying to change it. An analysis of the differences between the two authors touches on topics such as the possibility of public intervention in society, the role of social science in this, the methodology of social science, and the differences between liberalism and social democracy. The article concludes with some possible explanations for Popper and Hayek downplaying their differences in public. The fact remains that they never resolved the tension between Popper’s critical rationalism and Hayek’s conservative rationalism."
