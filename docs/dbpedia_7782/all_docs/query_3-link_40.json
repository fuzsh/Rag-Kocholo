        "text": "Friedrich Hayek is renowned for his epistemological contributions to political economy, namely that unconscious knowledge is dispersed throughout society. Such knowledge, for Hayek, is only utilized when the free market establishes a “spontaneous order” within the bounds of constitutional rules based upon a principle of protecting property and negative liberty. Consequently, Hayek's epistemology has been explored in a voluminous literature, the vast majority of which deems him to be some form of positivist.Footnote 2 A recent turn, however, has questioned Hayek's scientific status by drawing attention to moral and theological aspects of his work.Footnote 3 The problem is that neither of these two positions is able to account for the other without ignoring significant aspects of Hayek's thought, contriving “phases,” or adopting an implausible deus ex machina such that his continuous and extensive forays into a range of scientific fields were supposedly entirely driven by a desire to disguise ideology as science.Footnote 4\n\nI propose that both positions misunderstand Hayek's philosophy of science because of their common failure to take seriously both the scientific and spiritual aspects of Hayek's work. Employing an intellectual-historical approach, we see that Hayek thought his science was “true” science precisely because of its moral, metaphysical, and spiritualistic aspects.Footnote 5 Hayek's epistemology did not pretend to be “scientific” by feigning neutrality or objectivity; rather it upheld the validity of value judgments, intuition, metaphysical beliefs, and even ideology. Though valid in scientific inquiry, these were by no means equally “true”; some produced a more accurate description of the world. Examples discussed in this article—methodological individualism, psychological theories that (from introspection) affirmed individuals as distinct wholes, and Wittgenstein's mature work—show that Hayek was most convinced by work that was consciously value-laden and that refused to discredit what we cannot observe.\n\nSince his first academic essay in 1920, Hayek aligned his view with schools of thought that were considerably more metaphysical than the Viennese empiricist tradition that many scholars seek to place him in, namely nineteenth-century post-Kantian philosophical psychology, the Berlin school of Gestalt psychology, vitalism, and Husserlian phenomenology.Footnote 6 Throughout his academic life, Hayek thought humans had to be studied in light of their unique purposiveness, “vital processes,” and “entire being.” This, I propose, was a metaphysical view that closely coincided with the praxeology of his mentor and friend, Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973). Mises maintained an a priori belief in human purposiveness, arguing that “action is the essence of his nature and existence, his means of preserving his life.”Footnote 7 Returning to psychology after his polemical works against economic planning in the 1940s, Hayek was aware that professing his metaphysical views might put him “at the risk of being condemned with Professor Mises as holding views conflicting with the whole trend of modern scientific development.”Footnote 8 Despite this fear, and his ambition to bring the “whole trend of modern scientific development” with him, he never hid his metaphysical views. To the contrary, he tried to use the language of modern scientific development to demonstrate that his metaphysical views were conducive to science as a pursuit of truth.\n\nThis project culminated in what I consider a landmark work—“Rules, Perception and Intelligibility” (1962)—in which Hayek divided “nature” into the physical part that is less complex than our minds, and the “supernatural” part that is more complex than our minds and therefore autonomous, inexplicable, and almost entirely inaccessible. He situated humans and their science in the middle. Science, for Hayek, only made sense to the extent that its practitioners posit the existence of a higher entity that (1) lays down the basic rules according to which our minds and the world operate, and (2) provides humans with a unique complexity, purposiveness, and epistemic position from which they can explain the physical world and—to a very limited extent—each other. Hayek thought his metaphysical science offered a more accurate description of the world, but crucially of a world in which order, freedom, and purpose necessarily exist. More specifically, Hayek's science affirmed an ordained order to the universe and human actions, freedom for the individual within that order, and purpose or meaning in the dual sense that each individual has a place in the order and that there is meaning behind each and every individual action.\n\nWith regard to humanity's epistemic position, Hayek thought that if a scientist wants to claim that their investigations in some way correspond to reality, then they posit the existence of something closely akin to “God” whether they think so or not. Why, then, do I not call his science theological? Hayek held strong religious beliefs as a child, but lost faith in a Christian God when, at the age of fourteen, he asked several priests what God is and found their responses unsatisfactory.Footnote 9 In later life, Hayek identified as “agnostic.”Footnote 10 He never ruled out the existence of an entity with some of the characteristics that we attribute to God, but he did not believe in any doctrinal concepts of such an entity, or at least not in any of those he was aware of.Footnote 11 He predominantly used the terms “supra-conscious order” and “supra-conscious system” to refer to a supersystem that was considerably larger than “spontaneous order” or “cultural evolution” because it governed the regularities in nonorganic and organic matter, as well as providing the grounds for consciousness itself.Footnote 12\n\nTo demonstrate the above, I focus on Hayek's writings on humanity's intention and capacity to explain the world. Consequently, it is necessary to put Hayek's endorsements of specific institutions, religions, or economic arrangements to one side in this article. We can only hope to properly understand those views, their origins, and their potential appeal when we first concentrate on the spiritual aspects of Hayek's science itself."
