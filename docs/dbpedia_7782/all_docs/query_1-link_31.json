        "text": "John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich August Hayek were two prominent economists of the Great Depression era with sharply contrasting views. The arguments they had in the 1930s have been revived in the wake of the latest global financial crisis.\n\nThe contemporary relevance of their ideas has even been debated in a rap video, external. More than 1,000 people attended a BBC Radio 4 debate at the London School of Economics to hear supporters of the two economists argue their case.\n\nUnlike Keynes, Hayek believed that genuine recovery from a post-boom crash called not just for adequate spending, but for a return to sustainable production - production purged of boom-era distortions caused by easy money.\n\nHayek was dismissed as someone who wanted to \"liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers,\" and so on.\n\nBut an unsustainable boom is one after which some things really do need liquidating. The straightforward recipe for the revival of healthy investment following the 2008 crisis was to liquidate.\n\nLiquidate Bear Stearns! Liquidate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac!\n\nLiquidate, in short, the whole sub-prime bubble-blowing apparatus that was nurtured by easy monetary policy.\n\nThat would have meant letting insolvent banks that lent or invested unwisely go bust.\n\nBut instead our governments chose to keep bad banks going and that is why quantitative easing has proven a failure.\n\nQuantitative easing failed because almost all the new money the government created has gone to shore up the balance sheets of irresponsible bankers.\n\nNow those banks sit on piles of idle cash while other businesses starve or cannot get started for want of credit.\n\nThe economy is like a drunk throwing up the morning after the night before.\n\nIt is disgorging itself - or trying to disgorge itself - of bad investments it was tempted to undertake largely because of easy money.\n\nGiving it still more money will not prevent the inevitable suffering.\n\nIt might mask or delay it somewhat, but only at the cost of more suffering later.\n\nThis is not the sort of advice that governments welcome.\n\nThey want a painless, easy cure like the one Keynesians offer.\n\nBut, as Hayekians warned again and again, there is no painless recovery from an unsustainable boom.\n\nThe only way to have no pain is to avoid the boom itself.\n\nThe Great Depression, external bottomed out at the end of 1932, with British unemployment having reached 20%, American unemployment even higher.\n\nKeynes wrote the General Theory in 1936 to explain why the recovery was so feeble.\n\nHis revolutionary proposition was that following a big shock - usually a collapse in investment - there were no automatic recovery forces in a market economy.\n\nThe economy would go on shrinking until it reached some sort of stability at a low level.\n\nKeynes called this position \"under-employment equilibrium\".\n\nThe reason was that the level of activity - output and employment - depended on the level of aggregate demand or spending power.\n\nIf spending power shrank, output would shrink.\n\nIn this situation it was the government's job to increase its own spending to offset the decline in public spending - that is by running a deficit to whatever extent necessary.\n\nTo cut government spending was completely the wrong policy in a slump.\n\nWhen an economy is booming, a hair shirt at the Treasury is the right policy, when it is stagnating it is the wrong policy.\n\nKeynes's message was: you cannot cut your way out of a slump; you have to grow your way out.\n\nEighty years on we have still not fully learnt the lesson.\n\nThree years after the collapse of 2008, our economy is flat: there are no signs of growth, nor can the Osborne policy of a thousand cuts produce any.\n\nIt was Friedrich Hayek, who represented the orthodox theories which Keynes attacked.\n\nAccording to Hayek the main cause of slumps was excessive credit creation by the banks leading to overspending.\n\nThe boom was the illusion; the slump the reality.\n\nThe situation following an injection of money by the banking system would be similar to that of a people on an isolated island, if, after having partially constructed an enormous machineâ¦ they found they had exhausted all their savings before the new machine could turn out its products.\n\nThey would then have no choice but to abandon, temporarily, the work on the new process and to devote all their labour to producing their daily bread without any capital.\n\nThat is, go back to growing their own food - much as the Russians did when their economy collapsed in the early 1990s.\n\nKeynes was scathing in his comment on Hayek's book, Prices and Production, which he called \"one of the most frightful muddles I have ever read\".\n\n\"It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end in Bedlam.\"\n\nHayek gave up serious economics, though not serious writing.\n\nHe and Keynes developed a wary respect, and even liking, for each other. \"We get on very well in private life\", Keynes wrote. \"But what rubbish his theory is.\"\n\nKeynes's magnetism made a deep impression on Hayek, but he never stopped believing that his influence on economics was \"both miraculous and tragic\".\n\nThe Keynes vs Hayek debate will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, 3 August at 20:00 BST and will repeated on Saturday, 6 August at 22:15 BST.
