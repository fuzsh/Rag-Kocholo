        "text": "Dino De Laurentiis, the Italian film producer who became a legend with movies such as Serpico, Death Wish and Hannibal, has died. He was 91.\n\nDe Laurentiis died Wednesday in Los Angeles surrounded by family, according to his daughter, Raffaella De Laurentiis. No cause of death has been released.\n\nHe won an Oscar for producing Federico Fellini's film La Strada in 1957 and was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial award for lifetime achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2001.\n\n\"Cinema has lost one of its greats,\" said Walter Veltroni, former mayor of Rome and a founder of the International Rome Film Festival.\n\n\"The name of Dino De Laurentiis is tied to the history of cinema,\" he told the AFP news agency.\n\nDe Laurentiis began his career at age 20 in Italy, working with Carlo Ponti and Roberto Rossellini. He hit it big with Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice) in 1949.\n\nIn the 1950s, he saw the potential of reaching an international market and worked on epic films such as Ulysses with Kirk Douglas and War and Peace with Audrey Hepburn. Simultaneously, he was working with New Wave Italian directors such as Fellini.\n\nHe went on to build a studio in Rome called Dinocitta, hoping to rival the city's famous Cinecitta facility. He produced successes such as Barbarella and Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die, but also suffered a string of flops that resulted in financial difficulties.\n\nIn the 1970s, he moved to the U.S., where he formed the Di Laurentiis Entertainment Group in North Carolina. The studio made films such as Conan the Barbarian, Three Days of the Condor, Ragtime and Blue Velvet.\n\nDe Laurentiis is associated with adaptations of Stephen King novels, such as The Dead Zone and Silver Bullet, as well as four of the Hannibal Lecter films, including Manhunter, Hannibal and Red Dragon.\n\nHe produced more than 160 films in a career that stretched from the 1940s to 2007 and became known for huge spectacle films. He particularly like backing film adaptations of popular novels, such as the sci-fi series Dune and Barabbas.\n\nEver the entrepreneur, he took huge risks with some of his projects and was forced to sell DEG Studios because of economic conditions in 1989.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Martha, their two children and three daughters from his first marriage to actor Silvana Mangano. He lost his son, Federico, in a 1981 plane crash."
