        "text": "Italy's Oscar-winning film producer Dino De Laurentiis, famed for bringing larger-than-life characters ranging from King Kong to Hannibal Lecter to the big screen, has died aged 91.\n\nDe Laurentiis, who worked with some of Italy's best-known directors such as Federico Fellini and Roberto Rossellini before breaking into Hollywood, died in Los Angeles after being gravely ill for several weeks.\n\nDe Laurentiis's nephew Aurelio, also a well-known producer, confirmed his uncle's death as he spoke to reporters in Rome ahead of his departure for the funeral in the United States.\n\n\"Cinema has lost one of its greats,\" said Walter Veltroni, an Italian politician and former mayor of Rome who founded the Rome Film Festival.\n\n\"The name of Dino De Laurentiis is tied to the history of cinema,\" he said.\n\nDe Laurentiis produced more than 500 films over his career, working with some of the biggest names in European film as well as Hollywood.\n\nHe started out in film aged just 20 and became one of the leading producers of Italy's post-war cinema boom and the neo-realist genre.\n\nOne of the first films he produced was Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice) by Giuseppe De Santis - a 1949 classic and one of the best examples of neo-realism.\n\nHe won an Oscar in 1956 for Fellini's La Strada and went on to be nominated another 38 times.\n\nIn 2001, he received the Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award at the Oscars for demonstrating \"a consistently high quality of motion picture production\".\n\nIn the 1960s De Laurentiis built a film studio near Rome known as Dinocitta - after the famous Cinecitta - that was inaugurated by US director John Huston.\n\nHis work became increasingly in demand in Hollywood and he enjoyed box office success with Serpico with Al Pacino in 1973, Three Days Of The Condor with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway in 1975, King Kong in 1976 and Ridley Scott's Hannibal in 2001.\n\nHowever not all of his movies were hits.\n\nHis 1984 science-fiction film Dune, written and directed by David Lynch, was a commercial flop and was slammed by critics.\n\nDe Laurentiis was born on August 8, 1919 in Torre Annunziata near Naples and moved to the United States in the early 1970s. His parents were pasta makers.\n\nHe married Silvana Mangano, the star of Riso Amaro and one of the beauties of her day. They had four children together before divorcing.\n\nIn 1981, his son died in an plane accident in Alaska.\n\nDe Laurentiis's nephew Aurelio is also a well-known producer in Italy and his granddaughter, Giada, is a US chef and host of a program on the Food Network.\n\nIn 2003, he won a lifetime achievement award at the Venice Film Festival."
