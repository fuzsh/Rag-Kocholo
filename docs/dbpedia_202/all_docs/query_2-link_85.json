He was 91.\n\nIn a separate statement, his granddaughter, celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis, said, \"My grandfather was a true inspiration. He was my biggest champion in life and a constant source for wisdom and advice. I will miss him dearly.\"\n\nDe Laurentiis produced more than 160 films and was nominated for 35 Oscars. He won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film for 1954's \"La Strada,\" directed by fellow Italian Federico Fellini, according to imdb.com.\n\nHe produced the Jane Fonda cult classic \"Barbarella\" in 1968 and moved to the United States shortly after, according to Digital Spy.\n\nHe also had a reputation for backing big-budget bombs, but there were many successes, both critically and at the box office.\n\nAmong his credits are \"Serpico,\" \"Three Days of the Condor,\" \"Flash Gordon,\" \"Dune\" and the 1976 remake of \"King Kong.\"\n\nHe did not produce \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in 1991 but did take charge of sequels \"Hannibal\" and \"Hannibal Rising,\" according to DigitalSpy."
