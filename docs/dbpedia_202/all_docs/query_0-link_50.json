        "text": "Infamously bad erotic thriller is more notable at this point for its amazing imdb trivia page than anything that happens in it.\n\nExamples:\n\n-Madonna's acting coach quit just before production began, claiming that \"she thinks she knows everything\". (Believable and hilarious)\n\n-Madonna had five personal assistants for this film, including her own hairstylist, make-up artist and personal trainer. (Easily believable as well)\n\n-Two of Madonna's more infamous scenes (one involving dripping candles, the other requiring her to masturbate) were improvised. (LOL Madonna is now a master of improv!)\n\n-Madonna's character doesn't remove her shoes in any of the three major sex scenes, except very briefly to smash a lightbulb with her heel. (Umm ok, dont know why this is in…\n\n\"Have you ever seen animals make love, Frank? It's intense. It's violent. But they never really hurt each other.\"\n\n\"We're not animals...\"\n\n\"Yes, we are.\"\n\nSure, you know this as the movie where Madonna pours her hot wax all over Willem Dafoe, but did you remember that it's also the movie where Joe Mantegna knows all about nipple clamps and Julianne Moore melodramatically slaps Madonna for having stolen her husband? No? Well, you're welcome!\n\nRoger Ebert liked to refer to Hollywood's most libidinous cinematic offerings of the 80s and 90s as the \"Fatal Basic\" style, explaining it as \"sex between bad people who live in good houses,\" and to that end I don't think it gets any more fatal or…\n\nMadonna released her SEX book before Body of Evidence was released, against the producers and director's wishes (as the whole box office potential hinged on, what does Madonna look like naked, and that was already answered in a coffee table book). And Basic Instinct scorched the earth of this genre a year prior with Paul Verhoeven's patented go-for-broke panache. So all you're left with is Willem Dafoe being covered with candle wax and champagne, with his hands tied behind his back, and loving it. But in regards to sex on top of a car and shattered glass, Madonna predated the auto-eroticism of Crash just a little bit, sans body horror.\n\nBody of Evidence is one of Roger Ebert's most hated…"
