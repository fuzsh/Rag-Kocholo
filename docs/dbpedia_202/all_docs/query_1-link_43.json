        "text": "If Martha De Laurentiis had followed the career path envisioned by her teenage self, she'd likely be sitting behind a desk right now.\n\nThe Ohio native had few vocational options in her small, everyone-knows-your-name hometown. Her family didn't have stake in a medical practice or a law firm. Teaching and nursing were options, but she was eyeing a career in secretarial administration.\n\n\"I always wanted to be Della Street from 'Perry Mason,'\" De Laurentiis said. \"She was so smart behind Perry Mason. She was the one that followed the lead and always saved the day.\"\n\nBut as her last name indicates, De Laurentiis didn't join the secretarial pool.\n\nInstead, a move to New York City and a few right-place-right-time jobs landed her in the world of film producing and in the path of Dino De Laurentiis, a legendary Italian producer who arrived in America in the '70s to take Hollywood by storm.\n\nSaturday, De Laurentiis, now the matriarch of the De Laurentiis Company, will make her first appearance the 20th anniversary Cucalorus Film Festival to join the exhibition's career retrospective of Dino, who died in 2010. Following a screening of his film \"Crimes of the Heart\" at 4 p.m. in Thalian Hall, she will participate in a panel to discuss his legacy and their years in Wilmington.\n\nHonoring the memory of her partner in life and producing is something of which she never tires.\n\n\"I love any opportunity to remember Dino,\" she said. \"And I always love for people to see his work and remember who he was. I just wish they had more time to see all he produced.\"\n\nMartha De Laurentiis' own title as a producer first came in 1982, two years after meeting Dino while working in an extras casting office in New York City. She was exploring the idea of producing and informed him she intended to pursue a project with several colleagues.\n\n\"I'll never forget what he said to me. 'I no want you to go out and broken your nose,'\" said De Laurentiis, mimicking Dino's thick Italian accent. To her, this was his warning of the fickle movie-making business.\n\nSo he posed a counter offer. If she wanted to produce, he would make her associate producer of his next movie: the locally filmed \"Firestarter.\"\n\nUnder his umbrella, she didn't break her nose. In fact, the years the couple spent in Wilmington were a prosperous time for the industry when more than 30 films were produced from 1984 to 1988.\n\nIn the '80s, De Laurentiis, then Schumacher, spent her early producing years alongside Dino working on such films as 1984's \"Firestarter\" and 1986's \"Maximum Overdrive\" in Wilmington. The mid-1980s cemented the region's status as a film production hub. It's also when the couple's love affair blossomed.\n\nDino's wife, Silvana Mangano, had moved back to Europe after the couple's only son, Federico, died in a plane crash in 1981. She and Dino separated in 1983.\n\nMartha married Dino in 1990, a year after Mangano's death.\n\n\"It was in Wilmington, out from under the eyes of Hollywood that we were able to work together and live together,\" she said.\n\nFrom that period, De Laurentiis still holds onto memories like creating miniature bridges and shooting at truck stops in Leland with Stephen King while filming \"Maximum Overdrive.\"\n\n\"But I can't say there was one favorite memory over the other or one tragedy over another,\" she said. \"That is why we are hooked into our business. Because it is creative and problem solving.\"\n\nThat thrilling and artistic uncertainty is what keeps her firmly in the business today. These days, she can be found far from the Port City in Vancouver where she executive produces NBC's \"Hannibal.\" She's also working on no less than eight different projects, including a television reimagining of \"Barberella\" for Amazon.\n\nDespite her and Dino's exit from Wilmington in 1990 after his company, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, filed for bankruptcy, her ties to Wilmington remain strong.\n\nShe recently made the trek back in October to see her parents, who live locally. It was her father's 84th birthday.\n\nTwo decades later, the Wrightsville Beach waterfront home she and Dino shared still stands as her escape from the light of Hollywood. She doesn't get back as much, but she finds comfort in knowing their home, and the memories, are here.\n\n\"Wilmington is the heart and soul of Dino and I's relationship,\" De Laurentiis said.\n\nHunter Ingram: 343-2327\n\nOn Twitter: @WilmonFilm\n\nWhat: A screening of the 1986 film \"Crimes of the Heart,\" filmed in Southeastern North Carolina. A Q&A with producer Martha De Laurentiis, plus longtime industry workers Mark Fincannon and Chunky Huse will follow the screening. When: 4 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 15 Where: Thalian Hall, 310 Chestnut St. Details: Single tickets are $15. For information about Cucalorus passes and other festival tickets, visit cucalorus.org."
