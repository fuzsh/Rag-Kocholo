        "text": "FILM 2088: BODY OF EVIDENCE (1992)\n\nTRIVIA: Madonna personally selected Willem Dafoe as her co-star.\n\nMadonna's acting coach quit just before production began, claiming that \"she thinks she knows everything.\"\n\nNeither Madonna or Willem Dafoe had a body double for any of the sex scenes.\n\nIn interviews, Madonna stated that she found filming the sex scenes \"scientific, not sexy at all\", but co-star Willem Dafoe admitted that he was \"turned on despite himself\" while filming the scenes.\n\nProducer Dino De Laurentiis stated in interviews after this movie's release that he begged Madonna to delay the publication of her 'sex book' by a few months, so that the public would not think that this was just 'the sex book movie', but that she refused. De Laurentiis maintained that this contributed strongly to the film's poor box office performance.\n\nIn an interview on youtube, Michael Forest states that he initially turned down the role of Andrew Marsh, because it was presented to him as \"they were doing him a big favor\" because he would be filming sex scenes with Madonna. In order to dissuade the producers from trying to cast him, Forest had his agent make an outrageous financial demand. To Forest's surprise, they agreed to pay what he asked, and he was left with no choice but to accept the role.\n\nMadonna's salary for this movie was higher than all the other actor's combined.\n\nThe black briefs worn by Madonna in the 'hot wax and champagne' scene were on display for a number of years in a strip club in Aberdeen, Scotland, until the owner decided to sell them at an online auction.\n\nThe 'hot wax and champagne' scene was included in UK Channel 4's list of the '100 sexiest movie moments'.\n\nJohn Wilson's \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" lists this film as one of \"The Ten Best Bad Films ever made.\""
