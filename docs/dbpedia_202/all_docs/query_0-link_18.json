        "text": "He was a small man who dreamed big, hit the highest heights and failed like few others.\n\nDino De Laurentiis was born to be a movie producer.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning legend of the Italian New Wave and producer of \"Serpico\" and \"Barbarella\" who helped revolutionize the way movies are bankrolled and helped personify the no-limits life of a cinematic king, died Wednesday night at the age of 91 in Beverly Hills.\n\nHis dozens of credits included the art-house classics \"La Strada\" and \"Nights of Cabiria,\" the cult favorite \"Blue Velvet,\" the Hollywood epics \"War and Peace\" and \"The Bible,\" and such mainstream hits as \"Three Days of the Condor.\" He backed horror films (\"Halloween 2\"), police drama (\"Serpico\") and the most far-out science fiction fused with sex and sexuality (\"Barbarella\").\n\nAnd when he bombed, he really bombed: \"Dune,\" about which director David Lynch complained he was denied creative control; the Madonna vehicle \"Body of Evidence\"; the 1976 remake of \"King Kong,\" which nearly finished off the career of Jessica Lange before it really started.\n\nDe Laurentiis was one of the first producers to understand the box-office potential of foreign audiences, and helped invent international co-productions, raising money by pre-selling distribution rights outside North America.\n\nHe was tiny, but tough, a veritable Napoleon on the set and utterly tireless. \"Such a little lion,\" was how his second wife, producer Martha De Laurentiis, put it when he turned 80.\n\nThroughout his career, he alternated lavish, big-budget productions with less commercial films by directors such as Robert Altman, Ingmar Bergman and Lynch, and he often packaged the blockbusters with art films to secure distribution for the smaller films.\n\n\"The extraordinary thing that Dino taught all of us is the true figure of the independent producer,\" De Laurentiis' nephew, Aurelio De Laurentiis, a noted Italian film producer, said Thursday. \"He always behaved in the U.S. as a major studio, even though he was a one-man show.\"\n\n\"He was my biggest champion in life and a constant source for wisdom and advice. I will miss him dearly,\" said granddaughter Giada De Laurentiis, a star chef and host on Food Network.\n\nRaised outside Naples and one of six children born into the family's pasta-making business, De Laurentiis quickly realized that his destiny was in moviemaking.\n\nHe was central to the rise of Italy's film industry, which in the 1950s rose to international prominence as the Italian New Wave.\n\nDe Laurentiis' initial success began after World War II, starting with \"Bitter Rice,\" in 1948, which launched the career of his first wife, Silvana Mangano.\n\nIn 1950, he went into business with another rising director, Carlo Ponti. They soon dominated the Italian movie business, monopolizing top stars such as Mangano, Sophia Loren (who later married Ponti) and Marcello Mastroianni. Their first international production was the epic \"War and Peace\" (Henry Fonda, Audrey Hepburn, Mel Ferrer) in 1955.\n\nWith the lure of huge salaries, he often imported international movie stars to boost a film's prospects. For Fellini's \"La Strada,\" which won the Academy Award for foreign language film in 1957, he persuaded Anthony Quinn to come to Rome. De Laurentiis also produced Fellini's \"Nights of Cabiria,\" which won the foreign film Oscar a year later.\n\nAt Dinocitta, De Laurentiis married Hollywood stars with spectacle: \"Barrabas\" (Quinn); \"The Bible\" (George C. Scott, Ava Gardner); \"Anzio\" (Robert Mitchum); \"Waterloo\" (Rod Steiger). He also made more offbeat fare, such as Roger Vadim's sex romp, \"Barbarella\" (Jane Fonda).\n\nHe began to move away from his base in Italy in the 1960s when the government changed the rules to mandate totally Italian productions to qualify for subsidies.\n\nHe sold Dinocitta to the government in 1972. He relocated the studio in Wilmington, N.C., and dubbed his production company the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group.\n\nThe Oscar-winning \"Serpico,\" in 1973 with Al Pacino, was De Laurentiis' Hollywood debut. Charles Bronson's \"Death Wish,\" Robert Redford's \"Three Days of the Condor\" and John Wayne's last film, \"The Shootist,\" followed.\n\nThough flops like \"King Kong\" and \"Hurricane\" could be shaken off, personal tragedy took its toll. In 1981, his son Federico was killed in a plane crash.\n\nThe strain of the loss helped end De Laurentiis' marriage to Mangano. They were divorced in 1988, the same year De Laurentiis Entertainment Group went into bankruptcy, finished off by the flop of \"King Kong Lives.\"\n\nDe Laurentiis, close to 70, was undaunted and started over. Within two years, he had a new wife, 29-year-old Martha Schumacher, formed a new company and started producing moneymakers again.\n\n\"My philosophy is very simple,\" he once said. \"To feel young, you must work as long as you can.\""
