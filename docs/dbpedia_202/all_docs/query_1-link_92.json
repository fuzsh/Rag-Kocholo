        "text": "Hollywood legend Dino De Laurentiis, who produced cult films Flash Gordon and Dune, has died aged 91.\n\nHe began his career in Italy working with Roberto Rossellini and won an Oscar for producing Federico Fellini's 1954 film La Strada.\n\nAfter moving to the US in the 1970s, he oversaw Serpico, Death Wish and the 1976 remake of King Kong.\n\nHe also produced four films the serial killer Hannibal Lecter.\n\nRome International Film Festival founder Walter Veltroni said: \"Cinema has lost one of its greats.\n\n\"The name of Dino De Laurentiis is tied to the history of cinema.\"\n\nThe son of pasta makers, De Laurentiis was born in Torre Annunziata, near Naples.\n\nAfter serving in the Italian army during World War II, he founded Dino De Laurentiis Studios in 1947.\n\nIn the 1950s he began work on such epic films as Ulysses with Kirk Douglas and War And Peace with Audrey Hepburn.\n\nHe went on to build a studio in Rome called Dinocitta, hoping to rival the city's famous Cinecitta facility.\n\nThere he made a number of films, including Barbarella, but a string of flops prompted him to move to the US.\n\nHe swiftly made a name for himself as the purveyor of epic, slightly camp blockbustfeaturing ers like Flash Gordon and the much-derided King Kong.\n\nThe 1980s saw him make Conan The Barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nHe also made Manhunter, the first film with Hannibal \"The Cannibal\", going on to produce a sequel (Hannibal), a remake (Red Dragon) and a prequel (Hannibal Rising).\n\nHe received the Irving Thalberg Memorial award at the 2001 Oscars.\n\nHe is survived by wife Martha, their two children and four kids from his first wife Silvana Mangano."
