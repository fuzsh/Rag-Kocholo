        "text": "Dino de Laurentiis died Wednesday at age 91. One of the first European producers to see the advantage of international co-production, de Laurentiis' successes include Federico Fellini's La Strada, Sidney Lumet's Serpico, and David Lynch's Blue Velvet. His marriage to former Miss Rome Silvana Mangano lasted 40 years, until her death in 1989, and his granddaughter, Giada de Laurentiis, is a major Food Network star. LIFE magazine produced a photo gallery in remembrance of the producer's life.\n\nSee the full gallery at LIFE.com.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
