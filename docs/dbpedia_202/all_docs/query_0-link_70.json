        "text": "In over 40 years as a producer, director, and production executive, Stephen Simon has been involved in the production of over 20 films.\n\nStephen personally produced such acclaimed projects as the Academy Award® winning What Dreams May Come (starring Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr.), Somewhere in Time (Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour), and All The Right Moves (Tom Cruise).\n\nStephen was also co-executive producer on fan favorites Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure and Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey (Keanu Reeves), produced She’s Out of Control (Tony Danza), executive produced Body of Evidence (Madonna), produced the first original film to premiere on the Internet (Quantum Project), starring John Cleese and Stephen Dorff, was an executive producer on Linda McCartney for CBS Television, and was nominated for an Emmy Award as one of the executive producers of Homeless to Harvard for Lifetime Television.\n\nStephen was the head of production of the film companies owned by legendary Hollywood producers Ray Stark (Funny Girl, The Goodbye Girl, The Way We Were) and Dino De Laurentiis (Serpico, La Strada, 3 Days of The Condor).\n\nAs an executive, Stephen supervised the development and/or production of films such as Smokey and The Bandit and The Electric Horseman.\n\nStephen also directed and produced Indigo and the film version of Conversations with God.\n\nIn 2004, Stephen co-founded The Spiritual Cinema Circle (www.spiritualcinemacircle.com), a monthly DVD distribution service that became an immediate international success. The Circle is now in its 16th year with subscribers in all fifty United States and dozens of other countries.\n\nStephen has been a voting member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences since 1984.\n\nStephen’s first book, The Force is With You, was published by Hampton Roads in 2002 and his second book Bringing Back The Old Hollywood was published in 2011.\n\nStephen was born into a successful Hollywood family. His father, S. Sylvan Simon, was a producer/director who made films with stars such as Abbott and Costello, Lana Turner, and Red Skelton. He worked as both a producer and an executive at Columbia Pictures under the legendary Harry Cohn, producing films such as Born Yesterday, the 1950 film that garnered a Best Actress Oscar for star Judy Holliday.\n\nSylvan Simon died when Stephen was four years old, an event which compelled Frank Sinatra to become Stephen’s “godfather”.\n\nStephen’s mother Harriet remarried Armand Deutsch, a film producer at MGM who produced films with stars such as Robert Taylor, James Stewart, and Grace Kelly.\n\nArmand Deutsch adopted Stephen, changing Stephen’s last name to Deutsch. In 1996, Stephen legally changed his name back to Simon.\n\nStephen earned his Bachelor of Arts Degree from UCLA in 1971 and a Law Degree from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles in 1974. After being admitted to the California Bar in 1974, he practiced law briefly before entering the film industry in 1976."
