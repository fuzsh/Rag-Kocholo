        "text": "NOTE: This is a corrected version of this story. An earlier version included an incorrect date for the release of \"King Kong.\"\n\nDino De Laurentiis, the colorful Italian film producer who launched the film industry in Wilmington, has died in Los Angeles, family sources said Thursday. He was 91.\n\nA spokesman for the producer’s daughter said De Laurentiis died late Wednesday night at his Beverly Hills home. No cause of death was given.\n\n“He's responsible for all this being here,” said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission.\n\nIn a career that began before World War II, De Laurentiis produced more than 500 films, from classics such as Federico Fellini's “La Strada” to pop hits such as “Barbarella” and the 1976 version of “King Kong.”\n\nIn 1983, however, he was working with Frank Capra Jr. on an adaptation of the Stephen King novel “Firestarter.” The production needed a Southern plantation as a set.\n\nAs Jean Nance described it in “Cinematic Wilmington,” Capra found a photo of Orton Plantation, in Brunswick County, on the cover of Southern Accents magazine in a film studio research library. He and De Laurentiis contacted North Carolina's governor, Jim Hunt. Before long, Capra was flying to Orton on the governor's helicopter, to strike a deal with the Sprunt family, who owned Orton at the time.\n\n“People ask me, why did he come to Wilmington?” Griffin said. “He came to do a film” – as in one film – “at Orton Plantation.”\n\nBefore long, however, De Laurentiis decided to stay. He organized a production company, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) and began to build up a studio complex off North 23rd Street in Wilmington.\n\nDe Laurentiis began to send other film projects to New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender counties, including “Cat's Eye,” “Silver Bullet,” “Year of the Dragon,” “Manhunter” and “Blue Velvet.”\n\nBy 1986, he was releasing a string of made-in-Wilmington features under the DEG label, including “Raw Deal” with Arnold Schwarzenegger, “Maximum Overdrive” (which brought actor Pat Hingle to the area as a permanent resident) and “Crimes of the Heart.” A critical highlight came with “Blue Velvet,” a complex, darkly erotic mystery that many consider director David Lynch's best film.\n\nDe Laurentiis, meanwhile, made a striking impression on the area, entertaining lavishly at his large Wrightsville Beach home. He publicly kept company with Martha Schumacher, the associate producer of “Firestarter” who became head of the Wilmington studio, while his wife, the actress Silvana Mangano, remained in Italy.\n\nDe Laurentiis and Schumacher were married in 1990, after Mangano died. The couple had two daughters. De Laurentiis also had four other children from previous marriages, including film producer Raffaella De Laurentiis.\n\nSurvivors include Giada De Laurentiis, the chef, cookbook author and host of The Food Network's “Giada at Home.” She is the daughter of Dino De Laurentiis' daughter Veronica De Laurentiis.\n\nThe good times ended in 1988, however, when DEG went bankrupt after too many of its pictures bombed disastrously at the box office. De Laurentiis resigned as DEG president and left town, although he did not completely sever local ties. Martha De Laurentiis still owns real estate in the area, according to New Hanover County tax records.\n\nThe studio De Laurentiis built still remains, now owned by EUE/Screen Gems. It is ranked as the largest film production complex outside California.\n\n“Dino's real impact, though, is really the crew base,” said Bill Vasser, executive vice president of EUE/Screen Gems. “He brought in the best craftspeople – the best scenic painters, the best grips, the best electricians – who then trained local people to make films.\n\n“The result is, we have the third largest film crew in the United States,” Vasser added. “They may be working in Atlanta and all over the country, but they make their homes here. And some of them are already into the second generation in the industry.”\n\nBorn Aug. 18, 1918, in Torre Annunciata, a small city outside Naples, Dino De Laurentiis started in his family's pasta-making business but soon headed to film school in Rome.\n\nHe produced his first picture in 1939 but did not achieve international acclaim until the 1948 release of “Bitter Rice” by director Giuseppe de Santis, a major film in Italy's postwar “neo-realistic” movement.\n\nIn the 1950s, De Laurentiis was associated with the great director Federico Fellini, producing his “La Strada” and “Nights in Cabiria.” In 1957, De Laurentiis would share an Oscar when “La Strada” was named Best Foreign Film.\n\nIn 2001, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences further honored De Laurentiis with an Irving G. Thalberg award for lifetime achievement.\n\nAs the 1950s progressed, however, De Laurentiis turned to bigger, more popular projects. He produced an epic version of Tolstoy's “War and Peace,” released in 1956, starring Henry Fonda and Audrey Hepburn, and “The Bible,” a film version of Genesis, directed by John Huston.\n\nIn the 1960s, he built his own studio, Dino Citta and launched projects with such directors as Vittorio de Sica, Jean-Luc Godard, Luchino Visconti and Claude Chabrol.\n\nAfter Dino Citta failed, however, De Laurentiis moved his base of operations to the United States, producing such successful films as “The Valachi Papers,” “Serpico,” “Death Wish,” “Mandingo,” “Three Days of the Condor” and “Ragtime.”\n\nHis “King Kong” – a 1976 update in which the great ape fell from the World Trade Center towers instead of the Empire State Building – was ridiculed by critics but earned $80 million at the box office. In the process, it launched the career of its female lead, a former fashion model named Jessica Lange.\n\nLange would later travel to Southport to co-star in “Crimes of the Heart,” an adaptation of the Beth Henley comedy and a De Laurentiis project.\n\nDe Laurentiis quickly recovered from his DEG setback and continued to produce films well into the 21st century. Among his later successes was the “Silence of the Lambs” sequel “Hannibal,” filmed in part on the Biltmore estate outside Asheville.\n\nBen Steelman: 343-2208\n\nOn Twitter.com: @StarNewsOnline"
