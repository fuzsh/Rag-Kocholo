De Laurentiis passed away in November 2010 at the age of 91.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDino De Laurentiis was born Agostino De Laurentiis on August 8, 1919, in Torre Annunziata, Kingdom of Italy. His father owned a pasta factory, and during his youth, Dino sold spaghetti made by the factory. De Laurentiis attended Rome's Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia from 1937 to 1938, but his studies were interrupted when World War II began. Dino had an older brother named Luigi, who was also a film producer.\n\nCareer\n\nDe Laurentiis' first film was 1940's \"L'ultimo Combattimento,\" and by the end of the decade, he had produced \"L'amore canta\" (1941), \"Return of the Black Eagle\" (1946), \"The Bandit\" (1946), \"The Captain's Daughter\" (1947), \"Bullet for Stefano\" (1947), \"Bitter Rice\" (1948), \"The Street Has Many Dreams\" (1948), and \"The Wolf of the Sila\" (1949). In the '50s, Dino produced films such as \"Anna\" (1951), \"Funniest Show on Earth\" (1953), \"The Unfaithfuls\" (1953), \"Woman of Rome\" (1954), \"An American in Rome\" (1954), \"Ulysses\" (1955), \"War and Peace\" (1956), \"Tempest\" (1958), and \"The Great War\" (1959), and he won an Academy Award for 1954's \"La Strada,\" which was directed by Federico Fellini. De Laurentiis produced more than 30 films in the '60s, including \"The Hunchback of Rome\" (1960), \"The Last Judgment\" (1961), \"The Best of Enemies\" (1961), \"Mafioso\" (1962), \"The Hills Run Red\" (1966), \"The Stranger\" (1967), \"The Witches\" (1967), \"Barbarella\" (1968), and the 1966 John Hutson-directed epic \"The Bible: In the Beginning,\" which starred Ava Gardner, Peter O'Toole, and George C.

That year he also moved to America, and he became a U.S. citizen 10 years later.\n\nIn the '80s, Dino launched De Laurentiis Entertainment Group in Wilmington, North Carolina, and he is credited with bringing the film industry to the city, which came to be known as \"Wilmywood\" and \"Hollywood East.\" In 1990, he opened Dino De Laurentiis Communications in Los Angeles.

Dino later produced three more films featuring Hannibal Lecter: \"Hannibal\" (2001), \"Red Dragon\" (2002), and \"Hannibal Rising\" (2007). In the late '90s, De Laurentiis produced the films \"Unforgettable\" (1996), \"Bound\" (1996), and \"Breakdown\" (1997), and in the last decade of his life, he produced \"U-571\" (2000), \"The Last Legion\" (2007), and \"Virgin Territory\" (2007).\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter his first marriage was annulled, Dino married actress Silvana Mangano on July 17, 1949. Dino and Silvana had four children together, daughters Veronica, Raffaella, and Francesca and son Federico. Raffaella and Federico both became film producers, but sadly Federico died in a plane crash at the age of 26. De Laurentiis and Mangano divorced in 1988, and Silvana died the following year. Dino married producer Martha Schumacher on April 7, 1990, and they remained married until his death in 2010. Martha produced several films with Dino, such as \"Breakdown\" and \"Hannibal,\" and they had two daughters together, Dina and Carolyna. Famed chef Giada De Laurentiis is one of Dino's grandchildren.\n\nDeath\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Dino passed away at his Beverly Hills home at the age of 91. According to his daughter Raffaella, De Laurentiis was surrounded by his family when he died. After Dino's death, his granddaughter Giada paid tribute to him, telling \"The Hollywood Reporter,\" \"My grandfather was a true inspiration. He was my biggest champion in life and a constant source for wisdom and advice. I will miss him dearly.\"\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nIn 1957, De Laurentiis won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for \"La strada,\" and in 2001, he was honored with the Irving G.
