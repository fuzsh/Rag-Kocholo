Dino and Silvana had four children together, daughters Veronica, Raffaella, and Francesca and son Federico. Raffaella and Federico both became film producers, but sadly Federico died in a plane crash at the age of 26. De Laurentiis and Mangano divorced in 1988, and Silvana died the following year. Dino married producer Martha Schumacher on April 7, 1990, and they remained married until his death in 2010. Martha produced several films with Dino, such as \"Breakdown\" and \"Hannibal,\" and they had two daughters together, Dina and Carolyna. Famed chef Giada De Laurentiis is one of Dino's grandchildren.\n\nDeath\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Dino passed away at his Beverly Hills home at the age of 91. According to his daughter Raffaella, De Laurentiis was surrounded by his family when he died. After Dino's death, his granddaughter Giada paid tribute to him, telling \"The Hollywood Reporter,\" \"My grandfather was a true inspiration. He was my biggest champion in life and a constant source for wisdom and advice. I will miss him dearly.\"\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nIn 1957, De Laurentiis won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for \"La strada,\" and in 2001, he was honored with the Irving G.
