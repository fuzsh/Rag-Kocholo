        "text": "Dino De Laurentiis left home at age 17 to enrol in film school, supporting himself as an actor, extra, propman, or any other job he could get in the film industry. His persistence paid off, and by the time he reached his 20th birthday he already had one produced film under his belt. After serving in the Italian army during World War II, De Laurentiis went back into film production, and in 1946 scored a critical and commercial international hit with Bitterer Reis (1949) (\"Bitter Rice\"). He later married its star, Silvana Mangano. De Laurentiis eventually formed a partnership with producer Carlo Ponti, and the team had a string of hits, including several by director Federico Fellini. After the partnership dissolved, De Laurentiis embarked on a plan to build his own studio facilities, which would enable him to make the kind of massive spectacles he wanted to make. The studio complex, called Dinocitta', eventually was forced to close down due to a combination of hard times in the Italian film industry and a string of flops by De Laurentiis himself. De Laurentiis eventually sold the property to the Italian government and moved his base of production to the United States. He again opened up a film production complex in Wilmington, North Carolina, called DEG Studios, but was eventually forced by economic conditions to sell that, too. De Laurentiis has had some critical successes since his move to the U.S. (Ragtime (1981)), but most of his U.S. productions have been critically lambasted, although several have been commercial successes.\n\nAgostino \"Dino\" De Laurentiis was born on August 8, 1919 in Torre Annunziata, Campania, Italy. He spent his childhood selling spaghetti that his father made. But he caught his interest on one big thing: making movies.\n\nDe Laurentiis left his home at the age of 17 to enroll for film studies at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. He bounced around any job he could get in the film industry, which in turn paid off. Even though he was ready to launch a career with his first film, L'ultimo Combattimento (1940), Dino got drafted to serve in the army during World War II. After that, Dino went back into film production to make neorealist films at his newly opened Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica.\n\nAlthough his output was lukewarm, one film earned him critical and financial success; Bitter Rice (1949). Things went from good to great when Dino formed a partnership with producer Carlo Ponti, scoring a bunch of hits. While the partnership dissolved in the late 1950's, Dino set out to make massive eye spectacles by setting up his own studio facilities. Thus, his Dinocitta' Studios was formed in Rome.\n\nBut as Dino was heading to new heights, the Italian film industry was facing a new low. During the early 1970's, De Laurentiis undoubtedly released a string of financial flops which dissolved chances on making spectacles. Finally, Dinocitta was forced to close and he sold the property to the Italian government.\n\nIn 1976, Dino De Laurentiis relocated to the USA, taking his Cinematografica with him. His studio found a new home in Wilmington, North Carolina and soon he was on the right track with some financially successful films. But his spectacles dreams grew more bigger and one of them was certain to be masterful. As Dino himself said, \"When Jaws dies, nobody cries. When Kong dies, we all cry\".\n\nDe Laurentiis unleashed a big budget remake of King Kong (1976). It turned out to be a worldwide hit, but it was lambasted by critics. He spent the rest of the 1970's and the 1980's with an unbalanced output of art films and ridiculous looking \"spectacles\" that earned him the name \"Dino Di Horrendous\", whether it was a success or not.\n\nAround the early 1980's, Dino De Laurentiis embarked on his most ambitious project yet, an adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi masterpiece, Dune. Bringing in a clueless David Lynch as director, this adaptation was finally released in 1984. To the shock of Dino (and to no surprise at Lynch), it was a critical and commercial disaster. The spectacle dreams were once again closing in on Dino.\n\nIn 1986, De Laurentiis bought the theatrical unit of Embassy Pictures and renamed it the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Dino was now able to distribute the films he produced. Unfortunatly, the division released a string of flops and was forced to shut down in 1989.\n\nBut even those hardships didn't stop Dino from producing films. He kept his career rolling in the 1990's with some hits during the time. Dino was finally able to make his dream spectacles in the 21st century, with U-571 (2000) and the two Hannibal Lecter films, Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002). They were his biggest hits both domestically and internationally.\n\nBut in 2007, Dino's producing career came to an abrupt end, thanks to the unsatisfied performance of Hannibal Rising and the disaster of The Last Legion. It is dubious that his last film was the chick flick, Virgin Teritory. He planned to do at least four more films in his latter years, but they got stuck in development hell.\n\nDino De Laurentiis died peacefully on November 10, 2010 at his residence in Beverly Hills, California."
