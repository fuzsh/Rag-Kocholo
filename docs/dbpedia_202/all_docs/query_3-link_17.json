        "meta_description": "Agostino \"Dino\" De Laurentiis was an Italian-American film producer, responsible for producing over 500 films in his lifetime. Born in Naples, Italy, De Laurentiis began studying film prior to the outbreak of World War II, which interrupted his studies. He produced his first film in 1941, and founded his own production company in 1946. De Laurentiis produced numerous films in his native Italy over the following decades, many of which were critically acclaimed even internationally, until his studio closed down in the 1970s. He moved to the United States in 1976, and was granted American citizenship a decade later. While in Hollywood, De Laurentiis produced several high-profile blockbuster films, with the 1976 King Kong remake arguably putting his name on the map in Hollywood as a major producer. In 1980, De Laurentiis and his future wife, producer Martha Schumacher, founded a new production company, the Dino De Laurentiis Company. This company produced nearly all of the couple's films from then on. De Laurentiis died in 2010 at the age of 91, with his widow serving as the chairperson of their company until her death in 2021.",
