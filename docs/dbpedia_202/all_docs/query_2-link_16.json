        "text": "A Hollywood player for decades, producer Dino De Laurentiis produced a remarkable mix of motion pictures, ranging from art house fare like Fellini's \"La Strada\" (1954) to camp classics like \"Barbarella\" (1968) to spectacles like \"King Kong\" (1976) and \"Tai Pan\" (1986), as well as popular entertainment like \"Hannibal\" (2001). Ever since he began his producing career with the international hit \"Riso Amaro\" (\"Bitter Rice\") (1948), De Laurentiis financed, produced or distributed hundreds of movies, including some of the most significant ever made in cinema history, like \"Serpico\" (1973), \"Death Wish\" (1974) and \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982). Toward the end of the 20th century, De Laurentiis - who had missed out on the massive success of \"Silence of the Lambs (1991) after declining the rights following the failure of \"Manhunter\" (1986) - saw a resurgence with the box office hit \"Hannibal\" (2001), which spawned another successful sequel, \"Red Dragon\" (2002), and cemented his place as one of cinema's most prolific producers."
