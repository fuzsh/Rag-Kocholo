He was 91,” his Hollywood producer daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis said in a statement.\n\nThe cause of death was not immediately known.\n\nThe filmmaker's granddaughter Giada, a chef who hosts a show on the US Food Network TV channel, called him a “true inspiration”.\n\n“He was my biggest champion in life and a constant source for wisdom and advice. I will miss him dearly,” Giada De Laurentiis said.—Reuters"
