        "text": "Agostino De Laurentiis, usually credited as Dino De Laurentiis, (born August 8, 1919) is an Italian movie producer born at Torre Annunziata in the province of Naples. He grew up selling spaghetti produced by his father. A study at the school of cinematography in Rome was interrupted by the Second World War. Nonetheless de Laurentiis succeeded in making movies.\n\nSince his first movie, L'ultimo Combattimento, (1940) he has produced nearly 150 movies to date. In the early years de Laurentiis produced neoclassical art films as Bitter Rice (1946) and the Fellini classics La Strada (1954) Nights of Cabiria (1956). In his later choice of stories he displayed a strong preference for adaptations of successful books, especially sweeping classics like the Bible, Barabbas (1961), or Dune (1984).\n\nHe has 4 children with his previous wife, actress Silvana Mangano who died in 1989. Today, he is married to the movie producer Martha Schumacher and they have two daughters.\n\nIn 2001 he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nTemplate:Italy-stub\n\nExternal links\n\nhttp://www.dinodelaurentiis.it/\n\nIMDB entry (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0209569/)it:Dino De Laurentiis"
