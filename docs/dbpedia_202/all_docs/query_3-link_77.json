His Nights of Cabiria won the same award a year later, in 1958. He moved from Italy to Hollywood in the 1960s and produced such movies as Serpico, the 1976 failed remake of King Kong, Conan The Barbarian, Dune, Army Of Darkness and the Silence Of The Lambs sequels Hannibal and Red Dragon.\n\nDino De Laurentiis was born on August 8, 1919 in a small village near Naples, Italy. He first entered the movie business at the age of 20 and never looked back. He also received the Irving Thalberg Award at the 2001 Academy Awards for his lifetime of achievement in the film industry. Here's what he said after receiving the award:\n\n\"I've been very lucky in my long life. On three continents, in diverse cultures, through happy moments, not-so-happy moments, and moments as marvelous as this one, I've had the privilege of working with the cinema's greatest masters.\""
