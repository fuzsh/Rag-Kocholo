        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Dino De Laurentiis, who helped resurrect Italy's film industry after World War II and for more than six decades produced films as diverse as the 1954 Federico Fellini classic, \"La Strada,\" and the 1976 remake of \"King Kong,\" has died. He was 91.\n\nDe Laurentiis, who moved to the United States in the 1970s and continued to produce films until 2007, died Wednesday night at his Beverly Hills home, his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis said in a statement yesterday. The cause was not given.\n\nDe Laurentiis launched his long career as a producer in Italy in the 1940s and in the next decade produced two Oscar-winning best foreign films - Fellini's \"La Strada\" (with then-partner Carlo Ponti) and Fellini's \"Nights of Cabiria\" (1957).\n\nDuring the 1960s De Laurentiis produced, among others, director Richard Fleischer's \"Barabbas,\" starring Anthony Quinn; John Huston's star-studded \"The Bible\"; and Roger Vadim's \"Barbarella,\" starring Jane Fonda.\n\nAfter selling his studio and moving to the United States in the 1970s, De Laurentiis produced \"Serpico,\" \"Death Wish,\" \"Three Days of the Condor,\" \"The Serpent's Egg,\" \"Ragtime\" and \"Conan the Barbarian.\"\n\nThe son of a pasta manufacturer, he was born Agostino De Laurentiis on Aug. 8, 1919, in Torre Annunziata, about 17 miles from Naples.\n\nIn 1937, the movie-struck teenager was accepted to the first-year acting course at a new film school in Rome, Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. He realized that he would be better off behind the camera - as a producer.\n\nIn World War II he served for a time in the Italian army, organizing shows to entertain troops.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to producing at Lux studios and scored his first international success with Giuseppe De Santis' \"Bitter Rice,\" a 1949 drama set among women working in the rice fields of the Po Valley.\n\nThe film's cast included Silvana Mangano, whom De Laurentiis married in 1949 and with whom he had four children, Veronica, Raffaella, Federico and Francesca; they were divorced in 1989. Federico died in an airplane crash while making a documentary in Alaska in 1981 at age 26.\n\nIn 1990, he married producer-colleague Martha Schumacher, with whom he had two daughters, Carolyna and Dina.\n\nBesides his wife and five daughters, De Laurentiis also leaves five grandchildren, including Food Network host Giada De Laurentiis; three sisters; and two great-grandchildren."
