I'm focusing on Fellini's work for part of a class paper this semester.

Please.\n\nSad... but dear Lord, this has been on CNN all day. How did it just get on ontd? I assumed I had just missed the post.\n\nNobody relevant has died since Michael Jackson\n\nok bye\n\nreally bad week for Giada, I guess.\n\nFrank Booth is saddened by this news.\n\nTruly a force of nature, was De Laurentiis.\n\nI grew up watching the 1970's King Kong movie. I know he had a hand in producing it. Also, I loved the Conan films (had no idea he had a hand in those).\n\n91 is an amazing age. <3 He will be missed.\n\nso sad :(\n\nHe was a great producer. RIP"
