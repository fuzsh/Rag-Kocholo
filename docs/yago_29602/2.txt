Actress Anna Lee died May 14 of pneumonia in Los Angeles. She was 91.

Paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident just a year after she began playing Lila Quartermaine in ABC’s “General Hospital,” Lee acted in a wheelchair for more than two decades until she left the soap last year.

Born in Kent, England, Lee studied acting in London and was known as “the British bombshell” when touring with the London Repertory Theatre.

In the early 1930s she moved to California to work in Hollywood, and appeared in more than 60 films including “The Sound of Music,” “Fort Apache” and “King Solomon’s Mines.”.

Lee was married three times, first to Robert Stevenson, the director of films including “The Love Bug” and “Mary Poppins.” She was married to George Stafford for two decades and wed writer Robert Nathan in 1970. Nathan died in 1985.

Lee is survived by a sister, two sons, two daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
