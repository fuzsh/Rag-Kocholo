        "text": "Three classics from novelist Robert Nathan that will give the reader a taste of this literary icons genius. The three novels are diverse in content and yet common themes thread them together. THE BISHOP'S WIFE is classic Nathan. A spritual fantasy. ONE MORE SPRING is Nathan's ode to the Great Depression, and his belief in mankind. SIR HENRY is a heartwarming romp during midevial times. Fantasy, love, adventure and the enduring qualities of the human spirit. ROBERT NATHAN, at his best.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAuthor of such revered books as PORTRAIT OF JENNIE, THE BISHOPâS WIFE, MR. WHITTLE AND THE MORNING STAR, and STONECLIFF, Robert Nathan was born in New York City in 1894 and was educated at private schools in the United States and Switzerland. While attending Harvard University where he was a classmate with E.E. Cummings, Nathan was an editor of the Harvard Monthly, in which his first stories and poems appeared.\n\nWhile at Cambridge, Nathan also found the time to become an accomplished cellist, a lightweight boxer, and Captain of the fencing team. After leaving college, Mr. Nathan devoted his time exclusively to writing until his passing in 1985. Early on, Nathanâs work strengthened his reputation with both the public and peers. F. Scott Fitzgerald once referred to Robert Nathan as his favorite writer. During this period, the legendary Louis B. Mayer contracted him to Hollywood to become a screenwriter. Nathan ultimately didnât enjoy the experience, though the movie industry continually craved his work. Five of his novels have been made into films.\n\nThe aforementioned âPortrait of Jennieâ and âThe Bishopâs Wife,â as well as âOne More Spring,â âWake Up and Dreamâ (from the novel âThe Enchanted Voyageâ) and âColor of Evening.â Robert Nathan was the author of over fifty volumes of novels, poetry, and plays, and from this body of distinguished work he acquired a reputation as a master of satiric fantasy unique in American Letters. In the twilight of his career he was known as âThe Dean of Authorâs,â since many prominent writers including Irving Stone and Irving Wallace sought out Nathanâs guidance. A member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters for fifty years, Mr. Nathan called both Cape Cod and California home. Happily, his last fifteen years were spent in the companionship of his wife, English born actress, Anna Lee."
