In 2016 my son and his wife lost everything in a flood in Baton Rouge, LA. Today my daughter and her family are experiencing flooding from Troical Storm Debby. My heart breaks for her and her town of Richmond Hill, GA. They have safely made it out by boat. Please pray for the rain to stop and the rivers to crest. This mama wants to be there but there’s nothing we can do right now but pray.\n\n(The Wieborgs served at Roseland Baptist Church more than twenty years ago. Some of you may remember them. All of you can pray for Katie and her family. She and Emily Daniels were best of friends.)"
