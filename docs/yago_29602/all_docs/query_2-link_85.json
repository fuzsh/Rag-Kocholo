        "text": "Anna Lee Bacon died May 3, 2019 at the Chase City Rehabilitation Center. Anna Lee was born on Jan. 25, 1932 in Chase City, to the late Thomas Woodton and Mamie Reid.\n\nShe was the first born of nine siblings. Five siblings (Byrd, Thomas Jr., Wilbert, Walter and Betty) preceded her in death. She was fondly called “Sis” by her siblings. Anna Lee received her formal education at Thyne Institute.\n\nOn July 23, 1949, Anna Lee married the love of her life, Drewry Thomas Bacon. With this union, they were blessed with seven children. Three sons (Thomas (Puddin), Conrey and Tyree) preceded her in death.\n\nAnna Lee was described by many people as a “people person”. She loved everyone regardless of who they were or what material possessions they had. Prior to her long-term illness, she loved worshipping in church, reading her Bible, and serving as a deaconess. She enjoyed attending weekly community activities with her senior citizen friends at the R.C. Yancey Masonic Lodge in Chase City. She frequently threw kisses at the Red Cardinal Bird because she believed the “Red Bird” was a sign that someone special was coming to visit. She spent many hours in her home, mending clothes, quilting, and doing crossword puzzles. When quilting, she was never concerned about or learned what a pattern of design meant. Just looking at her “thick” quilts, one could see that each quilt was stuffed with lots of love. Anna Lee also loved to travel even though she never learned to drive. When asked about going somewhere, Anna Lee would always respond by saying, “Just let me know ahead of time when you want to go, I will be ready.” Of course, Thomas always made sure Anna Lee was able to get to where he thought she needed to go.\n\nAnna Lee leaves to cherish her memories, her husband, Drewry Thomas Bacon of Chase City, three daughters, Helen Hill, Anna Gayles (Anthony) of Chase City, and Betty Reid Duncan of Richmond, one son, Larry Bacon (Joyce) of Clarksville, a daughter-in-law, Clara Bacon of Clarksville, nine grandchildren, Keesya Hill-Jones (Shawn) of Williamsburg, Yvonne Hill of Charlotte, N.C., Anthony Gayles of Apex, N.C., Travis Gayles of Silver Springs, Md., Ashley Gayles of Goldsboro, N.C., LeRoy Bacon (Theresa) and April Bacon of Richmond, Camecia Thomas (Dwayne) of South Hill, Adrian Carpenter of Burlington, N.C., and Tasha Flemings of Gainesville, Fla., six great grandchildren, Jacqueline, Cierra, Angel, Jaden, Josh, and Mytia; one sister, Bertha Reid of Baltimore, Maryland, two brothers, Joseph Woodton (Elnora) and Willie Reid of Baltimore, Md., three brothers-in-law, Charlie Ellis Bacon (Isabella), Woodrow Bacon of Chase City, and Roger Bacon (Joyce) of Baltimore Md., five sisters-in-law, Irene Thompson of Hillside, N.J., Geneva Lea, Maggie Willicia Crutchfield, Patty Bacon of Chase City, and Esther Woodton of Petersburg, one uncle, William Tisdale of Upper Marlboro Md., and a host of nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends.\n\nA funeral will be ehdl Friday, May 10, at 1 p.m. at First Baptist Church of Wylliesburg, with Rev. Opie Terrell delivering the eulogy. Burial will follow in Ivy Hill Cemetery, Chase City.\n\nPublic viewing for family and friends will be held on Thursday, May 9 from 10 a.m.-6 p.m.\n\nOnline condolences may be expressed at www.harrisfhc.com.\n\nArrangements are by Giles-Harris Funeral Home and Cremation Service."
