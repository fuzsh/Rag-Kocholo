        "text": "The past few days have been crazy; anyone else ready for spring? I love the sound of birds singing at my window bringing me joy this morning as I sit through and blog one of the sweetest weddings from last November.\n\nWhen I first met Anna Lee, I knew she was going to be such a sweetheart to work with. I absolutely fell in love with her and Seth during their engagement session and their easy-going love reminded me so much of Paul & myself. I really appreciate couples who share so much kindness & friendship, just as much as romance. I have enjoyed every step of the way with these two and they are the kind of people that make you feel like you have known them forever! This wedding party was so fun and you can see their love for Anna Lee & Seth throughout the day! My favorite moments are the first reveal of Anna Lee showing her bridesmaids her dress, the first look between her and Seth, her gorgeous gown, and the beautiful hue of lavender that gave this wedding a unique color palette. I loved the simple elegance of it all. And Lisa Hankal, of Hankal Events, knocked it out of the park with planning and coordinating! We had a great team and everything came together beautifully!! Here are a few favorites that make me smile!\n\nXOXO,\n\nAmy\n\nHair & MUA: Cucumber & Mint\n\nDress: Elegant Bridals\n\nBow Tie: Brackish Bow Ties\n\nPlanning & Coordination: Hankal Events\n\nTrolley: SouthStar Trolley\n\nFlorals: Flowers On Broad\n\nSecond Photographer: Stephanie Davis\n\nVenue: Storey Chapel"
