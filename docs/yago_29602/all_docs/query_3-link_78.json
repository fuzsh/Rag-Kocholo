        "text": "Nice to meet ya!\n\nMy name’s AnnaLee Talley Keehner ––Anna for short!\n\nGet to know me!\n\nI began my musical journey in south Georgia playing music in our local church and with my family.\n\nAfter moving to Vero Beach, I attended Indian River Charter High School and excelled in the Visual & Performing Arts Program, which propelled me to start playing shows right after graduating in 2010.\n\nAfter marrying my high school sweetheart in 2012, I officially and happily became AnnaLee Keehner. Coming from such a strong musical background, I decided to continue my solo music career using my maiden name, Talley. As a full time musician, I not only play solo shows but I also play with my husband in our duo, Purrbox along with being the staple members in the band Souljam for 9 years.\n\nWhat does she sound like?\n\nI’m so glad you asked!\n\nAfter many years of performing, my list and genres of songs have grown to entertain a diverse crowd. Expect to hear original songs and tunes from the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s with songs of today sprinkled in between. I love playing music of all genres such as classic rock, funk, country, reggae, pop, jam, bluegrass, and many more. My sound is percussive and gives an energetic feel along with a soft soulful side."
