        "text": "Born Joan Boniface Winnifrith on January 2, 1913, Anna Lee is best known for her portrayal of General Hospital’s Lila Quartermaine, a character who she brought to life for over two decades. From her early years in England to her final days in Hollywood, she recounts details of her extraordinary life in her memoir. Expressed in her energetic style, Anna Lee tells of her childhood as the daughter of an English clergyman and her early determination to become an actress. She writes of her teenage struggles to realize her dream, two failed marriages, and the difficulties she faced raising a family while maintaining her career. Finally, we see the picture of a mature Anna Lee—a successful actress playing a role she loved while enjoying an ideal marriage to writer Robert Nathan. Personal remembrances from her family and General Hospital co-stars round out this touching, entertaining self-portrait of the actress’ life. A complete filmography and list of television appearances is also included.\n\nAcknowledgments by Barbara Roisman Cooper vii\n\nForeword by Maureen O’Hara 1\n\nPreface by Barbara Roisman Cooper 3\n\nIntroduction by Anna Lee 5\n\n1.
