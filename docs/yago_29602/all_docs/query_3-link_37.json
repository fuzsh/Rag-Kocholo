        "text": "Lee Anna \"Lee Ann\" Dixon, 61, of Syracuse, IN passed away at 8:20 p.m. on Friday, July 20, 2018 at Visiting Nurse & Hospice Home in Fort Wayne, IN. She was born on April 2, 1957 in Peru, IN to Edmond John & Barbara S. (Oberlin) Lucas.\n\nShe grew up in Peru, graduated in 1975 from Peru High School, and moved to the Syracuse area in 1983 from Peru. She formerly operated her own cleaning service in Syracuse, was a child care provider in Syracuse, and was the caretaker for the Enchanted Hills swimming pool.\n\nShe was a member of the Red Hat Society in Syracuse, formerly attended the New Life Christian Church & World Outreach in Warsaw, and assisted with the Wawasee High School Marching Band & Wawasee High School Swim Team for many years.\n\nHer dear friends describe her as God’s gift and a half step away from a hippie. She was fierce, strong, full of love, and life. She was lover of hats and all things that sparkle. A strong woman of faith, she taught the word of God to any one she encountered. Living and showing Grace to everyone.\n\nAlthough her parenting did not end with her children as she raised 3 out of 4 of her grandchildren. Her youngest granddaughter lovingly calls her Grandma Ouchie. She taught them to enjoy the little things in life- homemade pizza, brownies, tea parties, and blanket forts. Many other children who grew up around her remark on her amazing mothering spirit, and the times they had with her. While our hearts mourn the loss of her amazing spirit, we know that she leaves a little sparkle in every heart she touched.\n\nShe is survived by:\n\n2 Daughters – Theresa Hanger of Wabash & Stephannie (Jerad) Brickey of Fort Wayne\n\n4 Grandchildren - Amber, Delmar, Madison, and Logan\n\n2 Sisters – Dana Wouster of New Mexico & Keely (Tim) Fultz of Cromwell\n\nBrother – John Lucas of Goshen\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents – Edmond Lucas & Barbara Gagen and brother – Michael Joseph Wouster II.\n\nVisitation will be from 5:00 – 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, July 25, 2018 at Owen Family Funeral Home, 1001 S. Huntington St., Syracuse, IN. Cremation will follow at Cremation Services of Kosciusko County, 4356 N. St. Rd 15, Warsaw, IN. Burial will take place in the Milford Cemetery at a later date.\n\nPreferred memorials may be given to the Visiting Nurse & Hospice Home, 5910 Homestead Rd., Fort Wayne, IN 46814."
