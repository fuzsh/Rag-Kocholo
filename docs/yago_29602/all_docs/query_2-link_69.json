        "text": "Anna Lee Mitton Dransfield was born August 19, 1928, to Samuel LeRoy (Roy) and Johann (Smith) Mitton in Dixon, Illinois. She was their middle child and only daughter. Her father had been in training with the Borden Milk Company in Dixon. The Mitton family then moved to Logan when she was 6 weeks old, never to return to Dixon. They soon transferred after that to Tempe, Arizona where they lived until she completed 2nd grade. The family then moved again back to Logan, Utah where she had many aunts, uncles, and cousins on both sides of the family. They lived in a house next door to her grandparents, Samuel Bailey and Mary (Hawkins) Mitton.\n\nLogan truly was her hometown. Anna Lee worked at the local movie theaters as a teenager until she married. (The Capital, Roxy, and Lyric) She started out working the candy counter, moved up to usher, and finally worked as a cashier in the outside booth in front of the theater doors. Anna Lee graduated from Logan High School in 1946 and then attended Utah State Agricultural College, now Utah State University, majoring in Early Childhood Development.\n\nAnna Lee and Arnold Spencer Dransfield (Spence) met on a blind date, and they quickly began dating regularly. They were married February 4, 1949, in the Logan Temple. After Spence’s graduation, he accepted a job with the Bureau of Reclamation as a Soil Scientist and they moved to Walla Walla, Washington, where their first child, JoAnn was born. After a short transfer to Wenatchee, Washington they were assigned to Boise, Idaho, where they built a home and welcomed four more children: Arnold Robert (Bob), Roy Thomas, James Spencer (Jim), and Mary Lee. In 1968, Spence took a promotion and the family moved to Boulder City, Nevada, where Anna Lee lived for the next 38 years.\n\nHer sweetheart, Spence, died in 1984, leaving her a widow for the next 38 years. In the early 2000’s, Anna Lee found herself with four of her five children living in the Treasure Valley area in Idaho, so she made the decision to move back to Idaho where she lived the rest of her life.\n\nA lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Anna Lee served in many positions including Primary President, Relief Society President, teacher, and most importantly, a dedicated Visiting Teacher. Her compassion, kindness, unconditional love, and marvelous cooking and baking were noted by many as she tirelessly served those around her.\n\nAnna Lee was remarkably healthy, living on her own with minimal support from her children and grandchildren, until her fall at home in September 2022. When family could no longer meet her needs, she moved to assisted living with hospice support. She left this life to join her beloved husband and other family members on December 24, 2022.\n\nAnna Lee was preceded in death by her husband, parents, grandparents, and grandson Robert with his wife Odalys. She leaves behind her brothers George L. Mitton and W. Reid Mitton (Sanna Lee), her children JoAnn (Robert Blout), Bob (Susan), Roy (Sue), Jim (Rachel), and Mary Lee (Greg Winzenried), 18 grandchildren, and 43 great grandchildren.\n\nThe funeral service and the visitation for Anna Lee are listed below – a link for a livestream of the service will be provided before service time and will be listed below as well:"
