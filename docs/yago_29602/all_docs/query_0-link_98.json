        "text": "Paralysed from the waist down in a car accident just a year after she began playing Lila Quartermaine in ABC’s General Hospital, Lee acted in a wheelchair for more than two decades until she left the soap last year, Byron said.\n\nBorn Joan Boniface Winnifrith in Kent, Lee studied acting in London and was known as “the British bombshell” when touring with the London Repertory Theatre, her son said.\n\nIn the early 1930s she moved to California to work in Hollywood, and appeared in more than 60 films including The Sound of Music (1965), Fort Apache (1948) and King Solomon’s Mines (1937).\n\n“She was beautiful,” said actress Maureen O’Hara, who starred with Lee in 1941’s How Green Was My Valley. “She went to the United States and immediately everybody fell in love with her.”\n\nO’Hara said Lee was most effective as an actress in straightforward tales of love and family life. “She made you feel, looking at her, that you belonged to the same family as her,” she said.\n\nIn 1982, Lee received an MBE. She is to be honoured with a lifetime achievement award at Friday’s Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony.\n\nLee was married three times, first to Robert Stevenson, the director of films including The Love Bug and Mary Poppins. She was married to George Stafford for two decades and wed writer Robert Nathan in 1970. Nathan died in 1985.\n\nLee is survived by a sister, Ruth, two sons, two daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held in Los Angeles in several weeks, Byron said."
