        "text": "Archived Articles\n\nThis month we are happy to introduce the first installment of a series of articles we plan to offer regularly on our website called Authors of the Past, where we hope to introduce you to out-of-print books by excellent writers who now speak only through the printed pages of their books. We hope these installments will be of interest to readers, collectors and booksellers who visit our site, and we welcome your feedback.I have chosen to begin this series with a profile on the author (Janet) Taylor Caldwell (1900-1985)\n\nAUTHORS OF THE PAST :\n\nTaylor Caldwell\n\nTaylor Caldwell was born in Manchester, England and in 1906, while still a child, immigrated to the United States (Buffalo, New York) with her family. She had a rather unhappy childhood. Her parents were uninterested in her, and told her it would have been better had she not been born.\n\nPerhaps because she was unhappy, she began writing at a very young age, even before leaving England at the age of six. She wrote plays, music and poetry for her Sunday school class in Buffalo. She married as a teenager and lived in the hills of Kentucky for five years with her first husband and daughter. After their divorce, she returned to Buffalo where she was a court reporter in the New York State department of Labor from 1924 to 1931. There she met Marcus Reback, a customs agent. She married him and had a second daughter. Most of her life as writer was spent at her home in Buffalo, New York.\n\nShe is well known for her historical fiction. Dear and Glorious Physician is a well-researched historical novel about the life of Saint Luke, his life as a physician, his doubts of God and religion and the ultimate triumph of his faith. The Earth is the Lord’s (1941) is a fictionalized account of the life of Genghis Khan; A Pillar of Iron (1965), is a fictional biography of Cicero, the senator and orator of ancient Rome.\n\nAnother book of Caldwell’s which is a favorite (and difficult to find) is Grandmother and the Priests, a tale about a girl who goes to live with her wealthy old Irish Aunt in England, and is entertained weekly by a group of priests who regularly come to the home as dinner guests and tell wonderful stories at the table. Her works also include mystery (The Late Clara Beame) and stories of families conflicted between love, money and power (such as Melissa and A Prologue to Love).\n\nSURPRISING FACTS ABOUT TAYLOR CALDWELL:\n\nThe Romance of Atlantis, published late in her career, was based on her childhood dreams and writings of her life in Atlantis, and was originally written when she was twelve years old.\n\nAt one point in her life, she was quite depressed over the loss of her husband of 40 years, Marcus Reback. “I don’t wish to write anymore, only to die”. She was told by several psychics she would go on to write five more books…which she did.\n\nShe was considered to be psychic, and saw many psychics and a hypnotist at the encouragement of Jess Stearn. While under hypnosis, she revealed tales of past lives in other lands including England, France, Greece, and South America. Purportedly, it was her subconscious memories of these past lives which supplied all the extremely detailed historical information as she wrote. A book was written about her experience with regression to past lives under hypnosis: The Search for a Soul: Taylor Caldwell’s Psychic Lives by Jess Stearn. (One paperback copy available through our site).\n\nShe worked on Dear and Glorious Physician for forty years, traveling to the holy lands and Greece and conducting years of research. Although she wrote much about faith and God, and was raised as a Catholic, she was nearly agnostic for much of her life. It was her “nagging belief” in some form of life after death which inspired much of her writing and led her to agree to experimentation with psychics and a hypnotist. Her book Dialogue with the Devil (1967), comprised of conversations between Lucifer and Michael and weighing good against evil, may be a representation of the conflict in her own mind and heart on this matter.\n\nTaylor Caldwell had two children and was married four times. She died in Greenwich, Connecticut on September 2, 1985.\n\nHer literary awards include the National League of American Pen Woman gold medal (1948), Buffalo Evening News Award (1949), and Grand Prix Chatvain (1950). Her books sold over 30 million copies during her career.\n\nBelow is a Taylor Caldwell bibliography:\n\n• DYNASTY OF DEATH, (1938)\n\n• THE EAGLES GATHER (1940)\n\n• TIME NO LONGER (1941)\n\n• THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S (1941)\n\n• THE STRONG CITY (1942)\n\n• THE ARM AND DARKNESS (1943)\n\n• THE TURNBULLS (1943)\n\n• THE FINAL HOUR (1944)\n\n• THE WIDE HOUSE (1945)\n\n• THIS SIDE OF INNOCENCE (1946)\n\n• MELISSA (1948)\n\n• THERE WAS A TIME (1948)\n\n• LET LOVE COME LAST (1949)\n\n• THE BALANCE WHEEL (1951)\n\n• THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (1952)\n\n• MAGGIE - HER MARRIAGE (1953)\n\n• NEVER VICTORIOUS, NEVER DEFEATED (1954)\n\n• YOUR SINS AND MINE (1955)\n\n• TENDER VICTORY (1956)\n\n• THE SOUND OF THE THUNDER (1958)\n\n• DEAR AND GLORIOUS PHYSICIAN (1959)\n\n• THE LISTENER (1960)\n\n• A PROLOGUE TO LOVE (1962)\n\n• GRANDMOTHER AND THE PRIESTS (1963)\n\n• THE LATE CLARA BEAME (1964)\n\n• A PILLAR OF IRON (1965)\n\n• WICKED ANGEL (1965)\n\n• DIALOGUES WITH THE DEVIL (1967)\n\n• TESTIMONY OF TWO MEN (1968)\n\n• GREAT LION OF GOD (1970)\n\n• GROWING UP TOUGH (1971)\n\n• CAPTAINS AND KINGS (1972)\n\n• TO LOOK AND PASS (1973)\n\n• GLORY AND THE LIGHTNING (1974)\n\n• THE ROMANCE OF ATLANTIS (1975)\n\n• CEREMONY OF THE INNOCENT, (1976)\n\n• I, JUDAS (1977)\n\n• BRIGHT FLOWS THE RIVER (1978)\n\n• ANSWER AS A MAN (1981)\n\nPseudonyms: Marcus Holland; Max Reiner A number of these books are available for purchase here on our website.\n\nKenneth Lewis Roberts (December 8, 1885 – July 21, 1957)\n\nPHOTO by Harold Stein, NY One of America’s most popular historical novelists, Kenneth Lewis Roberts was born in Kennebunk, Maine in 1885. He is perhaps best known as the author of Northwest Passage (Doubleday Doran & Co., 1937), an important historical novel set in early New England. He wrote many additional colorful and historically accurate novels, as well as non-fiction books (bibliography appears at end of this article).\n\nHe was educated at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York where for two years he was Editor in Chief of The Cornell Widow, a humor magazine. Graduating from Cornell in 1908, he worked as a reporter and columnist for the Boston Post. After serving in World War I as a Military Intelligence Officer, he worked as a correspondent for The Saturday Evening Post, writing on conditions in Europe, the United States and the Orient after the war. He gave up that position in 1928 when he began writing extensively researched historical novels. His first book Arundel, was about the American Revolution and the War of 1812, and was published in 1930. Over the next several years he wrote Lively Lady, Rabble in Arms, and Captain Caution.\n\nAt first his novels were not well received by critics, who panned them as weak in plot structure and character development, among other criticisms. But his fortunes turned around when Dartmouth College bestowed an honorary doctorate upon him in 1934. The President of Dartmouth lauded him as the preeminent author of historical novels about early American life, depicting the times with accuracy and giving new insights into the characters and personalities of important figures of the times. Colby College joined in shortly afterwards and also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.\n\nThe publication of Northwest Passage (1937) propelled him into the spotlight. Hugely popular, it reinvigorated sales for all of his previous novels as well. Northwest Passage made the best seller list in 1937. A year later Bowdoin College and Middlebury College gave Roberts honorary doctorate degrees. Before his death, Roberts was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize for his historical novels, particularly for Northwest Passage.\n\nKenneth Roberts often attributed the positive transformation of his literary reputation to Dartmouth College’s bold recognition of his work. In gratitude for this, when he died most of his manuscripts and papers were given to Baker Library at Dartmouth. This library holds the largest collection of Roberts source material in the world, occupying eighty-nine linear feet of shelf space and includes galley proofs, autographed books, research material, personal diaries, scrapbooks, photographs, memorabilia, and more.\n\nHe was a voracious reader, who often made lots of notes and comments in the margins of books as he read (most of these books from his personal library are also installed in the Roberts Collection at Dartmouth’s Baker Library).\n\nRoberts was a man of wide ranging interests and passions. In addition to historical novels, he wrote non-fiction on subjects ranging from immigration to black magic. Later in his life he became deeply interested in “dousing” or “water-witching” and wrote several books on the subject, much to the chagrin of some of his friends and associates, who were not converts to the practice of using a divining rod to locate water. He formed a corporation called Water Unlimited with Henry Gross, a game warden who was gifted at water dousing. He also wrote a book by the same name. Gross and Roberts traveled the world advocating the practice and (often successfully) helping people locate water. Roberts endured quite a bit of mockery and ridicule for this practice at the time.\n\nBooks by Kenneth Roberts are still in great demand today, and fine first editions of many of his books command high prices. More importantly, his stories inspired many readers to become avidly interested in American History.\n\nKenneth Roberts died on July 21, 1957 and is buried in Arlington Cemetery.\n\nFor more information on Kenneth Roberts’ life and books, visit these links:\n\nwww.izaak.unh.edu/specoll/mancoll/roberts.htm (University of New Hampshire)\n\nhttp://ead.dartmouth.edu/html/ml25.html#N10220 (Dartmouth College)\n\nhttp://www.waterborolibrary.org/maineaut/r.htm#roberts (Waterboro Public Library, Waterboro, Maine)\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\nEurope's Morning After (1921)\n\nWhy Europe Leaves Home: A True Account of the Reasons Which Cause Central Europeans to Overrun America (1922)\n\nSun Hunting: Adventures and observations among the native and migratory tribes of Florida, including the stoical time-killers of Palm Beach, the gentle and gregarious tin-canners of the remote interior, and the vivacious and semi-violent peoples of Miami (1922)\n\nThe Collector's Whatnot: A Compendium, Manual, and Syllabus of Information and Advice on All Subjects Appertaining to the Collection of Antiques, Both Ancient and Not So Ancient (1923) authored by Kenneth Roberts and Booth Tarkington using the pen names of Cornelius O.

NATHAN\n\nThere is no distance on this earth as far away as yesterday. – Robert Nathan\n\nNovelist, poet, musical composer, screenwriter: Robert Nathan was all of these.\n\nAuthor Robert Nathan is perhaps best known for his book Portrait of Jennie, a haunting romantic fantasy which was made into a 1948 movie produced by David O. Selznick. Selznick became so obsessed with the compelling story that he spent several years and millions of dollars on its production, casting his lover Jennifer Jones in the leading role. The setting for the book is 1930’s New York City, where a talented but starving artist falls in love with a beautiful young woman who seems to come from another time. This ageless book and movie has developed a cult following over the years, and both are in demand to this day. Much of Nathan’s writing has an essence of gentle fantasy and other-worldliness, delving into the mysteries of life.\n\nSeveral other novels by Robert Nathan were made into films, including The Clock (1945, starring Judy Garland and Robert Walker) and The Bishop’s Wife (made into a 1947 film under the same title and starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven; remade again more recently as The Preacher’s Wife, starring Denzel Washington). The Clock was a beautiful story in both book and film, filled with suspense and understated romance, as well as a sense of humanity. The Bishop’s Wife has long been a perennial Christmas-time favorite.\n\nNathan’s book One More Spring (1933) focused on the lives of a group of displaced people living in Central Park during the Great Depression, and how they helped each other cope with their bleak lives. It was made into a film directed by Henry King and released in 1935.\n\nThe Enchanted Voyage (1936), a story about the search for a missing soldier, was filmed as Wake Up and dream in 1946.\n\nNathan wrote prolifically, producing forty novels, two children’s books, two non-fiction books and ten books of poetry in his lifetime. He also wrote screenplays while working in Hollywood for MGM, including The White Cliffs of Dover (1943) and the movie adaptation of his own The Clock.\n\nBorn in New York City on January 2, 1894 into a fairly wealthy family, he attended Harvard University, although he never graduated. He did begin writing short stories and poetry while enrolled there, and married his first wife while in his junior year. He soon dropped out of Harvard to support his family with a job in advertising. During this time he wrote his first novel Peter Kindred (1919) which was semi-autobiographical in nature. It didn’t fare well with the critics, but during the 1920’s he wrote seven more novels, including his very successful The Bishop’s Wife. Through his continuing output of well-received novels and anthologies of poetry, he became a highly respected writer during the 1930’s and 40’s.\n\nNathan had a distinctly musical side. He composed a violin sonata and music for the works of Walt Whitman, A. E. Housman, and Dunkirk (all were performed in New York City). His own poems were set to music by leading composers of that era.\n\nMarried seven times, Nathan’s first five marriages ended in divorce. His sixth wife died and in 1970 at the age of 76 he married British actress Anna Lee. The marriage was a happy one for both of them and endured to the end of his life, when he passed away at age 91.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nNovels:\n\nPeter Kindred, 1919\n\nAutumn, 1921\n\nThe Puppet Master, 1923\n\nJonah, 1925\n\nThe Fiddler in Barly, 1926\n\nThe Woodcutter’s House, 1927\n\nThe Bishop’s Wife, 1928\n\nThere is Another Heaven, 1929\n\nThe Orchard, 1931\n\nOne More Spring, 1933\n\nRoad of Ages, 1935\n\nThe Enchanted Voyage, 1936\n\nWinter in April, 1938\n\nJourney of Tapiola, 1939\n\nPortrait of Jennie, 1940\n\nThey Went On Together, 1941\n\nTapiola’s Brave Regiment, 1941\n\nThe Sea-Gull Cry, 1942\n\nBut Gently Day, 1943\n\nMr. Whittle and the Morning Star, 1947\n\nLong After Summer, 1948\n\nThe River Journey, 1949\n\nThe Innocent Eve, 1951\n\nThe Married Look, 1951\n\nThe Train in the Meadow, 1953\n\nSir Henry, 1955\n\nSo Love Returns, 1958\n\nThe Rancho of the Little Loves, 1956\n\nThe Color of the Evening, 1969\n\nDigging the Weans, 1960 (chapbook)\n\nThe Wilderness-Stone, 1961\n\nA Star in the Wind, 1962\n\nThe Devil With Love, 1963\n\nThe Fair, 1964\n\nThe Mallott Diaries, 1965\n\nStonecliff, 1967\n\nMia, 1970\n\nThe Elixir, 1971\n\nThe Summer Meadows, 1973\n\nHeaven and Hell and the Magas Factor, 1975\n\nChildren’s Books:\n\nThe Snowflake and the Starfish, 1959\n\nTappy, 1968\n\nNon-fiction:\n\nThe Concert, 1940\n\nJournal for Josephine, 1943\n\nPoetry:\n\nYouth Grows Old, 1922\n\nA Cedar Box, 1929\n\nSelected Poems, 1935\n\nA Winter Tide: Sonnets and Poems, 1940\n\nDunkirk: A Ballad, 1942\n\nMorning in Iowa, 1944\n\nThe Darkening Meadow, 1945\n\nThe Green Leaf, 1950\n\nThe Married Man, 1962\n\nEvening Song: Selected Poems 1950-1973, 1973\n\nMany of Robert Nathan’s books are available on our website!\n\nMARGERY SHARP:\n\nBritish author Margery Sharp (1905-1991) had a long and successful career as a writer of both adult and children’s fiction, and several plays. She is perhaps best known for her children’s books, particularly the series which began with The Rescuers (1959), the delightful tales of a family of smart and daring mice which was adapted into an animated movie by Walt Disney. Margery Sharp wrote additional outstanding children’s books—fourteen in all.\n\nIn her book Children’s Writers, Margaret Greaves commented: “Only a child who reads well can fully enjoy these books, for their subtlest appeal is that of language itself, a delight in words and the rhythm of words for their own sake. These are books for the connoisseur, and blessedly have no design at all upon the reader except that of entertainment.”\n\nBut her novels for adults (26 of them) are magical as well, for Margery seemed to understand the nuances of the nature of mankind and was able to create very honest and human characters in her books. Her stories also have intelligent subtle humor and irony woven throughout.\n\nOne of my favorites is The Flowering Thorn (1932), the story of a fashionable young woman who has everything she wants (materially) and is living the “good life” in a London apartment, flitting from party to party and hanging out with her oh-so-gorgeous friends. Because of a brief lull in her enjoyment of these activities, and a set of circumstances which presents itself to her at a vulnerable moment, she impulsively decides to adopt a young boy whose mother has just died.\n\nThis sets off a chain of events, starting with the loss of her exclusive apartment (they don’t accept children), eventually leading to her taking a small cottage in the country--all of this to the utter shock and disbelief of her friends and family. Her snooty friends promise to visit her there (which happens only once, with rather disastrous results) and she struggles both inwardly and outwardly over her impetuous and life-altering decision and new circumstances. She really knows nothing about children or life in the country. She is aware of the stigma of being a single woman with a child, a child who many logically assume is her own issue and an illegitimate one at that. In the end, she comes to learn a great deal about life and friendship. The book also passes along some surprising and shrewd insights on what really is important in raising a well-adjusted child.\n\nI haven’t read all of Margery’s books, but I have never read one I haven’t liked! The Foolish Gentlewoman was both humorous and wise; and I thoroughly enjoyed Britannia Mews. Most of these books are out of print but still obtainable at reasonable prices and can be located without too much difficulty. A few of the early ones are harder to find, and her first and exceptionally well written novel Rhododendron Pie is rare indeed.\n\nMargery’s “Rescuer” books for children are listed below:\n\nThe Rescuers\n\nMiss Bianca\n\nThe Turret\n\nMiss Bianca in the Salt Mines\n\nMiss Bianca in the Orient\n\nMiss Bianca in the Antarctic\n\nBernard into Battle\n\nBernard the Brave\n\nMiss Bianca and the Bridesmaid\n\nAdditional children’s books are:\n\nLost at the Fair\n\nThe Magical Cockatoo\n\nMelisande\n\nThe Children Next Door\n\nAdult Fiction:\n\nRhododendron Pie (1930) - First novel, extremely rare\n\nFanfare for Tin Trumpets (1932)\n\nThe Nymph and the Nobleman (1932)\n\nThe Flowering Thorn (1934)\n\nSophy Cassmajor (1934)\n\nFour Gardens (1935)\n\nThe Nutmeg Tree (1937)\n\nHarlequin House (1939)\n\nThe Stone of Chastity (1940)\n\nThree Companion Pieces (1941)\n\nCluny Brown (1944)\n\nBritannia Mews (1946)\n\nThe Foolish Gentlewoman (1948)\n\nLise Lillywhite (1951)\n\nThe Gipsy in the Parlour (1954)\n\nThe Eye of Love (1957)\n\nSomething Light (1960)\n\nMartha in Paris (1962)\n\nMartha, Eric and George (1964)\n\nThe Sun in Scorpio (1965)\n\nIn Pious Memory (1967)\n\nRosa (1970)\n\nThe Innocents (1972)\n\nThe Lost Chapel Picnic and Other Stories (1973)\n\nThe Faithful Servants (1975)\n\nSummer Visits (1977)\n\nPlays:\n\nMeeting at Night (produced in London, 1934) Lady in Waiting (produced in New York, 1940; London, 1941) The Foolish Gentlewoman (produced in London, 1949, 1950) The Birdcage Room (Play for television, 1954)\n\nOld Scrolls Book Shop stocks books by Margery Sharp whenever we can locate them in clean, solid condition and generally have at least two or three available in collectible condition\n\nWHO IS AYN RAND?"
