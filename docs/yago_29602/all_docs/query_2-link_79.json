        "text": "Former nurse to the Salt Lake Valley for over 50 years, Anna Lee Segura Higgs, was born April 28, 1932 to Harry and Velma Lunceford and passed away May 2, 2022 surrounded by her loving family. Anna Lee grew up with a thirst for education and love of her church that shaped how she lived - to serve others with compassion and respect in her profession and in her daily interactions with each life she touched. Anna Lee grew up in Lehi, Utah. Anna Lee completed her Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing from the University of Utah on an academic scholarship. Later in life she completed her Masters Degree in Nursing from the University of Phoenix.\n\nAnna had a letter-only courtship with the love of her life, Thomas R. Segura Sr., whom she married in the Salt Lake Temple and had eight children that they raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. After sharing wonderful years with Tom, paths diverged and Anna had a second marriage to Charles Higgs.\n\nIn addition to raising a large family, Anna Lee began her career as an emergency surgical nurse for Salt Lake County Hospital, formally on 2100 South and State Street, which later became The University of Utah Medical Center. She went on to serve in the position of Head Nurse for Granger Community Hospital. Anna Lee’s service could not be contained to one facility, as she continued her career as the Jordan District School Nurse, serving nine schools at the time. After many years in this role the district asked Anna Lee to serve as the nurse and a teacher for the multi-handicapped young people, ages preschool to 22. Anna Lee referred to these young people as her angels as they needed to be fed, turned and positioned, have their personal hygiene attended to and while doing all those things, developing ways of communication to provide cognitive stimulation. This was not work others endeavored to obtain yet Anna Lee loved her time with her angels.\n\nIn the summers she served as nurse to the Migrant School Program where she helped developed health guides to track the children of the field workers, ensuring they received physical exams and dental care. Anna Lee went the extra mile by visiting the parents of children in the fields to help provide education on extra health and dental training needs. The National Migrant Program honored Anna by having her as the keynote speaker for the National convention in 1987. Anna’s impact on lives reached beyond cities, states, and country boarders.\n\nAfter retiring from the Jordan School district Anna continued her career as a home health care and hospice nurse until she retired at the age of 72. Anna nursed people at the time when AIDS was misunderstood and never hesitated to provide the needed care and emotional support a patient required. During this time Anna also worked at the Odyssey House for Women and Children. She cared for husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, as they exited this mortal life, and provided relief to the patient and their families.\n\n“ “What do you think you should do?” ”\n\nAs accomplished as Anna Lee was in her professional life, her priority was always her children and grandchildren. She raised 8 children largely on her own and showed unconditional love and support throughout our lives. She was always there for us and we knew we were important. She provided us with a moral compass, always giving loving guidance in life’s decisions. Her sage council would often be, “What do you think you should do?” She was someone we could go to and pour out our hearts and not be judged. Her grandchildren and great grandchildren were lucky to have her wonderful hugs and unconditional love. Anna Lee was a compassionate, caring and selfless person. She truly was without guile. She has lived a life worthy of her place in the eternities.\n\nSurvived by children, Dr. Thomas R. Segura (Stacey), Harry A. Segura (Denise), Tonya L. Makoff (John – deceased), LeeAnna Ventura (George), Julie M. Ricks (Ryan), Jodie M. Neff (Gregory), Ezra L. Segura (Teresa), Richard F. Segura (Carri), 33 grandchildren and 58 great grandchildren.\n\nPreceded in death by, parents Harry and Velma Lunceford, sister Iva Mae Lunceford, husband Thomas R. Segura Sr., husband Charles Higgs.\n\nThe family would like to publicly thank Dr Nedda Hendler for her compassionate care and guidance to ensure our Mother lived her last few years to the fullest. Dr. Hendler never gave up on Anna Lee and was always positive while keeping Anna Lee involved in all medical choices. We would also like to thank the caring staff of Legacy Sugarhouse Memory Care Cottage. They are the stuff angels are made of and they became an integral part of our family and Anna Lee’s last 10 months of life.\n\nViewing May 13, 2022 for family and friends from 6pm to 8pm at Memorial Mortuary & Cemeteries, 5850 S. 900 East, Murray Utah.\n\nFuneral May 14, 2022 at 12pm (viewing from 10am to 11:30am) Ensign Stake Center 135 A Street, Salt Lake City Utah.\n\nInterment immediately following funeral, Lehi Cemetery, 1100 North 400 East, Lehi, Utah.\n\nStreaming services will be provided using the following link:\n\nhttps://webcast.funeralvue.com/events/viewer/73312"
