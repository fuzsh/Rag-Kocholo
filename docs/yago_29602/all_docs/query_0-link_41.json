        "text": "Robert Nathan, who wrote the 1940 novel ''Portrait of Jennie'' and more than 50 other books of poetry and prose, much of it fantasy, died of kidney failure Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 91 years old.\n\nThe historian Herbert Feis wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1965 that Mr. Nathan ''has now been writing long enough for the youngest generation - the grandchildren of those who read his earliest books - to begin to respond to his wry and dreamy tales when they are tired of the all-too-familiar dreadful realities.'' Mr. Feis found that by enveloping those realities ''in a transparent gauze of imagination and tinting them with irony, he relieves their hurt.''\n\nMr. Nathan's writing career spanned more than 70 years, from the campus novel ''Peter Kindred'' (1914) to the fantasy novel ''Heaven and Hell and the Megas Factor'' (1975), which Martin Levin, writing in The Times Book Review, called the work of ''an old spellbinder at the top of his form.''\n\nFor much of his life Mr. Nathan wrote a book every year or two. All his books, his admirers said, were well turned, and some of them became best sellers, although many critics objected to his mixture of whimsy and fantasy.\n\nStories Came to the Screen\n\n''Portrait of Jennie,'' probably his most widely known novel, written while he lived on Cape Cod, was a whimsical tale of an impecunious artist who encounters a mysterious young girl. It later became a movie starring Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten. Also written on Cape Cod was Mr. Nathan's 1928 novel ''The Bishop's Wife,'' made into a film with Cary Grant.\n\nMr. Nathan was born Jan. 2, 1894, in New York, the son of Harold Nathan and Sarah Gruntal Nathan. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, and wrote about a lonely, shy student at those two schools in his first novel, ''Peter Kindred.''\n\nA handsome, amiable, courteous man, he wrote traditional romantic poetry - 10 volumes in all - reminiscent of that written in the years preceding World War I. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1935, was president of American P.E.N. from 1940 to 1942 and also served as Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.\n\nMr. Nathan moved to the West Coast during World War II, and worked as a screenwriter for M-G-M for almost a decade.\n\nHis first five marriages ended in divorce, and his sixth wife died.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 15 years, Anna Lee Nathan, the actress who plays Lila Quartermaine on the daytime television series ''General Hospital,'' and by a daughter, Joan Bergstrom, of Miami."
