        "text": "American jockey and trick rider\n\nAnna Lee Aldred (April 19, 1921 â€“ June 12, 2006) was an American jockey and trick rider in rodeos. She was the first woman in the United States to receive a jockey's license. She pursued her professional horse racing career from 1939 to 1945, winning many races at state and county fairs. She then pursued a second career as a trick rider from 1945 to 1950. She was inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Lee Mills was born in Montrose, Colorado, on April 19, 1921.[1] Her father, Tom P. Mills, was a horse trainer and racer, and raised horses together with her mother, Dottie (nee Marlow) Mills.[1][2] She had two brothers who became rodeo champions, and two sisters who also performed in the rodeo.[1][2][3]\n\nAnna Lee began riding at a young age.[4] She won her first pony race at age 6 in an amateur competition in Montrose, and was participating in flat and relay races by age 12.[2][4] She raced at amateur tracks in Colorado and Wyoming.[5]\n\nIn 1939, at age 18, she received her professional license from the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Baja California, Mexico, becoming the first U.S. woman to receive a jockey's license.[3][5] Aldred said in a 2003 interview that the racetrack officials had tried to deny her application, but could not find a written rule that only men could race horses.[7]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nShe lost her first professional race by a nose, but went on to win \"scores\" of other races at state and county fairs.[3] During her racing career, she weighed 100 pounds (45 kg).[3] But by 1945, having grown too tall at 5' 5\" and weighing in at 118 pounds (54 kg), she retired from horse racing.[2][3]\n\nShe opened a riding school in California, and then embarked on a five-year career as a trick rider in rodeos.[5] She taught herself trick-riding skills at night in empty arenas.[8] Among her tricks were \"standing atop the saddle of a horse bolting down the arena\"[3] and \"hanging by her foot from the side of a running horse\".[5]\n\nShe quit her professional career upon marrying in 1950,[7] but continued riding until she was 80.[2] She served as a \"pony boy\", leading the racehorses out to the track of the Montrose Fairgrounds before races, and also appeared in rodeo ceremonies.[5]\n\nAfter breaking her hip at age 80,[2] she entered a nursing home in Montrose. There she slept under a horse blanket.[3]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nAldred was inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1983[4] and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2004.[2] She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Plateau Horseman's Hall of Fame in 2018.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1950, she married Wayne Aldred, a cattleman, in Raton, New Mexico.[1] The couple adopted a son and a daughter; their daughter was killed in a motorcycle accident while in her early teens.[8] She and her husband divorced after 35 years of marriage.[8]\n\nAldred died in a Montrose nursing home on June 12, 2006, at the age of 85.[8]\n\nHer 1939 racing license, in the form of a small wooden badge, and her blue and white racing silks, are exhibited at the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas.[3][5]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nSimon, Mark (2007).
