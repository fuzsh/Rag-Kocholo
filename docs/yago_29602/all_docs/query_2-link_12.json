        "text": "Anna Lee, whose acting career included her breakthrough role in the 1941 film ''How Green Was My Valley'' and an extended run on the daytime television drama ''General Hospital'' that ended last year, died on Friday at her home here. She was 91.\n\nThe cause was pneumonia after several months of ill health, said her son Jeffrey Byron.\n\nShe was paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident just a year after she began playing the wealthy, British-accented Lila Quartermaine in ''General Hospital'' and acted in a wheelchair for more than two decades, until she left the soap opera last year, Mr. Byron said.\n\nBorn Joan Boniface Winnifrith in Kent, England, Lee studied acting in London and toured with the London Repertory Theater, often in glamorous roles. She became known as ''the British bombshell,'' Mr. Byron said.\n\nIn the early 1930's she moved to California to work in Hollywood, and appeared in more than 60 films, including ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) and ''King Solomon's Mines'' (1937).\n\nIn ''How Green Was My Valley,'' she played Bronwyn Morgan, the sister-in-law of the star, Maureen O'Hara. When she was nearing retirement age, her role on ''General Hospital'' rejuvenated her, Mr. Byron said.\n\nIn 1982 Ms. Lee received an M.B.E., or Member of the Order of the British Empire award. She is to be honored with a lifetime achievement award at the Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony on Friday.\n\nMs. Lee was married three times, first to the director Robert Stevenson, She was married to George Stafford for two decades and wed the writer Robert Nathan in 1970; he died in 1985.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Byron, Ms. Lee is survived by a sister, Ruth; another son, Stephen; two daughters, Venetia and Caroline; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren."
