        "text": "Dallas and Anna Lee Ward provide Biblical discipleship and mentoring to encourage individuals to grow to maturity in Christ, while also equipping them to more effectively reach and genuinely love others.\n\nCurrently on home mission assignment with Commission To Every Nation (CTEN), the Wards previously served fourteen years in foreign missions in Mexico and Trinidad & Tobago where they labored to establish a discipleship program and to train others to disciple new believers. They served two years as Biblical counselors in conjunction with Global Frontier Missions, preparing missionaries-in-training for their upcoming assignments around the world.\n\nIn their work with marriage and families in crisis, Dallas and Anna Lee draw from their years of married life since 1986. They share from many years of intensive parenting experience which they gained while providing therapeutic foster care in their home to more than thirty children, who had been removed from families in crisis.\n\nDallas and Anna Lee's preparation for marriage and family ministry includes completed training in various counseling methods (ADT, SACC, NACC). The Wards have completed debrief and renewal (DAR) training with Paracletos and provide missionary and grief debriefing. They are also certified marriage facilitators. They have counseled and mentored numerous individuals, married couples and families through critical issues over twenty years.\n\nThe Wards have one daughter, Rebecca, who lives in Florida with Joab and their grandson Owen.\n\nStatement of Faith\n\nGod and Man\n\nWe believe in one God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The triune God has created man in His own image and has called him to manifest and reflect holiness through obedience to His commandments. Because man has woefully fallen in this responsibility and entered into a state of moral corruption, he has subsequently become estranged from his Creator.\n\nJesus Christ\n\nBecause of a profound love for His creation, God has initiated a plan of redemption which He has accomplished on behalf of His people in the realm of temporal history. The zenith of this redemption is located in the historical incarnation of God in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. We confess Jesus to be the Christ of Old Testament prophecy, being at the same time fully God and fully man. Jesus, through His substitutionary atoning death and bodily resurrection, has provided the meritorious basis of our justification, which, by God's grace, we receive by faith alone.\n\nThe Holy Spirit\n\nProceeding from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit dwells in the hearts of believers, effecting their regeneration and operating in their sanctification. The same Holy Spirit has been given to the people of God to empower them for the service of bearing witness to the kingdom of God. The Holy Spirit brings His people together to form a corporate community of believers. We believe that Christ has established a visible church which is called to live in the power of the Holy Spirit under the regulation of the authority of Holy Scripture, exercising discipline, administering the sacraments, and preaching the Gospel of Christ.\n\nThe Bible\n\nWe believe that the Bible, in its entirety, is divine revelation, and we submit to the authority of Holy Scripture, acknowledging it to be inerrantly inspired by God and carrying the full weight of His authority.\n\nWe support the work of Christian organizations and institutions that confess the Lordship of Jesus Christ. We are committed to the implementation of the social and cultural implications of God's commandments for the well-being of man and his environment. We believe our faith should be visible in concrete forms and models of personal and social behavior. We seek to be faithful disciples of Christ, enduring in love and obedience until He comes again to consummate His kingdom."
