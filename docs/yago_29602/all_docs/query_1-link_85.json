        "text": "Anna Lee buzzes around the \"General Hospital\" sets in\n\na motorized wheelchair as the show's matriarch Lila Quartermaine,\n\nthen drives home at night.\n\nAfter 55 years in the business, still a beauty, sharp as\n\na tack and always in control, Anna Lee could easily go on\n\nforever on the soap. Although the actress rummages through\n\nshoeboxes to put together her memoirs, Miss Lee has no intention\n\nof retiring. Not with Gloria Monty returning in 10 days\n\nas \"General Hospital\" boss, since Gloria originally hired\n\nthe British actress 14 years ago.\n\nAnna Lee's Lila was a vibrant Quartermaine turning husband\n\nEdward Quartermaine (David Lewis) to butter. Then one day\n\nAnna's left leg became useless. Neurologists never did figure\n\nout the cause, even after a nine-and-a- half-hour operation.\n\nFitted out with a leg brace, Anna returned to the show,\n\nleaning on two canes and then one. After bumping into cameras\n\nand other objects, she took to the wheelchair, a beaming\n\nbeauty, not a poor, sickly soul crying for sympathy.\n\nAssuming Anna Lee had multiple sclerosis, one viewer wrote\n\nin praising the actress for her courage and cheerful mien.\n\nLila Quartermaine made viewers feel better regardless of\n\nher handicap. It never occurred to Anna Lee to take any\n\nother approach. Her back gave out the other day on the set,\n\nyet Miss Lee drove home. \"I have one good leg,\" she said.\n\n\"That's sufficient.\"\n\nThe actress remembers friend, actor Herbert Marshall, getting\n\nabout on a wooden leg. \"Herbert had a hole in his pants\n\npocket so he could reach down and unbuckle a knee strap\n\nto ease discomfort during a scene,\" recalled Miss Lee.\n\n\"But I can't do that with a skirt, and then work through\n\na slip. We haven't figured that out yet. I can still drive.\n\nI refuse to give that up.\"\n\nOver a year ago, Edward Quartermaine's David Lewis decided\n\nto retire because he had memory problems, so the writers\n\nkilled him off in a Bermuda Triangle accident. Anna Lee\n\nwanted David back, so she suggested the \"Topper\" movie\n\nidea where Roland Young's dead character conversed with\n\nthe living. The idea works on \"General Hospital.\" David\n\nLewis reads his lines as a ghost, discussing family problems with Lila.\n\nOn camera martini glasses float through the air, cigar smoke\n\nrolls under door jams, and the Quartermaines think Lila\n\nhas gone potty, talking and drinking by herself. It's a\n\nnice, light touch as life with two civilized oldsters continues.\n\nOn \"General Hospital\" you don't just quit, you can always\n\nreturn as a ghost.\n\nAfter three husbands, including director Robert Stevenson\n\n(\"he was dull\"), a crazy World War II flying Texan, and\n\nauthor Robert Nathan (\"my best marriage\"), four children\n\nand five grandchildren, acting careers in England and Hollywood,\n\nAnna Lee has seen it all.\n\nYou sit on a Rudolph Valentino couch in her living room,\n\nlisten to anecdotes about director John Ford and Gen. George\n\nPatton, and learn about the early movie days when Anna talked\n\nto Greta Garbo at parties and laughed with Robert Benchley.\n\nAsk about the Persian Gulf situation and the actress smiles.\n\n\"I was there with Jack Benny entertaining the troops in\n\nWorld War II. When Jack left the U.S.O. group Adolph Menjou\n\ntook his place.\"\n\nNot bad for an English beauty expelled at age 16 from acting\n\nschool because she landed an extra's job in a movie, something\n\naspiring theater performers looked down on in the 1930s.\n\nSoap Q & A\n\nQ. Who played Nicole on the old soap \"The Edge of Night\" back in 1974? My\n\ndad says it was Dixie Carter. - Nicole Kleppinger, Philadelphia, Pa.\n\nA. Carter was in \"Edge\" 1974-76, but she played Brandy Henderson. Three\n\nactresses played Nicole Travis, Maeve McGuire, 1968-74, 75-77; Jayne\n\nBentzen, 1978-81; Lisa Sloan, 1981-83.\n\nCHANNEL CHATTER\n\nIt's always a happy day when a recurring character on a\n\nsoap opera gets to become a contract player. What that means\n\nis a part time employee gets to join the firm. The latest\n\nactor to become a contract player on \"All My Children\"\n\nis Gregory Gordon, who plays Brian Bodine, the young man\n\nwhose father, Kurt, is an alcoholic and whose mother has\n\ndied. His guardian is Myrtle Fargate (Eileen Herlie). Gregory\n\nwill also be seen in the December 6th ABC Afterschool Special\n\ntitled \"Stood Up.\"\n\nPLOT PORTENTS\n\nVi concerned about Johnny Dee, tells Tina the truth about\n\nher other self, Niki in \"One Life to Live.\" They go to\n\nClint with the news but he insists Niki Smith is gone forever.\n\nCarlo spies on Tony and Gab while his henchman videotapes\n\ntheir activities. Cord tells Tina he can no longer hide\n\nhis love for her and Tina is thinking of leaving Llanfair.\n\nAlex and Riley believe there is a definite connection between\n\nthe money laundering operation in San Felipe and Off-Limits\n\nin \"Loving.\" Dane steals the Eddie Grant letters from\n\nShana's briefcase. Alex tells Jack he must leave for San\n\nFelipe immediately and Stevie tells AZ to kill Louie. Carly\n\nmakes sure Ava finds an old photo of Carly with Paul.\n\nHayley steals money from Trevor to go shopping and when\n\nhe finds out, he puts her on bus bound for Chicago but she\n\ngets off at Center City in \"All My Children.\" Eric tells\n\nTravis that she will fake a happy marriage for the sake\n\nof their child, Bianca. Ceara dreams she marries Jeremy\n\nand Opal tries to convince Palmer to rehire Will but he\n\nstands fast in his decision not to hire him.\n\nIf Ben dies from the heart attack on \"The Bold and the\n\nBeautiful,\" Jake will not mourn, or feel guilty over the\n\nlast confrontation. Stephanie takes Thorne's word and looks\n\nfor a new man. Clarke tells Julie not to fall in love with\n\nhim, but wants an affair.\n\nThanks to Frankie, Jack and Jennifer rescue the Salemites\n\nfrom Lawrence's earthquake on \"Days of Our Lives.\" Tom\n\nsays he never gave up, certain Alice and the others had\n\nthe will to survive. Isabella will nurse stroke victim Kiriakis.\n\nWatching Sam make wedding plans with Jordan on \"Generations,\"\n\nMaya has plans for Adam. Kyle says he loves Sam, but Sam\n\nand Jordan stand before the minister. Doreen is advised\n\nto sweet-talk Martin and may change his mind over divorce.\n\nEden can save Kelly after seeing the twins on \"Santa Barbara.\"\n\nAfter buying his way back to the D.A.'s office, Keith wants\n\nto marry Gina, and Brandon gives his approval. Robert and\n\nCruz return in the nick of time to save Kelly.\n\nDavid denies any connection with Vivian's death in a tub\n\non \"The Young and the Restless.\" Cassie fights with Brad,\n\naccusing him of seeking part of the Rawlins empire. Nathan\n\nencourages Drucilla and thinks of her sister Olivia.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
