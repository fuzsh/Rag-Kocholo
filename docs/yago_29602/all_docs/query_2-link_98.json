        "text": "Anna Lee Root Howell, age 92, passed away peacefully on April 1, 2024, at Prisma Health Oconee Memorial Hospital, Seneca, SC following a fall, with her loving family by her side. A daughter of the late Edward and Lillie Jones Root, Anna was born August 24, 1931, in Garrard, Kentucky. She was predeceased by her husband William Lee (Bill) Howell and six siblings: Alton Root, James Edward Root, Charles Joseph Root, James Little Root, Ora Root, and Della Root.\n\nAnna is survived by her two daughters, Lillian Howell Rumsey and husband, J.W. of Walhalla, SC, and Cathy Howell Ferrell and husband, Steve of Clover, SC; four grandsons, Wesley Rumsey (Amanda), Daniel Rumsey, Adam Ferrell (Celeste) and Mark Ferrell (Angel); two great-granddaughters, Caroline Belle, Carson Anna Rumsey and great-grandson, Dillon Dunbar (Heather).\n\nAnna’s occupation and lifetime career was in Business Law, Banking Finance, Banking Accounting (1951-1976), and Commercial Retail Business (1976-1997). In the retail business, she was dedicated to making available to local patrons creative, affordable custom-designed furniture, including home interior design & home interior decorating during the 21 years she and Bill successfully owned and operated Howell Furniture Company in Clyde, NC. Anna greatly enjoyed being active in the community, creative in design work, and delighted in serving others. There was never a job too large or too small that she would not tackle.\n\nAfter retiring, Anna and Bill returned to the family homestead farm located on Jonathan Creek in Waynesville, NC where they enjoyed very much simply being together; farming, gardening, cooking, traveling, spending quality time with family and friends, and as Anna often stated fondly, helping raise Bill’s Charolais cattle. Married in July 1951, Anna and Bill were inseparable for 62 years before his passing in 2013. They were active members in Lake Junaluska First Baptist Church, Clyde, NC, and (after retirement) Dellwood Baptist Church, Waynesville, NC which was closer to home. Anna greatly enjoyed being a member of both Church Choirs and Senior Adult Classes. She eagerly looked forward to and tirelessly worked to decorate the church for many special events/holidays. She also participated in any needed food preparations: making casseroles, baking cakes, setting cheerful tables, and warmly welcoming visitors as she helped prepare and serve many of the delicious meals at the monthly 1st Tuesday Senior Adult Lunch Programs.\n\nIn addition, during her years as a loving and caring mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, Anna was also an active member in the Waynesville Chapter No. 165 Order of the Eastern Star (Past Worthy Matron); The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls (Advisor), “Meals-on-Wheels” Program (Coordinator & Volunteer), Salvation Army (Volunteer), Girl Scouts (Leader) and was a continuous hard worker raising funds to support The Masonic Home for Children in Oxford, NC and the Shriners Hospitals for Children, helping to make a difference in a child’s life. Anna touched many in her Christian walk sharing God’s love and kindness with others.\n\nHer life was a living example of one of her favorite Bible verses, Ephesians 4:32 — “And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ.”\n\nMost of all Anna loved her family and instilled in us strong Christian values that have served us well. She will be dearly missed and forever in our hearts.\n\nA celebration of Anna’s life will be held on Sunday, April 7, 2024, at Wells Funeral Home, Waynesville, NC. The family will receive friends from 2:00 pm before the 3:00 pm service begins in the Chapel with Rev. Barry Willett officiating. A reception will follow the service at the Wells Events & Reception Center. A private graveside service will be Monday, April 8, 2024, at Crawford/Ray Memorial Gardens, Clyde, NC. The family is receiving friends and family at Anna’s home on Jonathan Creek, 183 Cicero Lane, Waynesville, NC 28785.\n\nIn lieu of flowers memorials may be made to Shriners Children's Hospital, 950 West Farris Road, Greenville, SC 29605."
