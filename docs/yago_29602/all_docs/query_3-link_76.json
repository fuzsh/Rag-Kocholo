        "text": "Geraldine “Deanie” Marie Snyder Warren was born on September 15, 1933, to Paul Elbert and Mary Jane Hays Snyder. She was the youngest of six children: Paul E. Jr., Donald, Wallace, William A., Patsy J., and Deanie. Raised in Hagerstown, Md., Deanie enjoyed her close-knit family. Deanie met Lee Warren, her cherished husband of 66 years, through family. He was serving in the U.S. Navy when they married on August 17, 1952, in Hagerstown. Over a 16-year period, they were blessed with four children: Jenny Lee, Vickie Ann, David Michael and Daniel Patrick.\n\nAlthough Deanie worked in various jobs over the years, she saw her primary role as taking care of Lee, her children and their home. The family moved to Middletown in 1968. Their house on Willowtree Drive was home for nearly 55 years. Under Deanie’s roof, everyone was welcome. Supper was always on the table at 5 p.m. and anyone who was lucky enough to be there joined the family at the table. There was always plenty.\n\nDeanie raised her children using a healthy dose of love and wisdom. She was always there to bandage a skinned knee or comfort hurt feelings. When her children needed guidance or correction, she was fair but firm.\n\nDeanie's skills were varied and many. She enjoyed sewing, knitting, crocheting, quilting, cross-stitching and embroidery. She also applied her talents to basket making and even caning chairs. She enjoyed the process of learning something new, working with her hands and giving her handmade creations to those she loved. In the kitchen, Deanie baked many family favorites including apple dumplings, apple pies, homemade bread and sticky buns.\n\nDeanie was devoted to her husband, and they enjoyed many activities and adventures together. When the family was young, they spent many weekends camping, boating, and water skiing on the Potomac River. As the children grew up and moved away from home, Deanie enjoyed cross-country trips riding on the back of Lee’s Honda Gold Wing motorcycle and sharing the adventure with family and friends.\n\nDeanie was the beloved matriarch of four generations. She and Lee found great joy in their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Each of their children married spouses who were warmly welcomed into the Warren clan: Jenny’s husband, Terry Carnahan; Vickie’s husband, Dale Biggs; Dave’s wife, Camille Evans; and Daniel’s wife, Jill Van Cott. Deanie is known affectionately as Mommaw to her nine grandchildren, Sarah, Nick, Katie, Lauren, Emma, Anna, Luke, Isabelle and Gabriel; and six great-grandchildren, Gavin, Lucas, Emily, Finley, Maggie and Sandoe. Whether lying on the floor playing with the little ones or sitting at the table dealing cards, Deanie always enjoyed a good game or a challenging puzzle.\n\nDeanie was devoted to God and dedicated to His church. She faithfully served at Christ Reformed United Church of Christ in Middletown for 55 years. Whenever a need arose for cooking, cleaning or preparing the building for an event, Deanie was there. She also co-led the youth group with her husband, served on the altar guild and was a long-term member of the women’s guild where Deanie eagerly participated in many activities designed to foster fellowship and raise funds.\n\nDeanie worked hard to perfect some of her abilities. What came easily to her was loving others. Love was the foundation of all her relationships, and she always saw the good in each person. We miss you, we thank God for you and we love you, Mommaw.\n\nFuneral services will take place at 12:15 p.m. on Saturday, August 10, 2024, at Christ Reformed United Church of Christ, 12 S. Church Street in Middletown. The family will receive friends from 10 a.m. until noon on Saturday at the church. Final resting place ceremonies will be held at the adjoining church cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the charities links below.\n\n“And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.”\n\nI John 4:16"
