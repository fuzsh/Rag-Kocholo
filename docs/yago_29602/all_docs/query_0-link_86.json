This is peculiarly unfortunate because, of all towns which became units in the newly formed County of Jefferson in 1805, and later, Hounsfield has had the most interesting and significant history. Its pioneer settlement, the stirring incidents of the War of 1812, both on land and water, all revolved around Sackets and vicinity. And subsequent activities, both in pioneering and settlement of land, and in the construction of private industries and public facilities such as \"Camp's Ditch,\" the proposed boat canal from Hounsfield to Carthage; the building of war frigates at Sackets; the construction of Madison Barracks in town, with its successive garrisons and military glamour; the continuous life-stream of New England and Mohawk Valley settlers who poured into town from 1803 onward; all these things, properly told, would make the story of Hounsfield interesting, informative and very colorful.\n\nJefferson County was set off from Oneida County, as a separate unit, Mar. 28, 1805. {1} Hounsfield, the eighth town in the county, was formed out of Watertown Feb. 17, 1806, and was named after Ezra Hounsfield of Sheffield in England who was an early purchaser of land in town. Hounsfield was part of the \"Black River Tract\" (300,000 acres) granted in the year 1802 to certain English land speculators, among whom was one George Lee of London.\n\nOn May 21, 1794 Boylston (proprietor of unsettled lands in Oneida County) deeded eleven townships, in what is now Jefferson and Lewis counties, to George Lee, George Irving and Thos. Latham, who resold to John Rhyn of London. In 1795 Rhyn appointed William Constable as his attorney to sell and convey any part or all of the Boylston Tract. Constable accordingly reconveyed July 15, 1795 to William Low, William Henderson, Richard Harrison & Josiah Hoffman 300,000 acres, since known as the \"Black River Tract,\" at $1.00 per acre. This tract included the present towns of Hounsfield, Watertown, Rutland, Champion, Henderson, Adams, Rodman, Worth and Lorraine (in Jefferson County) and Denmark, Pinckney, Harrisburg, Lowville (in Lewis County). Hounsfield lands were sold, 1801, to Peter Kemble and Ezra Hounsfield, who resold to the early settlers through Elisha Camp.\n\nHounsfield, chartered July 15, 1795 as part of the Boylston Tract (being the first township carved out of the Black River Tract, above referred to) was first settled by Amasa Fox about 1800. He made a pitch near what is now Muscalonge Cemetery. {2} In 1802 there were about 30 families in town. Augustus Sacket settled where now is Sackets Harbor in 1802. The first town meeting was held Mar. 4, 1806, electing Augustus Sacket moderator, William Waring town clerk, John Root constable. Dr. William Baker was the earliest physician, 1803. Samuel Luff the first minister- a Universalist from England, 1806. The first paper in Sackets was the Sackets Harbor Gazette published by George Camp 1817 to 1822. Other and later periodicals were The Freeman's Gazette, 1824-43; the Sackets Harbor Courier, 1828-37; Sackets Harbor journal, 1838-43. The ferry to Pillar Point was established in 1821. Dexter, at the head of Black River Bay, was first known as Fish Island.\n\nThe descendants of George Lee, after holding a family picnic at Catfish Point in 1907, met at Jones' Opera House in Dexter and organized the Lee Family Association. Since then they have held meetings annually, usually in the midsummer, at convenient places around Dexter or Watertown occasionally at the \"old stone house\" at Camps Mills; often at the Freeborn Lee camp at Guffins Bay on Pillar Point.\n\nIn 1937 the writer began assembling data for a history or genealogy of the Lee Family of Hounsfield. He labors under no illusions- as to the paucity of facts in his findings, nor as to the inaccuracies which he knows will be found here and there in the book. The historian can be no wiser or more dependable than his sources. And the \"sources\" in this case have necessarily included data that has been furnished to him voluntarily by members of the family. Their omissions and deletions be on their own heads! Nevertheless the research has been arduous, persistent and painstaking. Family recollections, bible records, cemetery and census records. County Clerk's and Surrogate's records, and various histories of Jefferson County (including Hough's, Haddock's and Evarts') have all contributed to the story; as has Child's Gazetteer of Jefferson County (1890)-and various other works of an historical nature. If the recital of facts herein recorded shall contribute, even in a small way, toward rescuing from oblivion the history of a deserving and talented family, and assist in reclaiming (for future use) a small segment of the local annals of Hounsfield town, then the intent and purpose of, the author will have been fully accomplished.\n\nNorth Montpelier, Vermont\n\nJune 1941.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION\n\nWalter John Coates died just one month after he published his first edition of The Lee Family of Hounsfield, N.Y. He was unable to complete his Genealogy of the Whitford Family in America or his other works in progress. The first edition was distributed mostly among family members and friends, some of whom carefully noted corrections and additions for its data. Input from Coates' sister Lois W. Morgan, his nephew Carl W. Morgan, and his niece Shirley A. LaMora was incorporated into this second edition. Mrs. LaMora's son-in-law, Dorsey Drane, gathered this input and prepared the second edition.\n\nThe second edition was prepared by scanning it into a computer using an flatbed optical page scanner, converting that input into an ASCII text file, and finally converting the ASCII text into a single HTML file supporting hyper links for all persons. Implementing the hyper links uncovered quite a few typographical errors and omissions from the Index of Persons in the first edition. These corrections were mostly mechanical tasks needing no research. The few instances where research would be required to resolve discrepancies are uncorrected and marked \"[sic]\". The second edition also attempts to change the tense of the writing from the present, which was in 1941, to the past. This is mostly done by simple changes like rewriting \"... and are now living in ...\" to \"... and in 1941 were living in ...\" Finally, the corrections and additions were added to the text, resulting in this, the second edition.\n\nâDORSEY BARNES DRANE\n\nBeaverton, Oregon\n\nMarch 1998.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION\n\nThe second edition was published on the Internet in about 2002. From then until now I continuously updated it with individual corrections and additions as they became known. The \"Last Updated\" date at the beginning of this page is changed each time I make revisions.\n\nSome individuals provided me with large numbers of additions, and their input has been accepted and added. It seemed to me that their additions were so many that creating a new edition of the book was justified. Primary contributors have been:\n\nCarl Morgan gave me copies of his notes to the First edition. Some of these were already incorporated in the Second Edition, but not all.\n\nMike Watts gave me his own notes, copies of Carl Morgan's final database, Mike's mother's annotated copy of the First Edition, and annotated family photographs, all of which he'd inherited.\n\nShirley A. LaMora, my mother-in-law, died. I am now in possession of her annotated copy of the First Edition as well as all her newspaper clippings, birth and death announcements, funeral books, and genealogical notes.\n\nLance Boutwell gave me copies of his notes about his Boutwell, Dening, and Meiss relatives. I inserted the Boutwell and Dening additions into Walter Coates' original text, and the Meiss additions were added as a \"related family.\"\n\nAaron DiLapi gave me a copy of the manuscript The Boshart Family Copy No. 2, by Ernest Nohle. This let me add Boshart descendants to the Meiss and Dening lines.\n\nWhen possible, I tried to expand what has been provided by searching the following sources:\n\nAncestry.com - a private online source of genealogical databases, including many federal and state vital records.\n\nFind A Grave - an excellent source for locating graves and obtaining genealogical data, barring the usual caveats. Many records do not cite their sources, but some do. Photographs of tombstones are excellent sources.\n\nNorthern New York Genealogy - an excellent source for Northern New York genealogy, principally Jefferson and Lewis Counties.\n\nOld Fulton NY Post Card Website - an excellent source for old New York state newspaper articles.\n\nFinally, I upgraded the HTML source from the pigeon HTML 1.0 that I used for the Second Edition to \"Valid HTML 4.01 Transitional.\" The Third Edition now can display its certification: The conversion to valid HTML necessitated that I abandon some hacks that I'd used to simulate the formatting of the original edition. Too, as I was adding people to the text, I realized that many of the formatting conventions that Coates used were to reduce the physical size of the edition. For instance, he seldom gives the last names for lists of children. I then stopped removing them when making additions. Consequently, the appearance of this edition differs more than might have been expected.\n\nâDORSEY BARNES DRANE\n\nSilverton, Oregon\n\nThu Dec 8 16:50:57 PST 2011\n\nGEORGE LEE\n\nAnd His Descendants\n\nTHE PARENTAGE of GEORGE LEE, and the town that cradled his birth, are as much a mystery in 1941 as they were four years ago, when the author of this book first undertook the task of investigating his antecedents and descendants. Family legends, interesting and very plausible, have been run to earth, only to prove themselves fictitious, without basis in fact. The story of his having been an orphan boy, taken into the protective custody of one kindly Col. Westcott, and brought along to Hounsfield in pioneer days, before 1812, proves to be utterly unsupported by evidence. He was not, so far as we can discover, a \"ward\" of anybody; and there is no evidence of a \"Col. Westcott\" having been in Hounsfield town (or in Jefferson County, in fact) at that period. The true relation of George Lee to the Westcott family is much simpler than that, as will be unfolded in the pages of this narrative.\n\nIn the New York State Census, 1855 (see folio in County Clerk's Office) George Lee stated to the enumerator that he was born in Albany County, N.Y.; and we know, by family bible records, that the date of his nativity was April 2, 1791. No research (extensive and thorough as we have conducted it) has as yet developed just who were his parents. As be was born the year following the First U. S. Census (1790), it is reasonable to suppose that his father was one of those Lees listed as \"Heads of Families\" in Albany County at the time. The families so listed include [numerals refer to males over 16, males under 16, and females, in family]:\n\nBallston town: Samuel Lee (1-1-5) (family)\n\nBallston town: James Lee (1-3-3)\n\nFreehold town: Joel Lee (3-0-2)\n\nPittstown town: John Lee (1-4-2)\n\nRensellaerville town: Philemon Lee (1-1-7)\n\nRensellaerwick town: Peter Lee (1-0-1)\n\nRensellaerwick town: Ephraim Lee (2-2-4)\n\nSaratoga town: William Lee (1-3-1)\n\nSaratoga town: Reis Lee (1-0-1)\n\nStephenstown town: John Lee (1-0-2)\n\nStephenstown town: Joseph Lee (1-3-2)\n\nStephenstown town: John Lee Jr. (2-0-2)\n\nStephenstown town: Thomas Lee (1-0-1)\n\nStephenstown town: Benjamin Lee (1-2-3)\n\nIt is well to remember that in 1790 neither Saratoga nor Rensellaer counties had been formed. Ballston, Saratoga and Stephenstown, therefore, were soon afterward parts of other counties. In other nearby New York towns (1790) were other Lee families:\n\nWestfield town: Nathan Lee (1-1-1)\n\nWestfield town: Jonathan Lee (1-5-3)\n\nGranville town: William Lee (1-2-3)\n\nGranville town: Zadock Lee (2-1-4)\n\nSome future student may possibly, from among the above families, discover the real parentage of George Lee of Hounsfield, N.Y.\n\nGeorge Lee was in Hounsfield July 1, 1817. A letter addressed to him was advertized, as of that date, in the Sackets Harbor Gazette (issue of July 29, 1817), \"to be called for\". {3}\n\nOn Dec. 29, 1817 he bought of Elisha Camp of Sackets Harbor four acres of land in Hounsfield-\"reserving the land whereon the pound is situated.\" This plot was located at Camps Mills and adjoined the land then owned by Stephen Seaman.\n\nSettling, then at Camps Mills, George Lee made preparations for the establishment of his future. On March 11, 1821, he married Olive Baker, daughter of Nathan and Abigail (Westcott) Baker who had come to Hounsfield from Deerfield, Oneida, Co., about 1807, settling near Stowells Corners. Abigail was born probably in Deerfield, and died at Camps Mills August 15 1852, aged 53 [cem. insc.].\n\nSoon after his marriage in 1827 George Lee bought of John Worden, for $700.00, sixty acres of land adjoining his first purchase; and in 1828 he bought of William Waring's estate. 7 1/2 acres more land adjoining his growing farm. He thus gradually built up the homestead; and on this, in 1834, he constructed the substantial 1 1/2 story stone house in which he and his family thereafter resided. This fine old house, probably one of the most pretentious of its day in Hounsfield, is still standing, on the road between Dexter and Adams Center, at Camps Mills, less than two miles from Sackets Harbor, and in 1940 was owned and occupied by David Miller. In the east gable, high up under the ridgepole, is engraved in bold letters the brief legend \"G Lee.\" And at this old house, which has become an object of pilgrimage to the offspring of its builder, the later Lees now gather occasionally in silent tribute to their pioneer ancestor.\n\nGeorge Lee continued to buy land. In 1835 he bought of John Worden and wife of Pamelia (for $245.00) 25 acres-probably adjacent to his other purchases; and we find the census of 1855 crediting him with 126 acres of improved and 30 acres of unimproved land, with a valuation of $7,800.00. His personal list this year included stock, $867.00; tools, $213.00; 150 bushels of wheat; 120 bushels of oats; 187 bushels of rye; 646 bushels of barley; and he was plowing that year 64 acres.\n\nHe did some outside real estate business also, for we find him buying Sept. 1828 of Egbert Ten Eyck of Watertown, eight acres of land in Watertown \"on the Rome State Road.\" The thrifty nature of the man, and his wife, is indicated by the early figures of the 1825 State census for Hounsfield, which list him, four years after marriage, with a small farm of 30 acres supporting four cows and five horses, thirty-five sheep, three hogs, fifteen yards of fulled cloth, and seventy-six yards of flannel. This modest beginning expanded into the prosperous estate listed above, in the 1855 census.\n\nOne important trait of George Lee's character has been passed down as an inheritance to most of his descendants, namely, his love of and talent for music. He was, like so many of his progeny, a natural and confirmed violinist, and when be came to Hounsfield in 1817, a young man of twenty-six, he brought with him the old black violin which was cherished as a family heirloom. In 1941 it was in the possession of George A. Coates, a great-grandson, and was still capable of voicing mellow memories.\n\nTradition says also that George was a lover of fine saddle horses, and that he raised many of them, selling them to military officers at the nearby army post in Sackets Harbor.\n\nThe Lee family were hospitable people. At frequent intervals the old stone house rang gaily to the strains of the black fiddle, while neighboring folk and officers from Madison Barracks danced and made themselves merry by the big open fireplaces or on the spacious green lawn.\n\nOlive Baker, his first wife and mother of his children, had both Irish (from the Bakers) and English (from the Westcotts) antecedents. {4} After her death in 1852 the husband lived on the homestead with his unmarried children until June 18, 1861, when he married (2) for convenience and companionship, the widow of a late neighbor- Mary, formerly the wife of William Waring. The agreement between them at this time is interesting:\n\nPRE-NUPTIAL AGREEMENT {5}\n\n\"Agreement between George Lee of the first part and Mary Waring, widow of William Waring, deceased, of the second part, made this 7th day of June 1861: Whereas the parties intend to marry, and in consideration that they shall do so, the said George Lee agrees to cause to be paid to the said Mary Waring at and after his death, if she shall survive him, the sum of $600.00, she releasing and hereby agreeing to release all dower and right of dower in and to his real estate; such payment to be made by the personal representatives and heirs and devisees of the said George Lee at his death, and the same shall release all such right of dower, and the said George Lee agrees with the said Mary Waring, whenever she shall require it, to secure such payment on his farm in Hounsfield, now owned and occupied by him, containing one hundred and fifty-six acres, bounded north by Patrick Scanlon, Thomas Dunbar and the road, south on Van Allen, and westerly on same, and easterly on William Stevenson. And this ante-nuptial agreement is made on the consideration above mentioned and that the parties respectively shall faithfully perform and observe toward each other the duty of husband and wife. In witness whereof they have hereto set their hands and seals the day and year above written.\n\nGEORGE LEE (L.S.)\n\nMARY A. WARING\n\nRecorded Sept. 4, 1861.\n\nGeorge Lee died April 9, 1864, leaving a will. He was buried in the small stone-walled cemetery not far from his farm, beside Olive, his first wife, and two children who died early. Mary (Waring) Lee spent her last years in Utica, N.Y.-date of death not known.\n\nTHE WILL OF GEORGE LEE\n\n\"In the name of God, Amen.

He was tall, spare, of unusual strength, a noted wrestler in his day. Once a bully, coming into town, bragged that he could lick any man in the County-and inquired for \"Wash\" Lee. He met up with \"Wash\" in a cornfield, inquiring: \"Are you 'Wash' Lee?\" \"Yes,\" replied the object of his search. \"I've come up here to lick you.\" \"Wash\" peeled off his coat and vest, and they fought.

In youthful days she played the violin, along with her sisters and brothers.\n\nMr. Gibbs (whose parents were among the founders of the Universalist Church in Dexter) spent his boyhood at Dexter, N.Y., attending school there and learning farm work from his uncle, Hon. Albert Foster. In 1884 Burte's father, who had been engaged in woolen manufacturing, became a ranch owner in Anoka, Minn. There the youngster worked on the home farm, wrote newspaper items and taught school on the side. Coming East in 1890, he entered Canton Divinity School (St Lawrence University) at Canton, N.Y., graduating 1893. During all these college years he did student preaching at Scipio and at Winthrop, N.Y., and in 1893 became the pastor of his home-town Universalist Church in Dexter. In June 1893 be was ordained at Herkimer, and, having just been married, he and Nannie settled down to their first pastorate, in Herkimer. Five years of strenuous constructive labor here built up a strong Universalist parish; and in 1898 he was called to the leadership of All Soul's Universalist Church in Watertown. Here again he built a weak church into a strong one-aided and encouraged by a tactful and devoted helpmate. In 1903 he went West, taking over the problems of a dormant Universalist church at Wasau, Wis. Once more his organizing ability scored a triumph. He left a church (which was still functioning after thirty-five years), to become minister to the Church of the Redeemer at Hoopeston, Ill. He remained here three years, when a call from the important Universalist Church at St Paul, Minn., came to him. Here he spent a fruitful six years.\n\nIn 1918 they returned East. After a short interim pastorate at Rochester, N.Y., be became leader, for one season, of the Universalist School of Religion at Murray Grove, N.J. The following autumn (1919) they settled in a memorable pastorate over the Universalist Church, Plymouth, Mass. Then followed another three year pastorate at Brooklyn, N.Y.-Church of Good Tidings. Then came fourteen years of happy and highly successful work as minister to All Soul's Church in Portland, Me., followed by three years more at Rumford.\n\nNever, during fifty years of active leadership, has Mr. Gibbs sought the glamor of office or tokens of emolument as such. His ministry was a consistent story of cheerful and voluntary hard work, the building up of weak parishes, the dissemination of a spirit of goodwill, courage and brotherly service among the peoples under his charge. Parish after parish has he built up, that others might benefit from his labors. He declares he was in 1941 still fit for duty and will never quit. The Lee reunions owe much to his initiative and untiring devotion.\n\nNICHOLAS ADDISON LEE [Addison H.; George]; born in Hounsfield Aug. 21, 1869; died Hounsfield (at Dexter) {14} Oct. 13, 1934.
