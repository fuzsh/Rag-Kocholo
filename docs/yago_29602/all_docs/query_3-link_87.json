        "text": "​About AnnaLee & Anchored Doula\n\nHi! I'm Annalee.\n\nBirth Doula (certified through Childbirth International) and the owner of Anchored Doula.\n\n​\n\nI'm a mountain girl married to a beach boy. We've had four amazing boys together. Justus is 20, Josiah is already home in heaven, Ethan is 17, and Drew is 12. They are my full-time job as we've homeschooled since preschool. It's an adventure and a blessing.\n\n​\n\nI love to read. I love pilates. I love a good cup of coffee in the quiet mornings. I love Jesus and owe my joy and hope to him. He is the ANCHOR of my SOUL. I love to help my family grow and heal as naturally as possible through diet, supplements, essential oils, and choices. I love birth and babies, too! But It wasn't always that way.\n\n​\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my first son, I was scared to death. I wanted to have him \"naturally\" but I did little to prepare for labor - I was afraid it would heighten my fear even more. His birth was not what I hoped for, to say the least. It was slightly traumatic and it took me a while to fall in love with the little person who now seemed to control my days (and nights!). I was scared to change his diaper, scared to give him a bath, cried while I nursed him, and felt so lost and confused. My body didn't feel like 'me' or 'mine' anymore and I just wasn't sure who I was in this new role. Don't get me wrong - I loved being a mother and loved my son deeply. I just didn't know who I was in it all.\n\nWith our second son, I happened to get the MOST amazing nurse on the planet. She never left my side and was the sole reason I made it through his birth without any medical interventions, except (as she said) a \"splash\" of narcotics to help my body to relax. And it was AMAZING. I felt so powerful, so confident, so truly ME. I was empowered to be the woman I was designed to be, encouraged to do my best, and with grace to help me get there. It was amazing.\n\nThat was when I first began to learn about doulas.\n\nWith my third son we hired a doula. She rocked it out. He was my longest labor, and emotionally very difficult as our second son had passed away shortly before I had conceived and I was still in the throes of grief and depression. She was there all day long. She breathed belief into me even as she pressed my hips together to relieve the pressure. Because of her support, I pushed out that 9lb 10oz baby boy who has been light and life ever since.\n\nMy fourth son, and last \"little\" one, was what I now consider a truly natural birth. He had a gentle water birth at The Charleston Birth Place in Charleston, SC. It was beautiful. Just me, my husband, the midwife... and then the baby. Absolutely beautiful. Peaceful and simple and everything birth can be. It wasn't perfectly smooth sailing; it was hard work. But I was leading the way: I was trusted, my body was trusted, and the birth was beautiful.\n\nI've desired to be a doula since my third son was born. But as our family was moving overseas, and then readjusting back to life in the U.S.... as a mom of young ones (and not living near family)... as a homeschool mom with lots of things on her plate... the time was never quite right. But moving back to Georgia near family and having older kids who are pretty self-reliant has opened up the door and here we are!\n\nI believe women are created to give birth. Our bodies are miracles! They can grow little people with souls and we don't (really) have any control over it... our bodies just know what to do. It's truly a miracle. I believe that YOU are able to birth without fear and without medical intervention if you don't want it. Your body knows what to do! I trust the God who shaped the process and loves you and your little one more than you can fathom. Birth is a natural part of life and living, and not a medical problem to be addressed with a medical solution unless circumstances demand it.\n\nI am passionate about helping women achieve the birth THEY want. Not what I did, or their mother or sister or best friend did. Not what everyone tells them they need to do or not do. But to empower them to have the knowledge and confidence to choose what is best for them and their family. I want you to walk away from your birth with joy because while it may not always go as planned, you felt loved, cared for, and respected throughout your pregnancy, labor, and birth. I want to encourage you to be the woman you were made to be!\n\n​I believe my role as a doula is to serve in the background. You and your husband are the star of this show. My job is to support you to make it happen. To stand beside you and give you your lines if you forget. I stay in the shadows and allow you to be immersed in the glory of what you are doing. I delight in being the woman who gets to be an intimate part of your story, but playing the role of letting you shine.\n\nI'd love to get to know you a little more and see if I'm the right fit for you and your upcoming birth. Everyone is different and you want to be sure that you choose a doula you feel comfortable with during one of the most important times of your life! I'd love to be her, but have no hard feelings if you decide someone else is the best option for you. Contact me below to schedule a no-expectations-chat about your hopes and fears and dream birth!\n\nLet's Get Together!\n\nI'd love to meet you in person - at a coffee house or a Chick-fil-a or in your home! Fill out the form below and I'll reach out as soon as possible. I'm looking forward to meeting you and finding out if I would be a good fit to work alongside you at the birth of your baby!\n\nPlease note in the comment box if you prefer a text or a phone call.\n\n* Indicates required field\n\nName *\n\nFirst\n\nLast\n\nEmail *\n\nPhone Number *\n\nDue Date *\n\nAdditional Comments or Questions *\n\nmy family"
