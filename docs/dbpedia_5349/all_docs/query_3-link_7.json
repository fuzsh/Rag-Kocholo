        "text": "Diyarbakır City Walls\n\nSur District, in the centre of Diyarbakır, has an intense history, starting from the Hurrians through to the Ottomans. The most important of their works are the walls that surround the city, featuring turrets with a bird’s-eye view.\n\nThe Diyarbakır City Walls (Diyarbakır Surları), which are on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list, are considered a monument and symbol of the city. The walls surrounded the city and consisted of two parts, the Inner Castle and the Outer Castle. In terms of age and height, the Diyarbakır City Walls are first among the world’s citadels. Diyarbakır Castle (Diyarbakır Kalesi), almost all of which has survived to the present day, has been standing for about 5,000 years. It has a spectacular solemnity with a width of between three and five meters, standing between 11 and 21 meters high. The 5,500-meter-long Diyarbakır City Walls are crowned with 82 bastions draped around the neck of the city like a necklace. It has the characteristics of an open-air museum, featuring 63 separate inscriptions and countless figures and reliefs dating from antiquity.\n\nHevsel Gardens\n\nHevsel Gardens (Hevsel Bahçeleri), set between the Diyarbakır City Walls and the Tigris River, extend from Mardinkapı to the On Gözlü (Ten Arches) Bridge in the west and Yenikapı in the east. This is a region of first-class agricultural land, thanks to the fertile alluvial soils carried by the Tigris River. The total size of the Hevsel Gardens, which is on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list, is approximately 4,000 decares, and in this area vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, green onion, parsley, cress, cabbage, radish, chard, arugula, tomato, pepper, eggplant, beans and zucchini are grown, along with trees bearing walnuts, figs, apricots, plums, cherries, mulberries and peaches. Another aspect of Hevsel Gardens is that it is a bird paradise hosting nearly 100 species of large and small birds; 79 species, including the European robin, Eastern olivaceous warbler, dove, tree pipit, red-backed shrike, common whitethroat and bee-eaters are observed in Hevsel Gardens. The willow warbler population grows during the spring, while the goldfinch lives in Hevsel Gardens throughout the year.\n\nİçkale Walls\n\nİçkale (the Inner Castle), which is separated from the city by an arc-shaped wall in the northeast corner of the walled area, is like a miniature of the Outer Walls (Dışkale) with the walls around it. According to studies regarding the date of its construction, İçkale, which underwent significant changes during the rule of the Artukids, took its final form under Ottoman rule in the 16th century. The Inner Castle has a total of four gates, called Saray, Oğrun, Küpeli, and Fetih. The gates of Fetih and Oğrun open to the outside, while the Saray and Küpeli gates open to the city centre. Each of the Inner Castle bastions, of which there are 18 in total, are equipped with different functions. The bastions, which were also used as a prison, and as storage for military equipment, weapons and ammunition, and grain and food, underwent significant changes in the Artukid and Ottoman periods.\n\nInner Castle (İçkale)\n\nDiyarbakır, an important cultural city, was considered a centre of cultural and economic activities for great civilizations throughout every period of history. The city centre was established at the point called İçkale (Inner Castle) in BCE 6000 at the Amida Mound (Viran Hill). Findings from the İçkale, as well as its location, suggest that the area functioned continuously as the city’s administrative centre throughout almost every period of its history. The Amida Mound (Amida Höyüğü), the Artuklu Palace (Artuklu Sarayı), Hz. Süleyman Mosque and the Tombs of 27 Companions (Hz. Süleyman Cami ve 27 Sahabe Türbesi), Saint George Church (Aziz George Kilisesi), the Lion Fountain (Aslanlı Çeşme) and the Artuklu Arch (Artuklu Kemeri) – now serving as the Archaeology Museum (Arkeoloji Müzesi) – are all in İçkale, as are the Restoration and Conservation Regional Laboratory (Restorasyon ve Konservasyon Bölge Laboratuvarı), Governorship Admission Office (Valilik Kabul Makamı), Gendarmery Building (Jandarma Binası) (used as a cafeteria), the Old Prison (Eski Cezaevi), Army Corps Building (Kolordu Binası), Courthouse A and Courthouse B Buildings (Adliye A ve B Binaları) and the Atatürk Museum (Atatürk Müzesi).\n\nİçkale Diyarbakır Archaeology Museum\n\nThe city’s first museum, the İçkale Diyarbakır Archaeology Museum (İçkale Diyarbakır Arkeoloji Müzesi) was opened in 1934 in the Zinciriye (Senceriye) Madrasa (Zinciriye Medresesi), near the Grand Mosque (Ulucami). The museum exhibits work dating from the foundations of modern civilization in Diyarbakır 12,400 years ago.\n\nIt is believed that a citadel was built for the first time in İçkale during the BCE 3rd millennium, in the Hurrian Period. The Amida Mound (Amida Höyüğü), also located here, is the first point of the city’s establishment and has been inhabited since the BCE 6th millennium.\n\nZerzevan Castle and Temple of Mithras\n\nZerzevan Castle (Zerzevan Kalesi) and the underground Temple of Mithras (Mithras Tapınağı) are in the Çınar District, 48 km from Diyarbakır. Set along the Diyarbakır-Mardin highway, the history of Zerzevan Castle – a Roman-era border garrison – dates from the Assyrian Period (BCE 882-611). The castle was used continuously until the conquest by the Islamic armies in 639 and features both above-ground structures and a large underground city. Within this most well-preserved military settlement in the world also lies the last Temple of Mithras ever found. The first temple on the eastern border of Rome, the structure was designed for the worship of Mithra, a sun god and a god of justice and war.\n\nSurrounded by 1,200 meters of 15-meter-high walls, the southern area of the garrison features structures such as a watchtower and defence tower, a church, an administration building, an arsenal and a rock altar. In the north are streets, villas, and residences, as well as cisterns, an underground church and an underground shelter, and the Temple of Mithras. Outside the walls are the channels that supplied water to the settlement, along with basins and quarries. There is also a necropolis with rock tombs and vaulted tombs. Zerzevan Castle and Temple of Mithras are on UNESCO’s Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Türkiye.\n\nEğil\n\nLocated 52 kilometres (about 40 minutes) away from Diyarbakır city centre, the town of Eğil consists of an area of 450 square kilometres built on a hill parallel to the Dicle (Tigris) River. Eğil, an ancient city, is a town that hosts a historic castle, many ancient caves, and an Assyrian cylinder seal providing strong evidence that the Assyrians were in the region.\n\nEğil is a significant faith tourism destination. It is widely believed that there are graves of 9 prophets, including the prophets Zülkifl and Elyesa, whose names appear in the Holy Qur’an. There are also many tombs of companions and saints across the region.\n\nEğil, which is also one of the most important cultural and tourism centres of Diyarbakır, has hosted a wide variety of civilisations, cultures and beliefs throughout history. Eğil district, which stands out as the common cultural heritage of the civilisations that existed in this geography, remained under the domination of civilisations such as Subarrus, Hurians, Mitannis, Assyrians, Urartians, Medes, and Persians. Eastern Roman (Byzantine) and Ottoman Empire are some of the civilisations that contributed to the unique texture of the city.\n\nEğil’s Ziyaret Hill and Tombs of the Prophets\n\nThere are graves of eight prophets in various parts of Eğil. The Dicle Dam built in the region caused some prophets' tombs to be flooded, but the graves of the prophets Elyesa and Zülkifl were transferred to Ziyaret Hill in 1995. From that date onwards, this place's name, known as Nebi Harun Hill, was changed to Ziyaret Hill. Ziyaret Hill is an important religious tourism centre located at a point overlooking the town and the Dicle Dam. Eğil is a very important place, especially in terms of faith tourism. It is believed that there are graves of 9 prophets, including the prophets Zülkifl and Elyesa, whose names appear in the Holy Qur’an. There are also many tombs of companions and saints in the region.\n\nEğil Castle\n\nEğil Castle, surrounded by deep valleys on three sides and built on a monolithic rock by carving the other side, is estimated to have been built during the time of the Assyrians, between 3500 and 1260 BCE. It was probably built only as an inner castle during the Assyrian period, and the outer castle was also added in later periods.\n\nIn the west-front part of Eğil Castle, there is a figure of an Assyrian King with a long cuneiform script. The castle is strengthened with city walls and bastions, and the outer wall starts next to the valley and continues along the southern slope.\n\nMosques in Eğil\n\nThere are a couple of significant mosques in Eğil, such as the Taciyan Grand Mosque. It was built in 1040 by Pir Bedir, one of the Eğil Beys after the Eğil Beylik was established. Another significant mosque is Eyyubiye Mosque. Based on its architectural features, it is estimated that the mosque, which is still open for worship, was built in the 18th century.\n\nChurches in Eğil\n\nEğil is of great importance not only for Islamic history but also for both Jewish and Christian history. It is known that before Islam, Assyrian culture had an intense influence on Diyarbakır and its surroundings, including Eğil. Christianity was dominant in the region at the height of the Assyrian reign.\n\nRock (Cave) Church is located inside the castle on the northwest side of Eğil Castle. It is estimated that the church was built in the 1st century CE. Cross motifs in many different forms were engraved on the walls, which have an important place in Christian iconography. For this reason, the church is almost a 'museum of the cross'.\n\nAnother important church in the region is the Şahveliyan Church. It is thought that the church, located in a valley opening to the Dicle (Tigris) River, was built in the 15th century. The walls and dome of the church are still standing.\n\nTombs and Monuments in Eğil\n\nThere are also several tombs and monuments of important figures of the region. Thought to belong to Assyrian kings and surviving to the present day, the king's tombs, located on the shores of the Dicle Dam Lake northeast of Eğil Castle, were carved into the main rock and shaped like a dome. There are line-shaped king figures in the royal tombs, whose interior structure is arranged in the form of rooms.\n\nThe town, which has rich resources in terms of faith tourism, also has monuments of some figures who played important roles for various reasons throughout history. The prominent ones are Kasım Bey Tomb, Nisanoğlu Tomb, Cafer Bey Tomb, and Lala Kasım (Caferiye) Madrasa.\n\nEğil Inns\n\nDuring the reign of Eğil Beys, a principality affiliated with the Ottomans, the Eğil town was located on important trade routes. Inns such as Şerbetin Inn and Konak Köyü Inn became important accommodation centres for caravans leaving Diyarbakır and continuing north via Dicle and Harput.\n\nEğil Cisterns\n\nEğil's water needs were met from water sources far away from the town through pipes made of pottery soil. The water was stored in the cistern, similar to a reduced plan of the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The water stored in the cistern flowed to the Kale Bath, Kale Mosque, and fountains built at various points.\n\nAmida Mound\n\nThe Amida Mound (Amida Höyük), is in İçkale, in the Diyarbakır city centre. It is the site of the first settlement in Diyarbakır and is both the administrative centre and the heart of Diyarbakır. Excavations of the site revealed that human settlement in the Amida Mound started around BCE 6100 (Late Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic Period). The Amida Mound is a rare example of a site that has hosted human civilization uninterruptedly from antiquity to the present day.\n\nThe Amida Mound holds the distinction of serving as the administrative centre of the Diyarbakır region since its establishment. As the heart of Diyarbakır, the Amida Mound is also important for housing the Artuklu Palace (Artuklu Sarayı), where the first robots in the world were built and functioned.\n\nOn Gözlü Bridge (Dicle Bridge)\n\nAlso known as the Dicle Bridge (Dicle Köprüsü) or the Silvan Bridge, the On Gözlü Bridge (On Gözlü Köprü) was constructed during the reign of Nizamüddin Nasr in the Marwanid period between 1065 and 1067, per its inscription. The ten-arched bridge was built entirely of hard volcanic basalt stone and rubble stone. It is 18 meters long and around six meters wide. Engraved into the basalt stone next to the inscription is a relief featuring a right-facing lion relief in a frame. Some small marks can be found on adjacent stones, which feature the camel bridge body of the lion figure. Over time, the bridge underwent destruction from enemy armies but was later repaired. Today, there is a restaurant serving the city’s distinguished flavours and local cuisine, as well as a cafe section where iwan nights are held – this area attracts both domestic and foreign tourists.\n\nMalabadi Bridge\n\nThe bridge is 22 km east of Silvan, over the Batman Creek. It was built by Temür-tash, son of Artuq Bey, during the Artukid period between 1147 and 1148. The bridge consists of three segments of different lengths, extending in an east-west direction in broken lines.\n\nConstructed with yellow limestone, the Malabadi Bridge (Malabadi Köprüsü) is the longest spanned stone arch bridge in the world with its pointed arch of 40.86 meters – larger even than the dome of Hagia Sophia. The bridge is about 281 meters long, about seven meters wide, and almost 25 meters high from the keystone to the low water level. The other two arches are about three meters wide. bridges with human, sun, and lion reliefs.\n\nOn either side of the bridge’s main arch are rooms where caravans and their passengers could stay, especially during difficult winter travel. There are various figures and decorations on the south part of the bridge. Malabadi Bridge is on UNESCO’s Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Türkiye.\n\nOther Historical Bridges\n\nThe Devegeçidi Bridge (Devegeçidi Köprüsü) was built during the Artukid period. There are wooded areas around the bridge, suitable for picnics. The Haburman Bridge (Haburman Köprüsü) was also built during the Artukid period.\n\nArtuklu Palace (Artuklu Sarayı)\n\nDiyarbakır Artuklu Palace (Artuklu Sarayı), located on the Amida Mound (Amida Höyük)), was rebuilt between 1200 and 1222 on the foundations of a destroyed Roman-era palace. Artuklu Palace, a centre of scientific studies during the Artukid Period, was later used by the states established in Amid (Diyarbakır). The palace, was abandoned in the 18th century, in the Ottoman period, and fell into disrepair due to neglect.\n\nEvliya Çelebi, who visited Amid in the 1650s, described the palace as having 150 rooms and many banquet halls; that each vizier built living quarters, a hammam and a pool, and that the palace became larger, as if decorated with layers. Çelebi also noted that the windows and balconies of the palace had beautiful views; all overlooked the Tigris River, the Tigris Desert and the Karatepe Valley.\n\nThe Artukid Arch entryway, in the central part of İçkale, is about 10 meters wide. A large inscription on the arch indicates that it was built in 1206, during the reign of Sultan Mahmut, the Sultan of Artukid, at the same time as the Artuklu Palace. The arched entrance symbolizes and emphasizes the power of the administration, rather than serving as a defensive structure.\n\nBastions\n\nThe Diyarbakır City Walls (Diyarbakır Şehir Surları), in the shape of a turret from a bird’s eye view, are crowned with 82 two-story bastions. These are mostly circular, although a few are polygonal and, in the sections facing Benusen and the Tigris Valley, are square. The lower levels of the bastions were used for storage, while the upper levels were used for fighting in times of war. Some of the castle’s important bastions are Evli Beden, Yedi Kardeş, Nur, Selçuklu, Fındık, Leblebikıran and Akrep. The Keçi Bastion (Keçi Burcu) offers magnificent views of Kırklar Mountain (Kırklar Dağı), the On Gözlü Bridge and Hevsel Gardens (Hevsel Bahçeleri).\n\nThere are four main gates for both the Inner Castle and the Outer Castle in Diyarbakır Walls. These gates are called Dağ (Mountain), Mardin, Yeni (New) and Urfa. The four gates were erected to protect the city from all kinds of dangers, as well as to ensure its connection with the outside world: the gates provided an effective means of controlling access to Diyarbakır, one of Northern Mesopotamia’s most prominent trade centres and a city of great military significance.\n\nDiyarbakır Grand Mosque\n\nThe Grand Mosque (Ulucami), one of the oldest mosques in Anatolia, is the largest and most famous of the city’s historical mosques. Allegedly the structure – a church before the conquest of Diyarbakır by the Companions in 639, a synagogue before that, and a temple to a sun god even earlier – was built during the time of Moses.\n\nThe Grand Mosque contains the masjid belonging to the Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki and Hanbali sects; its walls bear 38 inscriptions. In the courtyard is the sundial built by Al-Jazari. There is also a Roman era underground cistern, the Mesudiye and the Zinciriye Madrasa (Mesudiye ve Zinciriye Medresesi). This large complex in Diyarbakır, a city of science and culture, is a witness to the city’s history.\n\nThe Prophet Süleyman Mosque and Tomb of the Companions\n\nThe mosque is known by two different names: The Prophet Süleyman Mosque (Hazreti Süleyman Cami) and the Kale Mosque (Kale Cami). It is a pilgrimage site for both locals and foreigners, as it houses the Tombs of the Prophet Süleyman and his Companions. The most important feature of the mosque, which is in İçkale, is that the conquest of Diyarbakır started from here, during the time of Prophet Ömer and the Mashhads. The Companions who were martyred during the conquest of Diyarbakır by Islamic armies, are entombed here. The mosque is a collection of buildings comprising the Tomb of the Companions (Sahabeler Türbesi), the prayer room (namazgâh), the square minaret and a series of fountains. The black basalt stone used in the construction give the mosque an imposing appearance.\n\nNebi (Prophet) Mosque\n\nThe Nebi Mosque (Nebi Cami), popularly known as the Prophet Mosque (Peygamber Cami), dates from the Akkoyunlu Period and is a century-old square-planned, single-domed mosque. It is a beautiful structure, with a created by the hadiths in its square-bodied minaret and alternating white and black stones.\n\nİskender Paşa Mosque\n\nThe İskender Paşa Mosque (İskender Paşa Cami) was built by the 12th Ottoman governor of Diyarbakir, İskender Paşa, between 1551-1554. It is one of the most beautiful of Mimar Sinan’s works, attracting local and foreign researchers due to its inverted T-plan design. To the east of the mosque is the tomb of the family of İskender Paşa. Featuring a central dome and two semi-domes, it is the only tomb of its type in Diyarbakır and well worth seeing.\n\nMelik Ahmet Paşa Mosque\n\nThe mosque was built between 1587-1591 by Diyarbakır Governor Melik Ahmet Paşa, on the street named after him. The name of the mosque appears in the Tuhfetü’l Mi’marin, a compilation of Mimar Sinan’s works. The main entrance of the mosque is particularly striking, featuring ornate stonework.\n\nSheikh Mutahhar (Sheikh Matar) Mosque Dört Ayaklı (Four Legged) Minaret\n\nBuilt by Sultan Kasım in 1500, during the Akkoyunlu Period, the mosque was famous for its minaret. Called the “Four-Legged Minaret”, the square-shaped minaret stands on four massive columns – the only one of this type in Anatolia and therefore a centre of attention for both foreign and local tourists. The four columns symbolize four Islamic sects. Allegedly, anyone who passes under the columns seven times will have their wish granted.\n\nSilvan Grand Mosque (Selahaddin Eyyubi Mosque)\n\nSet in the district center of Silvan, this ornate, monumental mosque was erected in 1157, during the reign of Artukoğlu Necmeddin Alpi. Some additions were made to the mosque, which was repaired in 1227 during the Ayyubid period and renamed the Saladin Ayyubi (Selahaddin Eyyubi) Mosque (Selahaddin Eyyubi Cami). There is an inscription of Necmeddin Alpi (1152-1176) on the mosque’s dome, while inscriptions from the Abbasids are also found in various parts of the mosque.\n\nParlı Safa Mosque and Minaret\n\nThe 15th-century Parlı Safa Mosque (Parlı Safa Cami) is known for its richly decorated minaret, which features kufi and naskh scripts and delicate patterns, almost like lace, carved from the pedestal up to the cone. The mosque is called “parlı” fragrant due to its scent. The fragrance comes from a plant mixed into the materials used in the construction of the mosque and minaret. In earlier eras, scent was also applied to the minaret in preparation for Friday prayers. The minaret was then covered with a cloth, which was removed on Fridays.\n\nMosques\n\nThe Fatih Paşa, Nasuh Paşa, Prophet Omer, Husrev Paşa, Behram Paşa and Ali Paşa mosques in Diyarbakır are also historical mosques with an important place in art and architectural history.\n\nMar Petyun Chaldean Church\n\nLocated near the Sheikh Muhattar Mosque (Şeyh Mutahhar Cami), this Chaldean Catholic Church (Keldani Katolik Kilisesi) is still in service. The church is part of a complex that includes lodging and three courtyards. Its restoration is ongoing.\n\nSurp Giragos Armenian Church\n\nIn the Özdemir neighbourhood, this Orthodox Armenian Church is the largest in the Middle East and among the most important works in Armenian architectural history. The church has an imposing appearance and extends in an east-west direction. It will be opened to visitors after its restoration is completed.\n\nMadrasas\n\nThe Latifiye Madrasa (Latifiye Medresesi), northeast of the Fatih Paşa Mosque (Fatih Paşa Cami), and the Ali Paşa Madrasa (Ali Paşa Medresesi) were used as “houses of the poor” for a period. They are among the historical madrasas in Diyarbakır that are open to visitors.\n\nCahit Sıtkı Tarancı House\n\nCahit Sıtkı Tarancı, one of Diyarbakır’s famous poets, was born in this house in the Cami-i Kebir neighbourhood in 1910. Many of his numerous works, now part of our literary history, were written in this house, such as the poem “Age 35”. The house, where the artist was born and spent his youth, is a splendid example of Diyarbakır’s residential architecture. It has a courtyard with a fountain and a garden, including rosebushes, that feels otherworldly. The house has served as a museum since 1973, exhibiting the poet’s letters and books, as well as some personal items and ethnographic artifacts.\n\nAhmet Arif Museum Library\n\nThe renowned poet Ahmet Arif, who was born in Diyarbakır in 1927, ranks among our literary notables with his poem “Hasretinden Prangalar Eskittim”. Arif’s books have seen the greatest number of publications in Türkiye and he is considered to be among those who write most lyrically in the Turkish language. In the Ahmet Arif Literature Museum Library (Ahmet Arif Edebiyat Müze Kütüphanesi), one of the most distinguished examples of Diyarbakır residential architecture, the poet’s personal belongings, handwritten poems and photographs are exhibited. In addition, there is a library.\n\nZiya Gökalp House\n\nZiya Gökalp was born in 1876 in his family home and he died in İstanbul in 1924. The house where the writer was born and spent his childhood years was opened as a museum in 1956.\n\nThe two-story house, now a museum, is a fine example of civil architecture in Diyarbakır. Built in 1806, it was constructed with basalt stone and consists of three wings and a central courtyard. The museum features exhibit of Gökalp’s personal items, and collections of his documents, photographs, books and letters. As well, ethnographic works of the region are exhibited.\n\nCemil Paşa Mansion\n\nThe mansion, one of the most beautiful examples of civil architecture in Diyarbakır, was built by Diyarbakır Governor Cemil Paşa in 1888. Covering an expansive area, the mansion consists of a haremlik (women’s section) and a selamlık (men’s section). The restored mansion now serves as the City Museum.\n\nHasan Paşa Inn\n\nThe inn’s construction was started between 1572 and 1575 by Vezirzade Hasan Paşa, son of the Sokullu Diyarbakir Governor of that period. However, Governor Hasan Paşa was appointed to another duty during this period, so the completion of the inn took place under Governor Osman Paşa. Simeon of Poland, who visited Diyarbakır in 1612 and toured the city, mentioned that “there are two large stables under the ground that can accommodate 500 horses and a large number of rooms”. Evliya Çelebi, who came to the city in the 17th century, noted that the Hasan Paşa Khan was “like a castle, a very firm and a solid structure”. Located in the city’s commercial center, the inn is the second largest caravanserai in Diyarbakır after the Deliller Inn (Deliller Hanı).\n\nSülüklü Inn\n\nThis inn was built in 1683 by Hanilioğlu Mahmut Çelebi and his sister, Atike Hatun. It is known that the leeches in the inn’s well were used by physicians of the period for healing purposes, thus the inn was named ‘sülüklü’ (with leeches). The inn’s upper floors were used as resting rooms and the lower as storage and accommodation for animals; the inn also served as the headquarters of the cavalry troops during the War of Independence. It now houses a public tourist attraction and a cafe.\n\nDeliller Inn, Hüsrev Paşa Inn (Caravanserai Hotel)\n\nSet near the Mardin Gate in the city wall, Deliller Inn (Deliller Hanı) is also known as Hüsrev Paşa Inn (Hüsrev Paşa Hanı). It was built in (1527-1528) by Deli Hüsrev Paşa, the second Ottoman governor of Diyarbakır. The building was called ‘deliller’ as it was where pilgrims and their guides met and stayed during pilgrimage periods. The wide area opposite the inn was called Pilgrim’s (Hacılar) Ruin.\n\nHistorical Buildings\n\nThe Great Courthouse (Büyük Adliye Sarayı), Corps Command Building (Kolordu Komutanlık Binası), Armory Building (Cephanelik Binası), İskender Paşa Mansion (İskender Paşa Konağı), Ağuludere Mansion (Ağuludere Konağı) and Kuşdili Mansion (Kuşdili Konağı) in Diyarbakır are also notable structures in the city.\n\nTomb of Sarı Saltuk\n\nOpposite the Urfa Gate, the tomb’s building date is unknown. It is believed that its occupant is Sheikh Sadık Ali, also known as Sarı Saltuk, a member of the Gülşeniyye Sect. The tomb has an important place in folk beliefs.\n\nTomb of the Prophet Enosh\n\nThe Prophet Enosh was said to possess a deep knowledge of astronomy. According to an epigraph inside the tomb, introducing his genealogy, the Prophet Enosh was the third grandson of the Prophet Adam, the son of the Prophet Seth and the grandfather of the Prophet Noah. The tomb is in Otluca village, approximately 12 km from Ergani and is visited by numerous people.\n\nAşefçiler Bazaar\n\nFounded in the 1940s, Aşefçiler Bazaar (Aşefçiler Çarşısı) is in the square between Buğday Bazaar and Bakırcılar Bazaar, where the old Saman Bazaar is located, and set between the Balıkçılarbaşı and Deva (Camel) hammams. The market, set up in the early hours of the morning, sells various vegetables and fruits grown in the vineyards and gardens of the Tigris Valley.\n\nÇayönü\n\nÇayönü Hill (Çayönü Tepesi), near Ergani, is one of the best examples of Neolithic agricultural village communities in Anatolia. Considered a “key settlement”, the site sheds light not only on the history of the region, but on the history of civilization. With finds dating from the BCE 10th millennium, Çayönü is an important archaeological site that documents the process of the transition of humankind from hunter/gatherer to a settled order based on grain/wheat cultivation and animal domestication, and thus constitutes an important step in today’s civilization. Research conducted in Çayönü in the 19th century indicated that settlement in the region began between BCE 7250-6750; excavations revealed circular houses and simple huts from the Neolithic Age. One of the notable structures discovered in the Çayönü excavations was a monumental building known as the “Saltaşlı Building”. It is about 10 meters wide and made of large limestone blocks whose surfaces have been smoothed and polished.\n\nAshab-ı Kehf and the Dakyanus Ruins\n\nThe world has many sacred caves that draw religious tourism. That there are Ashab-ı Kehf sites in 33 locations worldwide and four in Türkiye demonstrates its importance in both Islam and Christianity. In the story of the Ashab-i Kehf, in the Quran, the cave’s location is not clearly stated – only its features are described. According to some academics, the Ashab-ı Kehf cave in the Diyarbakır Lice district is one hundred percent compatible with the characteristics of the cave as noted in the Quran; and the information in the inscription on the cave’s wall also suggests that it is the genuine Ashab-ı Kehf cave.\n\nBırkleyn Caves\n\nThese caves are unique in in Türkiye and the region for both their history and their natural beauty. The Assyrian kings Tiglat-pileser I and Salman Nassar III documented their sovereignty by commissioning reliefs and cuneiform inscriptions here due to the structure of the geographical region. Allegedly, the armies of Alexander the Great stayed here during his eastern expeditions.\n\nCaves\n\nThese artificial caves made of rocks are in the Deran region in Diyarbakır, along with carved rock church where John of Eğil was trained and the Hilar and Hasuni Caves (Hilar ve Hasuni Mağaraları). In addition, the Sinek Creek Rock Caves Reliefs (Sinek Çayı Kaya Mağaraları Kabartmaları), about 7 km northwest of Çermik, are accessible via a challenging but pleasant walk.\n\nSilvan Atatürk House\n\nSet in the center of the Silvan district, the house is outside the walls, by the river. The building belongs to a Mr. Hatip, and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who was appointed to Silvan as the corps commander in 1916, resided in the mansion for six months, also using it as a headquarters. During his time here, Atatürk stopped the advance of the Russians into Diyarbakır and saved Bitlis and Muş from enemy occupation. During this conflict, 13,000 people were captured and 6,500 of our people were martyred. The Russians suffered great losses and were forced to retreat. Due to these achievements, Atatürk was awarded the Golden Sword Concession Medal. The mansion serves as a museum today.\n\nÇermik Hot Springs\n\nAbout 3 km from the Çermik district, the hot springs, also known as Melike Belkıs, have been in use since the Middle Ages and are open throughout the year. Çermik Hot Springs (Çermik Kaplıcaları) are the second worldwide in terms of quality, after the hot springs in Italy. There are two historical baths – Büyük Paşa and Küçük Paşa – in the district, along with numerous hotels and pensions around the hot springs. The Çermik Hot Springs are considered a healing source due to their rich elements; it is believed that the waters can be helpful in treating inflammatory rheumatisms, neuritis, polyneuritis, polio, chronic syndromes of gynaecological diseases, and upper respiratory tract infections. In the hot spring area, there is a Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Unit, part of Dicle University, with physical therapists and physiotherapists. In addition to the Municipal Operation Facilities, there is a thermal hotel with a Tourism Operation certificate."
