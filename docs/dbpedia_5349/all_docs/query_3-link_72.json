        "text": "Introduction\n\nOrthodontic elastics (OE)/rubber bands were first discussed by Calvin S. Case in 1893 at the Columbia Dental Congress and have been routinely used as an active component of fixed orthodontic therapy ever since. Orthodontic elastics are one of the most versatile materials available to the orthodontist. Correct use of OEs combined with cooperative patients allows orthodontists to improve both anteroposterior and vertical discrepancies.1 While technology has developed significantly and clear aligner treatments are gradually becoming more widespread in orthodontic practice, currently, it is difficult to imagine orthodontic treatment without OEs.\n\nOrthodontic elastics can be applied in various ways regarding the direction of force applied to the teeth to be moved. Therefore, patients must cooperate to ensure regular and correct usage, which directly affects the success of the treatment. Clinicians may choose to apply a number of methods, such as patient education, verbal praise, positive and negative reinforcement, use of charts and rewards in order to ensure patient compliance in the use of OEs.2 In addition, it seems obvious that recommending reliable videos previously identified by the clinician would facilitate the patient’s perception of treatment due to their visual content.3 Therefore, video-sharing platforms such as YouTube™ are becoming more prominent as they provide health-related information which can be easily accessed by the public. On average, 100 h of video are uploaded to YouTube™ every minute, and each user spends at least 15 min per day watching videos on this platform worldwide.4 A key consideration of YouTube™ is that it is a source of user-generated content, and due to the uncontrolled nature of the platform, many videos can unfortunately misinform the viewer.5 Such misinformation may affect patients’ communication with their dentists and disrupt the cooperation with the treatment.\n\nIt is apparent that using social media to access health-related information will probably become even more significant in the future; thus, studies regarding the quality of video content and other shared visual information have become more crucial.6 As the volume of information patients find on the internet to make decisions about their health gradually increases, it becomes more critical for healthcare professionals to examine the information patients have been accessing. It is for this reason that several studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of dentistry-related information (clear aligners, rapid palatal expansion, orthognathic surgery, accelerated orthodontics, impacted canines, root canal treatment, dental implants, early childhood caries, fluoride therapy, obstructive sleep apnea, genioplasty) on YouTube™.3,6-16 The majority of these studies evaluating the content in YouTube™ videos demonstrated that this tool is not an adequate source from which patients might obtain reliable information.6-11 In terms of OEs, this issue may lead to incorrect use and, therefore, may adversely affect the success of the treatment.\n\nTo our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the quality of OE-related information on YouTube™ to date. Considering the significant role of OEs in orthodontic practice, the aim of this study was to evaluate videos dealing with OEs on YouTube™ in terms of characteristics, content, and quality of the information.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 120 videos were reviewed for the keyword “orthodontic elastics,” of which 39 videos were excluded due to the following reasons: 4 videos were not in English, 6 videos were longer than 15 min, 21 videos did not have audio, and 8 videos included duplicate content. The videos were uploaded between September 2010 and October 2020.\n\nAll video demographics, including the mean number of views, likes, dislikes of the videos, and days since upload are presented in . The mean number of views for all the videos was 498 848.05, with a variation between videos ranging from 187 to 7 441 177 views. The overall mean of number of “likes” was 3071.91 (ranging from 0 to 77 000), while the overall mean of number of “dislikes” was 183.26 (ranging from 0 to 2500). The mean number of comments was 366.79 (ranging from 0 to 5775), and the mean video length was 3:84 min (ranging from 0:25 to 13:45). Finally, the mean value of the days since upload was 1091.01 days (ranging from 60 to 3557 days). Other video characteristics including video source, target audience, and video purpose are summarized in .\n\nTable 2.\n\nVideo CharacteristicsMinimumMaximumMeanSDViews1877,441.177498,848.051,430,273.9Likes077.0003.071.91223.00Dislikes02.500183.2615.00Comments05.775366.791,049.713Length0:2513:453:842.85Days since upload603.5571,091.01945.067CS0102.25931.99861GQS152.6049.73619\n\nTable 3.\n\nVideo DemographicsPoor Content (n = 70)\n\n(86.4%)Moderate Content (n = 7)\n\n(8.6%)Rich Content (n = 4)\n\n(4.9%)Total Source of videoDentist/orthodontist26 (89.7%)3 (10.3%)0 (0)29Commercial5 (100%)0 (0)0 (0)5Health institution23 (92%)1 (4%)1 (4%)25Layperson16 (72.7%)3 (13.6%)3 (13.6%)22 Purpose of videoPatient information46 (92%)4 (8%)0 (0)50Patient experience16 (72.7%)3 (13.6%)3 (13.6%)22Product introduction4 (80%)0 (0)1 (20%)5Education4 (100%)0 (0)0 (0)4 Target of videoLayperson60 (84.5%)7 (9.9%)4 (100%)71Professional4 (100%)0 (0)0 (0)4Both6 (100%)0 (0)0 (0)6\n\nIn total, 85% of the videos presented clear instructions of the use of OE, 31% a correct definition of OE, 24% removability of OE, and 17% pain caused by OE. Only 15% of the videos mentioned the effect of OE on speech and 7.4% the psychological effect of OE ( ), and 36% of all videos were uploaded by a dentist/orthodontist, 31% by a health institution, and 27% by a layperson. While the purpose of 95% of the videos was to inform laypersons, only 10% of the videos were intended for professionals. The purpose of 62% of the videos was to share patient information, 27% to share patient experience, 6% to provide a product introduction, and 4% to educate. The majority of GQS scores were classified as “moderate” (40%), followed by “generally poor” at 33%. The number of likes were significantly higher in videos targeting laypersons than those targeting professionals (P < .05). The number of comments were also higher in videos uploaded by laypersons than those uploaded by dental professionals (P < .05). Videos uploaded by laypersons had significantly longer video duration than those uploaded by dentists (P < .05). Videos with a purpose of patient experience had significantly longer video duration than those with other purposes (P < .05). The number of views were significantly higher in videos targeting both laypersons and professionals than those targeting only one of these groups (P < .05), ( ).\n\nTable 4.\n\nViews P Likes P Dislikes P Comments P Days Since Upload P Duration P SourceDentist/orthodontist176,523.45.2671395.72.06148.28.051225.86a.0241021.66.800232.93b.000Layperson696,615.326240.82332.86599.68a981.14385.36bCommercial1,558,009.402812.20488.401034.401639.4072.80Health instution486,877.122279.60147.16191.801158. .48128.48 PurposePatient information295,837.74.0851941.12.20993.60.081214.82.0701032.40.698161.78c.000Patient experience806,725.415581.73316.64620,321014.09397.95c,d,eProduct introduction469,783.401664.60123.80141.001667.40255.80dEducation1,379,482.255162.00644.751154.251526.25171.50e TargetLayperson429,600.20f.0142794.61h.037165.39.081378.04.083967.65.069226.06.490Professional101,441.75g512.00h30.5058.501359.50257.50Both1,583,218.50f , g8060.00496.50439.172371.83288.17\n\nThe Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 0.76, indicating an admissible degree of similarity between the scores. The mean content score and GQS scores of the videos were 2.25 ± 1.99 (poor) and 2.60 ± 0.73 (moderate), respectively ( ). There was a positive correlation between the total CS score and GQS score (r = 0.258). The majority of the videos (86.4%) were classified as having “poor content,” 9% as having “moderate content,” and 5% as having “rich content” in terms of the CS score. There were no statistical differences in terms of demographic data between the 3 content groups. A total of 84.5% of the videos targeting laypersons were in the poor content group. Most of the videos informing patients were uploaded by dentists/orthodontists (46%) and health institutions (48%). A total of 30% of videos targeting laypersons were uploaded by dentists/orthodontists, 34% by health institutions, and 31% by laypersons.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMillions of people use the internet as the shortest way to access information on a global level today. Since orthodontics is a field where numerous visual and complex instructions are given to the patient, it seems that patients are likely to search for more information on the internet. Patients are mostly curious about the timings of the use of OE and the effect of OE in terms of pain, eating, speech, and so on.19 For these reasons, they mostly use YouTube™ as a social platform that provides rich visual content and easy access instead of scientific platforms where it can be harder to access information. Although this website is the second most visited video-sharing platform today, much of the information can be misleading as it is not peer reviewed. Two independent reviewers evaluated all the videos. The researchers agreed on a new score by consensus in cases where there was an inconsistency in scores. We created a content scale considering the major concerns of patients regarding OE. As expected, most of the videos included instructions on the usage of OE. In a study, the authors reported that patients were mostly concerned about the effect of OE in terms of pain that might be experienced and social status.8 However, in the current study, only 17% of videos included content related to the pain associated with OEs and only a few videos were found that covered the psychological effects. Moreover, the effects of OE on speech, oral hygiene, and soft tissue soreness were under-represented topics in the videos. In terms of those questions most asked by patients such as alternatives (comparison content) of OEs, their effect on treatment duration, and the material from which they are made, YouTube™ seems a poor source of information. Even though 74% of videos were uploaded by dental professionals and 65% of videos targeting laypersons were also uploaded by these professionals, most of the content of these videos was classified as being “poor” quality, indicating the deficiencies in these videos.\n\nAlthough the content scores and GQS scores presented a positive correlation, the GQS scores were higher. This can be explained by the fact that the videos flow well despite their poor content. Similarly, Lena et al.19 and Ustdal et al.16 stated a moderate correlation between GQS and CS in their YouTube™ studies evaluating lingual orthodontics and accelerated orthodontics, respectively. Surprisingly, all “rich” content videos had been uploaded by laypersons. This may be because people like to share their experiences in detail on their personal blogs, especially including content on removability, pain, psychological effects, speech performance, and oral hygiene. Nevertheless, there was 1 video shared by an adolescent who believes it is possible to close his maxillary median diastema with OEs at home on his own, without referring to the risks involved in attempting this action. This means that videos uploaded by laypersons are always at risk of including misleading information. Therefore, the content of the videos uploaded by dental professionals should be improved to better inform those patients who want to find out more about OEs.\n\nThe video content was found poor in several previous dentistry-related YouTube™ studies.6-16 However, Yavuz et al.3 reported good content in videos concerning accelerated orthodontics and they attributed this to the fact that the majority of the videos they analyzed were uploaded by professionals. In contrast, previous YouTube™ studies demonstrated that the majority of analyzed videos were uploaded by laypersons rather than dentists or academicians.6,9,16 The majority of videos targeting laypersons were in poor content group. These videos, most of which were shared by dental professionals in our study, once again showed how important it is to examine the available information to patients on YouTube™. In addition, the quality of the videos evaluated in this study was found to be moderate, as in similar studies. 3,16,21\n\nViewers can interact with uploaders by commenting or liking/disliking their videos.11 Considering that the videos uploaded by laypersons had a significantly higher number of comments than the videos uploaded by professionals, it is disappointing that users preferred to interact with laypersons than professionals in order to obtain information regarding OEs. In addition, the duration of videos uploaded by professionals was found significantly shorter than videos uploaded by laypersons. The quality of videos on YouTube™ should be improved by professionals via extending the duration and detailing the accurate content. As expected, the videos targeting both laypersons and professionals were viewed more than videos targeting only one of these groups.\n\nThe current research has several limitations. First, as YouTube™ is a dynamic site, the results might vary due to the monitoring date of the videos. However, since “orthodontic elastics” is not a constantly changing and developing subject, this limitation may not have critically affected the study results. Second, laypersons may try searching for different keywords to find information concerning OEs. To limit the impact of this issue, the most searched term in Google Trends application was used for this research. Third, only videos in English were analyzed. Fortunately, the majority of videos were already in the English language (n = 116). In the current study, videos longer than 15 min were excluded. It has been reported that the audience will lose interest with the prolongation of video duration on YouTube™.20 Previous studies also demonstrated that short videos were viewed more on internet.9,22 However, only 6 videos were excluded in this study due to this reason.\n\nIn this study, the content of YouTube™ videos regarding OEs for patients was found to be of moderate and poor quality. Clinicians should create their own YouTube™ accounts and refer their patients to these videos in order to avoid the spread of misinformation and achieve more successful treatment results. Dental professionals should also warn their patients about any online platforms where they may encounter misleading and inaccurate information."
