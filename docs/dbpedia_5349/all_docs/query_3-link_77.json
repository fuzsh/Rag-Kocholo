        "text": "Diyarbakır history\n\nThe history of this city, located in the transition region of Mesopotamian and Anatolian civilizations, dates back to ancient times. From the caves that existed in and around Diyarbakır during the Stone and Mesolithic periods, it can be clearly understood that settlement began in even earlier times. Remains from this age were found in the Hilar caves near Ergani on the Hassan Tigris River and its tributaries near Eğil – Silvan. The oldest village in the world was found in the excavations of Çayönü Hill, located 65 kilometers northwest of the city, near the town of Ergani. Over time, people in Çayönü moved from nomadism to settled village life, from hunting and gathering to food production. In 3000 BC, the city center was dominated by Hittite and Hurrian - Mittani cultures. After the Hurri-Mitanis, who ruled until 1260 BC, Assyrians, Arameans, Urartians, İstiks, Medes, Persians, Macedonians, Seleucids, Parthians, Armenians, Romans, Sassanids, Umayyads, Abbasids, Hmadanis, Marvanis, Seljuks, Artukids, Ayyubids, Mongols, Akkoyunlus, Safavids, and Ottomans dominated Diyarbakır. This abundance of various cultures is a true testament to Diyarbakır's rich and miscellaneous texture.\n\nDiyarbakır cuisine\n\nWith its 5000-year history, Diyarbakır cuisine has a much deeper structure than the first watermelon that comes to mind. Diyarbakır, located at the intersection of Mesopotamia and Anatolia, has reflected this richness in its cuisine and dishes. The geographical inclination of the region to agriculture and animal husbandry has contributed to the introduction of agriculture, meat and dairy products into Diyarbakır cuisine. Dishes that we strongly recommend you taste when you go to Diyarbakır include meftune, dolma, kibe mumbar, stuffed meatballs, liver kebab, kibe kudur, bismil pan, and leben. After the meal, we recommend you crown this feast of taste with Diyarbakır Burmese kadayıf. The top most visited Diyarbakır restaurants include Onur Ocakbaşı, Sülüklü Inn, Kadayıfçı Sıtkı Usta, Aslan Restaurant, Selim Usta's Dining Hall, Umut Ciğercisi, Şanlıurfa Kebab House, and Tabier Lahmacun.\n\nDiyarbakır geography\n\nHaving witnessed the most important moments of history and managed to keep different cultures together, Diyarbakır fascinates visitors with its beautiful and valuable structures. The city's name origin comes from Diyar-ı Bekir, which means \"Land of Bekir,\" in honor of the Bekir Tribe of Arabian origin, who settled around the Tigris river. The city has hosted many civilizations with its 9000-year history from the Paleolithic Age to the Polished Stone Age. It bears the traces of the 33 tribes mentioned above, established on the skirts of the volcanic Karadağ mountain. Surrounded by Batman and Muş in the east, Malatya, Adıyaman, and Şanlıurfa in the west, and Elazığ in the north, Diyarbakır is confined with an eastern and oriental atmosphere. The city steals the hearts of its guests with magical stories told in its 17 districts. Each district is the last remaining symbol of the old Mesopotamian castle cities with monumental walls surrounding them."
