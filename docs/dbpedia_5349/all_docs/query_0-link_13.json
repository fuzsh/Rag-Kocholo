YELLOWHAMMER PT.1\n7. YELLOWHAMMER PT.2\n8. DIFFRACTION\n9. TRANSLINEAR PRINCIPLE\n10. KINGDOM OF BELLS\n\nEgil Kalman is a Swedish musician/composer primarily playing modular synthesizer and double bass. ”Kingdom of Bells Egil Kalman plays the Synthi 100” is his debut record as a solo artist.\r\n\r\nThe record was made during a residency at the Contemporary Music Research Center (KSYME) in Athens in 2019. All the tracks were captured straight from the Synthi 100 as stereo recordings and contain no overdubs. The music showcases both the powerful and raw sound of this rare instrument as well as Kalman’s expansive interests as a musician and composer. \r\n\r\nMind altering just tuned drones with melodies that echoes traditional Scandinavian folk music flow into abstract soundscapes reminiscent of early electronic music pioneers, but still holds a fresh sound and vibe. Deep synth music from the North!\r\n\r\nEgil Kalman’s playing as a syntheist and double bass player can previously be heard in duos with Zoi Efstathiou and Fredrik Rasten as well as in groups such as Miman, Marthe Lea Band and Alasdair Roberts &amp; Völvur.  \r\n\r\nHis music aims to dissolve the brittle barriers separating traditional Scandinavian folk- and contemporary electroacoustic music via minimalist compositional techniques and soulful improvisations. Utilizing just intonation tunings, hypnotic forms, synthesized sound mimicking the acoustic and vice versa, his music explores qualities intrinsic to traditional Scandinavian folk music in ways where the musical foundation is felt rather than explicitly heard. Kalman can previously be heard in duos with Zoi Efstathiou and Fredrik Rasten as well as in groups such as Miman, Marthe Lea Band and Alasdair Roberts &amp; Völvur.  \r\n\r\nThe record was mastered by Rashad Becker and the artwork is made by Allon Kaye.",
