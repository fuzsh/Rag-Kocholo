        "text": "I want to take the time today to appreciate MY mother and all the mothers in my Ecua-life that have made being so far from mi mami not as unbearable!\n\nAs my mom hates photos I decided to respect her wishes and instead post a picture of one of the greatest gifts she has given me! These goofballs! Mom you love and respect each of us at our best and our worst...thank to you we are not a (complete) embarrassment to society! To this day, actually this very morning, you give me constant advice and support. You are still the person I call when I'm happy, sad, sick, stressed, etc. etc. etc! Thanks for being my everything :)\n\nWords could never do this woman justice. Lupita has accepted me 100% for who I am, the good, the bad, and the ugly! We joke, we laugh, we drink coffee, we dance at concerts. Lupita has been my best friend, my advice giver, my cultural guide, my ecua-mom, and my sanity!\n\nPia opened her home and her heart to me and I am so grateful. From constant phone calls to check in that remind me that I'm not alone and someone is thinking about me to weekends in the countryside to almuerzos and cafecitos to quality conversation this wonderful woman has been there to support and care for me and I cannot imagine my service and my life without her!\n\nMi hermana mayor y mi vidita! This two women have been family to me. Ceci and Diana always make sure I'm taken care of from having food to eat at school to a dress to wear to parties!\n\nCris, my Tumbacan host mom. She accepted me into her family and treats me like her own daughter! We travel when family visits and I stop by whenever I can...I'm so blessed to be part of her CRAZY family. They are almost as nuts as my family and I do feel at home with them! Mamita te agradezco por todo lo que has hecho por mi....por cuidarme por quererme por brindarme su carino y por aceptarme en tu familia.\n\nLessons my moms have taught me:\n\nChoose your attitude. You can't control what happens in your life but you can control how you react to it and what you choose to do about it. Sue Fischer\n\nBe generous and love without expecting anything in return because that's where you will meet the greatest people and find the greatest reward. Cris Carrera\n\nBe crazy! Take risks! Life is too short to be walking on the safe side. Diana Borja\n\nBe patient and kind. Always speak with a calm mind and an open heart. Lupita Chavez\n\nBe true to yourself and don't sacrifice who you are for anyone else. Pia Baldeon\n\nThe most valuable thing you can give others is your time.
