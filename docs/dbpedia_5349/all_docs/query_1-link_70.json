        "text": "This paper critically analyzes the Sharafnama, a history of the Kurds, written by the late sixteenth century ruler of Bitlis, Şeref Xan. Given the politically sensitive nature of the Middle East's “Kurdish Question,” the Sharafnama has become an extremely important resource through which Kurdish nationalists have sought to construct a coherent “national narrative.” This is due to the fact that Şeref Xan's book constitutes one of the few systematic histories of the Kurds written before the twentieth century. This paper moves away from nationalist inspired interpretations of the Sharafnama, which see the work as a “national(ist)” history. Instead, it posits that, although the piece can be regarded as a manifestation of Kurdish “ethno-politics,” it is necessary to look at it within the context of the relationship between the Kurdish tribal princes who ruled large areas of “Kurdistan,” on one hand, and the Ottoman and Safavid empires who competed for control of this region, on the other. In particular, it brings to the fore an often forgotten and/or ignored aspect of Şeref Xan's history, namely its pro-Ottoman bias. In this way, the article makes broader points relating to the nature of the Kurdish identity in the early modern period, and the influence of such conceptions on the later construction of the modern Kurdish identity.\n\n1 Transcription and transliteration of words and names is a tricky business, especially in the field of Kurdish studies, in which the utilization of sources in a number of different Arabic-script based languages is necessary. I have opted, therefore, to use the Latinized Kurdish Alphabet for the names of Kurds. Thus, instead of the Persian “Sharaf Khan” or the Turkish “Şerefhan,” I have opted for the Kurdish “Şeref Xan.” However, as Şeref Xan's history was written in Persian, I have transliterated it according to the scheme forwarded by Iranian Studies as “Sharafnama.” Other Persian names and terms have been dealt with in a similar fashion. Similarly, (Ottoman) Turkish names and terms follow their modern Turkish spelling. Needless to say, there are issues with my somewhat idiosyncratic decision as it might be seen as “imposing” a “nationality” on individuals who may not have seen themselves in such a light. This is not my intension. In the preparation of this paper, citations are from the Mehmet Emin Bozarslan Turkish translation of the Sharafnama, first published in 1971. Şerefhan Bitlisi, Şerefname Kürd Tarihi (Birinci Bölümü), trans. M. Emin Bozarslan (Istanbul: Deng, 2006). However, I have also consulted M.R. Izady's 2005 partial English–Persian edition, Prince Sharaf al-Din Bitlisi, The Sharafnama or the History of the Kurdish Nation, trans. M.R. Izady (Costa Mesa: Mazda, 2005), as well as François Bernard-Charmoy's three-volume French–Persian edition, Chèrefou'ddîne, Chèref-nameh, ou, Fastes de la nation kourde, trans. François Bernard-Charmoy (St.-Petersburg: Commissionnaires de l'Académie Impériale des sciences, 1870). I would specifically like to thank Monsieur Boris James of Paris for bring to my attention some extremely important Arabic sources and for his valuable feedback on this paper.\n\n17 With regard to the zone of Kurdish settlement, Şeref Xan described “Kurdistan” as stretching “in a straight line from the Sea of Hürmüz [The Persian Gulf] to the provinces of Malatya and Maraş. In this way the line's northern side includes Fars, Iraq al-Ajami, Azerbaijan, Greater and Lesser Armenia. To the south it falls upon the provinces of Iraq al-Arab, Mosul and Diyarbakır.” He points out, however, that “Together with this, many people and tribes from this race [the Kurds] have spread to many countries from east to west.” Şerefhan, Şerefname, 20. Two points need to be made here: the term Kurdistan does not imply a Kurdish demographic majority in these regions and “Kurdistan” was not the only zone of “Kurdish” political activity.\n\n20 According to Ottoman sources, Mîr Şeref revolted and was recognized as governor by the Safavids, after which Sultan Süleyman appointed Olama Beg Takkalu, the former Safavid governor of Azerbaijan, in his place. See Solakzâde, Mehmed, Tarih-i Solakzâde (Istanbul: Mahmud Bey Matbaası, 1298 [1881–1882]), 483–4Google Scholar; and Efendi, Peçevi İbrahim, Peçevi Tarihi I, trans. Baykal, Bekir Sıtkı (Ankara: Kültür bakanlığı yayınları, 1981), 129Google Scholar. The Sharafnama presents a different version of events surrounding Mîr Şeref's defection. Şeref Xan claims that Mîr Şeref had no intention of deserting the Ottoman side. However, as a result of Olama Beg Takkalu's intrigues, as well as promises that if he were to be awarded the governorship of Bitlis he would be able to bring Azerbaijan into the Ottoman fold, Mîr Şeref was left with no other option but to seek sanctuary with the Safavids. Şerefhan, Şerefname, 319–33. According to an Iranian source, Olama Beg Takkalu, who had been amir al-omara of Azerbaijan, wished to become vakil (viceroy) and mokhtar al-saltana (executive of the affairs of state) in place of Chuha Soltan Takkalu. He therefore marched on the royal camp but was forced by Shah Tahmasp to flee to Van. Consequently, he “withdrew his allegiance from the Safavid house and … departed for Istanbul.” The same source makes no mention of Mîr Şeref's defection, merely noting that he, Şeref Xan Rojkî, “the Kurd, governor of Betlīs [Bitlis], was a vassal of the Safavid House” and later that he had been governor of “Tonakābon in Gīlan”: Monshi, Eskandar, History of Shah ‘Abbas, trans.

Bruinessen, Agha, Shaikh and State, 158–9. The broad outlines of this system of autonomy can be found in a ferman dating from the reign of Süleyman the Magnificent. “[Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent] gives the Kurdish princes who during the time of his father Selim the Grim fought the Qezelbash, and who at the moment serve the state with faith and who joined in the campaign of commander and chief Sultan İbrahim Pasha's against Iran with bravery. As a reward for their loyalty and courage and considering their petitions and requests, the provinces and citadels that have been ruled by them individually as their yurtluk and ocaklık since time immemorial along with those areas assigned to them under separate imperial licenses. Their provinces, citadels, cities, villages and pasture lands with all their products, under the condition of inheritance from father to son, are also given to them as their inheritable property. There should never be any external aggression and conflict amongst them. This great order will be obeyed and under no condition changed. In the case of the death of a prince, his province will be given, in its entirety, to his son, if there is only one. If there is more than one son, they [the sons] should divide up the lands by mutual agreement. If they do not come to any compromise, then whomever the princes of Kurdistan decide is the best choice shall succeed, and under the conditions of private ownership, he shall become the holder of the land in perpetuity. If the prince has no heir or relative then the land will not be given to an outsider. Through consultation with the princes of Kurdistan, the area shall be given to either princes or a member of the princes’ family recommended by the princes of Kurdistan.” Reproduced in Nazmı Sevgen, Doğu ve Güneydoğu Anadolu'da Türk Beylikleri: Osmanlı Belgeleri ile Kürt Türkleri Tarihi (Ankara: Türk Kültür Araştırma Enstitüsü, 1982), 42–3.The English translation is based largely on that by Özoğlu.\n\n36 It has been argued that the autonomy of the Kurdish princes was progressively reduced over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. See Özoğlu, Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State, 57–9. For instance, in a document produced just after the Ottoman conquest of the region, the territories of the Kurdish princes were listed under a separate administrative heading—Vilayet-i Kürdistan (The Province of Kurdistan). This administrative division included the following Kurdish principalities, which were described using the term Eyalet (Territory): Bitlis, Soran, Çemişkezek, Cezire Hasankeyf, İmadiye Hakkâri (described as the “Great Princes of Kurdistan”) and Sasun, Çapakçur, Sinar Ziddîk (Zirrîk?), Hizan, Palu, Eğil, Atak and Hîzzo. See TSA D. 5246 (1525) reproduced in Kunt, Metin, The Sultan's Servants: The Transformation of Ottoman Provincial Government, 1550–1650 (New York: Columbia University Press 1983), 109–16Google Scholar. If we compare this to the Ayn-i Ali Efendi's sixteenth century treatise, we see that the Kurdish principalities and “noble counties” are listed as parts of regular provinces. For example, the Province of Diyarbakir is described as consisting of eleven Osmanlı Sancaks (Ottoman/Regular Counties), eight Ekrâd Beyi Sancaks and five Hükûmets. The same source recorded that the Province of Van consisted of thirteen Sancaks and one Hükûmet. See Efendi, Ayn-ı Ali, Kavânîn-i Âl-i Osman der Hülâsa-i Mezâmin-i Defter-i Dîvân (Istanbul: Kalem Yayınları, 1979), 29 and 33Google Scholar. However, given the continued existence of powerful Kurdish principalities well into the nineteenth century, this reduction in autonomy should not be seen as a unidirectional shift.\n\n69 See Özoğlu, Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State, 23–7. Also see Özoğlu, Hakan, “The Impact of Islam on Kurdish Identity Formation in the Middle East,” in The Evolution of Kurdish Nationalism, ed. Ahmed, Mohammed M.A. and Gunter, Michael (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, 2007), 19–35Google Scholar. Similar views have been expressed by other scholars of Kurdish history. For instance, Vladimir Minorsky noted that “The vague and indiscriminate use of the term Kurd goes back to early times. According to Hamza Isfahani (circa 350/961) … ‘The Persians used to call Daylamites “the Kurds of Tabaristan”, as they used to call Arabs “the Kurds of Suristan”, i.e. of “Iraq”.’ Other Arab and Persian authors of the tenth century A.D. mean by Kurds any Iranian nomads of Western Persia, such as the tent-dwellers of Fars.” Minorsky, Vladimir, “The Gūrān,” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 11, no. 1 (1943): 75–103CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Wadie Jwaideh interprets this as meaning that Kurd was synonymous with “nomad.” Jwaideh, Wadie, The Kurdish Nationalist Movement: Its Origins and Development (New York: Syracuse University Press, 2006), 12Google Scholar. In a similar vein, one Armenian scholar has argued that Kurd (Kurtān) in Pahlavi texts (sixth and seventh century) described a nomadic population; while in later Arabic and Persian (eighth to twelfth century) sources Kurd (Akrād/Kurdān) was synonymous with “nomads, cattle-breeders, brigands.” Asatrian, Garnik, “Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds,” Iran and the Caucasus, no. 13 (2009): 1–58CrossRefGoogle Scholar especially 28."
