What is often left unattended is accessibility and security. In this article, I would like to highlight some accessibility and security issues for the HTML Anchor element and how we can quickly solve these issues in our projects.\n\nOpening Links in a New Tab or Window\n\nMost web developers will know that you can open links in a new tab or window by setting the target attribute on an anchor to either “_blank” or “_self” respectively.\n\nWhat is less known is how this impacts people using screen reader technology. The simple answer is that screen readers don’t inform the user of this in advance and it can be frustrating when this happens unexpectedly.\n\nThere are several easy ways to solve this issue. Some people suggest using CSS or JavaScript to add hidden text through an :afterselector or appending a <span>element inside the anchor indicating that the link will open in a new tab."
