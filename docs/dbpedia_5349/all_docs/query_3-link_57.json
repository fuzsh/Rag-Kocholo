        "text": "Short bio\n\nI am a 65-year-old economist with a master’s degree in information science. I have worked at the Slovenian Institute for Adult Education for 28 years as head of its promotion and information unit. Since 1996, I have been the national coordinator of the Slovenian Lifelong Learning Weeks. Since 2012, I have headed the implementation of the European Agenda for Adult Learning in our country. I am a keen advocate for life-long and life-wide learning.\n\nMy story\n\nMy first encounter with adult education (AE) was in the eighties. Having entered a rehabilitation programme based on a ‘socio-andragogical method’ I soon realised that my education was not over. Until then, like the majority, I could hardly wait for schooling to end, to establish a home and family. What an illusion! Inexperienced and quite naïve, I had to start learning again – this time within a community striving for mental and physical health – to gain skills for life.\n\nThe decisive encounter with AE happened in the nineties. Having become much wiser, I was looking for a job in the humanistic field. When offered a position in the newly established Slovenian Institute for Adult Education, I eagerly accepted. Although without adequate formal education, I had internalised the reasons for lifelong learning by then. Therefore, I was certain about my ability to become a committed worker in this field. It has been a joyful journey ever since.\n\nFor people and together with them\n\nIn the European Year of Lifelong Learning (1996), convinced that we should celebrate opportunities for and achievements of learning, we started organising the Slovenian Lifelong Learning Weeks (LLW). We soon realised that as a small team at national level, we lacked resources to reach our target groups.\n\nTherefore, we formed alliances with AE providers across the country and established the network of LLW coordinators. These institutions are the ones who in their local or thematic areas are acquainted with other providers, participants, non-participants, and with actual needs for learning. We also realised that working for people entails their close involvement. With the aim of making a real impact, we engaged not only professionals – adult educators in the widest sense, but also learners. As a result, our annual five-week country-wide campaign consisted of approximately 8,000 events and 1,800 providers. Thus, the LLW has become an indispensable pillar of our culture of lifelong learning.\n\nLearning – why and what for\n\nWe achieved another breakthrough with the implementation of the European Agenda for Adult Learning (EAAL project). Among other tasks, we have been organising EAAL forums – in 2021, six events on the future of AE in respect to socio-economic trends, and in the 2022–2023 phase, eight on skills for life. Green and digital skills, health and cultural awareness, civic and financial skills, media as well as personal and inter-personal skills are areas of exploration.\n\nAgain, we are engaging people to work for and with others to raise awareness on the necessity for lifelong learning. However, in addition to promoting AE providers and learning opportunities, we are increasingly calling attention to ‘why’ learning is so important and ‘what for’. The answer to ‘why’ renders indisputable meaning to our learning – whether formal, non-formal or informal. The answer to ‘what for’ establishes clear connection among learning and its direct and indirect benefits.\n\nMy vision\n\nRecently, I had a nice ‘chat’ with ChatGPT. Acknowledging its potential seemed a smart thing to do. Irresistibly, the development of ICT is moving forward, and I am anxious to see where it goes. However, without fear that it will extinguish our role, I would like to call for a parallel development which at first sight, may seem to go backwards in time.\n\nAs a strong believer in the eternal presence and importance of human wisdom, I envision people interacting in communities established geographically or thematically.\n\nThere individuals exchange, experiment, create knowledge (in its finest, all-encompassing sense), and act – not only to react to but to co-create challenges of the future. So called ‘reflect, learn & act-tanks’ or communities should be based on the ‘meaning-making’ of learning, equal intergenerational and intercultural representation, flexibility as well as values, mutual respect, and trust. By wisely using and constantly enriching our wisdom, humanity could and should become invincible."
