In EÄil, the chance of a wet day over the course of October is very rapidly increasing, starting the month at 9% and ending it at 19%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 28% on February 14, and its lowest chance is 1% on August 16.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during October in EÄil is rapidly increasing, starting the month at 0.7 inches, when it rarely exceeds 1.6 inches, and ending the month at 1.8 inches, when it rarely exceeds 3.8 inches or falls below 0.4 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of October in EÄil, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 11 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 2 minutes, 21 seconds, and weekly decrease of 16 minutes, 28 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is October 31, with 10 hours, 36 minutes of daylight and the longest day is October 1, with 11 hours, 47 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in EÄil is 6:15 AM on October 1 and the latest sunrise is 29 minutes later at 6:45 AM on October 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 6:02 PM on October 1 and the earliest sunset is 41 minutes earlier at 5:21 PM on October 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in EÄil during 2024.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:56 AM and sets 14 hours, 50 minutes later, at 7:46 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:32 AM and sets 9 hours, 30 minutes later, at 5:03 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in October in EÄil\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in October in EÄilOct112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMSepNovSep 34:56 AMSep 34:56 AMSep 185:35 AMSep 185:35 AMOct 29:50 PMOct 29:50 PMOct 172:27 PMOct 172:27 PMNov 13:48 PMNov 13:48 PMNov 1612:29 AMNov 1612:29 AM5:54 AM5:54 AM7:05 PM7:05 PM6:10 PM6:10 PM6:08 AM6:08 AM5:44 AM5:44 AM5:51 PM5:51 PM5:30 PM5:30 PM7:31 AM7:31 AM6:34 AM6:34 AM5:03 PM5:03 PM4:31 PM4:31 PM7:38 AM7:38 AM\n\nOct 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 2%4:46 AME5:31 PMW-11:11 AMS252,151 mi 2 0%5:44 AME5:51 PMW-11:49 AMS252,556 mi 3 0%6:42 AME6:12 PMWSW-12:28 PMS252,530 mi 4 2%7:41 AMESE6:34 PMWSW-1:08 PMS252,070 mi 5 6%8:41 AMESE6:59 PMWSW-1:50 PMS251,154 mi 6 12%9:43 AMESE7:29 PMWSW-2:36 PMS249,744 mi 7 19%10:46 AMESE8:05 PMSW-3:26 PMS247,806 mi 8 28%11:49 AMSE8:50 PMSW-4:19 PMS245,322 mi 9 38%12:48 PMSE9:44 PMSW-5:16 PMS242,314 mi 10 50%1:41 PMSE10:47 PMSW-6:14 PMS238,865 mi 11 60%2:27 PMESE11:56 PMWSW-7:12 PMS235,130 mi 12 71%3:05 PMESE--8:07 PMS231,346 mi 13 81%-1:09 AMWSW3:38 PMESE9:01 PMS227,811 mi 14 89%-2:24 AMWSW4:08 PMESE9:52 PMS224,863 mi 15 96%-3:39 AMW4:35 PME10:43 PMS222,827 mi 16 99%-4:55 AMW5:02 PME11:34 PMS221,957 mi 17 100%-6:12 AMW5:30 PMENE-- 18 100%-7:31 AMWNW6:03 PMENE12:26 AMS222,386 mi 19 97%-8:50 AMWNW6:40 PMENE1:21 AMS224,090 mi 20 91%-10:08 AMNW7:26 PMNE2:20 AMS226,888 mi 21 83%-11:20 AMNW8:21 PMNE3:21 AMS230,476 mi 22 73%-12:23 PMNW9:22 PMNE4:22 AMS234,482 mi 23 63%-1:14 PMNW10:28 PMNE5:20 AMS238,537 mi 24 50%-1:54 PMWNW11:34 PMENE6:15 AMS242,330 mi 25 42%-2:26 PMWNW-7:04 AMS245,635 mi 26 32%12:38 AMENE2:53 PMWNW-7:49 AMS248,313 mi 27 23%1:40 AMENE3:16 PMWNW-8:31 AMS250,303 mi 28 16%2:39 AME3:37 PMW-9:10 AMS251,605 mi 29 9%3:37 AME3:57 PMW-9:49 AMS252,263 mi 30 4%4:35 AME4:17 PMW-10:27 AMS252,346 mi 31 1%5:34 AMESE4:39 PMWSW-11:07 AMS251,934 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in EÄil is essentially constant during October, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on June 2, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in EÄil is essentially constant during October, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 5.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 1, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.5 miles per hour, while on November 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.6 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in EÄil throughout October is predominantly from the north, with a peak proportion of 40% on October 1.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in EÄil typically lasts for 7.6 months (231 days), from around March 30 to around November 16, rarely starting before March 9 or after April 20, and rarely ending before October 30 or after December 6.\n\nThe month of October in EÄil is more likely than not fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season decreasing from 100% to 87% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in October in EÄil\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in EÄil are increasing during October, increasing by 320Â°F, from 3,946Â°F to 4,266Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in EÄil is rapidly decreasing during October, falling by 1.8 kWh, from 5.3 kWh to 3.4 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of EÄil are 38.257 deg latitude, 40.074 deg longitude, and 2,825 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of EÄil contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,253 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 2,922 feet. Within 10 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (2,799 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (6,909 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of EÄil is covered by cropland (41%), sparse vegetation (23%), trees (14%), and bare soil (13%), within 10 miles by cropland (44%) and grassland (20%), and within 50 miles by cropland (43%) and grassland (23%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in EÄil, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in EÄil.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and EÄil according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at EÄil is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between EÄil and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDiyarbakÄ±r Airport (LTCC, 54%, 26 mi, south, -574 ft elevation change)\n\nBingÃ¶l Airport (LTCU, 22%, 48 mi, northeast, 1,037 ft elevation change)\n\nElazÄ±Ä Airport (LTCA, 24%, 49 mi, northwest, 102 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of EÄil and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
