        "text": "Comin' from Where I'm From is the second studio album by American singer Anthony Hamilton. It was released on September 23, 2003, by So So Def Recordings and Arista Records. The album debuted at number 33 on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 33,000 copies,[11] while peaking at number six on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Comin' from Where I'm From was certified platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 2, 2004,[12] and as of December 2005, it had sold 1.2 million copies in the United States.[13]\n\nAnthony Hamilton teamed up with The LOX member Sheek Louch for a remix with three rapped verses from Louch. \"Comin' from Where I'm From\" was sampled by G-Unit for the song \"Where I'm From\", from their 2004 mixtape G-Unit Radio Part 5: All Eyez on Us.\"Comin' from Where I'm From\" was remixed by Lupe Fiasco's Mixtape Fahrenheit 1/15.\"Comin' from Where I'm from\" was also sampled by Akon for the song \"Senegal\".\n\nAnthony Hamilton Comin 39; From Where I 39;m From Zip Download\n\nDownload File ðŸ”¥ https://bltlly.com/2y4ry3 ðŸ”¥\n\n''Comin' from Where I'm From'' is the second studio album by American R&B and soul singer-songwriter Anthony Hamilton, released July 15, 2003 on Arista Records in the United States. It debuted and peaked at number thirty-three on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 chart in October 2003 with first-week sales of 33,000 copies, spending seventy-six weeks on the chart. The run was longer on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it debuted at number seven (reaching its peak position of number six the following week) and stayed for one hundred weeks.\n\nAre the old ways the best ways? Sometimes, sometimes not. In 2003, they mostly represent one way among many, which doesn't stop R&B puritans from decrying the fact that the good old days are no more-and which will doubtless contribute to the slow and steady rise of South Carolina native Anthony Hamilton. He's a session vocalist who's sung background for D'Angelo, and on Comin' From Where I'm From he's as old-school as it's possible to be at this late date, from the very '70s electric keyboards that ground most of the songs to the churchy background vocals that he cannily mixes as high as his own leads. Hamilton's got a wonderfully thick baritone, gravelly or smooth as he needs it to be, and occasionally, as on \"Lucille,\" he even ratchets up to a breathy, whispery, utterly beguiling near-falsetto.\n\nBut Hamilton's songwriting on Comin' From isn't quite at the level of his singing. Sometimes he nails it: \"Lucille\" moves from a sly Kenny Rogers quote-turns out she's picked a fine time to leave him-to a harrowing, heartbroken tale of a woman who leaves a good man (Anthony, natch) for a man who beats her. But Hamilton's unpretentious-everyman ethos, reminiscent of previous soul men like Bill Withers or Dobie Gray, comes up dry more often than you might like. Making celebrations of the ordinary interesting to any degree is damn hard work; Hamilton makes it all look easy, but sometimes he makes it look tossed off, too.\n\nThe song \"Comin' from Where I'm From\" by Anthony Hamilton explores the struggles and hardships he has faced in his life, particularly the challenges that come from growing up in a disadvantaged environment.\n\nThe pre-chorus suggests that Hamilton attempted to live a good life, free from trouble, but due to the circumstances he faced, he found himself living too fast and trying to make ends meet through questionable means.\n\nThe chorus emphasizes the roughness and difficulty of Hamilton's upbringing. It speaks to the challenges faced by those who come from similar backgrounds, where times are hard, and sometimes they have to resort to unconventional methods, like walking to work or engaging in \"a little dirt\" to survive.\n\nThe subsequent chorus emphasizes the various emotional struggles Hamilton faces. He highlights that coming from where he's from, sometimes he has to express his pain, anger, and worry openly. He acknowledges that these experiences have shaped him, paving the way for personal growth.\n\nOverall, \"Comin' from Where I'm From\" speaks to the resilience and determination needed to overcome adversity. It explores the impact of one's upbringing on their journey in life, depicting the challenges, heartbreaks, and personal growth that occur along the way.\n\nHamilton joins a list of other music artists and Black celebrities to receive honorary degrees this graduation season. West Coast rapper E-40 received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Grambling State University, and Erika Alexander walked away with a Doctor of Music degree from Bennett College. Usher also received high praise as the keynote speaker at the Berklee College of Music and was presented with an honorary doctorate for his contributions to music and philanthropy.\n\nSix time Grammy-nominated recording artist Anthony Hamilton is gearing up for a national tour that kicks off in Chicago, IL on November 5th. The \"Playin' It Cool\" tour takes its name from the lead single \"Cool\" featuring David Banner, from Hamilton's forthcoming album, The Point Of It All, set for release on December 2nd.\n\nMost recently, Anthony Hamilton made his big-screen debut performing his poignant hit single \"Do You Feel Me,\" in the Oscar-nominated American Gangster movie. He will also have a track in the upcoming film and soundtrack \"Soul Men\" starring Samuel L. Jackson and the late Bernie Mack. Over the past five years, Hamilton has established a loyal following from his 2003 platinum-certified debut album Comin' From Where I'm From, which spawned the hit \"Charlene,\" which climbed to #3 on the R&B Albums chart and garnered him three Grammy nominations, to his last album, the gold-certified sophomore Ain't Nobody Worryin' released in 2005, which sparked the #1 hit \"Can't Let Go.\" Hamilton is an \"artist's artist\" who has collaborated with a wide range of his peers including: Buddy Guy, Al Green, Dr. Dre, Santana, Angie Stone, Young Jeezy, Nappy Roots, Musiq Soulchild and more. 2351a5e196\n\ndownload rainbow\n\ndownload itch.io\n\npnb metlife my activity app download\n\n30 minute deep sleep music mp3 free download no copyright\n\ndownload mp3 young lex o aja ya kan"
