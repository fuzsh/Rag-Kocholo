        "text": "Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nMany people anticipated who would partake in the next battle, but now, there is no need to wonder. Jermaine Dupri, prominent songwriter and record producer, confirmed that his label, So So Def, will go up against Diddy's Label, Bad Boy.\n\nBack in August, the two entertainers spoke on the thought of battling each other while on Instagram live. Diddy told Jermaine, \"J.D., if you want that smoke, you can get that smoke anytime,” to which Dupri responded, “relax.”\n\nBoth labels were founded in the same year, 1993, and were responsible for putting out some of the hottest hits at the time.\n\nOn the other hand, Bad Boy created \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" by Notorious B.I.G., \"Cupid\" by 112, \"Love Like This\" by Faith Evans, and more.\n\nAs of now, there is no date scheduled for the battle, but many people are already placing bets on who they think will win. Who do you have taking the belt at this matchup? Sound off in the comments."
