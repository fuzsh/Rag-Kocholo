        "text": "The rap game is finally giving Atlanta producer Jermaine Dupri his roses. These are the artists he's signed to So So Def over the years!\n\nBy S.Y.\n\nOct. 18 2023, Published 2:37 p.m. ET\n\nFor three of the five decades that hip-hop has been alive, So So Def Recordings founder Jermaine Dupri has been a pretty big deal.\n\nFrom his role in Freaknik — the legendary street party that helped shape Atlanta's hip-hop scene — to the unforgettable hits he has produced, the CEO has had the rap game on lock for years now.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWith Jermaine at the helm, So So Def Recordings has churned out chart-topping hits from the 99s to the 2000s and beyond. But So So Def wouldn't be what it is today without the artists who cemented the label's legacy.\n\nWith Jermaine at the helm, So So Def Recordings has churned out chart-topping hits from the 99s to the 2000s and beyond. But So So Def wouldn't be what it is today without the artists who cemented the label's legacy.\n\nBow Wow\n\nAlthough the \"Lil\" in Lil Bow Wow is silent now, his iconic Harlem Shake will live rent-free in our minds forever. The rapper made his debut in the rap game under the guidance of Jermaine Dupri.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHis debut album, Beware of Dog, dropped in the fall of 2000, and \"Bounce With Me\" quickly became a fan favorite. Bow Wow's undeniable talent and stage presence made him an instant sensation.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOver the years, he continued to release hit after hit. Some of Bow's most memorable tracks include \"Let Me Hold You\" and \"Like You\" — both of which helped solidify his status as one of So So Def's top-earning stars.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDa Brat\n\nDa Brat is another remarkable artist who calls So So Def Recordings home.\n\nHer debut album, Funkdafied, made a major splash in the hip-hop community. More than a decade after its release, the title track still slaps.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDa Brat's lyrical IQ, distinct flow, and style broke barriers in a male-dominated industry, paving the way for other female artists. She continued to shine with hits like \"Give It 2 You\" and \"That's What I'm Looking For.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nXscape\n\nWhen we talk about iconic girl groups that made their mark in the '90s, Xscape undoubtedly tops the list.\n\nThis quartet, which included Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Harris, LaTocha Scott, and Tamika Scott, was among the many jewels in Jermaine Dupri's crown.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHowever, what differentiated Xscape's journey from their labelmates' was their unique blend of vocal talent, authenticity, and relatability. They weren't just a girl group — they were the embodiment of 90s R&B.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJagged Edge\n\nThis list would be incomplete without Jagged Edge.\n\nA Jagged Era hit the airwaves in 1997 and set the stage for R&B groups to come.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe group's earlier tracks like \"Let's Get Married\" and \"I Gotta Be\" gave fans a taste of their magic, but it wasn't until the 2000s that they really caught fire.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nYoung BloodZ\n\nAtlanta rappers Sean Paul and J-Bo were known as the Young BloodZ in the early 2000s.\n\nTheir 2003 hit single \"Damn!\" featuring Lil Jon catapulted them to mainstream success and showcased their undeniable charisma. Later, they dropped their Southern classic, \"Presidential,\" also a certified bop among fans.\n\nAlthough the duo hasn't dropped an album since 2008, they've definitely earned their place in the So So Def Hall of Fame."
