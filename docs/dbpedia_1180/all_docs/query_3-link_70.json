        "text": "If you’ve followed pop music in any capacity in the last five years, it’s likely you’ve heard the name Scooter Braun. He is a music manager, entrepreneur and executive who, in 2019, purchased the label Big Machine Records (which is distributed by Universal) – and thus started the highly publicised dispute surrounding the ownership of Taylor Swift’s masters, a scandal that now sees her re-recording each of her albums.\n\nThis week, Billboard reported that more high-profile artists had chosen to part ways with Braun as their manager. Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato have allegedly cut ties, and the Frozen star Idina Menzel is also reported to have left. The Colombian singer J Balvin also split with him in May, and is now managed by Roc Nation; it was also reported earlier this year that Braun was no longer working with Justin Bieber, but this has been denied.\n\nThe public is well aware that there is much more to the music industry than the artists we see and hear about all the time. Braun is one of a number of extremely powerful execs pulling strings on who we listen to, when, and the experience of those artists in their own industry. As we wait to hear the validity and context of the claims – Braun cryptically and jokingly addressed the allegations on X on Tuesday by writing “Breaking news… I’m no longer managing myself” – many will be asking: who is Scooter Braun?\n\nScott “Scooter” Braun was born in 1981 in New York City to Jewish-American parents; his grandparents, originally from Hungary, were both Holocaust survivors. He studied at Emory University in Atlanta but dropped out when the rapper and producer Jermaine Dupri asked him to work at his record label, So So Def, in 2002. After four years, he left that job to pursue his own marketing business and started to scoop up talent – notably Justin Bieber, whom Braun noticed in a YouTube video when Bieber was just 12. Over the next few years, his company SB Projects signed a host of notable names including Grande, Lovato and Balvin, but also Kanye West, Carly Rae Jepsen and David Guetta.\n\nUntil 2019, Braun remained a name known primarily to industry insiders – and then he became Taylor Swift’s mortal enemy. Big Machine was a label previously run by Scott Borchetta, who founded it in Nashville in 2005, specialising in country and pop – and until 2018, when Taylor Swift signed a new deal with Republic Records, it controlled her music. When Braun purchased Big Machine for $330m via his investment company Ithaca in 2019 – with Borchetta staying on as CEO – the ownership of Swift’s master recordings (the part that the label owns, distinct from the intellectual property) transferred automatically to him. This meant that he would profit from every royalty Swift’s songs earned.\n\nSwift said that she had tried to buy her masters back from Big Machine before the sale went through, but that this would involve staying on with them, rather than moving to Republic. “I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn’ one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in,” Swift wrote on Tumblr when Braun took ownership, saying she had only found out about the sale at the same time as the general public. “I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future.” In the same post, she described Braun as a “manipulative bully” (Braun’s prior involvement with Kanye West meant, according to Swift, he was involved in Swift’s high-profile dispute with the rapper the previous year). “Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work,” she said.\n\nAfter a prolonged legal dispute in which Big Machine retained the rights to the masters, Swift turned to her last resort: to re-record the albums under her ownership."
