        "text": "Revisit the records from some of the hottest artists in hip-hop and r&b.\n\nEstablished in the early 90s, Jermaine Dupri's iconic So So Def Recording label has become synonymous with groundbreaking talent and chart-topping hits. Throughout the years, the label has developed diverse artists, Xscape, Lil Bow Wow, and Kriss Kross, and produced timeless music that resonates with audiences from all over.\n\nAt this year's “BET Hip Hop Awards,” we celebrated not just 50 years of one of the best music genres but also three decades of a record label that has contributed significantly to the art form with performances from its founder Dupri and several former label stars.\n\nAs we look back at yet another amazing celebration of hip hop, join us as we revisit some of the biggest artists ever signed to So So Def.\n\nXscape\n\nLegendary r&b girl group, Xscape, was one of So So Def’s earliest successes. With hits like \"Just Kickin' It\" and \"Understanding,\" they set the bar high for R&B in the 90s.\n\nKris Kross\n\nTeenage rap duo Kris Kross made waves with their smash hit \"Jump.\" Their energy and unique fashion style became synonymous with So So Def's early image.\n\nDa Brat\n\nDa Brat was the first solo female rapper to go platinum. Her raw talent and fierce lyrics made her a force to be reckoned with in the male-dominated rap scene.\n\nJagged Edge\n\nJagged Edge delivered soul-stirring ballads like \"Let's Get Married\" and \"Promise\" as one the first male r&b acts on the roster.\n\nBow Wow\n\nBow Wow quickly rose to fame with hits like \"Bounce with Me\" and \"Like You,\" becoming one of the youngest and most influential rappers on the label and of his time.\n\nBone Crusher\n\nBone Crusher’s powerful presence and gritty lyrics added a new dimension to hip-hop.\n\nAnthony Hamilton\n\nAnthony Hamilton’s soulful voice found a home at So So Def, leading to timeless hits such as \"Charlene\" and \"Can't Let Go.\""
