        "text": "As a true 90’s RnB girl (#iykyk) ) I was so pleased to hear Grammy nominated singer, songwriter, producer and instrumentalist Jon B was heading to Manchester on his recent UK tour, which included a couple of nights at London’s The Jazz Café, as well as Koko in Camden and Birmingham.\n\nWhat I love about The Deaf Institute is the intimate setting in the Music Room, as it gives a real connection with the artists and fans alike, and this night was no different, especially as it was a full house! It was such a good crowd. Good energy, good vibes and also a mix of ages, which is credit to the longevity of Jon B’s almost 30 years “in the game” as he put it, and also the timeless music he has created. I mean, let’s face it. are you even a bonafide 90’s RnB fan (see what I done there?!) if you don’t have Jon B’s music on rotation still, or at least on your playlists?!\n\nSupport for the evening was from J.Brown. A fellow American who has enjoyed much success, capturing his first number 1 on the Adult R&B Billboard chart back in October 2023 with his track ‘ My Whole Heart’. From the onset he really did engage with the crowd, and as we know it is not always easy to open for the main act, but, he established a good rapport from the get-go and was very entertaining, as well as obviously being able to hold a note or two as well! Vocally he was on point as he performed tracks such as ‘Moon’, ‘Vibe’ and the above mentioned ‘ My Whole Heart’, all of which by his own admission are him singing to his woman and are love songs. I confess J.Brown was unknown to me prior to the show, but am very pleased to have been introduced to his music, in fact, as I write I am listening to his most recent album ‘The Art of Making Love’.\n\nMuch to my delight a few 90’s RnB classics were played by the local DJ collective Soul Central to set the mood even further as we waited for Jon B, but thankfully, it was not long until the band took their place on stage to rapturous applause in anticipation, and he did not mess around opening the show to the infamous, and sexy ‘Pretty Girl’; the second single from his 1995 debut album ‘Bonafide’. From then on in, the music flowed, and as well as singing, he also played keyboard throughout the show too. Back to back classics including ‘Cool Relax’, a brief rendition of D’Angelo’s ‘Lady’ and the Grammy nominated duet with Babyface ‘Someone To Love’ followed – with help from one of the two backing vocalists, who absolutely surprised us when he sang because to take on Babyface’s vocals, and sound as he did, just wow!\n\n‘Isn’t It Scary’ – which is one of my favourite tracks but was never actually released as a single – sounded so good. That real smooth RnB vibe had me singing along, as it did to ‘I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)’, as well as ‘Don’t Say’!\n\nDuring his set he announced he has a new studio album – his first as an independent artist – coming out later this year after a 10 year hiatus, that includes a heavyweight of 4 featured artists, all of which he was keeping very tight lipped about, other than to tease us with the first single ‘Waiting On You’ featuring Tank. If this song is an example of what is to come, then I for one am very excited for the release.\n\nThe crowd had been hinting for the next song since he pretty much started his set, so he did not keep us waiting any longer for the superb ‘They Don’t Know’, a song penned by his real life situation at the time, that near tore the roof off!\n\nThe 90’s had a plethora of fantastic soundtracks which consisted mainly of contemporary RnB and Hip Hop. ‘Hav Plenty’ being one of them (and is still in my music collection to this day!) which included the classic and firm favourite of mine, ‘Keep It Real’ with Coko and Jay-Z. It was at this point I was in my element, so apologies for those around me that now know I do not have the voice of Coko!!\n\nJon B has pretty much worked with the best of the best within the RnB and Hip Hop fraternities, including being the last person to work and record with the late, great Tupac Shakur on their song ‘Are U Still Down’. He gave a lovely tribute to him. About working with him and what it meant to him before performing the song, as well as actually rapping some of 2Pac’s lyrics! His collaborations also included the legend of Dancehall, Beenie Man, who featured on the track ‘Everytime’ and when performing this it was an absolute crowd pleaser with plenty of wining of waists! And, of course he could not leave us without the 2001 smash hit’ Don’t Talk’ with an ode to Teena Marie’s ‘Square Biz’ in there too. Cue plenty of singing and happy, smiley faces! What a finale!\n\nI have to say, I was pleasantly surprised as to the all round performance from Jon B. Along with his live band and background vocalists – who were all fantastic – he most definitely came to put on a great show, and that he did! It was clear to see that even after so many years in the industry, his passion and love for music is still there for all to see. He sounds great, and looks great (I mean, how is he almost 50?!). From back to back songs old and new, to him rapping Jay-Z and Tupac lyrics, not to mention some Beenie Man lines (I was not expecting that!) and playing on keys too! This man is super talented. As well as the ode to Teena Marie, he also paid tribute to another blue-eyed soul favourite, the late Bobby Caldwell earlier on too which was a nice touch, him appreciating those before him, who paved the way.\n\nThis was a great night and one to remember that’s for sure.\n\nThis was one very happy 90’s girl!\n\nFollow Jon B on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3SRJWVa6lZnqRHOyAHmDrX?si=–kpXRlfSx-5CJayqG6Wxw\n\nFollow Jon B on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialjonb?igsh=ZDlpdHp4aWE3MWJz\n\nFollow Jon B on YouTube: https://youtube.com/@jonbvevo?si=mMNZAjX43UWbYp7O\n\nFollow Jon B on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@officialjonb1\n\nFor all things J.

I escaped the cold and frosty winter of the UK, and head off to the beautiful island of Barbados. It was my first ever trip to the island and little did I foresee I would actually catch so much great live music, and not only that, a festival too!\n\nThis took place high up in the forest of Naniki, a hidden delight in St Joseph Parish, as part of the Barbados Music Festival called ‘Songs of the Forest’ to a back drop of the most stunning of scenery and breath taking views. I mean, what’s not to love!!\n\nThe sun was shining, the rum was flowing (not for me though! #iykyk) and the good vibes were definitely aplenty!! The stage was set and as music lovers gathered we were entertained by the host WESU, who sang while playing keys (he also looked like Bruno Mars!) to really set the mood!\n\nHeadline act for the day was none other than legendary artist, musician and producer. The original Dub Master himself, Dennis Bovell MBE. He was born in Barbados but he then moved to London as a young boy. What I loved was that throughout his set, he spoke of many stories about his life from his childhood in Barbados, to becoming a key player in the UK reggae scene – and showing no signs of slowing down I might add – working with a how’s who from varied genres for decades now and who’s sound also became what we know and love as Lover’s Rock.\n\nHe sang many tracks including ‘Bettah’, ‘Choose Me’, ‘Dubmaster’, ‘Fall of Babylon’, and ‘Oh Mama, Oh Papa’. And of course, as he said himself, he had to commemorate the genre Lovers Rock and so he performed his version of THE anthem he wrote back in 1979 for Janet Kay, ‘Silly Games’. It was the perfect penultimate song! What was so great to see was, he had a full band and backing singers who were all students from Barbados Community College and they apparently did not have much rehearsal time and trust me when I say, you would have had absolutely no idea! They were fantastic and sounded like seasoned professionals! The whole set from start to finish was engaging and a joy. Good, good Bajan vibes!\n\nAfter a short break and as the audience caught their breath (and topped up their rum!!) we then had the pleasure of listening to the Jazz Ensemble. Lead by Jazz Saxophonist and composer Andre Woodvine, a graduate of Berkley College of Music and who has produced three CD’s of original Caribbean Jazz, as well as having been at the forefront of development of the genre via education, assisting in the formation of the first associate degree of music program teaching it as Barbados Community College. He was accompanied by some talented students and peers alike, giving the audience a mesmerising performance of beautiful music and if like me you love and appreciate those talented musicians who can play their behind out instruments, then you would have thoroughly enjoyed this set!\n\nAs the sun was setting to the backdrop of the stage, I have to say on reflection at that time, there was something quite magical about listening to live music and watching artists perform, in the sunshine, in such beautiful surroundings. It was truly memorable day for many reasons and one I will never forget.\n\nGreat music, great setting, great country!\n\nFLOETIC [flo-eh-tic]. Noun. Poetic delivery with musical intent.\n\nSeven time Grammy nominated artist and one half the incomparable duo Floetry, The Floacist, brought her magic to Manchester’s infamous Band On The Wall this week in celebration of 20 years of their critically acclaimed debut album ‘Floetic’ and OH MY GOODNESS (yes friends, caps are most definitely needed!) what an absolute treat!\n\nWhen I say there are not enough superlatives to describe the whole evening and the truly poetic performance from The Floacist, I am not exaggerating!! After her band and 3 backing vocalists took to the stage, the anticipation was rising and she appeared to rapturous applause, bare foot, looking absolutely stunning to the anthem, the classic, ‘Floetic’. Wow!\n\nFrom the classic Floetry tracks, to solo material, with a touch of new music – which was also well received and I look forward to it’s release – the whole energy in the building was that of high vibration, from start to finish. It was like one big family had come together in celebration and I cannot remember the last time I have been to a gig and felt that energy!\n\nThe band – which included The Floacist’s husband on drums – were on point, not to mention the backing vocalists. The music flowed and the vibe was high and as the end of the show was approaching, one song that I did not anticipate – as it was from Floetry’s brilliant sophomore album ‘Flo’Ology’ – was ‘SupaStar’ which featured the rapper Common. Oh, my, goodness! The audience near tore the roof off singing every word to this classic! Just brilliant!\n\nAs a poet who puts her poems to verse, to deliver poetry with musical intent, I was totally blown away by The Floacist. Her skills and her performance were outstanding and every person in that room felt every single word spoken from every single song and despite being a fan of 20 years, it was my first time seeing her perform live and it was way beyond my expectations!\n\nWith her poetic flow, The Floacist is a very different artist. Not only this, but she also works with many aspiring poets via FLO Vortex in London. (see the link below for more information)\n\nHonourable mention has to go to Band On The Wall, which was the perfect setting to host The Floacist. It was my first trip back since their refurbishment and I have to say it did not disappoint! The character and ‘feel’ of the venue has been maintained, as well as the amazing sound system! So, credit to all involved!\n\nTo Natalie ‘The Floacist’ Stewart, thankyou!

I would say the excitement I felt was like that of a child on Christmas Eve! Add into the equation that it was none other than the sublime Jarrod Lawson, who I have had the pleasure of seeing perform twice previously, I knew it was going to be pretty special. And, that it was and so much more!\n\nThere was a definite buzz in air at The Blues Kitchen. The feeling of being able to socialise again. The euphoria of experiencing musicianship at it’s finest. Of seeing faces familiar and new. Oh, how I’ve missed that!\n\nEnter the band to rapturous applause, and of course for the main man, Jarrod Lawson, as he approached and took his seat at the keyboards. It was straight down to business with the title track of his sophomore album and 2020 release ‘Be The Change’. One of two socially conscious songs on the album, and one that was featured this year as part of the BE LOVE livestream via The King Centre with Dr. Bernice King – the daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King – who spoke of the meaning of the lyrics and even sang a few lines of the song during an interview, of which she shared a snippet on her Instagram. High praise and recognition indeed!\n\nThe music flowed. Song after song. ‘I’ll Be Your Radio’ which features the brilliant Moonchild followed and I did wonder how this version would compare without the stunning vocals of Amber Navran, but I have to say it was just fabulous! ‘Battlefield’, the sublime ‘Love Isn’t Always Enough’, ‘Connected’ and ‘Evalee’, a beautiful song written and dedicated to the lady in Jarrod’s life, which has the influence of D’Angelo running through it, was beautiful. And, the notes he hits, just incredible, all while playing keys!\n\n‘Embrace What We Are’ hit me quite differently hearing it being performed live, the lyrics are so poignant following the murder of George Floyd, and I have to say I felt quite emotional listening and watching and can only hope and pray that change will come. So, as the song says “Let’s embrace what we are and stop killing each other”.\n\nWe were treated to ‘Soul Symphony’ which initially featured on Jarrod Lawson’s ‘At The BBC’ EP from 2015, as well as then being added to the track list of ‘Be The Change’. Beautiful renditions of ‘Sleepwalkers’ and ‘Spiritual Eyes’ from the self titled 2014 release had me reminiscing on good times from previous live performances, as well as reminding us all of how solid a debut album that was!\n\nAs much as there were many highlights of the night, a special mention has to go to the cover of The Isley Brothers classic ‘Footsteps In The Dark’. Oh my goodness! It was a bit special both vocally and musically and it brought the house down! Let’s face it, there are not many artists out there that can sing that song and do it justice. Jarrod lawson did and then some! Amazing!\n\nThe rapport and admiration between Jarrod and the band – Chris Friesen on bass, Trent Baarspul on guitar and the newest addition on drums, Brian Foxworth aka B-Fox – was clear to see from the off and during certain solos it was apparent why there was such respect for each other. So much talent on one small stage!\n\nIt has to be said, Brian Foxworth, his energy and stage presence was infectious and I found myself in awe watching him on drums. He is incredible. Not only can he play superbly, he can sing a note or two as well!! Towards the end of the set, it has to be said he kind of stole the show – sorry Jarrod!! He was playing the drums and began instantly engaging the crowd, then singing, to what became a fantastic rendition/’mash-up’ of The Gap Band’s ‘Yearning For Your Love’ with full audience participation – who were in fine voice too – as well as Jarrod joining in, clapping, smiling from ear to ear absolutely loving the vibe!! Personally, having not been to a gig for so long, this actually gave me goosebumps! A treasured moment seeing so many enjoying themselves after so, so long. Thankyou B-Fox!\n\nAs the set was coming to an end with ‘Why Don’t You Call Me Baby Anymore’ with all it’s jazzy vibes and stunning vocals, it felt quite fitting and all while the crowd were showing their appreciation for what was a fantastic night, as they new it was almost home time.\n\nThere are not enough superlatives for me to describe how fantastic a performance it was, yet again, from Jarrod Lawson and his band. As he is continuing his European Tour throughout November, all I will say is that those who are going to see him are in for a treat! And, if you missed him this time around, make sure you do not make the same mistake twice!\n\nThankyou once again Jarrod Lawson!\n\n10/10\n\nFor all information on Jarrod Lawson, his music, tours etc visit: https://www.jarrodlawson.com/\n\nWatch the official video ‘Be The Change’ https://youtu.be/o9_unJ41hMg"
