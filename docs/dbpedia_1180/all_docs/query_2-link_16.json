        "text": "The deal includes all recordings, publishing, and the back catalog from the So So Def label. As a part of the new venture, Dupri will take the new role as the creative director for Create Music Group. After serving as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of So So Def since its inception, Dupri will transition to chairman and founder. Bryan Patrick Franklin takes over as the new So So Def CEO, Variety reported.\n\nAccording to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution (AJC), at 19 years old, Dupri discovered the teenage hip-hop duo Kriss Kross, whose album “Totally Crossed Out” became a Billboard No. 1 hit.\n\nCreate Music Group founder and CEO Jonathan Strauss emphasized Dupri’s accomplishments in his statement on the deal, noting, “Jermaine has been one of the most successful and impactful forces in music for the last three decades,” per Variety.\n\nSo So Def Recordings’ last release was the 2018 “So So Def 25th Anniversary” album. So, Dupri is committed to discovering fresh sounds from new artists. The plan is to help the next generation of musicians and performers thrive.\n\n“I have been looking for a home for the entire So So Def brand so that I can continue what I started,” Dupri said to the outlet, while discussing the possibilities for the brand’s future.\n\nWith over 30 years of experience in the music business, the music executive is ready to step into a role that will place him at the center of the hip-hop world and extend So So Def’s reach."
