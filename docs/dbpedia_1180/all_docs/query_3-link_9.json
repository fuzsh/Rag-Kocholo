        "text": "Guess WHo’s Back?\n\nI recently decided to start updating this blog again. When I did it regularly, it gave me so much joy. My last post was on Prodigy’s passing. That was 6 years ago. So much has changed in my life since then. I’m a Registered Nurse now and I love what I do. I keep to myself these days though, so I don’t get to have meaningful discourse with others about the music and things that I love. So guess what? I’m going to do it right here!\n\nA couple of days ago, I came across this fire EP by Curren$y and Harry Fraud called “Vices.” It was actually Spotify that suggested it to me and I was not mad that I gave it a listen. I am low key obsessed with it now actually.\n\nCurren$y has a go-to aesthetic, and over the years he has fleshed it out on various projects. I have thoroughly enjoyed the ones helmed by Harry Fraud. And this one is no different. ‘Vices’ has an 80’s, Miami Vice feel to it and I absolutely love it. The first track is a jubilant introduction to the EP’s subject matter– cigarette boots used for drug trade in the Miami Harbor. Following the first track is “Black Point Boat Launch” which has a laid back, velvety smooth vibe to it.\n\nBut the stand out tracks to me are “Stingray (feat. Benny The Butcher)” and “Marcus Camby (feat. Jim Jones & Tommy Wright III). When I tell you these tracks have presence, they undeniably do! The beat on “Stingray” is top tier and has this impressive wailing lifted from the sampled track. I would love to hear what song was sampled. Benny’s verse is great! I love when he is featured on tracks because he NEVER slouches and his verses are always memorable. My only complaint was that this one was too short. It clocks in at only 2:07. “Marcus Camby” is incredibly satisfying. I really enjoy listening to it. It feels very lush and layered. Jim Jones spits a dope verse. He’s so consistent and versatile. Comfortable on any track. I could listen to this one on repeat for a very long time.\n\nI almost forgot about “Marble Columns (feat Larry June).” Another impressive beat featuring a hypnotic saxophone riff accompanied by the most soulful banging drums. I love listening to this in my car because the drums sound incredible! Larry June isn’t a rapper I’ve listened to recently but I did like his verse. I know he also has an album out produced by The Alchemist. I’m gonna give it a serious listen.\n\nI’m glad Curren$y continues to explore this concept and I am so grateful for Harry Fraud. He is fast becoming to me what the Alchemist is! GOAT status!\n\nRIP Prodigy!\n\n“Esoteric knowledge and I’m criminal minded. A lady’s wet dream and the devil’s worst nightmare.” – “Death Sentence” featuring Roc Marciano — ‘Albert Einstein.’\n\nI found out about Prodigy’s passing after scrolling through a blog I visit often — which is weird because Twitter is usually where I find out someone died. When I came to the post, I stared at the title incredulously, immediately overtaken by a wave of sadness. Not P! He was in the upper echelon of rappers. His voice and style were my favorite things about him. His ‘Albert Einstein’ LP is the project of his that I play the most. He was just so dope. I’m so tired of all the greats leaving us. First Sean Price a couple years ago, and now this. I’m deeply saddened and will miss him dearly.\n\nWhen Bae Disappoints: Do Better Freddie!\n\nIt’s no secret that I love Freddie Gibbs. Ever since stumbling across ‘Cold Day in Hell’ and ‘Baby Face Killa’ some years ago after many a conversation on Twitter, I’ve been a die hard fan. But these days my love affair with Freddie has cooled some. I never thought this would ever happen, but it has. He released a new album this April and the album cover totally rubbed me the wrong way. I get that he’s back home after his horrendous ordeal over in Europe, but I was a little perplexed and slightly enraged when I first saw his album artwork for his new album, ‘You Only Live 2wice.’\n\nI would post it here but I dislike the image so much that I don’t want to display it so prominently on here. Basically, he has taken the scene pictured below, and made it his own by inserting himself where Jesus is shown and adding in pictures of his crew and half naked women where the disciples appear.\n\nI had a really strong reaction to it when I first saw it on Spotify. My excitement at the fact that he’d released new music quickly faded when I took in the album artwork. My first thought was, “This is blasphemy,” and I was so disappointed that Freddie felt the need to go this route. Certain things are sacred and should not be tampered with, especially just for the purpose of selling music. I definitely think he went too far this time and I stopped listening to his music for almost a month because I believe in Jesus Christ and I feel something as meaningful and sacred as a depiction of his ascension into heaven should not be taken so lightly or desecrated so casually. Shame on you Freddie Gibbs. I know you thought you were just expressing yourself through art, but why couldn’t you have picked another scene to recreate? Why purport yourself as Jesus? That’s going way too far and I do not find it amusing at all.\n\nThe thing is… I love Freddie’s music. Well, everything he’s released up until this latest album. I went to see him in Boston last year and the show was spectacular! And to cap things off, I was able to go on stage and give him a hug. The whole thing was surreal and I was so glad I went to see him in Boston. About four days ago, I decided I’d drop my ban on his music. I really wanted to hear “White Range” so I played this Spotify playlist I made of all of my favorite songs of his as I was driving home from work. It was so satisfying. As I heard the songs, I realized how much I’d missed listening to his music. I tried listening to ‘You Only Live 2Wice’ today but I just couldn’t get into it. I felt weird playing it and I realized that there’s only one track on the album that I really dig. It’s called “Amnesia” and the beat is phenomenal. I added it to my playlist, and that’s probably the only song I’ll listen to on that project. I can’t wait until the project with MadLib is liberated!\n\nIn closing, I’ll always be a fan of Freddie Gibbs– but that doesn’t mean I condone everything he does. When news broke last year about the rape charges, I was crushed. Not Freddie! I didn’t think he was capable of doing that. I was so relieved when he was exonerated. There’s a program on VICE TV where he speaks with a therapist and describes being placed in a cell with other prisoners that had swastika tattoos while he was imprisoned in France. He told the man interviewing him that he didn’t deserve that, and my heart went out to him. No black man deserves that. I was thrilled when he was released. Something about his music really appeals to me. I’m always happy when I find an artist that I really connect with. It didn’t hurt that he was cool AF when I went to his show either.\n\nI really wish I could ask him what he was thinking with this album artwork though. I have yet to read any articles online about it, but I’m going to do some research. I really want to know what he was trying to achieve by doing this.\n\nBut in the meantime, I’ll still be over here being a fan and listening to my playlist until he releases something new–preferably with album artwork that doesn’t depict anymore religious scenes. I’m good on that, thanks.\n\nSurprise, Surprise…\n\nKobe plays his last game tonight against the Utah Jazz. So I thought it was fitting to re-up this post I did about him 6 years ago, when I decided that I didn’t want to hate him anymore. Love you Kobe! All the best to you and best wishes for a prosperous future!\n\nFeel My Hartbeat\n\nI like Kobe Bryant. I never thought those four words would ever come out of my mouth, but the impossible has happened. I decided a few weeks ago to end the constant hatred for him, and instead replace it with love.I’ve finally realized that there is something very special about him. I know I’m extremely late but I’m finally able to see that.\n\nPlus hating on him is getting old. And while hating, I couldn’t deny he was good…really good. I’d watch his heroics silently cursing him but all the while marveling at his undeniable skill. All of my, “Ooh I hate him” barbs are useless now, because I don’t hate him at all. I admire him and everything he’s been able to accomplish. I adore the way he is with his daughters whenever the media shows him in an intimate moment with his family.\n\n–104 victory against the…\n\nView original post 51 more words\n\nNew SMOKE DZA!!!! (He Has Risen)\n\nOne of the best things ever in life is unexpected new music from a favorite artist.\n\nI was using Spotify, as I am most days, because I had this deep urge to hear Smoke DZA’s first album. He’s totally become one of my favorite lyricists recently. (His swag is untouchable!)\n\nMy heart jumped when I noticed , “He Has Risen,” which was released a few weeks ago on March 4, on his profile page.\n\nContinue reading “New SMOKE DZA!!!! (He Has Risen)” →\n\nFour Albums You Should Listen to, If you haven’t\n\nHere is some music that I’ve been playing heavily lately. It isn’t especially current, or what is popular right now, but I’ve found that I’m happiest when I bypass whatever is on the radio and do my own thing.\n\nStarting things off is ‘Charlene’ by R&B veteran, Tweet.\n\nContinue reading “Four Albums You Should Listen to, If you haven’t” →\n\nI Didn’t Get Future’s Appeal\n\nWhy the excitement?\n\nI’ve been trying to listen to the entire Future album, ‘EVOL’ for a few weeks now, but I just can’t get into it. As someone who has a discerning ear and decent taste in music, I’ve realized that Future Hendrix just isn’t for me. And even though I am probably in the minority, it’s safe to say that I’ll never be a fan.\n\nI work with a guy who swears by Future. He’s in his mid twenties.\n\n“You gotta really listen to what he says,” he told me one day. I stared at him blankly. And then I told him that I did, and that I wasn’t impressed.\n\nIf you’re into bass-heavy Trap music, then he’s the way to go. But if you’re into music with more substance, avoid Future. Don’t even waste your time trying to convince yourself that he’s gifted.\n\n‘EVOL’ isn’t a solid album. It sounds like sh*t compared to Freddie Gibbs’,’Shadow of a Doubt.’ Gibbs’ flow makes whatever Future was attempting sound retarded. I kept listening for him to rap something noteworthy or remotely profound, but it never happened. And that auto-tune he insists on using is really awful. His fans still eat up his simple, brainless, brand of rap. I’m fairly sure most of them were born in the 90’s, have questionable taste in music and refuse to listen to 80’s and 90’s rap, totally oblivious to what quality sounds like, and resistant to anything other than what’s popular now. My coworker definitely falls into this category. When I asked him if he ever listens to Jay-Z, NaS or ‘Pac, he replied, “What for?” Really dude?\n\nI’ve decided that I’m not jumping on the Future bandwagon just to remain current. I am not going to bother trying to listen to someone who mumbles nonsensical phrases in annoying monotone for longer than a few minutes….if that. I tried being open minded, but I think Future is just a fad rapper and I can’t wait until he fades into obscurity. #sorrynotsorry\n\nUpdate:\n\nDespite me being extra hard on Future, I have identified several tracks on ‘EVOL’ that I actually like…namely “Seven Rings” and a couple others. I don’t hate Future. I just didn’t understand why there was so much hoopla surrounding him when I felt his music wasn’t really that noteworthy. I’ve since gone back through his catalog and I must admit that I do enjoy his ‘Honest’ album. I guess with more time, he will grow on me. And I think I had such a strong reaction to this ‘EVOL’ album that first time because someone I now don’t care for swears by Future. Passing all of that judgment probably wasn’t the wisest thing to do, and I now see the error of my ways. I’ll let Future live….\n\nThe Sean Price Tribute at SOBs\n\nIt’s been a little over a week since I went to NYC to attend the tribute for Sean Price at SOBs on August 27, 2015. The show was amazing and I had a great time vibing to Sean P’s music and enjoying the performers who came through. Here are a few of the pictures that I took.\n\nI also took a bunch of video but because I was so close to the speakers at the front of the stage, they don’t have any sound. 😦\n\nContinue reading “The Sean Price Tribute at SOBs” →\n\nIn Memoriam: Sean Price\n\nI came across this Sean “P” Memorial mix on YouTube earlier today. It clocks in at around 30-minutes and features some of his best, most innovative videos expertly blended into a heart-stirring retrospect. I watched this video in total awe, mesmerized by his commanding presence and astounding talent. What a complete and utter shame that he is gone. He will definitely not be forgotten.\n\nThis is a must see for any “P” fan.\n\nProps to DJ Irie for putting it together.\n\nWe Lost Another Great: Rest In Power Sean Price\n\nSean Price, aka Ruck (of Heltah Skeltah) passed away on August 8th 2015.\n\nI had the chance to say hello to him before he performed at the 2007 Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival. His humility and willingness to interact with his fans blew me away. I’ll admit that over the years, I wasn’t as diligent with keeping up with his projects as I have been with others, but I at least made it a point to download whatever mixtape he released (ie. ‘Kimbo Price’).\n\nLately, I have this burning desire to hear his music. To catch up on what I’ve unintentionally missed over the years. I’ve been listening to his ‘Mic Tyson‘ LP over and over. It sounds better than I remember. The beats are well-crafted and satisfyingly robust; the perfect compliment to his razor sharp rhymes. Revisiting “Monkey Barz” and his other albums again will be fun. And I’m waiting in anticipation to check out his latest effort, “Songs in the Key of Price,” which will be available on August 21st. He left behind a solid body of work.\n\nSean P was an exceedingly gifted lyricist and he’ll be sorely missed. Not only by me, but also his industry comrades who had the utmost respect for him, and the countless lovers of his brand of gully east coast rap.\n\nIt’s a shame that the great ones receive all the accolades once they’re no longer here. He should have been way more celebrated when he was around to appreciate it.\n\nR.I.P. Ruck.\n\n-MM\n\nAudio Dope: “Diamonds” x Freddie Gibbs\n\nI have a serious thing for Freddie Gibbs. I don’t even know if “thing” is the right word to describe it. It’s more like a really, really intense obsession. His music appeals to my inner thug so I squealed with delight when I discovered his ‘Pronto’ EP on Spotify last night. I’m a bit late though. It was released in early March. But you know what they say; better late than never! I had been searching for the “BFK” video on Youtube because I need that visual sometimes. And then, I came across the audio for “Diamonds”, the third track on the EP. It has been on repeat since I heard it last night…no lie. I’m probably on listen number 1000 by now. It really is that mesmerizing! DZA used the same sample for his “Personal Party” track on ‘Rolling Stoned’ but this track utilizes it better! Experience the magnificence below.\n\nI Like Taking Pictures: Ghost in red + Rakim too\n\n“Medallions the size of dinner plates…..”\n\nCame across these while scrolling through my forgotten Flickr page the other day. This show was in November 2007 at Roseland Ballroom in NYC. Rakim also performed.\n\nNotes on “Mr Wonderful” -Action Bronson’s First Studio Album\n\nYes. This is about Action Bronson. And yes, I know that a few posts ago, I didn’t mince words about about what a significant asshole I feel he was for making his “Brunch” video, in which he nauseatingly glorifies violence against women with zero remorse. I am willing to admit that I may have gone a little too far condemning him. I’ve had some time to think about it, and there’s no denying his talent, which is why I’m lifting my ban on his music.\n\nI have a confession to make. Even after writing that post, I was listening to his music copiously… (The “Saab Stories” EP specifically.) I absolutely love ‘Triple Back Flip’ (produced by Harry Fraud). Despite my displeasure with Action Bronson, my excitement began building the moment I heard he was releasing his first LP this year. I was convinced that the release date was March 17th. You should have seen me joyfully typing the album title into the Spotify search screen only to be crushed when I realized I had another week of waiting. Lol. I was even seriously contemplating taking the three hour Amtrak ride to NYC on the 23rd for his album release party at SOBs. All of this from someone who once declared Action Bronson to be a cheap Ghostface imitator. Oh how the tables have turned.\n\nContinue reading “Notes on “Mr Wonderful” -Action Bronson’s First Studio Album” →\n\nThe Solution\n\nYou ever think you know what a word means, and then realize that the actual meaning of that word is totally not the meaning you had in mind? I decided today that I was going to start referring to myself as an “audiophile.” I always thought it sounded cool and was a term used to describe someone completely obsessed with music and high quality sounding audio. To be on the safe side, I hit up google and saw this definition:\n\nA person who is especially interested in high fidelity sound reproduction.\n\nWell, ok then. Not quite what I was thinking. So maybe “music junkie” is a better term to describe me. Supposedly it means a person who explores the many different genres of music; constantly listening, downloading,and researching new bands. Yes. This is me.\n\nSo being the music junkie that I am, I am constantly searching for ways to experience the best quality sound when I listen to the music I love at home. I’ve fallen in love with Bose audio over the years, but realized that Bose is better suited for classical music or live concert recordings than say, rap. I love my rap and hip hop and I love hearing a pounding bass line. I gotta have that bass.\n\nContinue reading “The Solution” →\n\nAudio Dope: “Me, Liquor and God” by Night Beds\n\nI decided I needed to mix things up a bit concerning my music preferences a couple of months ago. Being the creature of habit that I am, I usually listen to the same music day in and day out. I know you know what I’m talking about; pressing play, day after day on your go-to playlists with those “tried and true” tracks that you love but won’t admit to yourself that you’re tired of. Yup.\n\nOn this particular day, I took to Spotify (which is probably my favorite thing ever) to discover something new. I came across an Indie playlist and heard, “Me, Liquor and God” by Night Beds. My life changed forever when I heard it. No freaking lie. And there hasn’t been a day since that I haven’t listened to it at least once!\n\nI don’t know much about Night Beds but I swear (on everything I love) that this track is PERFECTION; complete and utter flawlessness. It’s that type of song you think about when it’s not playing. I’m convinced it has transportive qualities. The music is like velvet, and the lyrics are heartfelt and real. There’s a lot more to be said about how great this song is, but I’ll spare you. You’re just going to have to take my word for it, and listen for yourself.\n\nI am all the way hooked. I’m talking, ‘playing it on repeat for hours and hours and hours’ hooked. Every time I listen to it, it feels like I’m hearing it for the first time and I’m not sure if I’ll ever get tired of it.\n\nNight Beds has a new album out called ‘Country Sleep.’ (pictured above)\n\n‘Country Sleep’ is on Spotify! I’ve listened to it a few times, and I really like it.\n\nIt doesn’t include “Me, Liquor and God” but it contains plenty of other satisfying, super dope tracks.\n\nNight Beds is in line to become my new St Vincent; that one band/singer whose music I take the time to research, slowly digest and savor because I connect with it strongly for some reason.\n\nGive this track and the album a listen. I dare you not to like it!\n\n-M\n\nThey Have My Heart…\n\nWonder what this says about me?\n\nHopefully, that I like talented beat makers.\n\nAlchemist’s beats always rub me the right way. They’re always elegant, endlessly thoughtful and tinged with a sinister, haunting quality, which I live for. Basically, I really love his stuff.\n\nThere’s isn’t much to say about Dilla that hasn’t already been said. He was amazing at crafting the most spine-tingling and wildly satisfying beats…ever. My favorites are the tracks he did for Ghostface’s ‘Fishscale’, and of course the ones that compile his much-lauded, ‘Donuts.’\n\nMadlib won my heart a while ago with the DOOM assisted ‘Mad Villainy’, but when I heard Freddie Gibb’s ‘Pinata’, my heart just opened up to him. His beats are not only innovative, but also very polished and distinguished.\n\nI’ll always love MF DOOM and his 50 trillion aliases. He has a knack for crafting robust, vintage sounding, buss your shit open beats.\n\nAnd 9th wonder is a skilled purveyor of all audio that is crack. I love his expansive discography and all that he has accomplished in his career so far.\n\nSkibeatz and Harry Fraud have worked with some of my favorite rap newbies like Curren$y and Smoke DZA and made some beautiful music recently.\n\nWhich producers are your favorite?\n\nLet me know in the comments.\n\n-MM\n\nThrowback: My 25 most played in 2011…\n\nApparently I was really feeling weed rap when I took this screen grab in 2011. Curren$y’s “Pilot Talk” album had me fixated. I found it perplexing that I connected so much with his music even though I’ve never smoked weed a day in my life. The album was phenomenal though, consisting of an innovative concept, intricate flows and sophisticated beats. There isn’t much that was missing. Initially I found Curren$y’s voice slightly irritating, but everything changed when I heard “King Kong,” which weighs in at number 2 in my most played. That dangerous Ski beat was the reason I listened to it on repeat for days. I’d never heard a more satisfying beat and it still stops me in my tracks today.\n\nI was also loving Smoke DZA’s “George Kush Da Button” album. I didn’t fully understand the title but it was a very satisfying listen. DZA has a distinct drawl and a swaggy persona that I ate right up. This album and it’s accompanying videos cemented my desire to see him live in concert.\n\nThere are also a few tracks by N.E.R.D. in my most played too. They’ll always be my favorite band. I loved that Nothing album.\n\n2015 Update:\n\nI no longer use iTunes for music. Instead I prefer Spotify but they don’t do a most played. If they did, you’d probably find lots of Ghostface Killah, Freddie Gibbs, Mobb Deep and Sean Price on there.\n\n-MM\n\nDOPE: Black Milk’s, “If There’s a Hell Below”\n\nReleased 10/28/14.\n\nIn a word: AMAZING!\n\nStill digesting and I’m loving what I’m hearing.\n\n-MM\n\nCurrent fixation: St Vincent\n\nI’ve been listening to a lot of St Vincent lately. I discovered her in 2012 and fell in love with her 3rd album entitled “Strange Mercy.’ Her real name is Annie Clark and she’s an excellent guitarist and a dope vocalist. I really dig her music, which can be classified as “indie pop” or “baroque pop.” She released her 4th album, ‘St Vincent‘ last year. It also goes hard, but of her four albums, I like ‘Strange Mercy’ the best. The lyrics to her songs are sometimes very dark but always unexpected. I really like ‘Strange Mercy’ because it has a very lush sound that captivates after the first listen.\n\nHere’s a video of Annie in 2011 performing ‘Cruel’, one of my favorites from her “Strange Mercy” album at KCRW studios. This video is cool because you get to see her playing the guitar live. It’s obvious that she is a very skilled musician as well as a cool artist. She also sounds just like her tracks when she sings live. Enjoy!\n\nAnd here’s a taste of what she sounds like now. This is audio of ‘Prince Johnny’ from her self titled 4th album. I was obsessed with this song the first time I heard it. So freakin’ dope!\n\nUpdated: Reviewing Ghostface Killah’s discography\n\nGhostface Killah is my favorite artist and rapper of all time, and in the wake of attending my 7th concert, I decided to take a trip down memory lane to reflect on and review his extensive discography.\n\nFirst up is:\n\nIronman (1996)\n\nContinue reading “Updated: Reviewing Ghostface Killah’s discography” →\n\nReally, Action Bronson?\n\nAction Bronson, you almost had me. I was on the brink of being lured in by your sounds. I was about to fall hard for you. But then I saw that disgusting “Brunch” video of yours on YouTube. You know the one where you hurl all sorts of profanities and insults at a dead girl and then dump her into the ocean after rolling her body into a rug. It was truly grotesque and removed any desire I may have had to get to know you better.\n\nTo be honest, I was looking to you to fill a void. My favorite rapper hasn’t released new music in a while and you sound eerily like him. But here’s what’s obvious; you will never be Ghostface. I don’t care how much you sound like him. He would never make a video disrespecting woman to the degree that you did. Not even at his lowest.\n\nThe “Brunch” video really rubbed me the wrong way. I don’t care if it was a metaphor or an over-exaggeration of a bad breakup, it was in poor taste.\n\nLet me back up though. Let me not assume that everyone knows who Action Bronson is. Action Bronson is an American rapper from Flushing Queens who wasn’t really on my radar until now. My step brother was a big fan of his and shared some of his music with me last year, namely ‘Rare Chandeliers,’ produced by Alchemist and ‘Well Done,’ produced by Statik Selektah. For some reason, I wasn’t receptive to his music before. I recently thought I was ready to embrace it wholeheartedly, but the “Brunch” video has me thinking otherwise. I get the whole artistic expression thing, but sometimes you can take it a little too far. What’s unfortunate is that I was really starting to like his bold delivery and irreverent lyrics. I was even willing to look past the fact that lyrically he’s a Ghostface clone. And his voice was just starting to excite me. Not to mention I was also digging the way he handled himself on beats by Alchemist. ‘Rare Chandeliers’ is dope. I can’t front. Bronson rhymes the way I wish Ghostface still did. But… it’s too late. I’ll never look at him the same ever again. I have no desire to get into his music anymore. I’m moving on. I’ll stick with the original. The End.\n\n-MM\n\nWhat I’m Listening to Right Now\n\nI just made a dope little Spotify playlist from eight songs that appear on these two projects.\n\nI hadn’t listened to them both until recently and I’m not really sure why it took me so long to hear them. Anyway, these tracks that I’ve mentioned below go VERY hard…\n\n1) “Death Sentence” – Prodigy x Alchemist feat. Roc Marciano– from The Albert Einstein project\n\nProdigy’s deep-voiced cadences complement the understated Alchemist beat perfectly. An assist from Roc Marciano ups the dopeness factor and makes this song a bonafide standout.\n\n2) “Dough Pildin” – Prodigy x Alchemist – from The Albert Einstein project\n\nThis track has the type of Alchemist beat that I live for; subtle and beautifully crafted. Prodigy spits his usual philosophical braggadocio making this another win win.\n\n3) “Breeze” – Prodigy x Alchemist – from The Albert Einstein project\n\nThis is my favorite track on the ‘Albert Einstein’ project. The beat is impossibly smooth and P’s flow is incredible. He effortlessly rides the beat and unloads quotable after quotable. I can picture myself lying on a beach somewhere warm listening to this. This track is laid back perfection.\n\n4) “Raw Forever” – Prodigy x Alchemist – from The Albert Einstein project\n\nI chose this track because I like the way the beat constantly changes up. This is a classic feel good track that leaves me happy after every listen.\n\n5) “Say My Name” – Prodigy x Alchemist – from The Albert Einstein project\n\nThis beat sounds so amazing to me. P’s lyrics are first rate as usual. This is the kind of sonic gem that I could memorize word for word.\n\n6) “Triple Backflip” – Action Bronson – from ‘Saab Stories’ produced by Harry Fraud\n\nThis song was my first real introduction to Action Bronson and I gotta say, I really liked it after that first listen. Harry Fraud is obviously no slouch in the production department. The beat sounds very opulent and inviting.\n\n7) “The Rockers” – Action Bronson feat. Wiz Khalifa – from ‘Saab Stories’ produced by Harry Fraud\n\nI liked this beat as soon as I heard it. It sounds like it should be featured on a, “for the ladies” type of track but Action Bronson eschews the formulaic subject matter and raps about something entirely different. And it works.\n\n8) “Seven Series Triplets” – Action Bronson feat. Prodigy and Raekwon – from ‘Saab Stories’ produced by Harry Fraud\n\nThe beat on this track reminds me of one Ghostface might have used on ‘Fishscale’ or ‘Bulletproof Wallets’. It has a somber, appealing quality to it and the guest rappers Prodigy and Raekwon, really bring out the beauty of the beat.\n\nHartbeat Fave: Phyllis Hyman\n\nPhyllis Hyman was an incredible singer-songwriter who was the epitome of elegance, confidence and style while she was alive. One of my favorite recordings by her is “Complete Me” which appeared on her well received 1979 album, “You Know How to Love Me.” I purchased this album on a whim around 2000, and I’ve never once regretted it.\n\nShe was a wildly talented artist and possessed a captivating voice imbued with quiet sophistication and a unique richness. She also never sang without copious amounts of passion and emotion. She will forever be one of my favorite singers. Following are some of my all-time images of her, as well as a YouTube video of “Complete Me”.\n\n-MM\n\nThis shot was the cover of the “You Know How to Love Me” album.\n\nShe had amazing style…\n\nSnapshot\n\nHome Base. Hartford, CT.\n\n-MM\n\nGood Reads\n\nI’m reading again! When I was in school a month ago, it was difficult for me to read recreationally. But now that I’m out, it’s on! I’ve recently been reading several books about Hip-Hop. Since I love it so much, I figured I should know more about its history.\n\nI started with Bakari Kitwana’s “The Hip Hop Generation”\n\nIt was a good read. Bakara Kitwana refers to the hip hop generation as those born between 1965 and 1984. It wasn’t much of a history of Hip Hop as I had hoped but in it, he makes clear arguments about what has affected Black youth over the last twenty years and offers up solutions. I had bought this book years ago (maybe in 2003 or so) intending to read it right away but never did. It felt good to finally finish it.\n\nAfter reading that book, I decided I wanted to read a history of Hip Hop, so I started Jeff Chang’s “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop; A History of the Hip Hop Generation”.\n\nI am really enjoying it so far. The author has a brilliant way with words and paints vivid pictures about Hip Hop’s humble beginnings leading up to today. It’s the kind of book you don’t want to put down because it is so riveting. I’m half way through it. I almost wish Kitwana had used the same language to write the “Hip Hop Generation” because I’m sure I would have enjoyed it more. But I guess the subject matter didn’t really lend to that.\n\nNext, I read M. K. Asante’s “It’s Bigger than Hip Hop – The Rise of Post Hip Hop Generation”\n\nI’d been reading all about the “Hip Hop Generation” and wanted to read about the “Post Hip Hop Generation” which follows as well. It was a decent book. The author is a young activist and is a professor at Morgan State. He “uses hip hop as a springboard for a larger discussion about the urgent social and political issues affecting the post-hip-hop generation, a new wave of youth searching for an understanding of itself outside the self-destructive, corporate hip-hop monopoly.” In it, he has an interview with Dead Prez. I’m supposing that he got the name of his book from their song. He also interviews Hip Hop itself. It was a well-written book and I’ll probably read it again.\n\nAnd last but not least, I just finished John H McWhorter’s, “All About the Beat: Why Hip Hop Can’t Save Black America”\n\nI happened to come across this book while browsing for other books about Hip Hop online. Written in 2008, McWhorter asserts in this book that Hip Hop doesn’t have the potential to foster a revolution of positive change in the lives of black people. I didn’t know how to feel when I read this, especially when I had held the belief that hip-hop was so great and powerful and such a strong, prevailing force in my life. McWhorter smashes the claims that hip-hop is politically valuable because it delivers the only “real” portrayal of black society. He points out that hip-hop is, at its core, simply music, and takes issue with those who celebrate hip-hop as the beginning of a new civil rights program and inflate the lyrics. While reading, I found myself jotting down notes and agreeing with quite a bit of what he wrote. Yes, sermonizing rather than working on the problems is not the answer. We really do need to “translate hipness into action and activism”. It was short, but sweet. And it was refreshing to read a book written by someone on the other side of the argument. McWhorter dislikes the term “Hip Hop Generation” and thinks history is not on the side of revolution now. Some key notes:\n\n– “Snapping our necks to beats and rhymes will have no effect on what happens in the congressional chamber”\n\n– “The seduction of rhythm is indeed much of why so many people entertain the prospect of a revolution based on rap music.”\n\n– “Rhythm is deeply seductive. Even babies like it.”\n\n-“Black people need to get beyond the idea that something is true because it is expressed in infectious rhythm.”\n\n– “The idea that rhythm and inflection constitute coherent political insight worthy of extended attention is wrong.”\n\n– “Words, sentences, logical connections, and constructive thought will be our salvation. Mysticism will not – even if it’s set to a great rhythm track.”\n\n-“The beat is not truth”\n\n-“In being art, especially popular art, hip-hop is automatically disqualified from being meaningfully political”\n\n-“Anyone who says hip-hop is dead is being theatrical and seeking attention”\n\n– “A revolution does not consist solely of howling grievances”\n\n-“The fact that our ancestors were brought here as slaves and endured Jim Crow does not arouse people anymore.”\n\nNow that I have a working knowledge of Hip Hop history, I think I’ll delve into Black history some more. There’s a book that I had to read for an African Studies class at Drexel called “Black Intellectuals” by William M Banks that I’ve always wanted to re-read. And there is one on the Civil Rights Movement called “Freedom Bound – A History of America’s Civil Rights Movement” by Robert Weisbrot that looks interesting as well. Following those, I will probably begin “We Are Not What We Seem: Black Nationalism and Class Struggle in the American Century” by Rod Bush. Reading is dope.\n\n-MM\n\nVideo – Stalley feat. Rick Ross “Lincoln Way Nights (Shop Remix)”\n\nI’ve been flirting with the idea of wholeheartedly throwing my support behind Stalley for a little while. I enjoyed his ‘Lincoln Way Nights’ mixtape and was thrilled when I came across this video for the “Shop Remix” today. The jury is still out on whether or not I will continue to listen to his music. Either way, I thought this deserved a post.\n\nThis is a pretty dope track! I REALLY dig when producers interpolate classical music into beats. Makes it so elegant. Definitely up my alley…\n\n-MM\n\nTHE UCONN HUSKIES ARE THE 2011 NCAA TOURNAMENT CHAMPS!\n\nTwo nights ago the University of Connecticut Huskies defeated the Butler Bulldogs 53-41 to win the NCAA Tournament! The win meant a lot to me since I’m a Connecticut resident.\n\n-MM\n\nSoundtrack to Life\n\nWhat if we all had a soundtrack to our lives, that always played, as if we were in a movie? Like say… if we got a promotion or met the man or woman of our dreams then a song on our soundtrack would play all by itself, making that moment that much more special? Yeah, that would be pretty nice.\n\nSince I love music and I sometimes want to hear it 24 hours a day, I love the idea of having a perfect soundtrack to life.\n\nHere is the 15 track soundtrack that I would want playing at special moments in the movie of my life . (I’ve selected classic R&B, hip hop and jazz songs so that I won’t get tired of them anytime soon.)\n\n1) “Complete Me” – Phyllis Hyman\n\nListen\n\n2) “Camay” – Ghostface Killah\n\nListen\n\n3) “Freakin you Remix” – Jodeci featuring Raekwon, Cappadonna and Ghostface Listen\n\n4) “What’s Beef” – Notorious B.I.G.\n\nListen\n\n5) “Picture me Rollin” – Tupac Listen\n\n6) “Regrets” – Jay-Z Listen\n\n7) “You’re da Man” – NaS Listen\n\n.8) “Going in Circles” – Isaac Hayes Listen\n\n9) “Provider” – N*E*R*D Listen\n\n10) “Can I Kick it” – A Tribe Called Quest Listen\n\n11) “The Sweetest Thing” – Lauryn Hill\n\nListen\n\n12) “Come Over” – Faith Evans Listen\n\n13) “Ragu” – Ghostface Killah\n\nListen\n\n14) “Blue in Green” – Miles Davis (For when a good jazz song is necessary) Listen\n\n15) “No Detour” – Sarah Vaughan/Ella Fitzgerald Listen\n\nMARCH MADNESS Got me Like….\n\nGo Team!\n\n-MM\n\nEven happier\n\nThis photo was taken today, March 9th, 2011, the anniversary of Biggie’s death. As we get closer and closer to the NCAA tournament and March Madness, my smile is going to get bigger and bigger.\n\nHappy because it’s looking good for Uconn, and of course Duke. Going to fill out my brackets in the next few days. I can’t wait for the tournament to start!!!\n\n-MM\n\nSKETCHY\n\nI like sketching in my free time. It helps me use what I learned when pursuing my Fashion Design degree at the Fashion Institute of Technology a few years ago.\n\n–MM\n\nOne moment in time\n\nBelow is an image from the night I went up on stage while Ghostface Killah performed at BB Kings in October 2005. This moment in time is significant because I got to briefly dance with my favorite recording artist of all time!\n\nThere was a YouTube video of the moment floating around but the user has since made it private. It appears on the ‘Ghostface Live in New York’ DVD as well.\n\nOh what a night! I was ridiculously happy to dance with him because I love him and his music very, very much!\n\n-MM\n\nI like taking pictures: Black August 2006\n\nI took these a few years ago at the Black August Concert at Nokia theatre in NYC. I really enjoyed seeing acts like Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli and Saigon perform. Check out a few pics before.\n\nI like taking pictures: CELTICS LOVE!\n\nI love my squad. Here’s another pic I took of Rondo, Garnett and “Perk” a couple years ago. I miss Perkins already 😦\n\nupdating intermittently to add more pics.\n\nLove this one. Ray Allen is the man!\n\n-MM\n\nthe realest…..\n\nI can’t even get into how I feel about this.\n\nno words…NONE!\n\n-MM\n\nG Unit Classic!\n\n“Ma..you make me feel good..”\n\nguilty pleasure\n\n-MM\n\nHartfelt Video: “The Sweetest Thing” by Lauryn Hill\n\nMy favorite song of all times.\n\nAnd I’m completely serious.\n\n-MM\n\nIt makes perfect sense\n\nsolitude is the best.\n\n-MM\n\n“There’s no love to be found”\n\n“How can we make love if you don’t love me?”\n\nErykah at Orpheum (Boston) last June.\n\n(my poor heart)\n\n-MM\n\nWants…\n\n^digging all of the above\n\n-MM\n\nI like taking pictures\n\nThis one is from 2 years ago. Bosh was still a Raptor then.\n\nProbably the best picture I’ve ever taken.\n\n“And I don’t need no hook for this shit”….\n\n-MM\n\nJoe Budden: Master Storyteller?\n\nOk, so let’s recap. We already know Nas, Big, Jay-Z and Ghostface top the Exceptional Story-teller list. (Well…….mine atleast) But what about Joe Budden? Can we add him to the list too?\n\nI asked myself these questions upon revisiting a track on his Mood Muzik 2 mixtape entitled, “Three Sides to a Story“. On this particular track, Joe spins a riveting tale from three different perspectives.\n\nIn the first verse he describes the life of a young man, named Derek, whose life is riddled with drama. Derek is in and out of jail and lives a hard life and no matter what he does he always finds himself in a f*cked up situation. Derek’s sister Sally is the focus of the second verse. She is molested by her mother’s boyfriend but her big brother Derek is in jail, so he cannot help her. It is difficult to hear Joe recount her tale and even though it brings a bad feeling, you can’t help but continue to listen. He uses simple language to paint a vivid picture of anguish, horror and sexual molestation.You can imagine what this girl must have gone through and envision the pain she must have endured. Joe uses just the right words to get his point across and transport you right to the scenes he so expertly describes. This is characteristic of an extremely effective story-teller.\n\nThe third perspective is the culmination of this sad story. It is told from the stepfather “Bo”‘s perspective. I wont ruin it by telling you what happens but let’s just say that the ending is not a happy one.\n\nWith this track Joe Budden proves he can hang with the big dogs. I was always aware of his talent for grittier, more street infused rhymes but he also has a knack for the quieter, true-to-life soliloquies as well. With that said, I definitely feel that Joe Budden belongs up there with Nas, Jay, Big and Ghostface as a “Master story-teller”. And yes I’m basing that off just this one song, and I hope he makes many more like it.\n\nIf you haven’t heard the song, you can listen to it on good old YouTube!\n\nKnow anymore Joe Budden songs that are a better example of his excellent story telling ability? leave a comment!\n\nRELATED POST: Who’s The Best Storyteller: Biggie, Jay-Z or NaS?\n\nHARTBEAT FLASHBACK: VIDEO -Tupac “Keep ya Head Up”\n\nYou ever come across a song that you just have to stop and listen to whenever it comes on….no matter what you’re doing or where you are? Tupac’s “Keep ya Head up” is one of those songs for me.\n\nThis song started my love affair with Hip Hop in 1993. I remember seeing this video at age 12, four or five months after moving to this country from Jamaica. It had a profound impact on me and I fell in love with Tupac immediately after. This song had a very positive, wholesome message which did a lot to challenge what the grownups in my life claimed Hip Hop was all about and from that first viewing of the video, I was hooked. I began to listen to more Hip Hop and purchase his music as a result. I would soon realize that not all his music was as uplifting as “Keep ya Head up“, but I loved him just the same.\n\nThis song showed Tupac’s softer side but before long I was introduced to the more volatile, angry side which I loved as well. Tupac always had an important message to share and I always tuned in to hear it. My mother hated him because he was always in the news (remember? and not in a good way) and I remember she hid my “Don Kiluminati:The Seven day Theory” and “R U Still Down” cds because of this. It didn’t matter to me though. I always found a way to replace them.\n\nTupac inhabits position #3 on my greatest emcees of all time list. His music will always appeal to me and this song will always be one of my special favorites. Here’s the video:\n\nBonus video if you read the rest….\n\nContinue reading “HARTBEAT FLASHBACK: VIDEO -Tupac “Keep ya Head Up”” →\n\nFlashback: VIDEO – N.E.R.D – “Provider”\n\nWe all need flashbacks every now and then. But only the good kind.\n\nHere’s a GREAT one for you. Remember N.E.R.D’s 2002 “In Search of” album? The monster debut by Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo and Shay Haley?\n\nIf you don’t, here’s a reminder:\n\nIs it coming back to you yet?\n\nThere is a song on the album called “Provider“. It isn’t as well known as “Lapdance” or “Rockstar”, but for good reason. This track is for those die hard N.E.R.D fans who can appreciate an alternative sound. It won’t be everybody’s cup of tea, but I really enjoy this heartfelt ode to selling drugs and dealing with hard times.\n\nCheck it out!\n\nPharrell looks yummy in this video. Bird chest and all…lol\n\nAnd Too bad there’s no video for another album cut, “Bobby James”<—-(click me). That song is crazy dope!\n\nBonus: “That Girl” – Pharrell\n\nI adore this song!\n\nThe Ubiquitous Hip-Hop Accessory: The “Jesus Piece”\n\nThe “Jesus piece” has long been regarded as one of Hip Hop’s most beloved accoutrements.\n\nIt is an oversized platinum, gold or silver pendant, made in the likeness of Jesus, sometimes encrusted with diamonds and other gems . Worn on a heavy rope style chain, these pendants have been a staple of Hip Hop youth culture for nearly thirty years. (from Urban Dictionary.com)\n\nI am not exactly certain who originated this popular adornment. Kanye West would probably argue that he made the “Jesus piece” popular but I believe that the real honor should go to the Notorious BIG, who was seen wearing one in the popular image below.\n\n“Cubans with the Jesus Piece” – The Notorious BIG (Hypnotize)\n\nIn recent years, rappers like Kanye West, Jay-Z and Kid Cudi have championed the ‘Jesus Piece movement’ by wearing these pendants embedded with colored and black diamonds and precious stones. Styles made from lighter wood have also been popularized by Kanye West, Jadakiss, LeBron James, Braylon Edwards and even Pau Gasol. Here is a Jesus Piece gallery with a few items ranging from beautiful to seriously hideous:\n\nKanye’s piece not, shining as brightly.There is something extremely gaudy about it…but hey, I’m not a famous rapper. What do I know?\n\nKanye’s Murakami Jesus Piece pictured above…(Pretty cool, eh?)\n\nJay-Z’s is some sort of burnished metal.\n\nThe “all black everything” Jesus piece\n\nKid Cudi’s looks exactly like Kanye’s. Maybe he borrowed it??\n\nThis one (above) is quite bizarre. Who would wear this?\n\nMore of the people who wear them\n\nWhat’s notable is that most times the wearer isn’t even making a statement about any religious beliefs, just simply wearing one to be fashionable. And don’t expect this trendy fashion statement to go anywhere anytime soon either. With the affordable wood version more accessible than the costly precious metal and stones version, these pendants will be around for years to come…or as soon as this fad burns out. And of course fake Jesus pieces abound as well. With the “Jesus Piece” branded as a classic, just like the cuban link chain now everyone can dress just like their favorite rapper or athlete…used to?\n\nJust found this interesting piece…. right here that claims the Jesus Piece is dead. But I don’t think that’s necessarily true. I think it’s a classic and classics never die. It might go into remission for a while. But it will not die.\n\nAnd just in case you were wondering what the point of this post was….I just always wondered about Jesus Pieces and who wore them besides Kanye West. Apparently not too many people still do. My Google search was futile. I guess Kanye is now sole owner of this trend, but it looks like he’s retired his Jesus Piece for this ridiculous hunk of metal. Oh well…long live the Jesus piece!\n\nJust for fun: Check out the dudes from ‘It’s the Real’ in “Jews for Jesus Piece”\n\nFLASHBACK…(VIDEO: Saigon “Gotta Believe it)\n\nBecause I am perpetually late, I just realized that Saigon had a video for his monster single “Believe it”. I definitely need to spend more time on Youtube.\n\nThis one was posted up September 2009. Atleast it only took me a year to find it…lol\n\nSo for archival purposes…and mainly for my own viewing pleasure, I present you…..”Gotta Believe it” by Saigon\n\nSuper Throwback! – (VIDEO: “Spaceship” – Kanye West feat. Consequence + GLC)\n\nWell would you look at that?\n\nI didn’t even know there was a video for “Spaceship” by Kanye West, GLC and Consequence until today, August 28, 2010. The album was released February 10, 2004!! I need a tremendous late pass!\n\nNot sure how I missed this one. But now I have a deep feeling of closure. I feel satisfied having seen this video. The song is brilliant and finally having the visuals to go along with it is really fantastic.\n\nThis video rocks!\n\nFurther proof that I am always late – (VIDEO: “Disperse” – Consequence + friends)\n\nThis Consequence video for “Disperse” was uploaded on July 29, 2008.\n\n2008!!!\n\nAnd I am just seeing it for the first time today. This is is my absolute favorite track off Consequence’s 2007 classic album, “Don’t quit your day job” and just in case you cared, It contains a sample from this track\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWell…now that my initial excitement has worn off, I can say without hesitation that this video sucked. I was expecting more. In the video’s defense, it went along with the song but it also looked really low budget. I could have done without Lupe Fiasco being shown dancing around all crazy every 3 seconds, even though he did have some shining moments. I don’t know though. I guess Consequence was trying to save money. The video was definitely an injustice to the song. And that’s all I have to say about that.\n\nMy dilemma…\n\nSo I just noticed today that I’ve been fixating on the same music as the years go by. I just checked out a post I did 3 years ago and I’m STILL listening to almost all the same songs I wrote about then, today. This has to stop\n\nMy taste in music hasn’t really evolved at all in the past 10 years. I still like and listen to all the same old songs. The problem is that I haven’t heard any new songs recently that have moved me. Maybe the production just isn’t as good as it was in the past? I know one things for sure though. I can’t keep listening to the same albums like “Diplomatic Immunity” and “Supreme Clientele” all the damn time! I need some new music to become obsessed with!\n\nRecently, I got excited listening to Wiz Khalifa. I liked his style and the beats he used on his “Kush & Orange Juice” mixtape. I purchased his “Deal or No Deal” album on iTunes and I listen to it a lot. This was my first attempt at staying current.\n\nNow I want to check out Curren$y. I’m not 100% sold on him as an emcee though. I find his voice…well…a teeny tiny bit annoying, but I previewed the album (well, I heard all the 30 second clips of the album) and it sounds like something I might like. Going to buy it.\n\nBefore I go any further…I gave Fat Joe’s “The Darkside” and Rick Ross’ “Teflon Don” a chance too but didn’t come away with much. This was my second attempt at staying current. I liked “Free Mason” and “Maybach Music 3” on ‘Teflon Don’ but nothing stood out to me on Fat Joe’s album. And that is probably going to be it for me and mainstream Hip Hop for a while. I find the albums to be uninspired, boring and contrived. And then I have this thing about not listening to music if I don’t like the artist’s voice… which is why I avoid Lil’ Wayne and TI like the plague. The only mainstream artists who I’ll pay any real attention to are Ghostface, Jay-Z, 50 Cent (well, most times), NaS, Kanye West and Mos Def . I’ve never gotten into Bun B even though I’m sure his album is very good. It’s just not my steez I guess. I may check it out though, just out of curiosity, just to hear what a Source” 5 mic” album sounds like.\n\nSo I have a real dilemma. I just can’t seem to come across a lot of good music that holds my attention lately.\n\nHoping that will change when I listen to or purchase these albums/mixtapes in the near future:\n\nDistant Relatives – Nas and Damian Marley (Can’t believe I haven’t heard this one yet!)\n\nBig Picture – Big L (I’ve never heard a Big L album. Guess that makes me a fake hip hop head)\n\nBoy Meets World – Fashawn (He has a good buzz right now. I want to hear what he’s all about. But on second thought, I’m not really digging his voice. I have to see if I can get past that because there are some good beats on this album)\n\nFornever – Murs + 9th Wonder ( Never heard a full Murs album before either. Would like to check this out) I always do the 30 second preview of each track before purchasing. Upon doing that I only liked 2 tracks: “Vicky Veil” and “I used to Love Her (Again)” which I purchased on iTunes.\n\nTill the Casket Drops – Clipse (I don’t own a Clipse album. Would be nice to hear whether or not they’ve evolved.) Gave it a listen and I like it!! The beats are tight! Purchased!\n\nKimbo Price – Sean Price (I like this guy…always have. Eager to hear this mixtape. Downloaded as of 8/28)\n\nDouble Barrel – Marco Polo + Torae (This is another album I’ve been hearing about. But I will dismiss it if I don’t like their rapping voices. Yes…I am surface like that)\n\nPreface – Elzhi ( I like Elzhi and I want to give this a listen)\n\nAnother Heist – Camp Lo (Curiosity about whether this is good or not will make me listen to it)\n\nBorn Like This – MF Doom (Not sure how new this is but I love all things Doom)\n\nShibuya– Nicolay (not that familiar with Nicolay, but the title sounds cool so I’m game)\n\nI am so desperate to add some quality new music to my iPod. Feel free to suggest some more albums I should listen to…Please and Thank you!\n\nA Few Good Beats\n\nFollowing are some of my favorite beats ever. Some of them will never receive awards or many accolades, so I decided I wanted to give them some shine just for the hell of it. These are beats from songs that I play constantly; and with good reason. These beats are truly incredible and deserve some sort of acknowledgment.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s get into it . Here are the awards in no particular order:\n\nContinue reading “A Few Good Beats” →"
