        "text": "JAY-Z is known to be about his business, but he is also known to look out for people when they are in a financial bind.\n\nDuring a recent interview with “The Breakfast Club,” Ruff Ryders founders Waah, Dee and Chivon Dean shared the story about how JAY let DMX leave Def Jam without having to pay a penny back to the company.\n\n“What had happened was JAY-Z called DMX and told him, ‘The inmates have took over the prison.’” Dean said. “And when your man JAY-Z got in position, X felt that he didn’t honor him in a proper way and hold weight like he was supposed to.” They then added that their egos got the best of them once JAY became president of Def Jam in 2004, which led to their beef.\n\n“The good part about Def Jam — and I gotta give it to Hov — X was in debt over there. He probably owed about $12 million,” Dean revealed. When DMX left Def Jam for Sony, he said that Hov “released him and wiped off the debt clean and let him go. He didn’t have to pay nothing back.”\n\nBack in 2018, Lil Wayne opened up about a time when JAY helped him pay off his $7.72 million tax debt. The “A Milli” rapper reportedly owed $3.35 million in taxes for 2008 and $2.25 million for 2009. He also owed other unpaid taxes and late fees.\n\nJAY-Z helped him pay off the bill in full. “There’s people like JAY-Z. He helped me when I was really, really, really down. Really, really, really down,” Wayne told the crowd during a show in Chicago. “JAY don’t want me to tell nobody. That man helped me with my taxes. He’s a real friend, y’all. Shout out my n*gga JAY!”"
