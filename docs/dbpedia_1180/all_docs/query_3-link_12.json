        "text": "Cabrini Green’s own MC Tree G is a critically-acclaimed rapper-producer whose sound broke to some international recognition in 2012, an example of the wide-ranging sound of Chicago’s diverse hip-hop scene. Though there were label deals in the works, things don’t always work out–first among them, the desires of an artist and the expectations of showbiz. In a rare interview, Tree talked with David and Charne about his career, and played an exclusive mix of the music that made him who he is. Recorded last spring, this was originally intended as episode 8 but is being released out of order because we feel like it.\n\nPart 1: David and Charne’s Mix\n\nPart 2: Tree Interview & DJ Mix\n\nSo Many Shrimp Radio Episode 15 features the hardest working DJ in Chicago, the one & only DJ Gemini Jones. Gemini Jones is a widely respected DJ who Charne first discovered six years back, when she was spinning at the legendary Shrine nightclub. She’s known not just for being an adept pro DJ, but also for her eclectic sets which mix music new & old, and keeps things Chicago by incorporating juke music alongside hip-hop, house, dancehall, and R&B.\n\nPart 2 features an interview with Gemini and a DJ mix.\n\nPart 1 is a more-adventurous-than-usual mix by David Drake and Charne Graham.\n\nPart 1 – David & Charne’s Mix\n\nPart 2 – Gemini Jones’ Interview and Mix\n\n[Download here; stream here. Soundcloud removed it because the industry is lame]\n\nhttps://audiomack.com/embed/song/ddc/so-many-shrimp-radio-episode-15-part-2\n\nPut simply, Chicago’s rap scene as we know it now would not exist if it wasn’t for DJ Amaris. David first met a 22-year-old Amaris Hewett in January 2012 at the home of Chief Keef; he later interviewed him for this piece in Spin Magazine. Amaris was the first DJ to spin Keef, as well as several other now-prominent Chicago rappers, in clubs all across the South Side, high school and college parties, proms, sweet 16s, and concerts, helping break the rapper before anyone outside the city even knew his name.\n\nToday, Amaris is Chief Keef’s official DJ, and still spins throughout Chicago. He’s also the founder of the Golden Knights Drill Team, a non-profit that takes on kids from throughout Chicago, and who’ve won first prize in the Bud Billiken parade several times in recent years.\n\nDavid and Charne spoke with Amaris about his work with Keef, and the Golden Knights, and Amaris offered a DJ mix split in two parts–half of Chief Keef classics and exclusives, and another focusing on the kinds of music he spins throughout Chicagoland. He also told us about his experience DJing Kenwood’s prom at the Shed Aquarium.\n\nThis was recorded June 4, 2017, at David’s place. It was very hot, so excuse the fan noise in the background. Part one is a mix from David and Charne.\n\nPart 1: David and Charne’s mix\n\nPart 2: DJ Amaris Interview & Mix\n\nI’ll probably write something about all this in the future.\n\n10 of Charne’s 2017 fav’s:\n\nLil Bibby feat.
