Funky DL: What’s going on man? I’m real good, you know. Dave VJ: It’s great to get you up on the show, it’s been long overdue. Funky DL: Yeah, that’s true but it’s good to be up here man. Dave VJ: The thing I gotta ask you, and for those intrigued listeners who wanna know and me of course, why is it you chose hip-hop as a career? Cos it is very, very hard. Funky DL: It’s a good question man; I guess for me like… from a very young age, like 12, 13 I just connected with hip-hop in a big way. And it wasn’t just the music but it was the culture as well, you know the message in what I was hearing. So I just began to embrace everything about it and I found like it was just fitting to me. It was like the perfect… harmony for my creative direction and I just loved it man. I knew that’s what I wanted to do with my life, you na’ mean? Hip-hop was the one…\n\n2.\n\nOne 01:45\n\nVerse One Yo you all privy to listen to this sound so illy it bump heads from Tokyo to West Philly I’m one of a kind aint no matching my hits I’m like Roadrunner you won’t catch me any time quick It’s been a long time since I came into town I seen Rappers swim, I seen Rappers drown I’ve seem em’ looking puzzled in the lost and found I used to sound dope call me awesome now (F) fortunate to finds this fame feeding of this feeling to finally gain (U) unmatched, untouchable, undisputed undescribable sounds I utter in my music (N) now is not the time for nonsense If you’re nothing but negative I’ll never need nothing (K) killing it keenly and keep it moving the kilohertz on the kick drum is beautiful (Y) yo for years I’ve been yelling at you I’m a young man but coming from yesterdays youth (D) I demand that you don’t delete this dynamite dialogue is definitely deep (L) listen to my lyrics like you love it I live for this lifestyle it’s likely you’ll learn lots from it and that spells Funky DL take note I aint DJ Kool but I’mma clear my throat one…\n\n3.\n\nInterlude #2 00:29\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: So DL, what you’re saying to me is that hip-hop music was your calling and you immediately realized that once you had become exposed to it? Funky DL: Most definitely, I mean it had to be part of my life cos everything felt so right about it. And it’s funny cos so many of my… my peers at school seemed to be into all other kinds of music that was kicking off, like Drum and Bass and all of that, so… and you know it… it was to the point where I felt like a minority but none of that ever swayed me from staying close to hip-hop.\n\n4.\n\nHip-Hop 04:14\n\nChant Hip-hop (x16) / (simultaneously) the real hip-hop (x7) you don’t stop Chorus Hip-hop (x16) / (simultaneously) / hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, I thank God for hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, it’s all down to hip hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, I thank God for hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, yeah Verse One I could have been a Crack Dealer; ay yo I could have a murderer could have been a Mickey D’s manager flipping burgers I could have been a burglar; I could have been the worst Rapper on this planet that y’all never even heard of I could have been a Doctor maybe even a Lawyer I could have been an employee not an employer I could have a been a car jacker or got jacked I could have got shot in the back and that’s that I could have been incarcerated for mad years step out into the real world and not change gears I could have been rich, squandered all my money and switched and ended up a broke in a ditch I could have been crazy and not been smart I could have been emotionless and had no heart I could have put money over love I could have put the world before God and not worked hard I could have been ruthless, I could have been a nerd, geek or a doofus I could have been useless I could have signed a bogus record contract depressed cos my music aint out and I’m trapped I could have stayed in one place all my life I could have had a cheating wife who don’t act right I could have not known how to bless the mic but I do and it’s been alright and that’s down to hip-hop Chorus Chant Verse Two I could have been the last sperm drop instead of the first I could have been cursed I could be dead laying in a hearse I don’t worry if I’m not the best I could have been the worst I could be up in the third world dying of thirst I could have had a one page story without no chapters could have been unintelligent a bit backwards with my eyes on the wrong prize and distracted I could have been slacking and lacking the right package I could have been wondering what if I could have been deluded and living a myth smoking a spliff and suffering from alcohol abuse I could have been hidden from the truth I could be proof that young black men make the best of their youth this is real talk straight from the booth I could have had no clue and no tenacity I could have been suppressed and never reaching my capacity I could have been nothing I could have been no one I could have been 00 I’d rather be 01 I could have done put in time and had no fun and made no money but rather me owe some I could have been a whole lot of things some worse some better some you lose some you win I could have not known how to rock the mic but I do it became my life and that’s down to hip-hop Chorus Chant Outro Chant Hip-hop (x32)\n\n5.\n\nInterlude #3 00:44\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: You’re tuned into Wash FM with me, Mr VJ aka the Vinyl Junkie and special guest in the building today “Funky DL” and for those of you who have just joined us… where have you been by the way? He’s been explaining what hip-hop means to him and how its always meant a lot more than just a form of music, so speak on it Sir?\n\n6.\n\nChorus It’s 1947 town and there’s some rumours floating round but I don’t know, I don’t know, Gals and Gangsters on the prowl, I heard something bad is going down but I don’t know, I don’t know. Verse One It’s 1947 and I’m sitting in my ritzy joint sipping on a whiskey on the rocks the barmaid dame points over to the door where I see this hotshot out of town reporter walks over shows me a mug shot and says “I’m looking for the Big Cheese Mickey Four Thumbs” I told him “I aint seen him” and he asked me “do you know some of Mickey’s goons like Little Charlie Raincoat?” I told him “Certainly but he skipped town weeks ago, I didn’t catch your name you got a nerve coming up in here asking me these questions so I’m asking what’s the big idea? Why I oughta, who are you some kind of wise guy? Beat it you aint nobody in here, you just a fly by” he said “don’t blow your top I got something you need Jack” then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dozen Greenbacks “huh, now you’re talking let me see that picture once more, oh yeah Mickey, you might find him at the Drugstore” Chorus Verse Two The reporter said “swell gee Jack that’s might nice of ya” he split from out the joint and then he hopped in to a Chrysler jalopy then I quickly gave Mickey a call and explained he said “don’t worry he aint nothing but a meatball, he’s from the Big Apple and get a load of this he thinks I was involved in that case from 46’ with what’s his face? Chrome Dome the bald guy and some doll, you know the one that Johnny let him have it and got bumped off” “the one who wore the Alligator shoes and always had the hots for Mary down the road? You mean Pauli” “yeah that stupid klutz, he knocked off a bank last year and tried to frame me and plus he owes me money tried to scram and didn’t pay me so me and my Gorillas went to see his old lady” “hmm is that the one in hospital? Was that you Mickey? “maybe” “but she won’t talk, matter fact I think she can’t talk” “and plus the fact she won’t be going nowhere till she can walk” Chorus Verse Three “The reporter’s pulling in; I can see him out the window” “so what you gone do Mickey?” “Whichever way the wind blows, Jack let me handle this and call you back shortly he’s only a reporter so all he can do’s report me what he think, I’m small time and get the Heebie Jeebies? Cos I can click my fingers and he’d wish he didn’t see me I’ll make him cop a slave then I’ll put him on the payroll and if he doesn’t swing for it I’ll hit him with a table so if he wants rhubarb, he’s come to the right place but this is not the right place to get to keep a nice face” “look see Mickey, hey some customers just came in plus it’s hard to hear ya cos the band just started playing let me know what happens when I speak to you tonight and be careful cos the cops are everywhere in black and whites” just before I hung up the phone my heart stopped cos I heard a gun go off and Mickey got shot! Outro Chorus It’s 1947 town and there’s some rumours floating round but I don’t know, I don’t know, Gals and Gangsters on the prowl, I heard something bad is going down but I don’t know, I don’t know, I gotta grab my bag and scram, don’t want no one knowing who I am that I know, that I know, don’t want no cops harassing me or nobody else to be asking me no questions cos I don’t know. it’s 1947 town and there’s some rumours floating round but I don’t know, I don’t know, Gals and Gangsters on the prowl, heard something bad is going down but I don’t know, I don’t know, yay-ay\n\n7.\n\nInterlude #4 00:31\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: So D? Tell me. You’ve produced a lot of tracks over the years, I mean a whole lot of tracks and they are diversified but most of the tracks that you do tend to fall into the jazz and soul nature of things, umm is there a specific reason why you focused on those particular styles? Funky DL: I mean I guess I would say that I just loved everything that had a soulful melody. I’d find some like real smooth breaks and just upon hearing them, the only way I could describe the sound was just like… that sounds so sexy.\n\n8.\n\nSo Sexy 03:49\n\nIntro So sexy (x4) Chorus How did you get to be so sexy? I don’t know, Don’t know how you can be so sexy, I don’t know, When I see you, you seem so sexy, I don’t know, Does this mean that you feel so sexy? Tell me. Verse One It’s me again, let me talk to you at 99bpm I saw you from way back when and there were many things I couldn’t say back then I guess that you could say that I was laid back then but now it’s all different so pay attention girl I hope that you are listening at first I thought I like you just a little bit but that little bit just grew to be a bigger bit you (you) are looking magnificent long hair, pretty smile, lip gloss glistening do that cute thing blowing all them kisses and I know you probably got a bunch of dudes whistling I will do almost anything to show you that I am a true gentleman let’s go, I’ll pick you up at nine we can go catch a show and if it’s raining yo we don’t have to go we can stay inside and chill some more and let me tell you some more things you didn’t know while we kick back and listen to some De La Soul you’re so sexy, I wanna know Chorus Verse Two Just yesterday I was thinking to myself lets just say the idea of you and me blessed this way means we’ll probably never have a restless day now isn’t that beautiful? baby all I want to be is truthful diligent and useful providing what you’re used to everyday you looking so youthful I hope you pay attention just to what them other dudes do promising that they can be your Captain but I don’t make promises I make things happen (yo ever since) ever since I started rapping I made a lot of girl tracks this is most accurate and the fact is I really made my mind up so I can see a Playboy line up but I’m telling each and every one honey your time’s up grown man talk now I gotta wise up back to you girl forget the rest you straight blow em’ out the water honey no contest let me take you out or if you need some rest we can kick back and listen to some Tribe Called Quest you’re so sexy Chorus Outro So sexy (x4)\n\n9.\n\nInterlude #5 00:54\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: Now DL, we come to a bit of a dodgy question but true say you’re a friend we’ve kind of brushed on it in the commercial break, lets get into it, I didn’t wanna embarrass you but you know what’s coming next, you know I gotta ask, and I’m sure all the listeners need to know too. What is the deal with you and female attention on tour? Cos you go all over the place, so fill us in bro!\n\n10.\n\nOut of Touch 03:51\n\nPre-Verse I thought this chick was magnificent until I got to know her and I saw so many differences and I could think of many instances when I had to stay away and keep so many distances but I don’t know what happened this time maybe I just fell in love or maybe I was just blind maybe I was insane, let me take my time to explain… Verse One See she loved her Sci-Fi and I loved my Hi-Fi see I worked erratically and she worked a nine to five I’d drink a root beer and she’d drink fine wine and I’d buy the CD she got it from Limewire and I loved the Autumn her favourite was Summertime and I would shop in the store and she would shop online and she was always late, I’m constantly on time she’d only eat certain things while I would try all kinds I’d show her love everyday, she’d show me on Valentines and I would stick to the truth, she always had alibis my friends were guys and girls, her friends were only guys her money was all hers, my money was both of ours and I was a realist while she would just fantasize and she would decide quick, I took time to analyze we’d never meet in the middle, it’s just me in the middle and I’m feeling a little… Chorus Out of touch, we too different and it seems like we out of luck so will we both stay together? I doubt it much I don’t see that happening cos we out of luck and I doubt it much cos we out of touch, we too different and it seems like we out of luck so will we both stay together? I doubt it much I don’t see that happening cos we out of luck and I doubt it much cos we out of touch Pre-Verse Verse Two See she loved the new school and I loved the old school and I was T-Mobile and she was on 02 I liked my red meat, she only liked Tofu and I was a leader, she would do what most do she liked to spend doe while I liked to save doe I spoke with choice words while she was a say so I liked all R&B, she only liked J-Lo and I’d rock a no name, she only wore labels I always work hard, she wanted it easy I loved the cinema she only watched TV I listened to Motown, she didn’t like Stevie I’m slow to my anger, but she is so speedy she liked to sleep in while I’d always wake up I liked her natural, she always wore makeup we’d never meet in the middle, it’s just me in the middle and I’m feeling a little… Chorus\n\n11.\n\nInterlude #6 00:38\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Jingle: WASH FM Dave VJ: Live in the studio, my special guest Funky DL. Ah so tell me, if you’re in a relationship, how hard is it to actually maintain a relationship and still… I guess at the same time be married to your work? Funky DL: I mean I feel that’s always an individual thing, you know umm… it depends on who’s involved and how needy they are of each other and also how well two people can compliment each other. The right two people can have a real harmonious and prosperous relationship no matter what they do, but all it takes is for the wrong two people to get together and the result can just end up being… well a crying shame.\n\n12.\n\nChorus Now tell me what they both supposed to do they really don’t seem compatible and it’s a crying shame she says he doesn’t do what he’s supposed to do he says she never changes her attitude so it’s crying shame Verse One I knew this chick named “Shame” she was crying I asked why? and she told me she aint trying to keep from dying she’s half black and half Hawaiian and keeps lying to herself and keeps denying that she can be much more I pondered with such thought remained silent she got a dude who’s very violent he gives her black eyes when he cannot control her every movement she wants it to stop but aint prepared to lose him it sounds kind of stupid and now he moved in and aint left now being at home is like facing death she doesn’t work she doesn’t study, he doesn’t worry he’s out late she calls him “come home” he doesn’t hurry and gets mad hen her family calls like she didn’t know nobody before, that’s not all he forces her to take care of his son no it’s not her child it’s a previous one while he’s out with his friends having mad fun everyday and treating life like a vacation yo but she get no part of that holiday and now she on Prozac popping like one a day, it’s not a game she let her dude become her downfall now it’s all looking grim now it’s not about her it’s all him and everyday is like a loop of the day prior but she doesn’t seem to tire, it’s a crying shame Chorus Verse Two Yo, I knew this dude called “Crying Shame” always weeping asked the reason and that’s when he commenced the speaking about his girlfriend, no job, lazy person doesn’t work hard, sits around watching TV life easy she flirts with his friends no ends to the nonsense doesn’t use her common sense, he the breadwinner comes home to find no dinner, stereo playing every other light is on when bills need paying he’s sick with her lifestyle all has is just a nice smile cute style but her inside empty no focus, she way past her early twenties and her phone never stops ringing she spends half the morning in the mirror singing and eating all the groceries said he didn’t think that this the way that love supposed to be plus he thinks she got a man on the side the way she whispers, she plays the mistress and gets new jewels just after Christmas it went from magic and turned to tragic she steals from him and if he confronts her she turns around to say she wouldn’t do that she loves him it’s just words but they strong enough to keep em’ together so he lives through her every endeavour and everyday is a repeat of the previous but nothing changes so I guess it aint serious, a crying shame Chorus (x2) Outro Such a crying shame\n\n13.\n\nInterlude #7 00:46\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: Yeah I’ve interviewed you so many times, we’ve never actually asked this… umm you must have quite an in depth knowledge of jazz music because your music is predominantly laden with jazz, so is there anything you actually look for or in this case listen for when you actually dig in the crates to find something to loop up to make the musical match with the beats? Funky DL: Well I mean most times when I’m looking for breaks, I pay attention to several things; for example, whether it’s a studio or live recording. Umm how many musicians feature, is it a soloist? Duet, trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, full orchestra even… umm but I look out for the date of the recording as well cos if you’re not careful you’ll buy something recorded in mono back in the 1920’s and it’ll probably sound real dusty…\n\n14.\n\nDusty 03:17\n\nIntro (x2) Check, check, check, check (it sounds dusty) check, check, check, check (it sounds dusty) check, check, check, check (it sounds dusty) check, check, check, check Verse One It’s the F.U.N.K.

Is there anything you miss from the times when you first started? Funky DL: Ah most definitely man, I mean I really miss the feeling of being part of a movement, you know, when I first started I used to go out a lot more and meet the other MC’s and Deejays coming up in the game. You know the ones that were kinda getting the same heat as me and those times were golden. You don’t really see the faces anymore at least you don’t recognize the faces that you are seeing and sometimes I feel I’d give anything to have that feeling of being back around the old school.\n\n16.\n\nIntro Now I’m back around the old school that raised me now I’m back around the old school that raised me now I’m, now I’m back around the old school that raised me now I’m back around the old school that raised me Chorus Now I’m back around the old school that raised me (back around the old school) now I’m back around the old school that raised me now I’m, now I’m back around the old school that raised me (back around the old school) now I’m back around the old school that raised me (back) Verse One Now I’m back around the old school that raised me it’s crazy 3 feet high and rising with daisy’s caps to the back, fresh mesh, fresh to death best dressed so don’t step on my sneakers spit a rhyme I’ll leave you speechless back to the struggle when Def Jam had Russell in the hustle and Break-dance 1 had the muscles from Brussels doing handclaps in black Spandex back when Smokey was a bandit I’m guarding the mic, my man’s next spit it like Special Ed, Biz Mark and KRS or the Fresh Prince and Jazz Jeff back when we used to worry bout’ the year 2000 millennium bugs now the ghetto got millennium thugs and hip-hop evolved and young bloods feel old platinum replaced gold, competition’s fierce and vinyl stores are scarce it’s a ghost town it’s like the Sheriff got scared and fle’ed the showdown and Berry Gordy quit Motown, where’s Stevie Wonder? Last I heard he did a track with Busta without the old school there’s no school now I’m back around it feels so cool Chorus (x2) Verse Two Now I’m back around the old school, young with no front teeth listening to Kool Keith and Stetsasonic before De La did Bionix, before Dre did The Chronic the ladies wore door knocker earrings and bandanas and young kids believed in Santa and hip-hop was beats, rhymes, pops and locks where Rakim made em’ clap while Eric would cut and the term Sucker MC’s was for Sucker MC’s and these synthesized beats on keys were not born and Pete Rock made a hook using only a horn I reminisce and think about the wonderful bliss when ice was only for drinks and was never for wrists and selling out was for them punks, it was never for this we maintained, when adversity came we changed lanes our words had the power to sway and change brains and free our own people from these shackles and chains that imprison the youth and imprison the truth so I’mma act like a prisoner when I’m in the booth and hold bars get it? I’m no fool, there’s no rules there’s no clues paid my dues when reppin’ the old school Chorus (x2) Verse Three Now I’m back around the old school before Mafia names where kids took a can sprayed graffiti on trains it was tagging, MC’ing was the art of bragging before rumours of gay rappers and Armageddon and every rap record was a lesson schooling me was the likes of Young MC and Schooly D catch my drift? And double vinyl records didn’t exist now they old news demoted to old tunes but them plastics are considered classics some are worth paper do the mathematics yo, I let my tape rock till my tape pop when my tape got stuck I was like man what pushing paper in the top holes my blanks ran out every week I was taping what was hot on the street pressing pause when the DJ was beginning to speak hoping that the track would leave a little loop of the beat and I love them days, them days were priceless one of the nicest times in my life when I think back they still amaze me it’s crazy cos now I’m back around the old school that raised me Chorus (x2)\n\n17.\n\nInterlude #9 00:43\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Jingle: WASH FM Dave VJ: It’s Wash Fm with me Dave VJ aka the Vinyl Junkie, special guest Funky DL. D? Would you say that you’ve fulfilled most of the aspirations that you had when you first started out in this game as an artist? Or are there many things which you have envisaged that have not yet come to pass? Funky DL: I mean, I would say that I got to do most of the things I had realistically hoped for back then, umm and there were many things that happened to me, umm many attributes that I acquired that I didn’t expect. I think the key for me has been learning to accept that my plan and the worlds plan for me are not always equal so there will be things that I want and can’t have but also things that I don’t seek that just come… and that’s life…\n\n18.\n\nThat's Life 03:39\n\nIntro (x4) That’s life, that’s life, that’s life, that’s life, that’s life Verse One My Pops told me that I was alone in this world when there’s trouble it’s bound to be a solitary struggle when you’re rich you won’t see notin’ but extended arms when you broke you can’t do nothing but extend your charm but it doesn’t take much to improve your situation when you got no money but you exercise patience the fact is everywhere you turn there’s many taxes that’s why we gotta’ put in any practise to catch this good life we all seeking I learned how not to listen when a fool’s speaking, I won’t profit so I only listen to a wise mans words and it takes a lot to really quench a wise mans thirst for life, that’s why I never settle for what is or settle for what was, how can we really live? If we work hard, see an opportunity and take it six bils’ the population but we all can’t make it but that’s life Chorus When you find someone and then you fall in love and then they break your heart (that’s life) when you’re underpaid and you’re late for work and plus your car won’t start (that’s life) when your baby’s born and the birth was smooth and it’s healthy (that’s life) when you went from broke and then you made a move and now you’re wealthy (that’s) Verse Two I made crazy money when I was just in my teens signed a contract for writing rhymes and making beats put in five years work and then another five waiting patiently for everything I dreamed for to arrive and as I got older I became more aware that a little comes here and a little comes there and some things are not for me I learned to accept it failure tried to be my friend, I learned to reject him but even though I did good and raised up my business I got stopped by the police who said I looked suspicious got pulled to the side had to empty out my pockets they asked of ID so I reached into my wallet then showed them my visa with my name and my business they attitude changed and they took mad interest they realized I had no time for crime in my life but an all black Hoodie was a stereotype but that’s life Chorus When you’ve planned for a whole year to take a trip and now it’s here you’re sick (that’s life) when you bought new clothes in the store last week and they just don’t fit (that’s life) when you call a friend and apologize now you tight again (that’s life) when you lost all faith but you pray to God and now there’s light again (that’s) Refrain (x2) That’s life, that’s life, that’s life, that’s life, that’s life Verse Three One of my real good friends put his girl in a coma I think it was the ignorance and drugs taking over another good friend turned his back on me quickly after such a long time and for less than a fifty I have another friend and to him I stay close he works real hard I respect him the most has my back when I need it, I got his when he need mine he going fast forward while the others just rewind see I understand the true value of a man doing what you cannot instead of doing what you can diligence, integrity, tolerance and sacrifice speak the hard truth no pretence and always acting nice there’s a few that I can trust with my life who won’t serve they own cause but will do what is right and God created every man to be this way but many got contaminated, principles changed but that’s life Chorus When you go to the bank just to get some cash and it swallows your card (that’s life) plus the bank is closed and your cash is low now you thinking hard (that’s life) when you passed a test and your grade was A and you glistening (that’s life) when you start to speak everybody stops and they listening (that’s life, yeah) (that’s life x5)\n\n19.\n\nInterlude #10 00:28\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: So DL, tell me, if you had a piece of advice, key advice for up and coming artists, what would it be? Funky DL: Just to work extremely hard man, to really work hard. I don’t know what it is about some people and their bad work ethics but so many artists wanna’ enjoy success without investing the effort needed to achieve it… It’s kinda like, ya na’ mean, nobody wants to help set up the hall but everybody wants to come to the party.\n\n20.\n\nThe Party 02:22\n\nVerse One I didn’t have no money but my friend called me and he told me bout’ a party whose going? He told me everybody so I put on my Pierre Cardin cardy I gave a quick call to Charlene but her sister picked up told me that she’s busy sorry I made my way to the party nuff’ people inside we packed like sardines they playing Talib Kweli they played Bob Marley and even Gnarles Barkley now they playing “Ladi Dadi” we don’t cause trouble we don’t bother nobody bre’s’ acting like they just joined the army I spotted three girls sitting in the corner calmly all dressed up like Barbie the middle one was Asian and she had a nice body sipping lime and Bacardi I’m looking in her eyes they’re saying “charm me, charm me” so I said “pardon me, I love the way you smile girl you’re sweet like honey” her friend said “don’t waste your time honey she doesn’t speak English only speaks Guajarati” “don’t she understand a word I say?” “Hardly plus she got a boyfriend and he’s over by the bar see, now there’s no need to worry, but the is a boxer kinda’ like Muhammad Ali” “you taking me for Laurel and Hardy, what’s the worst he can do? Feather and tar me?” I don’t really gotta leave in a hurry but I just step even though it’s kinda funny now I’m on my solitaire brock’ pocket acting like a millionaire searching for my friend but don’t see him anywhere probably went out to get fresh air so I pulled up a chair and kicked back like the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air feeling kinda’ fly in the clothes that I wear had some fresh Nike–Air and my Pierre Cardin I get recognised by a bre’ trying to talk to me on some reh teh teh’ he was kinda’ boring me like Tony Blair, Blair, Blair so I listened to him then I told him “yeah, yeah, yeah” am I bothered? Do I care? looked at the time and the time was weird it said 14:20 oh my watch aint repaired then I felt like a beer double check my pocket but there aint’ no money there it only made me more aware I need to work harder just to have a better year cos life aint’ easy when you’re broke man I swear\n\n21.\n\nInterlude #11 00:36\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Jingle: WASH FM Dave VJ: So we’re back after the commercial break. Let me tell you this now, DL and me have been talking in between records and one of the things that sets him apart from a lot of people as he’s explained to me is “hard work is a must”. How many hours a day would you say you actually work D? Funky DL: I guess on average I work like a twelve hour day, umm sometimes more but rarely less . Because I do business with Japan and they have like an eight hour time difference, if I wanna catch them and correspond for the day, I have to get up at like six in the morning.\n\n22.\n\nThe Morning 03:52\n\nIntro Chorus I don’t know bout’ you but I gotta’ pick my shoes up I gotta’ pick my tools up I gotta’ make moves in the morning in the morning (x7) Verse One I came so close to quitting but when I look back to the words I’ve written the same words I’ve been spitting for so long I knew that giving up would be so wrong I’m strong, that’s what I gotta’ be spiritually in my soul, in my mind mentally and physically guarantee my positive moves are made visibly I was never brought on this earth to live miserably so I made my own decisions and had my own vision executed with precision to make music and get y’all to listen I committed to it stuck to the mission then I arrived at a place where I watched no face and I left no trace of underperforming, slacking or stalling it doesn’t end here, I’ll see you in the morning, the morning Chorus I don’t know bout’ you but I gotta’ pick my shoes up I gotta’ pick my tools up I gotta’ make moves in the morning (clap) (x7) in the morning (clap) Verse Two To the Most High I gotta’ show gratitude for those who did me wrong I aint’ mad at you it’s just I had to change up my attitude and get much closer to the things that really matter dude now I have a much better latitude better situations and all the things that, that includes taking advantage of the assets that I haven’t used to bring you all the kind of sound that really dazzles you and put it on cycle mode and incorporate all the things I’m told and always step with a step that’s bold and that’s my way till the day I’m old cos my words aint’ made for ignoring and life wasn’t made to be boring and man was not created to be warring just to work hard so I’ll see you in the morning, the morning Chorus Verse Three Yo, life’s hard lets face it but it wasn’t meant to be basic or meant to be wasted so if you need to give yours a facelift do it but understand you gotta’ have patience and if you think by doing the bare minimum everything you’ve worked for will pay off in dividends (no way) you’re wrong and need clarification yo you gotta’ go beyond your expectations and when you did that go beyond that cos you get out what you put in that’s a fact so if you desire sotin’ go for it work hard then work some mo’ for it try your best to save a little doe for it teach yourself the things you need to know for it (yeah) and this really aint’ a warning all I’m trying to say is be ready for the morning, the morning Chorus\n\n23.\n\nInterlude #12 00:32\n\nINTERVIEW INTERLUDE Dave VJ: Ah, DL, can you believe it? The time has gone so quick, we’ve just about reached the end of the show and it’s been an absolute pleasure having you on the air and in the studio. Would you like to say a shout out to anybody whilst I get the next record ready? Funky DL: Certainly man, I mean I just wanna shout out all my fans that have been supporting me for over the years ya na’ mean? And I wanna dedicate this new album and this interview to a special little girl who’s gone through some hard times so… I love you to bits and I miss you so much… to Sharelle my God Daughter, I call her Gods Daughter…\n\n24.\n\nGods Daughter 03:44\n\nIntro Yo, this for Relly Rells, this for Relly Rells, miss you Chorus You’re Gods daughter, also my Goddaughter your life is in a new place now you’ve turned the corner I hope your future is clear and pure as water I hope you get to do everything in your life that you wanna I hope that you can look back on the way that you were brought up I know that you were loved it’s just a shame that you got caught up so take these lyrics that your Godfather thought up it’s all that I can give until the day that I can call up Verse One Check it, I’m thinking right back to when you was just so small when you could hardly talk and just about could stand to walk I used to hear you in the background of my phone calls to your mum I tried to visit though you wasn’t local do you remember this? You might not your fascination with the luminous green that’s on my Nike watch it lights up but I wouldn’t let you wear it I was honoured when your mum asked me to be your Godparent I said yes although there was no ceremony but you don’t need no ceremony if you truly know me you got a little older then you started school and you would play my songs over guess you thought they were cool and there were times I used to take you to class when I would pick you up you’d drag me to the ice cream van you used to like to pay yourself so you will give him a pound then walk away without your change and have to walk back down you used to love Mickey D’s, Happy Meals with nuggets still Fanta, no ice please! Sweet and sour sauce and would pick the same seats every time yeah you Gods daughter so it’s gone’ be fine, you Gods Daughter Chorus Verse Two I used to take you to the park where you was never idle I read you stories and even read your Children’s Bible you used to ask me bout God and Heaven it’s a shame now the last time I saw you was about age seven I got your 8th and 9th birthday card and I been trying hard to see you now I’m told it’s not so simple but I promised myself I’d never give up til’ I exhausted all my options and I didn’t I see your picture everyday in my crib and I hope you’re doing well and love the life that you live and I’m told that your grades are good academically a lot’s happened but so many good memories remain so know that you are dearly missed and God is gonna carry you through times like this and take you to wherever you deserve to be and tell you that he loves you in these words through me this is for Relly Rells and nobody else yes it’s for you and not for no company sales I’m trying to see you and I’m gonna try harder cos I love you, take care… soon ... your Godfather Chorus (x2)\n\n25.\n\nWash FM Jingle 00:05\n\nJingle: WASH FM\n\n26.\n\nIntro Mike, has that camera got film in it? Parris what you doing with that light off? “you are megalomaniac” “he’s back! I’ve been looking for this guy for years” Duke, zip your top up all the way man, core What’s going on? Marilyn, hands off heads (laughter) Chorus I’ve never been lost with you It’s hard not to be in love with you Time and time again you are without a doubt so good to me Verse One Yo I aint trying to step on your toes I’m just one of them bro’s with ill flows like a pro I compose so cold it’s all froze your highs are probably one of my lows so don’t get too close cos you know I’m probably bound to expose (oh!) and who knows? I suppose that I’m bout to explode so keep your distance don’t matter if you friend or a foe I’m making you know moral could be a all time low but it’s cool though, I figured how to make that grow now it’s long like the words in my B.I.O. I stand tall like a giant player fe-fi-fo the fans go crazy every time they see my show that’s why I’m telling the promoters that I need my doe don’t wanna pay me? I get militant like G.I. Joe and even if y’all get away with it at least I know I cease to slow from the east with the beats that blow show me red lights but I’m somebody that needs to go give information on the basis of who needs to know and I love to reap that’s why I got these seeds to sow so if any fans want a photograph I’m pleased to pose they ask me what I mean in lyrics I repeat my flows these beats I chose they ask me yo whose beats are those? These beats are cold like snow even beats that’s old a Funk DL beat’s like a piece of gold I do it for the whole world from the streets I roll, (oh!) its good music Chorus I’ve never been lost with you It’s hard not to be in love with you Time and time again you are without a doubt so good to me No I’ve never been lost with you It’s hard not to be in love with you Time and time again you’ll be without a doubt so good to me Verse Two (Oh!) Yes, guess who’s blessed with finesse? dress to impress with this style I posses I’m worldwide kinda’ like American Express and stand for progress and won’t take much less I take no stress but I do take requests it’s easy because of all the time I invest strategic just like chess so I can rock to the beat or an acapella recess (oh!) “I’m so focused so it’s never hopeless and you can take that straight from the one who wrote this nonetheless at my prime, at my best I’m one of the nicest with the beats compressed” (oh!) so like Busta, Charlie and Dinco what’s next? Cos school’s out I left like Kanye West and I don’t just love hip-hop I’m so obsessed my eyes stay on the prize, have y’all noticed? So don’t protest at the one who quotes this listen a couple times then go promote this and take interest as if you was Nat-West it’s a good look like a model bout’ to undress (huh) (oh!) me and my mic we so marvellous I’mma keep this growing just like Gardeners with two bars left I just wanna say this I’m ghost and I love you all so God bless (oh!)
