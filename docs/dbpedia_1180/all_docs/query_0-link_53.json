        "text": "There's a neat little story behind the artwork for this album. Lloyd Price was a friend of Joe's and when he first heard the 45 of \"So much trouble,\" released on D.C.'s local Mantis Records, he immediately signed Joe for a one-album release on GSF.\n\nLloyd asked Joe for some ideas for the cover artwork. Joe was in his car with one of his kids, and together he made a sketch of what he envisioned the cover to look like. He then submitted his sketch to the art director of GSF, hoping that he'd use it as inspiration to do something nice.\n\nWeeks later, when the record was released, Joe was shocked to see that the art director had used his sketch unaltered. He was told that the art director liked it as it was - but my guess is that he was simply too lazy and not too enthusiastic about the album, which is why he just used what he got from Joe. At the time, Joe wasn't really happy about it - but today, he's proud of the cover because it is his own work and it's quite different.\n\nHe (Harold Sr.) had four children, Jr. and his three sisters who had been abandoned by their alcoholic Mom. Harold Sr. worked for a very rich Jewish woman who took a liking to the kids and bought them musical instruments and paid for lessons. She made the kids a deal that if they learned how to play at least three songs she would get them a slot on some local TV telethon. The kids took to music very quickly and within a year were appearing on local TV. The response was so good that the woman paid for them to record an LP but suggested they write “original” songs.\n\nThis is where Harold Sr. comes in, writing all the songs that appear on the LP, with most of them being attacks on the drunken and supposedly abusive ex-Mrs. Moore… “ .” Once the LP was recorded and pressed, the next step was to get them in the local record stores. At least one store told Mr. Moore that they could not stock them unless they were shrink-wrapped. Harold went to a butcher shop where his brother worked and used their shrink-wrap machine to seal the LPs… unfortunately, this was a high heat machine, and he melted every single LP in the process. This wasn’t discovered until someone bought one and brought it home. All the LPs were pulled from the stores, and rather than re-press it, the woman decided to release some 45s."
