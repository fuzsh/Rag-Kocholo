        "text": "It‚Äôs here!!! My first LinkedIn Learning course is now available! Developing Emotional Intelligence to Further Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion was designed to help you connect the dots between emotional intelligence (EI) and DEI. Because you cannot do DEI without EI. In this course you‚Äôll: - Explore your own emotions and biases - Learn to navigate cross-cultural interactions with empathy and understanding - Develop an awareness of cultural nuances, biases, and the impact of cultural differences on emotional expression, and more. Thanks again to my LinkedIn for Learning team for all of your wonderful support. especially Scott Erickson and my producer, Nicole Mangona, PMP, for helping bringing my vision light! I can‚Äôt wait to walk and guide you through this course. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and takeaways! Enroll in the new course using the link below. #linkedInLearning #emotionalIntelligence #diversity #equity #inclusion\n\nManagers and colleagues, this is a reminder to stop telling your direct reports that you are a ‚Äúsafe place.‚Äù You‚Äôve asked your employee or colleague several times how they are feeling; they say they are fine and would like to focus on work. Let that be that. Don‚Äôt gaslight or prod for more information. Respect their boundaries. More than likely, you have proven to them to be unsafe, hence why they are putting parameters around their conversation with you. I‚Äôve seen this happen on numerous occasions, especially with historically marginalized employees whom managers have not cultivated a genuine relationship with. Your direct reports and coworkers decide if you are a safe space, not the other way around. Let's foster genuine relationships built on trust and understanding. Have you experienced this before? #emotionalintelligence #psychologicalSafety #Boundaries\n\nKicking off August on a high note! It‚Äôs one thing to be excited about creating your first LinkedIn Learning Course, it‚Äôs another when the Beta Test team gives their stamp of approval! Check out their feedback on my upcoming course, Developing Emotional Intelligence to Further Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: ‚ÄúThis course is excellent for anyone wanting to learn more about improving their emotional intelligence to add more diversity and inclusion to their workplace. This course walks the learner through the steps of how to use and improve your emotional intelligence. The handout helps the learner gain a deeper understanding of the content and gives them the opportunity to reflect on their learnings. The instructor, Farah Harris, taught this course at an excellent pace which made it easy to follow along and understand the content. She provides great examples, stories, and strategies on how to better understand yourself and develop your emotional intelligence to further diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. She is enthusiastic about the topics, making this course enjoyable to watch and learn. Overall, I recommend this course for any learner. This will be a valuable addition to the library.‚Äù I‚Äôm excited that this course will be available for you this month! More details coming soon! #emotionalIntelligence #linkedinlearning #dei #diversity #equity\n\nThrilled to share that my recent keynote presentation to an audience of over 900 attendees received glowing reviews! As a presenter, I understand the importance of engaging, inspiring, and delivering valuable insights to your audience. A great presentation can ignite new ideas, foster meaningful connections, and drive transformative change. Why hire a professional speaker? ‚úÖ Engagement: Captivating and holding the attention of a large audience. ‚úÖ Expertise: Delivering well-researched, relevant content that resonates. ‚úÖ Inspiration: Motivating attendees to take action and embrace new concepts. ‚úÖ Professionalism: Ensuring a seamless, polished delivery. Also, part of how I engage and am professional is by connecting with attendees before and after my talks. I don't just present and walk off. This isn't only to make me relatable but also to make audience members feel seen and heard. Investing in a skilled presenter is an investment in your event's success. If you're looking to make a lasting impact at your next conference, workshop, or meeting, let's connect! Together, we can create an unforgettable experience that leaves your audience empowered and inspired. Feel free to reach out to me directly or visit my website to learn more about how I can contribute to your event's success. Thank you, Minnesota Association for Children's Mental Health, for having me! #leadership #emotionalintelligence\n\nPlease don‚Äôt sleep on the end of the year when it comes to your employee engagement and learning. Close the year off by sending your employees into the holiday season inspired, motivated, and empowered. If you desire an engaging practitioner to support your leaders and staff during your last quarter, look no further! Check out what a few attendees had to say after a recent keynote: ‚ÄúWOW! This was one of the best keynotes I've ever attended! I am so thankful for the opportunity to hear Ms. Harris speak to us!‚Äù \"She was fun, witty, engaging. Kept our interest and I feel like I learned a lot.\" ‚ÄúThis was SO GREAT! I loved this speaker! I could have listened to her for so much longer! It was great information and she was so engaging and real. Loved it!‚Äù ‚ÄúExcellent presentation with a very effective presenter. Content will stick with me!‚Äù ‚ÄúI really appreciated how Farah was able to engage the audience. I have never seen such a successfully interactive presentation with such a big group before. Farah's skills and knowledge are so impressive, and she is a dynamic speaker.‚Äù ‚ÄúAmazing speaker! I could listen to Farah all day. Very powerful and helpful message.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery effective speaker both in content and style. Both in data about Emotional Intelligence building and own illustrations to make for a wonderful listening experience.‚Äù \"Dr. Harris was professional and engaging. She shared experiences and language that were thought-provoking and relatable. I will recommend her for other conferences.\" (I‚Äôm not going to lie. I always chuckle when folks call me Dr.‚Äî because I‚Äôm not üòÜ.) Oh, and if you are already planning your first-quarter events, don‚Äôt hesitate to schedule a call with us. We are already 1/3rd booked for Q1 2025, and I‚Äôd love the opportunity to partner with you before I‚Äôm completely booked. Send me a DM or check the contact link in the comments to connect. I look forward to speaking with you soon!\n\nAfter 13 weeks straight of speaking engagements, I finally have a break. It‚Äôs only for a couple of weeks, yet I‚Äôm grateful. Grateful for the bustling business activity. And grateful to slow down, even if just for a bit. This past quarter was a whirlwind of travel, webinars, leadership retreats, \"Meet the Author\" events, and keynote speeches. Oh yeah, and the bonus treat of recording my very first LinkedIn Learning course! With the increase in activity, maintaining my well-being has become a top priority. I'm being even more intentional with my time to ensure that no aspect of my life suffers. I don't believe in being \"booked and busy,\" I prefer the ease of being active, paid, and engaged. This ease allows me to be fully present with my clients and cherish moments with my family and loved ones. As much as I value staying connected, I've had to decline or postpone some meet-ups and step back from writing, leading to an unplanned three-month sabbatical from my newsletter. I‚Äôve also been less active on this platform. Here's the thing. Whatever I share here and in my newsletter is free for y‚Äôall, but in this season, it would cost me. But if I have it to spend, you'll receive something from me. If not, that's okay too. This is what work-life alignment looks like."
