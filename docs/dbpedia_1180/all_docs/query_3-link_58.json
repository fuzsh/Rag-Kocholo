        "text": "January 19, 2021\n\nA little side note (ridiculous but no more than the author's reaction to my review):\n\nAfter I bought, carefully read and finally posted my HONEST review on this book, Charlene Namdhari, who herself sent me a friend request a few months ago btw, immediately unfriended me (it's a first) and even blocked me (seriously?üòë) though we never actually interacted... as if I was dying to message her *insert eye rolling*. I guess some people's ego is the size of Texas. And to think that this woman has at least 20 years on me...\n\nOriginal thoughts\n\nI have a suspicion this review is gonna be a bit long. Meh, lol.\n\nI stumbled upon this book in one of the reviews on Goodreads that actually got me pretty intrigued and I was hell bent on diving right into the story because 1)I haven't read love triangles for what seems like ages; 2) I wanted a couple with a big age gap.\n\nThe tricky thing was that I also realised that I've been GR friends with Charlene Namdhari for some time already. That's exactly how and why I found myself in a heated internal monologue/self-talk/ inner speech (or whatever people call it) on whether I really want to read and review this story even knowing that the chances are high that I, in my typical fashion, will dislike the story and rate it accordingly or I better just skip it altogether.\n\nCriticising my GR friend's book that she certainly spent her nights and days working on didn't seem like my idea of a pleasant pastime. But then I thought why the fuck I'm being such a pessimistic whiny bitch lol ??? What if I actually like the hell out of the story eventually and five star the fuck out of it???\n\nOh well. I put my big girl panties on and stopped what-if-ing. Curiosity got the best of me ( like fucking usual) cause once I set my sights on a FORBIDDEN romance...\n\nBut I dragged out the preamble so back to the actual review which probably no one cares to read but which I will write anyway:((\n\nGiving the book such a low rating without any explanation would be a dead weight on my CONSCIOUSNESS thus I will point out things that prevented me from liking the fuck of it (like I initially intended to) .\n\n1) The first thing I struggled over was long ass melodramatic dialogues. Different things were being chewed over and discussed or more like whined about in great detail.\n\n2) The heroine started grating on my nerves basically from the first few pages which is never a good sign. I was forced to spend lot of time inside her head and I wasn't very happy to put it mildly. I would associate her with three words: whiny loser bitch. Just reading about her misfortunes and how terrible they were (in the above mentioned dialogues and inner monologues as well) gave me a massive headache. I couldn't sympathise with herü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Just shut up, plsssss, stop acting like a loser, I'm begging you. Yeah, life is a difficult bitch to deal with but you should probably stop crying so much about how people and a lot of other things suck and pay more attention to yourself, no?\n\n3) Sia's love interests (father and son) and their chemistry with Sia failed to impress to me. I didn't manage to connect with any of the men. A perfect recipe for disaster. I got bored. I didn't like how it was insta - love (lust???) with both of them and I couldn't understand at what moment exactly was this undying love between the main characters born. I didn't see the development of their feelings. She fucked both of them pretty fast after their first meetings respectively and after that they were already \"deep in love\". I honestly couldn't give two fucks about either of the characters. She could have dumped them both in the end for all I care.\n\n4) The book features cheating. The author warns about that. I'm not the biggest fan of this trope but as I've said many times I'm not easily triggered or put off and I occasionally enjoy books with tropes I'm not very fond of. That being sad, Sia the cheater disgusted me. I got the feeling that she just played and fucked both men over. A cheater is never a good sight to behold but this particular one disgusted me because yes I feel that every person can do wrong because we all are not perfect and also we can right the wrong by being sincere and confessing our wrongdoing instead of acting like a lying sneaky bitch that admits her mistake only when exposed...\n\nTo end this on a happy note though. It wasn't the worst book I've come across in my life. This book has a LOT of praising reviews (almost all of them really) so many people must have enjoyed it ! It probably provides a helluva angst if you grow to care about the characters\n\nDecember 6, 2020\n\n5 Royally Fucked Stars ‚≠ê\n\nShe never stood a chance...\n\nJust breathe, Sia.\n\nHow bad can your luck get when you need rescuing more than once by the same stranger. Is it case of coincidence or something greater?\n\n\"Tell me, Prince, assuming that is your name, how is it that you keep finding me?\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\" His slow smile filled with distinct wickedness.\n\nLike a fairytale, her Prince is fulfilling a wish. One he's in no position to be granting especially at the price involved. Than ask yourself, would you exchange your virtue for it?\n\n\"Without a doubt, he was a man who could please, tease, and a fuck a woman into falling in love with him.\"\n\nMagnetic, experienced and seductive, everything a girl could dream of. Drake is not hers to have because he belongs to another. It was potentially a game-changer had Sia known. But now they‚Äôre in too deep and that one night can‚Äôt be reversed.\n\nIronically fate can be a manipulative bitch. What should have been a clean break finds Drake and Sia crossing paths again, not in the greatest circumstances. They find themselves unwillingly in a love triangle with a very costly fallout‚Ä¶\n\n\"Without even knowing it, this woman had it in her to destroy me, not just sexually, but every fiber of my being. She possessed the ability to steal my affection, my smile, my love. Was it weird to lose my heart to someone I hardly knew?\"\n\nIntoxication is my first read by this author and it was impressive. My review is purposely vague as you want to experience this shit storm first hand. Reminiscent of one of my favourite stories (Hush Hush by Lucia Franco), it had triggers galore and was one wild ride. It is fair to point out that it contains cheating and questionable morals from both parties. It was ridiculously steamy, exhilarating and completely wrong. Bravo!\n\nARC provided in exchange for my honest opinion.\n\nJanuary 27, 2023\n\nIntoxication by Charlene Namdhari\n\nOh my heart!! This book wrecked me, it owned me, and it shattered me, and then it put me back together again. It is one of the most powerful love stories that I have read in a long time. I love a story, that can take me out of my comfort zone and this one lived up to all its expectations. You will feel every emotion. It‚Äôs gut-wrenching, rip your heart out, and cry with your characters. With love triangles, you usually land up rooting for one guy, but in this book you are utterly destroyed, because both men are perfect. You will be sitting on a fence, not knowing who to root for.\n\nSo who does Sianna choose, or does she walk away from both? Sianna meets a man accidentally, who seemed to be her knight in shining armor, coming to her rescue more than once. Fate plays its hand, and they land up having a magical night, one that she can never forget and she leaves a piece of her heart behind. The promises were made, the rules where set out, but she broke them long before she even realized.\n\nDrake has lived a life doing what was expected of him to keep the family name. When he meets a woman by accident, he is drawn to her and knows for the first time in his life, what he wants and consequence be damned, but they made a promise, the rules where set out and broken, leaving him shattered and yet forever hopeful that fate would intervene once again. Rayden traveled the world to forget his own hurt and when he returns, he meets a woman who stands up to him and makes him work for a piece of her heart. When he finally wins her over he takes her home to meet his family.\n\nAnd fate plays a cruel joke on all of them. Hearts are shattered, lives are altered, and Sianna‚Äôs watches helplessly as her past and her future collide. Ms. Namdhari has written a story that has so much chemistry is sizzles. The wording, the descriptions, will make you fall in love with each character and you will feel as gutted as Sianna felt. This author has taken a gamble with this love triangle, but I promise you it is worth the read. Be prepared to meet three incredible characters, with a plot-line the twists and turns. Hidden secrets, that will change the course of everyone‚Äôs lives. Secondary characters come into play and I hope this author will give us their own stories one day soon. Overall, this was so damn good, I am going to be re-reading this one. Take a chance even if you don‚Äôt like love triangles, you will thank me later.\n\nOctober 19, 2021\n\nI went blindly into this book with a couple of friends, just because!\n\nTo say that it wasn't what I was expecting was an understatement, especially cause one of them is more (totally) into dark books. (You can't recommend anything else until the end of December, Kat!)\n\nWell... This book is far from dark.\n\nContinents apart actually!\n\nI would classify this book as a satire rom-com, with taboo, cheating and love triangle. It was funny in lots of moments, had almost zero angst, and because it was sooooo OTT and unbelievable at some scenes, it was kinda of entertaining.\n\nA book to read when you don't mind to forget it in the next day.\n\nSianna is the FMC here and I'm still trying to understand her...\n\nShe was described as that introvert 22 years old virgin, who wanted to be a chef (because her mom used to cook for her before die when Sianna was just 6 yrs old, ü§®), and instead worked as assistant, then interviewed for a PA position and ended up as restaurant manager and nanny. But the chef's dream remained üòíüò≥üòÇ.\n\nBesides what was used to describe her, her attitude, mannerism and actions in life and toward men, were far from introvert and to be honest? Her continuing cheating with her BF's father, under the same roof, and having sex next door to her BF? That wasn't forgivable. She could've ended the relationship and that would be the honest thing to do.\n\nFirst 30% of this book we have the development of the FMC meet cute with Drake (AKA the old dude/father of the year *cof cof*/ unhappily married man), and their abruptly three encounters, that led to their long as hell one night stand/ all night long /no condom sex scene.\n\nI'll say more about it later...\n\nTime jump for 18 months...\n\nThen between 30% and 43% we have the quick introduction of Rayden (AKA the young side of this triangle/ absent son / rich, cocky and spoiled guy) and his also instant attraction to the FMC, that after a couple of days banter, ended up with a quickie first time sex scene/ restaurant bathroom stall /condom on.\n\nTime jump another 4 months and they're dating.\n\nJust by this small introduction, you can easily say with who she'll end up with.\n\nUntil 34% of the book, we hadn't even heard the name of the second guy in this triangle, and maybe if the blurb hadn't told that it was a triangle between father and son, it would have bothered me less by his absence not only in the story, but also in Drake's POVs.\n\nAnother thing that is forbidden to me in age gap books, is TIME JUMP!\n\nThe guy is already old as fuck, with gray beard and hair and you're jumping forward years apart? Come on...\n\nI mean ... she'll be carrying him into the nurse home care facility, in the epitome of her mid thirties, by the 10 years later epilogue! üòÇ\n\nSo to be completely honest here, this book is kind of a mess.\n\nIt was entertaining at the beginning, because even with all the over the top situations, things were funny.\n\nBut after she started dating Rayden, promised him forever in one day, and started to cheat on him with his own father in the next? It got pretty melodramatic.\n\nSianna and Drake both had all the thoughts about not hurting Rayden, but they're always distant thoughts to their lust for each other.\n\nIt was a really shit thing, because she could've ended things with him.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to be cheating on a daily basis, since it was clear none of them regretted.\n\nAlso, Father of the year here... He literally asked her to continue to cheat on his son with him... A bunch of times!\n\nI'm pretty open minded with books, and a couple of my favourite have cheating/triangle trope.\n\nBut this one just didn't make sense.... The dialogues were weird. Their actions miles apart from their character description and they all looked like teenagers.\n\nEveryone was just too ott or just straight up shallow. Nothing to explain their love other than lust, and no character development at all.\n\nAfter 80%, and all the drama with Drake's ex wife, his brother and the fall out of all the cheating, I've skimmed until the end cause I've had enough of all this soup opera, and I honestly couldn't care anymore.\n\nJanuary 4, 2021\n\nThank you to Isabella R\n\nfor putting this Phenomenal book on my radar. Plus, my rants about a particular character who pissed me off. I hope I do this review justice.\n\nIntoxication is a love triangle of a woman in love and torn between two men who happen to be related. It pulls at your heart is magnetic and explosive. The book is in several POVs. I Love to have the Perspective of each character\n\nSianna and her ‚ÄùPrince ‚Äù met under peculiar circumstances, and oh my, so hot. You would think fate is on their side, but she has different plans. Fast forward two years later enters Rayden. How they met is one of the best stories I have read. Sianna puts him in his place. He then challenges her, and she takes him on. Four months later, Rayden wants to take her home to meet his family for the holidays. This is where the fun begins. I can't tell you how many times I had whiplash and trying to figure what happens next.\n\nIntoxication is the first book from the author, and I am highly impressed. There is a warning in the book; to be fair, there is cheating. I knew that going in. Not every story is black and white. I always love grey. Thank you to the author who wrote such a phenomenal book that I couldn't put down and writing sexy men with explosive sexual chemistry. I look forward to her next book.\n\nDecember 22, 2020\n\n2.5 Stars\n\nOverall Opinion: This was a little bit of a mess. While I was intrigued by the premise, it didn‚Äôt pan out the way I had hoped. I felt like it wasn‚Äôt as developed and/or thought out as it could‚Äôve been. It honestly felt like a rough draft for a story that was just initial thoughts thrown together and could‚Äôve been better after an edit...if that makes sense. Drake was the best thing about the story ‚Äî but even he felt like we only skimmed the surface of who he was supposed to be. Great overall idea, just not executed that well IMO.\n\nBrief Summary of the Storyline: This is Sianna‚Äôs story. Sianna‚Äôs life is an utter mess when she keeps on meeting Drake in embarrassing situations. When he propositions her for a night together, she allows her cousin to talk her into it and she ends up slipping out the next morning before he wakes up. Years later, she meets Rayden and they have a bumpy start that ends up serious to where he takes her home for the holidays. Drake and Sianna are shocked to meet again and cannot deny that they had never forgotten their night together in a big way. There are some messy moments, some family drama, and some sexy times...and Sianna gets a HEA.\n\nPoint Of View (POV): This alternated between Sianna, Drake and Rayden‚Äôs POVs.\n\nOverall Pace of Story: Good until the rushed ending where I needed more closure. I never skimmed.\n\nInstalove: No, but instant connection and instalust.\n\nH1 (Hero #1) rating: 4 stars. Drake. Yum. He was the best part of the story.\n\nH2 (Hero #2) rating: 2.5 stars. Rayden. I thought he was a major jerk when we met him and too impulsive and immature.\n\nh (heroine) rating: 3 stars. Sianna. I thought she was alright but I did feel like she was a little too immature at times.\n\nSadness level: Low, no tissues needed\n\nPush/Pull: Yes The h pushes both away at some point and I‚Äôd say that the Hs‚Äô are the main pursuers of the relationships\n\nHeat level: Hot. They have some hot tension, chemistry, and scenes -- but not so much it takes away from the story.\n\nDescriptive sex: Yes\n\nOW (Other Woman)/OM (Other Man) drama: Yes Love triangle between h and H1 (father) and H2 (son)\n\nSex scene with OW or OM: Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs a love triangle, so there are scenes with the h and both Hs\n\nCheating: Yes The h is with H1 when he is married and the h is with H2 when she is with H1 after being reunited\n\nSeparation: Yes (for h and H1) They are separated for ~2 years, and they both have other partners during this time.\n\nPossible Triggers: Yes The h is a virgin and with H1 (who is significantly older) when he is married (on page) and h is in a love triangle with father and son\n\nClosure: This ends way too abruptly for my liking with what I would reluctantly call a HEA the h gets married, but I definitely needed way more closure!\n\nSafety: This one is probably Not Safe for most safety gang readers\n\n- Does have cheating\n\n- Does have descriptive sex scenes with both of the Hs\n\n- Does have the h pushing both of the Hs away\n\n- Does have a separation between the h and H1\n\n- Does Not have abuse\n\n- Does have a HEA ending (see above)\n\nDecember 7, 2020\n\nThis is well written, the plot is good, the emotions feel real. Some characters are well developed and a few are a bit of a mess. I felt like some parts of the story were an after thought on the author‚Äòs part. I‚Äôm very torn about my rating because I‚Äôm sure it deserves a 4 but my heart says a 3. In the end it‚Äôs fair to say 3.5 and so I might as well round it up.\n\nDear lord, this girl is a mess. And he is her polar opposite. That confidence is dead sexy!\n\nAfter her story about her birthday and her mother, I would give her a hell of a lot more than $200,000. But maybe she already stole a piece of your heart.\n\nCharlene Namdhari knows how to write a sexy ass man. Whoo, anybody else hot up in here?!?!\n\nEvery man should read this book if he wants to know how to please a woman. Seriously.\n\nObviously the son doesn‚Äôt take after the father as far as charm goes.\n\nIs she that obtuse that she can‚Äôt put two and two together and get four? That apartment was in the Princeton building, he said his name was Prince. You‚Äôre not putting that together? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nAnd sorry but because it keeps being repeated I have to point it out. ‚ÄúMischief grin‚Äù makes no sense, for the love of god use mischievous. (And then later she used ‚Äòmischievousness,‚Äô so why?)\n\nWhy would you agree to a challenge where if you don‚Äôt like something you‚Äôll agree to give oral but get nothing in return? Huh? Am I missing something here?\n\nYou know what? If it wasn‚Äôt for Drake, I‚Äôd probably really like Rayden. But the copy is never as good as the original.\n\nSee? Even your mom is telling you to take her. And then so much frustration ensues until I want to rip all of my hair out. My big question is; was it worth it? As the reader was it worth all of that to reach the end? I just don‚Äôt know. I was drawn in by the age gap and than remembered why I hate love triangles.\n\nMarch 20, 2021\n\n4.5 Stars\n\nI saw the ending coming a mile away, but it still caught me off guard. Holy. Shit.\n\nAlso, why is the next book of Trent's? I have no problem with Trent‚ÄïI just thought with the way this book ended, I was expecting Rayden's TO BE NEXT!\n\n...I guess I‚Äôm not as patient as I thought I was.\n\nDecember 7, 2020\n\nI've got this book as an ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nWhen I started reading this book I didn't know it was an age-gap kind of romance. For some (personal) reasons I don't like age-gaps, but because I've read other books by Charlene and I contacted her and talked to her about my struggle, I continued to read one. This is only why I out 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nLet me first tell you that contacting and talking with the author of the book you are currently reading and going through every emotion and thought with her, was the best thing ever! The whole experience was million times better! Thank you, Charlene.\n\nThis book starts when Sianna is trying to get on a plane, but at the last minute her heel brakes and she lands on her butt. One very handsome man helps her and instead of saying thank you, she kisses him. Now what will happen? Will it be awkward or will something blossom? This is what you will have to figure out! Beware because this story is emotional, honest, real and very taunting. And not exactly what you'd expect, wink.\n\nI don't want to spoil much, because I really liked this whole book. There is not a lot I can say without spoiling or saying teeny tiny bits of the story.\n\nHowever I loved the main characters. Each of them has been so amazing, kind, loveable and true to themselves. There was not one time when I hated one of them.\n\nI'll say that Sianna was more than what you'd expect at the first glance. She is very kind, loves hard and is a loner. But she has her best friend Ru, who also happens to be her cousin. Through all that she's been through, she's strong, relentless and if the opportunity arises, takes what is offered and smashes it! In a good way, of course.\n\nThis whole story got me very twisted. Personally, as I mentioned before, I'm not into age-gap unless it is around 10 years. So I had to wrap my head around it quite a few times to get used to it. Even as I did often, it didn't take away from the story. I know some of ya'll would love it even more than I do and that's okay.\n\nMy favorite character was one I don't want to talk about, but if you are willing to message me, I'll elaborate for you.\n\nThere is so much more I want to write, but it would be probably considered a spoiler and I don't do that here. But if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask me or the author Charlene Namdhari.\n\nDecember 9, 2020\n\nWell this was one dirty book.\n\nI was very intrigued with the relationship between Sia, Ray and Drake. Does the apple really fall that far from the tree? LOL bad joke but I wanted to see if ‚Äúlike father like sun‚Äù theory was tested here.\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\n5 STARS! (or perhaps 5+++ stars?!)\n\nbefore that, can we just appreciate the deep connection between H & h? it‚Äôs one of those books where you can FEEL their connection just from the very first chapter, something like what i'd read in Birthday Girl or even Daddy's Angel\n\nThere's something so hypnotizing about the H and h. i rooted for them and am definitely satisfied with their ending üòå\n\nIt's a love triangle between Sianna, Rayden, and his father ,Drake. AND my goodness.. the angst was crazy especially with Sianna's uncertainty. With Rayden, it was the sweet kind of loving. With Drake, it felt almost sinful üî•\n\n‚ÄúIs that even possible?‚Äù I ran a hand through my hair. ‚ÄúIs it possible to have feelings for two men?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf they‚Äôve made an impression on your heart. Yes.‚Äù\n\nI think my ugly crying started when the H decided to take whatever the h gave.. including a heartbreak. also not forgetting how he drew a goddamn painting of Sianna from his memory after their night a few years back, hanging it in his study. where can you find a guy like him??? üò©\n\n‚ÄúSometimes, all it takes is a moment, a breath, a glimpse, to fall in love, and that alone can create a lifetime memory.‚Äù His gravelly voice, deep and seductive, feathered down my back like a lover‚Äôs caress. For once, I want to live because my heart is crying inconsolable tears.\n\nthis is worth more than 5 stars because im crying actual tears as well ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ regretted not reading it earlier.. but that's okay because i can foresee myself re reading it like a thousand times\n\nDecember 3, 2020\n\nEven though I didn't like the story I have nothing bad to say about it, which is an unusual response for me to a book that I disliked.\n\nSPOILERS INCLUDED BELOW\n\nI have a double standard when it comes to cheating in romance books and I will own up to it. I hate when the hero cheats on the heroine or the heroine cheats on the hero. Hate it. However when the heroine cheats on OM for the hero or when the hero cheats on OW for the heroine then I don't hate it as much. I knew that in this book it was the heroine cheating on the OM with the hero and so I was willing to read it.\n\nThis is a forbidden romance with hot sexy times. It moved at a good pace. I was never bored. I read it in one sitting. Also if you can put aside the fact that they are cheaters then the hero and heroine are likable and sympathetic characters. The problem is that I couldn't because I liked the OM too much. I wanted Sianna to end up with the OM, who was faithful to her, but she didn't. I knew that was the case prior to reading it but I didn't expect to like the OM more than I did the hero. Unfortunately, I did. I liked the OM a lot more. Therefore the fact that Sianna ended with the hero depressed me. Also what happened with the OM at the end of the story was predictable even though it is too far fetched. I will not be reading the OM's story although I am open to reading other books that the author has written.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 8, 2021\n\nLoves Not Perfect\n\nPast and present collide in this very different and unpredictable romance. A missed opportunity means love slips away but can love come around again? I won‚Äôt say anymore because I don‚Äôt want to give away anything pivotal and spoil your reading experience. I went into this read without reading the reviews and I read the reviews after completing the book because I didn‚Äôt want to know who was going to get their happily ever after and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt as unfortunately reviews here have revealed who gets their happily ever after which spoils the reader‚Äôs experience so beware! This is a first time read of this author and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next book in this series. I could not put this down until I finished it.\n\nDecember 11, 2020\n\nI am not a love triangle fan. I avoid them, I always ask if there‚Äôs HEAs or love trianglesüòÖ. That said, the blurb had me so intrigued I needed to read it. I am glad I took a chance on something different because it‚Äôs what my book funk needed. A few chapters dragged and some things didn‚Äôt make sense, but I did love Drake and Sianna‚Äôs dynamic. I liked Rayden but he was introduced later on and I didn‚Äôt feel the chemistry between him and Sianna. Once we get to the second half of the book it was so angsty. Lawd, was I crying a lot. I was leaning towards 3.5 stars at first, but bumped it to 4 stars. I REALLY need the other character‚Äôs book after that ending!!!\n\nDecember 21, 2020\n\nThere aren't a lot of hero's that I so desperately want a happy ending for but Drake was one of the few.. I literally cried with him, for him and I wanted him to get his happy ever after so bad...\n\nI really enjoyed this read, def 6 stars!!!\n\nDecember 26, 2020\n\nHOLYSWEETJESUSFUCKINGCHRIST this book was so damn hot.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt place sin in front of me and expect me not to want a taste.‚Äù ... ‚ÄúOpen your mouth, princess,‚Äù the soft command shot straight down to my pussy, and the ache I‚Äôd felt for so long was back in place.\"\n\nFuck I loved the hell out if it. Every single bit. It's a love triangle and I know many of you don't read this trope, but I fucking love it. I pretty much can take any fucked up read by now and this book was such an emotional ride. It's forbidden romance and I am so in love with Drake. If you have no problem reading stories with cheating in them, please DO READ this book!!! Gosh it was amazing steamy read.\n\nIt was recommended to me by a friend on Goodreads and as soon as I read the blurb and found out it was a love triangle with cheating in it I knew I will love it. Call me a bitch but I love all the drama and the heartbreak and all the feels, that come with these kind of reads. And what hell of a drama and emotional was this one phew, my heart still hurts.\n\n‚ÄúSometimes, all it takes is a moment, a breath, a glimpse, to fall in love, and that alone can create a lifetime memory...\"\n\n‚ÄúEvery inch of my brain tells me to walk away from you. That nothing but pain will follow. And, God, I tried. Every sleepless night has been worse than the previous, and I‚Äôm going crazy. For once, I don‚Äôt want to listen to my head. Just once, I want to be the irresponsible one. For once, I want to live because my heart is crying inconsolable tears.‚Äù\n\nDrake...I love him so muuuch...\n\nDecember 2, 2020\n\nOmg!! Omg!! This book was explosive!! I felt like an adrenaline junky , turning the pages frantically! My goodness, the chaos, secrets, and angst! You could feel the passion and emotions! And what were the odds?! Such a triangle of complications!! Charlene Namdhari takes you on such a wild and passionate journey , were difficult decisions were made and love radiated! You can literally feel intoxicated after reading Intoxication!! Phenomenal and brilliantly written story!! Love truly shines in this one!!\n\nI received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n\nCurrently reading\n\nDecember 22, 2020\n\nTwo gorgeous men, one beautiful woman\n\nWhat to expect:\n\n**Age Gap\n\n**Love Triangle\n\n**Forbidden\n\n**Cheating\n\nDecember 8, 2020\n\nIntoxication is a powerful, tug at your heartstrings, taboo love story. One of the best books I've read in a long, long time with all the feels. Well done Ms. Namdhari!\n\nA love triangle. A woman torn between two men. Father and son.\n\nHow the author pulls this off is not short of amazing. I love Rayden but adored Drake. My heart just broke for him, and all that he went through in his life, but damn, just so happy he finally got his HEA. So glad Rayden is gonna get his HEA, too, soon!\n\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\n4.5 intoxicating stars\n\nI knew going in that this was a love triangle, that's why I read it, I love the drama and the angst with these kinds of reads. Intoxication however threw me at every turn.\n\nSianna, you could say she's a young woman down on her luck, her parents are dead, she has an ogre of an Aunt, she loses her job because she won't sleep with the boss, then she finds herself homeless. I immediately felt sorry for her.\n\nOut of the blue, and by chance, she ends up with an offer she can't refuse when she meets an older man, a stranger, with whom she has immediate attraction and chemistry. The guy, knowing her predicament and knowing she won't just take money from him, offers Sianna one night with him for enough money to get her on her feet.\n\nAfter days of debating the offer, she accepts.\n\nI've read a few books like this so this isn't anything new, although I have to say their night is frickin hot!!\n\nA night of passion, filled with desire and lust but there's an undeniable connection, chemistry, and something more.\n\nSianna is woken the next morning by a text on his phone and reads the message. OH, OH, It's from his wife. She leaves while he sleeps and doesn't look back despite feeling heartbroken, she also leaves without the money.\n\nNow like I said I knew this was a love triangle but when I discovered this older guy was in a loveless arranged marriage I thought this isn't so bad, this isn't that much of a love triangle. BUT oh boy was I wrong, this was just the ripple that leads to a tidal wave of unexpected emotional dilemmas later on in the story.\n\nAfter her night with the stranger, the plot jumps to eighteen months later when Sianna is on her feet and in a job she loves. Yay, the girl sorted herself out all on her own.\n\nShe seems more brazen, more confident, and gone is the blushing young woman especially when she meets the next guy in the story.\n\nHer change in character had me a little confused. What happened to the shy young women who had never been with a man in the previous chapters? What happened in that eighteen months for her to grow balls? despite my dismay, I went with it. There are a few other things in the story that threw me, I would have liked more info on her cousin and who were the other guys she shared a house with? Chunks were missing, chunks of her puzzle weren't painting the picture and while I'm pondering about that, what happened to the Aunt? and why the heck did she take a vibrator with her when she was childminding, who does that?.\n\nAnyway, I digress and I tried not to dwell on these questions that had started to swirl in my head and so I read on.\n\nI don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I will tell you I was hooked. There wasn't any content in this story that made me cringe, that made me think it was wrong or immoral but what I did feel was that at every turn in the plot I was left thinking where the heck is this all going to go to next.\n\nI don't know if you would call it bad luck, fate, or destiny, but before Sianna reaches her happily ever after she finds herself in one hell of a predicament, two loves in her life, torn between two men. Sianna has one hell of a decision to make and that there is the love triangle I never expected.\n\nMy first book by this author. I don't read love triangles that often but I do love a book with angst and I really enjoyed this. Charlene's writing style was easy to follow and the plot easy to follow most of the time, so I would definitely read more from this author. What I am looking forward to reading next is the story of the guy who sadly didn't get the girl. A small cliffy has me desperate to know what happens next.\n\nTold in first person dual pov. Available in KU. A standalone love triangle romance. Contains sex lots of it. Enjoy.\n\nOctober 13, 2021\n\nFor the past month I kept seeing people hyping and recommending this series all over IG, and after reading the blurb and seeing it labeled as a forbidden age gap it went straight to the top of my tbr list.\n\nI even recommended it to several of my friends and they instantly jumped in to buddy read it!\n\nWell, I‚Äôm now banned from recommending books for our buddy reads for 3 months.\n\nTo say this book was disappointing would be an understatement.\n\nI truly try to find positives in every book I read, but I honestly can‚Äôt find a single thing I liked in this one.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt even 10% in and I already wanted to dnf. The so called bad luck that kept happening to heroine that was supposed to be endearing and made us like her, I don‚Äôt even know what to say. I couldn‚Äôt stop rolling my eyes!\n\nBy 35% I wanted to dnf five times already!\n\nThis book read like an over the top soap opera style rom-com! There were so many unbelievable things happening at almost every page!\n\nOur 22 yo virgin waitress/failed culinary student/junior secretary heroine ends up as a floor manager at a 3 Michelin star restaurant and on top of that she became a live in nanny for her boss (boss is NOT a love interest) where his 7yo kids managed to make her face blue and fill her bed with frogs. So when she couldn‚Äôt sleep in her bed because of frogs smell, she went to her boss‚Äô bed together with a 8inch BOB and got cought by H. Ridiculous much?!\n\nThe story was completely plot driven, and character development was basically non existent. Also, the dialogue between characters was so weird and unnatural. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain. Even when author tried to create banter between siblings or h and either one of H, it was all so flat and emotionless.\n\nI truly love forbidden reads, especially the angst that comes with them. And this one even had a love triangle to create even more angst. I live for that kind of angst in books!\n\nBut unfortunately, this story managed to completely fail in that aspect for me.\n\nI won‚Äôt even waste words on love triangle part. You know who is the end game straight away and when they all meet together and h realized how H1 and H2 are connected it was just more boring and repetitive drama.\n\nBut the saddest part for me was there was no chemistry between either characters. The lust to love transition happened overnight and I couldn‚Äôt care less who will she end up with.\n\nI honestly couldn‚Äôt take a single sentence in this book seriously. Everything was just too ridiculous and unbelievable!\n\nDecember 11, 2020\n\nIntoxication...Take a Risk...Sianna and Drake's Story\n\nWow. Let me tell you I happened upon this story. It came through my email. I looked on the part of the book which let's you read what's inside and I was hooked. I had just finished this intense mystery by one of my favorite authors and I needed something different and romantic. This is a different romantic story. Sianna was working for a boss who wanted her to sleep with him. She was trying to catch a flight her boss had paid for so she could go be his eye candy and when she missed the flight he fired her. She had no one but her cousin Ruvash and her aunt who she stayed with because both of her parents were deceased\n\nMother died of cancer when she was six. Father died after she graduated of a heart attack. She meets Drake as she is hurrying to catch her flight and breaks her heel so instead of getting up and taking her shoes and try catching her flight she stays on the airport floor where she had faced planted and then Drake offers her a hand she takes his hand but lands in his arms close enough to kiss him so she does. That is where the story begins but oh what a story it turns out to be. Different, unique and wonderfully good. Highly recommend this book.\n\nDecember 9, 2020\n\nI haven‚Äôt been so hooked on a book like I was with Intoxication in a while, I could not put it down.\n\nIt has all the feels, all the emotions and each and every connection felt so real. When everything came to ahead, it was done with such grace, I felt for each and every one of them.\n\nI can‚Äôt wait for the next book, I want this to happen and I‚Äôm so glad I was on the right path.\n\nCharlene is a new author to me and I will definitely be reading all her stuff\n\nDecember 7, 2020\n\nI'm only half way through this book....just WOW. The love triangle between these three is intense.\n\nLove it! Now back to reading!\n\nMarch 15, 2021\n\nI was recommended to this author via a cheaters romance group, and boy the princes are literally princes. A love triangle controlled by fate, will the final decision tear them all apart? A book I didn't want to put down, and can't wait for the rest of the series. HEA.\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nNovember 29, 2020\n\nIntoxication by Charlene Namdhari pushed my limits and took taboo to a new level. This seductive and complicated romance will test your heart for sure. Intriguing characters. Twisted storyline. Alluring and angsty emotions. An irresistible combination.\n\nSianna has met Rayden while helping her emoployer with his kids. She soon falls for this charming and gorgeous man. When Rayden takes her to meet his family, all hell breaks loose. His father Drake is the man she spent a sinful night with. Years ago. And she left a piece of her heart with this sexy, enigmatic and caring man during that one night. Drake couldn't forget that enticing woman either. Now what will she do? What will Drake do?\n\nThis is a love triangle and I admit I have a hard time with them. But this was very well written. And I am very impressed with the flow, the artistry and the power of the author's writing. She made me feel for every character. Sianna had a string of bad lucks that left her helpless and desolate. And she met Drake during that time and though she fled away from him, she spent some most precious and memorable time with him. Now she is at a more stable place and Rayden makes her happy and content. Drake is dark, brooding, edgy, magnificent and all consuming. Whereas Rayden is sweet, considerate, compassionate and soothing for her.\n\nThe chemistry is off the charts hot. The emotions are complex and heartbreaking. Sianna does feel a close connection with Rayden and is unwilling to hurt him. But she cannot deny the sensational and electrifying bond with Drake either. Drake had a bleak loveless married life and he dedicated himself to his kids and business. He holds so much pain and his desperate feelings when he meets Sianna again just tore my heart open. I am also so hurt for Rayden because this will be terrifyingly sad for him too. Angst fest all around.\n\nIntoxicating by Charlene Namdhari is a tantalising tale of twisted love. You need to go in with an open mind and then you will fall in love with the story.\n\nI reviewed an early copy voluntarily\n\nDecember 20, 2020\n\nMy cherry popper by Charlene and boy was it steamy in there!!\n\nEvery trigger in \"Double Step\" genre is there. A sexy retelling of Cinderella story with a twist. A chance encounter at the airport, Jimmy Choos left behind and the Prince goes looking for his Princess\n\nA one night of hot & passionate best sex they ever had later, it's sayonara Prince!!!\n\nPrincess moves on and prince is left fiddling with her beaded bracelet which he keeps close to his heart\n\nTrust me when I say my mouth hung open at the twist that I did not see coming!!!\n\nOhhhhh Daddy\n\nIt's written very well, charlene's language and word play is on the spot.\n\nI enjoyed reading it\n\n4 stars for Be careful what you wish for\n\nFollow me on:\n\nEmailüåª Bookbub üåª Twitterüåª Instagramüåª Blogüåª Facebooküåª Amazon üåª\n\nNovember 28, 2021\n\nThere is something about an unattainable target that makes things extremely hotter. So when Sienna is introduced to her future father-in-law the same man who captured her heart 2 years ago. Someone who she isn‚Äôt keen to forget‚Ä¶Mr. Drake Prince. Well it makes things much more exciting and completely unreachable, but the heart wants what the heart wants. And for Drake, when your past comes clashing down on you with the same person who has haunted your dreams since you first set eyes on her. Well consequences be damned. It‚Äôs hard to control what is meant to be even if she belongs to his son. This is what made my all nighter scorching hot worthy. üî•üî•üî•\n\nIf your looking to test your limits with a forbidden love affair and not come out of it harmed well definitely give this a try. There is plenty of swooning moments, sexy times, and illicit affairs to keep you on your toes. The book is a standalone, however the series continues with some stunning kick-ass side characters I plan to invest my time in. üíã"
