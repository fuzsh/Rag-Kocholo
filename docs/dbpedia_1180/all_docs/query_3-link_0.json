        "text": "Warning...FEEL GOOD CONTENT! One of my greatest accomplishments with TIDAL came after working at TIDAL...this is something I am very proud of. Story time... An Artist I met at the Latin Grammys (shoutout to Ghazi Shami for the introduction) and have known for around seven years is really shining right now. She has been hustling hard every day and fallen into a groove with a unique brand and sonic identity. She asked me to help her and I've been doing just that because at my core helping artists, songwriters and producers is what gets me excited about working in the music business. I asked her (as I do with everyone) if she'd signed up with TIDAL Artist Home and opted into this Collabs contest. She went and did it right away because let's face it, it's not just about the largest streaming platform, it's about diversifying and leveraging every opportunity as an artist. Fast forward, Jermaine Dupri picked two artists to collaborate who were identified using their collabs feature (basically an MLM) by looking at the match ups and listening to their music. NOTE: you have to put out good quality music and have something that grabs people's attention! She got to fly out to Atlanta and spend time with Reggie Becton, Jermaine and the TIDAL team to create a new track and it's coming and it's FIRE. What I love about the experience is that she went and did what was asked of her, she showed up prepared and with a clear vision (including beats) and went to town. She was given the advice to \"go for it more\" and I think every artist needs to hear that. Have fun enjoying the content piece that shows the journey of this opportunity as an artist and the making of the track (coming soon). In the meantime go give her a follow on IG and stream her new music dropping this Friday and reach out of there is anything you can do to support her. https://lnkd.in/ejPqspqi https://lnkd.in/e4QcEMmD https://lnkd.in/ek-hq766"
