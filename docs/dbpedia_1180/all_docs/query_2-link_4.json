        "text": "Jermaine Dupri‘s legendary So So Def Recordings has signed a multi-year agreement with Create Music Group that encompasses all of the label’s recordings, publishing and back catalog. In addition, Dupri will supervise the launch of new artists and music under the partnership and double as Create Music Group’s the newly appointed creative director.\n\nConcurrent with his new appointment, Dupri will segue from CEO of So So Def Recordings to its chairman & founder. He, in turn, has named Bryan Patrick Franklin to replace him as CEO and Joe Romulus Esq. as head of legal business affairs. In his role as creative director for Create Music Group, Dupri will work on “expanding the company’s impact on the cross-section between music and culture,” as noted in the press release announcing the news.\n\nDupri, a Grammy-winning producer and member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, stated in the release, “I have been looking for a home for the entire So So Def brand so I can continue to do what I started.” Last year, So So Def celebrated its 30th anniversary.\n\nJonathan Strauss, CEO & founder of Create Music Group, commented, “Jermaine has been one of the most successful and impactful forces in music for the last three decades. We are honored that he and his team have decided to partner with us for both his catalog and future output.”\n\nDupri’s talent as a songwriter-producer is behind such platinum and multi-platinum songs as Mariah Carey’s “We Belong Together” (which won him the Grammy for best R&B song), Usher’s “Nice & Slow,” Xscape’s “Just Kickin’ It” and his own “Money Ain’t a Thang” featuring Jay-Z. He also produced the hits “Burn” and “Confessions Part II,” from Usher’s diamond-certified Confessions album. Upon founding So So Def Recordings in 1993, Dupri helmed a roster of R&B/hip-hop and pop hitmakers that included Xscape, Da Brat, Jagged Edge and Anthony Hamilton. A DJ and the second rapper after Jay-Z to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Dupri also established the plant-based ice cream alternative JD’s Vegan."
