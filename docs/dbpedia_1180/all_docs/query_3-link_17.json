        "text": "I recently recorded a flash briefing for Pulmonary Fibrosis News that really resonated with me. A U.K. study examined the time between patients’ recognition of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) symptoms and their time-to-diagnosis. Unsurprisingly, the study revealed a lag between when symptoms were first recognized and a diagnosis of this life-threatening lung disease.\n\nWhile interacting with patients on this forum platform or via e-mail, I regularly hear that the time it takes them to receive an IPF diagnosis is lengthy. For me, it took various medical teams to confirm I had IPF and the process of determining that took 13 months. According to the results of this study, 13 months is not lengthy at all, as some patients (about 50% of those studied in the above article) took about five years to be diagnosed.\n\nWhat was the process like for you to get diagnosed with IPF/PF?\n\nHow long did it take?\n\nHi Charlene – I was in the Philippines when first diagnosed with ILD (interstitial lung disease) early October 2016 but I was sick for a month before going to the hospital for the x-ray. ILD/IPF are rare here so I did not understand the diagnosis when the doctor said ILD so I asked what is that like walking pneumonia? – Yes. That was that. Took an antibiotic that did not help much. So January 2017 I knew I had a serious lung problem and got a refill on the prescription but no help.\n\nI returned to the USA April 2018 and went to a pulmonologist in early May. She sent me for an MRI which produced the official diagnosis of IPF in June 2018. So I was increasingly symptomatic (slightly) for about 21 months before the MRI results.\n\nNow back in the Philippines since May 2019 and have had a slow progression but I do a lot of different things to help mitigate this disease. I have not used O2 since returning but there are sometimes I it would help at night.\n\nStay well – Steve\n\nIn 2011 my endocrinologist suspected I had pneumonia and sent me to a pulmonologist who, after chest X-rays and breathing tests, determined I indeed had pneumonia and also diagnosed interstitial lung disease which I understood to be scar tissue probably from pneumonia. I was supposed to follow up in a year, but our insurance changed and this doctor was no longer in network. I felt fine. My breathing was good. I cruised through five years feeling normal. I’ve always been high energy. Then about four years ago I started coughing. I have awful allergies from May through December, but I was coughing all year long. One PA suggested I had just gotten into the habit of coughing! My primary care doctor (with the knowledge of my ILD) said my lungs sounded good, couldn’t hear any crackling, and diagnosed me with with allergy onset asthma. I still felt horrible. Then I started getting worse to the point that I didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything because of my coughing – it was embarrassing and exhausting! I made appointments with an allergist and with the pulmonologist. That was in September and November of last year, 2019 and it was a high def CT scan that told the story. I do have allergies nine months out of the year, but was diagnosed with IPF by Thanksgiving. I started OFEV in mid January. Praying it does its job! So, if I had gone back to my pulmonologist sooner, I feel sure it wouldn’t have taken four years. Hindsight!\n\nIt took five years for my diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and even that was accidental. I had PE five years ago and that took several weeks to diagnose. First I was told my breathlessness was because I was fat. I went home and went on an exercise binge and a week later I couldn’t walk and my lips were blue. Then I was diagnosed with severe asthma and put on prednisolone. Then when it had no effect, my GP finally sent me to the hospital where they discovered multiple clots in both lungs. I was bed bound for two months and only able to sit up for another. A year passed and I was still constantly breathless but nobody could figure out why. Finally I became horribly ill, ended up in hospital bleeding internally and with a terrible chest infection. A scan of my kidneys crossed the bottom of my lungs – lucky for me. In the meantime, I was begging my GP to help me and asked for a lung function test. Then I was diagnosed with COPD, which I knew was wrong – it doesn’t take a genius to look up your values and find that you have a restrictive rather than an obstructive pattern. I ended up in a horrible fight with my GP and refused to leave his office until he reluctantly referred me to the hospital chest clinic several months in advance. A week later the chest clinic rang me and told me I needed an urgent appointment because of what they had seen on the scan. Finally, FINALLY, after five years I was diagnosed with ILD. The first time I went to the GP, when she told me I was fat and all I needed to do was lose 20 lbs and I’d be fine, I told her my dad had died of IPF 30 years before and I was scared because I had all the same symptoms. Why did it take so long to diagnose me? Well, let’s start with the GP’s fat phobia. Like many fat people, the minute I turn up in the GP office, everything that is wrong with me is blamed on my having a fat body. The medical profession really needs to stop it’s “war on obesity,” otherwise known as the “war on fat people.” As it happens, I was thin as a stick for almost my entire life until I broke my ankle 10 years ago, got DVT, and post-thrombotic syndrome. One would also think that a person who has had two DVTs might have PE when they can’t breathe. Anyway, that’s my story. I’m not particularly happy about the length of time it took for a diagnosis, but hey ho, that’s the way it goes.\n\nPetting my outside cat set off an asthma attack. Went to doctor and got an inhaler. Did not get better. Dr ordered an exray and something was seen. Next got a cat scan and was told I had IPF, go to pulmonary dr.\n\nI did. He confirmed the diagnosis and said come back in two weeks. Scheduled lots of blood tests, pulmonary\n\ntests. I asked where exactly was the scarring? He said we will do a biopsy. Come back in 4 months! Just don’t feel I am getting much information. What are we waiting for? Have read they don’t do biopsy unless they aren’t sure of cause. I am in Limbo, hoping, praying it could be something else. I know I have “something” wrong in my lungs, I can feel it. Feels like pneumonia. No wheezing yet.But, Oxygen levels are in the 90’s and have dipped when I am exercising. I walk and I have no cough. I have an oximeter and practice breathing with a spirometer. Usually 2500 ml volume. My joints do ache in the morning. Doctor just didn’t give me the findings from breath tests. Why not? Says I am highly allergic to bird feathers. Could it be something else? Got rid of my down pillows and comforter. Going to a new doctor next week. I just feel I am sitting on a powder keg waiting!!!! Any suggestions??\n\nMy diagnosis, like Jill T’s, was sort of accidental too. Although I had talked to my doctor about some shortness of breath on exertion, we felt it was due to all the usual suspects:age, weight and allergies. It did respond somewhat to allergy medications, so I really can’t blame the doctor. However, a few months later I had a strange recurring pain in my right ear/jaw area that traveled into my back and chest. I was sent for an x-ray and when the technician said something about my being there for changes in my emphysema (?!) I knew we were in a whole different field. I was somewhat shocked at that because although I had been a smoker for several years, I had NOT been one for over 28 years. Went back to the doctor and was referred to a pulmonologist who saw me and mentioned he thought it might be ILD, but the hospital was closing his office in town and moving him that very Friday! This meant time for another referral, which took about six weeks before I could see someone (insurance was another issue here) and she concurred about the emphysema but thought we could “wait and see” about the scarring in my lungs since there wasn’t much visible. It was another 14 months before the diagnosis was conclusive. About par for the course, it seems, or maybe a little better than some. I believe part of the issue here is a lot of older patients like myself don’t question their doctors very much. Our own education is lacking, which adds to the problem. I am now on Esbriet and seem to be in a stable place, for which I am grateful. Karen\n\nHi Wendy,\n\nWow, thank you so much for sharing your journey to diagnosis with us, but I am so sorry to hear of your experience! Oddly enough, I just had a conversation with a friend who also was “fat shamed” recently at a doctor’s appointment regarding her restrictive airway disease. It was just awful, and I’m sorry you also had a similar experience, especially when something was obviously wrong! Did that original doctor ever find out your final diagnosis of HP or did you cross paths with him/her again? An apology is certainly warranted! Glad you’ve found peace and contentment with you body. I always say, “its the only one we’re going to get”, so I try to treat it right but also enjoy some favourite foods that aren’t always healthy. It’s about balance! 🙂\n\nThanks for writing and take good care.\n\nCharlene.\n\n@charlene-marshall\n\nHi Charlene – That is really good news about the ccp virus for you (I call it that because of what the leadership has caused – and I watched a 9-part documentary about the roots of the ccp and it is bad). So not to wax political but my observations and other think tank conversations warn us about the ccp. So I do hope a full recovery for you as there are potentially lots of future complications. I just know that if I get the virus, I cannot survive over here. Seems we might be here a long time as the world experiences a flare-up.\n\nAre you using EGCG? It has helped me and seems similar to Wei labs. Since I have no real doctor over here, I feel blessed to have access to the internet for research and this terrific forum here. I am still using Serrapeptase, Nattokinase, B complex and D vitamins (D3 with K2 M7), started EGCG a few weeks ago. I have some zinc and quercetin and azithromycin just in case. These things plus the hot lemon juice and a small amount of raw smashed garlic do help a lot. So no O2, or scripts for the lungs.\n\nI hope your PFT’s exceed your expectations for the better.\n\nStay well – Steve\n\nHi Steve,\n\nThanks so much for writing, and yes I agree, we’re certainly learning a lot more about the virus and its long term impact as people recover. I’m curious to see what my PFTs reveal, and then I have other appointments set up as well. They’re still learning so much about this virus. I hope you can continue to stay well, as much as being in lockdown is a pain, it’s definitely important.\n\nI’m not using EGCG … yet. I’m glad it has helped you, and I am considering taking it based on the project we’re looking to take on here at PF News. I actually had a video call on Friday with Dr. Chapman out of UCSF who is one of the lead researchers on the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study. Glad the other things you’re taking have helped, and that you continue to do your research!\n\nTake care,\n\nCharlene."
