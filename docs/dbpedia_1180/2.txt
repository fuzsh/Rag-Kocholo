Revisit the records from some of the hottest artists in hip-hop and r&b.

Established in the early 90s, Jermaine Dupri's iconic So So Def Recording label has become synonymous with groundbreaking talent and chart-topping hits. Throughout the years, the label has developed diverse artists, Xscape, Lil Bow Wow, and Kriss Kross, and produced timeless music that resonates with audiences from all over.

At this year's “BET Hip Hop Awards,” we celebrated not just 50 years of one of the best music genres but also three decades of a record label that has contributed significantly to the art form with performances from its founder Dupri and several former label stars.
