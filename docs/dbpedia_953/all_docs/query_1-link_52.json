        "text": "Background\n\nNephropathic cystinosis (NC) is the prototype disorder for lysosomal transporter protein defects. CTNS gene mutations cause deficiency of cystinosin, the protein that transports cystine out of the lysosomes, resulting in the accumulation and crystallization of cystine in virtually all body cells. NC patients are asymptomatic at birth and usually develop normally during the first six months of life, where after they start to present with renal Fanconi syndrome. If not treated, renal failure invariably develops within the first decade of life [1].\n\nThe aminothiol cysteamine is the only specific treatment known today. It depletes lysosomal cystine through the formation of cysteine and the mixed disulfide cysteamine-cysteine complex which exits the lysosome via an intact PQLC2-transporter [2]. Cysteamine slows down the deterioration of the kidney function and postpones or even prevents extra-renal damage [1].\n\nElevated white blood cell (WBC) cystine concentration is the diagnostic cornerstone, as the pathognomonic corneal cystine crystals can frequently be missed in children younger than 18 months and genetic testing usually takes a longer time [3]. WBC cystine assay was introduced by Oshima et al. who used [14C] cystine and E.coli cystine-binding protein [4]. Currently most laboratories switched to HPLC [5] or LC-MS/MS [6] methods to avoid working with radioactivity. While biochemical cystine determination can be well-standardized, the major source of imprecision is attributed to the WBC isolation and storage [7]. Furthermore, blood for cystine assay must be taken six hours after the last cysteamine dose which is not always clinically feasible. Finally, it is currently unknown whether WBC cystine levels adequately represent cystine accumulation in tissues.\n\nChitotriosidase was first associated with marked lysosomal storage in Gaucher’s disease patients [8]. Later its elevation was detected in many other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) [9] and also in multiple other diseases as β-thalassemia [10] and sarcoidosis [11].\n\nDue to the absence of its natural substrate (chitin) in mammals and its secretion mainly by activated macrophages, chitotriosidase was rapidly linked to innate immunity as a defense mechanism against chitin coated pathogens [12]. However, its elevation in response to storage and chronic inflammatory disorders clarified its other nature as a marker of macrophage activation.\n\nDespite the fact that about 6% of Caucasians have complete enzyme deficiency due to homozygosity to the 24-bp duplication mutation at exon 10 of the chitotriosidase gene (CHIT1) [13], plasma chitotriosidase activity has been established as a screening marker and therapeutic monitor for enzyme replacement therapy in Gaucher’s disease [14]. Further studies reported the validity of the clinical use of chitotriosidase activity in the screening of other lysosomal disorders as Niemann-Pick disease and Gangliosidosis M1 [15] and for therapeutic monitoring of male Fabry patients [16]. Recently, chitotriosidase elevation was documented in a case-report of nephropathic cystinosis [17], and it was suggested that it could be of value in monitoring cysteamine therapy.\n\nIn the current study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of plasma chitotriosidase activity for the clinical screening and therapeutic monitoring of NC patients. As a proof of principle we tested our hypothesis on the cellular level in control human macrophages and in the plasma of the murine cystinotic model.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMacrophage activation has been previously reported in many LSDs. Although exact mechanisms are largely unknown, this might reflect the altering signaling pathways in response to storage materials [19]. Furthermore, different types of crystals such as calcium oxalate [18] and monosodium urate [20] were shown to stimulate human macrophages. Tissue macrophages harboring cystine crystals have been demonstrated in cystinotic patients long ago [21,22]. Several immune enhancing molecules such as interferon-gamma, TNF-α and lipopolysaccharide have all been shown to stimulate chitotriosidase expression in human macrophages [23]. We hypothesized that in analogy to other crystal types cystine crystals are not inert structures; they tend to activate macrophages and as a consequence of the elicited activation, chitotriosidase release can be detected clinically and confirmed experimentally.\n\nIn our study, apart from a single newly-diagnosed cystinotic patient homozygous for the chitotriosidase deficiency mutation, there was no overlap in chitotriosidase values between the other twelve newly-diagnosed (8 in the study group and 4 naïve patients) and age-matched controls (39 in the study group and 9 naïve patients). This indicates that chitotriosidase can be a helpful guide in suspected individuals when WBC cystine measurement is not immediately available, at least to prioritize patients as high or low risk till properly diagnosed.\n\nMany poorly controlled cystinotic patients achieved very high chitotriosidase activities (Figure ); the highest value (3880 nmol/ml/h, 216 folds the median value of normal controls) was observed in an eight years old Egyptian boy with ESRD who died shortly after this measurement. The median chitotriosidase value in the 45 cystinotic patients was about 10 folds the median of normal controls. Apart from Gaucher’s disease which has extremely high chitotriosidase values few other LSDs achieve moderately high values comparable to cystinosis, especially sphingolipidoses as Niemann-Pick, GM1 and Krabbe [15,24].\n\nEuropean patients were generally much better therapeutically controlled than Egyptian patients. There was no major difference in the severity of responsible mutations as most mutations were truncating in both cohorts; however, this difference in therapeutic response might be due to the delayed diagnosis and suboptimal therapeutic doses of cysteamine in Egyptian patients given the financial and logistical constraints in providing this orphan drug in a developing country [25]. This was evident from WBC cystine levels in each group. As it could be expected, chitotriosidase activities were much lower in European patients in accordance with the proposed role of chitotriosidase as an alternative therapeutic monitor.\n\nWhen compared to WBC cystine, plasma chitotriosidase is much easier, faster, more economic, stable and needs a much smaller sample (1 ml or less) which is more convenient in young children. Furthermore, WBC cystine is not the perfect measure of therapeutic response, as polymorphonuclear leucocytes harboring cystine are short living cells (≈12 hours); therefore, WBC cystine represents relatively a short time of therapeutic control. Hypothetically, if a patient complies strictly with cysteamine treatment a few days before the assay, he may appear properly controlled regardless of previous compliance status. Chitotriosidase, on the other hand, is produced by macrophages which are longer living cells (months to years), and therefore should provide a better notion about therapeutic response over a longer time period. For confirming this statement a more extended longitudinal study is currently underway to better correlate clinical course under cysteamine therapy with chitotriosidase levels.\n\nIn newly-diagnosed patients, although chitotriosidase levels were significantly higher than age-matched controls; there was a poor correlation with WBC cystine in cases diagnosed below two years of age. This could be explained by the relative immaturity of human macrophages in infants and young children [26] and better preservation of kidney function, therefore necessitating cautious interpretation of chitotriosidase levels in this age group.\n\nTwo of our patients (2/45 or 4.4%) were homozygous for the 24-bp duplication mutation in accordance with the previously reported prevalence [13]. The third patient having values below the detection limit (A properly controlled 2 years old European child) was heterozygous. The second sample taken few months later showed higher level of chitotriosidase (within the enzyme detectable range) that also corresponded with a higher WBC cystine value.\n\nWe have to stress here that chitotriosidase activity will not replace the WBC cystine assay in NC diagnosis; however, we believe that it is a useful clinical screening test and a promising therapeutic monitor. Concerns about false negative screening when the CHIT1 gene is homozygously mutated can be met with setting a lower cut-off limit for the assay, below which the chitotriosidase result is considered of no value and the suspected patient should proceed anyway to WBC cystine assay or to molecular diagnosis.\n\nAlthough three of our newly diagnosed patients were heterozygous for the CHIT1 mutation, their plasma chitotriosidase activities (78, 122 and 138 nmol/ml/h) were clearly above their age-matched controls (0–49 nmol/ml/h, n = 39). Furthermore, recent evidence in Gaucher’s disease implies that chitotriosidase activities in the heterozygous patients, although significantly decreased compared to the wild-type, respond to treatment in a very similar way. Chitotriosidase activities in the wild type Gaucher’s patients after one year of starting enzyme replacement therapy decreased by 79 ± 13% of base line values, while in a similar cohort of heterozygous patients the percent of decrease was also similar 77 ± 16% [27]. Likewise, Gaucher patients with the common CHIT1 polymorphism p.G102S were reported to have a similar decline in chitotriosidase activity in response to optimal enzyme replacement therapy (72 ± 18% in the heterozygous and 76 ± 20% in the homozygous) [27].\n\nWe noticed significant elevations in chitotriosidase activity in control subjects with ESRD compared to normal pediatric and adult controls (P < 0.001). This could be explained by the fact that macrophage infiltration of renal tissue is a common feature of most human chronic kidney disease and that pathogenic M1 subpopulations are implicated in the pathology of renal fibrosis [28]. However, chitotriosidase levels in ESRD controls were still much lower compared to NC patients with the same degree of renal disease because macrophage activation in cystinosis is a global pathology and not just restricted to the kidney.\n\nThere are two possible mechanisms of macrophage activation by cystine in cystinotic patients. The first is the gradual accumulation of cystine inside macrophages up to crystallization because macrophages also have cystinosin defect and cannot get rid of their lysosomal cystine similar to other cell types. The second mechanism is the engulfment of dying and apoptotic cells in different tissues with ready formed cystine crystals inside or around these cells and because macrophages have the same pathology they cannot dissolve these phagocytized crystals.\n\nWe tried to address both mechanisms initially and used cystine dimethyl ester (CDME) as a rapid loading molecule of cystine into cultured macrophages; however, this molecule was toxic to macrophages and we couldn’t achieve our target with non-toxic levels. Using patients macrophages was not feasible because of the high amount of blood required for the experiments. Thus, we addressed the second mechanism through the direct incubation of control human macrophages with different concentrations of cystine crystals in-vitro and succeeded in demonstrating the phagocytosis of cystine crystals, the activation of macrophages only by the crystals and the release of chitotriosidase enzyme.\n\nTNF-α, being an established marker of macrophage activation and a direct stimulant of chitotriosidase release [23], was measured sequentially in the supernatant of macrophages exposed to cystine crystals. TNF-α quantified response was correlated with the crystal concentration used (Figure ), denoting the evident activation of macrophages upon exposure and engulfment of crystals. Macrophage activation was further confirmed through the elevation of chitotriosidase activity in both supernatant and cell-lysate. In fact, this was demonstrated in control macrophages that were capable of processing cystine, while in-vivo this stimulation might be even more pronounced in cystinotic macrophages.\n\nRecently, Principe et al. attributed NC with the inflammasome system activation and argued that the inflammation caused by cystine crystals could be responsible for the rapid progression to ESRD in cystinosis unlike other types of hereditary Fanconi syndromes [29]. Similar observation was made by Knauf et al. who demonstrated the importance of the inflammasome mediator NALP3 in the renal injury and fatality of mice with oxalate nephropathy [30]. Okamura et al. further elucidated the role of cysteamine treatment in reducing macrophage accumulation in the renal interstitium of mice exposed to chronic renal injury and reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species in these macrophages [31]. Thus, the clinical assessment of macrophage activation in NC as an indicator of disease activity and/or therapeutic response seems to be a promising approach. Measuring chitotriosidase activity in that regard has many advantages compared to other circulating cytokines, especially that the enzyme is long-living and very stable, thus, less affected by acute infections or immunosuppressive drugs and it can be also measured in blood spots [32].\n\nThe significant elevation of plasma chitotriosidase in Ctns(−/−) mice indicates that its correlation with cystinosis is not species specific. Although the median value for the diseased was only double that of the wild-type, this might refer to the shorter duration of the pathological process and the relatively lower differential number of activated macrophages in mice [33].\n\nThe recent successful treatment of the murine cystinotic model by bone marrow cell transplantation [34] and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy [35], if proven successful in human patients, will have a powerful impact on the disease therapeutic strategy. However, the problem on how to evaluate the patient’s response post-transplantation is not yet solved as estimating cystine accumulation in tissue biopsies is too invasive for routine follow-up and measuring cystine in the donor’s WBCs is useless. Chitotriosidase, on the other hand, is rapid and non-invasive. When compared to a base-line level it would represent the activity of the recipient’s tissue macrophages and would be a reasonable indicator of total body cystine load. Notably, chitotriosidase enzyme was reported to show significant declines in response to successful bone marrow transplantation in Gaucher’s disease [14] and in β-thalassemia major [36]."
