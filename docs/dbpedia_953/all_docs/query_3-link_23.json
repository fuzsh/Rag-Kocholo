        "text": "The driver of a tow truck involved in a multivehicle crash that lead to the death of a 25-year-old man turned himself in Monday, according to Dallas County authorities.\n\nJuan Francisco Garcia, 25, turned himself in Monday to the county jail after his red tow truck was recovered, Dallas County sheriff spokesman Douglas Sisk said.\n\nGarcia faces one felony charge each of an accident involving serious bodily injury and tampering with evidence, authorities said. He was released from jail Tuesday afternoon on $22,500 bail, according to Sisk. It was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney.\n\nDallas County sheriff deputies responded to the crash about 2:20 a.m. Aug. 13. A red tow truck hit a minivan on Interstate 30 near 2nd Avenue and did not stop, authorities said. The minivan spun into oncoming traffic.\n\nDonald Collins, 25, got out of his car to help the passengers of the minivan. As he was doing so, an SUV struck him and the van.\n\nCollins died at the hospital. An unidentified passenger in the van was taken to the hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries.\n\nRelated:‘My husband is in heaven’: Wife of good Samaritan killed in Dallas crash speaks out\n\nThe driver of the SUV, a 2017 Chevrolet Tahoe, was arrested. Irma Nelly Martinez, 33, faces charges including intoxication manslaughter and intoxication assault with a vehicle. She remains in the Dallas County jail, and her bail is set at $135,000.\n\nIt was not clear whether she has an attorney. Jail records show she has an immigration hold."
