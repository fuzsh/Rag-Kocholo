        "text": "Kaitlan Collins and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) covered a wide gamut of political topics on CNN’s “The Source” Wednesday night including former President Donald Trump’s 2016 attacks on the senator, Nikki Haley announcing that she would vote for Trump, and whether Cruz will accept the results of the 2024 election.\n\nCollins currently hosts “The Source” (airing weeknights at 8 p.m. central) where she interviews high-profile political figures including U.S. presidential candidates. Cruz ran for president in 2016, winning 12 states in the primary before ultimately conceding the nomination to Trump.\n\nThings got a little heated when the Prattville native pressed Cruz on the election topic, as they debated the 2020 race results in which President Joe Biden defeated Trump, with Cruz insisting voter fraud took place while Collins said there were no instances that would have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nREAD: Prattville native Kaitlan Collins: Alabama libraries should not be ‘political battlegrounds’\n\n“Of course there was fraud in 2020,” Cruz told Collins.\n\n“No there wasn’t, and you still objected,” she said.\n\n“Oh you know for a fact there was zero voter fraud?” Cruz asked. “Really? What’s your basis for that? Show me your evidence.”\n\n“There was no voter fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election, and you know that, senator,” Collins said.\n\nCruz cited the aftermath of the 1876 election (won by Rutherford B. Hayes) as a precedent for 2020, in which he says voter fraud occurred, as he then attempted to turn the tables on Collins, quizzing her on what happened in that 19th century race. “Can you answer my question? Why are you refusing to answer my question?” he asked.\n\n“I’m conducting the interview, with all due respect, senator,” she said.\n\nIn 2021, Cruz and other Republicans proposed that Congress delay action for 10 days to let an electoral commission audit the 2020 election results and investigate voter fraud claims in the contested states. More than two dozen legal challenges filed to contest the election results failed, many of them dismissed in court.\n\nCruz attempted to elaborate before Collins pressed him to move on.\n\n“You asked me a question. Do you want me to answer it?” he said. “You didn’t answer the question,” Collins said.\n\nEarlier in the interview, Collins noted Cruz was the first senator to object to the 2020 election results before then-Vice President Mike Pence certified the votes. Cruz took issue when she asked him if he will accept the 2024 election results regardless of who wins.\n\n“So, Kaitlan, I gotta say, I think that’s actually a ridiculous question,” Cruz said. Collins said “it’s a yes or no question,” while Cruz disagreed and asked Collins about Democrats challenging past presidential election results. She said the situations are not comparable, in that the country has previously never seen a sitting president refuse to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.\n\n“We did have a peaceful transfer of power,” Cruz said, while Collins responded, “Barely.”\n\nCruz said the country has an election law system people use to challenge and sometimes overturn elections before blaming media for insisting “no voter fraud ever existed.”\n\n“If the Democrats win, I’m going to accept the result, but I’m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,” Cruz said.\n\nCollins also asked Cruz why he supported Trump after the former president launched personal attacks against the Texas senator and his family.\n\n“I knew then it was lies,” Cruz said. “It was lies then, it’s lies now. At the end of the day, I’m a big boy. Listen, if I were a private citizen, I could decide my feelings are hurt and I’m just gonna leave. But if I do that, I can’t do my job, and I care about my job.”\n\nCollins asked Cruz about the tactics Trump used to rise to the presidency. “I don’t like them, I can’t stand them,” he said. “I think Donald Trump is a unique character in American history. There are things he says and does that I like. There are things he says and does that I don’t like.”\n\nShe cited a Cruz quote from the 2016 election cycle wherein he criticized Trump’s rhetoric before asking the senator if he feels differently now. “He says all sorts of things I wish he didn’t say,” Cruz said. “I value civility in politics. I think we should treat each other with respect even if we disagree with each other. I can’t control what other people say. I can’t control what other Republicans say, I can’t control what other Democrats say.”\n\nWatch the full CNN interview.\n\nIn 2023, CNN announced Collins would take over the network’s 8 p.m. central primetime slot, previously occupied by Chris Cuomo whom the network fired in December 2021. The news came after the Alabama native moderated CNN’s Republican town hall with former President Donald Trump that month in New Hampshire. Collins’ handling of the event divided critics and viewers, while Variety and Puck reported CNN planned give her the primetime slot permanently after publicly supporting her performance at the town hall.\n\nCollins became CNN’s youngest-ever chief White House correspondent seven years ago at age 29. “Since joining CNN in 2017, she has become one of the most influential journalists in the nation due to her tough questions, objective reporting and signature style,” a CNN release said. “Kaitlan has broken numerous stories of consequence from both the Biden and Trump administrations, including significant policy decisions and major staff changes, traveling the globe extensively to report on their presidencies. Collins has also reported on the Senate special election in her home state of Alabama.”\n\nCollins replaced Jim Acosta as chief White House correspondent in 2021. When she joined the network in 2017, Collins covered the Trump White House and quickly rose to the top of her field. She covered Biden for a year-and-a-half before she became co-anchor of “CNN This Morning.”\n\nCollins is from Prattville and graduated from the University of Alabama in 2014."
