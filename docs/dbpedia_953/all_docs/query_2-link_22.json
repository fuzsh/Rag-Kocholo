Karger AG, Basel\n\nThis article is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC). Usage and distribution for commercial purposes requires written permission.\n\nThere are no national glomerulonephritis registries in South-Asia and, therefore, most reports on the epidemiology of glomerular disease are based on single- or multicenter retrospective studies of kidney biopsy registries. IgAN is reported in 10% to 15% of all kidney biopsies in this region1. India is the second-most populous country and the Global Burden of Disease study 20152 ranks chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the eighth leading cause of death.\n\nGlomerular Research and Clinical Experiments-IgA Nephropathy in Indians (GRACE-IgANI) is the first prospective South Asian IgAN cohort with protocolized follow-up and extensive biosample collection.3 201 incident adults with kidney biopsy-proven primary IgAN were recruited into GRACE-IgANI between March 2015 and September 2017. As of September 2020, the cohort had completed 3-year longitudinal follow-up.\n\nThe important symptomatic presentation is ‘Young Hypertension’ with/ without pedal edema. Visual disturbance was an important symptom complex associated with accelerated hypertension. There is no universal screening in South Asia and the health expenses are not borne by the state in most countries of the South Asian region. The vast majority of young hypertensives in South Asia are not screened for underlying CKD. Introduction of a simple screening test such as a urine dipstick for hematuria and proteinuria in this population is likely to be a cost-effective public health strategy. Common symptoms of recurrent visible hematuria associated with a synpharyngitic illness seen in other parts of the world were uncommon in this population. 34% had nephrotic range proteinuria at presentation without significant hypoalbuminaemia. This is unlike other primary nephrotic syndromes like minimal change disease and FSGS.4\n\nThe median time to nephrologist visits and renal biopsy from onset of any symptom or from detection of abnormal laboratory parameters was <6 months. The overwhelming impression from reviewing the GRACE-IgANI kidney biopsy data was a disproportionate absence of active glomerular lesions and over- representation of segmental sclerosing lesions and tubulointerstitial fibrosis at presentation, often coexistent with relatively well-preserved eGFR and low levels of proteinuria. It was interesting to note that the traditionally benign manifestation of visible hematuria with synpharyngitic illness was frequently accompanied by hypertension (15/20, 75%) and the presence of fibrotic lesions (S1 [13/18, 70.2%] and T1/T2 [11/18, 61.1%]). Even incidentally diagnosed clinically “mild” IgAN was associated with a significant number of fibrotic lesions (S1 [11/16, 68.8%] and T1/T2 [10/16, 62.5%]).4\n\nIn IgAN patients with proteinuria <1g per day, there were already signs of significant kidney damage in this group, with 21% (9/44) having E1 lesions, 57% (25/44) S1 lesions, 57% (25/44) T1/T2 lesions, and 20% GS (IQR 0-42). Even in the 24 patients with eGFR >60 ml/ min per 1.73 m2, there was still a significant burden of established kidney damage (24% [5/21] E1 lesions; 38% [8/21] S1 lesions; 19% [25/44] T1/T2 lesions; 0% GS). This may reflect the postulated low nephron number in South Asians, which results in an increased risk of both hypertension and CKD due to glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy, with intraglomerular hypertension resulting in further nephron loss and reduced sodium excretory capacity. Alternatively, there may be a specific fibrotic response to mesangial IgA deposition in South Asians.4\n\nDespite optimized supportive care and use of systemic corticosteroids, at 3 years 40% of the GRACE-IgANI cohort displayed rapid CKD progression (≥5 ml/min/1.73m2/year fall in eGFR) and 37% experienced the composite outcome defined as ≥50% fall in eGFR (CKD EPI) from baseline, eGFR (CKD EPI) <15ml/min/1.73m2, commencement of kidney replacement therapy or death (manuscript under review and poster ID 33).\n\nWhen time to kidney survival was stratified by proteinuria over 6 months of follow-up, achieving less than <1g/day significantly increased kidney survival in patients treated with short course of oral steroids along with RASB.\n\nA Cox proportional-hazards model (−2 Log Likelihood= 239.9, Chi square=42.8 (4), p<0.001) identified MEST-T2 score at baseline (HR 4.3, 95% C.I. 2-9.2, p<0.001), Hb ≤ 12 g/dL at 6 months (HR 2.3, 95% C.I. 1.1-4.8, p=0.02), combined 24-hour urine protein ≥1 g/day at 6 months and serum albumin ≤ 4 g/dL at 1 year (HR 2.3, 95% C.I. 1.1-4.6, p=0.02) and fall in eGFR ≥5 ml/min/1.73m2 at one year (HR 3.8, 95% C.I. 1.9-7.8, p<0.001) as significant predictors for Composite Outcome at 3 years.\n\nDecline in eGFR (CKD-EPI) ≥5ml/min/1.73m2 in the first year following kidney biopsy had 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity for predicting the CO over a 3-year period and that this measure could in the future be used to better inform patients, plan for renal replacement therapy and select patients for clinical trials or direct more intensive immunosuppression (manuscript under review and poster ID 33).\n\nWhile this study was not designed to formally validate the risk prediction tool in an Indian population our initial assessment of the performance of the tool in GRACE-IgANI has revealed that the IIGANN risk prediction tool5 underestimates the actual risk of the CO in an Indian population. It is worth noting that South Asian patients were not included in the development or validation of this model.\n\nIncreased mean positivity per glomeruli of C3d deposition was seen with chronicity scores MEST-C (S1, T1/T2) and associated with composite outcome. Unlike C3d, glomerular C4d and glomerular deposition of C5b-9, did not have any significant longitudinal associations in the GRACE-IgANI cohort.\n\nSerum Gd-IgA1 as measured by KM55 ELISA6 was not a diagnostic marker for IgAN in GRACE-IgANI cohort but serum Gd-IgA1/serum IgA ratio had significant baseline and longitudinal associations in this cohort. There was significant decrease in longitudinally measured serum Gd-IgA1 at one year with short course of oral steroids treatment. Change in serum Gd-IgA1 at one year and two years paralleled the decrease in serum IgA. A Cox proportional-hazards model (−2 Log Likelihood ratio =298.6, Chi square=44.7 (4) p <0.001) identified serum Gd-IgA1/serum IgA ratio >2ug/mg*100 (median cut-off) [HR 2.1, 95% C.I (1.14.2), p=0.02], MEST-T2 score [HR 3.5, 95% C.I (1.6-7.3), p=0.001], 24-hour urine protein <1 g/day at 6 months [HR 2.4, 95% C.I (1.1-5.1), p=0.02], rate of eGFR decline at 6 months ≥5 ml/min/1.73m2 per year [HR 2.9, 95% C.I (1.5-5.5), p=0.001] as significant predictors for Composite Outcome at 3 years (Poster ID 31).\n\nPreliminary analyses in 40 patients at baseline show that there is significant increase in inflammatory makers (hsCRP, TNF RI, CD27, BCMA). There was significant association between baseline inflammatory markers (TNF-R1, CD27 & BCMA) and CO at 3 years whereas baseline elevated hsCRP levels showed a global decrease over time. Placebo-controlled trial in this high-risk population entails ethical dilemmas hence assessing the known impact of IS on surrogate end-points can potentially guide rational therapy (Poster ID 36).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Until recently, there has been no validated tool to accurately predict the risk of disease progression in individual patients near the time of disease diagnosis at biopsy. Previous efforts to develop prediction models in IgAN have been limited by a lack of large international multi-ethnic databases to support this type of research. The International IgAN Network assembled an international collaboration of researchers to merge existing databases with the goal of developing the first accurate method for individual-patient risk stratification in IgAN2. This collaborative effort resulted in the International IgAN Prediction Tool, which can accurately predict the future risk of a 50% decline in eGFR or ESKD in adult patients with IgAN2. The Prediction Tool uses predictor variables readily available in clinical practice near the time biopsy, including age, eGFR, proteinuria, blood pressure, MEST histology scores, prior use of immunosuppression and RAS-blockade medications, and ethnicity. The Prediction Tool has undergone several external validation analyses, and is now the recommended method of risk stratification according to the updated KDIGO guidelines3, 4. Mobile-app or web-based based calculators for the Prediction Tool can be accessed through Calculate by QxMD at www.qxcalc.app.link/igarisk.\n\nThe Prediction Tool should not be considered “static” and instead is an open-source model that can be used by any researcher to improve risk stratification in IgAN. Since its development, several questions have been raised about how the Prediction Tool can be further improved. Can the Prediction Tool be applied at later time points in the disease course other than at biopsy? Can the Prediction Tool be updated for use in other populations, such as children with IgAN? Can new predictors of disease progression be added to the Prediction Tool, such as biomarkers?\n\nThe Prediction Tool comprises two Cox proportional hazards survival models, one that includes Japanese, Chinese and White ethnicity as a predictor variable and one that does not so that it can be used in other ethnic groups2. Each model can be simplified as having two parts: 1) a baseline survival function which provides a baseline level of risk upon which each patient's individual predictor values can sequentially add personalized risk of disease progression; and 2) a group of beta-coefficients that determine how much risk is associated with each predictor value when added to the baseline survival5. Both of these parts, the baseline survival function and the beta-coefficients, are provided in detail in the supplementary tables of the original Prediction Tool publication, and can be used by researchers to update the models for use in new settings or populations, or to evaluate the added benefit of new predictor variables2, 6.\n\nThe original Prediction Tool was developed to be used in adults at the time of biopsy. However, there are other populations or settings for which we may want to also consider using the Prediction Tool. To investigate this, we need a new dataset that contains the relevant versions of the predictor and outcome variables from the Prediction Tool but that are appropriate for the new population under consideration. The first step is to evaluate the performance of the original Prediction Tool in this dataset without any modification or updating. If this prediction performance proves to be inadequate, then this suggests that the original Prediction Tool may require some form of updating to be used in the new population or setting. This can be accomplished by updating either the baseline survival function, or some or all the beta-coefficients, using the new dataset6. There are several methods that can be used to accomplish this depending on the amount of data available6. Irrespective of the methods used, the updated Prediction Tool models will be considered “new” models that themselves will require additional external validation in separate datasets.\n\nAn example of a new population to consider is asking whether the original Prediction Tool could also be used in children with IgAN. This was evaluated using a collaboration of merged cohorts from pediatric centres in Europe, China, Japan and North America7. Compared to adults with IgAN who have a linear rate of eGFR decline, children have a unique eGFR trajectory over time that tends to improve until adolescence then decline thereafter. As a result, the original Prediction Tool models did not perform well in children. Consequently, the outcome was modified to a 30% reduction in eGFR or ESKD, and the baseline survival and beta-coefficients were updated using the pediatric dataset. The updated pediatric Prediction Tool models were then able to accurately predict the risk of a 30% decline in eGFR or ESKD in children with IgAN. Another unpublished example is evaluating whether the Prediction Tool can be used in adults at later time points after biopsy. This was investigated using the international collaboration of adult datasets to apply the Prediction Tool one year after biopsy. This work is ongoing but suggests that the original Prediction Tool models require time-updating to be used accurately one year after biopsy.\n\nWe may also want to consider whether new predictor variables added to the Prediction Tool can improve risk stratification. This requires a dataset that contains that same predictor and outcome variables as the original Prediction Tool as well as the new predictor variable under consideration. In this situation, the beta-coefficients from the original Prediction Tool models are left unchanged, but the new predictor variable is added to the models (with its associated beta-coefficient) and a new baseline survival function is estimated6. The updated Prediction Tool models with the new predictor can then be compared to the original models to see if there is an improvement in prediction performance suggesting benefit from the addition of the new predictor variable8. Similar to above, the updated Prediction Tool models that contain the new predictor variable will be considered “new” models that require additional external validation in separate datasets. An example of this approach is a study that evaluated kidney biopsy tissue expression of microRNA-150-5p, which was added to the original Prediction Tool models and resulted in non-significant increases in C-statistics9. This same methodology can be applied to any predictor variable of interest, including biomarkers, pathology lesions, genetics, or clinical parameters.\n\nThe International IgAN Prediction Tool can now provide accurate patient-level risk stratification at the time of biopsy. Details of the Prediction Tool are publicly available, and there is a clear framework by which researchers can use this information to build upon and improve the Prediction Tool to further advance personalized risk-prediction in IgAN.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

[PubMed] [Google Scholar]\n\n7(Suppl 1): 9–10.\n\nRNA interference in IgA nephropathy\n\nThe Mayer Professor of Renal Medicine, University of Leicester, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK\n\nFor many years most RNA research focused on messenger RNAs (mRNA) as the key intermediaries in the translation of DNA gene sequences into proteins, and apart from ribosomal (rRNA) and transfer RNAs (tRNA) which play central roles in protein synthesis, other ‘non-coding’ RNAs (ncRNAs) were overlooked as by-products of transcription. Investigations in the late 1970s using single stranded oligonucleotide antisense therapy to manipulate gene expression at best delivered modest results but serendipitously led to the discovery that double-stranded ncRNAs had potent suppressive effects on mRNA transcription. This breakthrough launched a revolutionary new age of RNA interference (RNAi) which has transformed basic biological research as well as translational medicine.\n\nRNAi pathways are naturally found in all living organisms, regulating and fine-tuning gene transcription and post transcriptional processes, as well contributing to genome organisation and stability. But the fact that synthetic double-stranded ncRNAs can be introduced into cultured cells as well as whole living organisms to selectively suppress transcription has made them invaluable tools in basic biology research, biotechnology and medicine.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRs) are small ncRNA which negatively regulate gene expression, regulating physiological processes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and development. Dysregulated miR expression has been associated with the patho-physiology of a variety of diseases, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus and kidney disease. A recognition that miRs influence the function of all segments of the nephron and that dysregulation occurs at all stages of kidney disease from disease onset to the final common pathways of CKD progression explains the intense interest in studying miRs as minimally invasive biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.\n\nUse of both microarray analysis and high throughput RNA sequencing have reported differential expression of a number of miRs in the kidneys, serum, urine and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with IgAN compared to healthy subjects. We have recently demonstrated in frozen kidney biopsy cores that five miRs −204, 150, 146b, 155 and 135a are differentially expressed in IgAN patients with the progressive form of the disease compared to those with stable IgAN and correlate with clinical parameters associated with progression including eGFR, proteinuria, and MEST-C scores. Moreover, addition of each miR increases the discrimination score of the International IgAN Prediction Tool. Studies in PBMC have separately identified two miRs that are differential expressed in IgAN and target core 1 (31,3 galactosyltransferase (miR-148) and N-acetyl-galactosyltransferase 2 (miR-let-7b), two key enzymes involved in IgA1 O-glycosylation. Urine is one of the least invasive of available biological samples and is therefore a highly convenient tissue to study and not surprisingly, the number of miR analysis studies performed in urine is rising exponentially. While it does appear that urinary miR concentrations increase with severity of kidney disease, with levels generally correlating with proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, different diseases do exhibit different patterns of miR expression. Data from studies in IgAN are at present inconsistent with urinary miR composition varying between studies depending on the whether the miRs were measured in urinary sediment or exosomes, using microar-rays, chips or high throughput RNA sequencing and importantly on the stage of disease being investigated. Furthermore, most of the studies of urine miR excretion have been undertaken in Chinese cohorts, and currently there are still very few studies reporting miR expression profiles in Caucasians.\n\nWith the advent of genome-wide association (GWA) studies numerous IgAN disease associated risk loci have been identified, and these have shed light on potential genes, mechanisms and signalling pathways associated with the susceptibility for development of IgAN. Some of these have also been shown to associate with potential miR target sites. For example, a target site for miR-148b has been detected in SNP rs1047763 within the gene C1GalT1 which encodes for a key enzyme responsible for O-galactosylation of IgA1. In addition, a functional SNP, rs2910164, within the miR-146a precursor, which is known to affect the expression of mature miR-146a, is associated with the susceptibility to, and severity of, childhood IgAN. Interestingly, echoing the prevalence of IgAN, the frequency of this SNP differs between subjects of East Asian origin and Europeans.\n\nAs might be imagined, with the growing number of studies reporting miR dysregulation in IgAN a number of investigators have evaluated these changes as possible biomarkers in IgAN. However, to date no single/panel of miR biomarkers has demonstrated generalisability across populations, or within a population across different sites. Most critically, none have been independently validated and systematically shown to add value above and beyond biomarkers currently routinely used in IgAN.\n\nCurrent treatment of IgAN is limited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that drive disease initiation and progression. Therapeutic options are focused on goal-directed supportive care which includes BP control, renin-angiotensin-system inhibition, lifestyle modification and cardiovascular risk management. It is hoped that a more complete understanding of the regulation of gene transcription and post transcriptional processes by miRs may offer novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, by virtue of their structure ncRNAs are excellent candidates as drugs themselves, capable of delivering a highly targeted approach to therapy. They can be synthesised with relative ease and designed to silence selected transcripts critical to specific disease-causing biological pathways. RNAi therapeutics offer the ability not only to release transcripts from endogenous suppression, thereby promoting protein synthesis, but also directly disrupt translation of transcripts, thereby causing protein synthesis suppression. RNAi therapeutics, including cemdisiran, a short olignonucleotide with a sequence complementary to the transcript of complement component C5, and Ionis-Fb-Lrx, a short length antisense olignonucleotide with a sequence complementary to the transcript of complement factor B (CfB), are already being evaluated in IgAN.\n\nIt is clear that there is an increasing appreciation of the potential role that miRs and other ncRNAs play in modulating IgAN pathogenesis and that miRs have great potential to deliver both transformative biomarkers to help guide the management of patients with IgAN and offer a new approach to delivery of targeted therapy. However, despite the many publications to date describing miR dysregulation in IgAN the existing data must at present be considered hypothesis generating. Going forward there needs to be a concerted effort to consolidate our understanding with well designed, cross-population validation studies to rigorously evaluate the role of miRs in IgAN pathogenesis and as future clinically meaningful biomarkers.\n\n7(Suppl 1): 11–12.\n\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence in kidney biopsy evaluation\n\nInstitute of Pathology, Department of Nephrology and Immunology & Electron Microscopy Facility, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany\n\nThe implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly deep learning (DL) is expected to transform medical practice. Recent technical improvements in storage, computational power (particularly the graphics processing units - GPUs), and slide scanners (allowing efficient high-throughput digitalization of histological slides) enable digitalization of pathology and application of computation approaches, termed digital pathology. This in turn enables the implementation of AI, and particularly DL, holding an immense potential to improve, advance, and transform diagnostic pathology. AI is readily and broadly implemented in various aspects of our everyday life. In medicine, including pathology, both development and translation are only starting to emerge [1, 2].\n\nAI research can be described as automatization of tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans or augmenting humans performing such tasks (the so-called augmented intelligence). Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI where Data and conclusions/answers are given to a computer that finds statistical structure within the data to generate the respective conclusion/answer. DL is a type of ML, in which rules are derived from the data by deriving meaningful representations within multiple successive processing layers (so-called neural networks). The depth of a DL model is given by its number of layers. DL, particularly the convolutional neural networks (CNN), are particularly efficient in visual tasks and were shown their medical applicability in several specialties, including ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology (mostly in the cancer field of onco-pathology) [1, 2]. Modern hospitals using digital records produce enormous amounts of data every day, making the integration of AI into regular practice not only possible but inevitable. As the technology is changing, the role of physicians and physician-scientists needs to be modulated to acquire the expertise to ensure clinical relevance, applicability, as well as the ethical use of AI in the future.\n\nIn digital pathology, AI can support in various ways. It allows for reproducible quantitative analysis of features that pathologists a) can visualize and count (support system), b) can visualize but cannot quantify (augmentation), or even c) currently cannot detect e.g. based on subvisual features (novel data mining).\n\nOne example of how DL can advance precision medicine was shown in the field of colorectal cancer. A CNN algorithm, just using a single H&E stained histology slide, was able to predict microsatellite instability, a therapeutically relevant molecular alteration in colorectal cancer [3]. This has potentially important clinical implications since microsatellite instability analyses require molecular pathology methods which are much more costly and time-consuming compared to such a digital DL algorithm. The performance of DL strongly depends on the amount of data. This was nicely documented in a follow-up study on microsatellite instability detection in colorectal cancer, in which a larger training dataset resulted in further improvement of diagnostic accuracy of the CNN algorithm [4]. Compared to cancer, there are several important challenges in renal pathology: it is morphologically more demanding than the majority of cancers with at the same time virtually no (or rather small) available histology repositories and registries. Another study showed, that the approach of deriving therapeutically relevant molecular alterations from cancer histology is potentially possible in the majority of main cancer types and most druggable genetic alterations [5].\n\nExamples of how DL can augment histopathology diagnostic in kidney biopsies were recently shown for quantification of kidney fibrosis. A CNN was able to mimic and reproduce quantitative assessment of kidney fibrosis on whole slide images of renal biopsies [6]. In another example, a DL pipeline was shown to automatically, precisely, and in high-throughput segment main renal histological compartments in kidney tissues from various species. This included glomeruli (tuft and capsule separately), arteries (lumen and media separately), veins, tubules, and interstitium. This approach not only strongly facilitates compartment-specific analyses but also allows a previously unprecedented quantitative approach, e.g. analyzing (hundreds of) thousands of kidney structures like tubules or glomeruli [7].\n\nTo understand the potential of AI in histopathological analyses of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), we propose a joined approach and project, the „AI.IgAN“. The AI.IgAN will apply our established pipeline and experience in DL in renal biopsies to develop, test, and validate DL models for the prediction of relevant clinical outcome parameters from kidney biopsy histology in IgA Nephropathy. We hypothesize that DL models of IgAN biopsies might be helpful to further improve precision medicine and nephropathology diagnostics. This project not only aims to understand the potentials but also pitfalls of implementation of DL in biopsy diagnostic and to analyze the potential of DL in deriving novel, reproducible and improved-personalized patient care in IgAN. Several centers are already involved and the participation is opened for all interested centers.\n\nIn conclusion, AI-augmented digital (nephro)pathology will expectedly transform this diagnostic field enabling more reproducible, quantitative, computational, and thereby “precision” histology analyses and data mining.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The diagnosis is based on kidney biopsy with IgA deposits with a wide spectrum of glomerular inflammation from mesangial proliferation to crescents. Also, diverse findings have been reported on light and electron microscopy.1\n\nAlthough familial related cases have been described and predisposing genetic factors have been suggested,2 IgAN usually develops in a sporadic form. Three loci could have genetic susceptibility for familial IgAN with IgAN 1 locus on chromosome 6q22-23, IgAN 2 locus on chromosome 4q26-31 and IgAN 3 locus on chromosome 17q12-22. 3, 4 Curiously, another locus has been observed in a Canadian cohort 2q36 5 coding for COLA4 and COL4A3 described in thin membrane or Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a hereditary genetic disorder nephritis due to mutations in the genes encoding alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 of type 4 collagen (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5).\n\nSince IgAN and Alport syndrome could have the same clinical presentation (hematuria, proteinuria, end stage renal disease), an association has been suggested between these diseases.6 In IgAN, thin basement membrane 7 8 and glomerular basement membrane injuries have been observed (double contours, gaps, thinning with a lamellar and reticular structure, rupture). 9\n\nTwenty six years ago, Bertoux at al reported 23 IgAN patients with thin glomerular membrane in a cohort of 58 IgAN patients indicating either a specific subgroup (with an unfavorable prognosis) or an association with thin membrane nephropathy.10 Recently, in familial IgAN, type 4 collagen mutation has been reported underlying the possibility of Alport family disease with IgA deposits.11 Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic variants COL4A3-5 segregating in 9 families were identified in 46 familial IgAN. COL4A3-5 variants autosomal dominant inheritance have been found in 6 (67%) out of 9 families, with 2 harboring heterozygous variants in COL4A3 and 4 in COL4A4. X-linked inheritance have been observed in the remaining 3, with variants in COL4A5. Substitution or missense mutations in highly conserved glycine residues in the triple helical collagenous domain were noted in 7 of the 9 families (78%); the other 2 families (22%) had frameshift variants. Unfortunately, detailed histopathology was not available in these families. In pediatrics, only case reports described collagen variants in supposed IgAN family. Hemizygous mutation of COL4A5 has been described in 9 years-old Asiatic cIgAN and his parents too. 12 Also a single heterozygous mutation affecting a splice acceptor site in the COL4A3 gene has been described also in 9 years old Caucasian cIgAN. 13\n\nRecently, we have reported retrospectively collagen variant in 36 children IgAN, by sequencing COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5 coding regions. We identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic inherited COL4A3 variants in 4 patients (COL4-cIgAN) out of 36 (11.1%). Three patients presented heterozygous carrier of variants in COL4A3 gene and one patient had two variants in trans corresponding to heterozygous compound variants affecting COL4A3. Every COL4-cIgAN had missense variant affecting COL4A3 gene. COl4A3 protein was affected a on glycine residue (p.G1277S) located in the collagenous domain of a3 of collagen IV or located in the NC1 domain of a3 collagen (IV) (p.F1504L and p.L1474P). In this cohort, most cases presented an autosomal inheritance with heterozygous COL4A3 variants, as described in familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.14\n\nAt the onset of the disease, all patient presented macroscopic hematuria and 3 patients (75 %) presented nephrotic syndrome including 2 patients with a kidney renal failure. Nephrotic cIgAN presented the full spectrum of proliferative lesions according Oxford classification (Ml, E1 and C1 lesion). Moreover, these 3 patients presented also high levels of Gd-IgA1 level, and plasma immune complexes. These immune complexes are specific to IgAN 15-17 These 3 patients got an intense immunosuppressive treatment with an improvement of histological lesions during the follow up.\n\nOne patient with p.G1277S potentially had a presentation compatible with Alport syndrome with macroscopic hematuria and small proteinuria. Absence of immune complexes with a low Gd-IgA1 associated with a low grade of proliferation were observed for this patient. At the last follow-up, this, patient had only microscopic hematuria, with a normal eGFR.\n\nFor the 3 other patients, the clinical and histological evolution together with the immunosuppression response and detection of a high level of specific immune complexes (Gd-IgA1, IgG-IgA, sCD89-IgA, and free sCD89) may support a superimposed Alport syndrome in patients with IgAN. One patient got a kidney transplantation with an IgAN recurrence. The detection of COL4A3 variants usually correlated with Alport syndrome in adults should not be a reason for avoiding an immunosuppressive regimen in cIgAN.\n\nThe observation of COL4A3 heterozygous variants seem to become predisposed to serious IgAN presentation. The clinical presentation of COL4A3-cIgAN patients was more severe at onset compared with the non-COL4A3-cIgAN patients, with a more profound nephrotic syndrome. COL4A3-cIgAN patients performed repeat kidney biopsies with many relapses, with the development of a high proportion of glomerulosclerosis at the last follow-up associated with a lower eGFR compared with non-COL4A3- cIgAN patients. It would be of interest to screen patients diagnosed with severe IgAN at the onset for collagenous variants and risk stratification could be based on the presence of a rare genetic variant of the COL4A3 gene.\n\nHistopathologic features provide important and reliable information for IgAN diagnosis, staging, and prognosis used extensively by clinicians in clinical practice. Nevertheless, the integration of collagenous features could lead to more accurate prediction of patient outcome. Despite being classified as potentially pathogenic, the role of these collagenous variants affecting COL4A3 is still unknown but confirms the heterogeneous nature of IgAN. Sequencing the COL4A3 variant at the cIgAN onset could stratify the risk for severe flare-up, especially with nephrotic syndrome presentation. It could help us to better understand the wide spectrum of IgAN presentation and prognosis. Similarly to newly discovered immune biomarkers based on IgA complexes, such as sCD89-IgA, free sCD89, Gd-IgA1, and IgG-IgA, and based on our findings and to be confirmed in a larger study, predictive and diagnostic factors could be uncovered using DNA sequencing during initial management of IgAN as an indicative prognostic biomarker of IgAN suitable for risk stratification.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In trials in patients with IgA nephropathy, surrogate outcomes are overwhelmingly reported and patient-reported outcomes have not been prioritized for inclusion. Treatment-related adverse events have not fared much better, though with recent exceptions.(1-4) Yet it is often those patient-reported aspects and treatment harms that are more relevant for patients and care partners when it comes to shared treatment decision-making for patients with IgA nephropathy.\n\nIgA nephropathy and its treatment(s) have outcomes whose impacts are best assessed by direct patient report and several of these are critically important to treatment decisions. Patients may experience swelling, fatigue and symptoms from chronic kidney disease but also distressing impacts of immuosuppressive therapies (e.g. corticosteroids).(5) In the short term, treatment harms can have greater impact on the patient than their glomerular disease, and these may include nausea, mood changes, altered physical appearance, and reduced mobility, strength or self-esteem.(6) Other more distal impacts of IgAN and its treatment include anxiety, depression and impaired quality of life.(7) When weighing treatment decisions, the net benefit and harm for each therapy must be compared as both disease and treatment may change symptom burden, day-to-day functioning and quality of life.\n\nPatients with glomerular disease and their care partners have identified patient-reported outcomes as critically important in treatment decisions.(8) Using focus groups with nominal group technique, 134 patients and care partners from Australia, United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong identified and ranked candidate trial outcomes.(8) Overall, kidney function, need for dialysis or transplant and mortality were highly prioritized. Life participation, defined as being able to participate in meaningful life activities, was the most important patient-reported outcome. Patients and care partners also highly prioritized mobility, cognition, fatigue, physical functioning/strength and depression as trial outcomes.(8, 9) However life participation was prioritized above these other patient-reported outcomes because it was the underlying major impact and the most important one for decision-making. Notably, these outcomes were more important to patients than other commonly measured outcomes including blood pressure, proteinuria and hospitalization.\n\nHealth professionals recognize the necessity of capturing patient reported outcomes, though there are some differences in their priorities for outcomes when compared to patients (e.g. death, hospitalization). An international, two-round Delphi survey that included 412 patients with glomerular disease (253 with IgA nephropathy) and 288 health professionals showed kidney function (including need for dialysis or transplant), cardiovascular disease, relapse/remission, death and life participation were shared top priorities as trial outcomes.(9) Therefore, life participation appears to be a fundamentally important construct for patients with glomerular disease including IgAN, which comprises those negative impacts from disease and treatment(s) but also protective or positive aspects. It is frequently and significantly impaired, but can give patients' purpose and self-worth, preserve a sense of self and strengthen mental health.(8, 9) The impacts on this domain are also under-appreciated by health professionals and difficult to address, which increases the importance of knowing how it might change post treatment.\n\nImplementing routine reporting of patient-reported outcomes such as life participation in IgA trials is one of the aims of the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology - Glomerular Disease (SONG-GD) initiative.(10) SONG-GD is establishing a core outcome set for trials in glomerular disease, which is a standardized set of outcomes to be routinely reported in all trials in this field.(11) They can help ensure that critically important outcomes common to all stakeholders are consistently reported using the same measures. Challenges to the implementation of core outcomes include their feasibility and usability, and this may entail the development or validation of a new measure - as would be the case for life participation. Strategies to achieve their uptake include partnering with key stakeholders such as funders, regulators and engaging all end users of the data in order to increase their willingness to be included in trials.(12) Once implemented, a core outcome set for glomerular disease would ensure the evidence base for treatment decisions is more relevant and comparable across therapies for both patients and health professionals.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The organizers reported the advancement in defining pathogenesis - defective galactosylation of IgA molecules (Gd- IgA1) with production and renal deposition of circulating immune complexes (2) - and systematizing the approach to morphology of the disease with the Oxford Classification for IgAN (3). Ten years ago, little attention was paid to IgAN in children, since the general opinion was that Pediatricians mostly face a benign disease, with bouts of gross hematuria rapidly vanishing or persistent mild microscopic hematuria, which rarely progresses to chronic kidney failure. In a well-studied Swedish cohort of 72 children with IgAN followed for a median of 8 years, half of the children did not show any clinical signs of the disease, indicating low disease activity or, possibly, recovery (4). Some decline in GFR was detected in 3% only, persistent proteinuria in 35% and hypertension in 9%, favoring the impression of a rather benign disease. However, long-term follow-up studies had reported a Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival from ESKF at 20 years of 82% in children with IgAN in Japan and 70% in USA (5,6). Hence, there was the clear perception that further studies were needed to identify the subgroup of children at risk of late progression.\n\nThe most relevant advancement in understanding IgAN in children in the last decade is that the simple application of the general concepts of pathogenesis and risk factors detected in adults do not perfectly fit in children. Therapeutic approaches should be personalized to the pediatric risk.\n\nGenetic and pathogenetic factors\n\nA genetic signature is stronger than in adults is detected in children with IgAN. Gd-IgA1 levels were found highly inherited (7). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed a particularly strong association in children with IgAN with 14 of 15 risk alleles related to intestinal mucosal immunity (GALT) (8). Moreover, there are new data on association between IgAN and COL4A5 and COL4A3 variants (9,10), usually associated with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. About 40% families with thin membrane disease (TBMN) segregates with the COL4A3/COL4A4 locus and several studies reported an association between TBMD and IgAN particularly in children (11,12). These genes may favor early manifestation of hematuria in children with IgAN.\n\nMucosal immunity environmental challenges are common in children with tonsillitis and gastroenteritis. There is an age-related capacity of control of inflammation and tissue repair which is reduced in the transition from childhood to adult life. This event is regulated by the CD4+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). Treg cells are originated and orchestrated by complex mechanisms which have the first origin in the tymus, a lymphoid organ which undergoes involution during transition from childhood to adulthood (13). The thymus as well as tonsils and adenoids attain approximately 200% growth by late childhood and then involute (14). Peyer's patches, which are the GALT mayor site of IgA-producing cells, show similar age-related changes (15).\n\nClinical presentation and progression\n\nThe variability of progression of IgAN in children is mostly depending on the indications to perform diagnostic renal biopsy, after chance detection of microscopic hematuria or shortly after acute nephritic syndrome episodes or after a relentless slow increase in proteinuria. Asymptomatic IgAN, detected by school programs in Japan and Korea (13,14), do not simply represent an early phase of the disease, since it does not implicate a more rapid progression, and spontaneous remissions occur, though with mild relapses (15). In Europe as in many continents the diagnosis of IgAN in children follows the detection of persistent microscopic hematuria with proteinuria (16). An onset with acute nephritic syndrome is common, with inflammatory glomerular lesions and, over the short-term, possible improvement either spontaneous or favored by corticosteroid/immunosuppressive treatment. Remission is more common in children due to the age-related capacity of tissue repair and control of inflammation (17).\n\nClinical risk factors\n\nThe value of proteinuria, hypertension and reduced GFR at renal biopsy as prognostic markers of progression, assessed in adults more than 20 years ago were rarely confirmed in children (18). The European Validation Study of the Oxford classification (VALIGA) cohort enrolled 174 children and 973 adults with IgAN (19,20) with median proteinuria of 0.8 (0.3-2.2) g/1.73m2/day in children and 1.4 (0.7-2.6) g/day in adults. Over a similar follow up of a median of 4.6 years, the rate of eGFR loss was significantly faster in adults versus children, being −1.8 (−3.4+0.5) ml/min/1.73m2/year and 0 (−1.7+0.76) ml/min/1.73m2/year respectively). The combined end point of 50% decrease in eGFR or ESKD was reached in 16% adults and 6% children, and ESKD alone in 12% and 4.6% respectively. The median value of follow-up proteinuria in children was 0.56 (0.2 −1.0) g/day/1.73m2, representing a persistent risk of progression (19). Notably, eGFR and proteinuria at renal biopsy were not predictive of outcome in children while they were significant predictors in adults. Multivariate models based on clinical data were significant in children only when including follow-up data.\n\nIn VALIGA patients the hazard of the combined end point increased with age at renal biopsy until a plateau, which was reached at 23 years (21). An improvement in eGFR mostly after corticosteroid-immunosuppressive treatment rendered not significant the prediction value of the clinical data at renal biopsy also in the French cohorts, 82 children with IgAN in whom biopsy was performed shortly after the acute clinical onset (22).\n\nPathology risk factors\n\nMore than 10 years ago Haas et al reported for the first time a comparison of histological features (I-V classes) and outcome in adults and children with IgAN (24). The 10-year survival to ESKD was significantly different (children 80%, adults 35%), however, at multivariate analysis only interstitial fibrosis was a significant independent predictor.\n\nThe Oxford Classification of IgAN (3) detected the prognostic value of mesangial (M) or endocapillary (E) hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis (S) and tubular atrophy-interstitial fibrosis (T) score that was similar in children and in adults (25). National or single center studies in pediatric cohorts from Sweden (26), Japan (27), China (28), and Brazil (29) confirmed the value of some MEST score by univariate analysis. However, in multivariate models no individual feature maintained an independent value, apart from T lesions in Chinese children (28). In the European Validation study the prognostic predictive value of MST lesions was confirmed only in 261 young subjects <23 years of age, not in the cohort aged less than 18 years (22).\n\nPrediction tool in children using clinical and pathology data\n\nThe above observation clearly indicated the need of risk prediction assessed on the combination of clinical and pathology features. To this aim, the International IgAN Network updated the model set in adults (29,30). The analytic cohort included 1,060 children with IgAN. The median eGFR at biopsy was 98 ml/min/1.73m2 (79-118) with proteinuria 1.2g/day/1.73m2 (0.5-3.0). The median follow-up was 3.9 years, and 48% were followed into adulthood. The primary outcome (50% decline in eGFR or ESKD) occurred in 52 children whereas the secondary outcome (30% decline in eGFR or ESKD) occurred in 117 children. Un updated model using the secondary outcome the predictors selected were the M and S scores, MAP for the model without race/ethnicity and eGFR. For the model with race/ethnicity, the same predictors were selected in addition to the T-score and Japanese race/ethnicity. Crescents were not associated with 30% reduction in eGFR or ESRF even after adjusting for CS/IS use.\n\nCalibration showed good agreement between predicted and observed risk, with satisfying improved ability to differentiate various risk groups.\n\nDisease trajectory over time\n\nThe eGFR trajectories in children were non-linear with an initial increase in eGFR followed by a subsequent decline. A higher predicted risk of the 30% decline in eGFR or ESRF was associated with a smaller initial increase in eGFR followed by a more rapid decline. Children with IgAN tend to have an initial increase in eGFR up to 15-18 years of age and then start a linear decline like that seen in adults. The eGFR trajectory in children may relate to more active lesions and great capacity for repair and control inflammation (19).\n\nAmong the progresses made in understanding IgAN in children, the detection of specific age-related risk factors for progression represents a major step to allow the identification of different risk levels and select cases with similar risk factors to receive treatment or placebo.\n\nConclusion\n\nNew advancements in IgAN in children have provided insight into the value of approach the disease individualizing each case on the basis of onset as history of onset, reason for performing renal biopsy, family history, time elapsed before performing renal biopsy and MEST-C score. When available, genetic data would be useful. All these data are helpful in classify children with different progression risk, mostly based on the Pediatric predictor tool. Modifications in proteinuria and eGFR over a short time (6 months -one years, times which are usually considered sufficient to establish a potential benefit of a treatment) may we incorrect in some cases, that will display stable clinical features only 2-5-years later. The best prognosis is for those with initial greater increase in eGFR, but the interest is focused on long-term prognosis, when the trajectory decreases like in adults. If we wish to compare the effect of treatments in children, we have to consider to plan the evaluation on eGFR decline after some years, when the potential of fully respond to therapy of recovery - largely dependent on the age of the children affected by IgAN - will go to physyiological exhaustion.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The link between IgAN and mucous membranes is also supported by associations with celiac disease and herpetiform dermatitis, possibly due to increased intestinal permeability and high levels of IgA against gliadin [1].\n\nThe gut microbiota influences both locally and systemically the recruitment, development, and activity of innate and adaptive immune cells in mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) [2]. The gut immune system is unique and defends against infections by producing IgA, likely contributing to dietary protein and commensal microbiota tolerance [1]. In the gastrointestinal system, IgA is the most common antibody isotype. The isotype switch to IgA, occurring in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) and mesenteric lymphnodes, contributes to the prevalence of IgA production by intestinal plasma cells [1,3].\n\nT-cell-dependent (TD) or -independent (TI) mechanisms can both stimulate IgA synthesis in MALT [4]. TI-IgA class switching of B cells can occur in the lamina propria and is induced by many cytokines, but mostly by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily member 13 (APRIL) and by the proliferation-inducing ligand and B-cell activating factor (also known as BAFF).\n\nBecause secretory IgA activity occurs in the intestinal mucosa, the function of microbiota and intestinal immunity in IgAN is particularly intriguing. Increased blood levels of galactose-deficient IgA (Gd-IgA) and mesangial deposits of IgA were detected in a transgenic mouse model overexpressing BAFF, but the presence of intestinal microbiota was required for the development of this phenotype [5]. Moreover, between patients with IgAN (progressor versus non-progressor) and healthy subjects (HSs), a distinct profile was detected in both the make-up of the faecal microbiota and the metabolomic profile [6]. Furthermore, to demonstrate the role of microbiota in disease progression, we were recently able to show that fecal microbiota transplantation may modulate renal phenotype in the humanized mouse model of IgAN (Lauriero G. et al., data under review).\n\nAs well as, recently, the α1KICD9Tg mice were also challenged by rifaximin (NORMIX®) treatment, a non-absorbable oral antibiotic, that induces positive modulation of the gut microbiota, favoring the growth of bacteria beneficial to the host. Rifaximin treatment decreased the hIgA1 mesangial deposition, CD11b+ cell infiltration and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, serum levels of hIgA1-sCD89 and mIgG-hIgA1 complexes. Moreover, under gene expression profiling, our findings support reduced gut inflammation following rifaximin treatment, showed by a downregulation of TNF-α and BAFF gene transcription [7].\n\nBased on these studies, it can be hypothesized a possible link between commensal bacteria, higher BAFF levels, disrupted ho-moeostasis of intestinal-activated B cells and intestinal IgA class switch in IgAN patients [8,9]. The role of the complex intestinal immune network and intestinal mucosal hyper-responsiveness in the pathogenesis of IgAN has been recently supported, for the first time, by our findings showing a significant difference in the number of intestinally activated B lymphocytes in IgAN patients compared to HCs [8]. The intestinal-renal axis is important in Berger's glomerulonephritis, where several factors (e.g. genetics [10,11], infections [12], and food antigens [13,14]) may play a role in the disease complex pathogenesis and provide novel therapeutic targets to slow down disease progression.\n\nInterestingly, IL-6 pathway seems to be involved in this complex intestinal immune network particularly in mediating the production of aberrantly glycosylated IgA (15, 16). Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of the CD37 protein on the B cells of IgAN patients is reduced compared to healthy donors. In CD37 knock out mice, IL6 levels were elevated along with increased deposited complexes and low kidney function. In contrast, mice with double knock out for IL6 and CD37 showed no glomerular IgA deposits and were protected from exacerbated renal failure after treatment with lipopolysaccharides [15]. These data suggest that IL-6 mediates renal pathology in CD37 knockout mice, and that CD37 may protect against IgA nephropathy by inhibiting the IL-6 pathway itself. However, the reason and mechanism why elevated levels of IL-6 are present in IgAN patients are still unknown.\n\nOne possible explanation comes out from our whole genome screening for DNA methylation in IgAN patients, that identified, among others, three regions with altered DNA methylation capable of influencing the expression of genes involved in the response and proliferation of T and B cells. In particular, a hypermethylated region was identified comprising Vault RNA 2-1 (VTRNA2-1), a non-coding RNA also known as precursor of miR-886 (Pre-mi-RNA). Consistently, the VTRNA2-1 expression was found down-regulated in IgAN patients [17].\n\nWe are currently investigating whether and how, in IgAN patients, the down-regulation of VTRNA2-1 induces the PKR / CREB pathway that stimulates the secretion of IL-6, the cytokine with a key role in mediating the production of deglycosylated IgA. VTRNA2-1 is known as a specific inhibitor of PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-enabled), an interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase. Consequently, it can inhibit also the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). Suppression of VTRNA2-1 activates PKR/CREB pathways, such as eIF2a phosphorylation and the NF-kB pathway, leading to impaired cell proliferation and IL-6 production[18].\n\nNormally, in healthy subjects (HS), the VTRNA2-1, by inhibiting the PKR/CREB pathway, also inhibits the expression and production of IL-6. Therefore, in IgAN patients, the reduced expression of VTRNA2-1 explains the regulatory mechanism that induces high levels of IL-6 and mediates the aberrant production of degalactosylated IgA. This mechanism is based on the epige-netic down-regulation of VTRNA-2-1 RNA and on the activation of the PKR / CREB pathway that in IgAN may be induced by bacterial or viral RNA deriving from commensal bacteria or viral infections.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Cohorting dialysis shifts and re-visiting old treatments such as initiating acute peritoneal dialysis became essential tools. The conduct of clinical trials needed to pause for the most part to focus on clinical care. But this medical and public health crisis sparked an urgency recognizing that clinical trials were the path towards treatment and vaccines to lift us out of the pandemic.\n\nOne particular recent innovation is the master protocol (MP) which had previously been used mostly in oncology. However, quickly implementing one type of MP, the platform design, for COVID-19 treatments truly maximized the speed and efficiency towards understanding which current therapies could be used safely and effectively. The RECOVERY Trial (Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) enrolled its first patient in March 2020, and by June had randomized over 11,800 patients. Within 3 months of that first enrolled patient, data had quickly accrued to demonstrate the effects of hydroxychloroquine, dexame-thasone and lopinavir-ritonavir. Trial implementation generated fast results that shifted clinical care, underscoring 2 important principles: trial participation can be an option for care, and innovative trial design was essential in obtaining data at an unprecedented yet critical speed during this unsettling pandemic. COVID-19 trials, including those investigating novel vaccines, required many in the medical community to embrace a research ready culture. Medical staff at one particular center had morning huddles, evaluating which, not if, COVID-19 trials a newly admitted patient would enter. Hopefully such concepts (master protocols and an on-study culture) will be picked up with enthusiasm in nephrology.\n\nAs the COVID-19 investigations continued, most nephrology trials had to pause trial activity to focus on keeping patients safe and so that staff could be allocated to more pressing needs related to the pandemic. As principal investigators (PI) started to slowly resume nephrology clinical trials, another innovation was embraced: applying telehealth to both clinical care and trial conduct. Telehealth (also known as telemedicine) has been used in clinical medicine for several years in areas such as burn units, stroke/TIA and mental health management. But as patients were quarantined at home, nephrology clinical care pivoted to telehealth, and the concept of bringing care directly to the patient at home inspired creative solutions for also bringing more trial activity closer to home for patients.\n\nDecentralized trials intend to accomplish what is sounds like … the investigator site no longer is the central hub for trial procedures, which get shifter closer to the patient, whether that is at Patient Service Centers in retail pharmacies or services right at the patient's home (e.g. home health nurses and phlebotomists, home delivery of study drug and trial tools such as blood pressure cuffs or scales, or courier pick up of lab samples). Schedule of assessments were re-tooled so that not every procedure had to be performed at the PI site, and remote and video technology also enabled this shift. Although many stakeholders had been preaching for more patient-centric protocols for years, the pandemic fortunately left no choice but to inspire procedures that would be less burdensome to patients, such as video training/observation of SC injections instead of wasting time and money traveling to the site. This necessary evolution towards trials with more built-in virtual and hybrid elements also opened the door to increased patient choice; with more options patients are now empowered to select how they prefer to engage in trial activities.\n\nThe crisis of this pandemic also shined an unfortunate but real spotlight on health care disparities, which must inspire our trial community to also examine how to engage and enroll more diverse communities of color. The FDA endorses this call to action in their related FDA guidance document finalized in Nov. 2020. Many of the elements of virtual trials may also support how we better reach communities of color with challenges to access of care. We must promote the goal of studying more diverse populations so that we generate direct data (rather than extrapolate) on the very people we need to treat with novel therapies.\n\nThis session will delve into the above topics, and also provide feedback from patients, PIs and industry who were informally surveyed for their related perspectives. We must leverage the valuable insight gained from a difficult and disruptive year as we press forward in improving the design and conduct of future clinical trials. The unmasking of disparities in both clinical care and trials, together with the aforementioned innovations in trial design and conduct, proves that this crisis has certainly not been a waste.\n\n7(Suppl 1): 24–25.\n\nNew insights into mucosal IgA-producing plasma cells - Implications for IgA nephropathy\n\nDepartment of Immunology, University of Toronto; 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 1A8, Canada\n\nIgA antibodies are produced at mucosal surfaces, notably the gut and the respiratory tract, by plasma cells. Plasma cells are derived from B cells that are activated in the germinal center or in extrafollicular reactions. After this activation step, some B cells can differentiate into short lived plasmablasts and long-lived plasma cells. In humans, IgA plasma cells can live for decades in the gut lamina propria1 where their specificity and number are dictated by the commensal microbiota that reside in the adjacent lumen.\n\nContinual transport of IgA occurs across the single epithelial layer that separates the host from the outside world. Specifically, IgA dimers bind to the polymeric IgA receptor expressed on the epithelium, followed by trans-epithelial transport and release of the dimerized IgA in association with the secretory component. This secretory component associated IgA is critical for shielding the host from potentially invasive microbes2.\n\nOur classical understanding of IgA-producing plasma cells is that they remain in their mucosal tissues where they produce their antibodies in order to maintain homeostasis between the host and its microbiota. The microbiota at these sites is also very important for dictating the numbers and specificity of IgA-producing plasma cells3, 4. However, multiple studies have now shown that IgA-producing plasma cells can leave the gut and travel to other mucosal and non-mucosal tissues5-10. In addition, although the main role for IgA-producing plasma cells is to produce large amounts of IgA to shield the host against microbes, there is an increasing appreciation of plasma cells, including IgA-producing plasma cells, as producers of cytokines that can potentially regulate the immune response11, 12. For example, IgA-producing plasma cells can produce IL-10 that suppresses the anti-cancer T cell response in the liver and prostate13, 14, and inflammation in the brain5. These new insights on IgA-producing plasma cells have tremendous implications for a number of disease states, including IgA nephropathy.\n\nIn my presentation, I will provide some insights into how IgA producing cells are generated in the gut using rotavirus as a model of intestinal infection15. I will also provide an example of IgA-producing plasma cell migration from the gut to the inflamed brain, and provide present evidence they can produce IL10 at this location5. In addition, I will present new data showing evidence of a mucosal IgA response in the oral cavity of subjects immunized with mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 via the parenteral route16. Lastly, I will provide a perspective on how the evolutionary pressure to produce IgA by mucosal plasma cells17 may be a maladaptive feature in the context of IgA nephropathy.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The established mainstay of therapy for the management of patients with IgA nepropahty is inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron-system in patients with proteinuria > 1 g/dah. However, there has been little progress in the treatment strategies over the last two or three decades. Approximately 30% of patients with IgA nephropathy progress to kidney failure, and risk factors for deterioration of kidney function include decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), persistent proteinuria and hypertension.\n\nVarious new therapies are currently in development for the treatment of IgA nephropathy. Two drug classes, targeting nonimmune pathways may be of particular interest. These ar"
