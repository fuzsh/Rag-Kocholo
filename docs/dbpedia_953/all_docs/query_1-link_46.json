Men:\n\nMany of our alumni, and you may be\n\none of them, tried to get a boy into college this /all without success. The purpose of this article is to explain briefly\n\nsome of the trying problems and situations we faced during the past six months.\n\nOur normal enrollment, as fixed by the\n\nfaculty was approximately 800 men. During the last November to February semester\n\nwe had 419 students and during the February to Jun e semester we had 797 students.\n\nSince last fall we have been\n\nbesieged with applications from new students as well as from hundreds o/ our\n\nformer Nazry V-12 and non V-12 men who\n\nwanted to return to the campus this fall\n\nin order to resume their studies.\n\nTh e question of how much we could increase our total student body this fall was\n\ngiven careful and detailed study. After consultation involving trustees, faculty and staff\n\nthe decision was made to expand our enrollment to 1000 men. We also decided\n\nthat our own former students should be\n\nreadmitted be/ore we accepted any new\n\nstudents. As the result of two communications sent out during last winter and\n\nspring to all our former students we were\n\nmade to realize that we would hit the 1000\n\nmark WITHOUT admitting any NEW\n\nstudents.\n\nWe wanted, of course, to have a Freshman class this fall and so the maximum\n\nlevel was again changed. By March 20th\n\nwe had some 900 applications of new stndcnts in process and then realized that we\n\nwould be able to admit only about one\n\nout of three of these men. Since that date\n\nwe have sent out over three thousand\n\nvania Federation of Churches and\n\nJohn Charles Thomas, Metropolitan\n\nOpera star.\n\nmimeographed post cards in reply to inquiries announcing that no more applicants would be considered. Some of yuur\n\ncandidates might have been in this g roup\n\nand we regret that it was necessary to turn\n\ndown so many boys. Included in this group\n\nwere valedictorians, honor students, fullbacks, shortstops, wrestlers, 100 yd. dash\n\nmen, and musicians, but no pre-ministerial\n\nstudents. Exceptions were made in such\n\ncases.\n\nYou may know that all the colleges of\n\nthe State, under the leadership of President Distler who is president of the Pennsylvania College Presidents Association,\n\ntogether with the State Department of\n\nPublic Instruction, have set up Emergency\n\nColleges in many communities throughout\n\nthe state to care for some 24,000 boys and\n\ngirls who could not gain admittance to a\n\ncollege campus. The work in these Emergency Centers covers only the freshman\n\nyear and accredited courses, satisfactorily\n\ncompleted, may be used /or advanced\n\nstanding in transferring to a collP.ge\n\ncampus in September 1947. Our admissions office turned over the names of almost two hundred boys from Lancaster\n\ncity and county to the local Emergency\n\nCollege as candidates for admission. These\n\nboys wanted to enter Franklin and Marshall but could not be admitted because of\n\nlack of classroom and laboratory space nnd\n\nsu/Jicient faculty.\n\nThe student body now numbers 1264 including 301 Freshmen which is the smallest\n\nof the four classes.\n\nWe need and hope for the continued\n\ninterest and loyalty of all our alumni in\n\nthe years to come and felt that you should\n\nknow som ething of our trials and tribulations during a period of the greatest educational upsurge in American history.\n\nJ.
