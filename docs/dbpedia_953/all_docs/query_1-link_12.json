        "text": "The truth about DEI committees‚Ä¶. DEI committees have the potential to be a force for good but when they get it wrong, they can end up isolating the very employees they're trying to support. A common misconception is that being from an underrepresented background automatically makes you a good candidate for the DEI committee. I can relate because I was clueless about DEI but was asked to spearhead it in companies I joined. Like me, most people have no intention of joining, they often say yes out of fear or feeling like they‚Äôre letting people down if they don‚Äôt. But you join and wholeheartedly go into it believing you can make a difference. But then your ideas get shut down because DEI discussions happen in a DEI silo. Even worse, you‚Äôre now branded by colleagues or the boss as too ‚Äòwoke‚Äô. Suddenly, you feel isolated when the whole point is to make you (and people like you) feel more included. So, if you feel your DEI committee is too woke. Please remember they probably joined the company just wanting to do their job in Sales, Operations or Tech and go home. They probably had no intention of being the spokesperson of DEI. They are just trying to help.\n\nGovernments often recognize outstanding individuals in various fields by awarding them medals as a token of appreciation for their remarkable contributions. These individuals, whether from industries or society, are acknowledged for their relentless dedication and efforts that have significantly advanced innovation and societal growth. However, while medals serve as prestigious honors, there's often a gap when it comes to providing substantial support to these high achievers to further their meaningful impact. It raises the question: is conferring a medal the extent of our recognition for top performers? Shouldn't there be more tangible efforts to facilitate their endeavors towards societal betterment? Despite their invaluable contributions, many of these individuals face hurdles in obtaining necessary resources and support to amplify their initiatives. Sponsoring their offices and expenses on state causes could not only empower them to continue their impactful work but also foster a culture of sustained innovation and progress. Ultimately, while medals symbolize appreciation, true support lies in actively backing the endeavors of these exceptional individuals. By investing in their projects and providing avenues for collaboration, governments can harness their potential for driving positive change and fostering sustainable growth in society.\n\nüåü Reflecting on a transformative weekend at the MPI Tennessee Chapter Mid-Year Board Retreat Placemakr üåü Stepping into each board meeting or retreat always brings a mix of excitement and nerves. As someone deeply passionate about MPI, I thrive in these spaces as an idea person. Yet, the shadow of past insecurities sometimes looms large, whispering doubts about my adequacy in fulfilling my role. But amidst the anxiety, I remind myself: I am a volunteer, giving my best. This time was different. As VP of Finance in a pivotal transition year for MPI, including a fiscal year extension and a new prospectus, I found myself at the center stage. I poured my heart into crafting a revamped prospectus, tirelessly seeking ways to better serve our sponsors. Presenting it was nerve-wracking; every question felt like a challenge to defend my hard work. However, amidst the scrutiny, a beautiful realization dawned upon me. Each question, each input, was a testament to the community's care and commitment. We weren't just making decisions; we were engaging in a collective effort to elevate MPI. The aftermath of the presentation held the most precious moment. A call from someone I've clashed with, expressing genuine appreciation for my work, reminded me of the power of connection and understanding. Leadership isn't just about delivering flawless presentations; it's about fostering a community where everyone feels seen and valued. This weekend reaffirmed the essence of MPI: leadership, community, inspiration, networking, and above all, lifting each other up. Here's to many more transformative moments ahead! #MPI #Leadership #Community #Transformation Michael Farrell Cayce Brasel Turbeville Melanie Blanche, CMP Roger Hampton Beth McDaniels, CMP Carolyn Johnson T.

A few months ago, I had the joy and privilege of co-hosting a gathering for Denver nonprofit leaders with Mackenzie Langley, founder of Lighthouse, and Emma Nicotra, a high school senior who I met through a Colorado Young Leaders volunteer event. Participants shared and received thought partnership on one of their biggest 2024 challenges and then created an action plan to tackle their challenges head-on. üîç Lesson learned: Small, intentional gathering decisions can have a big impact. üí° An example for inspo: Emma's brilliant \"four corners\" icebreaker grouped attendees by role, tenure, and org size. These groupings led to energizing, relevant conversations that attendees didn't want to end. üöÄ YOUR TURN: For your next gathering, I invite you to consider ONE place where you might incorporate an extra dose of intentionality, perhaps who you connect with whom over the course of the gathering. üëá Share your plan in the comments! üåü Want to level up your gathering game with monthly inspo delivered straight to your inbox? Subscribe now (link in comments).\n\nCelebrating the challenge. You feel like you‚Äôre flying high, nothing can stop you, the universe is consistently demonstrating how much it has your back. The little things don‚Äôt touch you, you breathe through the meltdowns, maybe get a little tetchy but quickly bring it back on track with perspective and connection. Until there‚Äôs ü§Æ You get the dreaded call when you‚Äôre finally in the home stretch on the post-school, nursery run! You pull up when you realise what‚Äôs going on, ready to grab your cape and the tiddler to rescue the sickly one‚Ä¶ and you find a moment of space. Deciding the sickly one is in safe hands and an extra 15 minutes isn‚Äôt going to end the world, you get back in gear and carry on with drop off before you collect. (Obviously calling school in the meanwhile to update them so they don‚Äôt call a grandparent and expose your shameful decision ü§≠ü§£ serious, not serious in equal measure!) First you connect and let the sickly one know you‚Äôve got them, then you allow yourself some space to acknowledge the impact and lack of control in this matter and then regroup, sort out tomorrow and turn your attention to the best way forward. And the gratitude that clients cancelled sessions today and meant there was no ‚Äòimpending doom‚Äô scenario. Reset and return to knowing that it will all work out. üíñ And there‚Äôs always a bright side - now there are only 2 pick-ups left today, rather than 3 ü§£ üòâ ü§™ Go easy on yourself today, whatever is coming your way (just hoping it‚Äôs not projectile vomit‚Ä¶ üò¨)"
