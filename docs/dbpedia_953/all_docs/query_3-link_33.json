        "text": "DALLAS (CBSNewsTexas.com) -- The Dallas County Sheriff's Office has arrested a suspect in a hit-and-run crash that led to the death of a good Samaritan last weekend.\n\nDCSO says 25-year-old Juan Francisco Garcia turned himself in on Monday evening. They say he was driving a tow truck that hit a minivan just before 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 12. on I-30 in Dallas. Deputies say Garcia drove away from the scene.\n\nDonald Collins stopped to help the people in the van, but he was later hit and killed by an SUV. A mother and son in the van were severely injured, but deputies credit Collins with saving their lives.\n\nGarcia faces two charges stemming from the initial crash. He turned himself in on the same day Collins was laid to rest."
