Following assignments on board the Mississippi, Toucey,Blakeley, and Patoka, he studied communications at the Naval Postgraduate School. From 1935 to 1938 he served as radio officer on the staffs of Destroyer Squadrons Six and 14. After a staff assignment at the Naval Academy, he reported as flag lieutenant to Admiral Thomas Hart, Commander in Chief Asiatic Fleet, and was in that job when World War II broke out. He moved to Corregidor and then escaped to the Dutch East Indies as senior man on board the schooner Lanikai, sailing by night and hiding by day. From 1943 to 1945 he took part in the planning and execution of every major amphibious operation in the Southwest Pacific Area while serving on the staff of Rear Admiral Daniel Barbey, Commander Seventh Amphibious Force. After duty in OpNav and BuPers, he commanded attack cargo ship Marquette, served on the CinCPacFlt staff, and then in the office of the Comptroller of the Navy, William Franke.

Along the way, he discusses flight training, aviation duty in light cruisers, patrol planes and service in aircraft carriers, including putting Yorktown into commission under Captain Jocko Clark. Admiral Anderson held a number of important planning jobs ashore, including the Bureau of Aeronautics, the AirPac staff under John Towers, and CominCh staff. He commanded the carriers Mindoro and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the early 1950s, he was on the Sixth Fleet staff, helped establish the NATO command in Europe, and was essentially chief of staff to Admiral Arthur Radford as Chairman of the JCS. As a flag officer, he was Commander Formosa Patrol Force before taking command of CarDiv Six.\n\nVolume II\n\nBased on eight interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from December 1980 through April 1981. The volume contains 353 pages of interview transcript plus an index and appendices. The transcript is copyright 1983 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the restrictions originally placed on the transcript by the interviewee have since been removed.\n\nThe concluding volume of this memoir deals with Admiral Anderson's command of the Sixth Fleet from 1959 to 1961, his stormy tenure as Chief of Naval Operations from 1961 to 1963, his tour as U.S. Ambassador to Portugal from 1963 to 1966, and his activities since retirement from government service. In describing his time as fleet commander, Admiral Anderson tells of the fleet's combat capabilities and role as a goodwill ambassador for the nation. When he became CNO during the administration of John Kennedy, he had good relations with Secretary of the Navy John Connally. Admiral Anderson is much less kind in discussing SecNav Fred Korth and SecDef Robert McNamara.

The transcript is copyright 1986 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nChief Badders, who enlisted during World War II, got a taste of battleship and aviation duty before being brought into diving and salvaging work in the mid-1920s. He describes the woeful status of the Navy's diving capabilities and was in on the ground floor of improvements that occurred during his career. Of particular interest is his account of the rescue attempts and salvaging of the sunken submarines S-51 (SS-162), S-4 (SS-108), and Squalus (SS-192). For his dangerous and aggressive rescue of 18 Squalus crew members, Badders was awarded the Medal of Honor in January 1940. A prevalent theme throughout his memoir is sports. Badders played on various professional and semipro baseball and football teams, and recalls his encounters with such greats as Satchel Paige, Lou Gehrig, and Ted Williams.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBak, Michael, Jr., WWII Quartermaster, USN\n\nBased on three interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell from March 1984 to June 1986.

The transcript is copyright 1988 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nMike Bak served as a quartermaster in the Fletcher-class destroyer Franks (DD-554) from 1943 to 1946. He is representative of an entire generation of enlisted men who grew up during the Depression and whose only active duty was during World War II and the immediate postwar period. He tells of his boyhood in New Jersey; navy training; and the various campaigns in which the Franksparticipated. His ship specialized in plane guard duty and rescued more than 20 downed aviators. Bak gives a real feel for the excitement and flavor of wartime destroyer duty. After his discharge from the Navy, Bak excelled as a salesman, being honored by Olivetti USA with the establishment of a permanent sales award in his name.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBaldwin, Hanson W. (Military Correspondent for the New York Times)\n\nVolume I\n\nBased on four interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from February 1975 through June 1975. The volume contains 434 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1976 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nThis is one of the few interviews of a civilian in the Naval Institute collection, but it is one of considerable value to historians because of Mr. Baldwin's long association with the service during his time as military correspondent and editor for The New York Times. Mr. Baldwin was graduated from the Naval Academy in 1924 and served on board battleships and a destroyer before resigning to go into newspaper work. He served in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and off Europe. Initially, he covered a variety of naval and maritime stories, including the Navy's annual fleet problems, and came into contact with a number of high-ranking officers. He noted the military buildup as World War II approached and the general unpreparedness of this nation to go to war. He rode the new battleship North Carolina on trials and covered Army maneuvers in 1941, then visited the Pacific and North Africa after the war started, writing both news accounts and interpretive pieces. He was off Normandy for D-Day in 1944.\n\nVolume II\n\nBased on four interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from July 1975 through December 1975. The volume contains 356 pages of interview transcript plus an index and appendices. The transcript is copyright 1976 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Baldwin covered the atom bomb tests and the bitter Navy-Air Force fight over unification of the services. During the 1950s, he covered the Korean War, the Formosa dispute, new weapon systems, and various other Navy stories. He went to the Middle East for the Suez crisis of 1956. He also had an interesting trip to the Soviet Union. He later was involved in reporting the space program and intelligence matters. A particularly interesting section of the memoir deals with Baldwin's discussion of the Robert McNamara regime while Kennedy was President. Concludes with coverage of the initial years of the Vietnam War.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBarnaby, Ralph S. Captain, U.S. Navy (Ret)\n\nBased on one interview conducted by John T.

He began developing gliders not long after the pioneering work of Orville and Wilbur Wright. The memoir of his naval service focuses primarily on his glider experiences, including his achievement as the first person to descend by glider from an airship, the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), in 1930. He later used gliders in naval aviation training at Pensacola, Florida. During World War II he was an engineer at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia and commanding officer of the Naval Air Modification Unit at Johnsville, Pennsylvania.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBarnes, Dr. Samuel E., (Member of the Golden Thirteen)\n\nBased on three interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell from November 1986 through May 1989.

The transcript is copyright 1993 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nAfter a boyhood in Oberlin, Ohio, Barnes attended Oberlin College in the same town, graduating in 1936. He excelled in sports, particularly football and track, in both high school and college. He worked for five years as an athletic coach at Livingstone College in North Carolina, later enlisted in the Navy in September 1942. He served as an athletic specialist until tapped to enter an officer training program. He was commissioned an ensign in March 1944, one of the Navy's first 13 black officers. After initial duty running athletic programs at Great Lakes, Illinois, he was sent to Williamsburg, Virginia, for training and later commanded a black stevedore battalion on Okinawa. After World War II he returned to civilian life and earned both his master's degree and doctorate. In 1947 Barnes joined the faculty of Howard University in Washington, D.C. He coached a number of sports and later was athletic director from 1956 to 1970. Subsequently he was with Federal City College and the University of the District of Columbia. From 1970 to 1972 Dr. Barnes was on the executive committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the first black person to achieve that honor.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBauernschmidt, George W., Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on eight interviews conducted by John T.

The transcript is copyright 1991 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use. This is a revised version of the original, which was issued in 1970. The new version has been completely retyped, annotated with footnotes, and given a detailed index.\n\nAdmiral Bauernschmidt was a 1922 Naval Academy graduate who spent the first ten years of his commissioned service as a line officer and then switched reluctantly to the Supply Corps to avoid being retired for color blindness. He thus brought a line officer's perspective and feeling for the prerogatives of command to the Supply Corps. He tells his story with a nice sense of humor and expresses frustration at the number of his recommendations not accepted. He served in the battleships North Dakota (BB-29) andNew Mexico (BB-40) in the 1920s, the Nevada (BB-36) in the 1930s, and as supply officer of the New York (BB-34) in the years leading up to World War II. In the late 1920s he commanded the submarine R-2 (SS-79) and in the 1930s served in the tenderBeaver (AS-5). In the early 1930s he had an interesting tour in American Samoa. During World War II, Bauernschmidt helped set up the U.S. naval supply depot in Oran, North Africa, to support Allied operations in the Mediterranean. Later in the war, he served ashore in France, at the supply depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and commanded the huge naval supply depot on Guam. Afterward, he helped rewrite U.S. Navy Regulations and commanded naval supply centers at Pearl Harbor (during the Korean War) and at Clearfield, Utah. During his career he also had tours of duty in the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts in Washington, D.C. In 1953, Bauernschmidt's daughter Sarah married Stuart Murray, the son of the rear admiral who lived next door at Pearl Harbor.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBenson, Roy S., Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.) Volume I and II\n\nVolume I\n\nBased on seven interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from March 1980 through April 1980. The volume contains 459 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1984 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the restrictions originally placed on the transcript by the interviewee have since been removed.\n\nIn this first volume of Admiral Benson's oral history, he recalls his early years with his Swedish family in New Hampshire, and his days at the Naval Academy, where athletics were not of as much interest as music. Following graduation in 1929, he served first in the New York (BB-34), and then on the Smith Thompson (DD-212) on the Asiatic Station. Benson gives a real feel for the flavor of China in the mid-1930s, and it is here that he has his first experience with what is to become his specialty - submarines. He attends submarine school and has various duties before joining the Nautilus (SS-168), in which he served during that submarine's presence at the Battle of Midway. Later, as commanding officer of the USS Trigger (SS-237) his ship was credited with sinking almost 30,000 tons of Japanese shipping. Some key subjects discussed by Admiral Benson include the sinking of the Cochino (SS-345) while on an interesting mission in 1949, magnetic exploders, the use of submarines in antisubmarine warfare, and submarine tactics and safety measures. The last assignment discussed is Benson's duty in the unpopular billet of Director of Public Information for the Navy at the beginning of the Korean War. He provides anecdotes about many famous officers he came into contact with, including Forrest Sherman, Page Smith, George Marshall, William Fechteler, and Hyman Rickover.\n\nVolume II\n\nBased on 11 interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from April 1980 through August 1980. The volume contains 486 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1987 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the restrictions originally placed on the transcript by the interviewee have since been removed.\n\nAdmiral Benson begins this concluding volume of his memoir by describing his service in command of the attack transport Bayfield in 1953-1954, followed by command of Amphibious Squadron Six. At the time, duty in the amphibious forces was not considered particularly career-enhancing for naval officers, but it proved to be so in the case of Benson, because he was subsequently selected for flag rank during the course of a tour of duty in charge of Navy recruiting at the Bureau of Naval Personnel. As a rear admiral, he was a cruiser division commander in the Pacific and then Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service. His telling of that period provides a useful description of the interplay between the Navy and the U.S. merchant marine. One of the admiral's most enjoyable tours was as Commander Submarine Force Pacific Fleet from 1960 to 1962, at a time when nuclear submarines were still a novelty in that ocean. Then followed a five-year tour on the OpNav staff as Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Operations/Director of Naval Administration. This is unusual oral history material because of the considerable detail provided on the routine aspects of naval administrative matters. In many cases, oral histories concentrate on high-level decision-making, but the reality is that the paperwork must still be accomplished, and Admiral Benson provides rare insight into that aspect. The volume concludes with his description of service as Commandant First Naval District prior to his retirement from active duty in 1969.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBeshany, Philip A., Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nVolume I\n\nBased on nine interviews conducted by John T.

The transcript is copyright 1980 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the transcript requires the written permission of the interviewee to quote or cite in published works.\n\nA 1938 graduate of the Naval Academy, Admiral Beshany served in the new light cruiser Philadelphia before going into submarines. After duty in the S-14, he was executive officer of the fleet boat Scamp (SS-277) from 1942 to 1944, participating in seven war patrols. He was then exec of the Quillback during the Okinawa campaign and the occupation of Japan. He later commanded the submarines Billfish (SS-268), Burrfish (SS-312), and Amberjack (SS-522). Shore tours included postgraduate instruction at Annapolis, repair officer at the submarine base in New London, and duty as head of the prospective commanding officers' course for submarines. While on the ComSubLant staff, he worked closely with the Navy's first nuclear-powered submarines. After graduation from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Admiral Beshany had a tour as commanding officer of the fleet oiler Salamonie.\n\nBased on nine interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from November 1977 through January 1979. The volume contains 505 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1983 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the transcript requires the written permission of the interviewee to quote or cite in published works.\n\nIn this concluding volume Admiral Beshany discusses his command of Submarine Squadron 4 in the early 1960s during the transition from diesel to nuclear powered subs, duty as chief of staff to Deputy Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet during the tragic period when Thresher was lost, and the ground work involved in setting up facilities for U.S. Polaris submarines in Rota, Spain. Subsequent duties included a staff position with Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe in the mid-1960s and Director of Submarine Warfare during the development phases of the Los Angeles-class attack submarine. In this position Beshany was in the thick of the ongoing technical versus operational argument being waged within the OpNav staff. His next duty as an amphibious group commander gave him a new appreciation of the importance of this special type of warfare and the complexity of joint exercises. The 1970s found Beshany back at the Pentagon, first as Assistant Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Fleet Operations and Readiness) and then during the reorganization of the OpNav staff he was made the first Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Submarine Warfare) over the objections of Admiral Rickover. In discussing this period Beshany candidly assesses his boss, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. Beshany's final tour was as Commander, U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, a position that gave him cause to question our politically motivated shunning of that country. Admiral Beshany served in this post until his retirement in August 1974.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBieri, Bernhard H., Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on seven interviews conducted by John T.

The volume contains 260 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1995 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nIn this engaging memoir, Mr. Bond serves as a representative for hundreds of thousands of enlisted men whose only active military service was during World War II. He enlisted in the Navy in 1942, took boot training at San Diego, and then reported to the destroyerSaufley (DD-465). He was on board for operations around the Solomons late in 1942. In 1943 he joined the navigation gang of the aircraft carrier Saratoga (CV-3), which had been in commission since 1927. Mr. Bond paints a vivid word picture of the living and working conditions in a ship that was outdated but still called upon to take part in a modern war. He talks about the ship's air operations against the Japanese, including a stint in the Indian Ocean with the British. He provides a valuable discussion of the professionalism of the ship's quartermasters. Detached in 1945, Mr. Bond was in the original crew of the patrol craft PCE(R)-858, including her shakedown training and her role in minesweeping operations around Japan after the war was over. Following his Navy discharge in 1946, Mr. Bond received his college education through the GI Bill, then went on to a civilian career as an executive in the trucking industry.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBrashear, Carl M., Chief Boatswains Mate, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on two interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell in November 1989 and March 1990. The volume contains 164 pages of interview transcript plus a comprehensive index. The transcript is copyright 1998 jointly by Carl Maxie Brashear and the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nBrashear grew up on a farm in Kentucky as part of sharecropper's family. After being educated in small segregated schools, he enlisted in the Navy in 1948 and underwent recruit training at Great Lakes, Illinois. After initial duty as a steward, he began handling aircraft for squadron VX-1 at Key West, Florida, and was subsequently rated as a boatswain's mate. He served in the escort carriersPalau (CVE-122) and Tripoli (CVE-64) and began taking training in salvage diving. Other duties were in USS Opportune (ARS-41); Naval Air Station Quonset Point, where he escorted President Dwight Eisenhower; Ship Repair Facility Guam; Deep-Sea Diving School; the submarine tender Nereus (AS-17), and Fleet Training Center Pearl Harbor. He also had temporary duty with Joint Task Force Eight for nuclear tests in the Pacific. He served in the USS Coucal (ASR-8), USS Shakori (ATF-162), and USS Hoist (ARS-40). While on board the latter in 1966 for the recovery of a nuclear weapon off Spain, Brashear was badly injured in an accident; as a result, surgeons amputated his left leg below the knee. He refused to submit to medical survey boards attempting to retire him as unfit for duty. After demonstrating that he could still dive and perform his other duties, he served in Harbor Clearance Unit 2, Naval Air Station Norfolk, Experimental Diving Unit, submarine tender Hunley (AS-31); USS Recovery (ARS-43), Naval Safety Center, and Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activity Norfolk. In 1970 he qualified as the first black master diver in the history of the U.S. Navy.

The volume contains 481 pages of interview transcript plus a comprehensive index. The transcript is copyright 2010 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nThis oral history is particularly noteworthy, because it provides personal recollections from the first African American graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. Brown entered the Academy in 1945, a century after the institution was founded, and graduated in 1949. A handful of black midshipmen had previously been appointed to the school in Annapolis, but all were either pushed out or left of their own volition prior to graduation. Brown spent his youth in Washington, D.C., where he attended segregated Dunbar High and had part-time jobs working for the Navy and Howard University. He was able to succeed at the Naval Academy through a combination of his sunny disposition, academic ability, and perseverance. Following his commissioning in 1949 he had a temporary assignment at the Boston Naval Shipyard prior to undertaking postgraduate study in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1950?51. His subsequent duties as an officer in the Civil Engineer Corps included postings to Bayonne, New Jersey; Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 5 (NMCB-5) in the Philippines and Port Hueneme, California; the headquarters of the Bureau of Yards and Docks in Washington; the Construction Battalion Center, Davisville, Rhode Island; the public works department at the Barbers Point Naval Air Station in Hawaii, temporary duty in Antarctica; a tour at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; and final active duty service, 1965-69, at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. During his time in the Philippines in the 1950s he had a substantial role in the construction of a new aircraft carrier pier in Subic Bay. In the early 1960s he had a leadership role as the Navy's Seabees did construction projects in the Central African Republic, Liberia, and Chad. Following his retirement from active naval service in 1949, Lieutenant Commander Brown worked in several capacities for the State University of New York system and subsequently did facilities and construction work at Howard University in Washington. In May 2008 the Naval Academy dedicated a new athletic field house named in Brown's honor. In his remarks at the dedication of the facility Brown said the naming of the new building symbolizes the Navy's commitment to diversity.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBucklew, Phil H., Captain, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on nine interviews conducted by John T.

One of the Navy's first \"frogmen\" and a charter member of its Scouts and Raiders of World War II, he scouted the beaches at Normandy, Salerno, and Sicily weeks before Allied invasions. Then, moving to China, he slipped by Japanese occupation troops to conduct a 400-mile overland scouting trip of the coastline near Hong Kong. In 1964, Captain Bucklew led a study team to investigate the communist infiltration problems in South Vietnam.

The transcript is copyright 2005 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nIn these interviews conducted the month before Commander Buell died, he was extremely candid in describing his experiences and the people with whom he served. The two major themes in the memoir deal with his service as a destroyerman and his work as a historian. He wrote widely admired biographies of World War II Admirals Ernest J. King and Raymond A. Spruance and later produced a book dealing with Civil War leaders on both the Union and Confederate sides. After he graduated from the Naval Academy in 1958 Buell served in the destroyer Hamner (DD-718) and in the first crew of the guided missile frigate King (DLG-10). After studying at the Naval Postgraduate School, he was in the commissioning crew of the guided missile destroyer escort Brooke (DEG-1). Later duties included serving as technical assistant for weapons at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and as executive officer of the guided missile destroyer John King (DDG-3). From 1970 to 1973 he was at the Naval War College in various capacities, and it was there he began his career as a biographer. His sea command was the destroyer escort Joseph Hewes (DE-1078) from 1973 to 1975. From 1975 to 1979 he taught in the history department of the Military Academy at West Point. Following his retirement from naval service in 1979 he worked in the defense industry for the Honeywell Corporation and Rosemont Company in Minnesota. In the 1990s, living in North Carolina, Buell did consulting work and wrote his Civil War book, The Warrior Generals.

The transcript is copyright 2003 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nThis memoir is a rarity in the Naval Institute collection in that it details the career of a Navy civil servant rather than a uniformed officer. Dick Buescher, as he was known, graduated from Mississippi State College in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. After a brief stint with the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company in Mobile, he joined the staff of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) late in 1941. Though the nature of his jobs changed and the scope of his responsibilities increased over the years, he remained with the Navy until his retirement in 1981. With BuOrd he was a production engineer who oversaw the manufacture of various kinds of ammunition, including rockets and missiles. He emphasized the importance of quality control and uniformity. In the mid-1950s he transferred to the Navy's Special Projects Office and from then until the end of his career had key roles in the development of the Navy's strategic ballistic missile systems - Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident. Included is discussion about the relationship between the government and private defense contractors in developing and producing the many subsystems that were involved in the nuclear-armed Polaris. The memoir includes Buescher's insights on principal individuals involved in the ballistic missile program, Rear Admiral William Raborn, Gordon Pehrson, and Rear Admiral Levering Smith.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBurke, Arleigh A., Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on three interviews conducted by Dr. John T.

Instead, he saw a need to establish plans and policy for the years ahead, and the project grew to include the military and all pertinent governmental agencies. Another area covered was his service on the Korean Armistice Delegation during the early months of its existence (July-December 1951) while fighting continued. He also covers his path-finding efforts as head of OP-30, the Strategic Plans Division of the Navy.\n\nVolume III, Special Series\n\nPart I deals exclusively with the German General Staff, 169 pages.

The transcript is copyright 1983 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the restrictions originally placed on the transcript by the interviewee have since been removed.\n\nThis volume employs a format unusual for oral history. Admiral Burke began by writing a narrative on military history, beginning with the French Army in the late 18th century and proceeding on through World War II. In so doing, he draws a number of lessons on the ways in which military forces have been used and misused during history. This narrative forms the backdrop for his subsequent discussion in the narrative of the establishment in late 1948 of OP-23, a division of the CNO's staff which was created to fight off attempts by the Air Force to take control of naval aviation as part of overall defense unification. The volume concludes with oral history interviews which go into further detail on the points raised by Admiral Burke in his own narrative. Key individuals discussed are CNO Louis Denfeld, VCNO Arthur Radford, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, and Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington. (Two more volumes will conclude Admiral Burke's discussion of OP-23.)\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nBurke, Julian T., Jr., Rear Admiral (Ret.)\n\nBased on 12 interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell from January 1997 to June 1998.

One of his talented junior officers in the Blackfish was Eugene Wilkinson, later the first skipper of the nuclear-powered submarine Nautilus (SSN-571). Davidson discusses war patrols in both Atlantic and Pacific. Another thread running through his career was the detailing of officers, a difficult business that Davidson tackled with finesse. After serving as a department head at the Naval Academy in the early 1950s and commanding the heavy cruiser Albany (CA-123), he returned to Annapolis as Superintendent in the early 1960s.

His active service concluded with two tours as a three-star admiral: 1983 to 1986 as Commander Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet and 1987-89 as Deputy CNO (Air Warfare). In 1988-89 was honored as the Navy's \"Gray Eagle,\" active aviator with the earliest designation. After retirement he worked for a time for the U.S. Naval Institute, which he had previously served as a board member.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nDyer, George C., Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on 15 interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from April 1969 through May 1971. The volume contains 547 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1973 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the restrictions originally placed on the transcript by the interviewee have since been removed.\n\nIn the years before and during World War II, Dyer acquired an intimate view of high-level command through his service on the staffs of Admiral James O. Richardson, Ernest J. King, and Richard L. Conolly. And early submariner, Dyer also served in a number of surface ships, including the battleship Arizona (BB-39), heavy cruiser Indianapolis (CA-35) (with Captain Thomas Kinkaid in command), and light cruiser Astoria (which Dyer commanded). As a flag officer, he commanded Cruiser Division 10; United Nations Blockade and Escort Force (Task Force 95) during the Korean War; Training Command Pacific Fleet, and the Eleventh Naval District. Dyer is the author of Naval Logistics and coauthor of Admiral James O. Richardson's memoir, On the Treadmill to Pearl Harbor.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nDyer, Thomas H., Captain, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on five interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell in August 1983 and September 1983. The volume contains 355 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1986 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nThis is the memoir of one of the most respected codebreakers of World War II. After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1924, Dyer served in the battleship New Mexico (BB-40). During this duty his talent at puzzle-solving came to the attention of communications experts. He was stationed in Pearl Harbor from 1936 to 1945 as head of the Navy's cryptanalytic unit. In an engaging style, Dyer discusses the successes of the unit, including their ability to provide intelligence to the fleet prior to the Battle of Midway. Alas, the communications intelligence community was divided by a good many jealousies, which Dyer discusses candidly, including the relegation of respected analyst Joseph Rochefort to jobs which did not take advantage of his talents. Captain Dyer was one of the first to use an IBM tabulator in his work, and has been called the \"father of machine cryptanalysis.\" After the war he worked at the National Security Agency until his retirement in 1955. Dyer's memoir is particularly valuable for its behind-the-scenes look at the work of a group of men who were unsung heroes of the Pacific War but were long denied appropriate credit because of security restrictions.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nEdwards, Frederick A., Sr., Captain, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on five interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell in February 1992 and March 1992. The volume contains 387 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1992 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nThe majority of this memoir is devoted to Edwards's often detailed recollections of service as a naval engineer. Following graduation from the Naval Academy in 1923 he was a junior officer in battleships and the four-stack destroyer Henshaw (DD-278). He did postgraduate study in naval engineering, then was in the commissioning crews of the cruiser Augusta (CA-31) and destroyer Mahan(DD-364) and taught at the academy. In 1937 he relieved Hyman Rickover as assistant engineer in the battleship New Mexico (BB-40). After duty at Puget Sound Navy Yard, he was the first chief engineer of the battleship North Carolina (BB-55), then spent virtually all of World War II on the destroyer-destroyer escort desk in the Bureau of Ships. In the late 1940s Edwards was on the Atlantic Fleet staff under Marc Mitscher and William Blandy. He later served in the New York Navy Yard, then wound up his career in BuShips before retiring in 1954. In 1953, Hyman Rickover, rather than Edwards, was selected as an EDO rear admiral.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nEller, Ernest M., Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nVolume I\n\nBased on five interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from November 1972 through July 1974. The volume contains 375 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1986 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nIn the first of three planned volumes by a former Director of Naval History, Admiral Eller discusses his boyhood, midshipman years leading to graduation from the Naval Academy in 1925, duty in the battleships Utah (BB-31) and Texas (BB-35), and the submarine S-33 (SS-138). In the 1930s, he served two tours on the faculty of the Naval Academy, where he made the study of leadership a project. A characteristic of this volume is the admiral's ability to place events in the narrative into the broader context of history. For instance, in his discussion of duty with the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, he provides detailed descriptions of various places he visited while on leave in the Far East. In telling of his Utah service, he discusses the ship's role in enhancing fleet antiaircraft gunnery as World War II approached.\n\nVolume II\n\nBased on seven interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., from December 1974 through August 1978. The volume contains 456 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1990 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nThe focus of nearly all of this second volume of Admiral Eller's oral history is World War II. He began with a tour of duty as an observer with the Royal Navy, including service on board the Hood and Prince of Wales before they fought the German Bismarck. When hostilities began for the United States he was gunnery officer of the aircraft carrier Saratoga (CV-3) and was on board when she was torpedoed. In the spring of 1942 he reported to the Pacific Fleet staff of Admiral Chester and served there throughout much of the rest of the war, working mostly in the gunnery section. He was both eyewitness and participant in a great deal of the planning and execution of the South Pacific and Central Pacific campaigns. Besides operating with Admiral Nimitz in Hawaii he made several trips to the forward area to see battle conditions firsthand. At war's end he commanded the attack transport Clay (APA-39). In the postwar period he had public information duty in San Francisco and then in the Navy Department in Washington.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nEngen, Vice Admiral Donald D., U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on nine interviews conducted by Paul Stillwell from August 1994 to December 1994.

The transcript is copyright 2004 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nAfter growing up in California in the 1920s and 1930s, Engen entered the Navy through the V-5 aviation cadet program and was designated a naval aviator in June 1942. In 1943-44 he flew an SB2C Helldiver in Bombing 19 (VB-19) and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In 1944-45 he flew in Bombing-Fighting 19 (VBF-19). Shortly after World War II he worked briefly as a civilian test pilot for Consolidated Vultee and was a student at the University of California at Los Angeles. In the next few years, as a fighter pilot, he was in Fighting 212 (VF-212), Fighter Squadron 52 (VF-52), and Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51). In the summer of 1950, during the Korean War, he was part of the U.S. Navy's first-ever jet sortie in combat. Other tours in the 1950s included General Line School at Monterey, California; Bureau of Aeronautics representative in Dallas; the Empire Test Pilots' School in Britain; and Air Development Squadron Three (VX-3). He served 1955-57 as executive officer of Fighter Squadron 21 (VF-21) and in 1957-59 at the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River. In 1959-61 he was PCO and skipper of Fighter Squadron 21 (VF-21). Early 1960s duties included command of Carrier Air Group 11 and as operations officer in the aircraft carrier Coral Sea (CVA-43). In 1964-65 Engen commanded the ammunition shipMount Katmai (AE-16), was a student at the Naval War College in 1965-66, and in 1966-67 commanded the aircraft carrier America(CVA-66). In the late 1960s he completed his bachelor's degree at George Washington University, headed the Aviation Plans Branch of OpNav, and was selected for flag rank. He served 1969-71 in the Strategic Plans Division of OpNav, then commanded Carrier Division Four, 1971-73. From 1973 to 1976 he was Deputy Commander in Chief U.S. Naval Forces Europe (CinCUSNavEur) in London. During the latter part of 1976 he was Assistant DCNO (Plans and Policy) and from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander in Chief Atlantic Fleet. After Engen retired from active naval service in 1978, he was general manager of Piper Aircraft, Lakeland, Florida, and later worked with Ketron, Inc. On reentering government service in 1982 he was on the National Transportation Safety Board, and later served 1984-87 as Federal Aviation Administration Administrator. His post-retirement activities included flying and work at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nFaulk, Captain, Roland W., U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nBased on four interviews conducted by John T. Mason, Jr., in November 1974. The volume contains 465 pages of interview transcript plus an index and numerous appendices. The transcript is copyright 1990 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nIn a career which was marked by a great deal of administrative work rather than parish duty, Faulk is probably best known for his spirited - and eventually successful - campaign against compulsory church attendance in the Navy. Among his varied duties were service in the battleship Idaho (BB-42) in the late 1930s, at the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines as World War II approached, in the battleship Missouri (BB-63) at the end of the war and immediate postwar period, as chaplain at the Recruit Training Center, Bainbridge, Maryland, as fleet chaplain for the Pacific Fleet, and at the Eleventh Naval District. His recollections of service during World War II are important because of his observations concerning Rear Admiral Robert Workman, wartime Chief of Chaplains, and because of Faulk's role in recruiting chaplains through the V-12 program. He has much to say also on collateral duties of chaplains and on the Navy Relief Society.\n\nreturn to alphabetical list\n\nFelt, Harry D., Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n\nVolume I\n\nBased on four interviews conducted by John T.

The volume contains 470 pages of interview transcript plus an index. The transcript is copyright 1988 by the U.S. Naval Institute; the interviewee has placed no restrictions on its use.\n\nAdmiral Foley, a navy junior, is an engaging storyteller, and his oral memoir benefits from this strength. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1932. After brief surface duty in the cruiser Detroit (CL-8), he entered flight training, earning his wings in 1936. Prior to World War II he served in scouting, observation, and patrol squadrons, participating in the search for Amelia Earhart in 1937. He was a flight instructor at the new Jacksonville Naval Air Station when the United States joined the war. In June 1942 he was assigned as air operations officer in the Hornet (CV-8), and recalls in great detail when he and other survivors were forced to abandon ship when this carrier was sunk that October.
