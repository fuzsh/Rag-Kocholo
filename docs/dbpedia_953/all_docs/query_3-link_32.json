        "text": "Sometimes all you need is a chance at the job. Today I celebrate 3 years on my contract with Morgan Stanley as a Desk Side Support Tech and would like to share my story to encourage someone today. In March 2020 I migrated to be with my wife Shimel and Covid pandemic hit around the same time which delayed my working authorization until March 2021, I was able to start applying to jobs. During this time I did a lot of online tech courses on Coursera such as- Google IT Support Professional certificate and a few others to get job ready skills. I applied to over 100 jobs and only a few called back then ghosted me. As soon as I saw this job posting on indeed.com, I know I was the perfect fit but here comes the doubts- 1. I’m new to the US with no job history in the country, 2. I didn’t have any of the certs listed, 3. I’ve never worked into the financial services sector before and 4. I don’t have a degree. I still decided to apply because I knew that this job was for me and within 10 minutes of applying Diksha Bareja from Compunnel Inc. called me and started the preliminary interview. The ball started rolling and I was able to get an interview date set. I will never forget when I spoke to Komal Dipsingh the IT manager, I was kinda nervous, but we had a great interview. At the end he said to me that I don’t have the corporate experience or certs needed for the job but he will take a chance with me because my resume looked promising. 3 years later and I’m still in the role and expanded my knowledge and skills which helped me be a stronger support and resource to the Financial Advisors and support staff members that I work with today in the Boston Markets. During my 3 years I was also able to pass my certifications in CompTIA A+, Network+ and Microsoft office specialist certifications in- Word & PowerPoint. I am also currently enrolled in Quinsigamond Community College doing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering- Computer Support Option & a certificate in PC Support Specialist. Thanks to all who played a role in my success and to the person who is looking for a start in their career, don’t give up and keep on trying because God helps those who help themselves. Best regards, Don"
