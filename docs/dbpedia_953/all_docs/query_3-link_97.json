        "text": "Welcome to the Donald S. Collins Early Learning Center! The Board of Directors, administrators, and teaching staff are excited about our new location off Montreat Road, behind the First Baptist Church.\n\nWe serve infants through pre-K, and also offer afterschool and summer enrollment for Kindergartners through 2nd grade. Our staff provide a quality early childhood education that each child deserves as they prepare for kindergarten. Families are a childâ€™s first teacher, but partnered with our staff we hope to provide a warm, caring, and positive full-day early learning experience. We value each child and family, and our doors are always open to you so that together we will learn and grow together. We are excited to serve you and your child!"
