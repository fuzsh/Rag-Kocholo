        "text": "The Black Hawk County landfill in northeast Iowa is now recycling its methane emissions into usable natural gas. The landfill has been made airtight to trap methane from the decomposing trash. It is then piped into a newly constructed plant, where it is cleaned of impurities and transported by trailer to Illinois for distribution.\n\nConstruction of the facility began in 2022 with the goal of reducing the county landfill’s carbon footprint. Two years later, with construction completed, Black Hawk County Solid Waste Commission Chair Brain Heath says that’s exactly what’s happening so far.\n\n“We’ve got an annual reduction of 5,000 tons of methane, 13,000 tons of CO2 and will bring in an estimated $70,000 of revenue after the first year of operation.”\n\nThe Illinois plant currently provides gas service to Wisconsin’s Dane County, with direct pipelines to other places planned next year.\n\nThe start of the school year was delayed for students in Rock Valley, where both the public and private schools were damaged by severe flooding. But after two months of repairs and preparation, classes are set to begin next week.\n\nWhen the Rock River rushed out of its banks in late June, it damaged 40% of homes in Rock Valley. It also flooded classrooms and ruined books at Rock Valley Community Schools and Rock Valley Christian.\n\nState and local officials spent the next eight weeks scrambling to get the schools ready to reopen on Sept. 5.\n\nAt an appearance with Gov. Kim Reynolds celebrating the start of the school year Thursday, the principal of Rock Valley Christian said buses are coming from as far away as New York to replace ones that were ruined.\n\nIn the public schools, many rooms are still unusable, so Superintendent Matt Van Voort says some classes will meet at a local church or in a 7,000 square foot modular building built for the district. But students will be back in person in Rock Valley, and he says that shows the power of community.\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand, the only Iowa Democrat who holds a statewide office, said the state-funded Education Savings Accounts for private school students is a big worry for Iowans.\n\nDuring a town hall meeting in Delaware County this week, Sand told residents that he is carefully following the program's progress, which Gov. Kim Reynolds calls one of her greatest achievements.\n\nSand said the \"vouchers program really is a very consistent concern for people,\" and he added that people should be concerned. He said hundreds of millions of dollars are being sent to private schools with no audit obligation and no rules.\n\nOver 30,000 private school students in Iowa have qualified for ESAs this year. When fully implemented, Iowa will be among eight states where all private school students are eligible for state funding to cover tuition and other expenses.\n\nAs he travels the state on his 100 Town Hall Tour, Sand said this is a topic he hears about frequently, as it relates to his role in serving Iowans as the “taxpayers’ watchdog.”\n\nSand said if any Iowans notice something suspicious or have concerns about financial irregularities in their local governments and entities, they can submit a confidential tip to his office online.\n\nThe USDA announced seven new projects, including one in Iowa, aimed at increasing domestic fertilizer production and lowering prices for farmers.\n\nFertilizer prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022, in part due to supply disruptions from the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn response, the USDA created the Fertilizer Production Expansion Program. It gives grants to companies to help them modernize equipment, develop new technologies and build production plants.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack spoke at the Farm Progress Show in Boone Wednesday.\n\n“Today, we are pleased to announce a continuation of our effort to expand more fertilizer production in this country, so we are more self-reliant and more dependent on our own capacities, as opposed to capacities from some other country.”\n\nOne of the grant recipients, Quality Flow Environmental in Maquoketa, is getting a $4.7 million grant to convert dairy waste into fertilizer. To date, the USDA has awarded nearly $300 million to 64 projects across the U.S.\n\nRead more.\n\nIowa Democrats say the state’s Area Education Agencies are starting the school year with 429 fewer employees than last year. That’s after Republicans in the Iowa Legislature made changes to the system’s funding and structure.\n\nIowa’s nine AEAs reported a loss of staff ranging from 9-18%.\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Lindsay James of Dubuque says that’s “distressing.”\n\n“Four hundred twenty-nine fewer staff means that there are 429 fewer providers and professionals providing early childhood special education, crisis intervention and mental health, literacy, math, professional development. So, there are 429 fewer folks taking care of our kids.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers say they don’t know how many of those people have taken other education jobs in Iowa.\n\nAEAs are leaving a lot of media and education services jobs open this year because of a funding shift from AEAs to school districts. Special education funding hasn’t been changed yet, but some AEA leaders say it’s hard to hire for special education positions because educators are looking for job stability.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture is predicting a roughly 25% dip in on-farm income for 2024.\n\nDuring the Farm Progress Show in Boone on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said when compared to the previous three-year periods, the stretch from 2021 to 2023 generated some of the best farm income in the last five decades.\n\nBut, he said, roughly 85% of that income went to fewer than 8% of farms in the U.S.\n\n“We cannot only make sure that production agriculture continues to prosper and takes advantage of all this amazing innovation that you're surrounded by at the Farm Progress Show, but that we also figure out ways in which we can support our small and mid-sized farm.”\n\nVilsack said the USDA has been working on this, and he gave the example of nearly a billion dollars in funding for over 180 livestock processing facilities across the country.\n\nVilsack also talked about investments to expand ethanol blends and local food purchasing agreements with schools and food banks.\n\nRead more.\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Commission has officially granted a permit for Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed CO2 pipeline. However, there are more steps to come before there is any construction.\n\nThe IUC said in a ruling Wednesday that Summit had filed most of the documents the agency demanded when it partially granted a permit back in June.\n\nOpposing landowners raised objections to the IUC’s latest decision. They said Summit still has not made all the required changes to its pipeline route.\n\nThe IUC mostly rejected those claims but said Summit must clear other hurdles before beginning construction. For instance, Summit cannot build in Iowa until it has approval in North and South Dakota.\n\nThis week, Summit began hosting public meetings to discuss plans to expand the original project.\n\nA health insurance company is investing millions of dollars into mental telehealth services in K-12 public school districts in Iowa.\n\nJust this week, the Cedar Rapids Community School District received $1.5 million from Minnesota-based health insurer UnitedHealth Group as part of a one-year pilot program.\n\nThe district’s superintendent, Tawana Grover, says the money will help fund an online telehealth portal that students can use to access mental health counseling.\n\n“It's one thing to check in. It's another thing to spend 30 minutes or an hour with someone that is solely focused on your needs, what you need, what you're dealing with and helping to not only listen to, [but] to provide you with strategies that you can use whenever you go beyond the session.”\n\nThe provider is Hazel Health, which focuses on school-based care.\n\nUnitedHealth says its funding is aimed at providing these resources to historically underserved and rural communities. In the end, they hope to impact 100,000 students.\n\nAs of Wednesday, UnitedHealth has funded the creation of two such programs in Des Moines and Council Bluffs. No rural programs have been announced.\n\nAt the Farm Progress Show near Boone on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack talked about steps toward developing a bird flu vaccine for dairy cows.\n\nVilsack said the USDA has authorized an H5N1 vaccine for dairy cows to move toward the field trial stage, which began this week at the Center for Veterinary Biologics in Ames. Since March, the virus has been confirmed in nearly 200 herds across 13 states, including Iowa.\n\nWhile dairy cows typically recover, H5N1 is highly contagious and lethal to chickens and turkeys. According to the CDC, four people have contracted the virus from sick dairy cows and nine people this year have gotten sick from handling infected chickens.\n\nVilsack said more publicly funded research is needed to prepare for and respond to livestock diseases.\n\n“We invest a lot of money in healthcare research in this country — tons of it — millions, billions of it. And we beg, borrow and steal for ag research money.”\n\nRead more.\n\nA University of Iowa study finds that many Americans affected by storm damage are hesitant to take advantage of low-interest government loans.\n\nCameron Ellis, a professor at UI’s Tippie College of Business, says he was surprised to find over a quarter of property owners surveyed turned down the loans because they thought the interest rate was too high. Ellis says the rates are almost always lower than the market rate and cheaper than alternative funding sources.\n\n“The interest rates on these things are often cheaper than treasury rates. So like, the government can’t borrow at this rate.”\n\nHe says the terms of these loans are not as restrictive as most people think.\n\n“It's not like student loans. If you go bankrupt, the loan gets wiped out in bankruptcy. It’s not stuck with you forever.”\n\nThe Small Business Administration has been urging Iowans with damage from this year’s floods and storms to apply for low-interest loans. Ellis says Congress has discussed eliminating the federal subsidy for the programs, but that would push rates up and reduce participation, increasing the pressure on homeowners.\n\nRepublican officials on Iowa’s state objection panel voted Wednesday to take three Libertarian candidates for Congress off the ballot. They agreed with GOP objectors that the timing of this year’s Libertarian county conventions did not follow state law.\n\nFirst Congressional District candidate Nicholas Gluba, 3rd District candidate Marco Battaglia and 4th District candidate Charles Aldrich will not be on the ballot unless they successfully appeal the decision in court by Sept. 3.\n\nSecretary of State Paul Pate and Attorney General Brenna Bird, both Republicans, voted to remove them from the ballot. Pate says political candidates need to do their homework on ballot access rules.\n\n“It’s not an ideal situation but the rules are the rules, and I, as the commissioner of elections, don’t get to make them up. I get to enforce them as they are. And I think this is not an easy process.”\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat, voted to keep the Libertarians on the ballot. He says issues with internal political party business aren’t a basis for removing candidates from the ballot.\n\nLibertarian Party of Iowa Chair Jules Cutler says she is disappointed in the decision but not surprised.\n\n“It is about silencing us. Yes, it is about making sure that they are better positioned to win. If you want to win, how about you campaign, not silence other people.”\n\nThe three candidates say they’ll run write-in campaigns if their names cannot be on the ballot.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct the last name of Libertarian Party of Iowa Chair Jules Cutler.\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand says his office will conduct an audit of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown.\n\nHe says the audit comes at the request of Sue Cahill, D-Marshalltown. Cahill told Sand that the audit is needed after the unexpected layoffs of 11 full-time staff in July. She says these cuts were made without input from the Legislature and occurred despite the home receiving an additional $1 million in state funding during the budget process.\n\nCahill says in her letter to Sand that the cuts are in direct conflict of their mission to “provide a continuum of care to Iowa’s veterans and their spouses in an environment focusing on individualized services to enhance their quality of life.”\n\nKarl Lettow of the Iowa Veterans Home released a statement in response saying the home will “fully cooperate” with the audit.\n\nHe also claims the layoffs are being misrepresented.\n\n“The assertions that 11 employees were laid off and the realignment would negatively affect our quality of care are objectively, verifiably false. The fact that new positions were simultaneously created has been consistently, selectively omitted by multiple sources. In the end, the vast majority of the affected staff filled the new positions created by the realignment and three were promoted. Three others will pursue other opportunities.”\n\nThe Riverboat Foundation held an emergency meeting this summer to decide if they would grant the Kalona Historical Society funds to transport a barn from 20 miles away onto the property. They awarded them $300,000.\n\nThere is nothing particularly special about the barn, and Historian Michael Zahs says that's the point.\n\n“I think a lot of times when we preserve things for the future, we do not preserve what is normal,” he said. “We preserve the mansions and the eight-sided barns and the round barns. And so are we going to be raising a whole generation of people that think that was normal?\"\n\nThe barn is one of several projects the village has taken on to deepen the understanding of Iowa’s history.\n\nThe Wahl Museum, which sits on the property, was recently rebuilt and updated with new exhibits, including a streetscape of early 20th century Kalona.\n\n“When people walk in here ... they're pretty surprised and shocked as to what this looks like,” said Nancy Roth, managing director of the village. “This isn't a small-town looking museum. This is a big-city looking museum, and that's something that excites us.”\n\nIn addition to managing the ongoing projects, Roth is preparing for the upcoming Kalona Fall Festival, held on the historic village grounds Sept. 27-28. The event features food, entertainment and old-world demonstrations.\n\nRead more from Natalie Dunlap.\n\nIowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig says the final round of Local Food for Schools grants are out for this year. Schools use the grants to buy meat, eggs, produce, dairy and other local foods from area farmers.\n\n“What this is all about is providing some small grants — $2,000 — to those school districts, and that will be an incentive for them to buy locally.”\n\nThe program is entering its third year, and Naig says in this round, 137 public and private schools were awarded grants. He says through the first two rounds, more than $1.7 million was awarded to 162 Iowa schools, and more than 110 farms and food businesses sold products to schools through the program.\n\n“While we’re able to supply […] what schools are looking for in terms of today, right now, I think this is an area that’s growing. So, I believe we’re going to see increased interest in schools and institutions looking to buy local. And I think we’re going to be seeing either an expansion of — and the addition of — some farms that are going to try to supply that marketplace.”\n\nA list of schools approved for grants is available here.\n\nAs the school year begins, Iowa’s Area Education Agencies and school districts are implementing a new law that shifts some AEA funding to school districts and moves oversight of special education from AEAs to the state.\n\nOver the summer, AEA leaders had to figure out what to charge school districts for media and educational services under the new \"fee for service” model, find out which services each district wants from their AEA and figure out how to provide them after hundreds of employees left since AEA changes were proposed by Gov. Kim Reynolds.\n\n\"Going from the system we are in to what the new reality of the system looks like has been just a lot of learning, research [and] connecting with colleagues to get that stood up on a short timeline,” said Cindy Yelick, chief administrator of Heartland Area Education Agency.\n\nThis year, the law signed by Reynolds in March shifts 60% of AEA funding for media and educational services to school districts. They can decide to buy specific services from an AEA, get similar services elsewhere or use the money for something different.\n\nNext school year, districts will have control over all of the media and education services money that previously flowed directly to AEAs — about $68 million. The law will also shift 10% of special education funding to school districts, leaving 90% with the AEAs.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nIt has been just a couple of months since Iowa was declared free of drought, but Tim Hall doesn’t want people to forget the lessons learned from the historic dry spell.\n\nHall, a hydrology resources coordinator at the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, worries about apathy setting in after a relatively quick recovery from drought conditions. When he talks to water utility operators around the state, he has a common piece of advice.\n\n“Think back to the last couple of years, and what did you wish you had done beforehand, before you got into the drought? Make a note of that and then go do it, because we’re gonna return to drought conditions at some point.”\n\nHall says while the rains in June got a lot of attention, Iowa actually began recovering from the four-year drought in October of last year. In six of the eight following months, Iowa saw above average precipitation.\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Commission held a hearing Tuesday to review potential changes to the state’s renewable energy rules.\n\nEnvironmental groups claim the rules, written in 2017, are outdated and have been used by utilities to mislead Iowans about their renewable energy usage. They want them rescinded and new rules put in place.\n\nJosh Mandelbaum, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, shared an example from MidAmerican Energy, which claimed to provide 100% renewable energy to customers in 2022.\n\n“The lead statement of that press release is a false statement and obscured the fact that MidAmerican continues to operate several coal plants in the state.”\n\nMidAmerican Energy’s Arick Sears said the allegation is false.\n\n“It's not how we do business. We don't look to mislead our customers, or to pull a bait-and-switch. So that is something with which I would significantly disagree. But I do believe that there are, through this rulemaking, some opportunities to evolve the Chapter 30 rules to accommodate what current customers are looking for.”\n\nThe commission asked all concerned parties who attended the hearing to submit comments about proposed changes to the rules next month.\n\nPolice in a central Iowa city are telling residents not to approach a water buffalo that is roaming around.\n\nPleasant Hill police say they were called about an animal in the road Saturday, and it turned out to be a water buffalo. The owner of the animal told police it is aggressive, which proved to be true when Animal Control tried to contain it.\n\nA police officer eventually fired one round from a shotgun at the water buffalo after police say it became aggressive toward them. The animal then fled and remains on the loose.\n\nPleasant Hill police are working with the Polk County Sheriff’s Office to use a drone to try to locate the animal.\n\nIowans who want to vote by mail can now start requesting absentee ballots for this fall’s election.\n\nTuesday is the first day county auditors can accept applications for absentee ballots.\n\nIowa State Association of County Auditors President Becky Bissell says it’s good for Iowans to request ballots sooner rather than later to allow for processing at the auditor’s office and for mail times.\n\n“It’s really important to get them in ahead of time so that you have more days at home to fill out your ballot, and then that also gives you more days that you can get it mailed back to us.”\n\nBissell says Iowans who want to vote by mail should make sure they are registered to vote. Voters can then print an absentee ballot request form online or call their county auditor to have an application mailed to them.\n\nCompleted ballot request forms must be mailed or delivered to the voter’s county auditor. County auditors can start sending ballots to voters on Oct. 16.\n\nRead IPR's voter guide.\n\nA former Republican congressional candidate is endorsing a Democrat in the November election.\n\nKevin Virgil lost the June primary against incumbent Rep. Randy Feenstra by 20 points in the 4th District.\n\nOver the weekend, Virgil posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that voters should consider splitting their tickets to support former president Trump for the White House and Democrat Ryan Melton for Congress.\n\n“I'd rather have somebody who's intellectually honest about what they stand for, rather than somebody like Feenstra who doesn't really meet with the public and then just votes the way his corporate donors tell him to.”\n\nVirgil and Melton both oppose carbon capture pipelines and want to try to lower cancer rates, but disagree on other issues like abortion and government spending.\n\nFeenstra released a statement that says Virgil is an “East Coast liberal” who chooses to endorse a Democrat who will block Trump’s agenda. Virgil moved to rural Sutherland in O’Brien County late last year.\n\nMelton says it’s unprecedented that Virgil would back him over incumbent Feenstra. He’s surprised, but he understands based on what he says voters tell him on the campaign trail.\n\n“There's a lot of anger right now among Republicans against their party leadership, and that anger is justified because their party leadership continues to sell them out to their donors.”\n\nVirgil says even though they disagree on many issues, Melton has integrity and the same viewpoint on fighting carbon capture pipelines, lowering high cancer rates and improving rural Iowa.\n\n“I think it's time for people to start deprioritizing party loyalty and think about electing the leaders that actually want to solve the problems.”\n\nVirgil says blind party loyalty has not helped Iowa in terms of education, poverty, mental health and support for family farms. But when it comes to the top of the ticket, he wants Trump back in office.\n\nPolk County has extended its Extreme Temperature Plan until Thursday morning to give people a place to escape the heat.\n\nThe plan lowers the barrier to entry at homeless shelters and designates official cooling centers across the city – including at public libraries and community centers. It also allows free rides to these locations via the DART bus system.\n\nBrett McIntyre, the emergency management program assistant for Polk County, says increasing access to these shelters can reduce heat-related illnesses and take pressure off emergency rooms and other city services.\n\n“So the more avenues we can give people to get to places to cool down – we can try to eliminate that extra burden on our healthcare system.”People looking to use the cooling centers are advised to call ahead to check if they are currently open.\n\nA full list is available at polkcounty.gov.\n\nThe last holiday of summer is just ahead, and tens of thousands of Iowans will hit the road for the Labor Day weekend.\n\nAAA spokesman Brian Ortner says the record-breaking summer travel season will wrap up with what's anticipated to be another exceptionally busy holiday for vacations.\n\n“The Labor Day weekend is up 9% compared to last year, and the good news is that the cost of travel domestically is down 2%. So, it's great for consumers, and great to see people back out on the roads and taking that last summer trip.\"\n\nSince most Iowa kids are already back in school, regional road trips tend to be the most popular Labor Day option for families. Because of that, Ortner says other vacationers see this as an opportunity to travel the world, with the expectation of smaller crowds at popular destinations.\n\n\"Domestic airfares are 2% less compared to last year. Hotels are up a little bit compared to last year, about 7%, but that balances out if you're renting a car, which is 16% cheaper this Labor Day holiday compared to last year.\"\n\nThe majority of vacationers over Labor Day will be traveling by motor vehicle, and while electric cars are becoming more common, most cars, trucks and SUVs still run on gasoline. Ortner does not expect any major jumps in gas prices in Iowa before the weekend.\n\n\"Gas prices, thankfully, have remained steady, hovering around that $3.20 per gallon average across the state. And even with the popularity of summer road trips, gas demand is down. Daily driving habits have changed post-pandemic, tempering price spikes.\"\n\nGas prices vary widely across Iowa. The most expensive fuel is reported in Dubuque at $3.35 per gallon, while Sioux City has the cheapest gas at $2.98.\n\nThe State Hygienic Laboratory confirmed the first case of West Nile virus this year in a man in Harrison County.\n\nIowa State University entomologist Ryan Smith oversees the state’s mosquito surveillance program. He says this year’s heavy rainfall and flooding have led to a “big explosion” in the number of mosquitoes, especially in western Iowa.\n\n“Mosquitoes take advantage of standing water. Any kind of flowing or moving water doesn’t allow for the juvenile stages of mosquitoes to survive. And so they really do thrive on that flooded or standing water in many of these locations.”\n\nThe state health department recommends dumping out standing water to help cut the number of mosquitoes, which Smith agrees with.\n\n“These mosquitoes usually don’t travel very far, and so if you can reduce places where they might breed, then more than likely you’re also going to reduce the impact of where you might find adult mosquitoes.”\n\nThe health department also recommends wearing mosquito repellent when outdoors to prevent mosquito bites, especially when they are most active at dawn and dusk.\n\nThose infected with West Nile may not experience any signs or symptoms of the virus, according to the health department. Some people experience minor symptoms, like fever and mild headache, while others can develop serious symptoms such as a high fever, headache, disorientation and muscle weakness. There were 17 confirmed cases of West Nile virus in 2023 and one death.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds says it’s critical to ensure Iowa has enough electricity and upgraded water treatment plants to support business expansion.\n\n“Especially for rural Iowa, we need to figure that out,” Reynolds told Radio Iowa during a recent interview. “We’ve got a lot of capacity in rural Iowa, but if you don’t have the load capacity or you don’t have the water treatment capacity, it’s hard for those existing businesses to expand or think about locating there.”\n\nWater treatment plants are expensive. For larger communities, it can cost $12 million for a plant that can handle an average of ten million gallons per day.\n\nReynolds said the cost for smaller communities, while less, cannot be easily borne by residents who’d pay higher utility bills to pay for it.\n\n“The populations aren’t where they need to be to sustain it.”\n\nThe State Revolving Fund provides communities with low interest loans to finance drinking water systems, water treatment facilities and sewers, but Reynolds said she’s asked the director of the Iowa Economic Development Authority to review the range of state incentives that are available — and what could be proposed for the future.\n\nThe EPA recently announced a dozen drinking water systems in Iowa need upgrades to remove so-called “forever chemicals” that are linked to sites where firefighters have used foam to quickly put out fires.\n\nSeveral Midwestern states are encouraging older farmers to give farmland access to the next generation.\n\nA new program in Missouri aims to make it easier for beginning farmers to get access to land by offering tax deductions to incentivize older farm owners to sell or rent their land to those trying to get started.\n\nKristine Tidgren, a professor at Iowa State University and the director for its Center for Agricultural Law and Taxation, says the new program is part of a growing effort to help the industry. That’s as both the average age for farmers and the number of beginners continues to grow.\n\n“We need them to come in and fill in, because our current farmers aren't going to be able to continue to farm forever.”\n\nJoe Lau—who farms outside of Kansas City—knows how hard it is to get started as a new farmer. He says he’s excited to see how Missouri’s new program will incentivize landowners to work with beginners.\n\n“You know, I would just encourage those people with those resources, the landowners, to consider a young beginning farmer when they, when they go to rent, even if it wasn't just for the tax benefits, just the fact to get a little bit of new blood into farming.”\n\nOther states, including Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska, have their own incentive programs to encourage land transition to younger farmers.\n\nRead more from Héctor Alejandro Arzate.\n\nThousands of kids in Iowa head back to school this month and not all of them are required to be immunized against certain communicable diseases. Last school year, about 3% of Iowa school kids were granted religious or medical exemptions. Some parents who comply with the immunization requirement still feel herd immunity or natural immunity would be better for their kids than a shot.\n\nTo achieve herd immunity and natural immunity, you need to get infected with the virus. This means you may be rolling the dice and hoping that your child’s body will survive the disease without short or long term severe consequences.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, a leading expert on viruses and vaccines, explains the reason vaccines are helpful and effective comes down to the way they work in the body.\n\n“If you're naturally infected with measles, measles will reproduce itself in your body thousands and thousands of times and can cause serious and occasionally fatal infection. If you're inoculated with a measles vaccine, the virus can reproduce itself ten, 15, 20 times and then stop.”\n\nRead more from Farah Yousry.\n\nWaterloo school board members will vote Monday night to either withdraw a plan to merge the city’s high schools or put it on November’s ballot for voter approval.\n\nThe plan would convert Central Middle School to a high school for all 10th through 12th graders to attend. Middle schoolers would be moved elsewhere. It’s funded with an existing statewide sales tax that didn’t require voter approval when the school board passed the plan in July.\n\nVoters brought a petition to the board two weeks ago asking the plan to be put on the ballot.\n\nWaterloo Community School District Superintendent Jared Smith says the merger would help graduation rates improve because more students would have easier access to the career center. He says another goal is to close achievement gaps.\n\n“We are a minority majority district. So, we got 60 plus percent of our students who are of color, and we do feel like this high school project would meet the needs of all students and we would see academic success in closing that achievement gap with all of our students.”\n\nOpponents to the plan are concerned with the cost of the project and transportation. One board member has said the district hasn’t done enough to address the cultures of the high schools merging.\n\nDespite record flooding in northwest Iowa and a record number of tornadoes across the state, the relatively mild summer should produce good crop yields.\n\n“In typical La Nina falls, we generally see warmer temperatures, which could be good for agriculture, drying down in the fields,\" State Climatologist Justin Glisan said. \"We don’t need as much propane to dry down the grain. But also, some semblance of a near-normal to slightly wetter pattern for September, October and November. So, it could be shaping up to be another excellent season in fall, as well as summer.”\n\nThough temperatures will be heating up over the weekend, it won't reach the heat levels experienced at this time last year, he said.\n\n“If you remember last year after the state fair, we had two flavors of heat waves. We had one in which dew points were up in the upper 70s and low 80s. So we had heat index values in the 120°-130° range. And then we had a second heat wave that was very dry, low relative humidity, but overall, we haven’t seen heat waves.”\n\nGlisan made his comments on IPR’s River to River on Friday.\n\nA cabinet-level federal administrator is in western Iowa to encourage people who’ve seen their homes and livelihoods damaged or demolished by this year’s severe weather to accept help from the federal government.\n\nAdministrator Isabel Casillas Guzman heads the U.S. Small Business Administration and tells Radio Iowa that the SBA isn’t just devoted to helping small businesses recover, but also helping home owners and renters. She says her team aims to help customers and employees.\n\nGuzman is in the Adair County town of Greenfield, which was hit by an EF-4 tornado in May that killed four people and destroyed 153 homes. It’s been an especially bad year for severe weather in Iowa, with significant damage in multiple counties from storms, flooding, straight-line winds, and a record 122 tornadoes.\n\nGuzman says the SBA has approved over 500 loans of $62 million to residents and businesses across the three disaster declarations.\n\nGuzman plans to visit Greenfield businesses as well as the SBA’s Greenfield Disaster Recovery Center which opened earlier this month. She also plans to host a meet and greet with homeowners to hear about their recovery needs.\n\nFriday afternoon, the administrator will hold a roundtable meeting in West Des Moines with federal, state and local stakeholders, along with business owners and non-profits, to discuss tornado damage recovery efforts. She says the agency’s loans are very affordable.\n\n“These are 30-year terms, so those payments are spread out over quite a long period, and they’re very low cost, as low as 2.68% for homeowners and renters, as well as as low as 4% for businesses and 3.25% for nonprofits,” Guzman says. “We hope to continue to move forward and get as many of those who need help the assistance that they need.”\n\nBefore flying back to Washington D.C, Guzman plans to meet with the owners of BLK & Bold in Des Moines, the first black-owned nationally-distributed coffee company, as part of celebrating National Black Business Month.\n\nOver 40 languages are spoken in the city of Waterloo, often by families of first-generation immigrants to Iowa.\n\nThat has brought on a shortage of translators, and in turn a difficulty for non-native English speakers to connect with essential services.\n\nGlen Keith is the executive director of Love Inc. in the Cedar Valley, one of several area nonprofits that provide community support for non-native English speakers. He says it’s sometimes difficult to connect people with what they need due to a shortage of translators.\n\n“We have such a diverse community here in the Cedar Valley, and oftentimes it bridges misunderstandings and cultural gaps, and being a volunteer-based organization, it’s always tough to find enough translators to talk with folks who need that assistance.”\n\nLove Inc. currently has two translators, one for French and another for Spanish.\n\nWaterloo languages range from Burmese to Bosnian, from Spanish to Congolese French.\n\nSchool district schedules and academic documents are shared in four languages to accommodate families who speak a language other than English at home.\n\n“When you think about legal documents, people applying for different things, there’s an incredible need,” says Keith. “And then you think about all the nonprofits serving this community, we’re all in the same boat asking for help.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Ashley Hinson is speaking out against Vice President Kamala Harris’s southern border policy as outlined in her acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHinson’s comments came after Harris said that the nation can \"reform its broken immigration system” while also criticizing former President Donald Trump for his role in striking down a bipartisan border security bill.\n\nHinson argued in her media call on Friday morning that support died because the bill simply wouldn’t do enough.\n\n“That bill is a nonstarter in the House because it’s like a piece of masking tape over a gushing Niagara Falls. It’s not a realistic plan. It still allows for nearly two million illegal immigrants to come in every year.”\n\nShe also went on to criticize Harris for having not yet met with the head of the Border Patrol Union with just over 70 days before the election.\n\nThis fall, 319 public sector labor unions across the state will vote on whether to recertify their unions. Before contract negotiations can begin, public sector unions have an extra step the private sector doesn’t. More than 50% of the union have to vote “yes.” Any “no” votes, or people who choose not to vote, count against the recertification effort.\n\nThe Iowa State Education Association, which represents teachers, has been critical of the law since it passed in 2017. ISEA President Joshua Brown says if politicians were held to the same standards, reelection would be an impossibility.\n\n“If the governor had to get a majority of people to vote yes to let her stay in office, if you counted every single person that didn’t vote against her, that would not happen.”\n\nHe says even with the new school year starting, his locals are preparing for how to run an election and ensure members are aware it’s happening.\n\nThe election period will run for two weeks in mid-October.\n\nThe South Dakota Supreme Court has ruled in favor of landowners on the route of a proposed CO2 pipeline in a case that questions whether the company behind the project should be allowed to use eminent domain.\n\nMultiple lawsuits from landowners challenged Summit Carbon Solutions’ legal right to survey private property without consent. They also argued that Summit is not a common carrier, which is necessary to use eminent domain.\n\nThe ruling states that granting Summit common carrier status is premature at this point and sent it back to the lower courts for further litigation.\n\nA spokesperson with Summit said, “We are evaluating the South Dakota Supreme Court's decision and look forward to providing the information requested to the district court that reaffirms our role as a common carrier, and that CO2 is a commodity.”\n\nThe Sierra Club of Iowa says the court’s decision is a win for landowners.\n\nLandowners in Iowa are also challenging a state survey law. Oral arguments in front of the Iowa Supreme Court will be held on Oct. 8\n\nScams involving taxes have been around for some time, but the Internal Revenue Service says they are becoming more sophisticated, and now operate online.\n\nThe IRS is partnering with state tax agencies and private groups to combat the growth of scams targeting taxpayers and tax systems.\n\nTerry Lemons, a spokesperson for the agency, says many of these scams now circulate on social media.\n\n“What’s different now is we’re seeing a lot of social media activity on this, and a lot of people only get their information off social media and there’s a lot of bad advice circulating about tax issues on social media. And that’s part of what led us to this effort.”\n\nOne scam involves so-called “ghost preparers.”\n\n“These are people who take a large payment and promise a big refund. We call them ghost preparers because they don’t sign the tax return. And after the return’s filed and they make their money, they disappear, leaving the taxpayer on the hook for whatever consequences are there.”\n\nLemons says a new task force known as the Coalition Against Scam and Scheme Threats, or CASST, will counter the scams through enforcement and education. Along with the IRS and state agencies, the task force includes tax software companies and tax professional organizations. He says any time someone has a question about their taxes, they can call their local IRS branch.\n\nA paid job training program in Des Moines will address barriers to entering the workforce for young adults experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n\nYSS, a nonprofit serving a variety of youth, held a ribbon cutting this week at its Rooftop Gardens hydroponic greenhouse to celebrate the first group of workers that started in July.\n\nSamanthya Marlatt, director of youth empowerment and advocacy at is with YSS, said the main barriers for this cohort finding permanent work are housing, transportation and food access.\n\n“We also have a little kitchenette. We keep it stocked with breakfast items, snacks, stuff to make lunches because what I’ve seen time and time again with workforce programs not designed for this population, is that they will come to programming and leave at noon or so because they don’t have food and they will have to go somewhere that has food.”\n\nThe program includes working in the greenhouse and meeting individual career goals, like earning degrees or certifications. Marlatt says the focus for the first few months is instilling hope in the young adults.\n\nThe goal at the end of the program is for each participant to secure a job or enroll in classes for college or trade school.\n\n“They don’t have time to slow down, think about their passions, think about how they want to be connected to the community or sit in the classroom and be in a place to upskill to get higher level credentials or career pathways. We need to get them out of survival mode and into dreaming mode.”\n\nAdditional help is available in northwest Iowa for victims still trying to recover from historic flooding this summer.\n\nCommunity Action Agency of Siouxland Executive Director Jean Logan says recovering from a natural disaster takes time and money.\n\n“We've all learned a lot about what the limits of federal assistance are, and it's just not going to cover the amount of damage that some of the people have received. You know, people are getting bids to recover that it's going to take $120,000. Well, FEMA property loss caps out at $42,500.”\n\nLogan says one of the biggest challenges is finding contractors to fix homes.\n\n“We have a lot of people that have not got repairs done, that are living in campers, sometimes they're on their property. We still have people that have not had power restored to their homes.”\n\nA long-term recovery group has been formed to help with building materials, food, financial support and mental health services for Woodbury County residents and areas just outside the Sioux City metro area.\n\nLogan hopes the group will continue expanding into other communities as more organizations offer assistance.\n\nThe state of Iowa has launched a new website with the goal of making it easier for families to find child care.\n\nIowans can visit childcareconnect.iowa.gov to search for open child care slots near their home or on their route to work. The search can be filtered by location, type of child care, quality ratings and more. The website doesn’t include prices.\n\nKelly Garcia is director of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. She says she struggled to find child care for her own kids, and this will be an important tool for parents. Garcia says it’ll also allow policymakers to figure out where child care shortages exist so they can consider targeted solutions.\n\n“The power of this data is incredibly valuable to all involved. And again, nearly real-time, which allows us to make decisions today, but probably more importantly allows us to invest for our future.”\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds says it’ll help parents who need daycare and policymakers who want to see which parts of the state need more investment in child care.\n\n“To our knowledge, we believe Iowa is the first state in the nation to integrate and display near real-time child care data from multiple sources in this way, while also improving our child care system statewide.”\n\nState officials say the child care search website cost about $5 million and was paid for with federal American Rescue Plan funding. It’ll take an estimated $500,000 per year to maintain.\n\nRead more.\n\nAn Iowan who has served on the Democratic National Committee for the past four years says there’s been a sea change within the party since Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s presidential nominee.\n\nJodi Clemens of West Branch spoke with Radio Iowa from the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\n“The enthusiasm and the energy that has been brought in the past couple of weeks has just been amazing,” Clemens said. “I think we kind of forgot what it was like to feel optimistic and it’s just been really great. Volunteers have been pouring in from back home and we’re just having a really great time.”\n\nClemens, who worked on Bernie Sanders’ 2020 Iowa caucus campaign, described Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as “an inspiring pick” for vice president.\n\n“Minnesota’s doing some amazing things up there, passing some of the legislation that we’d love to enable on a national level, you know, free school lunches for all kids,” Clemens said. “The things he’s been able to achieve, I think us Iowans are looking up there, we’re ready to take back our governorship and our Legislature and get some of our own progressive policies passed.”\n\nWalz was the closing speaker at the convention last night.\n\nDelegate C.J. Petersen of Templeton uses the word “outreach” to describe the message party activists are getting from the convention stage.\n\n“Make sure we’re uncovering every stone and we’re doing everything we can,” Petersen said. “We don’t want to wake up the day after the election and wonder what we could have done differently.”\n\nPetersen, who was born deaf, was a brief sign language interpreter on the floor of the convention Tuesday night. During the roll call of the states, Petersen signed what the state party chair said during Iowa’s half minute in the spotlight.\n\n(Additional reporting in Chicago by Ashley Byrd, Learfield)\n\nSac County’s jail in Sac City has been in operation for over 80 years, and the county’s voters will decide in November whether a new jail should be built.\n\nThe Sac County Board of Supervisors is proposing that a new county jail be built across the street from the current one, then the old one would be used by the county sheriff’s office.\n\nThe supervisors have voted to put a nearly $11 million bond referendum on the General Election ballot to finance the two-phase project. According to the state jail inspector, Sac County has the second-oldest jail in Iowa and it does not meet current safety standards, putting staff, inmates and the public at risk.\n\nIowa’s oldest county jail is in Pocahontas. Last November, Pocahontas County voters overwhelmingly approved $8.5 million in bonding for a new 18-bed jail.\n\n(Abby Ward, KCIM)\n\nOrganizers for the Farm Progress Show near Boone are preparing for around 150,000 people across the three-day event next week.\n\nDon Tourte is the senior vice president of sales and events for Farm Progress.\n\nHe says farmers looking for the latest in agriculture technology are the core audience.\n\n“There really is nothing like the Farm Progress Show when it comes to the world of agriculture. And I’m a little bit biased because obviously I’ve been doing this for a while. But everyone should come see this. Everyone should appreciate what’s going on. Everyone should appreciate what it takes to raise the food that we, the food and fiber that we have every day in America.”\n\nThe Farm Progress Show draws in more than 600 exhibitors showcasing everything from the latest combine design to apps that identify pests in the field.\n\nThe show will run from Aug. 27-29.\n\nThis is the 8th year in Boone. The location alternates with Decatur, Ill.\n\nInflation is making it harder for many families to afford everything on required back-to-school supply lists this year.\n\nIn Iowa, teachers may spend an average of $700 a year on supplies. That's more than Nebraska and South Dakota, but less than Missouri–where teacher spending can reach as high as $1,300.\n\nKristen Beinecke is a Missouri kindergarten teacher. She says her community bands together to help keep schools stocked. Still, needs arise.\n\n“I think when that happens the teachers do provide it. It's in our makeup. It's in who we are. I always say that being a teacher is a calling and not a career. It's a calling and not a job.”\n\nOver her 24 years in the classroom, Beinecke says she has spent thousands of dollars of her own money on supplies.\n\nThe National Education Association, a teachers union, says inflation has raised the prices of school essentials by more than 20% in recent years. Teachers and schools often depend on nonprofits and donations also to fill the gap.\n\nRead more from Holly Edgell.\n\nA courtroom heard emotional victim impact statements during the sentencing of an Algona man for the shooting death of an Algona police officer last year.\n\nA judge in Kossuth County this morning handed down a mandatory sentence of life behind bars without parole to 44-year-old Kyle Ricke. A jury in Dickinson County convicted him of first-degree murder last month.\n\nRicke said he was sorry for killing Algona Officer Kevin Cram.\n\n“Every night, I pray for forgiveness for the family. I'm very regretful for the pain and hurt that I caused them, and I pray that one day that they can forgive me for my horrible actions.”\n\nAfter Ricke told the court he was sorry for shooting Cram, Cram’s father responded.\n\n“You ambushed him like a coward. After he was on the ground, defenseless, you put three more bullets in his back. That is the very definition of a yellow, back-shooting coward, and that is you.”\n\nCram was shot eight times at close range after arriving to arrest Ricke on a warrant for misdemeanor harassment.\n\n“You not only destroyed a family and children's lives, but your own family and an entire community with your selfishness,” said Cram’s wife, Lara.\n\nThe packed Kossuth County courtroom also heard an emotional recording of one of Cram’s three sons crying because he misses his dad.\n\nIowans are being warned to be very careful when posting videos of themselves on social media.\n\nJim Temmer with the Better Business Bureau says criminals are using audio from online videos to fake people’s voices in scam calls.\n\n“If you put anything out there that has your voice in it — not very long, it’s something like eight or ten seconds — they can use software then to generate your voice saying anything.”\n\nTemmer says scammers are banking on people’s trust of them to trick people into other scams, like sending money transfers or giving up personal information.\n\n“A friend of yours, a relative, gets a call from you saying, ‘Hey, I’m in trouble. I need some help right now,’ and it not only sounds like you, but scammers also have the ability to spoof phone numbers.”\n\nThe best way to prevent this from happening is to only share your videos with your friends and family. Temmer warns to keep a close eye on friend requests to make sure they are not from phony accounts.\n\nA new state law to address chronic absenteeism requires notifying parents by certified letter if a student misses school for eight days in a semester. After additional absences, there must be an in-person meeting with a parent or guardian.\n\nThe most recent data shows absenteeism is remarkably widespread in Iowa schools.\n\n“The levels of chronic absence tend to be highest in the high school level and then middle school and then elementary,” says Anne Discher, executive director of Common Good Iowa, “But there’s no doubt that even at the elementary level we’re seeing high levels of chronic absence.”\n\nAdvocates of the new law say regular attendance at school is a habit that will carry over into adulthood and much of what happens in a classroom cannot be learned through make-up work. According to a national group called Attendance Works, one in four Iowa students were chronically absent during the 2021-22 school year. Discher says that means they missed 10% or more of school days, for any reason.\n\n“It could be sickness, it could be vacations, it could be any number of things,” Discher says, “But the idea is that when kids are absent for any reason, they’re not getting the instruction they need that day.”\n\nDischer is hoping more recent data could show improvement, but she said some students just haven’t reconnected with school after the pandemic.\n\n\"Certainly we would encourage districts to really start out with supportive techniques to really help reengage students in school,” Discher said.\n\nUnder Iowa law, if a student misses 20% of school days in a semester, a meeting of the student, a parent or guardian and the county attorney will be scheduled.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds is awarding $7.2 million to housing developers that have plans to build new homes and apartments in communities hit by severe storms and flooding this year.\n\nReynolds announced the program last month to supplement government assistance in areas covered by federal disaster declarations.\n\nThe funding announced Tuesday supports 175 new housing units in six communities.\n\nMuch of the money is going toward projects in flooded cities in northwest Iowa. In Spencer, which saw record flooding back in June, developers plan to use the money to build 27 single-family homes there, and another 24 multi-family units. In Rock Valley, four different projects will share in the state funding. Other projects were approved in Rock Rapids, Cherokee, Minden and Crescent.\n\nThe Iowa Economic Development Authority will continue taking applications until the program reaches its $10 million limit.\n\nA separate state program is available to help current homeowners in FEMA disaster areas pay for repairs.\n\nA judge has denied a request for a new trial from the man who was convicted last month in the September 2023 shooting death of Algona Police Officer Kevin Cram.\n\nAttorneys for 44-year-old Kyle Lou Ricke filed a motion on Aug. 5 requesting a new trial, following his conviction on a charge of first-degree murder back in July. In that motion, Attorney Barbara Westphal argued that the jury’s verdict of guilty was contrary to the evidence presented during trial, and insufficient to prove the premeditation required for a conviction on a charge of first-degree murder.\n\nFollowing a video conference on Monday, Judge Nancy Whittenburg denied the defendant’s request for a new trial on Tuesday.\n\nIn the ruling, Judge Whittenburg writes, “The Iowa Criminal Jury Instructions defining 'willful,' 'deliberate,' 'premeditate' and 'malice aforethought' do not require any particular length of time before the act.\n\nShe goes on to say the defendant's “actions of walking away from his conversation with Officer Cram, retrieving a firearm, and then returning to where Cram was standing to unload all or nearly all of his firearm’s magazine into Cram’s body is sufficient to suggest 'willful,' 'deliberate' and 'premeditated' conduct. These acts also suggest malice.”\n\nWith the motion for a new trial denied, Ricke’s sentencing will continue as scheduled Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThis September, residents in the Cedar Rapids Community School District will decide whether to continue its tax levy for school facility maintenance and equipment.\n\nCRCSD is the second-largest school district in the state and Superintendent Tawana Grover says for 50 years, the voter-approved Physical Plant and Equipment Levy, or PPEL, has been an important pot of money for the district.\n\n“Within the Cedar Rapids Community School District, we're taking care of 32 buildings. That’s huge, right? With the PPEL funding, we're able to take care of the upkeep of our facilities, to take care of some of the basic needs for our students.”\n\nLast year, voters said no to the district’s bond for new buildings. This special election does not include any of the projects from that plan. If renewed, PPEL would provide more than $10 million over ten years for facilities, equipment, security and other improvements.\n\nGrover says since the district has already been putting aside the money for 50 years, reupping this September wouldn’t impact tax rates.\n\n“I'm not asking the community for one more cent. We're just renewing things, taking care of business the way that they've been taking care of for the last 50 years. And we want to keep doing it for the next 50 years to come.”\n\nToday is the first day voters in the district can receive absentee ballots or vote early in person. The special election is Sept. 10.\n\nIowa delegates to the Democratic National Convention cast their votes in a ceremonial roll call Tuesday night.\n\nParty officials announced earlier this month that the Iowa delegation was unanimously supporting Harris as their party’s presidential nominee, but the chair of the Iowa Democratic Party’s Arab American Caucus instead voted present. All the other Iowa delegates supported the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nEach state chose an upbeat dance tune for their time in the spotlight. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart made the announcement as \"Celebration\" by Kool & the Gang played.\n\n“The Tall Corn State of Iowa, the state that launched Barack Obama on his way to the presidency, the state that put ‘Education’ on its state quarter and the state that feeds and fuels the world casts one vote present and 45 votes for the next president of the United States of America, Kamala Harris,” Hart said.\n\nObama won Iowa’s 2008 caucuses and carried the state in the 2008 and 2012 general elections. Donald Trump won Iowa in 2016 and 2020.\n\nPolls this year in Iowa have consistently shown Trump leading Joe Biden by a significant margin, but Brian Jackson, a delegate from Solon, said having Harris at the top of the ticket could make a big difference.\n\n“Maybe folks who were not 100% happy with some of Biden’s policies — he’s done a lot of great things, there are some things that people might disagree with — I think we’re going to see a lot of those people in the middle of the road, and even people on the Republican side, realize that what we’re trying to do is bring people together,\" Jackson said during an interview in the convention hall.\n\nThe co-founder of the company operating a baby formula factory in southern Iowa said there is an opportunity for significant growth in production capacity and the workforce at the plant in Allerton.\n\nRon Belldegrun is the CEO of ByHeart, which bought the DairiConcepts plant in Allerton after using the facility in 2019 during trials of its new recipe for baby formula.\n\n“After six years of development, we launched as the first new infant formula manufacturer in over 15 years,” Belldegrun said.\n\nBaby formula recalls and subsequent shortages in 2022 highlighted the fact that three companies controlled 90% of the market. ByHeart’s production of baby formula began in March of 2022. It bought the Allerton plant in 2023.\n\nByHeart uses whole milk from grass-fed cows and other ingredients in the powder that’s currently produced in Allerton, but canned and packaged at a facility in Oregon. Belldegrun said ByHeart invested “very heavily” in the Allerton plant to make it a “state of the art” baby formula factory. There are now 100 people employed at the facility.\n\n“We’ve increased the workforce by nearly 40%. Now that facility is one of the only facilities to come online to support this critically important domestic supply chain since the shortage.”\n\nByHeart, which also owns plants in Pennsylvania and Oregon, currently produces enough formula to feed half a million babies a year.\n\nBelldegrun said the company has a “big vision” for what’s next in Allerton. Engineers are drawing up plans to add packaging and canning to the Allerton plant, and Belldegrun said he’s had “productive discussions” with government officials, university researchers, farmers and other ingredient suppliers about creating what he describes as “an ecosystem” around the southern Iowa facility.\n\nProposed ordinances affecting the unhoused population in Des Moines were not on the agenda at Monday night’s city council meeting. But that didn’t stop several of those in attendance from speaking out against them.\n\nOne new ordinance would impose a $50 fine for sleeping in a public space. Another ordinance would be amended to shorten the amount of time someone has to remove their belongings from public property.\n\nLuiz Gomez said many unhoused people have mental health and substance abuse issues, while others living on the street are fleeing domestic violence.\n\n“Fining people $50 and taking them to jail, to put a simple misdemeanor in their record, will make it harder for them to obtain housing. So, do you really think that will help folks get out of the situation they’re facing?”\n\nMayor Connie Boesen has said the city is working with service providers, and Des Moines has done more than any other city in Iowa to provide affordable housing.\n\nThe Des Moines City Council has tentatively scheduled a third and final reading of the ordinances at a Sept. 16 meeting. After the second reading, only Ward 3 councilmember Josh Mandelbaum voted against the ordinances.\n\nA national organization has singled out a northwest Iowa city for its diversity. The Same House, based in Atlanta, is hosting an event on Wednesday called Tables Across America in Orange City. The goal is for people to bond over food, conversation and other activities.\n\nOrange City Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mike Hofman said Tables Across America usually happens in larger locations, but Orange City was chosen for the way it embraces new residents, including people from Ukraine, South America and China.\n\n“Sometimes rural, small America gets overpassed by some of these larger organizations because they just think there's nothing going on in these communities. And there certainly is.”\n\nHofman said the demographics of Orange City have grown more diverse because of new residents moving into town from other counties.\n\n“The only way that we're going to continue to grow is by having new demographics come to town. And it's a great way for us to get those folks integrated into the community — doing events like this and inviting them — and then also, trying to get them connected with local service organizations and ways that they can be involved in the community is always a good thing.”\n\nThe Same House visit also coincides with an end-of-year celebration for the Orange City Arts Council.\n\nThe State Auditor’s Office has examined operations in the town of Zearing after the city’s former clerk missed two deadlines and the city was unable to collect property taxes for a year.\n\nZearing City Clerk Karen Davis was fired in July of 2022 after she failed to file the city’s budget with the state. It was a $191,000 hit to the budget for the town of about 500 residents, because no property taxes could be collected\n\nResidents of Zearing asked the State Auditor’s Office to review how their town’s finances are handled. The general conclusion from the state auditor’s report is that the Zearing City Council needs “to exercise additional oversight of the city’s finances.”\n\nThe review found the city’s balance sheet was not kept up to date and one city employee was responsible for the city’s payroll, for handling cash and checks paid to the city and for paying all the city’s bills.\n\nThe auditor’s staff also reviewed when city funds were used to buy fuel and other items from a business owned by a member of the city council. The report concludes 72 charges were “not properly supported with an invoice.”\n\nOne of the Iowa delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago said her friends in other countries are paying close attention to the presidential race.\n\nState Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, joined the U.S. State Department in 1987 and had assignments in seven foreign countries before her retirement as a foreign service officer.\n\n“I can guarantee you that people around the world have their eyes trained on the United States, both for this convention and they will be throughout the entire election period. I have friends who’ve been talking about it for months.”\n\nWeiner said one reason she wanted to be a delegate at this week’s convention was because of President Biden’s foreign policy initiatives.\n\n“We need to thank him for the last four years, for standing up for democracy, for strengthening alliances, for strengthening NATO, for standing up for and helping Ukraine, for really making us a country and a government that our foreign partners can work with and trust.”\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said for the past two weeks she has been thinking about the speech Biden would give at the convention and how it would solidify his legacy.\n\nThe State of Iowa currently holds around $500 million in unclaimed funds and property.\n\nState Treasurer Roby Smith paid a visit to the Des Moines Community Playhouse Monday to return a small portion — $316.80 — that had landed in the state’s fund of unclaimed property.\n\nMoney often lands with the state from unclaimed bank accounts and insurance policies. For the Playhouse, it came from a school district that had sent a group to see a play but didn’t work out the payment process.\n\nSmith said one in ten Iowans are likely to have unclaimed money held by his office. Individuals should check online to see if they have money to claim — and so should businesses and nonprofits.\n\n“And we encourage people to do it once a year. We always have money coming in. Always getting it reported to us, and we just want to get the rightful owners back.”\n\nLast year, the Treasurer’s Office said it returned a record $34 million in cash and valuables. Smith is hoping to top that mark by the end of 2024.\n\nFormer Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack is reminiscing about his long-time connection to President Joe Biden at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\n\"I got started working in politics in 1986 working for then Sen. Biden, who was running for president. He said, ‘The penalty for not getting involved is that people less qualified than you end up governing you.' Oh my God, isn't that the truth?\" Vilsack said.\n\nVilsack, who served as Biden's U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, spoke Monday morning to the Minnesota delegates at the DNC. Biden is set to speak at the convention Monday night.\n\n\"He's a great man and he made an extraordinary decision, a decision, frankly, that the folks on the other side just could not comprehend that anybody would make, which is why they are in such chaos and so disorganized now. They just never, ever thought he would give up the most powerful position in the world for his country and his party. But that's the kind of guy he is,\" Vilsack said to applause.\n\nVilsack said he called the White House chief of staff the day after Biden's announcement to suggest Tim Walz would be a good running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"I said, 'Here's why: First of all, the guy's really good with a quip.' Oh, was he ever,\" Vilsack said, and the Minnesotans laughed. \"'But secondly, he has an incredibly progressive record and he's not defensive about.'\"\n\nVilsack served two terms as Iowa's governor and left office in early 2007, when Democrats controlled the Iowa House and Senate.\n\nAn Iowa State University football player will wear a different number on his jersey this season in a show of support for a former player who’s undergoing treatment for a brain tumor.\n\nState Sen. Jack Whitver, a former starting wide receiver for the Cyclones, announced his diagnosis this spring. ISU football coach Matt Campbell invited Whitver and his family to join the team on the field this weekend.\n\n“He’s going through a really hard battle right now,” Campbell said. “It’s going to take all of us to rally around him.”\n\nCampbell said the player who will wear number 26 this season had the same journey Whitver did at ISU.\n\n“Started off as a walk-on, now one of the great leaders in our football program — and that’s Caleb Bacon.”\n\nBacon, who is from Lake Mills, is a linebacker who played in all 13 ISU games last season and made 60 tackles — the second most on the team.\n\nWhitver was on the Cyclone football team from 1999 to 2003 and finished his college career with five touchdowns and 96 career receptions. Whitver is currently the Republican leader in the Iowa Senate.\n\nA controlled blast took place in Sioux City Monday to start the demolition of a railroad bridge destroyed by floodwaters. In late June, a bridge owned by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway partially collapsed into the Big Sioux River on the northwest side of Sioux City.\n\nCrews detonated 14 cutting charges on the South Dakota side of the river to break the 100-year-old bridge into three pieces Monday morning.\n\nAmy McBeth, director of public affairs for BNSF Railway, estimates once the bridge is removed, it will take nine months for a new, more modern bridge to take its place.\n\n“The community is still recovering from the impacts of that high historic water volume. So, the new pier will be deeper in footings to be able to withstand that moving forward.”\n\nAnother blast will happen in early September to remove the span on the Iowa side.\n\nWatch the video.\n\nHeat is the deadliest climate-driven disaster in the U.S. There have already been several reports of heat-related deaths this year in the Midwest and Great Plains. But experts say it’s likely that many more people die of heat than the numbers show.\n\nExtreme heat can cause all kinds of life-threatening health effects. Some are explicitly related to high temperatures, like heat stroke. But something like a heart attack spurred by heat can be harder to track.\n\nAlok Sengupta is an emergency medicine physician and Chief Medical Officer at Mercy Hospital in St. Louis.\n\n“If heat illness or heat exhaustion or heat stroke isn't listed as a cause, you're not going to know that that was a contributing factor. So, it's definitely underreported.”\n\nEven without a clear picture of the data, the National Weather Service says heat kills more people every year than hurricanes, tornadoes and floods.\n\nRead the full story from Harvest Public Media’s Kate Grumke.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds is proposing giving monthly boxes of food to low-income families next summer instead of accepting federal food assistance through Summer EBT. Her plan mentions the possibility of using existing summer meal sites for distributing food.\n\nStory County Medical Center Foundation Coordinator Liz Zuercher used a new state grant to start three summer meal sites in Maxwell and Collins this year. Hospital employees and volunteers prepare a few days’ worth of breakfast and lunch that families can pick up for free.\n\n“It’s worked out really well. It’s great to see all the kids. We started with seven kids and now we have 71 signed up. So yeah, it’s gotten more and more over the summer.”\n\nZuercher said she’s still looking into Reynolds’ plan, but thinks it will take a lot of work for the state to distribute monthly food boxes.\n\n“I guess it’s wait and see right now. If the waiver is approved by the USDA, then a more complete description of the state’s program will have to be done so we know what we’re getting into as communities and on the local level.”\n\nA USDA spokesperson said they will review Iowa’s proposal, but added that Reynolds is asserting that the state knows better than families do about their own needs.\n\nRepublican lawmakers on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee brought a hearing to the Iowa State Fair Friday to promote tax changes made during the Trump administration.\n\nMany parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire at the end of next year, including an increase in the child tax credit and several deductions for individuals and small businesses.\n\nLana Pol told lawmakers she used a deduction on business expenses to grow the fleet of her Pella-based trucking business. Now that the deduction is set to expire, she said she’s more cautious.\n\n“We have had to implement a freeze on purchasing any new equipment. This is due to the uncertainty of the tax provisions at the end of 2025 and because of the increased cost of equipment.”\n\nThe Trump-era tax law has been criticized for making many individual and small business provisions temporary, while a cut to the corporate income tax rate is permanent.\n\nIowans who suffered property damage and loss in the tornadoes that hit Minden in April and Greenfield in May have until Aug. 23 to register for disaster assistance from FEMA.\n\nJohn Mills, an external affairs officer at FEMA, was in both communities after the tornadoes hit. He said the deadline next week doesn’t mean assistance will not be available after the cut off.\n\n“It’s important to be registered with FEMA before the deadlines, so after the deadline, help is still available. You can stay in touch with FEMA, call us, update us about what your family’s needs are, about what your individual needs are related to the disaster.”\n\nMills said FEMA can provide money that doesn’t have to be repaid for things like home repairs not covered by insurance, temporary housing and replacing personal items.\n\nMore information about applying for assistance is available online. People can also go to one of the FEMA disaster recovery centers operating in Greenfield and other communities affected by severe weather.\n\nEmergency repairs are underway to stabilize a flood-damaged trail in the Sioux City metro. The Iowa Department of Transportation estimates the total cost to fix a mile along the Big Sioux River and Interstate 29 at around $8 million.\n\nDuring a news conference Friday, DOT engineer Jessica Felix said the work is challenging.\n\n“The slope is so unstable, and as the Big Sioux recedes, we have scour damages that we cannot always see with the naked eye.”\n\nFelix said with flooding throughout northwest Iowa, people need to stay out of construction zones and not go around barricades. Violators could face a $10,000 fine and jail time.\n\nEmergency repairs are expected to be completed this fall, and Felix said part of the trail could reopen for pedestrians sometime next year.\n\nThe World Health Organization is declaring an international health emergency over mpox, formerly known as monkeypox. Though no cases have been reported in Iowa, Iowans are warned to be aware.\n\nBrian Simmons, an infection preventionist with Gundersen Health System, explained how mpox is transmitted and what it does.\n\n“Mpox is a virus that is spread either through close contact with family members or through sexual contact. It is a virus that can cause sores that we see on different parts of the body. It’s very similar to what smallpox might have looked like years ago.”\n\nSymptoms of mpox include: fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a rash or blisters. It can be fatal, especially a strain that’s appearing primarily in African nations.\n\n“The newer strain of mpox is more virulent than what the previous strain was that we saw a few years ago, that we actually saw around here in the United States, even around locally. Currently, the newer strain is mostly around or within the sub-Saharan African nations, such as Congo and so on.”\n\nThe WHO has only declared public health emergencies seven times, including for mpox in 2022. Across the U.S., more than 1,600 mpox cases have been reported this year, which is twice the number of cases seen by this time last year.\n\nSimmons said this virus shouldn’t be a big worry for the majority of Iowans.\n\n“For those that could have a high risk for mpox, they may want to consider a vaccine. That still is a way to combat against mpox transmission.”\n\nState health officials said a limited amount of mpox vaccines are available to eligible individuals in 13 Iowa counties: Black Hawk, Cerro Gordo, Des Moines, Dubuque, Johnson, Linn, Polk, Pottawattamie, Scott, Story, Washington, Webster and Woodbury.\n\nProviding digital copies of books to patrons can be difficult, with varying agreements and vendor — and patron — expectations.\n\nAnne Mangano, collections services coordinator at the Iowa City Public Library, said the licensing agreements for libraries to provide e-books or audio books on the popular library app Libby are expensive.\n\n“You may be able to get that copy on Amazon or Apple books for $12, $20. We're paying $65, we're paying $85, for audiobooks that can be $125 per copy. And we get those copies, sometimes for one year, sometimes for two years, sometimes for 24 checkouts, and then we have to repurchase it.”\n\nAfter the copy is purchased, and although it’s a digital copy, it can only go to one person at a time, just like a physical book. On top of that, the library may have to pay multiple times for popular titles or after a certain amount of time or checkouts have passed.\n\n“The publishers have set the terms and they've been a little bit upfront about it, in that if it's inconvenient to use it at your public library, you will be more compelled to buy it for yourself,” Mangano said.\n\nRead more from Natalie Dunlap.\n\nFranklin County Republican Central Committee Chair Larry Sailer is strongly condemning the content of flyers placed on the doors of Hispanic businesses in Hampton earlier this week.\n\n“To me, it’s a bit of a hate crime, and I just strongly condemn it. As chair of the Franklin County Republican Party, there’s just no room for this. It’s just a way to try to divide people, and that’s really not what we do now in small town, Iowa. We work pretty well together.”\n\nThe flyers read in part, “USA Illegal Immigrant Hunting Permit – No Bag Limit – Tagging Not Required.” At the bottom of the flyer, it reads, “Trump 2024.”\n\n“People know what’s going on. This poster didn’t do either party —any party — any good. Just not how we operate. We want to operate on the issues, have a discussion, talk to everybody,” Sailer said.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds has rejected the Summer EBT program for this year and next year, which would’ve sent $29 million of grocery money to about 240,000 kids over the summer.\n\nShe’s asking the federal government to approve her plan to provide monthly food boxes to low-income families instead.\n\nReynolds says this would reach more kids, cost less than Summer EBT and promote nutrition to help fight childhood obesity. It’s not clear if the U.S. Department of Agriculture will approve the plan.\n\nIowa Hunger Coalition Chair Luke Elzinga says it’s not exactly what he hoped for, but he’s grateful the state is recognizing the rise in food insecurity.\n\n“We appreciate the state’s willingness to explore alternative options, but we also remain steadfast in our belief that using Summer EBT to provide grocery benefits directly to families is the best decision for Iowa.”\n\nElzinga says research shows that when parents have more money for food, they choose healthier options.\n\nRead more from IPR’s Katarina Sostaric.\n\nAugust is typically one of the hotter and drier growing months for corn and soybeans in northeast Iowa. So far, it’s been relatively mild.\n\nTwo weeks into the month, rainfall is about 3 inches below the total average for August, and temperatures have been below the roughly 80° average\n\nTerry Basol, a field agronomist with Iowa State Extension, said that’s great news for the region’s corn and soybeans because it helps keep them from maturing too quickly.\n\n“The higher the temperature you have, it increases the development of the crop because it just speeds things along. So, if we keep things at a lower temperature, like we are now, it’s perfect.”\n\nIf the weather stays this way, he said that could lead to a higher yield come harvest time.\n\n“What it does is it really helps lower that stress load on both the corn and the soybeans. Any time you have less stress on that crop, it allows them to basically reach their maximum potential for yield.”\n\nBasol added that the region’s subsoil moisture is 85% adequate thanks to a wet July.\n\nAfter a 12-day dig, the Office of the State Archaeologist unearthed the bones of a mastodon in Wayne County. A sample from the well-preserved skeleton dates it to about 13,600 years old, which is on the edge of when Native Americans would have come into south-central Iowa.\n\nWhile the contours of the skull may be eye-catching, State Archeologist John Doershuk said he was particularly excited about a 2-foot section of tusk recovered from the site. He called it a “goldmine” for answering all kinds of questions about the animal.\n\n“Apparently there are techniques now to determine how many calves a female mastodon had that get recorded as a chemical signature because of the changes in the body chemistry during the pregnancy and the birth. And that gets recorded in the tusks.”\n\nThe team didn’t find any stone tools near the bones. Doershuk said he is interested in whether analysis will reveal cut marks consistent with early human involvement.\n\n“The last glaciation probably still had the northern part of Iowa under ice. But the southern part was ice-free at the time and was starting to vegetate. Animals like mastodons were coming in to browse and human hunters would have also found that a hospitable place, as well.”\n\nTemporary housing for flood victims is now available on the Clay County fairgrounds in Spencer.\n\nKevin Robinson, deputy city manager in Spencer, said RVs have been set up in the camping area of the fairgrounds.\n\n\"There's one complete row of trailers in there right now — RV trailers — and then once all of those fill up, there's room to put another row to the east of that.\"\n\nIn mid-July, federal officials approved Iowa's request for FEMA's Temporary Housing Program, which can provide assistance to residents in counties that have been declared presidential disaster areas.\n\nSome of those property owners may be waiting to see if their home will be part of a buyout program. FEMA provides 75% of the money to buy homes and businesses in floodplain areas, and the state and city must provide the rest.\n\n\"The city will go through a process of determining which areas make sense to acquire, from a maintenance standpoint, from an adjacency standpoint to the river — there's lots of different variables.\"\n\nThe program has been used in several other Iowa cities in the past 30 years.\n\nOfficials in Cedar Rapids approved the first batch of 28 property buyouts 18 months after flooding in 2008 wrecked many areas of Cedar Rapids. Ultimately 1,400 properties were voluntarily sold, cleared and could not be redeveloped.\n\nNew data shows less than half of Iowa seniors 65 and older who are eligible for several public benefit programs are participating in them.\n\nThe National Council on Aging and the Urban Institute found 34% of eligible Iowa seniors are enrolled in the Medicare Savings Program, and 27% are enrolled in Supplemental Security Income. Just 17% are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nJen Teague, director of health coverage and benefits with the National Council on Aging, said there are many reasons for this, including that many seniors may not know about the programs or how to sign up.\n\n“The other piece is that we often find people saying, ‘I don’t want to take a benefit from somebody else.’ And what we really want to encourage, what we want people to hear, is that these benefits are available for anyone who’s eligible — and it’s not taking it away from someone else.”\n\nThe data show Iowa fares worse than the national average for eligible senior enrollment in all three programs.\n\nOfficials in Okoboji have made temporary changes to a key ordinance to assist property owners dealing with significant erosion along the shore of West Okoboji Lake.\n\nCity Administrator Michael Meyers said it usually takes at least a month to get a lakeshore landscaping permit, but requirements for a public meeting and other administrative steps are being waived.\n\n“In the City of Okoboji, we had between ten and 15 just catastrophic lakeshore collapses. Recognizing the emergent situation that we were in, the city made a decision that having a month-long process was just too long.”\n\nProperty owners will still be required to get an engineer’s evaluation of the project and follow other zoning rules.\n\n“Those are all still intact. So, it’s not necessarily a blank slate for folks to do whatever they want, but it is an opportunity to make things go a heck of a lot quicker. Because for some of these landowners, time is not necessarily in their favor.”\n\nLake-adjacent properties in the City of Okoboji are in a zone where landowners are required to follow specific landscaping methods allowed in the ordinance.\n\n“The intent of the City of Okoboji’s lakeshore landscaping ordinance is really to make shorelines appear as before any of us were here. We’re really promoting native shoreline restorations, deep-rooted plants and just making sure that these lakeshores are really set up for success in the long term.”\n\nSome of the shoreline of both West Okoboji Lake and East Okoboji Lake are within the city limits, but Meyers said the majority of intense flood damage in Okoboji city limits has been along the West Okoboji Lake shoreline.\n\nAt the end of September, the University of Iowa’s sexual assault support service will close. By then, the Iowa City-based Domestic Violence Intervention Program (DVIP) said its new sexual assault support division serving the same eight-county area will be fully operational.\n\nFinding a new provider, securing necessary funding and hiring new staff have made for a long few months for the University of Iowa. Earlier this year, the university announced it would no longer offer support services and would “transition” those services to a community-based program.\n\nSarah Hansen, UI’s vice president of student life, said the university plans to directly fund the DVIP at a similar level to what it gave to the original provider — the Rape Victim Advocacy Program (RVAP).\n\n“We're funding two campus advocate positions. We've also, on campus, added a prevention position to the sexual assault prevention team. So, there's three positions there.”\n\nHansen said money donated to the original provider will be diverted directly to DVIP for sexual assault support services.\n\nRVAP’s final day of operation is Sept. 30.\n\nHampton police are investigating anti-immigrant signs posted on the doors of Latino-owned businesses early Tuesday morning in the north-central Iowa town.\n\nA photo shared on Facebook by the Hampton Chronicle shows a black-and-white sign that reads, “USA Illegal Immigrant Hunting Permit,” and below the permit image, the sign says, “Trump 2024.”\n\nJanette Acolt is development coordinator for La Luz Centro Cultural, a nonprofit in Hampton that serves the Latino community. She said one of the signs was posted to the nonprofit’s door, and then she found other businesses that were targeted with the same sign.\n\n“We’re very scared, just knowing how some people can get very riled up. We were scared that someone could come in. I mean, we have a lot of children’s programs here, so our program coordinator was also very scared.”\n\nAcolt said this was a hate crime and she wants justice. She said Latinos are important to Hampton and they’re not going anywhere.\n\nFranklin County Attorney Andrea Miller — who would determine any criminal charges — had no comment Wednesday morning. She said she is still waiting for the results of the police investigation.\n\nRead more.\n\nResidents of Linn County will begin receiving semi-annual property tax statements this week.\n\nLinn County Assessor Jerry Witt wants property owners to know about a couple of tax credits.\n\nPeople who were 65 or older at the first of the year qualify for a new homestead credit. A military exemption has also increased from just over $1,800 to $4,000.\n\nWitt said property owners have to apply for the credits, which will come in handy as home values continue to rise.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of the numbers throughout the state, and I know for us, we’re looking at about a 7% or 8% increase in overall valuation, at least residential.”\n\nApplications for tax credits and exemptions for future tax cycles are available on the Iowa Department of Revenue website.\n\nA Democratic candidate for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District said she would like to see a reversal of the state’s six-week abortion ban.\n\nSpeaking at The Des Moines Register’s Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Tuesday, Sarah Corkery said she would work to overturn Iowa’s law that bans abortions when cardiac activity is detected.\n\n“We need to codify Roe v. Wade, first of all, and I truly believe all medical decisions should be between a person and a doctor — with no government involvement at all. So, we’ve got a long way to go from a six-week ban to making sure it’s just a protected health situation.”\n\nCorkery is a Cedar Falls native whose platform also includes increased funding for public schools and an expansion of alternative medicine, including legal marijuana.\n\nShe is challenging incumbent Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson in the district.\n\nThe Libertarian running for Congress in Iowa’s 3rd District said he plans to keep campaigning even if a state panel decides he is not eligible to stay on the ballot.\n\nMarco Battaglia is in a three-person race for the 3rd Congressional District seat currently held by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn.\n\nLast week, a pair of voters who are active Republicans filed a complaint to remove Battaglia from the ballot. They claim the Libertarian Party failed to hold required county conventions.\n\nBattaglia said the party instead held a state convention where county delegates broke off into separate meetings.\n\n“I don’t know what the mix-up is to be honest. I just know that I’m going to keep campaigning. I’m going to go to my town halls in every county in the district, regardless. If they take my name off the ballot, I’m going to say, ‘Write in Marco Battaglia.’ I’ll keep the promises I made to the people when I said I would go up there and represent them.”\n\nBattaglia spoke to reporters at the Iowa State Fair after appearing at The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox.\n\nSimilar complaints were filed against Libertarians running for Congress in the 1st and 4th Districts.\n\nThe State Objection Panel, which includes the Iowa secretary of state, state auditor and attorney general, is planning to hold a hearing on the issue later this month.\n\nRead more.\n\nLibertarian Nicholas Gluba said his priorities, if elected to represent Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, would include rebalancing the branches of government and banning eminent domain for private gain.\n\nAt The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair, Gluba said the president and executive branch shouldn’t have the authority to write their own laws without action by the legislative branch.\n\n“That effectively makes the president in the United States a king. We fought against the king back in 1776. We won. We need to do it again. We need to win that war again and make sure a king can’t control the United States of America ever again.”\n\nGluba said he would also sign onto a bill to ban the use of eminent domain for projects that benefit corporations.\n\nHe also criticized challenges that were filed to keep him and two other Libertarian congressional candidates off the ballot. Gluba said Libertarians will defeat those challenges and appear on the ballot in November.\n\nRead more.\n\nDemocrat Lanon Baccam believes his background serving in the military and at the U.S. Department of Agriculture will attract rural, independent voters in Iowa’s closely contested 3rd Congressional District.\n\nBaccam served for eight years in the Iowa Army National Guard. At The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Monday, he explained it was hard to convince his parents to let him enlist. They resettled in Iowa in the 1980s as refugees from war-torn Vietnam.\n\n“To eventually come to this country, and for their son to serve in the military, they were terrified for what that would mean if we ever went to war. But I knew it was my time to go, and I did.”\n\nBaccam deployed to Afghanistan in 2004 with a combat engineering unit. He is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Zach Nunn, who is a veteran of the Air Force and Iowa National Guard. Nunn spoke at the fair on Friday.\n\nThe 3rd District includes the Des Moines area, as well as much of south central and southwestern Iowa.\n\nRepresentatives from the Iowa Hunger Coalition met with state officials to convince Gov. Kim Reynolds to participate in the Summer EBT program next year.\n\nThe program provides an extra $120 in summertime federal food assistance for each child who qualified for free or reduced-price lunch at school. Reynolds cited administrative costs when she turned down the federal funds for this summer’s program.\n\nLuke Elzinga, a spokesman for the coalition, said the USDA announced it will provide grants to states to cover technology expenses associated with the benefits.\n\n“There’s also a free online application that’s been developed that USDA is allowing states to use, so some of those administrative expenses might be addressed. And, again, almost a quarter of a million kids throughout the state of Iowa could benefit from this.”\n\nElzinga works for the Des Moines Area Religious Council food pantries, which saw record use in July. He said food pantries in the state are overwhelmed.\n\n“We absolutely think Summer EBT would help relieve some of the strain, not just on families across Iowa, but on food banks, food pantries and other service providers,” Elzinga said. “This is the case in urban areas, small towns, the suburbs. People are really struggling right now.”\n\nThe Iowa Hunger Coalition delivered a petition to the governor’s office this week that was signed by over 3,500 Iowans urging Reynolds to accept the extra federal funding next summer.\n\nThe number of exhibitors in dairy cattle shows at this year’s Iowa State Fair is nearly identical to last year, despite new bird flu testing requirements for milking cows entered in the contests.\n\n“There was definitely an increased number of heifers. At some of the farms, their heifers happened to be on a different location and didn’t have to be tested if they didn’t have cows in that location,” Mike Eilers, the superintendent for dairy cattle at the Iowa State Fair, said. “But there still was roughly 120 to 130 cows here at the show, which is pretty good given all they had to go through with the testing and stuff.”\n\nEilers grew up on a dairy farm and showed Guernsey cattle, but has what he describes as an office job now. For the past decade, he’s been managing the State Fair dairy shows to stay connected to the industry and make sure kids, in particular, have a place to showcase their work.\n\n“Just to be able to come here and compete, to see the quality of the animals they have and compare it to everybody else in the state and the other animals — and just to meet and hang out,” Eilers said. “There’s a lot of families and kids from all over the state that get to become friends just because they come to the fair.”\n\nMike and Rhonda Guy of Newton were in the State Fair Livestock Pavilion this weekend watching their granddaughter show her Brown Swiss heifer in the youth dairy show.\n\n“The value of this is tremendous. It teaches them a work ethic,” Mike Guy said. “It’s nice to see them do things that we did, as well — carry on a tradition, to some extent.”\n\nGuy and his brother shut down their milking operation about 20 years after deciding they either had to expand or get out of the dairy business. According to the latest data from the USDA, there were about a thousand dairy farms in Iowa in 2022.\n\nThe Libertarian candidate running in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District said he disagrees with Iowa’s six-week abortion ban.\n\nCharles Aldrich said even though he does agree with the Supreme Court’s decision to give states the power to enact abortion laws, it comes down to upholding personal rights.\n\n“The government is interfering with a person and their caregiver. They shouldn't be doing that. It's out of the purview of the state.”\n\nAldrich, an engineer from Clarion, made his comment to reporters after appearing at The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair on Sunday.\n\nAldrich is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra and Democrat Ryan Melton in the 4th Congressional District, which covers the western border of Iowa and the cities of Ames, Fort Dodge and Marshalltown.\n\nA complaint was filed to keep Libertarian congressional candidates in Iowa off the November ballot. The issue is expected to be resolved during a hearing with state officials. Aldrich said he isn’t concerned about the challenge.\n\nThe Democrat running for Congress in Iowa’s 4th District said incumbent Rep. Randy Feenstra is vilifying immigrants.\n\nFeenstra, the two-term Republican, has said that securing the southern border is the number one concern of people living in the district, which covers Iowa's western border and includes Ames, Fort Dodge and Marshalltown.\n\nRyan Melton, who took part in The Des Moines Register’s Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Sunday, said immigrants are being used as scapegoats when there is no proof that they commit more crimes than native-born citizens.\n\n“We should want people that are willing to put their lives on the line to give their kids a better life. So, this narrative about immigrants and invasion and threat is wrong. It's shameful, and eventually, it's going to lead to people getting hurt.”\n\nFeenstra introduced the Build the Wall and Fight Fentanyl Act in Congress last year. Melton said the vast majority of fentanyl that comes into the country arrives through legal ports of entry by U.S. citizens and that building a wall is a “kindergarten solution” for a complicated issue.\n\nThe Libertarian candidate for president, Chase Oliver, said one of the main reasons purchases ranging from groceries to homes continue to get more expensive is deficit spending by the federal government. Oliver made his comments Saturday at The Des Moines Register’s Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair.\n\n“It’s because the government is making our dollar worth less and less and less each year, because they run deficit spending to the tune of trillions of dollars. And they have to print money to make up for that. What that does is it devalues the dollars in your pocket.”\n\nChase told a small crowd gathered for his speech that the rising prices amount to a “hidden tax” on Americans. He pledged to veto any unbalanced budget Congress might send him. The U.S. hasn’t had a balanced federal budget since the Clinton administration.\n\nOliver is on the ballot in about three dozen states. The latest NPR/PBS/Marist poll shows him with less than 1% support among likely voters.\n\nRead more.\n\nDemocratic 1st Congressional District candidate Christina Bohannan criticized her opponent’s record on abortion and immigration at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday.\n\nDuring a speech at The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox, Bohannan said Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks refused to support a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year.\n\nBohannan said unlike Miller-Meeks, she would vote to put abortion rights protections under Roe v. Wade into federal law.\n\n“She has sold out Iowa women. As we stand here today, Iowa now has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. And there’s a lot of blame to go around, plenty of it on this ban, but in "
