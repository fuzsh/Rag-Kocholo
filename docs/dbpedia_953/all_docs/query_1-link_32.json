Sampsel at his late home in Bellville, O., on the morning of Feb. 21st., we recognize the hand of God. The entrance and exit of our earthly life is from Him who holds our destiny. The subject of this brief sketch was born April 9, 1825, in Columbiana County, Ohio. In his boyhood he showed a marked tendency for the medical profession, as a large family connection of the same name in Ashland, Delaware, and elsewhere have done. In 1845 he married Miss E. Whiteleather, who died in 1863, leaving six children. Three of them have passed over the river, Mrs. Irene Campbell of Caledonia, O., only three weeks before her father. The others, H.W. of Bellville, Mrs. W.W. Burt of Caledonia, and Miss Verda of Kankakee, Ill., were at the funeral. He married Miss Elizabeth Miller on March 16, 1865. Three sons, Gail, Ward and Jesse and one daughter, Della, all living, were the result of this union. The eldest recently of Adelbert College, Cleveland, having the medical profession in view. For more than forty years Dr. Sampsel has had an extended practice in Marion, Morrow and Richland counties, the last 17 years in Bellville. While the autopsy showed the stomach to be the only sound vital organ, death must have been almost instantaneous from rupture of the heart. The funeral services at his late residence, corner of Markey and Ogle streets, though at the early hour of 9:30 a.m., Feb. 24th. was attended by a very large concourse of people. After these impressive services by Revs. John Kelly and A. Philpot many went with the relatives to Lexington, the place of burial. Although past what might be termed the summit of life, being called away at the age of 63 years, 9 months and 12 days, yet he was full of hope. [Bellville Star: 21 March 1889]\n\nSampsell, Dr. I.S. -- Dr. I.S. Sampsell died at his home in Bellville last night of heart disease at the age of 62 years. The deceased has been ailing for some time with lung trouble, but was able to be about a portion of the time. No arrangements have as yet been made for the funeral. Dr. Sampsell was one of the best known physicians throughout the county and leaves a wife, four sons and two daughters to mourn his loss. -- [Richland Shield & Banner: 23 February 1889, Vol. LXXI, No. 40]\n\nSampsell, Dr. I.S. -- Bellville. The saying that death loves a shining mark was verified when on Thursday morning it claimed as its victim Dr. I.S. Sampsell one of our highly respected citizens. The doctor had been ailing for a week past but considered his ailment a lung trouble which seemed to be yielding to treatment. On Wednesday he seemed much better. On Thursday he arose about 7 o'clock and having dressed was setting by the fire when he called out that he had a dreadful pain in his side. A messenger was dispatched for Dr. Austin, who lives in an adjoining property, but before he could arrive, Dr. Sampsell was dead. When the report of his death was circulated it was hard to make people believe it. The family have the sympathy of the entire community. The funeral took place from his late residence at the corner of Markey and Ogle Streets at 9:30 a.m., on Sunday. Interment at the Lexington Cemetery. The services were conducted by Revs. Kelly and Philpot. An autopsy established the fact that he had died of heart disease. -- [Richland Shield & Banner: 02 March 1889, Vol. LXXI, No. 41]\n\nSampsell, Dr. I.S. -- Bellville. Dr. I.S. Sampsell died very suddenly on Thursday morning at his home on Markey Street.

Thursday morning he was stricken with a severe pain in the stomach and immediately sent for Dr. Austin, but lived only a few minutes. The funeral took place on Sunday at 9:30 a.m., Rev. John Kelly officiating. The remains were taken to Lexington for interment. Among the relatives from a distance who attended the funeral were Dr. W.R. Hoops, of New Haven, Ind., Dr. Sampsell and Mrs. L. Campbell, of Ashland, Mrs. W.W. Burt, of Caledonia.

Thousands of pedestrians crossing Superior viaduct saw the accident, which brought to five the toll of deaths as result of accidents on the new high level bridge. The dead men are Virgil Sams, 24, 1545 E. 17th. St., and William Brown, 27, 2801 Church Ave. N.W. Both were workers on reinforced concrete construction. According to the police and witnesses the men were working on false work of piers 7 and 8, which span Merwin Ave. and the Baltimore & Ohio railroad tracks. Without warning a panel collapsed, striking Brown and causing him to stagger backward. Seeing his fellow workman about to fall from the bridge, Sams grabbed Brown by the arm. Brown staggered off the bridge and carried Sams along with him. Other workmen employed by the Hunkin-Conkey Co., builders of the bridge, found the mangled forms lying on a pile of timbers just a few feet east of Merwin Ave. Weber & Hoesch's ambulance took the men to Lutheran Hospital where physicians could find no signs of life. The bodies later were removed to Weber & Hoesch's undertaking rooms, 4160 Lorain Ave. The death of her husband leaves Mrs. Sams in need of assistance. Within a few days she will receive a visit from the stork. She already has a 2-year old daughter. Brown came to Cleveland last Saturday from his home, 3411 Crystal St., Mt.

Mansfield [Ashland (OH) Times Gazette: 14 Jan. 1969, p. 2]\n\nSargeant, George H. \n\nSargent, George H. -- We are called upon to chronicle this week the sad and early death of Geo. H. Sargent, son of Mrs. Nancy Sargent of this place of the firm of Madden & Sargent, at Urbana, o., on the evening of the 12th. inst. The circumstances attending it are briefly as follows: For the past year his health seemed worse than usual, although always poor; and more than all else, it is supposed that the severe sun-stroke that he received in the army affected his brain, and caused his thoughts to turn into despondent and melancholy channels. At any rate this has been his condition for several months past but there was nothing to lead his nearest friends to suppose that his mind was \"turned\" until the past week, and nothing definite until last Saturday. Upon that day he seemed quite beside himself all day, and among other things imagined his best friends to be his worst enemies. He was consequently very difficult to manage. From that time arrangements were being quietly made to have him removed Monday or Tuesday to a proper place for treatment; but Sunday evening, to the great surprise of all his circle of friends, he died by his own hand. O that day at 11 o'clock, he upon coming out of the book store, met a hardware clerk, of whom he at once purchased the revolver to commit the fatal deed. At 2 o'clock P.M., he called upon the young lady to whom he was to have been married in January, where he remained all the time in more or less agitation until about 6 o'clock P.M. At that time the father of the young lady began pleading with Barry \"to unbosom himself to him, and tell him what was the matter.\" Harry consented to do so if he would step outside. After a great deal of coaxing Harry handed the old gentleman a note already prepared and addressed to him, and requested him \"to read that\". He returned to the house to read the note, and Harry passed on down the street, and it is supposed went at once to the store and shot himself. The note he undoubtedly intended should explain all, but it was found to be merely the creation of a disordered mind. Steps were at once taken to find Harry, but without success until the next morning, when the clerk who was opening out the store, discovered him in a room over the store, lying on the floor cold and dead, fully dressed with the weapon that done the deed on the floor at his feet. His troubles, whatever they were, were purely imaginary, as everything excepting his poor diseased brain, was in the very nicest and most desirable condition; abundance of warm friends and no enemies, a betrothed that almost worshipped him, and a good paying business that was increasing his worldly goods quite rapidly. But all these blessings were as naught to him. An inquest was held at once, and the Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of death from a pistol shot by his own hand in a fit of temporary insanity. Thus has passed from a large circle of loving relatives and friends, a young man of sterling integrity, best habits and purest principles. [The facts, as above stated, are from Col. C.J. Madden, Mr. Sargent's business partner. -- Ed., Bellville Weekly] [Richland Shield & Banner: 25 December 1875]\n\nSargent, Hulbert L. -- Once again the people of Bellville have been called upon to pay their last respects to one whose entire life was associated with this place. Hulbert L. Sargent died June 28, the funeral taking place from the home of his sister, Mrs. S.A. Brollier on last Sabbath at 2 o'clock. The high regard in which the deceased and also the family is held with manifested at the time of the funeral by the very large audience that was in attendance. Many of those present having known the deceased during his entire life, they having played together in childhood and since that time have been as intimately associated as their different business vocations would permit. He was a man of good business abilities, and met with good success in all his business enterprises. He was a liberal and kind brother, and was always ready to assist when help was needed. He was a man who never made any unnecessary display but quietly and in a strait forward business way attended to all his affairs so as to demand the respect of all. when taken sick he was engaged in a mining enterprise in Colorado. He left his home in the early spring and went to the mine expecting to remain some time, but was soon smitten down by sickness from which he found no relief until death released him, the malady being a tumor formation with a slight softening of the brain around the tumor. His sufferings were intense during all his sickness. After reaching his home every care and attention was given to relieve his suffering but all efforts were of no avail and last Thursday morning as the day quietly was relieving the night watch, just so quietly our brother, friend and neighbor passed away. Thus ended another active business life. -- [Bellville Star: 05 July 1888, Vol. 11, No. 41]\n\nSarka, Charles -- 69Y; d. 12/3/1955 at Mansfield [MNJ 12/3/1955]\n\nSauder, Mrs. A.J. -- Mrs. A.J.

[Mansfield News: 14 November 1901]\n\nSchantz, Chrissie -- Councilman Joseph Schantz and son, George, arrived in the city at one o'clock this morning with the remains of their daughter and sister who died in Detroit yesterday at the Grace Hospital. Miss Chrissie Schantz, the deceased, was 28 years of age and was well known to all our people as a very sociable and vivacious young lady. Just four weeks ago today she started for Detroit and the lakes on a pleasure trip with ten other companions. The trip was a very unfortunate one for all, as they all became more or less sick and returned home separately. About ten days ago Miss Schantz was attacked with a severe headache which terminated in malarial fever. As her condition became worse she was taken to the Grace Hospital, where she received every possible attention from the attendants and her sister, Miss Lena, who watched by her bedside during her sickness. When the remains were returned to this city this morning the family were prostrated with grief, as was natural. The funeral will be held tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock at the Catholic church, Rev. Father Magenhann officiating, after which the remains will be interred in the Catholic Cemetery. The stricken family have the sympathy of all their friends and acquaintances in their sad bereavement. -- [Richland Shield & Banner: 15 August 1891, Vol. LXXIV, No. 13]\n\nSchantz, John James\n\nSchantz, Philip J. -- Wednesday.

Ed. Massa, Will Berno, Jerry Hagerty, Geo. A. Rhein, A.W. Smith and Jas. Birch, of this city, assisted by two members of the Cleveland Typographical Union, officiated as pallbearers. A large concourse followed the remains to their last resting place in the Catholic cemetery. [Richland Shield & Banner: 27 August 1892]\n\nSchantz, Philip J. -- A telegram was received in this Monday morning, from Miss Lena Schantz, stating that her brother, Philip J. Schantz, son of ex-Councilman Jos. Schantz, of East Third Street, died at Cleveland at an early hour this morning. The news will shock the many friends of the deceased, who was well known in this city. Mr. Schantz's sickness and death is an exemplification of faithful servitude, which should be and, no doubt, is appreciated by his employers. He was employed as an opertor on one of the type setting machines on the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and a short time ago it was seen that the amount of work to be done by each machine was more than one operator could do. The operators made an effort to secure substitutes, but Mr. Schantz was unable to do so. He was an expert operator, being able to set 25,000 ems per night, the work of three ordinary hand compositors, and worked almost night and day for 22 days in order to keep his machine going, the result being that about ten days ago he fainted while at work and had to be taken to his room, No. 60 Wood Street, where he became very sick, being attacked with intermittent or typhoid fever, which resulted in death as stated above. His mother and sister Lena and brother George were present at the time of his death. Mr. Schantz was born in this city about 25 years ago. He was an exemplary young man and had a host of warm friends here who will learn of his demise with much regret. In 1883 the deceased entered the SHIELD office as an apprentice. He was bright, attentive and industrious and rapidly became an excellent hand compositor. In March, 1888, after five years of faithful service, he decided to go to a larger field and secured cases on the Cleveland Plain Dealer. There he soon became a favorite on account of his genial manner and his ability as a printer. When the Plain Dealer put in the Mergenthaler type setting machines, about one year ago, they showed their appreciation of Phil by giving him a machine to operate. As in the days of his service in this office by his close application and natural ability he soon mastered the intricacies of the new machine and became one of their fastest operators. Less than a month ago he was home visiting his parents and called at the SHIELD office to \"shake hands with the boys\" as was his wont when in the city. In his work he was careful, accommodating and accurate and always enjoyed the highest regard of his employers. Mr. Schantz's death is a particularly sad blow to his parents from the fact that a year ago last Tuesday their daughter, Miss Crissie, died at Detroit, while taking a vacation. At that time Miss Lena was also taking a vacation and attended her sister during his sickness. A week ago she went to Cleveland to spend a short vacation with her brothers, Phil and Joe, but again found a member of the family near death's door and nursed her brother until death overtook him. His parents, Mr. & Mrs. Jos. Schantz, and his brothers and sisters have the sympathy of the entire community in their great bereavement. The remains will be brought to this city this evening.

Mr. Schwier had not been himself for some time and his friends remarked that there was something wrong with him. This morning about 11 o'clock he went into the bar of the Brunswick hotel and had been there but a few minutes when he fell to the floor. Chief Well and Officer Charles picked him up and carried him to the store, two doors distant. He was in an unconscious condition when he was placed on the bench in the tailor shop. It was noticed that the action of the heart was becoming fainter each moment so his brother and other friends present became alarmed and telephoned for a physician. Six different physicians were telephoned for, but none could be located. Finally, somebody thought of Dr. Shipley, whose office is almost across the street. When Dr. Shipley reached the man he pronounced him dead. This was only about half an hour after he was stricken down. Coroner Bushnell arrived shortly afterward.
