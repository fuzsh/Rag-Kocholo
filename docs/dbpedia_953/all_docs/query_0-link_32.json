        "text": "The recipients of this scholarship will be a full-time, undergraduate student properly enrolled at Missouri State University pursuing a degree in the College of Business. The degree the student is obtaining must be fully accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). It is the intention of the donor that the students receiving the scholarship be a graduate from a high school or resided in either Douglas County, Missouri or Callaway County, Missouri and maintain a cumulative 3.0 GPA. It is also the preference of the donor that the students have financial need.\n\nIt is the donorsâ€™ intent that the scholarships pay for the tuition, books and fees of a student attending Missouri State University. If the student receives another University sponsored program to cover these costs (i.e. a graduate assistantship, or similar programs), then the student will be precluded from continuing to receive the scholarship.\n\nThis scholarship may be automatically renewed for 3 additional academic years for undergraduate recipient(s) pursuing a general business degree and 1 additional academic year for recipient(s) pursuing their Master of Accountancy - Accelerated, so long as funds allow and the recipient(s) maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0."
