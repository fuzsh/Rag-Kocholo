        "text": "Title: The Love Hypothesis\n\nAuthor: Ali Hazelwood\n\nDate Reviewed on GoodReads: 10/03/2021\n\n**Spoiler Alert** I enjoyed most of this book, except for one or two issues which I will get to. Olive is a Ph.D. student in biology. She’s perky, smart, and struggling in grad school, but she will no doubt survive the experience. Her best friend is Anh. After dumping her boyfriend, Jeremy, Olive finds out that Anh really wants to date him but she won’t because she thinks it will upset Olive. Olive really doesn’t care if Anh dates Jeremy or not, but she can’t convince Anh of that – so she starts what turns into an elaborate fake-dating plot. Olive kisses the dragon Professor Carlson and the two start to fake-date, meeting weekly for coffee and attending department functions together. Because Dr. Adam Carlson isn’t Olive’s advisor or on any of her committees, and she’s an adult grad student, there’s no university policy against Carlson and Olive dating.\n\nI really enjoyed the day-to-day depiction of Olive’s grad-school life. And there’s a lot of humor in this book. Also, it’s a romance, so Olive, despite her original intentions slowly discovers she’s really in love with Adam. It also turns out that Adam had basically had a crush on her since a chance encounter with her three years ago. And yes, that chance encounter meant a lot to Olive too – and it’s brilliantly written.\n\nI probably would have absolutely loved this book except for one thing. Olive wants to work on a project to develop early testing for Pancreatic Cancer (all well and good) and she receives a response from a famous scientist at Harvard offering to talk to her about a research scholarship at Harvard (also all well and good). The scientist, Tom Barton, comes to Stanford to talk to Olive and turns out to be a friend of Adam’s (so far not bad). But when Olive goes to an academic conference, where she’s invited to speak on a panel about her cancer research, Tom attacks her. His verbal abuse and attempted sexual assault I found to be triggering. It was deeply, deeply upsetting to me. The book went from a cute, funny, enjoyable modern romance, to a deep, realistic portrayal of the abuse women in STEM suffer on a daily basis. I didn’t find it amusing or enjoyable. It was appalling. And even though things somewhat work out, I still found the scene jarring.\n\nIn response to Tom’s appalling behavior, Olive was going to simply ignore the offer to work at Harvard, but her friends find the accidental phone recording of the assault and convince her to report Tom. Adam also finds out what happened – from Olive, and supports her. Tom doesn’t suffer much in the way of consequences. Olive could have actually reported him to the police for attempted sexual assault. And the response to her complaint, even with a recording of what happened, is still little more than a slap on the wrist.\n\nImmediately after the attempted assault, Adam finds Olive crying in the hotel room they share (in what was meant to be platonic room sharing). One thing leads to another and there is an entire chapter of the two having sex. It seemed incongruous to me that after a near-sexual assault the first thing on Olive’s mind would be to actually have sex with her fake boyfriend, even though she’s clearly fallen in love with him by this point. I couldn’t get into the chapter at all and just had to push through it.\n\nHowever, as they do in romances, things work out. Olive is ready to break up with Adam, but when she finally reveals the truth about Tom to Adam he stands by her and the two get together for real. Olive has her advisor write emails looking for a different research post for her, and Olive gets several offers so she’s able to find one near Stanford. And Adam decides to stay at Stanford and not take a job at Harvard. So overall, I liked this romance novel, which is why I gave it a 5-star rating. It’s very much science girls for the win which I liked very much."
