HENRY KIEL, NORTH NINTH STREET, HAD BEEN ILL FOR LONG TIME AND WAS DESPONDENT OVER CONDITION USE PULMOTOR IN EFFORT TO SAVE WOMAN, BUT TOO LATE Despondent over ill health from which she had suffered for months, Mrs. Henry Kiel, a resident of North Ninth street, is believed to have taken her own life yesterday, Mrs. Kiels dead body having been found in a cistern in the basement of the home late in the day. Efforts to resuscitate her proved unavailing, the woman having been dead some time when found. She was 50 years of age. Mrs. Kiel was last seen alive at 3 oclock when Miss Rose Benvinver, of Mischicott, who had been employed at the Kiel home, left the house for the afternoon. Returning at 5 oclock Miss Benvinver found Mrs. Kiel absent and hearing that she might have been stricken by illness, made a search of the house. Discovering the door leading to the cellar open, she hurriedly visited the basement and discovered the body. The cistern is brick walled and about five feet high and to reach the top Mrs. Kiel had overturned a wash tub and placed a pail on top of it and then climbed to the top by means of an iron rod which extends from the side. The womans slippers and her sweater had been removed and were found by the Benvinver girl on the floor near the tub and prompted the girl to look into the cistern to make the ghastly discover. Rushing from the cellar the girl summoned neighbors and Prof. C. J. Stangel, who resides in the neighborhood, assisted by others, drew the body from the cistern. There was about four feet of water in the cistern and the body was face downward, indicating that the woman had plunged into the opening head first. Physicians were summoned and every effort made to revive the woman but they were futile, it being said she had been dead for some time. It is believed that Mrs. Kiel, her mind temporarily unbalanced by brooding over her condition, had taken her life soon after the departure of Miss Benvinver from the house at 2 oclock. Her little son was playing in the neighborhood and returned home just after the body had been carried from the cellar to an upstairs room. Mr. Kiel, who was absent during the afternoon at work south of the city, had no intimation of the tragedy until he reached the house at 6 oclock, an hour after the body had been found. He had hesitated to leave home yesterday, owing to the illness of Mrs. Kiel but at noon when he had suggested that he would not go to work, his wife had urged him not to stay at home, declaring that she was feeling well and she appeared to be in better spirits than usual when he left the house. Mr. Kiel had a premonition that all was not well, however, and when he entered the home and found neighbors gathered in the house, he thought that Mrs. Kiel had suffered a collapse. When informed of her death and the tragic manner in which it occurred, he was prostrated. Mrs. Kiel was 50 years of age and had been previously married. She was the mother of one child, a boy of six, who with the husband, survive. Mrs. Kiel has five children by a former marriage, all surviving.

He died on Saturday, one day after his 93rd birthday. He had been affected by the ills of old age for a long time and had been bedridden recently, but we had hoped that he would get better. Moritz Kiel was born 18 June 1816 in Lippe- Detmold and came to America about 55 years ago. He worked for about a year at a sawmill in Neshoto but then bought 40 acres of land on Town Line Road in Town Manitowoc and settled there, and over the years turned it into one of the prettiest farms in Manitowoc County, and he himself became one of the best known and respected farmers of our county. For 20 years he was elected and reelected as Town Assessor, a position he administered with great wisdom. As age encroached he turned the farm over to his son Heinrich but kept it as his residence. He belonged to a family of 10 brothers and 2 sisters, all of whom had resided in our county and of whom he was the last. His wife preceded him in death many years ago and he has surviving him 2 sons and a daughter, the latter living in California. The funeral was held Tuesday afternoon. Der Nord Westen, 24 June 1909 ******* On last Saturday, Moritz Kiel, a pioneer settler of this county, aged 93 years, died at the home of his son Henry who resides on the old homestead on the town line road in the town of Manitowoc, after a long illness. The deceased was the last member of a family of seven brothers and three sisters. His wife died several years ago. He was born in German and immigrated to this country over 55 years ago. After a few years residence in this county he purchased 40 acres of land in the town of Manitowoc. At intervals he purchased adjoining tracts and the farm, which has been managed by his son Henry for some years, is one of the best in the county. Mr. Kiel was a man who was held in the highest esteem by all who knew him because of his pleasing personality, uprightness of character and strict integrity. For over a score of years he held the office of assessor of the town of Manitowoc and established a reputation for honesty and justice. He is survived by three children, Henry who resides on the old homestead, August of Branch, and Mrs. Louis Stadler of Los Angeles, Cal. The funeral was held Tuesday, Rev. Graether of the Reformed church officiating. Interment was at Evergreen cemetery. Manitowoc Pilot, June 24, 1909 ****** MORITZ KIEL, PIONEER DEAD One of the Oldest Residents of the County Answers Final Call WAS 93 AND CAME HERE 55 YEARS AGO Moritz Kiel, one of the oldest residents of the county died at his home on the Townline Road, Town of Manitowoc, Saturday, the day following his 93rd birthday. Mr. Kiel's death resulted from an illness of long standing and which had confined to his bed for weeks before the end came. Mr. Kiel is survived by three children, two sons, Henry, who resides on the old homestead, August of Branch and Mrs. Louis Stadler of Los Angeles, Cal. Mrs. Kiel has been dead several years. Mr. Kiel's death removes the last member of a family of ten, seven brothers and three sisters who came here in the 40's and made the county their home. Mr. Kiel was engaged in the sawmill business for three years after his arrival here and then acquired a tract of 40 acres of land in the Town of Manitowoc to which he has added with passing of years until at his death, the farm is one of the best in the county. A son, Henry, conducted the farm in late years, Mr. Kiel making his home thereon. Despite his age, Mr. Kiel gave his attention to management of his property and was one of the successful farmers of the county. A man of sterling worth and unimpeachable integrity, Mr. Kiel enjoyed the confidence and respect of his neighbors and the community and for a period of more than twenty years he served as town assessor and gained an enviable reputation in his work. For several years past he has been incapacitated for active work and had lived a life of retirement, never, however, losing his interest in the world's doings and he was well posted. He was a progressive agriculturist and the farm which he owned was one well-improved. Mr. Kiel was a man known for his general whole souled nature, always agreeable and pleasant and even in the last years of his life when affliction had made life a burden at times, he never lost his kindly manner and many will remember him for it. Mrs. Kiel died some years ago and was sincerely mourned by her husband. The funeral will be held Tuesday, Rev. Graether of the Reformed Church, officiating.

Mrs. Moritz Kiel, living about 4 miles north of this place on the town line road, while crossing the street near her residence, noticed a run-away team, close upon her, which she attempted to dodge, but failed, the horses ran her down and she was picked up in an insensible condition but after a time revived sufficiently to tell the cause of the accident. She was at last got into comfortable condition when Mr. Kiel immediately came to town to obtain a warrant for the arrest of the driver of the run-away team. Officer Pierce started and at last found the corpse of the culprit, who, it appears, being under the influence of liquor, had (after running down Mrs. Kiel) a second run-away, which resulted in his own death before the warrant could be served. The last reports are that Mrs. Kiel is very badly hurt and not expected to live. -- Manitowoc Cor., Milwaukee Sentinel Manitowoc Tribune - Thurs., Apr. 18, 1878 ***** [cause: dropsy of the heart]\n\nWILHELMINE KIEL (d. 1916) DEATH CLAIMS TWO OF SAME NAME, RESIDENTS IN SAME BLOCK, WITHIN PERIOD OF 24 HOURS; PIONEERS MRS.

Kieselhorst received a message Saturday from the war department notifying him of the death of his son, Private Elmer Kieselhorst in France, August 11. He was wounded on August 8 and died three days later. He was 23 years of age and left here for Camp Custer Sept, 1917. On September 21, messages were received from the war department announcing that Private Kieselhorst had been wounded in action on August 8 but no further word reached the family. Several weeks ago, Mr. Kieselhorst made an appeal to the Red Cross to assist in securing information as to the fate or whereabouts of his son, but the society was unable to find any record of the case and Mr. Kieselhorst last week appealed to the war department for information. Saturday night came the message announcing that his son had died August 11 from wounds received August 8. Mr. Kieselhorst has demanded an explanation from the war department of the long delay in reporting the death of his son. The deceased is survived by his parents, one sister, Mrs. Albert Ramminger of this city and a brother, Arnold of Crandon, Wis.

Miss Kieselhorsts death occurred at the family home on Washington street and the announcement is received with sincere sorrow by a large circle of friends to whom she had endeared herself. Miss Kieselhorst was but 25 years of age, having been born in this city Nov. 11, 1889. She attended the local schools and later became a teacher at Kiel and at Florence, Wis. Two years ago she contracted a cold which settled upon the lungs and developed tuberculosis and although everything known to medical science and every loving care was administered, the insidious disease sapped her vitals and day by day the responsive flame grew smaller until the breath of Death extinguished. Through months of suffering and despair the feeble flame shone out against hope but it was vain and the end came at 8:30 yesterday. In the early days of her illness Miss Kieselhorst entered the sanatorium at River Pines, Stevens Point and it was thought that the illness had been checked and that she would be restored to health, but gradually the inroads of the disease became apparent and for weeks death had been but a question of time. A pathetic incident of the death of Miss Kieselhorst was the arrival here after her demise of George D. Seibert of Colgate, Wis., her affianced husband who, receiving the message that the end was near, hastened to the bedside of the girl who he had hoped a year ago to claim as a bride. Mr. Siebert arrived in the city last evening, an hour after death had claimed Miss Kieselhorst. He will remain for the funeral. Realizing that death was at hand, Miss Kieselhorst yesterday requested that former girl friends, with whom she had associated at school be sent for and there was an affecting scene at the home when several of her friends visited her. Besides her parents decedent is survived by four sisters, Mrs. A. Roepke, Misses Lenora, Lillian and Irene Kieselhorst. The funeral will be held Monday afternoon at 1:30 from the home and at 2:30 from the Lutheran church.
