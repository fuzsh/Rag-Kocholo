        "text": "50 Sharing a Brat and a Beer\n\nThe Alumni Association provided me with training recently, and now I should be able to better assist the class as the manager of the page and address lists on my.nd.edu. I hope you will check out the website and let me know how it can be improved. I also learned that the class has funds available for expenses like newsletters, reunion expenses, Masses, etc. Please send your suggestions for use of the money and I’ll coordinate accordingly. Meg Tweedy wrote to report that her father, John F. McGoldrick, 94, died on June 28 in Brevard NC. Meg said that “Jack wrote a weekly humor column for the Notre Dame Scholastic during his senior year. He continued his writing, eventually becoming vice president of corporate communications at the American Can Company. Community service was always important to him, and after retiring in Brevard NC, he was a regular lector at Sacred Heart Catholic Church and treasurer of the Transylvania County Library Foundation Board during its campaign to build a new library. After over 30 years, he was honored as longest-serving volunteer at Sharing House, a charity offering crisis assistance, where he counseled residents in need.” Jack was predeceased by his wife of 65 years and fellow Marine, Peggy; he is survived by six children and eight grandchildren. Through Catherine Brown ’77, daughter of the late Leo J. Brown Jr., I became aware of the passing of Rev. Robert B. Gray, 93, on July 5 in Louisville KY. She told me that Father Bob was a classmate and lifelong friend of her dad. The Louisville Courier-Journal described how he started ND in 1945, joined the military after freshman year and completed his B.S. in Business Administration. Within a year, he decided to study for the priesthood and took classes in Latin and philosophy in preparation for the seminary. He entered in 1953 and was ordained on May 25, 1957. He initially was a teacher at St. Thomas Seminary, earned a M.Ed. from Xavier U and assisted at St. James Church in Elizabethtown KY. From 1970 to 1995, he was pastor at several Louisville parishes: St. Martha (associate), St. Vincent DePaul and St. Gregory the Great, where he organized an ecumenical relationship with New Salem Baptist Church. Catherine added: “Father Bob and Dad attended many a Notre Dame football weekend together, gathering over the years a large and faithful following of family and friends who accompanied them. Father Bob celebrated the funeral Mass for Dad in 2017. As my niece, Bridget, said, ‘we are sure that they are together, sharing a brat and a beer in heaven and cheering on the Irish.’” Father Bob is survived by two brothers and 14 nieces and nephews. Joseph E. Polk died on Feb. 19 in Beaumont TX. The Beaumont Enterprise provided a moving tribute: “His love of the outdoors and appreciation of nature was gifted to his family through many bird hunts and fishing trips at Labelle Ranch, much beach time on Bolivar Peninsula and some amazing offshore fishing trips where he shared his vast knowledge of the local waters. His wit and joie de vivre will be sorely missed by all who knew him. He was a loving and generous soul.” Joe was predeceased by his wives, Eleanor and Carol. He is survived by five children, nine grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Richard E. Leous passed away on March 2 in Buffalo NY. Dick had many nieces and nephews, including James A. Leous ’84. He is survived by his wife, Mary, five children and six grandchildren. William D. Tafel died on April 1 in Louisville KY at age 92. He served in the Air Force in Japan and Korea (1951-54). A Louisville native, Bill returned there with his new wife, Mildred (“Babe”), and started a career with Tafel Electric and Supply Company and, later, at Walter Wagner in commercial and industrial real estate. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that “Bill never met a stranger and was always initiating conversations with others. He loved sports, enjoyed tennis and golf, and constructed a paddle tennis court at his home, which brought years of enjoyment to the family and neighbors. Babe and Bill were always the first onto the dance floor and loved to jitterbug to big band music.” Bill is survived by his wife of 68 years, six children, 13 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

By the time you read this, we will be well into our game schedule. Unfortunately, I have sad news about a few of our classmates. Lee Brown, Albuquerque NM, passed away in June according to his wife, Monica. Lee received his PhD in 1963 and spent his career in the Rocky Mountain West, first as a professor at the U of Colorado and then as a technical researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Mike Piarulli of South Jersey passed away in August 2020. Mike was a prominent attorney and businessman. Joe Puetz ’87 informed me that his father, Bill Puetz of Primrose NE, passed away at age 93 in June. Bill ran his own insurance company for years. It is too bad we missed our reunion in June, but there is a rumor that we may have an in-person reunion in June 2022. We should all plan to be there if it comes about. I received a great email from Bob Murphy of Granger IN. Bob shared some interesting information about the Murphy clan that I’d like to share with you: “Notre Dame has long been the preference for many graduates of Cathedral High School, a CSC institution in Indianapolis. Michael J. Duffey Jr. ’27 and Frank J. Mootz Sr. ’27, ‘28MS, ’30PhD, CHS graduates, started at ND in 1923, graduated in 1927, and Uncle Frank completed his graduate studies in 1930. There have been a total of 33 family graduates of Notre Dame. And there has been a family member at Notre Dame each decade beginning in 1923. These include two PHDs and two MS degrees and two JD degrees. The total number includes 13 Murphys, five Jeffers and three Mootz. Included in the group is James E. Murphy Sr. ’47. Jim served for many years as associate vice president for University relations. His granddaughter Adrienne Murphy ’09 was the salutatorian of her class. President Obama addressed the graduates. The families of these graduates are profoundly grateful for the spirit and grace that has emanated from the aura of Our Lady’s University.” That is quite a legacy. And don’t forget, we still have books to sell. — Jim Gillis; 3267 Rossmoor Parkway, No. 4, Walnut Creek CA 94595; 925-932-6454; jimjanegillis@aol.com\n\n52 70th Coming Up\n\nOops, I blew it in the spring issue. I meant to get you all thinking about our 70th. Apparently, there will be a lottery for rooms at the Morris Inn. Hopefully, you made your reservation. I was going to do a bit about Joe Brown, but his obituary in May covered it all. RIP Joe. I heard from John Marhoefer that he and wife Mary Beth were expecting their seventh great-grandchild in May. Jack Wagner said he never bought the Irish fatalism of his mother’s McGowan side of the family. The suffering life was not appealing. Wisconsin Dells had a lot of Irish. Their parish priest, Rev. Tom Readon, had a great tenor voice and could read the Latin Gospels faster than anyone. I guess Jack never heard Father “Rabbit” in Cavanaugh Hall say Mass in six or seven minutes. Father Tom convinced Jack to take the optimistic route in life and focus on the mountain tops. Eleven first cousins lived in three houses nine miles from the Dells and prayed the Rosary during Lent. If Jack overstayed a visit, he could be caught in another Rosary. He never feared a tornado as his mother would sprinkle holy water in all the rooms. Dick Sheridan said he had a Mini Cooper instead of a Rolls, Porsche or Mercedes. It is a nice ride, a British design built in Germany. Tom Blakely said he is retiring for the third time, sort of. He provided mental health counseling for 65 years, wrote 78 articles and plans to continue writing. He and Alice remain involved with their six children. He earned two master’s degrees and a PhD after ND. It turns out there were night lights in Bob Kamph’s room in Morrissey, according to John Minck. Again, a wire (extension cord this time) came from the hall nightlights down by the water pipes. John had a hand in designing the kill switch with a paperclip. John loved popcorn and brought 100 pounds with him so there was plenty for visitations, and there was electricity to pop more. A couple of memories came from Bill Delaney. In October ’51, he and roommate Dick Stubbing drove to an ND game against Detroit, a rare matchup. After the game, 40-6, they decided to stay the night in Detroit, but rooms were pretty much taken and they were stuck in a room with one bed. After that night of sharing a bed, Bill decided to become a bachelor — that is, until he met Maria Mercedes Aponte in ’54. They have been married for 67 years. On Oct. 4, 1952, Bill found himself at the ND-Texas game in Dallas after an Air Force freebee ride from Memphis, where he was stationed. He met Charlie Callahan ’38, ND sports publicity director, whom he had worked with while a student, and Charlie gave him a pass to a vacant press box. A few minutes later, in came a gentleman who looked familiar, but Bill could not place him. At halftime, a call came over the speaker: “Will Mr. Ben Hogan [the professional golfer] please report to the press box for a phone call.” Bill contacted Ben several years later to see if he remembered that situation. He said he generally went to all the Texas games and didn’t remember that one. Bill did get an autograph. — Tony Messina; 8202 Drybank Drive, Huntington Beach CA 92646; 626-695-4299; tonyandirene@gmail.com\n\n53 90 Years and Counting\n\nThe surviving population of the Class of 1953 has experienced a 90th birthday. This has been accomplished with little or no input. All we had to do to reach the 90th mile marker was wake up every morning. Through the years, the question has been asked and I have been less than diligent in the research, “What percentage of the class is deceased?” In less than accounting precision, it appears 705 of our 975 graduating group are deceased. Close to 70 percent? The milestone of the 90th has been described differently by different people, though the wonderment as to “why me” is universal. Despite “the two-minute warning,” “running out the clock” and “home stretch,” to name but a few, with the same result, we are still here. Dick Casper embarked on his 19th European trip with a six-week stay in Italy. His wife attended school in Italy, so they had ready-made friends. A need for relief from the daily domestic chores has propelled two of our classmates to make the move to assisted living. Bill DeCrick is leaving central Florida for the Sarasota area to be near a son. Bill was to send me some pictures and other memorabilia from “our days.” We recall that Bill and his camera were rarely separated. Larry Murray is struggling to find a home for 5,000 books and many copies of his 51 authored tomes, as his new quarters can’t accommodate all those books. He and Alice remain in the St. Louis area. Larry remains upbeat notwithstanding macular degeneration. Ed Duggan is ever on the lookout for contributions to the broadcasts and column. He is doing well and staying in communication with “family and ND news.” Thanks, Ed. We are glad you are staying strong. Paul Curtin graciously communicated after an absence. Spouse Gail fell and is now forced to use a wheelchair, but remains upbeat. We recall Paul and Gail moved from Austin TX to the Chicago area to be near their ND graduate children. Jack Dilenschneider announced his return to Columbus OH from Florida after many months with a daughter and son-in-law. The current plan is to inter the mother of his 10 children in a crypt facing Saint Mary’s College this summer. They are confident of complying with Rose Marie’s wishes in this regard. Gathering all the children from various spots around the world has taken “some doing.” Jack, Walt Werner and Gerry Voit, senior roommates in the basement of Sorin, meet by Zoom each week. In March, they Zoomed with the three present occupants of the Sorin room they lived in so many years ago. That must have been some call. Bob Straley is the author of a book series, We Are Family, on his life, including his days at ND as a Navy ROTC student. The books are available on Amazon and use his pen name, Bob Traley. Michelle Maus, daughter-in-law of Bill Maus, underwent heart valve replacement in June. Her recovery has not been a walk in the park, though it is following a predictable course. Michelle is a pleasant and strong young lady. Matthew Markert passed away in Cleveland. Mike Turco died in Riverside CA. Pray for the deceased and the ailing, of which there are many, and pray for guidance of our Church. — Jerry Mulvihill; 51098 Heatherton Court, Granger IN 46530; res: 574/287-3460; domerhill@aol.com\n\n53JD Class Secretary — Bob Berry;\n\n5806 Spaulding St., Omaha NE 68104; 402-457-4142; yokeemup@aol.com\n\n54 Has Your Life Changed?\n\nThe pandemic seems to have eased up, but the new variant is raising concerns. In many places, hospitals are seeing an increase of patients and those patients are not vaccinated. So, please for yourself, your family, and others, get vaccinated. Our bishop has allowed the sign of peace. One of our priests announced that if the other party does not wish to shake hands, do not punch him out as that would be a sign of violence, not peace. That got a laugh. Since Walt Duschka died, I have stayed in touch with his niece, Julie. Over several months, she learned what I did and what I am doing. She suddenly shocked me with the words, “Write a book. What you have done, saving lives, helping the sick and injured, raising a family and more would be interesting.” I gave her idea serious thought and decided to give it a try. I called her a few weeks ago about two things I remember from my early years in the Bronx. A small sailboat got away from me and I fell into a pond. No park and sailboats for a month. As a family, we attended St. Nicholas of Tollentine a few blocks away. If I could not see the altar, I would say, “Get out of my way. I want to see God.” Adults smiled and my parents were embarrassed. Julie remarked, “There is your book title.” This will keep me out of trouble. My two youngest sons are retired, and one lives 20 minutes away. I had a note from Jim Loonam. He celebrated his 60th wedding anniversary in June. He sees Carl Farah off and on and will see Hugh Haggerty in a few days as he lives in Ocala about 90 minutes away. Don’t forget our Class Mass. The weekends of February 20 and February 27 are the closest to the 54th day of the year. The following have been called home to God: Paul Gilsinger, Michael Scanlon, James Coyne, John Gustainis and Theodore Shafer. Please remember them and their families in your prayers. Go Irish. God bless. — John Mertens; 2730 Ocean Shore Blvd., Apt. 207, Ormond Beach FL 32176; cell 845-216-7251; jacknd54@gmail.com\n\n55 Another Beautiful Season\n\nFall at Notre Dame: football and changing leaves, a great combination. Now to the “antics of ND ’55.” A nice note came from Pat Kearns. He and Joann settled in The Villages in Florida, close to family and golf. Owen Sodetz asks if we plan any activity for the 2022 reunion. The answer is yes. My hero, Jack Flynn, supplied an update on the Chicago bunch. Class president Dick Burke and Marjeanne are back from Palm Springs and on to the law firm. Jack and Stephanie had lunch with the Burkes and Jerry Prassas and Gail. Another lunch “happening” was with Mike Kelly, Jerry Hillsman, Dick Cook and Jack Pinter. Sharon and Howard Hart have a new spot in Ft. Myers. The report is that they “flunked” senior living due to quarantine issues. Joe McGlynn sent a physician’s look at some of today’s public activity. Congratulations to Frank Tonini and his bride as they celebrate 61 years of wedded bliss. They met while Frank was on a Fulbright Scholarship in Italy. The rest is history. Dave Scheele reports that virus restrictions have been lifted in his community. He will be back at glockenspiel concerts at the assisted living facilities. He also is planning on a Thanksgiving Caribbean cruise. I got a great note from Dr. Frank Schmidt. He and Donna are continuing to stay at their farm in Poplarville MS. Their next adventure is to attend six grandkids’ graduations. They also plan to visit friends in Jackson Hole WY. Frank will reconnect with a Marine vet who was a surgical patient of his in Vietnam. Finally, a trip to Rome and the Vatican is in their fall schedule. Czar Don Shanley sent a great video on gun control in Switzerland and reports on re-entry into the world of skeet shooting competition. It was great to hear from Dan Moore. He and Pat finished an eight-day visit with old friends in Alaska. They had a good time visiting with colleagues and returning to the courthouse. An updated note came from Leo Hawk, who married roomie Jerry Froelich’s sister. Son Jeffrey ’80 passed away two years ago. Jeffrey’s two children are ND grads with evangelist names: Matthew ’12, ’14MFA and Mark ’19PhD. Matthew’s wife, Katie ’12, is also a ND grad. Leo wanted to be sure all grandkids’ names were included. Here goes: Michele, Bryan, Meghan, Craig, Katie, Tim, Michele, Daniel and Matthew. We Magills are going to the ND-FSU game in Tallahassee as well as the Cincinnati and USC games at ND. We hope to see Helen and Joe McGlynn on campus. Sandra Fullmer sent a lovely Father’s Day tribute. Continued thanks to Leon Ring for keeping track of who is around. Bob McGrath continues a great job as webmaster, medical consultant and “Heading Home” provider. Bob and Joan plan a family ND visit for the Purdue game. Bill Richardson sends his nomination for ND “Male Athlete of the Year.” He advises that Yared Nuguse ’21 broke the NCAA record in 1500 meters (he also qualified for the Olympics). That is darned fast. The young man is a biochemistry major. A nice call came from Harry Niemann. It was good to hear from him. Jerry Hughes sent a great collection of moon photographs. He also sent a story on Henry Ford’s “invention” of charcoal briquettes. Jim Bourne checked in from Vermont. It was too cold for a swim in Lake Champlain. Frank Orlando claims his golf at age 87 needs improvement. Me too. Our ranks got a little bit thinner. Jim Cahill, Bob Copeland, Jim Korte, Jim Rickling, Jim Shane, and Bill Reale are now with Our Lady. Keep them and their families in your prayers. God bless. Keep in touch. — Tom Magill; 119 Atlantic Road, North Palm Beach FL 33408; 561-842-3019; magillt@bellsouth.net\n\n56 Reunion Memories\n\nOur 65th reunion was at the Morris Inn June 15-17. Dottie and I met with Jim Revord, Henry Dixon, Angelo Capozzi Jr., Ang Capozzi III ’83, Jerome Sweeney, Joe Kalbas, John Polking, Leo O’Donnell, Dave Collins, Dick Yeager, Tom Rohrer, Paul Noland, John Kegaly, Frank Conte, Bob Welsh and Paul Sikora. See our website, nd56.org, for photos of the gang. The Morris Inn was ideal, and campus was quiet with some construction on Notre Dame Avenue. We had interesting presentations from Rev. Nate Wills, CSC, ’99, ’03MEd, ’05MDiv from the Alliance for Catholic Education and football team chaplain, and Rev. John Kimes ’95 from the Notre Dame Law School. Father Kimes, a Canon lawyer, spoke about the Catholic culture at Notre Dame. Mary Pat and Joe Kalbas made our arrangements perfect. Jim Revord, our deacon, gave a wonderful homily at our Class Mass at Keough Hall. John Manion continues his concerns for the class. Don Fish died March 18 in Olean NY. He was magna cum laude at ND, a Georgetown Law grad, and an attorney in the Dept. of Justice under Robert Kennedy. He practiced in southwestern New York, and was a devout Catholic. Dan McNamara died Feb. 28 in Jackson MS. He attended ND with his twin brother, David, on football scholarships. He loved his faith, tennis and all things Irish. Don Walz died March 26 in Hickory NC. He was in the Navy, worked at Allied Chemical and as a hosiery broker, and served as a Eucharistic Minister. Bill Copeland died Feb. 2 in Naples FL. He was the fastest high school half-miler in the country and got a track scholarship to ND. He served in the Air Force and was in business with wife, Pat. He was an economist and a resource for Congress and US Commerce. Bill Hauser died March 20 in Kennett Square PA. He had a PhD in chemistry, was an expert in physical and photochemistry and had many patents. John Allen died April 20 in Port St. Lucie FL. He was born in Buffalo, played football in high school against ND classmates Gene O’Connor and yours truly, Ed Cosgrove. He was proud of his ND education, was a regular at games and reunions, managed freight companies and worked at soup kitchens. Bill Veach died April 11 in Richmond IN. He was a grad of Culver Military Academy and served in the Army. His interests were Veach’s Toy Store in Richmond, ND and sailing. Dick Huebner died March 31 in Fox Point WI. He was involved in industrial photography. He was married to Susan and had three wonderful daughters. Dan Devine died April 16 in Royal Oak MI. He served in the Navy, was a trial lawyer, a devout Catholic, and sang the ND Victory March with gusto. Joe Scheibel died April 12 in Tinley Park IL. He was an Army vet, worked for Cook County and was on the debate team at ND. Tom McIntire died Oct. 20, 2020, in Rockford IL. In the Air Force, he flew 78 combat missions in Southeast Asia and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. Joe Roos died July 4 in Syracuse NY. He was a brother of the Holy Cross, taught math at Bishop Grimes and loved Ann for 48 years. Son Joe ’96 and daughter-in-law Jennifer ’96 were grads of ND. Bud Toepp died March 15, 2020, in Naperville IL. He grew up in South Bend and got an MBA at Indiana U. He worked for Lucent Technologies as a consultant for software and at Loaves and Fishes Pantries. Bill Warren stepped down as trustee emeritus. He did much work with Warren Clinic and hospitals in Tulsa. A new book came out on the notable CIA agent and classmate Phil Agee by Jonathan Stevenson. I had a great chat with Bill Boraczek, who is well in White Plains NY. Larry Kennedy reports that a total of $70,000 was distributed to three students in scholarships this past year. Bill Stotzer sent a list of ND alumni who died during the Vietnam War. Lou Malandra’s granddaughter, Caroline, is a first-team softball all-star from Serra Catholic in McKeesport PA. Joe Spiegel sent our class a nice gift. Bob McGeary asked about John Manion, who is improving. Paul Noland sent road safety info; reach out to him for more. Sil Resciniti called hoping to make the reunion. Chet Mitchell and Bill Kearney, who graduated in 1952 from Leo High School, got on the phone together after many years. Sid Wilkin, Charley Conway and Hal Spencer sent notes of encouragement to all. Our reunion had 14 classmates and a total of 30 attendees. Tom Rohrer, formerly of the ND track team, brought wife Judy and five friends. Let’s get more for next year’s reunion. Vita, Dulcedo, Spes. Go Irish. — Ed Cosgrove; 525 Delaware Ave., Buffalo NY 14202; bus 716- 854-2211; eccosgrove@cosgrovelawfirm.com\n\n56JD Class Secretary — Lauren Sharkey;\n\n703-927-2089; lksharkey@gmail.com\n\n57 Another Icon Leaves Us\n\nJohn P. McMeel, co-founder and chairman emeritus of Andrews McMeel Universal, passed away July 7. John was the son of ND’s team doctor under Knute Rockne ’14, growing up in the shadow of the Golden Dome. In South Bend, John met Jim Andrews, initiating a lifelong friendship. In 1970 they founded Universal Press, which later would be called Andrews McMeel Universal after the passing of Jim in 1980. Sometimes characterized as the “ultimate salesman” (he earned the moniker “Deals McMeel” at Notre Dame), John’s energized personality helped catapult the company into one of the most influential and successful media companies in the country. It is hard to overestimate John’s influence on the publishing and entertainment industry and AMU’s impact on popular culture. He worked with creators, including Bill Watterson (Calvin and Hobbes), Cathy Guisewite (Cathy), Garry Trudeau (Doonesbury), Gary Larson (The Far Side), Jim Davis (Garfield) and Tom Wilson (Ziggy), to name a few. John is survived by his wife and their three daughters. I encourage you to read his full obituary. Raymond J. Buellesbach Jr. died July 25, 2020. He is survived by his wife, Nancy, and three of his four children. Francis S. “Mike” Connelly passed April 21, with his wife of 59 years, Emme, by his side. Mike was instrumental in elevating the ND Swim Club to a collegiate level competitive swimming program. Barry J. Corona passed away on April 10. He was survived by his loving wife of 36 years, Gloria, his children, stepchildren and grandchildren. Gerald F. “Gerry” Geisler MD died May 21. Gerry was drafted into the Navy and earned the Vietnam Civic Action Medal of Honor. He had a successful career practicing in cardiac, vascular and thoracic surgery at Baylor Hospital. He is survived by his wife, Mary. Henry “Bill” Henrikson died on April 3. Bill served 25 years in the Air Force and worked to provide the US and its allies reconnaissance for strategic and tactical operations. Bill was preceded in death by his wife, June. James R. Jones passed on May 8. He was involved in the worldwide Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities. Jim was the son of the former business manager under Rockne. He is survived by his wife, Carol, and their seven children. John A. Kirchner died April 25. He was predeceased by his wife, Shirley, and two of their six children. Douglas “Doug” McKay passed away on March 17 at his home in Dowagiac MI with his loving wife of 60 years, Nancy, and his three children by his side. Doug was a businessman and pub owner, for whom we should raise a jar on the anniversary of his passing. William R. McClarnon passed away on May 22. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Kiyo. Max R. Olinger died on Feb. 25. He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Dorothy, their children and grandchildren. After serving in the Army for three years, he began and developed his highway construction career. John J. Sullivan passed away April 20. After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and a master’s at Princeton, he worked for United Aircraft Corporation, then the Xerox Corporation, where he retired in 1997. John is survived by his wife of 58 years, Dianne, and four children. Donald E. Wasik passed away on March 12. After enlisting in the Air Force, he was accepted to ND, where his roommate, Bob Orner, would become his best friend. He met his love of 61 years, Audrey, on a blind date, and told Bob he found a match for him, too: her identical twin sister, Anne. As he predicted, in 1959 the McMullen twins wedded the ND alums in a storybook double wedding ceremony. He is survived by his wife, five children, grandchildren and many others who loved him. They also wonder if he tells his jokes, if St. Peter will send him back. Thomas Henry Riley passed away on June 21. Beloved husband to Patricia for 62 years and a loving father, he practiced law in Chicago. Don’t forget to stop and smell the roses while we still can. Peace. — John A. Slevin; 6123 N. Mandalay Drive, Peoria IL; 309-453-8986; jslev57@gmail.com\n\n57JD Remembering Tom and Pat\n\nThomas S. Calder ’54, ‘57JD, longtime secretary of the Notre Dame Law School Class of 1957, went to his eternal rest February 25, 2021, at the age of 88. A Walsh Hall man in his undgraduate days, Tom matriculated from the College of Arts & Letters before earning his JD in ‘57. For 65 years, he was a top practitioner, primarily in general litigation cases, and was on the roster at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP in Cincinnati at the time of his passing. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Patricia, and is survived by sons J.D. and Stephen and grandchildren Elizabeth, Alexander and Charlotte. Peace be with them. Patrick Berrigan, 87, of Lewiston NY was reunited with his Holy Father on March 6, 2021. Just as Pat would have wanted, he passed peacefully in the comfort of his home surrounded by his loving wife and eight children. Pat was a devout Catholic and his deep faith guided him in every aspect of his life. He loved, worked and played with the ultimate intensity. His greatest love was his wife of 63 years, Shirley, whom he met during his years of law school at Notre Dame. Their special place during courtship was the Grotto, which was completely illuminated in celebration of his life. During his time at ND, he received the Harry English Award for Outstanding Senior, and he demonstrated a lifetime of love and loyalty to his alma mater, which has now educated three generations of the family: Pat Jr. ’83, Patrick III ’16, ’17MSA, Halie ’17, ’19MEd and Ryan ’21. Pat and Shirley were married on July 6, 1957. They started their life together in Augusta GA, where Pat served in the US Army from 1957-59 at Fort Gordon. Pat joined Runals, Broderick, Shoemaker, Rickert, Berrigan & Dougherty law firm in Niagara Falls in 1959.

It continues with Lee Kiefer ’17 who won a gold medal in the women’s individual foil division in the Tokyo Olympics, while being enrolled in medical school at the U of Kentucky. Our 2020-21 ND fencing team won its 11th national championship, tying the ND football team in national titles. It brought back great memories of the men in our class, who trained under coaches Walter Langford ’30 and Mike DeCicco ’49: Ted Bares (El Cajon CA), Jim Brogan (d. 7/16/2020), Dan Clancy (Avon Lake OH), Chas Duggan (d. 3/26/2007), Patrick Green (d. 5/24/2011), Jim Johnson (Saint Charles IL), Joe Klein (San Antonio TX), John Lauerman (d. 10/20/2011), Tom Lee (Memphis TN), Claus Muller-Bergh (Glencoe IL) and Dave Schwartz (Pittsburgh PA). Our 1959 classmates, and their underclassmen teammates, were 13-2 during our senior year and an amazing 16-0 our junior year. It is interesting and pretty amazing because they were all walk-ons. ND athletics did not award grants-in-aid in fencing in the late 1950s. In our winter 2020 Class Notes column, we mentioned classmates who served as faculty members in higher education. Added to that list is Pete Salsich (Saint Louis MO), who served on the faculty of the School of Law at Saint Louis University from 1969 until his retirement in 2016. In the last several years of his teaching career at SLU, Pete (an ND monogram winner in football) was the McDonnell Professor of Justice in American Society and held a joint appointment in the Department of Public Policy Studies. Pete Hackett has agreed to serve as our class treasurer, following the passing of Bo Broemmel last December. In recent years, this fund provides a stipend to a Holy Cross priest who will offer a Mass on the Notre Dame campus for each deceased classmate. Additional contributions to the class treasury are welcomed and may be sent to Pete at Clark, Schaefer & Hackett, 14 E. Main St., Ste. 500, Springfield OH 45502. Every column brings a bit of sad news as we remember those we have lost over the past few months. Paul Maren (Cincinnati) passed away on Nov. 18. Dan Muth’s wife, Anne, passed away on Nov. 15 while in hospice care in Tucson. Dan Cassidy’s wife, Alice, passed away in early May. John Frey passed away in Cincinnati on May 30.
