The defendants Max Miefer and Franz Eirenschmalz were heads of Aemter or offices within this Amtsgruppe C.\n\n9. Amtsgruppe D, which prior to March 1942 was known as the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps, was responsible, among other things, for the administration of the concentration camps and of the concentration camp inmates. It was responsible for the food, clothing, housing, sanitation, and medical care of the concentration camp inmates, and of the order, discipline, and regulation of the lives of the inmates.

No. 7 - 10 March 1947 - Image [View] [Download] Page 7\n\nMil Trib 2, Case 4 11.\n\nAll of the defendants herein, acting in concert with each other and with others, unlawfully, wilfully, and knowingly participated as leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices in the formulation and execution of the said common design, conspiracy, plans, and enterprises to commit, and which involved the commission of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, and accordingly are individually responsible for their own acts and for all acts performed by any person or persons in execution of the said common design, conspiracy, plans, and enterprises.\n\n12. The said common design, conspiracy, plans, and enterprises embraced the commission of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, as set forth in Counts Two and Three of this Indictment, in that the defendants unlawfully, wilfully, and knowingly encouraged, aided, abetted, and participated in the commission of atrocities and offenses against persons and property, including plunder of public and private property, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, unlawful imprisonment, torture, persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, ill-treatment of, and other inhumane and unlawful acts against thousands of persons, including German civilians, nationals of other countries, and prisoners of war.\n\n13. Between September 1939 and April 1945 all of the defendants herein unlawfully, wilfully, and knowingly committed War Crimes, as defined by Control Council Law No. 10, in that they were principals in, accessories to, ordered, abetted, took a consenting part in, and were connected with plans and enterprises involving the commission of atrocities and offenses against persons and property, including, but not limited to, plunder of public and private property, murder, torture, illegal imprisonment, and enslavement and deportation to slave labor of, and brutalities, atrocities, and other inhumane and criminal acts against thousands of persons. These crimes embraced, but were not limited to, the particulars set out in Paragraphs 4 to 10, inclusive, of this Indictment, which are incorporated herein by reference and the acts charged in Paragraphs 14 to 22, inclusive, and were committed against the civilian populations of occupied territories and prisoners of war.\n\nHLSL Seq. No. 8 - 10 March 1947 - Image [View] [Download] Page 8\n\nMil Trib 2, Case 4 14.\n\nThe concentration camps were the principal means through which the defendants committed the crimes charged. The WVHA took over jurisdiction of the concentration camps in Germany and the occupied countries and territories in the spring of 1942, and was charged with their operation, maintenance, and administration, and the establishment of new concentration camps. It was responsible for the food, clothing, housing, sanitation, and medical care of the inmates, and for the order, regulation, and discipline of their lives, and had power to exact the death penalty for infractions of its rules.\n\n15. The WVHA discharged the responsibility for the supply of the forced labor and services of concentration camp inmates and the allocation of such supply to public and private employers throughout Germany and the occupied countries and territories. It also forced thousands of concentration camp inmates and other persons into employment in the various industrial, and commercial enterprises which it operated.\n\n16. The established policy of the WVHA was to extract from the inmates of the concentration camps the greatest possible amount of work with the smallest possible amount of food, clothing, housing, sanitation, medical and surgical services, and other necessary provisions or facilities. This policy resulted, forceeably, in the deaths of thousands of people from disease or sheer physical exhaustion. For the vast majority of inmates, there was no provision for eventual resease from the concentration camps, except through death, and little or no provision or plan for sustaining life in those incapable of work. Epidemics of disease were treated by killing those afflicted. As a result of this policy, the disposal of bodies of the dead became a problem of insurmountable proportions.\n\n17. Concentration camp inmates were transported from one camp to another as the demands for labor and other circumstances might require. Thousands died on these transports from over-crowding, suffocation, hunger, thirst, cold, disease, physical exhaustion, and treatment by the SS guards. They were often forced to march long distances in cold weather with inadequate shoes and clothing.\n\nHLSL Seq. No. 9 - 10 March 1947 - Image [View] [Download] Page 9\n\nMil Trib 2, Case 4 18.\n\nThe murders, tortures and ill treatment charged were carried out by the defendants by divers methods, including gassing, shooting, hanging, whipping, beating, gross over-crowding, systematic under-nourishment, systematic imposition of labor tasks beyond the strength of those ordered to carry them out, medical, surgical, and biological experimentation on involuntary human subjects, criminal sterilization and castration of involuntary human subjects, inadequate provision of surgical and medical services, inadequate clothing, housing and sanitation, exposure to cold, over-work, and grossly inadequate facilities for transporting persons to and from concentration camps and labor camps.\n\n19. In Poland, Russia, and other countries the defendants assisted in planning and carrying out the plunder, spoliation, and confiscation of real and personal property of Jewish, Russian, Polish and other private owners, of churches, communities, towns, cities, and states, the deportation to slave labor and other purposes of civilians there resident, and the resettlement of such regions by peoples asserted by the Nazis to be Aryans. The defendants systematically confiscated the personal property of living and deceased inmates of concentration camps.\n\n20. Civilians and prisoners of war from all the countries of Europe were deported from their homelands and herded into concentration camps, some of which were fitted with special installations, such as gas-chambers and sealed buses, for their mass execution. Countless Jews, Poles, and Russians, upon their arrival into the concentration camps, were immediately driven from the transport trains and trucks into the waiting gas-chambers, where they were exterminated. Throughout the administration of the concentration camps, the worst treatment was systematically given Jews of all nationalities and Poles and Russians.\n\n21. The defendants assisted in planning and carrying out plans for the subjugation and extermination of entire \"races\" and nationalities considered inferior by the Nazi hierarchy. Clergymen, attorneys, intellectuals, and other persons were hunted down and transported to the concentration camps, where they were subjected to a calculated process of Mil Trib 2, Case 4 murder, torture, and ill treatment which the defendants perfected and were ever ready to administer.\n\nHLSL Seq. No. 10 - 10 March 1947 - Image [View] [Download] Page 10\n\nExperiments were carried out to determine how most efficiently to use the labor and services of the living members of undesired \"races\" and nationalities and to insure that such persons would be unable to propagate their kind. Inmates of concentration camps were forced to undergo castration and sterilization and to submit to experiments whose purpose was to ascertain a method by which mass sterilization of \"undesirable persons\" might be effected. Countless persons, including nationals of occupied territories, were murdered in the so-called \"euthanasia\" program of the German Reich."
