        "text": "As a child growing up in Benton Harbor, Michigan, Ernie Hudson wrote short stories, poems and songs, always thinking that his words might one day come to life on stage. After a short stint in the Marine Corps, he moved to Detroit where he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest Black theatre in the country. In addition, he enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills and found time to establish the Actors' Ensemble Theatre, where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. After graduating with a B.A. from Wayne State, he was rewarded a full scholarship to the M.F.A. program at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. While performing with the school's repertory company, he was asked to appear in the Los Angeles production of Lonne Elder III's musical \"Daddy Goodness,\" which led to his meeting Gordon Parks, who gave Hudson the costarring role in his first feature film, Leadbelly (1976). Unfortunately, all that followed \"Leadbelly\" was a year of \"bit parts and some harsh lessons about Hollywood,\" which led Hudson to enroll in another academic doctorate program at the University of Minnesota. He did not complete the program. Through his experience, he learned another vital lesson: \"There are those who spend their lives studying it and those who spend their lives doing it.\" Hudson definitely wanted to be in the second group. Keeping in mind this self-revelation, Hudson accepted the starring role of Jack Jefferson in the Minneapolis Theatre In The Round's production of \"The Great White Hope,\" a role that he put \"everything he had into,\" including shaving his head. A series of starring and guest roles followed on such television shows as Fantasy Island (1977), Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977), Unsere kleine Farm (1974), Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978), Taxi (1978), One Day at a Time (1975), Gimme a Break! (1981), Das A-Team (1983) and Webster (1983), as well as costarring roles in the TV movies White Mama (1980) with Bette Davis, Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979), Die Frauen von San Quentin (1983), Kalifornien, ich komme! (1985), Mad Bull - Der Supercatcher (1977) and Der Mörder und die Lady (1985). Other feature film credits include The Jazz Singer (1980), Was, du willst nicht? (1979), Spacehunter - Jäger im All (1983), Blutige Lorbeeren (1982), Auf die Bäume, ihr Affen! (1983), Joy of Sex (1984) and, of course, the mega-hit Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984).\n\nMichael Badalucco, a Brooklyn native, got his start in the entertainment industry at a very young age, going to work with his father Giuseppe, a Sicilian-born immigrant, who worked as a carpenter on movie sets. In 1963, during the filming of Fail Safe starring Henry Fonda, a photo of a young boy was needed. Eight-year old Badalucco posed for the picture, and thus began his acting career. He went on to Xaverian H.S. and got his first taste of theatre there in musicals like A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum and dramas like Shaw's St. Joan. He began his formal acting studies at the State University of New York at New Paltz. It was there that he cut his teeth on stage, performing in over 20 plays. He graduated with a B.A. in Theatre Arts in 1976. In 2003, his alma mater conferred upon him an honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, citing his \"extraordinary success while never losing perspective on what is important in life.\" His first speaking role was in the feature film Raging Bull, directed by Martin Scorsese, which led to additional roles in movies such as Broadway Danny Rose, directed by Woody Allen. Throughout the 1990's, Badalucco appeared in a series of memorable supporting roles in such acclaimed films as Miller's Crossing, Sleepless in Seattle, Jungle Fever, The Professional, and Mac. His performance in the romantic comedy One Fine Day,prompted star Michelle Pfeiffer to recommend Badalucco to her husband,David E. Kelley, for a role in his ABC television series The Practice. Not only did Badalucco get the part, but his performance as Jimmy Berluti would ultimately serve as his breakout role. In 1999 he received the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Next, on the big screen, he portrayed serial killer David Berkowitz in Spike Lee's Summer of Sam. He then stepped into the shoes of notorious gangster George \"Baby Face\" Nelson for the throwback Coen Brothers comedy, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and appeared in their subsequent film, The Man Who Wasn't There. He continues to pursue his craft on television, stage and screen. In addition to Badalucco's love of acting, he has been involved with a number of charitable organizations which include The Jimmy Fund and The Little Sisters of the Poor. In 2003, Habitat for Humanity of Los Angeles presented him with the Building Hope Award. He received the Heart of the City Award from Heartshare Human Services of New York in 2005. In 2013, he was inducted into the Diocese of Brooklyn Hall of Fame. Mr. Badalucco is privileged to support Italian-American causes through his work with the National Italian American Foundation and Arba Sicula, an organization which preserves, studies, and promotes the language and culture of Sicily. He is also a proud member of the New York Athletic Club, Tiro A Segno of New York, and The Italian American Marching Club of New Orleans, where he has served as Grand Marshal of its annual parade in honor of St. Joseph.\n\nTom Wilson is a creative artist whose professional career has explored almost every imaginable artistic discipline, blending them into a unique and very individual declaration of a life in the arts.

Tom has enjoyed a successful career as an actor, writer and comedian for over 20 years. He has more than 50 films, television shows and comedy specials to his credit, and has appeared on talk shows with everyone from Johnny Carson to Jay Leno to David Letterman to Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford.

His self-written one-man show, \"Cowboy Tommy,\" boasted a series of sold-out engagements. He continues to act in movies and television, and he performs comedy and music at theaters across America. As a writer and producer, he's written for several prestigious literary magazines, as well as for Universal Studios, Disney, Fox and Film Roman studios, and produced a groundbreaking series of debates for Canadian television called \"The Seven Deadly Sins\", which examined cultural values and the role of the arts within them. As an avocation, he is a photographer and painter, with a photograph in the permanent collection of the California Museum of Photography and paintings on the walls of the guest bedrooms of many close personal friends (or, as artists like to say, \"in many private collections.\") Actor, comedian, writer, musician, and artist - Tom Wilson has transcended the limitations of pop-cultural celebrity to become an artist of honesty, gravity and grace. Thomas is a graduate of Radnor high school in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was known for his comedic personality.\n\nA tall, wavy-haired US actor with a deep, resonant voice, Clancy Brown has proven himself a versatile performer with first-class contributions to theatre, feature films, television series and even animation.\n\nClarence J.

His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks (1994), Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles (1994) and Superman (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a \"tough-as-nails\" drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber (1997).\n\nThe video gaming industry took notice of Clancy's vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: Der Zorn des Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003).

An impressive 1974 performance in \"The Wine Sellers\" earned him a Los Angeles Critics Award nomination and a Dramalogue Award. The play was entitled \"What The Wine Sellers Buy\" when he played it earlier on Broadway. He won his first NAACP Image Award for his work in the play \"Eyes of the American.\"\n\nA writer and stage director as well, Glynn received his second NAACP Image award for his directing of \"Deadwood Dick\" at the Inner City Cultural Center. He segued these directing talents to TV where he helmed several episodes of \"The Parenthood,\" \"Hanging with Mr. Cooper\" and \"The Wayans Bros,\" among others. He also directed during his seasons of steady employment on College Fieber (1987), in which he played the role of Colonel Taylor for five seasons (1988-1993). The show's theme song was sung by his late ex-wife, legendary \"Queen of Soul\" artist Aretha Franklin. They divorced in 1984 after six years.\n\nGlynn began his film career in the 1970s with such \"blaxploitation\" flicks as Honky (1971), Five on the Black Hand Side (1973), Together Brothers (1974) and Thomasine & Bushrod (1974), then advanced to the cult classic Cooley High (1975), plus Der schwarze Fluß (1976) and A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich (1977). TV-movies included the prestigious Colorado Saga (1978), Attica - Revolte hinter Gittern (1980) and Minstrel Man (1977), for which he won his third NAACP Image Award, Flucht in die Freiheit (1994), Buffalo Soldiers (1997) and Freedom Song (2000). In the midst of these early movie roles, he was once considered to play \"Han Solo\" in the original \"Star Wars\" film.\n\nA regular fixture on the smaller screen, Glynn appeared in a host of guest appearances during this time included \"The Mod Squad,\" \"The Rookies,\" \"The Blue Knight,\" \"The Paper Chase,\" \"The Greatest American Hero,\" \"Fame,\" \"T.J. Hooker,\" \"Hail to the Chief,\" \"The Redd Foxx Show,\" \"Matlock,\" \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Touched by an Angel.\"\n\nThe actor has also participated in such mainstream, audience-favorite, adrenalin-packed movies as Gremlins - Kleine Monster (1984), Heiße Hölle L. A. (1986), Jenseits der weißen Linie (1992), Stella's Groove: Männer sind die halbe Miete (1998), Subterfuge (1996), Sahara - Abenteuer in der Wüste (2005), Burlesque (2010), Super 8 (2011) and Bumblebee (2018) along with the more critically acclaimed films Kings of the Evening (2008), Zeit für Legenden (2016) and Windows on the World (2019) have also come across his path. Adept at professional roles, Glynn has enjoyed recurring roles into the millennium on such TV series as The Wire (2002) (as a mayor); Episode #1.422 (as a judge); and Mr. Mercedes (2017) (as another judge).\n\nGlynn has returned from time to time to the theatre (2013, \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\"). The father of four children from his first and present third marriages (between singer Franklin).\n\nShe has show biz in her blood. Martha Plimpton was born November 16, 1970, in New York City to two actors: Keith Carradine and Shelley Plimpton. Martha began her career at age 8, when her mom had a friend of hers, composer Elizabeth Swados, enroll her in an actors' workshop. At age 10, she got a small part in Das Rollover-Komplott (1981), and also made a series of Calvin Klein commercials.\n\nHer first substantial film role was as a tomboy in Nur der Tod ist umsonst (1984); the following year, Steven Spielberg cast her in Die Goonies (1985). Martha met River Phoenix while they were both filming Mosquito Coast (1986), but since she was only 15 at the time, she did not go out with him. Even though she had a small part in the movie, it established her as a serious actress. Martha appeared in movies such as the screwball comedy Stars and Bars - Der ganz normale amerikanische Wahnsinn (1988) and, that same year, she was paired again with Phoenix in Die Flucht ins Ungewisse (1988). They dated for a while and then broke up. For a while, she was engaged to actor Jon Patrick Walker.\n\nAs if making movies didn't keep her busy enough, Martha frequently worked at theaters and made her Chicago debut with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company Ensemble in \"The Libertine\" in 1996. As a member of that ensemble, she received a National Medal of Arts award in the autumn of 1998. As for movies, Colin Fitz (1997) and Das Auge Gottes (1997) in which she plays the starring role, have been run at the Sundance Film Festival. Although some recent movies have had low box office (Der Pecker (1998) $2.1 million, and Eine Nacht in New York (1999) $6.8 million), Martha's performances shine and she often rises above her material.\n\nPerhaps recalling how important acting lessons were to her as a child, she donates her time and efforts to the \"52nd Street Project\" which is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to matching the inner-city children with professional theater artists to create original theater, by writing, directing and performing their own plays. Perhaps one of the inner-city kids she is coaching will be the next famous actress in Hollywood.\n\nIn both career and in real life, Bobby Cannavale tends to choose the unconventional way of doing things. Despite a lack of formal training and a rocky beginning to his career, the swarthy actor's strong work ethic enabled him to take a successful path off the crowded acting trail. From character goofball and cut-up, he has broken into the leading man ranks with his recent starring role as a reincarnated matchmaker in the TV series Cupid (2009).\n\nBorn Roberto M. Cannavale on May 3, 1971, in Union City, New Jersey, to an Italian-American father, Sal, and a Cuban mother, Isabel, he was involved in various activities at his Union City Catholic school, St. Michaels, while growing up. An altar boy, choir boy and lector, he also appeared in the church school's various musicals including his very first, \"Guys and Dolls\", in which he showed up as one of the gangsters, and \"The Music Man\", appearing as the lisping, scene-stealing tyke, \"Winthrop\".\n\nBobby's parents divorced when he was five years old and his mother moved the family to Puerto Rico for a couple of years. Eventually, they returned to the States and settled in Coconut Creek, Florida, where he attended high school. Restless and uncomfortable in any sort of regimented setting, he often got suspended for playing the class clown. Graduating in the late 1980s, and bitten by the acting bug, Bobby chose to return to the New York/New Jersey area in order to jump start an acting career. Working in bars to support himself, he again avoided the confines of an acting school and, instead, gained experience as a \"reader\" on occasion with the Naked Angels theatre company. During this time (1994), he met and married Jenny Lumet, the actress-daughter of director Sidney Lumet. They had son, Jake, the following year. The couple divorced in 2003.\n\nSpotted by playwright Lanford Wilson while performing in an East Village production of Larry Kramer's \"The Normal Heart\", Bobby was invited to join Wilson's prestigious Circle Repertory Theatre. As a \"reader\" for the company, he eventually earned stage parts in \"Chilean Holidays\" (1996) and in Wilson's \"Virgil Is Still the Frog Boy.\" He also went on to serve as understudy to Mark Linn-Baker in a 1998 production of \"A Flea in Her Ear\" and later replaced him. A noticeable role in the company's play, \"The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told\" by Paul Rudnick led to Bobby's being cast in the recurring role of a tugboat operator in the TV series Trinity (1998). Having only appeared in bit parts thus far in such movies as Nacht über Manhattan (1996), directed by Lumet, and Ich bin nicht Rappaport (1996), it was \"Trinity\" creator John Wells who caught Bobby's stage performance and handed him this career-making break on camera.\n\nBobby's \"nice-guy\" aura and blue-collar charm proved invaluable, if a bit restrictive. Once the \"Trinity\" series ended, Wells cast the 6'3\" lug with the trademark caterpillar brows and crooked smile as lovelorn paramedic \"Bobby Caffey\" in his series Third Watch: Einsatz am Limit (1999). The character became quite popular but Bobby, again feeling restricted and wishing to broaden his horizon as an actor, asked to be released from the show -- but \"in a big way\". Creator Wells obliged and had the paramedic fatally shot in the chest and then experience a \"beyond the grave\" union with his character's deceased, ne'er-do-well dad.\n\nBobby next joined the cast of father-in-law Sidney Lumet's acclaimed TV courtroom drama 100 Centre Street (2001), starring Alan Arkin, cast against type as a brazenly opportunistic prosecutor. He subsequently earned recurring roles on Ally McBeal (1997) (in 2002) and Six Feet Under - Gestorben wird immer (2001) (in 2004). As for films, Bobby was featured in Gloria (1999), Der Knochenjäger (1999), Washington Heights (2002) and Der Super-Guru (2002) by the time he scored as the gregarious food truck driver in the critically-hailed indie film Station Agent (2003), which paired him intriguingly opposite the diminutive actor Peter Dinklage.\n\nUnwilling to shirk away from more controversial roles such as his gay drug dealer who has the hots for a fellow prisoner in the acclaimed series Oz - Hölle hinter Gittern (1997) or his closeted dancing neophyte in the film comedy Darf ich bitten? (2004) starring Richard Gere, Bobby continued to elevate his status seesawing between film (The Devil and Daniel Webster (2003), Happy Endings (2005), Romance & Cigarettes (2005)) and TV assignments (the miniseries Kingpin (2003)). He earned big viewer points and an Emmy Award for his recurring portrayal of Will's dour cop/boyfriend on the hit sitcom Will & Grace (1998) in 2004. Elsewhere, on stage, he merited attention in such productions as \"Hurlyburly\" and earned a Tony Award nomination for his 2007 Broadway debut in \"Mauritius.\"\n\nAfter five consecutive failed pilots, Bobby has come front-and-center with his quirky starring role in the ABC series Cupid (2009), plus recurring roles in Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003) and Nurse Jackie (2009), and his second Emmy-winning part in Boardwalk Empire (2010). He continues to rake up credits on the big screen with (The Merry Gentleman (2008), Diminished Capacity (2008), The Take - Rache ist das Einzige, was zählt (2007), 100 Feet (2008), Roadie (2011), Blue Jasmine (2013), link=tt2883512], Ant-Man (2015), Tonya (2017), Zwischenstation (2018) and The Irishman (2019), and with fascinating continuing/regular roles on such TV series as Cupid (2009), Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003), Boardwalk Empire (2010), Nurse Jackie (2009), Vinyl (2016), Mr. Robot (2015) and Homecoming (2018), this dark, brutish character has plenty of staying power in both comedy and drama."
