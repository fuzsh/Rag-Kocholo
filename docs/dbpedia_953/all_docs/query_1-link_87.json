        "text": "⏳ Reflecting on an Amazing Journey: Two Years of Growth and Learning ⬇ As I look back on the last two years, my heart is filled with gratitude and pride for what we have achieved at QAbird. It has been an incredible journey of determination, hard work, and invaluable learning experiences. Since founding QAbird in mid 2022, I have been the sole owner and investor, not relying on any external financing. The first 10 months were particularly challenging as we worked tirelessly to initiate our first projects. However, through unwavering dedication and a solid team effort, we have built a robust corporate track record and now have several active projects providing exceptional services and consulting in Data Engineering, Quality Assurance in Databricks, and Digital Transformation. We are also proud to be an official Consulting & SI Databricks partner. 🗝 Key lessons I’ve learned during this time: • 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐬 𝐤𝐞𝐲: Persisting through the toughest times paves the way for success. • 𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤: Every milestone we achieve is a testament to our relentless efforts. • 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Our achievements are rooted in the strength and unity of our amazing team. • 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐦𝐚𝐩: These elements are crucial in guiding us towards our goals. 3️⃣ As we embark on our third year, I am incredibly excited about what lies ahead. With our solid foundation and a fantastic team, we are poised to elevate QAbird to new heights. ❤️ A heartfelt thank you to our incredible Team, friends, and family for their unwavering support and encouragement. Focusing on positive energy, even during the toughest moments, has been instrumental in driving our success. 🥂 Here’s to the lessons that have made me stronger and to an even more successful year ahead! (Picture taken during the sailing event in Mazury, where we spent three fantastic days with the team to celebrate 2 years of the company. - credits ViBRAND - Video może więcej) #Gratitude #TeamEffort #HardWork #Success #Growth #QAbird #LookingAhead\n\nIt’s my 24-year anniversary at Microsoft today and whilst I will save the bells and whistles post until this day in 2024 (hoping), I wanted to take a moment to answer the question I get asked most frequently – “What exactly do you do?”. The truth is, no two Chiefs of Staff do the same thing. It really depends on your own set of strengths and what your Principal (in my case, VP) needs from you. All Chiefs of staff need a blend of emotional intelligence, big-picture thinking, and the ability to know a little about a lot of things. They also need humility – this is a senior role, but it won’t be about making yourself the star, it’s about making your Principal and team look good. I often tell people asking about the role that you have to be ok with being the bridesmaid and not necessarily the bride! In my personal experience, it’s incredibly rewarding, ever-changing and it allows me to keep learning and growing. Thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way. I’ve shared below a snapshot of what it means to be a Chief of Staff in my own personal experience. This is written by me, and not meant to be fully representative of what it means to be a CoS in Microsoft, or anywhere else. As stated above, no two are the same. Here’s to another year to make it to 25.\n\nAs Kyndryl is going into its 3rd year, let me share how one of my passions has contributed to my engagement and progression as a leader. I love being in the mountains. I grew up in Germany very close to the Alps and have spend at least a week in the mountains every summer and every winter since then… hiking, climbing, downhill or cross-country skiing, always with family or friends. Olaf Keese Christoph Spreen Andreas Meister Boris Kubicek Gerd Gessinger Dr. Wolfram Hauff Christian Stahl Sebastian Schegk PhD Edmund Mangold I have found that a lot of the things you need in the mountains have been helping me develop as a leader: · In the mountains, you need to be restless about the weather conditions, continuously anticipating what my come next, and watching our for the members of your group. For Kyndryl this implies constantly checking on changing client needs and innovative ways to respond to them · In the mountains, you need to be empathetic, understanding how your fellow hikers are feeling today… are they up for another summit or rather up for another break? Within Kyndryl, this means get a good sense of needs of your client counterparts, an the skills of your ecosystem partners and team members · In the mountains, once you have embarked with your group on a tour, you are devoted to get there together with the group... you will experience success as a team. At Kyndryl, that is at the core of what we do: being devoted to the success of our clients, and assemble and lead teams to serve our clients · In the mountains, once you are on your way, you focus on your way, and you make sure you stay on the right track. That couldn’t be more true in a business context. With so many chances every day of becoming distracted, focus has been a key element of success for me. Finally, once you are out there, the mountains constantly remind you that nature is, and always will be, bigger than us. Something that helps me to start every single day with a fresh mind. #kyndryl2ndanniversary #Iamprogressinaction\n\nThis month marks 10 years since I joined AvePoint. It's the longest I've stayed in any organisation, but it's also impossible to be bored because every day is different. I thought I'd share my top 10 learnings from the past 10 years to mark this milestone in my career. * The people you work with make the job. And my goodness, do I work with some good people. From my colleagues to partners to customers to industry friends I am constantly working with just the best people. And I am so grateful for that. * Saying yes leads to some crazy adventures. It's how I ended up as a co-host of The Tech Edge on Ticker (which I still can't believe I get to do) saying yes to things has led me down some incredible paths. * But it's still ok to say no to some things. This one is a work in progress and I'm very good at telling others to do it and not doing it myself. But I'm trying really hard. * Keep going until someone tells you to stop. This has become a bit of a mantra for me, especially in the times I have felt somewhat lost. I remind myself to just keep going and if I'm on the wrong path, someone will tell me to stop. * It's ok to ask for help. Good grief I'm bad at this. Even though I tell every new starter at AvePoint that one of the best things about working here is people's willingness to help… it's another work in progress for me. * Be outcome focused. Don't worry so much about the 'how' but the 'what' it is you're trying to achieve. * You're allowed to be proud. It has been one of the joys of my life to do the work I have on AvePoint Opus and I am so, so proud of what we've delivered and continue to bring to the market. * Take a break when you're stuck. It took me way too long to learn this one, but now instead of staring at my screen, I take 5mins in my garden and often come unstuck very quickly * The 'I don't know how you do it' complex. I get this one a lot… but honestly, I just do a lot of stuff really badly. You can ask my husband and kids for confirmation * There is a story everywhere and storytelling is the hands down the best way of communicating. Even if you get trapped on a runaway bus… there is an IM story in there somewhere (yes, this actually happened). I can't tag everyone who has made an impact on me over the last decade but thank you to everyone who has put up with me over the last 10 years, even if you didn't have a choice about it 😋\n\n“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” - Mark Twain Think it's too good to be true? (It's not.) Prior to deciding to go “all in,” on a new corporate role this past fall, I initially had to navigate some deep internal curiosities (read: fears). - Was I leaning towards the familiar? - Was I putting my coaching & speaking dreams off for the one day maybe, instead of having the courage to go all in on those dreams now? Navigating our career journeys brings many inflection points. Nearly six months later, I can say hand to heart, Best. Decision. Ever. I get to show up every day and lean into my dreams at Rackspace. It simply looks a little different than I had imagined. “Rackers,” as we’re called, are a unique breed in the best possible way and I could not be more thrilled to be part of the team that is on the precipice of something truly extraordinary.

Together, we tackled complex challenges, shared knowledge, and celebrated victories. These talented colleagues became more than just coworkers; they became lifelong friends. 🤝 🚀 I had great managers who believed in my potential and provided me with multiple growth opportunities. Their support fueled my development, and helped me evolve into an experienced expert. But it wasn’t just about my own growth — I had the privilege of nurturing new talent within our team. Watching them flourish was incredibly rewarding. 🌱 🌟 VMware’s commitment to giving back resonated deeply with me. Through volunteering and community engagement, I discovered the profound impact of selfless acts. Whether it was supporting local causes or lending a helping hand to those in need, I learned that true fulfillment lies in making a difference. 🙌 🌠 As I await the next phase of my career, I’m filled with anticipation. What challenges lie ahead? Who will I meet on this new journey? 🌏 One thing is certain: the lessons and memories from my time at VMware will continue to guide me. Thank you, VMware, for an extraordinary chapter—I can’t wait to see where the path leads next! 🌈✨ #VMware #Farewell #NewBeginnings\n\nAs I approach the 90-day mark in my new role at Dell Technologies post-graduation, these past days have been busy, brilliant, and becoming. I have worked with talented individuals, forged my path, and made meaningful conversations. A special shoutout to my manager, Geeta Raval Vaghela, for sharing this insightful perspective during our conversation that \"Engineering is Science and Product Management is Art.\" This simplistic yet profound mindset of looking at product management and thereby building skills for it is my takeaway from these initial months as a Product Manager. Thank you boss for the lesson. Some other fulfilling conversations have been with individuals who wanted to hear my story. I hope I was able to provide some guidance, support and a pinch of inspiration in some way. After these conversations I reflected on a Ted Talk by Bill Burnett, and I realised I practiced the concepts of - 1. Prototype Conversation: the idea where I am interested in talking to people who are living the life I want in the future, today; they are doing what I want to do, today. So I ask them THEIR STORY. 2. Narrative Resonance: the idea that if this STORY has something I can relate with, something that sounds familiar - more like my story then I feel inspired and I can recognise a potential way of moving forward to building the future I want. ......these also sound similar to what most of us are doing when we connect with someone for a coffee chat. :) I have been fortunate to listen to stories that facilitated my career switch and relocation to the USA and I am inspired to pay it forward. So, if you are someone who wants to - 1. talk about switching from software engineering to product management, or 2. talk about moving to the USA - from personal, professional, academic and industry perspectives or 3. just say hi and discuss how we are doing life :) then you know where to find me. ✨ PS: that is a picture from a very happy and proud day. :) #ucberkeley #goldenbear #productmanager #newgrad #payitforward #iwork4dell"
