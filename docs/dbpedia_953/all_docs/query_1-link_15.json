        "text": "Students present their thought-provoking research findings\n\nPsychology major juniors Leila-Jayne Casison and Clara Slate-Liu are on their way to the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR) in California. But before presenting their findings on a national stage, the two Silversword athletes presented their research at the annual Na Liko Na‘auao Symposium, allowing them to fine tune their presentation and to anticipate any questions they may have to field.\n\n“I think today was a good trial run for us in terms of getting used to discussing our study with others, especially those who we’ve never met before,” Casison said. “I also think we’re getting better with having meaningful conversations with those who find interest in our study on our athletes.”\n\nTitled “The Sleep of University Student-Athletes,” Casison’s and Liu’s study looked at sleep patterns of fellow Swords, and they concluded that soccer players have the worst sleeping habits of all the athletes.\n\n“Their practices start at 6 in the morning and they go to bed late,” Casison and Slate-Liu said. “So, of course, they’re going to experience daytime fatigue. It should be an issue that our coaches and athletic director are made aware of.”\n\nA Silversword tennis player, Sydney Danielson was tireless in her pursuit of learning about avian malaria and avian pox effects on Hawaiian birds, such as the ‘amakihi, apapane and ‘i‘wi. A passionate naturalist, the Minnesota native looked at the two diseases and their impact on native birds’ population.\n\n“Symptoms include swollen, tumor-like lesions on unfeathered parts of a bird’s body, such as the feet, legs, eyes and base of the bill,” Danielson explained of avian pox. “Both diseases are very difficult to manage, and the continued viability of our native forest birds depends on the preservation of their habitat.”\n\nFor the past 22 years, student scholars have presented their yearlong work during this annual Symposium, allowing them to explain their research and answer questions from faculty, peers and at-large community members. In the past, students’ presentations have focused on mental health—especially the impact of COVID—physical health problems, substance abuse and even “climate monstrosities.”\n\nAccording to Amber Noguchi, Ph.D., Undergraduate Research and Pre-Professional Programs director, undergraduate and graduate research experience can look like a number of things. It can range from formal and clinical studies to data analysis, and creative works and beyond.\n\n“All of these presentations stem from research projects that have been collaborations between the student researchers and their faculty mentors,” Noguchi explains. “This undergraduate conference celebrates student scholars from across all academic disciplines.”\n\nFor the past several months, Lindsey Dimaya has locked herself in her room, unwilling to share with her parents the project that she was working on for the Na Liko Na‘auao Symposium. An avid reader, the 17-year-old teenager chose to do research on adult literacy and its impact on mental health.\n\nPointing to her presentation, dad Don Dimaya quipped that Lindsey finally explained why she isolated herself in her bedroom for all those hours. “Now it makes sense,” he said with a laugh. “Instead of getting her driver’s license last summer, she was busy with this.”\n\n“I looked at the correlation between adult literacy and mental health,” said Dimaya, a junior at Sacred Hearts Academy and a participant in Chaminade’s early college program. “One of the reasons I was interested in this research was because of a story I had heard about a mother who wanted to bake her daughter a birthday cake, but she couldn’t because she didn’t know how to read.”\n\nDimaya’s research yielded some interesting findings, including a connection between improved reading skills and better mental health, and regaining childhood memories that emerged as a result of enhanced literacy.\n\n“The breadth and depths of these projects have blown me away,” said President Lynn Babington, Ph.D., in her closing remarks at the Symposium. “I have been truly impressed walking around the room, and listening to your presentations and your interests.”\n\nIn his oral presentation, Anson Ekau ’25 demonstrated a beta dashboard that he developed for the Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center, helping the nonprofit to monitor the health of the pond and its inhabitants.\n\n“This fishpond once stretched all the way to Mauanlua Bay,” Ekau said. “Now you can walk around it in two minutes. However, fishponds are crucial to the survival of native species, and they also allow us to promote and preserve Native Hawaiian culture.”\n\nThe Symposium concluded with a presentation of the President Sue Wesselkamper Award, which acknowledges a student who has demonstrated extensive community and university service. In order to qualify for the prize, a student must have a minimum 3.5 GPA, show scholarship beyond classroom requirements by undertaking their own independent research or study, and must have presented their work both on and off campus. This year’s award went to Victoria Francois ’25, who gave a presentation on chronic pain among young adults and the effects of mindfulness.\n\n“I would do this again in a heartbeat,” said Francois of her research. “In doing research, I found that the world is your oyster, and that everything is open to you.”\n\nStudents share the meaning of their scholarships with donors\n\nHer voice quivering with emotion as she described the meaning of being awarded a scholarship during an annual honorary luncheon for donors, Audrey Pilar ’24 cited her mom and dad for instilling a belief in herself, sharing her parents’ story as a young couple struggling to make ends meet but never giving up and wanting more for her and her brother. Graduating in May with a major in Forensic Sciences, and minors in Chemistry and Data Science, Analytics and Visualization, the Mililani native admitted that, without her Dr. Feung Lee and Mrs. Mew Sin Lee Endowed Scholarship, she probably would have had to work three or more part-time jobs just to pay her tuition.\n\n“When my mom wanted to come to America to have a better life for me and her, she did,” Pilar said. “When my dad was belittled for having a young family, he and my mom hustled, got an education, and successfully raised my brother and me. What I am trying to get across here is that someone gave them a chance in their lives. Someone gave my mom and dad a chance to succeed in life, and they took it. This is what receiving a donor scholarship means to me. Hope and a chance for a better future.”\n\nIn the pursuit of higher education, many students face formidable barriers, with financial constraints being among the most prevalent. For many individuals from low- to even middle-income backgrounds, the dream of attending college or university often seems like an unattainable aspiration. However, scholarships serve as beacons of hope, illuminating pathways to academic success and unlocking doors to opportunities that would otherwise remain shut.\n\n“This year, between individual and Foundation scholarships, we supported 332 students with over $2 million, for an average scholarship award of $6,100, which is huge,” said Chaminade President, Lynn Babington, Ph.D. “Today, you’ll hear some of these students’ stories, and you’ll get a sense about their ambitions, their areas of academic interest and what they may have overcome to get here.”\n\nSeated with students, Adrienne Aquino ’26, Katherine Liu ’26, Erica Tiwari ’24 and Alani Meltel ’25, donors David and Christine Arita with daughter Jessica Schlais discussed each one’s goal, inspiring them to continue their education even long after they’ve graduated. The Aritas’ and Schlais’s American Floor and Home Foundation Scholarship is specifically earmarked for majors in the Environmental + Interior Design program.\n\nAn aspiring elementary education teacher, Aquino believes that early schooling provides a strong foundation for future learners. “Our graduation rates are getting lower and lower,” said the Kaneohe native. “We need more teachers if we want a better future for our keiki.”\n\nApplauding Aquino for her dedication to becoming an elementary teacher, David Arita dispensed a bit of advice to her: “If you inspire them, they will always remember you,” he told her. “I still remember the teachers who made a major impact in my life, and I will never forget them.”\n\nA sophomore Communication major, Easton DelaCruz ’26 has taken advantage of all the opportunities afforded to him since arriving on campus two years ago. He has been fortunate enough to engage in experiences that have enriched his education and broadened his perspective.\n\n“Your commitment to financial assistance has allowed students like me to engage in transformative experiences, shaping us into well-rounded individuals prepared to contribute to society,” DelaCruz said in his address to donors. “With the wealth of past and current experiences, and the ones to come at Chaminade, I plan to return home and become a public servant to help my home become a better place for my parents’ generation, my generation and generations to come.”\n\nIn this landscape of financial uncertainty, scholarships emerge as powerful catalysts for change. These financial awards, often based on academic merit, financial need, or a combination of both, play a pivotal role in dismantling barriers to higher education. By providing financial assistance, scholarships enable deserving students to access resources, facilities and opportunities that would otherwise remain beyond their grasp.\n\nBeyond financial assistance, scholarships also offer myriad opportunities for academic and personal growth. Many scholarship programs provide mentorship, networking opportunities and career development resources, empowering students to thrive both inside and outside the classroom. Furthermore, scholarships may fund internships, study abroad experiences and research projects, allowing students to broaden their horizons and cultivate valuable skills that enhance their employability and competitiveness in the job market.\n\n“We know education transforms lives; our students set out to change the world, and they are making a difference,” said Babington. “Our reach is all over the world. And we are proud of our Chaminade students and alumni.”\n\nHaley Hayakawa ’24 has all the bases covered\n\nHer fellow classmates think she’s playing Candy Crush on her laptop. But in actuality, Haley Hayakawa ’24 is eyeing her Google calendar, which is scattered with different colors, each representing a lab, class or work hours that she has committed to during the week.\n\nWhen the California native is not in a class or lab, she’s out in left field, shagging flies as a member of the Women’s Softball team. And during the summer, Hayakawa was working 40 hours a week at the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s field office in Kapolei, where she participated in the “Honors Internship Program,” which only accepts a sliver two percent of all its applications.\n\n“It was my first full-time job,” said the 22-year-old Forensic Science major. “It has been the best experience I’ve ever had; everybody there wants to be there, and they all want to help you.”\n\nAn avid softball player since the eighth grade, Hayakawa committed to Chaminade University when she was a junior in high school, the earliest a student athlete can officially commit to a Division I or Division II college.\n\n“I was recruited by Division I and Division II schools, but some wouldn’t allow their recruits to participate in sports if they plan to major in a hard science because of all the required labs,” Hayakawa said. “Chaminade does, and it’s one of the reasons I chose to come here.”\n\nShe was also familiar with Chaminade’s Forensics Science program, which requires its students to complete a rigorous, 135-hour internship with such offices as the Honolulu Department of the Medical Examiner, police departments in Hawaii and Guam or the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command’s Central Identification Laboratory.\n\n“During my junior year, I interned with the Medical Examiner Department, which gets involved with deaths as a result of violence, substance abuse, trauma, accidents or suicide, among other suspicious causes of death,” Hayakawa explained. “After reading some of the suicide notes, I was thankful to be stressed out because those notes helped put things in perspective for me.”\n\nAn ambitious go-getter from an early age, Hayakawa is the only child and holds high expectations from herself—and not her parents, Greg and Myra Hayakawa. In fact, her father often tells her “to be open to changes, and not everything happens as planned.”\n\n“In my freshman year, all I could eye was being awarded summa cum laude, which requires a 3.96 GPA,” Hayakawa notes. “I’ve only had one B and that was in Organic Biochemistry, which lowered my 4.0 GPA to 3.96.”\n\nIronically, one of her two American Chemical Society awards was being recognized as the Most Outstanding Student in Organic Biochemistry—despite her B—and Most Outstanding Student in Forensic Chemistry, nominated by David Carter, Ph.D., Forensic Sciences director and professor.\n\n“She also has minors in Biochemistry and Chemistry,” Carter says. “She is a stellar athlete on the softball team and she also works as one of our Forensic Sciences Laboratory Assistants.”\n\nHayakawa’s collegiate experience has certainly had its challenges. Her freshman year was during the height of COVID, which meant Hale Lokelani Residence Hall was in lockdown mode, limiting her interaction with fellow students except for her roommate Naomi Noguchi from Kauai. It was also her first time living away from home, and she couldn’t leave campus for three weeks. Meanwhile, the softball team couldn’t take to the gym and was forced to conduct its workouts via Zoom videos.\n\n“My classes were from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, which was crazy,” Hayakawa recalls. “I was so overwhelmed, and when I went home for the winter break, my parents asked if I was OK because I had lost 30 pounds.”\n\nWhen she returned to campus in the spring, Hayakawa now had to juggle between her softball season and her studies, maintaining a batting average of .377—earning her the team’s batting champion— and a perfect 4.0 GPA.\n\n“It’s easy to manage time, when your time is managed for you,” Hayakawa quips. “I’m all in … all the time.”\n\nAs she completes her final year as a Silversword, Hayakawa fondly reflects back on her time on Kalaepohaku campus, on the softball field, in the labs and with her friends. She already has future plans to attend graduate school, after having turned down a job offer with the FBI field office in Kapolei.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to help the community through criminal justice,” says Hayakawa, who will graduate as summa cum laude, thus achieving her ultimate freshman goal. “I made the right decision to come to Chaminade, not only because of its small class sizes, but because I got to form relationships with my professors and formed new friendships.”\n\nThree Silverswords recognized for their commitment to criminal justice\n\nNow in its 38th year, the Annual TOP COP Award Ceremony honors law enforcement and security professionals from several sectors, including law enforcement, private security, military and non-profit agencies.\n\n“We are excited to be together in the same space and time to celebrate the dedication of our law enforcement and security professionals in the State of Hawaii,” said Law Enforcement and Security Coalition of Hawaii president Jeremiah Pahukula, Jr., during his opening remarks. “Your presence here today demonstrates your commitment to the safety and security of our island home and we are grateful for your support.”\n\nEqually grateful are this year’s Top Cop Scholarship recipients, including Chaminade senior Chasity McKean ’24, who will graduate with a major in Criminal Justice and minor in Psychology. Receiving the ASIS Region 1D Scholarship, the Kapolei native plans on pursuing a career with the Honolulu Police Department.\n\n“My initial plans post-degree is to join HPD and once I get in, work my way up the ladder to become a canine officer,” wrote McKean in her essay outlining her interest in a Criminal Justice degree. “However, I’m still keeping my options open since having a Criminal Justice degree is very broad and there is much I can do with it. I’ve been doing research and applying for internships to get different work experiences within the criminal justice field.”\n\nEarning the Bob Flatting Scholarship was fellow Silversword Benjamin Carlin, who is working towards his Master’s degree in Criminal Justice. The U.S. Army Police Officer aspires to advance from an enlisted soldier to a commissioned officer with the United States Army’s Military Police Corps, which provides expertise in policing, detainment and stability operations in order to enhance security and enable mobility.\n\nAligned with the goals of the U.S. Army’s Military Police Corps, the Law Enforcement and Security Coalition of Hawai‘i adopted the Hawaiian expression of “E Pupukahi,” which holds the symbolic meaning of “working together as one to make Hawai‘i a safe place to live and work.”\n\n“Working with these talented individuals who value the accomplishments of those who protect our communities has been my pleasure,” said Pahukula, Jr. “I look forward to their continued support.”\n\nChaminade senior Alisha Gifford’s lifetime ambition is to serve and protect her community. As this year’s Top Cop Scholarship awardee, Gifford is currently in the selection process of being an intern with HPD. Her longterm goal, however, is to pursue a career with the United States Air Force.\n\nThirty years later, two middle school besties will graduate in ’24\n\nThe last time they graduated was in 1994 from Mililani High School. And when May 2024 comes around, Rita Aponte ’24 and KerryLynn Vea ’24 will again don their caps and gowns, as they prepare to cross the stage of the Waikiki Shell to receive their bachelor’s degrees.\n\nBFFs since high school, Aponte and Vea were able to pursue their university degrees, thanks to Bank of Hawaii’s College Assistance Program (CAP), which allows its employees to get back on the path to obtaining their first four-year undergraduate degree with tuition reimbursement.\n\n“The Bank started this program in 2016, and I started the following year,” says Aponte, Manager of Loan Operations with Bank of Hawaii. “And my bestie, KerryLynn, is also on this journey with me since we both always wanted to get our degrees.”\n\nBoth Aponte and Vea chose to start their families at a young age, hindering them from attending college. The two friends since middle school always had plans to return to university, but family obligations and full-time jobs prevented them from entering the college system.\n\n“I get emotional when I talk about CAP,” says Vea, who was in the credit union industry for 20 years before joining Bank of Hawaii in 2016 and is now its Assistant Vice President-Mortgage Compliance Analyst. “Before CAP, I was resigned not to get my college degree, rationalizing to myself, ‘Oh well, I don’t need a degree since I already have a career.’”\n\nThe American Council of Education estimates that approximately 20 percent of graduate students and six percent of the much larger number of undergraduates receive some financial assistance from their employers to attend school. As many as a third of undergraduates in fields like business and engineering also receive tuition aid, which, on average, covers about one-third of the annual cost paid by post-secondary students.\n\nInitially, when Aponte and Vea enrolled in Bank of Hawaii’s CAP initiative, they were limited to four specific start times a year (January, April, July and October). Today, new applicants have the flexibility to enroll for courses on a monthly basis throughout the year, which is consistent with Chaminade’s online Flex program.\n\n“I’ve worked at credit unions where tuition assistance was always included in the employee manual book, but I never once saw it used,” Vea says. “Bank of Hawaii, on the other hand, vigorously promotes CAP and they champion it, putting funding behind it with no strings attached. The program is a 100 percent benefit to all employees.”\n\nBank of Hawaii’s executives said they needed a partner that understood the Bank’s vision of what they wanted to achieve with its CAP program. However, they also wanted to make sure that the online learning experience was customized to the specific needs of the Bank’s employees since they wanted CAP to be “a real pillar and cornerstone of what Bank of Hawaii is all about.”\n\n“We thought it was not only important to train our employees in specific banking-related issues, but also to help them expand their overall educational base,” says Peter Ho, Bank of Hawaii’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, in a video release. “From an education standpoint, the important thing is to really help shape the individual’s mind and spirit—and that’s what education is all about; that’s what college is all about.”\n\nAlthough, Aponte and Vea didn’t experience the traditional campus setting, they were able to take their classes online, via Chaminade’s Flex program model, allowing students to take one or two courses at a time—or more if they choose—as they work toward their degree. And the pace of coursework rests with them. They can complete online courses in as few as six weeks. Or, they can take their time, wrapping up a course in six months. Flex students are also able to complete courses wherever they are, even on the go.\n\n“It was a real struggle during the holiday season,” Aponte recalls. “Even when we went on vacation to Disney World, algebra came along with me.”\n\nThe Flex Online Undergraduate program is WSCUC-accredited (WASC Senior College and University Commission) and has a broad range of study disciplines, including business administration, criminology and criminal justice, historical and political studies, education and psychology. It is designed with working adults in mind, distancing itself from rigid term schedules and due dates to give students the flexibility they need to achieve a work-life-school balance and make progress toward reaching their goals.\n\n“I started at Leeward Community College for a semester and a half, but scheduling was really difficult,” Vea says. “I just couldn’t do it all with a full-time job, a family and attending classes; it was a lot.”\n\nNor could Aponte.\n\n“I didn’t think a college degree was in the books for me,” Aponte asserts. “It was always nagging at me to get my bachelor’s, but I used time and cost as excuses not to pursue it. And now I’m motivated to finish this and I can’t wait.”\n\nThirty years will have elapsed by the time Aponte and Vea attain their bachelor’s degree, and through the three decades, they’ve raised families, enjoyed successful careers and supported each other through both good times and bad.\n\n“Getting the bachelor’s degree with Rita couldn’t get any better,” Vea says. “I always say I’m the Yin because I’m more subdued and quieter, and she’s the Yang because she’s more outgoing and vocal. We might be opposites, but through this college process, we’ve depended on each other and have been each other’s greatest cheerleader.”\n\nFreshman and Hawaii Island native Shalei Parong was among a throng of incoming students who moved into the Hale Pohaku co-ed dormitory on August 17. Meanwhile, after attending the freshman Apo Haumana Retreat, Gavin Ritcheson, Chase Murray and Kanden Yamada bonded and became instant friends.\n\n“It was a fun retreat,” said Yamada of Apo Haumana. “We learned more about Chaminade’s mission, Hawaii’s culture, and we met with our new faculty mentors. We also sang a lot of karaoke., too”\n\nThis year, Chaminade University welcomed one of its largest incoming classes in recent history. The projected number of new students amounts to 1,572 undergraduate students and 642 graduate students for a total of 2,214 student enrollment. (The official final count is due Oct. 1.) The incoming class of freshmen and transfer students added up to 481, many of whom attended the New Student Orientation.\n\nThis Fall, the University also noted a 34 percent increase in new students from Hawaii, thanks in large part to the Hawaiʻi Guarantee initiative, which makes tuition for local Hawaiʻi freshmen on par with tuition at UH Manoa.\n\n“It’s gratifying to see so many local high school graduates and others selecting Chaminade as the institute to pursue their higher education,” said Chaminade University President Dr. Lynn Babington. “We also have the highest graduation rate of Hawaii colleges, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, and that’s something of which we’re really proud.”\n\nAlso of note, 285 students live in university residence halls, with nine resident assistants guiding their dormitory experience that includes activities, and all safety and security procedures.\n\n“We enforce the dorm rules,” said Kieffer Hall resident assistants Mady Jensen ’26 and Epifana Petelo ’23, as they waited to check in incoming students. “We make sure that everyone abides by the curfews and other regulations.”\n\nNew this year is Chaminade’s Major and Minor in the Sport and Event Management (SEM) program within the School of Business and Communication. It is the first college program of its kind in Hawaii, according to SEM professor Wendy Lam, Ph.D. Students will take an interdisciplinary approach to build their foundation of knowledge with courses in sports business administration, sports psychology, sustainability, law, ethics and communications.\n\n“Sports programs generate tremendous value to both our communities and Hawaii’s economy,” said Lam, Associate Professor of Business. “The future of the school is mission-focused, practical and exciting.”\n\nNew graduate programs include the Education Specialist in School Psychology (EdS); Doctor of Education in Organizational Leadership for Adaptation and Change (EdD–Sustainability Leadership concentration; Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)–BSN-DNP Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP) certificate; and the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)–Post-Doctor Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP) Certificate.\n\nIn addition to more than 60 majors and minors, the University’s Office of Student Engagement offers more than 30 active student clubs for students to join.\n\n“Looking ahead, we have an exciting year planned, and I am grateful in advance for all of the hard work and commitment of our faculty and staff members,” Babington said. “We are always here for our students.”"
