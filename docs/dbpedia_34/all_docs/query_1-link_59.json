        "text": "Merrily We Roll Along\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023 - JULY 2024\n\nIT’S THE BEST THING THAT EVER COULD HAVE HAPPENED!\n\nFollowing sold-out runs in London and at the New York Theatre Workshop, Merrily We Roll Along is back on Broadway — and with Maria Friedman’s widely acclaimed production, it is poised at last to take its place in the pantheon of great American musicals. Featuring one of Sondheim's most celebrated and personal scores, and moving backwards in time, Merrily charts the turbulent relationship between three lifelong friends — played by Daniel Radcliffe, Jonathan Groff, and Lindsay Mendez — and traces every milestone of their lives for nearly two decades as they navigate success, show business and unbreakable bonds.\n\nWINNER of 4 TONY AWARDS - including Best Revival, Best Leading Actor in a Musical, and Best Supporting Actor in a Musical.\n\nLegacy: An Evening with Maria Friedman and Friends\n\nMARCH 4, 2024\n\nFour-time Olivier Award winner and director of this season’s critically acclaimed Broadway revival of Merrily We Roll Along, Maria Friedman has crafted a special one-night-only benefit concert, with friends old and new.\n\nLegacy: An Evening with Maria Friedman & Friends celebrates the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand, three titans of 20th century musical theater. A universally praised interpreter of their works, Friedman performed with Sondheim, Hamlisch and Legrand multiple times throughout her career.\n\nThis unique theatrical event will see her showcase many of their greatest hits with entertaining and personal memories that will make this evening a night to remember.\n\nThe evening benefits Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, the Stephen Sondheim Foundation and The Marvin Hamlisch International Music Awards.\n\nAlex Edelman's Just For Us\n\nJUNE 22, 2023 - AUGUST 19, 2023\n\nIn the wake of a string of anti-Semitic threats pointed in his direction online, standup comic Alex Edelman decides to go straight to the source; specifically, Queens, where he covertly attends a meeting of White Nationalists and comes face-to-face with the people behind the keyboards. What happens next forms the backbone of the shockingly relevant, utterly hilarious, and only moderately perspirant stories that comprise JUST FOR US.\n\nExpertly crafted by one of comedy’s most distinctive voices, this singular theatrical experience is an exploration of identity and our collective capacity for empathy — oh, and it’s also “belly-laugh funny!” (The New York Times).\n\nDeath of a Salesman\n\nSEPTEMBER 17, 2022 – JANUARY 15, 2023\n\nFollowing a critically acclaimed run in London, this vibrant and timely production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman came to Broadway. Olivier Award nominee Wendell Pierce and Olivier Award winner and 2022 Tony® nominee Sharon D Clarke reprised their roles as Willy and Linda Loman in a revival told – for the first time on Broadway – from the perspective of an African American family. A new cast of supporting actors joined the production in New York, led by Tony winner André De Shields and Khris Davis. Directed by Miranda Cromwell – who won an Olivier Award alongside co-director Marianne Elliott for the West End and Young Vic productions – this powerful interpretation of Miller’s classic drama illuminates the dark underbelly of the American Dream and its elusive promise of equality and opportunity for all. Don’t miss the brilliantly reimagined revival The New York Times called “vital and electrifying.”\n\nNeil Simon's Plaza Suite\n\nFEBRUARY 25 – JULY 10, 2022\n\nTwo-time Tony Award winner Matthew Broderick and two-time Emmy Award winner Sarah Jessica Parker returned to Broadway together in the classic Neil Simon comedy Plaza Suite. Directed by Tony Award winner John Benjamin Hickey, this uproarious and piercing look at love and marriage came to Hudson Theatre for a limited engagement. Two world-class actors played three hilarious couples in a Broadway classic from a legendary playwright and Pulitzer Prize winner.\n\nKaren and Sam are a long-married pair whose relationship may be headed for an early checkout. Muriel and Jesse are former high school sweethearts who seem destined for an extended stay. And Norma and Roy are the mother and father of the bride, ready to celebrate their daughter’s nuptials — if only they can get her out of the bathroom.\n\nTony winner JOHN BENJAMIN HICKEY leads a Tony-winning creative team, including JOHN LEE BEATTY (sets), JANE GREENWOOD (costumes), BRIAN MacDEVITT (lighting), SCOTT LEHRER (sound), TOM WATSON (wigs) and MARC SHAIMAN (music).\n\nDavid Byrne's American Utopia\n\nOCTOBER 4, 2019 – FEBRUARY 16, 2020\n\nIn American Utopia, Talking Heads superstar David Byrne was joined by 11 diverse musicians from around the globe in a “knockout theatrical concert, honoring the pleasures of music, dance and song as collective celebration” (The Hollywood Reporter). Featuring “altogether astonishing choreography by Annie-B Parson” (The New York Times), with Tony-nominated Alex Timbers (director of Moulin Rouge! The Musical) serving as production consultant, it’s “an artistically stunning tour de force” (Variety) brimming with “total, buoyant joy” (New York Magazine). Christine Amanpour said, “It’s all about hope and connection between people. And it rocks.”\n\nAcademy Award®-winning director Spike Lee’s acclaimed filmed version of David Byrne’s American Utopia made its world premiere opening the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival and is currently streaming on HBO Max. The film has been called “a life-affirming, euphoria-producing, soul-energizing sing-along protest film that’s asking us to rise up against our own complacency” (IndieWire) and “an all-time-great concert film” (Vanity Fair). The A.V. Club said, “David Byrne and Spike Lee found the spectacle in the performers simply performing.”\n\nNonesuch Records released both the original 2018 American Utopia album, which inspired the Broadway show, as well as the cast album for David Byrne’s American Utopia, with music and lyrics by David Byrne. Both albums are available digitally and on vinyl and CD: the cast album here, the original album here.\n\nThe show’s design team included Rob Sinclair (lighting) and Pete Keppler (sound). Karl Mansfield and Mauro Refosco were Musical Directors. Choreography and Musical Staging was by Annie-B Parson. Alex Timbers served as Production Consultant.\n\nIan McKellen On Stage\n\nNOVEMBER 5, 2019\n\n“This year I’ve been having the time of my life, touring my new show across the UK. Now it will be an extra treat to return to Broadway, 50 years after my debut in NYC, especially as it will benefit the inspirational work of Only Make Believe. Please come and help me celebrate!”\n\n– Ian McKellen\n\nDirected By Sean Mathias\n\nSea Wall / A Life\n\nJULY 26 – SEPTEMBER 29, 2019\n\nMeet Alex, a photographer on a holiday with his family in the south of France. Meet Abe, a music producer with a baby on the way. Two men – both fathers, husbands, and sons – take us on a journey you will never forget.\n\nThe finest actors of their generation, Academy Award® nominee Jake Gyllenhaal (Sunday In The Park With George) and Tony Award® nominee Tom Sturridge (1984), had audiences roaring to their feet at the sold-out engagement at The Public Theater. Now Sea Wall/A Life, from the visionary creative team behind The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Constellations and A Doll’s House, comes to Broadway.\n\nHead Over Heels\n\nJUNE 23, 2018 – JANUARY 6, 2019\n\nHead Over Heels is the bold and fierce new musical comedy from the visionaries that rocked Broadway with Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Avenue Q and Spring Awakening.\n\nSet to the iconic music of the 1980’s all-female rock band The Go-Go’s, it includes the hit songs “We Got the Beat,” “Our Lips Are Sealed,” “Vacation,” Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven is a Place on Earth,” and many more!\n\nIt’s a hilarious and sexy celebration of love in all its infinite varieties, told through the story of a royal family that must embark on an extravagant journey to save their beloved kingdom and find love and acceptance.\n\nThe Original Broadway Cast Recording, a 20-track album featuring a score comprised of hit songs from the all-female ’80s pop band The Go-Go’s, is now available to purchase and stream.\n\nDGF:Toasts Stephen Schwartz's 70th Birthday\n\nAPRIL 23, 2018\n\nJoin the Dramatists Guild Foundation on April 23 at the Hudson Theatre as we celebrate Stephen Schwartz’s 70th Birthday with a star-filled concert dedicated to Stephen and his beloved songs, stories, and legacy.

Ambition and deception, sex, betrayal and blackmail: It’s all here, wrapped up in a stylish package slickly directed by Pam MacKinnon.’’ – Charles Isherwood, Broadway News\n\nAcademy Award nominee Uma Thurman stars in The Parisian Woman, a new play written by Academy Award and Emmy Award nominee Beau Willimon (“House of Cards”) and directed by Tony Award® winner Pam MacKinnon (Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?).\n\nThe Parisian Woman is set in Washington, D.C., where powerful friends are the only kind worth having, especially after the 2016 election. At the center is Chloe (Uma Thurman), a socialite armed with charm and wit, coming to terms with politics, her past, her marriage and an uncertain future. Dark humor and drama collide at this pivotal moment in Chloe’s life, and in our nation’s, when the truth isn’t obvious and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Thurman, the cast of The Parisian Woman also stars Josh Lucas (Sweet Home Alabama), Marton Csokas (The Lord of the Rings), Tony Award® nominee Phillipa Soo (Hamilton), and Tony Award® winner Blair Brown.\n\nSunday in the Park with George\n\nFEBRUARY 11 – APRIL 23, 2017\n\nJake Gyllenhaal and Tony® winner Annaleigh Ashford opened Broadway’s new Hudson Theatre in the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine Pulitzer Price-winning masterpiece Sunday In the Park with George.

His searing theatrical presence and unwavering focusseemsto consume and illuminate the dark. He has a voice of richly flexible timbre that confidently elicits the most delicate shades of passion and despair.” – Ben Brantley, The New York Times\n\n“The luminous AnnaleighAshford delivers a performance with both gorgeous precision and spontaneous warmth matched by her eloquent singing.” – Ben Brantley, The New York Times"
