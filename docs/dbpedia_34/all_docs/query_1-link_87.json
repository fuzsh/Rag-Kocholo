        "text": "The 1980s were an eclectic and revolutionary era for music as an art form. From pop, rock, heavy metal, hip-hop and electronic music, the sheer number of genres that have blossomed out of the 80s is a testament to the phenomenally talented and ingenious artists to come out of the decade. Furthermore, several of these artists have remained relevant throughout the following decades and have continued to make an impact on pop culture today.\n\nTop 80s Bands and Artists\n\nWhether it’s in TV, Film or contemporary music, the sound of the 80s can be heard resonating throughout the modern entertainment industry, and the adoration for this era is only growing with new generations as they rediscover music through social media and creative outlets like TikTok. With that being said, the following list was constructed after considering a wide array of popularized 80s artists. Each of these bands and artists saw significant success and released a majority of their career defining work during the 1980s.\n\n20. Slayer\n\nAs pioneers of extreme music, the thrash metal giants have since become one of the most influential and renown metal acts to come out of the 1980s. Shaping the sonic landscape for extreme metal with albums Hell Awaits, Reign in Blood and South of Heaven, Slayer’s output in the 80s contributed heavily to one metal’s most significant eras.\n\nMembers Tom Araya, Kerry King, Dave Lombardo, and Jeff Hanneman would go on to become one of metal’s most cherished bands in the following decades, and ever since their influence can be heard in all corners of hardcore and metal music.\n\n19. Tears for Fears\n\nEnglish duo Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal formed what was unquestionably one of the most successful and recognizable acts from the 80s. Tears for Fears knack for writing anthemic pop-rock hits saw them flourish throughout decade and beyond, with singles “Shout” and “Everybody Wants to Rule The World” becoming synonymous with greatest hits from decade.\n\nThe band’s 1985 LP Songs From The Big Chair saw many of the band’s chart topping singles, and today it’s largely regarded as the groups defining and most highly regarded work. Both Smith and Orzabal are still active and performing under Tears for Fears, though the band is far less focused on making new music.\n\n18. The Cure\n\nAs one of the most prolific bands during the 1980s, The Cure helped shape an entire sub-culture of goth-rock as well as a thriving adoration for alternative music. Frontman Robert Smith, the band’s most constant member, injected a mix of post-punk and catchy pop melodies into the band’s early work with albums Faith, Pornography and The Top.\n\nWith the release of Disintegration in 1989, The Cure went from having mainstream success to becoming a household name. Moreover, the band’s legacy would continue to carry on throughout the coming decades with hit singles like “Friday I’m In Love,” further lifting the band into mainstream success. The Cure is still actively performing and touring to sold out arenas across the globe, though they’ve not recorded or released new music since 2008’s 4:13 Dream.\n\n17. Def Leppard\n\nAs a part of the 80s new wave of British heavy metal, Def Leppard saw early success in the decade with their spin on the hard rock and heavy metal genres. However, after taking a more commercial and pop approach on 1983’s Pyromania and 1987’s Hysteria, Def Leppard grew into one of the most accomplished hard rock acts from the decade.\n\nJoe Elliot, Phil Collen, Rick Allen, Rick Savage and Vivian Campbell have since become one of the most recognized rock acts in history, with hits “Rock Of Ages,” “Pour Some Sugar On Me,” and “Photograph” still resonating throughout the mainstream. The success of the Def Leppard’s recent stadium tours has only shown the band’s relevancy is far from dwindling, especially as new generations continue to discover their classic albums.\n\n16. U2\n\nEventually taking the reins of the 1980s alternative rock scene, the Dublin post-punk outfit U2 grew from small beginnings to become a world wide sensation in the 90s and beyond. Albums War, The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree were all essential to the band’s mainstream success throughout the decade, but furthermore these albums helped shape an entirely new pop-rock sonic allure. Hits song “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” “Pride,” “With Or Without You” not only showcase this style, but also the band’s now iconic charismatic and thought provoking sonic atmosphere.\n\nBono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. have brought an undeniably unique personality to rock music, and there musical output during the 80’s has undoubtedly contributed to them becoming one of the most successful rock acts in history.\n\n15. Guns N’ Roses\n\nAs pioneers of chaotic hard hitting anthemic rock, Guns N’ Roses helped to build the foundation for arena rock and contemporary hard rock throughout the mid-80s. 1987’s Appetite For Destruction was the powerhouse album that launched the band into rock stardom, and ever since they’ve been regarded as all time greats of rock music.\n\nNearly 40 years later songs “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” “Welcome To The Jungle” and “Paradise City” are still resonating with new generations and the larger popular music crowd. While most of GNR’s most recognizable hits came out of the 1980s, the Los Angeles outfit has remained relevant throughout recent years and are actively performing to their millions of fans across the globe.\n\n14. Whitney Houston\n\nAs an icon of American contemporary music, Whitney Houston’s breakout success in the 80s was pivotal in her rise to mainstream stardom. The singer’s early records Whitney Houston and Whitney Dancin’ Special showed high promise for her unique talents as a pop singer. However, with 1987’s Whitney, which featured the smash hit “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),” Houston managed to captivate the 80s pop-culture zeitgeist and further establish herself as one of most influential music acts of the decade.\n\nSince her death in 2012, Whitney Houston’s legacy has continued to be revered for her sheer talent and profound musical works throughout her 25 years in the industry.\n\n13. Ozzy Osbourne\n\nAfter building the foundation to his career with Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne’s solo career was no less significant or monumental during the 80s. The singer’s 1980 debut with Blizzard of Ozz floored audiences at the time for his unique twist on heavy metal songwriting as well as his outlandish rock n’ roll persona.\n\nPaired with the phenomenal talent of Randy Rhodes, Jake E. Lee, and later Zakk Wylde, Ozzy Osbourne would go on to become the most recognized and successful solo act in heavy music. Despite retiring from live performance, Osbourne has remained relevant within the modern music industry collaborating with artists like Post Malone and producer Andrew Watt on his most recent acclaimed and Grammy winning records.\n\n12. Iron Maiden\n\nSingle-handedly shaping the metal sub-genres that sprouted from the 80s and beyond, the decade was no less defining for one of metal’s most beloved acts. Iron Maiden dominated the decade’s hard rock and metal scenes with their revolutionary take on guitar leads, powerful choruses and visceral imagery.\n\nThe English outfit consisting of Steve Harris, Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, Nicko McBrain and Bruce Dickinson embodied an aesthetic and sonic appeal that has forever been molded into rock and heavy music.\n\nAlbums The Number of the Beast, Powerslave and Somewhere In Time were essential pillars to the band’s long sustaining success, which has since blossomed into a metal empire that’s continued to reel in legions of fans across the globe.\n\n11. Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers\n\nAs one of the most notable and renowned songwriters of contemporary American music, Tom Petty, both his solo career and career with The Heartbreakers, had one of the most lasting impressions throughout the 80s. While his career got it’s start in the mid-70s, Petty’s critical success with albums Southern Accents and his debut solo album Full Moon Fever further propelled him to new and uncharted territory.\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers would continued to perform and release music in the following decades up until Petty’s death in 2017.\n\n10. N.W.A.\n\nArguably the supergroup that helped sculpt and reimagine rap music production and songwriting as we know it today, N.W.A’s short spanning career in the mid-80s was nothing short of revolutionary. Ice-Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella, MC Ren and (briefly) Arabian Prince brought soul, attitude, and provocative social issues to the forefront of hip-hop with their 1988 debut, Straight Outta Compton.\n\nWith hit’s “F**k Tha Police,” “Straight Outta Compton” and “Gangsta Gangsta” N.W.A. turned their short-lived career into a legacy that’s infected every corner of modern rap, hip-hop and aggressive music genres. While the group was only active up until the early 90’s, the career’s of Dr. Dre and Ice-Cube have carried over into the following decades and made a monumental impact on the modern music industry.\n\n9. Tina Turner\n\nThere’s a reason why Tina Turner has been dubbed the “Queen of Rock ‘n Roll.” Her powerful amalgamation of R&B, rock and soul music brought her to the forefront of the 80s popular music scene, along with her innate ability to captivate audiences with her mesmerizing voice.\n\nWith hits “What’s Love Got to Do with It,” “The Best” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” her presence and influence throughout the 80s and beyond was undeniably massive. Since her passing in 2023, Turner’s legacy has only continued to be admired and seen with great prestige amongst aspiring artists and the greater music industry.\n\n8. Van Halen\n\nThe band that largely embodied the sound of the 1980s rock scene, Van Halen were one of the most sensational and influential rock acts at the time. Brothers Alex and Eddie Van Halen teamed up with frontman David Lee Roth and bassist Michael Anthony in the early 70s, and following their debut album in 1978, the band would go from taking over L.A.’s Sunset Strip to becoming one of the most iconic arena rock acts in history.\n\nHits such as “Panama,” “Unchained,” “Hot For Teacher” and “Jump” helped launch Van Halen into mainstream popularity, aided by the band’s unrelenting musicianship and charming demeanor. While the 80s were the most iconic years for the band, the success of Van Halen would carry on up throughout the 90s and early 2000s. Following the death of guitar legend Eddie Van Halen in 2020, the band officially retired and shut down all prospect of future Van Halen tours.\n\n7. The Police\n\nThe English rock trio consisting of Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers have become one of the most popularized groups in history for their widely recognizable sonic concoction of pop-rock, reggae and new age styles. Despite the band seeing success throughout the late 70s, The Police saw new levels of stardom during the 1980s with albums Zenyatta Mondatta, Ghost in the Machine and Synchronicity.\n\nHit songs “Message In A Bottle,” “Every Breath You Take” and “Don’t Stand So Close To Me” are still the gold standard for soft-rock songwriting, and the band is largely recognized for having one of the most exceptional rhythm sections in rock. While The Police are no longer actively performing or making music, the individual members of the band are still performing and working on music projects.\n\n6. Bruce Springsteen\n\nAfter breaking out in the mid-70s as one of America’s most promising songwriters, Bruce Springsteen would see his biggest stride throughout the 80s. The New Jersey native’s approach to the singer-songwriter genre was as innovative as it was impactful at the time.\n\nAlbums The River, Nebraska and Born In The U.S.A. have seemingly carved their place as some of the most cherished works of contemporary American singer-songwriter music. Not to mention, hits “I’m On Fire,” “Dancing In The Dark” and “Born In The U.S.A.” have become some of the most recognizable anthems of Springsteen’s career. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are still actively performing and creating music together. His latest LP Only The Strong Survive was released in 2022.\n\n5. Depeche Mode\n\nMuch of new wave and modern music production has been influenced by the electro-alternative giants Depeche Mode. Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke crafted a sonic allure unlike any other in the 1980s, and as a result of the band’s career being so prolific throughout the decade, they’ve grown into one of most acclaimed musical acts in history.\n\nNotable hits including “Personal Jesus,” “Just Can’t Get Enough” and “Never Let Me Down Again” defined much of the synthetic sounds of the 80s, which has since been revitalized in much of modern music production. Dave Gahan and Martin Gore are still active and performing as Depeche Mode.\n\n4. Madonna\n\nAs one of pop music’s most iconic stars, Madonna helped to define the 80s and much of the musical renaissance that was occurring at the time. Through her use of proactive imagery and themes, not to mention her brilliant musicianship, Madonna solidified herself as one of pop music’s most accomplished artists throughout the decades to come.\n\nHer hit songs throughout the 80s including “Like a Virgin,” “La Isla Bonita” and “Material Girl” helped build the foundation to her lustrous career, and since then she’s only continued to grow and remain relevant within the modern music industry.\n\n3. Metallica\n\nStanding as quite possibly the single biggest metal band to come out of the 80s, Metallica’s career and influence on modern rock has been nothing short of gargantuan. Having one of the most revered musical outputs with albums Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets and …And Justice For All, Metallica is largely viewed as the all-time great of metal for their work throughout this decade.\n\nFurthermore, the 80s were only the start of the band dominating the metal genre. In the decades to follow, Metallica would become even more popularized with their later works and commercial investments, and today they’ve cultivated a multi-generational fanbase that still insists upon their revered status.\n\n2. Prince\n\nRedefining both pop and rock n’ roll music, Prince was one of the most prolific and renown artists of the 1980s. Starting his solo career in 1978, Prince would see the breakout of his success with albums Dirty Mind, Purple Rain and Around The World In A Day, all of which would instill a reverence for Prince as one of the all time greatest pop-rock artists.\n\nWith hits “Let’s Go Crazy,” “When Doves Cry” and “Kiss,” Prince created an infectious and beautifully provocative sound that’s since inspired a plethora of artists and musicians that’ve followed in his footsteps. From 1978 to 2015 Prince would go on to release 39 studio albums and win several Grammy awards. Following his death in 2017, Prince posthumously released his final 40th studio in 2021, Welcome 2 America.\n\n1. Michael Jackson\n\nAfter getting his start in 1964 alongside his siblings in the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson would go on to have a solo career that’s yet to be matched by any other like-minded pop artist. With 1982’s Thriller and 1987’s Bad, Jackson became one of the most decorated artists in history, and he’s without a doubt the most popularized and influential artist to spring from the 1980s.\n\nFrom hits “Beat It,” “Billie Jean,” “Man in the Mirror” and “Thriller,” Jackson has not only revolutionized pop music production and songwriting but established a precedent for the sheer talent required to become a pop-music legend. Leading up to his death in 2009, Jackson would go on to release ten studio albums throughout his career with 2001’s Invincible being his final.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe artists and bands listed above are reflective of the most innovative and groundbreaking music to come out of the 1980s. Additionally, each of these artists have revolutionized the industry and their respective genres to a great extent, and all while remaining relevant through the lens of today’s culture.\n\nThere are a countless number of legendary 80s bands and artists to consider for a list of this nature. However, these artists in particular achieved a great deal of success whether through album sales, breaking musical boundaries, or capturing the attention of pop-culture throughout the decade."
