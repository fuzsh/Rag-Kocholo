It doesn’t have the weight and heft and sheer animal power of Beethoven, it’s much lighter but the strangeness is implied by what could be termed its otherworldliness. But then one might say that the ‘strangeness’ is what is the key thing in virtually all important art. Like I said before, it makes you ask why had no one done this before and I guess in Schubert’s case it was because he was waiting for Beethoven to come along and feed him the inspiration."
