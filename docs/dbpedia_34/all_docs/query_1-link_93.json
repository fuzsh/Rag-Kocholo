        "text": "Steel Pulse formed in 1975 and is looked at as one of the most important British reggae bands. The band was known for their Rastafarian and protest-minded beliefs. The band’s music consists of an upbeat reggae sound with elements of Latin and Jazz music. Despite the band’s sound varying from punk music, their music was well received by the punk community in the UK and they toured with well-regarded punk acts such as The Stranglers and XTC.\n\nEventually the band started to tour with bands closer to their style of music like Burning Spear. The band soon caught the attention of Island Records, who signed them to a record deal. Their debut album “Handsworth Revolution” was released in 1978 and was considered a milestone album for the growth of British reggae. The album was a great critical and commercial success. The album reached the No. 9 position on the British charts and contained the singles “Ku Klux Klan” and “Prodigal Son”. The success of the album gained the band an opening slot on Bob Marley’s tour as well as gave the band an opportunity to headline their own shows.\n\nAfter the band released two more successful albums, “Tribute to the Martyrs” in 1979 and “Caught You” in 1980, they parted ways with Island Records and signed a deal with Elektra Records. The group released their album “True Democracy” in 1982, which showed the band returning to more political roots as well as a more light-hearted sound. The album peaked on the Billboard’s Top Pop Albums chart and contained the single “Worth His Weight In Gold (Rally Round)”. The band continued with their political tone in their music with the release of their 1984 album “Earth Crisis”.\n\nFor the band’s next album Island Records urged Steel Pulse to take a more pop oriented direction with their next release. In 1986 the group released their album “Babylon the Bandit”, which was well received critically and commercially. The album contained the hit single “Not King James Version” and received the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. In 1988 the band switched labels and released their album “State of Emergency” through MCA Records. The album was more advanced in production quality compared to the band’s previous albums and blended rap elements with reggae. The band’s 1991 album “Victims” followed in the same style as the band’s previous album and gained them a Grammy nomination in the Best Reggae Album category.\n\nIn 1997 the band released the album “Rage and Fury”. The album is considered one of the band’s politically heaviest albums with songs like “The Real Terrorist” and “Black and Proud”. The album was also well received, reaching the No. 4 spot on the Billboard Top Reggae Album chart as well as receiving a Grammy nomination. The band’s 2004 album “African Holocaust” was also well received and contained guest appearances by Damian Marley and Capleton as well as a cover song of Bob Dylan’s “George Jackson”.\n\nSteel Pulse’s music has also appeared in several films. The band contributed the song “I Can’t Stand it” to Spike Lee’s film “Do The Right Thing”. Steel Pulse is also well renowned for their live performances and has appeared at many notable reggae festivals such as Reggae Sunsplash USA, Jamaican Sunsplash, and Northern California annual Reggae on the River Festival."
