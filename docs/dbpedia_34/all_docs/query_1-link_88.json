        "text": "May is National Bike Month in the United States, a time to celebrate biking as transportation, as recreation, and as an important part of one’s wellbeing. Events promoting bicycling as a form of transport have already been taking place, notably National Walk Bike and Roll to School Day, which a number of Minnesota schools observed last Wednesday.\n\nThis week, May 13 to 19, is Bike To Work Week, which culminates in Bike to Work Day this Friday, May 17. Commuters are asked to consider cycling as an option for getting to and from work, as it saves on vehicle fuel, maintenance and parking costs; is good for the environment; and is good for one’s health. National Bike Month is championed by the League of American Bicyclists, an organization founded in 1880 “to create a bicycle-friendly America for Everyone, improving lives and strengthening communities through bicycling.” Here in Minnesota, the city of Minneapolis has long enjoyed a reputation as a bicycle-friendly city, and other cities including St. Paul are increasing bike lanes and other bicycle-friendly infrastructure.\n\nMany musicians have long embraced the benefits of bicycling or the role of bicycles in our lives. As a result, there are a number of songs about riding a bike or that reference bicycles in some way. Let’s get into the spirit of the week by hearing some of that music today.\n\nSo for today’s 9:30 Coffee Break, what songs about bicycles or bicycling do you want to hear?\n\nRespond with your song ideas in the comments below.\n\nHave an idea for a Coffee Break topic?
