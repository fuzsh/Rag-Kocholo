        "text": "Leonard Bernstein conducting a cast that includes Kiri Te Kanawa, Jessye Norman, Jose Carreras and Tatiana Troyanos would be starry enough for any opera. In fact, they will appear in a Deutsche Grammophon recording of Mr. Bernstein's hit musical, ''West Side Story,'' being recorded in Manhattan this week and due for release next September.\n\nHow did such a remarkable convergence of operatic talent and Broadway come about, and what will it sound like? Mr. Bernstein and Deutsche Grammophon officials provided some answers this week, and a recording session Wednesday at the midtown RCA Studios offered a hint of promising results.\n\n''West Side Story,'' a gang-war reworking of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' ran for 724 performances on Broadway starting in 1957, and received even wider distribution with the 1961 movie version, starring Natalie Wood, which won an Academy Award for best film.\n\n''When Deutsche Grammophon said they wanted to record 'West Side Story,' I said, 'Oh, no, not again,' '' recalled Mr. Bernstein, wolfing an order of sushi in a side room between sessions. ''They pointed out that I had never done it - never recorded it, never conducted it in the theater.''\n\n'Difficult to Cast'\n\nThe idea to use opera singers apparently evolved slowly.\n\n'' 'West Side Story' is very difficult to cast,'' Mr. Bernstein explained. ''It's hard to find people who can dance, sing and act - and look 17 years old. When I knew we were going to have a recording, I decided to go for sound. For the first time in my life, we can have exactly the singers we want.''\n\nMiss Te Kanawa, the New Zealand soprano, was the first to be signed up. ''I couldn't believe it,'' the singer recalled yesterday. ''This was music I'd grown up with, music I'd always wanted to sing.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
