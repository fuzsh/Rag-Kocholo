        "text": "K raftwerk push all the right buttons.\n\nPerfectly poised, perfectly noised,\n\nthey have arguably caused the\n\ngreatest paradigm shift in popular\n\nmusic since the Beatles, and that includes\n\npunk. From their private Kling Klang studio,\n\nhidden away in Düsseldorf, Germany, they\n\nhave manufactured paeans to motorways and\n\ncalculators, home computers and state-of-theart\n\nbicycles, in a deadpan celebration of a\n\ntechnological utopia.\n\nThe most readily traceable inspirations for\n\ntheir music were the avant-garde composer\n\nKarlheinz Stockhausen, whose theories they\n\nappropriated and built upon for their own concept\n\nof ‘elektronisch Volkmusik’ (electronic folk\n\nmusic) and artist Joseph Beuys, one the most\n\nimportant figures in post-War German art.\n\nKraftwerk’s own music went on to refine and\n\nredefine pop: they have been the catalyst for a\n\nwhole a hard-drive full of keyboard-based musical\n\ngenres, from euro-disco to house and techno,\n\nto synth-pop and electronica.\n\nKraftwerk consists of mainstays Ralf Hütter\n\nand Florian Schneider-Eselben (usually known\n\nmerely as Florian Schneider) and a series of\n\nmusical sub-contractors. Without them, there\n\nwould have been no ‘Blue Monday’, ‘Are\n\n‘Friends’ Electric?’, ‘West End Girls’, ‘Sweet\n\nDreams (Are Made Of This)’, ‘Bootylicious’ or\n\n‘Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box’.\n\nWithout Autobahn, Pocket Calculator and Metal\n\nOn Metal, everyone from Madonna, Björk and\n\nMoby, to Daft Punk, Boards Of Canada and\n\nU2 would have been unable to make the music\n\nthat they did.\n\nKraftwerk’s influence even extends beyond\n\nthe musical and artistic — the German musicmakers\n\nadjusted, altered and modified our\n\nresponses to technology itself. More, they created\n\nthe most breathtakingly beautiful music with\n\nthe exactitude of the systems analyst, the economy\n\nof the Japanese haiku artist and the aethetic\n\neconomy of modernist architecture.\n\nGiven that it’s near-impossible to envisage\n\nlate 20th Century pop music untouched by\n\nKraftwerk (with their innate understanding of\n\ntechnology and modernity), the group emerged\n\nfrom unexpected backgrounds. Ralf Hütter and\n\nFlorian Schneider first met at a jazz and improvisation\n\ncourse organised by the Düsseldorf\n\nConservatory in the late 60s. Although they\n\nwere to subsequently harness the power of\n\nmusic-making machines, they initially played\n\norgan and flute and, apparently, preferred\n\navant-garde classical recitals to conventional\n\ngigs. Prior to the assembly of Kraftwerk, the\n\nduo performed together with three collaborators\n\nas Organisation. And like many in\n\nDüsseldorf, they played the city’s universities\n\nand galleries. The group — which also included\n\nBasil Hammoundi (glockenspiel, congas, gong,\n\nmusical box, bongos, voice), Butch Hauf (bass,\n\nshcky tube, bells, plastic hammer), and Fred\n\nMonicks (drums, bongos, maracas, cowbell,\n\ntambourine) — recorded an album, Tone Float,\n\nwhich consists of droney percussive pieces, in\n\nwhich the organ, flute and electronic instruments\n\nwere pushed to the fore. The album was\n\nonly issued in the UK in 1970 on RCA Victor\n\nbut failed to garner any commercial interest and\n\nthe band were soon dropped. It has yet to\n\nreceive a legitimate CD reissue, although its\n\ncosmic strangeness means that this piece of\n\nultra-rare vinyl has been bootlegged several\n\ntimes. “I don’t remember (it) so well,” Florian\n\nSchneider has since conveniently deflected.\n\nRalf Hütter has attributed the beginning of\n\nKraftwerk proper to the creation of the Kling\n\nKlang studio in 1970 — although it wasn’t\n\nactually so named until 1976. The group\n\nclaimed that it was their walk-in instrument:\n\n“It’s our little laboratory, our toy room,” Hütter\n\ntold author Pascal Bussy for his book Man,\n\nMachine And Music. Eventually, from this\n\n“yellowish building, overlooking a cheapish\n\nhotel with a Turkish grocery nearby, Kraftwerk\n\nwould replace guitars and drums with synthesiser\n\npulses and programmed beats, recalibrating\n\npop music forever.\n\nSigning to Philips, and its progressive rock\n\nimprint Vertigo in the UK, Kraftwerk set about\n\nrecording an album that was as far away as it\n\nwas possible to get from the sounds being\n\nproduced by Vertigo lablemates such as\n\nManfred Mann’s Earth Band and Black\n\nSabbath. Packaged in a sleeve featuring an\n\niconic, minimalistic image of a traffic cone,\n\nKraftwerk’s eponymous debut drew on musique\n\nconcrète, organ tone clusters, and flute feedback.\n\nRecorded with programmer Andreas\n\nHohman and drummer Klaus Dinger, and\n\napparently inspired by the Stooges and the\n\nMC5, as well as Stockhausen, the album consists\n\nof four German language-titled tracks over\n\n40 minutes. It hints at the band’s future agenda,\n\nwith the understated melodies and electronic\n\nexperimentation of tracks such as ‘Megaherz’\n\nand ‘Vom Himmel Hoch’. Cruciallly,\n\nKraftwerk featured Florian Schnieder’s initial\n\nefforts at constructing the home-made rhythm\n\ndevices which the band would later deploy so\n\neffectively. While the album seems somewhat\n\ncrass and inelegant compared to what was to\n\nsucceed it, as a debut it suggested a way forward\n\nfor Kraftwerk. Strangely, around this time\n\nHütter was to briefly abscond from the group,\n\nrejoining to work on the follow up.\n\nWith typical succinctness, their second album\n\nwas named Kraftwerk 2 and packaged with a\n\nsimilar traffic cone graphic, albeit a luminous green one this time. Anticipating the band’s\n\ncrossover to totally ‘synthetic’ sounds, the duo\n\nconstructed percussion sounds on a cheap drum\n\nmachine, with pre-set rhythms corrupted via\n\ntape echo and filtering. Hütter was credited on\n\nthe album with rhythmusmachine, as well as\n\norgan, electric piano, glockenspiel, harmonium\n\nand bass. Schneider, meanwhile, played guitar,\n\nflute, glockenspiel, gierge and mischpult (violin\n\nand mixing). As well as subsequently providing\n\na name for the band’s studio, the album’s best\n\ncut, the opening ‘Kling Klang’, has been hailed\n\nas the first album recording of a drum machine.\n\nWith its pretty melodies and embryonic\n\nmachine grooves, the 17-minute track is recognisably\n\nKraftwerk. ‘Atem’, meanwhile, drew on\n\nthe sound of amplified breathing, a decade\n\nbefore the effect would be used on the classic\n\n‘Tour de France’.\n\n“We don’t consider the first albums as\n\nimportant works,” Schneider has said. Rather,\n\nfor the musician, the recordings suggest a\n\nprocess of rejection: “I studied seriously up to a\n\ncertain level, then I found it boring,” he claims.\n\n“I looked for other things. I found that the flute\n\nwas too limiting. Soon, I bought a microphone,\n\nthen loud-speakers, an echo, and a synthesiser.\n\nMuch later, I threw the flute away. It was a sort\n\nof process.”\n\nFollowing the release of Kraftwerk 2, the duo\n\nbegan to build their own drum machines and\n\nbought their first synths — a Mini Moog and\n\nan Arp Odyssey, the former costing as much as\n\na Volkswagen (it says something of Hütter and\n\nSchneider’s middle-class backgrounds that they\n\ncould afford such an outlay). The result of this\n\nshopping was Ralf And Florian, an album that\n\ntook the blueprint forged on ‘Kling Klang’ and\n\nrefined it into cleaner, smoother sounds. While\n\nthe album seems to reference artists Gilbert &\n\nGeorge, it also merges themes from German folk\n\nmusic with Kraftwerk’s machinic rhythms.\n\nProphetically, the album featured a track entitled\n\n‘Tanzmusik’ — literally, ‘Dance Music’.\n\nFurthermore, Ralf And Florian’s ‘Ananas\n\nSymphonie’ introduced a treated, vocoder vocal.\n\nAlthough its title suggest that it is the work of\n\ntwo people, Ralf And Florian marks the beginning\n\nof the duo’s collaboration with Emil\n\nSchult, a violinist and a student of Joseph Beuys\n\nand pop artist Gerhard Richter. By the time\n\nthat the album was released in 1973, the duo\n\nwere rejecting the conception of Kraftwerk as\n\n‘musicians’ in place of “people who create out\n\nof different media ways of expressing yourself”.\n\nSo far, so relatively inconsequential. It was\n\nwith their next album, their fourth, that\n\nKraftwerk broke through to a wider audience\n\nand began to have a genuine impact of a whole\n\ngeneration of eager-eared record buyers. Ralf\n\nHütter acknowledges the impact of Autobahn\n\nby implicitly dismissing the previous albums,\n\ndescribing this collection as “really the first”.\n\nSimilarly, Schneider has asserted that anything\n\nbefore Autobahn is simply “history, archaeology”.\n\nIts beautiful title track, a 22-minute elegy\n\nto the experience of gliding down a motorway\n\nat high speed, takes up the entire first side.\n\nAccording to Hütter, the tune was borne of\n\nendless tours around his home country in an\n\nold Volkswagen: “That was a vision of our\n\nmusic on the radio, because in Germany they\n\nwouldn’t have been playing our music on the\n\nradio. This was a fiction”.\n\nThe group had originally attempted to\n\ncapture the actual sound of German motorway\n\ntraffic, but thwarted by poor recording equipment,\n\nthey decided to replicate the sounds\n\nthemselves. On its release, the influence of\n\nGerman folklore music could be discerned,\n\nmerging with those of contemporary art theory\n\nand pop music. A further influence stemmed\n\nfrom a surprising source — the Beach Boys.\n\nIndeed, they were a group that Kraftwerk took\n\ntake time out to see on later tours of the US.\n\n“Wir fahr’n, fahr’n, fahr’n auf de autobahn” —\n\nSchult’s lyric for ‘Autobahn’ — can be taken as\n\n“fun, fun, fun on the motorway”. Hütter and\n\nSchneider were fascinated by the Wilson clan’s\n\nability to encapsulate an entire slice of\n\nAmerican life inside a three-minute pop song:\n\n“In a hundred years from now, when people\n\nwant to know what California was like in the\n\n60s, they only have to listen to a single by the Beach Boys,” they suggest. Kraftwerk wanted to\n\ncreate a German equivalent.\n\nFor Hütter, Kraftwerk were fellow members\n\nof a “fatherless generation”: “We were born\n\nafter the war. It was not much of an incentive\n\nto respect our fathers,” he explains. “After the\n\nwar, German entertainment was destroyed. The\n\nGerman people were robbed of their culture,\n\nputting an American head on it. We are the\n\nfirst generation born after the war to shake this\n\noff. We are the first German group to record in\n\nour own language, use our electronic background\n\nand create a central European identity\n\nfor ourselves.” According to Hütter, while\n\ninspired by the Beach Boys, Autobahn was also\n\nmeant to reverse the increasing Americanisation\n\nof post-war German culture, especially pop\n\nmusic: “We want the whole world to know we\n\nare from Germany”. Ironically, the Americans\n\ntook Kraftwerk to their hearts when an edited\n\nversion of the title track became a massive success\n\nthere, going on to trigger the creation of\n\nelectro music.\n\nFor Radio-Activity (aka Radio-Aktivität) in\n\n1976, Kraftwerk moved to EMI and expanded\n\ntheir conceptual conceits into an exploration of\n\naudio broadcast waves. “Radio-activity, it’s in\n\nthe air for you and me,” they sing on the title\n\ntrack. “Radio-activity, discovered by Madam\n\nCurie/Radio-activity, listen to the melody.”\n\nAlthough it seemed to find romanticism in\n\nnuclear physics, the track was intended as a\n\ntongue-in-cheek denunciation of it — something\n\nthat the group were to make explicit with\n\ntheir support of Greenpeace campaigns and a\n\nsubsequent revamp of the track. ‘News’, meanwhile,\n\ncollaged radio broadcasts in a homage to\n\nthe abstract processes of Stockhausen, while, on\n\n‘Antenna’, the group loan credence to the belief\n\nthat less is more. The track’s entire, near-perfect\n\nlyric simply reads: “I’m the antenna catching\n\nvibrations/You’re the transmitter, give information”.\n\n“Kraftwerk made the only concept\n\nalbums that ever worked for me,” says Daniel\n\nMiller, founder of the Mute label and the man\n\nbehind that label’s first, mystery artist the\n\nNormal. “I think the best concept album that\n\nthey ever did was Radio-Activity. The concept\n\nwent through every element of the record.”\n\nAlmost a love-letter, a requiem, an elegy to\n\naudio broadcasting, Radio-Activity crackled with\n\nsadness and clicked with melancholy. It is, simply,\n\none of the most elegantly beautiful albums\n\never made — beautiful enough to inure Kraftwerk\n\nto the literal and metaphorical throatclearing\n\nof punk. There was no phlegm on\n\nKraftwerk.\n\n“We became conscious that Europe is mostly\n\nparks and hotels, promenades and avenues,”\n\nadmitted Hütter upon the release of 1977’s\n\nTrans-Europe Express. “Real life, but in a world\n\nof postcards.” Intended to evoke European\n\nculture, Kraftwerk’s svelte, elegiac release has\n\nbeen likened to the musical equivalent of the\n\nvisual art of Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso and Piet\n\nMondrian, echoing the last-named’s desire to\n\nbuild his pictures from the simplest of elements.\n\nTrans-Europe Express was divided between\n\nsongs about identity loss, and others depicting a\n\ntrain journey across the continent; the album’s\n\ntitle track also referenced both Iggy Pop and\n\nDavid Bowie. One of the most engaging songs\n\never recorded, the song was repackaged as a 12\"\n\nsingle for the disco market: “In the discotheque,\n\nthe spotlight is on everybody,” asserts Hütter\n\npresciently, “unlike concerts, where you only\n\nsee the star of the show and everyone else is in\n\nthe dark. In discos, everybody can be a part of\n\neverybody else.” Kraftwerk had mutated into a\n\nnear perfect European pop band, flawless\n\nmachines dedicated to making music.\n\n“The machines are part of us and we are part\n\nof the machines,” they claimed upon the release\n\nof The Man Machine (aka Die Mensch Maschine,\n\naka L’Homme Machine) in 1978. “They play\n\nwith us and we play with them. We are brothers.”\n\nKraftwerk had begun to imagine themselves\n\nmaking music in Fritz Lang’s 1922 classic\n\nvision of the future, Metropolis, a film that they\n\nname-checked in the track of the same name.\n\nThe album was partly mixed by Leanard\n\nJackson, a studio engineer from the studios\n\nowned by Motown production legend Norman\n\nWhitfield. “We had discovered funk,”\n\nWolfgang Flür recalls. “We were getting into\n\nJames Brown and analysing his records,\n\nwondering, ‘how does he make such good\n\nrhythms?’.”\n\nWriting in From Düsseldorf To The Future\n\n(With Love), Tim Barr suggests that Kraftwerk\n\nreshaped our approach to technology — motorways,\n\ntrains, nuclear power, robots, space\n\nstations, calculators and computers: “the whole\n\nfabric of futurism — both utopian and dystopian\n\n— in contemporary media, would be irrevocably altered” by them. “We were mainly interested\n\nin the everyday context of technology,”\n\nHütter recently explained on Andrew Collins’\n\n6Music radio programme. “So we would work\n\nwith engineers. Not actually inside technology,\n\nbut using technology and viewing different\n\naspects, like man-machine aspects of co-operation\n\nbetween us as men, and machines. That’s\n\nwhat Kraftwerk is about.”\n\nIn the pristine surfaces and taut grooves of\n\n1981’s Computerwelt (aka Computer World),\n\nKraftwerk rewired funk to fit their own\n\naesthetic. The band claimed that the melody\n\nto ‘Pocket Calculator’ had been tapped out on a\n\nsmall Texas Instruments device, eulogising the\n\ngadget with the line, “by pressing down a\n\nspecial key/It plays a little melody”. On the\n\nperfectly-formed album, the group unveiled the\n\nfirst techno love song: “Another lonely\n\nnight/Stare at the TV screen/I don’t know what\n\nto do/I need a rendezvous” (‘Computer Love’).\n\nIssued as single in the UK, it stalled at No. 36,\n\nbefore DJs flipped it over and started playing\n\nthe B-side, ‘The Model’ on daytime radio. The\n\nresult was nothing less than astounding — the\n\nsingle shot to No. 1 and Kraftwerk suddenly\n\nbecame a household name.\n\nFor Hütter, modern technology was the\n\nrealisation of the band’s very particular vision:\n\n“Over the years, it has become a reality, from\n\npocket calculators to computers. So, for us, it is\n\nvery energetic feedback to go and continue and\n\nwork in this direction”. Nevertheless, Hütter\n\nhas rejected the suggestion that Kraftwerk are\n\nfuturistic: “We were maybe just in time,” he\n\ndeadpanned.\n\nWith Autobahn, Trans-Europe Express,\n\nRadio-Activity, The Man Machine and Computer\n\nWorld, Kraftwerk were to remodel popular\n\nmusic — the vocabulary of dance music is\n\nalmost entirely that of their design. Strangely,\n\nKraftwerk’s stiff Teutonic rhythms struck a\n\nchord with black Americans. Afrika Bambaata\n\nrevealed in David Toop’s Rap Attack, “I don’t\n\nthink they even knew how big they were among\n\nthe black masses back in ’77, when they came\n\nout with Trans-Europe Express. When that came\n\nout, I thought that was one of the best and\n\nweirdest records I ever heard in my life”.\n\nWorking with Arthur Baker, Afrika\n\nBambaata & the Soul Sonic Force were to\n\nappropriate the melody from ‘Trans Europe\n\nExpress’ and the rhythm from ‘Numbers’ to\n\npractically conceive electro. And via electro, this\n\nstrange, incredible music impacted on hip-hop.\n\n“Kraftwerk was the inspiration for dozens of\n\nhip-hop artists back then. Kraftwerk was the\n\nbeginning of it as far as I’m concerned,” recalls\n\nearly hip-hop artist Man Parrish. “People were\n\nlistening to other electronic stuff, but nothing\n\nreally had the groove or beat before Kraftwerk\n\nstarted. When Kraftwerk came out, it was\n\nmind-blowing. I remember sitting in a taxi cab\n\nsmoking a joint with the window open. I\n\npassed it to the driver, and when we got in front\n\nof my apartment, Kraftwerk came on. He\n\nturned the meter off and we were like, ‘whoa,\n\nwhat’s that?’.”\n\n“Two records put me over the top with\n\nhip-hop,” Queen Latifah has recalled. “One of\n\nthem was ‘Planet Rock’, and the other was\n\n‘Numbers’, from Kraftwerk. Every kid in the\n\n’hood in New York and New Jersey was\n\npopping, locking and breaking to that record.\n\nIt was the hottest track on the street at that\n\ntime.”\n\nIndeed, it’s entirely reasonable to argue that\n\nthe story of techno began not in early 80s\n\nDetroit when but rather in early 70s Düsseldorf\n\nwhen Kraftwerk built their Kling Klang studio. Paul Shurey, who booked Kraftwerk to play at\n\n1997’s Tribal Gathering, elaborates: “At\n\nUniverse, we were among the first promoters to\n\nchampion Detroit techno and become friendly\n\nwith the city’s legendary DJs — Derrick May,\n\nJuan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Stacey Pullen.\n\nIt was mainly these DJs’ citing of Kraftwerk as a\n\nprimary influence behind their creation of the\n\nfirst Detroit tracks that inspired us to attempt\n\nto book the band. It allowed people to see the\n\nprogression from early machine-made dance\n\nmusic to what was the present day. The band\n\nfitted in seamlessly with the contemporary lineup,\n\nas we were confident they would. Kraftwerk\n\ndidn’t disappoint anyone, particularly all of the\n\nDetroit legends who were squashed in the\n\naudience in front of the stage”.\n\nFor Derrick May, Detroit’s techno was akin\n\nto “George Clinton and Kraftwerk stuck in an\n\nelevator”. He saw that “Kraftwerk was always\n\nvery ‘culty’, but it was very Detroit too, because\n\nof the industry in Detroit and because of the\n\nmentality”. As he stated in Simon Reynold’s\n\nEnergy Flash, “that music automatically appeals\n\nto the people like a tribal calling. It sounded\n\nlike somebody making music with hammers\n\nand nails”.\n\nLong before that era, Kraftwerk had conceived\n\ntheir music as music for dancing: “One\n\nday we had this gig at the arts centre,” Hütter\n\nhas recalled. “And I had this little drum\n\nmachine. At a certain moment, we had it going\n\nwith some echo loop and feedback, and we just\n\nleft the stage and joined the dancers. It kept on\n\ngoing for an hour or so”. Intriguingly, the usually\n\ninsular Kraftwerk have reportedly socialised\n\nwith Detroit’s publicity-shy Underground\n\nResistance (aka Mike Banks and Jeff Mills), the\n\nmilitant music-makers who’ve been compared\n\nto “a sort of techno Public Enemy” and who\n\nremixed Kraftwerk’s “Expo 2000” single.\n\n“Underground Resistance have taken over the\n\nposition that Kraftwerk held 10 years ago,” arty\n\ntechno producer Carl Craig has commented.\n\n“There’s the same sense of mystique and\n\nanticipation about their releases.”\n\nSuch connections were to feed back into\n\nKraftwerk via the revised history of The Mix,\n\n1991’s collection of reworked tracks informed\n\nby the culture of the dancefloor. Though there\n\nwas an artistic risk in remaking their most\n\nperfect of musics, The Mix doesn’t seem like\n\na deliberate act of iconaclism or sabotage. Slow\n\nprogress in making the album — it took five\n\nyears to complete — was, however, to take its\n\ntoll, with both Wolfgang Flür and Karl Bartos\n\nquitting the band, marking the end of the\n\n‘classic’ Kraftwerk line-up of Hütter, Schneider,\n\nFlür and Bartos. After that, Kraftwerk would\n\nrelease nothing, apart from 1999’s Expo 2000\n\nEP until 2003.\n\nIn his autobiography Kraftwerk: I Was A\n\nRobot, Flür recalls that, in the early 80s, Ralf\n\nHütter and Florian Schneider were almost as\n\nfanatical about their bikes as they were about\n\nmusic: “They would prefer to study cycling\n\ncatalogues rather than think up new ideas for\n\nsongs. The bicycle,” he says, “seemed to have\n\nbecome an alternative to the synthesiser, particularly\n\nfor Ralf”.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given Kraftwerk’s appropriation\n\nof the iconography of transportation, the\n\ninterest was the trigger for a song, ‘Tour De\n\nFrance’. Constructed using an early sampler,\n\nthe track appropriated the sounds of bikes\n\nswitching gears, bike chains and even\n\nSchneider’s breathing. The anniversary of the\n\nTour De France in 2003 was to become the\n\ncatalyst for Kraftwerk’s first album since The\n\nMix. Its release also garnered them an invitation\n\nto follow the 2003 race from a guest limousine.\n\nRecalls Hütter: “In 1982/83, I had this idea\n\nabout writing a composition about our fanatical\n\nhobby, riding the bikes and doing cycling exercises.\n\nWe wanted to transform this experience\n\ninto a musical work. We did the single in 1983.\n\nIt was planned as an album. Together with my\n\npartner Florian Schneider, I had this whole\n\nconcept of a Tour De France album. Then we just lost the album concept and went on to\n\nsome other digital exercises, working on the\n\nElectric Café album”. It includes a track about\n\n‘Titanium’: “That’s very personal,” Hütter has\n\nsaid of the corrosion-resistant, white metallic\n\nelement tune. “Because our bikes are made of\n\ntitanium. This is very close material for us.”\n\nConducting a radio interview to promote\n\nTour De France 2003, Hütter was asked if he\n\nwould be able to play a song on guitar.\n\n“No,” he said, pausing just long enough to\n\nsuggest that this was the most ridiculous thing\n\nhe had ever been asked. “I play keyboards.”"
