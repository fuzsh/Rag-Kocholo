        "text": "I know some on here actually keep up their personal weekly singles/song charts and I often wish I could do the same just cause it would be fun to look back on later.\n\nI've also done too many attempts of making playlists for each year/decade and always struggle on where to draw the line (qualitywise).\n\nAnd then I got the idea of doing a playlist of every single song that would have been number one on my personal charts, if I'd actually made them. Which sounds a lot more vague and hard than it actually is cause we all know those songs that overshadow anything else released that week/month/year, that made you rush out to get the album, etcetera.\n\nSo I made a start with mine (also did seperate lists for each decade)\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ffXVoqQKuqYtrZicSkBmv\n\nAs a starting point I just put on about 5 songs that came to mind first, then kept refreshing Spotify's 'recommended songs' and added ones that fitted the bill.\n\nOnce I'm done I intend to put it all in chronological order. Also looking forward to finding out which artists/eras had the most #1s for me.\n\nI'm only slightly struggling with:\n\n- songs that were obviously a #1 for me at the time which I've completely gone off (still chose to include those)\n\n- songs that feel like huge moments in hindsight (I Want It That Way, Rhythm Is A Dancer..) where I just wasn't particularly invested in them when they came out. I even recall Sound Of The Underground and No Good Advice just being 'one of the many songs on the radio I liked' instead of properly standing out. But I hate rewriting history, so in case of doubt I don't include it.\n\n- everything from the early 90s and earlier. I can guess 'had I been paying attention' a Like A Prayer would be a no-brainer for a #1, but I was not consciously listening to music yet at the time so it feels like a guessing game.\n\nWould quite like to see other people's attempts and lists because I think it could be a nice reflection of music/your taste through the years?\n\nI completed the 00s portion chronologically.. it's quite a ride and at times oddly affecting to see/hear certain songs together. I'm not sure what 2002/03/04 did to hurt me but they were years where apparently few songs properly stuck with me. Perhaps cause it was the start of the download days and pre-iTunes?\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/6pMyef0iKqH6kezvzV8kct?si=T7KJoARPQGGq8erBiDK2PQ\n\nThe list:\n\n22-01 Backstreet Boys - Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely\n\n- 12-02 Wow! - The Night Before You Came\n\n11-03 Jessica Simpson - I Wanna Love You Forever\n\n11-03 Linda - No Goodbyes\n\n20-03 Precious - Rewind\n\n01-04 Melanie - Never Be The Same Again\n\n03-04 Steps - Deeper Shade Of Blue\n\n08-04 Scooch - More Than I Needed To Know\n\n29-04 Britney Spears - Oops!...
