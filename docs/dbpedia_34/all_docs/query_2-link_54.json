        "text": "7. “Tour De France” – Kraftwerk\n\n(From the non-album single “Tour De France”)\n\n1983\n\nOriginally written with the intention that “Tour De France” would be included on their next album, the recording of that album (what would ultimately become Electric Cafe) was plagued by difficulties and delays – ironically in part due to the serious cycling accident of key member Ralph Hutter – and so ultimately “Tour De France” was released as a non-album single in 1983 in honor of the famed French cycling event (beloved by the band as several members were ardent cyclists). “Tour De France” pulls back from the technological themes and dystopian feel of Kraftwerk’s recent albums in favor of something more uplifting and human feeling. “Tour De France” also recalls earlier Kraftwerk songs like “Autobahn” and “Trans-Europe Express” in its tone and pacing. “Tour De France” saw some success in its original version released in 1983 and is seen by many as the last hurrah of Kraftwerk. In 1986 Kraftwerk finally released Electric Cafe but the album was seen by fans and critics alike as somewhat bland and disappointing, a cheap imitation of the music their own musical descendants were then making. Electric Cafe would be the last Kraftwerk album released until 2003, when Kraftwerk would revive and remix “Tour De France” as the centerpiece of a new album called Tour De France Soundtracks in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Tour De France cycling race. That album would prove to be the final Kraftwerk album with new studio music, although the band’s reputation as pioneers and revered elder statesmen both rose dramatically in the 21st century as it became increasingly obvious the impact that Kraftwerk had on a wide variety of music and genres."
