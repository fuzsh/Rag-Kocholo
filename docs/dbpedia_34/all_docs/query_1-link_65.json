As pioneers of the , Depeche Mode were among the most prolific acts to make use of technology within a traditional format. Among the many original samples recorded and utilized by Depeche Mode to enhance the atmosphere of their musical output are many that originated elsewhere, including brief passages of musical recordings by other artists, snippets of audio from television shows, radio broadcasts, films, environmental sounds, and more. Analysis of these sample sources and how they are manipulated is a popular topic of discussion amongst fans of the group.\n\nKey\n\nOfficial\n\nThe sample is confirmed to have been used in the specified song by a past/present member of Depeche Mode, an individual involved in its production, or band archivist .\n\nConfirmed\n\nThe sample is independently confirmed to have been used in the specified song.\n\nLikely\n\nThe sample is likely to have been used in the specified song but has not yet been confirmed.\n\nUnconfirmed\n\nThe sample is not yet confirmed to have been used in the specified song.\n\nDisproven\n\nThe sample is confirmed to not have been used in the specified song.\n\nUnknown\n\nIt is unclear if the sample was used in the specified song.\n\nInformation\n\nThis page documents all verifiable sound sources for many of the musical parts used by Depeche Mode in the live concert tour arrangements of songs performed on the 1987-1988 Music For The Masses Tour.\n\nDue to the manipulated nature of the samples described in this article, there is unavoidable potential for error or sample misattribution. To ensure accuracy, this article strives to use verified quotes from band members and recording personnel with citations wherever possible, audio examples, and independent research voluntarily contributed by Depeche Mode and Recoil fans worldwide. This article provides an interesting document on this topic in a tabular format that is organized, well-researched, and reasonably accurate. Please bear in mind that due to the limited number of relevant quotes for each sample from band members or associates involved in producing the music described on this page, audio samples that lack official confirmation are not guaranteed to be accurate.\n\nThis article differentiates samples by origin: Self-made samples, which describe any material initially recorded by Depeche Mode or Recoil, and Sourced samples, which describe samples not initially recorded by either group. In addition to confirmed samples, this article also covers samples commonly misreported as having been used but directly refuted by a member or associate of Depeche Mode or Recoil.\n\nIf you notice an error or wish to contribute or request the removal of information contained within this article, please feel free to contact us.\n\n1987-1988 Music For The Masses Tour\n\nPimpf\n\n\"Pimpf\"\n\nDepeche Mode\n\n1987 Self-made samples Sample Notes Audio Exploding firework An exploding sound originally recorded for use with \"Stripped\" is layered in with a large choir stab in the outro of \"Pimpf\".

All that entailed was us hitting a big lump of concrete with a sampling hammer. The engineer / producer we use, Gareth Jones, has got this brilliant little recorder called a Stellavox which we use with two stereo mikes and it's as good as any standard 30ips reel-to-reel but this is very small and therefore very portable. So we just took the Stellavox out into the middle of this big, ambient space and miked up the ground and hit it with a big metal hammer. The sound was... like concrete being hit. I can't really put it any other way.\n\nSample sources Sample Source Status Notes Oboe melody Timbre Directory Diskette #2 - 2263 Oboe Source\n\nConfirmed\n\nThe atmospheric melody heard throughout \"Blasphemous Rumours\" is derived from the \"Oboe Source\" timbre of timbre directory diskette #2.

Daniel Miller describes the recording process of this sound in the 2006 Black Celebration remaster documentary:\n\nIt was rockets that we were doing, so we thought, if we angled them at a fairly low angle, we could set up a series of microphones and we would still be able to pick up the sound as it traveled along. If we straight up, we would have got just one sound, it would just have sort of disappeared, so we did that. We set up a sort of bottle at a very narrow angle and had, like, 5 microphones maybe, at, I don't know, 15 feet apart, something like that.\n\nOther notable uses of this sample include \"Breathing In Fumes\", the final moments of \"Pimpf\" (where it is layered with a large choir stab and played several notes down from its root key) and various live performances of \"Never Let Me Down Again\".\n\n✖ Tom drums A series of with a unique \"roomy\" quality occur throughout \"Stripped\".

The loop is also present on Martin Gore's demo recording. Wilder confirms the origin of the sample in a summary of the Emulator II lot listing on The Alan Wilder / Depeche Mode Collection auction site:\n\nI remember when we first inserted the huge floppy disc into the [Emulator I] and listened to the ‘Motorbike Idling’ sound (which later became the mainstay rhythm behind the song \"Stripped\"), I was hooked.[6]\n\nNotably, this sample is also used in \"Breathing In Fumes\" and the Music For The Masses tour arrangement of \"Pipeline\".\n\nClick to display/hide audio example\n\nOperatic vocal , , , - - \"Columba aspexit\" - April 1985 (recorded 14 September 1981)\n\nConfirmed\n\nAn operatic vocal derived from a September 1981 performance of \"Columba aspexit\", a piece of sacred written in the 12th century by German , is utilised as a layer to form a synth string part audible throughout the outro of \"Stripped\".
