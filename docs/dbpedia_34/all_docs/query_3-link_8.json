        "text": "For those of you joining our search, welcome to this Subreddit. If you're a fresh face who is new to the search, or even a more seasoned TMS member who just needs access to the information we have, this post is for you. This post will be updated as much as possible when new facts are available.\n\nIt's likely if you're here that you already know the basics of the song. For those of you who don't, it is a song that was recorded from a German radio station known as NDR1, from a show called \" Musik FÃ¼r Junge Leute\" in 1984. Nothing much is known about the song's origins. The lyrics, country of origin, band, and title are speculated on, but largely remain a mystery. I highly recommend looking through the resources I share here to get up to speed.\n\nIf you've not heard the song, here's your chance.\n\nHere is a link to a vocally enhanced, higher quality of the song in question: https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fs%2Fa7bs54g3d0ufmk8ps4m4anfhwqmpka9y\n\nFor those of you who prefer YouTube, here is a remaster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nUWawrH5C0\n\nAnd the full song, without remastering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPGf4liO-KQ\n\nHere are some current facts.\n\nu/bluuely, real name Lydia, posted the song under thealias Anton Riedel in 2007, looking for more information about it. They've joined in our search, and have posted several updates and information regarding their efforts to aide the search. They have posted the full tape's audio, and they provided a tracklist of what was on it. Links to their posts are in a section below.\n\nSeveral people have reached out to multiple radio stations in their area to get the song out further, but nothing yet has led to solid results as far as the song's identity.\n\nSince the radio station that may have aired it is likely in Germany, there have been attempts to look into the GEMA database. For those who don't know what that is, it is basically a German government organization that collects the music and the usage rights for songs and their creators. It has been said that songs which air on German radio are required to be registered with them. Information about GEMA can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEMA_(German_organization) GEMA's database can be found here: https://online.gema.de/werke/search.facesFor detailed information on how to use GEMA's database for the purpose of our search, please look here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/d2eodb/heribert_loosen_can_definitely_be_ruled_out/The GEMA database's online search tool has been mentioned to not be a full list of their archives. Here is a post which confirms this: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/d3z1xd/confirmation_that_the_online_gema_database_is_not/ If using them as a search method, it is advised to contact them for a more complete repertoire. Currently, it's ambiguous what this inquiry will yield. An example of someone requesting works by years is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/daltu8/looks_like_gema_may_not_even_have_tmms_in_an/\n\nThere have been several issues where someone has come here trolling, trying to derail our efforts. They've posted the song all over the place, made claims that couldn't be supported, and have been generally misleading people with their posts. They assert that either they made the song themselves, or someone called Blau Blatt Bummel made the song. The former claim has been ruled out. There is no information about Blau Blatt Bummel, so it is more widely perceived to be a false claim.\n\nThere has been a lot going on, and it can be hard to find certain pieces of information. If you're looking for a detailed timeline, one regarding the song's journey from the 1980's until July 25th, 2019 can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/cisroc/the_mysterious_song_timeline_as_of_far_updated/ And if you want to know about our efforts in detail, as well as what search efforts are like outside of Reddit for TMS, the people on Know Your Meme have been following this and keeping up with it. You can find the link to it, here: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-most-mysterious-song-on-the-internet\n\nThere has been an attempt to keep up with the leads in this case, and it is said to be kept up to date and accurate. The spreadsheet, created on July 31st, 2019, can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GePlaroCOz_jYHlR5Gcr4DfdGjUq-12C967ZBIn0Rns/edit#gid=0\n\nThere is a Discord sever dedicated to The Mysterious Song, and the ongoing search. For those interested, you can find that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/clf15a/discord/\n\nArticles and Media regarding The Mysterious Song:\n\nPaul Baskerville, a person suspected of having aired the original song, has played it for his current audience. A clip from this event can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFPST7GgTgI\n\nA radio station called MIX 106.1 in Mansfield, Ohio included The Mysterious Song in a pre-recorded segment on August 14th, 2019 at 9:30PM EST. A post regarding this has been made here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/d3geje/update_my_moms_playing_a_clip_of_the_song_talking/ Additionally, as the show is pre-recorded, the clip can be heard here: https://youtu.be/TsJP6avEzrc And for those looking to download it, that can be done here: https://app.box.com/s/jh6p7ysn55r34jixongtagakws6djjz4\n\nA German news site covered some of the basics of the story, and made a Facebook post in addition to this. The article on their site can be found here: https://www.br.de/nachrichten/netzwelt/internet-ratlos-wie-heisst-dieser-song,RbNFvvC The Facebook post can be seen here: https://www.facebook.com/208046455335/posts/10157324131440336?sfns=mo\n\nThe popular Rolling Stones magazine has made an article speaking about TMS on 9/24/2019, which can be read here: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/most-mysterious-song-on-the-internet-885106/\n\nPopular German newspaper Zeit made an article about TMS on 9/27/2019, which can be read here: https://www.zeit.de/kultur/musik/2019-09/the-most-mysterious-song-on-the-internet-popkultur\n\nThe New York Times published an article which mentioned TMS briefly on 10/06/2019. The mention can be found in the 3rd paragraph from the bottom: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/06/dining/what-to-cook-this-week.htm\n\nThe AV Club has posted an article regarding TMS on 10/08/2019: https://news.avclub.com/internet-sleuths-are-trying-to-identify-a-mysterious-p-1838877869?rev=1570565330798&utm_content=Main&utm_campaign=SF&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=SocialMarketing\n\nLydia's posts:\n\nTheir first comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/ct570y/update_august_20th_2019/exkycuv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n\nThe tracklist for the side of the tape TMS is on, (all of which was selectively recorded by their brother, not just a chunk of radio that had been playing that day): https://i.redd.it/h2bvpgnotnh31.png\n\nTheir first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/cu557v/update_from_lydia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n\nTheir second update: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/cv13gw/update_2_from_lydia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n\nTheir third update: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/cvswb9/small_update_3_from_lydia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n\nTheir fourth update: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/cwq9ws/update_4_from_lydia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n\nTheir fifth update: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/cyvb61/update_5_from_lydia_rather_a_small_one/\n\nTheir 6th update, containing a rip of side 1 of the tape: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/d7wgk4/update_6_from_lydia_full_tape_recording/\n\nSome things to possibly keep in mind:\n\nShazam, Spotify, YouTube's algorithm and similar software yield false results. This is due to the obscure nature of the song, as well as an incident involving someone by the name of Nicholas uploading the song and taking credit for it. This can be quickly spotted by noting if the musician's name is \"Antwon01\".\n\nEverything needs proof around here, and rightly so. If you claim to know valuable information of the song, but don't share how you know this or have solid proof, there's nothing tying down your claims.\n\nThere are bouts of trolling and misinformation, so be careful what information you choose to believe. It's your choice and your right to believe what you want, but that doesn't mean caution isn't in order.\n\nIf contacting GEMA about their reportoire, be mindful of your wording, as well as the wording of any response you may receive. As mentioned in a section above, someone asking for a list of works between a specific set of years did not yield any results.\n\nThere have been several people saying the song might be from a region other than Germany, such as from Austria, Switzerland, Russia, or Japan even. The vocals lack distinct regional accent indicators, and it could even be a case of someone without an accent pretending to have an accent, as this was not an uncommon practice in music from the time.\n\nThe number of musicians responsible is heavily speculated on, and there have been suggestions of anywhere from 1 to 6 people. It's possible TMS is a collaboration work, as it was common for musicians to join up for side projects during the concerned time period."
