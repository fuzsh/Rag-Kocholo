        "text": "-Please include pre-research before posting a lead so it isn't debunked within 5 minutes of being posted\n\n-YouTube links with \"similar\" sounding bands without any substance\n\n-Posts that leave people hanging, IE \"my grandma knows this song, I'll ask her what it is next week\"\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance rule against hoax theories; it’s simply untrue, it’s disrespectful to Lydia, and it’s disrespectful to the people who have spent months upon months of their personal time searching. It also doesn’t help anyone at all with investigation, and if anything, it is detrimental to such investigation.\n\nMany bands are just very difficult to find or are nonexistent online. Just because you can't find it doesn't make it a hoax.\n\n-Duplicate threads. We don't need 5 active threads about the same lead.\n\n-Inactive leads. Please view the spreadsheet before posting.\n\n-Off-topic posts. Includes \"other\" mystery songs. Please submit those to r/lostwave.\n\n-Vote Manipulation and/or vote botting\n\nDo not contact anyone without mod permission, and do not repeatedly contact individuals. Exceptions exist for this-- but again, you need mod permission first and foremost.\n\nThis can be done by u/ -ing one of us, DMing or pinging one of us on Discord, or just asking us via modmail.\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysteriousSong/comments/jbq3yb/new_rule_for_this_subreddit/\n\nIf you want to post a lyrical interpretation, you have to use the proper flair (as is the case with all posts).\n\nAdditionally, the post MUST CONTAIN additional substance, such as an explanation for your interpretation or a connection to something that can help us in the search. This can be simple as a syllable analysis or audio clips, or as in-depth as a complete lyrical analysis."
