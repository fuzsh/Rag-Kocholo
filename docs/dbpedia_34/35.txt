Originally released in 1983 / 12 tracks

After a hiatus of over a decade, Kraftwerk returned to the fold with their conceptual celebration of the centenary anniversary celebrations of the Tour de France. Not to be confused with the exquisite 1983 single of the same name (although the track does appear in a remastered format), the album remakes the original single into a sum of three parts, a ‘Tour de France’ mega-mix made up of nervous micro-house, mesmeric fluctuating house rhythms and glistening arpeggiated synth life forms respectively. Elsewhere there are the technoid manipulations of ‘Aero Dynamik’ and the original title-track, which is of course, a thoroughly grandiose celebration of the group’s second favourite past-time with arpeggiated synthesizer melodies, slap bass, fatigued breathing and glistening harps. A deep synergy of progress in action.
