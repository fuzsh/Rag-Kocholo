        "text": "You'll only need a few simple ingredients to make this easy recipe, so let's round them up and get started!\n\nHeat olive oil in a pot, add beef, season with salt and pepper, and sear until browned on all sides. Then add the onion.\n\nAdd the minced garlic and cook for another 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes.\n\nCover the pot and let the stew simmer over low heat until the meat is very tender.\n\nAdd the potatoes and carrots, then continue to simmer until they are just tender.\n\nStir in the frozen green beans, frozen green peas, and frozen corn. Cook the stew for another 8-10 minutes.\n\nWhisk cornstarch in water, then pour it into the stew, and let it simmer for 5 minutes to thicken."
