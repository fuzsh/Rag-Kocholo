We have eaten there so many times and it always is fantastic. The Friday night fish fry is great because it uses Irish beer to bread the fish, but the burgers are amazing. Also, the reuben soup is so yummy. My husband had a reuben pizza and loved it. You can’t go wrong — amazing flavor, service and value for the cost.\n\nGrannyMaryK Franklin July 17, 2014\n\n“One Outstanding Irish Restaurant”\n\nMulligans is our go-to restaurant as we are never disappointed. Staff is friendly, fun and attentive. The owners treat you as family. Our favorites from the menu, Shepherds Pie, McGinty Burger, Pub burger (with Irish Chedder), fish fry, Guinness Irish Stew, pizza, to name a few. Whether you are looking for lighter selection or full out dinner, Mulligan’s offers it all. Large selection of beverages, specialty drinks (try the Lucky Pears), Restaurant is clean-inside and out.\n\nHawk42Wisconsin September 29, 2014\n\n“Irish Cuisine Comparable To Ireland!”\n\nWe had just visited Ireland this summer so when I suggested this restaurant for our group of 9 to dine at, I was anticipating the comparison I could make with their meals. OUTSTANDING! I had the Bangers and Mash and it was so tasty! Wife had Shepherds Pie and my friend had Irish Stew and they both were awesome. All three meals comparable to Ireland’s restaurants! The 9 of us all agreed that it was a fantastic choice for our get together. Spent time at the bar before the meal and was served quickly and friendly. The waitstaff was so nice! Prompt service and heads up attention kept everyone happy! Not overbearing and yet right there every time we had a need! We are for sure going back there, and I will even get a meal to go to surprise the wife! You will not be disappointed with choosing Mulligan’s!\n\nFrom Yelp.com\n\nLinda R. -Menomonee Falls 2/5/23\n\nGreat Food, wonderful staff, great people you meet there!! I live in Menomonee Falls and always make it my point on the weekends to visit Mulligans!!!\n\nAndrew G. St. Paul MN 6/19/2014\n\nAmazing. Amaaaaaazing. Bangers and mash, lamb stew, and cabbage and corned beef, all incredible. Full bar, cheap drinks the night we went ($3 long islands). Great place. You will not be disappointed.\n\nJoseph S. Oak Creek 4/30/2014\n\nI’ve probably ate or drank here 25 times. They have a great happy hour special with half price appetizers and drink specials. The apps are solid. id recommend the irish nachos There was a time when I had several bad meals here from their regular menu, but, last night I had a McGinty burger. It was huge! The burger tasted pretty good and came with plenty of fries.\n\nJay B. – Franklin 1/30/2014"
