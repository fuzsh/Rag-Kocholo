        "text": "This delicious homemade Irish beef stew recipe is jam-packed with root vegetables, beef stew meat, and herbs simmered in a stout beer broth. The flavors in this rich dish are incredible.\n\n‘Tis the season full of fish frys, corned beef, and other hearty spring favorites. In Chicago, it’s still always cold in March, so soup is still on the menu. This Beef Stew is essential for celebrating St. Patrick’s Day, but it’s also delicious all year round.\n\nIrish Beef Stew\n\nIrish beef stew is a classic dish of beef and vegetables that are cooked until tender in a flavorful broth. Both tomato paste and Dark Beer are traditionally used to give body, color, richness and flavor to the stew. There can also be adaptations to the recipe with the inclusion of different root vegetables.\n\nThis stew was said to be created in the 1600s by Irish shepherds and farmers who had few ingredients but needed to make a hearty meal. It was later expanded upon during hard times in the depression as Mulligan Stew, which has more vegetables in it.\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n\nOil — Any neutral-flavored oil will work, like avocado oil. You can also use tallow, lard, ghee, or clarified butter.\n\nOnions – I used a yellow onion, but a white or sweet onion can also be used. In addition, you will need some whole garlic cloves. You can also add in 1 to 2 thinly sliced leeks as well if you’d like.\n\nVegetables — My recipe used carrots and parsnips. However, you can also add turnips, rutabaga, celeriac root, or any other root vegetables that you see fit. If you add more of these, you may need more stock to the recipe.\n\nBeef — This recipe will work with beef stew meat, such as top or bottom round, flank, sirloin, chuck, ribeye, or rump roast.\n\nTomato Paste – You need some tomato paste for color, body, and flavor.\n\nBeer — The best beer is a dark one, such as a stout or porter. I used Guinness, of course. If you do not drink alcohol, then simply skip this ingredient and procedure.\n\nStock — Beef stock is best for the most flavor. However, you could use vegetable stock, chicken stock, brodo, or water if that is all that is available.\n\nPotatoes – Yukon potatoes would be the more classical potatoes to use. Substitute with Russets or red potatoes if that’s all you have.\n\nHerbs – I used a combination of fresh thyme and parsley. Fresh rosemary would also be an option in this beef stew.\n\nHow to Make Irish Beef Stew\n\nCaramelize the onions until brown over low heat in a large pot with oil, about 20 minutes.\n\nNext, add in the carrots, turnips, and garlic and sweat over low heat for 5-10 minutes.\n\nRemove the vegetables and add the pot back to the burner over medium-high heat with more oil.\n\nAdd in the meat and brown on all sides, about 4-6 minutes.\n\nPince with the tomato paste over low heat to help thicken.\n\nAdd in the Guinness and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until thick and slightly reduced.\n\nPour the stock and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes to tenderize and braise the beef.\n\nAdd in the sweated vegetables, potatoes, herbs, salt, and pepper and cook for a further 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and serve.\n\nMake-Ahead and Storage\n\nMake-Ahead: For freshness it’s best to serve this soup once it is finished cooking. However, it can be made up to 2 days ahead.\n\nHow to Store: Cover and keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. It will freeze well covered in the freeze for up to 2 months. Be sure to thaw in the fridge for 1 day before reheating.\n\nHow to Reheat: Add the desired amount of Irish beef stew to a small pot and cook over low heat until hot.\n\nMore Soup Recipes"
