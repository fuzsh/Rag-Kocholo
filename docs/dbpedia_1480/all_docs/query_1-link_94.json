        "text": "I feel a certain affinity with the Fourth Earl of Sandwich, more so than with the third, and definitely more than the fifth.\n\nThat’s because the sandwich is named in the Fourth Earl of Sandwich’s honor. Thursday, Nov. 3, was the Earl’s 293rd birthday. (It would have been, anyway. He actually died in 1792 at the age of 73.)\n\nTo mark this occasion and to celebrate the sandwich, which has contributed so much to our daily lives, Nov. 3 is celebrated far and wide as the National Day of the Sandwich.\n\nWhy the affinity with Earl IV? That’s because I, too, have a name associated with a foodstuff, and I spent much of my childhood with a feigned smile shellacked onto my mug when some adult cutup would remark to me upon introduction, “Mulligan, eh? Mulligan stew?”\n\nThat’s the witty-repartee equivalent of, “Hot enough for ya?” on a day when the mercury’s registering 98 degrees. But I digress.\n\nLegend has it that the Earl was such an avid card player that he would have his servants bring his meat between slices of bread so he could continue uninterrupted. History has remained mum on how he dealt with other of nature’s requirements.\n\nWe’re a rare group, those of us who have a food named in our honor. And many of the stories behind their origins are as inspirational as the story behind the sandwich. Some, maybe even more so.\n\nBeef Wellington, for instance. On the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, while his aides quailed with the import of the following day’s outcome, the Duke of Wellington was heard to coolly remark, “You know what would go great on a steak? Paté. Somebody bring me my apron!”\n\nThen there was General Gao, the legendary 14th-century warrior credited by many with expelling the Mongols from China. When he was a very old man, pilgrims would journey many miles to partake of his wisdom. According to scholars, one young man trekked over the course of many days to inquire, “What would go really well with fried rice? I grow tired of lobster sauce.” General Gao then imparted the recipe for General Gao’s chicken that exists to this day, adding, “But don’t tell General Tso!”\n\nBut perhaps even more memorable than the successes are the failures.\n\nIt was in early 19th-century Hoboken, N.J., that John Vanvieldersliding was credited with the first combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise in a sandwich. He would travel from town to town by mule-driven cart to market his invention as “Vanvielderslidings.”\n\nDue to the lack of widespread literacy among the lower classes, the name had to be simplified before the sandwich could catch on. Thus, the BLT was born. Historians say Vanvieldersliding died a bitter and disillusioned man."
