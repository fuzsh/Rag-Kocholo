        "text": "In the heartland of our beautiful patchwork of fields and pastures, there's a certain kind of magic that happens when we gather 'round the dinner table, especially when that table is graced with a hearty bowl of Mulligan Beef Stew. This humble dish is as rich in history as it is in flavor, finding its roots in the days where every little bit in the kitchen was precious. The stew, often a hodgepodge of the week's leftovers, transformed simple ingredients into a meal that brought families together after long, hardworking days. It's a forgiving and flexible meal, which is why I believe you'll find it the perfect recipe to cozy up to when you need a touch of home in your bowl.\n\nMulligan Beef Stew is a meal almost complete in itself, full of veggies and hearty proteins. However, nothing complements a stew quite like a good piece of freshly baked cornbread or some fluffy buttermilk biscuits, perfect for sopping up that delicious gravy. And if you're yearning for something green, a crisp side salad with a tangy vinaigrette provides a refreshing contrast to the rich flavors of the stew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomestyle Mulligan Beef Stew\n\nServings: Serves 6 to 8 souls looking for a taste of home.\n\nIngredients\n\n- 2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch pieces\n\n- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n- 1 large onion, chopped\n\n- 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n\n- 6 cups beef broth\n\n- 3 carrots, peeled and sliced\n\n- 3 potatoes, peeled and cubed\n\n- 2 stalks celery, sliced\n\n- 1 cup frozen peas\n\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n\n- 2 bay leaves\n\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n- Chopped parsley for garnish (optional)\n\nDirections\n\n1. Begin by seasoning the beef chunks with salt and pepper, then toss them in flour to coat.\n\n2. In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Place the floured beef in the pot and brown on all sides. Do this in batches if necessary to keep from crowding the pan.\n\n3. Remove the beef and set it aside. In the same pot, add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Toss in the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n4. Pour in the beef broth to deglaze the bottom of the pot, scraping up those tasty browned bits. Then, return the beef to the pot.\n\n5. Add the carrots, potatoes, celery, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 2 hours or until the beef is tender.\n\n6. Stir in the frozen peas and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to your taste.\n\n7. Discard the bay leaves and serve garnished with a sprinkle of chopped parsley if desired.\n\nVariations & Tips\n\nAdvertisement"
