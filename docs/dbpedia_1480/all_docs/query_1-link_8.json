AS AN AMAZON ASSOCIATE I EARN FROM QUALIFYING PURCHASES.\n\nMulligan stew is a family-friendly, easy stew made with tender stew meat, potatoes, corn, carrots, peas, green beans, and a perfect blend of Italian spices. This delectable stew is easily made in a Dutch oven but can be adapted for a slow cooker. With the use of frozen vegetables and precut stew meat prep work on this recipe is a breeze. I love to serve it with Best Cornbread Recipe or Cheddar Biscuits.\n\nFall is here and it is time for comfort food recipes like stew, chili and soup. This Mulligan Stew is perfect for the season bringing warm tender beef together with wholesome vegetables in a savory beef gravy.\n\nHow do you make Mulligan Stew?\n\nFirst add the flour, onion powder, garlic powder and freshly ground black pepper to a large zipper seal bag and shake to combine. Now add the beef stew meat and shake to coat. Heat a little vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Using a pair of tongs remove the beef one piece at a time and add to the pan reserving any flour mixture left in the bag. Brown the beef on all sides removing to a plate when complete.\n\nNow add a little more vegetable oil to the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until slightly translucent and lightly browned on the edges. Sprinkle in remaining flour and cook for about two minutes stirring constantly. Add the oregano, basil and marjoram and cook for about one half minute stirring continuously. Now stir in the beef broth and cook for a couple of minutes to smooth and thicken the gravy. Add the browned beef back to the pan, cover and place in the oven for about one hour.\n\nThen add the potatoes, corn, carrots, peas and green beans. Now place the pot back in the oven and cook for around 30 minutes or until stew and vegetables are tender.\n\nRecipe notes and helpful tips\n\nBuy good quality beef stew that has been cut from Chuck Roast, Chuck Shoulder, Top Chuck, Bottom Round Roast or Rump Roast.\n\nIf you do not have a Dutch oven prepare all the steps up to placing in the oven in a large skillet. Then transfer to a large deep casserole dish for baking.\n\nNot every potato is equal. For stews and soups red potatoes or gold potatoes are best. They hold their shape and do not break down as easily. Do not use russet potatoes as they will break down and quickly disappear in the gravy.\n\nOther varieties of mixed vegetables will work with this recipe including lima beans, baby peas, brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes.\n\nOther stew and soup recipes you will love!\n\nBeef Bourguignon Recipe\n\nTaco Stew\n\nThe Best Chicken and Dumplings\n\nBrunswick Stew\n\nEasy Hamburger Stew\n\nChicken Stew\n\nOn the hunt for more delicious recipes?

Brown beef on all sides; removing to plate when complete.\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook 3-4 minutes. Sprinkle in remaining flour (1 1/2 tablespoons) and cook for 2 minutes; stirring constantly. Add oregano, basil and marjoram; cook for 30 seconds stirring continuously.

Cover and place in the oven for 1 hour.\n\nAdd potatoes, corn, carrots, peas and green beans to the pot. Place back in the oven and cook for an additional 30 minutes or until stew and vegetables are tender.\n\nNotes\n\nYou should end up with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour after coating the stew meat.
