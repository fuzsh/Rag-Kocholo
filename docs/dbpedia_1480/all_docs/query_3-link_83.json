        "text": "A new york city / Long island based Rock-n-Roll Band . Mulligan Stew has a sound that will blow you away !!\n\nThese considerably young upstarts have instilled in themselves a wide range of musical influences .They bring years of fine tuned experience to the stage . Mulligan Stew has succcesfully captured Rock and Rolls past & present and forged a clear path to the future .This band is by far one of the greatest acts out there right now . Serving up a sound that is so unique,yet universal .Their songs are a high impact,emotional roller coaster ride through the wonderful land of straight up in your face Rock-n-Roll ! Their show will leave you breathless and confirm once and for all that Rock and Roll music is alive and kickin with a brand new twist and a brand new name .......... ~MULLIGAN STEW~\n\n~THE MULLIGAN STEW STORY~\n\nIn their fifth year of entertaining thousands of fans with their unique, emotionally-charged rock sound, Mulligan Stew is poised to explode upon the national music scene. Mulligan Stew was founded in 1995 by John McCarthy, a singer, songwriter, guitarist and keyboard player from the New York City area.\n\nJohn had been playing with several local bands for over ten years before coming up with the idea for Mulligan Stew. Although his previous bands each had promise and had received a certain level of success, they all lacked that special something that makes a good band a great band. John also felt that with a few exceptions, many new rock bands lacked that special something as well. They seemed to be programmed to create music that fit into a certain common mold and lacked the uniqueness that comes when human emotion and experience find their way into the music. John is a big fan and a well-rehearsed student of many different musical genres, including jazz, country, classical, pop, rock, big band and the list goes on. His idea for the new band was to allow all of these different musical influences to take over when writing his music, creating a blend of styles within a rock sound. He not only allowed the different musical influences into his music, but he also put his feelings and emotions into the songs. This created songs with heartfelt lyrics and a stirring, soulful sound. He dubbed his new method of writing a \"stew\".\n\nJohn began writing a few songs in this style. Everyone who heard his new songs agreed that they were fabulous. John knew he was onto something. He now needed to put the rest of the pieces together and form a band. One of his favorite rhythm sections and long-time friends had just become available, Frank Held on the bass and Kenny Fasano on the drums. They needed another guitar player, and Paul Castellano, also an old friend, came on board and completed the picture. They immediately began working together on John's new songs. Although their musical styles were quite similar, each bandmember had their own unique quality that created a good musical tension within the band. The blending of the different bandmembers' ideas and styles also, coincidentally, had a stewish quality to it, leaving no alternative but to name the band Mulligan Stew.\n\nOnce satisfied with their new songs, the band recorded their material, and soon after their first three-song demo debuted. They couldn't make enough of them. The CD's went out to their fans, friends and members of the music industry. The CD's three songs, \"You'll Be There\", \"Back Off\" and \"Lonely Affair\" began to get airplay from various college and major radio stations and quickly became a favorite of WBAB in Long Island. The band began to receive offers from several independent labels but decided that they were better off waiting for a more established label to come along. They believe that they have something special and did not want to sell Mulligan Stew short. The professional representation and marketing that comes with a larger label is the last ingredient that Mulligan Stew needs in order to move onto the next level of success.\n\nThe band keeps getting bigger and better every day, and their fan base has grown along with them to extreme levels. Mulligan Stew has gone from weeknights at lesser-known venues to becoming a big draw on weekends at several popular New York City and Long Island clubs. Their new CD has become wildly successful and has quickly surpassed their previous CD in both demand and accolades.\n\nFor John, Paul, Frank and Kenny everything seems to be perfect this time around. Not only are they all close friends, but they also work well together, and their music is getting better and better. They share a bond established from years of traveling together down music land's road of tough breaks and letdowns. Mulligan Stew's songs are filled with soul-stirring electricity and deep emotion. The heartfelt rhythms, magnificent melodies and poignant lyrics all have those powerful hooks that will capture you and have you humming and playing their music on your stereo and in your head over and over again."
