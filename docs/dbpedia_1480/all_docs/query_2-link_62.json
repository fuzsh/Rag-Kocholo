        "text": "Mulligan Stew originated in the 1900s when homeless hobos collected ingredients and made them into a sort of community stew. Actually, the term “Mulligan” meant Irishman, so it was an Irish type stew, probably influenced by Irish immigrants. Over the years, Mulligan Stew has evolved and is a dish often served in bars, pubs, and some restaurants. It consists of beef and any vegetables that are on hand, as well as Irish stout. Generally the stew has a rich, thick, gravy-type sauce, and bread is essential to serve along with it.\n\nIf you have a multi-cooker, this can be made in it with no extra pans to wash; if not, the prep can be done on the stove and then completed in the slow cooker. Mulligan Stew is quintessential comfort food, and is an excellent hearty winter dish. Since it is essentially Irish, it’s also perfect to serve on St. Patrick’s Day. Irish Soda Bread (a savory version) is a great accompaniment, and a green salad, made with either lettuce or cabbage (very Irish) will round out the meal.\n\n8 Servings\n\n2 pounds beef chuck, brisket, or stew meat cut into 1\" cubes\n\n1/4 cup flour\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n1 12 oz. bottle Irish Stout\n\n4 cups beef stock\n\n1 6 oz. can tomato paste\n\n1 large onion, coarsely diced\n\n4 to 6 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks\n\n1 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks\n\n3 cloves garlic, finely minced\n\nThickener\n\n1 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed with 3 tablespoons cold water\n\nPlace the beef in a bowl.\n\nMix the flour, salt, and pepper; toss with the beef.\n\nHeat the vegetable oil in the pan of a multicooker (or if unavailable a Dutch oven on the stove).\n\nAdd the beef and brown the pieces on all sides.\n\nAdd the stout, beef stock, and tomato paste; bring to a boil and scrape the bottom to remove any fond. If using a pan on the stove, transfer the mixture to a 6-8 quart slow cooker.\n\nAdd the remaining ingredients except thickener.\n\nCover, set the multi-cooker or slow cooker to low, and let cook 4-6 hours or until the vegetables and meat are tender.\n\nTaste for seasoning and add additional salt and pepper if necessary.\n\nStir in the thickener and let cook an additional 15-20 minutes or until thickened.\n\nAmount Per Serving\n\nCalories 381 Calories from Fat 85\n\nPercent Total Calories From:\n\nFat 22% Protein 35% Carb. 39%\n\nNutrient Amount per % Daily\n\nServing Value\n\nTotal Fat 9 g 15%\n\nSaturated Fat 3 g 15%\n\nCholesterol 86 mg 29%\n\nSodium 775 mg 32%\n\nTotal Carbohydrate 37 g 12%\n\nDietary Fiber 2 g 6%\n\nSugars 0 g\n\nProtein 34 g\n\nVitamin A 213% Vitamin C 47% Calcium 0% Iron 31%\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEditor's Picks Articles\n\nTop Ten Articles\n\nPrevious Features\n\nSite Map\n\nContent copyright © 2023 by Karen Hancock.
