It's an American twist on a classic Irish stew, and is the best way to use up all the vegetables in your fridge.\n\nIf you love stew and soup recipes, you'll want to check out our Dublin coddle and our Scotch broth recipe.\n\nJump to:\n\nWhy This Recipe Works\n\nIngredients\n\nVariations\n\nHow to Make\n\nRecipe FAQs\n\nServe\n\nStore\n\nExpert Tips\n\nOther Irish Recipes You'll Love\n\nRecipe\n\nComments\n\nWhy This Recipe Works\n\nThe stewing beef is seared in batches to achieve a deep, dark color. Avoid overcrowding the pan to keep the beef from steaming.\n\nThe pot was deglazed twice, after searing and after sauteing the aromatics, to build more flavor.\n\nThe Mulligan stew was cooked low and slow to achieve the best flavor and texture.\n\nFor an acidic component, canned tomatoes and their juice were added.\n\nThe green beans and cabbage were added at the end for fresh flavor and better texture.\n\nIngredients\n\nMulligan stew takes basic ingredients that you can store in your pantry or fridge. Let's talk about some of the key ingredients.\n\nMeat: Mulligan stew usually uses beef stewing meat or a chuck roast that has been cut up, but it can also use chicken along with the beef.\n\nBroth: We used beef broth for the best flavor, but in a pinch you can use chicken broth or water.\n\nAromatics: We used yellow onion and freshly minced garlic.\n\nVegetables: We used fresh carrots, celery, potatoes, and cabbage. We also used frozen lima beans and frozen thin green beans.\n\nSpices: We kept it simple and used parsley, oregano, basil, Kosher salt, sea salt, and black pepper.\n\nSee recipe card for full information on ingredients and quantities.\n\nVariations\n\nWant to use other fresh vegetables? Try golden potatoes or turnip.\n\nWant to use other frozen vegetables? Try frozen peas and corn.\n\nWant to use other dried spices? Try onion powder, garlic powder, marjoram, bay leaves, dill weed, or cayenne pepper.\n\nWant to use additional meat? Try chicken or ham hocks.\n\nWant to use grain? Try adding pearl barley. This will make it have a silky texture.\n\nHow to Make\n\nGather all the ingredients for the Mulligan stew.\n\nStart by patting dry the cubes of meat with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture then sprinkle on salt and pepper. In a Dutch oven over medium high heat, heat up 1 tablespoon of oil until it starts to smoke. Working in batches, sear the cubes of meat on all surfaces. You'll want a deep, dark color. Plate when done. Add more oil with each batch and repeat the process. When finished, you'll have two plates of seared meat.\n\nOver medium high heat, deglaze the pot with ¼ cup of beef broth by scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden turner to get all the brown bits off. Pour this over the two plates of seared meat. This will help build flavor.\n\n2. Carefully wipe out the Dutch oven with a paper towel. Over medium high heat heat up 1 tablespoon of oil, cook the onion until a nice golden color. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, then add the dried spices and cook for 30 seconds.\n\n3. Deglaze with ¼ cup of beef stock.\n\n4. Add the seared beef cubes and the rest of the beef stock.\n\n5. Cover and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium low and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Make sure to stir it every once in a while.\n\n6. Add the crushed tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, celery, and lima beans. Stir, cover and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\n7. Taste and adjust seasonings. Stir in the cabbage and green beans. Cover and simmer for another 15 minutes.\n\n8. When done, remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Serve while still warm.\n\nRecipe FAQs\n\nWhat is Mulligan stew made of?\n\nThis hearty stew is made of tender stew beef, carrots, celery, potatoes, beans, and cabbage. It is full of vegetables, and is a great way to clean out your vegetable drawer.\n\nWhy do they call it Mulligan stew?\n\nThis stew is an adaption to Irish stew, thus the Irish name. It became popular during the Great Depression in America and was nicknamed Hobo stew. This meal could be assembled with a variety of vegetables, so it's very forgiving.\n\nWhat is the difference between Mulligan stew and Irish stew?\n\nThe main difference between the two stews is the meat. Irish stew uses lamb or mutton, and Mulligan stew uses beef. Mulligan stew also uses a lot of vegetables to clean out the fridge, so the recipe is more flexible.\n\nWhat is a mulligan in food?\n\nA mulligan is a stew that uses all the leftover meat and vegetables you have in your fridge, freezer or pantry. It's a great recipe to use up all your odds and ends before they go bad.\n\nServe\n\nMulligan stew is hearty, so you don't need a lot of other sides, but we do recommend serving it with a crusty brown bread like our Irish brown bread or with a crisp green salad.\n\nIf you're looking for other Irish recipes, make sure to try our recipes for boxty pancakes, boxty bread, Dublin coddle, colcannon, ham and cabbage pie, dingle pie, and pub salad. Also, please all the kids at the table by serving an American St. Patrick's Day dessert: shamrock shake.\n\nStore\n\nMake Ahead: Mulligan stew tastes amazing the second day, so feel free to make all of it the day before. To save time, you might decide just to sear the beef and allow the meat to simmer in the broth along with the aromatics.\n\nLeftovers: This stew will last in the fridge for up to 4 days if properly stored in an airtight container.\n\nFreeze: You can freeze Mulligan stew for up to one month. When ready to use, thaw in the fridge overnight.\n\nReheat: You can reheat the soup in a heavy bottomed pot over medium heat until heated through.\n\nExpert Tips\n\nSear the cubes of stewing beef in batches to achieve a deep dark color and to avoid overcrowding.\n\nTo build more flavor, deglaze the Dutch oven twice: once after searing and again after sautéing the aromatics.\n\nTo achieve the best texture and flavor, cook the Mulligan stew low and slow.\n\nThe canned tomatoes are acidic, and will improve the flavor of the stew over time, making it taste better the next day.\n\nFor the freshest flavor and best texture, the cabbage and green beans were added at the end.\n\nOther Irish Recipes You'll Love\n\nIf you liked this recipe and found it helpful, give it some love by sharing!\n\nFollow us on Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, Threads, and Facebook for more crave-worthy recipes!\n\nThe pleasure of a 5-star review would be greatly appreciated!\n\nRecipe\n\nMulligan Stew\n\nOur homemade Mulligan stew recipe is perfect for a cold dreary day.
