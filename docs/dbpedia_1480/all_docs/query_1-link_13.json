        "text": "Some days just call for a nice, hearty meal. This one-pot mulligan stew recipe packs loads of vegetables and beef into a dish that’s so delish, you’ll want to make it again and again. Even better, it’s one of those recipes that’s designed for customization, so it’s perfect for using up all the fresh and frozen veggies you come across while cleaning out your fridge and freezer.\n\nIngredients for Mulligan Stew\n\nAll-purpose flour: The flour serves as a coating that browns on the beef, and it also helps thicken the gravy in the stew.\n\nBeef stew meat: Stew meat is often a tougher cut of meat, such as round, sirloin, brisket or chuck. The best stew meats have fat or marbling for added flavor.\n\nCanned beef broth: The broth serves as the base liquid in the stew. It also adds major umami.\n\nBay leaves: Bay leaves add subtle layers of flavor and aroma; they’re a little piney and a little spicy. The leaves also contain enzymes that help break down the beef’s proteins. (Just remember to remove them before serving!)\n\nSpices: The garlic salt, oregano, basil and dill in this dish flavor the stew for added deliciousness.\n\nCarrots: Carrots add color and nutrients such as vitamins A and C, as well as potassium and a little calcium and iron.\n\nPotatoes: Potatoes make mulligan stew (or any stew) heartier, like a full meat-and-potatoes dish in just about every bite.\n\nCelery: Celery adds color and texture to the stew.\n\nOnion: The onion adds a little flavor to the gravy and the stew as a whole.\n\nFrozen corn, green beans, lima beans and peas: These frozen veggies are a convenient way to pack more nutrition into the stew, no additional prep needed.\n\nCornstarch: Cornstarch thickens the stew’s liquid, making it better able to stick to the meat and veggies in every spoonful.\n\nFresh parsley: Parsley adds a pop of color as a light garnish for the finished stew.\n\nDirections\n\nStep 1: Cook the meat\n\nIn a bowl, combine the flour and pepper, then toss that mix with the beef cubes. In a Dutch oven, brown the beef in oil. Add the broth, water, bay leaves, garlic salt, oregano, basil and dill, and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat, then cover the pan and simmer until the meat is tender, about two hours.\n\nStep 2: Add the vegetables\n\nAdd the carrots, potatoes, celery and onion, then cover and simmer for an additional 40 minutes. Add the corn, beans and peas, then cover and simmer 15 minutes longer or until the vegetables are tender.\n\nStep 3: Thicken with cornstarch\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and cold water, and mix until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture to the stew. Bring the stew to a boil, then let it boil for two minutes, while stirring. Before serving, remove the bay leaves and sprinkle the parsley on top.\n\nMulligan Stew Variations\n\nTop it with homemade dumplings: Follow the dumpling portion of this shamrock stew recipe, and spoon the dumpling mixture atop the mulligan stew in the last 12 minutes of cooking time. Place the lid back on the Dutch oven and leave it there for 12 to 14 minutes; during this time, the dumplings will cook. Voilà, extra hearty goodness!\n\nAdd stout beer: A stout Irish beer adds flavor and color to the broth for a unique stew. Replace 1/2 cup or so of the beef broth with the same amount of beer.\n\nThrow in some mushrooms: Sliced mushrooms taste incredibly good with beef and in the savory mulligan stew gravy.\n\nTry it with tomato paste: A tablespoon or two of tomato paste adds depth to the flavors in this hearty stew.\n\nHow to Store Mulligan Stew\n\nWhen the stew cools, store it, tightly covered, in the refrigerator, where it will last for three to four days. Transferring it to smaller food-storage containers may make space-saving in the fridge a bit more manageable.\n\nCan you freeze mulligan stew?\n\nWhile the stew does freeze well, the potatoes become a bit starchy and grainy over time. If you know you’re planning to freeze some even when you concoct this dish, cook the stew without potatoes and freeze the no-potato version (or simply cook the dish as usual and just remove the potatoes before freezing). Mulligan stew keeps for about three months when stored in airtight containers in the freezer.\n\nHow do you reheat mulligan stew?\n\nFor the best results, reheat mulligan stew in a saucepan on the stove; microwaves don’t always heat stew ingredients evenly. Thaw frozen stew in the refrigerator the night before you plan to reheat it, then reheat the stew in a saucepan.\n\nMulligan Stew Tips\n\nWhy is it called mulligan stew?\n\nMulligan stew, a staple of the Great Depression era, is a version of an Irish beef stew in which whatever vegetables are handy or common are thrown into the pot. Mulligan, a common Irish surname, made its way into the stew’s name to mean a catch-all, use-what-you-have stew dish virtually anyone can make. During the same era, the meal was sometimes called hobo stew, as it was served in migratory camps.\n\nWhat can I serve with mulligan stew?\n\nMulligan stew is delicious with homemade Irish brown bread—serve it with butter, or whip up some quick biscuits that have just two ingredients! If you prefer something to go with stew and bread, a simple side salad rounds things out, providing crunch in the form of some lettuce and whatever raw vegetable add-ins you choose.\n\nHow can I reduce the sodium?\n\nBeef broth (and many packaged broths or soups) can contain large amounts of sodium. Choose a low-sodium beef broth instead, and replace the garlic salt in this recipe with garlic powder."
