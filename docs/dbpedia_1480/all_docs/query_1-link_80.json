        "text": "This is a crazy book (so far, and I gather in general). I might just like this author, and have to read other things he’s written.\n\nIt’s also a deeply silly book, but (again, so far) it’s done with enough panache and expertise that the silliness is forgivable, and (usually) enjoyable.\n\nOkay, so I did skip over parts of the multiple-page lists of random and silly and self-referential book titles (“…Bitter and Vicious: A Study of the Later Writings of Gilles de Sorentain by H. Poloie; The Vacant Mind by Sue Sunday; Meet Ms. Missy Massy by Ms. Madeline Munck; Repairing Your Tree’s Crotch by Henry Thoreau…”) and periodicals (“…Girls in Garters; Filthy Joke Review; The Journal of Lyrical Abstraction; Senator Street Rag; Steel Teeth; Relevant Dentistry; Varlet…“) things that a fictional character likes (“…sweet Georgia Brown, that ‘certain’ feeling, a black bottom (tsk-tsk), blue room, breezin’ (along with the) breeze, Charmaine (the girl friend), to only do the things he might, a lucky day, Mary “Blue” Lou…”) and so on (and so on).\n\nI mean, every NaNoWriMo author would like a word, eh? :)\n\nAnd I haven’t tried to keep track of how many story-within-a-story levels down we are at any given time. The novel itself begins with various rejection letters about the novel itself, so we start out an infinite number of levels down anyway, sort of.\n\nAnother small amusing thing is that occasionally what should be the first person singular subject, capital “I”, is actually a lowercase “L” (and/or perhaps the numeral one, “1”). Given the nearby discussions of for instance spelling, this could be subtle and intended (pity the poor copy editor!), or it could almost equally well be some sort of OCR error given that I’m reading the e-book in Kindle format.\n\nEvery author in the cascade of embedded authors is also terrible, and the prose is laced with not just clichés, but egregious quotation marks and exclamation points, and even sentences where every phrase is set off by its own commas or (unthoughtof horror) colons. But somehow it’s funny rather than annoying. So far.\n\nAnd then there’s a description of a very fancy restaurant with “murmuring waiters, forks in breast pockets, cordes sanitaires mutely pendulous from trouser flys (the latter one of the many uniquely minuscule touches that distinguish the restaurant)”.\n\nNow, this might be a complete coincidence, but there’s an old and (I thought!) obscure off-color joke about waiters with strings at their flies (“flys”?), whose punchline is “I don’t know about the others, but I use my spoon”. And this would fit perfectly here, and the fact that it’s a fork in the novel would either be a rather poignant twist on the joke, or maybe that’s just how the author heard it.\n\nBut is that really intentional here? Are there enough people who would have picked up on that reference and known that joke, that it’s plausible it’d be written in? Or is the book just written solely for my benefit?\n\nThat’s the kind of thing that postmodern books containing infinitely-self-enclosed stories within stories lead one to think, if one is not careful.\n\nOne is also reminded of the several-paragraph (or several page, I forget) passage of Pynchon, which is entirely a setup for a really awful pun about “young fur-henchmen”, at which one stopped to gape incredulously for a not-insignificant span of time on first reading it in one’s distant vanished youth.\n\nAnyway, I’m going to go read this some more now. Readers are invited to mention in the comments if they’ve ever heard that joke. Or anything else!"
