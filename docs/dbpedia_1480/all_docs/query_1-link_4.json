        "text": "An oldie but a goodie! This hearty and easy recipe for Mulligan Stew features tender beef chunks simmered with carrots and potatoes in a tomato soup broth. This stovetop recipe is perfect for a quick family dinner.\n\nThis stew recipe bears my Mother-in-Law’s name in their church cookbook, and this family recipe is her “claim to fame” among stew recipes.\n\nI always say that church cookbooks are the best because who is going to share a recipe with their whole community with their name attached if it’s terrible? No way, I mean who needs to be judged?\n\nIf you have never made stew before, try this one. It’s a simple and easy-to-follow recipe that you can make in your crock pot or on your stovetop. It is the perfect comfort food that we simply serve with bread and butter.\n\nThis recipe is my hubby’s favorite comfort food, and he especially loves it when it’s snowing and blowing outside. Not that it has to be cold to enjoy this, we eat it year-round!\n\nMulligan Stew\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with classic ingredients like beef, carrots, and potatoes. True stew staples that add flavor, texture, and color to a hearty and nourishing dish. Simmering these ingredients with onions, tomato soup, and some browning sauce creates a savory, wholesome dish that’s bound to be loved by all.\n\nMulligans Stew\n\nThis mulligan stew recipe is a true classic. Thought to have originated in the early 1900’s by American hobos when food was often scarce, this stew was usually made with whatever meat or vegetables people could scrape together.\n\nNowadays our access to food is a little easier but it’s still a great recipe to come back to as food prices increase as you can use whatever you’d like to make this mulligan stew.\n\nIf you love this beef stew recipe you are sure to love these too: Beef and Barley Stew, Ground Beef Ragout, or Beef and Noodles.\n\nMulligan Beef Stew\n\nSimple to prepare with your choice of meat and fresh or frozen vegetables, this mulligan beef stew is very versatile and easily customizable. I’d say it’s also a great ‘clean out the fridge’ kind of stew where you can use whatever leftover ingredients you have at the end of the week. Serve the stew with these Buttermilk Biscuits or this Honey Cornbread and you’ve got the perfect meal.\n\nIngredients for this easy recipe for mulligan stew\n\nFor complete ingredients and instructions scroll to the bottom of this post for the full printable recipe card.\n\nBeef stew meat – Choose your favorite type of stew meat.\n\nOil – I like to use extra virgin olive oil but any kind of oil will work.\n\nSalt and pepper – Add salt and black pepper to taste.\n\nTomato soup – A can of tomato soup adds flavor.\n\nWater – Use 2 cans of the tomato soup can.\n\nCarrots – Sliced carrots add some color and texture.\n\nPotatoes – Any type of potatoes, cubed, add more flavor and texture.\n\nOnion – I used a white onion, chopped, but any type of onion will work.\n\nCelery seed – Celery seed adds more flavor.\n\nKitchen Bouquet – This browning sauce is optional but it does add a deep savory flavor.\n\nI like to add a couple of chopped stalks of celery to mine also. My Mother-in-law uses frozen stew veggies in hers sometimes, too. The other thing that makes this super yummy is if you can find those little frozen pearl onions, but I can’t always find them.\n\nHow to make this mulligan stew recipe\n\nThis one-pot beef stew comes together quickly and easily.\n\nHeat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add stew meat, and season with salt and pepper. Use a wooden spoon to gently stir. Brown meat evenly and stir to remove any of the brown bits at the bottom of the pot. Add Kitchen Bouquet.\n\nReduce heat. Add tomato soup and water, cover, and let simmer for about an hour, or until meat is tender.\n\nAdd carrots, onion, potatoes, and celery seeds. Cover and cook for 30 minutes more. If there is not enough liquid add a little water. If the stew is too thin, cook uncovered to thicken.\n\nLeftover mulligan stew can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the leftovers for up to 3 months. Defrost in the fridge overnight and reheat over the stove or in the microwave.\n\nLove it?

Make it your own!\n\nUse ground beef instead of beef chunks.\n\nTry adding green beans or corn for more veggie goodness.\n\nSubstitute a combination of tomato paste and cold water for the tomato soup.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nIf possible, use a waxy potato which will hold up better in the stew. Russet potatoes may be too starchy and dissolve in the stew but red potatoes will hold up better.\n\nMake slow cooker mulligan stew by letting the ingredients simmer on low in your slow cooker instead of over the stove. Simmer the beef first then place everything in the slow cooker.\n\nFor added flavor stir in a few bay leaves, a few cloves garlic, or Worcestershire sauce.\n\nIf you’d prefer mulligan soup, add beef broth or chicken broth to thin out the stew.\n\nFor a heartier stew add lima beans or any canned beans you happen to have in the pantry.\n\nIf you want a super thick stew you can stir one of the following thickening agents; all-purpose flour or cornstarch.\n\nMore Recipes to Love\n\nOyster Stew\n\nRustic Harvest Stew\n\nTaco Stew\n\nStuffed Pepper Soup\n\nHamburger Soup With Or Without Noodles (pictured above)\n\nThis Mulligan’s Beef Stew is the perfect comfort food.
