        "text": "Mulligan Stew has been a fixture in the Irish/Celtic Music Scene in Chicago since 1978. They got their start playing in several nostalgic locations such as Durty Dicks, Kilkenny Castle Inn, Glenshesk Public House, O’Sullivans, Callahans, Irish Mill Inn & Irish Eyes. More recently you will have seen them playing at many local venues like Abbey Pub, Andys, Claddagh Pub, Curragh, Moher, Celtic Knot, Bridie McKennas, Johnny O’Hagens, Carraig Pub at Gaelic Park, Fifth Province Pub at Irish American Heritage Center and many others as well as Chicago Irish Fest, Gaelic Park Irish Festival, Iowa Irish Fest and Milwaukee Irish Fest.\n\nTheir song selections come from Traditional Irish Music, Irish Drinking Songs, Folk, Rock, Bluegrass & Country Music. Mark is the last remaining original member of the band. The original instrumentation of the group was Vocals, Guitars & Bass. Since then, they have added a fiddle/mandolin player and more recently, percussion."
