        "text": "This is an old fashioned Irish bake seafood and shellfish dish with a French twist. This seafood stew recipe is perfect to showcase the best seafood the Irish coast has to offer. Also, it is a great option for entertaining friends at home and dinner parties as most of the preparation can be done in advance giving you more time to enjoy a glass of wine – a nice cold Muscadet should do the trick!\n\nThis recipe from Chef Cyrille Durand won The Moreau Chablis fish dish award in 2005, so is definitely a must try for seafood lovers.\n\nIngredients:\n\n– 400g new season potatoes\n\n– 2 tomatoes\n\n– 400g of shellfish, cleaned and washed (mussels, razor clams, surfer clams, periwinkles)\n\n– 2 onions, thinly sliced\n\n– 4 x 125g pieces turbot fillet (or monkfish or halibut)\n\n– 4 x 125g seabream fillets (or trout or salmon)\n\n– 125g raw langoustines\n\n– 200ml white wine\n\n– 2 tsp olive oil\n\n– Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n– 85g cold butter, cut into small pieces\n\n– Green asparagus\n\n– Chopped parsley or dill\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Boil the potatoes in their skins for 10 minutes then, when cool enough to handle, peel each potato and cut into slices.\n\n2. Make a nick in the skin of each tomato, plunge into a bowl of boiling water for 12seconds, then remove and, when cool enough to handle, peel, deseed, then chop.\n\n3. Discard any shellfish that are even slightly open or damaged and do not close when tapped against the side of the sink as that means the shellfish is dead.\n\n4. Spread the potatoes, onions in a large ovenproof dish, arrange the fish and shellfish over the top, then add the tomatoes, wine, olive oil and seasoning. Cover and bake for 15 minutes.\n\n5. Peel, shave and blanch your asparagus (2mins in hard boiling salted water then refresh in ice cold water to stop the cooking). Chop your parsley.\n\n6. Remove from the oven and lift out the fish and vegetables on to hot plates or serving dish. Discard any shellfish that have not opened. Pour the cooking liquor into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the pieces of butter and whisk vigorously to emulsify, making a thin sauce. Pour over the fish and place the blanched asparagus and the chopped parsley nicely on the plate.\n\n7. Enjoy while it’s hot!\n\nCyrille Durrand, head chef at The Bacchus Room Killarney, hails from Paris. His culinary skills combine Irish and French cuisine to a very high standard. Cyrille has for 3 years taken part in Good France, a global event with each restaurant putting on a special menu. After the huge success of the first year, Cyrille was invited to the French Embassy in Dublin where he met and dined with the French Ambassador."
