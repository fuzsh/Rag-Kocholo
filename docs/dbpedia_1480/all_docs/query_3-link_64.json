        "text": "Keb’ Mo’ is a charismatic singer/guitarist/ songwriter and four-time GRAMMY Award winner who has consistently made music that reflects his own passions and interests. In the process, he’s earned a reputation for his ability to make deeply expressive, highly personal music. Don’t believe me? Check out the title track (Oklahoma), Put A Woman In Charge (Featuring Rosanne Cash), and Don’t throw it away, a song about plastics with Grammy buddy Taj Mahal.\n\nBut my fave is the first track, I remember you and its first line which he says to the lady in the Red Dress\n\n“My name is Junior and come from Memphis Tennessee”\n\nColin Linden produced the album and infused his love of blues and passion into each and every song.\n\nThis is a very special album. Oklahoma from Keb Mo\n\nKeb guests on Mulligan Stew Radio ckua.com\n\nAnd the complete interview on Mulligan Stew Podcast. Subscribe to Apple Podcasts. Spotify. Google Play.\n\nAs for the music ..\n\nWe remember Mac Rebennack – Dr John\n\nLeeroy Stagger/Black Keyes/Elton John Soundtrack/Brandi Carlile, Little Steven, Vaughn Brothers, Pearl Jam, Rob Plant, Matt Anderson, Beastie Boys and Lots More .\n\nThanks\n\nTerry\n\nPLAYLIST:"
