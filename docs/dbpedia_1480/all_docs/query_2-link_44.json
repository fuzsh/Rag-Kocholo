Others suggest that the word comes from the name of a Canadian chef named Mulligan, who was famous for making stews from whatever ingredients he had on hand.\n\nRegardless of its etymology, Mulligan Stew has a long history in North America. It was a popular dish among hobos and other itinerant workers during the early 20th century, who would often make the stew from whatever ingredients they could scavenge. The dish was also a staple of the logging camps and mining towns of the American West, where it was often made in large cauldrons over open fires.\n\nEarly Recipes\n\nThe earliest recipes for Mulligan Stew were very simple, consisting of little more than meat, potatoes, and onions.
