        "text": "Also known as a community stew, a Mulligan Stew is a tasty way to bring folks together. This beef and potato stew is ideal comfort food on a chilly winter day!\n\nIf ever there was a time for a mulligan, it’s now. 2020 was a bit of a hot mess, wouldn’t you agree? The Great Quarantine was nice in some ways in that I got to spend a lot of time with Laura, Robbie and our two new puppies. But trying to work while also edutaining (that’d be educating + entertaining) a 4-year-old is enough to drive anyone mad. Let’s take a mulligan on 2020 and start the new year with a clean slate!\n\nThe term mulligan is often used in golf when a player gets to take an extra free shot following a particularly bad shot. You basically get to replay the shot. That’s how I feel about 2020. Let’s just put the ball back on the tee and try that year again. (On a related note, did you know that the opposite of a mulligan is a ‘gilligan?’ That’s when an opponent can request that you make a particularly good shot again. Maybe 2021 can be a gilligan year!)\n\nMulligan Stew\n\nDespite the use of the term above, Mulligan Stew is actually not related to golf. Like many recipes, the naming origins of Mulligan Stew are a bit murky. However, it is generally accepted that this stew originates from Ireland where ‘mulligan’ is a stand-in term referring to an Irishman. Mulligan Stew is essentially a classic Irish stew, but with the use of beef instead of mutton.\n\nThis stew is a popular ‘community stew’ where each member of the community contributes part of the recipe. Someone builds a fire for cooking. Someone else finds the meat. Another person rustles up whatever veggies they can find. The finished stew is essentially a catch-all recipe using whatever ingredients are available. A Mulligan Stew is also called a ‘hobo stew’ as it was a popular meal in hobo camps in the early 1900’s. The stew was often cooked in a large can over an open fire.\n\nOther regional variations of the Mulligan Stew are quite popular, too. In Kentucky, the term ‘burgoo’ refers to a communal stew, although burgoo is often spicier than Mulligan Stew. In fact, a study by the Works Progress Administration noted that the concept of burgoo began when a Confederate army cook put “potatoes, tomatoes, onions, some cabbage, twenty-nine blackbirds, three crows, a goose, several hens, and a young pig” in a powder kettle and let the whole thing simmer. Talk about a stew made from whatever you could find!\n\nMulligan Stew has certainly evolved over the years. After all, I don’t think hobos would have had ready access to beef and frozen veggies. And this version is cooked on a stovetop and in the oven rather than over an open fire. I’m sure it could still be cooked over an open fire, but I don’t have a lot of experience in that type of cooking. That, and it’s really flippin’ cold outside right now – I think I’ll stay inside. Nevertheless, the point remains that this stew is a great catch-all recipe that uses whatever ingredients you happen to have on hand. (Thus the use of both fresh and frozen veggies in this recipe.)\n\nAs we head into the new year, I hope this year is much better than the last! Cheers, and I hope you enjoy a good hot bowl of this Mulligan Stew sometime soon!\n\nDid you make this Mulligan Stew at home? Leave a comment, or snap a photo and tag me on Instagram (@Spicedblog). I’d love to see your version!\n\nLooking for other tasty soup and stew recipes? Check out these other favorites, too:\n\nCheeseburger Soup\n\nRibollita (Tuscan White Bean Stew)"
