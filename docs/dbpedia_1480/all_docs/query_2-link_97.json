It’s not too late.\n\nLast year we went to an Irish cooking class. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting much, but thought it would be a fun social event. This class surprised me. It was delicious, comforting, and exceeded our expectations. On a side note, I’m only 3/4 Italian heritage; the rest is a mix of Scotch, Irish, English, and it was fun embracing this cuisine.\n\nThe menu included Irish Stew, Colcannon, Shamrock Salad and a delicious Irish soda bread. I’ll share the recipe for the Irish stew and the Irish soda bread. This makes a great snow day meal, and that’s exactly what we did last week.\n\nIrish Stew – What is it?\n\nSo what is Irish Stew anyway? It’s a true meat and potatoes dish, but a little different from a typical beef stew. Often known as Mulligan Stew, it developed as a meat and vegetable dish sometime in the 17th or 18th century, for farmers and shepherds who would welcome a simply made, hot meal on a damp, cold day.\n\nIrish stew is typically made with beer, and usually no thickener is used to make a more gravy-like stew. Since we are major soup and broth lovers in this house, we love it more broth-like.\n\nThe Irish also relied on cabbage, turnips, and onions, in addition to milk, cheese and beef from cows. You could replace the potatoes with turnips for a low carb stew, but cook only at last twenty to thirty minutes because they cook fast and will turn to a bitter mush.\n\nBeef or Lamb Irish Stew\n\nLamb is more typical in Ireland, but beef is used more in the states. If you love the idea of a lamb stew, you have to make this Hunger Games Lamb Stew I made years ago.\n\nOr go ahead and use lamb for this recipe. Many people don’t give lamb a fighting chance, and a leg of lamb can be very tasty and affordable (Costco has a good price).\n\nBeer for Irish Stew\n\nThe typical beer for the best Irish Stew is Guinness. I was snowed in and used what this beer I found in the fridge. It worked fine. You could also sub with a cup of red wine, but this is Irish stew, so use beer if you can.\n\nIf you can’t use beer for whatever reason, substitute with more beef broth, and 2 tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce.\n\nProcess for Making the Best Irish Stew\n\nJust like all other stew recipes, the meat should be a little marbled, seasoned with salt and pepper and browned really well before adding it to the broth. This stew doesn’t require flouring first, but if you want a thicker stew you can do that.\n\nOnce the meat is browned add garlic and cook for just a minute to bring flavor. Add in remaining vegetables (except potatoes), broth and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, add in the beer. Cook for 30 minutes. Add in bite-sized potatoes and cook for another 60 minutes. I keep the carrots in quite large pieces and put them in from the beginning. If you are going to substitute turnips for potatoes, add them in at the last 30 minutes of cooking or you will have mush.\n\nTips for Best Irish Stew\n\nIrish stew is typically brothy. You can thicken, but our family likes the brothiness.\n\nKeep carrots in large pieces so they don’t get mushy.\n\nAdd potatoes at last 30 minutes. I prefer golden yukons.\n\nMake sure to brown the meat on all sides.\n\nFinish: Taste for seasoning. Add chopped parsley. Serve immediately.\n\nIrish Soda Bread in the Oven\n\nThis recipe for soda bread is glorious. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and just a tad sweet with golden raisins. Feel free to use brown raisins, currents, or dried fruit of choice.\n\nTraditional Vs. This Recipe for Soda Bread\n\nTraditional Recipe: No Butter, Egg or Sugar. Made on top of the stove. (per my Irish Cookbook)\n\nThis Recipe: Baked on oven. Butter in recipe similar to American biscuits.\n\nBoth recipes use flour, buttermilk and baking soda.\n\nTips for Irish Soda Bread\n\nIf you don’t weigh out the flour, please spoon in your measuring cup.\n\nKeep ingredients cold, especially butter.\n\nMix egg into the buttermilk first.\n\nMake your own buttermilk: add a teaspoon distilled vinegar or lemon juice, and wait about 10 minutes.\n\nKeep dough sticky and don’t over-mix. Treat soda bread same way you would treat American biscuits. Sticky is good.\n\nCold butter (pea size) that doesn’t get smeared into the flour. Makes for fluffy inside.\n\nRaisins: I prefer golden raisins, but you can leave them out or replace with other dried fruit.\n\nBest eaten same day, and out of the oven, but can be reheated up to two days.\n\nDon’t wait until St. Patrick’s Day to try these recipes. They are perfect for comfort and chasing away the winter blues. Please leave me a comment, letting me know if you have ever made Irish Stew, and if you have a different version, I’d love to hear about it.\n\nMore Stews from Spinach Tiger\n\nHunger Games Lamb Stew\n\nItalian Beef Stew\n\nVeal Stew with Onion Sauce\n\nBeef Bourguinon\n\nVeal Stew with Turnips and Purple Potatoes\n\nPin This"
