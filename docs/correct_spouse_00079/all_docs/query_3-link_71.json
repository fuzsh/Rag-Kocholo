        "text": "I'm convinced many lawyers are recruiting all wrong because they fundamentally misunderstand how the legal labor market relates to their particular firms. Most attorneys believe that, in order to recruit talent, they must react to the general labor market as it exists right now. This notion is largely wrong. It's wrong because you don't hire markets, you hire individuals. The correct way to recruit is to identify your perfect attorney, define the characterstics of their perfect attorneys, and understand the resulting small recruitment populations so they can effectively market you firm to them. This method is highly proactive and specific, while reacting to the whim of market trends is reactive and general. Generality in hiring is a disaster waiting to happen. Specificity and relentless marketing to your perfect attorney is how you acquire A-level talent.\n\nThe vast majority of law firms are middle-class jobs masquerading as businesses. If that's your vision, that's fine. Your vision is your vision. If you want more than a middle-class job, though, be honest with yourself. You will have to radically change your firm and treat it like an actual business, e.g.: 1. Collect 100% for the work you do. 2. Grade your clients, fire your worst clients, only serve A and B clients. 3. Learn how to market so you can attract your best client. 4. Learn how to sell and close. 5. Change your culture to one of excellence and then maintain it. 6. Keep focused on the basics. Do the boring stuff that works. Do it every day, all day, for decades.\n\nDear Law Student, Between 2000 to 2021, the value of American households increased by approximately $100 trillion. For an imaginary family of 4, that would equate to about $1.7 million in positive net worth. But reality is very different than imagination. The vast majority of families have $0 or negative net worth. On the other hand, a tremendous amount of wealth is concentrated into a few households. What does this have to do with your legal career? The same principle of value concentration applies to individual law firms and lawyers. The vast majority of law firms are either solos (56% of American attorneys are solos) or very small (less than 5 attorneys). Those small firms hold almost no real enterprise value. They are middle-class jobs masquerading as businesses. Enterprise value increases and concentrates when law firms are systemized; have systemized marketing that creates consistent, growing revenues; have healthy profit margins; have cultures that serve clients; have recruiting systems that bring in and retain A-level talent; etc. Now, as you contemplate getting a job after law school, ask yourself: Which type of law firm would you like to join? One with no enterprise value, or one that has done the hard work of creating value? Which type of firm is more likely lift you up during your legal career?\n\nDear Law Student, Looking back on my just-post-law-school days, I wish I had approached interviews very differently. Specifically, in every interview I would have done the following: 1. Read and memorized every single piece of marketing material and web content available. 2. Developed a 1-page personal marketing and rainmaking plan. 3. Asked the question: What can I do on day 1 to bring the most value to your law firm? 4. Developed a 100% fee collection plan. 5. Had 5 ideas about how the law firm could improve its intake process. All $ based stuff. Why? First, because no other candidate would have done any of this. Second, because employers already assume interviewees are smart, so trying to seem really smart wouldn't have been much of a differentiator. Third, law firm owners would be taking a huge risk on me and making a massive investment, and they would deserve assurances they would get a substantial return on that risky investment.\n\nI'm an outsider here (from UT), and I am no bar exam fan (it's a worthless non-differentiator of a test), but couldn't AZ address this attorney-desert problem by making all court appearances virtual upon party request? This way it wouldn't matter where you live in AZ. You could hire an attorney from any part of the state to rep you virtually. Seems like that would open up the market for clients even more. This seems like a less complicated fix than creating yet another program.\n\nJust listened to a mastermind in which they described the method of a venture capital firm to 3X companies it buys in 3 years. They buy a company, then analyze the company's customer data, identify and dissect the best customers, shut off all marketing that is not directed to those best customers, and massively increase marketing spend directed to only the best customers. So brilliant as a strategy for attorneys seeking acquiring clients. But there's more. This is an even more brilliant strategy for law firms owners who want to recruit attorney talent. Go through the same exercise, only with your best attorneys. ID them, dissect them, then, shut off all recruiting non-optimal strategies, and spend all time and resources on strategies directed at your best-attorney profile. That part's easy, though. The hard part would be being patient and only hiring according to your best-attorney profile. Restraint, commitment, and focus is always the hard part.\n\nWhat to wear to church this morning? I have 5 more Napton suits in the works (should get them around September), including some beautiful tweeds just in time for fall, and a white tux that I'm super stoked about. I love being an attorney. I love the intellectual stimulation. I love the colleagues. I love the suits. I think I'll go with the blue Canonico with pink accents. Best feeling fabric ever.\n\nAs far as I can tell, creating a successful law firm requires an interesting mix of (1) arrogance, (2) ignorance, and (3) radical self-awareness. Yeah, I know, seems an odd mix. Here's the deal. Arrogance: You need some arrogance to think you can be successful while so many other attorneys, who are certainly smarter than you, want to grow, but languish as solos or cap out as only marginally profitable players. \"Why do you deserve to be more successful than everyone else? What makes you so special?\" \"Because I'm me. I deserve it because I'm me. I am special.\" Ignorance: You need ignorance because if you know upfront how hard it would be to create a successful law firm, you probably wouldn't do it. I know I wouldn't have. I would have done everything in my power to get a law firm job (even writing those words was painful). Thankfully, I was ignorant. Radical self-awarness: You need radical self-awareness because you suck at what you do, and you need to realize and accept that and then transform yourself into a you who is great at what you do. Not easy this. Most law firm owners honestly never get to the realizing they suck phase, much less the acceptance and transformation phases."
