        "text": "Did Marco Lopez and Mike Stoker ever do any more television sHow is after Emergency?\n\nLopez did, going on to do episodes of The Six Million Dollar Man, MacGuyver, and Murder, She Wrote. Stoker, on the other hand, did not, preferring to return to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, where he retired in 1996, as a Station Captian.\n\nDoes Ernie ever get married in George Lopez?\n\nNot exactly, I mean he doesnt get married but I don't know of they are going to make more George Lopez episodes. But up to the last episode he doesn't. Shorter terms NO."
