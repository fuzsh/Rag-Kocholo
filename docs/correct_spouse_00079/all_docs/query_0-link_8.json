A performer from the start, her parents expressed \"If you don`t become an actress you are missing your call\". Initially however, it seemed that sports would guide her way. At age 5, she was the only girl on her soccer team, which set the stage for a a competitive attitude ready to face any challenge. She started Year-round USS swimming and continued in dance & performance winning the National High School Heisman Trophy Award. Heather became an Epee Fencer and 4 year Varsity Letterman as Captain of the Women`s Team at the University of North Carolina receiving athletic & academic honors. She also competed on the USFA Olympic Circuit. After college Heather took her parents advice and headed West. She began working in Commercials, Film & TV in acting, modeling & stunts. At her first L.A. audition she met her now husband, Marco Khan. The couple was engaged July 4th, 2006 on the set of 10,000 B.C. in Capetown, S.A. and married May 12th, 2007 in Palos Verdes, CA.
