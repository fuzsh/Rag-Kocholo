        "text": "The Khan of Persia's favorite wife has died, and Kublai Khan, emperor of all China, decrees that 17-year-old Princess Kokachin shall replace her. Excited to have been chosen, but scared of such a long journey to a foreign land, the princess feels safe knowing that her escort to Persia will be the great Venetian traveler, Marco Polo. The story is told in diary form, and Princess Kokachin's entries describe her long, dangerous sea voyage plagued by storms, disease, pirate attacks, and visions of monsters. Sheila recreate evocative illustrations re-create a fascinating time when the world was just beginning to be explored."
