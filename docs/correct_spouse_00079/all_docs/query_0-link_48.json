        "text": "I was hunting deer with my dad through the woods of my youth when he asked me if I was writing anything lately. We were sitting for a while on the side of a ridge, overlooking a gully of ferns. Somewhere in the bottom a creek burbled.\n\n“Not really,” I said.\n\nSince before I was an adult, I have been writing. I went to graduate school for it. I was a journalist. I published essays and poems. I became a teacher of writing. Then I mostly quit.\n\nContinue reading… \"Bramble & Din\"\n\nWhen I embarked on writing about threats to the Salish Sea off the northwest coast of Washington state, I read at least as much as I wrote. One author I studied hungrily was Rachel Carson—marine scientist, writer, and editor. Perhaps best known for Silent Spring (1962), she also wrote two earlier books about the ocean. The first one, Under the Sea-Wind (1941) is an account of the interactions of a sea bird (a sanderling), a mackerel, and an eel off the Atlantic coast. The Sea Around Us (1951), serves as a biography of the sea and is noted for both its science and its poetic prose.\n\nContinue reading… \"A Posthumous Conversation with Rachel Carson\"\n\nSitting in the chapel with the coffin in front of us, I suddenly realised the wedding suit I’d given the funeral directors for Frank to wear would be too small. He’d filled out a bit since we were married fourteen years before. I wondered if this was a regular thing at the funeral parlour, trying to squeeze corpses into too tight outfits provided by their loved ones. It made me smile. One last joke with Frank before the flames took him.\n\nContinue reading… \"The Performance of Grief\"\n\nWhat could I do but remove the strips from the package and, one-by-one rinse them under the faucet, dry them on paper towels and finally carve off the top part where the pepper was concentrated? That worked well enough, but I must remember to lay in a supply of non-pepper bacon—probably the maple kind—for the next toddler visit. Or maybe I can begin tempting her over to the dark side. Never too early.\n\nContinue reading… \"Peppercorns – The Tiny Fruit\"\n\nMy story begins, as many stories do, with an invitation.\n\nIt was summer in Lesotho, and I was in my second year of Peace Corps service as a rural high school teacher. My student Nomonde invited me to see her ancestral village and meet her father. Nomonde is Xhosa, a minority ethnic group in Lesotho, where 99 percent of people identify as Basotho and speak the Sesotho language. I said yes immediately. Nomonde was a shy student, and I was honored that she would ask. We made plans to meet under the weeping willow, a rare spot of shade and grass near school grounds.\n\nOur school was next to a dirt road, ten miles of progress connecting a swath of mountain villages to a paved highway. Walk an hour east from the school, and the road ends at Ha Moseneke, a smattering of round mud huts and stone sheep enclosures. Beyond that, the villages are scattered across the mountains, accessible only on foot or horseback. “My ancestral village is just past Ha Moseneke,” Nomonde had said, “We will go there and back in one day.”\n\n“It will be a lovely walk,” I thought, “I’ll wear my summer skirt.”\n\nContinue reading… \"Peach Season\"\n\nWe couldn’t afford both a mortgage and a new septic system for the two small houses by the stream in the town where we intended to live, so we rented, instead, a big, cold house, its hundred-year-old boards creaking at every sweep of wind.\n\nThe two houses had been, together, an affordable deal; in reasonably good shape, and if we’d bought them, we would have had one to rent out and one to live in. All the would-be advisors of my life were saying it was a practical move, as if they didn’t know me at all. Me, a city person who loves the countryside, not an actual country person – that was my husband.\n\nContinue reading… \"Wasps\""
