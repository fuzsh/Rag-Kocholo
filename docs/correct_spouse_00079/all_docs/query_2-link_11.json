        "text": "While cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of most lung cancer cases, lung carcinoma in never smokers account for nearly 20 percent of cases. Never smokers with lung cancer typically present with different molecular profiles from that of smokers, which results in prognostic and therapeutic implications. Molecular changes in NSCLC that have therapeutic significance include mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. These driver mutations typically are present in lung tumors found in never or light smokers. The addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC showed improved survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone, 12.3 vs. 10.3 months respectively. Results from the POINTBREAK trial demonstrated that carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab is an alternative option to carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab, with comparable survival but less toxicity. In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a form of treatment that can lead to robust responses in a subset of patients. The PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown prolonged survival in comparison to docetaxel in patients who previously progressed with chemotherapy, irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Thus, this study combines immunotherapeutic agent atezolozumab with an ant-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, and double platinum therapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed).\n\nView full details\n\nThis trial will study tisotumab vedotin to find out what its side effects are and to see if it works for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). It will test different doses of tisotumab vedotin that are given at different times. It will also compare the side effects and ability to treat tumors of these different doses and schedules. In this study, there will be a safety run-in group of approximately 12 patients that will look at a dose-dense treatment schedule. In a dose-dense schedule, smaller doses are given more frequently. In addition to the safety run-in patients, there will be three groups in the study. One group will get tisotumab vedotin once every 3 weeks (21-day cycles). The two other groups will get tisotumab vedotin once a week for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off (28-day cycles).\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known whether giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together alone is more effective than giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together with bortezomib or lenalidomide in treating follicular lymphoma.

Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Cetuximab may help cisplatin and fluorouracil work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. It may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving cetuximab together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy works in treating immunocompetent patients with stage I (closed to accrual as of 11/3/2008), stage II, (some stage II closed to accrual as of 11/3/2008) or stage III anal cancer.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Blockade of the EGFR results in inhibition of multiple downstream pathways, leading to slowed tumor growth. In addition, these inhibitors may enhance anti-tumor immune responses through uncharacterized mechanisms. While producing significant responses in many settings, EGFR inhibitors also result in significant skin toxicity (rash) in a high percentage of patients. Multiple studies have correlated the presence and severity of rash with clinical response. Unfortunately, severe rash can often lead to dose delays, reductions, or even discontinuation of EGFR inhibitors, thus limiting their efficacy. The mechanism of both the rash and its correlation with tumor response is poorly understood. Skin biopsies display a robust leukocyte infiltrate, but a systematic analysis of the type of infiltrating leukocytes, activation state, or homing receptor expression has not been performed. Chemokines and chemokine receptors control leukocyte trafficking to the skin and other tissue sites, and defined receptor profiles for skin-, gut-, and lung-homing leukocytes are well established. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the homing phenotype of leukocytes from peripheral blood and skin biopsies of patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. The investigators will use RNA microarrays to evaluate the expression of chemokines and other key genes regulated in skin during treatment. The investigators will utilize in vitro methods to investigate effects of EGFR inhibitors on imprinting of T cell tissue-specific homing receptors. The investigators will examine correlations among the pathologic data, clinical findings, and tumor response. If validated, peripheral blood evaluation could potentially be used as a predictive indicator for patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. This study may also identify novel targets for limiting skin toxicity while receiving EGFR inhibitors, thus allowing maximal dosing and clinical response from these agents.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Eligible patients have adenocarcinoma, a type of non-small lung cancer, and must have 1 or more of the following characteristics: be female, be of Asian or Pacific Rim descent and/or be a never smoker. The potential participant's tumor will be examined for Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations. EGFR is a protein that is overexpressed in most non-small cell lung cancers. Some EGFR has been found to have specific mutations and the participant must have one of these mutations in his tumor. Erlotinib blocks this protein and may control tumor growth and increase survival. Previous research has shown that erlotinib is most effective for people who have these specific mutations in the EGFR.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

In particular, it is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A\\*02:01 and/or HLA-A\\*02:06 and a tumor test positive for MAGE A10 protein expression (protein or gene). This trial is a dose escalation trial that will evaluate 3 doses of transduced cells administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen using a 3+3 dose escalation design .The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer cells. When the MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the T cell infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose. Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells back and up to first 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every three months. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years, then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years. Subjects who have a confirmed response or clinical benefit ≥4 weeks after the first T-cell infusion and whose tumor continues to express the appropriate antigen target may be eligible for a second infusion. All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the Interventional Phase of the study, will enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for observation of delayed adverse events. All subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the long-term follow-up phase.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Although radiation therapy to the pelvis has been a standard and important part of treatment for rectal cancer and has been shown to decrease the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area in the pelvis, some patients experience undesirable side effects from the radiation and there have been important advances in chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation which may be of benefit. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, both good and bad, of the standard treatment of chemotherapy and radiation to chemotherapy using a combination regimen known as FOLFOX, (the drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin and leucovorin) and selective use of the standard treatment, depending on response to the FOLFOX. The drugs in the FOLFOX regimen are all FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved and have been used routinely to treat patients with advanced colorectal cancer.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

The study will assess a subject's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype and tumor antigen expression profile. Based on the results, it will be determined if a subject is eligible to be considered for Adaptimmune sponsored clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of genetically changed T cells targeting specific tumor antigens. No treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study. Upon enrollment, subjects will be required to provide a blood sample for HLA subtype analysis. If the results of the analysis match the HLA-A subtypes noted in the inclusion criteria and do not express the HLA subtypes that are exclusionary for the available interventional clinical trial(s), then the subject will be required to provide either an archival tumor specimen or fresh tumor tissue biopsy. The tumor specimen will be screened at a central laboratory for the expression (protein or gene) of multiple antigens which may include, but are not limited to MAGE-A4. Based upon the results of these diagnostic analyses, if eligible, subjects will be referred to an appropriate available interventional clinical trial(s) at the discretion of the Investigator. Following screening, tumor samples will be retained by Adaptimmune for the purpose of developing and validating in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay(s) for antigen expression profiling which is required for regulatory approval of a new therapeutic product indication.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, and certain chemotherapy drugs, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. Chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether high-dose combination chemotherapy and stem cell transplant are more effective than standard-dose combination chemotherapy in treating patients with refractory or relapsed germ cell tumors.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

To exploit the dependence of tumors on glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with solid tumors. This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study enrolling patients with locally-advanced, metastatic and/or refractory solid tumors to receive CB-839 capsules orally twice or three times daily. In Part 2, patients with each of the following diseases will be enrolled: A) Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, B) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (adenocarcinoma), C) Renal Cell Cancer, D) Mesothelioma, E) Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient tumors, F) Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), G) SDH-deficient non-GIST tumors, H) tumors harboring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) or IDH2, and I) cMyc mutation tumors. As an extension of Parts 1 \\& 2, patients will be treated with CB-839 in combination with standard chemotherapy. Combination groups include: Pac-CB, CBE, CB-Erl, CBD, and CB-Cabo. Pac-CB: patients with locally-advanced or metastatic TNBC will be treated with paclitaxel and CB-839. CBE: patients with advanced clear cell RCC or papillary RCC will be treated with everolimus in combination with CB-839. CB-Erl: patients with advanced NSCLC lacking the T790M EGFR mutation will be treated with erlotinib and CB-839. CBD: patients with NSCLC harboring KRAS mutation will be treated with docetaxel and CB-839. CB-Cabo: patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally-advanced, inoperable or metastatic RCC treated with cabozantinib in combination with CB-839. All patients will be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness in later studies), and tumor response.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Results of the first interim analysis of overall survival (OS) are here reported.The design, participants, and primary-endpoint DFS outcomes have been reported for this phase 3, open-label, 1:1 randomised study of atezolizumab (1200 mg q3w; 16 cycles) vs BSC after adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) in adults with completely resected stage IB (≥4 cm)-IIIA NSCLC. Key secondary endpoints included OS in the stage IB-IIIA intent-to-treat (ITT) population and safety in randomised treated patients. The first pre-specified interim analysis of OS was conducted after 251 deaths in the ITT population. Exploratory analyses included OS by baseline PD-L1 expression level (SP263 assay).At a median 45.3 months' follow-up on April 18, 2022, 127 of 507 patients (25%) in the atezolizumab arm and 124 of 498 (24.9%) in the BSC arm had died. The median OS in the ITT population was not estimable; the stratified HR was 0.995 (95% CI 0.78-1.28). The stratified OS HRs (95% CI) were 0.95 (0.74-1.24) in the stage II-IIIA (n=882), 0.71 (0.49-1.03) in the stage II-IIIA PD-L1 TC ≥1% (n=476), and 0.43 (95% CI 0.24-0.78) in the stage II-IIIA PD-L1 TC ≥50% (n=229) populations. Atezolizumab-related adverse event incidences remained unchanged since the previous analysis (grade 3/4 in 53 [10.7%] and grade 5 in 4 [0.8%] of 495 patients, respectively).Although OS remains immature for the ITT population, these data indicate a positive trend favouring atezolizumab in PD-L1 subgroup analyses, primarily driven by the PD-L1 TC ≥50% stage II-IIIA subgroup. No new safety signals were observed after 13 months' additional follow-up. Together, these findings support the positive benefit-risk profile of adjuvant atezolizumab in this setting.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.annonc.2023.07.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 37467930\n\nAbstract\n\nAmong patients with resectable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a perioperative approach that includes both neoadjuvant and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition may provide benefit beyond either approach alone.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Participants with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2 stage) NSCLC were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks, each of which was given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 4 cycles, followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles. The dual primary end points were event-free survival (the time from randomization to the first occurrence of local progression that precluded the planned surgery, unresectable tumor, progression or recurrence, or death) and overall survival. Secondary end points included major pathological response, pathological complete response, and safety.A total of 397 participants were assigned to the pembrolizumab group, and 400 to the placebo group. At the prespecified first interim analysis, the median follow-up was 25.2 months. Event-free survival at 24 months was 62.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001). The estimated 24-month overall survival was 80.9% in the pembrolizumab group and 77.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.02, which did not meet the significance criterion). A major pathological response occurred in 30.2% of the participants in the pembrolizumab group and in 11.0% of those in the placebo group (difference, 19.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 13.9 to 24.7; P<0.0001; threshold, P = 0.0001), and a pathological complete response occurred in 18.1% and 4.0%, respectively (difference, 14.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.1 to 18.7; P<0.0001; threshold, P = 0.0001). Across all treatment phases, 44.9% of the participants in the pembrolizumab group and 37.3% of those in the placebo group had treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher, including 1.0% and 0.8%, respectively, who had grade 5 events.Among patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved event-free survival, major pathological response, and pathological complete response as compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Overall survival did not differ significantly between the groups in this analysis.

Patients with thoracic malignancies are thought to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 given their older age, smoking habits, and pre-existing cardiopulmonary comorbidities, in addition to cancer treatments. We aimed to study the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with thoracic malignancies.The Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration (TERAVOLT) registry is a multicentre observational study composed of a cross-sectional component and a longitudinal cohort component. Eligibility criteria were the presence of any thoracic cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], small-cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumours, and other pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms) and a COVID-19 diagnosis, either laboratory confirmed with RT-PCR, suspected with symptoms and contacts, or radiologically suspected cases with lung imaging features consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and symptoms. Patients of any age, sex, histology, or stage were considered eligible, including those in active treatment and clinical follow-up. Clinical data were extracted from medical records of consecutive patients from Jan 1, 2020, and will be collected until the end of pandemic declared by WHO. Data on demographics, oncological history and comorbidities, COVID-19 diagnosis, and course of illness and clinical outcomes were collected. Associations between demographic or clinical characteristics and outcomes were measured with odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, with sex, age, smoking status, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease included in multivariable analysis. This is a preliminary analysis of the first 200 patients. The registry continues to accept new sites and patient data.Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients with COVID-19 and thoracic cancers from eight countries were identified and included in the TERAVOLT registry; median age was 68·0 years (61·8-75·0) and the majority had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 (142 [72%] of 196 patients), were current or former smokers (159 [81%] of 196), had non-small-cell lung cancer (151 [76%] of 200), and were on therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (147 [74%] of 199), with 112 (57%) of 197 on first-line treatment. 152 (76%) patients were hospitalised and 66 (33%) died. 13 (10%) of 134 patients who met criteria for ICU admission were admitted to ICU; the remaining 121 were hospitalised, but were not admitted to ICU. Univariable analyses revealed that being older than 65 years (OR 1·88, 95% 1·00-3·62), being a current or former smoker (4·24, 1·70-12·95), receiving treatment with chemotherapy alone (2·54, 1·09-6·11), and the presence of any comorbidities (2·65, 1·09-7·46) were associated with increased risk of death. However, in multivariable analysis, only smoking history (OR 3·18, 95% CI 1·11-9·06) was associated with increased risk of death.With an ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, our data suggest high mortality and low admission to intensive care in patients with thoracic cancer. Whether mortality could be reduced with treatment in intensive care remains to be determined. With improved cancer therapeutic options, access to intensive care should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting based on cancer specific mortality and patients' preference.None.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30314-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 32539942\n\nAbstract\n\nActivation of NFE2L2 has been linked to chemoresistance in cell line models. Recently, somatic mutations which activate NFE2L2, including mutations in NFE2L2,KEAP1, or CUL3,have been found to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the impact of these mutations on chemoresistance remains incompletely explored.We investigated the effect of Keap1 deletion on chemoresistance in cell lines from Trp53-based mouse models of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Separately, we identified 51 stage IV NSCLC patients with KEAP1, NFE2L2, or CUL3mutations and a matched cohort of 52 wildtype patients. Time to treatment failure after front line platinum doublet chemotherapy and overall survival was compared between the two groups.Deletion of Keap1 in Trp53-null murine LUAD and LSCC resulted in increased clonogenic survival upon treatment with diverse cytotoxic chemotherapies. In NSCLC patients, median time to treatment failure (TTF) after first line chemotherapy for the KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3-mutant cohort was 2.8 months compared to 8.3 months in the control group (p < 0.0001) Median overall survival (OS) was 11.2 months in the KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3-mutant group and 36.8 months in the control group (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Keap1 deletion confers chemoresistance in murine lung cancer cells. Patients with metastatic NSCLC with mutations in KEAP1, NFE2L2, or CUL3 have shorter time to treatment failure and overall survival after first line platinum doublet chemotherapy compared with matched controls. Novel approaches for improving outcomes in this subset of NSCLC patients are therefore needed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1237\n\nView details for PubMedID 31548347\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are limited treatment options for patients with thymic malignancies. Here we present data supporting treatment with single agent amrubicin, a third generation anthracycline and topoisomerase II inhibitor.This was a phase 2 open-label, single arm trial of amrubicin in patients with thymoma (T) or thymic carcinoma (TC), conducted at two academic institutions. Patients were included if they had received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The first 18 patients received amrubicin at 40 mg/m2 IV days 1-3 repeated every 3-weeks. Due to the high incidence of febrile neutropenia, dosing was subsequently amended to 35 mg/m2 for the final 15 patients.A total of 33 patients (14 T/19 TC) were enrolled from 2011 to 2014. Median number of prior therapies was 2. Best response included 6 partial responses, 21 stable disease, and 6 progressive disease (all TC). Objective response rate was 18% (90% exact binomial CI 8.2%-32.8%; T = 4/14 (29%), TC = 2/19 (11%)). Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (T: 8.3 months; TC: 7.3) and median overall survival was 29.7 months (T: 54.1 months; TC: 18 months). There was a high rate of febrile neutropenia (7 patients) that occurred despite a reduction in amrubicin dose and one related death. Five patients had reduction in LVEF below 50% during the course of treatment resulting in treatment discontinuation in one patient.Amrubicin shows promise as a single agent in heavily pre-treated patients with thymic malignancies. Notable side effects include febrile neutropenia and the use of growth factor support is essential. Further investigation of this agent is warranted.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.09.015\n\nView details for PubMedID 31557562\n\nAbstract\n\nErlotinib is approved for the treatment of all patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but is most active in the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC. Cabozantinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targets MET, VEGFR, RET, ROS1, and AXL, which are implicated in lung cancer tumorigenesis. We compared the efficacy of cabozantinib alone or in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC.This three group, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 37 academic and community oncology practices in the USA. Patients were eligible if they had received one or two previous treatments for advanced non-squamous, EGFR wild-type, NSCLC. Patients were stratified by performance status and line of therapy, and randomly assigned using permuted blocks within strata to receive open-label oral daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg), cabozantinib (60 mg), or erlotinib (150 mg) and cabozantinib (40 mg). Imaging was done every 8 weeks. At the time of radiographic progression, there was optional crossover for patients in either single-drug group to receive combination treatment. The primary endpoint was to compare progression-free survival in patients given erlotinib alone versus cabozantinib alone, and in patients given erlotinib alone versus the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib. We assessed the primary endpoint in the per-protocol population, which was defined as all patients who were eligible, randomly assigned, and received at least one dose of treatment. The safety analysis population included all patients who received study treatment irrespective of eligibility. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01708954.Between Feb 7, 2013, and July 1, 2014, we enrolled and randomly assigned 42 patients to erlotinib treatment, 40 patients to cabozantinib treatment, and 43 patients to erlotinib plus cabozantinib treatment, of whom 111 (89%) in total were included in the primary analysis (erlotinib [n=38], cabozantinib [n=38], erlotinib plus cabozantinib [n=35]). Compared with erlotinib alone (median 1·8 months [95% CI 1·7-2·2]), progression-free survival was significantly improved in the cabozantinib group (4·3 months [3·6-7·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·39, 80% CI 0·27-0·55; one-sided p=0·0003) and in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group (4·7 months [2·4-7·4]; HR 0·37, 0·25-0·53; one-sided p=0·0003). Among participants included in the safety analysis of the erlotinib (n=40), cabozantinib (n=40), and erlotinib plus cabozantinib (n=39) groups, the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (three [8%] cases in the erlotinib group vs three [8%] in the cabozantinib group vs 11 [28%] in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group), hypertension (none vs ten [25%] vs one [3%]), fatigue (five [13%] vs six [15%] vs six [15%]), oral mucositis (none vs four [10%] vs one [3%]), and thromboembolic event (none vs three [8%] vs two [5%]). One death due to respiratory failure occurred in the cabozantinib group, deemed possibly related to either drug, and one death due to pneumonitis occurred in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group, deemed related to either drug or the combination.Despite its small sample size, this trial showed that, in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC, cabozantinib alone or combined with erlotinib has clinically meaningful, superior efficacy to that of erlotinib alone, with additional toxicity that was generally manageable. Cabozantinib-based regimens are promising for further investigation in this patient population.ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30561-7\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000389537700035\n\nView details for PubMedID 27825638\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5154681\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in lung cancer incidence and mortality in the Women's Health Initiative Study, a longitudinal prospective cohort evaluation of postmenopausal women recruited from 40 clinical centers.Lung cancer diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by pathology review. Baseline survey questionnaires collected sociodemographic and health information. Logistic regression models estimated incidence and mortality odds by race/ethnicity adjusted for age, education, calcium/vitamin D, body mass index, smoking (status, age at start, duration, and pack-years), alcohol, family history, oral contraceptive, hormones, physical activity, and diet.The cohort included 129,951 women--108,487 (83%) non-Hispanic white (NHW); 10,892 (8%) non-Hispanic black (NHB); 4,882 (4%) Hispanic; 3,696 (3%) Asian/Pacific Islander (API); 534 (< 1%) American Indian/Alaskan Native; and 1,994 (1%) other. In unadjusted models, Hispanics had 66% lower odds of lung cancer compared with NHW (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.5), followed by API (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.75) and NHB (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.95). In fully adjusted multivariable models, the decreased lung cancer risk for Hispanic compared with NHW women attenuated to the null (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.99). In unadjusted models Hispanic and API women had decreased risk of death compared with NHW women (OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.62] and 0.34 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.75, respectively); however, no racial/ethnic differences were found in risk of lung cancer death in fully adjusted models.Differences in lung cancer incidence and mortality are associated with sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. These findings suggest modifiable exposures and behaviors may contribute to differences in incidence of and mortality by race/ethnicity for postmenopausal women. Interventions focused on these factors may reduce racial/ethnic differences in lung cancer incidence and mortality.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1200/JCO.2015.63.5789\n\nView details for PubMedID 26700122\n\nAbstract\n\nBlockade of the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 pathway has well-established clinical activity across many tumor types. PD-L1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry is emerging as a predictive biomarker of response to these therapies. Here, we examine PD-L1 expression in a thymic epithelial tumor (TET) tissue microarray (TMA).The TMA contained 69 TETs and 17 thymic controls, with each case represented by triplicate cores. The TMA was stained with rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 15; Sino Biological, Beijing, China) to human PD-L1. PD-L1 staining was scored based on intensity as follows: 0 = none, 1 = equivocal/uninterpretable, 2 = weak, and 3 = intermediate-strong. Those cases with all cores scoring three in the epithelial component were categorized as PD-L1 and the remaining as PD-L1.PD-L1 scores were more frequent in TETs than in controls (68.1% versus 17.6%; p = 0.0036). PD-L1 scores and histology were significantly correlated, with higher intensity staining in World Health Organization (WHO). B2/B3/C TETs. Only 14.8% of TETs had PD-L1 staining of associated lymphocytes. In an adjusted analysis (age/sex), PD-L1 TETs had a significantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio: 5.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.13-25.89; p = 0.035) and a trend for worse event-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-9.24; p = 0.064).PD-L1 expression was present in all cases of TETs within the epithelial component but only in a minority in the lymphocytic component. TETs stained more intensely for PD-L1 than in controls, and PD-L1 TETs were associated with more aggressive histology and worse prognosis. This study lends rationale to a clinical trial with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in this rare tumor type.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/JTO.0000000000000429\n\nView details for PubMedID 25402569\n\nAbstract\n\nPrior research in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has shown that tumors with specific driver mutations may be less likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In this analysis, we evaluated the characteristics of patients with durable clinical benefit (DCB) to ICI compared to those with no durable clinical benefit (NDB), with emphasis on the role of molecular alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 and pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).We retrospectively collected clinical characteristics and outcomes for patients who initiated ICI monotherapy for advanced NSCLC at Stanford University between April 2015 and May 2018. Patients were classified as having DCB if time on ICI therapy was greater than or equal to 180 days, or NDB if less than 180 days. Outcomes included best radiographic benefit while on ICI and survival from time of ICI initiation.Of 123 patients treated with ICI for NSCLC, 28 patients had DCB (23%), while 95 had NDB (77%). Median overall survival from initiation of ICI in the 33 patients with molecular alterations in EGFR (n = 31), ALK, or ROS1 and NLR of 5.9 or higher was 2.0 months, compared to 8.1 months in patients with these genomic alterations and NLR less than 5.9. Median overall survival in patients without alterations in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 and NLR of 5.9 or higher was 4.3 months, compared to 12.1 months in patients with NLR less than 5.9 (P = .023).Elevation in pretreatment NLR was associated with significantly lower overall median survival from initiation of ICI, particularly when in combination with NSCLC with alterations in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1. This finding could influence clinical practice as NLR is readily available through routine blood testing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cllc.2024.06.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 38987048\n\nAbstract\n\nAdvances in the multidisciplinary care of early-stage resectable non-small cell lung cancer (rNSCLC) are emerging at an unprecedented pace. Numerous phase 3 trials produced results that have transformed patient outcomes for the better, yet these findings also require important modifications to the patient treatment journey trajectory and re-organization of care pathways. Perhaps most notably, the need for multispecialty collaboration for this patient population has never been greater. These rapid advances have inevitably left us with important gaps in knowledge for which definitive answers will only become available in several years. To this end, the IASLC commissioned a diverse multidisciplinary international expert panel to evaluate the current landscape and provide diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic recommendations for patients with rNSCLC, with particular emphasis on patients with AJCC/UICC TNM 8th edition stage II and III disease. Using a team-based approach, we generated 19 recommendations, of which all but one achieved greater than 85% consensus amongst panel members. A public voting process was initiated, which successfully validated and provided qualitative nuance to our recommendations. Highlights include: 1) the critical importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation of patients with rNSCLC driven by shared clinical decision making of a multispecialty team of expert providers; 2) biomarker testing for rNSCLC; 3) a preference for neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for stage III rNSCLC; 4) equipoise regarding the optimal management of patients with stage II between up-front surgery followed by adjuvant therapy and neoadjuvant/perioperative strategies; and 5) the robust preference for adjuvant targeted therapy for patients with rNSCLC and sensitizing EGFR and ALK tumor alterations. Our primary goals were to provide practical recommendations sensitive to the global differences in biology and resources for patients with rNSCLC, and to provide expert consensus guidance tailored to the individualized patient needs, goals, and preferences in their cancer care journey as these are areas where physicians must make daily clinical decisions in the absence of definitive data. These recommendations will continue to evolve as the treatment landscape for rNSCLC expands and more knowledge is acquired on the best therapeutic approach in specific patient and disease subgroups.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtho.2024.06.010\n\nView details for PubMedID 38901648\n\nAbstract\n\nTargeting the tumor microenvironment may enhance response to immunotherapy (immune checkpoint inhibitors) and improve outcomes for patients. This study tested the safety and efficacy of vorolanib, a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and c-KIT, in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 blockade using nivolumab for refractory thoracic malignancies.This single-arm multicenter study enrolled patients with extensive-stage SCLC, thymic carcinoma, and NSCLC, either naive or had progressed on previous chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors (either primary or acquired resistance). The primary objective of phase 1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and the primary end point for each dose-expansion cohort was the objective response rate.A total of 88 patients were enrolled in phase 1 (n = 11) and dose expansion (n = 77) cohorts. Transaminitis was dose-limiting and expansion proceeded with oral vorolanib 200 mg daily combined with intravenous nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks. The objective response rate per cohort were as follows: NSCLC naive 33% (five of 15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13%-60%), NSCLC primary refractory 5.9% (one of 17, 95% CI: 0%-17.6%), NSCLC acquired resistance 11.1% (two of 18, 95% CI: 0%-27.8%); SCLC 0% (zero of 18), and thymic carcinoma 11% (one of nine, 95% CI: 0%-33%). Disease control rate ranged from 11.1% in SCLC (two of 18, 0%-27.8%) to 66.7 % in thymic carcinoma (six of nine, 95% CI: 33.3%-100%). The most common adverse events were fatigue (32%), aspartate transaminase (27%) and alanine transaminase elevation (25%), and diarrhea (19%). Transaminitis was more common in patients with thymic carcinoma than other tumors.Vorolanib plus nivolumab had a manageable safety profile and may have clinical benefits in various thoracic malignancies. The disease control rate in thymic malignancies warrants further assessment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtocrr.2023.100619\n\nView details for PubMedID 38328473\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10847019\n\nAbstract\n\nDurvalumab improves survival when used as consolidation therapy after chemoradiation (CRT) in patients with stage III NSCLC. However, the optimal consolidation therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant (EGFRmut) stage III NSCLC remains unknown.In this multi-institutional international retrospective analysis across 24 institutions, we evaluated outcomes in patients with stage III EGFRmut NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT followed by consolidation therapy with osimertinib, durvalumab, or observation between 2015 and 2022. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS, primary endpoint) and overall survival (OS, secondary endpoint). Treatment-related adverse events (trAE) during consolidation treatment were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used.Of 136 patients with stage III EGFRmut NSCLC treated with definitive concurrent CRT, 56 received consolidation durvalumab, 33 received consolidation osimertinib, and 47 received observation alone. Baseline characteristics were similar across the 3 cohorts. With a median follow-up of 46 months for the entire cohort, the median duration of treatment was not reached (NR) for osimertinib (Inter-quartile range [IQR]: NR-NR) and was 5.5 (IQR:2.4-10.8) months with durvalumab. After adjusting for nodal status, stage III A/B/C, and age, patients treated with consolidation osimertinib had significantly longer 24-month rwPFS compared to those in the durvalumab or observation cohorts (osimertinib: 86%, durvalumab: 30%, observation: 27%, p<0.001 for both comparisons). There was no difference in rwPFS between durvalumab and the observation cohort. No significant difference in OS across the 3 cohorts was detected, possibly due to the limited follow-up. Any grade trAE occurred in 52% (2 [6.1%] grade ≥3) and 48% (10 [18%] grade ≥3) of patients treated with osimertinib and durvalumab, respectively. Of 45 patients who progressed on consolidation durvalumab, 37 (82%) subsequently received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Of these, 14 (38%) patients developed trAEs including 5 pneumonitis (14%; 2 [5.4%] grade ≥3) and 5 diarrhea (14%; 1 [2.7%] grade ≥3).This study suggests that among patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC with a sensitizing EGFR mutation, consolidation osimertinib was associated with significantly longer rwPFS than durvalumab or observation. No unanticipated safety signals were observed with consolidation osimertinib.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtho.2024.01.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 38278303\n\nAbstract\n\nAmivantamab-vmjw (amivantamab) is a bispecific EGFR/MET antibody approved for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, after prior therapy. However, the benefits and safety of amivantamab in other EGFR-mutation lung cancer, with or without osimertinib, and with concurrent radiation therapy, are less known.We queried the MD Anderson Lung Cancer GEMINI, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and Stanford Cancer Center's database for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with amivantamab, not on a clinical trial. The data analyzed included initial response, duration of treatment, and concomitant radiation safety in overall population and prespecified subgroups.Sixty-one patients received amivantamab. Median age was 65 (31 - 81); 72.1% were female and 77% were patients with never smoking history. Median number of prior lines of therapies were four. Based on tumor's EGFR mutation, 39 patients were in the classical mutation cohort; 15 patients in the Exon20 cohort; and 7 patients in the atypical cohort. Thirty-seven patients (58.7%) received amivantamab concomitantly with osimertinib and 25 patients (39.1%) received concomitant radiation. Fifty-four patients were evaluable for response in the overall population; 19 patients (45.2%) had clinical response and disease control rate (DCR) was 64.3%. In the classical mutation cohort of the 33 evaluable patients, twelve (36.4%) had clinical response and DCR was 48.5%. In the atypical mutation cohort, six of the seven patients (85.7%) had clinical response and DCR was 100%. Of the 13 patient evaluable patients in the Exon 20 cohort, five patients (35.7%) had clinical response and DCR was 64.3%. Adverse events reported with amivantamab use were similar as previously described in product labeling. No additional toxicities were noted when amivantamab was given with radiation and/or osimertinib.Our real-world multi-center analysis demonstrated that amivantamab is a potentially effective treatment option for patients with EGFR mutations outside of Exon 20 insertion mutations. The combination of osimertinib with amivantamab is safe and feasible. Radiation therapy also appears safe when administered sequentially or concurrently with amivantamab.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtho.2023.11.020\n\nView details for PubMedID 38012986\n\nAbstract\n\nAdoption of hypofractionated accelerated radiation therapy (HART) with concurrent chemotherapy has been limited by toxicity concerns. We aimed to describe outcomes of patients treated with HART and concurrent chemotherapy and to evaluate dosimetry to organs at risk to guide patient selection.We evaluated a retrospective cohort of NSCLC patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy with HART (>2.2 Gy per fraction) or standard fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT; 2-2.2 Gy fractions). Dosimetric parameters to key organs at risk were compared, and toxicity, patterns of recurrence and survival were calculated for the cohorts.Fifty-three patients treated with HART were compared with 100 patients treated with SFRT. Median dose per fraction for the HART cohort was 2.75 Gy (range 2.4-3 Gy). HART patients had significantly lower doses to the lung, heart, and esophagus due to patient selection. The HART group and had rates of grade 2+ pneumonitis (9.4 vs. 19%, P = .16) and grade 2+ esophagitis (20.8 vs. 45%, P < .01) that compared favorably to SFRT. Cumulative incidence of in-field recurrence trended lower in the HART cohort (7.6% vs. 23.1%, P = .058). Among the HART group, 88.7% (47/53) met the newly proposed lung constraints based on the degree of hypofractionation CONCLUSION: In select patients with favorable dosimetry to organs at risk, definitive HART with concurrent chemotherapy achieved excellent local control with low toxicity. These results are being used to inform a prospective study on the safety and efficacy of HART with concurrent chemotherapy for select NSCLC patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cllc.2023.11.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 38065707\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with thoracic malignancies who develop COVID-19 infection have a higher hospitalization rate compared to the general population and to those with other cancer types, but how this outcome differs by race and ethnicity is relatively understudied.The TERAVOLT database is an international, multi-center repository of cross-sectional and longitudinal data studying the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with thoracic malignancies. Patients from North America with thoracic malignancies and confirmed COVID-19 infection were included for this analysis of racial and ethnic disparities. Patients with missing race data or races and ethnicities with fewer than 50 patients were excluded from analysis. Multivariable analyses for endpoints of hospitalization and death were performed on these 471 patients.Of the 471 patients, 73% were White and 27% were Black. The majority (90%) were non-Hispanic ethnicity, 5% were Hispanic, and 4% were missing ethnicity data. Black patients were more likely to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≥ 2 (p-value = 0.04). On multivariable analysis, Black patients were more likely than White patients to require hospitalization (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.69, 95% CI: 1.01-2.83, p-value = 0.044). These differences remained across different waves of the pandemic. However, no statistically significant difference in mortality was found between Black and White patients (OR 1.29, 95% CI: 0.69-2.40, p-value = 0.408).Black patients with thoracic malignancies who acquire COVID-19 infection are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization compared to White patients, but there is no significant difference in mortality. The underlying drivers of racial disparity among patients with thoracic malignancies and COVID-19 infection require ongoing investigation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.lungcan.2023.107423\n\nView details for PubMedID 37995456\n\nAbstract\n\nLung cancer among never-smokers accounts for 25% of all lung cancers in the US; recent therapeutic advances have improved survival among patients with initial primary lung cancer (IPLC), who are now at high risk of developing second primary lung cancer (SPLC). As smoking rates continue to decline in the US, it is critical to examine more closely the epidemiology of lung cancer among patients who never smoked, including their risk for SPLC.To estimate and compare the cumulative SPLC incidence among lung cancer survivors who have never smoked vs those who have ever smoked.This population-based prospective cohort study used data from the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), which enrolled participants between April 18, 1993, and December 31, 1996, with follow-up through July 1, 2017. Eligible individuals for this study were aged 45 to 75 years and had complete smoking data at baseline. These participants were followed up for IPLC and further SPLC development through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. The data were analyzed from July 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023.Never-smoking vs ever-smoking exposure at MEC enrollment.The study had 2 primary outcomes: (1) 10-year cumulative incidence of IPLC in the entire study cohort and 10-year cumulative incidence of SPLC among patients with IPLC and (2) standardized incidence ratio (SIR) (calculated as the SPLC incidence divided by the IPLC incidence) by smoking history.Among 211 414 MEC participants, 7161 (3.96%) developed IPLC over 4 038 007 person-years, and 163 (2.28%) developed SPLC over 16 470 person-years. Of the participants with IPLC, the mean (SD) age at cohort enrollment was 63.6 (7.7) years, 4031 (56.3%) were male, and 3131 (43.7%) were female. The 10-year cumulative IPLC incidence was 2.40% (95% CI, 2.31%-2.49%) among ever-smokers, which was 7 times higher than never-smokers (0.34%; 95% CI, 0.30%-0.37%). However, the 10-year cumulative SPLC incidence following IPLC was as high among never-smokers (2.84%; 95% CI, 1.50%-4.18%) as ever-smokers (2.72%; 95% CI, 2.24%-3.20%), which led to a substantially higher SIR for never-smokers (14.50; 95% CI, 8.73-22.65) vs ever-smokers (3.50; 95% CI, 2.95-4.12).The findings indicate that SPLC risk among lung cancer survivors who never smoked is as high as among those with IPLC who ever-smoked, highlighting the need to identify risk factors for SPLC among patients who never smoked and to develop a targeted surveillance strategy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.43278\n\nView details for PubMedID 37966839\n\nAbstract\n\nThe revised 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for lung cancer screening have been shown to reduce disparities in screening eligibility and performance between African American and White individuals vs the 2013 guidelines.

Risk model-based screening may reduce racial and ethnic disparities and improve screening performance, but neither validation of key risk prediction models nor their screening performance has been examined by race and ethnicity.To validate and recalibrate the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial 2012 (PLCOm2012) model-a well-established risk prediction model based on a predominantly White population-across races and ethnicities in the US and evaluate racial and ethnic disparities and screening performance through risk-based screening using PLCOm2012 vs the USPSTF 2021 criteria.In a population-based cohort design, the Multiethnic Cohort Study enrolled participants in 1993-1996, followed up through December 31, 2018. Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2022, to May 19. 2023. A total of 105 261 adults with a smoking history were included.The 6-year lung cancer risk was calculated through recalibrated PLCOm2012 (ie, PLCOm2012-Update) and screening eligibility based on a 6-year risk threshold greater than or equal to 1.3%, yielding similar eligibility as the USPSTF 2021 guidelines.Predictive accuracy, screening eligibility-incidence (E-I) ratio (ie, ratio of the number of eligible to incident cases), and screening performance (sensitivity, specificity, and number needed to screen to detect 1 lung cancer).Of 105 261 participants (60 011 [57.0%] men; mean [SD] age, 59.8 [8.7] years), consisting of 19 258 (18.3%) African American, 27 227 (25.9%) Japanese American, 21 383 (20.3%) Latino, 8368 (7.9%) Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 29 025 (27.6%) White individuals, 1464 (1.4%) developed lung cancer within 6 years from enrollment. The PLCOm2012-Update showed good predictive accuracy across races and ethnicities (area under the curve, 0.72-0.82). The USPSTF 2021 criteria yielded a large disparity among African American individuals, whose E-I ratio was 53% lower vs White individuals (E-I ratio: 9.5 vs 20.3; P < .001). Under the risk-based screening (PLCOm2012-Update 6-year risk ≥1.3%), the disparity between African American and White individuals was substantially reduced (E-I ratio: 15.9 vs 18.4; P < .001), with minimal disparities observed in persons of other minoritized groups, including Japanese American, Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. Risk-based screening yielded superior overall and race and ethnicity-specific performance to the USPSTF 2021 criteria, with higher overall sensitivity (67.2% vs 57.7%) and lower number needed to screen (26 vs 30) at similar specificity (76.6%).The findings of this cohort study suggest that risk-based lung cancer screening can reduce racial and ethnic disparities and improve screening performance across races and ethnicities vs the USPSTF 2021 criteria.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.4447\n\nView details for PubMedID 37883107\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated racism experienced by Asian Americans, especially women and older individuals. Little is known about how discriminatory experiences during the pandemic have influenced health behaviors among Asian Americans. Between 10/2021 and 6/2022, we surveyed 193 Asian American women in the San Francisco area. Participants were asked to report types of discrimination they experienced since March 2020. We explored bivariable associations of discrimination and changes in health behaviors and healthcare utilization. Most women were Chinese American (75%) and over 45-years-old (87%). The top three discriminatory experiences reported were being treated with less respect (60%), being treated unfairly at restaurants/stores (49%), and people acting as if they are better (47%). Chinese American women (vs. non-Chinese Asian American women) reported higher frequencies of being threatened/harassed (40% vs. 22%). Women who reported any discriminatory experience (vs. none) were more likely to report less physical exercise (42.7% vs. 26.3%) and canceling/rescheduling medical appointments (65.0% vs. 45.1%). Our findings begin to elucidate Asian American women's experiences of discrimination since the pandemic and provide evidence of the harmful impacts of anti-Asian racism on health behaviors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10903-023-01558-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 37882970\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent therapeutic advances and screening technologies have improved survival among patients with lung cancer, who are now at high risk of developing second primary lung cancer (SPLC). Recently, an SPLC risk-prediction model (called SPLC-RAT) was developed and validated using data from population-based epidemiological cohorts and clinical trials, but real-world validation has been lacking. The predictive performance of SPLC-RAT was evaluated in a hospital-based cohort of lung cancer survivors.The authors analyzed data from 8448 ever-smoking patients diagnosed with initial primary lung cancer (IPLC) in 1997-2006 at Mayo Clinic, with each patient followed for SPLC through 2018. The predictive performance of SPLC-RAT and further explored the potential of improving SPLC detection through risk model-based surveillance using SPLC-RAT versus existing clinical surveillance guidelines.Of 8448 IPLC patients, 483 (5.7%) developed SPLC over 26,470 person-years. The application of SPLC-RAT showed high discrimination area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 0.81). When the cohort was stratified by a 10-year risk threshold of ≥5.6% (i.e., 80th percentile from the SPLC-RAT development cohort), the observed SPLC incidence was significantly elevated in the high-risk versus low-risk subgroup (13.1% vs. 1.1%, p < 1 × 10-6 ). The risk-based surveillance through SPLC-RAT (≥5.6% threshold) outperformed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines with higher sensitivity (86.4% vs. 79.4%) and specificity (38.9% vs. 30.4%) and required 20% fewer computed tomography follow-ups needed to detect one SPLC (162 vs. 202).In a large, hospital-based cohort, the authors validated the predictive performance of SPLC-RAT in identifying high-risk survivors of SPLC and showed its potential to improve SPLC detection through risk-based surveillance.Lung cancer survivors have a high risk of developing second primary lung cancer (SPLC). However, no evidence-based guidelines for SPLC surveillance are available for lung cancer survivors. Recently, an SPLC risk-prediction model was developed and validated using data from population-based epidemiological cohorts and clinical trials, but real-world validation has been lacking. Using a large, real-world cohort of lung cancer survivors, we showed the high predictive accuracy and risk-stratification ability of the SPLC risk-prediction model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential to enhance efficiency in detecting SPLC using risk model-based surveillance strategies compared to the existing consensus-based clinical guidelines, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cncr.35069\n\nView details for PubMedID 37877788\n\nAbstract\n\nTumor samples from the phase III IMpower010 study were used to compare two programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry assays (VENTANA SP263 and Dako 22C3) for identification of PD-L1 patient subgroups (negative, positive, low, and high expression) and their predictive value for adjuvant atezolizumab compared with best supportive care (BSC) in resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PD-L1 expression was assessed by the SP263 assay, which measured the percentage of tumor cells with any membranous PD-L1 staining, and the 22C3 assay, which scored the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membranous PD-L1 staining.When examining the concordance at the PD-L1-positive threshold (SP263: tumor cell (TC)≥1%; 22C3: tumor proportion score (TPS)≥1%), the results were concordant between assays for 83% of the samples. Similarly, at the PD-L1-high cut-off (SP263: TC≥50%; 22C3: TPS≥50%), the results were concordant between assays for 92% of samples. The disease-free survival benefit of atezolizumab over BSC was comparable between assays for PD-L1-positive (TC≥1% by SP263: HR, 0.58 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.85) vs TPS≥1% by 22C3: HR, 0.65 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.95)) and PD-L1-high (TC≥50% by SP263: HR, 0.27 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.53) vs TPS≥50% by 22C3: HR, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.60)) subgroups.The SP263 and 22C3 assays showed high concordance and a comparable clinical predictive value of atezolizumab at validated PD-L1 thresholds, suggesting that both assays can identify patients with early-stage NSCLC most likely to experience benefit from adjuvant atezolizumab.NCT02486718.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/jitc-2023-007047\n\nView details for PubMedID 37903590\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough osimertinib (osi) has excellent intracranial activity in EGFR-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is no consensus regarding whether to continue osi for central nervous system (CNS) control with second-line chemotherapy (chemo) at the time of systemic progression. We aimed to compare CNS outcomes after first-line osi in patients receiving second-line chemo with or without continuation of osi.We retrospectively reviewed patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with brain metastases (BrM) at the time of initiating first-line osi who experienced progression and started second-line chemo. Cumulative incidence of local and distant CNS progression, and extracranial (EC) progression was calculated from time of second-line chemo initiation with death as a competing risk. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier.We included 52 patients with a median follow up of 9.6 months (range 0.4-36.4). Median OS and CNS progression-free survival (PFS) from the time of starting second-line chemo was 12.5 months (95% CI 8.1-16.9), and 5.3 months (95% CI 3.35-7.26), respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of local, distant CNS progression, any CNS progression, and EC progression was 14.4% (95% CI 4.5-24.2), 42.8% (95% CI 22.8-56.8), 42.8% (95% CI 22.8-56.8) and 66.8% (95% CI 53.5-80.2), respectively. After progression on first-line osi, 25 (48.1%) and 27 patients (51.9%) continued and discontinued osi, respectively. Patients who continued osi had significantly higher BrM burden than those who did not, with 17 (68%), 3 (12%), and 5 (20%) versus 26 (96%), 0, and 1 (3.7%) patient having <10 or >11 parenchymal brain lesions, or leptomeningeal disease (LMD) at the time of second line therapy, respectively (p<0.01). In those who continued osi vs those who did not, median OS (10.8 vs 12.5 months; p = 0.37), median intracranial PFS (5.3 vs 4.8 months; p = 0.99), 1-year cumulative incidence of local (8.4% versus 20 % p = 0.26), and 1-year distant CNS progression (24.8% vs 60%; p = 0.08) was not significantly different. CNS complications such as symptomatic, hospitalizations, and steroid initiation for CNS disease, and progression of LMD were not significantly different between the two groups. Eventually, 10 patients underwent salvage RT post first-line osi and median time to salvage RT was 7.8 months (range 2-9.4). Of patients who underwent salvage RT, 2 patients (20%) had continued osi with second-line chemo. Twelve patients (44.4%) who did not continue osi eventually re-started osi for progressive disease.Patients who continued osi had significantly higher BrM tumor burden. Despite these patients being at higher risk for CNS progression, time to CNS progression and incidence of CNS complications were not significantly different in the two cohorts. Patients who discontinued osi were more likely to undergo salvage RT. Continuation of osi may allow patients to defer salvage RT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.06.888\n\nView details for PubMedID 37784648\n\nAbstract\n\nStereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is used for treating lung tumors but can cause toxic effects, including life-threatening damage to central structures. Retrospective data suggested that small tumors up to 10 cm3 in volume can be well controlled with a biologically effective dose less than 100 Gy.To assess whether individualizing lung SABR dose and fractionation by tumor size, location, and histological characteristics may be associated with local tumor control.This nonrandomized controlled trial (the iSABR trial, so named for individualized SABR) was a phase 2 multicenter trial enrolling participants from November 15, 2011, to December 5, 2018, at academic medical centers in the US and Japan. Data were analyzed from December 9, 2020, to May 10, 2023. Patients were enrolled in 3 groups according to cancer type: initial diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition T1-3N0M0 tumor (group 1), a T1-3N0M0 new primary NSCLC with a history of prior NSCLC or multiple NSCLCs (group 2), or lung metastases from NSCLC or another solid tumor (group 3).Up to 4 tumors were treated with once-daily SABR. The dose ranged from 25 Gy in 1 fraction for peripheral tumors with a volume of 0 to 10 cm3 to 60 Gy in 8 fractions for central tumors with a volume greater than 30 cm3.Per-group freedom from local recurrence (same-lobe recurrence) at 1 year, with censoring at time of distant recurrence, death, or loss to follow-up.In total, 217 unique patients (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 129 [59%] male; 150 [69%] current or former smokers) were enrolled (some multiple times). There were 240 treatment courses: 79 in group 1, 82 in group 2, and 79 in group 3. A total of 285 tumors (211 [74%] peripheral and 74 [26%] central) were treated. The most common dose was 25 Gy in 1 fraction (158 tumors). The median (range) follow-up period was 33 (2-109) months, and the median overall survival was 59 (95% CI, 49-82) months. Freedom from local recurrence at 1 year was 97% (90% CI, 91%-99%) for group 1, 94% (90% CI, 87%-97%) for group 2, and 96% (90% CI, 89%-98%) for group 3. Freedom from local recurrence at 5 years ranged from 83% to 93% in the 3 groups. The proportion of patients with grade 3 to 5 toxic effects was low, at 5% (including a single patient [1%] with grade 5 toxic effects).The results of this nonrandomized controlled trial suggest that individualized SABR (iSABR) used to treat lung tumors may allow minimization of treatment dose and is associated with excellent local control. Individualized dosing should be considered for use in future trials.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01463423.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.3495\n\nView details for PubMedID 37707820\n\nAbstract\n\nThymic epithelial tumors (TETs) are rare neoplasms arising in the mediastinum, including thymic carcinomas and thymomas. Due to their rarity, little is known about the genomic profiles of TETs. Herein, we investigated the genomic characteristics of TETs evaluated in a large comprehensive genomic profiling database in a real-world setting.We included data from two different cohorts: Foundation Medicine Inc. (FMI) in the United States and the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) in Japan. Samples profiled were examined for all classes of alterations in 253 genes targeted across all assays. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) were also evaluated.A total of 794 patients were collected in our study, including 722 cases from FMI and 72 cases from C-CAT. In the FMI data, CDKN2A (39.9%), TP53 (30.2%) and CDKN2B (24.6%) were frequently altered in thymic carcinoma, versus TP53 (7.8%), DNMT3A (6.8%), and CDKN2A (5.8%) in thymoma. TMB-high (≥10 mutations/Mb) and MSI were present in 7.0% and 2.3% of thymic carcinomas, and 1.6% and 0.3% of thymomas, respectively. Within C-CAT data, CDKN2A (38.5%), TP53 (36.5%) and CDKN2B (30.8%) were also frequently altered in thymic carcinoma, while alterations of TSC1, SETD2 and LTK (20.0% each) were found in thymoma.To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort in which genomic alterations, TMB and MSI status of TETs were investigated. Potential targets for treatment previously unbeknownst in TETs are identified in this study, entailing newfound opportunities to advance therapeutic development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.esmoop.2023.101627\n\nView details for PubMedID 37703595\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite recent breakthroughs in therapy, advanced lung cancer still poses a therapeutic challenge. The survival profile of patients with metastatic lung cancer remains poorly understood by metastatic disease type (ie, de novo stage IV vs distant recurrence).To evaluate the association of metastatic disease type on overall survival (OS) among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify potential mechanisms underlying any survival difference.Cohort study of a national US population based at a tertiary referral center in the San Francisco Bay Area using participant data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) who were enrolled between 2002 and 2004 and followed up for up to 7 years as the primary cohort and patient data from Stanford Healthcare (SHC) for diagnoses between 2009 and 2019 and followed up for up to 13 years as the validation cohort. Participants from NLST with de novo metastatic or distant recurrent NSCLC diagnoses were included. Data were analyzed from January 2021 to March 2023.De novo stage IV vs distant recurrent metastatic disease.OS after diagnosis of metastatic disease.The NLST and SHC cohort consisted of 660 and 180 participants, respectively (411 men [62.3%] vs 109 men [60.6%], 602 White participants [91.2%] vs 111 White participants [61.7%], and mean [SD] age of 66.8 [5.5] vs 71.4 [7.9] years at metastasis, respectively). Patients with distant recurrence showed significantly better OS than patients with de novo metastasis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.87; P < .001) in NLST, which was replicated in SHC (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.96; P = .03). In SHC, patients with de novo metastasis more frequently progressed to the bone (63 patients with de novo metastasis [52.5%] vs 19 patients with distant recurrence [31.7%]) or pleura (40 patients with de novo metastasis [33.3%] vs 8 patients with distant recurrence [13.3%]) than patients with distant recurrence and were primarily detected through symptoms (102 patients [85.0%]) as compared with posttreatment surveillance (47 patients [78.3%]) in the latter. The main finding remained consistent after further adjusting for metastasis sites and detection methods.In this cohort study, patients with distant recurrent NSCLC had significantly better OS than those with de novo disease, and the latter group was associated with characteristics that may affect overall survival. This finding can help inform future clinical trial designs to ensure a balance for baseline patient characteristics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.35813\n\nView details for PubMedID 37751203\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: With global adoption of CT lung cancer screening, there is increasing interest to use artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning methods to improve the clinical management process. To enable AI research using an open source, cloud-based, globally distributed, screening CT imaging dataset and computational environment that are compliant with the most stringent international privacy regulations that also protects the intellectual properties of researchers, the International Association of the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) sponsored development of the Early Lung Imaging Confederation (ELIC) resource in 2018. The objective of this report is to describe the updated capabilities of ELIC and illustrate how this resource can be utilized for clinically relevant AI research.METHODS: In this second Phase of the initiative, metadata and screening CT scans from two time points were collected from 100 screening participants in seven countries. An automated deep learning AI lung segmentation algorithm, automated quantitative emphysema metrics, and a quantitative lung nodule volume measurement algorithm were run on these scans.RESULTS: A total of 1,394 CTs were collected from 697 participants. The LAV950 quantitative emphysema metric was found to be potentially useful in distinguishing lung cancer from benign cases using a combined slice thickness ≥ 2.5 mm. Lung nodule volume change measurements had better sensitivity and specificity for classifying malignant from benign lung nodules when applied to solid lung nodules from high quality CT scans.CONCLUSION: These initial experiments demonstrated that ELIC can support deep learning AI and quantitative imaging analyses on diverse and globally distributed cloud-based datasets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtho.2023.08.016\n\nView details for PubMedID 37595684\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.Lung cancer screening has been demonstrated to reduce lung cancer mortality, but its benefits must be weighed against the potential harms of unnecessary procedures, false-positive radiological findings, and overdiagnosis. Individuals at highest risk of lung cancer are more likely to maximize benefits while minimizing harm from screening. Although current lung cancer screening guidelines recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) only consider age and smoking history for screening eligibility, National Comprehensive Cancer Network and other society guidelines recommend screening on the basis of individualized risk assessment including family history, environmental exposures, and presence of chronic lung disease. Risk prediction models have been developed to integrate various risk factors into an individualized risk prediction score. Previous evidence showed that risk prediction model-based screening eligibility could improve sensitivity for detecting lung cancer cases without reducing specificity. Furthermore, recent advances in lung cancer biomarkers have enhanced the performance of risk prediction in identifying lung cancer cases relative to the USPSTF criteria. These risk prediction models can be used to guide shared decision-making discussions before proceeding with lung cancer screening. This study aims to provide a concise overview of these prediction models and the emerging role of biomarker testing in risk prediction to facilitate conversations with patients. The goal was to assist clinicians in assessing individual patient risk, leading to more informed decision making.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1200/JCO.23.01060\n\nView details for PubMedID 37540816\n\nAbstract\n\nOnly around 20-30% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NCSLC) have durable benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Although tissue-based biomarkers (eg, PD-L1) are limited by suboptimal performance, tissue availability, and tumour heterogeneity, radiographic images might holistically capture the underlying cancer biology. We aimed to investigate the application of deep learning on chest CT scans to derive an imaging signature of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and evaluate its added value in the clinical context.In this retrospective modelling study, 976 patients with metastatic, EGFR/ALK negative NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors at MD Anderson and Stanford were enrolled from Jan 1, 2014, to Feb 29, 2020. We built and tested an ensemble deep learning model on pretreatment CTs (Deep-CT) to predict overall survival and progression-free survival after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We also evaluated the added predictive value of the Deep-CT model in the context of existing clinicopathological and radiological metrics.Our Deep-CT model demonstrated robust stratification of patient survival of the MD Anderson testing set, which was validated in the external Stanford set. The performance of the Deep-CT model remained significant on subgroup analyses stratified by PD-L1, histology, age, sex, and race. In univariate analysis, Deep-CT outperformed the conventional risk factors, including histology, smoking status, and PD-L1 expression, and remained an independent predictor after multivariate adjustment. Integrating the Deep-CT model with conventional risk factors demonstrated significantly improved prediction performance, with overall survival C-index increases from 0·70 (clinical model) to 0·75 (composite model) during testing. On the other hand, the deep learning risk scores correlated with some radiomics features, but radiomics alone could not reach the performance level of deep learning, indicating that the deep learning model effectively captured additional imaging patterns beyond known radiomics features.This proof-of-concept study shows that automated profiling of radiographic scans through deep learning can provide orthogonal information independent of existing clinicopathological biomarkers, bringing the goal of precision immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC closer.National Institutes of Health, Mark Foundation Damon Runyon Foundation Physician Scientist Award, MD Anderson Strategic Initiative Development Program, MD Anderson Lung Moon Shot Program, Andrea Mugnaini, and Edward L C Smith.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2589-7500(23)00082-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 37268451\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have never smoked or have tumors with mutations in EGFR generally derive minimal benefit from single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Prior data indicate that adding PD-L1 inhibition to anti-VEGF and cytotoxic chemotherapy may be a promising approach to overcoming immunotherapy resistance in these patients, however prospective validation is needed. This trial in progress (NCT03786692) is evaluating patients with stage IV NSCLC who have never smoked or who have tumors with sensitizing EGFR alterations to determine if a 4-drug combination of atezolizumab, carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab can improve outcomes compared to carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab without atezolizumab.METHODS: This is a randomized, phase II, multicenter study evaluating carboplatin, pemetrexed, bevacizumab with and without atezolizumab in 117 patients with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC. Randomization is 2 to 1 favoring the atezolizumab containing arm. Eligible patients include: 1) those with tumors with sensitizing EGFR alterations in exons 19 or 21 or 2) patients who have never smoked and have wild-type tumors (ie, no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 alterations). Patients are defined as having never smoked if they have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime. Patients with EGFR-mutated tumors must have disease progression or intolerance to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), response rate, duration of response, and time to response.CONCLUSION: This phase II trial is accruing patients at U.S. sites through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). The trial opened in August 2019 and accrual is expected to be completed in the Fall of 2024.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cllc.2023.05.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 37451930\n\nAbstract\n\nSevere pulmonary hemorrhage can occur in patients treated with thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (VEGFi). There is limited understanding of which patients are at risk for toxicity with the combination of thoracic SABR and VEGFis or how the risk differs over either therapy alone.We evaluated a prospectively maintained cohort of 690 patients with 818 pulmonary tumors treated with highly conformal SABR. Rates of any grade and grade-three-plus (G3+) pulmonary hemorrhage were compared between patients treated with or without VEGFi therapy across tumor locations. Outcomes were compared between patients treated with SABR + VEGFi and a propensity-matched cohort of those treated with VEGFi therapy alone.Treatment with VEGFi + SABR was associated with higher rates of G3+ pulmonary hemorrhage compared to those treated with SABR alone for the overall cohort (3-year incidence: 7.9% vs 0.6%, p<0.01) and those with central tumors (19.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.04). When further subdivided, there were significantly higher toxicity rates with VEGFi for the ultracentral (9.0% vs 45.0%, p = 0.044), but not central non-abutting tumors (0.0% vs 1.3% p = 0.69). There was an increased incidence of G3+ hemorrhage in patients treated with VEGFi + SABR compared to VEGFi alone (9.6 vs 1.3%, p=0.04).The combination of VEGFi and SABR was associated with an increased risk of high-grade pulmonary hemorrhage over either therapy alone. Low rates of toxicity were observed when excluding patients with SABR to ultracentral tumors and applying highly conformal SABR techniques.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtho.2023.04.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 37085030\n\nAbstract\n\nCD47 is a tumor antigen that inhibits phagocytosis leading to immune evasion. Anti-CD47 therapy is a promising new immunotherapy across numerous tumor types, but it has not been tested in thymic epithelial tumors (TETs): thymomas and thymic carcinomas. TETs are rare tumors that are difficult to treat, especially with programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 checkpoint inhibitors, owing to the excessive rates of immune-related adverse events. This study investigated the levels of CD47 expression in TETs to explore the possibility of anti-CD47 therapy.A total of 67 thymic tumors (63 thymomas and 4 thymic carcinomas) and 14 benign thymus controls and their clinical data were included. Samples were stained for CD47 expression (rabbit monoclonal antibody SP279, Abcam, Waltham, MA) and scored for both intensity and H-score (intensity multiplied by the percentage of tumor involved). Intensity was defined as follows: 0 = none, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, and 3 = strong. H-scores ranged from 0 to 300. Samples with an intensity score below 2 or an H-score below 150 were considered CD47low, whereas the rest were CD47high.Compared with normal thymic tissues, TETs were more frequently CD47 positive and had significantly higher levels of CD47 expression. CD47 was positive in 79.1% of TETs compared with 57.1% of normal thymus. The level of CD47 expression was 16-fold higher in TETs (mean H-score 75.0 versus 4.6, p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, stage, resection status, and performance status revealed that CD47-high tumors were highly correlated with WHO histology type (p = 0.028). The most frequent CD47high tumors, in contrast to CD47low tumors, were types A (28.6% versus 7.5%) and AB (57.1% versus 13.2%), and the least frequent were B1 (7.1% versus 24.5%), B2 (0% versus 35.8%), B3 (7.1% versus 11.3%), and C (0% versus 7.5%).In contrast to normal thymus, TETs had significantly higher levels of CD47 expression. Tumor samples with high CD47 expression were mostly WHO types A and AB. This is the first study to explore CD47 expression in thymic cancers and lends support for ongoing investigation of anti-CD47 macrophage checkpoint inhibitor therapy in these tumors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtocrr.2023.100498\n\nView details for PubMedID 37020927\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10067933\n\nAbstract\n\nThe 2-year incidence of brain metastases (BrMs) in stage III non-small lung cell cancer (NSCLC) has been estimated to be around 30%. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated considerably lower BrMs rates in this patient population. In this study, we aimed to review the real-world incidence, surveillance, and treatment patterns of BrMs in stage III NSCLC.Using a retrospective single-center study design, we identified patients with stage III NSCLC who received radiation with curative intent over a 10-year period. Outcome variables included BrMs incidence, overall survival (OS), and survival from date of BrMs. Additionally, we assessed patterns of BrMs surveillance in stage III NSCLC and treatment.We identified a total of 279 stage III NSCLC patients, of which 160 with adequate records were included in the final analyses [adenocarcinoma (n = 96), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 53), other histology subtype (n = 11)]. The median OS for the entire cohort was 41 months (95% CI, 28-53), while the median time from BrMs to death was 19 months (95% CI, 9-21). Twenty-three patients (14.4%) received planned surveillance brain MRIs at 6, 12, and 24 months after completion of treatment. The remaining 137 patients (85.6%) received brain MRIs at systemic recurrence (restaging) or when neurologically symptomatic. A total of 37 patients (23%) developed BrMs, with a 2-year cumulative BrMs incidence of 17% (95% CI, 11-23). A higher incidence of BrMs was identified in patients with adenocarcinoma relative to those with squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.01). Similarly, a higher 2-year BrMs incidence was observed in patients who received planned surveillance brain MRI relative to those who did not, although statistical significance was not reached. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treated 29 of BrMs patients (78.4%) and was preferred over WBRT, which treated only 3 patients (8.1%).At our center, BrMs incidence in stage III NSCLC patients was lower than historically reported but notably higher than the incidence described in recent clinical trials. Routine BrMs surveillance potentially allows earlier detection of asymptomatic BrMs. However, asymptomatic BrMs were mostly detected on restaging MRI at the time of recurrence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fonc.2023.1139940\n\nView details for PubMedID 37035171\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10080021\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: EGFR mutations drive a subset of NSCLC. Patients harboring the common EGFR mutations, deletion ofexon 19 and L858R, respond well to osimertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Nevertheless, the effect of osimertinib on NSCLC with atypical EGFR mutations is not well described. This multicenter retrospective study evaluates the efficacy of osimertinib among patients with NSCLC harboring atypical EGFR mutations.Methods: Patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with osimertinib, harboring at least one atypical EGFR mutation, excluding concurrent deletion of exon 19, L858R, or T790M mutations, from six U.S. academic cancer centers were included. Baseline clinical characteristics were collected. The primary end point was the time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) of osimertinib. Objective response rate by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 was also assessed.Results: A total of 50 patients with NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations were identified. The most frequent EGFR mutations were L861Q (40%, n= 18), G719X (28%, n= 14), and exon 20 insertion (14%, n= 7). The median TTD of osimertinib was 9.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5-12.9 mo) overall and 10.7 months (95% CI: 3.2-18.1 mo) in the first-line setting (n= 20). The objective response rate was 31.7% (95% CI: 18.1%-48.1%) overall and 41.2% (95% CI: 18.4%-67.1%) in the first-line setting. The median TTD varied among patients with L861Q (17.2 mo), G719X (7.8 mo), and exon 20 insertion (1.5 mo) mutations.Conclusions: Osimertinib has activity in patients with NSCLC harboring atypical EGFR mutations. Osimertinib activity differs by the type of atypical EGFR-activating mutation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtocrr.2022.100459\n\nView details for PubMedID 36879929\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with metastatic cancer benefit from advance care planning (ACP) conversations. We aimed to improve ACP using a computer model to select high-risk patients, with shorter predicted survival, for conversations with providers and lay care coaches. Outcomes included ACP documentation frequency and end-of-life quality measures.In this study of a quality improvement initiative, providers in four medical oncology clinics received Serious Illness Care Program training. Two clinics (thoracic/genitourinary) participated in an intervention, and two (cutaneous/sarcoma) served as controls. ACP conversations were documented in a centralized form in the electronic medical record. In the intervention, providers and care coaches received weekly e-mails highlighting upcoming clinic patients with < 2 year computer-predicted survival and no prior prognosis documentation. Care coaches contacted these patients for an ACP conversation (excluding prognosis). Providers were asked to discuss and document prognosis.In the four clinics, 4,968 clinic visits by 1,251 patients met inclusion criteria (metastatic cancer with no prognosis previously documented). In their first visit, 28% of patients were high-risk (< 2 year predicted survival). Preintervention, 3% of both intervention and control clinic patients had ACP documentation during a visit. By intervention end (February 2021), 35% of intervention clinic patients had ACP documentation compared with 3% of control clinic patients. Providers' prognosis documentation rate also increased in intervention clinics after the intervention (2%-27% in intervention clinics, P < .0001; 0%-1% in control clinics). End-of-life care intensity was similar in intervention versus control clinics, but patients with ≥ 1 provider ACP edit met fewer high-intensity care measures (P = .04).Combining a computer prognosis model with care coaches increased ACP documentation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1200/OP.22.00128\n\nView details for PubMedID 36395436\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence suggests that consolidation durvalumab confers limited benefits for patients with stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Induction or maintenance EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may optimize definitive treatment, but there are limited data supporting an induction TKI strategy.METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of induction EGFR TKIs administered before concurrent CRT in a retrospective series of patients with unresectable locally advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis was performed on a patient subset using CAPP-seq and correlated with outcomes.RESULTS: Of six patients, three received erlotinib and three osimertinib as induction therapy before CRT. Induction TKIs were administered for a median of 2.5 months. The objective response rate after induction TKI was 83%. One patient had a complete response to induction erlotinib and continued erlotinib for 4 years until local progression, which was treated with CRT. Two patients completed maintenance erlotinib after CRT, and another received consolidation durvalumab. After a median follow-up of 20.5 months, only one patient developed disease recurrence, with rising ctDNA coinciding with recurrence. ctDNA remained undetectable in patients without recurrence, or low-level in a patient receiving maintenance erlotinib. Adverse events were mild and expected, and none developed pneumonitis.CONCLUSION: Induction EGFR TKI before CRT may achieve high disease control rates with promising signs of durability in patients with locally advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. ctDNA analysis after CRT can correlate well with clinical outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to define the role of induction EGFR TKIs in this setting.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ctarc.2022.100659\n\nView details for PubMedID 36427429\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough osimertinib has excellent intracranial activity in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with exon 19 deletion or L858R EGFR alterations, measures of local control of brain metastases are less well-reported. We describe lesion-level outcomes of brain metastases treated with osimertinib alone.We retrospectively reviewed patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with untreated brain metastasis measuring ≥ 5 mm at the time of initiating osimertinib. Cumulative incidence of local recurrence in brain (LRiB) was calculated with death as a competing risk, and univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with LRiB.We included 284 brain metastases from 37 patients. Median follow-up was 20.1 months. On initial MRI after start"
