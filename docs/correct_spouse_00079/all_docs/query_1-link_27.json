        "meta_description": "Petrichor by Heather Trost, released 06 November 2020\n\n1. Let It In\n2. Love It Grows\n3. Tracks To Nowhere\n4. I&#39;ll Think Of You\n5. Jump Into The Fire\n6. VK09\n7. Sunrise\n\nPetrichor is New Mexico-based artist Heather Trost’s second solo full-length. Petrichor is fresh, unique, and really fucking good. Sonically, this modern psychedelic pop music is as experimental as it is accessible. Petrichor was recorded between 2018 and 2019 by Heather Trost and her husband Jeremy Barnes at their home studio. The two are music teachers in the community, urban gardeners, and full-time musicians.\r\n\r\nTrost has an impressive body of work, notably in collaboration with husband Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel) on their own record label Living Music Duplication, and their dazzling and uncategorizable Eastern European folk-influenced band A Hawk And A Hacksaw, where she sings and plays violin, autoharp, keyboards, and other instruments. In the last two decades, Trost has toured and recorded with dozens of artists, including Josephine Foster, Thor Friends, and Swans. Fans of A Hawk And A Hacksaw might be surprised at how different Trost sounds; she describes the difference as working in “two different languages.” Trost explains that “recording music and writing songs reminds me of making a collage or a quilt.”",
