        "text": "Marco Khan (born March 27), also Marco Kahn or Marco Khanlian,[1] is an American actor in Armenian origin.\n\nLife and career[]\n\nKhan was born Marco Khanlian in Tehran, Iran; the son of Anna (née Karamian), and Levon Khanlian.[2] His father was born in Lebanon but was raised in Iran where he met Khan's mother, who was born in Georgia. His parents were both Armenian Iranians. Marco and younger brother, Aleko, left Iran at age 11 in pursuit of higher education. Schooled in Venice, Italy and then in Catalina, California – Marco now calls Los Angeles, California home. At age 17, Marco picked up English as his 5th language and assumed the responsibility as the caretaker for his entire family. While operating a series of restaurants for 12 years to support his family, Marco enjoyed brief stints as a Professional Athlete in Football, American football and Wrestling.\n\nAfter his father died, he decided to pursue his lifelong passion of becoming an actor. His looks, talent, and diverse background have allowed Marco to play a variety of interesting characters. He is a versatile actor achieving success in comedy, action and drama. Despite his \"tough guy\" appearance, his demeanor is quiet, gentle, gracious and sincere. As a father he loves children and animals. Almost everyone who meets Marco agrees that there is \"Just something special that draws you towards him\". He is a kind and tolerant humanitarian who is relentless in his pursuit for peace. Always positive & encouraging to others, \"Never Give Up\" is the motto he lives by. Marco is a true believer that everything happens for a reason, that tests and trials in life shape your character & that his destiny is in God's hands.[3]\n\nMarco Khan currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife Heather Blair Khan and his son Alekzander.[4] He has no previous wives.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilms[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2009 2012 Preacher 2008 The Grind 2nd Punisher Iron Man Insurgent #4 10,000 BC One-Eye 2007 Assassin Assassin/Jon 2006 One Night with You Alvin Ghost Hunters: Point of Contact — The Champ The Brute Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Turkish Guard Click Habeeboo Entourage Hollywood Kills The Assistant SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate Male Bulgarian #1 Video Game / Voice / Credited As: Marco Kahn 2005 Pissed Bodyguard Credited As: Marco Khanlian Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World Pakistani Comedian American Fusion Jeremy Credited As: Marco Khanlian Pit Fighter Russian wrestler 2004 September Tapes Kidnapper 2003 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Turkish Guard #1 Date or Disaster Dater 2002 In the Wrong Hands Rocky Credited As: Marco Khanlian 2001 15 Minutes Emigrant Credited As: Marco Kahn 2000 Women of the Night Rand Credited As: Marco Kahn 1998 Columbo: Ashes to Ashes Guard #2 Television\n\nCredited As: Marco Khanlian The Howling Leopard Hoss Credited As: Marco Khanlian Crossfire Thug #2 Credited As: Marco Khanlian 1996 American Tigers Navy Seal Credited As: Marco Khanlian\n\nTelevision[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2003-2004 JAG Terrorist \"Trojan Horse\" (2004)\n\n\"Second Acts\" (2003)\n\nUncredited 2004 Charmed Thief #1 \"I Dream of Phoebe\" (2004) 2001 Passion Cove Wrestler #2 \"Silent Night\" (2001)\n\nCredited As: Marco Kahn\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:Title without disambig at the Internet Movie Database"
