        "text": "Background and Origin of Marco Polo\n\nOne of the reasons why Marco Polo was able to carry out such a long journey across the Eurasian landmass was his family's professional background. Both his father and uncle were merchants. Merchants traveled along the Silk Road between Europe and Asia at this time. The Polo family was involved in trade with the Middle East. As a result, Niccolò, the father, and Maffeo, the uncle, both had excellent professional reputations and wealth. In 1271, the three men left Venice. Venice was their home base and likely where the young Marco grew up. Venice was also one of the most successful and wealthy Italian city-states.\n\nA city-state is a city with self-government and sovereignty in the political, social, and cultural realm. City-states were the main form of political organization in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\n\nThe Polos' four-year journey to China occurred in a changing global context. Constantinople was under the control of western crusaders since 1204. The Polos sold their property approximately in 1260 and invested in jewels instead. They seemed to have understood that political changes were coming. Indeed, Michael VIII Palaeologus overthrew the crusaders and established his rule in 1261.\n\nMarco's father and uncle journeyed to the Volga River, controlled by the Mongol Empire at this time. Berke Khan ruled this part of the Empire. The two elder Polos could stay at the Khan's court, where they multiplied their wealth. However, they could not return to Venice due to the political situation.\n\nThe two Polos decided to travel in the opposite direction—eastward—and likely stopped at Xanadu (Shangdu), in present-day China. They managed to cultivate an amicable relationship with Kublai Khan, the ruler of the vast Mongol Empire. Indeed, the Khan liked the Polos so much that he sent them back to Europe, where they operated as his ambassadors.\n\nThe Travels of Marco Polo\n\nMarco Polo, along with his father and uncle, departed from Venice when he was only 17 years old in 1271. Whereas the Polos initially traveled by boat to Persia (Iran) in the Mediterranean, most of the journey occurred over land. The Polos traveled through the Mongol Empire to China and possibly Beijing, the winter capital.\n\nMarco Polo stayed in China at the court of Kublai Khan until approximately 1291. During his stay, he learned Chinese and held diplomatic positions traveling throughout Southeast Asia on assignments for the great Khan. His last assignment was to take a princess to Persia to marry Arghun Khan.\n\nIn 1295, Marco was back in his hometown, Venice. The total distance traveled by the Polos came close to 24,000 kilometers (15,000 miles).\n\nMarco Polo: Biography and Timeline\n\n1254: Marco Polo was born in Venice.\n\n1260: Marco's father, Niccolò, and uncle, Maffeo, left their residence in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey).\n\n1265: Marco's father and uncle traveled east through Bukhara (Uzbekistan) and spent time at Xanadu (Shangdu), present-day China.\n\n1269: Marco's father and uncle returned to their hometown, Venice.\n\n1271: Marco, his father, and his uncle departed from Venice and traveled across Eurasia.\n\n1272: The Polos passed through Erzurum (eastern Turkey) and Tabriz (northern Iran) and arrived at Hormuz (Persian Gulf).\n\n1272-3: The Polos travel through Afghanistan, Pakistan, and possibly Kashmir. They used the Silk Road to reach China.\n\n1274: Traveling approximately 8,000 km, the Polos arrived in China (Cathay). They met Kublai Khan in Shangdu, the summer capital, bringing with them papal letters. Marco studied the Chinese language.\n\n1275: Marco Polo became an envoy for the great Khan. He traveled as a diplomat throughout Southeast Asia (Vietnam, India, Burma, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka). Marco may have also stayed in Beijing, Kublai Khan's winter residence.\n\n1280: Marco Polo may have also become the governor of Yangzhou.\n\n1291: Marco Polo headed back to Europe, accompanying princessKököchin scheduled to marry Arghun Khan in Persia.\n\n1293: The Polos arrived in Persia, then headed to Constantinople.\n\n1295: Marco Polo returned to Venice.\n\n1298: Marco Polo was imprisoned during a war between Venice and its rival, Genoa. He dictated a book about his travels in prison to another inmate, Rustichello da Pisa, who was a professional writer. The Travels of Marco Polo is a combination of fact and fiction embellished by Marco and his ghostwriter.\n\n1299: Marco Polo left prison.\n\n1300: Donata Badoer and Marco Polo were married.\n\n1324: The death of Marco Polo.\n\nThe Silk Road (130 BCE-1453) comprised several trade routes used to connect Europe to Asia at this time."
