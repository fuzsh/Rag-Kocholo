        "text": "In Marco Polo’s own record, he, his father Niccolo, and his uncle Maffeo, were so loved by the Great Khan Khubilai that he wouldn’t let the three go home. However, when they came back from their travels to India, they encountered three messengers who were sent from Persia by the Ilkhan Argun. These three messengers were sent to the Great Khan to ask for a lady from the deceased Queen Bulughan’s tribe to marry, because this was the queen’s dying will. Therefore, the Great Khan sent a lady named Kokechin, belonging to the queen’s lineage, who was allegedly “young (17years), very fine and attractive.”[1] Accordingly, the three messengers had found the three Polos exceedingly interesting, for they were both “Latin and wise,” and wanted the three Polos to go with them by sea.[2] Then, they “went to the Great Khan and asked that he grant them the favor of sending them by sea, and of sending the three Latins with them,” to which the Great Khan, knowing that this would be the final farewell with the three, reluctantly agreed.[3] Furthermore, it was said that the Khubilai Khan summoned the three and offered them authority to cross the lands before they embarked on their voyage, as well as a handful of resources, including 14 ships.[4] “They said a good 18 months on the Indian Sea,” as provided by Marco Polo, and arrived in Persia. However, upon their arrival in Persia, they found that Argun was dead already, so the lady was given to his son Gasan instead. This first-hand record was found in sessions 18 and 19 of the prologue to his book The Description of the World, or The Travels of Marco Polo, and has indeed been placed under much scrutiny and skepticism.\n\nHowever, an immediate rebut to this source, provided by Francis Woodman Cleaves in his article A Chinese Source Bearing on Marco Polo’s Departure From China and a Persian Source on His Arrival in Persia, stated that the identification of Xvajah in the Persian text with the Coja of Marco Polo could not be firmly established. Francis further remarked that this name appeared neither in the index to Karl Jahn’s edition of the Collection of Histories, nor in that to Ali-Zade’s as a proper name. Moreover, in one occasion, Arends rendered the name as “official,” regarding it as a common noun.[1] Additionally, it is noted at one point in Marco Polo Went To China that this entire episode regarding princess Kokechin and the Persian envoys did not appear at all in the official history of the Yuan dynasty,元史 (Yuan shi).[10] Not to mention the fact that no Chinese sources ever mentioned any being of Marco Polo in their accounts.\n\nFurthermore, given the suspiciously uneven record of this event across different sources, Frances Wood pointed out, in her 1995 bookDid Marco Polo Go To China, the fact that stories like this one–Marco Polo’s return to the West by accompanying the Mongol princess Kokechin to Persia to marry the Ilkhan–could very well have been borrowed from another source, for instance, the Yongle Encyclopedia and the Collection of Histories.[11] Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a sufficient enough explanation to the mystery of Marco Polo’s absence in all these other sources.\n\nIn addition, it is well confirmed that Khubilai Khan’s embassy to his grand-nephew the Ilkhan Argun, Mongol ruler of Persia, in the early 1290s, was not recorded in any of the histories of the Yuan dynasty. And moreover, the existence of a princess Kokechin is nowhere to be found in the Chinese sources. However, to refute this argument of absent proof, Igor de Rachewiltz argued that due to how private and delicate this issue related to internal marital affairs was, it is reasonable that the voyage was not recorded in official documents.[12] Yet, this argument is somewhat weak, because countless evidence of other internal family affairs being recorded in official histories of China undermines the possibility of purposeful emittance.\n\nLast but not least, the exact date of this event’s occurrence was a persistently debated issue. Originally, it was assumed that the departure of Marco Polo from China took place in 1292. This is because, as Yule did, the year of Marco Polo’s departure was calculated from the year 1275, the year that Marco Polo allegedly arrived in China. This was added 17 years, because Marco Polo stated that he stayed in China for 17 years. However, Paul Pelliot provided in his Notes on Marco Polo that the exact time was actually more probably early 1291.[13] In A Chinese Source Bearing on Marco Polo’s Departure From China and a Persian Source on His Arrival in Persia, Francis Woodman Cleaves elaborated on this notion, and said that Pelliot had apparently used a method of “inverse reasoning.”[14] This had led Pelliot to conclude that “the travellers crossed the western Indian Ocean in the winter of 1292-1293,” and since “it took them three months to sail from Zaitun to Sumatra, where they waited five months before crossing the Indian Ocean, they must have left China not in 1292 but early in 1291.”[15]"
