        "text": "Anirudh Kanisetti\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n1 min read\n\n·\n\nJun 16, 2017\n\n--\n\nMarco Polo claims that Kublai Khan dined with 6,000 beautiful women every night and received 100,000 horses and 5,000 elephants in tribute every year. He also came from one of Europe’s most important trading centers, Venice. Pardon me if I doubt he’s anywhere near as credible as a trained historical economist as Dr. Tirthankar Roy.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you! But this is indeed nitpicking. I don’t mean India “entered” in a literal sense but in a figurative sense as European interests shifted from buying finished goods to raw goods. And the death of the last Great Mughal did not automatically lead to European dominance — the shift that I described took nearly 150 years, after which handicrafts entered a steep decline."
