        "text": "Despite being cancelled on a cliffhanger ending, HBO’s Marco Polo remains well liked by fans. I watched it during lock-down, and despite occasionally cringing at some of the characterisation, enjoyed it for the most part. The lavish set design and costumes give the show a genuine feeling, and the show-runners drew on a wealth of exciting history when they wrote the series. But just how historically accurate is Marco Polo?\n\nI’d like to preface this by saying that I neither want nor expect a total devotion to history in shows like Marco Polo. Though this is going to contain some criticism of the show, I mostly want to use it to discuss some genuinely fascinating history. All dramas based on real historical events require a bit of gap filling, and the introduction of plot elements to make the story more satisfying is far more effective for television than a dry historical reenactment. Similarly, the introduction of new characters tends to be positive, especially in the case of developed female characters in male dominated societies. These are all changes any good show-runner would make to justify recreating the story for a modern audience.\n\nSome of the changes, however, are slightly more baffling, and betray some strange modern storytelling tropes that have made their way into this ancient narrative.\n\nKublai Khan\n\nFirst, the positives. Benedict Wong was the perfect actor for Kublai, and gave a brilliant performance. I’d previously only seen him as the sidekick in Dr Strange, and now I want to see him in literally everything else. He stole the show whenever he was on screen, to the point where it should almost have been titled HBO’s Kublai Khan, rather than Marco Polo.\n\nThe characterisation of Kublai on the show, however, always struck me as slightly odd. The show-runners seem to have leaned very heavily on the “barbarian king” angle, with Kublai grunting his way through dialogue and seeming to all the world like a bull in a china shop in his lavish Chinese halls. He is portrayed as a ruler who stumbled on high culture more or less by accident, and the few times his intelligence shines through it is military cunning, not statesmanship. His preference for violence over diplomacy is evident throughout. Show Kublai disdains weakness and the womanly arts, and is constantly being outmanoeuvred by his more “civilised” opponents, whose honeyed words contrast with the grunting Khan.\n\nThe real Kublai Khan was, in many ways, a refutation of the reputation of mongols as uncultured barbarians.\n\nKublai Khan was a prolific writer of Chinese poetry, a hobby likely picked up during one of his many pilgrimages to Buddhist monasteries, a culture and religion that apparently fascinated the Khan from an early age. For reference, here is a verse from one of his surviving poems:\n\nI ascended on Fragrant Hill in the friendly season of spring\n\nNot discouraged I climbed to the peak and met the Golden Face\n\nFlowers shone bright rays and auspicious colours gleamed like a rainbow\n\nIncense smoke wafted like mist and a blessed light emanated\n\nQuite a difference than the grunting Kublai of the show!\n\nI think part of the reason for the portrayal of Kublai Khan on the show is that modern sensibilities struggle with the idea that a brutal military leader can also be a cultured poet and patron of the arts, despite that being an expectation of rulers in many nations throughout history. In a Western world so thoroughly detached from the near constant warfare of the past, we tend to compartmentalise these things, and view war and art as diametrically opposed. In the past, however, before the development of industrialised warfare and its inescapable and total destruction, war was simply viewed as a fact of life. Military prowess was an expectation of rulers, especially Mongol rulers, and differing standards of brutality from modern day can lead to a view of a ruler like Kublai, who was praised (and even criticised!) for his tolerance at the time to be portrayed as a stereotypical barbarian.\n\nThe true history of Kublai Khan’s conquest and administration of China, and subsequent invasions as far afield as Japan, Korea, Vietnam and even Indonesia, are utterly fascinating, and far too long to tell here. Kublai was clearly an ambitious conqueror, but also a conscientious statesmen. Under his rule China adopted paper currency, built thousands of schools and hospitals, undertook massive civic infrastructure projects, and adopted doctrines of religious tolerance. A high proportion of Kublai’s ministers and governors were Muslims (who also brought the Mongols and China Islamic medicine and engineering), and despite favouring Buddhism, Taoists were appointed to high positions within Kublai’s government. There is a good reason why the dynasty Kublai founded is regarded highly within China’s history.\n\nMarco Polo, and why everyone on the show knows Kung Fu\n\nMarco Polo, the point of view character for most of the show and eponymous protagonist, is another case of modern sensibilities entering into the show in a negative way. While much of his early story is essentially accurate, the writers make the odd decision to have him and several other seemingly random characters become martial arts experts and kick-flipping warrior monks.\n\nThis trend, of everyone from ministers to courtesans being Kung Fu experts, is a sign of two larger problems with American historical dramas.\n\nThe first is blatant Orientalism. Why does everyone know Kung Fu, and fight as though they were trying out for the Olympic acrobatics team? Because they are Asian, of course, and Medieval Asian warriors must engage in combat as though it were a complex and spiritual dance, instead of just braining each other with halberds like the rest of us. Chinese weapons of this period were chiefly big sticks with spikes on them, and were used in more or less the same way as they were in the rest of the world.\n\nThe wider problem is that American historical dramas never seem to know what to do with characters whose skills lie outside combat. Marco Polo was a merchant and storyteller, Jiao Sidao was a statesmen and bureaucrat, and the several Kung Fu courtesans were, well, courtesans. But rather than showing their worth through intelligence or charisma, they end up fighting ten to one against hapless foot soldiers, because the show seems unable to think of anything else to do with them. This is especially egregious in the case of Jiao Sidao, a civilian minister and the leader of the Song Chinese in the show, whose death comes after the equivalent of a Kung Fu boss fight, and who kills trained soldiers in literal hand to hand combat to prove himself to his army. The exception to this rule is Ahmad, Kublai’s traitorous finance minister, who manages to handle himself through through cunning rather than Kung Fu, and is a far more compelling villain because of it (though the show does give him an exotic bodyguard who bizarrely demonstrates his badassery by stabbing himself in the leg). The character Ahmad was based on was famous for his corruption, hence being adopted as a villain for the show. As far as I can tell his strange psycho-sexual issues, and motivations for villainy in general, are inventions of the show, but he’s fun enough on screen that I’m not going to hold it against them. In real life, Kublai only discovered his corruption and embezzlement (rather than treachery) after his assassination at the hands of a rival court faction, and had his tomb desecrated in response. One positive recipient of the show’s warfare obsession is Khutulun, the Mongolian warrior princess, who was a real figure, who really did refuse to marry anyone who could not defeat her in a wresting match, and ride into battle alongside the men. It seems likely that her father also really did intend that she be his heir, and the first female Mongolian Khan in history, though this was foiled by the rest of his court refusing to accept a female leader. No complaints about her running around killing people during her time on screen; it’s fascinating history.\n\nReturning to Marco Polo, it seems a strange decision to have made him into a warrior at the Khan’s side. The real Marco Polo served Kublai Khan as an ambassador, hence his wide travels within the Mongol’s South Asian empire, and while he may have observed some warfare there are no records of him participating in battlefields for the Khan. He was not entirely unaccustomed to combat however; during his initial journey along the silk road his caravan was ambushed by bandits who concealed themselves in a sandstorm (an event eluded to in the show) and forced to fight its way out of the town they were cornered in. Upon his return to Venice years later, he served on a Venetian artillery galley during a war against Genoa, and was captured in skirmish at sea, dictating some of his stories to a cellmate before his release. The man was clearly not shy of violence, but hardly to the extent of the spy/ warrior monk of the show. There is no record of him learning Kung Fu.\n\nThe Siege of Xiangyang\n\nI’m going to talk about the real siege of Xiangyang mostly because it was really cool, but also because it is one of the rare cases of a battle in history being more exciting, and having more explosions, than its portrayal on screen.\n\nUnlike in the show, where Xiangyang is presented as the impenetrable barrier keeping the Mongols from Southern China, the city had actually surrendered peacefully to Mongke Khan during his invasion of China. However, the city was not held, and after Mongke’s death Mongol troops left Song Territory, and the Song made it clear that this time they wouldn’t be coming back in without a fight. After claiming victory from a disputed succession, Kublai Khan sent his generals Aju and the Song defector Liu Zheng to recapture the city, and stamp out the Song rebels.\n\nXiangyang was surrounded by mountains on two sides, and had two layers of mighty walls, but the Mongols encircled it with a ring of forts, and a six year siege began. Although they used thousands of trebuchets, the weapons were not the counterweight type that would prove decisive later, and had little effect against the thick walls. A fleet of five thousand ships, with seventy thousand marines, was established to prevent the city being reinforced by river.\n\nThe Song made several attempts to relieve the city and smuggle in supplies, most being brutally defeated, with one major success by river. However, the river-borne force was unable to send word of their success to the rest of the Song through the mongol blockade, and were considered lost. There were no further attempts.\n\nBoth sides made extensive use of gunpowder weaponry, rather than “black powder” being the secret weapon of the Song as in the show. The mongols used “thundercrash bombs”, explosive shells and siege crossbows, while the Song Chinese responded in kind with firelances and brutal shrapnel bombs. Aju and Liu Zheng were forced to request twenty thousand more Chinese infantrymen from their Khan, as fighting continued and losses mounted, and the mongol cavalry proved unsuited for prolonged siege warfare.\n\nAs in the show, it was new counterweight trebuchets that changed the tide. Rather than being introduced by Marco Polo, however, Kublai heard about these weapons from one of his generals who had served in the Middle East, and sent for siege engineers from Persia to construct them.\n\nThe Mongols tested these weapons on Fangcheng, a nearby city that had been under siege by the same forces as were attacking Xiangyang. After five thousand torsion trebuchets had proved ineffective for years, just twenty counterweight trebuchets launched rocks over the walls and into the city itself. The mongols filled the moat under the cover of the colossal bombardment, and stormed the city with their cavalry. After resisting for years, Fangcheng fell in a few days. Xiangyang surrendered after a month of similar trebuchet bombardment.\n\nIt would be years before the Song were finally defeated, the last of their loyalists being destroyed in a naval battle years later. The child emperor was surrendered to the mongols after the fall of the song capital and the death of Jiao Sidao, but unlike in the show, where he is brutally murdered by Kublai, the real emperor was exiled to Tibet, and died at 52 after spending his life translating ancient scriptures and serving as a monk. I found the shows decision to make Kublai’s child murder such a heavy emotional beat strange, as it paints all parties in a far worse light than was historically true.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe story of Prester John was a real Christian legend, supposedly descended from the three wise men at Jesus’s birth, and ruling a lost christian kingdom in the east filled with strange beasts and magic. He was originally thought to reside in India, where there was some christian presence. After the disasters of the fifth crusade, however, it seemed to the christian world that Prester John had come to save them, with reports that a grand army was coming out of the east, putting the Muslim kingdoms to fire and sword.\n\nThey were somewhat disappointed to learn that “Prester John” was in fact Genghis Khan, and that his fire and sword was distinctly non-denominational.\n\nHowever, they were not people to give up on a good story, and decided that Prester John was in fact Genghis’ foster father, who had sent him to defeat the enemies of Christianity in his name. Genghis had at least one Christian wife, who was assigned special significance in this story. Eventually, however, the Christians became unhappy that the Mongols seemed highly tolerant of Islam and Judaism, and more than happy to pillage the odd Christian settlement, so the legend of Prester John was relocated from the far east to Ethiopia; with the Portuguese reporting that he ruled the African kingdom. Ethiopian ambassadors were continually confused that their leader was being referred to as Prester John when they visited Europe in 1441.\n\nAriq, Kaidu and Nayan were all real mongol rebels against Kublai; Kaidu’s rebellion lasted more than thirty years, and resolving the economic damage caused by the war was the main achievement of Kublai’s successor. The portrayal of these rebellions in the show was broadly inaccurate, moving events around and considerably shortening the time scale. The Christian army and Nayan’s visit to the Pope in the second season are entirely invented, as is Ahmad’s role as mastermind. Kublai really did destroy Nayan’s forces with a night attack, and Kaidu did escape from that battle to fight another day, as in the show. The use of flaming animals was also a real mongol tactic.\n\nThe Kokochin who was married by Jingim in the show was a conflation of two different Kokochins, the one who married Jingim and the one known as the blue princess, who was married to a Khan of the Ilkhanate by Kublai. Her connection to Marco Polo is a feature of the second Kokochin; when Kublai finally allowed Polo’s caravan to leave Mongolia after 17 years, he had them escort the blue princess to Persia as a final task. This was a sign of Kublai’s trust in Marco, who was also tasked with sending messages to several European kings, continuing his role as Kublai’s ambassador. The journey by ship took the party from Sumatra, to Sri Lanka and the Indian city of Allepey, which Marco Polo called “the Venice of India”.\n\nThe deadly Shaolin monks were, surprisingly, semi-historical as a military force. They were certainly feared warriors, and the martial arts they developed, especially around staff-fighting, are the closest thing to real life Kung Fu masters capable of the feats depicted in the show. They were often used as military advisers, as in the case of Hundred Eyes in the show (who wasn’t real), and were very occasionally used as an actual “warrior monk” military unit, including a case in the 18th century when a unit of monks brutally slaughtered an army of pirates, taking only four casualties. I was excited to find that this seeming fantasy of the show has some genuine historical backing.\n\nWhile Kublai Khan had many wives and consorts, the depiction of cheerful, exotic prostitutes having the time of their lives in royal, silk clad brothels is a somewhat disturbing artistic license on the part of the show. While both the mongols and the Chinese had a more sexually liberated culture than Europe at the time, depicted in erotic art of the era, the depiction of prostitutes and sex in general in American made historical shows like this is continually problematic. To be fair to Marco Polo, the problem is far more visible in the first season than the second, so they did improve things as time went on.\n\nOverall, Marco Polo was an enjoyable historical romp, that could have perhaps improved itself in a third season. I found it cringey at times, but I’m always a sucker for expensive looking depictions of history. Where it has problems with historical accuracy, the issue is rarely the existence of inaccuracy, but the kinds of liberties taken with the source material, and what it reveals about our modern storytelling tropes."
