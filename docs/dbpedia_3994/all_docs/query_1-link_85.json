        "text": "In a statement, his solicitor Diana Rawstron, who has represented Freud for many years, said: \"Lucian Freud, artist, born 8 December 1922 in Berlin, died peacefully last night (Wednesday 20 July) at his home in London.\"\n\nThe painter, a towering figure in the art world for more than 50 years, died after an illness, his New York-based art dealer said.\n\nWilliam Acquavella said in a statement that he would mourn Freud \"as one of the great painters of the 20th century\".\n\nMr Acquavella added: \"He lived to paint and painted until the day he died, far removed from the noise of the art world.\"\n\nNicholas Serota, director of the Tate art gallery, said: \"The vitality of his nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th century art.\n\n\"His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.\"\n\nFreud's works have recently fetched millions at auction. Last month, a portrait entitled Woman Smiling, 1958-59, sold for £4,745,250 when it went under the hammer. In another sale, Boy On A Sofa fetched £1,497,250.\n\nHe has also created a portrait of the Queen - completed in his characteristically uncompromising and unflattering style, with some commentators describing the Monarch's expression as \"glum\".\n\nFreud was a member of the Order of Merit - one of Britain's most prestigious chivalry honours. The honour, founded in 1902 by Edward VII, is a personal gift of the Monarch and is awarded for exceptional distinction in the arts, sciences and other areas. The honour is restricted to 24 members at any one time, plus additional foreign recipients."
