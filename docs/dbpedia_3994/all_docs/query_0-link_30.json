        "text": "Saturday, July 23, 2011\n\nLucian Freud, the painter and grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, died Wednesday at his London home following a short illness. He was 88 years old.\n\nFreud, the elder brother of the late comedic writer and broadcaster Clement Freud, was born in Berlin in 1922 and moved with his family to Britain in 1933 to escape the Nazis. He became a British citizen in 1939. He studied at the Central School of Art, then at the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing with Cedric Morris. He also attended Goldsmiths, University of London. After finishing art school, he spent some time in the merchant navy. In 1944, he started exhibiting with a solo showcase at the Alex Reid & Lefevre Gallery.\n\nI paint people not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be.\n\nIn the 1950s, his style changed to exclusively paint portraits and nudes. The process of painting for models was intense: one nude painting took 16 months to complete and Freud demanded her turn up almost every day to pose. His work was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1989, and he was a member of the Order of Merit. Most controversially, he painted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II which was described by The Sun newspaper as a \"travesty\", and prompted Robin Simon, the editor of the British Art Journal to say that \"It makes her look like one of the royal corgis who has suffered a stroke\". He also famously painted the glamour model Kate Moss nude, and was once named one of Britain's best dressed men in the magazine GQ.\n\nHis work has sold for large amounts: Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, sold in 2008 at Christie's in New York for $33.6 million dollars. In addition, he has had solo shows at some of the most prominent art galleries and museums in the world including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate in London, said of Freud: \"The vitality of his nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late twentieth century art. His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.\"\n\nFreud has at least thirteen children from a series of marriages and affairs: after an affair with the Bloomsbury Group member Lorna Garman, Freud married her niece Kitty in 1948 and had two children (Annie and Annabel) before ending the marriage four years later. He had an affair with Lady Caroline Blackwood which turned into a marriage in 1953, although that was dissolved in 1957. He also had two children with Bernadine Coverly (Bella Freud, the fashion designer, and the writer Esther Freud), five children with Suzy Boyt, and four children with Katherine Margaret McAdam (Paul Freud, an artist, Lucy Freud, David Freud and Jane McAdam Freud, also an artist).\n\nLucian Freud\n\nLucian Freud\n\nSources\n\nBarbara Davies. \"Did Lucian Freud love his art more than his children?\" — The Daily Mail, July 23, 2011\n\nDaily Mail Reporter & Christopher Hudson. \"Realist painter Lucian Freud, famed for his nudes of family and friends, dies aged 88\" — The Daily Mail, July 22, 2011\n\nGregory Katz. \"Realist painter Lucian Freud dies\" — SFGate.com, July 22, 2011\n\nGeordie Hazeel. \"Lucian Freud quotes\" — The Telegraph, July 22, 2011\n\nJames Orr and Raf Sanchez. \"Lucian Freud, the foremost figurative artist of his generation, dies aged 88\" — The Telegraph, July 21, 2011\n\nMaev Kennedy. \"Turner prize 2004: 20 years of the Turner prize - Lucian Freud (nominee 1988, 1989)\" — The Guardian, November 1, 2003\n\n\"Freud royal portrait divides critics\" — BBC News, December 21, 2001\n\nJohn Spurling. \"Profile: Lucian Freud: Portrait of the artist as a happy man\" — The Independent, December 13, 1998\n\nExternal link"
