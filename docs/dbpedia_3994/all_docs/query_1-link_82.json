        "text": "Lucian Freud passed away on Wednesday at his home in London following a brief illness, the New York Times’s William Grimes reports. William Acquavella of Acquavella Galleries, Freud’s dealer, informed the Times of the cause of death. Freud was eighty-eight-years old.\n\nThe grandson of Sigmund Freud, the painter is often credited with reframing the genre of portraiture and laying a new foundation for figurative art. Born in Berlin 1922, Freud grew up in a wealthy neighborhood and moved to London in 1933 after Hitler came to power. He had little interest in school, aspiring instead to become a jockey, but after creating a sandstone sculpture of a horse, was accepted into the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. A year later he transferred to the East Anglian School of Drawing and Painting in Dedham where he studied with the painter Cedric Morris.\n\nGrimes notes that “Freud was a bohemian of the old school. He set up his studios in squalid neighborhoods, developed a Byronic reputation as a rake and gambled recklessly.” (“Debit stimulates me,” Freud once said). In 1941, Freud enlisted in the Merchant Navy in hopes of moving to New York. He later married he Kitty Garman, the daughter of the sculptor Jacob Epstein. Garman is the subject of a number of his portraits, for example, Girl With Roses and Girl With a Kitten, both 1947, and Girl With a White Dog, 1950-51. “I’ve got a strong autobiographical bias,” Freud once told the British art critic William Feaver. “My work is entirely about myself and my surroundings.” Garman and Freud later divorced and the artist married Lady Caroline Blackwood, a marriage that ended in divorce as well. He is survived by many children from his first marriage and from a series of romantic relationships.\n\nWhile Freud is known for his portraiture, he created a handful of Surrealist works, notably The Painter’s Room, 1943. He later denounced the genre, telling the art critic Robert Hughes, “I could never put anything into a picture that wasn’t actually there in front of me. That would be a pointless lie, a mere bit of artfulness.”\n\nGrimes writes that “Freud remained deeply unfashionable in the United States for many decades” but gained popularity in 1987 after the Hirshorn exhibited his work in a show that was rejected by all other New York museums. The exhibition was a “watershed event.” The art critic Robert Hughes declared Freud to be “the greatest living realist painter,” and a Freud soon earned a dedicated following in the United States. Six years later the Metropolitan Museum of Art organized a retrospective of his work.\n\n“Freud has generated a life’s worth of genuinely new painting that sits obstinately across the path of those lesser painters who get by on less,” says Feaver, who organized a 2002 Freud retrospective at Tate Britain. “He always pressed to extremes, carrying on further than one would think necessary and rarely letting anything go before it became disconcerting.”"
