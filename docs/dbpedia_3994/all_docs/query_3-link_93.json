        "text": "Join!\n\nBecome a member of The Fralin Museum of Art.\n\nOn March 21st, The Fralin Museum of Art treated art lovers to a fascinating look inside the work and life of Lucian Freud in a special conversation with a man who perhaps knew him best. Museum Director Bruce Boucher sat down with David Dawson, who served as Freud’s assistant for more than twenty years for a wide-ranging talk about the life, the work, and the legacy of Freud, who is recognized as one of the most influential artists of his generation. The grandson of Sigmund Freud, Lucian Freud passed away in 2011 at the age of 88, and is best known for his arresting and unflinchingly intimate nudes. Focused more on reality than sensuality, the portraits largely captured subjects who were friends, and even family members, of Freud’s. The closeness of the relationships between Freud and his subjects allowed for a more realistic approach to portraiture, thereby challenging conventional concepts of beauty. “A Conversation with David Dawson” was a featured event of the 2015 Virginia Festival of the Book. Dawson’s, A Painter’s Progress, is a stunning collection of photographs that offers an intimate look at Lucian Freud’s final years. The Lucian Freud: Etchings exhibition was made possible by the generous support of Acquavella Galleries, The Fralin Museum of Art Volunteer Board, WTJU 91.1 FM, Albemarle Magazine, and Ivy Publications LLC’s Charlottesville Welcome Book."
