        "text": "Girl – Lucian Freud is dedicated to the moving portraits that Lucian Freud made of Lady Caroline Blackwood, the eldest child of the 4th Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and the brewery heiress Maureen Guinness. When she was just 22 Caroline eloped with Freud to Paris, before marrying him a year later in 1953. Freud’s portraits of her, chronicling their relationship from 1950 until they separated in 1956, were thought aggressive at the time, almost brutal in the way that they made a young girl seem old. Since then, they have come to be seen as among the artist’s most tender and beautiful works.\n\nCaroline Blackwood became a celebrated author and well-known figure in the literary world through her journalism and her novels, which include The Stepdaughter, 1976, awarded the David Higham Prize, and Great Granny Webster, 1977, shortlisted for The Booker Prize. She also wrote the acclaimed non-fiction book The Last of the Duchess, which chronicled her experience of writing about Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor.\n\nAfter Caroline and Lucian divorced, Caroline married the composer, Israel Citkowitz, and later the poet Robert Lowell; their relationship is documented in his Pulitzer Prize winning collection, The Dolphin, and in his last work, Day by Day."
