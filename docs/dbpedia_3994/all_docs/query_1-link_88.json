        "text": "This Wednesday,Â Lucian Freud passed away in his London home at the age of 88. According to Mr. Freudâ€™s dealer, William Acquavella of Acquavella Galleries, Freud suffered a brief illness before his death. Freudâ€™s career is characterized by his thickly-painted portraits of friends and family, which brought forward and repositioned the genre of portraiture in the twentieth century.\n\nMore text and images after the jump…\n\n–>\n\n–>\n\nLucian Freud with Martin Gayford in 2010, via The Guardian\n\nBorn on December 8th, 1922, Â in Berlin, Germany, Lucian Freud, grandson of Sigmund Freud, was raised in England by his father, Ernst Ludwig Freud, and mother, Lucie nee Brasch, where Lucian briefly attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts, then the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing as well as Goldsmiths, University of London. During the early 1950s, he held a position as a Visiting Tutor at the Slade School of Fine Art. Lucian Freud went on to become one of Britainâ€™s most well-known contemporary artists and one of the most well-known artist of the twentieth century, whose dense oil paintings of nudes and portraits stood out with their commitment to traditionalist figurative sentiments, while the main current of modern art was becoming increasingly abstract. Freudâ€™s depiction of his friends, family, neighbors, fellow artists and others were known to contain as much emotional power as the painter himself. They possessed an unique realism that relayed the stress, fatigue, and age that his subjects were unable to escape.\n\n–>\n\nLucian Freud, Girl in Bed (1952) via Museum Syndicate\n\nIn 1948, Lucian Freud married Kitty Garman, daughter of sculptor Jacob Epstein, whom he would later divorce in 1952 and was also the subject of several portraits such as â€œGirl With Rosesâ€ (1947-1948), Girl with a Kittenâ€ (1947), and â€œGirl With a White Digâ€ (1950-1951). After his divorce from Kitty in 1952, Freud married Lady Caroline Blackwood the next year, and made her the subject of the painting, â€œGirl in Bedâ€ (1952). He later divorced Lady Blackwood in 1958. Freud is survived by at least 13 children from his first marriage to Kitty Garman and several romantic relationships.\n\n–>\n\nLucian Freud, Interior at Paddinton (1951), via British Council\n\nThe span of Freud’s career was marked by a range of achievements. His â€œInterior at Paddingtonâ€ of 1951 was awarded a prize at the Festival of Britain, and then the Purchaze Prize by the Arts Council of Great Britain. In 1954, Freud, along with Francis Bacon and Ben Nicholson, were selected as the representatives of Great Britain at the Venice Biennale, and in 1974, the Arts Council of Great Britain held a major retrospective of Freud’s work when he was at the age of 52. While in 1989, Freud was put on the short list for the Turner Prize, Lucian Freud was awarded the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993 and would be bestowed the honor of painting Queen Elizabeth II in 2001. This portrait of the Queen, one of his most famous works, was described both as “thought-provoking and psychologically penetrating” andÂ “extremely unflattering”, andÂ continues to divide fans and critics today. The following year in 2002, Tate Britain organized another large retrospective of Freudâ€™s work, 28 years after the retrospective at the Arts Council of Great Britain.\n\n–>\n\nLucian Freud, Queen Elizabeth II (2001), via BBC\n\n–>\n\nLucian Freud, Ib and Her Husband (1992), via Christie’s\n\n–>\n\nLucian Freud, Benefits Supervisor Sleeping (1995), via Bloomberg\n\nFreud’s works have fetched impressive and at times record-breaking prices in the art market.Â His portrait, â€œBenefits Supervisor Sleepingâ€ (1995) was sold at auction by Christieâ€™s in New York City for $33.6 million to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. The sale set a world record for purchase value of a painting by a living artist; the previous record holder was Jeff Koonsâ€™ Hanging Heart, which sold for $23.5 million in 2007. The previous auction record for a Freud painting was $19.3 million for â€œIb and Her Husbandâ€ (1992).\n\n– S.
