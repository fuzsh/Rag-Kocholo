        "text": "MARK COLVIN: The art critic, Robert Hughes, once described Lucian Freud, who's died at the age of 88, as the greatest living realist painter. But for much of his career, Freud's figurative style was out of fashion in the art world, and he laboured in relative obscurity.\n\nIn recent years, however, Lucian Freud has enjoyed a resurgence. One of his paintings selling for more than $30 million, a record for a living artist.\n\nLucian Freud was best known for his often fleshy nudes and his unblinking gaze nudged viewers into remembering the subject's mortality and their own.\n\nTimothy McDonald.\n\nTIMOTHY MCDONALD: Lucian Freud's paintings were sometimes too close for comfort. In his work, he wanted to somehow get at the essence of the people he painted.\n\nLUCIAN FREUD: I don't want to use them for an idea I've got where I must use a figure, say, of that one. I actually want to do them and even their identical twin wouldn't do at all if I didn't know them.\n\nTIMOTHY MCDONALD: He often painted those he knew best: his friends, lovers, and fellow artists. Lucian Freud often required his models to sit for marathon sessions, and he'd paint them in great detail, warts, blemishes and all.\n\nArt critic, Godfrey Barker, says he shows something of the observational skill of his grandfather Sigmund Freud, regarded as the father of modern psychoanalysis.\n\nGODFREY BARKER: That huge psychological intensity which is the work of Dr Freud, is there in his grandson. Lucian Freud was immensely strong on expressive qualities, both in the face and in the body in particular.\n\nYou can put your hand over the face in many of Lucian Freud's portraits and read what has happened to those people just from the muscles and the intense meaning that he wrote into legs and torsos and bodies.\n\nTIMOTHY MCDONALD: He's perhaps best known for his fleshy, nude portraits.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald's art critic, John McDonald, says his paintings weren't always flattering to the subject, but in a way, he treated nudity as a great equaliser.\n\nJOHN MCDONALD: If he painted somebody like Jerry Hall or Kate Moss he didn't make them like a supermodel, they look as fleshy as anybody else. They look like a patchwork of like little bruised marks and brushstrokes.\n\nOn the other hand, when some people are quite monstrously ugly, like Lord Goodman, as in the very famous etching he did, it's done so well, he emphasises all these rather gross features of Lord Goodman, that it comes across as an incredibly handsome etching.\n\nFreud was somebody who really had to find his own beauty in things. And to him I think the old Keats thing that 'truth is beauty and beauty truth'.\n\nTIMOTHY MCDONALD: Some say his work is so penetrating and personal, that it can even be an uncomfortable experience for those who just look at it.\n\nLucina Ward is the curator of international painting and sculpture at the National Gallery of Australia, which bought one of his works, titled 'After Cezanne', for $7 million.\n\nLUCINA WARD: It's an extraordinary painting, one in which people don't feel terribly comfortable in front of a lot of the time. But one that I think is an example of really great art in that people keep on coming back to it. It's not a work that most people can say that they enjoy but they certainly often admire it and I think that's the extraordinary push and pull of Lucian Freud.\n\nTIMOTHY MCDONALD: In a sense, Lucian Freud was the art world's forgotten great. He enjoyed a brief moment of popularity in the 1940s, before his figurative style fell out favour and more abstract styles came into vogue.\n\nJohn MacDonald says the world returned to his way of painting, and his perseverance finally paid off.\n\nJOHN MACDONALD: His star faded as abstract expressionism and various other movements began to rule the roost and nobody really wanted to look at these odd figurative paintings that Lucian Freud was doing.\n\nHowever, he persevered, he stuck to it and years later the world began to turn in the opposite direction and, of course, by the time of his death he's considered to be one of the very greatest British painters and almost unchallengeable in that reputation.\n\nTIMOTHY MCDONALD: In recent years his paintings have sold for huge sums. His 1995 Portrait \"Benefits Supervisor Sleeping\" sold for more than $30 million, a world record for a living artist.\n\nHe died at the age of 88 at his home in London after a short illness.\n\nMARK COLVIN: Timothy McDonald."
