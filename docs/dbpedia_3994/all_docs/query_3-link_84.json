        "text": "www.centrepompidou.fr\n\nThe Pompidou Center and the Lucian Freud show billboard.\n\nOne of my favorite journeys through a museum was the 2002 exhibit of Lucian Freud at the Tate Britain, which represented six decades of painting. I began viewing work by the young artist at the beginning of his career, which over the years developed into large and complicated tour de force paintings that are now part of our modern art history. What hit home for me was the artists current work during my visit, which worked around the subjects of family and grandchildren; after all of the artist's exploration and successes, these subjects were what mattered most to him, as shown through his devotion to and time spent painting them.\n\nFast forward to 2010, when I heard the Pompidou Center was exploring a show on Lucian Freud that revolved around the artists studio as subject. I made the show a priority to visit, as I knew as an artist back in 2002 how much I admired Lucian Freuds painting. However, seeing his work again after I had resumed my own painting as a 40-year-old artist, his brushwork and beauty rendered me as captive as a bee in a jar. I felt filled with excited to witness his work in person again. Whether it be the monumental and sculptural portrait of Leigh Bowery, Leigh under the Skylight, the perfect cityscape view from a window in Two Irishmen or Big Sue in Benefits Supervisor Sleeping (portraying the most lush painting treatment of a tattered sofa) or the exquisite subtleties of whites that dance along the tile and studio sink in the painting Two Japanese Wrestlers by a Sink, I was inspired and awed.\n\nIn addition to collecting all of the artist catalogs, getting the photography documentation book Freud at Work by Bruce Bernard and David Dawson and purchasing DVDs, I also recently picked up the book by art critic Martin Gayford, who sat for Freud for his portrait, Man with a Blue Scarf. As I poked around the Internet to read reviews, I discovered that Freud regularly paints for eight hours a day, takes a four- hour break and begins night paintings with models, working until late at night. In fact, artists models often commit to three to four days a week during approximately a six month period to complete a painting. I thought two things as I imagined such a life of dedication to the arts: No wonder Lucien Freud is considered one our greatest living painters, and how can one compete with that pace of creation to grow?\n\nThe entrance to the exhibit with a enlarged graphic of the artist's self-portrait engraving.\n\nLUCIAN FREUD: \"The aura given out by a person or object is as much a part as their flesh. The effect that they make is as bound up with them as might be their colour or smell. The effect in space of two different human individuals can be different as the effect of a candle and an electric bulb. Therefore the painter must be as concerned with the air surrounding his subjects as with that subject itself.\"\n\nLUCIAN FREUD: \"I know my idea of portraiture came from the dissatisfaction with the portraits that resemble people. - I would wish my portraits to be OF them, not LIKE them, not having a look of the sitter being them. I didnt' want to get just a likeness like a mimic, but to portray them -like an actor- As far as I am concerned, the paint is the person, I want it to work for me as flesh does.\"\n\nThe Arc de Triomphe with my partner Barnet Cohn\n\nNow remembering fully why my 2002 visit to the Tate Britain for a six decade retrospective of Lucian Freud was so special an event to me.\n\nhttp://www.tate.org.uk"
