        "text": "LUCIAN Freud, who has died aged 88 after a brief illness, was a towering and uncompromising figure in the art world for almost 60 years and widely considered to be among the greatest artists of his time.\n\nHe was known for his intense realist portraits, particularly of nudes. In recent years his paintings commanded staggering prices at auction. His magesterial 1995 portrait Benefits Supervisor Sleeping sold for $33.6 million (£20.5m) in New York three years ago.\n\nFreud, who was notoriously publicity shy, stubbornly refused to follow the trends of that world, insisting on using his realist approach even when it was out of favour with critics and collectors. He developed his own unique style, eventually winning recognition as one of the world’s greatest painters.\n\nHe was the grandson of Sigmund Freud and brother of the late game show panellist and politician Sir Clement Freud. He was born in Berlin in 1922 and moved to London with his Jewish parents Ernst and Lucie Freud in 1933 after Hitler and the Nazis rose to power in Germany.\n\nHe was naturalised as a British subject six years later and spent almost his entire working life based in London, where he was often seen at fashionable restaurants, sometimes with beautiful younger women, including the fashion models Kate Moss and Jerry Hall, both of whom he painted nude, and other luminaries.\n\nFollowing the death of his friend and fellow Soho bohemian Francis Bacon in 1992 he was at the height of his fame as Britain’s pre-eminent painter, and up until his death he continued to paint for long hours at his studio in London’s exclusive Holland Park. He was even named one of Britain’s best dressed men by the fashion magazine GQ when he was well into his ninth decade.\n\nBut there was little beautiful in Freud’s nude portraits, which did not gloss over a subject’s flaws.\n\nThe intimate detail of his paintings, sometimes of sitters such as the performance artist Leigh Bowery, left some viewers uncomfortable.\n\nAmong his most famous subjects was the Queen, who posed for Freud after extensive negotiations between the palace and the painter. The controversial 2001 portrait, which the artist donated to the Queen’s collection, remains one of the most unusual depictions of the British monarch.\n\n“It makes her look like one of the royal corgis who has suffered a stroke,” said Robin Simon, editor of the British Art Journal.\n\nThe portrait, which other critics said had broken the staid mould of royal portraiture, can currently be seen at the National Galleries of Scotland as part of its exhibition of images of Elizabeth II. The National Galleries were important to Freud: his love of two works by Titian there, Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto, was profound.\n\nStaying in the Borders in the 1980s, he drove almost every day to Edinburgh to see the paintings, which he campaigned to keep in the country. Scotland has held four Freud exhibitions, in 1988, 1995, 1997 and of his etchings in 2004. The NGS owns three of his works, including the large oil, Two Men, from 1987/88.\n\nIn his studio, Freud worked extremely slowly and deliberately. People who posed for Freud said it sometimes took him months or years to complete a portrait because of his attention to every tiny detail and the complex nature of his brushwork, which gave his paintings a lifelike intensity.\n\nHe sometimes spent entire days mixing paints without putting a brush to canvas. When he did finally paint, he would wipe his brush on a cloth rag after every stroke. Great piles of rags lay on the floor of his studio and eventually he began to incorporate the rags into some of his paintings.\n\nFreud often painted his friends, relatives and fellow artists. Others were simply ordinary people who received a small daily fee for posing. He usually refrained from using professional models because he felt they brought artifice into his studio.\n\nHis 1950-51 portrait Girl with a White Dog of his first wife Kitty Garman, the daughter of Jacob Epstein and Kathleen Garman, was to remain one of his most famous and best loved works. The detail of her features, the shadows in the room and her partial nudity are typical of the nuance and frankness of much of Freud’s work.\n\nNudity became a central feature of Freud’s art. Painting people without their clothes, he believed, peeled away their outer layer and helped reveal their instincts and desires.\n\n“I’m really interested in people as animals,” he told curators at the Tate Britain museum in advance of a major show in 2002. “Part of my liking to work from them naked is for that reason, because I can see more ... I like people to look as natural and as physically at ease as animals.”\n\nHis first solo exhibition was at the Lefevre Gallery in 1944 after a brief stint with the Merchant Navy during the war. After the war, Freud left London for several years to paint primarily in France and Greece.\n\nOn his return in 1948, he started showing his work regularly at various exhibits and also taught art in schools.\n\nHis first major retrospective exhibition appeared at London’s Hayward Gallery in 1974 to critical acclaim. Further retrospectives appeared in Paris, Berlin and Washington between 1987-88 and in 2002 at London’s Tate Britain museum.\n\nHis work can be found in major public collections around the world, including the Tate Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery in London, the National Gallery of Modern Art in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nIn 1998 prominent art critic Robert Hughes described Freud as “the greatest living realist painter”. But despite the accolades, he kept trying to improve his work even as the end of his life neared.\n\n“I think the most dangerous thing for an artist would be to be pleased with one’s work simply because it is one’s own,” he once said. “One wants every picture to be better than its predecessors. Otherwise, what’s the point?”\n\nHe feuded for many years with Sir Clement, who died in April 2009, and did not attend his funeral. It is thought the estrangement was the result of an argument over a horse racing bet. Both men had been avid gamblers.\n\nFreud’s marriage to Kathleen Garman lasted four years and was dissolved in 1952. They had two daughters. His second marriage, to Caroline Blackwood in 1953, ended in 1957.\n\nA renowned womaniser, he had many children, including two by Bernardine Coverley (fashion designer Bella Freud and writer Esther Freud); five with Suzy Boyt (including the novelist Susy Boyt) and four by Katherine Margaret McAdam."
