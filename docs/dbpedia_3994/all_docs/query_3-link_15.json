        "text": "The critic Kenneth Tynan divided playwrights into two categories, “smooth” and “hairy,” and one could probably make a similar distinction among biographers. Smooth biographers offer clean narrative lines, well-underscored themes, and carrots, in the form of cliffhangers, to lure the reader onward. Their books are on best-seller lists. They’re good gifts for Dad.\n\nWilliam Feaver, the author of “The Lives of Lucian Freud” — the second volume, “Fame, 1968-2011,” is out now — exists on the opposite extreme. There’s little smoothness in him at all. His biography is hairier than a bonobo.\n\nFeaver, a longtime art critic for The Observer in London, doesn’t provide a fixed portrait of Freud, the great realist painter, so much as he leads us into a studio filled with crusty brushes, scrapers, half-completed canvases, easels, dirty floorboards, mahlsticks and distilled turpentine, and lets us poke through the detritus as if to assemble a likeness for ourselves.\n\nSome critics have found the jumbled, unmediated quality of these biographies to be a feature rather than a bug. I’ve tried to see it that way. Reading these talky and cluttered books is like scrolling through microfilm: There are no grand vistas, but there are neck aches and, often enough, because Freud led life up to the nostrils, fantastic “aha!” moments.\n\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of January. See the full list. ]\n\nA grandson of Sigmund Freud, Lucian was born in Berlin in 1922. His father was an architect. Lucian’s family fled to England in 1933, not long after the Nazis seized power. He was born with an extra toe on his small toe, which the family, to his disappointment, had removed. He later grew a sharklike fang, he claimed, between his front teeth. That was tugged out as well.\n\nFreud served briefly in World War II as an ordinary seaman. He became a painter, Feaver writes, because “he used to go around saying he was a painter” and “after a time he had to do something about it.” Then began a career in art and social climbing. His second wife was Caroline Blackwood, heir to the Guinness fortune.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
