        "text": "This first major exhibition of Lucian Freud’s work in 10 years brings together paintings from more than seven decades.\n\nThe exhibition presents the paintings of one of Britain's finest figurative painters, Lucian Freud (1922–2011). It spans a lifetime of work, charting how Freud’s painting changed during 70 years of practice – from his early and intimate works to his well-known, large-scale canvasses and his monumental naked portraits.\n\nThrough more than 60 paintings, you will see the development of an artist: paintings of powerful public figures are followed by private studies of friends and family; the familiar, domestic setting gives way to the artist’s paint-splattered studio – a place that becomes both stage and a subject in its own right – and the approximated features of his earliest paintings are complemented by the expertly rendered flesh of his final works.\n\nFreud's celebrity often overshadowed the work he produced and the historical context in which they were made. Bringing to light new perspectives on a lifetime’s work, this exhibition looks beyond Freud's fame and infamy to focus on the artist's uncompromising commitment to painting in the 20th century.\n\nExhibition organised by the National Gallery and the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza"
