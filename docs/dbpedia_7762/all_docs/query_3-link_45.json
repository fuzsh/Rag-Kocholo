        "text": "The essay investigates the proposition that economic questions are a fit subject for science. This investigation will involve a selective examination of seventeenth-century writings before looking at again selective Enlightenment texts. The essay is deliberately wide ranging, but it aims to pick out the emergence or crystallization of political economy by noting how theorists sought to establish it as a subject matter and in the process develop ways of studying it that aimed to uncover regularities and exhibit generality, systematicity, and precision. Together these supported its pretensions or claims to be a science that would in a Baconian manner be useful and free of the perceived shackles of a moralistic classical disparagement of economic activity.\n\n5 Ibid., 405. Compare in a clear “economic” context his observation, “ [the poorest artificer] expects that when he carries his goods to market and offers them at a reasonable price, he shall find purchasers and shall be able, by the money he acquires, to engage others to supply him with those commodities which are requisite for his subsistence. In proportion as men extend their dealings and render their intercourse with others more complicated, they always comprehend in their schemes of life a greater variety of voluntary actions which they expect, from the proper motives, to co-operate with their own,” Enquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals, eds., L. A. Selby-Bigge and P. H. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), 89 ( my emphases). Both this quotation and that from the Treatise are found in the sections on “Liberty and Necessity” where Hume is forthright in his assertions that human behavior is regular and uniform.\n\n9 A key methodological principle in the execution of the science of man is tracing observational “experiments” to universal principles, that is, by “explaining all effects from the simplest and fewest causes,” Hume, Treatise, xvii. Compare Isaac Newton’s first rule of reasoning, “Nature is pleased with simplicity and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes,” in Newton’s Philosophy of Nature: Selections from His Writing, ed., H. S.Thayer (New York: Hafner, 1953), 3.\n\n12 Paul Harsin quoted in King in “The Origin,” 230. Among other judgments to the same effect are William Letwin, The Origins of Scientific Economics (New York: Doubleday, 1964), 233; Henry Spiegel, The Growth of Economic Thought, rev. ed. (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1983), 94; Terence Hutchison, Before Adam Smith: The Emergence of Political Economy 1662–1776 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1988), 17; and Joseph Schumpeter, History of Economic Analysis (London: Allen and Unwin, 1954), 168. A more positive assessment is given by Jean-Claude Perrot, Une Histoire Intellectuelle de l’Économie Politique (Paris: Éditions de l’École des Hautes Études en Sciences Social, 1992), 63–66, 73.\n\n15 Hume, Essays, 304. For Hume’s criticism of those who fallaciously mistake a collateral effect for a cause, see my 2006 article now reprinted in Christopher J. Berry, Essays on Hume, Smith and the Scottish Enlightenment (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2018), chap.11. Hume saw Bacon as a pioneer, a thinker who had “pointed out at a distance the road to true philosophy,” (History II, 212).\n\n17 Steuart, James, An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy: Being An Essay on the Science of the Domestic Policy in Free Nations, in Works, 6 volumes (London: 1805) I:1, 2.Google Scholar\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau similarly made clear that there is an “extreme difference” between domestic and political economy. See his article “Économie (Morale et Politique),” in Denis Diderot, ed., Encyclopédie (Geneva: 1755), V, 357.\n\n47 See Jacob, James, “The Political Economy of Science in Seventeenth-Century England,” Social Research 59 (1992): 505–32, at 524.Google Scholar It was these expressions of “demoralization” that were later amplified by Mandeville and it was his open if still oblique defense of luxury and critique of frugality that kept the moralistic attitude to consumption alive and against which the self-styled scientists of political economy set themselves. Bernard Mandeville, Fable of the Bees (1721–32), 2 volumes, ed. F. B. Kaye (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Press, 1988) I, 107–23. However, Mandeville himself never articulates a considered account of “political economy,” adopting for all intents and purposes a mercantilist perspective. See, for example, Harry Lindreth, “The Economic Thought of Bernard Mandeville,” History of Political Economy 7 (1975): 192–208.\n\n63 Condillac, Commerce in Oeuvres II, 247, 318. The use of “principles” is common (see, for example, Cary and Verri quoted above and its presence in the title of Steuart’s book as well as the subtitle of Condillac’s Commerce). The prestige of Newton’s Principia doubtless assisted its diffusion as is evident in Condillac’s definition in his Traité des Systèmes, “a system is more perfect when its principles are few in number: even better still when they are reduced to one” (Oeuvres I: 121). See Perrot, Histoire, 73, for a table of the rapidly increasing number of works published (in French) in the eighteenth century with système, principes, and théorie in their titles.\n\n66 William Petty, Preface to Political Arithmetic (1690) in Charles Hull, ed., Economic Writings of Sir William Petty, 2 volumes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1899), I: 244. Though the term “political arithmetic” appears in the title of several of Petty’s pamphlets, he nowhere else spells out what he means. A contemporary commenting on Petty’s Two Essays in Political Arithmetic (1687) upon their publication observed positively that he had “made it appear that Mathematical Reasoning is not only applicable to Line and Numbers but also affords the best means of Judging in all concerns of humane life” in Petty, Economic Writings, II, 513 n. Notwithstanding that observation, the apparent contrast between (implicitly) rhetoric and the objectivity of the quantifiable should not be overdrawn. See Ted McCormick, William Petty and the Ambitions of Political Arithmetic (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 10, cf. 303. Nonetheless McCormick (5) also summarizes the broad scholarly agreement that political arithmetic was a “methodological innovation that brought the quantitative techniques and empirical spirit of the Scientific Revolution to practical questions of economy, society and politics.” Paul Slack claims political arithmetic is “the most striking manifestation” of the “deliberate creation of political economy” (The Invention of Improvement [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015], 3, cf. 91).\n\n67 Charles Davenant called Petty a “great genius” for beginning political arithmetic, which Davenant defined as “the art of reasoning by figures upon things relating to government.” However, he judged Petty to have built his calculations on false premises. Nonetheless, Davenant affirms, the “faculty of computing” is the way to give a true account of the balance of trade provided it “draws its conclusions from many premises.” Discourses on the Public Revenues and on Trade, in Charles Whitworth, ed., Works, 5 volumes (London, 1771), 1: 127, 129, 146, 149–150. But Cantillon upbraided both Petty and Davenant because as political arithmeticians they dealt only with effects, not causes and principles, Essai, 16. Smith would seem to agree (see below).\n\n77 Ibid., I: 218. The reference here to “free people” is a clear signal of his adherence to the modern liberty as freedom under the law and his rejection of the ancient liberty of the classical moralists; he is explicit that he is dealing with “modern politics” (see ibid., I: 319, I: 6, 217).\n\n89 In his rhetoric lectures Smith judges the “Newtonian method,” in contrast to the “Aristotelian,” the “most philosophical” because it deduces phenomena from a principle and “all united in one chain.” Adam Smith, Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres, ed. J. Bryce (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Press, 1985), 146. John Millar who attended Smith’s lectures linked his achievement to Newton’s, An Historical View of the English Government, ed. M. Salber Phillips and Dale Smith (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Press, 2006), 404 n.\n\n90 Lal, Deepak and Myint, Hia, for example, in language heavily reminiscent of Smith, declare that they use the term “political economy” to “direct attention to political, institutional and historical factors affecting economic growth and income distribution.” The Political Economy of Poverty, Equity and Growth (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), 7Google Scholar. For the articulation of a path from Smith, contrary to the route to neoclassicism, see Moral Sentiments and Material Interests, ed. Herbert Gintis et al. (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005) chap. 1.\n\n91 See, illustratively, Tucker who declares there is “a natural Disposition or instinctive Inclination, of Mankind towards Commerce,” Elements, 3. There is nothing novel here; a hundred fifty years earlier John Wheeler proclaimed that there is “nothing in the world so ordinarie and naturall unto men as to contract, truck, merchandise, and trafficke one with another,” A Treatise of Commerce (London: 1601), 6. That commerce was coeval with human society was a standardly drawn implication of the Providential arrangement that humans were not self-sufficient. (It is beyond the scope of this essay to pursue this question.)\n\n93 See inter alia Hume, Essays, 263; Smith, Wealth, “Introduction,” 4/10. As Smith professed in his lectures, opulence as well as freedom is a “blessing.” Lectures on Jurisprudence, ed. R. L. Meek, D. D. Raphael, P. G. Stein (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Press, 1982), 185, 453. For more on this see Berry, Luxury, chap. 6 and Christopher J. Berry, Idea of Commercial Society in the Scottish Enlightenment (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2013), chap. 3."
