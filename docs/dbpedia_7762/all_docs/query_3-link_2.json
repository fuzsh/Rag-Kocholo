        "text": "Adam Smith (Author)\n\nIn his classic book The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith attacks Mandeville’s contention that all public spirited or altruistic behavior is merely self interested. He bases his arguments on the strength of human sympathy and our social natures. Of course Smith acknowledges the importance of self interest in his other major work, The Wealth of Nations but unlike Mandeville he believes self interest and other regarding interest are both natural and compatible for in a successful society.\n\nFriedrich August von Hayek (Author)\n\nHayek praised Mandeville and was heavily influenced by Mandeville’s arguments on self-deception and biases. Hayek included discussions about Mandeville’s writing in The Road to Serfdom, Individualism: True and False as well as his classic AER article The Use of Knowledge in Society.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes (Author)\n\nKeynes cited Mandeville as an historical example of the problems with an over emphasis on thrift in society and his own theory of “effective demand”. Keynes was very influential in bringing Mandeville back to prominence along with Hayek, which is strange considering that the two men debated frequently over economic matters."
