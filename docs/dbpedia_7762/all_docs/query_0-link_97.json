It is centered in the historical development of current mainstream and postkeynesian economic ideas and ideas linked with the Austrian school. It shows also development of some non-orthodox economic thinking relevant in current period, especially of institutional economics. At the end of the course, some great economists are covered in more detail.\n\nThe main goal of this course is to provide students with understanding of historical roots of contemporary economic thought. In addition students are also led to reading original papers linked with the history of economic thought and to writing critical appraisals of original papers.\n\nLast update: Cahlík Tomáš, doc.
