        "meta_description": "Charles Davenant was one of the leading economic pamphleteers of the 1690s.  He frequently developed general principles, some of which sound almost like the early writings of Adam Smith.  He was, however, a Mercantilist in the sense that he underlined the advantages of a favourable balance of trade as a source of political power, favoured population growth and decried luxury spending.",
