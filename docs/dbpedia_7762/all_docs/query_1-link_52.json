        "text": "Poésie fugitive – according to Diderot’s definition, light verse which escapes its author’s quill to circulate beyond its initial communicative context – was ubiquitous in eighteenth-century France. Italian, German, and English authors from Goethe to Samuel Johnson refer to poésie fugitive as a French phenomenon, which raises questions as to why the term was not easily adapted into domestic contexts in other nations, and prompts investigation into how this type of poetry was perceived and circulated in and out of eighteenth-century France. The ‘Genre, Media and Networks’ workshop, which took place at St Edmund Hall on 11 and 12 April 2024, sought to respond to these questions, providing insight into the nature of poésie fugitive in a broader European context.\n\nAs outlined in the introduction to the workshop, Diderot’s definition leaves room for interpretation. If poésie fugitive is characterised by its capacity to ‘s’échappe[r] de la plume et du portefeuille d’un auteur’, where does it go? What drives its circulation? If it circulates ‘d’abord en manuscrit’, how and why, if at all, does it pass into print? Diderot comments on the collection and compilation of poésie fugitive; how do such practices impact its perceived ephemerality? The papers provided a range of insights from differing perspectives, responding to these questions, and raising further ones.\n\nJean-Alexandre Perras examined the circulation of verse as part of a system of étrennes gift exchange, particularly in private aristocratic circles. Among other material gifts, these poems often accompanied parfilage, an expensive leisurely pastime characterised by unproductive labour, which parallels the poems’ ephemerality and frivolity. As Nicholas pointed out in a question following Jean-Alexandre’s paper, the poems’ frivolous nature and capacity for reuse mirror the reuse of gold and other materials in the parfilage pieces they often accompany.\n\nEphemeral and ‘frivolous’ verse was by no means restricted to France in the eighteenth century. Andrew Kahn explained in his paper on ‘the point of signifying nothing’, how Russian poets of the period wrote self-proclaimed ‘mere trifles’. In part reacting against moral Christian writing on idleness and excessive pleasure, poets wrote light verse acknowledging, even advertising commitment to, leisure time and frivolity. Themselves ‘forgettable and transient’, there is a paradoxical durability to these poems, afforded by their capacity to be re-read. Russian poems of this sort are often a vessel for reflections on life and death, containing messages of emptiness in love and life, and the transience of permanence, such as Derzhavin’s ‘The River of Time’ (‘Река времён’, 1816). The frivolous, ephemeral, ‘fugitive’ nature of the light-verse form itself aptly reflects such philosophical content.\n\nKate Tunstall focussed on the work of Mme Bourette, or la Muse limonadière, an eighteenth-century Parisian businesswoman who published poetry alongside managing her Café Allemand. Kate, like Jean-Alexandre, discussed the role of verse in eighteenth-century gift-giving, which was key to Mme Bourette’s poetic production. However, in tension with the essentially frivolous and ephemeral nature of the poetry-gift, the work of Mme Bourette reveals a marked attempt towards ‘making her work stick’. Though Bourette maintains that her poetry itself is indeed a leisure activity, the publication of her recueil was linked to more serious commercial pursuits. Using her sobriquet, La Muse limonadière, as its title, this recueil builds upon consistent self-fashioning efforts, Mme Bourette constructing a brand for herself. Kate explored the role of poetry in Bourette’s business, her poems, fugitive by their nature as gifts, operating in a system of poetic exchange doubling as a means of prompting debt repayment. Kate’s paper ultimately revealed how circulation of light, ‘frivolous’ verse can be underpinned by more weighty socio-economic driving forces, Mme Bourette creating, marketing, and circulating poetry intended for leisure and gift-giving as part of a broader framework of commercial tactics.\n\nStéphanie Loubère discussed Dorat’s critical paratextual reflections – ‘« De longues préfaces » pour « de petits écrits »’ – on poésie légère. Establishing light verse ‘dans le système des genres’, Dorat theorised this type of poetry, in part, to legitimise it, promoting its value and situating it in its literary history. Dorat’s poetic reflections highlight the particular qualities afforded by light verse – its ‘style bagatelle’, and its ‘court et rapide’ character. Like Andrew Kahn’s, then, Stéphanie’s paper highlighted the particular value of poésie légère, exploring how and why a poet might make ‘le choix du petit’.\n\nKevin Hilliard offered another perspective on eighteenth-century perceptions of the value of poésie fugitive discussing eighteenth-century French and German efforts to collect and compile brochures and feuilles. Commenting on the prestige and solidity of published recueils of fugitive poetry, Kevin focussed particularly upon Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim’s compilation and translations of French poésie légère into German, namely, his Zwey Gedichte (1772). Gleim’s idealisation of (French) ephemeral communications and the perceived ‘pristine’ nature of the feuille volante is underscored by his printing tactics. Franco-German exchange, here, operates on a typographical level: the poems are printed not in Fraktur, but in a mock-hand typeset, ‘als Manuskript, für Freunde’, seeking to reproduce the essence of the original French manuscript, in print. Kevin’s paper challenged modern disjunctions between print and manuscript: printed pieces, as we saw from Gleim’s Zwey Gedichte, could function as manuscript, produced in low numbers, circulated privately. In turn, the possibility of having many scribes working on multiple manuscript copies of texts further evidences the fluidity of this boundary, such texts ‘straddling the division between the book trade and private circles’. These insights point to the instability of terms such as ‘public’ and ‘private’, demonstrating how the passage of verse from manuscript into print did not necessarily constitute entrance into a more ‘public’ sphere – rather, ‘a change in medium’.\n\nRoman Kuhn further demonstrated the instability of the distinction between print and manuscript, and public and private transmission. Poésie fugitive, as Roman explained, does not stop at publication: rather, it can be re-published over and over, and also migrate back and forth between manuscript and print. Responding to the question of how texts connected to a particular event in space and/or time could circulate and re-circulate, Roman underscored the role played by periodicals such as the Mercure de France in inviting the reuse and circulation of texts outside of the perhaps more restricted authorial networks in which they originated. The adaptation of texts to new circumstances, which we might name ‘textual reuse’, is a key means by which texts might circulate beyond their original communicative setting.\n\nBetty Schellenberg offered further perspectives on text reuse and the relationship between verse and manuscript. Betty explained how, despite the perceived ephemerality of manuscript verse, the process of circulation could render it more durable if it found its way into miscellanies, which can be seen as ‘storage repositories’. Betty’s paper, then, further evidenced the capacity for manuscript to offer qualities one might expect from print – here, longevity – in contrast to its perceived ephemerality.\n\nNicholas Cronk explored poetry as a form of epistolary sociability in Voltaire’s correspondence. Nicholas outlined the generic confusion raised by the poem-letter – or, indeed, the letter-poem. Poésie fugitive is not defined by authorial intervention: some, Voltaire intends as part of his oeuvre; some is intended only for its original recipient, but nonetheless escapes beyond initial circles of private correspondence, circulating in manuscript or finding its way into print in periodicals or recueils.\n\nThe workshop’s introduction raised questions about how texts invite reuse, to which the papers offered a broad selection of fruitful responses. Betty outlined how a piece might be reproduced in a commonplace book as a means of demonstrating taste or providing oneself with reading material, which corresponds with Diderot’s description of fugitive pieces compiled ‘tantôt pour le bon goût’; Kevin’s paper evidenced how the very form of such poems as fugitive and ephemeral prompted Gleim to compile and translate them; Kate and Jean-Alexandre both highlighted how the poem-gift often accompanied the expectation of reciprocity in various ways. Indeed, Nicholas’s paper responded to questions regarding the driving forces behind text reuse by demonstrating the impact of Voltaire’s fame and literary authority upon the circulation of poetry.\n\nThe flexible nature and often complicated circulation and history of poésie fugitive raise questions concerning how these poems can be represented in databases and digital collections. Alexander Huber offered insights into how digital methods can provide clarity for navigating nebulous poetic corpora. Digital repositories such as the Romantic Period Poetry Archive (RPPA), hosted by the Primary Source Materials & Scholarship (PRISMS) infrastructure, which relies on a Linked Open Data architecture, can help identify points of contact, and perhaps open avenues for further research into poésie fugitive in trans-national contexts.\n\nPoésie fugitive is a complex and heterogeneous phenomenon – in its origins, authorship, readership, and medium. Not only was French fugitive poetry idealised both in France and elsewhere in Europe; poems which escape their author’s ‘plume’ and circulate across communicative networks originate in other countries, such as Britain and Russia. In a previous blog post, Roman highlights the degree to which poésie fugitive ‘permeated many aspects of life’ in eighteenth-century France, blurring boundaries between ‘the mundane and the poetic’. The papers in the workshop further challenged distinctions such as public versus private, manuscript versus print, and ephemerality versus durability, attesting to the capacity for this generically ambiguous textual form to destabilise such binary oppositions, calling for a nuanced understanding of these aspects of eighteenth-century literary life.\n\n– Rebekah Goodchild\n\nIn an earlier blogpost, I wrote about Lespinasse’s last will and testament, her insistent request for D’Alembert to have her head opened soon after her death, her bequest to him of a chiffonnière with nine drawers because she had heard him say he loved drawers, and her instructions as to what he should do with the papers that he would find when he opened the drawers of the desk and large cupboard she also left him. In this blogpost, I want to say a bit more about the only papers she asked him not to burn, her manuscripts, some loose, some bound, four volumes of which are today at the Voltaire Foundation.\n\nIf they have not been studied to date, it is no doubt, at least in part, because what she calls ‘mes manuscrits’ were not hers in the sense in which we now tend to understand that phrase, which is to say they are not, for the most part, writings by her in her hand. Lespinasse is largely neither the author nor the copyist, and most of her manuscripts were hers only in the sense that she owned them. To use another phrase from her last will and testament, they were ‘ce que j’ai d’ecrit’. Moreover, what she had by way of writing did not consist in manuscripts in the usual sense of that term: they are not, for the most part, autographs. The texts are, for the most part, not in the hands of their authors. So, what did Lespinasse own and bequeath?\n\nCopies of and extracts from a wide range of texts by a wide range of writers (Fig. 1), reproduced in mostly very neat and sometimes quite beautiful handwriting (Fig. 2) by a large number of unidentified copyists, working from printed as well as manuscript sources.\n\nFour of these manuscript volumes ended up at the Voltaire Foundation because when they came up for sale in Paris in May 1968, Theodore Besterman bought them, and he did so because among the many different texts they contain, there are numerous copies of letters to and from Voltaire, notably the exchange between D’Alembert and Voltaire in which the latter addresses ‘Bertrand’ and signs off ‘Raton’. I think it’s right to say that all the letters in this exchange had already appeared in print by the time Besterman came to add them to his edition and that Lespinasse’s copy is in some cases the only contemporary manuscript instance we have. But this is not all the volumes contain; very far from it.\n\nThere are items from many other major correspondences of the eighteenth century, those of Catherine II of Russia, Frederic II of Prussia, Mme Geoffrin, J.-J. Rousseau, Galiani. Some of these letters had already appeared in print, though it’s not clear whether any were copied from print or not, and certainly some must have been copied from manuscript. There are songs and verses on a wide variety of events and occasions, and there are ‘Vers trouvés dans la poche d’un jeune homme qui venait de perdre sa maîtresse, le désespoir le porta a prendre de l’opium, mais trouvant le poison trop lent, il se tua d’un coup de pistolet le 27 juillet 1753 Rue de l’Orangerie à Versailles dans un hotel garni’; and ‘Vers envoiés a la Cour pour mettre sous le portrait de Mr. d’Alembert’, and ‘Vers d’un agonisant pour le portrait d’un homme qui ne mourra point’ (Fig. 3).\n\nThere also are literary portraits from the memoirs of the cardinal de Retz and by the marquis de Lassay, Deffand and Lespinasse; there are philosophical treatises, including a ‘Discours sur l’immortalité de l’ame’ and a ‘Du suicide’, neither attributed to Hume in the manuscript though they are certainly his and were first published in French translation; there’s an ‘Avis à ceux qui ont plus de goût que de fortune, ou Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre de M. Diderot’, an ‘Aventure d’un jeune officier anglois chez les sauvages Abenakis tirée de mémoires particuliers’ (Fig. 2), and a ‘Suite du Voiage sentimental’, the latter by Lespinasse, though not in her hand (Fig. 4).\n\nThere are pages and pages of synonyms (Fig. 5), some but not all of which appeared in the Encyclopédie, signed ‘0’ for D’Alembert, an exception being ‘Simplicité, modestie’, which I also found among the loose papers in the Fonds Guizot in Lespinasse’s hand.\n\nAnd there are pages of excerpts from Émile, La Nouvelle Héloïse and many other works, some of which are in Lespinasse’s hand (Fig. 6).\n\nThanks to the generosity of the OUP John Fell Fund, I have a small grant to work on what I am calling ‘Lespinasse’s Manuscript Miscellany,’ and I have my work cut out. We need to establish what the texts are, where they were copied from, whether they are all copies, and if any pieces are original. Do any also appear in other manuscript recueils? A brief look at Deffand’s miscellaneous papers along with her bound recueil in the Lewis Walpole Library at Yale already suggests some commonalities. What authors are present? Some are named; some are not but are obvious, such as Diderot; others I have identified, such as Saint-Lambert and Hume; but many are yet to be. And how important a concept even is the author in Lespinasse’s legacy? Can we identify the copyists? We know that the philosophes shared copyists; can we find any of them here? And what do the texts say together as a collection? The Enlightenment is usually (and rightly) thought of as an age of print with manuscript being reserved for ‘radical’ texts; but is this evidence of a different kind of manuscript Enlightenment? And what can Lespinasse’s bequest tell us, if anything, about her activities in the socio-literary world? None of these questions has a simple answer.\n\nWith respect to that final question, in fact, when you open a volume, you might be forgiven for asking the same question as the sleeping D’Alembert in Diderot’s comic dialogue Le Rêve de D’Alembert: ‘Qui est là? Est-ce vous, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse?’. For if you can find her hand, it’s not her head, and if you find her head, the text is someone else’s hand. But I am glad to be making an attempt, nearly two hundred and fifty years after her death, to open her manuscripts and, perhaps in so doing, look inside her head.\n\n– Kate Tunstall\n\nThis two-part blogpost uses some of the material I presented at a panel run by Andrew Clark and Joanna Stalnaker on ‘Women and Posterity’ at the 2024 ASECS meeting in Toronto.\n\nMany of us educated in the humanities in the 1990s and 2000s came to intellectual consciousness having been taught that ‘the Enlightenment’ was something not far short of a dirty word. Whether it was Adorno and Horkheimer’s denunciation of the ‘dialectic of the Enlightenment’ as radiating ‘disaster triumphant’ in the totalitarian states, Michel Foucault’s denunciation of the disciplinary powers undergirding modern states’ supposed advocacy of rights and liberties, or Martin Heidegger’s depiction of the modern age as characterised by nihilistic ‘will to will’ looking back to Descartes’s cogito …, all these authorities presented the European ‘Enlightenment’ as a sort of nightmare, from which we needed to reawaken.\n\nAs Dennis Rasmussen has masterfully documented, a host of charges are laid at the feet of the Enlightenment in this broadly ‘postmodernist’ orbit. Generously ecumenical, the anti-Enlightenment consensus takes in proponents of positions we might otherwise suppose to be deeply opposed. They converge in claims that ‘the Enlightenment’ overvalued human reason, reducing the richness of human experience and ‘difference’; that its ‘project’ is or was dangerously utopian, seeking to force the wonderful roundness of human reality into the soulless squares of theoretical and socio-political systems; that ‘it’ was single-mindedly Eurocentric, giving direction and vehemence to Western colonialism; and that all of ‘the Enlighteners’, often individually unnamed, were ‘to a man’ patriarchal, closed both to women’s rights and abilities, and to the feminine more widely, including the ludic and literary, as well as the affective components of human existence.\n\nI probably don’t need to convince readers of this blog that there was something awry in these visions of a putatively singular ‘Enlightenment’. This ‘something’ becomes clear almost as soon as we begin to test these criticisms against texts by leading figures of the French Enlightenment, led by Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Diderot. For, when we look, what period in Western thought had seen a closer, proto-postmodern rapprochement between philosophy and literature, and such a profusion of literary play, than the France of 1720–1790, excepting perhaps the Silver Age in Rome? In what period had forms of philosophical scepticism and critique played a greater role in challenging the uncontested, overly ambitious rational claims of metaphysicians and theologians? And in what period, above all, was coming to terms with what the postmodernists call ‘cultural difference’ more a primary concern than in the French Enlightenment, from Montesquieu’s Persian Letters to Abbé Raynal’s The History of the Two Indies?\n\nYet, when the postmodern criticisms of the Enlightenment were taught, rarely was any attempt made to square the damning allegations about it against the primary texts of the philosophes. Indeed, often ‘the Enlightenment’ as a more specific period of intellectual ferment and debate was subsumed silently within wider, totalising criticisms of ‘modernity’ or ‘liberalism’, with the philosophes unmentioned, or relegated to minor footnotes. Even when the Enlightenment was defended, if it was defended at all, the defence was assigned to Jürgen Habermas, whose recovery of a ‘philosophical discourse of modernity’ nevertheless shares with the postmodernist critics a more or less complete overlooking of all Enlightenment-era thinkers preceding Immanuel Kant.\n\nThe Other Enlightenment: self-estrangement, race, and gender is my attempt, as a philosopher and social theorist, to push back against the popular discrediting, and academic sidelining, of the texts of the French Enlightenment. I also want to show why doing this pushing back matters in a period where increasingly politics is divided along tribal, identitarian lines. Working in the lineage of Dennis Rasmussen’s The Pragmatic Enlightenment and Genevieve Lloyd’s Enlightenment Shadows, this little book sets out to challenge the broadly ‘postmodern’ myths about the over-rationalistic, heartless, Eurocentric Enlightenment. After revisiting the foundational critical work of Francis Bacon on the idols of the mind, John Locke on the conduct of the understanding, and the critical scepticism of Pierre Bayle, the ensuing chapters then each examine more closely specific, classic Enlightenment texts.\n\nMontesquieu’s Persian Letters, I argue, sets up what becomes a key motif of Enlightenment philosophising, the practice of self-estrangement: that is, relearning to look at what ‘we’ do, and usually take for granted, from the perspective of others, like the Persians Usbek and Rica. This practice, which allows us to resee ourselves – as well as to consider the perspectives of others whom we might characteristically overlook or prejudicially stereotype – then runs like a red thread through texts like Voltaire’s Micromégas (where the other becomes a benign giant from the planet Sirius); Diderot’s Letter on the blind, where it is people-born-blind who provide the critical mirror to the sighted; and Diderot’s Supplement to Bougainville’s Voyage, where the others are the Tahitians, from the Moses-like Elder who ringingly denounces European imperialism near the start, to the more diminutive but no less discerning, Orou.\n\nThe Other Enlightenment is a book which aims, like many Enlightenment texts, to span different audiences in different disciplines. For many specialists on the Enlightenment, much of what the text examines will hence not be novel. What I hope is more novel, and more impactful, given the state of wider debates about the Enlightenment, is that the book shows, by textual analyses, the spuriousness of many of today’s more popular claims about the Enlightenment.\n\n– Matthew Sharpe (Deakin University, Australia)\n\nRuggero Sciuto’s Determinism and Enlightenment: the collaboration of Diderot and d’Holbach is the April volume in the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment series. This book examines the theory of determinism jointly put forward by Diderot and d’Holbach to better understand their philosophy as well as their position relative both to one another and to the so-called ‘Radical Enlightenment’. In this blog post, Ruggero Sciuto provides a short introduction to the main issues discussed in the volume.\n\nThey were born ten years apart, one in Langres, Haute-Marne, in 1713, the other in Edesheim, Rhineland-Palatinate, in 1723. A four-hour car ride today; in all respects a much more significant distance by eighteenth-century standards. They ended up buried one next to the other, in a small chapel in the Parisian church of Saint-Roch. Despite occasional squabbles and misunderstandings, Denis Diderot and Baron Paul Thiry d’Holbach, two of the most brilliant minds of their century, were very close collaborators. It is not just that Diderot read some of d’Holbach’s works before publication – that he washed the baron’s ‘dirty rags’, as Diderot himself put it. It is not just that both writers collaborated on such iconic, monumental texts of early-modern Europe as the Encyclopédie and the Histoire des deux Indes. Day after day, in Paris or at d’Holbach’s country house in Sucy-en-Brie (the now destroyed château du Grandval), our two authors engaged in lively discussions that informed their atheist, materialist, and deterministic philosophical views.\n\n‘Comme Jacques et son maître, Diderot et d’Holbach ne peuvent pas aller l’un sans l’autre’, wrote Yves Benot in 1981.[1] Of course, the one is not the other. And yet scholars have perhaps insisted more than necessary on their alterity. Dogmatic is arguably the adjective that is most commonly associated with d’Holbach.[2] And sure enough, in his rejection of superstition and religious fanaticism, the baron is often as dogmatic and intransigent as some of the clerics against whom he so vehemently fulminates. When it comes to philosophy, too, d’Holbach may easily come across as dogmatic: seemingly blinded by his systematic aspirations, he appears to proceed at full speed and to disregard any objections as nonsensical. And yet two points ought to be made. First: the formidable machine that is d’Holbach’s style is specifically designed to convince, even mesmerise the reader and conceal any hesitations and underlying inconsistencies.[3] Second: the apparent rigidity of his thinking is in no way indicative of a simple understanding of reality. If, as beautifully argued by Pierre Saint-Amand, Diderot is indeed a penseur de la complexité, the same can and should be said of d’Holbach.[4]\n\nThe situation with Diderot is symmetrical. Many recent studies (I am thinking primarily of books and articles by Jean-Claude Bourdin, Colas Duflo, Gerhardt Stenger, Marian Hobson, Marx Wartofsky, Timo Kaitaro, Caroline Warman, and Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt) have finally rectified the old interpretation, most famously expressed by Yvon Belaval and Robert Loyalty Cru, according to which Diderot would be too disconnected, inconsistent, and unoriginal a philosopher truly to deserve a place in the pantheon of Philosophy proper. And yet, because of the complexity of his works, in particular because of the light, playful tone that he adopts in many of them, the inner consistency of Diderot’s thought – its ‘secret unity’, as Francis Pruner would have it – still remains too often ignored.[5]\n\nAdopting a comparative, to an extent synthetic, methodology that is fundamentally in keeping with Diderot’s ‘analogy-seeking mode of thought’, my new book unveils precisely some hidden similarities between Diderot’s and d’Holbach’s ideas.[6] It does so by looking specifically at the theory of determinism that, I argue, the two philosophers jointly put forward, a theory that seeks to combine a fairly traditional form of causal determinism based on a strong interpretation of causation as necessitation with a nascent nomological determinism with laws of nature at its core.\n\nThis theory, I suggest, draws on a number of different sources, including many Christian ones, manipulating and reinterpreting them to create a harmonious new whole. It addresses many criticisms that were commonly levelled against determinism, takes shape in response to external philosophical stimuli – most notably the publication of Hume’s works, with their famous, yet not unequivocal reinterpretation of the notion of causation –, and bears the marks of a resolute attempt to reconcile the often-contrasted notions of necessity and becoming, offering new and articulate responses to questions that are still very much debated today.\n\nIn as much as it brings to light Diderot’s and d’Holbach’s links with the Christian philosophical tradition, this book also problematises the two philosophers’ atheism, further questioning the notion that the so-called ‘Radical Enlightenment’ can be taken to represent a complete break with ‘the old’. Perhaps counterintuitively, at the same time as it brings Diderot and d’Holbach closer to one another, my book takes the two philosophers farther away from Jonathan Israel’s ‘Radical Enlightenment’. It is not that I question Diderot’s and d’Holbach’s radicalism. Quite the contrary: as I write this blog I am starting to work on a new monograph project tracing the reception of d’Holbach’s political ideas in Revolutionary France! Indeed, I share Israel’s belief that the Radical Enlightenment (or eighteenth-century culture more broadly) may hold the key to countering some of the most dangerous threats that our modern democracies have to face: fundamentalism and intellectual apathy. And yet, if it does so, it is not because of its supposedly fully coherent rationalist and uncompromising philosophy. It is because of its malleability and openness to dialogue.\n\nDiderot and d’Holbach’s philosophical dialogue is part and parcel of a much broader conversation that joins together a wide array of Enlightenment thinkers. For, as noted by Dorinda Outram and Antoine Lilti, the Enlightenment is best characterised as a series of debates around key themes and concepts, rather than as a single movement with a well-defined intellectual agenda.[7] The set of keywords related to causation that lie at the heart of my book – cause, reason, necessity, machine, law, freedom – are frequently noted and even celebrated in isolation as slogans of Enlightenment. But considering them as interlinked concepts that thinkers used to formulate dynamic ideas about how the world works can refresh and transform our views of Enlightenment thought. Unveiling this hidden language can help us, I believe, to grasp better than ever before the why and the how of Enlightenment philosophy and literature.\n\n– Ruggero Sciuto\n\n[1] Yves Benot, Diderot: de l’athéisme à l’anticolonialisme (Paris, 1981), p.44.\n\n[2] See, however, Alan Charles Kors’ extremely interesting recent article on ‘Holbach’s Skepticism’, in L.

Playing cards, new and used, were an everyday presence in the households of the rich and poor, in the city as well as in the countryside. Voltaire used them to invite visitors to attend private theatricals at Ferney, or to send private notes to his female and male correspondents.[1] Rousseau kept them in his pockets during his solitary walks, pulling them out to record reveries that later found their way into his published work. Diderot complained about the appearance of eighteenth-century face cards, noting that it was surprising how poorly they were drawn given the generally good taste of the French in visual matters.[2] These philosophes were not the only ones who took note of playing cards, but their attention to both sides of these ephemeral pieces of paper points to a material and aesthetic sensibility lost today. In eighteenth-century France, the fronts of playing cards were carefully regulated by the royal government, which sought to extract excise revenue for state coffers. The backs of cards, mostly blank in France until the 1820s, offered up empty white spaces to be filled with information, notes, and serious and frivolous forms of communication. Playing cards were much more than gaming accessories in France during the Enlightenment.\n\nBeginning in 1701, the royal government insisted that the design of face cards conform to a standard pattern; examples sporting unauthorised face card designs betrayed the fact that their manufacturers had not paid a stamp tax to the crown. Woodblocks similar to the one reproduced here were kept in the tax collector’s office. Card-makers would bring their specially manufactured card stock to the taxman’s bureau to imprint the outlines of these face cards. They would then return to their shops and colour in the outlines using stencils and paint. Imprints taken from woodblocks by tax collectors were used for verification purposes when inspecting cards found in shops, residences, and gambling establishments. Cards that did not conform to the official design were labelled ‘fraudulent’, and fines assessed. This process of standardisation provided card-makers with little opportunity or motivation to improve the visual appearance of their cards, resulting in misshapen figures on face cards. A king and queen of hearts printed in Lyon in the period exemplify the problem. The figures on these cards have crossed eyes, strangely shaped crowns, and disproportionate bodies. Shop workers have applied colour carelessly to the outlines impressed from the woodblock. No wonder Diderot expressed dismay!\n\nWhile royal taxation practices led master card-makers to produce bizarrely designed and poorly executed face cards, the king’s subjects nevertheless saved these cards when they were too worn for gaming purposes, flipping them over to repurpose their blank backsides. Paper was scarce and expensive, leading the French to reuse the cards for bureaucratic, commercial, domestic, and reflective purposes. The first library card catalogues were recorded on the backs of playing cards; over 200,000 examples can still be consulted in the Bibliothèque Mazarine in Paris. Law clerks reused them as file labels for court cases. Shop keepers and businessmen printed their calling cards on the backs, and the army used them as ration cards. Domestics used them to compile laundry lists, and salon-goers enjoyed flirtatious games based on provocative sayings printed on the reverse sides.\n\nWhile the Neuchâtel University Library conserves 27 cards with scribbles made by Rousseau during his al fresco wanderings, the Geneva Library houses a cache of 35,000 playing cards annotated by the eighteenth-century physicist Georges-Louis Lesage, who used them to record scientific observations as well as tortured investigations into his own psyche. The backs of these cards, along with many other examples that survive in libraries and archives in France and elsewhere today, provide flashes of insight into lives that are mostly unknown centuries later.\n\nThe contrast, therefore, between the fronts and the backs of eighteenth-century French playing cards tells a story about government regulation and everyday life before the Revolution. The recto sides speak to us of significant intervention in the production and consumption of playing cards. To extract revenue from this increasingly popular commercial good, the state regulated manufacture in ways that could not have escaped observant card players. The verso sides, recycled when too worn for gaming purposes, bear witness to both mundane concerns and deeper reflections beyond the purview of the state. These ephemeral scraps of paper manage to combine testimony of privileges claimed by the crown with surprisingly varied perspectives on the material lives and private thoughts of the king’s subjects. They allow the historian to shuffle her deck of historical themes, perhaps coming up with new insights in the same way that Old Regime card players hoped to stumble into profit at the card table.\n\n– Jeffrey S.

It was intended (as we said in our publicity materials at the time) ‘to make available the work of the Voltaire Foundation’s authors to the widest audience in an affordable, paperback format’. Since we are known as the ‘VF’, and we wanted our new series to be lively, we called it Vif – French for ‘lively, alert, or snappy’. Nine of the snappy volumes from the Vif series will now enjoy a second life, as part of the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment ONLINE ebook collection – the digital edition of the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment print series.\n\nThe Vif volumes being added to Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment ONLINE are of two types: critical scholarship and primary texts. Of the former, several are collections of essays, originally aimed at advanced students preparing for the agrégation in France or competency exams in the US. These books treat, respectively, Voltaire’s influential manifesto for religious toleration, the Traité sur la tolérance; Diderot’s innovative play Le Fils naturel; and Marivaux’s journalism and theatre.\n\nThere is also a scholarly monograph by James Fowler, Voicing Desire, addressing themes of family and sexuality in Diderot’s fiction. Finally, we include an important study of Voltaire’s Dictionnaire philosophique by Christiane Mervaud, who is the author of the authoritative critical edition of this work in the Complete works of Voltaire. An expanded version of introduction to that edition became this book and has remained the definitive study of the text.\n\nThe second set of books from the Vif being republished in Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment ONLINE are three works which are editions of eighteenth-century French texts. The first is an edition of short stories by the author Jeanne Marie Le Prince de Beaumont (1711–1780). Best remembered now for writing a version of The Beauty and the Beast (1756), she was a prolific writer, producing some 70 volumes. The anthology published here, entitled Contes et autres écrits, is the first comprehensive introduction to her work. The second, entitled Vivre libre et écrire, provides a series of extracts from novels written by women during the French Revolution. The Revolution brought a marked increase in the number of books attributed to women authors, but many of these works are immensely hard to find. This pioneering anthology makes a selection of them available for the first time, expertly introduced by Huguette Krief.\n\nPerhaps the single most successful woman writer of the French eighteenth century is Françoise de Graffigny (1695–1758), author of a best-selling novel, the Lettres d’une péruvienne, and of a play successfully performed at the Comédie-française, Cénie. Her life reads like a novel, and the best biography, English Showalter’s Françoise de Graffigny: her life and works (2004) can be consulted in Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment ONLINE. Graffigny’s greatest achievement is perhaps her magnificent correspondence, amounting to some 2,500 letters. The Voltaire Foundation has previously published a critical edition of her correspondence, edited by a team of scholars under the direction of J. A. Dainard. In praising this edition, Heidi Bostic wrote that the ‘Correspondence may well come to be regarded as the crown jewel of Graffigny’s œuvre. Her letters not only charm with their wit, insight, and style, but also document diverse aspects of eighteenth-century French culture and society’ (Eighteenth-century studies, 2008). Not everyone, sadly, has time to read all 15 volumes, so English Showalter produced a handy one-volume selection of the best of her letters, which is included here as well.\n\nThese Vif volumes contain important scholarship about the French philosophes and make a crucial contribution to expanding our knowledge of women authors in the period. By integrating these volumes into Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment ONLINE, we are not only making this research more easily available; we are also enriching it by making it cross-searchable with the existing treasures of the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment print series.\n\n– Nicholas Cronk, Director of the Voltaire Foundation, University of Oxford\n\n– Gregory Brown, General Editor for the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment\n\nThis post first appeared in the Liverpool University Press blog.\n\nMust they? Ian Hamilton Finlay is the author of this startling command. It is one of his Detached Sentences on Gardening (1980-1998): Finlay was a concrete poet and artist who developed a now-renowned garden by the name of Little Sparta, just to the south of Edinburgh, from the late 1960s onwards. His work, we read, is characterised by an ‘unwavering engagement with the relationship between civilisation and violence’, which his curious ‘detached sentence’ presumably illustrates in the way it connects the garden centre to the Jacobin Club and thence to ‘the new Revolution’. Yet it still seems rather hard to perceive the route from political engagement to garden centre.\n\nFinlay was, it appears, directly influenced in the form and subject of his ‘detached sentences’ by William Shenstone’s Unconnected Thoughts on Gardening (1764). Shenstone was a poet, landowner and landscape gardener. Consultation of his Unconnected Thoughts does not reveal a revolutionary, but it does reveal a dogmatist who opposes the straight line. Not for him the admiration Montaigne expresses in his essay ‘Des Coches’ (On Coaches) for the straight, wide, paved, walled, tree-lined, stream-washed and generally highly usable road linking Quito to Cusco. Shenstone, on the contrary, slams ‘strait-lined avenues’ as giving ‘actual pain to a person of taste’. He singles out two ‘famous vistas’, one in Russia and the other in India, for his particular ire, and this is the comparison he makes: ‘For [a person of taste] to be condemned to pass along the famous vista from Moscow to Petersburg, or that other from Agra to Lahore in India, must be as disagreeable a sentence, as to be condemned to labour at the gallies.’ What, really? Here we find taste and politics brought together with a vengeance. This nasty brew of British imperial superciliousness is so potent, so intoxicating, that it enables Shenstone to use his reference to a vicious penal system as part of a pithy put-down of other tastes, other cultures, other countries. On he goes, empathising with the experience of the galley convict: ‘I conceived some idea of the sensation he must feel’, he says, ‘from walking but a few minutes, immured, betwixt lord D’s high-shorn yew hedges.’\n\nAnd here, in amongst Lord D’s hedges, is where I ended up, not along a straight line, but after several diversions and detours as pleasingly various as anything the disagreeable Shenstone might have endorsed, and understanding rather better than before how civilization and violence might come together in a garden prospect.\n\nWhere I started off was, however, somewhere else entirely: I gave a paper last May at the Voltaire Foundation’s Enlightenment Workshop, run by Nicholas Cronk and Avi Lifschitz. I was talking about eighteenth-century French materialist thought upstream and downstream of Diderot. I was wondering about style and voice and recognisability, and I was trying to understand whether materialist thought – that beast so loathed and reviled by the censoring authorities that it had to go about in disguise, or at least its authors did – had other ways of making itself visible and ensuring its perpetuation. I was wondering whether the repetition of arguments or examples might be part of that, and whether, if what you’re looking at is the ongoing flow of collective voices, it is legitimate or even possible to identify particular ones within the flow.\n\nBasically, I was trying to understand whether Diderot’s late medico-philosophical text the Eléments de physiologie was or was not being cited in Revolutionary Paris of the 1790s; I was also trying to understand what sort of arguments or tools I could use to find this out, given the wall-to-wall silence regarding it; and finally, I was trying to understand whether there’s something somehow against-the-grain in my approach, given that materialist thought tends to privilege connections and the ebb-and-flow of the whole, and does not see any one part as meaningful when separated from any of the rest (thereby interestingly meeting a historicist approach to texts and contexts). Diderot’s work shows this over and over, whether we’re looking at bees in a swarm, an organ in a body, a workman and his loom, a hanger-on in a society of sycophants, or indeed at matter in the universe. And there you have it: the problem in a nutshell. Nobody apart from Diderot writes about this so imaginatively, so interestingly, so self-reflexively. And he’s the one talking about inseparability, the whole being greater than the part, and so on. Back to square one.\n\nSquare one, in fact, is that Diderot’s Eléments de physiologie is supposed to be fragmentary and unfinished. You know why? Because he said so, in the preface, in which he describes himself as already dead, and having failed to assemble these promising fragments into a complete text before sadly perishing. Strangely and/or hilariously and/or entirely understandably, this claim has always been taken at face value. Understandably, because it reappears verbatim in his disciple Naigeon’s Mémoires sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. Diderot (1823), which Diderot scholars always seem to take literally, drawing on it as an eye-witness source of factual information. Of course Naigeon was simply quoting Diderot’s own preface, not that anyone has noticed. Fragments, then: why is Diderot focusing on fragments? What is a fragment? Something unfinished, something detached (as in Finlay’s work), or unconnected (as in Shenstone’s)? Something – an element – that’s defined by its relation to the whole of which it is part and without which it has no meaning?\n\nThis is what Laura Ouillon, graduate student at the ENS Lyon, disputed. She heard about my paper from Ilya Afanasyev, a medievalist historian specialising in questions of nation and identity who attended the Enlightenment Workshop. Laura is working on Ian Hamilton Finlay, and she sent me her dissertation, ‘Mémoire et Expérience de/à Little Sparta: Le Jardin de pensée selon Ian Hamilton Finlay’, thereby introducing me to his writing, his art and his gardens. Laura is a specialist on British contemporary art, and hopes to pursue her initial work on Finlay in a doctoral thesis. She suggests that we consider the experience of the fragment as an experience in itself, as something that expresses the possibility of sharing and association, of ‘re-membering’, that even invites it. In Finlayan language, the fragment is a crucial brick in the process of bricolage, so beautifully explained by the late lamented Chris Johnson. Or as illustrated in concrete terms here by Finlay himself, with reference to the Jacobin and revolutionary Saint-Just, minus the garden centre. Or did he mean that the garden itself is a centre, a hub of new elements, new fragments?\n\nThinking about connections, juxtaposition and flow, all such crucial aspects of eighteenth-century materialist thought, even if the gorgeous notion of bricolage was not then available, one wonders what sorts of connections there are between the materialism of then and the materialism of now, and what happens if one puts their writing together. Do current theoreticians of materialism, the new materialists, with their intermediary experience of Marxism, think about eighteenth-century materialist writing, Diderot, his upstream and downstream, at all? Of course they have a dense relationship to the tradition via Deleuze and Guattari, and Foucault too. Rosi Braidotti, Distinguished University Professor at Utrecht University, important feminist philosopher and articulator of the new materialism, says this about the body. It is:\n\n‘A piece of meat activated by electric waves of desire, a text written by the unfolding of genetic encoding. Neither a sacralised inner sanctum nor a pure socially shaped entity, the enfleshed Deleuzian subject is rather an ”in-between”: it is a folding-in of external influences and a simultaneous unfolding outwards of affects. A mobile entity, an enfleshed sort of memory that repeats and is capable of lasting through sets of discontinuous variations, while remaining faithful to itself. The Deleuzian body is ultimately an embodied memory.’ [1]\n\nI like what she says, and I like her philosophical verbosity, her urgency. But is what she says new, exactly? It sounds continuous with what we read in the Eléments de physiologie:\n\n‘La douleur, le plaisir, la sensibilité, les passions, le bien ou le malaise, les besoins, les appétits, les sensations intérieures et extérieures, l’habitude, l’imagination, l’instinct, l’action propre des organes, commandent à la machine et lui commandent involontairement’ (Pain, pleasure, sensibility, the passions, well-being or discomfort, needs, appetites, internal and external sensations, habit, imagination, instinct, and the natural functioning of the organs, they all command the machine, and do so involuntarily) (Eléments de physiologie, chapter on free will).\n\nAnd in this context, what the self is, is memory. Thus: ‘la mémoire constitue le soi’ (memory constitutes the self) (Eléments de physiologie, chapter on memory). What Braidotti says, therefore, sounds more like an iteration in modern philosophical language, a renewal of the sort of thing we find in Diderot, than something completely new. As Braidotti herself says, ‘I think French philosophy is rich in minor traditions, which we would do well to revisit.’ She then confesses that her ‘personal favorite is the enchanted materialism of Diderot‘ (p.28).\n\nHow great that the affinity is recognised, even if these earlier texts are somehow downgraded, made inferior, relegated to a ‘minor tradition’? What does it matter that she engages with Diderot via the charming title of Elisabeth de Fontenay’s famous study, rather than directly with his words, he not being very likely to use the vocabulary of enchantment or magic in this context? What does it matter that Braidotti’s description of the body seems like a new version of something pretty old? What does it matter whether she knows she’s doing it or not? What does it matter if the point is simply that the collective voice is managing to make itself heard?\n\nThe answer is that it doesn’t really matter if an individual contribution is overlooked, but that it does matter if this new materialism preaches collective connectivity while conceptualising it in a flat or forward-facing time frame of now and novelty. That would be a weakness, a failure to acknowledge that connections can made backwards in time as well as sideways in space, a failure to explore the richness of retrospective ‘re-membering’ bricolage. Perhaps all we need to do is to encourage new materialists to do more of the revisiting Braidotti proposes, and rather less of the hierarchical arrangement of ‘traditions’ into ‘minor’ and ‘major’. Because who knows what might happen when you combine elements or place fragments in a new way? You might make new connections, new associations. You might even end up in a garden centre, having started off with Diderot. It might be an experience all of its own.\n\n– Caroline Warman\n\n[1] Braidotti, ‘Teratologies’, in Deleuze and Feminist Theory, ed. I. Buchanan and C.

By ‘improvement’ I refer to a word and a culture which were invented in England in the seventeenth century and had their most notable effects, at least initially, at home. Other countries might have been striving for improvement in practice in one way or another at the same time, but the English found a word which embraced every aspect of it, and fashioned out of it a frame of mind which had remarkable consequences.\n\nThe word ‘improve’ was first coined in England in the later fifteenth century, and it meant to make a profit from land. By the early seventeenth century the notion and word were being extended, by Francis Bacon, for example, who described learning as capable of being ‘improved and converted by the industry of man’. Then in the 1640s and 1650s the word was extended further by the Baconian reformers in the group led by the Prussian emigre Samuel Hartlib, some of whom went on to become founders of the Royal Society. Hartlib himself was most interested in promoting agricultural improvement, but the word and concept were already being applied to trade and banks, and were soon used about almost everything – including navigable rivers, fire engines, military power and the relief of the poor.\n\nMuch of this was propaganda for particular projects, and intended to profit their advocates. But improvers also had to their credit two major innovations in thinking about economic behaviour and the economy in general – two crucial components which English improvement carried with it into the eighteenth century. The first was the explicit defence of consumer appetites and luxury as legitimate roads to national wealth. In the 1670s Nicholas Barbon led a reaction against contemporary criticism of London as a monster consuming the wealth of the nation. Instead he pictured competitive consumption as the consequence of ‘emulation’, and a positive cause of both individual and national improvement. According to Barbon, ‘all men by a perpetual industry’ were ‘struggling to mend their former condition; and thus the people grow rich’. Here, for the first time, some of the moral brakes on economic appetites were being deliberately and explicitly relaxed. A whole generation before Bernard Mandeville’s infamous Fable of the Bees, self-interest was being presented as identical to the public interest.\n\nThe second intellectual innovation of the 1670s was the work of William Petty, whose tract, Political Arithmetick, advertised the method he had invented for conceptualising, analysing, and measuring the wealth and resources of states. Petty used it to produce for England the first set of national accounts ever devised, and from it he developed a wholly new kind of political economy which he manipulated to show how the power and wealth of England would soon rival those of France. While Barbon opened the way to unrestrained economic appetites, one might say, Petty showed how their consequences could be measured and predicted.\n\nWhen it came to the realities of England’s economic performance after 1688, therefore, the slogan of improvement was everywhere to be seen. It was wielded by advocates of the Bank of England in 1694, by supporters of the Union with Scotland in 1707, and by a crowd of promoters of trading and insurance companies and transport improvements, on whose often hazardous enterprises England’s economic success ultimately depended. By the 1720s, when Daniel Defoe publicised England as the greatest ‘trading improving nation’[1] in the world, ‘improvement’ had become shorthand for describing and justifying the dedication of the English to the pursuit of every kind of national and personal well-being.\n\nBy the 1720s too, improvement appeared to have delivered the goods. We now know that the national income had increased rapidly in the later seventeenth century; and since the population of England had stopped growing, income per head – the standard of living – had risen even more rapidly, probably by about fifty per cent in half a century, an astonishing achievement. Improvement seemed to have created England’s material affluence, and it is no accident that in the years around 1700 the word ‘affluence’ began to be used with its modern meaning, and that ‘progress’ began to be commonly applied to material progress. It was inevitable that so successful a culture should attract foreign admirers, visitors like Voltaire who came to learn its secrets, and politicians in other states who hoped, as David Hume observed, to ‘emulate’ England and adopt improvements of their own.\n\nThe full force of an improvement culture naturally travelled first and most successfully to other English dominions, to Ireland and Scotland, and especially, and with the greatest impact, to the English colonies in America, where both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson found ‘inventions of improvement’ proliferating in endless sequence. The language of English improvement moved less easily across the Channel because it needed translation, but that was no obstacle to the transmission of the intellectual content which lay beneath the word, and least of all to the transmission of English political economy. Its influence was notable, for example, in translations of John Law’s tract on improvement, Money and Trade (1705), into French and German in 1720, and in other economic works written in Paris at the time, which drew on English examples, like the three volumes by Ernst Ludwig Carl, Traité de la Richesse des Princes (1723), which pointed to England’s material improvement and economic progress, and Jean-François Melon’s Essai politique sur le commerce (1734), which had a chapter on political arithmetic, and an argument that France must imitate English industry if there was to be similar economic ‘progress’ there.\n\nThe most weighty testimony to the impact of improvement in France came in the first volume of the Encyclopédie, where Diderot himself, in a long entry on ‘arithmétique politique’, paid tribute to Petty as the first practitioner of a quantitative science indispensable for any politician concerned with trying to ensure the prosperity of a state by every possible means, including ‘la perfection de l’agriculture’. It is interesting to note that the word ‘perfection’ was used again for ‘improvement’ in translations into French of some of the works of Hume and Adam Smith also written in the 1750s. The common vocabulary suggests that something of the persuasive power of improvement had become part of what one might call Enlightenment thinking.\n\nThere were doubtless other sources, besides the writings of English improvers, which contributed to similar ways of thinking; and it is undeniable that there were whole sectors of Enlightenment thought to which English authors made little contribution. Nonetheless, when historians of the Enlightenment seek to identify its greatest contribution to Western thought, and point – as some of them do – to a new political economy aimed at ‘human betterment’, they are paying tribute to English writers on improvement of the second half of the seventeenth century. They had been the first to build a whole culture around the notion that individuals, societies and states had the capacity to ‘mend their condition’ (as Barbon put it) and to demonstrate practical ways of going about it.\n\n– Paul Slack\n\n[1] In A Tour thro’ the whole island of Great Britain (vol.1, 1724)."
