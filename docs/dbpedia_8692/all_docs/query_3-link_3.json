        "text": "Gene Hackman\n\n/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/genevoc.wav\n\nHe is among the world’s most acclaimed actors, yet ironically much of his success is because he comes across as so ordinary, so everyman. For over 50 years, Gene Hackman has been delivering indelible performances in film, theater, and television. This site explores the life and work of one of the screen’s very finest.\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks by Gene Hackman:\n\nNow that he is retired, Gene Hackman is devoting his time to writing novels — so far, three with co-writer Daniel Lenihan and one alone.\n\nHackman, Gene. Payback at Morning Peak: A Novel of the American West. New York: Pocket Books, 2011. 391 pgs. Hackman’s first solo novel is described thusly: “With only memories of his family left to him, Jubal Young rides west into New Mexico in order to bring justice, or vengeance, to the drunken renegades that took everything from him.”\n\nHackman, Gene, and Daniel Lenihan. Escape from Andersonville: A Novel of the Civil War. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2008. 342 pgs. OCLC summary: “Incarcerated within a murderous Confederate prison camp in 1864, Union officer Nathan Parker escapes and urges his superiors to intervene, but when his efforts are blocked by military higher-ups, he organizes a private rescue mission with a shady ex-soldier.”\n\nHackman, Gene, and Daniel Lenihan. Justice for None. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2004. 320 pgs. Amazon.com summary: “In their second novel, Gene Hackman and Daniel Lenihan bring to life the harsh plains and smoldering courtrooms of the Midwest: the small town of Vermilion, Illinois, on the brink of the Great Depression. Boyd Calvin is a troubled World War I veteran on the run from the law, suspected of murdering his estranged wife and her lover. Only a female reporter for the Chicago Tribune and the head of a sanitarium for veterans are not convinced of Boyd’s guilt. Boyd joins forces with another wrongly accused man, an African-American, and the two begin to face their shadowed pasts while fighting against the odds of justice.”\n\nHackman, Gene, and Daniel Lenihan. Wake of the Perdido Star. New York: Newmarket Press, 1999. 384 pgs. Hackman’s first published work is an action novel “of shipwrecks, pirates, and the sea” set in the early nineteenth century. Lenihan, Hackman’s co-writer and friend, is a noted underwater archaeologist.\n\nBooks About Gene Hackman:\n\nDespite his reputation as one of the great film actors, surprisingly little has been published about Gene Hackman in the way of full-length books. Perhaps his natural reticence and unglamorous lifestyle are reasons. The two biographies below are apparently the only English-language profiles ever published, and both were written by Britons.\n\nHunter, Alan. Gene Hackman. New York: St, Martin’s Press, 1987. 248 pgs. An unauthorized, straightforward account of Hackman’s life and work. There’s little analysis of Hackman himself, neglecting especially his early years and what may have drawn him to acting. Some good behind-the-scenes accounts, though, especially about the making of French Connection.\n\nMichael, Munn. Gene Hackman. London: Robert Hale, 1997. 192 pgs. Also quite cut-and-dried, though a bit more analytical of Hackman’s personality and working methods. Munn has spoken with Hackman numerous times throughout the years and uses these interviews well.\n\nVideos:\n\nBravo Profiles: Gene Hackman (2000). The actor gives a rare TV interview in this one-hour profile, which includes family photos and comments by collaborators. Not available on video, but check Bravo’s monthly schedule for repeat airdates.\n\nGene Hackman: Portrait of the Artist. Produced by Van Ness Films in association with Foxstar Productions and A&E Network. New York: A&E Home Video, 1996. Originally airing on A&E’s Biography, this is a solid introduction to the actor, and in some respects contains more insight than the print biographies listed above.\n\nInside the Actor’s Studio: Gene Hackman. (Originally aired 10/14/01 on the Bravo cable channel). Gene is the guest for the celebrated program’s 100th episode. As always, host James Lipton uncovers little-known information about his subject and convinces the normally shy actor to open up. This fascinating 60-minute interview is not available on video but will air again. The Bravo website has excerpts from the interview and other information about Hackman (the site’s design prevents me from including a direct link, so you’ll have to do some searching).\n\nPeriodical Articles:\n\nWhile few books have been published about Hackman, scores of newspaper and magazines stories have appeared. The list below includes just a few pieces. If you live in the Danville, Illinois area, a good source is a clippings file maintained by the Public Library’s Reference Department.\n\nBlinn, John. “Gene Hackman: Foodstyles of a Danville Celebrity Who Likes to Cook.” Danville Commercial-News, November 28, 1971, pg. 14. Profiles Gene on the verge of stardom (just before the release of French Connection) talking about his love of food, and even includes his recipe for shrimp tempura.\n\nChatfield-Taylor, Joan and Mary E. Nichols. “Gene Hackman: Santa Fe Spaces for The French Connection’s Best Actor.” Architectural Digest 47 (April 1990): 250-257+. Photographic tour of Hackman’s Southwestern-style home.\n\nCollins, Andrew. “Gene Hackman: Royal Rapscallion.” Sight & Sound, V.15, Issue 11 (November 2005): 38-41. An appreciation.\n\nCulhane, John. “Gene Hackman’s Winning Wave.” Reader’s Digest 143 (Sep 1993): 88-92. One of the few times Hackman has openly discussed his father’s abrupt departure from the family (when Gene was 13), something he surely drew on when filming I Never Sang for My Father.\n\nDreifus, Claudia. “Hackman Talks: A Rare Interview.” Connoisseur 218 (Aug 1988): 50-57.\n\nEdelstein, David. “Gene Hackman, Hollywood’s Every Angry Man.” New York Times, December 16, 2001, Section II, pgs. 21, 29. Profiles the actor, including his work on The Royal Tenenbaums.\n\nHawkes, Ellen. “The Day His Father Drove Away.” Parade Magazine (February 26, 1989): pgs. 10-12. Another account of Hackman’s father’s departure.\n\nNorman, Michael. “Hollywood’s Uncommon Everyman.” New York Times Magazine 121 (Mar 19, 1989): 28-31.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm Work:\n\nUntil his retirement, Gene Hackman was an extremely prolific film actor, appearing in up to six movies a year and nearly 90 films total. Films are listed in reverse chronological order and linked to the Internet Movie Database, where full information can be found. Films in italics are considered Hackman’s best.\n\nRunaway Jury (2003) — Hackman teams for the first time with his friend and old New York roommate, Dustin Hoffman.

Nominated: Academy Award (Best Actor); Golden Globe (Best Actor).\n\nSplit Decisions (1988).\n\nAnother Woman (1988) — A supporting role in one of Woody Allen’s best “serious” films.\n\nBat*21 (1988) — Hackman plays Iceal Hambleton in the true story of the latter’s incredible rescue behind enemy lines in Vietnam. Coincidentally, both men grew up in Vermilion County, Illinois, though they didn’t meet until promoting the film together.\n\nPower (1986).\n\nHoosiers (1986) — A big hit with audiences, it was filmed near Gene’s Illinois hometown.\n\nTarget (1985).\n\nTwice in a Lifetime (1985) — Nominated for Golden Globe (Best Actor).\n\nMisunderstood (1984).\n\nEureka (1983).\n\nTwo of a Kind (1983) (uncredited) (voice).\n\nUncommon Valor (1983).\n\nUnder Fire (1983) — Nominated for Golden Globe (Best Supporting Actor).\n\nReds (1981) — After his self-imposed retirement (begun in the late 1970’s), Hackman was convinced to return to work by writer/director/actor Warren Beatty.\n\nAll Night Long (1981) — Hackman always wanted to make a romantic comedy and got his chance here, co-starring with Barbra Streisand.\n\nSuperman II (1980) — most of Hackman’s work was filmed at the time of the first Superman film.\n\nSpeed Fever (1978).\n\nSuperman (1978) — Nominated for British Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor).\n\nLucky Lady (1975).\n\nBite the Bullet (1975) — Hackman has called this the toughest film he’s ever made.\n\nNight Moves (1975) — Nominated for British Academy Award (Best Actor).\n\nFrench Connection II (1975) — Nominated for British Academy Award (Best Actor) and Golden Globe (Best Actor). Watch for his famous “baseball” monologue, one of the greatest pieces of acting in all of cinema.\n\nYoung Frankenstein (1974) — an hillarious cameo shows his great range.\n\nZandy’s Bride (1974).\n\n*Conversation, The (1974) — one of Hackman’s best performances in Francis Ford Coppola’s finest film. Winner: Best Actor, National Board of Review. Nominated: British Academy Award (Best Actor); Golden Globe (Best Actor).\n\nScarecrow (1973) — Hackman has often called this film, in which he teamed with Al Pacino, one of his personal favorites. Finally released on DVD in 2005.\n\nCisco Pike (1972).\n\nPoseidon Adventure, The (1972) — Winner, British Academy Award (Best Actor) — the film that launched a thousand disaster movies, this remains one of the genre’s best.\n\nPrime Cut (1972).\n\nFrench Connection, The (1971) — The film that won Hackman his first Oscar and made him a star. Also won him the British Academy Award (Best Actor); Golden Globe (Best Actor); National Board of Review (Best Actor); and New York Film Critics Circle Award (Best Actor).\n\nDoctors’ Wives (1971).\n\nI Never Sang for My Father (1970) — Hackman was nominated for an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor) in this drama about a man trying to reconcile with his elderly father. There are parallels between actor and character: both are named Gene; both are ex-Marines; but more significantly, both have strained relationships with their fathers. Hackman has only occasionally spoken of this complex relationship (his father left the family when Gene was only 13), and watching with this knowledge makes Hackman’s nuanced performance even more poignant.\n\nDownhill Racer (1969).\n\nGypsy Moths, The (1969) — This early Hackman film about skydiving — directed by John Frankenheimer at the height of his success — features excellent aerial footage and an intelligent script.\n\nMarooned (1969).\n\nRiot (1969).\n\nSplit, The (1968).\n\nShadow on the Land (1968) (TV).\n\nBanning (1967).\n\nBonnie and Clyde (1967) — A breakthrough performance which brought him wide acclaim and jumpstarted his film career. He received his first Academy Award nomination (for Best Supporting Actor) and won the National Society of Film Critics Award.\n\nHawaii (1966).\n\nLilith (1964) — This film introduced him to Warren Beatty, who would later cast him in a seminal role in Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nRide with Terror (1963) (TV).\n\nMad Dog Coll (1961) (uncredited).\n\nTelevision Work (selected):\n\nAcclaimed shows like “The Defenders” gave Hackman valuable early experience and paved the way for film roles. Today, his television work is generally limited to narration and voiceovers (until recently he was heard in commercials for Lowe’s home improvement stores and Oppenheimer mutual funds).\n\nI Spy in episode “Happy Birthday… Everybody” (originally aired 2/26/68).\n\nIron Horse in episode “Leopards Try” (10/28/67).\n\nThe Invaders in episode “The Spores” (10/17/67).\n\nThe F.B.I. in episode “The Courier” (1/15/67).\n\nHawk in episode “Do Not Mutilate or Spindle” (9/8/66).\n\nThe Trials of O’Brien in episode “The Only Game In Town” (3/18/66).\n\nThe Defenders in episodes “Judgment Eve” (4/17/63); and “Quality of Mercy” (9/13/61).\n\nNaked City in episode “Prime of Life” (2/13/63).\n\nThe United States Steel Hour in episodes “Far from the Shade Tree” (1/10/62); “Brandenburg Gate” (10/4/61); “Bride of the Fox” (8/24/60); “Big Doc’s Girl” (11/4/59); and “Little Tin God” (4/22/59).\n\nTheater Work (late 1950s-early 1960s):\n\nLike many young actors, Hackman initially considered himself a theater actor who would go slumming in film and television (“stealing money,” as he put it). He appeared in numerous summer stock, regional, and improvisational theater productions, a few of which appear below (in reverse chronological order):\n\nPoor Richard — Moving up in the theater world, Hackman shared above-the-title billing with Robert Preston in this Jean Kerr play.\n\nThe Natural Look — co-starred with Brenda Vaccaro. Closed after one night, but was seen by film producer Walter Mirisch, who gave Hackman a small role in the big-budget Hawaii.\n\nAny Wednesday — Muriel Resnik’s farce was Hackman’s meatiest role to date and a significant stepping stone in his career.\n\nA Rainy Day in Newark — by Howard Teichman.\n\nChildren From Their Games — Irwin Shaw’s Broadway play ran just one performance, but Hackman won the Clarence Derwent Award for his work. The single performance was also seen by film director Robert Rossen, who cast Hackman in Lilith.\n\nBarefoot in the Park — a supporting role in the original Broadway production of the Neil Simon hit, this was an important early break and helped Hackman hone his comedic skills. Robert Redford played the lead.\n\nChapparal — an off-Broadway play by Valgrem Massey.\n\nSaintliness of Margery Kempe — another off-Broadway production, by John Wulp.\n\nThe Curious Miss Caraway — appeared with silent film star Zasu Pitts in his stage debut at the Pasadena Playhouse (where he briefly studied).\n\nWebography\n\nThere seem to be few websites dedicated solely to Gene Hackman. Most of the links below are general film sites with a page or two about the actor.\n\nCigar Aficionado Interview — Well-written profile from 2000. One of the best short bios of Hackman you’ll find.\n\nDigitalHit.com: Gene Hackman — Brief bio.\n\nGene Hackman Connection — Extensive multimedia content, perhaps more than any other Hackman site.\n\nGene Hackman Experience — Comprehensive fan site featuring screen grabs, sounds, bio, and more.\n\nLarry King Live Interview — Transcript of an interview on July 7, 2004.\n\nNightMare’s Gene Hackman Page — Bio, message board.\n\nThespian Net: Gene Hackman — Links and many photos.\n\nBorn in San Bernadino, California in 1930, Gene Hackman moved to Danville as a young boy. At 16 he enlisted in the Marines for a four year hitch. He returned to Danville briefly after military service, working as a TV cameraman at WDAN, but soon left to pursue acting in California, and later, New York. He still has family and friends in the Danville area and occasionally visits.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
