        "text": "As ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews (&cet.)\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Terminator (1984) Asked where the plot for this accomplished and highly entertaining fantasy thriller came from, its writer and director James Cameron blithely replied, “Oh, I ripped off a couple of Harlan Ellison stories.” Unfortunately for him, and for Orion, which financed the picture, the person to whom Cameron said this was Tracy Tormé, son of Mel and a friend of Ellison’s; already suspicious that The Terminator, which he admitted to loving, too closely resembled his short story “Soldier from Tomorrow” and his own adaptation of it as “Soldier” for a 1964 episode of “The Outer Limits,” Ellison sued. The result, aside from an undisclosed out-of-court financial settlement, was screen credit, although even that was handled in a grudging manner, during the final credits, appearing on the screen while most of the audience was standing up and turning toward the theater aisle. (Generally speaking, it’s only nuts like me who stay to the last credit, to the annoyance of theater employees attempting to clean up the auditorium.) Cameron reminds me of Mark Twain’s observation about the burglar who “isn’t the least sorry he stole but is terribly sorry he got caught,” and I mention all of this because its says something fundamental about the man.* He could have gone directly to Ellison, or even to the “Outer Limits” rights-holders, and made a deal for the story, but was instead content to plagiarize the work of one of his betters, smugly believing no one would notice and that even if he admitted to the theft outright he’d get away with it. Cut to Harlan Ellison chomping a carrot and saying, “Ehhh… he don’t know me vewwy well, do he?”\n\nThe Music Man (1962) The wonderful Meredith Willson musical, given a fulsome representation by the Bros. Warner which among other things preserves Robert Preston’s star-making Broadway performance.\n\nBabes in Toyland (1934) If Hal Roach had to keep putting Laurel and Hardy into filmed versions of old operettas, the very least he might have done was to make them all as charming and funny as this one. Frank Butler and Nick Grinde’s amusing screenplay places the boys (as Ollie Dee and Stannie Dum) as incompetent assistants to the Toymaker (William Burress) scheming to stop the nasty miser Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon) from evicting their landlady, the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, aka the Widow Peep (Florence Roberts), streamlines the Victor Herbert/Glen MacDonough score so we don’t have to sit through a lot of fustian vocalization and throws in a mob of nightmarish creatures called the Bogeymen to serve as Barnaby’s creepy hench-things. Rather amazingly, Roach and MGM got permission from Walt Disney to include not merely the song “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” and Three Pigs who resemble the trio in his 1933 cartoon but even Mickey Mouse, seen as a well-animated puppet with a strangely fat, monkeyish (or perhaps rat-like?) tail.\n\nPossibly because they don’t sing as much as they might have, Charlotte Henry and Felix Knight make an engaging Bo-Peep and Tom-Tom, Brandon (billed as Henry Kleinbach, and only 22!) overacting outrageously is a perfectly hissable villain, Burress an understandably irritated Toymaker, and if your eyes are sharp you may catch Ellen Corby and Charlie Hall as townspeople, Tiny Sandford as the Dunker who administers Ollie’s punishment (Stan, of course, with his usual luck, is spared his) and Dickie Jones and the young Gene Reynolds among Toyland’s children. Hardy often said, with characteristic modesty and without the slightest trace of self-pity, that he was merely second-banana to one of the greatest comedians in the world and while those of us who love this team disagree vociferously with Ollie’s self-assessment it’s certainly true that Stan usually gets the most memorable gags and set-pieces such as, here, Stannie Dum’s demonstration of his prowess with the game of “Pee Wee,” which Ollie Dee attempts to best, with entirely predictable results.\n\nThe picture was reissued in the 1950s as March of the Wooden Soldiers, and Walt Disney made his own version in 1961 with Gene Sheldon and Henry Calvin, immortal to us lovers of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” as Ollie in a sketch with Van Dyke, as Laurel and Hardy-type characters.\n\nAmarcord (1973) Federico Fellini’s bittersweet reminiscence of his 1930s adolescence in the Adriatic seaside town of Rimini. Funny, sad and filled with wonders.\n\nNever Cry Wolf (1983) If you have not read Farley Mowat’s 1963 memoir you may enjoy this Disney live-action adaptation of it. Being a Mowat admirer, I found it beautiful but dismayingly inexplicable. It took three credited screenwriters (Curtis Hanson, Sam Hamm and Richard Kletter), one uncredited one (Ralph Furmaniak) and an additional trio (Eugene Corr and Christina Luescher and the star, Charles Martin Smith, under an alias) to botch Mowat’s (allegedly fictionalized) account of his study of Alaskan wolves and to, instead of using the author’s voice, thoroughly obliterate it. What’s left is some remarkable cinematography by Hiro Narita, often lovely direction by Carroll Ballard, a likeable performance by Smith, and a horrible lot of hokum, served up with relish. This includes Brian Dennehy’s role as a reckless pilot who later shows up as a newly-minted entrepreneur bent on destroying the Alaskan wilderness as he exploits it (the pilot of the book does no such thing, nor is he the genial sadist of the movie), a reversal of the ages of the two Inuits who befriend Mowat, and the inescapable implication at the end that the younger has betrayed the adult wolves for profit and orphaned the cubs, a portrayal which ought to have been actionable. When the picture sticks to the events Mowat described it’s good entertainment; when it doesn’t, the movie stinks. The irretrievable wrong-headedness of the thing is made manifest in the scene in which Smith grabs up a piece of the caribou the pack is eating to prove to himself that the animal had bone disease and the wolves, instead of tearing out his throat, passively back away from the carcass. Pull the other one, Ballard.\n\nThe Aristocats (1970) The enjoyable but anachronistic (and linguistically schizophrenic) Disney animated feature.\n\nSwiss Miss (1938) An extremely silly demi-musical featuring (alas, not starring) Laurel and Hardy and redeemed solely by them and, by their encounters with a gorilla. In the Swiss Alps. Which makes as much sense as anything else in this idiot musical in which Walter Wolf King, who three years earlier beat Harpo Marx and got made to look ridiculous during a performance of Il Trovatore, is a composer of, on the evidence of the movie, bad operettas who sequesters himself in the mountains to write his magnum opus. (Some of the nastiness of that previous performance seems to cling to him here, or perhaps he was simply, like Kevin Spacey, unpleasant in any role.) Della Lind simpers broadly as his soprano-star wife, while Eric Blore is utterly wasted as King’s manager, behaving more like a cowering manservant. Stan and Ollie are mousetrap salesmen stranded in the Alps, Adia Kuznetzoff is the mean chef who enslaves them, and the diminutive make-up man Charles Gemora is the gorilla, whose final act of vengeance against the boys absolutely killed me. It seems to have been inspired by the climax of the team’s second talkie short, the 1929 Berth Marks but, perhaps because the gag in Swiss Miss was filmed at greater distance, and with a longer or wider lens, it’s correspondingly that much funnier.\n\nStan was allegedly exasperated with Hal Roach’s editorial meddling, and Roach cut sequences willy-nilly, as when a musical number with Stan and Ollie involving mousetraps is cut off before it can even begin. There were some otherwise good writers on this one, so I won’t embarrass their shades by mentioning their names. In the funny sequence in which Stan attempts to rook a vigilant St. Bernard dog out of his flask of brandy, by the way, Stan’s belly puts paid to the idea that Stan Laurel was “the skinny one.” As Penn Jillette has pointed out, Laurel is only thin in contrast to Hardy.\n\nMacbeth (1948) Made as a personal challenge at the Poverty Row Republic Pictures studio for under $1 million and in only 24 days, Orson Welles‘ second major tilt at “The Scottish Play” after the so-called “Voodoo Macbeth” in Harlem is one of the great Shakespeare movies, especially in its restored edition which returns his actors’ Scots burrs, re-dubbed by the filmmaker at the insistence of Republic.\n\nArabesque (1966) An entertaining trifle wrestled to the ground and pinned repeatedly by a self-indulgent Stanley Donen, who apparently felt his had to “save” the material with elaborate, arty camera tricks that do little but annoy the viewer. One of the era’s many knock-offs of Charade, itself directed by Donen, involving a pair of box-office idols in an elaborate comedy-mystery with violent overtones, Arabesque concerns international espionage involving Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren, the latter dripping with Yves Saint-Laurent in every scene. The occasionally witty script was written by Julian Mitchell, Stanley Price and the Charade screenwriter Peter Stone under his pseudonym Pierre Marton, which tells you he was not happy with what they ended up with, and while it doesn’t add up to much surely it didn’t require the sort of mad stylistic rococo Donen imposed on the material. Aside from the stars, who are relaxed and funny, the best things in Arabesque are Henry Mancini’s alternately tense and soignée musical score, the silkily creepy and vaguely psychopathic performance by Alan Badel as the villain and, when Donen allows him space to breathe and isn’t asking him to muck things up with fish-eye lenses and absurd camera angles, Christopher Challis’ lovely widescreen color cinematography.\n\nThe Gypsy Moths (1969) This beautifully-rendered adaptation by John Frankenheimer (direction) and the playwright William Hanley (screenplay) of James Drought’s exceptional short novel is one of the unheralded wonders of late-’60s American filmmaking.\n\nThe Bliss of Mrs. Blossom (1968) A silly, funny, eye-poppingly “mod” 1960s sex-farce with Shirley MacLaine at her most appealing, more or less happily married to the sexless brassiere manufacturer played by Richard Attenborough but keeping a younger lover (James Booth) in the attic for years. (Somewhat amazingly, the basic notion was based on a real case.) Adapted by Alec Coppel and Denis Norden from Coppel’s stage play, it’s a self-conscious piece of comedic pop-art that is almost consistently engaging, gorgeously shot by Geoffrey Unsworth and directed with wit by Joseph McGrath. Made in 1966, The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom sat on the shelf for two years, an indication of Paramount’s lack of faith in the project. That time-lapse probably cost the picture its audience; it’s very much of movie of 1966, almost a period-piece two years later. The critics were certainly divided on it: Time Out‘s notice contended that it was “coarse comedy which looks a little like Joe Orton gone disastrously wrong.” There’s something to that criticism. The picture does feel a bit like a less socially satirical imitation of Orton, especially in the inclusion of an effeminate (yet possibly heterosexual?) police detective played with wild abandon by Freddie Jones, and Bob Monkhouse’s psychoanalyst, who is possibly madder than his patients. The comedy also sags a bit toward the end. But most of it is engaging and, if not knock-down hilarious, gives the viewer a consistent smile of pleasure. Among its delights are the spritely score by Riz Ortolani, the vivid production design of Assheton Gorton, the cheerfully crazy costumes by Jocelyn Rickards, the wonderful paintings by Sally Scott and some droll supporting performances by, among others, William Rushton, Patricia Routledge, Barry Humphries and, in a sequence that almost seems a precursor to one of his Monty Python sketches, John Cleese as an uproariously uncertain post office clerk.\n\nThe novelty act The New Vaudeville Band appears in a party sequence, filmed a year before the group, astonishingly, copped the Best Contemporary Single Grammy for “Winchester Cathedral” over The Association’s “Cherish,” The Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations,” The Monkees’ “Last Train to Clarksville,” The Mamas & the Papas’ “Monday, Monday” and The Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby.”\n\nThe Baker’s Wife (La Femme du Boulanger; 1938) Another, very different, comedy about adultery, and one I wish I liked better than I do, especially considering its elaborate reputation. Written and directed by Marcel Pagnol from an episode in the Jean Giono novel Blue Boy and with dialogue by Pagnol and Giono, it’s a poetic-realist fable about the new baker in an isolated Provençal town whose young wife goes off with an amorous shepherd, causing him to cease caring about making bread. As with the work of Jean Renoir, Pagnol is concerned with the people in his pictures, and I’m afraid that may be why I have a difficult time responding positively or emotionally to either man’s movies, even as I admire them: I tend to regard their characters as types, or symbols, but in any case outside my ken. (Feudal Japan is more graspable to me than early 20th century France.) The people in these movies can be arresting or amusing but they don’t, somehow, feel entirely real as even the most outlandish characters in, say, a Lubitsch comedy do. I can’t explain that.\n\nThe cinematography by Georges Benoît is lovely, especially in the print on Criterion Blu-ray, and I liked the antagonistic dialogues between the pinch-faced, censorious priest (Robert Vattier) and his opposite, the Socialist schoolteacher (Robert Bassac); while both are rendered with a satirist’s eye, it will not surprise a reader of these pages when I confess to being much more in sympathy with the latter than the former. The most impressive element in The Baker’s Wife, however, is the central performance by Raimu as the baker Aimable, which is indeed everything I’ve been hearing about it for decades. It’s total acting, without being in the least actorly. Raimu is like a genial bear with a limp which everyone notices but him, shambling along more or less happily but who, when stung by a blow from a child’s peashooter, becomes unreasonably hurt by the action. Aimable doesn’t see what everyone around him does, that his marriage is almost entirely unsuccessful and that his wife has a roving eye, and when she leaves him he falls apart.\n\nAlthough it neither moved me to tears nor even, despite Leonard Maltin’s assurance that the picture is “hilarious,” much to laughter — I prefer the lovely score of Stephen Schwartz’s flop musical version of The Baker’s Wife to its source — the movie is filled with wonderful faces and physiques among the villagers: Charles Moulin, Charles Blavette, Marcel Maupi, Fernand Charpin, Odette Roger and Maximilienne, who gives a great comic performance as a hypocritical hatchet-faced spinster. Ginette Leclerc is Aurélie, the wayward wife, and while she hasn’t much to do in the picture she shares with Raimu a beautifully observed final scene in which he finally (if obliquely) expresses his anger at her and the pair quietly come to terms.\n\n*Nor do I exempt from Cameron’s sins one Gale Anne Hurd, his producer and then-girlfriend and co-author of the script.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews &cet.\n\nA Star is Born (1937) The first of (so far) four identically-titled variations on the theme of upward/downward pop stardom. The movie seems to get remade every 20 or 30 years, as popular tastes and styles and the modes of stardom change; I suppose the next edition will highlight internet “influencers.”\n\nI missed the Streisand-Kristofferson edition in 1976 and, having no interest in either Bradley Cooper or Lady Gaga, do not expect to see the most recent iteration, but I have seen the picture that predated and seems to have inspired A Star is Born, the 1932 George Cukor-directed What Price Hollywood? in which the doomed romance was between a young starlet (Constance Bennett) and an older, alcoholic director (Lowell Sherman). The most striking aspect of Cukor’s picture is the way, a moment before Sherman pulls the trigger on the gun with which he shoots himself, a remarkable series of flashing images fills the screen — the final, fleeting thoughts of a suicide. (It’s the sort of thing that ought to make the auteurists swoon.) There is nothing as interesting in the 1937 A Star is Born, although admirers of the 1954 Judy Garland musical remake will note that it follows the second half of the original extremely closely, with nearly identical sequences and dialogue, or anyway until James Mason’s swim out to sea and the assault on Garland by her fans at his funeral. The first half is more labored, and dated, not least in Janet Gaynor’s twinkling performance, her tight, marcelled look, the clichéd opening scenes and the ugly early Technicolor process in which the movie was photographed, which likewise contributed to the artistic failure, also in 1937, of Nothing Sacred, like Star is Born directed by William A. Wellman, produced by David O. Selznick and starring Fredric March.\n\nMarch, one of America’s most interesting actors (if, like Robert Ryan, never quite the popular star he should have been) grounds the role of Norman Maine so thoroughly that his decline, which can seem like a scenarist’s contrivance, becomes devastating; the haunted look he expresses as he embraces Gaynor a final time, is among the most breathtaking human images in American movies. Wellman, who worked on the story with Robert Carson, directed intelligently and with surprising sensitivity, especially in the camper honeymoon scene between March and Gaynor. The screenplay, credited to Carson, Dorothy Parker and Parker’s husband Alan Campbell, gets better as it goes along, although, as with the character in 1954, I don’t buy the studio head Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) as a gentle, kindly old thing — just try to imagine Samuel Goldwyn or Harry Cohn, purring the way Menjou does. Worse, however, is Lionel Stander’s miscasting as the production chief Matt Libby. In the Garland-Mason version, Jack Carson as Libby expressed as much charm as nastiness, and his readings had an almost Cowardian sophistication; Stander barks and growls like a New Jersey dockworker who has unaccountably found himself employed behind the notions counter at Harrod’s. Aside from March, the best acting is done by May Robson in the impossible role of Gaynor’s no-nonsense grandmother Lettie. Andy Devine, of all people, plays Gaynor’s Hollywood confidante while Peggy Wood, Guinn “Big Boy” Williams, Francis Ford, Edgar Kennedy and Clara Blandick, later immortal as Dorothy Gale’s Auntie Em, have small but telling roles. Kenneth Howell, appearing as an injured teenage drunk in the courtroom sequence, looks heartbreakingly young to have smashed up his life so badly, and is movingly grateful for the suspended sentence the judge (Jonathan Hale) bestows on him.\n\nHatari! (1962) An overlong but extravagantly entertaining collaboration between John Wayne, Howard Hawks and the scenarist Leigh Brackett about a team of hunters in Africa. The kicker is that they are not shooting the animals but capturing them for zoos, which must have seemed refreshing in 1962, although it’s less reassuring today, when increasing numbers of people see zoos as little more than prisons for exotic beasts, maintained for the public’s dubious (and frankly, repulsive) benefit. We wouldn’t put a human being behind bars for our own edification, so why should a rhinoceros be any different? The means by which Wayne’s team traps the creatures are also antiquated: Running the animals to exhaustion in all-terrain vehicles. (They use tranquilizers now.) Yet the chase sequences, thrillingly filmed by Russell Harlan and kinetically edited by Stuart Gilmore, are among the most exciting Hawks ever directed, with the actors clearly doing the work and putting themselves in danger while doing so. (Although Wayne was reportedly, and quite understandably, terrified sitting in that external seat with nothing to protect him from danger but a seatbelt, he doesn’t show it.) In typical Hawksian manner, into this largely male enclave comes an attractive outsider (Elsa Martinelli) while two of the team (Hardy Krüger and Gérard Blain) battle each other for the affections of a girl (Michèle Girardon) who isn’t interested in either of them. The Girardon subplot is mildly diverting but Martinelli is so obviously out of her element (whatever that might have been) that she becomes a beautiful embarrassment; her character is meant to be appealing but you cringe every time she goes on one of her irrational crying jags. By the end of it, arrived at via an unfunny chase sequence, you long for Wayne to kick her in the seat of her pants, or at least send her back to Italy. Instead, he marries her. Go figure.\n\nHenry Mancini composed a lively score, with a sinuous, percussion-driven main theme and some charming interludes including the famous “Baby Elephant Walk.” Sometime around 1965 I heard Mancini’s infectious recording on the radio and it so delighted me I began walking around hunched over with my arms in front of my face for a trunk and the tips of my fingers brushing the floor, moving joyously in time to the music. I can’t touch the floor that way today, but the piece still makes me smile.\n\nThe Killer Elite (1975) A standard ’70s thriller from Sam Peckinpah’s late, booze-and-coke period, elevated by its cast and their director’s self-identification with the material. The script by Marc Norman and Stirling Silliphant follows the basic contours of its source, the pseudonymous novel Monkey in the Middle, in which the espionage agent Mike Locken is not killed but deliberately wounded by an assassin, accepts a new assignment during his physical rehabilitation to smoke out the killer and gradually comes to realize he’s being played by his duplicitous superior. In the book, the figure Locken is assigned to protect and to spirit out of England is a charismatic African leader hopeful of taking advantage of unrest in his (fictional) nation to bring about a democratic change. In the movie it’s a Chinese dissident, although we’re never really sure where he comes from, where he’s hoping to go, what he expects to do or even what he represents to the people of his country. This is seen by Peckinpah’s critics as a sign of his contempt for the material he’s been offered and there may be some truth to that. To Pauline Kael (“Notes on the Nihilist Poetry of Sam Peckinpah,” The New Yorker, 4 January 1976) the attraction to the script for the filmmaker was his identification with the professional at its center, whored out by pimps (i.e., United Artists and Mike Medavoy, who got him the job as a favor) with whom he had to battle, eternally engaging in subterfuge and sly satire of the creeps to whom he owed his livelihood. I suspect that’s closer to the mark, especially considering the paranoia cocaine engenders in its users. Someone — and I have no idea whether it was Norman, Silliphant or Peckinpah — made the wounding assassin Locken’s best friend and colleague, upping the personal ante, and switched the locale to San Francisco and the African leader to a Chinese national. It was Silliphant, however, who insisted his wife Tiana Alexandra be cast as the man’s daughter, and she’s so bad in the picture, and was from what one hears aggressively unpleasant to boot, that her role was reduced in scope and made to look ridiculous, as when she informs James Caan’s Locken, unbidden, that she’s a virgin and is promptly told by him that he doesn’t give a shit.\n\nGiven these conditions, and limitations, and Peckinpah’s coke addiction, the wonder is that The Killer Elite is so entertaining. (Watching the picture a second time with the commentary track on, the Brahman snottiness of Paul Seydor, who makes his own contempt for it quite clear from the beginning, made me like the thing even more.)* The picture sometimes looks cheap — considering his filmography, the budget for this one was shockingly low — and is, overall, less violent and bloody than might be expected. (The sequence in which Caan’s wounds are operated on is the most disturbing in the movie.) Yet there are moments in it that resonate, especially the imposing setting for the climax: The U.S. Navy “mothball fleet” off Suisun Bay. Those huge, empty battleships, slowly rotting in the California sun, provide such a ghostly, unnerving backdrop I’m surprised the government permitted Peckinpaw to film there. There is beautifully lucid cinematography by Philip Lathrop and splendid performances by Caan, Robert Duvall as his betrayer, Arthur Hill as their commander, Gig Young as his superior, Mako as the enigmatic Chinese and Bo Hopkins as Locken’s chief gunman. Burt Young gives a Burt Young performance as Locken’s driver, complete with unintentional mispronunciations, and as Caan’s love-interest Kate Heflin has, alas, the same physiognomy as her father Van. The typically dark Jerry Fielding score is one of his finest of the period.\n\nSons of the Desert (1934) With Way Out West one of Laurel and Hardy’s two best features. The boys want to travel to their lodge’s convention in Chicago, Ollie’s wife won’t let him go, the pair pretend they’re sailing to Honolulu on a rest-cure cruise for Ollie and, once they get back, are horrified to discover that the ship they are supposed to be on has sunk at sea. At an hour and 4 minutes it’s among the most tightly-packed of sound comedies and the comic sequences are beautifully worked-out. (The credited screenwriter was Frank Craven, later the originator of the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, and the uncredited scenarists included Stan Laurel, Charley Chase, Glenn Tryon, Hal Roach and the director, William A. Seiter.) Chase has a great role as an obnoxious conventioneer, Mae Busch is exceptionally funny as Ollie’s formidable wife, Dorothy Christy is both handsome and commanding as Stan’s gun-toting spouse and the sharp of eye can spot Ellen Corby in the Chicago nightclub to which the boys retire and the young Robert Cummings in the steamship office. The print on the recent Laurel & Hardy: The Definitive Restorations Blu-ray is a revelation, making Kenneth Peach’s sharp black-and-white images fairly shimmer.\n\nSons of the Desert, by the way, later became the name of the International Laurel & Hardy Society, founded by the team’s first important biographer, John McCabe, in 1965. Al Kilgore devised the official escutcheon and Stan himself suggested the motto which translated from the Latin is, appropriately, “Two minds without a single thought.”\n\nDownhill Racer (1969) A curious mix of (then) new-style filmmaking and old-fashioned dramaturgy. Brian Probyn’s widescreen cinematography is, in the skiing sequences, astounding, and must have been a knockout on a big theater screen; the camera gives the viewer so close a view of the experience of racing you feel as if you have become the athlete. I don’t know how this was managed, particularly since Downhill Racer predates by years the development of the Steadicam, but I assume that, somehow, the movie camera was attached to either skis or skier. You may feel, at the end of each sequence, as if you have stopped breathing until the concluding seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this technical virtuosity is wedded to a screenplay by the novelist James Salter (A Sport and a Pastime) that wallows in cliché, fitfully camouflaged with trendy sex, his specialty. Chappellet, the cold, ambitious athlete at its center (the ambitious are always cold in American movies) is a cipher, the worldly European (Camilla Sparv) with whom he has a seemingly passionate affair is a fraud, his coach (Gene Hackman) could have been played by Pat O’Brien in the 1940s and there is little reason, aside from the movie’s undeniable visual excitement, to care whether Chappellet wins his Olympic race or not. The skier, played with a combination of intensity and cool by Robert Redford, regards his fellow Olympic team members as impediments to his own achievement, and even discovering that he came by his taciturn nature honestly — that his farmer father (Walter Stroud) is as closed off and uncommunicative as his son — does little to make us care about the skier. Considering the parade of platitudes he was given to recite, Hackman makes the coach a vivid presence, and the other skiers include Kenneth Kirk, Jerry Deexter and the young Dabney Coleman. Kenyon Hopkins, who did splendid work as the composer for 12 Angry Men, The Hustler and, especially, The Fugitive Kind, wrote a score of crashing badness for Downhill Racer, one that over-emphasizes every action and reaches crescendos of barely-contained hysteria just before the picture’s several skiing accidents. It’s almost shockingly poor music to have come from so gifted a source and one wonders whether the director, Michael Ritchie, trying to salvage his dramatically inert movie, insisted on it.\n\nThe Love Parade (1929) One of the very few early talkie musicals that not only still holds up but gives you a real sense of how much the musical could accomplish in the hands of people who knew what they were doing. Maurice Chevalier plays a Graustarkian Count assigned to a diplomatic post in Paris who (we are told) has succumbed so thoroughly to the the charms of the City of Light he’s lost his original accent and gained a thick French one. When he’s recalled to his country as a result of his scandalous behavior, the Queen (Jeanette MacDonald), whose lack of a husband is the primary concern of the entire nation, falls for him. At this point, the logical next step for the people who wrote these sorts of things would have been to have placed impediments between the two that prevented their union. Here they marry, and only then do their problems begin.\n\nThis sort of nonsense requires enormous charm from the performers and a corresponding level of wit from the creators to keep you engaged instead of asking niggling logical questions that take your attention away from the people on the screen. The Love Parade had what was needed in all departments: From Maurice Chevalier as the Count, from Guy Bolton’s script, from the Victor Schertzinger-Clifford Grey song score and, especially, from Ernst Lubitsch’s direction. (Even Jeanette MacDonald, by whose looks I am slightly repelled and towards whose Melpomenic extravagances I am at best lukewarm, is rather engaging.) Bolton was an old hand at such things; with P.G. Wodehouse and Jerome Kern he had originated the small, “modern” Broadway musical in the Princess Theatre shows of the 1920s, which eschewed the operetta style, replacing its big choral elements with more intimate numbers and developed in colloquialism an alternative to the fustian pomposity of the Victor Herbert and Rudolph Friml school. The Love Parade doesn’t take itself seriously for a moment; it has the witty irrelevancy of a Wodehouse fable, and this extends to the often blissfully silly songs, such as when Chevalier sings “Paris, Stay the Same” and is toasted by the many soignée women with whom he’s been involved. Not only does his valet (Lupino Lane) take up the refrain, echoed by the chambermaids with whom he has been dallying, the valet’s French bulldog and his grieving bitches also join in.\n\nIf I have a complaint about the picture it’s due to Lane’s broad, extravagantly loose-limbed style of performance, so beloved of West End theatregoers of the time. I was equally annoyed 35 years ago by the reproduction of that style in the revival of his inexplicably popular musical Me and My Girl whose idiotic book, stunningly to me, Stephen Fry was credited with revising. Lane on screen almost makes me pine for El Brendel; fortunately, he’s paired with the charming Lillian Roth. While the songs are, overall, not as catchy as the numbers Rodgers & Hart wrote three years later for Love Me Tonight, Schertzinger and Grey came up with a charming title song and, in “Dream Lover,” a standard that recurs in orchestral versions in seemingly dozens of later Paramount pictures including Billy Wilder’s American debut as a writer-director, The Major and the Minor. Grey’s lyrics, like Bolton’s dialogue, are dazzlingly brazen sexually, achieving with strong innuendo what rappers would one day spell out explicitly. (Guess whose lyrics are more enchanting?) “Nobody’s Using It Now” could have been written by Cole Porter at his most erotically playful — it reminds me a bit of both “Nobody’s Chasing Me” and “I Sleep Easier Now” from Porter’s later Out of This World — and “My Love Parade” is nearly as intoxicating as the Rodgers & Hart “Lover.” Although The Love Parade was only his third talkie, Lubtisch brought such assurance to the picture you’d think he’d been making musical comedies for years. It contains the qualities we most associate with him: The deliciously louche attitude toward sex, the sunniness of outlook and the astonishingly adult intelligence of the material. This may have been the picture that caused Lubitsch to remark that he’d been to Paris, France and to Paris, Paramount and preferred the latter.\n\nThief (1981) Michael Mann’s striking debut as a writer-director has the cool, dark, blue-accented cinematography we associate with pictures like Manhunter and Heat, although Mann only worked with the cinematographer Donald E. Thorin this once. James Caan, is the titular figure, and he gives an intense, perfectly-scaled performance of a man who because of his background is incapable of surrendering his independence, an inflexible philosophy that virtually ensures the loss of everything he values. Caan’s Frank (no last name is ever given) is frighteningly, if explicably, mercurial, and at the climax he destroys the entire edifice he has painstakingly built from a prison fantasy of what constitutes a successful life. Thief is rigorously logical, and intelligent. It’s also beautifully cast, with Tuesday Weld as Frank’s tremulous yet forceful wife, Willie Nelson in the small but affecting role of Frank’s prison mentor, Jim (billed as James) Belushi as his closest cohort and, in a quietly terrifying performance, Robert Prosky as the mob boss who slowly insinuates himself into Frank’s life, with cataclysmic results. The movie is impressively shot and put together, and when you see something like the gaudy lights of mercantile Chicago reflected off the hood of Frank’s shiny luxury model car as he makes a fateful night drive the image achieves a kind of metallic poetry and metaphorical potency denied to what my friend Eliot M. Camarena refers to as the “Look-a-me!” gyrations of a Martin Scorsese.\n\nPack Up Your Troubles (1932) This cleverly conceived Laurel and Hardy feature, written by the old L & H hand H. M. Walker and competently directed by George Marshall and Raymond McCarey (Leo’s brother) is sometimes charming but ultimately a little too sentimental for its own good. It trades on Chaplinesque emotion (specifically from The Kid) and even, in its First World War trench sequence, a bit on Chaplin’s social realism (Shoulder Arms) and you nay wish it was a great deal funnier than it is. There are, however, compensations, as there nearly always are with Stan and Ollie, especially during a sequence in which the pair manage, innocently, to utterly demolish a wedding. While she’s no Jackie Coogan, little Jacquie Lyn is remarkably ingenuous as the orphaned daughter of a dead soldier and the good supporting cast includes Don Dillaway, Mary Carr, James Finlayson, Grady Sutton, C. Montague Shaw, Billy Gilbert, Adele Watson and, in an unsettling scene, Richard Cramer as a wife-beating thug. As usual, Stan did uncredited work on the script, and (also as usual) I presume the more gruesome gags in the picture were his.\n\nAmerican Masters — Mike Nichols (2016) Whenever I see the photo, above, of Nichols as a child with his mother in Germany I am struck by the pensiveness of his expression. Is the future director judging the family sedan critically, with an eye to how he might make it perform better? Whatever else may be said of Nichols’ work, in movies and in the theatre, it was and is seldom less than intelligent; you can no more imagine him directing a slobby, panting sex comedy like Porky’s than you can picture Stephen Sondheim composing “You Light Up My Life,” except perhaps as a parody.† Rediscovering as an adult my early appreciation for Mike Nichols’ often extraordinary achievements caused me to realize that, along with a goodly amount of the usual dross children and the young embrace and which embarrasses them to confront in their later maturity, there was much I rightly appreciated from a young age. Unfortunately, I had then allowed others — usually but not always, critics — to turn me from my early enthusiasms, or in any case to find them suspect. I number among those pleasures, happily regained in adulthood, the work of Billy Wilder, Blake Edwards, William Goldman, Bob Fosse, Peter Bogdanovich and Alfred Hitchcock, the early enthusiasm for which my reading of (among others) Pauline Kael, John Simon, Dwight MacDonald and the forenamed Mr. Goldman, had dampened. (Although they were correct about his ponderous later work.) In the middle of Goldman’s seminal 1968 book The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway lies a withering chapter on Nichols’ alleged facile slickness, which I blush to admit caused me, at 16, to look at movies I had previously venerated (The Graduate, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) with a jaundiced eye. In his splendid biography of Nichols, Mark Harris suggests it might take an entire book to try getting at what Goldman was so outraged about. Was Nichols’ then nearly unbroken string of successes what really chapped Goldman’s ass?\n\nIf William Goldman expected Mike Nichols’ piper to be paid eventually, he soon got his wish: The expensive, ill-advised 1970 movie of Catch-22 ended one of the longest winning-streaks in American popular culture, from the early success of Nichols’ partnership with Elaine May to his direction of a string of Neil Simon’s theatrical hits (Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Plaza Suite) to the movies that cemented his status as a seemingly unstoppable wunderkind. (Frankly, if there was a facile artist at work here, it was more often Simon than Nichols.) Carnal Knowledge, with Jules Feiffer, was a modest hit, but The Day of the Dolphin and The Fortune bombed, and Nichols returned to the theatre, where he remained for years. We don’t have his theatre work to study, of course, as we do his movies, but despite what his critics saw as shallow facility (shades of the fraternity’s collective attitude towards Fosse… and William Goldman) what Nichols was really up to, and what he understood better than nearly anyone, was human behavior. It’s at the core of his and May’s often wildly funny improvisations; no matter how hard they make us laugh, their routines first cause us to us recognize their characters’ sharply-delineated humanity. That’s what made them so damned funny. When, during a sketch at the 1959 Emmy awards May presented Nichols (as one Lyle Glutz) with a trophy for being “the most total mediocrity in the industry” and his character exulted, “This is the proudest moment of my life!” you just knew that it was.\n\nMay includes that moment in the “American Masters” portrait of Nichols, which she put together, and it’s one of the few performance clips in the show. Whatever its lofty intentions, the series has an unfortunate tendency. not just to hagiography (and in that Mike Nichols is no exception) but to formula: Here is the artist, and we will now present countless talking-heads to praise him. Instead, May’s “American Masters” segment relies largely on video footage from a Julien Schlossberg interview with Nichols to tell his story — or rather, to let Nichols tells Nichols’ story. There are few pleasures in contemporary life as complete as watching a Mike Nichols interview, and hearing him reminisce about his life, his aimless (or anyway, formless) early experience with the Compass Players (later the Second City), the years with May and what he thought he was doing in the theatre and in movies, as opposed to what commentators believed he was up to, is as satisfying a way to spend an hour as any divertissements I have enjoyed in years. May’s brief snippets of other interviews add little to our understanding of Nichols, and two of them put me in a minor rage; the only thing more maddening than having to listen to that part-time actor (and, apparently, full-time CIA asset) Tom Hanks blather on about Charlie Wilson, who as much as anyone aside from Zbigniew Brzeziński was responsible for the ongoing disaster of American involvement in the Middle East,‡ is hearing Hanks’ pal Spielberg talk about his teenage auteurism, as if he were the only young person in history to have made an 8-millimeter home movie. Fortunately, there are few such lapses, and they are brief. May honors her old compatriot, one-time lover and lifelong friend in a way I suspect he would have appreciated, or at least not been too embarrassed about.\n\nBrief Encounter (1945) There are few popular movies as thoroughly worked-out as this Noël Coward-David Lean collaboration about a pair of married strangers who meet by chance in a railway refreshment room, fall in love, flirt with a physical dalliance and part in an agonizingly ironic manner. Yet despite its schematic nature, and some embarrassingly over-cooked dialogue, particularly for Trevor Howard as the masculine partner in the love-affair, the picture has a strangely compelling integrity. You care, not only for the guilt-ridden lovers but for the lives they have built with others and which neither is sanguine about upsetting and the end, when it comes, is almost unbearably moving.\n\nLean, whose directorial career at this point in the 1940s was entirely yoked to Coward’s writing (In Which We Serve, This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit preceded Brief Encounter) directed as if the script had no theatrical origin. Coward — in association with Lean, Anthony Havelock-Allan and Ronald Neame — adapted it from the one-act Still Life, one of the nine playlets making up his three-part omnibus Tonight at 8:30 in which he’d starred with Gertrude Lawrence, but his director seldom sees a proscenium arch. Only at the climax, when he plays with lighting effects to heighten the anguish Johnson is going through does he betray any overt sense of theatre, and he immediately upends this, almost literally, by tilting the camera to suggest the emotional upheaval the character is going through as she stands unsteadily and hurtles herself at the refreshment room door. Brief Encounter is a picture that, while staged on fabricated sets, feels unbound by conventional settings (much of it was filmed at the Carnforth railway station in Lancashire). It is also unconcerned with prevailing modes of beauty: although Johnson is an attractive woman neither she nor Howard can be said to be a glamour-puss, and when her character is overtaken by a suicidal urge, Lean films her in the aftermath in the most unflattering manner imaginable, her hair flying over her face and forehead, giving the figure a look of utter despair that matches what she is feeling, and what the actress is expressing, at that moment.\n\nJohnson, who in her private journals expressed strong reservations both about the script and her own performance, has exceptional poise and nothing she does strikes the wrong note. In a way her character represents a comforting, repressed portrait of married middle-class British respectability; Laura Jesson is the sort of person I doubt Coward associated with past his adolescence but which he felt compelled, I suppose, to uphold, since her type doubtless represented more than half his core theatrical audience. What’s admirable about her is her resilience, which has strength but not rigidity. She feels guilt over her attraction to Howard’s Alec Harvey, and she only ever permits her feelings to take her so far and no further… but even here I’m not being entirely fair to her, since she would succumb to Alec’s gentle blandishments but for an unfortunate event of mistiming. There is much we project onto Johnson, especially in the beautifully staged sequence on the train where she gazes from her window at the passing scenery and fantasizes a life with Alec. Except for her smile of pleasure toward the end she could be thinking of almost anything and the scene would work. (She, and Trevor Howard, are also blessedly mature, then as now most often an impediment to a financially successful romance.)\n\nHoward is equally impressive, although he has occasionally to struggle with some of the script’s most purple dialogue. (Although billed as “Noël Coward’s Brief Encounter,” there is no screenplay credit in the main titles, and it’s notable that Lean, Havelock-Allan and Neame, not Coward, shared the Academy Award nomination the picture received for its script.) Lean and others later claimed Howard was one of the stupidest men they’d ever known, which I admit shocked me a little as I had always thought he projected rare intelligence. In later years Lean wished he’d cut the scenes between the refreshment room proprietor played by Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway’s ticket inspector but they give the story a needed levity, providing sharp contrast as well to the clandestine lovers. Robert Krasker’s cinematography is among the best war-time jobs on either side of the Atlantic, crisp yet expansive, and although the use of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 feels a bit overdone, especially now that his sort of heavy romanticism has largely faded from popular consciousness. Still, its yearning qualities are nicely expressed by the pianist Eileen Joyce.\n\nCharley and the Angel (1973) I was taken to see this comic Disney fantasy almost exactly 51 years ago and enjoyed it enough to request that our local library order a copy for me via inter-library loan of the book on which it was based, Will Stanton’s The Golden Evenings of Summer. Stanton’s book is essentially a collection of short stories in which the narrator recalls one Depression summer of his pubescence, but it’s not a children’s novel although a child of 12, as I then was, could certainly read and enjoy it. I read it again when I was in my early 20s, have just re-read it, and it remains one of the funniest books of my experience. Stanton had not merely the imaginative slant on life, even fancifully remembered life, that helps constitute great humorous writing, but a sense of the absurd and of comic rhythms. Like a great comedian he knew how to phrase a joke, how to build a comedic line, and how to explode it at the punch. In a way his novel reminds me of My Life and Hard Times, although I don’t claim Stanton is the equal of James Thurber. His collection of vignettes about life in a small Iowa town in the early 1930s has, however, the same outlandish sense of good humor Thurber imbued to his fictionalized family memoir of an Ohio boyhood.\n\nI don’t know if there was any way to translate Stanton’s literary achievement, minor though it may have been, to a performance medium. Possibly a nice play could be made from the stories in The Golden Evenings of Summer, although it would lose a great deal of physical detail and action, particularly regarding the two brothers, aged 12 and 10, and the broken-down jalopy they buy from a disgruntled farmer for a nickel. Probably the only means of replicating much of what makes the book so treasurable would be to use narration to retain some of Stanton’s more amusing observations and to connect the individual stories, as Woody Allen did with the vignettes in Radio Days. That’s if you want to perform an act of transliteration; if you want instead to make a Christmas Carol-type fantasy in which a cold husband and father becomes, with the threat of an early demise hanging over his head, a better man thanks to the intervention of a heavenly presence, you make Charley and the Angel.\n\nWhat’s best about the picture from a thematic point of view are the occasional lines and characters the screenwriter, Roswell Roger, took from Stanton’s book, although even there it’s a matter of ellipses, as when George Lindsey’s handyman Pete shows up: His dialogue, and the shape of the character’s outlines, are either from the book or in imitation of its style, but he’s a “funny type” merely. Missing is his entire raison d’etre as a character, and the boys’ relationship to him. Similarly the filmmakers lost the numerous family discussions in the book, which become a dizzying comic motif, Father’s stubborn pragmatism butting up against not only Mother’s no-nonsense stoicism but as well daughter Leonora’s blank self-absorption (a dazed “What?” is how she inevitably answers any direct question put to her) and younger son Rupert’s zany yet somehow unassailable 10-year old’s logic. Where in the book the boys run unwitting errands for bootleggers in that 5-cent jalopy, in the movie the gangsters turn on them, taking the family hostage so that father Charley (Fred MacMurray) can prove his worth by saving them. (Need I add that this is preceded by the then-standard comic chase which seemed to climax every Disney comedy of the era?) The picture is also curiously uncertain about its own time-frame. At the beginning mother Nettie (Cloris Leachman) observes that summer is coming to a close yet later it’s made clear that Father’s Day has not yet arrived.\n\nSo much for what the movie isn’t. For what it is, Harry Morgan provides an amiable blend of amiability and, if this is not an oxymoron, disappointed playfulness as the celestial visitor. MacMurray lends his inimitable voice and fatherly comic mien to Charley, and if he does no more than what he’d done a dozen times before, that was why he was hired. As Nettie, Leachman was a surprising but pleasing choice, although after years of enjoying her as Phyllis Lindstrom, in 1973 I found her dark chestnut hair-job a little disconcerting, and still do. If Leachman was a bottle-blonde she was correct to be so; the honey shade she usually sported softened the sharpness of her features and made her look a bit less hard. As the older and younger brother respectively, Vincent Van Patten and Scott Kolden are likeable, but Kurt Russell is largely wasted as their sister’s beau. The typically strong Disney supporting cast includes, aside from Lindsey, Edward Andrews, Richard Bakalyan (as one of the gangsters, naturally), Mills Watson (as the other one), Barbara Nichols, Liam Dunn, Larry D. Mann, George O’Hanlon, the funny-voiced Susan Tolsky as a young biddy, Ed Begley Jr., Pat Delaney and Bob Hastings, with Harold Peary heard as the unctuous host of a children’s radio show. Charles F. Wheeler’s photography is rather good, as are the special effects. Vincent McEveety’s direction is serviceable, but the art direction (John B. Mansbridge and Al Roelofs), set decoration (Frank R. McKelvy) and costumes (Shelby Tatum) are remarkable. The sets look absolutely lived in, and the period furniture and appliances are first-rate.\n\nCharley and the Angel isn’t a bad picture as these things go, but considering the quality of its source, “not bad” isn’t nearly good enough.\n\nThe Barkleys of Broadway (1949) If this dull backstager had been simply one of many lousy musicals produced at MGM in the 1940s and ’50s it would be mildly disappointing and no more. As the final screen teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, however, it is unforgiveable.\n\nPlanned as a follow-up to the 1948 Easter Parade and, like it, as a vehicle for Astaire and Judy Garland, the picture involves a married couple of bickering musical-comedy stars and the sudden aspirations of the Missus to become a legitimate actress. The movie’s director, Charles Walters had, quite understandably, no interest in dealing with Garland’s neuroses again after being driven mad by them on the previous picture, and someone had the brilliant notion of casting Rogers in Garland’s stead. While, despite her own dramatic U-turn (Kitty Foyle, in which she played an unwed mother and for which she was given an Academy Award) her delightful way with a comic line remained as undimmed as her protean abilities on the dance floor, the Rogers of 1949 was, inevitably, less lithe than the Ginger of 1939. This is especially noticeable in the “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” dance during a charity show where she’s attired in a low-cut, spaghetti-strap ballroom gown and her big shoulders suddenly overwhelm your vision. Rogers’ shoulders had, through her avidity for tennis, became far larger than Astaire’s and while she’s as graceful in dance as she ever was, with her flowing locks done up in tight braids around her head she looks disturbingly like a rather daring linebacker in drag. Worse, at the climax, when as Sarah Bernhardt she elects to recite the “Marseillaise” for her Paris Conservatory audition (something Bernhardt never did) she is made to look utterly ridiculous, her voice rising hysterically in what she imagines is passionate patriotism. When the sequence begins we expect Rogers to make a shambles of things, the way she demolished a radio broadcast while under hypnosis in Carefree, and when she launches into her absurd dramatic hyperbole we’re dismayed. Yet this is presented as proof of Dinah Barkley’s genius as a Dramatic Actress, and the Broadway audience (including the rightfully skeptical Astaire) goes predictably bananas, shouting “Bravo!” at this junior high school idea of greatness.\n\nAside from a few sharp lines and the occasional wisecrack assigned to Oscar Levant as Astaire’s musical collaborator, you’d never guess unless you knew that the unimaginative screenplay was the work of Betty Comden and Adolph Green. (Sidney Sheldon made uncredited contributions, but I doubt even he can be entirely blamed for the grinding witlessness of the thing.) Even Harry Warren’s music disappoints; there isn’t a good song in the batch, aside from “They Can’t Take That Away from Me,” which anyway was George Gershwin’s, and Ira Gershwin’s lyrics for the picture are on the same dispiriting level as Warren’s wan compositions. This is another of those mid-century musicals set in the theatre in which you can’t make out what sort of show they’re performing: Astaire and Rogers keep discussing plot scenes, but all we ever see are revue-type spots, the nadir of which, “My One and Only Highland Fling,” is the only truly bad musical number Astaire and Rogers ever performed. When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are in a scene and instead of being focused on the song you’re concentrating on the scrupulousness of Astaire’s sanitary etiquette with a communal dipping spoon, something is terribly wrong. There’s a number staged by Hermes Pan in a theatrical repair shop with articulated shoes that seems to owe something to, on the one hand, “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” and on the other to The Red Shoes, but which has no real point except to present Astaire dancing with animated footwear. (And anyway, it couldn’t be performed anywhere but a movie set, so why is it allegedly being done on a Broadway stage?) The movie’s big ballad (“You’d Be Hard to Replace”) is drippy and the only number that really cooks is a percussive instrumental, “Bouncing the Blues,” which, all too briefly, returns the viewer to the great RKO days.\n\nI hadn’t meant to go on at such length about as rotten a movie as The Barkleys of Broadway but I guess my devotion to Astaire and Rogers is deeper, and more constant, than that of the people who threw this stinking mélange together. I’m only glad I viewed it at home; if I’d seen it in a theater I’d have been tempted to force my way into the projection booth and put a match to the print.\n\n*That’s not to mention Seydor’s constant, irritating references to Peckinpah as “Sam.” Writing books and producing documentaries on a man’s work long after he’s dead does not entitle you to evoke his forename as if he’d been your great pal.\n\n†Interestingly, Sondheim wrote the songs for a “mini-musical” version of Jules Feiffer’s satirical comic strip fable “Passionella” Nichols staged as part of a Feiffer evening in 1962. They were friends for decades but seldom after, alas, and except for the birdcage for which Sondheim wrote a couple of new songs and placed one old one (“Love is in the Air”), artistic collaborators. When “Passionella” resurfaced as part of Nichols’ 1966 Broadway musical The Apple Tree, the lovely score was by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick.\n\n‡Charlie Wilson’s War (2007) which really was facile, was not a movie Nichols wanted to direct, and he was afterwards sorry he’d made it.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews &cet.\n\nAnne of the Thousand Days (1969) I was not bored watching the two hours and twenty-five minutes of this historical pageant, but half an hour after it was over I had to concentrate to remember any particular scene or performance in it. Perhaps if I gave more of a damn about the dynastic ruling families of Great Britain the story of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII might have more resonance, but I’m less interested in the private lives of these types than I am in the damage they do to others, and to the world at large. This is especially true of “royal families,” who whatever their current disguises, believe in the absolute, divine right of monarchy: We do as we please because we are ennobled by God. In Henry’s case, this extended to deciding what the official religion of his kingdom was to be, once the previous edition stood in the way of his rutting as he liked. I will grant that, as these things go, he was right to be concerned that, without a male heir, England would likely be plunged into dynastic wars again following his death, but I have no sympathy with the Tudors or the Stuarts or their imperial Hanovarian successors and especially not their rotten descendants, the Saxe-Coburg line that laughingly anglicizes itself as Windsor and thinks the world doesn’t know they’re Germans.\n\nThe movie, produced by the venerable Hal Wallis, was based on a play by Maxwell Anderson I have neither read nor seen, but the picture is reasonably literate (the screenplay was by Bridget Boland and John Hale) and handsomely appointed in art direction (Maurice Carter), set decoration (Lionel Couch and Patrick McLoughlin) and, especially, in costume design (Margaret Furse). Still, it’s astounding to reflect that such a middling affair as Anne of the Thousand Days was in its time up for ten Academy Awards, until you discover that Universal followed its screenings for Academy members with champagne and filet mignon dinners. Too bad there wasn’t an award that year for Best Bribe. The movie does boast an impressive cast, headed by Richard Burton and Geneviève Bujold, although Burton never really convinces you he’s Henry. He would have made a good Henry V, when he was younger, but he lacks the size and dimension for Henry VIII and the script in any case lets him down, seldom hinting at the king’s dangerous irrationality as Robert Bolt did with his Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons. Bujold, in her first important screen role, is in many ways remarkable but her Anne Boylen becomes a bit of a bore and even a pompous, demanding shrew, because that’s how she’s been written. (I’m curious as to whose bright idea it was for Anne to demand the head of Sir Thomas More, a barbarism for which there is no historical evidence.) Anthony Quayle is far more successful as Cardinal Wolsey, quietly scheming away while protesting that he’s doing no such thing. Indeed, much of the supporting cast is splendid: Irene Papas, hurt yet unyielding as Queen Catherine; John Colicos as a duplicitous Thomas Cromwell, toadying obsequiously yet plotting behind everyone’s back; Michael Hordern as Anne’s timid, avaricious father; and Peter Jeffrey as a nasty, snarling Norfolk. As More, William Squire seems to be imitating Paul Scofield, and it should be noted that, at least as far as his official portraiture is concerned, More most closely resembled neither Squire nor Scofield, but John Colicos.\n\nThe most tragic figure in the piece is poor Mark Smeaton, the royal music teacher who was one of many falsely accused of adultery with Boylen and broken by torture, particularly as played by the heartbreaking Gary Bond. His story would almost certainly have made a more involving and emotionally resonant movie than this one.\n\nRio Bravo (1959) Arguably the single movie directed by Howard Hawks that most neatly encapsulizes his interests as a filmmaker, and the wry humor with which he explicated them. It’s also one of the most engaging of all Hollywood movies. Hawks is one of those figures, like John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock, who while never taking a writing credit on one of his pictures was their chief animating agent, shaping every scene and even, at times, every line, in a way directors-for-hire never do. The recurrent Hawksian themes are here: Of group endeavors among professionals, anxiety over whether one is “good enough,” romance between laconic men and sharp, funny women and intense masculine friendship bordering on the homoerotic, coupled with teasing humor, periodic bursts of effective violent action and a pace that, while deliberate, seldom drags. (And speaking of the homoerotic, there’s sometimes a very good-looking boy in the Hawksian mix, such as Montgomery Clift in Red River. Here it’s Ricky Martin, unfortunately required to reprise that annoying finger-against-the-nose gesture Clift imitates Wayne doing.) It also has, in Angie Dickinson’s drily passionate “Feathers,” the most perfect example of the idealized Hawksian woman after Lauren Bacall’s Marie in To Have and Have Not. In some ways Feathers is Marie’s superior as a character in that she is warmer and her emotions are closer to the surface, which as she slyly pursues John Wayne’s John T. Chance makes her an even more appealing figure.\n\nThe 4K UHD edition burnishes Russell Harlan’s already luscious Eastmancolor images, especially the night exteriors, making it the best-looking of all of Hawks’ color pictures in a home-video format.\n\nThe Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939) Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers’ last RKO picture is also their most unusual: A “biopic” celebrating the first great, and most influential, ballroom dance team in America. Astaire’s approach to the dancing was so scrupulous (Vernon Castle was one of his youthful idols) that aficionados of Astaire and Rogers may be disappointed because they are dancing in character, and keeping to the style that made the Castles household names in the period between 1912 and 1918, especially their wildly popular “Castle Walk.” Astaire and Rogers were far better-looking than the Castles, and their teaming, still fresh on this, their ninth collaboration, makes their Vernon and Irene the most romantic pair imaginable. The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle is not, thankfully, a musical biography — no phony, Cole Porter-being-inspired-to-compose-“Night and Day”-by-raindrops moments here. The music is made up almost entirely of period instrumentals that accompany the Castles as they dance. There is only one original song (“Only When You’re in My Arms” by Con Conrad, Herman Ruby and Bert Kalmar), and it’s used as a diegetic source, Vernon singing the lyric as he works up the nerve to propose to Irene Foote. I’m always a little annoyed when I see the picture that the Foote’s family retainer was changed to a white man and played by Walter Brennan, although given the prevailing tendency in Hollywood to depict black men and women as “coons” for comic relief, it’s probably just as well that Walter Ash was written white.\n\nThis is the only RKO “Fred & Ginger” in which the pair portray a married couple (they’re also married in The Barkleys of Broadway, but that was 10 years later, at MGM) and while there is some tension between Vernon and Irene early on in their story, the typical screwball courting elements are, obviously, absent. Similarly, although the Castles’ eventual agent is played by the wry, eccentric Edna May Oliver and she becomes a genial confidante to the pair, she isn’t a full-blown zany like Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Helen Broderick or Alice Brady in the earlier Astaire-Rogers pictures. She’s only mildly zany. (Speaking of zanies: You may recognize Leonid Kinskey as the artist in Paris whom Oliver patronizes from his appearance as the bartender Sasha in Casablanca, ardent for Madeline Lebeau.) The movie is pleasantly directed by H. C. Potter, Robert de Grasse provided rich, warm photography, and there are some striking visual effects by Vernon L. Walker, particularly the sequence where the couple dances across a map of the United States. However, the affecting grief of the scene in which Walter breaks the news of Vernon’s shocking death to Irene, and Rogers’ fine acting of it, is almost canceled out by the terrible dialogue Brennan is given to speak. Astaire is engaging, as he nearly always is, yet in some ways Vernon and Irene Castle is a showcase for Rogers, from her hilariously overblown rendition of “The Yama-Yama Man” to the moment, late in the picture, when Irene unexpectedly meets Vernon, an RAF volunteer, in a nightclub and as he embraces her she whispers, “Oh, Vernon” in a way that in its emotion and anxiety seems to anticipate her husband’s later needless death. Rogers gives a beautiful performance in what Arlene Croce in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book rightly calls “a very dear film.”\n\nFor the record, the screenplay was by Richard Sherman, Oscar Hammerstein II and Dorothy Yost. The movie is often referred to as a flop. It wasn’t — it was popular with the public — but its budget (approximately $1,196,000) meant that even its high gross ($1,825,000) did not allow it to break even.\n\n“10” (1979) Seeing this Blake Edwards sex-comedy when it was new left me curiously dissatisfied, in a way I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Watching it again 44 years later I think I know why my nearly-19-year-old self was discomfited. The picture is bifurcated, in an odd fashion: The hilarious first half doesn’t quite line up with the more reflective second. The characters and the basic situation are the same — the successful middle-aged composer George Webber (Dudley Moore) seeks to relieve his male-menopausal sense of vague dissatisfaction by perusing an idealized woman (Bo Derek) he’s seen for a brief moment while driving — and when George flies off to Mexico after the girl, the tone is largely different… yet somehow it all feels like the same movie. I think too that at 18 I hadn’t anything like the experience of life required to empathize with Moore’s character; he seemed like a stereotype of the middle-aged letch seeking renewal in the arms of a hot young moron. Being older now than George was then, I can see both George and Jenny, Derek’s character, more clearly, and while I still think he’s crazy to risk his relationship with Julie Andrews’ warm and responsive Samantha, I no longer think Jenny is an idiot. She’s shallow, and her values are vastly different from George’s (she’s newly married, yet perfectly happy to jump in the sack with George while her young husband is recuperating in the hospital) but that doesn’t make her stupid, although her insistence on re-starting her record of the Ravel “Bolero” every time she and George are interrupted, to time it so they climax when it does, renders her exasperating. Life isn’t that canned, and certainly sex isn’t; Jenny’s single-mindedness risks turning erotic expression into nothing but an act of deliberate mechanism.\n\nAlthough its parts vary they don’t cancel each other out, and “10” remains an exceptionally intelligent and entertaining comedy; the physical indignities into which George’s erotic obsessions invariably lead him are cannily conceived by the writer-director, and perfectly executed by him, with that patient, almost Classical, application of the best means of photographing comedy to the most surprising effects of physical humor. When this marriage works, as it does throughout the picture, few things are funnier. Dudley Moore, previously noted as almost purely a sketch comic,* proved a remarkable adept at this, particularly given his physical limitations (he was born with club feet and even after many childhood surgeries one leg remained both twisted and withered) and he plays the more serious second half with sensitivity and real feeling. As his song-writing partner, Robert Webber plays a gay man without the slightest acknowledgement of stereotype save his character keeping a younger man (Walter George Allen) who eventually leaves him; I can’t tell you what a relief that characterization, both as written by Edwards and as played by Webber, was when I was 18. Derek of course was half the reason the picture grossed $107 million and she’s rather good, although I found those cornrows unappealing then, and I still do, whether they’re on a white or a black head; granted I am far from the ideal judge of feminine pulchritude, I don’t enjoy seeing that much exposed scalp on anyone. Dee Wallace has a lovely role as a woman who can’t get a sexual break, Brian Dennehy a beautiful one as a sympathetic bartender, John Hancock is charming as George’s psychiatrist, and Max Showalter has one of the best scenes in the movie, as a minister with a passion for writing terrible songs. Frank Stanley provided superb cinematography, beautifully lit and photographed, especially in the movie’s many nighttime interiors which have a rich, burnished look.\n\nPrime Cut (1972) A tough cult thriller that is almost a parody of pulp sagas, with several nasty contemporary flourishes that must make it a favorite aid to masturbation in the Tarantino household. These include the villain’s preferred method of disposing of would-be assassins, turning them into sausages in his meat-processing plant; his auctioning off drugged, naked girls like cattle; and a clever, frightening encounter by Lee Marvin and Sissy Spacek with a harvesting combiner. (That last item appears to be a nod to the crop-dusting sequence in North by Northwest.) Marvin, in a typically terse performance, plays a mob assassin whose objective is the murder of the cheerfully venal meat-packager “Mary Ann” (Gene Hackman) making Prime Cut the sort of picture in which the hero you root for is a hired killer and which tells you something about how appalling Hackman’s character is. Spacek, in her first credited role, is one of the young sex-slaves, rescued on an outraged whim by Marvin, and she has a remarkable, slightly dazed, mien. Previously an orphan, she doesn’t seem to have any experience of the world that might give her a sense of what is appropriate, as when Marvin buys her a whole new trousseau and she comes down to dinner in their three-star hotel wearing no brassiere. Hackman, coming off The French Connection, plays Mary Ann with a genial coldness that does little to mask his psychopathy, and as his bizarre, dangerous brother “Weenie,” Gregory Walcott is a genuinely unsettling presence, a rich weirdo who lives in a cheap flop-house with flimsy partitions rather than actual rooms. Some have said the odd relationship between the brothers suggests a homosexual liaison, but the behavior of the characters is so bizarre almost any interpretation would do.\n\nRobert Dillon wrote the pitch-black seriocomic script (he was, with his wife, later credited with the story for the underrated French Connection II) and Michael Ritchie directed efficiently. Gene Polito’s widescreen cinematography has exceptional richness, with Calgary exteriors subbing for Kansas City and environs. The atmospheric score is by Lalo Schifrin.\n\nRooster Cogburn (1975) A wholly unnecessary sequel to True Grit done for what I assume were entirely mercenary reasons and with maximal borrowings from elsewhere but which has many compensations, not least of which is the once-surprising teaming of John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nEl Dorado (1966) Leigh Brackett claimed of her screen adaptation of the Harry Brown novel The Stars in Their Courses, placing The Iliad in the old West, that it was the best script she ever wrote. Coming from the woman who also wrote Hatari! and who co-authored The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo, Rio Lobo and The Empire Strikes Back, those are words to conjure with. Unfortunately, the tragic nature of the material made Howard Hawks nervous, which I suspect was largely due to his having had two flops in a row and needing a more sure thing. Hence El Dorado, a loose demi-remake of Rio Bravo. The repetition disturbed Brackett: “The more we got into doing Rio Bravo over again,” she noted later, “the sicker I got, because I hate doing things over again. And I kept saying to Howard I did that, and he’d say it was okay, we could do it over again.” Hawks’ lack of compunction about repeating himself is one of his most dismaying flaws as a filmmaker, along with his blindness to the recurring homoeroticism between his male characters and his rich-boy’s indifference to spending other people’s money, which often resulted in his best pictures making less at the box-office than they should have because their negative cost was so great.\n\nIf you take in El Dorado without undue expectations you’ll likely find it an engaging, somewhat enervated, comic Western enlivened by its trio of central actors. John Wayne as a gun-for-hire with a conscience does little he hasn’t done before, but as usual with him, it’s the way he does it that registers. Wayne had been in pictures long enough that he knew how little he had to do, how small his gestures needed to be, to make an impact and the pauses he takes between words are always surprising, even if (as one suspects) he often did so because he was groping for the next part of a line. Other actors point at an object; Wayne stabs the air slowly and snaps his hand back in a single, flowing gesture and you’re never in doubt of the importance of what he’s saying, or less than delighted by the economy with which he says it. Robert Mitchum essentially plays the same drunken sheriff role Dean Martin assayed in Rio Bravo, and while I’ve always liked Martin in that picture, Mitchum shows you how much more effecting the part might have been with a real screen actor playing it. When, after enduring the crude insults of the heavies he returns to the jail with a bottle of whiskey, the tears in Mitchum’s eyes as he tells Wayne, “They laughed at me,” and the disbelieving hurt in his voice, make all the difference between a good moment and a great one. As the untested but enthusiastic tryo, the young James Caan brings a welcome freshness to a role that is largely a re-tread of Ricky Nelson’s in Rio Bravo. (He’s even called “Mississippi,” the way Nelson was nicknamed “Colorado.”) Caan is such a pleasant addition he almost gets you past the movie’s worst, and ugliest, moment: When against all likelihood he gets away with a patently phony disguise by pretending to be a gibbering Chinese. This “comic” bit would have fallen flat in 1930; for 1967 it’s practically obscene.\n\nWhile Arthur Hunnicutt is not as memorable as Walter Brennan in the role that echoes Brennan’s he’s quite amiable, as is Paul Fix as a sympathetic physician and Christopher George as Wayne’s knife-scarred rival. Ed Asner makes a quietly hissable villain, Charlene Holt is very fine in an abbreviated version of “the Hawksian woman,” Johnny Crawford is effecting as a dying boy whose fate, for which he is unavoidably responsible, shakes Wayne’s character to the core and Michele Carey is as sexy a tomboy as you’ll ever see. Nelson Riddle’s music, while not a patch on Dmitri Tiomkin’s for El Dorado‘s predecessor, and much more modern-sounding, is full of good things and may make you wish he’d been offered more movies to score, or in any case had been less busy arranging for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald and thus able to accept more such offers. El Dorado was shot in Utah and at the Old Tucson Studios in Arizona by the veteran cinematographer Harold Rosson whose Technicolor imagery is mouth-watering, especially in his night sequences and the glorious purple sunset farewell between Wayne and Holt.\n\nThe Journey of Natty Gann (1985) An amiable period road-movie from the era in which Disney was attempting to attract a more adult audience with items like The Black Hole, Never Cry Wolf, and the misbegotten Something Wicked This Way Comes. There is actually little to shield a child from here aside from a few relatively mild oaths (“shit” is the most frequent curse) and one brief, unsettling scene in which the heroine is menaced by a man who gives her a ride in his pickup, predictably foiled by an attack from her pet wolf. That sentence is less risible than it sounds since Natty (Meredith Salenger) frees the wolf from a dog-fighting ring early on and it attaches itself to her as a consequence. It’s a Depression story, in which a widowed father (the excellent Ray Wise) reluctantly leaves his daughter in the care of a Chicago hotlier (Lainie Kazan) when work on the West Coast presents itself. As the girl’s life there becomes more and more insupportable she takes off to follow her father, encountering railroad-riders, a gang of young hoods, an orphanage out of Little Orphan Annie and other travails. The outcome is never really in doubt, although the screenwriter (Jeanne Rosenberg) places obstacles in the paths of both father and daughter that occasionally cause you to wonder, or to try second-guessing. (I was convinced that someone, human or animal, was going to die before the end.) With its indomitable tomboy heroine, it’s a picture young girls ought to love, but that boys would also respond to, especially with that wonderful Canis lupus companion played by Jed, the wolf-Malamute mix who later starred in the 1991 Disney adaptation of Jack London’s White Fang.\n\nJames Horner’s score, as was the case so often with him, is so imitative I thought at first I was hearing the work of Georges Delerue, whose music for Something Wicked was tossed out the year before and replaced by a lesser but effective one by Horner. (I had forgotten that Natty Gann‘s original composer, Elmer Bernstein, was, like Delerue, replaced, and some of the music I was hearing and attributing to Horner ripping Bernstein off, was actually his.)† As Natty, Meredith Salenger makes a most appealing champion, personable but determined, and despite her youth, nobody’s fool. Her androgyny and her masculine attire also help her blend in with such wild boys of the road as John Cusack, playing a young homeless man Natty befriends. Cusack is an asset as are, in smaller roles, Scatman Crothers, Barry Miller, Zachary Ainsley, Verna Bloom, John Finnegan, Bruce M. Fischer, Hannah Cutrona and Sheelah Megill. The director, Jeremy Kagan, who had previously made the enormously likeable 1970s private-detective variation The Big Fix, has a nice eye for detail and a fine sense of pace, but the most impressive aspect of The Journey of Natty Gann is its sumptuous photography by Dick Bush. The picture was shot in Vancouver, and the vivid images Bush captured of its lush, verdant wildernesses pop off the screen.\n\nThe War Wagon (1967) An enjoyable Western comedy, directed with flair and a quickened pace by the veteran Burt Kennedy and based by Clair Huffaker, who also wrote The Comancheros and 100 Rifles, on his novel Badman. That word is interesting, in that John Wayne plays an ex-con conniving to get his hands on a cache of gold that should have been his. Granted he was innocent and railroaded into prison by the venal mining boss played by Bruce Cabot in a successful attempt to legally steal what belonged to Taw Jackson, Wayne’s character. But if there are Wayne roles, aside from the Ringo Kid in the John Ford Stagecoach and one of the 3 Godfathers, also for Ford, in which he played even an alleged criminal, I’m not aware of them. Not that this is a serious matter; The War Wagon is an escapade, and a largely merry one. Wayne’s antagonist and reluctant partner in his revenge against Cabot is Kirk Douglas, a happy heterosexual but because the actor chose to wear a large ring over one gloved finger, one that made Wayne predictably nervous. (John Wayne was nauseated that Douglas chose to play Van Gogh, so one can well imagine his reaction to that ring.) Along for the ride are a cheerfully cynical Howard Keel as a thoroughly Anglicized Indian, Robert Walker Jr. as a young explosives expert with a drinking problem, Keenan Wynn as a despicable petty thief, Valora Noland as his resigned child-bride, Joanna Barnes as one of Douglas’ playmates, Gene Evans as an excitable deputy sheriff, Marco Antonio as a belligerent chief and, in smaller roles, Bruce Dern and Sheb Wooley. The splendid William H. Clothier provided the excellent widescreen cinematography, and Dimitri Tiomkin’s score, which pretends to take the whole business seriously, is a peach, with a title song whose wonderfully silly Ned Washington lyrics are performed with brio by that other notable Caucasian Indian of the 1960s, Ed Ames.\n\n*With his comedy partner, Peter Cook. Both were alumni, alongside Jonathan Miller and the brilliant future playwright Alan Bennett (and, later, when Miller left, Paxton Whitehead) of the Beyond the Fringe stage show. Cook and Moore also wrote and starred in the amusing, if ultimately labored, Faust variation Bedazzled, cobbled up dozens of brilliant sketches and, in occasionally inebriated ad-lib sessions, recorded the genuinely foul, obscene, and frequently hilarious “Derek and Clive” albums.\n\n†Bernstein’s music for Natty Gann was later part of a boxed set released by Varèse Sarabande and that also included his rejected scores for Gangs of New York and The Scarlet Letter. Parlor game: Name a single movie that was substantially improved by its desperate producers throwing out one score and replacing it with another. This is what people do when they don’t know what else to do.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThis utterly charming romantic comedy, one of the most completely enjoyable I’ve ever seen, was one of several movies of its time I missed getting to at the theaters, in part because of reduced fiscal circumstances, in part because they often didn’t stick around longer than a week (and just as often never showed up at the cheap second-run houses)* and in equal part due to my reading or otherwise heeding the opinions of critics whose interpretive intelligence I later learned to question if I wished to protect my own, genuine responses, unblemished by allowing what others whose minds I did not respect wrote or said to become implanted in mine. At that time, I used reviews in newspapers and magazines largely as consumer-guides, and if a picture like All Night Long got enough opprobrium there I could cross it off my shopping list. This seems both the most common use of such reviews and the best argument against them.\n\nThe critical response to what, if you are open to its quirky characters and gentle European rhythms, is as bright and likable as the great screwball farces of the 1930s, was dismal, and dismaying. Take Vincent Canby in The New York Times: “[H]ardly a bit of it is believable or coherent. Yet All Night Long is never really boring, if only because one can’t believe the high quality of the utter confusion that occupies the screen… Everything in the movie is at sixes and sevens… a collection of random inspirations and ideas with no center of gravity. They appear, hang around a while and just drift away. It doesn’t leave one bored as much as baffled.” Or Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times: “Surely it wasn’t Streisand’s idea to play her character as a quiet, vacant-minded nonentity. Here’s one of the most powerful personalities in movie history, and she doesn’t have a single scene where she lets loose. She’s almost intimidated by the clothes she wears… [All Night Long] could have developed into a fascinating portrait of all-night society, but it doesn’t. It assigns a few weirdos to march through the store and do their thing, but they don’t feel real, they feel like actors. The story never approaches the rhythms of life… the director keeps losing the pace. Scenes begin with the promise of fireworks and end with the characters at a loss for words. You also know a movie’s in trouble when it has the heroine ride a motor scooter just to make her seem like more of a character… [T]he movie never really gets going. It’s got all the ingredients, but it feels a million miles from life.”\n\nI don’t know what movie Canby and Ebert saw, because what’s on the screen is, in its small, unassuming way, pretty much perfect. I strongly suspect that the people who carped at All Night Long knew too much about the circumstances of its making, as Canby admitted in his review. And while I know I risk sullying your possible enjoyment of the picture by rehearsing them here, the details seem relevant.\n\nAccording to William Goldman in his influential book Adventures in the Screen Trade, the basic germ of what became All Night Long originated with its director, Jean-Claude Tramont, who thought it might be interesting to take a look at people who work at night. Universal Pictures assigned the notion to the gifted screenwriter W.D. Richter, who came up with a honey of a script concerning a pharmacy chain executive discontented at work and at home, his demotion to managing a 24-hour urban drug supermarket, his desire to devote time to his inventions, and the married kook he becomes involved with after getting her to call off an affair with his 18-year-old son. Gene Hackman read it and was so avid to play the lead he offered to defer part of his salary in exchange for a profit percentage. The studio, penny wise and pound foolish, refused, so the whole of Hackman’s $1.5 million salary got added to the picture’s modest ($3 million) budget.\n\nSo far, so Hollywood normal. The movie begins shooting, with the criminally underrated Lisa Eichorn in the secondary role of Cheryl, the kook. Three weeks in, enter Sue Mengers, one-time super-agent, wife to Tramont and whose primary client is one Barbra Streisand. Suddenly Eichorn is out and Streisand in. And while to her credit she did not ask for her role to be enlarged, Streisand (or Mengers) did demand — and receive — a then-record $4.5 million, further inflating the small original budget to what ended up, with print, advertising and other distribution costs, closer to $20 million. And if those figures seem miniscule today, remember that we are talking about 1980 dollars, worth roughly three-and-a-third times what the same dollar represents in 2021.†\n\nEven with Streisand on the marquee, the picture died at the box office. Had Mengers not bloated the budget (Merci, mon amour!) All Night Long, which took in just $4.45 million, might with video and television sales have eventually (if barely) broken even. If there is any cosmic justice to be had, it lay in Streisand’s subsequent dumping of Mengers as her agent, a move largely related to the movie bombing. But that didn’t help the picture any.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of Ebert’s review was his determination that All Night Long didn’t work because Streisand didn’t dominate it. Yet her steamroller persona, evident in nearly every movie she had made to that point, is the main reason a lot of people have never warmed to her and why even those of us who love her as a performer sometimes find her unbearable. If moviegoers who felt antipathy toward her had been given a chance to see her as a sweet, lost soul with dreams she can’t attain — if a few prominent critics with large enough audiences had made them aware of the picture, and how good she was in it — I suspect they might have finally found a Streisand movie they could like.\n\nExcept it isn’t a Streisand movie, and that, for most critics, was why it didn’t work. Reviewers say they want more variety from movies, and from actors, but when they’re confronted with true originality they are usually hostile to it, and when a star like Streisand tries something new they slam her for it. (She was equally subdued, and excellent, in Up the Sandbox in 1972 and the critics carped about, and movie audiences stayed away from that one as well.) Even Pauline Kael, who was unique in enjoying All Night Long, and a longtime Streisand admirer, felt the actress was miscast, largely because she didn’t think Cheryl was a character Streisand drew out of her own persona.‡ Funny — I thought creating fresh characterizations is what actors do.\n\nAlthough there is such a thing as consensus, neither my response to a given movie nor yours is definitive. This seems to be especially true of comedy. Chaplin is generally recognized as a genius, but there are avid movie fans who are cool to him. Orson Welles said he understood that Chaplin was funny because everyone else thought he was, but that he was incapable of laughing at him (although I strongly suspect his statement was colored by having to sue Chaplin over credit for Monsieur Verdoux) and I know one writer who said of Blake Edwards, a favorite in my home, that his pictures “leave a trail of slime” behind them. Still, even if you don’t care for a comedy on the basis of its content or presentation, even if you think it witless or plain stupid, you know whether its logic holds or not. I personally loathe It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, about as mean-spirited, self-righteous and unfunny a comedy as anyone has ever made in America, and a near-complete waste of the dozens of great comedians who appeared in it. Yet never once have I suggested it doesn’t make sense.\n\nWhatever Canby or Ebert thought of All Night Long, I don’t see how either could claim that the movie is not “coherent.” It has a point of view, off-kilter though it may seem to some, and its characters, and their actions, however unusual (and who watches movies or goes to theatre performances to see depictions of normalcy?) are, within their own individual lights, perfectly logical. As to Canby’s weird complaint that the incidents in the picture “have no center of gravity,” I have no more idea what the means than I do Ebert’s criticism that the movie’s story “never approaches the rhythms of life.” What are these “rhythms of life” he’s whingeing about? And are the “rhythms” of The Awful Truth those of life as anyone knows it, or knew it in 1937 when audiences first started roaring with laughter at it? Well, Ebert always did use selective criteria. (Talk about a lack of coherence.) But why the hell is Cheryl’s riding a scooter rather than, say, driving a Honda Accord or a Mercedes-Benz, a desperate attempt by the filmmakers to “make her seem like more of a character”? Did Ebert think only a kook would ride a scooter?\n\nAll Night Long isn’t necessarily the funniest comedy you’ll ever see, yet from the opening moments, before a single character is glimpsed and voice-over dialogue is met by inspired sight gag I laughed often, and smiled consistently. When an opening gambit works as well as that one (and I won’t spoil it for you) you can relax; you’re in the hands of people who know what they’re doing, and how to do it. Richter, who wrote the enjoyable shaggy dog story Slither (1973), the witty 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers and one of the two scripts incorporated into Nickelodeon (1976) has an obvious affection for the square pegs trying to fit into the round holes of American life, or who have given up trying to fit in and no longer care what others think of them. On one end of this spectrum is Cheryl, the good-natured disappointed singer/songwriter mired in a loveless marriage with a macho creep (Kevin Dobson), who makes up what she thinks are creative recipes from canned goods and takes in lovers, like young Freddie (Dennis Quaid) when her fireman husband, who works nights, is out of the house. On the other is Freddie’s would-be inventor father George (Hackman) who loathes his job and his bosses and is likewise trapped in a loveless marriage with a status-conscious hausfrau (Diane Ladd) with whom he seems to have nothing in common. It’s only when George, who objects to his son being involved with a married woman, intervenes to dissuade Cheryl from continuing the affair that the two become attracted to and enmeshed with each other.\n\nAll of this suggests the set-up for a ribald sex-farce, but All Night Long is a gentle comedy about misfits, two of whom defy the odds by finding each other. There is one scene that holds the contours of farce, when Freddie comes to see Cheryl while George is (innocently) in her bedroom and she tries to get rid of the boy before he discovers his father on the premises. The sequence isn’t played out frenetically, however, or with that smirking aspect that so often turns farce into the acceptably dirty — smut for people who hate pornography.\n\nWhat really does seem obscene was Universal’s poster with its suggestive Drew Struzan artwork that simultaneously offended Streisand and caused the preview audience to expect a brassy Barbra Streisand comedy à la The Main Event, taking a sweet moment in a firehouse near the end of the movie and making it appear to anyone who doesn’t know the scene that Cheryl is some sort of pole-dancer sliding into the arms of three different lovers. What movie did Struzan think he was illustrating? Porky’s?\n\nAs a director, Jean-Claude Tramont matches Richter’s tone, which is at once generous of spirit toward the people in the picture and at the same time lightly satirical about them. His sense of timing is distinctly European, and I wonder if some of the negative critical reaction to the picture was due to the characters speaking English; if George and Cheryl had been French, would some of the same people who carped about the movie not instead have rhapsodized over it? Tramont was hampered by the studio-bound look of some of it, particularly in the exterior night scenes, although I can imagine the same auteurist types who go into ecstasies over the patently phony matte painting of the harbor in the Hitchcock-directed Marnie would probably have hailed Tramont as a genius had they seen All Night Long. I would say in this case, however, that if you succumb to the picture’s charms you don’t mind the artifice, especially when Richter’s dialogue is zipping along, as when the bellhop in the hotel into which George moves when he leaves his home apologizes for the condition of his room by shrugging, ”The maid’s sick. Spinal meningitis.”\n\nIt’s the unexpected in All Night Long that keeps you smiling and the action from foundering on the shoals of cliché. The movie almost never goes where you expect it to; every time you think you know what’s about to happen, or how a character will react to it, the picture surprises you — another reason I suspect the likes of Canby and Ebert were confused by it; to foil mundane expectations upsets mediocre minds. Certainly the reaction to Streisand’s performance seems wedded to expecting the usual, and not getting it. Because Cheryl is soft where Streisand is often hard and pliant where the actress tends to be unyielding, these reviewers found her lacking, and miscast, “endearingly so,” according to Leonard Maltin, who gave the picture a 3 ½ star rating anyway. Cheryl is seductive without pushing, and Streisand employs a mincing walk that, coupled with her high skirts, short blonde cut and penchant for lavender and mauve (including on the walls of her home; the paint almost seems to have been picked to match her outfits and her eyeliner) make you understand why men find her irresistible.§ Cheryl isn’t as funny as some of Streisand’s best characters (Fanny Brice, Judy Maxwell in What’s Up, Doc?) and isn’t meant to be. Even when she’s sitting at her piano singing a song she’s written and both the song and her voice are just slightly off, you don’t laugh at her. You may smile, both at her earnestness and at the greatest pop singer of her time choosing to perform badly, but Cheryl is too likable a figure to make fun of.\n\nIt’s impossible to overpraise Hackman’s work in All Night Long. He’s always been a wonderful comedian, although until Young Frankenstein few people seemed to recognize how witty he could be, and how engaging. His George is, despite his discontent, easygoing and open; he not only rolls with the punches but seems to find the battle itself more amusing than frustrating. Yet he’s no pushover, as the opening scene makes clear, as well as the sequence in which he visits Cheryl and her dour, firefighting husband in their backyard. He knows he’s putting her in a bind but he’s too worked up to be kinder, and he won’t take her resignation and fear lying down. His belief in her worth gives her the courage she needs to make the change she wants. Hackman was never a conventional leading man, and he’s not handsome enough to cut the sort of figure the general run of movie romance requires. The former was always his strength as an actor and the latter illustrates how shallow the genre tends to be, and why All Night Long is such a refreshing change.\n\nAlthough Diane Ladd as George’s materialistic wife Helen has relatively little to do, she limns her character so completely from her first scene that nothing more is really needed. As Bobby, Cheryl’s unappreciative husband, the dependable Kevin Dobson ably treads a fine line between boorish and brutal; although we don’t know that he’s ever hit his wife, the threat is there, unspoken but never far from the surface. Yet he’s easily dispensed with: In one scene late in the picture he drives with Freddie to the Italian restaurant where George, who’s walked out on the all-night drug emporium, is employed as a singing waiter. And here’s what I mean when I say that All Night Long doesn’t go where you expect it to. Any other movie, even a romantic comedy, would have at that point have devolved into fisticuffs at worst or a screaming match at best. In this movie, the staff diffuses Bobby’s confrontation by bursting into song (which Freddie joins in) and, en masse, escorts him from the premises. It’s a delightful reversal of expectation, and exactly what the viewer most wants to see at that moment even if he or she doesn’t know that until it happens.\n\nHe was too old for Freddie (the boy is 18 and the actor was closer to 30) but Dennis Quaid is such an appealing, uncomplicated presence he captures the essence of an aimless teenager besotted by an older woman, infuriated when he thinks his father is moving in on her, petty enough to encourage Bobby’s confronting George and yet open to seeing the fun in Bobby’s failure. (Freddie’s forgiving George without recourse to any soupy, emotional father-son reconciliation is another point in the movie’s favor.) William Daniels has an amusing small role as an exceedingly well-heeled divorce attorney; he has a perfect moment late in the movie when he realizes he has no defense and has just blown a heavy settlement in favor of Helen. Richard Stahl gets a nice bit as a pharmacist, the Amazonian Faith Minton a hilarious scene as a would-be robber, and Hamilton Camp a good gag as one of the nuts who frequents the pharmacy. Irene Tedrow is gruff and wonderfully dry as the landlady of a loft George rents for his workshop and Vernée Watson lends marvelous presence as one of George’s cashiers.\n\nAlthough Richard Hazard and Ira Newb"
