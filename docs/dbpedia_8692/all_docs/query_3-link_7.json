        "text": "This article originally appeared in the November 1982 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\n“The moment I first saw the house, I thought what a great time Faye and I would have restoring it, making it beautiful again,” says Gene Hackman of his home in Montecito. Located on twenty-five overgrown acres, the house was in run-down condition. “We spent a year and a half on it and it gives me a great deal of pleasure— continuing pleasure, you might say, because we are always working on it.”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hackman chose Steve Chase, a designer they knew socially and whose two Palm Springs homes they had admired, to design the interior of the house. Mr. Chase accepted a special challenge with this project. “It's a huge old turn-of-the century mansion, very formal, very European,” he says. “My challenge was to adapt the interior for a family whose life is very informal. Every room bears some evidence of our effort to make that transition work. I also wanted to keep the elegance and grandeur of the house.\n\n“Here was a house where people at one time were expected to wear formal dress to dinner, where there once were twenty servants in full-time service,” he adds. The Hackmans, however, dislike formal dinner parties. Their new dining room, once the breakfast room, is an intimate room with a small fireplace, French doors and an oval table seating eight. “I find that with more than eight it's difficult to have good conversations over dinner,” Mr. Hackman remarks. “For us, that's the pleasure of entertaining, and I think it works best with a smaller number of people.”\n\nThe original dining room, with its chandeliers and structured elegance, is no more. In its place is a capacious room full of comfortable furnishings. One wall is given over to a custombuilt media center. “This is where we spend most of our evenings,” Mr. Hackman says, “and where we also frequently have dinner. It's the place where we gather as a family, to relax.”\n\nPossessions from the family's previous homes are distributed throughout the house: art, chairs, a model train of the sort Mr. Hackman's maternal grandfather rode as an engineer, a large model of a sailing ship, Faye Hackman's collections of antique dolls and glass bottles.\n\nThe study, its paneling carefully restored, is filled with Mr. Hackman's collections of Indian baskets, kachina dolls, African masks and pre-Columbian art. “The leopard-skin pillows and seat covers are phony,” the actor remarks with typical candor. “I wouldn't have any real skins from an endangered species in my home. This is one of my favorite rooms because it is the quietest, well out of the traffic of the house. It has no radio or television. I come here to read.”\n\nThe most formal room in the house is the living room, and even it bears strong evidence of the Hackmans' and Mr. Chase's determination to introduce a more casual attitude into the house. “Steve has managed some incredible work in the living room,” Mr. Hackman says. “He's brought in wicker furniture, which somehow seems substantial, and mixed it in with more formal pieces, some old, some new.” Both Mr. and Mrs. Hackman felt that the room might not be used enough, so the actor came up with the idea of putting a pool table at one end. It worked. He says, “At first, Steve was a little bit surprised by the idea, but now I think he likes it.”\n\nReferring to the Hackmans‘ participation in the design, Mr. Chase says, “They are very receptive people who clearly understood what had to be done. But they wanted the sort of house their children and their children's friends could walk through in bare feet and not feel out of place.” For the Hackman children—daughters sixteen and twenty, and a son twenty-two—Mr. Chase created small apartments within the big house. Each has its own small sitting room adjoining a bedroom, and each child was invited to participate in the designs. The Hackmans’ bedroom suite consists of a large master bedroom, separate bathrooms and dressing areas, and a study for Mr. Hackman, where his Academy Award Oscar for The French Connection stands among photographs of his children and the scripts he is reading.\n\n1 / 8\n\nThe Hackmans and Steve Chase all agreed that the finely detailed wood paneling in the living room, the study and the media room should be returned to its natural state, so whole panels, with their intricate designs, were stripped of many coats of paint. Even the seven fireplaces had been repeatedly painted over and needed to be restored. “Every time we got one project going,” Mr. Chase recalls, “five more would appear. It was not the sort of thing where I could come in and say, ‘We will do this and we will do that,’ and make it stick. It required a great deal of flexibility and, on the Hackmans' part, a willingness to change if it appeared something might not work out.” Says Gene Hackman, “The impressive thing, to me, is the attentiveness to detail in a project as big as this. Steve is very meticulous, very businesslike—and he has a great sense of humor, something we like in our family.”\n\nMr. Hackman, who studied at the Art Students League of New York as a young man, has returned to his painting, in a glass-walled studio he had built on top of an abandoned water tower surrounded by ancient oak trees on the hillside property. And so that he can stay in shape for his demanding acting career, the lower half of the tower has been made into a gymnasium. The actor personally participated in clearing the twentyfive acres, restoring the terraced lawns and gardens, and trimming the massive oak trees shading the property. It was, he says, a project that made working out in his new gym unnecessary for many months.\n\nParticipation might well be the theme of both Mr. Hackman's personal and professional life. He was born in California, but grew up in Illinois, and is quick to point out that the midwestern work ethic is a strong motivating force in his life. His grandfather was a newspaper reporter, his father a pressman, and for some years Gene Hackman planned, and studied, to be a journalist too. “But I kept rediscovering the fact that I wanted to be an actor,” he remembers. “Finally the desire became so strong that I just gave in to it. It took me a while to get started.” He is a hardworking actor who does many of his own stunts, and he moves easily from drama to comedy.\n\nGene Hackman is the sort of man who is attracted to projects. This is not the first house to be renovated and rebuilt with his involvement and supervision. “There was concern at first about moving to Montecito,” he says. “It's too far for commuting to Los Angeles, but, at about an hour and a half, it's an easy occasional drive. People asked how we could move so far away from Hollywood. That wasn't hard. Out of the thirtyeight or so films I've done, only two were made in Hollywood. The last one was shot in Canada and Jamaica, and the next takes place in Tunisia.”"
