        "text": "One of the most versatile and well-respected actors in American cinema history, Gene Hackman enjoyed a productive career that spanned over six decades, encompassing exquisite performances on stage and in feature films. Once voted by his acting school classmates as the least likely to succeed, Hackman essayed some of filmdom's most memorable characters, a few of which earned the gruff, but sensitive actor several Academy Award nominations. Beginning as a reliable character player on stage, Hackman emerged as an unlikely hero of the counterculture with a bombastic turn in Arthur Penn's seminal \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967). Just a few years later, he secured himself an Oscar for Best Actor with his tough-guy performance as the unforgettable Popeye Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971). Hackman again delivered the goods in Francis Ford Coppola's paranoid thriller, \"The Conversation\" (1974) and followed through as the comically maniacal Lex Luther in \"Superman: The Movie\" (1978). Though he entered a premature retirement brought on by his exhaustive work schedule, Hackman returned to the fore in Warren Beatty's \"Reds\" (1981) and entered into what proved to be the busiest part of his career, which culminated in an Academy Award nomination for \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988) and a Best Supporting Actor win for \"Unforgiven\" (1992). After portraying a sleazy B-movie producer in \"Get Shorty\" (1995) and the rascally patriarch of a dysfunctional family in \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001), Hackman drifted off into an unofficial retirement that allowed him time to nurture his writing career while leaving behind a remarkable legacy."
