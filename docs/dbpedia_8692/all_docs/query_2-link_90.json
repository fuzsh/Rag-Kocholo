        "text": "Eugene Allen Hackman, born January 30, 1930\n\nAt the young age of 16, Hackman dropped out of high school and used his acting ability to convince his way into enlisting in the Marine Corps.\n\nIn 1947, the acclaimed actor completed boot camp and was quickly sent off to serve in China as a field radio operator. Hackman also spent time serving in Hawaii and Japan.\n\nDuring his time in the Corps, Hackman was demoted three times for leaving his post without proper authorization.\n\nAfter Hackman had been discharged, the San Bernardino native went on to study journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois. By 30, he had broken into a successful acting career and would be nominated for five Academy Awards and winning two for his roles in “The French Connection” and “Unforgiven.”\n\nSemper Fi! Mr. Gene Hackman and Happy Birthday!"
