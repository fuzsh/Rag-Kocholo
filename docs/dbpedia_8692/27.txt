Gene Hackman (born January 30, 1930, San Bernadino, California, U.S.) is an American motion-picture actor known for his rugged appearance and his emotionally honest and natural performances. His solid dependability in a wide variety of roles endeared him to the public.

Hackman left home at age 16 and enlisted in the marines for five years, entering the Korean conflict. He began a study of journalism and television production at the University of Illinois but left it to pursue acting at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. He found work in a number of summer stock and Off-Broadway plays in New York, as well as a bit part as a policeman in the film Mad Dog Coll (1961). He landed his first Broadway role in 1964 as a young suitor in Muriel Resnick’s Any Wednesday. His performance attracted the attention of Hollywood agents, and Hackman was subsequently cast in the film Lilith (1964), which starred Warren Beatty.

Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia

By the late 1960s Hackman was finding steady work in films, again appearing with Beatty in Arthur Penn’s 1967 hit Bonnie and Clyde. For that film, Hackman was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actor, a feat he repeated with I Never Sang for My Father (1970).

In 1971 he was cast as maverick detective Popeye Doyle in William Friedkin’s action drama The French Connection. The film was a tremendous success with both audiences and critics, and it garnered Hackman the Academy Award for best actor. He maintained a firm status as a popular leading actor throughout the 1970s in dramas such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Conversation (1974), and Night Moves (1975). Lighter films—such as Mel Brooks’s satire Young Frankenstein (1974), in which Hackman shines in a small role as a blind man, and Superman (1978), in which he portrays comic-book villain Lex Luthor—exemplified his versatility and his underutilized flair for comedy.
