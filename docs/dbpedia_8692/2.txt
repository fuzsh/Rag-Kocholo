BIO

Together with actors like Robert Duvall and Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman emerged during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a more macho and straightforward leading man, his performances having a quality of plain realism and, in his best moments, explosive power. He gave several strong performances in big hits during the 1970s, notably in The French Connection(for which he won his first of two Oscars), The Poseidon Adventureand The Conversation. He was also brilliant as Lex Luthor in Richard Donner's Superman, but his perhaps best performance came in the hard-hitting Ku Klux Klan-drama Mississippi Burning. Hackman was known as a reliable performer for over three decades, but towards the end of the 1990s, after winning his second Oscar for a supporting role in Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, his performances became increasingly pale, and it seemed he had lost his spark. He retired from the movie business at age 74 in 2004.
