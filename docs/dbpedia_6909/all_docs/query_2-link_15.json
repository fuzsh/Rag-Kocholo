        "text": "Any dummy who didn't already know that dissecting a corpse is a lot like having sex is instructed to study ''Anatomy,'' the clumsy German horror movie that sneaked into the AMC theater complex yesterday.\n\nThe bad girl in this preposterous Germanic imitation of American teen horror movies like ''Scream'' is a boy-crazy medical student named Gretchen (Anna Loos), who gives ''anatomy tests'' to her dates on a dissecting table in the ultramodern lab of a renowned medical school in Heidelberg.\n\nGretchen discovers to her annoyance that such a setting is not conducive to sexual ardor, even when she does an aggressive striptease. And she is eventually punished for her meanness by Hein (Benno Furmann), a spurned boy-toy who lurches around like a glowering caricature of a Hitler Youth recruit transplanted into the 21st century and divested of his Nazi insignia. Like many of the other students and most of the faculty, Hein just happens to be belong to a secret ''anti-Hippocratic'' society whose members believe that medical research is worth the sacrifice of human lives.\n\nSince ''Anatomy'' is a horror film, that lodge's philosophy has become a rationalization for the wholesale murder of innocent students. It is carried out by drugging them, injecting them with a substance that turns blood into a rubberized plastic and announcing proudly, ''It's statue time.'' If you wondered why the models in the anatomy lab are so incredibly lifelike, there's your answer.\n\nThe movie's plucky Nancy Drew who smells a formaldehyde-dipped rat on the premises is Paula (Franka Potente), a brilliant medical student whose beloved dying grandfather is a university legend. One of the many sad lessons that nosy, high-minded Paula eventually learns is that grandpa wasn't quite the pillar of medical ethics she thought he was. By the end of the movie, she gets herself into such a pickle that finds herself in danger of literally being pickled. Or worse.\n\nStefan Ruzowitzky, who wrote and directed ''Anatomy,'' has learned a few things from American filmmakers about setting up diversionary booby traps and finding the proper camera angles to show the glint of a concealed knife. But the movie, which is crudely dubbed into English, lacks the raucous, anything-for-a-shock carnival humor of its American prototypes. After it's over, the only question worth asking is whether dear, cozy old Heidelberg can survive the slander.\n\n''Anatomy'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes gory violence and nudity.\n\nANATOMY\n\nWritten and directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky; in German, dubbed into English; director of photography, Peter von Haller; edited by Ueli Christen; music by Marius Ruhland; production designer, Ingrid Henn; produced by Jakob Claussen and Thomas Wobke; released by Deutsche Columbia Pictures Film Productions and Sony Pictures Releasing. At the AMC Empire 25, 42nd Street at Eighth Avenue, Manhattan. Running time: 99 minutes. This film is rated R.\n\nWITH: Franka Potente (Paula), Benno Furmann (Hein), Anna Loos (Gretchen), Holger Speckhahn (Phil), Sebastian Blomberg (Caspar) and Traugott Buhre (Profesor Grombek)."
