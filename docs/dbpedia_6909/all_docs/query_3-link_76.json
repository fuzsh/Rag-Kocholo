        "text": "Please note: This event is in the past.\n\n40 years of Ralf König – 40 years of emancipation. The anniversary show by and with Ralf König.\n\nOver the last forty years, Ralf König’s comic characters have pointedly made fun of clichés about the appearance and behaviour of gay men. Drawn with plenty of irony, his characters embody a self-deprecating way of looking at things that has certainly contributed a lot to the emancipation of gays and also lesbians in our society. His comic strip “Der bewegte Mann” (The Moving Man) was the screenplay for the film of the same name by Sönke Wortmann, which is one of the most successful films in Germany with 6.5 million viewers and which probably brought a wide audience into contact with gay subculture for the first time.\n\nOn 31 August, Ralf König will be a guest at the HOSI Salzburg for Prideweek 2023. At 8 pm he will read comics, comment on them and certainly also talk about them. You can read more about Ralf König here.\n\nAdmission on this evening is 20€.\n\nDate/Time\n\nThu, 31.8.23 | 19:00 Uhr\n\nAddress\n\nHOSI Bar\n\nFranz-Josef-Straße 22\n\n5020 Salzburg\n\nGo to the event overview"
