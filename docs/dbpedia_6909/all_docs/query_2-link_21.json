        "text": "Who knows why Sonke Wortmann's mildly entertaining sex farce, \"Maybe . . . Maybe Not,\" has become one of the highest-grossing German films in history. Is it because the movie was adapted from a popular late-80's German comic book? Or is its depiction of a group of homosexuals as lecherous gorgons camping it up in clownish drag all it takes to tickle the German funny bone? Or is Til Schweiger, the actor portraying Axel, a young man who becomes the heart's desire of almost every gay man and straight woman to cross his path, the European heartthrob to end all European heartthrobs?\n\n\"Maybe . . . Maybe Not\" follows the adventures of Axel, a handsome twinkling-eyed waiter who finds himself kicked out of the house by his girlfriend, Doro (Katja Riemann), after she catches him cheating with another woman. Axel ends up rooming with Norbert (Joachim Krol), a gay sad sack whom he meets at a men's discussion group. When Axel moves in, he brings along a noisy pet bird named Shevardnadze, who has mastered the canny trick of playing dead in order to be let out of his cage. Once liberated, the bird devours every plant in sight.\n\nDon't ask how, but just when Doro discovers she is pregnant and decides to forgive all, she stumbles upon Axel in what only appears to be a sexually compromising situation with Norbert. It is the first of several times in the movie that Doro receives the wrong signal about Axel's sexual orientation, and each time she goes ballistic. The story builds to a frenzied bedroom farce sequence at the height of which Doro goes into labor.\n\n\"Maybe . . . Maybe Not\" lampoons anyone who takes sex too seriously. And who doesn't? The men in the discussion group where Norbert and Axel first connect are a bunch of humorless milquetoasts who sit around ludicrously theorizing about activities they are far too terrified ever to dare to try. Doro and her friends are the jealous, man-obsessed German equivalents of the \"Cosmopolitan\" girl, obsessively scheming to trap a man. They are also insatiably lustful. When Axel meets an ex-girlfriend for a tryst, she cajoles him into sniffing an inhalant called Bull Power, which she promises will turn him into a grunting, uncontrollable beast.\n\nThe gay characters are downright creepy. When not getting themselves up in outlandish drag costumes, they are either whining about their fleeting love affairs or drooling masochistically over unavailable men like Axel. When Norbert, who is a vegetarian, begins a relationship with Horst (Armind Rohde), a flabby, leather-vested butcher who is sexually impotent, the movie can't resist making jokes about sausage.\n\nWhat lends this flimsy comedy a certain grace is the unself-conscious performance of Mr. Schweiger as the hunk everyone wants a piece of. In a role that would bring out the narcissistic worst in almost any actor, Mr. Schweiger exudes remarkably little vanity. His Axel is simply a good sport, an easygoing, careless sensualist who doesn't have a mean bone in his body.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
