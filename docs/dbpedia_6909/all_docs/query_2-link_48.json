        "text": "A student discovers a secret society inside a German medical school in this slick looking thriller that’s not quite as good as I remember it being, but still fun. Franka Potente is the lead and I’ve always enjoyed her. There’s lots of gore and anatomical models made from real people, plenty of chase scenes, and an interesting story, but at times it does get ridiculous.\n\nI had forgotten about this one incredibly tense scene where s student hides in a cabinet in the school morgue. I had also forgotten how often Mr. Boom Mike drops into a scene, but that’s literally never stopped me from enjoying something. There’s also a montage done to Fatboy Slim’s “Praise You” that took me straight back to 1999.\n\nI love that poster.\n\nI still remember when 'Anatomie' came out and how it seemed like a fairly big deal at the time to have a new German horror movie.\n\nThough somewhat in the vein of the post-Scream wave but less obviously inspired by the American slasher than the super fun 'Flashback - Mörderische Ferien', this felt like a more gruesome and serious movie (partly because of its connection to the controversial Körperwelten exhibition).\n\nHard to believe this was almost 25 years ago and it somehow took me until now to watch it, but I'm glad I finally did.\n\n'Autopsie' feels inherently more \"German\" than something like 'Flashback', and embracing the German ways and locations is something I appreciate a lot more these days. …\n\nGood evening and welcome fellow Children of Chaos.\n\nHey look it's that lady from Run Lola Run!\n\nA story about a secret society of medical students that do bad things and the girl from Run Lola Run is trying to figure out what. In Germany.\n\nIt's Nazis, its always Nazis.\n\nAnyway. This movie is a pretty good conspiracy slasher and it has some cool effects. Less in the slashing but like in the effects of the Anatomy parts. One in particular with a blond girl looks really good.\n\nI really don't have a lot to say here, except I just crossed 4K followers? How? Why? I watch shit like this\n\nboxd.it/dvkG\n\nAnd This\n\nboxd.it/3VCG\n\nAnd This\n\nboxd.it/3qY5Rn\n\nAnd This\n\nboxd.it/5h1Kmd…"
