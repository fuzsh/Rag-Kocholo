The film is set to star Allison Janney (“Juno”) and Andrew Rannells (“Girls”) as they tell the story of a woman forced to make her husband’s funeral arrangements with her estranged son’s assistant, whom she has never met. The film is directed by Jim Rash (“The Way Way Back”) and produced by Kevin Walsh (“Napoleon”), Nat Faxon (“The Descendants”), Gigi Pritzker (“Hell or High Water”), and Rachel Shane (“The Eyes of Tammy Faye”).\n\n“I’m so thrilled to be reuniting with Gigi, Nat, and Kevin on this,” Rash stated. “If I could direct every single movie with the remarkable Allison Janney starring, I would. To pair her with the wonderful Andrew Rannells makes this a dream cast for me. As with all my projects, actors are contractually obligated to be my best friends, which is a huge win-win for them.”\n\nFor more information, contact MYLYNMProduction@gmail.com.\n\n###"
