Since enrolling its first class in 1865, the George Washington University Law School has produced some of the finest minds across the spectrum of legal scholarship.

That tradition continues today, as GW Law graduates use the knowledge and skills they gain here to influence the critical legal conversations of our times. The school is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a charter member of the Association of American Law Schools. The law school is located on the GW campus in the downtown neighborhood familiarly known as Foggy Bottom.

The main GW Law complex is located at 2000 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20052.
