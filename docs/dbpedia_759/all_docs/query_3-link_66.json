        "text": "GW Law students are taught by world-class scholars and seasoned practitioners. With more than 275 elective courses focused in 18 specialty areas, GW Law has one of the largest course curriculums in the country. Our students can undertake a broad but in-depth of exploration of the law. We invest in each student's success through strong academic and personal support, which includes mentorship, networking, and one-on-one career counseling that emphasizes helping students find the area of the law best suited to their interests.\n\nOur location in the heart of Washington, DC, places our students at the center of the most dynamic legal and policy activity in the United States. The White House, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the U.S. State Department, Big Law on K Street, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are within easy walking distance of campus. A short ride on the Metro, which has a convenient station on campus, allows students to hear arguments at the Supreme Court in the morning and return for classes that afternoon.\n\nBecause of our proximity to nearby courts, firms, nonprofit, governmental and international agencies, our students participate in over 500 field placements at these institutions every year. Our adjunct faculty consists of leading practitioners from these neighboring institutions. We also offer 19 clinical programs, ranging from immigration, health rights, and family law, to name a few.\n\nWe're known for being a vibrant and engaging community, one where a contracts professor can assist a student in a summer job hunt - even if that student is looking for a position in another area of the law. Our students exude collaboration, not competition, so they feel free to share class outlines or help each other prep for moot court competitions."
