        "text": "Courses from another institution may be eligible for transfer credits to Strayer, which can reduce the number of courses you need to graduate and your overall tuition. You can transfer up to 28 classes toward your bachelor’s degree (if approved). Strayer’s transfer credit page has more information, as well as a tool to estimate how many transfer credits you may be able to apply to your Strayer degree program.\n\nThere are a number of financial aid options worth exploring on our financial aid page. To apply for federal aid, prospective students should fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Stafford loans are available for graduate study. These are direct unsubsidized loans, not based on financial need. Unlike subsidized loans, Stafford loan interest will accrue while in the program. Making interest payments while in school will help reduce the amount of principal that would otherwise build up.\n\nThere are also scholarships and private loans available for Strayer students."
