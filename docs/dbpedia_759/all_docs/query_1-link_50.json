        "text": "Whether you’re an ambitious high schooler daydreaming about the future or a recent graduate researching a legal career path – deciphering the complexities of law degrees and their respective titles may leave your head spinning.\n\nThe good news is that you can find the answers to all of your burning questions in our legal education and career guide. But for now— let’s discuss the difference between the J.D. and Esq. titles, and how you can obtain them.\n\nDifference between J.D. and Esq.\n\nThe major difference between Esq. and J.D. is that the first is only a title and the other is a degree that is sometimes used as a title.\n\nEsq. is short for Esquire, and the abbreviation is appended to a practicing attorney’s surname after they pass the bar examination. J.D. stands for Juris Doctor degree — anyone who graduates from law school can claim this credential.\n\nRegardless of whether you stop at getting your J.D. or take the next step to earn the title of Esquire, there are numerous legal career paths you can pursue.\n\nJ.D. Or Esq.: which law degree is higher?\n\nEsq. is a title that’s considered to be ‘higher’ than a J.D.\n\nMany people use the titles Esq. and J.D. interchangeably, but this is a bit of a misnomer since the terms belong on opposite ends of the legal spectrum.\n\nThe J.D. is a foundational law degree that students must earn before they are allowed to take the bar exam. Earning this degree typically takes 2 to 7 years. Once they’ve completed the J.D. program, law students can pursue more advanced degrees like the:\n\nMaster of Laws (LLM)\n\nDoctor of Juridical Science (SJ.D)\n\nMaster of Legal Studies (MLS).\n\nMaster of Dispute Resolution (MDR)\n\nWhat is J.D.?\n\nJ.D. is an acronym that stands for Juris Doctor degree or Doctor of Jurisprudence. It is a graduate degree that law students in the U.S. must earn before taking the bar examination and earn the right to share legal advice professionally.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is in states that allow future lawyers to get their education through law apprenticeships rather than a formal program.\n\nThe only states that currently allow learners to become lawyers without attending law school are:\n\nCalifornia\n\nVirginia\n\nVermont\n\nWashington\n\nPros and cons of a J.D. degree\n\nYou need to get your Juris Doctorate before you can practice law or pursue more advanced legal degrees, but earning a J.D. is not the only option for learners who hope to start a legal career without becoming an attorney. If you plan to work closely with attorneys or law enforcement, you might prefer to obtain an MLS. Or if you’d like to work in arbitration and conflict resolution, earning an MDR might better suit your needs.\n\nBelow are some of the main pros and cons of earning a J.D. degree.\n\nJuris Doctor degree program length\n\nStudents who pursue their J.D. full time can expect to complete a minimum of 87 credit hours over 3 years. Some law schools also offer part-time programs, which may take up to 5 years to complete.\n\nJ.D. program coursework\n\nThe coursework of a J.D. program is designed to equip you with the technical and practical skills necessary for success in whichever law career you choose.\n\nFirst-year (1L) coursework\n\nFirst-year law students typically take general studies courses and learn legal fundamentals before selecting a professional track or distinction.\n\nAside from standard 1L coursework, students usually participate in moot court — a trial simulation competition — and enroll in elective courses.\n\nCoursework that J.D. students may encounter includes:\n\nCivil procedure\n\nConstitutional law\n\nContracts\n\nCriminal law procedure\n\nLegal assistant\n\nLegal research and writing\n\nParalegal\n\nProperty law\n\nTort law\n\nSecond- and third-year (2L and 3L) coursework\n\nIn your second and third years of law school, expect to attend seminars, clinics, and to participate in extracurriculars and networking events to bolster your resume and get real-life experience.\n\nThe coursework typically includes a mix of hands-on learning, writing and research, bar prep, and advanced electives.\n\nCareer opportunities for law students\n\nJust because you decided to get a J.D. doesn’t mean you have to practice law.\n\nBased on your unique skill set and interests, there are numerous career paths available that don’t require you to take the bar exam. Likewise, if you want to take more time to study or need to retake the test, these jobs can help you gain experience while you prepare:\n\nLegislative analyst\n\nHuman resources specialist\n\nParalegal\n\nCourt officer\n\nLobbyist\n\nPolitician\n\nCompliance officer\n\nExecutive director\n\nWhat is Esq.?\n\nEsq. is the abbreviation for Esquire. It is a title that follows an attorney’s last name to show that you’ve obtained your Juris Doctor degree and have also passed the rigorous bar exam.\n\nThe formatting of this title is similar to an M.D., B.A, Ph.D., and other professional degrees that warrant listing an abbreviation after your surname.\n\nHow long should you study for the Bar?\n\nExpect to spend 400-600 hours studying for the bar exam.\n\nWhile this may seem like a shocking number, it becomes much more manageable if you break down your study time into chunks and create a schedule. If you study 40-60 hours a week for about 3 months, you can consider yourself well-prepared for the bar exam.\n\nThe cost of the bar exam can range from $150 to $1,500, depending on which state you plan to practice. If you can’t study full time due to other responsibilities, don’t be afraid to take the test a bit later. The test is infamously hard to pass, so you need to be prepared.\n\nIs it hard to pass the Bar?\n\nAccording to the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), the overall pass rate for all reported jurisdictions during the 2022 bar exam was just below 52%.\n\nUtah performed the best with a 72% overall pass rate, and California performed the worst with a 34% overall pass rate.\n\nHow to study for the Bar Exam\n\n“Take as many practice tests as you can find. Reading, preparing outlines, and making flashcards can only get you so far. Forcing yourself to take full tests – both multiple-choice [questions] and writing out essays – will give you the best shot at passing the bar,” says Laurie Rowen of Montage Legal Group, who earned her J.D. in 2004. She has since co-founded the Montage Legal Group and become a respected legal ethics speaker.\n\nBelow are some other things you can do to give yourself an edge on the bar.\n\nTake bar review courses during law school.\n\nFollow a strict study schedule.\n\nDiversify your study strategy and actively commit information to memory.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) or the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) format.\n\nTake the practice tests your state shares online.\n\nInvest in high-quality test preparation materials.\n\nPractice healthy living and self-care.\n\nPlan for your career after you pass the Bar\n\nOnce you pass the bar exam, you can officially become a practicing lawyer and offer legal advice. If you decide that’s not the right fit, you can still use your law degree to pursue other passions.\n\nExpert advice for law students\n\nBecoming an attorney is no small feat. First, you have to get your Bachelor’s degree, score well on the LSAT, get into law school, make it through the J.D. program, and finally pass the bar. To help you make the most of this experience with the least stress, follow these 4 tips from industry experts who have already gained their J.D. degree and passed the bar.\n\n1. Find the right law school for you\n\nThere are a lot of considerations prospective law students need to take into account, beyond the obvious things like bar passage rates and post-grad employment rates. Do your research and apply to schools with supportive faculty and resources for students.\n\n“You also want to look at the median salary [of graduates] because you don’t want to take out 3x more in loans than the average median starting salary for any law school,” says Sydney Montgomery, CEO of S. Montgomery Admissions Consulting, the cofounder of the College Equity First non-profit, and a member of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n2. It’s okay to not know everything\n\nMake the most of your educational experience by knowing when to ask for help, and try not to feel down if you don’t understand something. Law is a competitive field, which is why it’s even more important to know when to ask for additional information or resources.\n\n“Saying ‘I don’t know’ to a cold call in class or asking classmates for help made me stronger as a person and a legal scholar. When you pretend to have all the answers, you actually block yourself from learning the truth,” says Montgomery.\n\n3. Start networking early\n\nStart networking right away. The connections you make in law school may help you for years to come. Networking is also a skill that can bring you business and retain clients in the future.\n\n“While I remember hearing the advice from many attorneys and mentors in the business world, prior to starting my legal education, I never fully understood how truly important it was to start networking from day one,” says Rowen.\n\n4. Be flexible and define success for yourself\n\nThere are endless career opportunities for law students. If at some point, your original plan no longer aligns with your goals or you’re going through significant life changes, you can always pivot to another area of law or an entirely different field. You might even start your own business or experiment with freelancing.\n\n“I learned that only you can define what a successful path is for you. And sometimes it is necessary to allow your path to change from your original plan. No matter what, there will be people that have expectations about what you should become, who you should be, and how high (or low) your aspirations [ought to] be,” says Montgomery.\n\nAttorney Laurie Rowen shares this sentiment, “Many lawyers choose to work on a freelance basis while raising children or starting a new business, and are able to keep up their legal skills, enabling them to go back to a traditional way of practicing law if and when they are ready.”\n\nShould I go to law school?\n\nA legal career path is a great choice for anyone seeking a lucrative, fast-paced, and high-paying career that allows them to make substantial changes in people’s lives and the world."
