        "text": "Yes. LSAC recognizes that candidates may use a name other than their legal name to identify themselves. These may include, but are not limited to, people who prefer to use their middle rather than their first name, people who prefer to use a nickname, people who use an anglicized name, or people who use a name which affirms their gender identity (chosen name).\n\nYou can provide your preferred or chosen first name, regardless of whether you have legally changed it, when you create a JD account. This name will auto populate into your account profile, and LSAC will use the name on most correspondence sent to you. Please note, you are still required to provide your legal/given name for ID verification purposes along your journey to law school.\n\nOnce you complete your account profile and save it, you can edit your information, including your first name (legal and preferred/chosen), last name, date of birth, and Social Security/Insurance number, through your LSAC online account .\n\nTo make changes, visit the “Profile” page included in the “My Account” menu. Your preferred/chosen first name may be updated at any time, but you may be required to upload documentation to support certain other biographical information changes, such as Social Security/Insurance number, date of birth, and legal first and last name. For more information, please visit Biographical Information Changes.\n\nThis is important. It is very important to remember that in order to be permitted to take the LSAT, the first and last name listed on your government-issued ID you will use in the verification process must exactly match the legal first and last name listed in your LSAC online account.\n\nIf you have questions about editing your account profile, name usage, or the ID verification process, contact LSAC Candidate Service at LSACinfo@LSAC.org.\n\nIf you intend to reuse a letter of recommendation for an admission year other than the one for which it was written, or for a different law degree program, it is a good idea to contact the recommender as a courtesy to make sure that the person does not mind this reuse. Some recommenders may wish to write an updated letter when you apply in a subsequent reporting year or to a different type of program. A recommender may decide to rescind a letter after becoming aware that it has been repurposed, if permission to reuse the letter has not been requested and granted.\n\nApplications must be viewed in Adobe Reader only. Not seeing the application itself or your answers is caused by either your browser using its own version of a PDF reader or by not having Adobe Reader version 10 or later installed. If you have an earlier version of Reader, you need to uninstall it, then download and install a later version. Reader is available free from https://get.adobe.com/reader. If you have a current version of Adobe Reader and have the same issue, you may be using Firefox, which has its own PDF viewer that is not compatible. You may want to try a different browser.\n\nA pop-up blocker can also cause a problem. You should verify that your pop-up blocker is turned off. To disable the pop-up blocker:\n\nInternet Explorer: Click either Tools from the menu or press [Alt]+[T] to bring up the Tools menu. There should be an option for Pop-up Blocker. Make sure that selecting this option shows Turn on Pop-up Blocker. If it says Turn off Pop-up Blocker, simply click on that option to disable the blocker. Alternatively, click the Gear icon in the upper-right-hand corner of your browser window, select Internet Options, select the Privacy tab, and make sure that the checkbox in the Pop-up Blocker section is unchecked.\n\nMozilla Firefox: If you are using a Macintosh, you would access this through Preferences in the Firefox menu. If you are using a Windows computer, click on Tools and select Options. Navigate to the Content tab where there should be a checkbox for Block pop-up windows. Uncheck the box to disable the blocker.\n\nSafari 8: Click on the Safari menu, then select Preferences. Click Security and uncheck the box Block pop-up windows.\n\nGoogle Chrome: Click the three horizontal lines/dots at the end of the address bar, select Settings, then Show Advanced Settings. Select Privacy, then click Content Settings. In the Content Settings window, scroll down to Pop-ups, then click Manage Exceptions. In the Pop-up Exceptions dialog box, under Hostname Pattern, type www.lsac.org and choose Allow. Click Done, then Done again in the next window, and close the Settings tab.\n\nThis issue is commonly caused by using the browser navigation buttons (forward page or back page) to navigate the Online Services account or closing the browser window before successfully logging out of the account page. Please be sure to only use the links, buttons, and tabs on the account pages to navigate through the LSAC online account.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you will need to clear your browser’s cache (temporary internet files) and cookies. Begin by first logging back in to your LSAC JD Account, then immediately using the link in the upper-right corner to Log Out. Follow the specific procedures below for your browser to clear the cache and cookies, close the browser window completely, restart the browser, log back into your account, and retry accessing this section of your account.\n\nSafari: Click Safari in the upper-left corner, then Preferences. Click Privacy, then Manage Website Data, then click Remove All to remove all of the cookies and website data, or scroll down the list and select lsac.org, then Remove the selected entry. Click Done. If the message persists, repeat the instructions, then restart your device.\n\nUpon logging in to your account, go to the Apply tab, mouse over the Applications link, and then click on the School List link. On the My School List page, click School Search. You have three choices: Add Member Schools displays the list of all LSAC-member schools; Add Nonmember Schools lists law schools that are not LSAC members; and Search Official Guide directs you to a database where you can research information about ABA-approved law schools. You can add schools from all three places. Check the box next to each school of interest and click Save Selections to School List at the top of the page (or Add to School List from the database) to create an alphabetical list. You may reorder this list any way you choose by assigning each school a number; click the name of a school on your list to see a workspace. Select My Law School Order or My Notes to assign a number and to save any personal notes. On the Sort My School List drop-down menu, choose My School Order to see the list in your chosen order.\n\nThis issue is commonly caused by using the browser navigation buttons (forward page or back page) to navigate the Online Services account or closing the browser window before successfully logging out of the account page. Please be sure to only use the links, buttons, and tabs on the account pages to navigate through the LSAC online account.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you will need to clear your browser’s cache (temporary internet files) and cookies. Begin by first logging back in to your LSAC JD Account, then immediately use the link in the upper-right corner to Log Out. Follow the specific procedures below for your browser to clear the cache and cookies, close the browser window completely, restart the browser, log back into your account, and retry accessing this section of your account.\n\nFirefox: Select History from the menu at the top of the window. Select Clear Recent History (or hold down the [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Delete] keys). Make sure both the Cache and Cookies boxes are checked, and select the time range to clear. We recommend selecting Everything. Then click the Clear Now button. If you have never cleared your cache and cookies before, this may take a few minutes.\n\nInternet Explorer: Go to the Tools menu (or hit [Alt]+[T] on your keyboard), select Internet Options, then click the General tab (if it is not already selected for you). In the Browsing History section, click Delete. Make sure the Temporary Internet Files and Cookies boxes are checked, then click Delete at the bottom. Again, depending on how often you clear your history, this may take a few minutes.\n\nGoogle Chrome: Click the three horizontal lines/dots at the end of the address bar and select History, or press ([Ctrl]+[H]). In the next menu under History (on the left side), click Clear browsing data. (If you do not see the menu, click the three bars next to History in the upper-left corner, then click Clear browsing data.) Select All time in the drop-down menu next to \"Time range.\" Only select the checkboxes for Cookies and other site data and Cached images and files. Click Clear browsing data. The window will close. Close the settings tab and close the browser, then reopen the browser and log into your account to continue.\n\nSafari: Click Safari in the upper-left corner, then Preferences. Click Privacy, then Manage Website Data, then click Remove All to remove all of the cookies and website data, or scroll down the list and select LSAC.org, then Remove the selected entry. Click Done. If the message persists, repeat the instructions, then restart your device.\n\nYou can create personal statements, résumés, and any other required documents in word-processing programs (such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, Notepad, and so forth) and attach them to your applications. The file name must not contain spaces or special characters. To upload and attach your files, select the attachment type in the Attachments section of the application, click Browse, choose the file you would like to attach, enter a title in the Describe file field, then click Attach. You can attach files in the following formats: DOC, HTM, HTML, TXT, WP, WPD, RTF, WPS, WPT, DOCX, PDF. Maximum file size is limited to 3MB.\n\nIt is important that the description of your written statements convey information regarding the content so that if you wish to edit or delete a written statement in the future, it will be easily identifiable. Law schools do not see the name of your attached documents.\n\nLaw schools can specify to LSAC the date and time of day (Eastern Time) they wish to stop the transmission of electronic applications. Information about these deadlines is included in the application instructions or checklists, and to the right of the school name in Active Applications, as well as on the law school’s website. You have met the application deadline if you have checked the application out of the Shopping Cart before the deadline date. Please check the law school’s website to verify the deadline date.\n\nThis is important.Please Note: You must place your completed applications in the Shopping Cart and complete the checkout process before transmission to the law schools can occur. The Save button only saves your application data. It does not send your application electronically to LSAC for transmission to the law school.\n\nEach application is stamped with the date and time (Eastern Time) you send it to LSAC. Once the application’s status is listed as Transmitted, the law school can immediately access the application, although each school maintains its own schedule for reviewing incoming applications.\n\nWe highly recommend that you not wait until the last minute to send your applications to LSAC. Internet slowness, server problems at your ISP or elsewhere, or other issues beyond LSAC’s control may occur, resulting in the deadline passing without your application being transmitted. Once the deadline has passed, the time stamp cannot be changed, so please pay careful attention to deadline dates. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have completed all the necessary steps to transmit your application.\n\nFirst, check the application’s status. If the status is listed as Shopping Cart, you must complete the checkout process before your application will be sent to LSAC. Once sent, applications can take up to 48 hours to be processed and transmitted to the law schools, depending on server load and other variables. If it is listed as anything other than Sent, Transmitted, Processing, or Completed, you have not completed the electronic transmission process. If the status is listed as Processing, you should monitor the progress of your application to see that it moves to Sent or Transmitted within 24 hours. If it does not, you should notify LSAC Technical Support. It is your responsibility to check and ensure that you have completed all the necessary steps to transmit your application.\n\nLaw schools specify the date and time of day (Eastern Time) they wish to stop the transmission of electronic applications. Information about these deadlines is included in the application instructions of the individual law schools, and to the right of the school name in Active Applications, as well as on the law school’s website. The time of day for the deadline can be different from other law schools. Please check the law school’s website for the day and time of their deadline.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you not wait until the last minute to transmit your applications. Internet slowness, server problems at your ISP or elsewhere, or other issues beyond LSAC’s control may occur, resulting in the deadline passing without your application being transmitted. Once the deadline has passed, the time stamp cannot be changed, so please pay careful attention to deadline dates. Once LSAC transmits an application, it can be immediately accessed by the law school, although it is up to the school how often they review incoming applications."
