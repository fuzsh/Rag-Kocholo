Here you can find data about PreK-12 students, transportation, school facilities, school accountability, educators, district finances, and school directory and contact information. The data portal contains the most recently available data and most files are specific for each school year of data. Older data may be available upon request. Look to our data sharing page for information on requesting or accessing older data.  Various file formats are used and some results may link to other pages (specifically the school apportionment reports from School Apportionment and Financial Services). The data on this portal does not fully represent all data publically available from OSPI, but is designed to be a hub for locating the majority of data available.
