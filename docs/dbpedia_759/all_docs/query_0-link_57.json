At Scalia Law, we believe in exposing you to all viewpoints along the legal and political spectrum and encouraging you to join the debate in a civilized and respectful way. You’ll learn to do this in a small and collegial community at our campus in the heart of Arlington, Virginia, a vibrant yet relaxed town that’s just a short Metro ride away from our nation’s capital."
