        "text": "Introduction to the Law School\n\n1.1 How can I learn more about the LLM program?\n\nYou can request more information and join our mailing list here.\n\n1.2 I would like to visit the law school. What is the procedure?\n\nGraduate and International Programs is staffed Monday through Friday form 9 am to 6 pm except holidays when the university is closed. Any staff member would be happy to assist you and no appointment is necessary.\n\nWhat encompasses graduate programs?\n\nWhat are the top questions you are asked?\n\nWhat is the value of doing an LLM?\n\nWhy should International students consider an LLM?\n\nTell us about the LLM class demographics\n\nHow do I stand out during my application process?\n\nEligibility and TOEFL\n\n2.1 What are the eligibility requirements for admission?\n\nWe require all applicants to have a first law degree in good standing and proof of English language skills as demonstrated by an eligible score on the TOEFL or IELTS tests.\n\nWe also accept applications from those who did not obtain a first degree in law but have become certified to practice law in their home country by other means, such as passing a legal qualification exam.\n\n2.2 Is there a minimum grade-point average (G.P.A) required?\n\nNo minimum G.P.A. is required. Applications are viewed holistically but successful applicants must have a superior academic record.\n\n2.3 What is your minimum TOEFL or IELTS requirement?\n\nAll eligible applicants must obtain a TOEFL score that meets or exceeds our minimum requirement of 100 on the TOEFL Internet-based test. We also accept the IELTS test with a minimum composite score of 7.0.\n\n2.4 I am taking the TOEFL or IELTS exam but the test date may be after the application deadline. Can I still apply?\n\nTo guarantee review of your application for the semester for which you apply, we will need to receive your TOEFL score by our specified application deadlines. That is, November 1 for Spring admission or June 1 for Fall admission.\n\n2.5 I took the TOEFL or IELTS and my score is slightly below the minimum requirement. Am I still eligible for admission?\n\nIf your TOEFL score is below the minimum requirement, you may still apply. The English proficiency score is only one part of an LL.M. application. We have the option of offering admission to our Three-Semester LL.M. program, which requires an additional course on English Drafting, Research, and Composition, and allows students to proceed through the program at a slower pace.\n\n2.6 Does your program provide any English preparation courses?\n\nNo, we do not; however, there are English preparation courses outside the university, some of which include:\n\nGeorgetown University, Center for Language Education and Development LADO International College\n\n2.7 Can I be granted conditional admission if my TOEFL score is below the minimum required score while I study to improve it?\n\nWe do not offer conditional admission. Admission is based on the credentials presented at the time of application. Strong applicants will meet or exceed eligibility requirements.\n\n2.8 I have a first law degree from a non-English speaking university but I’ve been working at an English speaking company for several years. Am I exempt from taking the TOEFL?\n\nNo, the TOEFL is required for all applicants who did not receive their law degrees from a university or college where English is the sole medium of instruction.\n\n2.9 I am from a country where English is the only official language. Can I be waived from the TOEFL requirement?\n\nIf you have a first law degree from a country where English is the only official language and the medium of instruction, you are automatically exempt from the TOEFL requirement.\n\n2.10 I am not from an English-speaking country but I went to law school in a country that is. Can I be waived from the TOEFL requirement?\n\nIf you have a first law degree from a country where English is the only official language and the medium of instruction, you are automatically exempt from the TOEFL requirement.\n\n2.11 Although my country is not officially only English-speaking, my university is, with English as the medium of instruction. Can I be waived from the TOEFL requirement?\n\nIf you have a law degree from an English-speaking institution but not a country where English is the official language, ensure that your transcript states that English is the medium of instruction or obtain such documentation from your university dean or registrar stating that “English is the sole medium of instruction” and you will be granted a TOEFL waiver.\n\n2.12 I will graduate from my law school this summer. Am I eligible to apply for this coming fall?\n\nIf you will have completed all your coursework by the time you would start the LL.M. degree you may be eligible to apply; however, once you graduate, you will need to submit proof that you have been granted your degree either by providing an official transcript or official letter from your dean or registrar. Otherwise please apply for the following semester.\n\n2.13 I have a law degree from an online university. Am I eligible to apply?\n\nAn eligible applicant must have a first law degree that was earned from a recognized institution with classroom instruction. Generally, degrees from other kinds of universities do not meet our eligibility requirements.\n\n2.14 I don’t have a law degree but have worked in a law firm for several years. Am I eligible to apply?\n\nAn applicant must have a law degree to be eligible for admission to the LL.M. degree program. Those without prior law degrees but who are interested in studying law subjects should apply for the Master of Studies in Law (MSL) degree.\n\n2.15 I am a licensed lawyer. Am I eligible to apply?\n\nYes, licensed lawyers are eligible to apply. Being a licensed lawyer may increase an applicant’s admission possibilities but only if the person already meets our minimum eligibility requirements; however, work experience alone does not qualify one for admission.\n\nApplying\n\n3.1 How do I apply?\n\nThe following materials, in original form, are required for applying:\n\nApplication form and application fee of $USD 80.\n\nPersonal statement\n\n2 letters of recommendation\n\nOfficial transcript(s) with English translations, if applicable\n\nResume or CV\n\nTOEFL or IELTS score (If applicable.)

Please either apply online at lsac.org or mail your original documents to our H Street address above.\n\n3.4 Can I pay the application fee with a credit card?\n\nIf you apply through LSAC, you pay the Law School application fee by credit card. Please note that applying through LSAC requires paying additional fees for LSAC services. If you are applying via mail, you can pay the application fee.\n\n3.5 How do I apply though LSAC?\n\nApplying through LSAC allows you to send all your application material, including your letters of recommendations to LSAC for compilation. It is not obligatory to apply through LSAC, and it makes no difference to the review of your application. We do not require the Transcript Authentication and Evaluation Service. If you apply through LSAC, you do not have to send any of your supporting documents directly to us.\n\n3.6 Do you have spring admission?\n\nYes, graduates of U.S. and non-U.S. law schools alike may start in the Spring (January) or Fall (August) semesters.\n\n3.7 Does the LLM program have an early decision/early action process?\n\nNo; we admit on a rolling basis.\n\n3.8 When may I submit my application?\n\nApplicants may start submitting their applications in September of each year for entry the following Spring or Fall.\n\n3.9 I am unable to pay the application fee. Do you grant application fee waivers?\n\nAlthough it is not guaranteed, we may consider you for a fee waiver if you include with your application a brief letter stating your reasons for seeking a fee waiver.\n\n3.10 If I decide to withdraw my application after submission, can my application fee be refunded?\n\nNo, application fees are nonrefundable.\n\n3.11 Do I need to include transcripts from all the schools I attended? What about certificate programs or high school diplomas?\n\nWe require original or notarized copies of transcripts from all post-secondary institutions of study whether or not a degree was received. The transcripts must be accompanied by certified English translations, if applicable. In addition, we also need verification of any post- secondary certificate programs you have completed. We do not require transcripts from secondary or primary institutions.\n\n3.12 Who should provide the recommendations?\n\nWe prefer to have at least one recommendation from a professor or personnel from your previous law school who is able to evaluate your academic abilities. If you have been out of school for several years, it is acceptable for both of your recommendations to be from supervisors in employment, preferably in the law field. Do not submit recommendations from relatives or friends.\n\n3.13 Can I submit more than two letters of recommendation?\n\nWe require two letters of recommendation. You may submit additional recommendations if you feel strongly that doing so will enhance the quality of your application.\n\n3.14 Do I have to submit the recommendation waiver forms?\n\nYes, you are required to submit the recommendation waiver form for each recommendation that you submit. It indicates whether you choose to waive your rights to see the recommendation letter or not.\n\n3.15 Do you offer any scholarships?\n\nGW Law Merit Scholarship covers full or partial tuition for U.S. and non-U.S. law school graduates and is awarded on the basis of academic merit and financial need.\n\nThomas Buergenthal Scholarship covers full or partial tuition for non-U.S. law school graduates and is awarded on the basis of academic merit and financial need.\n\nBen Gupta Endowed Fund for International Legal Education provides need-based scholarships to students from the developing world.\n\nThe Licks Attorneys LLM Scholarship provides tuition assistance to Brazilian law school graduates.\n\nRichard P. Momsen Fun for Brazilian Law Graduates provides tuition assistance to Brazilian law students with a special interest in U.S. constitutional law or intellectual property law.\n\nThe Honorable Gerald J. Mossinghoff Fellowship for Graduate Research in Intellectual Property Law is awarded annually to an LL.M. degree candidate who is a U.S. law school graduate. Preference will be given to a candidate specializing in the pharmaceutical field.\n\nRandolph C. Shaw Graduate Fellowship is awarded to a U.S. law school graduate who is an LL.M. degree candidate in the Environmental Law program. The recipient will assist the program’s director on a part-time basis.\n\nThese scholarships cover tuition only.\n\n3.16 How do I apply for a scholarship?\n\nAll applications are automatically considered for all scholarships; there is no separate scholarship application.\n\n3.17 When is the application deadline?\n\nFor priority application review, especially for scholarship consideration, applications for Fall admission should be received by March 15, but will continue to be reviewed on a space- available basis until June 1. For Spring admission, the priority deadline is November 1.\n\n3.18 Are there any other forms of financial aid?\n\nNo other forms of aid are offered through our program. Candidates are encouraged to look for outside sources of aid for international students:\n\nEduPASS\n\nIranian American Bar Association\n\nTOEFL Scholarship\n\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you are eligible for federal financial aid. Please contact the Law School financial aid office at [email protected] or visit FAFSA.\n\n3.19 What should my personal statement be about?\n\nIt should include any information that may be helpful to the admissions committee in their evaluation of your application, such as reasons you wish to pursue graduate study, a discussion of your background, or an explanation of any unusual aspects of your academic record. As scholarships are awarded on the basis of financial need and academic merit, the strongest applications will contain a convincing argument as to why the applicant needs and deserves a scholarship.\n\n3.20 How long should my personal statement be?\n\nA typical personal statement is 2-3 pages.\n\n3.21 Do you require a curriculum vitae or resume?\n\nYes, please include a curriculum vitae or resume that highlights your professional, academic and extracurricular experiences.\n\n3.22 Do you require any additional application material?\n\nNo additional application material is required for admission consideration other than what was listed above. Additional material is considered supplemental and will be reviewed after first reviewing your required application documents but they do not guarantee admission.\n\n3.23 Do you require an interview?\n\nAn interview is not required to review your application although you may request one with your application if you feel it may help further explain some aspects of your application.\n\n3.24 Do I have to disclose information about prior or pending criminal, disciplinary and/or academic problems in my application?\n\nYes, failure to disclose such information may cause your admission to be rescinded.\n\nAdmission\n\n4.1 How can I check my application status?\n\nAfter we receive your application, you will be given access to the Application Status Online checker. You will be given a login and password that you can use to check your status online.\n\n4.2 How long after I submit my application should I expect to receive a decision?\n\nAll applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, meaning, the earlier we receive an application that is complete with all required supporting documentation, the sooner you will receive a decision. It typically takes admissions 2-4 weeks to issue a decision. We will notify you via e-mail and then mail you your decision letter.\n\n4.3 Do I have a better chance of gaining admission if I apply early in the process?\n\nAdmission is granted solely on the strength of your application record. Although we do not have an early decision deadline, the earlier you apply, the sooner you will receive a decision but this does not guarantee a better chance of admission.\n\n4.4 Are my chances of gaining admission better if I apply to attend part-time rather than full-time?\n\nCandidates requesting an F-1 or J-1 student visa cannot apply to attend part-time because of visa restrictions. We use the same admission standards for both part-time and full-time study so applicants’ chances of admission are the same regardless of whether they attend part-time or full-time.\n\n4.5 If I previously applied and was denied, can I reapply?\n\nYes, you may reapply, but we will require a new application with any new information on how your candidacy has changed.\n\n4.6 If I am admitted to the LL.M. program, how long do I have to decide whether I will attend?\n\nWhen you receive your admissions letter, you will be given an acceptance deadline date by which you should confirm your attendance with a $500 tuition deposit. After this date your seat in the program will no longer be held.\n\n4.7 What does the tuition deposit go towards?\n\nTuition deposits are credited towards your first semester of tuition.\n\n4.8 If I send in my tuition deposit and then change my mind, will my deposit be refunded?\n\nNo, tuition deposits are nonrefundable.\n\n4.9 Can I defer?\n\nYou may defer your admission to the following semester or academic year if you provide written notice to our office of your intention to defer and the reason for the request.\n\nCost of Study\n\n5.1 What is the tuition for the LLM program?\n\nTuition is based on credit hour. The LLM program requires 24 credits. For the 2022- 2023 year, the cost per credit is $2,370 for a total program cost of $56,880.\n\n5.2 What other expenses do I need to take into account?\n\nLiving expenses for the duration of the one-year program based on 2022-2023 costs are estimated to be a minimum of $25,800. Students should also plan to take into account $500 for books and $2,690 for required health insurance. Students requesting an F-1 or J-1 visa from The George Washington University will need to show the availability of the total cost of their study and living expenses to obtain the visa.\n\n5.3 What is the tuition for part-time students?\n\nThe tuition for part-time students is the same as that for full-time students: $2,370 per credit, with 24 credits required to complete the program. Students who attend part-time must complete the program within two years. Students who require an F-1 or J-1 visa are not permitted to attend school part-time due to visa restrictions.\n\n5.4 Am I eligible to work while I attend the LLM program?\n\nAttendance\n\n6.1 If I start the LLM program part-time, may I later change to full-time status? Or if I start full-time, can I later change to part-time?\n\nOnly students who do not require an F-1 or J-1 visa to study in the U.S. may apply to attend part-time. Some part-time students may switch to full-time although it may take additional time to complete the program. Similarly, students who begin full-time may drop down to part- time status after having received permission from the director. Students who attend part- time have a limit of two years to complete the program.\n\n6.2 I would like to transfer to the JD program after completing the LL.M. How is this done?\n\nAlthough competitive, it is possible to apply for a transfer to the J.D. program. An applicant must notify the J.D. admissions office in writing by November 1, successfully complete at least one course from the required J.D. curriculum during their first semester of LL.M. enrollment and take the LSAT or GRE. The applicant must also request that Graduate and International Programs send all previous academic records and TOEFL scores to the J.D. admissions office by February\n\n6.3 Can I enter as a non-degree student?\n\nGW Law cannot sponsor F-1 or J-1 visas for non-degree students. Candidates without visa restrictions can apply to take up to 6 credits as a non-degree student.\n\n6.4 If I enter as a non-degree candidate, can I then transfer to the LLM program?\n\nNon-degree students who subsequently apply for and are granted admission to a graduate program as a degree candidate may have the credits earned at the Law School applied toward degree requirements; however, admission as a degree candidate is not guaranteed. Enrollment in individual courses as a non-degree student will depend on space availability.\n\n6.5 How long does it take to complete the LLM program?\n\nThe LLM program takes one academic year to complete, that is, two semesters, Fall and Spring, if attending full-time. If attending part-time, there is a limit of two years to complete the program.\n\n6.6 If I begin the LLM. at another university, may I transfer to GW’s LLM program?\n\nNo, we do not accept transfer credits from any other LL.M. program.\n\nStudent Life\n\n7.1 What types of housing options are available?\n\nMost students find and/or share off-campus apartments in the Foggy Bottom or nearby areas. In addition, the subway system makes it easy to live in Arlington, Virginia, or the Maryland suburbs and ride into campus.\n\n7.2 Are there student organizations I may join?\n\nGW Law hosts more than 60 student organizations."
