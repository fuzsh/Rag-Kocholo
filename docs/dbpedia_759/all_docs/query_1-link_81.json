        "text": "An apostille certifies a document so countries in the 1961 Hague Convention will recognize it.\n\nFederally-Issued Documents\n\nIf you have a document issued by the federal government and will use it in countries in the Hague Convention, you may need us to add an apostille.\n\nThe documents must include a signature of the official's name, title, and seal of the agency. Documents signed by the following officials must have this apostille:\n\nU.S. federal official\n\nU.S. consular officer\n\nA military notary, judge advocate, or a foreign consul registered with the U.S. Department of State's Office of Protocol\n\nBefore submitting documents to us, you must:\n\n1) Get a notary public to notarize each document:\n\nUsing a county notary? Go to the clerk of court first, and then a state office.\n\nUsing a state notary? Go to a state office.\n\n2) Make sure seals and signatures are originals\n\nGet a certified copy from a notary public. A certified copy is a copy of a primary document with a certificate on it that it is the true copy.\n\nGet records, court documents, and federally-issued documents certified at the state level.\n\n3) Get any documents in a foreign language translated into English. Get the translation notarized.\n\n4) After you get your document(s) notarized, mail your Form DS-4194 and documents to us.\n\nState-Issued Documents\n\nIf you're using the document in a country that is in the Hague Convention, get it certified by the state that executed the document. We will not issue an apostille."
