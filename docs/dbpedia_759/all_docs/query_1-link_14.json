        "text": "Faculty & Staff Menu\n\nStyle Guide\n\nFaculty, staff, and students all write for the Law School—on our website, in The Record, in admissions emails and campaign brochures. This brief guide is a resource for all of us and answers the most common questions about the Law School’s name and identity and grammar and punctuation.\n\nIf you don’t find your answer here, you’ll find it in the University’s style guidelines or the Chicago Manual of Style.\n\nGuidance on writing for the web has moved.\n\nSchool and Program Names\n\nOur full name\n\nWhen referring to the Law School the first time, write out the entire name of “the University of Chicago Law School” unless you are severely space-constrained.\n\nDo not capitalize “the” in running text, but do not correct alumni who do — he or she probably attended when this policy was different.\n\nShe attended the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nOur short names\n\nAfter the first mention, you can shorten our name either to “the Law School,” in contexts such as The Record where there is no chance of being confused with other school, or “UChicago Law” in contexts where other law schools are being mentioned or implicitly compared (as in admissions materials). “Chicago Law” is acceptable but not preferred.\n\nNote that “the Law School” is a proper noun in our case, so the ‘L’ and ‘S’ are both capitalized. Use lowercase when referring to law school in general.\n\nReferring simply to “Chicago” is only permissible in lists of law schools.\n\nHarvard, Yale, Stanford, Chicago\n\nReferring to the University\n\nWhenever possible refer to the University using its full name: The University of Chicago. After the first mention, you can abbreviate as UChicago in informal contexts, but never U of C or UC.\n\nProgram names\n\nKapnick Leadership Development Initiative. This is the formal name of the Law School’s action skills program that debuted in September 2014 and takes place during orientation. The name of this program changed after it was announced but before the first session began, so there are correct, but out-of-date, references to it as the Kapnick Leadership and Professionalism Initiative.\n\nKirkland & Ellis Corporate Lab. The program was founded in 2009 but was formally re-named in March 2015 after a nearly $5.5 million naming gift from Kirkland & Ellis. It should always be the Kirkland & Ellis Corporate Lab on first reference, but may be called the Corporate Lab on subsequent references. Some older news stories may correctly refer to it as the Corporate Lab.\n\nOther formal names to know: Doctoroff Business Leadership Program, Kreisman Initiative on Housing Law and Policy, Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics, Pro Bono Service Initiative.\n\nLogo, Typefaces, and Colors\n\nWhen to use the Law School logo\n\nThe Law School logo is an implicit seal of approval, and also suggests a relationship if it appears next to another logo, so we are very picky about when and where the logo is used.\n\nStudent groups and organizations outside the Law School cannot use the logo without the express permission of the Communications Office.\n\nFaculty and staff using Windows computers provided by IT can access Law School templates in PowerPoint and Word under “File > New > Personal.” For design help with these templates or with creating something from scratch, contact the Communications Office.\n\nHow to use the Law School logo\n\nWe have versions of the logo that are:\n\nBlack-and-maroon (preferred)\n\nMonochrome (usually all black, all white, or all maroon — for use when the black-and-maroon version does not work)\n\nMonochrome with the colors reversed — for use on dark backgrounds\n\nWhen using the logo, keep in mind that:\n\nThe black-and-maroon version and the regular monochrome version can only be used on light backgrounds.\n\nOn a dark background, you must use the version of the logo with the colors reversed, so that the letters are white and the shield has a white border.\n\nThe logo may not be changed in any way – you may not remove or add elements, change the aspect ratio, alter the shield, fonts, or placement of elements, etc.\n\nAny design using the logo must be approved by the Communications Office prior to use.\n\nSeal\n\nThe Law School also has a circular seal, which should only be used in less formal occasions when space is limited, and only on a light background.\n\nOther logos\n\nVarious Law School programs have their own logos, including Coase-Sandor and the Dean’s Circle. For questions about these logos, please contact the Communications Office.\n\nTypefaces\n\nWe follow the University’s guidelines for typefaces.\n\nOur main typefaces in print are:\n\nGotham\n\nAdobe Garamond\n\nIn addition to Gotham, typefaces that pair well with Garamond include Helvetica, Gill Sans, Lucida Grande, and Univers.\n\nOn the website, Gotham and Adobe Garamond are selected for you automatically.\n\nColor palette\n\nWe use the University’s color palette.\n\nOur main colors are:\n\nMaroon (Pantone® 202 / RGB 128, 0, 0 / HEX #800000)\n\nDark Gray (Pantone® Warm Gray 11 / RGB: 118, 118, 118 / HEX #767676)\n\nLight Gray (Pantone® Cool Gray 3 / RGB: 214, 214, 206 / HEX #D6D6CE)\n\nSpelling, Grammar, and Punctuation\n\nFaculty titles\n\nAcademic ranks (professor, associate professor, assistant professor, lecturer) are capitalized when associated with a person. They may be followed by the units in which the faculty member has appointments.\n\nDo not use “Professor of...” unless the “of” is part of the official name of the professorship.\n\nUse “the” only when the professorship is the only one of its kind, such as a named professorship.\n\nFrançoise Meltzer is the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor.\n\nGary Becker is University Professor in the Departments of Economics and Sociology and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nJane Doe is Associate Professor, Departments of History and Political Science, and the College.\n\nJane Doe is Associate Professor in History. (Her primary appointment is in the History Department.)\n\nJohn Doe, Assistant Professor in Physics, Enrico Fermi Institute, and the College\n\nProfessor Epstein\n\na professor at the Law School\n\nProfessional titles\n\nCapitalize a professional title if it is preceded by “the” or when it immediately precedes the person’s name; otherwise use lowercase. (This is a rule you can break if the professional in question requests to be referred to a different way.)\n\nPresident Zimmer\n\nthe Assistant Director of Communications\n\nthe Managing Partner\n\na partner\n\nan associate\n\nAcademic degrees and class years\n\nOmit periods in degrees:\n\nYES: JD, LLM, JSD\n\nNO: J.D., LL.M., J.S.D.\n\nIf only the graduation year is given and unless context implies otherwise, the degree is assumed to be JD. Add “LLM” or “JSD” when necessary for comprehension.\n\nRandall Zack, ’14\n\nHui Zhang, LLM ’14\n\nFredrick Huszagh, JSD ’62\n\nSet the graduation information apart with commas on both sides.\n\nOld King Cole, JSD ’42, was a merry old soul\n\nThe punctuation mark before the graduation year should be an apostrophe, not an opening quote. Microsoft Word often gets this wrong. On Windows OS, you can force an apostrophe by typing alt+0146. On Mac OS, you can force an apostrophe by typing opt+shift+].\n\nYES: Randall Zack, ’14\n\nNO: Randall Zack, ‘14\n\nThe Law School has been around long enough that ’05 could mean either 1905 or 2005. When it is unclear, we standardize by abbreviating the more recent year (2005 becomes ’05) and writing out the less recent year (1905 always stays 1905). In most cases, a graduation year before 1930 should be written out.\n\nHeadlines, page titles, and bullet points\n\nCapitalize all important words in page titles and main headlines, but capitalize only the first letter in subheadings. (An example of a subheading is “Headlines, page titles, and bullet points” above.)\n\nIf a bullet point is a complete sentence, capitalize the first letter and use a period at the end.\n\nSerial comma\n\nWhen there are three or more items in a series, put a comma before the “and” or “or” that precedes the last item.\n\nYES: I invited my parents, Mother Theresa, and the Pope.\n\nNO: I invited my parents, Mother Theresa and the Pope.\n\nFrequently used terms\n\nwebsite (not Web Site)\n\nemail (not e-mail)\n\ninternet (do not capitalize)\n\nfundraising (not fund-raising)\n\nalumna/alumnus/alumnae/alumni (not alum or alums)\n\nautumn, winter, spring, summer (seasons)\n\nAutumn Quarter (capitalize, not Fall)\n\ngraduated with Honors (capitalize Honors)\n\nWashington, DC (not D.C.)"
