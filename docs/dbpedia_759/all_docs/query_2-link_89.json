        "text": "There are times where it makes sense to pause and think before you answer a question. Dora The Explorer, one of the greatest characters of our time, frequently gives her viewers time to ruminate over questions like “What’s your name?“, “Can you see the Map?”, and “Holy shit, what is that Zorro-looking fox doing over there?” There are also times when your answer to questions should be immediate, namely when a judge asks you if you are hiding Brady evidence or knowledge of any other civil rights violations from the defendant or their lawyer. Yes, I’m alluding to some fuckery that happened during the YSL RICO trial. You really have to watch it for yourself:\n\nIf you ever needed to show a friend or colleague how loud silence can be, direct them to :36-47 of this video. If a judge finds it pertinent to even ask if there are any other civil rights violations that haven’t been brought to light yet and you have to consult your team before you answer, being one of the people that determines who has to live behind bars is not the right job for you.\n\nAt the start of this trial, it seemed like one of the biggest systemic issues that the case brought to light was how severely underpaid court-appointed counsel was. After Judge Glanville cozied up with the prosecution, it isn’t clear that defendants fighting cases in Georgia even have a fair shake at due process — how many other cases would have ended up in a team huddle if the judge asked the prosecution if they were hiding anything from the defendants, Dora style? It wouldn’t be as big of a problem if every person facing jail time had a Brian Steel as their attorney, but the unfortunate reality is that most people do not.\n\nStick around, more nonsense will follow up to the point that this case gets thrown out entirely."
