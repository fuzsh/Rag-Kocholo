        "text": "To apply to a UW graduate program, complete the UW Graduate School application. Please note that the UW Graduate School application and the information provided by GSEE does not apply to the following UW professional schools: School of Dentistry, School of Law, School of Medicine, and School of Pharmacy. Please contact those schools directly for more information.\n\nNew applicants will be asked to “create your applicant profile.” Undocumented students should answer the following questions in this way:\n\nQuestion 8: What is your current citizenship/visa status?\n\nAnswer: Other: F-1/F-2; J-1/J-2; H-1B/H-4; L-1/L-2; TN/TD; K-1; undocumented; DACA\n\nQuestion 12: If currently living in the U.S., indicate present visa status (if you don’t presently have a visa, select “None”). Answer: None\n\nQuestion 13: What type of visa status do you expect to hold while you are studying at the UW (if you don’t expect to have a visa, select “None”)? Answer: None\n\nAn undocumented student should be cautioned that they will be sorted into “international student” application status. If you are a Washington State resident, you will have an opportunity to change your residency status once admitted.\n\n3. When applicants are ready to submit their application, there is an opportunity to apply for an application fee waiver. A limited number of application fee waivers are available to applicants who qualify for financial need. Fee waiver requests must be submitted in the online admission application after all steps of the application have been completed and at least seven calendar days prior to the program’s posted application deadline.\n\nPlease visit the Application Fee and Fee Waivers section for more information >\n\nUW departments are encouraged to review their individual funding resources in detail to determine if undocumented students (that may or may not be DACA approved) are eligible. There are numerous non-federal resources (i.e. state dollars and private grants) that departments can explore to determine eligibility.\n\nUndocumented students with a DACA work permit can legally work in the United States. However, they are not eligible to apply for federal funding through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n\nIf an undocumented graduate student has DACA, they are eligible for Academic Student Employee positions, including teaching assistantships (TAs), research assistantships (RAs), and staff assistantships (GSAs).\n\nRead more on assistantships >\n\nThis table provides additional funding information determined by undocumented status eligibility:\n\nThe Office of Graduate Student Equity & Excellence (GSEE) is committed to serving the needs of Black, Latinx, Native American and Pacific Islander graduate students to enhance equity and graduate student success. GSEE encourages prospective and current undocumented graduate students to contact the GSEE office to get acquainted with our services and student programming. For more information, call 206.543.9016 or email uwgsee@uw.edu.\n\nThe Samuel E. Kelly Ethnic Cultural Center (ECC) has been a place where undergraduate and graduate students can build community with a diverse group of students who may share similar backgrounds and worldviews. This is a center dedicated to inclusion and offers leadership development, education on social justice, advising for registered student organizations, and a strong commitment to diversity programming. The ECC houses Leadership Without Borders. For more information, please contact undocu@uw.edu."
