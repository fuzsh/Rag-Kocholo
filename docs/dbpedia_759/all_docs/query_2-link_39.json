        "text": "We take the character and fitness section in your LSAC materials very seriously. Carefully and thoroughly complete all questions on the LSAC application. You may submit any additional materials to supplement your answers.\n\nThere are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar for every state. Prior to matriculation, applicants are encouraged to identify such requirements in the state(s) in which they intend to practice.\n\nOur Early Decision Program is a highly competitive and binding admittance program designed for candidates who have researched law schools carefully. The admissions committee considers strong credentials, as reflected in LSAT or GRE scores; undergraduate performance; and a wide variety of skills and experiences that will enrich our diverse community and enhance the classroom discussion. Applicants admitted through the Early Decision Program are awarded the strongest scholarship available to them as part of the entering class.\n\nEarly Decision Program applicants will receive a decision and, if admitted, notification of any scholarship award within two weeks of submitting their application, resume, personal statement, and transcript(s), as well as completing a personal interview (if requested by the Admissions Committee) with the Office of Admissions. Applicants admitted through the Early Decision Program are granted two business days to accept their offer of admission and any scholarship award. After accepting their offer, Early Decision Admitted Students are required to withdraw all applications at other law schools and may not initiate any new applications.\n\nApplicants not admitted through the Early Decision Program are transferred to our Regular Decision Program. If applicants have questions about applying to the Early Decision Program, they can schedule a consultation.\n\nStandardized test performance, undergraduate and graduate records, and educational rigor are all considered when evaluating applicants: the median undergraduate GPA for the Class of 2023 was 3.88, and the median LSAT score was 169. When the GRE is taken in lieu of the LSAT, strong performance on the GRE may also lead to admission. Additionally, strong personal qualities and the interview process feature prominently in admissions decisions, as we do not have a GPA or a score cutoff. Our admissions team takes a well-rounded approach to evaluating which students would be the best fit for WashULaw."
