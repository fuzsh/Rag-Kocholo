        "text": "Law school in Washington, D.C., US\n\nFor other uses, see Washington School of Law (disambiguation).\n\nThe George Washington University Law School (GW Law) is the law school of George Washington University, in Washington, D.C. Established in 1865, GW Law is the oldest law school in the national capital.[7][8] GW Law has 275 elective courses in business and finance law, environmental law, government procurement law, intellectual property law, international comparative law, litigation and dispute resolution, and national security and U.S. foreign relations law.[9][10]\n\nGW Law has an alumni network that includes notable people within the fields of law and government, including the former U.S. Attorney General, the former U.S. Secretary of the Interior, foreign heads of state, judges of the International Court of Justice, ministers of foreign affairs, a Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization, a Director of the CIA, members of U.S. Congress, U.S. State Governors, four Directors of the FBI, and numerous Federal judges.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nThe George Washington University Law School was founded in the 1820s but closed in 1826 due to low enrollment.[7] The law school's first two professors were William Cranch, chief justice of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia and second reporter of the U.S. Supreme Court, and William Thomas Carroll, a descendant of Charles Carroll the Settler and clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1827 until his death in 1863.[11] The law school was reestablished in 1865 and was the first law school in the District of Columbia.[7]\n\nLaw classes resumed in 1865 in the Old Trinity Episcopal Church, and the school graduated its first class of 60 students in 1867.[1] The Master of Laws degree program was adopted by the school in 1897.[1]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1900, the school was one of the founding members of the Association of American Law Schools.[1]\n\nGW Law has the oldest intellectual property program in the country, with alumni having written patents for some of the greatest technological achievements of the past 130 years, including the Wright brothers' flying machine, patented on May 22, 1906.[12]\n\nThe school was accredited by the American Bar Association in 1923[13] and was a charter member of the Association of American Law Schools.[14]\n\nIn 1954, it merged with National University School of Law.[1] The law school operated under the name National Law Center for the 37 years from 1959 to 1996, when it was renamed George Washington University Law School.[15]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nSupreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, William Strong, David J. Brewer, Willis Van Devanter, and John Marshall Harlan are among those who served on its faculty.[16][17]\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Samuel Alito presided over its moot court in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, and 2016.[18][19][20] In 2024, Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will preside over the 2024 Van Vleck Moot Court Competition.\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nCurriculum\n\n[edit]\n\nJ.D. students are required to take courses on civil procedure, criminal law, constitutional law, contracts, introduction to advocacy, legal research and writing, professional responsibility and ethics, property, and torts.[21]\n\nGW Law offers more than 275 elective courses each year.[22] The school offers business and finance law, environmental law, government procurement law, intellectual property law, international comparative law, litigation and dispute resolution, and national security and U.S. foreign relations law.[9]\n\nGW Law also offers numerous summer programs, including a joint program with the University of Oxford for the study of international human rights law at New College, Oxford each July.[23]\n\nDegrees offered\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to the Juris Doctor degree, GW Law offers the following joint degrees:[24]\n\nJ.D./M.B.A. with the School of Business\n\nJ.D./Master of Public Administration with the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration\n\nJ.D./Master of Public Policy with the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration\n\nJ.D./M.A. with the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences in History (with a concentration in U.S. Legal History), in Women's Studies, or in Public Policy (with a concentration in Women's Studies)\n\nJ.D./M.A. with the Elliott School of International Affairs\n\nJ.D./Master of Public Health with the Milken Institute School of Public Health\n\nJ.D./Public Health Certificate with the Milken Institute School of Public Health\n\nThe school also offers Master of Laws (LL.M.) in Environmental Law, Business and Finance Law, International Environmental Law, Government Procurement and Environmental Law, Intellectual Property Law, International and Comparative Law, Government Procurement Law, Litigation and Dispute Resolution, and National Security and U.S. Foreign Relations Law.[25] The Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) is offered to a very limited number of candidates.[26]\n\nStudent recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nInstead of supplying students with individual class rankings, GW Law recognizes academic performance with two scholar designations.[27] The top 1–15% of the class is designated George Washington Scholars while the top 16–35% of the class is designated Thurgood Marshall Scholars.[27]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nGW Law publishes nine journals:[28]\n\nThe George Washington Law Review\n\nThe George Washington International Law Review\n\nThe George Washington Business & Finance Law Review\n\nThe Federal Circuit Bar Journal\n\nThe American Intellectual Property Law Association Quarterly Journal\n\nThe Public Contract Law Journal\n\nThe Federal Communications Law Journal\n\nThe Journal of Energy and Environmental Law\n\nInternational Law in Domestic Courts Journal\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nWith more than 1,600 J.D. students enrolled in the 2013–2014 academic year, GW Law had the fifth largest J.D. enrollment of all ABA-accredited law schools.[29]\n\nIn the 2013–2014 academic year, 25.2% of GW Law students were minorities and 46.2% were female.[30]\n\nStudents enrolled in the J.D. program come from 206 colleges and 11 countries.[31] The law school also enrolls students from approximately 45 countries each year in its Master of Laws and Doctor of Juridical Science degree programs.[32]\n\nGW Law students can participate in 60 student groups.[33]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nGW Law is located in the heart of Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood, across the street from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund headquarters, and a few blocks away from the State Department and the White House.[34]\n\nThe Jacob Burns Law Library holds a collection of more than 700,000 volumes.[35]\n\nIn 2000, the law school began a major building and renovation plan. The school has expanded into buildings on the east side of the University Yard.\n\nThe law school currently occupies nine buildings on the main campus of The George Washington University. The law school's main complex comprises five buildings anchored by Stockton Hall (1924) located on the University Yard, the central open space of GW's urban campus. Renovated extensively between 2001 and 2003, these buildings adjoin one another, have internal passageways, and function as one consolidated complex. Three townhouses directly across from the main complex house the Community Legal Clinics, Student Bar Association, and student journal offices.\n\nAdmissions\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the class entering in the fall of 2019, 2,488 out of 8,019 J.D. applicants (31%) were offered admission, with 489 matriculating. The 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles for the 2019 full-time entering class were 160 and 167, respectively, with a median of 166 (93rd percentile[36]).[37] The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.40 and 3.84, respectively, with a median of 3.74.[38] In the 2018–19 academic year, GW Law had 1,525 J.D. students, of which 25% were minorities and 51% were female.[38]\n\nIn order to apply for the J.D. program, students must have taken the LSAT within the past five years and must submit a personal statement and at least one letter of recommendation.[39] The GRE is also accepted instead of the LSAT. An applicant with scores for both the GRE and LSAT will have its LSAT score reviewed. Applications are considered on a rolling basis starting in October and must be submitted by March 1.[39]\n\nRankings and reputation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2024, U.S. News & World Report ranks GW Law as the 41st top law school out of 196 in the United States.[40] In 2014, the National Law Journal ranked GW Law 21st for law schools that sent the highest percentage of new graduates to NLJ 250 law firms, the largest and most prominent law practices in the U.S.[41]\n\nIn 2020, GW was ranked as the 11th best moot court program in the country and regularly hosts a U.S. Supreme Court justice on its three-judge panel.[42]\n\nAccording to Brian Leiter's law school rankings, GW Law ranked 17th in the nation for Supreme Court clerkship placement between 2003 and 2013,[43] 19th in terms of student numerical quality,[44] and 16th for law faculties with the most \"scholarly impact\" as measured by numbers of citations.[45]\n\nGW Law has placed 27 clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court in its history, including in the 1930s Francis R. Kirkham, later partner at Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro in San Francisco and then general counsel to Standard Oil of California, and Reynolds Robertson, who worked for Cravath, deGersdorff, Swaine & Wood in New York City, both co-authors of a seminal work on the Court's jurisdiction.[46][47][48]\n\nPost-graduation employment\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to GW Law's official 2019 ABA-required disclosures, 73.6% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, bar passage-required, non-school funded employment ten months after graduation.[49]\n\nGW Law's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 12.1%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2019 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job ten months after graduation.[50] 0.6% of graduates were in school-funded jobs. 89.5% of the Class of 2019 was employed in some capacity, 1.4% were pursuing a graduate degree, and 6.8% were unemployed and seeking employment.[49]\n\nThe main employment destinations for 2019 GW Law graduates were Washington, D.C., New York City, and Virginia.[49]\n\nCosts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe total cost of full-time attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at GW Law for the 2018-2019 academic year was $88,340.[51] GW Law's tuition and fees on average increased by 4.1% annually over the past five years.[52]\n\nThe Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $328,263.[52] The average indebtedness of the 76% of 2013 GW Law graduates who took out loans was $123,693.[53]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable Alumni of the GW Law School\n\nBelva Ann Lockwood, first woman to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nHsu Mo, founding judge of the International Court of Justice\n\nJ.
