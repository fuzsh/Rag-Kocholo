        "text": "Here, the broad study of the liberal arts is matched with the sophisticated research that advances discovery and influences policy. Our oldest and largest college, Columbian is a home for both generalists and specialists. Our students and professors conduct behavioral research with orangutans at the National Zoo, scrutinize original historic documents at the Folger Shakespeare Library, develop solar conversion methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and devise new systems to support clinical diagnostics and the monitoring of food processes. At Columbian, we emphasize perspective, analysis and communication, encourage collaboration with external partners and inspire lasting change.\n\nThe Corcoran School, part of Columbian College, is not only an incubator for artists and practitioners in arts-related fields, but an institution that enriches students throughout the university. Ultimately, the Corcoran School embodies what Columbian has defined as the “engaged liberal arts” by providing a platform for engagement that bridges creative expression and practical application, links disparate fields and better prepares our graduates for rich, multidimensional careers in the 21st century world.\n\nThe Corcoran name has long been synonymous with innovation and education in the arts, since the founding of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1869 and its affiliated school in 1878. GW is proud to join in preserving and growing the Corcoran legacy through a historic agreement with the gallery and school in 2014, in partnership with the National Gallery of Art. While the Corcoran School will prepare specialists, it will also enrich the overall educational experience for the breadth of students in the GW community."
