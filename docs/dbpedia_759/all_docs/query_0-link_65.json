        "text": "Located about four blocks from the White House, The George Washington University is a private institution of higher learning in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1821 under the name Columbian College, it took its present name in 1904. The university also has main campuses in Ashburn, Virginia, and in the Foxhall neighborhood of Washington, D.C., at the former site of Mount Vernon College.\n\nThe George Washington University grants associate, bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral, and professional degrees. Total enrollment is approximately 25,000 students, most of whom are graduate or professional students. Studies take place through the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Professional Studies (for working adults), and schools of business, education, engineering, international affairs, law, medicine, nursing, and public health. George Washington was the first university in the world to conduct a degree program in political communication. The law school is a leader in the field of intellectual property. Many students at George Washington hold internships, participate in cooperative education programs, or study abroad. Students can also take classes at other universities in the district. A major research institution, George Washington is the site of the Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies and the Space Policy Institute.\n\nThe university’s varsity sports teams, nicknamed the Colonials, compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). School colors are buff and blue."
