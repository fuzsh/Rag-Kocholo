        "text": "The said the number of Americans without health insurance has gone up so far in 2024, breaking a streak of record low-figures.\n\nDr. Richard Ricciardi isn't just an associate dean in the School of Nursing at George Washington University; he also practices at a clinic in Maryland for people who don't have health insurance. The patients he sees are a part of the 8% of Americans without health insurance.\n\nIt's a number that represents more than 27 million people.\n\nWe do the best we can with the limited resources we have as a community-based clinic to accept individuals who don't have health insurance,\" Ricciardi said.\n\nAs for why more Americans don't have health insurance, Ricciardi said there are likely a few reasons, including access to Medicaid.\n\nYou know, in many states, the rules surrounding who is eligible to receive Medicaid has changed,\" said Ricciardi.\n\nJacqueline Epstein, a professor of practice in general legal studies, said not only did access to Medicaid change this year, but so did the cost.\n\nMedicaid part 'A' and part 'B' -- the premiums and deductibles increased in 2024,\" Epstein said.\n\nPlus, Epstein said the economy and inflation could also be contributing factors.\n\nIncreased inflation and cost of living -- they're having an effect on what people are willing to spend their monthly budget on and health insurance. The premiums have risen,\" said Epstein.\n\nEpstein also said urgent care could be a contributing factor into the uninsured numbers. According to , at least 26% of adults visited an urgent care in the last year."
