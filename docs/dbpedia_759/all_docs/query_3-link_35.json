        "text": "One of the most important factors to consider when selecting a college or university is whether or not your institution of choice is accredited nationally or regionally at the institutional level. The type of accreditation plays a role in areas that may impact you as both a student (such as cost or how many credits may transfer if you switch schools) and after graduation (such as employability, tuition reimbursement, and employer background checks).\n\nLearn more about differences between national and regional institutional accreditation, why it’s important that your institution is accredited, and tips to help verify your college or university’s accreditation status.\n\nHow Are Colleges Accredited?\n\nEducational institutions are either regionally or nationally accredited. Accreditation is a voluntary process that ensures a college, university, or degree program meets a universal standard for quality. This gives an institution and its graduates credibility with other institutions and employers. Institutional accreditation is different from programmatic accreditation – which is covered below.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) does not accredit educational institutions and/or programs. However, the USDOE and the non-profit Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) oversee the accreditation process. They review the federally-recognized agencies that set accreditation standards.\n\nWhether or not an institution offers degree programs online, on campus, or both, is irrelevant when it comes to accreditation. They answer to the same governing organizations that ensure students receive a quality education.\n\nWhat Is National Institutional Accreditation?\n\nNational accreditation agencies focus on accrediting trade and vocational schools, as well as career programs that offer certifications and degrees.\n\nThere are several recognized national accreditation agencies, including:\n\nDistance Education & Training Council (DETC)\n\nAccrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC)\n\nCouncil on Occupational Education (COE)\n\nTransnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, Accreditation Commission (TRACS)\n\nAccrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACCET)\n\nAssociation for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE)\n\nAssociation of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools (AARTS)\n\nCouncil on Occupational Education (COE)\n\nDistance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC)\n\nNational Accrediting Commission of Career Arts and Sciences (NACCS)\n\nAccrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS)*\n\n*In 2016, ACICS lost its recognition as an accrediting agency. In April 2018, the USDOE temporarily reinstated its recognition while it conducts further review of ACICS.\n\nWhat Is Regional Institutional Accreditation?\n\nRegional accreditation agencies oversee institutions that place a focus on academics that are state-owned or non-profit colleges or universities. There are six regional accrediting agencies for higher education institutions in the U.S. These agencies oversee institutions within their particular clusters of states.\n\nThe six agencies are:\n\nMiddle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE)\n\nNY, NJ, PA, DE, MD, Washington D.C.\n\nNew England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC)\n\nCT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT\n\nNorthwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)\n\nAK, ID, MT, NV, OR, UT, WA\n\nHigher Learning Commission (HLC)\n\nAR, AZ, CO, IO, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, ND, NE, OH, OK, NM, SD, WI, WV, WY\n\nSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)\n\nFL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, SC, AL, TN, TX, VA\n\nU.S. students in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\n\nWestern Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)\n\nCA, HI\n\nThe Hawaiian territories of Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, the Pacific Rim, East Asia, and parts of the Pacific and East Asia\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between National and Regional Institutional Accreditation?\n\nThere are a few other ways that regionally accredited and nationally accredited institutions differ:\n\nWhat Is Programmatic Accreditation?\n\nThere is a third type of accreditation that prospective students should look for when evaluating institutions: programmatic accreditation—sometimes called “specialized accreditation” or “professional accreditation.”\n\nWhile national and regional accrediting agencies review higher educational institutions as a whole, programmatic accrediting agencies examine individual academic units, programs or disciplinary offerings to ensure they are providing students with a quality education in a particular area of study. Programmatic accreditation is often at the national level since these agencies cover a particular specialty and evaluate all programs nationally within that specialty, such as schools of business, or nursing programs. This type of national programmatic accreditation differs from the national institutional accreditation covered above.\n\nDrexel University is regionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). Many programs available at Drexel also hold national programmatic accreditation, including:\n\nThe nursing programs at Drexel University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE)\n\nDrexel’s LeBow College of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)—a distinction awarded to fewer than 5% of business schools worldwide\n\nDrexel University’s online accredited Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MSLIS) program is fully accredited by the American Library Association (ALA) and is ranked among the top 10 library science programs in the country\n\nWhy Is It Important For My School to Be Accredited?\n\nIf you attend an institution that is not nationally or regionally accredited, it can be a waste of time and money. Making sure your school is accredited is important for a number of reasons that can affect you both now and later, including:\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nStudents cannot receive federal financial aid if they attend an institution that is not regionally or nationally accredited. In order to receive federal financial aid, an institution must be a Title IV-eligible institution. Title IV refers to the section of the Higher Education Act that oversees federal student aid. Institutions deemed Title IV-eligible are qualified by the U.S. Department of Education. Students that attend them are eligible to receive federal student financial aid. Title IV-eligible institutions can be either regionally or nationally accredited.\n\nCredits will not Transfer\n\nIn the event you decide to transfer, your new institution may not accept credits from a non-accredited institution.\n\nImpact on Employment\n\nOver 50% of all employers conduct background checks and confirm the educational credentials of potential employees. Graduating from an accredited institution lets employers know you’ve received your degree from a legitimate institution that has given you the skills needed to succeed in your chosen field.\n\nTransferring Between Regionally and Nationally-Accredited Schools\n\nOver 27.2% of students—roughly 1 in 4—transfer to institutions outside of the state where they began their college journey. Some transfer while they’re still an undergraduate. Others decide to pursue a master’s or doctoral degree at a different institution from where they earned their associates or bachelor’s degree.\n\nIf you’re currently attending a regionally-accredited institution and planning to transfer, credits are easily transferred to other regionally-accredited institutions, even if your new institution is accredited by a different accrediting body than the one where you are currently enrolled. However, credits are often reviewed on a course-by-course basis or by a specific academic department to determine which credits will transfer.\n\nWill I Lose Credits If I Transfer?\n\nIf you’re transferring institutions, it’s possible that you may not lose any credits. However, two-thirds of students do. No matter the accreditation of your former institution, it’s important to speak to a college’s transfer credit evaluator to know where you stand and how many of your credits will transfer. Students transferring for the first time lost an average of 13 semester credit hours — nearly 1/10th of the total amount of semester credits (120) required to graduate with a bachelor’s degree. That’s the equivalent of having to complete an additional semester in order to graduate.\n\nHow Does Transferring Affect Financial Aid?\n\nAs long as the institution they are attending is accredited, students are eligible to apply for federal financial aid. If an institution is not accredited, a student cannot receive federal financial aid. Switching from a nationally accredited to a regionally accredited institution (or vice versa) has no effect on the amount of federal grants or loans a student may receive.\n\nInstitution-based financial aid (such as scholarships) are awarded at the discretion of each college or university and depends on the individual’s need or eligibility.\n\nMaking Sure Your Institution Is Properly Accredited\n\nMaking sure your institution is properly accredited is key to getting the most from your education. Here are some warning signs and actionable tips for ensuring the institution to which you apply, has either national or regional institutional accreditation.\n\nHere’s how you can be sure that your institution is accredited:\n\nCheck for national or regional institutional accreditation\n\nLook at the Department of Education’s Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs (DAPIP) to be sure your institution is listed as either nationally or regionally-accredited.\n\nFind out if your intended career path requires programmatic accreditation:\n\nIf you’re pursuing a career in teaching, business, nursing, or a specialized area, it may benefit you to verify if your institution's degree program is accredited. Consult the CHEA database by either institution and/or program to confirm it’s nationally or regionally-accredited, as well as if it has related programmatic accreditations.\n\nBringing It All Together\n\nNow that you know more about the difference between regionally-accredited and nationally-accredited institutions, continue along the path to ignite your future. Drexel University, regionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, has over 150 online degree and certificate programs — with some that also hold programmatic accreditation, offers students an opportunity to learn from the best, and with the best.
