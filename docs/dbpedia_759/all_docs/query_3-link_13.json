        "text": "QU in DC semesters are open to currently enrolled Quinnipiac juniors and seniors of any major who have maintained a minimum 3.0 GPA and meet their program’s prerequisites for internships. Students have their choice of attending during the spring, summer or fall semesters. In exceptional cases, sophomores in programs that do not have specific internship requirements may petition to apply.\n\nTwo-week seminars in January and May are open to students in any year of college, and are a popular alternative for those who want a taste of DC before committing to a full semester of coursework and an internship. Interested students are advised to start planning and applying in their first year or sophomore year.\n\nStudents pay their regular semester tuition, a program fee and housing. They also are able to transport their financial aid package to D.C. Financial aid applies only in the fall and spring semesters. Students in accelerated programs must pay full tuition/housing.\n\nSpring/Fall: Full time – 15 credits: tuition + $1,230 fee + $7,530 housing fee. A significant number of our students win additional merit-based scholarships.\n\nSummer Semester: 9 credits: tuition + $1,230 fee +$5,589 housing fee. (Certain summer merit scholarships may be available.)\n\nAdditional Costs\n\nAll QU in DC students are responsible for their own transportation to Washington, D.C., as well as groceries, professional wardrobe, public transportation and other expenses.\n\nTuition and fees are subject to annual updates."
