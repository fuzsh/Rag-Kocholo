        "meta_description": "With a student body of about 300, Washington and Lee Law in Lexington, Virginia is easily one of the smallest of the nation's top-tier national law schools. What does that mean for a student's legal education? It means bright, motivated students. It means a student-faculty ratio of 9.8 to 1, and an average class size of 22. It means constant opportunities for meaningful exchange, critical thinking, and mentoring. It means an education respected throughout the legal profession.",
