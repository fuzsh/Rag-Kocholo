        "text": "Twinette Johnson, J.D., Ph.D., dean and professor of law at the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law (UDC Law), has been selected as the next permanent dean of Saint Louis University School of Law. She will succeed William Johnson, J.D., who has served as dean since 2017. Saint Louis University Provost Michael Lewis announced she will assume the role effective July 1, 2024.\n\nDr. Johnson, a former SLU LAW faculty member who earned both her B.A. and Ph.D. degrees at SLU, returns to the University with a distinguished track record of national success and leadership in legal education. She currently serves as the dean and professor of law at UDC Law in Washington, D.C., a position she has held since 2022. Over her seven years at UDC Law, Dr. Johnson also served as interim dean, associate dean for academic affairs, and director of academic success.\n\nDr. Johnson is a national expert in bar exam preparation and focuses her scholarship on higher education access policy, learning theory models in legal education, affinity group formation and identity, and disaster policy.\n\nDr. Johnson began her academic career at the Saint Louis University School of Law over 20 years ago, when she served as the associate professor of legal writing, associate director of bar preparation programs, and also briefly serving as interim director of student activities and leadership. After SLU LAW, she moved on to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale where she served as an associate professor of law and director of academic success.\n\nDr. Johnson’s previous professional experience includes a clerkship on the Missouri Supreme Court with Judge W. Duane Benton. She was also an associate attorney with Shearman and Sterling, LLP, in New York, where she practiced in the Bank Finance group representing financial institutions and corporations in investment grade and non-investment grade financing transactions.\n\nI am humbled by the opportunity to work with the faculty, staff, students, alumni, and larger SLU and Saint Louis communities in leading this great law school in continued excellence.\n\nDr. Twinette Johnson, the next permanent dean of Saint Louis University School of Law\n\nDr. Johnson earned her Ph.D. in Public and Social Policy, with a concentration in Implementation and Management from Saint Louis University; her J.D. from Tulane University School of Law; and her B.A. in English Literature from Saint Louis University.\n\nHer return to St. Louis and the University marks a welcome highlight in her career.\n\n“I am absolutely thrilled to become SLU’s next law dean,” said Dr. Johnson. “SLU LAW’s mission driven commitment to social justice and to the community in which it resides are very attractive to me and I am humbled by the opportunity to work with the faculty, staff, students, alumni, and larger SLU and Saint Louis communities in leading this great law school in continued excellence.”\n\nThroughout her career, Dr. Johnson has served a number of constituencies, most notably students, alumni, her fellow law professors, and staff. During her time at UDC Law, Dr. Johnson implemented strategies to optimize law school operations and ensure financial stability. She also created programs to enhance the law school’s connection to the local community including spearheading a law school sponsored program at the local detention facility. Dr. Johnson has also established a fund to support students facing issues that would interfere with academic pursuits.\n\nOf her appointment, Provost Lewis said, “I am very excited to have Dr. Johnson join our team here at SLU. She will be a transformational leader for the institution and is committed to expand the reach of our Law programs and clinics through innovative programming and student support initiatives. Her focus on academic success, bar preparation, faculty development and DEI initiatives align tightly with SLU's Jesuit Mission.”\n\nDr. Johnson succeeds Dean William Johnson, who has served as dean since January 2017. His tenure marked an emphasis on increasing diversity and equity within the law school community. Under his leadership, the School of Law’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion was expanded, a community council for justice and equity was established, and deepening relationships with affinity bars have led to increased scholarship opportunities for students.\n\n“I could not be more pleased with the selection of Dr. Twinette Johnson as the next permanent dean of this remarkable institution,” said Dean Johnson. “She has an incredible breadth and depth of directly relevant experience, which will position her and the entire law school community for continued success. And her commitment to mission is clear. Under her leadership, the difficult work of seeking justice and equity that this mission-driven law school community has undertaken will flourish. I am so proud to call her my dean, and I look forward to doing everything I can to ensure the best possible transition.”"
