        "text": "We use three parts of The Bluebook to cite Washington State primary law:\n\nThe rule on how to format the cite to the source (e.g., Rule 10 for cases, Rule 12 for statutes, etc.)\n\nTable 1.3's entry for Washington, which lists the sources' publications (e.g., Pacific Reporter for cases)\n\nAbbreviations: Table 10.1 for the state name (Wash.), Table 16.1 for document subdivisions (like an article of the constitution, art.), and Tables 6 and 7 for case and court names\n\nFollowing is where to look in The Bluebook to cite each type of state primary law and some examples. The rules cited and examples are for law journal citations; see The Bluebook's Bluepages and Washington State court rules for guidance on citations in court filings:\n\nWashington Constitution -\n\nBluebook: Rule 11 explains how to cite constitutional provisions and Table 16.1 lists abbreviations for amendment (amend.) and article (art.). Table 10.1 tells us to abbreviate Washington \"Wash.\" No need to check Washington publications in Table 1.3 for this one.\n\nExample: Wash. Const. art. 1, § 5\n\nWashington Court Opinions -\n\nBluebook: Rule 10 lays out how to cite courts' opinions and Table 1.3 > Washington tells us to cite the state's Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions to the Pacific Reporter, gives us the Reporter's abbreviation (P., P.2d, or P.3d, where 2d and 3d indicate the second and third series of Reporter volumes), and reminds us of the court abbreviations (\"Wash.\" for the Supreme Court and \"Wash. Ct. App.\" for the Court of Appeals). As with all case opinions, remember to use Tables 6 and 10 to abbreviate words in case names and see Rule 10.2 for details like when to omit procedural phrases and when not to abbreviate.\n\nExamples:\n\nSupreme Court – Henne v. City of Yakima, 341 P.3d 284 (Wash. 2015) (en banc). This decision was decided by the full court, as indicated by the phrase en banc. Rule 10.6.1 says we can, but are not required to, add information about the weight of the opinion’s authority in a parenthetical after the date.\n\nCourt of Appeals – Blinka v. Wash. State Bar Ass’n, 36 P.3d 1094 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001)\n\nWashington Session Laws -\n\nWait, what are session laws? We usually research statutes in a code, where they are arranged by subject matter. Session laws are a separate, chronological publication of the laws passed by a legislature at a particular legislative session.\n\nBluebook: The Bluebook says in Rule 12.2.1 to cite current statutes to a code. Exceptions for when you instead cite to the session laws publication are listed in Rule 12.2.2. See Rule 12.4 for how to format your session laws cite and Table 1.3 > Washington for the session laws publication name and abbreviation (Wash. Sess. Laws).\n\nExamples:\n\nLife Settlements Act, 2009 Wash. Laws 657.\n\nAct of Apr. 30, 2019, 2019 Wash. Laws 1017. The “date of enactment” mentioned in Bluebook Rule 12.4(a) generally is the date the Governor approved the law. It is noted at the end of the session law’s text.\n\nWashington Statutes -\n\nBluebook: Rule 12 explains citing statutes. Rule 12.3 shows how to cite current statutes to the hard copy official and unofficial code publications, and Table 1.3 > Washington lists the abbreviated names of the publications. Rule 12.5 shows how to cite current statutes to electronic databases like Lexis and Westlaw.\n\nExamples:\n\nRule 12.3 (hard copy) –\n\nWash. Rev. Code Ann.§ 27.04.010 (LexisNexis 2017) (2017 is the date on the spine of this volume of the Code)\n\nWash. Rev. Code Ann.§ 27.04.045 (LexisNexis Supp. 2021) (this provision was amended in 2020, after the Code volume was published and its current text appears in the softcover supplement to the volume)\n\nRule 12.5 (electronic database) – Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 27.04.045 (West, Westlaw Edge through 2021 Sess.) (the date tells how recently Westlaw’s database has been updated and can be found by scrolling to the very end of the statutory provision’s text and by clicking the “currentness” link under the provision’s title)\n\nWashington Regulations -"
