        "text": "Courses\n\nOne of the law school's great strengths is the richness and diversity of its curriculum. It offers students the opportunity to sample a broad array of areas of the law with more than 275 elective courses offered each year. In addition to introductory-level and more advanced courses in a variety of fields, some highly specialized areas of the curriculum allow students to gain considerable expertise. These specialized areas include international law, environmental law, intellectual property law, and government regulation and constitutional law.\n\nThe courses of instruction are described below. The number of hours of credit given for the satisfactory completion of a course is indicated in parentheses after the name of the course. Thus, an academic-year course with two hours of credit each semester is marked (2–2) and a semester course with two hours of credit is marked (2). Some courses are offered for variable credit hours and are marked (2 or 3) or (3 or 4). Each semester’s class schedule will indicate the number of hours for which the course is being offered. The method by which students will be evaluated in the course is indicated at the end of each course description. For upper-level courses where examination is a method of evaluation, faculty have the option to elect either an examination, take-home examination, or another permissible option. Students should always consult the instructor’s course syllabus to confirm the method of evaluation and related details, particularly when more than one instructor is indicated in the course description. Not all courses are offered each year. Students should consult the schedule of classes to determine whether a course is offered in any given semester or summer session.\n\nCourse Updates and Additions\n\nFor updates and additions to the Bulletin course listing, please view the Bulletin supplement for each semester.\n\nCourse Categories\n\nRequired Courses for JD Students\n\n6202 - Contracts (4)\n\nDodge, Gabaldon, Morant, B.
