Washington University School of Law is one of the top private law schools in the region.

It offers a low student-to-faculty ratio and a small first-year section size. It has a beautiful campus as well, ranked as one of the best by preLaw magazine.

“We’ve made an incredible commitment to customize the whole process for our students,” said Dean Nancy Staudt. “Let’s face it, they all don’t come in wanting the same thing across the board. Some plan to practice corporate law in New York; others want to study public interest law and intern with conflict resolution organizations in South Africa or at The Hague. We’re offering a much more nuanced curriculum and an increasing number of professional practice experiences.”

Washington University is highly selective, with high LSAT and GPA scores. It also has a high list price, at more than $57,000, but grants bring the net tuition to less than half of that.

It boasts the highest law employment rate in the Upper Midwest. That helped the school earn honors as a best-value private law school in the nation, with top academic programs in the country.

Finally, the school has one of the oldest moot court programs in the country.

“There’s such an incredible excitement that revolves around not just the curriculum,” Staudt said. “We have a community that is so committed. For me, I find that very unusual because law schools can be very traditional, so we’ve retained what’s great but moved into something so beautiful.”
