        "text": "On a day which saw Christian Miller squarely focused on securing his place on the U.S. Olympic team, he was being stalked by a camera.\n\nAt least, he thinks he was.\n\nIt was this past Sunday, and after a nervy first round of action in the men's 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials, Miller was attempting to make final that night.\n\nA production group from Netflix was tracking the likes of Noah Lyles, Gabby Thomas and Sha'Carri Richardson for the upcoming documentary 'Sprint.'\n\nSubscribe To FloTrack To Watch More Track & Field Meets All Year Long\n\nCheck out full coverage of the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials\n\nSadie Engelhardt picks up Gatorade's National POY honor\n\nThe Youngest Athletes At The U.S. Olympic Trials? These High Schoolers\n\nMaybe Miller will provide a cameo?\n\n\"When I was doing my warm-up, there was someone who was following me back and forth,\" Miller said. \"There was a guy, he was doing this camera work. He was laying on the ground, trying to get a shot.\"\n\nPressure aside, the 18-year-old Floridian took care of business, finishing fifth in the men's final at Hayward Field in a time of 9.98 seconds.\n\nThat result will put the high schooler from Jacksonville in a position to secure a relay spot on the American team heading to Paris, though final decisions are reportedly coming on June 30.\n\nNevertheless, it was a fitting performance from the American teenager, who was one of the country's top performers across the spring season. The Creekside High School graduate finished his year with three wind-legal performances under 10 seconds and another wind-assisted result.\n\nOn Friday, Gatorade named Miller its National Player of the Year for his exploits.\n\n\"Next steps,\" Miller said, \"stay ready.\"\n\nMiller's season was one for the ages. He secured an American under-20 record at 100 meters with his best of 9.93 seconds from May, while also adding a wind-assisted 200 meter effort of 20.15w.\n\n\"My name has been now stamped with one of those really memorable ones,\" Miller said. \"In a couple years, when they're talking about Gatorade athletes or track and field athletes, people who have made impacts, I know my name will come up now. It's all in God's plan.\"\n\nA year ago, he won a U.S. U20 title in the 100m on this very track in Eugene, producing a time of 10.06 that was among the five-best performances all-time.\n\nPerhaps Miller was itching to enter into historic company.\n\nHis effort of 9.93 still stands as the fifth-fastest American performance right now and ninth-best in the world.\n\nAs it stands, it should also go down as a high school national record due to the retroactive decision by the Athletics Integrity Unit to strike Issam Asinga's 9.89 from the record last year -- the former Montverde Academy star was issued a ban on the sport in May for four years after it was found he used a prohibitive substance.\n\n\"I really feel like I've stamped my name with the world's best, even at the age of 18,\" Miller said. \"It's one of the top 10 fastest times in the world. It's definitely something that I've always dreamed of having.\"\n\nMiller's final season in a Creekside jersey was short. He raced just a few times in total, opting against competing in individual events at the FHSAA Regional or State Championships -- though he did run a 4x400 leg at states.\n\nMiller opened his season with a wind-assisted time of 10.14w at the Florida Relays. He set a Franklin Field record at the distance in June at New Balance Nationals, clocking a time of 9.95, but then skipped the final.\n\nAt the U.S. Trials, Miller pocketed times of 10.22, 9.94w and 9.98.\n\nWhile Miller is signed with the University of Georgia, he did comment during his run of results in Eugene about the possibility of altering on that decision.\n\n\"I've had a couple of those conversations,\" he said.\n\nWhether Miller makes the Olympic team or not, he said, his vision is toward 2028 in Los Angeles. Miller will be 22 at that point.\n\nHis dreams are going to morph toward what's possible then.\n\n\"We'll see what crazy achievements and what other runs will have the world confused and the other half surprised,\" Miller said.\n\nThen again, maybe the world might get an early glimpse of the country's top high schooler at 100 meters in Paris.\n\nBy then, those cameras will definitely be filming.\n\nGatorade National AOY Winners Since 2000:\n\n2023: Issam Asinga\n\n2022: Cade Flatt\n\n2021: Hobbs Kessler\n\n2020: Nico Young\n\n2019: Matthew Boling\n\n2018: Anthony Schwartz\n\n2017: Mondo Duplantis\n\n2016: Michael Norman\n\n2015: Michael Norman\n\n2014: Trentavis Friday\n\n2013: Trayvon Bromell\n\n2012: Abraham Hall\n\n2011: Gunnar Nixon\n\n2010: Sam Crouser\n\n2009: Curtis Beach\n\n2008: German Fernandez\n\n2007: Bryshon Nellum\n\n2006: David Klech\n\n2005: Ryan Whiting\n\n2004: Jason Richardson\n\n2003: Kerron Clement\n\n2002: Brendan Christian\n\n2001: Alan Webb\n\n2000: Donald Sage Jr.\n\nFloTrack Is The Streaming Home For Many Track And Field Meets Each Year\n\nDon't miss all of the track & field action streaming on FloTrack.
