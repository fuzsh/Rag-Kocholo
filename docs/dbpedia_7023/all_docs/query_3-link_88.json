        "text": "Many of you, I guess, have attended the speech by Jerry Seinfeld at the 2024 Duke University commencement. I found it awesome and insightful. Here are some takeaways. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did: 1. Humor as a Lifeline: Humor is not just a luxury but an essential tool for navigating life. It's like a \"Stanley Cup water bottle on the brutal, long hike of life.\" 2. Managing Expectations: Life rarely unfolds exactly as planned, and it's essential to adapt and find humor in unexpected twists and turns. 3. Privilege and Responsibility: Use your privilege wisely and find fulfillment in your journey, rather than just focusing on the destination. Remember: Work hard, pay attention, love everything, and don't focus on having but becoming. üéìüåü https://lnkd.in/d_zwgwnk\n\nThought for Thursday - It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves. Sir Edmund Hillary This insightful quote serves as a reminder that our most significant challenges and victories are internal. The mountains we face are mere reflections of our personal obstacles, fears, and limitations. When we conquer ourselves, we gain the strength, confidence, and wisdom to overcome anything that life puts in our path. https://lnkd.in/eGgrrZjm\n\nSt. Germain: Action Against the Dark in Accord with Plan April 23, 2024 by Steve Beckow Saint Germain, ‚ÄúSt. Germain Update,‚Äù 26 Sept. 2008, through Mike Quinsey at https://lnkd.in/g3-ZgjWM. Is it not in some ways a paradox that when the going gets tough, you the people are galvanized into action? You are born survivors, and through many lifetimes have confronted the dark forces and sown the seeds of victory. It has taken a long time to reach your present position, and appropriately it comes when you are on the verge of your greatest achievement in this present cycle. It is in accordance with the plan of the High Councils and Elohim for the destiny of Earth and its people. What appears simply a physical confrontation is in fact occurring on a number of different levels and you are lifting yourselves up, and driving the dark forces back until they will eventually leave your vibration. What a glorious future awaits you as you take your place amongst the ascended Beings, having achieved your own Ascension.\n\nüéì Listening to commencement speeches has always been a source of inspiration for me, and Jerry Seinfeld's address at Duke University was no exception. Jerry shared some real gems in his speech, which are worth reflecting on: 1. Pursue fascination: Instead of stressing about finding a passion, focus on what fascinates you. This perspective can lead to a more fulfilling journey. 2. Humor is necessary: Life can be challenging, so lighten up! Humor can be a vital tool in navigating life and if we worry too much about the discomfort we can miss the opportunity to muse about the insanity of humanity. 3. Seek out a cool job: Trust that the money will follow if you're doing something you find cool and interesting. 4. Love your work: If you find love in what you do, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. There is so much more in this speech--check it out here and share your favorite commencement speaches with me in the comments. https://lnkd.in/eNFy4Fxf #CommencementWisdom #CareerJourney #JerrySeinfeld #LifeAdvice #LoveAndWork #HumorInLife #Inspiration\n\nDear Youth, In the vast expanse of our potential, no aspiration is too grand, no ambition too humble. Each dream, a beacon illuminating the path to our fullest selves. Yet, amidst the boundless horizons of possibility, it is the magnitude of our minds that determines the breadth of our journey. For when we transcend the confines of doubt and limitation, impossibility fades into insignificance, mere syllables in the lexicon of our conquests. Let us not be constrained by the narrow confines of conventional thought, but instead, let our imaginations soar to realms yet unexplored. Dear youth, envision the loftiest peaks, for it is in daring to dream without bounds that we uncover the extraordinary within ourselves. Let us chart courses beyond the horizon, where the impossible becomes but a fleeting notion in the wake of our relentless pursuit of greatness. May our minds be vast and our visions limitless, for it is in the realm of boundless possibility that we shall etch our mark upon the annals of history. Together, let us shatter the barriers of the ordinary and usher forth a new era of extraordinary achievement.\n\nüåû‚ÄùI wish you all a good start into this new week.‚Äùüåû Quote of the day: ‚ÄúWhat we plant in the soil of contemplation, we shall reap in the harvest of action.‚Äù (Meister Eckhart) üëâAlways be aware that the quality of our actions depends greatly on the quality of our thoughts and reflections. üëâBy investing time in contemplation, introspection, and planning, we are essentially planting seeds in the soil of our minds. üëâBy cultivating positive and constructive thoughts, we increase the likelihood of reaping an abundant harvest of meaningful actions and outcomes. üî• By being mindful of what we plant in the soil of contemplation, we can better ensure that our actions align with our values, goals, and aspirations.üî•\n\nThere was a time when I raised an eyebrow to Temple University's historic motto Perseverantia Vincit, or ‚Äú#Perseverance Conquers‚Äù ....it sounded like so much effort - to \"perservere.\" Not glamorous. Not fluid. Not in flow. Not cool. Instead, the word has the feeling of grittiness, of uncomfortable effort, of striving through the muck and brambles that life throws in your way. Is this what we want to amplify, I thought? The difficulty, the effort, the slog of getting up that mountain in that quest for knowledge and impact? How silly I was. For a moment, I had forgotten that making the #impact that you want to make, the #contribution that you must give to the world, fullfilling your #purpose by doing #meaningful work with real #value --- These things ***require*** #grit: perserverence, great effort, and a dash of #passion (dare I say it) üî• In 1888, when Russell Conwell founded Temple University, an urban, public university in North Philadelphia, he had it right: To perservere takes courage. To keep climbing that mountain takes great effort. To push past the obstacles takes hope. To perservere against the odds takes vulnerability. To believe in yourself takes faith. To all of those who are experiencing a moment of doubt: take heart. Perserverence Conquers. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm a believer."
