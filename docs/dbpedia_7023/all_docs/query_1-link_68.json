        "text": "After five seasons at Alabama, Christian Miller is likely to be selected in the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\nOver the course of his college football career, Miller tallied 56 tackles and 11 sacks as a linebacker.\n\nNFL.com currently projects Miller as a third or fourth round pick.\n\nHere are a few things to know about Miller before he joins a pro team later this month.\n\nHe was quite the entrepreneur as a kid\n\nWhen he was in middle school, Miller would buy and sell dirt bikes and scooters, he told the Sporting News.\n\nAnd at age 14, Miller saved up enough money from selling scooters and bikes to purchase a car.\n\nMiller then started fixing the cars and selling them for a profit. By the time he graduated college, Miller he had gone through close to 10 vehicles.\n\nChristian Miller's dad, Corey Miller played in the NFL\n\nAt times while playing for Alabama, Miller looked like he was born to play football.\n\nThat assessment makes more sense considering his dad, Corey, was an NFL player.\n\nCorey Miller carved out an eight year career — as a linebacker with the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings — from 1991-99.\n\nCorey, like his son Christian, also played his college ball in the SEC, attending South Carolina.\n\nChristian Miller is an avid multimedia editor\n\nIf Miller ever decides that football isn't for him, he seems like he could fall back on a career in photo and video editing.\n\nIn an interview with Sporting News, Miller mentioned an \"Undertaker-themed video\" he edited ahead of his return from a biceps injury.\n\nThe video was a hit with fans, garnering more than 143,000 views on Twitter.\n\nMore recently, Miller put together a video from Alabama's Pro Day in March.\n\nMore Alabama football news"
