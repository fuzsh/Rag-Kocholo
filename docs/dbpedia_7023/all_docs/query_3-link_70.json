        "text": "Christian Miller took home the Gatorade National Boys Track & Field Player of the Year honor this week, a fantastic finish for the record-setting sprinter.\n\nThe Sunshine State standout was surprised with the prominent award surrounded by his family, coaches, and teammates at Creekside High School (St. Johns, Fla.).\n\nAnother track sensation to join the list of past winners—who boast a combined trophy case of more than 19 gold medals and 14 national championships—Miller was certainly worthy of the iconic hardware, which more than half a million other student-athletes were in the running for.\n\n“Christian Miller officially broke the national high school record at 100 meters this spring, but it certainly appears there’s more left in the tank based upon his performances at the Olympic Trials,” noted Rich Gonzalez, editor of PrepCalTrack.com., in a statement. “The rhythmic power he harnesses is extremely unique for a teenage sprinter. His skill set is beginning to remind folks of a one-time prep prodigy named Noah Lyles—yes, the same Noah Lyles that has since won six world championship medals. Miller’s career is going places and he’s getting there faster than any before him.”\n\nMiller’s achievements of the track carried just as much weight as his impressive Gold medal-worthy accolades on it, with the Georgia Bulldogs commit turrning the spotlight on his work volunteering for the River Rock Church community and coaching youth club teams.\n\nMost impressive?\n\nHe maintained a B average in the classroom while doing all of it, from setting world records on the track to helping coach younger athletes on the St. John’s Striders track team.\n\n“Gatorade Players of the Year are not only world-class athletes, but they’re also motivated to succeed in the classroom and be leaders in their communities,” said Gatorade president and general manager Michael Del Pozzo, of Miller’s overall resume. ”Christian embodies all those qualities tenfold, and we’re proud to welcome him into the Gatorade Player of the Year family.”\n\n(Gatorade Player of the Year/Joe Greer)"
