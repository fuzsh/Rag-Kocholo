        "text": "The Marshall Project and ProPublica have been awarded a prestigious George Polk Award for their joint project, An Unbelievable Story of Rape.\n\nIt was August when Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project and T. Christian Miller of ProPublica discovered they were working on different ends of the same story: an 18-year-old Washington state woman who had reported being raped at knifepoint only to be disbelieved by police and later prosecuted for lying to them. Years later, two relentless Colorado detectives, both women, arrested a serial rapist and were able to connect the case back to the original victim, who was finally believed.\n\nRather than trying to scoop each other, the two news organizations teamed up to write a braided narrative that is both a police procedural and a heartbreaking human story. Several law enforcement agencies requested permission to use “An Unbelievable Story of Rape” as part of training programs. The Washington police department that mishandled the initial investigation commended the authors’ even-handed approach.\n\nThis marks the first George Polk Award for The Marshall Project. “An Unbelievable Story of Rape” was also a National Magazine Award finalist."
