        "text": "Christian Miller has over fourteen years of experience handling tax controversies. Prior to joining the firm, Christian worked as an attorney for the Comptroller of Maryland. His legal experience with that agency includes managing both the individual income tax audit section and the corporate amended unit in the Revenue Administration Division. He also has over five years of experience resolving tax controversies for the Comptroller of Maryland as a hearing officer in the Hearings and Appeals Section.\n\nAlthough my husband and I worked with several lawyers over a number of years due to a difficult case, we most recently worked with Christian Miller. Christian encouraged open communication at all times so we had a mutual understanding of all case related documents, laws, regulations and options of resolution. He was also prompt in responding to any of our questions or concerns. His case management and advisement during a difficult process resulted in his successful negotiations and a very positive outcome for us. We are very thankful for the opportunity to have had Christian represent us and highly recommend him to others. We would give him a â5 Starâ rating!"
