        "text": "Each year, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation awards two distinguished journalism prizes, one for reporting on the Presidency and the other for reporting on National Defense. These prizes, initiated in 1988, recognize reportorial excellence and the fostering of better public understanding of the presidency and national defense. Each year the two prizes are presented to the winners at a reception and event in Washington, D.C. and include a $5,000 award, one for each prize.\n\nThe Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation sponsors the Gerald R.
