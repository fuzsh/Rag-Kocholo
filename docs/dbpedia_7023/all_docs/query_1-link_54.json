Sometimes trauma doesn’t look the way you think it should.', 'Research shows the more intimate the crime, the more people focus on the victim’s behavior, and of course, there’s no crime more intimate than sexual violence,” Archambault says.', and 'She knew that the universe of women who had been raped looked identical to the universe of women. They could be mothers, teens, sex workers. They could live in mansions or in flophouses. They could be homeless or suffer from schizophrenia. They could be black or white or Asian. They could be passed out drunk or completely sober. And they could react to the crime in all kinds of ways. They could be hysterical. Or withdrawn. They could tell a friend, or they could tell no one. They might call the cops right away, or they might wait a week, a month, even years.'",

And they could react to the crime in all kinds of ways. They could be hysterical. Or withdrawn. They could tell a friend, or they could tell no one.

Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“he wrote of his opposition toward harsh punishment for rape, “on account of the temptation women would be under to make it the instrument of vengeance against an inconstant lover, and of disappointment to a rival.” The man who had authored the Declaration of Independence was writing to the man who would author the Bill of Rights—to warn of the woman scorned, crying rape.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“Galbraith had her own rule when it came to rape cases: listen and verify. “A lot of times people say, ‘Believe your victim, believe your victim,’ ” Galbraith says. “But I don’t think that that’s the right standpoint. I think it’s listen to your victim. And then corroborate or refute based on how things go.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“A police interview is non-accusatory. It is an act of gathering information. An interrogation is accusatory. It is an act of persuasion. “An interrogation is conducted only when the investigator is reasonably certain of the suspect’s guilt,” according to Essentials of the Reid Technique: Criminal Interrogation and Confessions.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“End Violence Against Women International, the police training organization, has suggested that the most important factor in talking with victims is the engagement of the investigators. “What is absolutely clear is that an officer’s competence and compassion are far more important than gender in determining their effectiveness at interviewing sexual assault victims,” the organization emphasizes.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“The Playboy Foundation provided $10,000—and the use of Playboy’s offices as an assembly line, where volunteers, mostly senior citizens, were provided with foldout tables and free coffee and sandwiches while building the first of these revolutionary kits. “I took a lot of flak from the women’s movement—but too bad,” Goddard says. “If it was Penthouse or Hustler, no. But Playboy? Please, give me a break.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, Unbelievable: The shocking truth behind the hit Netflix series\n\n“Research had shown that rapists were far more likely than murderers to be serial offenders. Studies had found that between one-fourth to two-thirds of rapists committed multiple sexual assaults. Only about 1 percent of murderers were considered serial killers.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“From 2009 to 2014, the Baltimore County Police Department dismissed 34 percent of rape allegations as false or baseless. The percentage itself was troubling enough. More troubling yet was how it was reached. The department often deep-sixed complaints without even taking the elemental step of having a sex crimes detective interview the alleged victim, a BuzzFeed News investigation found.”\n\n― T. Christian Miller, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America\n\n“In 2016, the sheriff in Bingham County, Idaho, told a local television station: “The majority of our rapes—not to say we don’t have rapes, we do—but the majority of our rapes that are called in, are actual consensual sex.”\n\n― T.
