        "text": "Management\n\nU.S. Marine Corps Concludes Its Investigation Into a Fatal 2018 Midair Crash Was Inaccurate\n\nA new review reexamined the December 2018 crash after a ProPublica investigation revealed that Marines had been deprived of adequate training and equipment, and that their repeated pleas for help from superiors before the crash went unaddressed.\n\nManagement\n\nAfter Discovering a Sailor With Coronavirus, the U.S. Navy Crowded Dozens Into One Space\n\nOn the USS Boxer, where the Navy discovered its first case of coronavirus on a ship, a sailor says his superiors called a meeting that crammed more than 80 senior enlisted sailors and officers together.\n\nDefense\n\nWarship Accidents Left Sailors Traumatized. The Navy Struggled to Treat Them.\n\nRecent wars have forced the U.S. military to acknowledge and treat the psychological wounds caused by trauma. But some sailors who survived 2017’s deadly crashes say the Navy’s efforts to help them sometimes fell short.\n\nDefense\n\nIran Has Hundreds of Naval Mines. U.S. Navy Minesweepers Find Old Dishwashers and Car Parts.\n\nAs tensions heat up in the Persian Gulf, the Navy’s minesweeping fleet may once again be called into action, but its sailors say the ships are too old and broken to do the job. “We are essentially the ships that the Navy forgot.”\n\nDefense\n\nTrump Keeps Talking About the Last Military Standoff With Iran — Here’s What Really Happened\n\nIn 2016, 10 sailors were captured by Iran. Trump is making it a political issue. Our investigation shows that it was a Navy failure, and the problems run deep.\n\nDefense\n\nHow the Navy’s Top Commander Botched the Highest-Profile Investigation in Years\n\nThe Navy said it was abandoning all remaining criminal charges against sailors involved in fatal accidents in the Pacific. Here’s how the actions of the chief of naval operations helped doom the cases.\n\nManagement\n\nIf Trump’s Border Wall Becomes Reality, Here’s How He Could Easily Get Private Land for It\n\nA law is supposed to protect property owners from lowball offers by the government when it takes land through eminent domain. But a letter shows how simple it is for officials to eviscerate what is already a pretty toothless law.\n\nDefense\n\nAn Admiral Told a Senator Most Navy Reforms Were 'Complete.' Navy’s No. 2 Says Otherwise.\n\nAdm. Bill Moran told ProPublica this week that none of the promised reforms had been completed, but that work had started on the pledges.\n\nDefense\n\nNavy Promised Changes After Deadly Accidents, but Many Within Doubt It’s Delivering on Them\n\nInterviews and an examination of the Navy’s publicly announced reforms raise uncertainty over whether senior leaders have fully followed through on them after the 7th Fleet disasters in 2017."
