        "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Christian Miller knows that opponents are coming for him.\n\nGood luck catching the Creekside sprinting star.\n\nA reigning state champion, Miller aimed to elevate his track prowess during his junior season. He not only did that, repeating his state championship in the 200, Miller added a gold in the 100 and then racked up a pair of national titles after that.\n\nThe target that was on Miller, the All-News4JAX boys track and field athlete of the year, was big before the season began. Now, it’s going to be even larger in 2024. He somehow managed to upstage even a double-medal performance with a blistering summer showing that has put Miller on the fast track to stardom.\n\nNot that he minds.\n\nMiller relishes the competition aspect and knows that the faster he goes, the faster the opponents will come after him. He doesn’t plan on letting anyone get too close though.\n\n“Knowing that people are coming out and trying to improve and trying to catch me since I was at the top last year [is a challenge]. Just knowing I have to continue to come out and execute and just not let up,” Miller said. “And even though I was the first last year I still had to come out and compete even harder if I wanted to be first again.”\n\nMiller’s rise in the sport has happened quickly. He ran with the St. Johns Striders during his middle school years, then tried to do a football-track double as a freshman at Creekside. But Miller suffered a significant injury (a torn patella tendon in his right knee) and missed just about his entire first year competing in high school. That injury also steeled Miller’s resolve.\n\n“I’d say when it first happened, I was frustrated and I was mad. Like, ‘Why is this happening to me? Why can I just get through my freshman season?’ But then as it went on, I saw it as just an obstacle that I needed to work harder and get through,” Miller said. “So, I just kept going through rehab and going through training, getting my right leg stronger, back to where it was on my left leg, and just coming back stronger than ever.”\n\nMiller said that his first inclination that he was back and healthy and poised for something special came in his first race of his sophomore season. He expected to turn in a time in the 11s in the 100, but he clocked a 10.8. That set in motion a state championship season that he only enhanced in 2023.\n\nMiller was a beast in the 200, his signature event. He won all five high school races in his junior season. His improvement in the 100 was even greater. Miller finished fourth in the state meet last year with a 10.69. He went 10.31 to win the 100 in the 4A state championship last May.\n\nBut Miller’s best work has come this summer, where he’s added titles at the prestigious New Balance Nationals and the USATF U20 Championships.\n\nNot that Miller wasn’t a well-known athlete before the summer. Three titles in a state that has produced some superb sprinters tends to do that. But Miller’s performances in Eugene, Oregon this month pushed him to another level.\n\nHis time of 10.06 didn’t just win Miller the U20 event, it ranks as the fifth-fastest wind-legal time ever by a high school athlete. Only Trentavis Friday (10.0), Jeffery Demps (10.01) and Edorian McCullough and Jelani Watkins (both 10.02) have posted faster times as high schoolers than Miller.\n\nAll-News4JAX boys track and field first team\n\nEvent, Athlete, School, Class\n\n100: Christian Miller, Creekside, Jr.\n\nRan season-low of 10.22 at the Florida Relays.
