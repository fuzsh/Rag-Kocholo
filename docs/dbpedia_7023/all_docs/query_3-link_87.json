        "text": "Now you see Christian Miller. Now you don't.\n\nIn the time it takes the average reader to digest this paragraph, the fleet feet of the Creekside senior can flash from the starting blocks clear across a football field's length to the finish line of the 100-meter dash. All with time to spare.\n\nThe Creekside senior, crowned the Times-Union's All-First Coast high school boys track and field athlete of the year for the second season running, is now ready for the global stage after electrifying Florida's tracks for the past three seasons.\n\nOn April 20, while still a month before his 18th birthday, Miller hit the magic number of 9.93 in the men's 100 at the Pure Athletics Spring Invitational in Clermont, west of Orlando.\n\nThe number: the fastest time in the world so far in 2024. Regardless of country. Regardless of age.\n\n\"It was a great feeling, knowing I just rewrote history,\" Miller said in a phone interview with the Times-Union from a training session in preparation for the New Balance Outdoor Nationals in Philadelphia. \"I felt like I've set the bar for all the younger athletes after me.\"\n\nIf he surpasses another personal best this month at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore., where he's qualified for both the 100 and 200, Miller could be punching his ticket for the Olympics later this summer in Paris.\n\nAnd if he does it again in Paris, who knows?\n\nSixty years after Jacksonville native Bob Hayes outran the speediest sprinters from around the planet to become the world's fastest man at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, another Northeast Florida product is setting his sights on sprint gold.\n\n\"He believes he can do stuff that was unfathomable,\" Creekside coach Ricky Fields said.\n\nSprinting to the top\n\nNo. 1 in the world has already blown away all expectations for Miller in the spring of 2024, even after his outstanding 2023 season that catapulted him to the top of the high school track scene in both the recruiting rankings — he signed with Georgia in November as the No. 1 recruit nationwide — and in pure, raw times.\n\n\"He's physically getting stronger, and he's gotten mentally tougher,\" Fields said.\n\nFor Miller, the key was simple enough: Never slow down.\n\n\"A lot of high school runners can run really fast one year and they can't come back and replicate it,\" he said. \"My goal was to come back and make it even bigger.\"\n\nMiller not only won last year's Florida High School Athletic Association Class 4A sprints in blistering times (10.31 in the 100, 20.57 in the 200) but followed up with record-setting feats in the summer.\n\nHe won the 200 at the New Balance Nationals Outdoor in 20.45, and then swept the sprints at the USA Track & Field U20 Championships in Oregon with times of 20.51 in the 200 and 10.06 — an all-time wind-legal record for a high school junior — in the 100.\n\nEven after those accomplishments, sub-10 wasn't on the agenda, at least not yet. Fields, who coaches Miller with both Creekside and the St. Johns Striders club, said the sprinter had targeted a 100-meter mark of 10.05, which would place him inside the cutoff for Olympic Trials qualification.\n\n\"I thought he had it in him because of how the practices, but everything had to be right,\" Fields said.\n\nInstead, on a memorable evening at the Pure Athletics Spring Invitational in Clermont, Miller broke from the blocks and never slowed down. Instead of four digits, the scoreboard showed three: 9.93.\n\n\"We felt he had won it, racing against pros, and we were ecstatic,\" Fields said. \"Then three seconds later it comes up 9.93, and it takes it to another level.\"\n\nFor some perspective, a time of 9.93 would have won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and would have placed fourth in the finals of each of the last two Olympic finals.\n\nWhile Miller hadn't specifically planned for 9.93 in Clermont, he said his confidence was already high entering the meet.\n\n\"I knew I had to go out and execute and put everything I had into that race,\" he said. \"I knew a special time could happen.\"\n\nPracticing for Paris\n\nFor Miller, Creekside is just the beginning.\n\nLike hundreds of his classmates, Miller spent the afternoon of May 18 walking in cap and gown to receive his diploma during graduation at the University of North Florida. Only a few hours after the arena emptied, he swapped that cap and gown for running gear and ended his evening anchoring the Knights' 4x400-meter relay at the FHSAA championships about a block away at Hodges Stadium.\n\nWhile many others were planning summertime trips for fun in the sun, Miller was already counting down to the biggest meet of his life.\n\nHis spring schedule flipped upside down the moment that he ran 9.93. Rather than focusing his attention on an FHSAA meet where he already owned three first-place medals, and likely would have won going away in his hometown in both the 100 and 200, Miller placed most of his high school events on hold — relays were an exception — to prepare for Olympic dreams.\n\nNearly every step over the last two months has advanced toward one goal: reaching peak speed in time for the Olympic Trials beginning Friday at Hayward Field in Oregon, and potentially for the Olympics in Paris from July 26 to Aug. 11. No American 18-year-old has qualified for a men's Olympic final in the 100 since 1976, when Johnny (Lam) Jones placed sixth in Montreal on his way to an NFL career.\n\nMiller's recent itinerary meant a lot of travel — last weekend's New Balance Outdoor Nationals were the latest stop, where Miller ran 9.95 in the semifinal round — and some new experiences.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is just trying to stay consistent,\" he said. \"I've been training well, preparing well, so it's not something that really fazes me.\"\n\nThe potential challengers in Oregon are many: Reigning world 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, 2019 world champion Christian Coleman, Tokyo 100-meter silver medalist Fred Kerley, 200-meter silver medalist Kenny Bednarek and former Stanton star Kendal Williams, the 2014 world junior champion who was also timed at 9.93 in a different meet at Clermont in May.\n\nWhen he hits the track in Oregon, Miller will have plenty of support from close to 3,000 miles away, with Creekside fans already scheduling an Olympic Trials watch party for Saturday night at Island Wing Company in the Bartram Park area.\n\n\"It feels nice to know I have so much support from my hometown,\" he said.\n\nEven if Miller finishes outside the top three in Oregon, there's still a chance he could make the trip to Paris as part of the 4x100 relay squad.\n\nBob Hayes achieved his Olympic dream in 1964. For Miller, his golden opportunity might be coming soon. Maybe in 2032, in Brisbane. Maybe in 2028, in Los Angeles. Maybe sooner than that.\n\n\"My goal is just continuing to go out there in the 100 and stun the world,\" Miller said. \"I have a lot left in the tank.\"\n\nChristian Miller's U.S. Olympic Trials schedule\n\nSaturday, June 22, 9:22 p.m.: 100-meter first round\n\nSunday, June 23, 8:48 p.m.: 100-meter semifinals\n\nSunday, June 23, 10:49 p.m.: 100-meter final\n\nThursday, June 27, 10:33 p.m.: 200-meter first round\n\nFriday, June 28, 10:28 p.m.: 200-meter semifinals\n\nSaturday, June 29, 9:49 p.m.: 200-meter final\n\nAll-First Coast Boys Track & Field Athlete of the Year\n\nChristian Miller\n\nSenior, Creekside\n\nAge: 18"
