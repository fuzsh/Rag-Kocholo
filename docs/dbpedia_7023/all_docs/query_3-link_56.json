        "text": "Book Summary\n\nTwo Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists tell the riveting true story of Marie, a teenager who was charged with lying about having been raped, and the detectives who followed a winding path to arrive at the truth.\n\nOn August 11, 2008, eighteen-year-old Marie reported that a masked man broke into her apartment near Seattle, Washington, and raped her. Within days police and even those closest to Marie became suspicious of her story: details of the crime didn't seem plausible and her foster mother thought she sounded as though she were reciting a Law & Order episode. The police swiftly pivoted and began investigating Marie. Confronted with inconsistencies in her story and the doubts of others, Marie broke down and said her story was a lie - a bid for attention. Police charged Marie with false reporting. One of Marie's best friends created a web page branding her a liar.\n\nMore than two years later, Colorado detective Stacy Galbraith was assigned to investigate a case of sexual assault. Describing the crime to her husband that night - the attacker's calm and practiced demeanor, which led the victim to surmise \"he's done this before\" - Galbraith learned that the case bore an eerie resemblance to a rape that had taken place months earlier in a nearby town. She joined forces with the detective on that case, Edna Hendershot, and the two soon realized they were dealing with a serial rapist: a man who photographed his victims, threatening to release the images online, and whose calculated steps to erase all physical evidence suggested he might be a soldier or a cop. Through meticulous police work the detectives would eventually connect the rapist to other attacks in Colorado - and beyond.\n\nBased on investigative files and extensive interviews with the principals, A False Report is a serpentine tale of doubt, lies, and a hunt for justice, unveiling the disturbing reality of how sexual assault is investigated today - and the long history of skepticism toward rape victims.\n\nMedia Reviews\n\n\"Starred Review. Miller and Armstrong excavate a disturbing strain of misogyny in American culture in this account of the mistreatment of victims of sexual assault in the criminal justice system [A False Report] shines a critical light on an urgent and timely subject.\" - Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Starred Review. The authors describe how [several] cases come together in a highly suspenseful (chapters often end in cliffhangers) and thorough manner that still considers the victims and avoids gratuity This timely, well-researched, highly readable account will appeal to readers interested in true crime and social justice issues.\" - Booklist\n\n\"A riveting and disturbing true-crime story that reflects the enduring atrocity of rape in America.\" - Kirkus\n\n\"A False Report is a reporting triumph: a heartbreaking deep dive into a case gone horribly wrong; a bone-chilling portrait of a monstrous criminal; and a forceful cri de coeur on behalf of those victims whose claims fall on deaf ears. You'll never read another crime story quite like it.\" - Robert Kolker, author of Lost Girls\n\n\"This is a deep, disturbing, compelling, important book. A False Report digs into timeless issues - crime, victimhood, honesty, sexism- which have never been more timely. It is also a fascinating, sharply written story that will twist and surprise you.\" - Susan Orlean, author of The Orchid Thief and Rin Tin Tin\n\n\"America has never adequately addressed sexual violence, a tragedy made worse by many who employ their own hierarchy of victimization, leaving many women and vulnerable people unaided. This meticulously researched, powerful expos√© eliminates ignorance as a defense. This is a devastating but necessary read, composed by masters of investigative journalism.\" - Bryan Stevenson, author of Just Mercy\n\n\"Miller and Armstrong show how gender bias, and the many myths about sexual assault, still have far too much influence in the way law enforcement investigates these crimes...Well-researched and compassionate, A False Report is essential reading for police, prosecutors, and lawmakers, and for all those seeking to do better for victims of sexual assault.\" - Joanne Archambault, CEO of End Violence Against Women International\n\n\"A False Report is a gripping and often devastating tale. By bringing their characters alive, Miller and Armstrong do not judge so much as illuminate the deep sexism that continues to pervade our society's treatment of rape. Better still, the women in this book are strong protagonists as much as victims.\" - Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and CEO of New America; author of Unfinished Business\n\n\"Far too many women and girls who are sexually assaulted never report it - often out of fear they won't be believed. A False Report reveals the true cost of doubting women's accounts of rape. This fascinating, deeply troubling book has the power to spark a national conversation about how our criminal justice system fails victims, and how it can be reformed.\" - Peggy Orenstein, author of Girls & Sex\n\n\"This is a grim, important, meticulously reported book that denounces breakdowns in the system of investigating crimes against women...A False Report has all the detail, drama, and humanity that make the finest nonfiction as compelling as a novel.\" - Sebastian Rotella, author of Rip Crew\n\nThis information about A False Report was first featured in \"The BookBrowse Review\" - BookBrowse's membership magazine, and in our weekly \"Publishing This Week\" newsletter.
