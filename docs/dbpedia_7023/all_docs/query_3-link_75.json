        "text": "________________________________________\n\nThe real-life investigation behind the hit Netflix series, from two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists.\n\nSHORTLISTED FOR THE GOLD DAGGER AWARD\n\nShe said she was raped.\n\nPolice said she lied.\n\nShe was made to retract the report - but the nightmare only got worse.\n\nOn 11 August 2008, eighteen-year-old Marie reported that a masked man had broken into her home and raped her. Within days, police - and even those closest to Marie - became suspicious of her story. Confronted by these minor inconsistencies and doubt, Marie broke down and said her story was a lie. The police charged her with making a false report.\n\nTwo years later, Colorado detective Stacy Galbraith was assigned to a case of sexual assault. It bore an eerie resemblance to a rape that had taken place months earlier in a nearby town. Joining forces with the detective on that case, Edna Hendershot, the two soon discovered they were dealing with a serial rapist. As their investigation deepened, it became clear that numerous police departments had extremely similar cases on their hands - and that Marie's story bore an eerie resemblance to the cases they were investigating.\n\nUnbelievable is a chilling tale of doubt, lies, and the hunt for justice, unveiling the disturbing reality of how sexual assault is investigated and the long history of scepticism toward its victims.\n\n________________________________________\n\nPreviously published as A False Report\n\nT. Christian Miller (Author)\n\nT. Christian Miller joined ProPublica, the non-profit newsroom for investigative journalism, as a senior reporter in 2008.

His first book, Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq, was called one of the indispensable books on the war. He teaches data journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and was a Knight Fellow at Stanford University.\n\nKen Armstrong (Author)\n\nKen Armstrong, joined ProPublica in 2017. He previously worked at the Marshall Project and Chicago Tribune, where his work helped prompt the Illinois governor to suspend executions and empty death row. His first book, Scoreboard, Baby, with Nick Perry, won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Non-Fiction. He has been the McGraw Professor of Writing at Princeton and a Nieman Fellow at Harvard.\n\nBoth T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong have won numerous awards,including a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for their article 'An Unbelievable Story of Rape', on which A False Report is based. The rights to the dramatisationof this story have been acquired by Netflix."
