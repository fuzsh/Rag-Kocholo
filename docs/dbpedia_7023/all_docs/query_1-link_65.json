        "text": "General and cosmetic dentist, Dr. J. Christian Miller has served patients in the Plano and surrounding areas since 1984. He has spent more than 40 years working with his identical twin brother and partner at Miller & Miller Dentistry, Dr. L. Matthew Miller. He works daily, transforming smiles and giving his patients of all ages superior care. Dr. Chris provides all his dental patients with general, cosmetic, and restorative dental procedures in his state-of-the-art dental practice, procedures like 360 veneers, tooth-colored fillings, dental crowns or bridges, ClearCorrect™ aligners, smile makeovers, periodontal disease treatments, sleep apnea/snoring oral appliance therapies, dental implants, and much more with sedation dentistry (if needed).\n\nAs an accomplished, award-winning cosmetic dentist, Dr. Chris strives to be the dentist he would want for his own family’s dental care. Dr. Chris and Dr. Matt have made a commitment to taking the time necessary for each patient to do the right treatments the right way. This philosophy is built on the premise that each patient is treated as an individual — not part of a \"dental assembly line,\" where all patients receive the same treatment. Dr. Chris believes his patients deserve the proper diagnosis and treatment that is best for their needs and never for how much their insurance will or won’t pay in the end."
