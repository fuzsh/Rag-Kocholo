        "text": "Creekside graduate Christian Miller, the fastest high school runner in America during 2024 and a top-five finisher at last week's United States Olympic Trials, is not among the athletes selected for USA Track & Field's relay pool for the Paris Olympics, according to Creekside and St. Johns Striders coach Ricky Fields.\n\nIn a post to Twitter/X, Fields announced late Sunday night that USATF did not select the 18-year-old for the 4x100-meter relay.\n\n\"Very disappointed in USATF @usatf by leaving Christian Miller off the 4x100 relay pool stating he didn’t have experience running 4x100 with pros and didn’t run in World relays which is limited to pros,\" Fields said.\n\nMiller, who was named Gatorade National Player of the Year in boys track and field on Thursday, finished fifth in the 100 at last week's U.S. Olympic Trials in 9.98. Noah Lyles, Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, all of them Olympic medalists from the last Games in Tokyo, automatically earned the three individual slots for the 100 as well as positions on the 4x100 relay.\n\nWhy did Christian Miller miss the Olympic roster?\n\nUnlike USA Swimming, which determines its relay qualifiers purely based on finishing order at the Olympic Trials, USA Track & Field employs a more subjective set of criteria to choose the additional slots for its relay team.\n\nUSATF lists ability to pass and receive the baton with either hand, performance on the turn and straight legs of the 4x100 relay, times recorded in the relevant distances and — significantly, in Miller's case — prior experience in the Olympics, World Championships, World Relays and Pan American Games.\n\nWhile USATF has yet to publicly announce the relay pool for Paris, other potential selections might include former world champion Christian Coleman, who ran fourth in Olympic Trials, as well as Courtney Lindsey (sixth in the Olympic Trials final) and Kyree King (eliminated by less than one hundredth of a second in the semifinal). Both Lindsey and King teamed with Lyles and Bednarek to win the World Relays in May.\n\nA three-time Florida High School Athletic Association champion, Miller has broken the 10-second mark four times since April, including a personal-best 9.93 in Clermont. The top-ranked track and field prospect in the nation as rated by MileSplit, he signed in November with the University of Georgia.\n\nBarring injuries, Miller ranks as a prime early contender for the United States squad at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. By that time, Lyles would be 30 years old, Bednarek 29, Coleman 32 and Kerley 33.\n\nAmericans have won the title of World's Fastest Man in the 100 at both prior editions of the Olympics in Los Angeles, Eddie Tolan in 1932 and Carl Lewis in 1984."
