        "text": "(dramatic music) (camera clicking) (dire music) >> Narrator: This film is dedicated to prisoners of war.\n\nTheir unbroken spirit is the symbol of a moral victory for which no bells have pealed, and which will not be remembered with the battle names on regimental colors.\n\nIt was a war in which no decorations could be given, but to have come out of it with a whole spirit is its highest honor.\n\nThese are a few of those men captured in the summer of 1940.\n\nThey were the men who stood on the Dial, the Somme, and the La Basi Canal, who fought at Calais, April, St. Valery, and the vital perimeter around the Beaches of Dunkirk, the men who held on until the German armor thundered past their lines.\n\n220 miles they marched into captivity, through that blazing, dusty dune, through France, through Belgium, through Holland, to the Rhine.\n\n(lightly dire music) >> Ahh, beer isn't what it used to be.\n\n>> I hope the French beer isn't what it used to be, either.\n\nRemember the last time, Ted?\n\n>> Yeah, I remember something better than beer, too.\n\n>> And the stamina in a rush.\n\nOoh, she was a smasher.\n\nI can see her hair now, blacker than coal.\n\n>> And that savory piece of Lil.\n\nOoh, boy!\n\nShe taught me a thing or two.\n\n>> Pity you kept it to yourself.\n\n>> It's proud we should be married to a couple of Don Juans.\n\n>> Don't believe a girl ever looked at him twice.\n\nPoor old dear.\n\n>> Yes, steady, you looked twice, didn't you?\n\n>> You caught me off me guard.\n\nI was low following the flu.\n\n>> Wonder what made you marry me.\n\n>> You don't know?\n\nAnd that wicked tenor voice you have.\n\n>> Leave them.\n\nThat's me and it'll clear later.\n\n>> Any more for any more?\n\n>> No, thank you.\n\n>> It's nearly 12.\n\nWe've got to be at the depot at 7:00.\n\nCome on home, Dilys.\n\n>> We'll have 'em both back before you can turn round.\n\nWar will be over by Christmas.\n\n>> War will be over by Christmas?\n\nWhere have I heard that before?\n\n>> It's a shame we got to close the business, Ted.\n\n>> Why, it's just habit we've got into, fighting the same war every 20 years.\n\n>> Nasty habit, too.\n\n(everyone laughing) >> Good night, Flo.\n\n>> Good night.\n\n>> Good night, Ted.\n\n>> Good night, love.\n\nSee you in the morning.\n\n>> All right.\n\n>> She's a proper worrier, Dilys.\n\nShame she never had kids.\n\nAnd her always wanting them so much.\n\nThey'd have took her mind off things.\n\n>> Well, it's too late now, I suppose.\n\nAre you sorry Glad and Mary are grown up?\n\n>> Well, I am and I'm not, in a manner of speaking.\n\n>> What about starting all over again, old girl?\n\n>> No, thank you, Ted.\n\nI'm too old for that kind of war work.\n\n(laughing) (light music) (light piano music) >> Thanks, Stephen.\n\nI liked that a lot.\n\n>> The boy definitely shows promise.\n\n>> Nearly 1:00.\n\n>> May I catch a lift?\n\n>> Yes, of course.\n\nCome on, Carol, put your bonnet on.\n\nCheerio, Stephen.\n\nSee you before you embark.\n\n>> Right-o, Robert.\n\n>> Good-bye, Stephen, darling.\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\n>> Good night, darling.\n\n>> Come on kids.\n\n>> Well, wait for me.\n\n>> Stephen.\n\n>> Robert: Come on, Carol!\n\n>> All right, Robert!\n\n>> Caroline.\n\nCaroline!\n\nCaroline!\n\n(car revving) >> Stephen.\n\n>> Caroline.\n\nYou left your scarf.\n\n>> I know.\n\nI had to come back.\n\n>> But Robert, what about him?\n\n>> I wanted to tell you.\n\nIt's all over with Robert.\n\nI think he understands.\n\nI told him three weeks ago.\n\n>> We met three weeks ago.\n\n>> I wasn't sure until tonight.\n\n>> Caroline.\n\n(romantic music) >> You've only 48 hours before you go to France.\n\nIt's nothing and it's everything.\n\n>> Everything.\n\n>> I hope you know how to get a special license.\n\n(tank revving) (horse braying) (horn blaring) >> And don't forget to write, David.\n\n>> Yes, Mum.\n\n>> And let us know if there's anything you want.\n\n>> Thank you, Mrs. McDougall.\n\nWill you write to me, Elspeth?\n\n>> Yes, David, I will.\n\n>> You see, I- (horn blaring) >> Yes, David.\n\n>> Good-bye, David.\n\n>> Good-bye, David, my boy.\n\n>> Good-bye, Mother.\n\n>> Mrs. McDougall: Take care of yourself, David.\n\n>> Yes, Mrs. McDougall.\n\nElspeth, you see, I, >> Me too, David.\n\n>> What did you say?\n\n>> I love you.\n\n>> Elspeth.\n\nElspeth, will you marry me?\n\n>> Yes, David!\n\n(horn blaring) (tanks revving) (bell tolling) (man speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) >> What's he talking about?\n\n>> Sorry, I've no idea.\n\n>> Can I be of any help?\n\n>> Do you speak German?\n\nGood.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) >> He says the officers must be separated from the men.\n\n>> But we must keep the wounded with us.\n\nWe've only got one M.O.\n\namong the lot of us.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) >> He says they may stay with us till we reach the camp.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\n>> Anyway, a lot of them will remain automatically on the odd listing.\n\n>> Officer: That's right.\n\nWell, come on, lads.\n\nIn we go.\n\n(train chugging) >> How's tricks, Evans?\n\n>> Mustn't grumble, sir.\n\n>> You'll feel better with a gastrum.\n\n>> Thank you, sir.\n\n>> I don't know that you ought to smoke with that chest.\n\n>> Oh, it's nothing.\n\nWound's practically healed.\n\n>> It's a pretty bad show all around.\n\nI take it you fellows feel the same as I do.\n\nWe mustn't let the Jerries see we're down.\n\n>> Think the Jerries will get me down?\n\nIt's them ruddy cobbles.\n\nWhat can I do for my feet, sir?\n\n>> Do what I do.\n\nTry to forget 'em.\n\n>> I can't take 'em off, can I?\n\n>> Officer: How are you, Lennox?\n\nEyes hurting you a bit?\n\n>> A wee bit, sir.\n\n>> Officer: We'll get the Jerries to give you some proper treatment as soon as we reach camp.\n\n>> Thank you, sir.\n\n>> Officer: How about you?\n\n>> Mustn't grumble.\n\n>> You okay?\n\n>> Not too bad.\n\n>> Officer: How's the arm?\n\n>> Feels better now, sir.\n\n>> Good boy.\n\nAll right, lads.\n\nIt won't be long now.\n\nThen you'll be able to have a real rest.\n\nThanks for the help just now.\n\nUseful man to know.\n\nPerfect German.\n\nDalrymple's my name, 31st Lancers.\n\n>> Geoffrey Mitchell, 5th Oxfordshire Light Infantry.\n\n>> Oh, where did the Jerries pick you up?\n\n>> Teovin.\n\n>> Oh, really?\n\nHmm, I didn't know the 5th were anywhere near there.\n\nYes?\n\nHuh.\n\n(light music) (tense music) (booming and gunfire in distance) (lightly tense music) (splashing) (horn blaring) (light music) (soldier shouts in foreign language) (dire music) >> March to attention!\n\n(troop whistling) (bell tolling) >> Good afternoon.\n\n>> Good afternoon.\n\nDo sit down, would you?\n\n>> Thank you.\n\nMy name's Celia Mitchell.\n\nI've heard my husband may be a prisoner of war, Captain Geoffrey Mitchell.\n\n>> Maybe.\n\nDidn't the war office notify you, Mrs. Mitchell?\n\n>> Well, no, you see, I don't expect he put me down as next of kin.\n\n>> Oh, I beg your pardon.\n\nYour husband's regiment?\n\n>> The 5th Oxfordshire Light Infantry.\n\n>> General index.\n\nGive me particulars of Captain Geoffrey Mitchell, 5th Oxfordshire Light Infantry, will you?\n\n>> I'd like to send him parcels.\n\nI suppose I can do that.\n\n>> Oh, yes, certainly.\n\nOh, flag 27.\n\nPrisoner of war number 1376.\n\nThank you.\n\n(light hearted music) >> Hello, Mummy!\n\n>> Hello, darling.\n\nHave you had a lovely day with Grandpa?\n\n>> Will Father ever come back to us, Grandpa, even when the war's over?\n\n>> Well, would you be glad if he did?\n\n>> No.\n\nHe used to make Mummy cry.\n\n>> He is a prisoner.\n\n>> Hello, Desmond.\n\n>> Hello, Mummy.\n\n>> Janet, I'll leave you in charge.\n\nWell?\n\n>> He didn't put me down as next of kin.\n\n>> That seems to be the final gesture, doesn't it, my dear?\n\n>> It was only logical, I suppose.\n\nPoor Geoffrey.\n\nPoor Geoffrey?\n\nWell, I for one don't intend to shed any tears over him.\n\n>> Father?\n\nI'm going to write to him.\n\n>> You are?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Can't do any harm or good.\n\n>> They must be glad of any news of home.\n\n>> I don't suppose that Geoffrey ever betrayed the faintest interest in his home.\n\n>> I can tell him how the children are getting on.\n\n>> I can see Geoffrey regaling his fellow prisoners with news of the children he's scarcely ever seen.\n\n>> You're afraid, aren't you, Father?\n\n>> Certainly.\n\nI'm afraid that you may let yourself be carried away by sentimentality and suggest patching things up with him.\n\n>> Don't worry.\n\nWe said so many hard, cruel things to each other.\n\nI'd like to wipe out the memory of them.\n\nAnd then if we should happen to meet when the war's over, it won't be as enemies.\n\n(somber music) >> Here.\n\nGo easy with the soap.\n\nSorry, old boy.\n\nWe may make it last two days more if we're very careful.\n\n>> After that, we've got to make do with godliness.\n\n>> I say, Padre, what are you smoking?\n\nSauerkraut?\n\n>> Fag ends, fag ends, fag ends.\n\n>> Lucky fellow.\n\nI'm down to Mr. Middleton's specials.\n\nNot a cough in a compost heap.\n\n>> I hear there's a bush up by the boar loggers, not too bad in a pipe.\n\n>> Had a marvelous dream last night.\n\n>> Anybody I know?\n\n>> Eggs and bacon.\n\nTomato ketchup this time.\n\n>> We must have lost a shocking lot of stuff.\n\nThere's nothing to stop 'em.\n\nHe's bound to invade before the end of summer, And that's the end of us.\n\n>> Here, steady.\n\nWhat about the home fleet?\n\n>> What about the Luftwaffe waiting for the home fleet?\n\n>> Well, of all the damn defeated!\n\n>> Well, if you prefer to be a ruddy halfwit.\n\n>> What about the RAF?\n\nHitler can't stage an invasion until he's got control of the air, and I don't see the boys handing him that on a plate.\n\n>> Hear, hear!\n\nYou can't judge Hitler by ordinary standards.\n\nIf he thinks he'll invade, he'll invade.\n\n>> My old woman makes the kids pay a penny a week for the Red Cross.\n\nI'm writing to her to stop that caper.\n\nRed ruddy Cross!\n\nBloody sausage we ever get out of it!\n\n>> It's only two months.\n\nDon't forget, there were only a few hundred prisoners here before.\n\nNow there are tens of thousands.\n\nIt's a big job.\n\n>> Yeah, don't let's kid ourselves.\n\nNobody worries about us anymore.\n\nWe've been written off.\n\n>> You're a pessimist.\n\nHow do you spell \"sufficient\"?\n\n>> Same as the Sergeant Major's blessing, Two Fs and 1 C. >> Writing about the grub.\n\nMuck, I call it.\n\nBit of the old woman's cooking, is what I'd like now.\n\n>> What a sucker I was joining the ruddy army.\n\nPicture myself cutting it loose with some of those rowdy old French dames.\n\nHere I am shut up in this place, then I'll be past it.\n\n>> You ought to have joined the Navy and let the world see you.\n\nNow, son, there's no use you blowing off.\n\nTake things as you find them, that's always been my motto.\n\nNow the way I look at it is- >> Look at you!\n\nDrip, drip, drip.\n\nYou turn me up.\n\nYou're worse than a woman.\n\n>> Knock it, sonny.\n\nI was swinging a rifle when your nappies was swinging on the line.\n\n>> Swinging a lead, more like it.\n\n>> Here, if you're after a kip on the ear, my lad, you've come to the right person.\n\n(soldier groaning) >> That cigarette.\n\nLet me see it.\n\n>> What do you mean see it?\n\n>> Well, it's a Player's.\n\nWhere did you get it?\n\n>> Saved it up, of course.\n\nWhat's it got to do with you?\n\n>> I had three Player's left.\n\nYou stole it!\n\n>> Ah, go chase yourself.\n\n>> Hand it over!\n\n>> Pipe down, you little Welshman.\n\n>> Give it back!\n\n>> You did pinch that fag, you young basket.\n\n>> Yes, I did, so what?\n\n>> Just this.\n\n(bashing) >> Ugh.\n\n>> Been asking for it, sonny.\n\nI'm a man of peace, and peace is what I'm going to have plenty of in here.\n\n>> Blimey.\n\nThey'll have to have you at the peace conference.\n\n>> How are you today, Jessup?\n\n>> Mustn't grumble, sir.\n\n>> Managed to get on his feet.\n\n>> Not so as you make it, sir.\n\n>> Well, we'll soon get you out of here.\n\n>> Yes, sir, thank you, sir.\n\n>> Morning, Lennox.\n\n>> Oh, good morning, sir.\n\n>> Got some good news for you, David.\n\n>> Yes, Padre?\n\n>> Yes, my lad.\n\nYou'll be rejoining the rest of us tomorrow.\n\n>> Oh, that's fine, sir.\n\nAnd I'll be able to take this bandage off.\n\n>> Not yet, I'm afraid.\n\nYou'll have to wait till the optic nerve is completely healthy again.\n\nThen they'll send you to the eye hospital for an operation.\n\n>> So you'll have to be a very patient patient, my boy.\n\n>> I'll do my best, sir.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> I'm sorry, mate.\n\nI'll give you a packet of 20 when the Red Cross parcels come.\n\n>> Losing my temper over a fag.\n\nI shouldn't have left them roving about.\n\n>> You know, you wouldn't be a bad lad, if you got rid of some of your nasty habits.\n\n>> Don't knock it.\n\nLeave all that reforming stuff to the padre.\n\n>> What's your job in Civvy Street?\n\n>> Only suckers work.\n\n>> Oh, a \"Y\" boy, eh?\n\n>> You bet.\n\nMe and Ted's in the building business.\n\nWhat about learning the trade when we get home?\n\n>> I'll be home long before you two mugs.\n\nI'm gonna scarper.\n\n>> You got out of tougher spots than this, eh?\n\n>> Sure.\n\n>> Got a plan?\n\n>> Dozens of 'em.\n\nFor instance, >> You know, I can't make up me mind whether to turn this into a brigantine or a schooner.\n\n(woman giggling) >> I wonder how Jane's getting on these days?\n\n>> Who is Jane?\n\nYour girl?\n\n>> No, no, the Jane, the strip in the \"Mirror\".\n\n>> Oh, yes, the strip in the \"Mirror\".\n\n>> Well, I suppose a highbrow like you wouldn't read the Daily Mirror.\n\n>> I might have had.\n\n>> Why highbrow?\n\nI mean, perfect German and all that sort of thing.\n\nSpent much time in Germany?\n\n>> Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.\n\n>> Come to think of it, it's funny that none of the rest of your chaps got caught with you.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Did you have a company?\n\n>> Yes, machine gun company.\n\n>> Machine gun company?\n\nYou see- >> I think I'll turn it up.\n\nWound's hurting a bit.\n\n>> And all I have to do is stow away in one of them garbage bins or something.\n\nWhy, it's as easy as ketchup.\n\n>> If you're planning an escape, Matthews, may I give you a piece of advice?\n\nIndividual escapes hardly ever succeed.\n\nThese things have to be very carefully planned and coordinated by a whole group.\n\n>> All the same, sir, I'm gonna have a go at it if you have no objections.\n\n>> Well, good luck to you.\n\n>> Good luck.\n\nTwo-faced bleeder.\n\n>> I don't know what it is, but there's something phony about that bloke.\n\n>> Always sucking up with the German M.O.\n\nLike Commandant or somebody.\n\n>> Look, men.\n\n>> Matthews: That settles it.\n\n>> But they do have machine gun companies in the German army.\n\n>> Do you seriously think he's a traitor?\n\n>> He speaks German as well as any German.\n\n>> Of course he does.\n\nWhy shouldn't he be a German planted here as a stool pigeon?\n\n>> That would account for a lot of things.\n\n>> Yes, we're always talking about home.\n\nHe never does.\n\n>> I hate to believe it.\n\n(knocking) Come in.\n\nMay I report something, sir?\n\n>> Go ahead.\n\n>> Well, it's rather confidential, sir.\n\nIt's about somebody we think's a 5th colonist.\n\n>> An officer?\n\n>> A matter of fact, sir, it is.\n\nCaptain Mitchell, sir.\n\n>> There you are.\n\nA minute ago, he overheard me planning a breakout and went straight over and talked to one of the German guards.\n\n>> Thank you, Matthews.\n\nKeep your mouth shut for the time being.\n\n>> Very good, sir.\n\n>> There's only one thing to do with a rat.\n\nString him up!\n\n>> Here, wait a bit.\n\nMan's innocent till he's proved guilty.\n\n>> Don't let us behave like a bunch of nazis.\n\n>> Come on.\n\n>> Oh, Mitchell, you didn't destroy your identity card, did you?\n\n>> No, why?\n\n>> Oh, just check up.\n\nCan I have a look at it?\n\nDo you mind duplicating your signature?\n\n>> You can't do it, you swine, 'cause your name isn't Mitchell!\n\nCome on, what are we waiting

wouldn't!\n\n>> Shut up!\n\nGo on, spill it.\n\n>> I'm not a German.\n\nI'm a Czech.\n\n>> A Czech in British officer's uniform?\n\nThat's bloody likely!\n\n>> I'm in charge here.\n\nShut up, and that's an order!\n\nGo on.\n\n>> I escaped from a German concentration camp.\n\nI got through to France, and I took this uniform and the identity card from Mitchell's dead body.\n\nIt was my only chance if the Germans caught up with me.\n\n>> If that's the truth, why didn't you tell us at once?\n\n>> Would you have believed me any more than you do now?\n\nBesides, I have more to fear from the stool pigeons than you have.\n\n>> You've no proof of your story.\n\n>> None.\n\nHow could I have?\n\n>> How do you come to speak such perfect English and German?\n\n>> My father was at the Czech embassy in London after the last war.\n\nI spent my childhood there.\n\nGerman is a sort of second language in Czechoslovakia.\n\nI became professor of English at Prague University.\n\nI'm not much of

between Germany and England are at a standstill.\n\nYour letters, therefore, cannot leave this country.\n\nTo keep you informed, however, our news bulletins will be broadcast to you in English.\n\nAnd as you cannot hope to receive news from home, arrangements have been made for you to broadcast messages to your next of kin.\n\n>> Will all those who wish to avail themselves of Herr Forster's offer, take three paces forward!\n\n>> You are the senior British officer?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Are your men afraid that this is some sort of propaganda trick?\n\n>> Well, it's just possible.\n\n>> As you wish.\n\nYour name?\n\n>> Mitchell.\n\n>> Mitchell?\n\nYou are the officer acting as hospital interpreter.\n\n>> Mitchell: Yes.\n\n>> I understand you speak almost perfect German.\n\nThat's rather unusual for an Englishman.\n\n>> Mitchell: Is it?\n\n>> I wonder why your face seems familiar.\n\nI have many friends in England.\n\nPossibly we met there.\n\n>> Mitchell: Possibly.\n\n>> Excuse me.\n\n>> Forster: Yes?\n\n>> Do you wish to continue this conversation?\n\n>> No.\n\n>> Prisoners cannot be required to answer any questions other than those relating to name, rank, and number.\n\n>> Quite, quite.\n\nThe matter is of no importance.\n\n>> Commander: You may dismiss the parade, Major.\n\n>> Officer: Parade, shun!\n\nDismissed!\n\n(military music) >> Announcer: This is today's official war communique issued by the German high command.\n\nThe battle of Britain has entered upon a new and final stage.\n\nAnnihilation of England's towns and cities by the all-conquering Luftwaffe.\n\nLast night, just before sunset, the air-raid sirens sounded their ominous wailing notes to the nine million inhabitants of greater London.\n\nAll night, an endless stream of bombers roared about the city discharging their loads of high-explosive and incendiary bombs.\n\nAnti-aircraft opposition was negligible, for the British do not possess the guns to defend their homeland.\n\nAnd this attack will continue every night from dusk till dawn until the nerve center and capital city of the British empire is reduced to a vast pile of rubble, dust, and ashes.\n\nThe words of our great battle hymn have come true at last.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) We march against England.\n\n(singing in foreign language) >> Come on, boys.\n\nLet's give 'em our great battle

dismiss the parade, Major.\n\n>> Right.\n\nDismissed.\n\n>> I suppose I shall have to grow a beard after all.\n\nI don't know whether to have one of those 2-pronged affairs or a natty little

British prisoners of war and of block 27 will until further notice remain manacled from dawn until dusk.\n\nYou may dismiss the parade, Major.\n\n>> Major: Ready!\n\nParade, shun!\n\nParade ten, shun!\n\n>> Matthews: Cigarette?\n\n>> Thanks.\n\n>> It's easy.\n\nSardine key.\n\nTurn to the right.\n\nTurn to the left.\n\nBob's your uncle.\n\nAll part of the Red Cross service.\n\n(everyone laughing) >> Mitchell: Our third winter is approaching bringing with it a new enemy.\n\nIt's not the duration but the indefiniteness of duration.\n\nBut if a man knew the length of his sentence, he could plan accordingly.\n\nAfterwards in our memories, we shall relive only the sunny days or pleasant scenes, a freedom of mind and the comradeship.\n\nWe shall forget the wet days, the wet weeks.\n\nThose days when it seemed an effort to do nothing and our bunks were the only release.\n\nDeep down in the hearts of all of us, there dwells a lonely ache, a desperate yearning for those we love and a fear, fear of becoming forgotten men.\n\nWrite to me again soon, Celia.\n\nYou could never know how great the comfort is that your letters bring to me.\n\nThey're more than comforting.\n\nThey give me strength and hope and happiness.\n\nYou will never know how much they mean to me.\n\n>> Celia: Oh, my dear, I am so terribly moved by the way you write.\n\nIs it too late to recapture the happiness or our first years together?\n\n(music intensifying) >> Mitchell: I have no place in your past or your future, Celia.\n\nYou must think of your husband as dead.\n\nThis is good-bye.\n\n>> Celia: I understand.\n\nDon't be afraid.\n\nI'll help you back.\n\nI'll give you back your strength, the strength you've given to me writing to me through these dark years.\n\nI'll wait for you.\n\n(dramatic music) (plane engines humming in distance) >> Fortresses.\n\nThey'll soon be able to see the channel.\n\nThey'll be home in time for tea.\n\nThat's exactly 157 pounds you owe me.\n\n>> Cut you through the pack.\n\nDouble or quit.\n\n>> Not on your life.\n\nI've got me old age to think of.\n\n>> Blood sucker.\n\n>> Oh, well, there goes my gratuity.\n\n>> Cheap enough to pass the time.\n\nFunny how much you learn about time when you're killing it.\n\n>> Such as what?\n\nI've got a theory that everything that counts is done by busy people.\n\nWhen you've got too little time, it's extraordinary what you can do with it.\n\nAnd when you've got all the time in the world, like us, you don't do a damn thing.\n\n>> That's it, doc, you're becoming quite a philosopher in your old age.\n\n>> Why not?\n\nThe war hasn't exactly chosen us to be heroes.\n\n>> I know exactly what I'm going to do with my time right now.\n\nI'm going to climb into my bunk and do absolutely nothing till supper.\n\n>> They're talking about tiram for the derby this year.\n\nIt'll be the fourth derby I've missed.\n\nFour derbies, that's a hell of a lot of time.\n\nWith nothing up or down on the books to show for it.\n\n>> Bloody leeks again this year, Dai?\n\n>> I was thinking of trying some asparagus.\n\n>> Asparagus?\n\nThat takes seven years a crop.\n\n>> Aye.\n\n>> I don't give it more than another year myself.\n\n>> Another year?\n\nGwyneth will be 4.\n\nFlo's hair has gone all white, she says.\n\nEverything's changing.\n\nDo you think we'll be able to pick it up?\n\nThe business and everything?\n\n>> Search me.\n\nWe're not as young as we were, Dai.\n\n>> No, Ted, we're not as young as we were.\n\n>> Dai: Surely they'll invade soon.\n\n>> Matthews: Yeah, that's what you said last year.\n\n>> Ted: And the year before.\n\n>> Man: Where's the goddamn mate already, list?\n\n>> Man: Yeah, it's going to be damn broke as 1949.\n\n>> I wrote that for Caroline.\n\nSomehow it expressed what I felt when I first met her.\n\nIt was after a concert.\n\nThere weren't any taxis.\n\nWe walked back across the park.\n\nAfter a bit, it began to rain.\n\nSo I carried her on my shoulders.\n\n>> Mitchell: You're still in love with her, aren't you?\n\n>> I've tried to shut her out of my thoughts completely.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nI long for her all the time.\n\n>> I'm a bigger fool than you are.\n\nFalling in love with a photograph.\n\nA dream.\n\nAnd a home in a strange land.\n\n>> Achtung!\n\n>> Oh, carry on.\n\nGood afternoon, gentlemen.\n\nOh, please, do carry on.\n\nEach time I visit this camp, I'm intrigued as to where we met before.\n\nBut now I think I know the answer.\n\nYour name wasn't always Geoffrey Mitchell.\n\nYour identification photograph is being sent to Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.\n\nThey have a large collection of photographs there.\n\nIt will be interesting to make comparisons.\n\n>> I suppose it had to come.\n\nThey always catch up with you in the end.\n\n>> Repatriation, fellas!\n\nRepatriation!\n\n>> Great news, gentlemen, great news!\n\nRepatriation!\n\nAnd this time it's the real McCoy.\n\n>> That's the thing that makes my mouth water, real live girls.\n\nHundreds of 'em, all lining up waiting for me.\n\n>> Girls, what are they?\n\n>> Bipeds, old boy, furnished with two of practically everything!\n\n>> A mixed German and Swiss medical commission will examine all those whose names are down for repatriation.\n\nApparently it's a rush job, so anybody who gets his ticket will leave in a week's time.\n\n>> So you've got a chance.\n\n>> Yes.\n\nBut we must have positive evidence to justify repatriation.\n\n>> Of course.\n\n>> Ah.\n\nAnything else, Corporal?\n\n>> Well, sir, every time I breathe, I can feel me liver knocking up against me kidneys.\n\n>> Come here.\n\nCough, please.\n\n>> Cough?\n\nBlimey, do you want me to bring up my appendix?\n\n>> Yah.\n\nYou have passed.\n\n>> Thank you, sir.\n\n>> Soldier: Matthews.\n\nI wonder if you'll get through.\n\n>> Hello, Evans.\n\nYou'll soon be seeing your youngster.\n\n>> Yes, indeed.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about you and Captain Grayson, sir.\n\n>> Oh, well, the flat racing season's over.\n\n>> Do you know that Swiss fellow actually had the nerve to congratulate me on my fitness?\n\n>> Man: Well?\n\n>> Soldier: I got my ticket, all right.\n\n>> Fine.\n\nYou have passed.\n\n>> Suits me, sir.\n\n>> Captain Mitchell.\n\nAh.\n\nYou need not strip, Captain Mitchell.\n\nI regret your case is deferred until the next board in six months' time.\n\nMorris.\n\n>> And once it's discovered he's not Mitchell, he's sunk.\n\nThey'll have no mercy.\n\nWe've got to do something for him.\n\nYes, but what?\n\nExcuse me, sir.\n\nCan we put up a scheme to you?\n\n>> Sure.\n\nSit down.\n\nWhat's it all about?\n\n>> We know the spot Captain Mitchell's in.\n\n>> We thought we'd fix up a stunt to get him out of here.\n\n>> What's the scheme?\n\n>> Well, sir, there's a list of blokes for repatriation in the commandant's office.\n\n>> We thought if we could get hold of it, alter the names, >> stage a break-in, sir.\n\n>> Hear, hear, hold on.\n\nWe aren't professional burglars.\n\n>> Well, yes, sir, as a matter of fact, well, I was.\n\n>> Were you really?\n\nWell, how awfully interesting.\n\n>> Commandant's office, only one wire to cut.\n\n>> Yes, but what about the perimeter lights?\n\n>> They always put them out when there's an air raid.\n\n>> And they've been as regular as clockwork lately.\n\n>> Gosh, I believe we've got something.\n\n>> Suppose we do get the list.\n\nWhat then?\n\n>> I can type.\n\n>> Scratch out one of the names beginning with M and type Mitchell's on instead.\n\n>> Just a minute.\n\nDon't you see, the chap whose name goes off has to stay behind.\n\n>> Well, uh, my name begins with M, sir.\n\n>> Ossy: You'd really give up your ticket home?\n\n>> Why not?\n\n>> Ossy: But I thought all the girls were lining up for you to come home?\n\n>> Well, so they are.\n\nBut they'll wait.\n\n>> You are a sportsman.\n\nGentleman, we'll have a snack.\n\nNow, as I see it, the drill is this, (light music) ♪ My eyes are dim, I cannot see ♪ ♪ I have not brought my spear with me ♪ (tense music) >> Here come the boys.\n\nBang on the dot.\n\n>> What do you mean?\n\n>> Well, just another raid, old boy.\n\nAll right, chaps, lights out and sing out.\n\n(men singing indistinctly) >> Well, they had better start.\n\n>> Ossy: I know.\n\nGod bless the R.A.F.\n\n>> Here he is.\n\n>> Good boy.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> Look out!\n\nAll clear.\n\n(soldiers speak in foreign language) (soldiers laughing) That's the lock you've got to pick.\n\nGood, there's a typewriter.\n\nGet down!\n\nType on the floor.\n\n>> Matthews: It's tougher than I thought.\n\n>> Ossy: Let me try.\n\n>> Must be a bit out of practice.\n\n>> I'll say.\n\nGood, this is it.\n\n(typewriter clacking) Sing, you so-and-sos, sing!\n\nThat'll do.\n\nCome on.\n\n>> Matthews: That'll fool 'em.\n\n>> Ossy: Should do.\n\nLet's split up and get back to our own huts.\n\n>> Matthews: Ok, sir.\n\n(dog snarling) (guns firing in distance) >> What's going on?\n\n>> You're not supposed to know.\n\nThe boys were out there putting your name on the repatriation list.\n\n(gun rattling) (dog growling) ♪ How I dream how I see ♪ ♪ And then finally home I'll be ♪ ♪ That the sun will never never shine ♪ ♪ And I'm going, yes I'm going ♪ ♪ Mighty soon I'll be helloing ♪ ♪ To that cold ♪ ♪ And happy of mine ♪ >> Silence!\n\nYou will all remain here until the other huts have been checked!\n\n(heroic music) >> Permission to go home, sir?\n\n>> Yes, provided you put a fiver on Tiram and army for me.\n\n>> It's you that ought to be going home.\n\n>> Oh, don't you believe it.\n\nI'm a social parasite.\n\nThe sort we're fighting to get rid of.\n\n>> That's right.\n\nI've got to stay here and exterminate him.\n\nGo slow with the popsies though, now.\n\nDon't forget to save a couple of peach-fed blondes for your Uncle Jim.\n\n>> That's a promise.\n\n>> Oh, I was kidding.\n\nYou're one of those one-woman blokes, aren't you?\n\nYes, that's my trouble.\n\n>> Jim: Sorry, then.\n\nAlways putting my foot in it.\n\n>> Don't forget to tell the girls round Hammersmith Way that I'll be home soon and I've got plenty saved up to give them a treat with.\n\n>> Yeah, you bet.\n\nI'm gonna keep my job warm for you.\n\nHorsfall, Evans, and Matthews.\n\nUnlimited.\n\n>> Hello, Matthews.\n\nFeeling all right?\n\n>> Matthews: Yes, it's all right, sir.\n\nI was a sissy passing out like that.\n\n>> I can never thank you for what you've done.\n\n>> Well, forget it.\n\nJust keep your head down on the parade And pop your uncle.\n\n>> Thanks.\n\n>> Don't worry, sir.\n\nYou'll get through all right.\n\n>> We'll be right behind you, sir.\n\n>> One other thing.\n\nWhat about the German M.O?\n\nHe's certain to be on parade, and he's more likely than anyone to remember that Mitchell's name wasn't on the list.\n\n>> I know.\n\nI've thought of that.\n\n>> I'm going to start up a conversation with him while they're calling the names.\n\n>> He only speaks about a dozen words in English.\n\n>> You leave it to me.\n\nHello, David, my boy.\n\nGood-bye and good luck.\n\n>> Good-bye, sir, and thank you all.\n\n>> See you again before you know where you are.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Come on, David.\n\nDon't forget.\n\nWe've got a bridge date tonight.\n\n>> David: Don't forget the cigarettes you owe me, padre.\n\n>> Man: Play you a double at quits tonight, Jim.\n\n>> Ambrose.\n\nAnderson.\n\nBurns.\n\n>> There are a lot of things I'd like to say, but I can't.\n\n>> Go on.\n\nOff you go.\n\nGood-bye.\n\nGood luck.\n\n>> So long, old boy.\n\n>> Good luck.\n\n>> Keep out of the German M.O.\n\n's eyeline.\n\n>> Grant.\n\nHarley.\n\nHunt.\n\nHorsfall.\n\nJackson.\n\nJessop.\n\n>> Ossy: How soon do you think the war will end now, doctor?\n\n>> Doctor: Six months, one year if you like.\n\n>> Ossy: By then, you'll be speaking fluent English.\n\n>> Doctor: You think I've made good progression?\n\n>> Oh, terrific.\n\nYes, you Germans certainly have the gift for languages.\n\n>> You think so?\n\n>> Of course, yes.\n\n>> After the war, they might make me headmaster of Oxford University.\n\n(both laughing) >>

salvage two years ago.\n\n>> David: I'll miss the squeaking of that old gate.\n\nHave there been any other changes?\n\n>> Mother: No.\n\nI kept your room exactly as it was the day you went off to France.\n\n>> Same old smell.\n\nSunlight, soap, and furniture polish.\n\n>> You come in here for a minute and I'll get you something to eat.\n\n>> Elspeth: David.\n\n>> Elspeth.\n\n>> That last letter.\n\nYour mother showed me.\n\nTelling the truth about your eyes.\n\nSo that was the reason.\n\n>> The reason for what?\n\n>> Elspeth: For breaking our engagement.\n\n>> But you can't go on being engaged when you're not in love any longer.\n\n>> You can't go on breaking a person's heart to satisfy your own stupid pride.\n\n>> David: I'm not prepared to discuss the matter.\n\n>> Neither

David, why did you have to make me so dreadfully unhappy?\n\n>> Stephen: Caroline.\n\nBut, but what are you, >> There were some things I left behind.\n\nCaretaker let me in.\n\nI had no idea.\n\nI'll go now.\n\n>> Stephen: Caroline.\n\n>> Caroline: Yes, Stephen?\n\n>> Are you all right?\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\n>> Caroline: Because I'm a fool.\n\n>> Stephen: Are you unhappy with Robert?\n\n>> I'm not with Robert.\n\nOh, Stephen.\n\nWhy did you have to believe that idiot?\n\n>> It wasn't true?\n\nIt wasn't true?\n\n>> No.\n\nNot then.\n\n>> Go on.\n\n>> When I got your letter, it was as if all I'd ever believed in didn't exist anymore.\n\nI didn't care what happened.\n\n>> He was in love with you?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Stephen: And you?\n\n>> No.\n\nLet me go now, please.\n\n>> Listen, Caroline.\n\nThere, everything seemed so, so out of proportion.\n\nI think I was mad for a bit.\n\nYou see, I loved you so desperately.\n\nStill do.\n\nAlways shall.\n\n>> Caroline: Stephen.\n\n>> Thanks, mate.\n\nThanks.\n\nWell, this is it, Dai.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> How do you feel?\n\n>> Empty, empty inside.\n\n>> Me too, like it wasn't me standing here at all.\n\nCome on, Dai, let's get weaving.\n\n(knocking) Hello, old girl.\n\n>> Hello, Ted.\n\nDoing you all right?\n\n>> I was seasick.\n\n>> Stomach always was your weakness.\n\n>> Ted: Suits you.\n\n>> Flo: Oh, Ted.\n\n>> There, there.\n\nI can't leave Dai out in the cold like that.\n\n>> Oh, Dai.\n\n>> Dai: Hello, flo.\n\n>> Flo: Oh, it's lovely to see you.\n\nCome on in.\n\n>> Dai: Where is she?\n\n>> Flo: In here.\n\n(gentle music) >> Hello, Gwyneth.\n\n>> Hello.\n\n>> Do you know who I am?\n\n>> Gwyneth: Yes, you're my Daddy, aren't you?\n\n>> That's it.\n\nLook.\n\nI made this in the prison camp for you.\n\n>> Gwyneth: Can she shut her eyes?\n\n>> No, she can't.\n\n>> Gwyneth: Mother Terese can.\n\n>> Dai: She's lovely.\n\n>> So that's settled.\n\nCaptain Hasek reports to duty to Czech headquarters.\n\n>> There was something I wanted to ask, sir.\n\nAbout Mrs. Mitchell.\n\n>> Oh, yes.\n\nVery awkward, of course.\n\nDon't worry, Captain Hasek.\n\nWe've got that matter in hand.\n\n>> I wanted to suggest, sir, as it's my responsibility, that if the notification of her husband's death could be delayed until I've seen Mrs. Mitchell myself.\n\n>> She'll have to be told through the usual channels, you know.\n\n>> Hasek: Yes, sir, but in a case like this, it's, >> The war office will look after it.\n\nOr if you like, go down and see her off your own bat, there's nothing to stop you.\n\n>> I see.\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n>> Looks like rain.\n\nMy dear.\n\nIt's no good going on hoping.\n\nYou must face up to it.\n\n>> That he won't come back?\n\n>> Grandpa: That he won't come back.\n\n>> Grandpa.\n\nIt's starting to rain.\n\nCome help me put the chairs in the summer house.\n\nOh, come on.\n\n(bell ringing) (light music) >> Oh.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI was expecting someone else.\n\n>> Mrs. Mitchell, I came to see you.\n\nI have some news for you, of your husband.\n\n>> Oh.\n\nCome in, please.\n\nWhat?\n\n>> Hasek: Your husband is dead.\n\n(somber music) >> Celia: Dead?\n\n>> Hasek: He was killed four years ago in the fighting at Saint-Ardennie.\n\n>> I heard from him.\n\nFrom the prison camp.\n\n>> Your husband was never in that prison camp.\n\nHe was never a prisoner of war.\n\n>> Celia: But, the letters.\n\n>> I wrote those letters.\n\n>> Celia: You?\n\n>> Hasek: Yes.\n\nI took these from your husband's body.\n\nI took his name, his uniform, his identity.\n\nFor four years, I've been Geoffrey Mitchell.\n\n(tense music) >> Celia: But why?\n\n>> To save my life.\n\nThe Germans were after me.\n\n>> Celia: The letters?\n\n>> Later in the camp, I had to write.\n\nThey suspected me.\n\nIf I hadn't answered your letters, they'd have been on to me.\n\n>> You had to answer my letters.\n\nI understand that.\n\nYou even had to go on writing.\n\nI understand that, too.\n\nWhy did you have to write the way you did?\n\nI believed every word you said.\n\n>> At first, I had to make you tell me as much as possible about yourself.\n\nI was fighting for my life.\n\nAnd then, I got your other letters.\n\nPhotos of the children.\n\nGlimpses of things lost to me forever and, it was as if you were offering me a new world.\n\nIt was easy out there to delude oneself.\n\n>> And I believed a wonderful thing had happened.\n\nMy husband had left me.\n\nAnd those letters made me believe he was mine again, that everything would be as I'd hoped it would be.\n\nI planned for the day he'd come home again, for a new life together.\n\nWhat a fool I was.\n\n>> Hasek: You were still in love with him?\n\n>> Celia: How I can tell now?\n\n>> I know there's no excuse for what I did, but, >> Celia: Will you go now, please?\n\n>> You must believe that I meant what I wrote.\n\nYour letters came to be my life.\n\nYou see, I fell in love with you.\n\nIt was a dream then.\n\nNow it's reality.\n\n(Celia sobbing) (grand festive music) (bells tolling) I allowed myself to dream that these letters of ours could come to life.\n\nThat I could see with my own eyes your home, the children, yourself.\n\n(dire music) (fireworks booming) (bells tolling) >> Celia, you're wanted on the telephone.\n\n>> Celia: Who is it?\n\n>> Grandpa: Captain Hasek.\n\n(grand festive music) (grand music)"
