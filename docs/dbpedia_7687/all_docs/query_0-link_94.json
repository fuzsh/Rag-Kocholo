        "text": "Netflix has just acquired an Oscar-winning psychological drama which has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nReleased in January 2016, Room is a heart-wrenching thriller starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay as mother and son.\n\nThe film was adapted from the widely successful Emma Donoghue novel of the same name, released in 2010.\n\nThe film focuses on a mother and son’s introduction to the world after being held captive for seven years after ‘Ma’ (Larson) was kidnapped at age seventeen and kept as a prisoner in a squalid shed they called ‘room’.\n\nThe film is a psychological drama that focuses on the changed family dynamics as ‘Ma’ manages her own mental struggles while also mothering her son, Jack (Tremblay) who she gave birth to while being held captive by ‘Old Nick’, her rapist and captor.\n\nThe film is heartbreaking and moving and has been met with huge critical acclaim since its release – and as of August 1, it’s now available to stream on Netflix.\n\nThe 1hr 57-minute long film has a 93% audience score and rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe critic’s consensus on the site reads: ‘Led by incredible work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room makes for an unforgettably harrowing – and undeniably rewarding – experience.’\n\nMark Kermode said for The Guardian: ‘Brie Larson and seven-year-old Jacob Tremblay are nothing short of perfect as the central couple around whom this trembling universe revolves.’\n\nLenny Abrahamson wrote for the New York Times: ‘ It turns out that telling this kind of grim story through the eyes of a child isn’t just a shrewdly palatable device, it’s also artistically liberating, because the more the world opens up, the smaller Room becomes.’\n\nThe film also stars Joan Allen and William H. Macy as Joy’s parents, both actors also received critical acclaim for these roles but it was Larson who cinched an Oscar win.\n\nLarson won the Oscar for Best Actress at age 25 for her role in this film. The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nLarson told Metro.co.uk in an interview at the time that the beginning of the film is meant to be a ‘hard part to watch’.\n\n‘The set-up was meant to be the hard part to watch because we want you to root for the characters. You can experience that. What I hope is that people can experience that as well and hear about it. It’s important to feel that sweep,’ she said.\n\nShe also revealed she spent a lot of time on the set, examining the space in detail with Tremblay, so they really felt familiar with the space.\n\n‘We spent so much time thinking about the different factors involved in the movie. What did the space of Room look like, and down to the little bits of mould on the tiles,’ she explained.\n\n‘Starting with that we had a great launching pad for the rest of the story. That way we could experience the movie as we were filming it. We didn’t have to spend so much time trying to anticipate how it should be.\n\n‘That’s what made the film seem so honest and simple. We didn’t have to try and make a moment, it felt like we lived it.’\n\nRoom is available to stream on Netflix now.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Netflix thrills fans after casting 2024’s breakout star in biggest new rom-com\n\nMORE : When we can expect new seasons of these Netflix mega hits"
