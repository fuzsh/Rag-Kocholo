        "text": "Literature\n\nTitle: Last Farewell\n\nSubject: Bilbo's Last Song\n\nTFL Category: Literature (J.R.R. Tolkien)\n\nOpened: 26 February 2006\n\nMembers: 26 (0)\n\nLast Updated: 27 March 2022\n\nThis poem is a kind of epilogue to The Lord of the Rings, which was published after Tolkien's death. It's a haunting poem, that speaks of Bilbo's final journey from Grey Havens. The mixture of the sadness of parting from loved ones but also the joy of looking forward to a final homecoming touches me, and this poem has been a favourite ever since I first heard it.\n\nTitle: Stranger in a Strange Land\n\nSubject: The Gandalara Cycle\n\nTFL Category: Literature (Randall Garrett and Vicki Ann Heydron)\n\nOpened: 4 July 2006\n\nMembers: 18 (0)\n\nLast updated: 27 March 2022\n\nA relatively recent discovery for me, this is a sci-fi/fantasy series with an exciting plot and an original concept that deserves to be better known.\n\nTitle: Hidden Lives\n\nSubject: Middlemarch\n\nTFL Category: Literature (George Eliot)\n\nOpened: 18 September 2006\n\nMembers: 5 (0)\n\nLast Updated: 27 March 2022\n\nA long standing favourite of mine, and one of the great novels of the 19th century. It is a story about different journeys from youthful dreams and idealism to experience, and shows George Eliot's wonderful observation of human character and her vision of a moral life based on sympathy for all humanity. This fanlisting also covers the BBC TV mini-series\n\nTitle: Timeless Moments\n\nSubject: Four Quartets\n\nTFL Category: Literature (T.S. Eliot)\n\nOpened: 27 October 2006\n\nMembers: 9 (0)\n\nLast Updated: 27 March 2022\n\nThese poems are a meditation on time and the nature of reality. Many of their passages have been of great significance to me. I chose them as the subject of my undergraduate dissertation, and I still love them!\n\nCharacters\n\nTitle: Shadows of Twilight\n\nSubject: Elrond\n\nTFL Category: Characters: Book/Movie (Lord of the Rings, The and other Middle-earth Books)\n\nOpened: 1 August 2008\n\nMembers: 109 (69)\n\nLast updated: 23 April 2023\n\nOne of my favourite characters from Tolkien's Middle-earth books. The fanlisting was integrated into my already-existing Elrond fansite."
