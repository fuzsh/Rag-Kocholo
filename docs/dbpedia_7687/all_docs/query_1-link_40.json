Her characters are lovable, the ship scenes exciting, the romance invigorating, and well, the stories are just plain fun!\n\nBy Linda Chaikin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Port Royal as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe scene is Jamaica in the 1700s--a world of smuggling, slaves, and sugar plantations. A British viscount turned pirate meets a woman with a noble cause. Romance, adventure, and Christian history are interspersed in this exciting series.\n\nPreview\n\nA Voice in the Wind\n\nBy Francine Rivers,\n\nFrom my list on that put the Roman in romance.\n\nBy Nancy Kimball Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I watched the Ridley Scott film Gladiator for the first time, I knew then my heart belonged in Ancient Rome. Countless books, films, research papers, museums, and shenanigans later, that is still true. I was a master of make-believe by age ten, and when the time was right, both passions fused into my debut novel, also set in Ancient Rome. I don’t want to just read or write a good book. I want to experience Ancient Rome vicariously through powerful characters that linger in my memory long after the last page. If that’s you too, give these a try.\n\nNancy's book list on that put the Roman in romance\n\nWhy did Nancy love this book?\n\nThis is the gold standard of Ancient World Christian Fiction for a reason. The author is an RWA Hall of Fame recipient and ACFW Lifetime Achievement Award winner. This first book in the Mark of the Lion series is so much more than a book about early Christianity and why Rome hated it. Words to describe Hadassah and Marcus’s story are… epic, profound, life-changing, powerful, captivating, and I could go on and on. It still freaks me out and totally awes me when reviews for my novels mention her in the same sentence. I want to be flattered and offended on her behalf at the same time, which is completely crazy. If you’re only going to invest in one book from my list, it should be this one.\n\nBy Francine Rivers,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked A Voice in the Wind as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBook 1 in the 3-book historical Christian fiction series by the New York Times bestselling author of Redeeming Love and The Masterpiece.\n\nThe first book in the beloved Mark of the Lion series, A Voice in the Wind brings readers back to the first century and introduces them to a character they will never forget―Hadassah.\n\nWhile wealthy Roman citizens indulge their every whim, Jews and barbarians are bought and sold as slaves and gladiators in the bloodthirsty arena. Amid the depravity around her, a young Jewish slave girl becomes a light in the darkness. Even as she’s torn by her…\n\nPreview\n\nDreamspell\n\nBy Tamara Leigh,\n\nFrom my list on on the edge of your seat Christian romance.\n\nBy MaryLu Tyndall Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhat can I say? I’m a hopeless romantic. There’s nothing better than a great romance novel set in the past when chivalry was not dead. I’m a published author of more than twenty-five novels, including a great pirate series. I grew up in Florida and fell in love with the tropics as I sat on the beach and dreamt of handsome pirates. Once I became a Christian, I started reading Christian romances but found many of them moved a little slow to my liking, so I decided to write one myself! I have a BA in Computer Science and have won several awards for my writing.\n\nMaryLu's book list on on the edge of your seat Christian romance\n\nWhy did MaryLu love this book?\n\nI just love time travel stories. If you couple that with the Medieval time period, I’m there. Tamara Leigh is one of the best Medieval authors out there. This was one of the first books I read of hers, and I was hooked. If you like time travel, romance, great history, and a fun and exciting plot, you will love this book!.\n\nBy Tamara Leigh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Dreamspell as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA TIME TO LIVE.

I have twenty-two Revolutionary Patriots in my family history, and I am most proud of my 6x-great grandmother, Anna Asbury Stone, for her bravery and daring during the winter of 1778. I did extensive genealogical research to learn about her, her family, and her circumstances before writing Answering Liberty’s Call: Anna Stone’s Daring Ride to Valley Forge.\n\nTracy's book list on featuring strong women in 18th century America\n\nWhy did Tracy love this book?\n\nBound is set in the years prior to the American Revolution, and highlights the difficulties faced by girls and women indentured servants. Alice and her family set out for America from England, but when her mother and brothers die during the voyage, Alice’s father decides he cannot keep her and sells her as an indentured servant upon reaching Boston. Alice should have had a middle-class upbringing, but instead, she becomes chattel. The scenes of abuse in this book are stark, but it helps to shed light on the sufferings of the disenfranchised and the helpless. Alice’s determination will inspire.\n\nBy Sally Cabot Gunning,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Bound as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn indentured servant finds herself bound by law, society, and her own heart in this novel set in colonial Cape Cod from the author of acclaimed The Widow’s War.\n\nIndentured servant Alice Cole barely remembers when she was not “bound”, first to the Morton family, then to their daughter Nabby—her companion since childhood—when she wed. But Nabby’s new marriage is not happy, and when Alice finds herself torn between her new master and her old friend, she runs away to Boston. There she meets a sympathetic widow named Lyddie Berry and her lawyer companion, Eben Freeman. Impulsively stowing away on…\n\nPreview\n\nAmerican Passage\n\nBy Katherine Grandjean,\n\nFrom my list on borderland mobility.\n\nBy Mark Dizon Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe past fascinates me because it is strange and different to the world we live in today. That is why I prefer looking at earlier centuries than contemporary times because the distant past requires an extra effort on our part to unlock how people back then made sense of their world. When I read an old chronicle on how Indigenous people spent days traveling to meet acquaintances and even strangers, it piqued my interest. Did they really need to meet face-to-face? What did traveling mean to them? The books on the list below are attempts by historians to understand the travelers of the past.\n\nMark's book list on borderland mobility\n\nWhy did Mark love this book?\n\nAmerican Passage’s portrayal of early New England as a fluid frontier where people, goods, and information traveled is excellent.\n\nI like how Grandjean retells the English settlement of the region in terms of how people moved and communicated with one another. She forces readers to rethink our ideas of settler colonialism. In reality, English settlements were tiny islands in a vast sea of Indian lands.\n\nBy Katherine Grandjean,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked American Passage as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNew England was built on letters. Its colonists left behind thousands of them, brittle and browning and crammed with curls of purplish script. How they were delivered, though, remains mysterious. We know surprisingly little about the way news and people traveled in early America. No postal service or newspapers existed-not until 1704 would readers be able to glean news from a \"public print.\" But there was, in early New England, an unseen world of travelers, rumors, movement, and letters. Unearthing that early American communications frontier, American Passage retells the story of English colonization as less orderly and more precarious than…\n\nPreview\n\nFounding Mothers\n\nBy Cokie Roberts,\n\nFrom my list on everyday life in the Southern colonies.\n\nBy Ida Flowers Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nEver since I started reading the Little House series at the age of ten, I’ve been in love with women’s history. In college I had the opportunity to write a paper on the topic of my choice and I chose women of the American colonial period. I found that while our daily life is now very different, our feelings as women are much the same. The more primary sources I discovered, the more I could feel the fears, sorrows, and joys of the determined women who came before us, unwittingly creating records of their experiences in their correspondence and journals as they built homes and businesses from the raw, wild land.\n\nIda's book list on everyday life in the Southern colonies\n\nWhy did Ida love this book?\n\nI love reading about women from the past who asserted themselves in a world where there was little was expected from them besides obedience to the men in their lives. Founding Mothers is a story of influential women prior to and after the American Revolution, with many quotes from personal correspondence, from Abigail Adams to Martha Washington. Not only do we read of the activities in which they participated, including births and deaths of their own children, but the emotions that kept them company as well. Touching on the lives of those less renowned as well, Founding Mothers is a springboard for deeper research into the lives of women living in young America.\n\nBy Cokie Roberts,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Founding Mothers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom #1 New York Times bestselling author Cokie Roberts comes New York Times bestseller Founding Mothers, an intimate and illuminating look at the fervently patriotic and passionate women whose tireless pursuits on behalf of their families—and their country—proved just as crucial to the forging of a new nation as the rebellion that established it.\n\nWhile much has been written about the men who signed the Declaration of Independence, battled the British, and framed the Constitution, the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters they left behind have been little noticed by history. #1 New York Times bestselling author Cokie Roberts brings us…\n\nPreview\n\nComplete Writings\n\nBy Phillis Wheatley,\n\nWhy did Bettye love this book?\n\nIn 1761, the slave ship Phillis departed from Africa and headed toward America. Among the human cargo was a young girl. Judging by her missing incisors, she was seven or eight years old. Soon after the ship’s arrival in Boston, John and Susann Wheatley purchased the girl and named her after the ship that had delivered her to them. Mrs. Wheatley taught their servant to read and write and introduced her to classical and English literature, including revered poets. Around 1765, Phillis began writing poetry, and her first poem, “On Messrs. Hussey and Coffin,” published in 1767, when she was only about fourteen years old, rendered her the first black person in America to publish a poem. Carretta’s collection of Wheatley’s work includes a fascinating, thoroughly researched introduction.\n\nBy Phillis Wheatley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Complete Writings as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe extraordinary writings of Phillis Wheatley, a slave girl turned published poet\n\nIn 1761, a young girl arrived in Boston on a slave ship, sold to the Wheatley family, and given the name Phillis Wheatley. Struck by Phillis' extraordinary precociousness, the Wheatleys provided her with an education that was unusual for a woman of the time and astonishing for a slave. After studying English and classical literature, geography, the Bible, and Latin, Phillis published her first poem in 1767 at the age of 14, winning much public attention and considerable fame. When Boston publishers who doubted its authenticity rejected an…\n\nPreview\n\nA Place Called Freedom\n\nBy Ken Follett,\n\nWhy did Eddie love this book?\n\nA Place Called Freedom attracted me instantly because of its multiple settings (Scotland, London, and Virginia) and the theme of ordinary people struggling against adversity.\n\nThe novel provides vivid insight into governmental repression of religion and the denial of basic human rights. As a historian, I enjoy reading historical fiction. Follett is a master of his craft, blending human interest stories with accurate history. Through his characters, he shows how people lived and reacted to historical events.\n\nA Place Called Freedom transports the reader into the years prior to the American Revolution, and his vivid geographical descriptions made me feel like “I was there!”\n\nBy Ken Follett,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Place Called Freedom as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSet in an era of turbulent social changes on both sides of the Atlantic, A Place Called Freedom is a magnificent historical fiction novel from the undisputed master of suspense and drama, Ken Follett.\n\nA Life of Poverty\n\nScotland, 1767.
