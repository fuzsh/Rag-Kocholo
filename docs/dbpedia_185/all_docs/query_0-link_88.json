        "text": "This research emerged as a necessity to investigate the causes of structural problems encountered during the restoration of some registered Ottoman houses. As a result of the research, it was seen that the wooden frame system, the first examples of which were found to have emerged in the Balkans-Anatolia area (around the 6th millennium BC), evolved over time and reached today. When viewed back from today, the house also had to be investigated for the Ottoman-Byzantine-Roman prehistoric periods. The region where the Ottoman house was intensively developed is located on the North Anatolian Fault Lines, where forest resources are rich but the Anatolian Eurasian plateau is the most risky. Of course, socioeconomic conditions will be effective in the formation of home architecture, but it is clear how a devastating disaster such as an earthquake is an important test in the evolution of the house.\n\nThis paper focuses on the architectural history of Constantinople during the Late Byzantine period, with particular emphasis on the housing and settlement patterns. It uncovers the predominance of wooden structures in the city's architecture, which contributed to the rapid spread of fires during historical sieges. The research reveals how the city's architecture was shaped by various historical events, including the Latin Conquest and the Ottoman conquest. The study also discusses the transformation of Constantinople's urban landscape post-conquest, particularly under the Ottoman rule, highlighting changes in housing styles and urban development. This research offers a nuanced understanding of the architectural and urban evolution of Constantinople in the Late Byzantine and passage to early Ottoman periods."
