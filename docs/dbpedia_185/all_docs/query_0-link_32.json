The few studies that examine Ottoman political vocabulary (rather than language) in the nineteenth century focus on the period after the proclamation of the Imperial Rescript of Gülhane (1839) (Aymes 2010: 13-57; Doganalp-Votzi 2002; Doganalp-Votzi, Römer 2009; Reinkowski 2005 and 2012 [2005]; Römer 2002; Strauss 2006; Turan 2007: 169-170, 180). While the three studies published by the Center for Turkish, Ottoman, Balkan and Central Asian Studies (CETOBAC) have made a significant contribution to our knowledge of Turkish and Ottoman political vocabulary, none of them deals with the political language of the pre-Tanzimat period (Georgeon 1999; 2012a and 2012b). Among the two precursor studies on Muslim political vocabulary, Bernard Lewis’ book rather focuses on earlier eras and a few semantic fields. Although interesting in itself, it is not of much help for the period under scrutiny here (Lewis 1988). That of Ami Ayalon provides a stimulating analysis of modern political vocabulary in Arabic, however it does not deal with Ottoman Turkish (Ayalon 1987).\n\n2I will begin with a historiographical overview of the official gazette and continue with observations on the political context within which it appeared and the “public” targeted by this new endeavor. I will draw on the theoretical contributions of various approaches such as historical semantics (Koselleck 1997; 2005; Escudier 2009), historical philosophy (Binoche 2012), semiology (Barthes 1978; 1984), the history of political thought (Skinner 1999; 2018), the history of discourse (Guilhaumou 2017), the socio-history of language (Noiriel 1995) and the linguistic history of conceptual usages (Guilhaumou 2006; 2000), as well as engaging with the first attempts at theoretical debate on the scope and limits of these different approaches to Ottoman studies (Karabıçak 2020; Topal, Wigen 2019; Zemmin 2019; Sariyannis 2016). Throughout the article, I will examine the gazette’s terminology to show that the concept of the “public” existed under various terms at the time in the Ottoman political thought. After a brief presentation of the content of the official gazette, I will zoom in on one of the semantic fields that shapes political language: the vocabulary of the reform. More concretely, I will reflect on how we could better formulate the transformations in the 1830s from the perspective of their lexical, rhetorical and temporal features. Finally, I will conclude with five methodological observations drawn from this ongoing investigation based on the first 86 issues of Takvîm-i vekayi and Le Moniteur Ottoman (October 1831 to August 1834).\n\nState of the art on the official Ottoman gazette\n\n4The first comprehensive book-length study was conducted by Orhan Koloğlu, a specialist in the history of the Ottoman press. He analyzes the emergence of Takvîm-i vekayi by putting it in its political context and looks at its materiality (dimensions, price, periodicity, circulation, typography), its managers (director, editors, translators, those in charge of publishing in languages other than Turkish) and its content. The study, which is essentially based on the official gazette itself, is pioneering and teeming with information. However, Koloğlu remains largely descriptive and lacks critical distance from the political discourse relayed by the official gazette (Koloğlu [1981]). In another book, Koloğlu compares Takvîm-i vekayi with its Egyptian counterpart, a bilingual Turkish-Arabic organ, Vekayi-i mısriyye [The Events of Egypt] (Koloğlu 1989). He focuses on a polemic between the two gazettes between 1831 and 1833, a polemic which takes place in the context of the first Ottoman-Egyptian war, dealing with the political legitimacy and efficiency of the Ottoman sultan and the governor of Egypt. As one of the rare works devoted to the Vekayi-i mısriyye, it provides a good comparative perspective for the analysis of these two official newspapers. The third book, which is entirely devoted to Takvîm-i vekayi, transcribes a number of archival documents and very briefly evokes the political context in which this new institution appears (Yazıcı 1983). However, the contents of the official gazette are hardly touched upon.\n\n5Three articles should also be mentioned to conclude this historiographical overview. The most recent study devoted to the official gazette is by Hakan T. Karateke, who classifies Takvîm-i vekayi as a “contemporary chronicle.” He argues that the gazette is in continuity with the tradition of writing official history, while also being novel since it recounts events that are contemporaneous (Karateke 2015). The second article is devoted — in part — to the stylistic aspects of the gazette’s journalistic language; an important contribution to the historiography (Römer 2002) and one of the sources that inspired my study. The last article is authored again by Orhan Koloğlu and deals with the Western concepts and terms that are introduced into the Ottoman language through the official gazette and other Turkish-language newspapers (Koloğlu 1994).\n\n6This relative lack of historiographical interest is even more pronounced with Le Moniteur Ottoman. To date, only three studies exist, all by Orhan Koloğlu (1986, 1991, 1992) on this French edition of the gazette, which has 106 issues published over almost five years (November 1831 - June 1836). Worse still, the Greek, Armenian, Arabic and Persian versions have not been studied to date, except for a few notes by an amateur historian published in a short daily newspaper article in the early 1940s (Gerçek [1941-1945]: 110-121).\n\n7To sum up, despite some works published for the most part several decades ago, the Takvîm-i vekayi and its French version Le Moniteur Ottoman remain mostly neglected historical sources. Likely considered by historians as a mere official bulletin, a bulletin of laws — which it is not at all in reality — it is hardly analyzed and rarely exploited in works on the intellectual history of the nineteenth century. Even in recent serious studies on the period, it is possible to find passing remarks such as, “Takvîm-i vekayi mainly delivered state-related news in the most mundane manner and it is certainly not the most interesting read for Ottoman historians” (Şimşek 2015: 51). While the example may seem anecdotal, it is, unfortunately, a topos of contemporary Ottoman historiography. Even today, few historians use the official gazette as a source, whereas its study is, on the contrary, of the greatest importance for historians interested in the real and discursive construction of the Ottoman New Order, which crystallized in 1839 with the proclamation of the Imperial Rescript of Gülhâne.\n\n8In fact, it is a written corpus containing a large number of texts that express a collective political thought in the making, through conceptual and terminological fumbling. Spanning several tumultuous episodes, from the turn of the 19th century to the 1830s, this new political thought and language, which can be traced back to the reformism of the time of Selim III (r. 1789-1807), matured over more or less forty years (Karal 1988 [1946]; Beydilli 1999; Şakul 2005; Kenan 2010; Çağman 2010; Yaycıoğlu 2018). It is the linguistic expression of a new paradigm of the relationship between political authority and the people over whom it wields power. It is a political thought that, beginning in 1826 when the Janissary Corps was abolished, gradually bore a new configuration of power and, inevitably, a new discourse that framed it.\n\nWhat does the official gazette aim to do?\n\n9Islam had a central place in this new configuration. Or rather, Islam was vested with a new mission by the authority in the process of building a new socio-political order (Varol 2013; Yıldız 2009). This process is documented by the gazette, which was created precisely to establish a textual field that elaborates and disseminates this collective political thought in motion. The sultan and his entourage deployed an Islamic rhetoric in the service of a vast reform project that aimed to atomize and disintegrate the various elements that make up the society in order to discipline, standardize, and unify them. There was, so to speak, no liberal aim or perspective at play, contrary to Orhan Koloğlu’s interpretation (Koloğlu [1981]). It was rather an attempt at “self-colonization for self-empowerment” (Şiviloğlu 2018: 60). The conception of the state that is inherent in the centralizing reforms as described in the official gazette was indeed close to that of Prussian cameralism and far from that of Humboldt’s liberalism. In other words, it involved a police state, not a state of law (Laborier 1999: 25-27).\n\n10Concretely speaking, since the early 1820s, Mahmud II’s rule had been going through a crisis of political legitimacy linked to three concomitant and partially connected factors. The first was nationalist ideas, chiefly that of equality, which emerged from political modernity in Europe and which shook the paradigm of relations between state and population by crystallizing in the Ottoman Empire through the Greek revolution (Ilıcak 2011; Erdem 2005 and 2011). The second was the centralizing policies launched by Mahmud II (r. 1808-1839), which upset the foundations of the Ottoman Ancien Régime, of which the abolition of the Janissaries was the most decisive part. The final factor was the threat posed by Mehmed Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt (Abu-Manneh 2010).\n\n4 The transliteration of this text is provided by Nesim Yazıcı (1983: 162-164). The emphasis is mine.\n\nlâkin vekayi‘-i kevniye vuku‘u zamânında neşr ü ilân olunmayub da esbâb-ı hakikiyesi mektûm kaldığı sûrette insânın tabîatı el-mer’ü adüvvün limâ cehilehû kaidesince hakikat ve aslını bilmediği şey‘e dahl ü i‘tirâz etmek üzere mecbûl olmağla zuhûr bulan mesâlih-i dâhiliye ve hâriciye-i devlet-i ‘âliyeye ve tebdîlât-ı menâsıba ve sâir hall ü akde erkân-ı devletin hayâl ü hâtırına gelmemiş muammâ beyti gibi dürlü dürlü ma‘nâlar verirler [...] devlet-i ‘âliyede vuku‘ bulan mesâlih-i dâhiliye ve hâriciye vekayi‘i birikdirilmeyüb esbâb-ı hakikiye ve icâbât-ı zarûriyesini beyân sûretiyle fi-l-hâl neşr birle halka tefhîm olundukda umûr-ı vâkıaya herkes hakikati üzere kesb-i ıttılâ edüb evvelki gibi ba‘zıları vehmince birer ma‘nâ vererek vâki‘in hilâfı havâdis şüyû‘yla düşdükleri ızdırâbdan kurtılacakları bedîhî olduğundan...\n\n5 All translations are mine unless otherwise stated.\n\nAnd yet, when world events are not published at the time they occur, and their true causes remain unknown, in accordance with the saying that man’s nature is to deal with things he does not know and to oppose them, people interpret the internal and external affairs of the sublime state, as well as changes in appointments and promotions and the management of other affairs, attributing to them various meanings as if they were cryptic poems, with enigmatic meanings that the great dignitaries of the state could not have imagined [...] instead of amassing them, if the internal and external affairs of the sublime state were published immediately, explaining to the people their true causes, circumstances and necessities behind them, it is clear that everyone would be able to learn about past events in a proper way, and thus, it would be possible to avoid that everyone, as was the case before, could interpret them as they wished, thus succumbing to the confusion of making news that does not correspond with the facts.\n\n12The language of the preamble, which was written by the editor Esad Efendi (1789-1848) and read and edited by the sultan himself (Yazıcı 1983: 83), is relatively simple for its time. If one adopts the tripartite division proposed by the eminent Ottoman and Turkish literary historian Fahir İz to classify pre-Tanzimat Ottoman prose according to the stylistic complexity of a text, it can be classified as intermediate or medium prose, situated between simple and ornate prose (Flemming 2018 [1973]: 62-63). The skillful use of argumentative connectors (lâkin: “yet”), of a mediating marker like “in accordance with the saying” (kaidesince, literally “according to the rule”), or impersonal enunciation by using the present tense for a general truth (bedîhî olduğundan: “it is clear that”) reminds us that the text bears the mark of a centuries-old scribal writing tradition. Also noteworthy is the use of a temporal marker (evvelki gibi: “as was the case before”), which at first glance is trivial but marks a break with past usage. I will come back to this last point concerning temporality below.\n\n13This preamble thus clearly announces the purpose of the official gazette: to assume a monopoly over the formation of public opinion, a concept to which I will return below. The fact that the term hakikat (truth) repeats itself three times in this short passage is significant. The political authority was thus preparing to manufacture one official truth to promote, no longer leaving everyone the liberty of commenting on public affairs. In other words, it was not a question of “public opinion that must enlighten the despot” nor of “public opinion as emanating reason” but of public opinion as orthodoxy, as public doctrine (Binoche 2012: 101, 136 and 139). To speak like Bourdieu, the palace aims to “state the truth of particular truths which is simply the truth” (Bourdieu 2012: 71). In this sense, it would ve useful to recall that before the launch of the official gazette, among the titles proposed by the sultan’s entourage were ıslâh-ı zünûn (the rectification of conjectures) and def‘-i şübehât (the elimination of doubts) (Yazıcı 1983: 41-44, 69). The palace thus had a very particular function in mind for this new institution, the official gazette. Among the bureaucratic correspondence prior to the launch of this periodical, one even speaks of the “new advantages of easily exciting public opinion about blessed affairs” (mâdde-i hayriye üzerine kolaylıkla i‘tikad-ı ‘âmmenin tehâlükü fevâid-i cedîdesi) to “win the hearts” (isticlâb-ı kulûblerini mûcib) of the population (ahâlî) (Yazıcı 1983: 73-74).\n\nfi-l-hakika mültezem-i pâdişâhî olan nizâmât-ı hasenenin lüzûmu ve hayriyeti memâlik-i mahrûse-i vâsiasında mevcûd mecmû‘ ahâlînin ukulüne te’sîr ve tavâif-i halkın efkârını iknâ ve tevfîk ve te’lîf edinceye kadar ba‘zı eşhâsın agrâz-ı mahsûsalarına dokunmamak ve irâde-i katıa ve gayret-i salâbet-i nâfia-i pâdişâhî karşısında aceze makulesinden ba‘zı muhâlîfîn zuhûr etmemek mümkün değil idi (Takvîm-i vekayi 3, 1831: 2-3, emphasis mine).\n\n8 To make it easier to read, I added punctuation that does not appear in the original.\n\nIt is true, until the necessity and the soundness of the advantegous regulations desired by the sultan are inculcated in the minds of all the populations of his vast and well-protected domains, until the opinions of all parties of the people are convinced, harmonized, and reconciled, it was impossible not to distrupt the particular interests of some; and in the face of the soundness of the beneficent efforts and the unshakeable will of the sultan, it was impossible that a few ignorant opponents would not manifest themselves (Türesay 2020: 273) .\n\n15This passage shows that a concept can indeed exist and be expressed in the absence of a specific term that describes it exclusively. There was not yet a fixed term for “public opinion” in the Ottoman language, but the idea could be expressed in various ways. This challenges the general agreement in the literature, which traces the emergence of this notion to 1860s. Moreover, these references to the idea of public opinion are not the first of their kind in Ottoman history. The author of the said preamble, Esad Efendi, who was none other than the official chronicler of the empire since 1825, had already mentioned the idea in 1828 in his work Üss-i Zafer (the Foundations of Victory). In this work, he celebrates the abolition of the Janissaries by claiming that the decision “had been taken based on the unity of hearts and by reaching a consensus of opinion” (ittihâd-ı kulûb ve ittifâk-ı ârâ-i hulûs-ı mashûba makrûn). In 1833, when the orientalist Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval (1795-1871) translated this work into French, he naturally chose to interpret this sentence as “public opinion” (Şiviloğlu 2018: 10). It is worth digressing here to see whether, beyond the idea of public opinion, the concept of the “public” is present in the official gazette. To do this, we must begin with a review of a very contemporary testimony.\n\nThe “public” of the official gazette: a chimera?\n\n16In Paris on November 4, 1831, a few days after the publication of the first issue of Takvîm-i vekayi, Pierre-Amédée Jaubert (1779-1847) captured his reflections on the progress of education in Istanbul in a memoir he would read to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. He had joined the academy one year before and would later become a professor at the Collège de France and the École des langues orientales. His observations evoke the still nascent print culture in the imperial capital in the following terms:\n\nOf all the means likely to achieve the proposed goal, the printing press would undoubtedly be the most powerful; but the public (if one can use this expression, which has no exact equivalent in the oriental languages) does not grasp its importance, and the government rejects its use (Jaubert 1835: 147-148, emphasis added).\n\n17Coming from a scholar of his stature, this unequivocal assertion certainly deserves to be taken seriously: the expression “public” would thus have no equivalent, in 1831, in oriental languages. After all, why would it? The “public” is not a universal or timeless category, but a social and political construct that must be understood in its historicity. Nevertheless, consulting the dictionaries of the time does not quite prove him right.\n\n18Respecting a chronological framework, we begin with Artin Hindoglu’s Dictionnaire abrégé français-turc. The author was an Armenian born in Kütahya in 1780 who, after living in Istanbul for ten years, moved to Vienna in 1813 where he worked as an interpreter for the imperial court. Since he lived in Vienna when he published his Turkish dictionary in 1831, we could deduce that the dictionary more or less reflects the state of the Turkish language as it was practiced in daily life in Istanbul in the years 1800-1810. Conversely, we could also assume that his dictionary reflects the ideas that Hindoglu picked up in Vienna and tried to translate into Turkish. In any case, I underline the fact that this dictionary reflects the vernacular and it must be distinguished from other dictionaries cited below that deal with a rather sustained and bookish Turkish. Hindoglu has two entries for the term “public”, the first for the adjectival form, the second for the noun and adverb (Hindoglu 1831: 444):\n\nPublic, que, a. ach-(éch)kiaré; belli.\n\nPublic, m. qhalk; en —, ad. ach-(éch)kiaré.\n\nPublic, a. ach-(éch)kiaré; belli.\n\nPublic, m. qhalk; in -, ad. ach-(éch)kiaré.\n\n19Note that the two terms aşikâre and belli mean “obvious” and refer directly to the idea of “publicity” (as opposed to secrecy) in the dictionary entry. Also note, more importantly, that according to this lexicographer, in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, one could therefore think of translating the concept of “public” into Turkish by halk, which today means “people.” Naturally, we find this term a few years later, in 1835, in the first volume of the Dictionnaire turc-français by J.D. Kieffer and T. X. Bianchi (Kieffer, Bianchi, I, 1835: 483):\n\nkhalq, s. a. 1. Créatures. 2. Hommes. 3. Nation, peuple. 4. Populace. khalquñ dilindè. Dans le langage du peuple.\n\nkhalq, s. a. 1. Beings. 2. Men. 3. Nation, people. 4. Populace. khalquñ dilindè. In the language of the people.\n\n20It should be noted that the term halk has a social connotation; namely populace, which is illustrated by its fourth meaning and the example given. Handjéri’s dictionary joins its predecessors when it reads, “Public, au substantif, se prend pour tout le peuple en général: halk [...] Il fut défrayé aux dépens du public: filânın masârifi halkın sırtından çıkdı Que dit-on dans le public? nâs beyninde ne söyleniyor Se sacrifier pour le public: halk uğruna fedâ-i nefs etmek” or, “Public, in the noun form, is understood as the people in general: halk [...] It was paid at the expense of the public: filânın masârifi halkın sırtından çıkdı What is said in public? nâs beyninde ne söyleniyor Sacrificing oneself for the public: halk uğruna fedâ-i nefs etmek” (Handjéri, III, 1841: 248-249).\n\n22In the 1810s, the root ‘âmm was commonly used in Ottoman in its adjectival form in expressions such as menâfi‘-i ‘âmme (versus menâfi‘-i mahsûsa) or menfaat-i ‘âmme which can be translated as general/public benefit or general/public interest. These expressions can be found in the historical writings of the official chronicler Şânîzâde (circa 1770-1826) (Şânî-zâde 2008 [1819-1825]: 38, 144; Şiviloğlu 2018: 124) as well as in the examples provided in the “Public” entry of the Handjéri dictionary (Handjéri, III, 1841: 248-249).\n\n23This sense of the general/public interest is captured by the reformer Keçecizâde İzzet Molla (1786-1829), a renowned poet and father of Mehmed Fuad Pasha (1814-1869), an emblematic figure of the Tanzimat. In an 1827 memorandum on the administrative reorganization of the Ottoman Empire, Keçecizâde makes a clear distinction between state interest and general/public interest by opposing one another: hem menfaat-i mîrî mütâlaa olunub hem menâfî‘-i ‘âmme düşünülerek, in other words, “taking into consideration both state interest and general/public interest” (Doğan 2000: 48). I will return to this distinction when I discuss the terms mîrî and mülk(î).\n\n24For now, let us elaborate on this distinction between the sphere of the “state” and that of the “public.” I argue that there was a specific distinction in the Ottoman Empire during the 1830s, where the “public” domain is the domain of the administration and the state, or rather of the “governors,” as opposed to that of “society” — “civil” or not — in other words that of the “governed.” In trying to understand the origin of “public,” we can take the word here as a conceptual construction by the ruling elite, and precisely as an amorphous, ambiguous, abstract entity, different from the people. This is a reflection based on the intuitive remarks by the Şerif Mardin, an authority on the nineteenth-century Ottoman intellectual history, in the early 2000s:\n\nBoth the complaints of Sultan Selim III and the protests of his successor, Mahmud II, show an unfocused search for a unifying principle among officials to provide more permanence than a contract of allegiance to the sultan. I claim that this new focus — as a stand-in for the corporate personality of the state — was built gradually and closely involved changes in language policies that had created a succession of new discourses. These changes also amounted to the elaboration of a “public sphere,” an ideological field still missing at the beginning of the Ottoman nineteenth century. Each step in this progression had the tacit implication of a minute change in the conceptualization of society. Across decades, the accumulation of these discourses brought out more clearly new conceptions of an Ottoman public (Mardin 2006: 127-128).\n\n26There is an adjectival use of this term in constructions like ‘âmme-i halk, ‘âmme-i nâs, ‘âmme-i ulemâ, ‘âmme-i havâss ü avâm; that is, respectively, ‘the whole of the people,’ ‘the whole of the people/the common people,’ ‘the whole of the ulemas,’ and ‘the whole of the elites and the populace.’ When it refers to the subject in a sentence, it can often be translated as “everyone:” ‘âmmenin ma‘lûmudur; that is, “everyone knows it” (Kieffer, Bianchi, II, 1837: 225) or, as the official chronicler Esad Efendi writes, ‘âmmenin meşhûdudur, or “everyone attests to it” (Sahhâflar 2000 [1826-?]: 73). In brief, in its substantive form, the word ‘âmme has a meaning that is not very far from that of ‘public,’ which Kieffer and Bianchi define as ‘People, universality, community’ in their dictionary (Kieffer, Bianchi, II, 1837: 225). This term is also frequently referenced in the entry “Public” in the Handjéri dictionary cited above.\n\nCeux des membres de la diète qui, par faiblesse ou par peur, sans avoir proposé ni appuyé l’acte de déchéance du 13-25 janvier, l’ont cependant accepté et signé, jouiront des effets généraux de l’amnistie, en s’engageant toutefois par écrit à ne se charger à l’avenir d’aucun emploi public, à moins que leur conduite ultérieure ne leur ait mérité de nouveau la confiance du gouvernement.\n\n13 This refers to the proclamation of Polish independence and the deposition of Tsar Nicholas I by the (...)\n\nThose members of the Diet who, out of weakness or fear, without having proposed or supported the act of deposition of January 13-25 , have nevertheless accepted and signed it, will enjoy the amnesty, while committing themselves in writing not to take up any public sector employment in the future, unless their subsequent conduct has again earned them the confidence of the government (Le Moniteur Ottoman 9, 1831, emphasis added).\n\n29This expression “public sector employment” is translated by the Takvîm-i vekayi as “mansab ve hıdmet-i mîrîye tâlib olmayacaklarını” (Takvîm-i vekayi 9, 1832, emphasis added). Kieffer and Bianchi underline in their dictionary that is contemporary to our sources that mîrî means “1. adj. p. Appartenant au prince, au chef de l’état (sic), ou au fisc. 2. Subs. Fisc, trésor public” or, “1. adj. p. Belonging to the prince, to the head of the state, or to the tax authority. 2. Subs. Tax authority, public treasury” (Kieffer, Bianchi, II, 1837: 1066). Handjéri defines “public sector employment” as hidemât-ı devlet but also “public buildings” as ebniye-i mîriye / ‘âmmeye mütehassıs imâretler and “public revenues” as vâridât-ı mîriye / vâridât-ı ‘âmme (Handjéri, III, 1841: 248). Kieffer and Bianchi also note that mîrîye kabz etmek means “to confiscate.” Today, in our political configurations of nation-states, we would say “nationalize.” Contrary to French, modern Turkish clearly preserves the trace of this semantic overlap between “state” and “public” that emerged in the 1830s. In modern Turkish, we say devletleştirme for the nationalization of a company, of an institution providing services of a “public” nature, and kamulaştırma for the confiscation that transforms a private good into a public good. In other words, while today a nuance still exists in modern Turkish to distinguish what is “state” from what is “public,” the term mîrî can cover, depending on the case, these two distinct but also fairly close concepts. Semantically, we are certainly not far from “public,” given that the context is a patrimonial political configuration where the country is, in principle and as a last resort, the property of the sultan.\n\n31Here, we must digress to a term that is conspicuous in its virtual absence in the official gazette. Besides ‘âmme, there is another term that one would expect to find more often in the pages of Takvîm-i vekayi’ to designate the “public:” cumhûr. In 1835, Kieffer and Bianchi defined it as follows:\n\n1. Majorité. 2. Tous. 3. République, états. — umouri djumhour. Affaires publiques. — tâtâr djumhouri. Les états généraux des Tatars, qui se tenaient en Crimée, même du temps des khans.\n\n1. Majority. 2. All. 3. Republic, states. — umouri djumhour. Public affairs. — tâtâr djumhouri. The general states of the Tatars, which were held in the Crimea, even during the time of the khans. (Kieffer, Bianchi, I, 1835: 392).\n\n32While this term is found a dozen times in the pages of Takvîm-i vekayi, it refers to, with two exceptions, the “republic” (cumhûr and cumhûriyet) and its partisans (cumhûr taraftarları or cânibdârân-ı cumhûriyet) in the contemporary political context of Europe. The two times it is used in the sense of “public,” it is simply part of a prefabricated linguistic construction. This long and preformed title of the sultan appears in the preamble of two of his orders addressed to the commander of the Ottoman armies in the middle of a military campaign against the Egyptian armies (Takvîm-i vekayi 20 and 36, 1832). This multi-line title reads that the sultan, among others, is the one who makes decisions (müdîr and müdebbir) concerning umûr-ı cumhûr, which can be translated as “public affairs” (for a similar usage in a late eighteenth-century reform treaty, see Karateke 2019: 430). Meninski’s dictionary, first published in 1680, translates umûr-ı cumhûr as “Affari publici, di stato, ò della Republica” (Meninski 2000 [1680], I: 1655). This is a lato sensu use of the term that is rather exceptional given that its restricted meaning is more often used in Ottoman chronicles and treatises. The seventeenth-century polymath Kâtib Çelebi (1609-1657), for example, sometimes uses it in the sense of a “body established by the pillars of the state and other notables [that] claims to represent the general will” (Vatin, Veinstein 2003: 197-199, 208).\n\n33One could try to explain the relative absence of this term in relation to the widespread use of the word ‘âmme in the official gazette by pointing to the predominance of its restricted meaning, which refers to an intermediate authority between the sovereign and the masses that represents the latter. Such a hypothesis is certainly tempting. However, elsewhere, the same Kâtib Çelebi uses umûr-ı cumhûr and umûr-ı devlet interchangeably. Thus, we see once again that the concepts of public and state can be intertwined in Ottoman political thought. Beyond this observation, we should recall here the warning of Marinos Sariyannis, who notes that the term cumhûr is indeed polysemic and therefore difficult to translate into a single term (Sariyannis 2013: 102-103).\n\n34Returning to the “public” in Takvîm-i vekayi, we find another translation of this concept in a speech that the British king had addressed to parliament in October 1831:\n\nI have the satisfaction of reflecting that these demands have been provided for without any material addition to the public burthens (The Journals [1832]: 935, emphasis added).\n\n35Here is the translation:\n\nişbu masârif-i zarûriyenin tedâriki fukarâ ve zuafâya pek ağır bir yük olmayarak görülegeldiğinden gayet memnûn oldum (Takvîm-i vekayi 4, 1831, emphasis added).\n\n38To conclude on the concept of “public” in the official gazette, below are a few more examples:\n\nTakvîm-i vekayi 11: menâfi‘-i ‘âmme maksâdına mebnî which is translated in Le Moniteur Ottoman 11 as “un projet d’utilité publique” or “a project of public utility”\n\nTakvîm-i vekayi 11: fâide-i ‘âmme which is rendered in Le Moniteur Ottoman 12 as “but d’utilité publique” or “a purpose of public utility”\n\nTakvîm-i vekayi 20: alenen kırâat olunması which Le Moniteur Ottoman 20 translates as “La lecture de ces documens (sic) devant avoir lieu dans une audience publique...” or “The reading of these documents which must have a public hearing...”\n\nTakvîm-i vekayi 54: mütâlaa-i ‘âmme and i‘tikad-ı ‘âmme, two expressions translated by Alexandre Blacque in Le Moniteur Ottoman 62 respectively as “l’opinion européenne” and “mœurs publiques” or “European opinion” and “public morals”\n\nTakvîm-i vekayi 59: selâmet-i ‘âmme to translate the expression “public salvation” regarding the Frankfurt revolts;\n\nTakvîm-i vekayi 85: Gizo nâm ta‘lîm ve terbiye-i ‘âmme umûrunun vekili corresponding to “the appointed Guizot who is the minister of public education.”\n\n39While the editors and translators of the official gazette use several terms in substantive and adjectival form to describe the concept of the “public,” that of ‘âmme clearly predominates. It is also clear that this concept is an integral part of their political thought. The existence of the official gazette is the result of such a situation. In his thesis, Cengiz Kırlı underlines what is at stake:\n\nthe discovery of public opinion was neither a simple recognition of the existence of the populace, nor was the public visibility of the Sultan, as an important instance in the discovery of public, an inconsequential ceremonial activity. The discovery of public opinion was in fact the redefinition of the public sphere: it was no longer merely a normatively defined moral sphere in which the populace should be kept aloof from politics and submit their loyalty to their rulers. It was redefined as an actual political sphere where the populace and their opinions emerged as legitimate forces in the business of governance (Kırlı 2000: 272).\n\n40The official gazette was launched precisely in order to shape popular opinion (see my comments on elsine-i nâs above) and to render it favorable to the reforms launched. While the gazette was originally intended to consolidate the ability of the central political authority to act and mobilize, a few decades later it would paradoxically contribute to the reverse. The new social and discursive category that it helped construct — the public — would be manipulated skillfully by the first Ottoman journalists, most notably İbrahim Şinasi (1826-1871) and Namık Kemal (1840-1888), and would quickly escape political control as early as the mid-1860s (Şiviloğlu 2018). In other words, the 1860s witnessed a historical phenomenon that considerably affected how the political system would evolve: “the ‘public’ dissociated itself from the state and invented itself as a subject” (Binoche 2012: 8). However, we are still only at the beginning of the 1830s. The official gazette contained numerous texts on political pedagogy that reflected the ruling class’s conviction of the need to publicize ongoing reforms and desire to explain them to the public. Besides these texts, it also includes short conclusions, sometimes called “lessons” (tenbîh), which follow certain accounts and synthesize in a very concise and pedagogical manner the lessons to be learned from what has just been recounted.\n\n41This willingness to advertise the reforms by explaining them pedagogically resembles Necker’s policy during the twilight years of the Ancien Régime (Minard 2009: 9). To be clear, I am not implying here a Western influence in Ottoman political thought: the similarity in the practices likely results from isomorphism. Just as Necker reacted to Turgot’s failed experiment, Mahmud II also drew lessons from the crushing defeat of his predecessor Selim III’s nizâm-ı cedîd in order to avoid losing the battle of public opinion. Hence, he packed his punch with a new instrument that would resist manipulation by any protean opposition — the official gazette — at the same time a pedagogical tool under palace control.\n\n43This, however, does not mean that the political authority was able to achieve its goal of forming one well-controlled public opinion within the well-protected domains of the sultan. While it seems, according to current research on Mahmud’s rule, that this achievement leaves something to be desired, it is nevertheless clear that the intention existed. Such an intention in itself signals an important paradigm shift, the nature of which is eloquently summarized by the quote from Cengiz Kırlı’s thesis given above.\n\nThe content of the official gazette: form and substance\n\n44Let us now present the contents of the official gazette for a holistic view. While it might seem like a digression that strays from the main purpose of the article, we must remind ourselves that the topic examined here is in fact part of a much broader textual field. In order to offer a reflection that pays attention to detail and subtle variation, I choose to investigate here not only micro-diachronics over a few years (1831-1834), but also a single semantic field — the vocabulary of reform — which assumes its full meaning within the more overarching political language of the gazette.\n\n45First, a few words on form. What are the headings in the gazette? How do these headings appear in the layout? The headings of the official gazette gradually develop over the first few issues. The first issue has only three headings: internal affairs (umûr-ı dâhiliye), military topics (mevâdd-ı askeriye) and external affairs (umûr-ı hâriciye). Besides these three fixed headings, the second issue occasionally adds the science and arts (fünûn), but few new publications are announced. Another occasional rubric appears as of the fifth issue: appointments in religious careers (tevcîhât-ı ilmiye). Commerce and production (ticâret ve es’âr) appear for the first time in the same issue and soon becomes a fixed heading under the title of “productions.” These headings, which thus appear in the first five issues, are printed in much larger typeface from the sixth issue onwards, distinguishing themselves in the layout from the rest of the body text.\n\n46While these headings provide some idea of the formal and emic classification of the topics covered by the gazette, they do not say much about its content. In the first 86 issues of the official gazette, two topics predominate: the sultan and the conflict with Mehmed Ali of Egypt. The first issues are presented as Mahmud II’s “public” journal; the official gazette essentially does his promotion. He is evoked at length through his travels, visits, administrative and military inspections, ceremonies, activities during Ramadan, feasts, exploits as an archer, and miraculous powers (kerâmet). These texts constitute an invaluable source for analyzing the construction of Mahmud II’s public image as a modern, modest and omnipresent sovereign, a topic that deserves treatment in more detail in another study.\n\n47In Ottoman historiography there is a tendency to assume that official texts relating to civil administration (appointments and dismissals; granting of imperial orders and decorations; decrees and orders of the sultan; promotions; degradations; decisions of exile, amnesty, and retirement), military affairs (promotions and appointments; movement of troops; logistics and supply; authorization, expulsion, and amnesty; military exercises) or ulema affairs (promotions and appointments) are less interesting sources for research in intellectual history or the history of concepts. However, it must be noted that even such types of text are likely to contain passages that are discursively revealing. Indeed, these texts often contain short didactic digressions on recent or ongoing reforms and reorganizations. When they do not contain such digressions, they occasionally end with a short conclusion in an overtly didactic tone. These use inductive reasoning by going from the particular to the general to state precisely what lesson should be drawn from the recounted anecdote. It is here that one can find the most captivating discursive snippets.\n\n48As for the accounts relating to non-Muslim communities (permission for the repair of places of worship; restitution of confiscated real estate; appreciation of the sultan by the communities) or to the numerous revolts (in Van, Baghdad, Shkodër, Damascus, Bosnia) and notably to the preparation for war against Mehmed Ali, they contain long passages that are instructive for the questions of concern here. These texts mobilize the entire lexico-conceptual arsenal of a semantic field. Maurus Reinkowski partly analyzed this semantic field in a short chapter of his book on a bureaucratic correspondence from 1840-1860 about North Albania and Mount Lebanon (Reinkowski 2012 [2005]: 228-242); as did Marc Aymes in his book on the application of the Tanzimat in Cyprus from 1840-1850 (Aymes 2010: 3-57). Reinkowski and Aymes’s examinations of syntagmatic groups, when compared with these texts of the Takvîm-i vekayi, reveal variations that indicate a certain evolution in the matter, a topic which I will deal with in another article. Other texts that deal with public works, the restoration of public monuments, pious foundations and fires may also occasionally contain interesting elements. The concept of public health, which was just beginning to emerge at the time, also appears in a few texts (the foundation of a school for surgery and the translation of a French treatise on cholera). Finally, the numerous translations by European newspapers on European current events are particularly interesting, primarily from the angle of the lexicon of political modernity and reform.\n\nTalking about reform\n\n49Reading Takvîm-i vekayi, one feels that the editors are incessantly trying to explain how the state apparatus had been reorganized since 1826. Their hesitation and fumbling — more terminological than conceptual — must be underlined, as well as the resulting lexical multiplicity manifested in these texts. What are these terms? As we shall see, they are not just individual words but, above all, syntagmatic groups of varying size. Even though translating them into English may not make much sense, I will give here a literal translation for those who are not familiar with the political language of the second half of the Mahmud II’s reign:\n\nnizâm: order, discipline\n\nnizâmât: regulations\n\nnizâmât-ı müstahsene: the great/good regulations\n\nnizâmât-ı behiye: the great/good regulations\n\nnizâmât-ı hayriye: the blessed regulations\n\nıslâh-ı umûr-ı mülk ve ibâd: the improvement of the administration of the country and the conditions of the people\n\nnizâmât-ı seniyye ve ıslâhât-ı mülkiye: imperial regulations and administrative reforms\n\nmesâlih-i mülkiye-i cihândârîlerinin vech-i hüsn ve nesak-ı müstahsen üzere tanzîmi: the proper organization of administrative affairs according to the proper methods\n\nnizâmât-ı müstahsene-i mülkdârî-raiyyet-perverî: the great regulations by the sultan generous to his subjects\n\nhüsn-i nizâm ve usûl-i tedâbîr-i hasene-i mülkiye: good order and good administrative policies\n\nel-yevm cârî olan usûl-i adâlet ve nizâm: the procedures of justice and organization that are currently in force\n\nân-be-ân icrâsına muvâfık oldukları usûl-i hayriye: the beneficent rules that His Highness is currently implementing\n\nnev-be-nev icrâ buyurmakta oldukları usûl-i hayriye ve niyyât-ı müşfîkâne: the beneficent rules and benevolent intentions that His Highness is once again enacting\n\nusûl-i müstahsene-i nizâmiye: orderly good procedures\n\nusûl-i nizâm-ı dâhilî: the rules of internal organization\n\nusûl-i müstahsene-i adl ü dâd: the proper and fair procedures\n\nusûl-i nizâmiye: orderly procedures\n\nnizâm-ı müstahsene-i seniye: the good imperial order\n\n50After a few years, and more precisely at the end of the 1830s, this lexical multiplicity can be summarized in a single word: Tanzimat. It is the plural of the action noun of the verb nazzama in Arabic, which is of the same trilateral root as nizâm, the term that indisputably dominates, at the beginning of the 1830s, this semantic field of “reform.” I will call this a terminological fixation resulting from a conceptual distillation, resembling the hypothesis put forward by Koselleck on the retrospective freezing of the Bündnisse (alliances) into a singular collective in the German language, the Bund (confederation) (Koselleck 1997). This “summarized an experience and conceptualized it in a single term. It is therefore — to put it more bluntly — a concept that register experience, nourished by a past reality which, in the aftermath of policymaking, could be transposed into the future where it continued to be inscribed” (Koselleck 2005: 324-325).\n\n52Two words predominate the semantic field in question: nizâm with a few of its grammatical derivations (nizâmât, nizâmiye, tanzîm) and usûl (manner, method, procedure, principle). These two terms often appear in the context of an associative relationship with a few positive qualifiers (hüsn, müstahsen, hasene / hayriye / behiye). It should be noted that the first three terms have the same Arabic root as the term istihsân, “juristic preference” in Islamic law, which is also an important concept in Ottoman political philosophy, whose translation into English would be “public well-being” (Sariyannis 2019: 445). The istihsân can be seen also as a “major avenue for a quiet introduction of socially desirable innovations” (Gerber 1999: 93). Another qualifier of the regulations/reforms, mülk and its adjectival form mülkiye, refers to administrative and political domains that are entirely linked at that epoch (Aymes 2019: 99-100 and 103). Note that a few decades later, the Imperial School of Public Administration, opened in 1859, would be called Mekteb-i fünûn-ı mülkiye-i şâhâne.\n\n53The prevailance of nizâm is unrivaled by any other term. Another term that will be widely used in Ottoman in the second half of the nineteenth century, that of ıslâh (Topal 2017: 147-148, 182), is rarely found in the pages of Takvîm-i vekayi. One encounters this term to describe the Mahmudian reforms twice in the same text (Takvîm-i vekayi 3, 1831; on this text see Türesay 2020). The term appears above all in European press translations of speeches by the British king on the constitutional reform process of 1832 that was then underway in England (Takvîm-i vekayi 13, 46, 56). It also appears more often in the common sense of the word; that is, the correction of deviations from the norm (Takvîm-i vekayi 3, 4, 5, 12, 25, 56, 67).\n\n54I have translated the term usûl in various ways because it is difficult to capture it in a single term in English. In fact, it is a term that has seen its meaning shift over the centuries, undergoing a kind of semantic debasement. This polysemic term had once meant “fundamental, essential principles” but also “method/procedure” and opposed the term tavr (form, structure) in reformist literature from previous centuries in order to defend the argument that one can change the form while remaining loyal to the principle and spirit of an old institution. However, once the reformist discourse finished of tavr, it took on usûl in the 1820s (Topal 2017: 122, 135). Keçecizâde provides an eloquent example of this in his memorandum quoted above — written in 1827: ta‘n olunacak usûldür, yohsa eşhâs değildir, or “what should be criticized are principles/methods and not persons.” Such is why he believes that any measure other than terk-i usûl (the abandonment of principles) would be a mistake (Doğan 2000: 51). Note that in this usage, the terme usûl could mean also “institution”.\n\n55In other words, for the reformist elite who gathered around Sultan Mahmud II, the principles/institutions were changing by the late 1820s. The term usûl thus appears in the official gazette with a meaning far removed from its former grandeur and inviolability, increasingly degraded to simply mean the new procedures and practices introduced by Mahmud II. Or, perhaps, could this interpretation be reversed, with the notion that Mahmud’s new administrative procedures and practices aspire to attain the status of immutable principles ans institutions that must not be touched? In my view, the two interpretations are hardly mutually exclusive. Marc Aymes’ analyses of the uses of the term usûl in the bureaucratic correspondence of the 1840s (Aymes 2010: 33-34, 40, 45) argue rather in favor of the latter.\n\n56Let us return to the first term, nizâm, because terminological continuity can sometimes conceal semantic change. The concept of order had long been central to Islamic political philosophy. Among the Ottomans, it is found notably in the expression nizâm-ı âlem, whose origin likely dates back to Persian political theory (Hagen 2005: 61). It can be translated as “(mankind’s) socio-political order” by emphasizing the social hierarchy that constituted one of the intellectual pillars of political philosophy and imperial cosmology (Görgün 2000; Ocak 2003: 84-85; Kara 2003a: 15, 34-35). In this sense, the concept also holds striking similarities with the Byzantine notion of taxiarchia (Sariyannis 2019: 448; Ragia 2016: 320). Following Gottfried Hagen, we should emphasize that behind a terminological continuity lies a strong semantic ambivalence that spans centuries. This observation must not be overlooked by contemporary historians, who often use retrospective intellectual construction to maintain an illusion of semantic continuity (Hagen 2005).\n\n57Still, this word and its derivations were used in the context of nizâm-ı cedîd (the new order) of Sultan Selim III and the post-1826 reforms, or Tanzimat, as well as the new courts established at the time, known as mahkeme-i nizâmiye. The thought behind nizâm-ı cedîd carries the ideas of discipline, good order, regularity, and instruction. Examples can be easily multiplied (Yeşil 2010: 163; Findley 1995a and 1995b). According to Marc Aymes, who refers to Redhouse’s dictionary, it can mean:\n\nIn the nineteenth-century usage: an alignment, a row; regularity; the very foundation of order; a system, a method; a law, a regulation, or a set of laws; and finally — recollecting the ‘new order’ (nizâm-ı cedîd) established in the Ottoman army at the time of Selim III — a corps of regular troops, or a soldier from such troops (Aymes 2010: 31).\n\n58Moreover, following the Ottoman example, the term was also used in the field of military reorganization and the founding of modern armies in several countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, and Iran (Cronin 2008; El-Tahir El-Mesawi 2008; Bennison 2004; Rollman 2004).\n\n59Nizâm is thus an ancestral term in Ottoman political language (Topal 2020) and dominated the semantic field of reformist thought until the last third of the nineteenth century. Omnipresent in the terminology of administrative reforms from the 1830s to the 1870s (Reinkowski 2005; Aymes 2010), it was also associated, for decades, with another word-concept that emerged in the official gazette in the early 1830s: “civilization.” By the mid-nineteenth century, the word medeniyet would be established as the standard translation of civilization. Let us return to nizâm: at first glance, then, does it qualify as a nice and long linear history of the terminological continuity of an elementary concept? As Quentin Skinner warns, “there cannot be a history of unit ideas as such, but only a history of the various uses to which they have been put by different agents at different times” (Skinner 1999: 62). To hammer this in: while there may be continuity in terminology, there is not necessarily a semantic essence that does not evolve.\n\n60Thus, the nizâm of the nizâm-ı âlem certainly does not have the same meaning as the nizâm of nizâm-ı cedîd. To borrow Minard’s distinction (Minard 2009: 8), while the former was used to invoke a “reform-reestablishment” calling for a return to a golden age, the latter refers rather to a future-oriented “reform-improvement.” Admittedly, this sense of improvement also derives from the use of the qualifier cedîd, which highlights and emphasizes novelty as much as order. Nevertheless, the tension between these two reformist ways of thinking about change runs through the whole spectrum of Ottoman intellectual history in the eighteenth century. The great defeat against Russia in the war of 1768-1774 marked a turning point that led a good part of the ruling elite to lean towards the second way (Menchinger 2017; Aksan 1995). While stressing that the term had long had a vague and wide-reaching content, Sariyannis suggests that nizâm was in the eighteenth century increasingly desacralized and its meaning restricted. During the time of Selim III, it would thus mean merely “military reorganization” (Sariyannis 2019: 448-449).\n\n61From a terminological point of view, nizâm and its derivations only lost their central place in Ottoman political discourse in the final decade of the nineteenth century, by which time two terms, terakki (progress) and ittihâd (union), were dominating this particular semantic field. It is significant, in this respect, that when the positivist Young Turk leader Ahmed Rıza proposed in 1894 to rename the Istanbul branch of the Committee of Ottoman Union (İttihâd-ı osmânî) founded in 1889 (Hanioğlu [1986]: 174-180) to Order and Progress (Nizâm ve Terakki), the former did not give in and preserved its name (Sohrabi 2011: 54) by privileging the concept of “union” and not that of “order.” Moreover, the idea of nizâm put forward by Ahmed Rıza was likely as much inspired by Comtean positivism as it was by the Ottoman tradition. This resembles how the uses and reappropriations of the term tamaddun evolved in the Arabic-speaking world during the nineteenth century. While at first glance, it leaves the impression of a continuity with classical Arab-Muslim thought, in reality it testifies to the profound impact of the modern idea of progress on contemporary Arab thought (Abu-‘Uksa 2019).\n\n62This anecdote reveals, in my opinion, an important turning point in the evolution of reformist political thought: over the nineteenth century, we observe a gradual shift from the aspiration to build a more integrated society, which begins with the nizâm-ı cedîd of Selim III, to the desire to build a society that is not only more integrated but also more unified, even if it means being homogenized. In other words, as the process of building a more integrated society is more or less achieved by these real but also imagined reforms that extend from 1826 to the 1870s, it gives way to a project of building a more homogeneous society, an even more integrative social organization. This reformist thought is increasingly emphasizing the human agency (irâde-i cüziye) to the detriment of the divine will (irâde-i külliye), the predominant factor until the 1790s in historical causality (Menchinger 2017: 56-58, 74-75, 195-196, 226-232, 238-239).\n\n63That said, the old meaning, while gradually being marginalized, persisted for a long time in a new semantic configuration, as we have just seen, in the 1830s. It is thus hardly surprising to find recurrent recourse to the word-concept of nizâm in the Ottoman intellectual field even after the Young Turk revolution (Türesay 2011). This means that terminological continuity and the absence of an absolute semantic continuity do not necessarily imply a radical semantic break. This type of situation leads to a multi-layered continuity: a term can thus have several meanings synchronously, the oldest coexisting in the same temporal space with the more recent meanings.\n\n64The semantic evolution of the term reâyâ in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is a good illustration of this kind of process (Fotic 2017). For centuries, the term referred to the sultan’s taxable Muslim and non-Muslim subjects, as opposed to the ruling class (askerî) who did not pay taxes but served the state in the person of the sultan. By the eighteenth century, it began to acquire a second meaning, which would encroach on the original meaning over half a century: the sultan’s non-Muslim subjects, as opposed to his Muslim subjects. That said, the term would continue to carry the old meaning for a long time, making it for decades a bisemic term whose meaning could only be determined in each case by analyzing the context in which it was used. A similar process, although a bit more complicated, has been convincingly described by a recent paper for the term millet (Sigalas 2021).\n\nReforming and innovating within the Islamic reference\n\n65It should be emphasized here that these terms that make up the vocabulary of what is today called the “reforms,” or the Tanzimat — which from 1838 onwards began to be called Tanzîmât-ı hayriye (Eldem 2021), or the “blessed regulations” — are doubly rooted in a lexical and semantic field that is strongly Islamic (Abu-Manneh 1994). I will offer a few examples of Takvîm-i vekayi to illustrate my point. If we adopt the terminology of the editors, then at the turn of 1830 in the Ottoman Empire, tecdîd-i usûl-i devlet was taking place; that is, a renewal of the state’s foundations, rather than a “bad or illicit innovation.” The terms bid‘at or hâdis (see Sariyannis 2019: 238, 262 and 444) are not used to describe the process of political reorganization then underway. The term bid‘at appears only once to denigrate Mehmed Ali of Egypt. The reference is then to ihtirâât ve bid‘at-ı mısriyye, meaning illicit innovations against the sharia:\n\nMısır iklîmine fakr-ı hâl-i ahâlîye müstetbi‘ olmuş bunca ihtirâât ve bid‘at-ı mısriyye için ahâlî-yi Mısır kendisinden taleb-i hesâba fırsât-bîn oldukları müşârünileyhin mütebâdir-i hâtırı olmaz mı bunca mezâlimden mütehayyir ve mükedder olan Arab tâifesi etrâfta medet-gâh ve âh edib âdât ve temettuât-ı kadîmesinden bir eser kalmadığını ve vâlileri pâdişâhlarına ve imâm-ı muazzamlarına sadâkat unvânından ve şerefinden dahi mahrûm ve hâlî kaldığını göricek kime mürâcaat ve kimden istimdâd edecekleri cây-ı mütâlaa değil midir (Takvîm-i vekayi 8, 1831, emphasis added).\n\n66The translation in Le Moniteur Ottoman (no. 8, 1831) cannot express the exact meaning of the accusation against Mehmed Ali:\n\nQuel appui pourrait-on prêter aux innovations qu’il a introduites? Qui pourrait le soutenir au milieu de cette population turque et arabe étonnée de tant de changemens (sic), lorsqu’autour de lui il ne resterait plus rien des anciennes mœurs, pas même le titre de fidèle d’Osmanli?.\n\nWhat support could be given to the innovations he introduced? Who could support him among the Turkish and Arab population astonished by so many changes, when around him nothing remains of the old customs, not even the title of loyal to Osmanlis?\n\n67Here is my translation, which is meant to be literal:\n\nDoesn’t Mehmed Ali think that the illicit innovations that have impoverished the inhabitants of the country will make them turn against him as soon as an opportunity presents itself? These Arabs, who plead everywhere against all of these oppressions and see that their old customs and earnings have disappeared, where will they turn to for help when they realize that their governor has furthermore renounced honor and loyalty to their sultan and supreme imam?\n\n68The reforms introduced by Mehmed Ali are thus illicit innovations against sharia law. As for the sultan, he is müceddid or renewer, or rather müceddid-i kavânîn-i devlet, or renewer of the fundamental laws of the state. The müceddid sultan undertakes teceddüdât, or renewals, such as teceddüdât-ı usûl-i dâhiliye ve nizâmât-ı askeriye, “renewal of the foundations of the [government] of the country and of the military organization.”\n\n69These “renewals” are embedded in an Islamic reformist discourse whose linearity, continuity and coherence are increasingly called into question by a new critical historiography (Mayeur-Jaouen 2019). In reality, these “renewals” consist of administrative centralization and of the gradual construction of a more integrated political system. The editors of the official gazette occasionally put it more clearly:\n\nenderûn ü birûnda olan her bir umûru teşettüt dağdağasından kurtarıb kaide-i vahdete ircâ‘ buyurmakta olmalarıyla (Takvîm-i vekayi 2, 1831, emphasis added).\n\nThis is translated by Le Moniteur Ottoman as\n\ndont le but constant est de ramener toutes les branches de l’administration à un système de simplicité (Le Moniteur Ottoman 2, 1831).\n\nwhose constant goal is to bring all branches of administration back to a system of simplicity (Le Moniteur Ottoman 2, 1831).\n\n70Here is my more literal translation of this passage: “who wanted to put an end to the dissipation of the government by unifying all affairs.” This passage shows us, once again, that an idea, a concept may well exist before a specific term appears to reference to it. If at the beginning of the 1830s, the Ottoman language does not have a word to express the concept of administrative centralization in an exclusive way, it is clear that the editors of the official gazette were able to come up with an idea.\n\n71Let us take a closer look at the teceddüdât. We must not be deceived by this particular and insistent use of a religious reference; or rather, this attempt to recompose the Muslim religious reference. We must also consider the range of possibilities at the hands of historical actors. They draw their words from the lexical field that is then at their disposal. While we must attribute to them a capacity for action, we must not forget either that their action is to some extent conditioned by the social and political language of their time and their world:\n\nIf there are indeed causal linkages between social language and social reality, to speak of the one as mirroring the others may be to envisage the causal arrows pointing in the wrong direction [...] to recover the nature of the normative vocabulary available to us for the description and appraisal of our conduct is at the same time to indicate one of the constraints on our conduct itself. This in turn suggests that, if we wish to explain why social agents chose to concentrate on certain courses of action while avoiding others, we are bound to make some reference to the prevailing moral language of the society in which they were acting. For this, it now appears, must have figured not as an epiphenomenon of theirs projects, but as one of the determinants of theirs actions (Skinner 2018: 225).\n\n72This lies at the heart of the question of the intentionality of actors/authors, a complex methodological problem that we could not address here without losing sight of the purpose of this article (Guilhaumou 2006: 85-88). In any case, a historian should not take the discourse of historical actors at its face value. Let us remain cautious rather than putting forward the idea that the use of this term is a sign of the impact of a certain idea of Islamic reform. The fact is that, regardless of the words used to describe the situation, there is a real innovation: the will to make these discourses public. Another significant innovation is the eminently political discursive act of writing them down once and for all on a textual medium, reproduced at regular intervals, intended to be widely disseminated. The sultan, who held political power until then by divine will, explains and defends himself, and is justified by modern reformulations of the religious reference before an amorphous public whose contours remain — I believe deliberately — blurred and ambiguous. This fact is in itself very notable of the new times.\n\nMarking time\n\n73Let us return to the emic categories. The sultan is addressed as müceddid-i kavânîn-i tedâbîr-i rehîn-i saltanat, or “he who is the promoter of laws, protective measures and the guarantor of the sultanate” as well as müceddid-i nizâm-ı mülk ü devlet, or “the reviver of the order of the state and the realms.” Additionally, the administrative reorganization is cedîd, or new, as opposed to the previous practices, usûl-i sâbık. One occasionally reads, for example, an announcement that refers to a change as replacing what was “customary until then.”\n\n75These temporal markers, which at first glance seem quite banal, in fact have a fundamental rhetorical function in forming the political discourse of Takvîm-i vekayi. Certainly, every language has temporal markers and every tradition of bureaucratic phraseology makes abundant use of them. But precisely because they are so insignificant, we often forget to pay attention to them in studies of historical semantics. In our case study, however, this choice to mark and underline novelty and change reflects a new relationship to time. The present is detached more and more from what precedes it. It stands out from it. To borrow from Koselleck, is this a sign of the new times “where expectations become more and more distant from all experiences until now” (Koselleck 2005: 315)? Should this be seen as the horizon of expectations gradually emancipating itself from the field of experience? In fact, matters are probably much more complex. The horizon of expectations, in any case, incorporates multiple layers of historical experience. The dynamic relationship between the field of experience and history is therefore hardly reducible to the opposition past/future or break/continuity (Escudier 2009: 1275, 1280-1282). I will return to these temporal markers below when I discuss the term kadîm.\n\n76Emphasizing novelty by contrasting it with the old does not necessarily involve the use of time markers either. In its first issue, Takvîm-i vekayi includes two narratives that denote two new practices introduced by Mahmud II. The first is about the granting of imperial orders instead of robes of honor (Eldem 2004); the second is the opening of the ceremony, given to a wider audience, at the start of Crown Prince Abdülmecid’s religious instruction. Here are two passages from these two accounts:\n\n20 This passage does not appear in Le Moniteur Ottoman.\n\ntaraf-ı saltanattan hi‘lât giydirmek zamân-ı kadîmden kalma tırâz ta‘bîr olunur kaide-i muteberedir ki ser-â-ser üst hi‘lâti ve kürk ve teşrîf kaftanı dedikleri man‘a ve tedbîr-i mülkiye muktezâsından olarak hikmete evfâk bir resm-i zîbâ ise de padişahımız azze nasrûhü hazretlerinin mücerred devr-i mergubi’t-tavr-ı şâhâneleri muhassânât-ı bedîasından olmak üzere arûz makulesinden olan kürk yerine cevâhir ihsân buyurmaları el-hak resm-i kadîmden bin kat berter bir lutf-ı evferdir (Takvîm-i vekayi 1, 1831, emphasis added).\n\nOffering robes of honor as a sovereign is a decorative custom, inherited from ancient times and followed with respect; even though it was a decoration ceremony faithful to a philosophy that stems from a particular political meaning and practice of offering fur and a robe of honor, the fact that our master the sultan, may his aid be abundant, orders to give, as a part of his sublime and lovely beautiful novelties, a jewel instead of fur is a thousand times better as a gift as well as a thousand times more reasonable than the old ceremony (emphasis added) .\n\nşehzâdegân hazarâtının kur’âna bed’lerinde ulemâdan yalnız şeyhülislâm efendi hazretleri bi-l-fi’l Rumeli ve Anadolu kazaskerleriyle nakîb-ül-eşrâf efendiler bulunub sâirleri bulunmamak resm-i kadîm iken padişâhımız efendimiz hazretleri mahzâ şîme-i celîle-i cihân-pesend-i bahtiyârî ve şinşine-i dâi-nevâzî-i şehriyârânelerinden nâşî bil-cümle sudûru ve İslâmbol rütbesinde olan duâcılarını taltîf-i da‘vet ile şân-ı şer‘e bu yüzden dahi hürmet buyurmuşlardır (Takvîm-i vekayi 1, 1831, emphasis added).\n\nWhile according to the ancient ceremony, the prince, his excellence, begins the reading of the Koran in the presence of the only şeyhülislâm, the two kazaskers of Rumeli and Anatolia and nakîb-ül-eşrâf, our sultan his excellence, our master, by the mere fact of his exalted nature adored by the whole world and his majestic character which draws all prayers, invited all the judges of higher rank as well as the members of the ulema who have the rank of Istanbul, which venerated the interpreters of the holy law (emphasis added).\n\nA translation of this second account appears in Le Moniteur Ottoman:\n\nCette fête religieuse, à laquelle on ne voyait autrefois que le grand mufti, accompagné de deux kazeskiers, a reçu une solennité toute nouvelle de l’heureuse pensée d’associer les troupes et le peuple au premier acte du prince héritier.\n\nThis religious festivity, at which previously only the Grand Mufti had been seen, accompanied by two kazeskiers, acquired a brand new solemnity due to the joyous thought to involve the troops and the people at the first act of the Crown Prince (Le Moniteur Ottoman 1, 1831, emphasis added).\n\n79These examples show that a methodological approach that focuses only on a few specific terms that designate the key socio-political concepts of a political language could not be entirely satisfactory for the reflection of concern here. In other words, here we see the limits of a conceptual history approach that focuses only on word-concepts more or less isolated from their textual context, on their recurrences and on their semantic evolution in a diachronic perspective. A political discourse is formed, reformed, and articulated not only by changes in and through conceptual terminology, but also by the more usual lexical elements, the most ordinary grammatical combinations, and the commonly, consciously, and unconsciously used stylistic figures. Lexico-metric approaches that privilege the quantitative to the detriment of the qualitative therefore also have their limits.\n\n80Returning to temporal markers, this should not be seen as a clear and definitive discursive break either. The official gazette does not only contain the lexicon of the reform projects of the time of Sultan Selim III; the editors also take care to place the reform in the wake of an older tradition of reform, namely the New Order of the late eighteenth century. They do so by referencing it periodically, particularly in texts about actors who had played a certain role in the reform and who, at the end of their lives, are this time witnessing the establishment of a new New Order. This is the case, for example, of the texts announcing the retirement of the officers, specifying that they had served the army “since the previous reorganization” (mukaddemki nizâmında dahi; evvel ve âhir asâkir-i nizâmiyede) in issues 2 and 10, 11 of the official gazette. Although I cannot elaborate much on the topic here without straying from my point, I should stress that the temporality of the reform in the official gazette in the early 1830s is clearly more focused on the present and distanced from “the old/tradition” than that of the bureaucratic correspondence of the 1840s. These correspondences, examined by Marc Aymes, more readily integrate the past through almost systematic references to the old and to tradition (Aymes 2010: 40-49). All things considered, this recalls the tension between the discursive upheavals of the early French Revolution and the Napoleonic national reconciliation, which tempered the revolutionary impetus of the 1790s while consolidating many of its achievements and consequences in the early 1800s. This idea is reinforced by the fact that the essentially non-confrontational and negotiating mode characterizes the reconfiguration of the relationship between local notables and the central authority through the reorganization of provincial administration from the 1840s onwards (Hanssen 2002).\n\nUsing religion or thinking within the tradition?\n\n81Returning to cedîd, which refers to the new, I must nevertheless stress that the concept and its derivatives (müceddid, tecdîd, teceddüdât) are important concepts of Islamic political thought and also had a certain impact on Ottoman reformist thought of the eighteenth century (Topal 2017; Pagani 2007; Landau-Tasseron 1989). In Islamic reform literature, the concept of renewal expressed by the term müceddid is often linked to that of müctehid, or the one who practices ictihâd (Hallaq 1984), which means reasoning on texts to elaborate laws, or an individual capacity to interpret sacred texts. It should also be recalled that the ictihâd evokes, in an associative relationship, the concept of taklîd (Peters 1980). This important concept can mean both the acceptance of doctrine established within the framework of a school of law or, more generally, the notion of following an established and traditional intellectual authority (Frank 1989; Spannau 2012: 119-151).\n\n83Let us return to the official gazette where we read, regarding the sultan:\n\nGelir her yüz yıl içre dîni bir tecdîd eden dehre\n\nbunun gibi müceddid binde bir kez olmadı peydâ (Takvîm-i vekayi 5, 1831).\n\nI translate freely:\n\nAt the beginning of each century, one who will renew religion arrives in the world\n\nBut a reviver like this one has not been around for a thousand years.\n\n84The first line is the Ottoman translation of a hadith. Both lines are by Esad Efendi. In fact, a slightly different version of this stanza can be found in the book he wrote after the abolition of the Janissaries to legitimize it post-facto:\n\nGelir her yüz yıl içre dîni bir tecdîd ider nâsır\n\nbunun gibi müceddid binde bin ancak gelür nâdir (Es‘ad 2005 [1828]: 146)\n\nI again translate freely:\n\n24 Nâsır is one of the names of Allah in Arabic.\n\nEvery century, Allah renews religion\n\nBut rare is a renewer like this one, who arrives one time in a thousand\n\n85In his book printed in 1828 (on this book, see Heinzelmann 2009: 44-53), Esad Efendi refers to Mahmud II as müceddid several times (Es‘ad 2005 [1828]: 2, 8, 86, 108, 138) and devotes several pages to explain why it is legitimate to qualify him as müceddid, using hadiths and other sources as support (Es‘ad 2005 [1828]: 138-145). Esad Efendi had previously used this term to qualify Mahmud II in his official chronicle (which he began writing in 1825) on several occasions (Sahhâflar 2000 [1825-?]: 429, 464, 507, 625, 628, 639).\n\n88In Takvîm-i vekayi, cedîd is not opposed to kadîm, the old or tradition, but only to usûl-i sâbık, the “previous practices.” Cedîd is then the renewal of what is old, kadîm (Topal 2017). This term is also a semantically very loaded word. It is found in the expression kanûn-ı kadîm, meaning “ancient law” or “law whose origin no one remembers,” an expression omnipresent in Ottoman political treaties of earlier centuries (Öz 2017). Nevertheless, it should be noted that while kanûn-ı kadîm was generally used there to defer to intellectual positions that are, after all, quite conservative (Çakır 2015), the term is hardly sacred or immutable. Treaties were written long before Selim III’s nizâm-ı cedîd in which the author criticizes kanûn-ı kadîm and defends the idea of elaborating new rules, laws, methods, and principles. The criticisms of kanûn-ı kadîm increase in reformist literature during the reign of Selim III (Sariyannis 2019: 442-443); however, at the same time, we also see kanûn-ı kadîm occasionally used to legitimize new reforms and to conceal the new by embedding it in the old (Öz 2010). It is interesting to note that Mahmud’s reformist discourse is in this respect more cautious than that of the time of Selim III, as does not use the expressions nizâm-ı cedîd and kanûn-ı kadîm at all.\n\n90I risk straying from my main point if I elaborate on the concept of religious rhetoric, but it must be stressed that it was partly a reaction to the socio-political tensions inherent in the process of creating a central conscription army, a process that was triggered again in 1826 (Aksan 2007; Yıldız 2009; Dilbaz 2014; Yeşil 2016). Here too, there is little question of an Ottoman exception: the history of the founding of central armies in Prussia, the Habsburg Empire and the Russian Empire is characterized by similar developments that were, moreover, underlined in reform treaties and embassy reports written by Ottoman scribes at the end of the eighteenth century (Yeşil 2010; Findley 1995a and 1995b). A similar discourse of reform was used by Emir Abdelkader in Algeria in the 1830s and in Morocco in the 1850s (Cronin 2008; El-Tahir El-Mesawi 2008; Bennison 2004; Rollman 2004). This being said, let us recall that this is only one of the reasons behind this deployment of an Islamic discourse of reform in the service of political authority. The palace had previously resorted to similar Islamic discourse in its power struggle against regional potentates from the end of the eighteenth century onwards (Anscombe 2010; Yeşil 2016: 273).\n\npadişâhlara itâat edib tebaiyetinden dönmemek ve niçün şu böyle oldu ve böyle oluyor deyu itirâz olunmamak vacîbe-i uhde-i diyânet ve lâzıme-i zimmet-i ubûdiyet olduğuna nice ahâdis-i şerîfe vâride olub (Takvîm-i vekayi 4, 1831).\n\nTo obey the rulers, to never renounce one’s subjection, and to never act in opposition by saying that such and such thing is an obligation of faith as well as a requirement of the tacit contract on protection and subjection; this is evoked by many sacred traditions.\n\n92What else could they use other than the Islamic reference? They were certainly moved by a “sense of universal belonging to Islam as universal community” (Ahmed 2016: 140-143). They also reflected and expressed their political action within the limits of the political language of the time. They were obliged to use the conceptual vocabulary of Islamic philosophy. After all, they thought and spoke within the Islamic tradition. Was this a “manipulation” of Islamic reference? Not necessarily. As put it Talal Asad:\n\nIt is too often forgotten that the process of determining orthodoxy in conditions of change and contest includes attempts at achieving discursive coherence, at presenting the present within an authoritative narrative that includes positive evaluations of past events and persons. Because such authority is a collaborative achievement between narrator and audience, the former cannot speak in total freedom: there are conceptual and institutional conditions that must be attended to if discourses are to be persuasive. That is why attempts by social scientists at rendering such discourses as instances of local leaders manipulating religious symbols to legitimize their social power should be wieved skeptically. This is not simply because ‘manipulation’ carries a strong sense of cynical motivation, even in cases where evidence for such an imputation is not forthcoming, but more broadly because it introduces the notion of a deliberative, rationalistic stance into descriptions of relationships where the notion is not appropriate (Asad 1993: 210-211)\n\n93To better evaluate their intellectual position, one needs to adopt a more comprehensive approach in order to be able to embrace the human and historical phenomenon of Islam in all its complexity. In this perspective, the separation between religious, moral, cultural and secular spheres is almost meaningless and thus constitutes a methodological obstacle to a better understanding of “being Islamic” (Ahmed 2016). Yet, this is not to say that their Islamic reference was an age-old immutable nebula of ideas and principles, as put it Cornelius Castoriadis: “Through its virtually unlimited natural and historical connections, the signifier always goes beyond the rigid attachment to a precise signified and can lead to totally unexpected places” (Castoriadis 1975: 181).\n\n94From the 1790s to the 1820s, the ways of linking Islam and political sovereignty changed in the Ottoman Empire. In the early 1830s, the official gazette established a new discursive linkage, which continued coherently and without much change until the abolition of the caliphate in 1924. It was an attempt by political actors to exploit religious reference; these actors had successfully eliminated the tutelage of certain intermediary bodies such as the Janissaries, the regional potentates, and Bektashism, as well as subjugated or assimilated others — to differing degrees according to place and time — such as the ulema, brotherhoods, and local notables. Besides the sultan and his entourage, these political actors include high-ranking civil servants and major ulema (Heyd 1961). This monopolization is rendered possible by two factors: the state’s stranglehold on the management of pious foundations and brotherhoods (Varol 2013) and, more importantly, the emergence and rise of a class of lay clerics, or public officials, whose numbers are growing exponentially with the expanding bureaucratic apparatus (Findley 1980). Both factors accelerate and intensify over the course of the century. Officials frequently transitioned from an ilmiyye post to a kalemiyye one, creating a brain drain from the ulema class to the bureaucracy which began in the eighteenth century but exacerbated in the nineteenth century (Clayer 2000). Taking the emblematic and well-studied case of Ahmed Cevdet Pasha (1822-1895) (Chambers 1973), this phenomenon provides the backdrop to an important evolution that could be seen as a new relationship between the religious and the political. New historical studies today are more attentive to the continuity of this hybrid political reconfiguration. Even in fields chronologically different from this one, recent research is nuancing the account of how the Turkish Republic controlled Islam, a process long described as a unilateral and firm grasp by the political authority on the religious field. Instead, the stress is on their intertwined relationship, far more complex than the metanarrative of secularism imposed from above (Clayer 2013; Lord 2018).\n\nConclusion: from empirical inquiry to method\n\n95To conclude, I will begin by pointing out that my approach here to the official gazette takes a very specific angle – its political language – from a well-delineated perspective: the discourse on reform, which is characterized by a future-oriented temporality in which the present is increasingly detached from the past. In other words, the official gazette highlights the novelty, the cedîd’s present, while the recent past appears as a degenerate form of ancient times, of kadîm. At first glance, thus, the new is presented as a renewal of the old. However, beneath the surface, the political discourse of the official gazette is deeply innovative in its temporality as well as by the fact that it is a discourse intended to be publicized as widely as possible and is therefore intended to be pedagogical. The emphasis on novelty also concerns the sovereign, who is repeatedly defined as the secular renewer (müceddid) of the Islamic religion. The editors of the official gazette repeatedly refer to the centuries-old Muslim reformist tradition as part of a repertoire of rhetorical tools to consolidate the political legitimacy of the sultan. It is not only aimed at strengthening the legitimacy of the politico-administrative measures launched by Mahmud II; in this way, the official discourse also appropriates the word-concepts of potential opponents of the reforms.\n\n96Thus, it must be noted that the remarkably varied lexical arsenal that was mobilized in the official gazette to describe the process of political-administrative reconfiguration would be distilled a decade later into a much more monolithic lexical field of reform in the early 1840s. Did this process of conceptual fixing and terminological concentration result from administrative centralization and socio-political levelling? In other words, did this change in language result only from transformations in social reality? Or does the new political language contribute, to a certain extent, to disrupting the socio-political order and participate in constructing a new order that is no longer called nizâm-ı cedîd but Tanzimat? This is the question that underlies my investigation in this article.\n\n97As mentioned at the beginning, I hardly intend to exhaust all possible perspectives for the study of the political language of the official gazette. I chose to capture its political language as the expression of a collective political thought that has been forming since the 1790s. This initial decision to espouse a holistic approach certainly deprived me of possible input from other approaches. Thus, I did not adopt a socio-historical approach that investigates by focusing on the various actors who appear in my paper only by name (Mahmud II, Esad Efendi, Alexandre Blacque, Amédée Jaubert, Artin Hindoglu, Alexandre Handjéri, Jean Daniel Kieffer, Thomas-Xavier Bianchi) or worse — like the translators of the official gazette — without even mentioning their names. To be fair, a socio-historical approach bordering on micro-history and aimed at analyzing the semantic evolution of certain key terms on a biographical scale could have allowed me to deepen certain points. However, this approach would have required numerous biographical digressions, hindering the development of the argumentation as well as the clarity of the presentation. Many of these actors also refer to a subtext that underlies my remarks: translation as an intellectual activity that generates new meanings for words. Although I have provided a few examples and made a few specific remarks on the role of translation in the evolution of Ottoman political language, I have made little attempt to go further, leaving this important topic to another study that will focus precisely and exclusively on the translation of European political modernity into the official gazette.\n\n98Before moving on to my methodological remarks, I would also like to note some research prospects for future work on the political language of the official Ottoman gazette. The framework of an article does not permit to address this vast topic in all of its aspects. Hence, I chose to leave aside all of the texts referring to the actions, postures and gestures of the sultan as well as the rarer ones which evoke his miraculous powers. Also, I decided not to treat two semantic fields that are nonetheless informative on the political language of the official gazette in order to avoid the trap of remaining superficial. The first field involves terms relating to the body politic: the lexicon of those who govern and those who are governed, of authority, obedience, and revolt. The second looks at terms relating to translation work in the broadest sense: how is it possible to describe in Ottoman Turkish the political and social realities of European countries in the 1830s? These are the topics that I will include in the remainder of this article in order to continue drawing the contours of the political discourse of Takvîm-i vekayi.\n\n99This is therefore a preliminary study that lays the groundwork for further research on Ottoman political language of the 1830s. Nevertheless, five general methodological remarks emerge from this empirical research, focusing on only one semantic field.\n\n100The first concerns the question of lexical, conceptual, and semantic continuity and rupture. A distinction between new and old words in politics often proves to be ineffective within the frame of the intended research. Old terms and words drawn from the traditional lexical repertoire are frequently used in to designate new institutions during Mahmud’s reign. The case of the name of the new European-style army that Mahmud II founded in 1826 can be a perfect illustration of this: “The Victorious Soldiers [by the divine favor] of Islam” (Asâkir-i mansûre-i muhammediye). Like Şiviloğlu (2018: 48), I cannot help deferring to an eloquent passage from the beginning of 18 Brumaire de Louis Bonaparte:\n\nMan makes his own history, but he does not make it out of the whole cloth; he does not make it out of conditions chosen by himself, but out of such as he finds close at hand. The tradition of all past generations weighs like an alp upon the brain of the living. At the very time when men appear engaged in revolutionizing things and themselves, in bringing about what never was before, at such very epochs of revolutionary crisis do they anxiously conjure up into their service the spirits of the past, assume their names, their battle cries, their costumes to enact a new historic scene in such time-honored disguise and with such borrowed language. Thus did Luther masquerade as the Apostle Paul; thus did the revolution of 1789-1814 drape itself alternately as Roman Republic and as Roman Empire; nor did the revolution of 1848 know what better to do than to parody at one time the year 1789, at another the revolutionary traditions of 1793-95. Thus does the beginner, who has acquired a new language, keep on translating it back into his own mother tongue; only then has he grasped the spirit of the new language and is able freely to express himself therewith when he moves in it without recollections of the old, and has forgotten in its use his own hereditary tongue (Marx 1969 [1852]: 15-16).\n\n101The fact that there is lexical continuity in an intellectual and textual tradition does not mean that there is necessarily also conceptual and semantic continuity. This latter continuity can certainly exist, but we must not forget the fact that intellectual history is also a history of oblivion, misunderstanding, resemanticization, redefinition, a process of reinterpretation, and terminological and conceptual rearrangement. Moreover, in some cases, terminological continuity can also aim to conceal a semantic change or even a discursive rupture because “perception related to language tends to persist, as do mentalities, and often lags behind innovation” (Koselleck 1997: 123). And again, as Bertrand Binoche notes in his excellent study on the history of the concept of public opinion in Europe, “a word can retain the same meaning while assuming a new discursive function; it can, on the contrary, occupy the same function and change meaning. It is not an easy task to identify and distinguish these positions, but it is nevertheless an imperative for all philosophical philology. We must therefore try to do so, as a concerned amateur rather than as a convinced scholar” (Binoche 2012: 109). Such is the importance of working on the slippery and ambiguous research terrain of historical semantics, where the old and new often coexist, sometimes intertwined: it would be a shame to erase the inherent equivocity of certain semantic fields by allowing oneself to be consumed by questions of continuity and rupture.\n\n102The second remark concerns the need for a holistic approach to the textual corpus in question. One cannot elucidate the texts published in the official gazette by, on the one hand, examining them in isolation from each other and, on the other hand, focusing solely on the use of such and such a term, word, or concept. In a way, this is what I have done here in order to argue clearly within the restricted framework of an article. With regard to the first point, one must consider all of the different texts as a single textual field under construction. As I point out below, it is quite possible to find discursive inconsistencies in all of the texts. Still, an approach that isolates words, groups, or fields of words may not provide a total view of the political discourse developed in the official gazette. As for the second point, apart from the words used, one must be attentive to discursive uses, to the stylistic figures mobilized, and to metaphors associated with the words, but also to the linguistic determinants; that is to say, to the “syntagmatic and associative relations,” as Saussure said (Saussure 1971 [1916]: 171 ff.). A passage from Roland Barthes’ inaugural lecture at the Collège de France eloquently summarizes my position on this point:\n\na linguistic object cannot stand, cannot be contained within the limits of a sentence. It is not only phonemes, words, and syntactic articulations that are subject to a semi-liberty regime, because they cannot be combined in any way; it is the whole layer of discourse that is fixed by a network of rules, constraints, oppressions, repressions; massive and blurry at the rhetorical level, subtle and acute at the grammatical level: the language flows into the discourse, the discourse flows back into the language, they persist one under the other, as in the game of the warm hand. The distinction between language and discourse then no longer appears as a transitory operation — something, in short, to be ‘abjured’ (Barthes, 1978: 30-31).\n\n103Concretely speaking, a careful reading of all the texts of several dozen issues of Takvîm-i vekayi leads to the conclusion that, in addition to key word-concepts, the grammatical and discursive markers used by the editors of the official gazette to establish their argumentative strategy must certainly also be considered when analyzing political language. Moreover, in the case of Ottoman Turkish, the common use of hendiadys and lexical collocations of various forms is not an anecdotal detail but, on the contrary, constitutes the methodological starting point for a historian interested in the meaning of the texts he or she studies. For this reason, the historian must interpret these texts constantly guided by an acute knowledge of prefabricated expressions and must be vigilant regarding their pragmatic anchoring; that is, their function in a specific context of usage (Schmale 2013). A historian cannot have all the skills of a researcher in literary or linguistic studies. However, this situation must nevertheless lead him or her to be attentive to the rhetorical and linguistic aspects of the discursive construction of the texts he or she analyses. Above all, the historian must be prudent and humble in his or her conclusions so as not to over- or misinterpret the semantics of the corpus.\n\n104The third remark concerns the relationship of the study of texts to the history. One can work on language in several ways; I argue here for a historical approach to these texts. It is necessary to constantly place these narratives, these texts, in their political context in order to understand the function assigned to them in the new emerging political order. In other words, when one undertakes this type of research inspired by the history of concepts or historical semantics, one must inscribe his/her reflection in the overall political and intellectual history. One must also take care to put into relation and into perspective the concepts, words, and terms detected in the texts with the events, people, and history of the period concerned. Concretely speaking, the terminology on the current reforms cannot be analyzed without considering the recent and immediate history of the tensions caused by the military reorganization. The texts against Mehmed Ali of Egypt, which promoted a plethora of ad hominem arguments in a polemical registry, must be resituated in the context of the then-imminent war between Istanbul and Cairo. The numerous texts on the revolts in Anatolia, Iraq, and the Balkans can only be studied if there are monographs on each of these protests against centralization. The translations in the European press or the Moniteur Ottoman can only take on their full meaning within the context of the monarchist and conservative reaction against the first disruption of the Metternichian diplomatic system. While the conservative European order established by Metternich after the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was immediately challenged by student and political movements across Europe, the Holy Alliance held up, as best it could, until the second half of the 1820s. The first Metternichian system would be greatly weakened by the aftermath of the Greek revolt that broke out in 1821. France and Great Britain had considered it preferable, from a geopolitical standpoint, to intervene in favor of the Greek insurgents in 1827 to prevent a future Greece from falling under the exclusive domination of the Russian Empire. The Russian tsar had decided beforehand in 1825, after many hesitations, to support diplomatically and militarily the insurrection against the Ottoman power, thus leaving aside the Metternichian spirit. While Belgian nationalists took full advantage of the ambivalent political climate to create Belgium at the end of 1830 by splitting their territory from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815-1830), the Russian army would restore the territory created by the conservative order of the Congress of Vienna by crushing in 1831 the Polish insurrection unleashed in November 1830. The revolts in the Ottoman Empire, which are often treated in the historiography as resistance against Mahmud II’s centralizing measures, also fit into this overall context.\n\n105The fourth remark concerns the historical role and performativity of the corpus under study. The official gazette, which is the main textual platform for propaganda of the political authority, also constitutes — at this crucial moment when change is accelerating and intensifying — a kind of reflective surface. It holds a mirror to the ruling class so that, apart from making political and ideological propaganda in order to consolidate their symbolic power, they can contemplate their actions and themselves and thus give meaning to what they are doing; or rather, try to monopolize the meaning and interpretation ascribed to it. This intellectual and editorial operation, which is reflexive by its very nature, likely contributes to the sedimentation of all Ottoman reformist thought. Until then, reformist thought had consisted of a nebula of problem diagnoses and proposals for solutions that had been piling up, without accruing, as of the last quarter of the eighteenth century. By merely concentrating and assembling it in a single textual corpus in a regular and immediate temporality, a synthesis gradually appears. In other words, this political thought came to fruition by inscribing and narrating reformist literature in the official gazette in the early 1830s. It is this process of conceptual and terminological distillation that lies at the origin of Gülhâne rescript, which marks the beginning of a new period of administrative reorganization with a much more global scope and a much more coherent discourse framing it. That is, the Gülhâne turning point of 1839 — which has until now been conceived as the beginning of the age of reforms, as a starting point (of modernization, secularization, westernization, Tanzimat, modern Turkey, semi-colonization etc.) — is in fact also a point of culmination in the history of Ottoman reformist thought in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\n106To be clear: I am not adopting a teleological approach that attributes an exaggerated intentionality to the historical actors (the ruling class) and a considerable capacity for action to the texts (the official gazette) on their own, independently of any socio-historical condition. This would contradict my previous remark. The causal links between these various elements are multilateral and multidirectional. But it is also necessary to underline the significant role language configuration can play in the evolution of social and political realities, particularly during certain specific historical junctures. For my part, I subscribe here to the “common will of the various currents of conceptual history, including the linguistic history of conceptual usages, to work on the empirical link between concrete action and discourse, not to dissociate them artificially in the search of strategies swiftly described as illusory,” to quote Jacques Guilhaumou (Guilhaumou 2006: 82). In other words, not only am I following Humboldt in his insistence on the linguistic nature of thought (Guilhaumou 2006: 213-215), but I am also of the opinion that language and discourse must be ascribed a certain performativity in the advent of some historical events (Guilhaumou 2006: 123, 138-139, 217, 224).\n\n107In this respect, the 1830s were a pivotal period in Ottoman history. I do not place the turning point in 1839, therefore in Gülhâne rescript, but at the very start of the decade. It was at this time that, to quote the eloquent words of Şiviloğlu, “the heteroglossia of political language disappeared in favor of unified discourse(s)” (Şiviloğlu 2018: 42). The importance of this phenomenon cannot be overstated. I wonder whether we should not rethink the whole history of the Tanzimat also as one of “imagined reforms,” as “a great progress — on paper,” to use Marc Aymes’ well-put and evocative formulation (Aymes 2010). Progress perhaps remains on paper and does not translate precisely into social reality. Perhaps. Nevertheless, it is also true that the linearity of the writing and formatting necessarily gives a certain linearity and di"
