So why study a figure such as Said Halim Pasha? The answer lies in his important and unique standing among Muslim intellectuals in his field. The originality of Said Halim Pasha's thought can be found in its skillful combination of revivalist and modernist ideas. At the core of his ideology is the revivalist principle of islamization, which in turn was inspired by the tenets of medieval Muslim thinker Ibn Taymiyya. A junior member of the Egyptian khedivial family, Said Halim was raised in his father's mansion in Yenikoy on the Bosphorus and sent to Europe for advanced studies. Upon his return to Istanbul he secretly became a member of the Young Turk Movement. Nevertheless, although the Young Turks opposed the policies of Sultan Abdiilhamid II (1876-1909), the young prince served as a high-ranking official in the Hamidian regime and received gratifications and honors from the sultan. When Abdiilhamid's secret police finally discovered his links with the Young Turk opposition, Said Halim had again to face exile: he was first sent to Egypt and from there he went on to Europe. While in Europe he took part in the Young Turk opposition to Hamidian rule. After the proclamation of the Constitution in July 1908, Said Halim returned to Istanbul and was given the important positions of senator and President of the State Council. In January 1913 he became the minister of foreign affairs in Mahmud §evket Pasha's cabinet and was appointed shortly afterwards as grand vizir in June 1913 following the latter's assassination. Said Halim Pasha's appointment was of special significance because it was for the first time since the 1908 Revolution that a Unionist had attained the grand vizirate and headed a cabinet formed of largely of Unionist members. Prior to this and following the fall of the Hamidian regime, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) had for the most part dominated Ottoman politics. But rather than involve itself directly in the cabinet, it had chosen to exert power through its parliamentary majority. The reasons for the Unionists'\n\n8\n\nSAID\n\nH A L1 M\n\nPASHA\n\nhesitation to participate in cabinet included their political inexperience and humble social origins. In a society where only experienced and cultivated bureaucrats were considered politically trustworthy, CUP members who lacked these qualities were essentially barred from the executive branch of government. This allowed figures like Said Pasha and Kamil Pasha, who were at the service of the autocratic sultan and closely associated with the ancien régime, to maintain their authority by playing pivotal political roles. The appointment of Said Halim to the grand vizirate constituted a break with this tradition: the new grand vizir was not an old, well-settled, well connected and experienced statesman coming from the Bab-i Ali tradition, nor was he a high ranking military figure like his predecessor, Mahmud §evket Pasha. Rather, he was a high-born, princely intellectual and idealist who was completely committed to the cause of the Young Turks. He was also a skillful diplomat who took a strong stand against the Great Powers' plans of partitioning the Ottoman Empire. A respected statesman and an able diplomat, Said Halim was first and foremost an influential thinker, one of the most outspoken representatives of the Islamist school during the Second Constitutional Period (1908-1920). His stance within the Islamist school could be qualified as modernist-revivalist: modernist, not only because of his modern Western style discourse but also because of the many Western-originated institutions and concepts (i.e, parliament and democracy) which figure in his political theory; revivalist because of his advocacy of a return to a pristine Islam. In his famous work entitled Islamization (better known under its Turkish title islamla§mak), Said Halim proposes a complete Islamization of Muslim societies, including \"forgetting\" their pre-Islamic past and purifying themselves of their preIslamic heritage. Said Halim Pasha's works were written originally in French and most often published in Istanbul and various European capitals between 1910 and 1921. His earliest work—published in Paris—in 1910, bears the ironic title of Le fanatisme musulman. In essence it is a tract explaining how Christian Europe's hostility towards the Islamic world since the time of the Crusades caused the economic and technological retardation prevalent in Muslim countries. His second work, Essai sur les causes de la décadence des peuples musulmans (published in Istanbul in 1918), also deals with the decline of the Muslim world and is an example of the modernist-revivalist genre that characterized the Muslim decline literature of that period.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nSaid Halim tended to use the pseudonym Mohammed in the above titles. However, his major work, Les institutions politiques dans la société musulmane, which expounds his social and political thought, was published in Rome in 1921 (the year of his assassination by an Armenian militant), under his full name and title: Le prince Said Halim Pacha', ancien Grand-Vézir. This last work was republished a year later in the journal Orient et Occident under the title Notes pour servir à la réforme de la société musulmane. An English translation was published in 1967 in Karachi, Pakistan by the Waqf Institution of Begoum Aisha Bavani under the title Reform in the Muslim Society. Most of Said Halim's works were translated into Ottoman Turkish and appeared during his lifetime in the Islamist-modernist periodical Sebiliirre§ad. Indeed most of the original French versions of these works are existant only in their original hand- and typewritten form and bear the author's annotations. For the purpose of this study I have relied on the original French versions which no scholar has previously examined. These invaluable sources were generously and kindly provided to me by Rukiye Kuneralp, a member of the family of Said Halim Pasha and include La crise politique, which was only partly and inaccurately translated into Turkish for two articles entitled \"Me§rutiyet\" (The Constitutional Regime) and \"Mukallitliklerimiz\" (Our Imitations). In my study, I used both the French original and the Turkish versions comparatively. Other essays are \"La société ottomane\" translated into Turkish under the title \"Içtimai buhranimiz\" (Our Society in Crisis); and \"Islamization\" which enjoyed fame among Islamist intellectuals in its Turkish translation \"Islamlagmak.\" The political life and thought of Said Halim Pasha have not previously been studied by scholars in any detail. Mustafa Dtizdag's edition of his works using the Turkish title of one of Said Halim's articles, \"Buhranlarimiz,\" (Our Crises) is merely a modern Turkish adaptation of a work that was already published under the same title in 1335-1338 (1919). A previous edition of this work had also appeared in 1332 (1916). Dtizdag's work also contains also a few pages of biographical notes on Said Halim written by various contemporary figures and by historians. The only study which offers any indepth analysis of Said Halim's political life is Hanefi Bostan's work entitled Bir islamci Diisuniir Said Halim Pasa (Said Halim Pasha: An Islamist Thinker) (1990). Despite its title, the work does not examine Said Halim's ideas but is instead an account of the life and times of Said Halim.\n\n10\n\nSAID\n\nHALiM\n\nPASHA\n\nThe topic of Islamism in the late Ottoman Empire has been the object of many scholarly studies over the past forty years. A fundamental work on this topic was written by the late professor Tank Zafer Tunaya in 1962 and is entitled islamcihk Cereyam (Islamist Current). It consists of a critical survey of Islamist thought during the Second Constitutional Period (1908-1920), as well as the four decades of Islamist political activity in Republican Turkey. The political and social thought of Said Halim Pasha and other contemporary thinkers including Musa Kazim, Ahmed Nairn, Mustafa Sabri and Mehmed Akif (Ersoy) are briefly presented in this study in order to emphasize the continuity between the Islamism of the late Ottoman period and that of the Republican era. There has recently appeared a more comprehensive account which, although lacking critical perspective is nevertheless valuable. This is Ismail Kara's Turkiye'de islamcihk Dii§uncesi, published in three volumes between 1986 and 1989. Kara's work is merely a collection of extracts from the works of the Islamist thinkers of the Second Constitutional Period and Republican era along with short biographies of each thinker. In a more recent study entitled islamcilarin Siyasi Goriigleri, published in 1994, Kara endeavored to present the social and political ideas of the Islamist thinkers of the Second Constitutional Period from a critical perspective. Despite its angle, this work remained a general study and could only offer an overall picture of the Islamists' ideas of that period. As far as Said Halim's ideas were concerned, Kara contended himself with investigating a very limited aspect of the pasha's thought and dwelled almost exclusively on Said Halim criticism of the 1908 constitution. The first critical account of Islamism in the late Ottoman Empire in English was brilliantly but briefly presented by Niyazi Berkes in his important work The Development of Secularism in Turkey (Montreal, 1963). Here the author also analyzed this and other contemporary social and political currents such as Westernism and Turkism while vividly presenting the ideological debate between these schools. Nevertheless, this work also was intended as a general work on intellectual history of the late Ottoman Empire and therefore could only make some sketchy references to Said Halim's thought besides the ideas of other Islamist intellectuals of his time. Another interesting study on the Islamic modernism of the Second Constitutional Period was Ak§in Somel's M.A thesis. Submitted to the Department of History of the Bogazi?i University, it is limited to the Islamist\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n11\n\nthinkers who wrote for the Islamist journal of Sirat-i Mustakim. Somel later published his thesis as an article entitled Sirat-i Mustakim: Islamic modernism in the Ottoman Empire, 1908-1912, in the Journal of Middle East Studies v.l no.l. Aksin did not include Said Halim Pasha in his study. For the political and especially diplomatic history of the last decade (1912-1922) of the Ottoman Empire (an especially important facet of this study given Said Halim Pasha's role in the politics of that period, first as minister of foreign affairs (January 1913-October 1915) then as grand vizir (June 1913-February 1917)), I consulted all relevant secondary sources available in Turkish, English and French. One of the most important of these is Ulrich Trumpener's study of the Ottoman involvement in the First World War entitled Germany and the Ottoman Empire, 1914-1918. Nevertheless, as rightly pointed out by Feroz Ahmad, the weak point of Trumpener's work is the author's \"unfamiliarity with the Turkish side of the story\" and his almost exclusive reliance on German diplomatic material. 1 Among the most important of the Turkish sources written during the Republican era is the colossal work by Yusuf Hikmet Bayur entitled Turk inkilabi Tarihi (History of the Turkish Revolution), which draws on all available Ottoman archival materials, as well as relevant European diplomatic sources. I also used the published memoirs and diaries of many Ottoman statesmen from this era including Mahmud §evket Pasha, Cemal Pasha, Talat Pasha, Ahmed izzet Pasha and Ali Ihsan Sabis Pasha along with those of Palace officials like Tahsin Pasha, Ali Fuad (Turkgeldi) and Halit Ziya (U§akligil), and Mehmet Tevfik (Biren) Beys. I also consulted the memoirs written by religious dignitaries of the empire including §eyhulislam Mehmed Cemaleddin Efendi and the Armenian patriarch Zaven (the latter shedding important light on the Armenian crisis and tragedy), as well as those of Amir Husayn of Mecca (particularly on the Hijazi revolt), both of which occurred during the grand vizirate of Said Halim Pasha despite his unsuccessful efforts to prevent them. Most important for my study were the political memoirs of Said Halim Pasha written by himself in Rome in the months before his assassination and published in Istanbul in 2001. In addition to the Ottoman sources, I also used the published diplomatic documents of the British, French and Russian governments which cast light on this turbulent period. The memoirs of certain Western diplomats at the Porte at the time of the outbreak of the First World War including French ambassador Maurice Bompard and the United States' ambassador, Henry Morgentau, as well as other contemporary statesmen of the Great Powers like Serge Sazonov (the last Russian foreign minister) and ^For a detailed criticism of Trumpener's work, see, Feroz Ahmad's book review in Middle Eastern Studies, 6 (January 1970), pp. 100-105.\n\n12\n\nSAID\n\nHALIM\n\nPASHA\n\nEdward Grey (the British foreign minister) were consulted. During May-June 2001, I conducted a laborious and thorough research in the Ottoman Prime Ministry Archives on the diplomatic activities of Said Halim Pasha and found some very interesting untapped material. I incorporated them into my work. I also had the opportunity of interviewing Princess Zeyneb Halim, niece of Said Halim Pasha, (daughter of Abbas Halim Pasha) in her residence at Salacak, a lovely neighborhood of the Asiatic part of Istanbul. During this interview, Princess Halim provided me with some very valuable information on the private and public life of her uncle Said Halim Pasha. The political career and thought of Said Halim Pasha cannot be properly examined outside the political and ideological context of his times. Consequently, the second and third chapters of my study focus on the political and ideological developments of the last three decades of the Ottoman Empire. This is done so as to provide the reader with a better understanding of Said Halim's role during this critical period. Indeed as the Ottoman Empire entered its twilight, many competing ideologies began to take shape. An Islamist thinker, Said Halim was also a loyal Unionist statesman. Despite his ideological differences with secular-minded leaders of the CUP such as Talat and Enver, Said Halim cast his political lot with them. Such actions may appear contradictory; nevertheless, as a fervent champion of Islamic patriotism, Said Halim believed that only the strong leadership of the CUP could reinvigorate and save the Ottoman Empire, the last bulwark of Islam, and preserve it from conquest by aggressive European imperialism which, according to him, was a modern version of the Crusades. Contrary to the prevailing historical view, Said Halim Pasha was not a mere figurehead of the powerful triumvirate formed by Talat Pasha, Enver Pasha, and Cemal Pasha (actually, it would be more accurate to call it a diarchy, since Cemal Pasha's influence never matched that of Enver and Talat). Instead, Said Halim Pasha served as a counterbalance in the cabinet to the manoeuvres of Enver and Talat. As long as Said Halim remained in power he was an obstacle to the secularizing reforms that the Turkist wing of the CUP was pushing for. For example, two important legislative acts, The Enactment of the Law of §eriat Courts Procedure (an essential move towards unifying the judicial procedure) and The Codification of the New Family Law, (which considerably reduced the role of the geriat in the private lives of Ottoman subjects) could only have been decreed once Said Halim Pasha had resigned\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n13\n\nfrom the grand-vizirate. The laws were signed into force in March 1917, a month after Said Halim's resignation. As for Said Halim's political thought, it is important to contextualize it within the framework of his political life and within the important intellectual currents of the late Hamidian (1895-1908) and the Second Constitutional (1908-1920) periods. The three main ideologies of this twentyfive year span—Islamism, Turkism, and Westernism—are examined in Chapter Four of this study alongside Said Halim Pasha's rigorous defense of his ideas vis-à-vis Turkist and Westernist writers. My comments focus on his dispute with Ziya Gôkalp concerning the impact of national popular and preIslamic cultures (hors) on the progress and evolution of the Muslim peoples. An examination of this dispute will help us understand the issue of nationalism and Islam which lay at the core of this ideological conflict. 1\n\nA collection of Said Halim Pasha's works in Turkish has appeared while the present study was in press. I was therefore unable to use it: Said Halim Pa$a: Butiin Eserleri, ed. N. Ahmet Ozalp, (Istanbul: Anka Yayinlari 2003).\n\nCHAPTER ONE: ISLAMISM\n\nBy the last quarter of the eighteenth century European colonial powers had succeeded in asserting their military, political and economic supremacy over most non-European societies. Prior to 1775 the Muslim heartlands had rarely been under a direct threat or occupation by a Western power. Indeed until that period, an equilibrium of power existed between the Ottomans, Safavids and Moguls, the three great Muslim empires of Islam, and the expanding Western powers. This precarious balance was upset during the last decades of the eighteenth century as Muslim empires in central Islamic lands began to lose ground to growing European pressure due to the rising economic and military power of the latter. For example, as a result of a disastrous war with Russia (1768-1774), the Ottoman Empire was forced to sign, on 21 July 1774, the infamous Treaty of Kii^iik Kaynarca.1 Among the conditions agreed to by the Ottomans were their being coerced into granting the Russians access to the Black Sea, an economic reserve for the Ottomans until then. Also, they relinquished control of the Crimea, a region largely inhabited by Muslim Tartars (this territory, while having gained its independence through the treaty, was eventually annexed by Russia). According to Article 2 of the treaty, the Tartars of the Crimea would recognize the Ottoman sultan as the caliph. This clause would later constitute the basis of the Ottoman sultans' claim to the universal Caliphate. The same cannot be said for the sultan's orthodox subjects: while some historians hold that articles 7 and 14 served in the past as a legal basis for an alleged Russian\n\nFor the Italian version of this treaty (one of the three original languages in which the treaty was written — the other official versions being in Ottoman Turkish and Russian), see Geo. Fred, de Martens, Recueil de Traités d'alliance, de paix, de trêve, de neutralité, de commerce, de limites, d'échanges etc et de plusieurs autres actes servant à la connaissance des relations étrangères des Puissances et Etats de l'Europe (Gottingue: Librarie de Dieterich, 1771-1779). (Hereafter cited as Martens, Recueil) See also Gabriel Noradoungian, Recueil d'actes internationaux de l'Empire Ottoman (Paris: 1903), vol.l, pp. 351-353. (Hereafter cited as Noradoungian, Recueil).

For the first time since the Crusades the Muslim heartland was occupied by a Western power. Even Iran was not immune: it too suffered territorial losses at the hands of the Russians and had to cede Georgia and Daghestan in 1813. Further afield in the Indian subcontinent, the eighteenth century witnessed the gradual disintegration of the Timurid Mughal Empire as a result of its weakening imperial institutions and court rivalries. Persian ruler Nadir Shah's invasion of Delhi in 1739 and the Afghan invasions under Ahmed Shah Abdali between 1748 and 1767 constituted severe blows for the Mughal Empire and accelerated its fall. The situation accelerated the centrifugal forces within the sub-continent. The Jat, Maratha, Sikh and other chieftains increasingly carved out autonomous territories for themselves and undermined the Mughal authority. 3 Nevertheless, though the disintegration of the Mughal Empire had started as an internal problem, its fall would be at the hands of the British East India Company, which had taken advantage of the political chaos to conquer India from within in a series of successful wars during the 1760s and 1820s. However, it was not until after the suppression of the Sepoy revolt in 1858, that the British were able to establish their domination over the subcontinent on a firm basis. The internal crises of Muslim societies at the end of the eighteenth century, along with the decline of central Muslim empires and their subsequent subjugation by European colonial powers led to the emergence in Arabia and India of several protest movements. The leaders of these mainly revivalist movements believed that the source of this crisis lay in moral decay and 'Article VII of the treaty of Kii9iik Kaynarca (in its original Italian version) says:\" La Fulgida Porta promette una ferma protezione alla religione Christiana, e alle Chiefe di quella permette ancora à ministri dell'Imperiai Corte di Russia di fare in ogni occurenza varie rapprefentanze alla Porta à favore della sotto mentevatta eretta Chiefa in Constantinopoli, accennata nell'art.XIV non meno che di quei che la fervono, e promette ricevere queste rimostranze con attenzione, come fatte da persona considerata d'una vicina e finceramente amica Potenza\".

They sought the restoration of the power of Islam by purifying the religion of alien elements and by following the sunna of the Prophet. The most important of these movements emerged in the mid-eighteenth century in central Arabia, and was called the Wahhabiyya, taking its name from its founder, Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1115-1201 A.H./1703-1792 A . D . ) . 1 The latter had found in 1744 a powerful protector in Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saud, a local ruler who adopted his doctrine and agreed to provide him with the financial, political, and military backing necessary to enable Ibn Abd al-Wahhab to spread his tenets across Arabia. Although the Wahhabi movement had emerged originally in reaction to the practices of popular Islam in Arabia, it had become by the late eighteenth century a serious threat to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman elite had already initiated a series of modernizing reforms to improve traditional state institutions, particularly the military and the civil service. While the Ottomans used European structures as their model, the Wahhabis advocated a return to the formative period of Islam which they idealized as a pristine age. Wahhabiyya ideology was based on the doctrine of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (164-241 A.H./780-855 A.D.) and was inspired by the Hanbali theologian and revivalist Ibn Taymiyya (661-728 A.H./1263-1328 A.D.). Considered one of the most important thinkers in Islam, Ibn Taymiyya was the principal inspiration for Muslim revivalists in the eighteenth century and for modernists in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.2 Born in Harran (a town located in present-day south-eastern Turkey), Ibn Taymiyya completed his education in Damascus at the Sukkariyya Madrasa. He was subsequently appointed as a professor at the Hanbaliyya Madrasa in the same city on 17 Shaban 695 (20 June 1296). Ibn Taymiyya devoted his academic and political career to a determined and indefatigable struggle against what he called \"Mushrikun\" (Polytheists). His main goals were to \"purify\" Islam of any corruptive elements and to enhance the role of the §eriat by restoring it to its central position in Muslim life.\n\n^D.S. Margoliouth, \"Wahhabiya\", Encyclopaedia of Islam. 1st edition, pp. 1086-1090. ^The most detailed and critical study of the doctrine of Ibn Taymiyya remains the voluminous work of Henri Laoust, Essai sur les doctrines sociales et politiques de Tak-id-din Ahmad b. Taimiya (Cairo: Imprimerie de l'Institut français d'archéologie orientale, 1939).\n\n18\n\nS A l D\n\nH A L l M\n\nP A S H A\n\nAlthough Ibn Taymiyya's thought derives from Hanbali doctrine, its originality lies in the combination of diverse arguments proposed by dogmatic theologians, traditionalists, and Sufi thinkers. These, in turn, are based on kalam, hadith, and irada in order to create a new doctrine of mediation. Ibn Taymiyya condemned the practices of popular or folk Islam and considered them as a deviation from the teachings of the Qur'an and the Prophet. He stated in his Kitab Iqtida al-Sirat al Mustaqim wa Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim (The Book for the Following of the Straight Path Against the People of Hell) that the survival of pagan customs and habits in Islam had exercised a detrimental effect on Muslims, causing them to diverge from the essence of their religion. Ibn Taymiyya submits that holy days, such as Ashura, Mawlid al-Nabiyy and Id-Adha began to be celebrated in Islam in later periods under the influence of other religions. Indeed, the feast of Mawlid al-Nabiyy (birthday of the Prophet) was instituted as an emulation of Christmas. 1 Ibn Taymiyya equally condemned the visitation of the tombs of the saints (Ziyarat al-Qubur) in order to request their intercession. This he identifies with idol worship since the veneration of the saints' tombs would turn these places into sanctuaries. 2 Ibn Taymiyya's ideas on the visitation of tombs were adopted by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who also considered this practice as a form of shirk (polytheism). The cardinal point of Muhammad ibn Abd-al Wahhab's doctrinc was tawhid (Unity of God), which he expounded in Kitah al Tawhid (The Book of Unity). According to Abd-al Wahhab, tawhid has three meanings which were, tawhid al-rubabiyya, tawhid al-uldihiyya and tawhid al-asma wal sifat. Abd-al Wahhab in his thought put emphasis on the third meaning of the tawhid, tawhidal asma wal sifat (the unity of God's attributes as stated in the Qur'an without interpretation). 3 He gave the definition of his creed as such: \"To describe God as He described Himself in the Qur'an and as His Prophet did in the hadith\" 4 The aim of Ibn Abd-al Wahhab was to purify Islam from the practices of Jdhiliyya and to reislamize the tribes of Arabia by teaching them the tenets of pristine Islam.

According to Said Halim, the major cause of Muslim decline lay in the misunderstanding of the true meaning of the Prophet's message and its subsequent distortion by later developments in Islamic history. Said Halim explains the decline of Muslim societies with reference to their failure to renounce their pre-Islamic heritage. He argues that since the nations which adopted Islam were heirs to old and distinct civilizations, it was inevitable that their respective ancient histories would still exert a strong influence on them. To him, this phenomenon prevented Muslim nations from fully comprehending and implementing the religious tenets of their faith thus depriving them of the blessings of Islam. This situation, continues Said Halim, had led to a paralysis which left Muslim societies inert between their pre-Islamic legacy and pristine Islamic doctrine, constituting a continuous hindrance to their development. To Said Halim the only way to achieve progress was for Muslims to swing the pendulum in favor of a pristine interpretation of Islam.\n\nREFORM IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE During the first half of the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire was faced with many external and internal challenges. Changing economic and social factors in the European provinces of the empire favored the emergence of local Balkan nationalism. Among these factors were the rise of a strong Christian (especially Orthodox) merchant class; the economic growth of Austria, which started to exert important economic, cultural, and political influences on the Balkan peoples lying south of her borders; and finally, the spread of humanist ideas such as those espoused by the leaders of the French Revolution. Such revolutionary thought played an important role in the formation of nationalist movements in the Balkans: in 1817, for instance Serbia gained her autonomy. This was followed by Greece's independence in 1830. These territorial losses were the result of a series of military defeats mainly at the hands of Russia, which emerged as a major power in the second half of the eighteenth century. Alarmed, the Ottoman sultans adopted a series of military and administrative reforms to modernize the empire. The first systematic reforms were undertaken by Sultan Selim III (1789-1807). Selim began in 1793 by modernizing the artillery. The first military reforms had been undertaken by Sultan Mahmud I (1730-1747), who\n\n20\n\nS AiD\n\nH A L i M\n\nP A S H A\n\nemployed a French artillery expert, Claude Alexandre, Comte de Bonneval (1675-1747). After converting to Islam and adopting the name Ahmed, Bonneval was commissioned by the reformist Grand Vizir Topai Osman Pasha to reorganize the Bombardiers corps ( H u m b a r a Ocagi)} Selim's personal initiative was to create a new army, the Nizam-i Cedid, trained in European methods and armed with modern weapons. At the same time he reformed the navy by expanding and modernizing the imperial arsenal (Tersane-i Amire) and builing a new fleet. Although priority in Selim's reforms was given to military issues, he also undertook administrative reforms. These consisted of restructuring the central government in an effort to increase its efficiency. During his reign Selim had a vacillating attitude towards the bureaucratic centralization. On the one hand, he tried to restore the eroded power and authority of the Ottoman governors (valis) in the provinces so as to curb the autonomist tendencies of the local notables (ayans) and, on the other, he had to ally himself with some local feudal lords (derebeys) and try to play them off against each other in order to consolidate his authority 2 . On this issue Ariel Salzmann wrote that: \"Despite stated intentions, recentralization of fiscality and the implementation of the proposed military reforms were not accomplished without considerable vacillation, backtracking and compromise however.\" 3 According to Salzmann, \"[djue to the urgency of military needs, the regime was forced more than once to reverse policy on provincial military and fiscal matters in order to win loyalties or to mobilize troops from strategically positioned provincial magnates\". 4 If credit for initiating the modernization of the Ottoman military and administrative institutions belongs to Selim III, then the recognition must be given to his cousin and eventual successor Mahmud II (1808-1839) for allowing the reform movement to take root finally in the soil of the empire. Selim's ideas were realized on a much larger scale under Mahmud II, who ^For further information on Comte de Bonncval-Ahmed Pasha see his memoirs, Nouveaux mémoires du Comte de Bonneval, ci-devant général de l'infanterie au service de S.M.

These changes transformed the bureaucratic structure of the empire and paved the way for further secularization and Westernization of Ottoman statecraft.1 When the wars with Russia (1827-1829) and Egypt (1831-1833) ended, Mahmud II focused his energies on military, administrative, and educational reform. 2 His military reforms began immediately after the elimination of the age-old and archaic Janissary corps in June 1826. The Janissaries had proven their obsolescence once again by their failure to suppress the Greek Rebellion (1821-1829). In order to replace them Mahmud created a new army called the Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye (The Victorious Mohammedan Soldiers) whose organization was based on the Nizam-i Cedid army created by Selim III in 1792. Like his predecessors, Mahmud turned to the European Powers for military instructors. However, unlike previous reformist sultans such as Abdiilhamid I (1774-1789) and Selim III 3 who were concerned mostly with modernizing the military, Mahmud undertook a series of major bureaucratic reforms in order to restructure the outdated Ottoman administration. He reasoned that centralization of the civil service would result in a more efficient and firmer control over the provinces by the central government. Mahmud's administrative reforms not only made government structures more effective, they also enhanced the sultan's role in the empire's governing hierarchy. This second modification had the effect of limiting the grand vizir's authority. With few exceptions such as Murad IV (1630-1640), a succession of weak sultans had allowed the grand vizirs to make the policies of the government. Under Mahmud II, the grand vizir was no longer the sultan's powerful vicegerent, enjoying a key role in the decision-making process. ^Niyazi Berkes, The Development of Secularism in Turkey (Montreal: McGill University Press, 1964), pp. 91-135.

It was now clear who was the head of the government. This diminution of the grand vizir's power was reflected in the new title of \"prime minister\" (Ba§ Vekil) given to this post in 1838. Many of the grand vizir's duties and privileges were now assigned to separate ministries, including the Ministry of the Interior (Dahiliye Nezareti) and the Ministry of Legal Actions (Divan-i Deavi Nezareti) which later became the Ministry of Justice (Adliye Nezareti). Other ministries also had to be created: for example, a Ministry of Finance (Umur-u Maliye Nezareti) took over the financial functions which had formerly been controlled by the Imperial Treasury (Hazine-i Amire) and the Imperial Mint (Darphane-i Amire)} Another important achievement was the creation in March 1836 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Hariciye Nezareti), which assumed the duties performed by the scribal offices formerly under the direction of the Chief Scribe (Reis iil-Kuttap). Mahmud II did not content himself with military and bureaucratic reforms: he also undertook the reform of the educational system. The reforms carricd out in these three domains were closely interrelated: the new schools inaugurated by Mahmud were crucial in training the personnel necessary to staff and run the new bureaucracy and military that he created. This was the only way to assure the success of his reforms. Mahmud established many modern institutions of learning; some were built on the foundations of institutions already in existence, such as the School of Engineering (first opened in 1734 and reinstituted in 1769), and the naval academy (established in 1776). Unfortunately, most of these establishments had fallen into disuse over time. A new naval engineering school and a medical school were opened in 1827, followed by a military academy in 1834. The graduates of these schools formed the Ottoman military and bureaucratic elite who continued the modernization process.2 According to Said Halim, this new officialdom created by Sultan Mahmud II, while being an efficient tool for implementing Westernizing and centralizing reforms, was nevertheless completely devoid of any social basis. ^Shaw and Shaw, History, pp. 36-38. Ibid„ pp. 48-49.\n\n2\n\nI S L A M I S M\n\n23\n\nIndeed it stood in stark contrast to the traditional Ottoman ruling class who possessed both a social basis and a certain degree of autonomy vis-à-vis the sovereign: Créé par les besoins de la centralisation et destinée à n'être qu'un instrument docile de l'autorité centralisée en la personne du Souverain, cette classe privilégiée de fonctionnaires pouvait bien avoir une valeur administrative, mais elle devait nécessairement être dépourvue d'une valeur sociale réelle. Elle n'avait ni l'indépendance ni la stabilité, ni la tradition, ni les qualités morales et intellectuelles. 1 Said Halim's harsh judgement of the socio-political aspect of the new bureacratic elite is not an accurate reflection of its true nature. Contrary to what he argues, this new bureaucratic class rapidly built its own power base and by the late 1830s became the dominant force in Ottoman politics, especially during the final years of Sultan Mahmud's reign. Unlike Said Halim, who critizicized the Westernizing reform efforts of Selim III and Mahmud II, the majority of high-ranking ulema of the time not only sanctioned and supported these reforms but also involved themselves directly in their design and implementation. 2 By the end of the Tanzimat Period (1839-1876) and with the accession of Sultan Abdùlhamid II (1876-1909) to the throne, government gradually became concentrated in the palace. Indeed, he shifted the decision-making process from the government offices at the Sublime Porte (Bab-i Ali) to the Palace Secretariat (Mabeyn) at Yildiz Palace. 3 The military and bureaucratic reforms achieved by Mahmud II were extended under the reign of his son Abdtilmecid (1839-1861). The implementation of the new reforms was, however, carried out by Mustafa Re§id Pasha (1800-1858), a prominent bureaucrat who was already very actively involved in M a h m u d ' s reform policy. His role was pivotal in designing and implementing the reforms, first during the final years of ^Said Halim Pasha, La Société Ottomane (in typescript), p. 6.

Mustafa Re§id Pasha was known in Ottoman history as \"the Father of the Tanzimat\". 1 The reforms, couched in the form of a decree, were prepared under his direction in close association with another prominent Tanzimat statesman and thinker, Sadik Rifat Pasha (1807-1857), and proclaimed on 3 November 1839 under the name of Gulhane Hatt-i Hiimayunu (Imperial Edict of the Rose Garden). This was a remarkable achievement for Mustafa Re§id Pasha; despite his grip over the affairs of the empire, at the time of the proclamation of the Tanzimat, he was only the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Tanzimat Charter was the final enactment of the ideas and principles which had been gradually developed by reformist bureaucrats like Re§id Pasha and Sadik Rifat Pasha in collaboration with the reformist Sultan Mahmud II. Nevertheless, the political ideas of Rcsid and Sadik Rifat Pashas were different from Mahmud's ideas in quite important ways. Both pashas considered the monarch too autocratic and superficial in his reforming efforts; therefore, they tried to curb his power by solidly establishing \"the rule of law\" into the Ottoman political system. 2 The basic principles of the Tanzimat Charter are: a) Guaranteed protection by the state of the fundamental rights regarding the security of life, honour and property ; b) Guaranteed right to a fair trial for every person accused of committing a crime; c) Application of the principle of equity in military recruitment; d) Law reform and new legislation respecting the principles of the §eriat; e) Equality of Muslim and non-Muslim subjects of the Sultan before the law. 3 While the first four articles declared the principles inherent to the §eriat, the final one was a considerable radical shift from the point of view of Islamic law. According to Butrus Abu Manneh, the principles decreed in the Gulhane Charter were formulated under the direct influence of Islamic law and inspired by Muslim medieval political thinking, especially by the ideas of alGhazali 4 . Abu Manneh also criticized scholars like Berkes of seeing only the ^For Re§id Pasha's role in the preparation and realization of the Tanzimat reforms, see Re§at Kaynar, Mustafa Regit Pa^a ve Tanzimat (Ankara: Tiirk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1954). ^Berkes, Development, p. 183-184. 3 Ibid„ pp. 176-180. 4 Butrus Abu Manneh,\"The Islamic Roots of the Giilhane Rescript\", Die Welt des Islams 34 (1994): pp. 173-203.\n\nI SLAMIS M\n\n25\n\ninfluence of Western political thought in the content of the Giilhane Charter. In my opinion the latter judgement is problematic since Berkes acknowledges that \"the §eriat laws [are] embodied in the Charter as fundamentals\". 1 In his analysis of Giilhane Charter, Halil Inalcik concludes that, although the charter was promulgated according to classical Ottoman tradition, it also indcniably contains some \"modern revolutionary principles\". 2 On the other hand, liber Ortayh and Tekin Akiilioglu argue that while it is difficult to deny the influence of French political concepts on the development of the Tanzimat Charter, these concepts were nevertheless skilfully adapted to the realities of Ottoman statecraft by the reformist bureaucrats of Mahmud's administration, especially by Sadik Rifat Pasha, and the result was a genuine political document. 3 The legal reforms promised in the Giilhane Charter began to be implemented soon after its proclamation. In May 1840 a new penal code (ceza kanunnamesi) was promulgated. The new code was a hybrid document combining both European (French) and Islamic legal principles. While it sanctioned the principle of equality between Muslims and non-Muslims before the law, it also retained the ¡¡eri rules of qisas and diya\\ nor did it abolish the death penalty for apostasy against Islam. During the Tanzimat period the penal code was modified twice. The second modification in 1858 was especially radical in nature since the bill was modeled on the French (Napoleonic) penal code of 1810. Niyazi Berkes rightly concludes that this enactment marked \"the introduction of Western legal formulation in the field of Ottoman public law\". 4 Nevertheless, despite its provisions being almost completely drawn from French penal law, the text of the code contained many §eri principles found in former codes. Penal law reform was followed by the codification of commercial law. Here too French law, more specifically the French commercial code of 1807, was a source. The Ottoman version was enacted in 1850. 5 1\n\nBerkes, Development, p. 145. Halil inalcik, \"Sened-i Ittifak ve Giilhane Hattr Humayunu.\"_Be//eten. 28 (October 1964): pp 581-622.

There was civil and religious strife in Lebanon between the Druzes and the Maronites (a chronic problem between 1841 and 1861)1 as well as external threats including Russian claims to the Holy Places in Palestine (May 1853). 2 These last crises ultimately led to the Crimean War (1853-1855). Moreover, conservative political forces within the empire were continually trying to hamper the reform movement. 3 These forces included old-fashioned pashas still attached to the traditional order which allowed them more power and autonomy than the newly enacted reforms; conservative members of the ulema and miiltezims (tax farmers) who built their fortunes by overtaxing the reaya\\ as well as other beneficiaries of the ancien régime. All violently attacked the Tanzimat Charter and the reforms it brought. At the end of the Crimean War, Sultan Abdiilmecid, under pressure from Britain, agreed to introduce a new reform project, which was embodied in an edict called the Islahat Fermant, better known to European historians as the Hatt-i Humayun. Proclaimed on 18 February 1856, the new decree was significanly different from the Tanzimat Charter of 1839. Unlike the latter, the new reform edict did not combine Islamic and European legal maxims; rather it made a clear break from Islamic legal tradition. After reasserting the principle of equality between Muslim and non-Muslim subjects of the sultan, the Hatt-i Humayun of 1856 enforced this principle by recognizing the full equality of non-Muslims and Muslims in matters of military and civil services, justice, taxation, and access to educational institutions.\n\nREACTION TO MOVEMENT\n\nTHE\n\nTANZIMAT:\n\nTHE\n\nYOUNG\n\nOTTOMAN\n\nThe discontent with the reforms which was first voiced over the Tanzimat Charter and later again with the Islahat edict was expressed by a ^For a critical account of this troubled period in Lebanese history, see the work of Leila Tarazi Fawaz, An Occasion for War: Civil Conflict in Lebanon and Damascus in 1860 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994).

The Young Ottoman movement began in protest against the inability of Tanzimat statesmen to restore the empire's political and economic position, and in opposition to their compliance with the European Powers whose chancelleries were dominating the Porte. 1 It was born in the famous Terciime Odasi (Translation Bureau) of the Porte, 2 where young clerks learned foreign languages, particularly French, and through these languages came in contact with European ideas. Although these liberal notions played a very important role in the formation of Young Ottoman thought, the essence of the ideology was nonetheless imbued with Islamic principles. In Islam, Young Ottomans found many of the ideas that had become prominent during the European Enlightenment, such as liberty, justice, and patriotism. 3 In their opinion, Locke's ideas regarding representative government were already anticipated in the Qur'an under the concept of mushawara.4 Also, early Islamic policy was, in theory, always drafted according to decisions made in the shura or by a representative council. These ideas were best expressed in the writings of Namik Kemal (1840-1888), a leading figure among Young Ottoman intellectuals. Kemal based his political thought on his adaptation of European liberal ideas to Islamic principles. He introduced two new concepts in Islamic political thought by attributing to the words vatari and hurriyet the Western connotations of fatherland and liberty. 5 In his article entitled Wa Shawirhum f i al Amr, Namik Kemal declares that only a constitutional regime could restore the former strength and prestige of the Ottoman Empire. 6 While earlier documents like the Tanzimat Charter, the Islahat edict and some other recent imperial decrees contained some legal principles, they were not sufficient, according to Kemal, for a civilized state like the Ottoman Empire. In his opinion, a constitutional regime was not only necessary to assure a fair administration for Ottoman subjects but also to deny Russia any opportunity of making further inroads into the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire, especially under the pretext of protecting the sultan's Christian subjects. It would also convince Europe of the fairness of the Ottoman administration.\n\nThe best study on the Young Ottoman movement is still §erif Mardin's The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963). (Hereafter cited as Mardin, Genesis). 2 T h e Translation Bureau was founded in 1821 during the Greek Revolt in order to replace Phanariote Greek dragomans with Muslim translators (the dragomans were suspected of participating in the Greek Revolution).

For him, the concept of fatherland was not limited to the Ottoman lands but encompassed all Islamic realms which were united by the memory of a common and glorious past. Namik Kemal's vision of a fatherland is imbued with nostalgia and steeped in romanticism. He describes it as: \"not composed of the vague lines traced by the sword of a conqueror or the pen of a scribe. It is a sacred idea resulting from the conglomeration of various noble feelings such as the people, liberty, brotherhood, interest, sovereignty, respect for one's ancestors, love of family and childhood memories.\" 1 Nevertheless, despite his strong emphasis on Islam as the basis of his patriotism, Namik Kemal did not exclude non-Muslim elements of the empire from his construction of fatherland. He was strongly committed to the feasibility of a Pan-Ottoman union which would include the empire's nonMuslim communities. In Namik Kemal's opinion the different religions, languages, and races existing in the Ottoman Empire did not form an obstacle to the formation of an Ottoman nation. 2 He concluded that a proper education would be the key to reducing cultural differences among diverse elements of the empire. This policy would include a uniform syllabus which would instill patriotism in the minds of the new generation. The above summary shows how Namik Kemal's ideas on Ottoman nationalism were of an ambivalent nature. While asserting the equality of all Ottomans irrespective of ethnicity or religion and upholding the idea of Ottoman citizenship as a secular concept, he nevertheless considered Islam to be the glue which would hold together the empire and its diverse nationalities. Namik Kemal was the first Muslim thinker in Islamic history to advocate a parliamentary regime. Although his political liberalism was inspired by the liberal ideas of European thinkers such as Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau, it was nevertheless presented in an Islamic discourse. He believed that the concept of representative government had already found its expression in the Qur'an and its application in early Islamic history. The same observation could also be made for the political system of the Ottoman Empire before the centralizing reforms of Mahmud II.\n\n1\n\nAhmet Hamdi Tanpinar, Namik Kemal Antolojisi (Istanbul: Muallim Ahmet Halit Kitap Evi, 1942), p. 61. ^Mardin, Genesis, p. 328.\n\nI S LAM I S M\n\n29\n\nNamik Kemal regarded the classical Ottoman political structure as a precursor of the modern representative regime. The separation of powers Montesquieu argued for in his Spirit of the Laws was already in force in Ottoman politics. Indeed, it was based on a system of chccks and balances: for example, the sultan's authority was restrained by the ulema and the Janissaries.1 Another Young Ottoman thinker who took an Islamist approach was Ziya Pasha (1825-1880). Like Namik Kemal, he started his administrative career in the Translation Bureau where he came in contact with the ideas of the Enlightenment. Although a product of the same intellectual milieu, Ziya Pasha differed from Namik Kemal in many aspects. Unlike Kemal, who spent most of his life in exile, Ziya Pasha occupied important positions during his long administrative career. Besides, he was closely connected with the Palace and identified himself with the imperial administration. These characteristics had an undeniable impact on his political thought, which is conservative in nature in comparison to Kemal's ideology. One of the most striking divergences between these two Young Ottoman thinkers lay in Ziya Pasha's aloofness to the concept of liberty (hiirriyet). Notwithstanding Ziya Pasha's being convinced of the necessity of establishing a constitutional government in the Ottoman Empire, he expressed caution toward the preservation of the imperial prerogatives of the sultan. 2 In his opinion the causes of Ottoman decline had been to a large extent generated by the diminution of the sultan's power vis-à-vis the grand vizirate. The ideas of the Young Ottoman thinkers found a receptive ear among the bureaucratic elite of the Porte and the military commanders who decided to depose Sultan Abdiilaziz (1861-1876). The coup d'État which took place on 30 May 1876 came as an answer to the political and economic crises which had gripped the empire for the last five years. On the same day the reignmakers within the Porte bureaucracy, namely Midhat, Hiiseyin Avni, Siileyman and Miitercim Mehmed Rtigdu Pashas, installed Murad V (30 May-7 September 1876) on the throne in order to realize their plan to establish a constitutional regime. On March 19, 1877, the first Ottoman Parliament was convened. The new parliament was composed of two chambers, the House of Deputies (Meclis-i Mebusan) and the Assembly of Notables (Meclis-i Ayan). Members 1 2\n\nIbid., p. 310. Ibid., pp. 340-344.\n\n30\n\nS A I D\n\nH A L I M\n\nP A S H A\n\nof the former chamber were elected by the members of administrative councils located in provincial capitals, sancaks, and districts, while members of the latter were appointed directly by the sultan. Since one of the main principles of the Tanzimat was to consider all subjects of the empire as Ottoman, regardless of their religious affiliation, establishing parliamentary quotas for membership based on religious affiliation was inconceivable. However, the problem of under-representation of the empire's non-Muslim communities had to be addressed and was eventually resolved by assigning a disproportionately high number of deputies to European provinces. Although it constituted an important milestone in Ottoman political history, the Constitution of 1876 did not alter very much the absolute character of the Ottoman monarchy since Article 3 declared that the sovereignty (saltanat) is vested in the eldest member of the House of Osman as the sultan-caliph. 1 The constitution was declared as a result of a popular demand or pressure. It was also granted by the monarch to appease mostly external pressures exerted by the European Powers. To Said Halim, \"this constitution was designed by the dignitaries of the Porte as a means to check the power of the sultan and to curb his absolutism\". 2 The pasha also acknowledges that the Ottoman constitution of 1876 \"provides to the peoples of the Ottoman Empire, which stretches out to the deserts of Arabia and the majority of whose population lives a primitive life under the absolute authority of a religious or tribal chief, such extensive rights that even the most advanced nations of our time do not posses.\" 3 This argument has little validity since there is a quasi-complete consensus among scholars that the constitution of 1876 is far from being a liberal one. In reality, many of the provisions of this constitution conferred large powers on the sultan and left parliament with only limited rights which were also subject to the sanction of the monarch.\n\n' Suna Kili and §eref Goziibuyiik, Turk Anayasa Metinleri, Sened-i ¡ttifaktan Guniimiize (Ankara: fg Bankasi Kiiltur Yayinlan, 1985), p. 31 See also, §eref Gozubtiyuk, Agiklamali Turk Anayasalari.

This became especially evident during the last years of Sultan Abdiilaziz. The Ottomanism of the Tanzimat as a unifying ideology of the empire's diverse peoples did not find much sympathy among the Christian peoples of the Balkan provinces. The revolts in Crete (1866), Herzegovina (1875), and Bulgaria (1876) clearly demonstrated the failure of Pan-Ottomanist policies to fuse together diverse elements of the empire (ittihad-i anasir). The nationalist aspirations of the Christian peoples in the Balkans were the result of economic and social change and an ensuing cultural revival which had swept through these provinces during the second half of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries 1 . They were also motivated by the Pan-Orthodox and Pan-Slavist policies of Russia. Morever, these revolts fitted in with the latter's ambitions to take possession of Istanbul and the Straits as a key to the Black Sea, and to resuscitate the Byzantine Empire. 2 The Porte responded to these rebellions vigorously by sending its troops. At the same time the Muslim populations in these provinces also became involved in the upheavals and many massacres and atrocities were committed by both sides. This was especially true in Bulgaria where thousands of Christians and Muslims died. The result was an atmosphere of hatred and distrust between Muslim and Christian communities. As a consequence of the nationalist revolts in the Balkans and the ensuing war with Russia (18771878), the Ottoman Empire lost many of its European provinces. The end of Ottoman rule in these realms caused a large-scale migration of Muslims from the Balkans toward Anatolia. 3 During this same period a violent anti-Turkish and anti-Muslim campaign started in the West. Many publications expressing hostile opinions about Muslims and Turks were distributed, helping to turn Western public opinion against the Ottoman Empire. The great majority of these books and pamphlets were published in England, including Gladstone's The Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East. Although presented as an\n\n^For the rise of the Balkan nationalism and its causes see Barbara Jelavich. History of the Balkans, Eigtheenth and Nineteenth Centuries.

The situation was further aggravated by a series of extremely bad harvests which began in 1872. The Tanzimat's political and economic failure led to the revival of Islamist ideas in the Ottoman Empire which had been favoured by Sultan Abdiilaziz since the early years of his reign. Domestic and international political events had the effect of gradually enhancing his role as the caliph of all Muslims. 2 Indeed, since the 1860s Muslim lands outside the empire had been exposed to a new wave of European colonial expansionism. In 1859, after ten years of heroic resistance to Russian invasion, Imam Shamil and his fighters were finally overwhelmed by the sheer might of the Tsarist armies. 3 Following Shamil's defeat, hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the Caucasus began to immigrate to Ottoman-ruled lands. Another Muslim region which fell under Russian rule was Central Asia, where Russian hegemony had gradually been imposed on local Muslim Turkic khanates since the mid-1860s. Tsarist rule was completely established in Central Asia with the Russian conquest of the Trans-Caspian Turkmen lands between 1881 and 1884. 4 Russian advances in the Caucasus and Central Asia represented only one facet of European colonial encroachment over the whole of the Muslim world. By the last decade of the nineteenth century, European domination was entrenched in most Muslim countries. France occupied Algeria in 1830, established a protectorate in Tunisia in 1881 and, after the partitioning of Africa at the Congress of Berlin in 1885, united most of the Sub-Saharan Muslim lands into French West Africa. Britain occupied Egypt in 1882 and the Sudan in 1898, after defeating local Muslim resistance forces that were led ' Bcrkcs, Development, p. 219, Donald C.

Britain had already firmly established her rule over the Indian subcontinent after suppressing the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, a revolt which had been led by Indian Muslims. In SouthEast Asia, the Dutch had been at work since the seventeenth century, gradually establishing their overseas empire at the expense of local Muslim states. By the end of the nineteenth century, nearly all of the Indonesian archipelago had come under direct Dutch rule, the exception being an on-going Muslim resistance movement in Aceh, which eventually fell in 1907, after a long period of fierce guerilla fighting. The culmination of these defeats and the establishment of Western colonial rule or protectorate over Muslim countries created a consciousness of solidarity among the Muslim peoples against a common menace which threatened their very existence. The Ottoman Empire, although economically and financially dependent on the West, was the only large politically independent Muslim state during the era of European imperialism, thus making its leadership in the Muslim world unequalled. Also, its capital was the seat of the caliphate and its sultan enjoyed enormous prestige for being the custodian of the two holiest cities of Islam: since 1516, Sultan Selim I (1512-1520), after his victory over the Mamluks, declared himself the \"Servitor of the Two Holy Places\" (Khadim al- Harameyn al-Sharufayn), a title until then held by the Mamluk sultans. 1 Thus, for the Muslim peoples living under colonial domination in Asia and Africa, the Ottoman Sultanate represented a rallying point in their struggle for independence. 2 The answer of the Ottomans to this call constituted a bone of contention among scholars of Ottoman history. During the later years of Sultan Abdiilaziz's reign, Muslim delegations from Central Asian khanates and Indonesian islands visited the Ottoman capital to solicit military assistance from the sultan. In 1874, the Ottoman government gave, in response to a request made by Yakub Beg, amir of Kashgar, substantial military aid to the local Kashgar Muslim resistance who were fighting Russian and Chinese regimes, including a contingent of officers who were experts in training. 3 The Ottoman military assistance to the amir of Kashgar was also encouraged by\n\n^Buzpinar, \"Opposition\", p. 63.

Much ink has been spilled about his Pan-Islamist policy; numerous books, articles, and pamphlets have been published on this subject by Muslim and Western scholars since the last quarter of the nineteenth century. However, the Pan-Islamist policy of Abdiilhamid has remained controversial. Scholars are divided on this issue: some like Orhan Kologlu and Caesar Farah do not accept the fact that Sultan Abdiilhamid II had a well defined pan-Islamic policy. This last view was put forward by Jacob Landau who argued that Pan-Islamism was the \"Imperial Ideology\" of the Hamidian Regime. Landau based his view on the vast body of literature by European writers, particularly French historians, who, during the reign of Abdiilhamid and shortly after his deposition in 1909, presented the Ottoman sultan and his government as the principal organizers of Pan-Islamic activities. 2 In their minds they saw their colonial lands and territories being swept away by a wave of Muslim crusades or, more accurately, crescentades,3 whose objective was to incite Muslims to revolt against European rule and to destroy colonial empires. This view has been refuted by Engin Akarli who argued that \"Abdulhamid was realistic enough to know that the task of protecting all Muslims was beyond the capacities of the Ottoman State. He hoped that at least Muslims living within Ottoman borders could be rallied around the common cause of self protection\". 4 According to Akarli if Abdulhamid \"pretended to the leadership of all Muslims, that was only to foil foreign pressures on the Ottoman government by gaining leverage over European powers who had Muslim dominions.\" 5 Reflecting Akarli's view, Caesar Farah also wrote in his article entitled \"Reassessing Sultan Abdiilhamid's Islamic policy\" that \"Abdulhamid preferred to use the sword of Islam like the sword of Damocles to frighten and intimidate his enemies, more specifically to scare off the vultures of imperial Christiandom, rather than to\n\n*Lois Frechtling. \"Anglo-Russian Rivalry in Eastern Turkestan, 1863-1881\" Journal of Royal Central Asian Society 27 (1939): pp. 471-489. A myriad of European writers, mostly French and British, produced this vast literature about Pan-Islam. One of the best known examples was Gabriel Charmes's L'avenir de la Turquie - Le Panislamisme (Paris: Caiman-Levy, 1883). 3 Lee, D.E., \"The Origins of Pan-Islamism.\" American Historical Review 47 (Jan. 1942): p. 282. 4 Engin Deniz Akarh \"The Problems of External Pressures, Power Struggles, and Budgetary Deficits in Ottoman Politics under Abdulhamid II (1876-1909): Origins and Solutions.\" ( Ph.D diss., Princeton University, 1976), p. 60.

According to Karpat, Pan-Islamism first appeared as a social phenomenon among the Muslim folk of the empire as a response to the military and political decline of the Ottoman power in Europe and its subsequent consequences which dramatically affected their lives. 3 Another major organ of diffusion of Pan-Islamist ideas among Muslims inside and outside the empire was the Muslim press. Since the 1870s, certain Ottoman periodicals had become the mouthpiece of Pan-Islamism. The most prominent of them, Basiret, an Istanbul daily, propagated the idea that world Islamic unity should be realized under the leadership of the Ottoman caliphate. 4 The same newspaper also urged Muslims to support Muslim resistance in Algeria and India. Under the reign of Sultan Abdiilhamid II, the Pan-Islamic press campaign continued to flourish and many additional periodicals were founded. Among them was Mizan (The Balance), which began publication in Istanbul in 1886 as a weekly magazine under editor-in-chief Mehmed Murad (18531912), called Mizanci. A native of Daghestan, and educated in Russia, Murad immigrated to the Ottoman Empire and became a professor of history and philosophy at the Mulkiye (School of Civil Service, established to train personnel for the Tanzimat bureaucracy in Istanbul on 12 February 1859). In his articles in Mizan, Murad advocated an Islamic constitutional regime where the sultan's authority would be limited by the provisions of the §eriat, particularly by those which ordained the establishment of a regime of me§veret. Although he pleaded for a constitutional regime, the concept of\n\n^Caesar Farah, \"Reassessing Sultan Abdiilhamid II's Islamic Policy.\" Archivum Ottomanicum 14 (1995/1996): p. 192. 2 Ibid., p. 194.

Considering that the majority of the empire's Muslims were Arabs, the Ottoman government largely relied on the Arabic press to carry on its Pan-Islamic propaganda. Al-Jawaib was the major Arabic periodical published in the Ottoman Empire which engaged in PanIslamic propaganda. Printed in Istanbul and supported financially by the Palace, it was at the service of the Hamidian regime. This paper became especially well-known during France's invasion of Tunisia in 1881 because of its role in fostering resistance to the French. 2 To strengthen his authority in the Arab provinces and to integrate them into the Ottoman system, Abdiilhamid increasingly employed civil servants and officers of Arab origin in the Ottoman administration. 3 He also founded a special boarding school in Istanbul where the sons of Arab tribal chiefs received government scholarships. 4 Abdiilhamid also established direct and personal relations with many important Arab tribal chiefs to bring them under his control. One of the most important of these sheiks was Ibn Reshid, the amir of Shammar who had the privilege of communicating directly with the sultan by using a private telegraph code. 5 Besides certain sufi tarikats and the press, other Pan-Islamic propaganda tools used by Abdiilhamid included emissaries. During his long reign, the sultan sent many delegations and emissaries to many corners of the Muslim world in order to propagate his version of Pan-Islamism and to establish his spiritual authority over Muslims in Asia and Africa. It was for this reason that many Ottoman delegations were dispatched to Central Asia, Afghanistan, India, China, Java, and central and eastern Africa. 6\n\n^For an extensive study of Mizanci Murad's life and thought, see Birol Emil, Mizanci Murad Bey: hayati ve eserleri.

The most notorious and influential of them was Sheikh Abulhuda al-Sayyadi. 1 Al-Sayyadi was a sheikh of the R i f a ' i order in Aleppo who, besides organizing\n\nthe\n\ntarikat network in the Arab provinces in an effort to consolidate the sultan's power, also wrote many Pan-Islamist pamphlets to justify Abdiilhamid II's right to the caliphate. He also publicized the doctrine of the Rifaiyah order among Muslims. According to B. Abu-Manneh there are 212 publications bearing al-Sayyadi's name, almost all of which were published between 1880 and 1908. In his writings he defended the view that the system of absolute government in Islam derives from basic religious tenets and can be cited from the Quranic verse \"Obey God, his prophet, and those entrusted with authority among you.\" This view was the complete opposite of that defended by his much more famous nemesis, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani (1839-1897) an internationally renowned Muslim political writer and activist. 2 Early in 1892 the sultan invited Jamal ad-Din to Istanbul. While Abdiilhamid's intentions were to make al-Afghani a valuable instrument in his Pan-Islamist policy, he soon became suspicious of his activities and placed alAfghani under strict surveillance and comfortable confinement. The sultan was responding to rumors that Afghani was involved in a British plot to establish an Arab caliphate in cooperation with the khedive of Egypt Abbas Hilmi. 3 Consequently, Afghani was severely restricted in pursuing Pan-Islamist activities in the Ottoman capital; he could, however, correspond with the Shi'i ulema of Iraq and Iran in order to garner their support for the sultan's policies and bring the Ottoman Shi'i population under his influence. 4 Afghani died in Istanbul in 1897 of cancer of the jaw. Rumors that he had been poisoned by the sultan were false. 5\n\n^For a very interesting study on Abulhuda al-Sayyadi and his relations with Sultan Abdulhamid II, see B.

The anti-imperialist, Pan-Islamist ideas that he endeavored to spread across the Muslim world were engendered by Young Ottoman thinkers, especially by Namik Kemal, and adopted by Sultan Abdiilhamid II as his regime's principal ideology. Afghani first expounded his Pan-Islamist ideas in a long letter (probably written during the Russo-Ottoman war of 1877-1878) to an Ottoman statesman in the hope of its being presented to the sultan. In the letter, he proposed the formation of a defensive alliance against Russian expansionism lead by the Ottoman sultan and composed of the three major Muslim powers of Western and Central Asia, namely the Ottoman Empire, Iran, and Afghanistan. With this pact, Afghani envisioned the first concrete step towards the realization of the \"Unity of Islam\" (ittihad-i islamiye) and the \"union of community\" (ittifdq-i umma).1 Furthermore, he hoped to obtain British support for this project through the mediation of Indian Muslims, and eventually to provoke a war between Russia and Britain over Central Asia. Such confrontations would, he hoped, wear down the two imperial powers and ultimately force them to give up their domination over the Muslim world. Besides being a fervent advocate of the unity of the Muslim world, Afghani also encouraged the creation of local nationalist movements. The articles he wrote in India between 1879 and 1882 echoed his earlier teachings in Egypt in the 1870s in that they put much emphasis on a nation's culture and its pre-Islamic heritage. 2 Afghani believed that Egyptian and Indian Muslims should be proud of their pre-Islamic heritage and should treasure it because it would foster their development. On this point Afghani's teachings were in complete opposition to what Said Halim felt about pre-Islamic heritage. (Afghani strongly emphasized this pre-Islamic aspect in Indian nationalism as opposed to Pan-Islamism in order to unite all Indians — both Hindus and Muslims — against British imperialism.) This modification in his campaign is an example of his pragmatic approach to anti-imperialism.\n\n1 2\n\nIbid., p. 135. Ibid„ pp. 159-160.\n\nI SLAMIS M\n\n39\n\nPAN-ISLAMISM IN SAiD HALiM'S THOUGHT In spite of a general awakening in the Muslim world, Said Halim perceived a potential danger in the increasing encroachment of European imperalism on Muslim lands. The apprehension felt by the European powers about their Muslim colonies was caused by their misconception of the nature and aims of this Pan-Islamic revival. Said Halim asserted that, contrary to what Europeans thought, the latter movement did not harbour a belligerent character and certainly did not preach the rallying of Muslims around a despotic authority which would encourage supporters to commit massacres. PanIslamism, in his view, represented neither a political union of peoples belonging to the same faith, nor it was an occult religious sect or secret politicial association; rather, it was the leading voice of progress and liberty in Muslim societies. For Said Halim, the idea of Pan-Islam represented the desire of the intellectual elites of Muslim countries to ensure the salvation of the Islamic world through liberty and progress. Pan-Islamism represented the revival of an Islamic conscience among Muslims all over the world who were determined to liberate themselves from the shackles of ignorance and servitude by improving their intellectual prowess, their capacities and their material condition. Said Halim maintained that the oppressors of the Muslim peoples were not only their Western colonizers, but also their own despotic rulers who were directly responsible for the present degradation of Muslims by keeping them through coercion in a state of ignorance and servility and hindering their development. Therefore, he declared that Muslims had to unite not only against European colonialism, but also against despotic potentates who ruled over them oppressively, even if one of these were the caliph himself. 1 After refuting the view that Pan-Islamism preached enmity against Christian Europe, Said Halim commented on political and social revolutions in Europe and compared them with the modern Islamic revival. Since, he argued, it was accepted that these revolutions were pursued in the name of liberty and progress, the West had no right to accuse the Pan-Islamic movement of fanaticism when, like the revolutions in Europe, it aspired to establish the rules of liberty and progress in Muslim lands. 2 The Pan-Islamic revival, affirmed Said Halim, would restore to the Islamic World its former might and splendor by emancipating it from the decay of its civilization. ^Said Halim, Pan-lslamisme, Ibid„ p. 6.\n\n2\n\npp. 5, 8-9.\n\n40\n\nSAID\n\nHALiM\n\nPASHA\n\nAccording to Said Halim, Muslim ulema had come into contact with the scholastic ideas during the Crusades through their dealings with Christian European clergy. Eventually, this scholasticism began to dominate Islamic intellectual life and to hinder its development. 1 Thus, whereas Afghani considered the Pan-Islamic movement primarily as a rallying ideology for the Muslim world to fight Western colonial encroachments, Said Halim believed that Pan-Islamism would lead to the regeneration of Muslim society through a revival of past accomplishments. This is very much reminiscent of Muhammad Abduh's position who sought the salvation of the Muslim World in an intellectual and religious awakening more than in an anti-imperialist political struggle against the colonial powers. Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905), one of the most prominent and influential Muslim modernist thinkers of that era, had first embarked on his intellectual and political career as a disciple and collaborator of Jamal-ad-Din al-Afghani. In 1884, they published in Paris al-'Urwa al-Wuthqà (The Firm Bond), a short lived but famous Pan-Islamist journal which played a crucial role in the awakening of Muslim consciousness and the spread of Pan-Islamist ideas in Muslim lands. While they shared the same goals and ideals, Abduh proposed different methods of emancipation than his mentor. Instead of revolutionary activism, Abduh advocated gradual reform in order to heal the ills of Muslim societies and reverse their inner decay. According to Abduh, Islam is a rational religion; indeed, the Qur'an urges man to investigate Allah's creation by using his intellect. For Abduh, the real Muslim is the one who thinks and acts according to reason. In his view, Muslims had generally accepted that in case of disaccord between rational and traditional explanations of a given matter, precedence would be given to the one based on reason. Islamic teaching had for centuries been kept under restraint by the ulema who relied heavily on taqlid. In his Risàia, writing on the commentary on Chapter II, Verse 243 of the Qur'an, Abduh accused \"those who believe in taqlid\" to be very far \"from the guidance of the Kur'an \" and reproached the ulema for \"infecting the hearts of the masses with taklid.\"2 Abduh refuted the reasoning of the vindicators of the taqlid who argued that only members of the Salaf or early generation of Muslims were able to understand the true meaning ^Ibid., p. 9; Said Halim Pacha, Les institutions politiques Imprimerie Editrice Italia, 1921), pp. 7, 18. ^Adams, Islam and Modernism, pp. 130-131.\n\ndans la société musulmane\n\n(Rome:\n\nISLAMISM\n\n41\n\nof Qur'anic principles corrcctly and that later generations should therefore follow them without question. This argument, asserted Abduh, contradicted the real message of Islam, which \"turned aside the hearts of men from exclusive attachment to customs and practices of the fathers which had been handed down from father to son.\" \"Islam,\" he said, \"attributed folly and levity to those who accept blindly the words of their predecessors.\"1 According to Abduh: precedence in point of time [in IslamJ [wasj not a mark of superiority of intellect or intelligence; but that the preceding generations and the later are on an equality so far as critical acumen and natural abilities are concerned. Indeed, the later generations have a knowledge of past circumstances and a capacity to reflect upon them, and to profit by the effects of them in the world, which have survived until their times, that the fathers and the forefathers who preceded them did not have. 2 It is evident from the above that Muhammad Abduh preferred the modern interpretation of Islam proposed by the current generation. Having said that, he urged Muslims in his writings \"to understand the religion [of Islam] as the early generation understood it, before the appearance of divisions among them.\" 3 What Abduh was critical of was the slavish imitation of and the opinionated adherence to the doctrines of medieval Muslim jurists. According to Abduh, the reforms of Muhammad Ali had divided Egyptian society into two groups. On one side stood the conservative Muslim majority loyal to their traditions and hostile to any kind of reform and on the other side stood the Western-minded minority who wanted to Westernize and modernize Egypt and who held little respect for her traditional Islamic heritage. Since, says Abduh, the latter controlled the country's political and economic power, their influence was enabling them to gain ground at the expense of traditional Muslims. Muhammad Ali and his successors had tried to modernize Egypt by importing and \"planting European institutions and laws to her soil\". 4 Although Abduh did not deny the benefits that accrued from the efforts to modernize Egypt, he argued that importing foreign institutions and laws could not really work because they were alien to the country. Also, the country's citizens would not understand them and would consequentely not comply with them. These same ideas were adopted by Said Halim in his criticism of the Tanzimait reforms in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nkbid., p. 132.

While traditional Islamists considered him to be a defender of Islamic values against Westernizing reforms, Westernists admired his patriotic and enlightened approach. Nevertheless, it is also true that Abduh was the object of severely critical attacks of a coalition of thinkers in the final years of his tenure as the chief mufti of Egypt. Many of his so-called opponents were also less Islamists than Abduh. Among them we can mention Mustafa Kamil who criticized Abduh \"because he cared too much for having official influence\" 1 , and Qasim Amin (1865-1908) who declared that \"Sharia was the first law to provide for the equality of women with men\" 2 . Although Abduh was a conservativemodernist Muslim thinker, his ideas prepared the ground, especially in Egypt, for the further development of secularism. Indeed, most of his disciples later became secularist thinkers. 3 According to Albert Hourani, by challenging the traditional interpretation of the ulema, Abduh unintentionially exposed Islam to the devastating influences of modernity. Abduh, argues Hourani, \"had intended to build a wall against secularism; he had in fact provided an easy bridge by which it could capture one position after another\". 4 As for Abduh's attitude toward folk Islam, it was at best ambivalent: while he believed in the existence of holy men in Islam who were friends of the Prophet (awliyâ) and recognized their extraordinary power in granting karàmas or wonders and grace-gifts, he could not accept their capacity of performing mujizât (miracles). He criticized those who expected favors and intercessions from dead saints by visiting their tombs. Another Muslim modernist thinker was Hayreddin Pasha of Tunis (1822-1889). 5 He was born in the Caucasus and brought to Istanbul as a young boy in order to be raised in the household of a high-ranking Ottoman bureaucrat. In 1840 he was recruited into the service of Ahmad Bey of Tunis where his talents allowed him to advance rapidly to prominence. In 1873 he hbid., p. 160.

In September 1878, following his dismissal by the bey, Hayreddin Pasha returned to Istanbul and entered the service of the Ottoman State. In December 1878 he was appointed grand vizir by Abdiilhamid II. Hayreddin submitted to the sultan many lengthy reports by proposing the administrative, financial, and judicial reforms. Although some of his reform projects had been implemented and increased government efficiency, he eventually came into conflict with Abdiilhamid on the issue of extending the power of the grand vizir and the ministers. The sultan considered this as an encroachment upon his authority. 1 Consequently he was dismissed and spent the rest of his life in retirement. Hayreddin Pasha expounded his social and political ideas in a work published in Tunis in 1867 under the title of Aqwarn al-Masàlik fi Ma'rifat Ahwal al Mamâlik (The Surest Path to Knowledge Concerning the Conditions of Countries) which has been partially translated into French and published in Paris under the title of Réformes nécessaires aux États musulmans. In his work, Hayreddin Pasha leveled criticism at Islamic civilization and compared it with the West whose progress had aroused his admiration. Muslim countries, advocated Hayreddin Pasha, should emulate Europe in their modernization. He thoroughly supported the reforms of the Tanzimat which, in his view benefitted the Ottoman"
