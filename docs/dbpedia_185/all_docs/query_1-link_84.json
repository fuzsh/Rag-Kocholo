        "text": "The Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) was the most important political actor of the Constitutional Revolution of 1908. This organization attempted to dominate the existing governments during the initial years of the Second Constitutional Period. After the coup of January 1913, however, the CUP seized direct control of power and engaged in the establishment of a single-party government. This essay deals with the transition from the CUP’s indirect rule in the period of 1908 – 1913 to the singleparty regime in the period of 1913 – 1918. It focuses on the CUP’s internal struggles to discuss under what conditions and how this single-party regime emerged. To this end, the paper critically evaluates the military – civilian distinction that is seen as an important dynamic in the Unionist movement. It is argued that this distinction does not provide an adequate analytical framework for the analysis of power relations in the CUP. The main issue on which the article focuses is a debate about a political strategy, which emerged in the second half of 1912, when the CUP was pushed into opposition and the Ottoman Parliament dominated by the Unionist deputies was dissolved. In this context the Unionists discussed their position about the elections to be held for the new parliament. Representing a revolutionary tendency, the proposal of boycotting the elections caused a polarization among the Unionist cadres, which cannot be explained based on a schism between the military and civilian factions. The CUP Congress of 1912 convened in the shadow of this polarization. The main argument of the article is that the Unionist single-party regime relied on, in fact institutionalized, a balance of power between the two sides that represented the opposite views in the Congress of 1912. The split that appeared in the Unionist movement in the second half of 1912 played a decisive role in the formation of a political mechanism after the assassination of Mahmut Şevket Paşa. At the center of this mechanism was the CUP and its highest decision-making body, the General Council. The single-party rule rested on the institutional infrastructure created in the CUP Congress of 1913. It involved the army, the government, legislative bodies, guild associations, cooperatives as well. This infrastructure almost reflected the networks of relations that became visible in the Congress of 1912. The Ottoman Empire entered the Great War in this political context where the lines separating the CUP, the state, and the government were getting blurred. The Unionist single-party regime stayed in power till the end of the war.\n\nABSTRACT The armistice of Mudros, signed by the Ottoman Empire and the Allies, ironically brought about optimism and deep sadness among Ottomans. Soldiers and civilians wished that the Armistice would have heralded a peaceful period for the Empire that had experienced warfare since the Balkan Wars. However, the Ottoman soldiers had to choose whether to return to civilian life or resist the Allies’ occupation. Many veterans looked forward to restarting their civil lives, even though some high-ranking officers looked for ways to save their homes from invasion. The latter thought that the Allies were disrespectful to the articles in the armistice of Mudros or violated them. Thus, some of the Ottoman commanders postponed the demobilization of the army for the preparation of a post-war resistance. The self-narrated documents of soldiers’, especially the ones belonging to low-ranking soldiers, proved their reluctance for a new war due to their physical and psychological exhaustion. After all, many veterans desired to continue their lives as if nothing had happened in the Empire.

Askerler ve siviller bu ateşkesin Balkan Savaşlarından bu yana savaş havası içinde yaşayan imparatorluk için barışçıl bir dönemin habercisi olmasını arzuladılar; ancak Osmanlı subayları, sivil hayata geri dönmek veya İtilaf Devletlerinin başlattığı işgallere karşı direnmek arasında bir tercih yapmak zorunda kaldılar. Bazı üst düzey subaylar, imparatorluğu işgallerden kurtarmanın yollarını ararken pek çok eski asker, sivil yaşama dönmeyi dört gözle bekliyordu. Osmanlı ordusunun yüksek rütbeli subayları Müttefiklerin Mondros’taki maddeleri ihlal ya da tahrif ettiğini düşünüyorlardı. Bu yüzden savaş sonrası direniş hazırlığı için ordunun terhisini durdurdular ya da ertelediler. Askerlerin ben anlatıları, özellikle düşük rütbedeki askerlerin fiziksel ve psikolojik yorgunluk nedeniyle yeni bir savaş için isteksiz olduğunu ortaya koymaktadır. Neticede birçok eski asker, hayatını imparatorlukta hiçbir şey olmamış gibi sürdürmek istemiştir. Anahtar Kelimeler: Birinci Dünya Savaşı, Osmanlı Devleti, Terhis, Osmanlı Ordusu, Kurtuluş Savaşı\n\nThis article seeks to answer four interrelated questions: What was the organizational nature of the Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa (TM)?; Was it an intelligence organization or a vigilante band?; What was the political and military context within which the organization evolved?; and What was the role of the organization in World War I? I argue that the TM evolved out of the revolutionary guerilla activities in the Balkans and became a special force organization during World War I. It evolved in response to a semi-colonial and collapsing Ottoman state with little military capacity to protect its borders. The TM participated in a number of covert operations to instigate Islamic insurrections in India, Africa, and Russia, and its methods included the killing of Muslim as well as Christian opponents of the CUP government during World War I."
