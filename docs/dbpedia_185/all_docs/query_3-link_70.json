        "text": "About this campaign\n\nVolunteer transcriptions now enable discovery and access for portions of this collection. Search them.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt’s (1858-1919) busy life as a politician, public servant, historian, soldier, conservationist, author, adventurer, statesman, and family man reflected his wide-ranging interests. He was also a prolific writer of books, articles, and especially letters, and received as much mail as he sent.\n\nThis campaign is chronological groupings from Series 1 of the Theodore Roosevelt Papers, Letters Received and Related Material from throughout his life. His correspondents ranged from heads of states to average Americans, and covered subjects as diverse as politics and political reform, wars and military policy, foreign relations, books and literature, family life, pets, the natural world, history, simplified spelling, cattle ranching, coal strikes, social functions, camping trips and safaris. His outgoing letters are being transcribed in the “My great mass of papers”: Correspondence of Theodore Roosevelt campaign.Transcription of Theodore Roosevelt’s voluminous correspondence will shed light on the issues that came before him in both his public career and private life, and provide clues on how he hoped to be viewed by posterity.\n\nThe three-volume Index to the Theodore Roosevelt Papers and cataloging data in the Theodore Roosevelt Center’s expanding digital library may be helpful in transcribing names, dates, and general subjects contained in individual letters.\n\nInstructions: Many of the letters received by Theodore Roosevelt during his presidency contain secretarial notes in shorthand, likely based on TR’s dictated replies. Shorthand is frequently found in documents from his first administration (Sept. 1901-Mar. 1905). If you find shorthand, do not transcribe it but type out [[shorthand]] where you see it appear. For more information or to ask a question, please see our History Hub post on shorthand.\n\nAbout this project\n\nNote:Transcriptions from this project have been returned to loc.gov for search and discovery. As a result, we will not be reopening completed pages from this project. Contact us with any additional questions.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) was a prolific writer of books, articles, and especially letters, and received as much mail as he sent. His correspondents ranged from heads of states to average Americans, and covered a wide range of topics. Discover what Roosevelt and his correspondents had to say about the issues of their day.\n\nMatters relating to the presidential election arrived in President Roosevelt’s mail in the second half of 1904, along with the normal communications about domestic policies and foreign relations. Roosevelt was elected president in his own right in November, at which time he vowed not to run again in 1908 (a pledge he later regretted). The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) dominated T. R.’s attention in international affairs, and he mediated an end to the conflict with the Treaty of Portsmouth in early September 1905 (for which he would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906).\n\nHelpful Links\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Papers, Library of Congress\n\nSearch Theodore Roosevelt Papers with transcriptions\n\nIndex to the Theodore Roosevelt Papers\n\nTimeline\n\nCurator blog post about TR\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Center\n\nText order\n\nTranscribe text in the order it appears on the page. If you're unsure, transcribe the text how it would make sense to read aloud.\n\nPreserve original spelling, grammar, and punctuation\n\nTranscribe original text spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Type what you see. Do not paraphrase.\n\nIf a misspelling will impact search of the document, you can tag the page with the correct spelling. Example: \"Abe Linkin\" - Transcribe as spelled and tag with \"Abraham Lincoln\"\n\nLine breaks\n\nPreserve line breaks. Line breaks make it easier for someone to review your transcription. Sometimes text in the transcription box spills over two lines in the transcription box. If you don't hit enter, no line break is recorded.\n\nWhen words are broken over two lines on the same page, type the word on the first line. Example: Write library rather than li-brary.\n\nPage breaks\n\nIf a word breaks across two pages, transcribe it on the first page.\n\nIllegible or unclear text\n\nIf you can't decipher a word or phrase, that’s ok! Another volunteer may be able to. If you are unable to read a lot of a page, save and looking for another.\n\nYou may not be able to read some text due to damage, cross-outs, blurred ink, or bad handwriting! In place of illegible words or letters, transcribe a pair of square brackets around a question mark [?]. If you can read any part of a word, transcribe what letters you can and use question marks for the rest. Example: [?] score and s[????] years ago\n\nBlank pages - Nothing to transcribe\n\nDo not transcribe any text for blank pages. Check the Nothing to Transcribe box below it and hit \"Save.\"\n\nDeletions\n\nIf you can read text that has been crossed out or otherwise deleted, transcribe the deleted words within square brackets [ ].\n\nInserted text\n\nWhen text has been inserted over a line or otherwise added later, transcribe it in the original text in the order you would read it. Do not use caret symbols or brackets to indicate text has been inserted.\n\nMultiple pages\n\nIf there is more than one page in an image, transcribe all pages in the order they appear, one after the other. Leave empty lines between pages.\n\nDon't leave notes in text\n\nOnly type original text from the page into the transcription box. You may be tempted to leave notes about the document, but please don't! You can leave help or context for others as a tag or post in our discussion forum on History Hub.\n\nExpanding abbreviations\n\nDo not expand abbreviations; just type what you see. You can use tags to record the expanded text of an important abbreviation that otherwise does not appear in the text. Example: Transcribe \"UL\" and tag \"Urban League\"\n\nFormatting text: Bold, underlined, italic, indented, etc.\n\nDo not try to capture formatting, such as underlining or indents or note it in the text. Preserving text style or format does not enhance the discoverability or accessibility of a page and may not display as desired in published transcriptions.\n\nPrinted or typed text\n\nSome material in By the People is typed or printed, including letters and memos, newspaper clippings, printed forms, and more. This text still needs to be transcribed as it is not yet machine-readable. \"Transcribe with OCR\" may be a useful though imperfect starting point.\n\nCatalog and page numbers\n\nDo transcribe page and catalog numbers and letters.\n\nLetterheads\n\nTranscribe letterhead text; it often includes names and addresses researchers may find useful.\n\nNewspapers\n\nTranscribe all newspapers articles, not just those you think relevant. Transcribe columns in the order you would read them. Don't try to preserve layout.\n\nWhen not to transcribe print\n\nSome mass-produced diaries contain many pages of pre-printed calendars, almanacs, dates, and other text that does not need to be transcribed. This text does not broadly aid discovery and access to historical information. We recommend clicking \"Nothing to transcribe\" and moving on.\n\nImages\n\nIgnore images. Don't describe or note them in the transcription box. If a page has only images and no text, click \"Nothing to transcribe.\" You can use tags to capture information about images, watermarks, stamps, or any other non-text features.\n\nText in margins\n\nMarginalia is text written around the main text block. It is often a comment on the main body text, but can be unrelated. It differs from an insertion, in that it was not intended to be woven into the main text.\n\nTranscribe marginalia within square brackets and asterisks [* *]. If it comments on a specific portion of the text, order it after that text. Put it at the end of the transcription if it appears unrelated. Transcribe all original punctuation within the [* *], including parentheses. Example: We are met on a great battlefield of that war. [*Refers to Gettysburg*]\n\nNon-English languages, characters, and translation\n\nMany languages are found in our campaigns. All text should be transcribed wholly and accurately in the original language.\n\nUse the correct characters when transcribing non-English text. For example, do not substitute C for Ç. You can use alt codes to enter non-English characters. See our Spanish and Latin cheat sheets.\n\nDo not enter translation! If you want to translate a document, you can share it in History Hub!\n\nShorthand\n\nDo not transcribe shorthand. Some of our campaigns include shorthand text, a note-taking method popular in the early 20th century that substituted symbols for words and phrases to quickly capture text (here's an example).\n\nMany forms of shorthand exist and shorthand transcription can be closer to translation. When you recognize shorthand, just insert [[shorthand]]. You can also add the tag \"shorthand.\"\n\nOther symbols and special characters\n\nTranscribe symbols and other special characters as they are used in the original. Most common are ampersands (&), currency ($, £, etc.), and the silcrow (§, used in legal documents). Here's more help for early American and British Colonial currency.\n\nBleed-through\n\nText written or printed on thin paper, like letterbooks, will often have bleed-through. Ink from the proceeding page seeps through the paper or is visible through it and appears to be written backward. Ignore backward mirror image text. You can go to the previous page to transcribe it.\n\nLong s or \"funny\" f\n\nSome historical handwriting and printing uses the \"long s\", which looks like a lowercase \"f\". Transcribe this as a lowercase \"s\".\n\nTables\n\nSome documents contain tables of data, such as accounting records or statistical information. Transcribe these in a way that will preserve the relationships between columns and rows, and reflect the meaning of the original documents. Don't worry about replicating layout, just try to capture the data and make your transcription relatively easy for a reviewer to check. You can use spaces and hard returns, but please do not add characters such as the pipe symbol or slashes to divide the data.\n\nCross-writing\n\nSome letters include \"cross-writing\" where the author layered text in two directions to save on paper or postage. Transcribe a cross-written page in the order you would read it. You can also add the tag \"cross-writing.\"\n\nVolunteer peer review is the final vital step. Once a page is accepted by a reviewer, it is complete. Completed pages are published on loc.gov to enhance search and accessibility. Review is also great way to become familiar with reading handwriting and our transcription rules.\n\nHow to review\n\nRead the entire transcription and carefully compare it to the document image, checking for accuracy and completeness. We recommend going line-by-line, which is why we ask transcribers to preserve line breaks. Make sure the transcriber followed all transcription rules.\n\nRegister to review\n\nAnyone can review; you just need to register. An account also allows you to track your contribution on your profile page and to tag documents.\n\nAccepting a transcription\n\nIf a transcription is whole and accurate and you do not need to make any changes, click \"Accept\". The page is now complete! You can no longer edit, but the page is still available to read and tag. If you think a completed page in an active campaign can be improved, contact us to reopen it.\n\nEditing a transcription\n\nIf you find errors or missing text click “Edit”. You can make changes to the text yourself or leave it \"In Progress\" for another volunteer. Correct any mistakes made by the transcriber and complete any words you can. Just like transcribing, click “Save” as you go and \"Submit\" when you're done. Another volunteer will need to review the page again.\n\nShould I add line breaks?\n\nLine breaks aid reviewers and other readers in comparing the transcription to the lines of text in the image. They allow you to read across the transcription and image line-by-line. However, if the absence of line breaks is the only issue in a transcription, and you can review it as-is, you do not need to add them.\n\nCan I review my own transcriptions?\n\nYou cannot review transcriptions you submit unless someone else edits the page and re-submits it."
