        "text": "The Sanders German Military Advisory Mission was designed and called upon to revitalize a defeated army in the Balkan Wars and to route out its partisan politics. However, the diplomatic crisis which started upon the mission's arrival in Istanbul, the outbreak of the First World War seven months later, and the Ottoman Empire's decision to join the war on the German side after a difficult period of neutrality obliged the mission to face unexpected crises and situations to assume duties other than those originally contemplated. The increase of German personnel, which had started before the war, turned into a veritable avalanche after the war broke out, and thousands of German soldiers, most of whom were independent of the mission command, pursued different objectives. Against this anarchic atmosphere and despite infighting with Ottoman officers, the Sanders Mission played an important role in modernizing the Ottoman Army and rendering it more effective. Through German support and training, Ottoman officers and soldiers accumulated the knowledge and experience that they otherwise would have gained only through a much longer and more arduous process.\n\nThis is a comprehensive new operational military history of the Ottoman Army during the First World War. Drawing from archives, official military histories, personal war narratives and sizeable Turkish secondary literature, it tells the incredible story of the Ottoman Army’s struggle from the mountains of the Caucasus to the deserts of Arabia and the bloody shores of Gallipoli. The Ottoman Army, by opening new fronts, diverted and kept sizeable units of British, Russian and French forces away from the main theatres and even sent reinforcements to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria. Against all odds, the Ottoman Army ultimately achieved some striking successes, not only on the battlefield but in their total mobilization of the empire’s meagre human and economic resources. However, even by the standards of the First World War, these achievements came at a terrible price in casualties and, ultimately, loss of territory. Thus, instead of improving the integrity and security of the empire, the war effectively dismantled it and created situations and problems hitherto undreamt of by a besieged Ottoman leadership. In a unique account, Uyar revises our understanding of the war in the Middle East.\n\nOn October 30, 1918, the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros with the Allies and withdrew from the First World War. By the 5th article of the armistice, they started to demobilize their armies. When the armistice was signed, the 6th Army and 5th Division which was attached to it, were in Mosul. According to the armistice, the 6th Army was abolished. The 13th Corps, which was directly subordinate to the Ministry of War, was established in the region. The 5th Division was also attached to this corps and The division was tasked with maintaining security in and around Mardin. With the occupation of Urfa on March 24 on the Southern Front, the 5th Division joined the Urfa Defense. After Urfa's independence on April 11, 1920, the 5th division joined the Antep Defense on November 3, 1920. The division had dealt blows to the French with successful battles there. However, since the siege circle could not be broken, the people of Antep, who could not find a cure for hunger, had to surrender to the French on February 8, 1921. When the French began peace talks with the Ankara Government on the Southern Front during the National Struggle, the Greeks advanced to the east of the Sakarya River on the Western Front. Therefore, this advance revealed the necessity of strengthening the Western Front. In this context, the 5th Division was sent to the Western Front in July 26, 1921 to participate in the Battle of Sakarya, depending on the 2nd Corps established on November 9, 1920, in the Southern Front. In this study, the activities of the 5th Division, which participated in the Battle of Sakarya on the Western Front from the Antep Defense, will be discussed. The main sources of the study are the documents obtained from the of the Archives and Military History Department of MND and the studies on the subject in the literature. Identified documents and information; The study would be presented by analyzing with qualitative, quantitative, and comparative methods.\n\nThe Ottoman army and its officer corps were wholly unprepared for modern warfare in 1853. The opening battles exposed structural problems, but they also overshadowed the major changes which were underway. Academically trained officers without any aristocratic and political connections were gaining power and prestige albeit slowly. The influx of Hungarian and Polish emigrant officers revitalized the military reforms thereby empowered the Military Academy graduates. Education, training and battlefield performance rather than status and household politics came to determine commission and promotion. One of the major lessons of the Crimean War was the realization of the future of the empire and army depended on the quality of the officer corps, and that quality, in turn, was a direct result of the selection and educational processes. Unfortunately for the empire both the military reforms and new generation of academy graduates needed time and resources which the empire did not have.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Ottomans undertook a pan-Islamism propaganda campaign through the newspaper al-Sharq (published by Djemal Pasha in Damascus) to motivate its Arab subjects to support the Ottoman struggle against the Entente powers. To this end, many articles and news items appeared in al-Sharq to inspire Muslim unity around the figure of the caliph. Unity was presented as a crucial part of saving Muslims; disasters were predicted should the Ottoman Empire fall to the 'infidels'. Sharif Husayn and his followers were explicitly or implicitly accused of splitting the umma and rendering the Hijaz and the remainder of independent Muslim territories vulnerable to British and other European imperialists. In 1916, Sharif Husayn launched a revolt in Mecca against the Ottoman Caliph and established a periodical, al-Qibla, to target the same audience. In al-Qibla, Husayn presented the Committee of Union and Progress as amoral and irreligious usurpers of the caliph's authority, and therefore undeserving of allegiance. In this article I analyse the discourse of the two competing sides by examining their propaganda on issues such as loyalty to the caliph, the unity of the Muslims and the formation of alliances with the Great Powers. I argue that Islam shaped the propaganda battle between the Ottomans and the sharif to a greater extent than did Arabism or Turkism."
