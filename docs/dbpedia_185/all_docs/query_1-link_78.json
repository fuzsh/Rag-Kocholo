        "text": "This study aims to expose the ways in which leading officials of the Committee of Union and Progress (the CUP) interpreted, internalized, and questioned the conditions of their mission in Arab lands during World War I (WWI). It builds on the memoirs of Falih Rıfkı, aide-de-camp of Commander-in-Chief Cemal Pasha, and Halide Edip, an ardent supporter of the social and educational reforms of the CUP government. Both written after the war, these memoirs reflect not only nostalgia and regret but also the complicated relationship between Turkish officials and Arabs on the eve of their breakup from one another as citizens of the Ottoman State. The study also questions the orthodox argument that the Turkist and anti-Arabic ideology of the CUP government in general and Cemal Pasha's wartime crusade against Arab nationalists in particular triggered the emergence of Arab nationalism. By contemplating the memoirs of CUP members in Arab lands, this study argues that Falih Rıfkı, Cemal Pasha, and Halide Edip tried to understand the region and its people in order to create a mutual future for Turks and Arabs within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThis is a comprehensive new operational military history of the Ottoman Army during the First World War. Drawing from archives, official military histories, personal war narratives and sizeable Turkish secondary literature, it tells the incredible story of the Ottoman Army's struggle from the mountains of the Caucasus to the deserts of Arabia and the bloody shores of Gallipoli. The Ottoman Army, by opening new fronts, diverted and kept sizeable units of British, Russian and French forces away from the main theatres and even sent reinforcements to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria. Against all odds, the Ottoman Army ultimately achieved some striking successes, not only on the battlefield but in their total mobilisation of the empire's meagre human and economic resources. However, even by the standards of the First World War, these achievements came at a terrible price in casualties and, ultimately, loss of territory. Thus, instead of improving the integrity and security of the empire, the war effectively dismantled it and created situations and problems hitherto undreamt of by a besieged Ottoman leadership. In a unique account, Uyar revises our understanding of the war in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1826, the Ottoman central authority, which had destroyed the Janissary Corps and had been facing an array of political and military challenges from both inside and outside for years, decided to create a European-style army manned by long-term conscripts. To meet the mounting manpower needs, the Ottoman state forcibly drafted Muslim peasants and the urban poor for its newly formed regiments. This essay focuses on these men, the rank and file of the Ottoman army in the second quarter of the 19th century, a social group that scholars often disregard as a topic of historical investigation. The article examines the conscripts’ social background, as well as the responses of both the general public and the serving soldiers to military service. The essay will also analyze how religion, ethno-cultural identity, social status, and the actual experience of military service shaped the state’s recruitment policies and the subjects’ attitudes toward conscription in an era before modern sentiments of nationhood took root among the Muslim peoples of the empire. Key Words: Conscription, Obligatory Military Service, Mahmud II, Tanzimat, Reform in the Ottoman Empire Özet 1826 yılında Yeniçeri Ocağı’nı ortadan kaldıran ve yıllardan beri içerden ve dışardan siyasi ve askerî olarak otoritesi sürekli tehdit edilen Osmanlı merkezî hükümeti, çareyi uzun yıllar boyunca silah altında tutulmak üzere toplanmış “başıbağlu” neferlerden oluşan Avrupa tipi bir ordu kurmakta bulmuştu. Osmanlı devleti, yeni kurduğu alayların artan asker ihtiyacını karşılamak üzere Müslüman köylüleri ve alt tabakadan gelen şehirlileri zorla askere aldı. Bu makale tarih araştırmaları bağlamında yeterince çalışılmamış bu askerlerin hikayelerine odaklanmaktadır. Çalışmada halkın ve askere alınanların zorunlu askerliğe karşı verdikleri tepkiler ve askere alınanların toplumsal arkaplanları incelenmektedir. Makalede aynı zamanda dinin, etno-kültürel kimliklerin, sosyal statünün ve askerlik tecrübesinin Osmanlı devletinin askere alma siyasetini ve halkın askerliğe dair düşüncelerini nasıl etkilediği, milliyetçilik hislerinin Müslüman Osmanlı tebaası arasında yayılmasından önceye tekabül eden bu dönemde tahlil edilecektir. Anahtar Kelimeler: Askere Alma, Zorunlu Askerlik, II. Mahmud, Tanzimat, Osmanlı İmparatorluğu’nda Reform\n\nThis article surveys Ottoman reserve officers' autobiographical texts and emphasizes the potential these personal narratives present to revise both the existing historiography on the Ottoman First World War and the official memory of the war in Turkey. After briefly exploring the evolution of the Ottoman reserve officer system as an integrated part of Ottoman conscription, the article shows how reserve officers' war memories shed light on the neglected aspects of Ottoman soldiers' experience of the front, particularly the daily life of trench warfare. Reserve officers' personal narratives include critical observations and remarks about the Ottoman war experience, and the article discusses how these critical memories may be significant for the revision of the official narrative of the war in Turkey. Yet it also argues that as these personal narratives are diverse, they do not present an all-embracing counter-narrative of disillusionment. The article also draws attention to the shaping effect of the context in which these autobiographies were written down and explores the organic ties between personal and collective memories of the Great War in Turkey.\n\nThe paper attempts to trace the Arab sense of national belonging to the Ottoman state in the immediate prelude to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. It analyzes Arab popular sentiment toward the Ottoman state, specifically toward the Committee of Union and Progress (İttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti, CUP or Unionists) during the period between 1909 and 1914. In doing so, it seeks to deconstruct the post-Ottoman, Arab, nationalist, meta-historical narrative that commonly links the development of Arab proto-nationalism during the CUP period (1908–1918) with the creation of Arab nation states in the post-Ottoman period, in which the Arab (Sharifian) revolt of 1916 is often presented as the main event that gave way to that transition.\n\nThe first half of the “long” nineteenth century witnessed severe changes and reforms in the Ottoman Army structure as a response to the ever-growing threat of external pressures as well as internal upheavals. Having seen the inadequacy of the out-of-date Janissary forces and unreliability of Ayans’ soldiers together with troublesome mercenaries, Ottoman reformers decided to set up a new army along European lines whose bulk was to be composed of Anatolian Muslim population called “Turkish Lads”. Establishing such new corps and providing the adequate number of men, equipment, and training proved costly and difficult for the Ottomans which opened a whole new area of struggle and resistance between different agents within the Empire whose story constitutes the subject of this work. From the elimination of the Janissary forces in 1826 ,called “the Auspicious Occasion”, to the Nizib Defeat (1839), this paper shall first examine the elimination of the old military order and then move on to the establishment of “the Asakir-i Mansure Army” together with financial, political and social difficulties the state ran into in the process of establishing the new army as well as resistance showed by different parts of the Ottoman society against such a bold endeavor undertaken by the central administration in İstanbul.\n\nWith the reinstatement of the parliament in 1908, the Ottoman state faced new challenges connected to citizenship. As a policy to finally make citizens equal in rights as well as duties, military conscription figured prominently in this new context. For the first time in Ottoman history, the empire's non-Muslims began to be drafted en masse. This article explores meanings of imperial citizenship and equality through the lens of debates over the conscription of Greek Ottomans, the largest non-Muslim population of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to the widespread suggestion of the Turkish nationalist historiography on these matters, Greek Ottomans and other non-Muslim populations enthusiastically supported the military service in principle. But amidst this general agreement was a tremendous array of views on what conscription ought to look like in practice. The issue came to center on whether Greek Ottomans should have separate battalions in the army. All units would eventually come to be religiously integrated, but the conscription debates in the Ottoman parliament as well as in the Turkish and Greek language press reveal some of the crucial fissures of an empire as various actors were attempting to navigate between a unified citizenship and a diverse population."
