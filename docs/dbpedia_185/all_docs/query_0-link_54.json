        "text": "(Includes Introduction authored by Blumi and Yavuz to the larger volume) War and Nationalism presents thorough up-to-date scholarship on the often misunderstood and neglected Balkan Wars of 1912 to 1913, which contributed to the outbreak of World War I. The wars represented a pivotal moment that had a long-lasting impact on the regional state system and fundamentally transformed the beleaguered Ottoman Empire in the process. This chapter invariably also suffers from this methodological weakness in that it too mobilizes a narrow selection of events (at the expense of excluding others) in order to suggest possible interpretations of so-called origins and enduring legacies of the 1912–13 Balkan Wars. A major impediment to analyzing the disparate events identified as contributing to the Balkan Wars’ long-term consequences is in some part the result of focusing on specific administrative zones — the mountainous borderlands of Kosova, İşkodra, Serbia, and Montenegro known here as the Malësi e Madhe — without fully engaging seemingly peripheral events beyond these locales.\n\n(with special thanks to Yiğit Akın and Mehmet Beşikçi) This seminar explores the tumultuous and devastating years of military mobilization, war, diplomacy, and nation-building that created the modern Middle East and Balkans as we know them today. It will investigate the political, social, and military history of the period in a wholistic manner, by looking into institutional reform, debates of constitutionalism, and rising nationalisms throughout the 19th and early 20th century Ottoman Empire. We will scrutinize the Ottomans’ road to war through studying the rebellions in Albania and Yemen (1910-12), the Italian invasion of Ottoman North Africa (1911-12), the Balkan Wars (1912-13), and the definitive establishment of the Committee of Union and Progress’ dominance in the empire. We will concentrate on the important aspects of the First World War as fought by the Ottomans, not only the military campaigns, but the declaration of Jihad (Holy War), wartime propaganda, home front, forced deportations, and state-sponsored population engineering projects. Finally, we will try to understand the impact of the war on societies and political entities which were drastically reshaped by the direct results and long-term legacies of the conflict. The class aims to familiarize the students with the fundamental chronology, events, and individuals in the Ottoman and post-Ottoman World during this period. Another goal is to introduce students to the basic historiography and major historical debates regarding the Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the experiences of the civilians as well as the members of the armed forces. Finally, students will learn how the war is remembered in the post-Ottoman world and how the perception of the conflict created competing national narratives and national identities.\n\nOttoman domination of southeastern Europe, often referred to as the Balkans, began in the fourteenth century. Initial Ottoman rule provided relative peace and stability for the region for the next three centuries. This was the pax ottomanica, or the Ottoman Peace. The long Ottoman decline began after the Ottoman defeat outside the city of Vienna in 1683. Throughout the eighteenth century, Ottoman control of southeastern Europe receded. This permitted the intrusion of Enlightenment ideas from Western Europe at the end of the eighteenth century. The concept of nationalism, imported from Western Europe, in particular caused desires for political change throughout the Balkans. Its influence would provide the main basis for conflict in southeastern Europe, lasting throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. At first the self identified nationalities of the Balkans, first the Serbs, then the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, and finally the Albanians all sought to obtain national states, mainly at the expense of Ottoman rule."
