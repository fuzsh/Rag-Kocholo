In addition to Padışah, each ruler used an immense variety of additional titles, varying from one use to another. Although some sources claim this variety to have formed the 'official style' of the Ottoman rulers, the styles actually used in official documents tend to be more concise.In addition to Padışah, each ruler used a variety of additional titles, varying from one use to another couched in elaborate formula, made up of a mixture of Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkishprobably left to each secretary to elaborate as the occasiondemanded. An instrument issued under the authority of Süleyman-şah bin Selim-şah Hânwhich reads in translation as:\n\n\"The Sultan of Sultans, the proof of Emperors, the distributor of crowns to the monarchs of the surface of the earth, the shadow of God on the lands, the Sultan and the Padışah of the White Sea, the Black Sea, Rumelia, Anatolia, Karaman, of Rum, of the provinces of the Zulkadırs, of Diyarbakır, of Kurdistan, of Azerbaycan, of Acem [Persia], of Şam [Damascus], of Halep [Aleppo], of Mısır [Egypt], of Mecca and Medina, of Jerusalem, of all the lands of Arabia, of the Yemen, and of the many lands conquered by the irresistible power of my noble fathers and illustrious ancestors - may God illuminate their manifestations -, and of the many lands which my glorious and august majesty has conquered with a flaming sword.\"\n\nA document addressed to the Venetian state in 1641 from İbrahim I found in Theunissen (1998, p. 626) and recorded as:\"sultan-i selatin-i cihan ve bürhan-i havakin-i devran tacbahş-i husrevan-i ru-i zemin sultan İbrahim han ibn Ahmed han ibn Mehemmed han ibn Murad han ibn Selim han ibn Süleyman han ibn Selim hanın.\"\n\nThe Office of Halife (Caliph): The claim that, upon the conquest of Egypt in 1517 and the displacement of the last Abbasid holder of the office, al-Mutawakkil III, the office and style of Khalifat Rasul Allah, Amir al-Mu'minin (Halife-i Resulullah, Emirülmüminin)(\"Successor to the Messenger of God, Commander of the Faithful\") was transferred to the Ottoman ruler by a formal deed of assignment has no corroboration from any contemporary source. A variety of \"khalifal\" titles was used by Ottoman rulers, and accorded to them by others in diplomatic correspondence and treaties. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (21 July 1774 N.S.) between the Ottoman and the Russian Empires for the first time ceded territory held to be under Ottoman rule; in it the Ottoman side consequently forcefully asserted the remaining authority of the Ottoman ruler in his capacity as halife (khalifa) over all Muslims in the ceded territories. The assertion of khalifal status and authority became from that moment a significant component of the political understanding of the nature and attributes of the office of Padışah.The status of the Padışah as halife was given formal sanction in the Ottoman Constitution of 23 Nov 1876 (rescinded 13 Feb 1878, restored 24 Jul 1908). Upon the extinction of the Ottoman Empire by the Turkish Grand National Assembly on 1 Nov 1922, the ruler, Mehmed VI (s.a.), continued to be recognized as halife; after his flight from Istanbul on 17 Nov 1922, he was declared deposed from the office of halife by a fetva, endorsed by the Şeyhülislam (Sheikh al-Islam) and ratified by the Grand National Assembly on 19 Nov 1922, and replaced on that date by Abdülmecid bin Abdülâziz Hân, who was installed on 24 Nov 1922. The office of halife was abolished by the Grand National Assembly on 3 Mar 1924.\n\nOttoman titles: Agha (Ağa) = General officer; Bey/Beg = Chieftain; Beylerbey = Governor-general; Beyzade = Son of a Bey; Bostanji/Bostandji (Bostancı) = Palace guard; Chelebi (Çelebi) = Gentleman; Chavush (Çavuş) = Usher/messenger; Damat (Damad) = (\"bridegroom\") Prince Consort; Defterdar = Treasurer; Deli = Calvary captain; Effendi (Efendi) = Master (or Lord); Emin = Intendant; Emir = Commander; Ghazi (Gazi) = Warrior; Gonnullu (Gönüllü) = Military Veteran; Haji (Hacı) = Pilgrim to Mecca; Hoja (Hoca) = Adviser; Kanuni = Legislator; Kapudan Pasha (Kaptan Paşa) = Admiral; Kazi (Kadı) = Judge; Kethüda/kehya = Lieutenant; Khan (Hân) = Sovereign; Lala = Tutor; Mirza = Prince; Mutasarrıf = Administrator; Nishanji (Nişancı) = Chancellor; Padishah (Padişah) = Emperor; Pasha (Paşa) = Sir/Lord; Pashazade (Paşazade) = Son of a Pasha; Reis (Rais) = Naval Captain; Sardar (Sidar, Serdar) = Headmaster; Shehzade Sultan (Şehzade Sultan) = Sultan Imperial Prince; Silahdar = Master-General/Arm-Bearer; Sultanzade = Son of a Sultan; Wali (Vali) = Viceroy; Yaya = Fief holder.\n\nTerritorial Disputes: Complex maritime, air, and territorial disputes with Greece in the Aegean Sea; status of North Cyprus question remains; Syria and Iraq protest Turkish hydrological projects to control upper Euphrates waters; Turkey has expressed concern over the status of Kurds in Iraq; Syria did not surrender its irredentist claim to Hatay until 2005; in 2009, Swiss mediators facilitated an accord re-establishing diplomatic ties between Armenia and Turkey, but neither side has ratified the agreement and the rapprochement effort has faltered; Tomb of Suleyman Shah (Turkish: Süleyman Şah Türbesi) is a sovereign exclave of Turkey situated within Syria's Aleppo governorate in accordance with the Ankara Agreement of 20 Oct 1921 (it is the burial place of Süleyman Shah grandfather of Osman I the founder of the Ottoman Empire); Turkish authorities have complained that blasting from quarries in Armenia might be damaging the medieval ruins of Ani, on the other side of the Arpacay valley; dispute with Syria concerning the Turkish occupation of parts of North Syria since Aug 2016.\n\nParty abbreviations:AKP = Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (Justice and Development Party, populist, social conservative, nationalist, neo-Ottomanist, est.14 Aug 2001); AnaP = Anavatan Partisi (Motherland Party, liberal conservative, nationalist, 20 May 1983-31 Oct 2009, re-est.11 Sep 2011); CHP = Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (Republican People's Party, social-democratic, Kemalist, 9 Sep 1923-16 Oct 1981, re-est.9 Sep 1992); DSP = Demokratik Sol Parti (Democratic Left Party, social-democratic, Kemalist, est.14 Nov 1985); Mil = Military;- Former parties:AP = Adalet Partisi (Justice Party, conservative, former DP, 11 Feb 1961 - 16 Oct 1981); CGP = Cumhuriyetçi Güven Partisi (Republican Reliance Party, to 4 May 1973 called Nationalistic Reliance Party, split from CHP, 12 May 1967-16 Oct 1981); CUP = İttihad ve Terakki Fırkası/Birlik ve İlerleme Partisi (Committee of Union and Progress, \"Young Turks\", constitutional monarchist, nationalist, 1913-18 only legal party, 1889-1918); DP = Demokrat Partisi (Democratic Party, liberal conservative, 7 Jan 1946 - 29 Sep 1960); DYP = Doğru Yol Partisi (True Path Party, liberal conservative, former AP, renamed Demokrat Parti in 2007, merged into AnAP, 23 Jun 1983-27 May 2007); RP = Refah Partisi (Welfare Party, Islamic conservative, 19 Jul 1983-16 Jan 1998); SHP = Sosyaldemokrat Halkçı Parti (Social Democratic People's Party, reformist, populist, nationalist, merger of Social Democracy Party and People's Party, 3 Nov 1985-18 Feb 1995, merged with CHP) Antalya (Adalia)\n\n28 Mar 1919 Italians occupy Antalya (Adalia), Kaş, Silifke, and on 23 Jul 1919 Muğla (and Fethiye, Bodrum, and Marmaris on 11 May 1919).
