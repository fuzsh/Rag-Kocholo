        "text": "Cornelius O’Brien was quite a wealthy man. As a landlord he owned approximately 10,000 acres of land. He lived in Birchfield House near the Cliffs of Moher, built before 1816. Throughout his life he fostered a great appreciation of the Cliffs of Moher and saw great potential for tourism in the area. In 1835 he built O’Brien’s Tower to accommodate visitors who could then get enhanced views of the Cliffs. It is said that he would bring guests to the tower for entertainment. O’Brien’s Tower is technically termed a folly. Along with the tower, he built a holding wall, pathways, a stone picnic table on the cliff edge, and a stable complex to accommodate visitors. Liscannor flagstone was central to his building initiatives.\n\nO’Brien was known to be a benevolent landlord who provided financial assistance to tenants to improve their farms. O’Brien wished to enhance the educational prospects of the locality and built a school in 1845. He was a visionary, with a view to alleviating and improving people’s journeys through the area. He facilitated the building of O’Brien’s Bridge between Lahinch and Liscannor. During such difficult famine-stricken times, he aspired to enhance and embrace the value of community by developing Gothic styled Refreshers Wells, and the rustic seating area and well house at St. Brigid’s Well. O’Brien is considered the forefather of tourism at the Cliffs of Moher, enabling the surrounding area to thrive. He died in 1857 and was laid to rest in a family mausoleum behind St. Brigid’s Well. A column was erected (1858-9) by public subscription in memory of Cornelius O’Brien."
