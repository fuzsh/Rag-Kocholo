        "text": "biography\n\nBorn in San Francisco on April 19, 1899 (some sources list 1900 as his date of birth), George O'Brien was the son of Daniel O'Brien, San Francisco's Chief of Police. O'Brien attended Santa Clara College but enlisted in the Navy near the end of World War I, and quickly became a heavyweight boxing champion of the Pacific Fleet. After the end of the war, O'Brien returned to college but soon made his way to Hollywood. Starting in 1920, O'Brien worked as a stuntman and production assistant for Famous Players-Lasky. Gradually, he also took on bit parts in films, before catching the eye of director John Ford, who chose the relatively unknown O'Brien to star in Ford's 1924 silent epic The Iron Horse. Ford was impressed by the natural acting ability of his new star and convinced Fox executives to put him under contract. Throughout the latter days of silent films, O'Brien had great success as a leading man and starred in some of the best films of the era. Standing 5'11\", he was nicknamed \"The Chest\" in the 1920s for his strong, muscular build.\n\nLEFT: O'Brien with Johnny Weissmuller in the early 1930s. CENTER A: 1920s pose. CENTER B and C: 1930s poses. CENTER D and RIGHT: Daring Fox studio shots to promote O'Brien's 1926 comedy Fig Leaves\n\nBy 1928, elements of sound were being grafted onto movies originally filmed as silents, in a rush to get on the \"talkie\" bandwagon. O'Brien's first all-sound film was Salute (1929), which was not a great success upon release. Not knowing what to do with the popular actor, Fox executives eventually cast O'Brien in a series of lower-budget westerns. O'Brien's early westerns were highly successful for the studio, and O'Brien became perhaps the most popular western star at that time. In 1936, he left 20th Century-Fox for an offer from RKO, where he made 20 pictures at the studio in four years.\n\nIn 1933, O'Brien married actresss Marguerite Churchill, the star of Dracula's Daughter (1936; with Gloria Holden). The couple met when they were both cast in the 1931 western Riders of the Purple Sage. They had two children--bassist Orin O'Brien and writer Darcy O'Brien--before divorcing in 1948.\n\nthe films of george o'brien\n\nThe Iron Horse (1924)\n\nDirector John Ford gave George O'Brien his first starring role in the western The Iron Horse. This film originally had a running time of 150 minutes, very long for a 1920s western\n\nThe Silver Treasure (1926)\n\nO'Brien as Nostromo in The Silver Treasure\n\nIs Zat So? (1927)\n\nO'Brien as boxer Chick Cowan in Is Zat So?\n\nSunrise (1927)\n\nScene from Sunrise with Janet Gaynor. O'Brien portrays a young farmer who contemplates murdering his wife (Gaynor) at the urging of another woman. O'Brien was teamed with Gaynor in two other films: The Blue Eagle (1926) and The Johnstown Flood (1926)\n\nBlindfold (1928)\n\nWith Lois Moran in Blindfold\n\nNoah's Ark (1928)\n\nLEFT: As Japheth in Michael Curtiz's Warner Bros. epic Noah's Ark. RIGHT: With co-star Dolores Costello. With a budget in excess of a million dollars, this was one of the most expensive films ever made, until the 1930s. Originally shot as a silent film, some sound sequences were inserted before its release\n\nSeas Beneath (1931)\n\nWith Marion Lessing the John Ford war film Seas Beneath\n\nThe Dude Ranger (1934)\n\nScene from Fox's short western The Dude Ranger\n\nHard Rock Harrigan (1935)\n\nAs the title character in the Fox Film Corporation drama Hard Rock Harrigan\n\nThunder Mountain (1935)\n\nFrom Thunder Mountain\n\nThe Border Patrolman (1936)\n\nAs Bob Wallace in The Border Patrolman, O'Brien has to keep Polly Ann Young in check\n\nDaniel Boone (1936)\n\nFrom O'Brien's most popular western, the RKO release Daniel Boone\n\nPark Avenue Logger (1937)\n\nFrom RKO's Park Avenue Logger\n\nThe Renegade Ranger (1938)\n\nFrom the RKO western The Renegade Ranger with Ray Whitley, Tim Holt, and Rita Hayworth\n\nMy Wild Irish Rose (1947)\n\nO'Brien had a supporting role in the Warner Bros. musical My Wild Irish Rose. Also pictured are Arlene Dahl, Alan Hale, Sara Allgood, and George Tobias\n\nGold Raiders (1951)\n\nFrom the Three Stooges comedy Gold Raiders with Fuzzy Knight, Monte Blue, and Hugh Hooker\n\nlater years\n\nWith the onset of World War II, at the age of 41 O'Brien decided to leave his acting career behind and re-enlist in the Navy. Returning to films after the war, however, roles for George O'Brien had evaporated. He made a few more films between 1947 and 1951, and even became a panelist on the TV series Pantomime Quiz. With the onset of the Korean War, O'Brien again returned to active duty. He acted in only one more film, the John Ford western Cheyenne Autumn (1964; with Richard Widmark, Carroll Baker, Ricardo Montalban, and Gilbert Roland), retiring to a ranch in Oklahoma afterward. Following a stroke and several years of poor health, O'Brien passed away on September 4, 1985, at the age of 86. He was survived by his son, writer Darcy O'Brien (1939-1998), and his daughter, bassist Orin O'Brien."
