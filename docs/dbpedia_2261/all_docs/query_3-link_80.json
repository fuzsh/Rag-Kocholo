        "text": "The finale of the trip was launched on Saturday afternoon at Considine’s Bar at St. Brigid’s well in Liscannor. The higher power was definitely looking over us as we were blessed with perfect weather, which is a rare feat in northwest County Clare. For a few hours Considines from around the world chatted and mingled with each other. Many had shared their families trees as well as old pictures of our ancestors.\n\nAt around 7pm Maureen Considine, the main organizer of our Gathering, gave an introductory speech to the nights festivities. Maureen shared some interesting stories and read aloud messages from Considines abroad who were unable to attend our family gathering. Many thanks to Maureen for planning the event. It would not have succeeded without her.\n\nI had been lined up to give a short talk on the history of the Considines. I started way back in the 4th century with Emperor Constantine of the Byzantine Empire. The surname Considine literally means “Son of Constantine.” Emperor Constantine put the name on the map as he was the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity and to give religious freedom not only for Christians, but all non-pagans. The name Constantine itself, however, dates back a few centuries earlier. That requires another blog post.\n\nFollowing the information on Emperor Constantine, I moved to the Irish 3rd century, where the Dalcassian tribe once roamed in pre-Christian times. The Dalcassians was one of the major ethnic groups of the time. The founder of the tribe, Cormac Cas, had a brother named Egan, who eventually formed the Eoganchata tribe, which the Dalcassians fought with for centuries.\n\nThe reason I chose to discuss the Dalcassians is because the O’Briens were one of the septs (smaller clans) within the larger Dalcassian population. From the O’Brien family came Constantine O’Brien, the first Considine ever and the Bishop of Killaloe, which was discussed in an earlier post.\n\nThe talk moved to a brief discussion of Brian Boru, the former high king of Ireland and the most famous O’Brien ever. His 6th generation descendant was Constantine O’Brien, thus every Considine in the world is linked to Brian Boru. I told the audience that in theory, every single Considine is of “royal Irish heritage,” if such a concept could ever exist!\n\nI did not want to ramble on with too much history as our party had to begin. I finished by discussing a bit of my own direct family history and explained to the audience the story of Michael Francis Considine, my last direct relative to have lived in County Clare.\n\nAfter the talk and discussion, two local and well-known musicians, Adrian O’Connor and Rita Dowling, took to their instruments to entertain the Considines with their brilliant traditional Irish music. At one point there were so many loud Considines at Considine’s Bar that you could hardly even hear them play. At about 11pm the bar was completely packed. One could hardly even move or lift an arm to take a sip of their drink. Rumor has it that Considines were drinking until the wee hours of the morning. Surprised?\n\nTowards the end of the party I met a man named Mickie Considine, who was born in Ardeamush, Lisdoonvarna, but now lives in London (and has done so for the last 40 years). I explained to Mickie that my great-grandfather, Michael Francis, was born in Ardeamush and owned land there. Indeed, the fathers and grandfathers of Michael Francis also owned that land.\n\nMickie invited my father and I to meet him at The Ritz hotel in Lisdoonvarna at 11:30am on Sunday, our last day of the trip. Mickie said he wanted to show us around Ardeamush as my father and I had previously had difficulty navigating our way. Ardeamush is not particularly easy to find. I could hardly figure out where it began and ended.\n\nSo Mickie met us in Lisdoonvarna and brought us over to his house, which he built some years ago during the Celtic Tiger. He is a builder in London and was able to build a beautiful house in Ardeamush. Mickie’s lovely wife Sue and their kids joined us at the kitchen table for tea and snacks. There is nothing like Irish hospitality!\n\nAfter chatting for a bit I brought out my computer to show Mickie and the rest the land that our ancestors once owned in Ardeamush. We have details of their property through Griffith’s Evaluation 1855, which marks the land they owned. The map notes that they owned land marked 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe evening before I had taken a Google satellite image of Ardeamush in the hope that we would be able to find a match of our historic land. Mickie and Sue took a glimpse at both maps and started discussing with one another. I was right by their side to make sure I did not miss anything. They first located their own house on the Google map. From there they wanted to match up the roads on the Google map with the roads and boundaries on the 1855 map. There was one key road that was found on both maps. Mickie’s house happened to be right on that road.\n\nTo make a long story short, the evidence concludes quite obviously that Mickie actually now owns the land that my ancestors once owned.\n\nIt was a spectacular moment as you can imagine. We searched long and hard for this moment for years. At first we thought the news was too good to be true, but the more we looked at the maps, the more obvious it became.\n\nBelow are the two maps which we compared and contrasted. The Google map on the right has a yellow circle which notes the location of Mickie’s house. You can even see the house if you look very closely. The blue circle on the 1855 map is the present-day place of Mickie’s house. Areas 1, 2, and 3 on the 1855 map were owned by my ancestors. You will notice the black lines on both maps and how that road is the same now as it was in 1855. You can even see the loop on the street to the right of the blue and yellow circles. Further evidence is found in the house being so close to Island on both maps. I feel like the evidence is pretty conclusive. What do you think?\n\nMickie took my father and I out for a tour of the property. One could not ask for a more beautiful seen. The massive green fields, which were perfect for farming, lit up with a fluorescent green. The land was marked by stone walls, which were overgrown with vines and other brush. The Atlantic Ocean was to our right and only a kilometer or two away (if that!). In the distance one can see O’Brien’s Tower and the edge of the famous Cliffs of Moher. Never in my wildest dream did I imagine that our historic land could be so beautiful.\n\nIn short, meeting Mickie and finding our ancestral property is best summed up with the phrase – “It was all meant to be.” It makes me wonder about divine providence. My mind drifts and I think of whether those Considines before me were out there somewhere in the universe and looking down on my father and I. It was all too perfect, too ordered, too neat.\n\nPerhaps it was simply “the luck of the Irish.”\n\nRelated articles"
