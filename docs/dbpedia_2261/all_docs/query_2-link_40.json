Perhaps inspired by his education at the University of Notre Dame, O'Brien also authored Hesburgh: A Biography, the life story of Reverend Theodore Hesburgh, the university's president from the 1950s through most of the 1980s. In addition to expanding the university both physically and financially, Hesburgh was also appointed to committees by three different popes and six U.S. presidents, most notably the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, and was instrumental in the formation of the Peace Corps. Through it all, Hesburgh became known as one of the most important U.S. Catholics of the twentieth century. A writer for Publishers Weekly called O'Brien's biography \"detailed but accessible\" and full of \"significant insight.\"\n\nO'Brien's next work, John F. Kennedy: A Biography, takes on a subject already familiar to many readers. In scouring the large body of newly unclassified government documents devoted to Kennedy, O'Brien distilled the information into what he felt was an accurate picture of Kennedy as a political leader, putting aside the legend of Camelot and speculation about the darker side of the Kennedy legacy. The result is a \"singularly inclusive\" portrait, according to a Publishers Weekly reviewer. Ultimately, O'Brien considers Kennedy a formidable president, and in this \"well-written and empathetic biography,\" in the words of Library Journal reviewer William D. Pederson, Kennedy \"emerges … as an active and flexible politician.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, December 1, 1998, Mary Carroll, review of Hesburgh: A Biography, p. 624.\n\nLibrary Journal, December 1, 2004, William D.
