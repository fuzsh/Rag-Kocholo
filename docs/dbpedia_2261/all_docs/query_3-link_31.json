        "text": "Prior to the incorporation of Kaukauna as a city, the north and south side were considered separate villages separated by the Fox River with no bridge to cross to either side. As a result, all businesses and services were duplicated. Today many services are still offered on both sides of the river including funeral homes. How many funeral homes were located on both sides of the river? Kaukauna did not lack in undertaker and embalming services.\n\nIn the early days there were no separate funeral homes. The first funeral undertakers were woodworkers, furniture makers or carpenters. Since the owner of a furniture store was usually a carpenter who made the furniture and caskets he sold, it was only natural that casket making and undertaking business became a secondary business for most furniture stores.\n\nThus George W. Fargo brought the first undertaking business to the north side of Kaukauna in 1881. He rented, later purchasing, a small wooden building from Jacob Rieth on Wisconsin Avenue and opened up his business. George was a carpenter and with his tools produced many of the pieces of furniture and caskets which he sold. An 1881 ad in the Kaukauna Times stated that George W. Fargo had opened up in the building formerly occupied by Druggist Kellogg and included a new stock of furniture including bedsteads, chairs, lounges, stands, bureaus, mirrors, etc. Fargo also attended to undertaking in all its branches with years of experience.\n\nIn most cases the wife helped out in the furniture store and assisted with the embalming and preparation of a body for viewing. Mrs. Fargo helped out in both areas.\n\nThere were times in early spring when the Fargo Store and undertaking service could not be reached due to the muddy Wisconsin Avenue. A common site to see was two to three wagons stuck in the clay until the street dried up enough to extricate the wagons.\n\nA few years later Fargo purchased the property and in 1898 built a brick building on the site of the old store.\n\nOn the south side, Ledyard, in 1881, Andrew Galmbacher was listed in the City Directory as a carpenter at 7th and Crooks Avenue. His ad mentioned that he had received a splendid stock of caskets and coffins and was prepared to furnish anything in this line. A hearse would be furnished promptly when ordered.\n\nIn 1890 Fargo decided to open up a second furniture store and undertaking business on the south side, located in the Elks building ( where Verfurth’s Shoe Store was located) and in the process bought out the Galmacher stock. The Galmacher Store and undertaking business closed. Shortly after the Fargo store was destroyed by fire and Fargo moved his business into the Lindauer building ( where Bastians Dime Store was located) as soon as it was completed. In 1885 a fire destroyed the Lindauer building, including the Fargo store. Fargo moved into the Kuehn building following the fire. George Fargo became ill in 1909 and he was forced to close his store and undertaking business on the south side.\n\nAfter George Fargo’s death in 1911, his son, Bert, took over the business and was joined by T.W. Lindstrom in 1918 and Lawrence A. Gerend in 1922. In 1928 he constructed a new brick building, an example of 20th Century Classical Revival Architecture on the site of the present store. Bert retired in 1954, the same year that another fire struck the store and funeral home and caused extensive damage. Two years later Arthur C. Gandt began working for Fargo’s, eventually becoming a partner with Fargo.\n\nIn 1963 Fargo Funeral Home opened up a new funeral home with two large chapels at 400 W. Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nIn 1969 Tony Klapperich began working for Fargo’s, eventually becoming a partner with Gandt. Gandt retired in 1987 and Tony Klapperich continued to operate the funeral home for several years after Wichmann Funeral Home purchased the Fargo Funeral Home in 1998. Wichmann Funeral Home continues to operate the funeral home.\n\nHorse drawn hearse. Built in late 1880s. George Greenwood drove the team of horses pulling the hearse in the parade marking Kaukauna’s 175th anniversary.\n\nIn 1885 Friedrich Lindauer Furniture Dealer and Undertaker opened up for business on Third Street. Lindauer advertised that he kept coffins constantly on hand at his Ledyard store. The family had moved to Kaukauna two years earlier and Friedrich’s son, Luther, would become a millionaire and entrepreneur in the paper industry, own a multitude of businesses and serve three terms (1890-1893) as Kaukauna mayor.\n\nFred Lindauer became a co-partner with his father in 1890 and noted that they would enlarge the goods that the store carried and undertaking would be given promptly. They built a new store at 206 Third Street (address of the old Kaukauna Fire Department).\n\nLindauer and Son decided to expand their business and opened up a second store on Wisconsin Avenue in 1892. Two years later, the Lindauer’s closed their north side store and Joseph Wirtz bought and disposed of the stock at below cost. In 1901 Fred Lindauer left the business and moved to Grand Rapids, Minnesota to work in a paper mill owned by his brother, Luther. In 1911 Friedrich Lindauer retired from the furniture and undertaking business and Peter Metz took over the furniture store.\n\nThe only furniture and undertaking businesses listed in the 1883 City Directory were G. W. Fargo & Sons, F. Lindauer and E. C. Griswold. Griswold came to Kaukauna in 1881 where he opened a jewelry, furniture and undertaking business on the north side. He was the first jeweler to settle permanently in the city and later sold his jewelry business to John Scheer. Later that year he moved to the Kuehn building (Kaukauna Hardware) on the south side where he continued with his furniture, jewelry and undertaking business until he sold the furniture and undertaking business to H. Welch & Co. in 1913.\n\nIn 1905 R. J. Coad was the first business to open up as an exclusive undertaking establishment in a brick building on Second Street formerly owned by W. R. Spranger. Coad was noted as an “up-to-date “undertaker whose store included a large line of caskets and all the stock that went with a first class undertaking establishment. He established sleeping rooms on the second floor and had a telephone placed in the room in order to promptly respond to night calls. Coad also had an electric button installed at the right of his store entrance for those who wanted to talk to him personally. By February 1906 R. C. Coad decided to move to Green Bay and open an undertaking business there. No reason was given for leaving Kaukauna.\n\nGeorge Fargo’s residence and furniture and funeral home on W. Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nThe Saecker Brothers furniture dealer and undertakers were one of the first businesses to move into the new Central Block building on the corner of Main Avenue and Second Street when it opened in 1901. The members of the business were brothers; W. F. Saecker, H. Saecker and nephew H. H. Rogers.\n\nA year later the firm of Saecker and Rogers was bought out by the Saecker brothers and renamed Saecker Brothers’ Furniture and Undertaker Dealers. The brothers made arrangements with the Appleton store of Saecker & Rogers to purchase all furniture and undertaking supplies in car lots, thereby giving the public the advantage of the lowest price.\n\nIn 1905 the Saecker Brothers decided to close their store and undertaking business in Kaukauna and moved to Menasha where they opened up a new store.\n\nIn September 1909 undertaker Charles Jansky, who conducted a furniture and undertaking establishment in West De Pere, sold his De Pere store and moved to Kaukauna and opened up an undertaking room in the Devine building on Wisconsin Avenue. Shortly after Jansky purchased Mr. Schubert’s picture frame business and rented several rooms for his business.\n\nUndertaker Jansky was given authority by the State Registrar Board to issue certificate of deaths in the Towns of Freedom, Kaukauna, Holland, Harrison and Lawrence. This allowed Jansky to take charge of the remains and not have to seek out the town clerk first.\n\nIn 1912 Jansky purchased a new ambulance which he had constructed to fit over his Flander’s auto. It was built by Wagonmaker William Klumb of Kaukauna. Jansky used the ambulance to haul around caskets, rough boxes, funeral apparatus and convey bodies if necessary. He purchased a thirty-foot lot next to Nugent’s Theater (where the Rialto Theater was located) on Lawe Street and erected a modern undertaker parlor.\n\nTwo years later Charles Jansky purchased the old Brothers’ house and 90-foot front on Lawe Street. He moved the building up within 12 feet of the street for a residence and built a morgue and 16×34 foot show room for his casket room. He also remodeled the entire house. In order to make this move, Jansky sold his lot next to the Nugent Theater.\n\nIn 1916 Jansky leased a room in the Central Block. Besides his undertaking and picture framing business he added a branch of Fox River Marble Works (located in Appleton) who sold monuments and stones. One year later Charles Jansky moved his business from Kaukauna to Two Rivers where he continued his undertaking business.\n\nWelch & Company took over the furniture and undertaking business of E. C. Griswold in the Kuehn building in November 1912. The members of the business were Fred Griswold, licensed undertaker and Harry Welch who had been connected with the furniture business for 12 years at Ripon and New London. In January 1914 H. Welch & Co. moved their furniture and undertaking business to the Odd Fellows building (approximately 2-4 stores east of Central Block). A deck or second floor was added, allowing for a larger display of furniture. An office room was partitioned off and a separate room was used to store caskets and undertaking paraphernalia. Welch added an outside electric sign, one of the very few stores with an outside electric light sign.\n\nBy June 1914 H. Welch & Co. was forced to file for bankruptcy. The combined assets of the firm were $3,500 ($108,614 today), with liabilities aggregating $7,000 ($217,228 today). The furniture stock was offered for sale and purchased by F. M. Charlesworth, who in turn sold the stock to the general public.\n\nIn 1920 L. C. Feehan moved to Kaukauna and leased the building next to the Grand View Hotel. He advertised a first class undertaking parlor and did picture framing. The following year he moved to store rooms formerly occupied by Swerdlow Shoe Store four doors north of the Times office. Feehan hung an electric light sign in front of the building.\n\nGreenwood Funeral Home in the Kuehn building (Kaukauna Hardware Store) 1930.\n\nIn 1924 Feehan’s Undertaking parlor moved to the Kuehn building (Kaukauna Hardware building) in the space vacated by Merbach Furniture Store. He completely remodeled the building adding a mortuary, office and chapel for those who did not wish to use their home for funerals of family members. Feehan purchased a gray hearse and a year later purchased a new Reo hearse. In 1926 he purchased a 75-horsepower funeral coach from Piqua, Ohio. The new coach had a removable flower rack, the inside was upholstered in mohair and trimmed in colonial silver with black walnut woodworks. A heavy Wilton rug covered the floor.\n\nIn 1929 L. C. Feehan announced that he had sold his undertaking and picture framing business to George R. Greenwood and his wife, Helen. Greenwood was a graduate of the Worsham Training School of Anatomy Sanitary Science and Embalming. For the previous several years he was associated with Fraser Funeral Home of Manitowoc.\n\nThe ad in the Times listed George Greenwood as funeral director and licensed embalmer, picture frames and wallpaper business. He was located at 148 Second Street in the Kuehn building. In 1932 He purchased the only ambulance in Kaukauna, which was available for immediate use and out of town trips. The ambulance was equipped with first aid heating supplies and ventilating apparatus.\n\nGreenwood advertised the Royal Purple Vault which was guaranteed not to leak. Each vault was enameled in royal purple and registered by serial number to protect the public against inferior materials.\n\nRight after George and Helen Greenwood arrived in Kaukauna the stock market crashed causing a double whammy in Kaukauna when the railroad shops closed and moved to Green Bay. Many times, in those depression years, Greenwood received poultry and vegetables for partial payment. He sold wallpaper and framed pictures for supplementary income. He was often heard saying that “hardship is an endeavor which helps create success.” At the time most funerals were conducted from the homes of the deceased. Greenwood noted the growth of stand-alone funeral homes in large cities and in 1938 built a two-story funeral home on Hendricks Avenue.\n\nGeorge and Helen Greenwood continued to operate the funeral home on Hendricks Avenue. In 1954 their eldest son, George R. (Bud) who was a graduate mortician returned to Kaukauna and joined his father in the funeral home. The youngest son, Larry, worked along with his brother through the years. Bud Greenwood purchased the funeral home from his father in 1969. George R. Greenwood died in 1970 and Helen and her two sons continued to operate the funeral home until Helen’s retirement in 1987.\n\nFargo Funeral Home purchased the Greenwood Funeral Home (family business for 58 years) in October 1987. Bud Greenwood favored the sale since he was close to retirement and wanted to keep continuity in the operation of the funeral home. Anthony O. Klapperich, owner of Fargo’s Funeral Home stated that times were changing in the funeral profession, including adding a pre-need department which would be set up to serve both funeral homes. The funeral home was renamed Greenwood-Fargo Funeral Home.\n\nIn 1998 Wichmann Funeral Home purchased the Fargo Funeral home in Kaukauna which included the Greenwood–Fargo Funeral Home. Very few funerals were scheduled at the Greenwood Funeral Home and one of the last funerals was former owner, George (Bud) Greenwood in 2015. The funeral home closed several years later.\n\nA new funeral home opened on the south side in Kaukauna in 1996. Kent and Lisa Boettcher broke ground on their building on Fieldcrest Drive in October and served their first funeral the following June. Their business followed a family tradition of funeral services in the Kent family. Kent’s father operated a funeral home in Seymour for over 40 years and many of the family members were involved in the funeral business.\n\nGreenwood Funeral Home on Hendricks Avenue. 1940s.\n\nKent graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in Mortuary Science in 1984 and completed his apprenticeship a year later at Gunderson funeral Home Madison.\n\nThe building was designed to resemble a house to put visitors at ease. There was a lounge area which offered children a grief library, television and VCR, refrigerator and microwave. There was an emphasis on helping children deal with the death of a loved one.\n\nThe Boettcher family operated the funeral home for 22 years before retiring and selling the funeral home to Derek Van Deurzen in 2018.\n\nThe Verkuilan-Van Deurzen Funeral home is owned by Funeral Director Derek Van Deurzen, a life-time resident of Little Chute. He graduated from Kaukauna High School and Milwaukee Area Technical College where he majored in Mortuary Science.\n\nDerek was employed by Verkuilan Funeral Home since 2009. In 2014 he purchased the funeral home from George and Ann Kessler. Funeral Director Derek Van Deurzen continues to operate the Verkuilan-Van Deurzen Funeral Home on Fieldcrest Drive.\n\nToday there are two funeral homes in Kaukauna. Wichmann Fargo Funeral Home is on the north side and Verkuilen-Van Deurzen Funeral Home is on the south side.\n\nMost of us refer to the building on the corner of Main Avenue and Second Street as the Pechman building. This historic Central Block building has been sold and the new owner plans to renovate the building for apartments and retail. How did such a magnificent building end up on that corner? We can go back to when the south side was booming with business due to the railroad.\n\nThe railroad had roared into Ledyard which shortly after became the south side of the city of Kaukauna. The property near the depot and railroad village became prime property sought after by many investors.\n\nJohn Hoberg, a Kaukauna resident, purchased the property on the south east corner of Main Avenue (Fourth Ave.) and Second Street and built the Prospect Hotel which opened in January 1886. Proprietor Daniel Curtain advertised rooms for regular boarders and visitors. The first-rate hotel was surrounded by muddy roads and plank or muddy sidewalks. Within two years John Hoberg drilled a 300-foot artesian well in the rear of the Prospect Hotel providing the hotel with excellent drinking water.\n\nIn 1888 fire, thought to have started in the chimney, swept through the hotel resulting in a loss of $7,000 ($228,661 today). Hoberg started repairing the hotel and tore out the side of the Prospect Hotel fronting Second Street to make two stores in the building, one fronting Second Street and one facing Main Avenue.\n\nJohn Stevens, Neenah millionaire, visited Kaukauna in 1894 with the intention of purchasing property. Stevens, a Neenah flour miller, operated the Falcon Flouring Mill in Neenah. He had perfected the steel roller process for milling wheat and in 1880 sold the patent rights to the Pillsbury Company. He ended up buying John Hoberg’s block of three stores on the corner of Main Avenue and Second Street. Property was cleared and construction of a large two-story building to be known as “Central Block” was completed in 1901.\n\nThe Kaukauna Times reported that no other building in Kaukauna was as luxurious as the Central Block building and the reporter felt that a detailed description of the building would demonstrate that. “The new block covers a 50×100 foot lot, is two stories high, with basement under entire building. It is built of St. Louis grey pressed brick, the highest priced brick on the market, with plain terra cotta trimmings. Two large name stones with “Central Block” inscribed there on appear on either front. The foundation walls are massive and are built up from a solid rock foundation. The ground floor is divided into four rooms. The First National Bank occupies the corner, which is 25×58 feet.\n\n“All rooms on the first floor are lighted by extra-large plate glass fronts of latest modern design with deep entrances. The entire first floor is built with iron column supports between petitions and so arranged that should occasion ever require all the interior walls can be removed and the four rooms converted into once large store room covering the entire 50×100 feet space.\n\n“The First National Bank room is fitted up as elaborate as many like institutions in large cities most of the fittings being a part of the building. The lobby of the bank has a tile floor, hardwood wainscoting with marble base to match floor. The room throughout, including a 10×15 foot solid masonry foundation built up from rock. On top of the base is constructed the vault proper, which is an entirely new departure from the common form. There is a storage space 5×7 feet, encased first in a steel wall constructed of pieces of railroad rails sawed to proper lengths fitted together so that three rail sections make a square and all firmly bolted and riveted together, twenty tons of rails having been used in construction. A wall is formed which is declared by experts to be almost impenetrable as the many bevels on the rails resist the points of drills, even to electrical appliances. The only similar vault known to exist is the one at Evanston where Chicago bankers keep their personal valuables. The steel work on the vault was done by the Kaukauna Machine Works.\n\n“Outside the steel wall is built a 28 inch masonry wall. The outside vault door is fitted with a combination lock with additional triple time lock. The vestibule door comes next with combination locks and inside of all this is a time lock safe in which is found the money vault, with still another lock, making five separate safety locks from outside to cash vault and other valuables. An additional 4×7 foot vault is provided wherein are located the safety deposit boxes and shelves for books, papers, etc. J. F. Bertles, the Green Bay expert who makes frequent examinations of most of the safes in the state, pronounces the First National Bank vault one of the very best north of Chicago.\n\n“The second floor is divided into eleven well apportioned and splendidly lighted office rooms, all of which have hall entrances and all so arranged that they can be rented in suites if desired. Each room is supplied with fine marble lavatories with nickel-plated fittings. The rooms are finished in solid red oak in natural color, with Flemish brass locks and trimmings on doors, windows and transoms.\n\n“The rooms are finished in solid red oak in natural color, with Flemish brass locks and trimmings on doors, windows and transoms. The rooms are models of plain finish, the walls being calsomined in tinted dark soft colors, the colors varying according to location and light. Each room is supplied with ventilator, steam heat radiators and water supply. For convenience and cleanliness as well, a good sized chute is provided in the main hallway in which can be put all second floor dirt accumulations. The chute leads to the ash-bin in the basement. Toilet rooms are provided on both first and second floors. The floors of the office rooms are all hardwood deadened with quarter-inch matting material.\n\n“One large room on the second floor which was originally planned for a lodge hall has been connected by elevator with the Saecker & Rogers furniture store and is now in use by this firm, who have their undertaking department fitted up in a portion of it. The office rooms are now for rent and can be leased either single or in suites for offices or living rooms at moderate rates. rooms at the right of the main entrance.\n\n“Each ground floor room is provided with elegant basement with plastered walls and cement floors, and well-lit with windows and electric lights.\n\n“The furnace, one of the latest improved Magee pattern, is located in the basement. It has a heating capacity of one-third more than is required for the building, so there will never be any trouble from this source. The furnace and connecting steam pipes are encased with heavy coatings of asbestos and magnesia coverings and holds the heat so well that the bare hand can be laid on any part of the apparatus in the basement.\n\n“The building, of course, is equipped throughout with electric lights, each part of the building and various rooms having independent switches. The wiring and fixtures were installed by the Kaukauna Electric Light company.\n\n“The plumbing, ventilation, etc., was installed by plumber Jos. Bailey of this city, and is pronounced by those who know to be one of the finest and most complete jobs in this line in the state outside of Milwaukee. The plumbing in detail consists of fourteen Tennessee red marble laboratories, supported by cast brass nickel plated legs, with improved Gielow centrifugal adjustable vented brass nickel plated lavatory traps; six improved syphon closets, with nickel plated brass supply and flush pipes, bent oak tanks and adjustable seats, together with necessary urinals, sinks, etc., all open plumbing is nickel plated brass pipes attached to extra heavy lead and cast iron pipes; the sewerage pipes are of extra heavy cast iron, leaded, cast iron, lead caulked, with blow-outs and five-inch vents to outside air; water is supplied to all fixtures through extra heavy lead pipes; as stated before the system is most complete in every minute detail and is one intended to sand for years without repairs.\n\n“The plans and specification were furnished by Architect Wildhagen of Appleton, who at the request of Stevens included the best of everything. The construction work was under the supervision of August Knueppel of Appleton. Mr. Stevens says he feels proud of his Kaukauna structure and certainly Kaukauna has reason to also feel proud.”\n\nBesides the National Bank, the Kaukauna Free Public Library occupied a two room suite facing Main Avenue. The Western Union Telegraph Company moved into a three-room suite to the right of the main entrance. Between 1901 and 1920 businesses, physicians, at least five chiropractors, lawyers, and insurance companies were among the occupants of the Central Block.\n\nA few of the occupants included physicians and surgeons, Dr. Titus and Dr. Foster; Dr. Sullivan a dentist, Frank Konrad Clothing Store, and the Saecker Brothers who sold sewing machines, furniture, pianos and provided undertaking and embalming services. The Transient Saloon opened up facing Main Avenue. Annie Seggelink, dressmaker moved into Room 12. Kaukauna Gas, Electric Light and Power Co. occupied an office with plumber William Hogan. The Elite Restaurant owned by E. L. Darling moved into a first floor room. Offices were secured by the law Circuit Court Commissioner, Kaukauna Land & Timber Supply Company, and H. Weifenbach, secretary of Wisconsin Building & Loan Association. C. J. Jansky, embalmer & funeral director moved into the rooms vacated by Saecker Brothers.\n\nThe Knights of Pythias rented a large meeting room on the second floor and other local organizations held their meetings in this room.\n\nIn 1912 one of Kaukauna’s leading manufacturers (company was not named) called the Kaukauna Sun and suggested that City Hall rent the entire second floor of the Central Block for offices and council room. City Council was in the process of finding a larger space. City Hall did not respond to the request.\n\nIn 1920 the Farmers & Merchants Bank bought the Central Block from John Stevens for $29,500 ($457,731 today). At the time, the first floor was occupied by First National Bank, the City Electric Department, the south side post office, Heegeman’s Jewelry Store and Hendricks Saloon.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1937 the occupants continued to move in and out. A number of chiropractors and physicians occupied the building. The Green Bay & Mississippi Canal Company rented an office. The Farmers & Merchants Bank moved into its newly remodeled quarters formerly occupied by the National Bank. The two banks had merged several years earlier. The Post office engineer rented an office in 1936 while the new Kaukauna post office was constructed on Main Avenue. Looks Drugstore was located in a room on the first floor. Additional occupants included Kavanaugh Barbershop, Joseph Lefevre, and Joseph Wolf Tavern Dr. Deloria, dentist, began his dental practice in 1933 and was located in the in the Central Block. Shortly after Frank J. Pechman moved his photography studio into the Central Block building, facing Main Avenue.\n\nDr. Alphons Bachhuber moved to Kaukauna in 1922 and set up his practice in a building near the library. Shortly after he moved into the Central Block building. His brother Dr. Alois Bachhuber soon joined him. Together they developed the first clinic with an X-Ray machine and did their own blood work and lab tests.\n\nIn 1937 Central Block was swept by flames propelled by a north wind. The fire moved south to the front of the building on the second floor. Flames didn’t reach the first floor, but the roof and second floor were completely destroyed. Most of the damage was to the meeting hall on the second floor used by the Eagles, Catholic Order of Foresters, Pulp & Papermaking Union, Catholic Knights of Wisconsin and Women’s Catholic Order of Foresters. The loss was more than $50,000 ($1,077,521 today). Many businesses were temporarily displaced until repairs were completed.\n\nFollowing repairs John Witt opened a paint, wallpaper and automobile accessories store and the firm of Sigman and Sigman, Appleton, opened a branch office in the building. Shortly after Frank J. Pechman moved his photography studio into Central Block facing Main Avenue.\n\nIn 1942 the Bachhuber doctors purchased the Central Block from the Farmers & Merchants Bank and businesses in the building continued as before.\n\nOn January 12,1950, an early morning fire threatened to destroy the Central Block building. The blaze started in the Avenue Bar, operated by John Blaha, at the north end of the building facing Main Avenue. It quickly spread to the adjoining Pechman Photography Studio. Both businesses were severely damaged by the flames, smoke and water. Work on rebuilding and renovating the damaged Central Block building began as soon as possible after the fire debris was removed and cleaned up.\n\nAbout 1959 Pechman started the F. J. Pechman professional Color Lab and expanded into the second floor of the Central Block building. The business immediately gained recognition for its quality throughout the United States.\n\nIn 1971 F. J. Pechman was a half-million dollar business. The main business was the operation of its $300,000 ($2,313,570 today) color processing lab which was gaining a reputation throughout the states as the best. At this time Milton Kinney was general manager (later would become vice-president). The company no longer used the “darkroom” process. Materials to develop photos moved on an assembly line basis. The assembly line equipment required more space and in order to expand the F. J. Pechman Professional Color labs purchased the Central Block building or Pechman building.\n\nLater in the year CPI, formerly a division of Chromalloy America purchased the F. J. Pechman Professional Color Labs from F. J. Pechman, with the commitment that business would continue as usual. The lab had sales in all 50 states. Pechman as a division of CPI and the St. Louis Corporation, agreed that the Kaukauna operation would become independent. This was the same year that F. J. Pechman retired and moved to Door County to start a second career as an artist and writer.\n\nIn 1987 Miller Masonry removed the decorative brick work atop the Central Block building. After removal new tuckpointing was completed. At this time F. J. Pechman Color Lab was located in the building. The following year F. J. Pechman Professional Labs was purchased from the Consumer Products, Inc. of St. Louis by the present manager, Frank D. Hurst and his wife Andrea. Pechman processes and prints professional portraiture for studio photographers throughout the country. The business continued to occupy the Central Block-Pechman building as Pechman Imaging Media Transfer and Print Service.\n\nIn 2024 the Imaging company moved to Little Chute and the Central Block building was sold to Clay Eiting who is in the process of renovating the building for apartments on the upper level and commercial space on the first level.\n\nThe earliest documentation of a postmaster in the Kaukauna area was made by Ebenezer Childs, an American pioneer, builder and legislator. He was commissioner of a road building project on the east side of the Fox River to Kaukauna. Childs married Augustin Grignon’s daughter, Marguerite. In his autobiography he states “I was appointed sheriff of Brown County, Michigan Territory, a post I held until 1836. I was appointed postmaster at Grand Kakalin on the Fox River in 1829 and resigned after one year.” The post office was located in a frame building built in 1828. Kaukauna was the third community in Wisconsin to have a post office. Rev. Cutting Marsh was named postmaster at Grand Cackalin, Brown County, Michigan Territory in 1832. The exact date of when Grand Kakalin was changed to Cakalin is not known. Records collected by Mrs. Ross C. Grignon and Jon Mitchell indicate that Alexander Grignon was appointed the third postmaster on March 5, 1835, and while serving as postmaster the post office was changed to Wisconsin Territory. There is no mention of where the post office was located.\n\nAt that time postage paid on letters was paid at the post office where the letter was received. In a quarterly report Postmaster Grignon shows that the amount of money collected at the post office during a three-month period, April 1, 1836, to June 10, 1836, was $7.15. During this period postage collected on letters was $1.50 and on newspapers and pamphlets $5.65 for a total of $7.15 (about $204 today.) Instead of a salary the postmaster received a commission on the postage collected. Postmaster Grignon’s share on the letter postage was 30% or 45 cents. The commission for newspapers and pamphlets was 50% or $2.82 for a total of $3.27 (about $85 today). The United States Post Office capped postage commission at $500 and Alexander Grignon did not receive any commission on postage over $500.\n\nA post office was established at Kaukauna July 25, 1849. The post office was located in a building on Wisconsin Avenue where Uptown Girl Beauty & Boutique is now located. Alexander Grignon was appointed postmaster. George Lawe succeeded Grignon on April 13, 1851, and the name of the post office was changed to Kaukauna in Outagamie County on April 18, 1851. At this time, according to the Fox River Memory Project, M. M. B. (no name given) was postmaster with an office on the south side.\n\nThe building of the Kaukauna Water Power Canal in 1885 revitalized Statesburgh on the south side, which was incorporated as Ledyard. Ledyard immediately established a post office on the south side. When talks began about incorporating Ledyard and Kauauna (north side) as one city, citizens were immediately concerned with where the post office would be located.\n\nBoth post offices were located in business buildings and neither side of the river wanted to lose their post office if the two sides incorporated as a city. Since the Ledyard post office was the last post office commissioned, Ledyard citizens were worried that their post office would be the first one to go. Frank Charlesworth, who owned a drugstore on the south side, was against losing the south side post office. Captain D. J. Brothers, owner of Hotel Brothers (Hotel Kaukauna), felt\n\nstrongly that the communities could consolidate with each side of the river keeping their post office.\n\nThe first assistance postmaster general on Jan. 28, 1885, notified Dr. Tanner that the proposed consolidation should not necessitate the discontinuance of either post office at Kaukauna or Ledyard since the two villages appeared on the postal maps to be separated by a river and the post offices received mail from two different railroads, Ledyard received mail from Milwaukee Lakeshore & Western Railroad and Kaukauna received mail from the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad.\n\nAfter consolidating into the city of Kaukauna, citizens started complaining about the slow mail delivery and mail delivered to the wrong side of the river. Kaukauna postmaster Joseph Wirtz published a letter in the Kaukauna Times to the South Kaukauna Postmaster Hugh Mulholland concerning the mail problem.\n\nPostmaster Wirtz stated that “Three letters were sent from South Kaukauna post office and two letters arrived seven days later. Citizens started complaining that some mail deliveries to the north side post office were taking too long to receive. I am upset that mail was being held for three to six days at “some other post office” before being transferred to the Kaukauna Post Office.” As the battle between the two post offices increased, Postmaster Joseph Wirtz wrote to Postmaster Mullholland that he wanted all Kaukauna mail delivered to the Kaukauna Post Office on the north side. In turn Postmaster Wirtz would send the mail he received that was addressed to citizens and businesses on the south side immediately to the south side. In the month of March 1886 that included 3,370 letters. However, Postmaster Wirtz noted that he sent letters to South Kaukauna addressed to businessmen and others who had holding boxes at the South Kaukauna Post Office and the same letters came back to the north side post office without being stamped as received at South Kaukauna.\n\nThe major problem was that mail delivered to the south side post office was delivered by the Milwaukee Lakeshore & Western Railroad and mail for the north side post office was delivered by the Chicago & North Western Railroad. It didn’t matter whether mail was addressed to the south or north post office, the mail was delivered to the post office where the train stopped in Kaukauna. When the north or south side post office would resend the mail designated for the south or north side, it was sent by train to a depot (probably Appleton or Green Bay) where both MLS&W railroad and C&NW railroad stopped and the mail was transferred to the right railroad line. and delivered to the north or south side. You need to wonder why someone couldn’t load the mail in a mail pouch and take a toll boat across the Fox River and deliver the mail in a matter of hours instead of days. Mail was picked up once a day by rail. Both postmasters felt that there should be at least two mail pick-ups in 24 hours.\n\nBetween 1885-1909 the post offices on both sides of the river were moved several times because they outgrew the business building they were located in. In 1886 Postmaster Mulholland moved the post office on the south side from the Hoberg building on the corner to the Patton Block. Hoberg wanted to remodel his building which necessitated the post office to move back to where it was located two years ago in 1884. In 1892 Postmaster Thomas Reese decided to move the north side post office to his own building left vacant by druggist Adams. The address was NS\n\nWisconsin Avenue between Lawe and Desnoyer Streets. The South Kaukauna post office later moved to the Mill building, at the corner of 3rd and Main Streets, in the rear of Charlesworth Drugstore.\n\nIn October 1893 Postmaster Lawe moved into a new post office building built by William Eiting. The building was most likely constructed on Wisconsin Avenue. No address was given. In 1907 the South Kaukauna Post Office moved from Charlesworth Drugstore to a vacant store building adjoining the Grand View Hotel, owned by Hugh Mullholland. The new location was 24 feet wide and 52 feet long and had water, heat, light and modern conveniences.\n\nKaukauna rural mail routes were established in 1909 and the United States Postal Department issued a new ruling that “no rural mail carriers need leave any mail at a house where the owner keeps a vicious dog. The owner would have to pick up his mail at the post office.\n\nDuring WWI, the government tried to reduce the high cost of living by selling war supplies through the post office. In 1919 Kaukauna received their one time allotment of supplies and advertised the following for sale at the post office: bacon 35 cents per lb., hash corned beef 20.15 cents per lb., baked beans 5.50 cents per 2 lb. can, sweet corn 11.2 cents per two lb. can, cherries 34 cents per can, black pepper 9.50 cents per lb. can, tomatoes 42 cents per eight lb. can. A person could mail a letter and buy limited cheap groceries at the same time.\n\nThe South Kaukauna Post Office moved from the building adjoining the Grand View Hotel to the Central Block between the First National Bank and the Kaukauna Times Office in 1915.\n\nIn 1919 the citizens on the south side started requesting that their mail be delivered to their house. Postmaster Gerald Koons was hopeful that Kaukauna could meet the criteria for home delivery which included: “A city must have a population of at least 10,000 according to the last census and produce a gross revenue of at least $10,000.”\n\nWhen the United States Post Office Inspector visited the Kaukauna south side post office he assumed that all the streets had paved sidewalks. In the newly annexed section, there were no sidewalks and therefore the houses did not qualify for free delivery. Mayor Charles Raught assured the inspector that the city would try to install sidewalks. John Coppes showed the inspector the plans for a new post office in the municipal building under construction on Main Avenue at the bottom of the Lawe Street Bridge. The inspector approved the plan but was doubtful as to whether there would be sufficient light in the new structure but did waive his objection on this point. He wanted 1600 square feet, which was met by the proposed new post office.\n\nThe post office inspector’s proposal for a Kaukauna post office included:\n\n1. Asking for at least four postman and deliveries would be made twice a day throughout the city as far as sidewalks extended.\n\n2. Needed a proposal from the city of Kaukauna for the furnishing of suitable quarters for post office purposes at Kaukauna, consolidated with South Kaukauna under a lease for five to 10 years from Jan. 1, 1922.\n\n3. Location of new post office not too far from the business center of both sides of the river and within 80 rods of railroad depots.\n\nThe post office located in the new municipal building opened in February 1923. The south side post office closed permanently after 38 years. There was a delay in mail boxes for several months which hindered mail delivery\n\nIn 1927 a notice sent to the city from Washington DC stated that Route No. 5 would be discontinued starting Dec. 31, 1927. From December 1 to March 23 two carriers would be employed on Route No. 4 each having about 24 miles to cover which would include all of route No. 5. During the summer months one carrier covered 48 miles.\n\nBy 1930 there was talk of building a new federal building to house the post office since the lease on the current quarters expired in the next year. The United States Government was appropriating large sums of money for construction of buildings to help alleviate the lack of employment. The city of Kaukauna applied for funds and was told that they would have to wait at least another year. In 1932 the city of Kaukauna received $30,000 (abt. $545,455 today) to construct a new post office on the island between the power canal and the Renn & Co office at 112 Main Avenue, across the road from the Carnegie library. The new post office opened in March 1937. Architect Louis A. Simon designed the post office, Charles Bloss & Sons of Ashland were the general contractors, W. C. Ditter & Sons had the heating and ventilation contract and Kretch Brothers of Kiel had the electrical contract. The architectural style was Colonial Revival/Modera/Georgian style.\n\nThe post office was 83×55 feet, one and a half story building with front and back entrances. As one entered the front door, the money order cage was to the right and beyond that the postmaster’s office. Parcel post and general delivery windows were to the left facing the street. Past them on the north side of the building were the lock boxes. The vault was in the same cage as the money order department. A room for the civil service commission and internal revenue collector to hold business conferences and another room for storage purposes were in the basement. Upstairs was the swing room, headquarters for carriers, which was equipped with lockers, tables and chairs and a lavatory. In the rear of the building was a concrete porch where mail was loaded and unloaded. The driveway was on the north side of the building and there was parking for a few cars in the back.\n\nIn 1938 the Grignon home was featured on the air mail stamp. In addition to a picture of the Grignon Mansion the stamp contained the following: “Kaukauna, Wis. National Air Mail Week. May 15-21. Historic Grignon Home 1837-1938.”\n\nThe post office received a 4×4 foot mural painted by W. Vladimir Reusseff at his home in Fish Creek under the Works Progress Administration Program (WPA) project. The oil painting depicted an early morning scene of Augustine Grignon trading with Native Americans and other agents. The mural was mounted on a wall where customers could view it.\n\nThe WWII years saw many changes at the post office. Besides the fact that several employees were drafted, the employees took on additional work. Car stamps were sold at the post office.\n\nCar owners were required to display the stamp on their car window and were warned to keep their car locked so someone would not steal the stamp.\n\nThe post office received a large supply of V-mail letter sheets available for the transmission of letters without envelopes to and from our armed forces outside of the continental United States. The object of V-Mail was to reduce the weight and bulk of mail to and from the armed forces abroad.\n\nMail to prisoners of war needed to be addressed “To prisoner of war-postmaster.” All postage had to be prepaid and no slogans or other information could be written on the outside of the envelope.\n\nMail addressed to members of the merchant marines operating in the Pacific had their mail addressed to the number after the name of the port in care of postmaster, San Francisco, CA. Mail delivery to seamen in the United States and in cases where the vessel was unknown, listed the name of the seaman, name of ship, c/o name of steamship line, US address of steamship.\n\nThe service honor roll with over 700 names of local men and women serving in WWII was posted at the post office. Citizens were asked to check the list and notify Olin Dryer, high school principle, of any changes or additions.\n\nThe Kaukauna Post Office took an active part in the paper drive pushed by the War Production Board. Rural residents were encouraged to leave all types of waste paper including paper boxes, newspapers and magazines by their rural mail box and the mail carrier would pick up the paper as he delivered the mail.\n\nThe Kaukauna Post Office advanced from a second to a first class office effective January 1, 1944. The post office now reported directly to Washington DC and not to the District Office of Milwaukee as it previously did.\n\nThe 1946 railroad strike restricted mail from Kaukauna to first class and air letter mail limited to 16 ounces or less in weight.\n\nIn 1970 thieves broke into the Kaukauna Post Office and stole mostly cash and stamps. Burglars used an acetylene torch to cut through a window on the building’s south east side, through which the burglars’ dragged their equipment taken from a car parked on Maple Street along the canal retaining wall on the east end of the post office. It appeared to be a professional job and the thieves were never caught.\n\nIn 1974 the post office did not have enough space to efficiently handle sorting, delivering and sending letters and packages. There was very little parking available for the public. The postmaster submitted a request for a new post office to the United States Postal Service.\n\nTwelve years later, in 1986, the request was granted and for the first time the site for the new post office was not located on the island. The site was on the north side between Doty and Sara Streets. The site contained seven homes at 110, 127 and 124 Doty Street and at 123, 117, 115 and 109 Sarah Street) which had to be cleared. A person could buy one of the homes and move it within the designated time frame. Bids were submitted for the demolition of the homes. Not\n\nall local citizens were happy about losing the neighborhood. The construction of the building started in spring of 1987.\n\nG. Hints & Sons Inc. Construction Co. was the main contractor in building the 10,845 square-foot building. The new post office offers triple the work space for employees, three docks for trucks and parking surrounding the building. There are approximately 800 mail box spaces compared with around 200 boxes in the old post office.\n\nIn November 1990, the General Services Administration auctioned off the old post office. The Kaukauna Area School District purchased the building for $50,000 ($95,602 today). The building was remodeled and housed the Kaukauna School District’s Educational Services Building.\n\nThe following year the Kaukauna Area School Board nominated the old 1932 post office building to the National Register of Historic Places, and the register added the building to its list. The historic mural of Grignon trading with the Native Americans remained the property of the post office but was on permanent loan to the Kaukauna Area School District.\n\nThe mural was taken from the old post office and mounted on a wall in the new post office when the Kaukauna Area School District decided to sell the old post office building. The mounting of the mural in the new post office was a special occasion with postal dignitaries from across the country on hand for the ceremony along with local elected officials.\n\nThe old post office was sold to the Freedom Fellowship Church and is utilized as a church.\n\nToday mail from northeast Wisconsin and mail received at the Kaukauna Post Office is sent to Green Bay for sorting .\n\nThe Kaukauna Post Office, a branch location of the United States Postal Services (UPS) serves the Kaukauna community. Customer service provides postal services, offers mail and package delivery services, P.O. box services and passport services. The United States Post Office operates as an independent agency within the federal government, supported entirely by revenues generated through it operation.\n\nPeople tend to identify Kaukauna with that “strong Sulphur odor.” Most of us just shrug it off and point toward the mill or its landfill as the culprit. Yet, you might be surprised to know that early explorers, when passing through Kaukauna noted the odor and there was no mill or land fill, only the Grand Kakalin Rapids and the “Roar of the Lion.” In pioneer times, the Sulphur spring located at what is now the intersection of Plank Road and Augustine Street, was one of a series of odorous springs in the area. The smell was so strong that it could be detected some distance out onto the river, demarking the nearby Grignon landing where the lower portage started. Various historical reports mention this spring as a notable landmark,\n\nGrand Kakalin had the distinct reputation as “stinking\n\nwater” as early as 1673 when Louis Joliet drew a map identifying Green Bay as Baye Des Puaus (bay of stinkers). In 1718 a French captain wrote that during the heat of summer, the water became so foul and Putri, “It is hardly possible to approach the banks on account of the stench.” In 1744 Charlevoix’s Journal Historique he says . . . “Along the entire length of the shore where cabins of Native Americans were built, one saw only rotten fish, with which the air was tainted. Imagine the smell of Sulphur and rotten fish in the same area.”\n\nIn 1840 Congress sent Captain Thomas J. Cram, typographical engineer, to survey the Fox River in anticipation of making the river navigable. In Cram’s report he named the rapids in the Kaukauna area “Grand Kakalin.” He showed no town on the north side of Kaukauna but showed three buildings which he named the “Lawes” at the west end of the flats and toward the east end of the flats five buildings named “Grignon.” The map also showed the Sulphur spring. The cool spring water bubbled out cascading down into the Fox River. Trappers and hunters stopping at the Grignon warehouse and trading post enjoyed quenching their thirst with the cool sulfurous taste.\n\nSulphur compounds are naturally occurring in hot springs and is the source of the characteristic odor which occurs when sulfur binds with oxygen to form the compound sulfate. Interesting to note that the deeper the hot springs the faster it sends its water to the surface and the stronger the smell.\n\nThe Kaukauna Sulphur springs were said to have great medicinal value. In 1844 the Southpost Telegraph newspaper (Kenosha) reported “The medicinal properties of this spring, the convenience of its location and the natural grandeur of the landscape scenery around it, need only be publicly known to render Grand Kakalin a place of fashionable resorts during the summer months.”\n\nWhen the county townships were established in 1857, adjacent to Kaukauna Township, was Springville Township, named for the prominent Sulphur springs. At one time a dance hall was built near the spring and Kaukauna’s first gun club was located near the spring.\n\nThe slough of the Fox River in the area of the Sulphur spring was an ideal fishing area. Fishermen would sit near the Sulphur\n\nspring and shoot pickerel which were plentiful. The slough was filled in when the canal near that area was dredged and much of the area was destroyed.\n\nAt one time the C&NW Railway use to bring water from the springs to the railroad shops on the southside. The Sulphur water was highly valued by the railroad workers as drinking water and for its highly valued health properties.\n\nThe Sulphur spring was so popular that Kaukauna located its picnic grounds near the springs. Each Sunday hundreds of people would gather at the picnic grounds. Many picnickers drank the water and filled jars with the water to take home. By the early 1900s the area was referred to as Sulphur Spring Park by locals and visitors from all over the state. As far as documentation goes the City of Kaukauna never listed Sulphur Spring Park as an official city park. In 1913 about 25 enthusiastic citizens scheduled several meetings to create Sulphur Spring Park. George Haas and Leo Schussman were spearheading the project.\n\nThe group felt that “the springs, trees, flowers and grasses in the spot known as Sulphur Spring Park combined to make it a delightful and healthy place for strolling, picnics or as a recreation ground for the children of the neighborhood.” Once a popular site, the spring had deteriorated and was overgrown with bushes and weeds.\n\nThe group was interested in what it would cost to have the woods cleared of brush, the Sulphur spring cleaned and a swimming pool formed in the lower land east of the spring. A children’s playground would contain swings, merry-go-rounds, teeter-totters and other amusements. Picnic tables and benches would be located throughout the area. A new water tank would enclose the Sulphur spring.\n\nThe committee raised $130 ($3,250\n\ntoday) and that was enough to clear the land. Evidently the group did not raise enough to pursue their dream of a park with swimming pool and playground equipment. Trinity Lutheran Church and St. Paul’s Church of Appleton held a joint church picnic on the grounds. The Outagamie County Training School held an end of the year picnic in the area.\n\nIn order to preserve the spring a wooden wall and cover was built around the spring. People started carving their initials in the cover and it wasn’t long before every letter in the alphabet appeared on the cover. In the late 1920s Monroe Wertheimer, owner of Thilmany Pulp & Paper Company replaced the wooden wall and cover which had deteriorated over time, with a concrete wall and cover and a valve which formed a bubbler for thirsty patrons.\n\nThe Green Bay & Mississippi Canal Company owned the land and consented to allow the area to be used as a park until such time that it would be sold. Water samples from the spring were sent to Madison for testing to make sure the water was drinking quality.\n\nIn the 1940s it was common on a weekend to see three to four cars, parked at the spring while individual filled containers of this healthy water.\n\nIn September 1943, Mr. Holmes a resident in the area of the Sulphur Springs appeared before the city council requesting the city to repair the cement casement around the spring which was badly broken. Water was shut off for several days when a youngster plugged the spout with an apple core. Holmes related that many residents in the area depended on the spring for their drinking water. Holmes had been using the water from the spring since 1912. Repairs were made to the Sulphur Spring, but the area surrounding the springs became overgrown with brush. Today the Sulphur Spring is covered with a concrete cover and no longer flows down to the Fox River.\n\nOther large Sulphur springs, now extinct, were located on the city’s south side below Spring Street and Cutlers Hill at the east end of Seventh Street.\n\nWhile growing up my sisters and I and our neighborhood friends had the luxury of attending two movie theaters. On Sundays we attended the Vaudette and on Friday nights we attended the Rialto theater next to the Hotel Kaukauna on the north side. Mom gave us a quarter and the movie cost 14 cents so we were able to buy a box of Juju’s or a Tootsie Roll or pool our change and share a box of popcorn. Every movie I attended the usher would walk down the aisle with his flashlight reminding us to be quiet. He was forced to do this several times during the movie.\n\nWe walked to the\n\nRialto theater from Dixon Street on the south side. After the movie was over, we waited in the Hotel Kaukauna lobby for a ride home. My grandma worked as a clerk at the hotel until 9:30 pm. Dad would pick her up in his 1938 Pontiac and there was no limit on the number of kids we could squeeze in the back seat of our car\n\nThe Rialto building was rich in theater history which went back to 1905, when the Nugent brothers, Earl and William, opened the first motion picture theater in a building on the site of the Rialto Theater on Lawe Street. They rented the building from D. Brothers and converted it into Nugent’s Five Cents Theater. Later they purchased the building and converted it into the Bijou Theater.\n\nThe Nugent brothers were the sons of Alfred and Eva Nugent, who came to Kaukauna in 1885 from\n\nChilton. Alfred died in 1903 an Eva and her sons continued to live in Kaukauna. The boys attended high school and Northwestern University. Both were talented musicians and became widely known as the composers of popular songs and music. They formed an orchestra about 1897 which was the most popular musical organization in the Fox River Valley.\n\nThe Nugent brothers became licensed members of the Motion Picture Patents of New York City. The company controlled output of the leading American and European film makers and each picture before it was released for sale was subject to censorship.\n\nIn 1905 the\n\nNugent brothers opened the first motion picture theater in the Fox River Valley. Besides short silent movies the Nugent Brothers performed along with other vaudeville acts they hired. Ads described reels of silent films with live vaudeville and music acts between the silent films. The object was to give Kaukauna the best show house in Wisconsin. In 1911 contractor Frank Vander Linden laid 539 feet of cement between Nugent’s Theater and John Street. People were happy with this improvement.\n\nIn 1912 the Nugent brothers decided to extensively remodel and add on to the theater. The back of the building was extended 20 feet and a large 30 x 120 foot movie screen was placed in the center of the wall, instead of the side of the wall where it was previously mounted. More seats were added. The projection booth was moved to the second floor and enlarged and an electric machine and projector added. A small waiting room and a bathroom for ladies were added. The public were happy to have a furnace installed in the building. Capacity increased by 35 seats.\n\nOne of the first performances included\n\nseveral Kaukauna High School class vocal selections and McKee and Huen, in addition to the regular movie program. A year later, in 1913, Earl sold his interest in the theater to John Scheer and purchased the Gem theater at the corner of Broadway and Walnut Streets in Green Bay. Within a year, John decided to return to the jewelry business and Earl’s mother, Eva, bought his share and would continue to manage the theater. Scheer took over the E. C. Griswold jewelry store on Wisconsin Avenue. He previously was employed in a jewelry store in Appleton.\n\nWilliam Nugent was involved in numerous community endeavors and many times dedicated a percentage of revenue from film and performances to various revenue fund raisers such as the benefit of the ladies Jubilee Clubs No.12 & No. 15 of St. Mary’s Church, Congregational Church of Appleton, Young Ladies of Holy Cross Church. At Christmas William had special programs and handouts for children.\n\nAn orchestra pit\n\nwas added in front of the curtain. All side walls were covered with burlap. At the same time a canopy was built over the entrance to the theater and over the sidewalk to the curb. Global electric lights were installed on the canopy. The floor and seats were raised.\n\nIn 1917 the theater was open on Wednesday through Sunday. In December 1917 Nugent’s Bijou theater was destroyed by fire in the evening when the audience was gathering for the evening performance. The fire started from the explosion of a film in the film booth. Strong northwest winds hampered the efforts of the firemen. The crowd passed out in an orderly manner and no one was injured. Eva and William Nugent did not rebuild but sold the theater to Conkey and Cleveland.\n\nThe new owners completed extensive repairs, with special attention paid to safety provisions and the comfort of spectators. The Bijou Theater reopened about five months after the fire. Within a year the owners remodeled the theater. The screen was enlarged and made of plaster and built into the wall. The work was done by Robert Luckow and Reinhard Schermitzler, local contractors. The carbon lights were replaced with the latest 900 watt movie incandescent lamps. These were the same lights installed on President Washington’s ship.\n\nThe Conkey-Cleland Bijou gained a reputation as one of the progressive institutions of Kaukauna for the manager’s well-chosen pictures which suited the community at large. The theater continued with community sponsored programs, especially safety concerns. Special vaudeville acts and the Kaukauna High School orchestra played several times between movie reels.\n\nBy 1922 Conkey-Cleveland sold their theater, the Majestic, in De Pere to George Delaney of Seymour so they could devote all their attention to the Bijou in Kaukauna. Another round of remodeling took place\n\nover the next year. A new picture machine booth was rebuilt and moved to the second floor to accommodate the two machines. Benches were installed at the doors for people waiting for the second show. The length of the building was increased to contain a larger orchestra pit which contained a piano, pipe organ, a five-piece orchestra and 17 effects for describing silent movies with appropriate music. The interior was redecorated and an entire new front rebuilt for a cost of $2,500 ($37,313 today).\n\nIn 1927 Conkey-Cleveland sold the theater to W. A. Kempen, who formerly operated a movie theater in Berlin. He installed new electric lights and new seats. The Bijou theater was renamed the Rex Theater.\n\nIn December 1927 Kempen sold the Rex theater to Frank Matz of Abbotsford and Lydia Andrews, Arnold Metz and Walter Metz, daughter and sons of the owner. Lydia Andrews came from California where she had been associated with a motion studio in Los Angeles.\n\nBy July 1929 Samuel Ludwig, a veteran motion picture\n\nman and distributor of talking devices in the United States and organizer of the Ludwig Film Exchange of Minneapolis purchased the Rex theater. His son, Victor, became the new manager.\n\nLudwig installed equipment for showing “talkie pictures.” This was the end of vaudeville and musical acts appearing between films.\n\nIn 1929 Ludwig leased the Rex theater to W. R. Vincent of Oconto Falls who had been in the motion picture business for the last 19 years. In November Vincent sold the Bijou theater to Fred Beck of Kaukauna. The theater was closed for remodeling which included a new screen, new projection machines, larger amplifier, and new seats. The theater reopened in December 1929 for four days a week as the new Colonial Theater under the management of Naomi and Thelma Becker.\n\nThe first of many\n\nmovies starring actor, Hugh O’Connell, who grew up in Kaukauna was shown.\n\nIn 1934 the theater was sold to Bill Lemke of Chicago who was assistant manager of the Publix Theater in Florida and owner and operator of a theater in Indiana. A new sound system and projectors and lighting system were installed. The exterior of the building was improved with new display boards and a ticket office.\n\nShortly after the Colonial Theater was sold to Fred Becker and two years later Becker sold the theater to Mark Morgan of Milwaukee. Morgan announced that\n\nhe would raze the present theater and construct a new theater on the site. Smith and Brand, Appleton architects drew up the plans with seating capacity of 600. The theater would include air conditioning, upholstered seats, the latest movie and sound equipment, glass front and canopy. The theater opened in 1937 as the Rialto Theater. The opening movie was “Come and Get It” which was taken from a novel written by Edna Ferber, who was born and raised in Appleton. Rube Rosenblatt was hired as manager. Women eagerly awaited the showing of “Star in My Kitchen,” an annual cooking show. The show provided step by step directions in making meals at home. The theater passed out the recipes used during the show to the audience, which was mostly women.\n\nManager Rube Rosenblatt encouraged children’s birthday parties and looked forward to presenting a birthday present to the birthday child. 151,00 people attended the theater in 1938. During the year, a new cooling unit was installed and construction of a huge lounge room known as the Green Room was added.\n\nThe Rialto and Vaudette presented benefit movies and collected 1,200 articles of food for the city poor.\n\nIn 1939 F. J. Pechman and the Rialto\n\nsponsored a personality and beauty contest. Parents had their child’s photo taken by Pechman’s Studio and shown on the Rialto movie screen and people voted. Jimmy Funk won the personality prize and Patsy Siebers won the beauty division.\n\nIn 1940 $240 ($4,286 today) was stolen from the theater safe on the second floor between 11:45 pm and 9:30 am. The side exit door facing Hotel Kaukauna had two holes bored through the door and some object inserted to lift the safety lever. Police figured it occurred after the street light in front of the theater was turned off along with the rest of the street lights making the alley between the theater and hotel very dark.\n\nIn 1941 Walter Holt, a projectionist at the Rialto, became the manager of the Kiel Theater and Francis Biselx, who was the projectionist at the Kiel Theater, returned to Kaukauna to take over Holt’s job. Shortly after returning Biselex was drafted into WWII and Alden Pratt from Dodgeville became the Rialto Theater Manager. Within months Pratt resigned and Tom Reilly was hired as manager.\n\nDuring the war years the Rialto took part in a blackout training session for residents, book\n\ncollection for military bases, selling war bonds and raising money for the Red Cross.\n\nIn 1944 Walter Holt, manager at Kiel Theater became the manager of the Rialto Theater, a position he held before going to Kiel. The theater continued showing the latest movie releases. Once television hit the market, movie goers declined and in 1965 after 55 years of showing movies, the theater closed its door. The last film shown was “Becket” with Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole. The building was sold by Marcus Theaters to Fox Cities Realty, a corporation owned by the Gustman’s interest.\n\nToday the lot at the northeast corner of Main Avenue and Third Street is a city parking lot. Yet over the years this lot was a bustling place for many businesses. The credit of constructing the largest department store on the south side goes to August Mill, prominent Kaukauna businessmen, who built the Mill Block over 125 years ago.\n\nAugust Mill was born in Prussia and emigrated to America with his parents in 1850 at the age of 16. He settled in Sheboygan working on a farm. Several years later Mill moved to Centerville where he purchased a farm and built a grist mill with his brother. When the Civil War broke out. August enlisted with Co. E 45th WI Vol. Infantry stationed at Nashville, TN, returning to Centerville when he was discharged.\n\nAugust married Johanna Martens in 1862. The couple would raise seven sons and two daughters.\n\nSeventeen years later, in 1883, August Mill and his family came to the Village of Ledyard to engage in the mercantile business. Upon arriving in Kaukauna, he purchased a general merchandise business on Second Street where the Central Block (Pechman building) was located. Business was so prosperous that within a year he purchased the property on the corner of Third St. and Fourth Avenue (now Main Avenue) and built a two-story brick building. The structure was 50 feet in length facing Third Street and stretched 80 feet from Third Street to the alley. At that time, the area streets were mud roads and the sidewalks were boardwalks. Once the building was built the Village of Ledyard graveled the roads in the downtown area.\n\nThe second floor contained three apartments while the first floor was for businesses. The store, August Mills Dept. Store, carried a large assortment of everything in the line of dry goods, groceries and notions. This included toys, candies, mufflers, silk handkerchiefs, colored water sets, vases, parlor hanging lamps, shoes, boots, caps, cloaks and muffs.\n\nWhen August Mill opened his business he adopted a new business method at the end of the year, buying and selling strictly for cash. At the time, the butcher shops in the villages of Ledyard and Kaukauna had just adopted the cash system and reduced their prices by one to two percent per pound on their meat.\n\nMill’s credit business for the year averaged $40,000 ($1,111,111 today). At the time it was estimated that the cost of doing a credit system on the books totaled seven and a half percent. August Mills intended to lower prices on his entire stock, showing the public that he meant to give their customers the benefit of purchasing for cash.\n\nIn 1890 August Mill took into partnership his sons Arthur, Otto and Robert and the business was renamed A. Mills and Sons.\n\nAdolph and Fred (Alfred) Mill, August’s sons, opened a music store in a part of the Mill building. In July 1898 Fred and Adolph joined the Turner Dramatic Company at New London to play in the band and orchestra during the company’s summer season. They returned to Kaukauna in September 1898. In addition to operating a music store, the brothers played in the Mill and Earl Nugent Orchestra. The musicians were in demand for picnics, civic celebrations, the KHS Senior-Annual dancing party, weddings and other social functions in Kaukauna, Wrightstown, Manitowoc and throughout the area.\n\nIn August 1898, after 14 years of operation, August Mill closed his store, partially due to financial problems. An auction was held and the store inventory sold. A month later, on September 17, 1898, the Martens & Overbeck Company opened a dry goods store at the site. The store carried ladies,’ children’s and men’s wear. The store’s fall ad read “headquarters for fleece lined underwear, percales, bleached cotton and toilet soaps for 6 cents. Light flannels for 4 cents and 500 yd. spool of cotton for 3 cents.” Julius Martens, one of the owners, was the nephew of August Mill.\n\nThe Salm and Veruert (now spelled Verfurth) Boot and Shoe store opened for business in July 1895 in a building next to the South Kaukauna Post Office on Main Avenue. When the senior partner, Joseph Salm, died in 1902 Verfurth purchased the interest and moved the business to the corner site in the Mill Block when it was vacated by Martens & Overbeek in 1902.\n\nOver the years other businesses that located in the Mill Block included: The first Farmer and Merchants Bank which was housed in the building on the side by the alley. Started in 1911, the bank transacted its business in the Mill Block building for a decade and when it outgrew its present quarters, it purchased the building across the alley, then owned by the First National Bank.\n\nKaukauna Building and Loan transacted business beginning in 1911 in that portion of the Mill Block nearest the alley. Hugo Weifenbach was its secretary conducting the Building and Loan business from a desk in the back room. He held the position in addition to his duties as bank cashier. Weifenfach stayed in banking for 23 years before devoting full time to the Kaukauna Building and Loan.\n\nKaukauna Drug Company (eventually became Look Drugstore) owned by Otto Look moved into one of the store sections. Along with the drugstore, Look had a music shop at the back of the building where customers could listen to the latest Red Seal records on fashionable victrolas located in private booths. Look also sold eye glasses.\n\nThe Mill Building served as a site for an egg warehouse operated by Sidney Klurfiled of Milwaukee. His business was located in a small area between Goldin’s hot dog stand and Gantter’s store. The site was used by Klurfiled for storing eggs purchased from area farmers as well as a center for egg distribution to the area and the Chicago market.\n\nCharles Collins opened a barbershop in the space vacated by the bank. The back of Collins’ shop was used as a training site by Jack Zwick, a Kaukauna boxer, who had as his sparring partner, Gene Ditter.\n\nThe Mill Block was sold to the First National Bank in 1920 and acquired by the First Realty and Investment Company in 1921.\n\nLocated in the center of the store was Abe Goldin’s hot dog stand. He had started the business following graduation from college in 1930. He featured hot dogs, hamburgers, ice cream and pop. Goldin remained in business for one year.\n\nOn November 21,1931, the store caught on fire and the building was seriously damaged. The fire was discovered by Sylvester Esler (he eventually became fire chief) who passed by the building about 2 am. The upstairs occupants who escaped the fire were the Wynn family, William Gantter, A. R. Mill and Robert Mill. Three businesses were destroyed including Gantter Newsstand, Klurfiled Produce Company and Schelezewske barber shop. The loss was estimated at $25,000 ($409,836 today). At the time the building was owned by the First Realty Company which was a partnership including John Coppes, Julius Martens, Peter Renn and . E. Raught. The building was rebuilt with John Coppes as the the contractor in charge and Albert Luckow as the carpenter contractor.\n\nFollowing the fire in 1931 the greater part of the building was rented by the Kaukauna Times Printing Company. Other businesses located in the building until the 1944 fire included an IGA store, Stroetz Cash Food Market, Marion Hauschel Tavern, Foxgrover Barbershop, Larry’s Market and Gus Electrical Company.\n\nOn January 6, 1944, the First Realty Investment Company building was almost destroyed by fire. The fire started in the basement of the Stroetz Food Market when a kerosene stove used to heat water exploded. The fire spread through Foxgrover’s barbershop and throughout the two-story brick Veneer building. Marion Hauschel Tavern adjacent to the First Realty Company building was severely damaged.\n\nThe Stroetz family’s living quarters on the second floor and their store on the first floor were destroyed. At the time of the fire three fourths of the Mill Block was owned and occupied by the Kaukauna Times Printing Company. The building was separated from the rest of the block by a fire wall which protected the Times structure from severe fire damage. Major damage was due to water and smoke. The Printing Company still got the paper out for the day. After the 1944 fire the second floor was not rebuilt. The Kaukauna Times Printing Company remodeled and constructed an addition to the building. During the 1940s three more additions were added.\n\nDave Hartjes, owner of Hartjes Electric Co. purchased the corner formerly occupied by the Stroetz Grocery Store and Bemke Tavern building, and moved his business across the road from 109 E Third St.\n\nBeauty Shop owner Bea Weigman, whose business was located in a small shop at the back of the Kavanaugh Barbershop on East Second Street moved into the area vacated by Larry’s Market in 1952. She opened a small gift shop in the same year. After five years at this site, Bea built a shop adjacent to the family home on West 11th. Street.\n\nC. Ditter & Sons installed a central heating unit in the 1940s which was still in operation in 1981.\n\nOne June 7, 1981, fire broke out in the Mill Building occupied by the Kaukauna Times Printing Company since 1933. The fire was reported by a citizen who lived a half block away and heard an explosion and could see flames coming out of the building.\n\nIt took approximately five hours to completely extinguish the blaze. The blaze destroyed about 40 percent of the building and caused $100,000 ($275,482 today) in damages. The destroyed portion of the building was the part of the building rebuilt after the 1931 fire.\n\nThe building was not rebuilt and today the site is a city parking lot.\n\nOur house was on a hill on Dixon Street and the most exciting activity to observe through the east window in grandma’s room occurred in winter. It was delivering coal to our coal bin directly below my grandma’s bedroom. This large window afforded a year round view of the houses and stores below the hill on Dodge St. Across the tracks was the canal and power plant and in winter you could see the workers poking ice between the racks. Sometimes when there was a lot of ice on the racks, we could see my dad along with the rest of the line crew performing this task. Once the leaves were off the trees Kaukauna High School was visible and on Friday nights, we could see the football game. In fall the leaves provided beautiful colors of red, orange, yellow and brown and sometimes from grandma’s window I could see just which leaves I wanted to save between the pages of a book. Kids taking a shortcut to High School had worn a path down the hill and this made a terrific sledding hill in winter. The only bad part was that the hill ended in the back of Weyers Implement among all the old tractors and equipment. These were fun activities to observe from the window but paled in comparison to watching the coal truck deliver coal to our house.\n\nCoal delivery day was a day of great anticipation for my sisters and I, as we watched for the Appleton Coal truck to come up Dixon St. Usually, we had a few neighbor kids over to watch the event since grandma was working and would never know we were all in her bedroom.\n\nWhat made delivering coal such an event? Knowing that the coal truck was going to get stuck on the side of the hill and would need a second coal truck to pull the first truck out. Preparation for a winter coal delivery included orders from our dad that my two sisters and I needed to shovel a path down the hill around to the coal bin below grandma’s window. The path needed to be wide enough for the truck to back down the side of the hill. This was where most of the snow drifted and we hated shoveling it out. Fighting and whining didn’t lessen the job because mom would say as she always did; “you better have it done before your dad gets home” and we knew she was right.\n\nOnce my sisters and I had shoveled a path down the hill, my dad would haul out several large metal tubs of ashes from the furnace the day before delivery (We started saving the ashes about a week or so before the coal truck would be coming). Using a shovel, he started spreading the ashes and if it were windy much of the ash blew down the hill. Sometimes a bucket or two of sand from one of the sand barrels on the street was spread. My dad even put out several long planks in case the driver needed to put one under the spinning wheels of the truck.\n\nI don’t know if we always got the same driver, but I am sure each driver was positive he could make it back up the hill. We sat on the radiator by the bay window in the living room waiting for the coal truck to come up Dixon Street and then ran into grandma’s bedroom. We kept our noses pressed against the window, vying for the best viewing spot. The coal truck would pull ahead of the driveway and stop. The driver would let his helper get out and slowly walk down the hill, checking how slippery it was and how much of a curve he had to make. Once he felt everything was fine, he motioned for the driver to start backing down as he guided him. Finally, the truck was directly below the window and we would wave at the coal men who always smiled and waved back. The boring part was watching the men raise the back of the truck and shovel the coal through the window and into the coal bin. We thought that it took an awful long time to unload all the coal. Finally, the back of the truck was lowered down and the driver got into the truck.\n\nThis was it! This was what we had waited all morning for. Slowly the driver started out and at first it looked like he might make it up the hill and we were worried. He couldn’t spoil the highlight of our day. Part way up the hill we started to breathe a sigh of relief as the truck tires started spinning. Both men would then go through the usual procedure – – – putting sand and gravel under the wheels, trying to shovel away more snow, putting a board behind the back wheels, backing all the way back down and trying to gun it up the hill, but inevitably there would be a familiar knock at the front door. Covered with black soot, the driver would ask if my mother would call the office and ask them to send another truck.\n\nNow the excitement increased as we waited for the second truck to arrive. A rope or chain was attached between the trucks and finally after several tries, the truck slowly climbed the hill and was back on the road. The only reminders of our exciting activity were the tire tracks and ruts in the snow and fingerprints and nose smudges on grandma’s bedroom window.\n\nEleazer Williams claimed he was the Lost Dauphin, ruler of Native Americans, missionary and historical author. Others felt that Williams was a “professional Native American,” who cultivated political interests and persona in order to survive during a time of shrinking options for Native Americans. His adventures eventually led him to Grand Kakalin and the Kaukauna area. Williams was born in 1788 in Sault St. Louis, Quebec, the son of Thomas (Tehorakwanken), a Puritan minister and Mary Ann Williams. He was raised in the Catholic Iroquois settlement of Kahnawake along the St. Lawrence River. Educated at Dartmouth College, Eleazer trained for missionary work at Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where he worked as a missionary among the Oneida Tribes in New York.\n\nFollowing the revolutionary War, the Episcopal Church revived their missions under the leadership of Bishop John Hobart. He commissioned Eleazer\n\nWilliams to work among the Oneida as their Catechist and Lay Reader. Williams was a very energetic and dynamic individual who was a master of the Indian language and a natural orator and speaker for the Oneida Native Americans who attended his services. At the time there was increased pressure on the New York tribes to relocate from New York to the wild west, specifically Wisconsin. Williams felt that the only solution for the tribe was to move to a distant place where they could pursue traditional tribal life. Eleazer Williams developed a plan and presented it to his superiors who gave their approval. The plan included resettlement among the western tribes in Wisconsin. In 1821 Eleazer Williams was part of the delegation which visited the Fox River Valley and Green Bay. The delegation selected land on the east bank of the Fox River where the rocks and rapids impeded boat navigation farther upstream to Lake Winnebago. The site known as Grand Kakalin, was guaranteed to bring lots of traffic past them and had commercial possibilities as a transshipment point. The land was owned by the Menominee Tribe.\n\nOn August 18, 1821, Solomon, son of Hendrick Aupaumut and an Oneida delegation went to Green Bay and purchased 6.7 million acres of land beginning at the foot of the Kaukauna Rapids on the east or south side of the Fox River, extending up to Little Chute and inland 2-1/2 miles. A settlement of French Canadians, also known as Metis, north east of the Grignon property and in the Green Bay area did not approve of the Native American move. They viewed Eleazer Williams as an opportunist who wanted to create a tribal village in the Fox River Valley with him as king. Despite the protest from the French-Canadian settlers President Monroe gave his approval in 1823 to the Menominee-New York tribal agreement which granted the New York tribes 6.7 million acres for less than $4,000 ($81,633 today) in goods.\n\nIn 1822, Williams established his home in Grand Kakalin strengthening his claim to a tract of land at Little Rapids by marrying 14-year-old Madeline Jourdain, daughter of a successful blacksmith and a Menominee woman. She came with 4,800 acres of land that would become part of the Williams Tract.\n\nEleazer was ordained a deacon in 1826 and served as a deacon to the Oneidas now living in the Green Bay area. Soon the Oneidas were attending his services and looked upon Eleazer as a spiritual leader. To show their appreciation the Oneidas granted Williams 8,750 acres of land, one of the largest parcels of land on the Fox River. The land abutted on the river at Little Rapids, where there was valuable waterpower now improved by the Lindauer Pulp Mill. During 1823 this property was deeded over to Williams wife, Madeline. Eleazer built a cabin overlooking the Fox River. His home consisted of three-legged stools in place of chairs and only bunk beds, without carpets or rugs on the floor.\n\nIn 1832 the Oneidas become disenchanted with Deacon Williams accusing him of neglecting them. The Oneidas dissolved their association with Eleazer, and the Bishop of the Episcopal Church forbade Williams from representing the church in Wisconsin.\n\nBy the end of the 1830s Eleazer began to claim that he was the “Lost Dauphin” of France. Eleazer did have a chance encounter with Prince de Joinville, the third son of King Louis Phillipe. While touring American, Prince de Joinville visited the Green Bay area and Eleazer Williams was on the same steamer. Eventually Williams became an open pretender, tricked his mother into signing an affidavit that he was an adopted son and started signing his writings “Louis Dauphin.”\n\nWilliams was an author who published many books. Some question whether all Williams facts are true or were the authors beliefs. Published works included a spelling book in Iroquois, a Mohawk or Iroquois translation of The Book of Common Prayer, Prayers for Families and for Particular Persons translated into the language of six Iroquois\n\nNations and The Salvation of Sinners through the Riches of Divine Grace.\n\nEleazer Williams owned the largest collection of books at that time in the west. In later years he was found to be living in destitute conditions. He took armfuls of his books and walked from Kaukauna to Green Bay and sold the books to obtain money for households’ expenses.\n\nWilliams died alone in poverty and obscurity on the reservation at St. Regis and was buried at St. James Cemetery in Hogansburg, New York on August 28, 1858. In 1947 his remains and tombstone were moved to Holy Apostles Cemetery in Oneida, Wisconsin. His tombstone at Oneida indicates that he was a Freemason.\n\nIn later years Charles Stribley, head of office management and on the board of directors at Thilmany Mill, visited Eleazer Williams’ home where he photographed the cabin and surrounding area. One of Charles’s photo of the cabin was used in a book by a Menasha writer. Stribley purchased 14 books from Josephine Williams Phillips. Josephine’s mother, Nanny, was a young American Native adopted by Eleazer and his wife. Nanny Williams fell heir to their property near Little Rapids and she lived there with her daughter Josephine until her death. Josephine married Josiah Phillips and raised a daughter and son. Except for one year that she spent with her son in California, Josephine lived on the family land until her death in 1924. She was buried in South Lawrence Cemetery in De Pere.\n\nEleazer Williams’ plot of 19 acres of land at his home was designated Lost Dauphin Park by the State of Wisconsin. It was later taken off the list of state parks and the house was burned. It remains designated as Lost Dauphin Park with the land remaining state owned. The rest of the land was sold.\n\nThe Kaukauna Fire Department is celebrating 100 years on Saturday, October 1. I had the good fortune to meet with the firefighters over a two year period while I was drafting the book on the history of the fire department. The entire department went out of their way to provide the information I asked for and more. We shared many a good laugh over some stories which I did not include in my book. Following is a short version of how the fire department continued to advance to the department the city has today, one which provides us with the highest level of emergency and medical care in the area.\n\nIn 1922 the City disbanded the privately owned volunteer fire companies on the south and north side and established a professional municipal fire department. Eight full-time firemen were hired and split into two shifts. The men worked 24 hours on and 24 hours off with no vacation or holidays. Their first raise was in 1926.\n\nThe department was located in the new municipal building at the bottom of the Lawe Street Bridge.\n\nThe first formal education and training occurred In 1945 when the firemen attended formal classes at the Kaukauna Vocational School once a week for 11 weeks. Topics included firefighting techniques, mechanical procedures for minor repairs needed on the fire trucks and a basic Red Cross First Aid Course.\n\nThe Central Labor Union started a campaign to raise $3,012 ($41,833 today) to purchase an\n\nambulance. Donors’ names were printed weekly in the Kaukauna Times. The campaign fell $200 ($2,778 today) short and the city council voted to donate the last $200. Initially the ambulance was kept at Gustman’s Chevrolet Garage. If an ambulance was needed, a call was made to the Kaukauna Fire Department. The fire department called Art Gustman or A. Kronforst who answered the call and drove the ambulance or called for additional drivers.\n\nThe 1950s remains the deadliest fire period in the history of the fire department. Besides numerous minor fires and the loss of six children, a large number of businesses burned. The most famous was Hotel Kaukauna along with the S & B Bowling Alley, Gambles Store, Avenue Bar and Pechmans, Fox River Veneer Co. (located in the general area of the current fire department), Fargo’s Furniture Store, Nitingale Ballroom, Gordon Clothing and Badger Tissue warehouse.\n\nDuring the 1960s the city council finally gave approval for temporary help to fill in for firefighters on vacation. Yes, college students were hired to replace full time firefighters while firefighters were on vacation.\n\nThe 1970s was a decade of politics, blood, sweat and tears. I was working as a nursing instructor in the Education and Training Department when I was asked to help coordinate and teach the first EMT/Paramedic course in the area with Dr. Loescher and Dr. Moore. Forty-four Outagamie County emergency workers signed up for the course. Six were Kaukauna firefighters from Kaukauna and included Everett Bovee, Joe Gasper, James Kiffe, Jerry Kobussen, Bruce Mathis and Wayne Vanevenhoven.\n\nThus started an uphill battle to keep the firefighters in the class and continue with the paramedic training. Opponents claimed that the additional equipment and radios needed were not budgeted for, the men were not hired to perform advanced procedures that even RNs did not perform, you couldn’t take someone with no medical training and expect them to perform life-saving measures. Who would replace the men when they were attending classes, what if every firefighter doesn’t want to train to become a paramedic? The city had a hospital and two other hospitals were close by. How would this affect staffing? Every day presented a new challenge.\n\nBruce Mathis remarked that paramedic status would not have happened without the help of other members of the fire department who\n\noften sacrificed days off to come in and work several hours while six firefighters went through training. When it was impossible to schedule the men off for classes, classes were conducted at the fire department.\n\nThe Kaukauna Education Association strongly supported the need for paramedics and felt strongly the training would provide a higher level of emergency care for the city and spear headed a campaign to raise $7,777 for IV equipment, updated radios and other equipment needed. When more equipment needs arose, the KEA raised more money.\n\nThe Kaukauna Community Health Associates donated $1,600 to the Kaukauna Fire Department to purchase two trauma bags and two pulse oximeters. Many other organizations and individuals donated money for needed equipment and training.\n\nThe six Kaukauna firefighters completed 25 sessions dealing with emergencies, heart attacks, practice divided between St. Elizabeth Hospital, Appleton Medical Center and Outagamie County Center in the emergency room, psychiatric unit, ICU, orthopedic, surgical and medical units. The men completed a self-study unit from the American Journal of Nursing offered to RNs at St. Elizabeth Hospital. This was the first and last class to practice inserting naso-gastric tubes down each other.\n\nIn December 1979 Kaukauna, a city of 12,000, became the smallest city in Wisconsin with a municipally operated paramedic ambulance service.\n\nThe 1990s saw a shift toward increased programs for the public on fire prevention and handling emergencies. It was noted that for $85 of their taxes city residents received a full-time professional fire-fighting force, an excellent ambulance service and an emergency/rescue team 24/7.\n\n2007 saw the first female firefighter hired.\n\nToday firefighting certification and paramedic certification are required when applying for a position within the department.\n\nToday a large portion of training and education is done at the fire department.\n\nThroughout history firemen were noted for the excellent meals they prepared without any cost to the department. Kaukauna Fire Department was no exception. The public was always invited to the special meals. Owen Roberts in the 1930s was known for his booyah. The chicken and beef were supplied by Leherer’s Meat Market. The firefighters provided all the rest of the ingredients. Owens would made at least six gallons of booyah at a time.\n\nThe firefighters were noted for their tasty wild game meals. Fireman Carl Engerson and his brother Police Officer Harold Engerson and Smokey (Melvin Jerry) Mainville from the Electric Dept. line crew provided deer and small wild game. City officials and many workers eagerly looked forward to these meals.\n\nIn the 1940s-50s the fire department was noted for their turtle soup made by firefighter Mark Kilgas (Muskrat Mark). He caught the snapping turtles along the river. The hose tower for hanging and drying the fire hoses was used for hanging snapping turtles with their heads cut off to bleed out.\n\nTo quote former Fire Chief Paul Hirte, when I asked him in 2014 where the department will be in the future, he said, “We are positioned with dedicated firefighters,\n\nparamedics and chief officers who provide our community with progressive fire and EMS operations, hazardous materials response, special rescue operations and prevention programming making KFD a true full-service agency.\n\nAn appropriate quote from Mark Strand states “The future is always beginning now.” As the Kaukauna Fire Department heads into the next 100 years, Kaukauna is very fortunate to have Chief Jake Carrel leading the way. When asked where he sees the department in the next several years, Chief Carrel replied: “Firefighting, fire prevention and EMS remain a top priority, but our firefighters and paramedics are facing many new challenges and hazards that most of us were not taught in the fire academy. This includes active shooter response and a much more active role with law enforcement, pandemic response including administering vaccines and playing a more active role in the public healthcare system. Our Kaukauna firefighters have a strong commitment to public service and responded to these new challenges with skill and professionalism.”\n\nProhibition in Wisconsin started on January 17, 1920, and ended on December 5, 1933, with the ratification of the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment ended the long struggle between those in favor of prohibition, known as “drys” and those who relished their beer, known as “wets.” Wisconsin’s first effort at prohibition occurred in 1863 when the people voted to prohibit the sale of liquor. This law was vetoed by Governor Barstow.\n\nThe Temperance movement tried to sway Wisconsinite’s to support prohibition, but never succeeded. As far back as 1906 antiprohibition groups passed through Kaukauna holding rallies. One rally was held in the Epworth home and according to the Kaukauna Times the hall was filled to hear sermons on the evils of alcohol. Other antiprohibition groups passed through the city pitching a large tent and publicizing their sermons. The tents were usually filled with citizens. During the early 1900s there were approximately 20 saloons in Kaukauna patronized by much larger crowds than the crowds attending prohibition rallies.\n\nMany factors played into the majority of citizens against prohibition. A large German population, the number of breweries, especially in Milwaukee and in Outagamie County and Catholic Bishop Sebastian Messmer. In 1918 Pope Leo XIII appointed Bishop Messmer of the Green Bay Diocese, archbishop of Milwaukee where he banned antiprohibition sermons and speeches in Catholic schools, churches or halls.\n\nIn 1921 Chief R. H. Mc Carty received a copy of the new Prohibition Law and informed the citizens by publishing the law in the Kaukauna Times. “ No liquor shall be sold or kept for human consumption on a premise without a license. In rooms covered by a license all windows and doors must be unobstructed by screens, blinds, paint or other articles so that there is a clean view of who is in the room.” The license cost between $50 and $100 ($694 and $1,389 today). Owners who did not have a license could be fined. Vehicles used for transporting alcohol could be seized and sold. Anyone giving away or carrying liquor for sale would be arrested and fined. “Hip liquor,” (carrying alcohol on a person’s body) was not permitted.\n\nIt was never illegal to drink alcohol during Prohibition. The 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act, the legal measure that included the instructions for enforcing Prohibition, never barred the consumption of alcohol – – just making it, selling it and shipping it for mass production and consumption was prohibited. The Volstead Act defined specifically what was illegal. This included beer, wine and other types of liquor if the content of alcohol in those beverages exceeded one-half of one percent.\n\nDuring prohibition, many breweries began to make “near beer” while others tried to make soda, ice cream and cheese. Many breweries went bankrupt, while organized crime took over the black market distribution. Evidence strongly suggests that several local residents sold liquor to organized crime members from Milwaukee and Chicago.\n\nPolitical parties and religion pitted families against those for and those against\n\nprohibition. In 1921 Bishop Paul Rhode of the Green Bay Diocese (1915-1945) came out in support of prohibition. Returning home from a visit to his home country of Poland he compared the workers of Poland where alcohol flowed freely to the workers in American where alcohol was prohibited. Based on first hand observation he noted that “the American is a man with a clear brain. He arises on a Monday morning and goes to his work with a clear conscience and clean mind. He does his work cheerfully and ef"
