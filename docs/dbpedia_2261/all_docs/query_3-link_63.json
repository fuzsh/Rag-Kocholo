        "text": "The necessity of adopting or redefining illiberal measures—such as torture, internment, or targeted-killings of terrorists—to protect states places burdens on the meaning of liberalism around the world. After 1969, liberal intellectual responses to the so-called Troubles in Northern Ireland identified two conflicted groups of Irish liberals. Then academic and politician Conor Cruise O'Brien attempted to reduce responses to the crisis to the choice between supporting the state and condoning terrorism. “Consenting liberals” compromised professional practices in the law, journalism, broadcasting, and academia to support the state's counterinsurgency. Alternatively, “dissenting liberals” defended their “neutrality” alongside the freedom to criticize the counterinsurgency. Justifying infringements on individual freedoms, O'Brien and others said the democratic state was imperiled. But, anomalously, freedoms were sacrificed in defense of the Irish state, which in security terms did little to defend itself. Nevertheless, the counterinsurgency became an organizing principle in intellectual life, and over forty years colored self-perceptions of Irish society, past and present.\n\n1 Ignatieff, Michael, The Lesser Evil (Edinburgh, 2005)Google Scholar; Greenslade, Roy, foreword to Political Censorship and the Democratic State: The Irish Broadcasting Ban, ed.

The aim of the documents project is stated to be “to make available . . . to people who may not be in a position to easily consult the National Archives, documents which are considered important or useful for an understanding of Irish foreign policy” (ibid., ix.).

The enlistment in this unseemly chorus of Regan's voice . . . adds credibility to points hitherto dismissible, for the most part, as the fantasies of cranks.” David Fitzpatrick, “Dr Regan and Mr Snide,” History Ireland 20, no. 3 (May–June 2012): 12–13.\n\n183 Columnist John Waters writes: “Many of us [journalists] were convinced by the need to pull the historical rug from under the Provos and were therefore acquiescent in the rewriting of the past.” Irish Times, 10 April 2006."
