        "text": "Read Your Way Around the World is a series exploring the globe through books.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Dublin is its relationship with words. History is embedded deep in language here. A lot of Dublin communities are tight-knit, with roots that go back centuries, so the dialect is sprinkled with words and phrases that have been passed down over the generations, even after they’ve vanished everywhere else. In Dublin, “my girlfriend” is still “me mot,” from the Victorian English “mort” for “woman” — long gone out of use in England, but still alive here. And back in the 16th century, “child” meant specifically a girl child; it’s been gender-neutral almost everywhere for hundreds of years, but within the last decade, when I had my second baby, older Dublin people still asked me “Is it a boy or a child?”\n\nEven with so much ingrained history, Dublin’s language is the opposite of stagnant. Virtuosity and creativity with language aren’t seen as reserved for any kind of elite. They’re everyone’s birthright, and plenty of the most lyrical or wittiest or most original phrases aren’t carefully crafted by authors, but tossed into pub conversations by people who would never consider themselves to be literary types. And that creative eloquence isn’t a rarefied thing, to be treated with reverence; it’s cheerfully mixed in with every flavor of mundanity and vulgarity. If you love words, Dublin is a good place to be.\n\nWhat should I read before I pack my bags?\n\n“The Commitments,” by Roddy Doyle. I can’t think of another book that would do as great a job of putting the rhythms of Dublin into your head. Dublin talks fast, it snaps banter back and forth, it’s funny and cutting and profane, and it has the best insults (I’ve heard people called everything from a muppet to a golf ball to “that bleedin’ gazebo,” and those are just the ones fit for print). If your ear isn’t tuned in, you can miss the best bits. “The Commitments” will take you halfway there before you ever get on the plane.\n\nWhat books should I bring along with me?\n\nFlann O’Brien’s “At Swim-Two-Birds,” a meta-novel (written under a pseudonym by Brian O’Nolan) about a Dublin student who spends his time lazing around, drinking and writing — except his characters won’t do what they’re told, and his stories keep getting mixed up with each other. It’s one of the great classics of Irish literature: gleefully surreal and chaotic, bursting with the author’s love for Irish mythology, and a lot of fun.\n\nIf I have no time for day trips, what books could take me there instead?\n\nOne of my favorite Irish books is “The Spinning Heart,” by Donal Ryan. The novel comprises a series of intertwined vignettes from the perspectives of various people living in a small town in western Ireland during the aftermath of the Celtic Tiger crash. It’s moving, atmospheric and beautiful, and it does a wonderful job of capturing both the time and the intricate, inescapable ways in which small-town lives are interwoven.\n\nFor a side of Cork that you probably wouldn’t want to visit in real life, go for Lisa McInerney’s dark, superbly written “The Glorious Heresies,” about a handful of very different people whose lives become entangled when a gangster’s mother bludgeons an intruder to death with a holy statue. If you want glimpses into other parts of the country in different eras, Cora Harrison’s mystery series are fun, satisfying, Brother-Cadfael-style reads. “The Burren Mysteries” are set in 16th-century West Ireland, where Mara is an investigating judge in Ireland’s old Brehon law system. The “Reverend Mother” mysteries are set in the 1920s, against the backdrop of Ireland’s Civil War, with Reverend Mother Aquinas using her knowledge of every level of Cork’s intricate social hierarchy to solve murders. Harrison is great on historical detail and neat plotting.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
