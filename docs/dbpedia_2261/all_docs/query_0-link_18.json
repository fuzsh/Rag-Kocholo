Arrived Melbourne 1866, aged 26 years of age, on \"Red Jacket\" from Liverpool. According to the shipping records, he travelled alone. He married on 4 November 1870 at Branxholme, Victoria Australia, Christina McPherson born 1844, Argylesgire, Scotland (daughter of Donald McPherson, lawyer, and Flora McInnes). Flora is the daughter of Peter McInnes and Ann McCallum; and Ann is the daughter of Gilbert McCallum and Margaret Campbell, whose family history (the Campbell's) has been traced back to the mid 1600s.\n\nChristina died 1928, Merino, Western Victoria. Joseph died in 1873.\n\nThe McPherson family emigrated to Australia, when Christina was 8 years of age.\n\nNOTE: ages on shipping records & on birth/marriage certificates vary, hence the apparent error of dates above.\n\nThe children of Joseph Richard O'Brien and Christina McPherson and their families are listed below. However, it might seem a bit confusing as to who belongs to who, so an outline is provided here:"
