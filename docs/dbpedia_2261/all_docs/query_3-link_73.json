Sometimes dropping in a bit of harmonica for good measure. All the while building a sound and playing style that is deceptively larger than it seems. In 2010, he won a best blues award for his song “Seen My Baby” at the New Mexico Music Awards and another in 2013 for “End of My Rope.” Ayon’s influences are Junior Kimbrough, R.L.

The afternoon begins with the Mississippi Acoustic Trio, Dubuque’s longest running musical group, playing bluegrass, folk, Americana, and country. The Mud Lake Music Society in partnership with the Friends of Dubuque County Conservation announce the return of the Mud Lake Bluegrass Sundays series. Promoted by The Dubuque County Conservation Board, this popular event draws music performers from all around the country and began as an effort to bring bluegrass music to an outdoor setting by the Mississippi River at Mud Lake Park. With a focus on audience involvement, each event kicks off with the Pickers Pick-nic starting at noon and going until 2 p.m. It’s the perfect setting to meet and play with other aspiring pickers. Guest instructors help with tuning, answer questions, and then organize the jam sessions. Then at 2 p.m., the main stage fires up with a regional opening act followed by a national touring act at 3:30 p.m., entertaining until approximately 6 p.m. Asking attendees only for freewill donations, the society’s goal is to raise enough money to cover costs and retain a small fund to continue Mud Lake Bluegrass Sundays the next year. Camping spaces are available at Mud Lake Park, along with food concessions and special Mud Lake Bluegrass souvenirs (shirts, instrument, and raffles). No alcohol is served, but visitors may bring their own coolers, and it is recommended that people bring lawn chairs. People are also encouraged to bring their own instruments and participate in the free music clinics prior to main stage acts.

She is a native Dubuquer who moved back in 2019 and now works as an architectural historian and preservation consultant. Tricia has a Master of Science in Historic Preservation from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. DCHPC was created by resolution of the Dubuque County Board of Supervisors in November 1987.

He explains why the majority of serial killers are either psychopaths or sociopaths, how the two differ, and the powerful influences of nature and nurture on the development of fledgling serial killers. Dr. Bonn reveals that every serial killer is compelled by a unique fantasy need and he also explains how/why serial killers are able to successfully avoid apprehension, blend into a crowd and become invisible. Dr. Bonn is a best selling author, professor, public speaker, and he has interacted with such notorious serial killers as Dennis Rader (“Bind, Torture, Kill”) and David Berkowitz (“Son of Sam”). He shares shocking tales from his actual experiences with these killers. Dr. Bonn also developed a profile of the unknown “Long Island Serial Killer” in 2011 that matches the alleged perpetrator, Rex Heuermann, perfectly.
