        "text": "Born in Los Angeles, CA, in the mid-80s, Brien's culinary journey began at 13 in his motherâ€™s kitchen in Redding, CA. He fondly remembers turning fresh strawberries into a puree by hand, adding sugar and cinnamon to create a delicious strawberry sauce. This early experience sparked his love for creating food.\n\nIn August 2017, Brien was named the 14th Best Home Cook in America on Season 8 of FOX's MasterChef with Gordon Ramsay. Judged by Celebrity Chefs Christina Tosi, Aaron Sanchez, and Gordon Ramsay, Brien stood out by winning several challenges and received letters of recommendation from each of the judges.\n\nAfter MasterChef, Brien worked in various kitchens and as a private chef. In January 2018, he pursued formal training at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in Napa Valley, CA. There, he refined his culinary skills, studied fine wine, and connected with many renowned chefs.\n\nAfter culinary school, Brien worked in several Napa Valley kitchens and wineries, deepening his appreciation for California-inspired French cuisine. He then teamed up with his brother Zach to help build his media company, Active NorCal, as Business Development Manager. Together, they launched Eating NorCal, a series promoting local Northern California restaurants. Eating NorCal showcases food and drink through pictures, videos, and articles on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\nTo celebrate MasterChef's 10th season, Brien became the first EatWith MasterChef Ambassador. In this role, he posts weekly videos about EatWith opportunities and hosts private dinners, allowing him to stay active in the kitchen.\n\nBrien and Zach also started the Talking NorCal Podcast, the official podcast of Active NorCal. They discuss weekly Northern California stories, interview leading outdoor enthusiasts, and share their adventures. The podcast is available on all major platforms, and full video episodes can be found on their YouTube page.\n\nIn November 2018, Brien began working at Clif Family Winery in the Napa Valley, progressing from Tasting Room Host to Virtual Experience & Events Manager. He hosted Virtual Wine Tastings, coordinated winery events, and contributes to marketing and social media efforts all while increasing his knowledge of fine wine. Brien left the wine industry in 2023 to pursue his next adventure.\n\nIn 2022, it was announced that MasterChef Season 12 would be a \"Back To Win\" season featuring previous contestants. Brien was selected as a Top 40 MasterChef competitor and competed in the early part of this \"All-Star\" season.\n\nIn January 2024, Brien and Zach re-launched Active NorCal Magazine after a seven-year hiatus. They worked to bring back the familiar magazine with a new look and updated content. Brien has acted as Business Development Manager as well as Food Editor for this revamped magazine. Subscribers and advertisers have loved the first few issues since the re-launch, continuing the positive momentum. Active NorCal Magazine is featured on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, where it showcases engaging content and connects with its audience.\n\nSince leaving the wine industry to pursue his love for the kitchen in 2023, Brien has worked as a private chef and consultant across the country. He creates custom menus for clients with specific nutrition and dietary needs, acts as a recipe and cookbook consultant, and even serves as an event planner and project manager. Brien continues to develop his skills and leadership with every new opportunity."
