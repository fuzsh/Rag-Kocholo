Over the years and despite thousands of interviews, Conan has never made a real and lasting friendship with any of his celebrity guests. So, he started a podcast to do just that.\n  Deeper, unboundedly playful, and free from FCC regulations, Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend is a weekly opportunity for Conan to hang out with the people he enjoys most and perhaps find some real friendship along the way.",

        "text": "Conan O'Brien was born in Brookline, Massachusetts and started his path in comedy when he served twice as the president of The Harvard Lampoon. Conan went on to become a writer and producer on several television shows, including \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" until 1993, when NBC tapped him to take over as host of \"Late Night.\" Since then, he's won four Emmy Awards, six Writers Guild Awards, and the People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Television Host.\" Conan has hosted two Emmy Awards, the MTV Movie Awards, and performed at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner for two presidents. In 2010, his live comedy tour was the subject of the documentary “Conan O'Brien Can’t Stop,” and led to a second multi-city stand-up tour in 2018. In 2015, Conan became the longest-working current late-night talk show host in the U. S., celebrating 25 years in 2018. His show, “CONAN,” recently ended after 10 years on TBS. His Emmy Award-winning “Conan Without Borders” series has visited 13 countries and his podcast “Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend” currently has over 230 million downloads since it launched in 2018. Between his production company, Conaco, and leading his Emmy-winning digital brand, Team Coco, he’s successfully expanded into branded content, podcasting, mobile gaming, pay TV, and live comedy tours.\n\nSona Movsesian started her career in TV as an NBC Page and went on to become the Events & Operations Coordinator for the publicity department. She started working for Conan O'Brien as his executive assistant in 2009 when he moved to Los Angeles to take over hosting duties for \"The Tonight Show.” In 2018, she joined Conan on his podcast \"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend\" and met her new friend Matt Gourley. She was born in Los Angeles and continues to live there with her husband Tak, their puppy Oki, and twins Mikey and Charlie.\n\nFirst of all, Matt Gourley does some podcasts. For starters, he's the creator of the \"I Was There Too\" podcast and the co-creator of the \"Superego,\" \"James Bonding,\" \"Pistol Shrimps Radio,\" \"The Complete Man,\" and \"In Voorhees/Myers We Trust\" podcasts as well as sidekick to Andy Daly on \"The Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project\" and producer of \"Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend.” There are more, but let’s stop talking about podcasts. He’s also been seen acting on \"Community,\" \"Kidding,\" \"Comedy Bang! Bang!,\" \"Blindspot,\" ''Another Period,\" \"Adventure Time,\" and has been featured on Comedy Central’s \"Drunk History,\" slurring his way through thoughtful retellings of Watergate, the Alamo, and the life of Wernher von Braun. He was also the long-time spokesperson for Volkswagen, but let’s not talk about that either. In his down time though, Matt plays music with his band Townland and works on design and renovation projects at home where he lives with his wife Amanda Lund and their huge cat, Margaux The Fat Guy."
