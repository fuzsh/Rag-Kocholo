        "text": "General President\n\nSean M. O’Brien is a fourth generation Teamster and the General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He joined Teamsters Local 25 in Charlestown, Mass. at the age of 18 working in the rigging industry as a heavy-equipment driver in the Greater Boston area. O’Brien became a business agent in 1999 and, in 2006, the youngest President in Local 25’s 128-year history. Under his leadership, Local 25’s membership increased by more than 30 percent. In 2011, he was elected Eastern Region Vice President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\nO’Brien has worked tirelessly to increase the membership of the Teamsters, both locally and nationally, and has been successful in organizing workers and negotiating strong contracts in a variety of diverse industries.\n\nAs Teamsters General President, O’Brien is committed to winning and defending strong national contracts, organizing new members, and aggressively taking on employers. O’Brien is focused on mobilizing rank-and-file Teamsters through education and increased engagement—traveling extensively to visit with members at worksites throughout the country.\n\nO’Brien also serves as a member of the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) Board of Directors and is Co-Chairman and Trustee of the New England Teamsters Pension Fund\n\nIn addition to fighting for workers, O’Brien has helped raise millions of dollars for charitable causes, including Local 25’s signature event, “Light Up the Night,” an annual gala to raise money for children with autism.\n\nO’Brien is the proud father of two sons, Sean Jr. and Joseph."
