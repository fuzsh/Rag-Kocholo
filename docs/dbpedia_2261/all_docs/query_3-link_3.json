        "text": "Tim O’Brien (born October 1, 1946, Austin, Minnesota, U.S.) is an American novelist noted for his writings about American soldiers in the Vietnam War.\n\nAfter studying political science at Macalester College, St. Paul, Minnesota (B.A., 1968), O’Brien fought in Vietnam. When he returned to the United States, he studied intermittently at Harvard University and worked for the Washington Post (1971–74) as an intern and reporter. He collected his newspaper and magazine articles about his war experiences in his first book, If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home (1973). By turns meditative and brutally realistic, it was praised for its honest portrayal of a soldier’s emotions.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 19 Things to Know About the Vietnam War\n\nThe Vietnam War is present in many of O’Brien’s novels. One of the two protagonists in Northern Lights (1975) is a wounded war hero. Set in an isolated, snow-covered part of Minnesota during a disastrous cross-country ski trip, the novel is an examination of courage. Going After Cacciato (1978), which won a National Book Award, follows both a soldier who abandons his platoon in Vietnam to try to walk to Paris and a fellow infantryman who escapes the war’s horrors by inventing elaborate fantasies about his journey. In The Things They Carried (1990), a fictional narrator named Tim O’Brien begins his memoir with a description of the items that the members of his platoon took to war, which range from physical objects, such as weapons and love letters, to emotions of terror and homesickness. While a man’s lifelong fear of dying from a nuclear bombing is the subject of The Nuclear Age (1981), In the Lake of the Woods (1994) returns to the subject of the experiences and effects of the Vietnam War. O’Brien’s writing took a new turn with publication of Tomcat in Love (1999), a nuanced comic novel about the search for love, and July, July (2002), whose disillusioned characters gather for a college class reunion. In the nonfiction Dad’s Maybe Book (2019) O’Brien combined memoir with a discussion of parenting, including advice to his sons.\n\nO’Brien was the recipient of various honours, including the Pritzker Military Library Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing (2013)."
