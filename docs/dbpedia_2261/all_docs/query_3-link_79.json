        "text": "Begob, and the truth would not be played false were a frank man to say that Flann O’Brien, born Brian O’Nolan in Strabane, Ulster, in 1911, and known as Myles na gCopaleen to the readers of his long-standing column “Cruiskeen Lawn” in the Irish Times, when acting as a novelist proffered a mixed bag of blessings and their opposite. Such a pained reflection has been given rise to by a thorough if at intervals dozy reading of “The Complete Novels” by the above-named, as published by Everyman’s Library in its fine format, not less than eight hundred pages (counting the front matter) of wee Bembo type bound in glorious red covers with a sewn-in bookmark of golden fabric ($25). On the jacket the author is obscured by his dark hat and his black-rimmed glasses and his own hand at his mouth, and, to be sure, Flann/Brian/Myles, where many an author not only rejoices in his face on his jacket but sets his personal facts in the forefront of his prose, engaged in a significant effort of self-concealment, of pseudonymity lurking behind a prose greatly melodious and garrulous in its confident manner. The front flap of the same jacket states him to be “along with Joyce and Beckett . . . part of the holy trinity of modern Irish literature,” which rings strangely of one who disparaged the Holy Trinity, discounting with considerable scholarly fury in his final novel, “The Dalkey Archive,” the very notion of the Holy Ghost, as having been heedlessly foisted upon the Christian Creed by the Council of Alexandria in the year 362. The man was ingenious and learned like Jim Joyce and like Sam Beckett gave the reader a sweet dose of hopelessness but unlike either of these worthies did not arrive at what we might call artistic resolution. His novels begin with a swoop and a song but end in an uncomfortable murk and with an air of impatience.\n\nThe first, “At Swim-Two-Birds” (1939), is the best known and the most rigorously confusing—confusing even the compendium’s introducer, Keith Donohue, who describes it as “a mock-heroic novel about a man named Orlick Trellis,” when in fact Orlick is the relatively incidental son of Dermot Trellis, a bedridden author introduced, on page 31, as “writing a book on sin and the wages attaching thereto.” In equipping himself for this mighty task he “has bought a ream of ruled foolscap” and “is compelling all his characters to live with him in the Red Swan Hotel so that he can keep an eye on them.” Dermot Trellis is enough captivated by the beauty of Sheila Lamont, a character he has invented to illustrate female virtue, “that he so far forgets himself as to assault her himself.” Not only assaults: he impregnates her. Their child is Orlick, who, after an education in the home of the Pooka MacPhellimey—one of several figures from Irish legend that have materialized in the narrative—becomes a writer himself, coached by three idlers called Shanahan, Furriskey, and Antony Lamont, the abused woman’s brother, all of them intent upon indicting and punishing, by way of Orlick’s fledgling fiction, his father’s perfidy. The elder Trellis is kept immobilized in his bed by surreptitiously drug-induced sleep while his characters, including a number of American cowboys recruited from the novels of one William Tracy, run wild. At least, that’s what I think is happening. The manuscript keeps re-starting itself, repeating whole paragraphs at a time, and the only segments of Irish life that savor of actual experience are the unnamed narrator’s passing conversations with his sententious uncle and with his flippant acquaintances at University College, Dublin. It is this unnamed narrator, easily confused with the young Flann O’Brien, who is composing this many-levelled travesty of a novel. Graham Greene called “At Swim-Two-Birds” “one of the best books of our century. A book in a thousand . . . in the line of Ulysses and Tristram Shandy.” The Chicago Tribune said, more cagily, that it is “of such staggering originality that it baffles description and very nearly beggars our sense of delight.” All of O’Brien’s novels of nearly beggared delight convey what Donohue calls his “disdain for certain, clear meaning and interpretation.”\n\nDisdainful though it is, “At Swim-Two-Birds” can be wonderfully written, with an offhand lilt that twists the drab ordinary into a peculiar precision:\n\nOn wet days there would be an unpleasant odour of dampness, an aroma of overcoats dried by body-heat.\n\nNow listen, said Shanahan clearing the way with small coughs.\n\nIt was an early-morning street, its quiet distances still small secrets shared by night with day.\n\nLike the overbearing master of the Dublin quotidian, James Joyce, O’Brien is not afraid to bore the reader. Pages go by in alcoholic discussion of the relative merits of various musical instruments (“The fiddle is the man, said Shanahan”) and the elusive quality of “kangaroolity.” A mock-heroic fustian inflates the prose:\n\nA learning and an erudition boundless in its universality, an affection phenomenal in its intensity and a quiet sympathy with the innumerable little failings of our common humanity—these were the sterling qualities that made Mr John Furriskey a man among men and endeared him to the world and his wife.\n\nIf this tone was inspired by the many mock-heroic passages in “Ulysses,” O’Brien’s impudent introduction of Finn MacCool, the Pooka MacPhellimey, and the invisible Good Fairy (“I am like a point in Euclid, explained the Good Fairy, position but no magnitude, you know”) into the cast of “At Swim-Two-Birds” may allude to the background of archaic myth in “Finnegans Wake,” which was also published in 1939 but, starting in 1924, was heralded by advance excerpts, under the title “Work in Progress,” in various French and English-language publications, and was surely known to O’Brien. Joyce cast a heavy shadow on the younger writer’s mind, being often invoked in O’Brien’s newspaper column and emerging as a character in his last novel.\n\nO’Brien’s next novel, “The Third Policeman,” widely regarded as his best, was rejected, in 1940, by his publisher, Longmans, Green & Co., and consigned to a drawer, where it waited until the year after the author’s death, in 1966, for its publication. Read in sequence, as following hard upon “At Swim-Two-Birds,” it can be appreciated as equally fantastic and original but more coherent, with a story line that rouses suspense and comes, in irregular fashion, full circle. In its heterodox way, it tells a tale of Hell and of a murderer’s proper punishment. “The Complete Novels” includes a diffidently exuberant letter that O’Brien wrote to William Saroyan, another free literary spirit of the time:\n\nWhen you get to the end of this book you realize that my hero or main character (he’s a heel and a killer) has been dead throughout the book and that all the queer ghastly things which have been happening to him are happening in a sort of hell which he earned for the killing. . . . I think the idea of a man being dead all the time is pretty new. When you are writing about the world of the dead—and the damned—where none of the rules and laws (not even the law of gravity) holds good, there is any amount of scope for back-chat and funny cracks.\n\nHis narrator, again nameless, is persuaded, by the deceiving scoundrel John Divney, to commit robbery and murder so gradually (“Three further months passed before I could bring myself to agree to the proposal and three months more before I openly admitted to Divney that my misgivings were at an end”), and so ingenuously accepts the consequent terrors and perils, that he doesn’t seem a heel at all; he seems as innocent as Alice in Wonderland or one of Kafka’s heroes, gamely trying to puzzle through a bizarre and bewildering world. We identify with him, to a degree rarely permitted by O’Brien, who, even in his rambling, personal daily column, maintained a certain brusque distance from the reader. (Toward the end of “The Dalkey Archive,” a character delivers what feels like the author’s own credo of authorship: “One must write outside oneself. I’m fed up with writers who put a fictional gloss over their own squabbles and troubles. It’s a form of conceit, and usually it’s very tedious.”)\n\nThe protagonist of “The Third Policeman” occupies the stage continuously, without the subplots and compounded fictions of “At Swim-Two-Birds.” His voice is confiding, making us privy to his musings as he moves through a rural landscape redolent of a prehistoric past:\n\nThe road was narrow, white, old, hard and scarred with shadow. It ran away westwards in the mist of the early morning, running cunningly through the little hills and going to some trouble to visit tiny towns which were not, strictly speaking, on its way. It was possibly one of the oldest roads in the world. I found it hard to think of a time when there was no road there because the trees and the tall hills and the fine views of bogland had been arranged by wise hands for the pleasing picture they made when looked at from the road. Without a road to have them looked at from they would have a somewhat aimless if not a futile aspect.\n\nFrom this recurrent image of a road he drops into evoking the thought of his intellectual idol, the “physicist, ballistician, philosopher and psychologist” called de Selby. A number of footnotes quoting the de Selby scholars Le Fournier, Hatchjaw, Bassett, Kraus, Le Clerque, and Henderson reveal their subject to have been less a savant than an idiot, who fell asleep in meetings of learned societies and even “when walking in crowded thoroughfares,” who could not distinguish men from women, who believed that night comes because of the day’s accretions of dirty air, and who left behind a closely hand-written two-thousand-page Codex of which not one word is legible. De Selby is a vivid comic invention, perpetrated by O’Brien with pedantic gusto, and the narrator’s loyalty to this preposterous wizard adds to his sympathetic qualities. [#unhandled_cartoon]\n\nPolicemen—courteous, overweight, and menacing—and bicycles figure prominently among the figments of “The Third Policeman.” Perhaps the most erotic passage in O’Brien’s fiction concerns a bicycle that nuzzles up to our hero in a moment of need:\n\nHow can I convey the perfection of my comfort on the bicycle, the completeness of my union with her, the sweet responses she gave me at every particle of her frame? . . . She moved beneath me with agile sympathy in a swift, airy stride, finding smooth ways among the stony tracks, swaying and bending skillfully to match my changing attitudes, even accommodating her left pedal patiently to the awkward working of my wooden leg.\n\nThe wooden leg attracts fourteen men with the same affliction; they try to rescue him from the policemen, who have led the narrator through a subterranean realm of circular corridors and metal doors not dissimilar to one of Beckett’s carefully mapped Hells. Ovenlike cabinets produce objects that defy description (“I can only say that these objects, not one of which resembled the other, were of no known dimensions”), as well as a half-ton block of gold and a host of other wish fulfillments. Surreal though all this is, the reader cares about what happens next because it promises, unlike events in “At Swim-Two-Birds,” to be connected to what went before and what will come. Into this weird fable of guilt and flight O’Brien has inserted some curious truths (bicycles are never mounted from the right) and some ineffable sentences:\n\nBirds were audible in the secrecy of the bigger trees, changing branches and conversing not tumultuously.\n\nMacCruiskeen lit a match for our cigarettes and then threw it carelessly on the plate floor where it lay looking very much important and alone.\n\nThe long evening had made its way into the barrack through the windows, creating mysteries everywhere, erasing the seam between one thing and another, lengthening out the floors and either thinning the air or putting some refinement on my ear enabling me to hear for the first time the clicking of a cheap clock from the kitchen.\n\nThe rather systematic French absurdism of Jarry and Queneau takes on the twilit shimmer of a Celtic fairy tale. Yet the book, for all its shape-shifting comedy, has a heft of despair to it, an honest nihilism, as expressed by Martin Finnucane, an unrepentant robber. Asked by our narrator if he has any objections to life, he answers, “Is it life? . . . I would rather be without it . . . for there is a queer small utility in it. You cannot eat it or drink it or smoke it in your pipe, it does not keep the rain out and it is a poor armful in the dark. . . . It is a great mistake and a thing better done without, like bed-jars and foreign bacon.”\n\nO’Brien, who spoke Irish Gaelic in his childhood home, wrote his next extended fiction, “An Béal Bocht,” in Gaelic, in 1941; in 1973, it was translated, by Patrick C. Power, into a spirited imitation of O’Brien’s English as “The Poor Mouth: A Bad Story About the Hard Life.” Less than a hundred pages long, the tale has the advantage of a relatively clear, if extravagant, story line and a distinct satiric point—i.e., that the Irish Republic’s official cherishing of the nearly extinct Gaelic language ignores the miserable poverty of its surviving speakers, the rain-battered peasantry of the countryside. In one episode, government orators at a Gaelic feis parrot and praise the venerable language while in their audience “many Gaels collapsed from hunger and from the strain of listening.” In another, a folklorist from Dublin, visiting O’Brien’s fictional Gaeltacht area of Corkadoragha, and frustrated by the drunken taciturnity of an assembly of local males, records the muttering of a pig under the impression that it is Gaelic: “He understood that good Gaelic is difficult but that the best Gaelic of all is well-nigh unintelligible.” Parodying sentimental novels and memoirs in modern Gaelic by such authors as Tomás Ó Criomhthainn and Séamas Ó Grianna, O’Brien protests on behalf of a depressed Irish population: “In one way or another, life was passing us by and we were suffering misery, sometimes having a potato and at other times having nothing in our mouths but sweet words of Gaelic.” His hero, young Bonaparte O’Coonassa, does find, in an abysmal cave inhabited by a hermit, a hoard of gold coins, but the cave also holds a stream of yellow water that, in a scene of alcoholic revelation with counterparts in every novel by this author, turns out to be whiskey:\n\nAmazement surged up in my head until it injured me. I went to the well on my knees, to the place where the yellow water was bursting up, and consumed enough to set every bone a-tremble.\n\nHad “The Third Policeman” made its way to print in 1940, there is no telling what further novels O’Brien might have written. As it was, he devoted his contrarian instincts and bristling erudition (he knew a startling amount about steam engines, and could toss off sentences in Greek, Latin, French, German, and Italian) to his column in the Irish Times, busying himself as well with plays and television scripts. Not until 1961 did he publish another novel, “The Hard Life: An Exegesis of Squalor.” He dedicated “this misterpiece” to Graham Greene, “whose own forms of gloom I admire,” and chose as his epigraph the pensée of Pascal’s that blames all the trouble of the world on people ever leaving their rooms. Donohue’s introduction relates the novel’s Dublin milieu and its relatively conservative artistry to the author’s twenty-year stint of churning out newspaper copy as Myles na gCopaleen. He likens its humdrum setting and mood to Joyce’s “Dubliners,” and errs by claiming that the action ends in 1904, the year of Bloomsday—its climactic death comes in 1910. “Oddly oblique,” he concludes, “The Hard Life reads as . . . a rather mild attack on the pretenses of Catholicism and an already vanishing social order.”\n\nOblique, indeed: there is nothing especially hard or squalid about the situation of the two orphaned brothers, Manus and Finbarr, who grow up under the care of their deceased mother’s half brother Mr. Collopy and his daughter, Miss Annie. The boys are fed, sheltered, clothed, and sent to school. Mr. Collopy has for a friend an immigrant German Jesuit, Father Kurt Fahrt, and for a cause he leads a campaign to provide adequate public rest rooms for the good women of Dublin. In their evening conversations, he baits Father Fahrt about the Jesuits, but the priest makes peaceable replies and—a traditional Irish courtesy—accepts another drink. Possibly infuriated by his characters’ refusal to give the novel momentum, O’Brien consigns them all to a flagrantly far-fetched encounter in Rome with the Pope, arranged by Manus, who has left Ireland to pursue, with some success, a host of elaborate and fraudulent schemes. The dialogue with the Pope, who speaks a scrupulously transcribed mixture of Latin and Italian, and the unwieldy decline of Mr. Collopy, who becomes prodigiously, fatally heavy through faithful ingestion of Gravid Water as prescribed and supplied by his former ward, do raise smiles and even laughter in the indulgent reader; yet the theme of being poisoned, proposed by an author whose health was sinking, in early middle age, into a morass of uremia, pleurisy, sycosis, neuralgia, anemia, and liver cancer, is not that funny. Like “The Poor Mouth,” “The Hard Life” drips with disgust, but it feels too autobiographical to direct the disgust outward onto objective correlatives. It ends when Finbarr, the relatively inert and passive narrator, abruptly purges himself of his contents:\n\nIn a daze I lifted my own glass and without knowing what I was doing did exactly what the brother did, drained the glass in one vast swallow. Then I walked quickly but did not run to the lavatory. There, everything inside me came up in a tidal surge of vomit.\n\n“The Dalkey Archive,” published in 1964, has lent its name to the avant-garde publishing house that keeps Flann O’Brien in print in this country. It is the only one of his novels (but for the unfinished “Slattery’s Sago Saga”) to be written in the third person. The opening pages, evoking the village of Dalkey, are promising (“It is an unlikely town, huddled, quiet, pretending to be asleep. Its streets are narrow, not quite self-evident as streets and with meetings which seem accidental. Small shops look closed but are open”), and, toward the end, a penetrating poignance colors the portrait of an imagined James Joyce who quietly tends bar south of Dublin and attends Mass daily, who did not die in Switzerland but lived on, disowning “Ulysses” as a “dirty book” and forgetting “Finnegans Wake” entirely. He has shed his voracious genius and emerged as a decent, mild old man with bad eyesight who timidly dreams of becoming a Jesuit. O’Brien had Oedipal feelings about Joyce, and this conjuration momentarily steals the show. The adventures of Mick Shaughnessy, a civil servant with a girlfriend called Mary and a self-assigned mission to save the world from a four-gallon metal cask of oxygen-eating chemicals, fail to engage both the writer and the reader. De Selby has been salvaged from the unpublished manuscript of “The Third Policeman” but is presented with nothing like the brio of that book’s footnotes. The rejected novel’s bicycle-mad policemen, and its “fine views of bogland,” are transplanted nearly intact. Even its road magic is remembered:\n\nThe cracking of your feet on the road makes a certain amount of road come up into you. When a man dies they say he returns to clay funereally but too much walking fills you up with clay far sooner (or buries bits of you along the road) and brings your death halfway to meet you.\n\nHowever, as is said of one loquacious character, “his fancies were usually amusing but not so good when they were meaningless.” Whatever meaning O’Brien set out with on this particular road has been left scattered along the wayside. He said of “The Dalkey Archive” that it was “not a novel” but “really an essay in extreme derision of literary attitudes and people, and one pervasive fault is absence of emphasis, in certain places, to help the reader.” It was too late for O’Brien to think of helping the reader, though he provides passages of synopsis to keep the events, and non-events, straight. But orthodox narration was never his forte; at his best, he went where he would, at a blithe speed, and carried the reader—a dazzle of verbal dust in his eyes—along. ♦"
