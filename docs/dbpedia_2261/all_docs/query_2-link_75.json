        "text": "In 1964, Brian O’Nolan made brief mention of his civil service career in a ‘preliminary personal note’ on his proposal to write a history of Irish Whiskey distilling for the Irish Distillers Group:\n\nAfter considerable University studies, which included experience abroad, I joined the Irish Civil Service in 1935. I resigned in 1953, with the rank of Principal Officer, having found the milieu increasingly distasteful. It was bad enough that nearly all Ministers were either peasants or uneducated shop boys (to some of whom I acted as Private Secretary) but there was undisguised graft, jobbery, and corrupt practices large and small.1\n\nAs inappropriate as such vehemence might be in this context, O’Nolan’s diatribe reflects the growing presence of the civil service and officialdom in his writings. In The Dalkey Archive, for example, Michael Shaughnessy, introduces himself to De Selby by saying ‘I am a lowly civil servant, I detest the job, its low atmosphere and the scruff who are my companions in the office.’2 Similarly, in his Cruiskeen Lawn column for The Irish Times, Myles na gCopaleen frequently spoke on behalf of the increasingly bitter civil servant, Brian O’Nolan. This article argues, however, that despite his disregard for its ‘low atmosphere,’ the civil service was a very accommodating milieu for writers such as O’Nolan and that, by breaching well-known boundaries, he was in fact the author of his own misfortunes.\n\nA 1945 Cruiskeen Lawn column, written when O’Nolan was ten years in the civil service, shows signs of impatience at his lack of advancement. In a hilariously convoluted review of a programme note for Micheál MacLiammóir’s stage version of Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, Myles considers the aesthetics problem of those ‘chronically incapable of appreciating a thing in terms of itself.’ He finishes the column with the sneer that ‘[n]o Irish farmer appreciates his young strapping son for the attractive healthy agricultural type he is (and must intrinsically remain). The Irish farmer sees his son as a potential Higher Executive Officer, Grade II, Temporary, Unestablished, full of grievances about bonus.’3 There is considerable condescension in the ‘must intrinsically remain.’ The intrinsically bourgeois O’Nolan could not see the value to an Irish farmer of seeing his son going to work in a clean suit, to a job where his hands remained clean, with regular pay and holidays, and a pension at the end. Where recruitment in the respectable lower middle-class positions in the banks, insurance houses, and larger business concerns such as Guinness was still through sectarian influences and patronage, the civil service was one of few careers open to educated young men and women, of all denominations, with no social connections or wealth.\n\nNotes"
