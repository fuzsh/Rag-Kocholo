        "text": "On Tuesday’s edition of Zolak & Bertrand, Scott Zolak explained why Jerod Mayo was showing up Jerod Mayo with his actions yesterday.\n\nIt’s a bad look…\n\nBertrand: Is Judon doing this yesterday, because Mayo is the head coach? There’s no way Judon comes out and acts the way that he did yesterday, if Bill (Belichick) is his head coach. In fact, we’ve seen him in previous years having this situation with the contract. It happened a year ago at this time, and he did not do the things he was doing yesterday. He was involved in his position group. He was in between the fields. He took a very serious sort of attitude toward the practice. This is different, and I think it’s all because of Mayo being the head coach.\n\nZolak: Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick had a different role. When you’re out of practice and physically there, you do not wear street clothes. With the street clothes, it looks like you’re shutting down. The same rule applies on the sideline when you’re out of the game at halftime, in the preseason. There will be many teams that take their pads off and put their shirt back on to look cool, because it’s an indicator that “I’m done, I’m not with the rest of the team”. Here, you leave your pads on the whole time. Judon came out last year with silver pants, red undershirt, red jersey, and a helmet. Didn’t do every drill, but moved with every drill within the defensive practice. This is what’s different- it looks like he showed Mayo up. It’s a bad look.\n\nBertrand: Mayo though, to his credit, because I know a lot of people are going to criticize Mayo. I’m criticizing Mayo because obviously, however he’s coached this team over the last several months, it’s opened the door for what happened yesterday. He’s not enough of an authoritarian down there to keep this thing in check and in line. But he immediately told the player, in my opinion, I don’t know what was said, but it looked to me like he told Matthew Judon,”get off my practice field”. Only problem with that is, Judon only respected the order for about ten minutes and decided, “You know what? I don’t need to listen to him. I’m going right back out onto the practice field, and now I’m going to go at the GM.”\n\nListen to the full segment!\n\nTyler Milliken started out at the Sports Hub as an intern in 2020 for the Zolak & Bertrand program before eventually becoming the associate producer in late 2021.
