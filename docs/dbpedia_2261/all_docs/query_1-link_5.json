        "text": "I'm not sure if a grinning Irish guy who's speechless for 45 seconds is going to make good TV, but it might be just what you get. There are no such things, I believe, as competition between actors. You can't really award any of us. What we try to do is be good. The nomination hopefully means that we're good. Any of the actors in this category would be standing here if they had my part. There are great parts. I have the best part on Broadway. If you are listening at home on television, I've just said that, so it's true, so you better come and see our show. Our show is called Frozen. In theater, in plays, in which I am passionate about, we don't have scores underneath. When I was watching these musical numbers, it was fantastic. I sat back and went, 'Wow.' In theater, on stage, we sit on the edge of our seats. We are part of the play, and it is every bit as electrifying. Come see Frozen! And thank you so much. I am very honored. - Best Featured Actor in a Play, Frozen\n\n\"I was doing a play at the time, and I had just won the Tony Award the night before. So I had to leave that, get on a plane and a few hours after that I had to be on the set. Honestly I was thinking about the play, I had to take a few performances off so I was thinking mostly about the play.\" - On what was going through his mind while on the set of Million Dollar Baby."
