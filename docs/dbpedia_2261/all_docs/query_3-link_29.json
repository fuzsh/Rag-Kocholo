Sometimes dropping in a bit of harmonica for good measure. All the while building a sound and playing style that is deceptively larger than it seems. In 2010, he won a best blues award for his song “Seen My Baby” at the New Mexico Music Awards and another in 2013 for “End of My Rope.” Ayon’s influences are Junior Kimbrough, R.L.

His harmonica renditions of fiddle tunes are a crowd favorite! The afternoon begins with the Mississippi Acoustic Trio, Dubuque’s longest running musical group, playing bluegrass, folk, Americana, and country. The Mud Lake Music Society in partnership with the Friends of Dubuque County Conservation announce the return of the Mud Lake Bluegrass Sundays series. Promoted by The Dubuque County Conservation Board, this popular event draws music performers from all around the country and began as an effort to bring bluegrass music to an outdoor setting by the Mississippi River at Mud Lake Park. With a focus on audience involvement, each event kicks off with the Pickers Pick-nic starting at noon and going until 2 p.m. It’s the perfect setting to meet and play with other aspiring pickers. Guest instructors help with tuning, answer questions, and then organize the jam sessions. Then at 2 p.m., the main stage fires up with a regional opening act followed by a national touring act at 3:30 p.m., entertaining until approximately 6 p.m. Asking attendees only for freewill donations, the society’s goal is to raise enough money to cover costs and retain a small fund to continue Mud Lake Bluegrass Sundays the next year. Camping spaces are available at Mud Lake Park, along with food concessions and special Mud Lake Bluegrass souvenirs (shirts, instrument, and raffles). No alcohol is served, but visitors may bring their own coolers, and it is recommended that people bring lawn chairs. People are also encouraged to bring their own instruments and participate in the free music clinics prior to main stage acts.
