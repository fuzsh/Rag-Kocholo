From the high-energy driving rhythm of Irish jigs and reels to slower-paced airs and sean-nÃ³s ('old style') songs (sung in both Irish and English), they stay well in touch with the roots of the music, while infusing it with their own special style. The duo will play and explain several instruments, including fiddle, Irish flute, concertina, and tin whistle. Children will also have the chance to learn and sing along to a few Irish Gaelic children's songs.\n\nThe Brosnan School of Irish Dance will perform jigs, reels, and other high-kicking steps!\n\nTime:Â 11:00 am - 12:00 noonÂ\n\nLocation: San Francisco Public Library, Fisher Children's Center, 100 Larkin Street @ Grove, SF\n\nNights in Shanaglish â US Film Premiere About Live Session Recordings in Shanaglish, Ireland\n\nCrossroads' 10th Anniversary launches with the U.S. Premiere of a documentary film, Nights in Shanaglish, a unique project focused on the culture of traditional Irish music sessions and the making of an album in Shanaglish, County Galway, Ireland.Â Vincey Keehan, a native of Shanaglish who has lived in San Francisco for more than 30 years, brought this project to life along with Paddy Egan of County Wicklow.Â The film, directed by Firgus Tighe, focuses on the process of recording live performances and captures the connection between performers, pub owner, and local characters.Â Live music before the film is shown.Â Q & A to follow.\n\nTime: Musical Performance: 1:00 pm.Â Film: 1:45 p.m.Â\n\nLocation: SF Public Library, Koret Auditorium, 100 Larkin Street @ Grove, SF\n\nA special thanks to the Friends of the San Francisco Public Library for their partial support of events on this day.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 13th\n\nThe Diaries of Denis & Bridget Oliver:Â A Dramatic Reading & Exhibit Crossroads and the California Historical Society present this first-ever exhibit and dramatic reading based on the writings of two emigrants to San Francisco who survived An Gorta MÃ³r (The Great Hunger/Famine) and lived in San Francisco from 1849 -1880s.\n\nDramatic readers RenÃ©e Gibbons and Tom McCarthy will read selections from the diaries.Â Harp music provided by Mitch Landy.

He has been established as a first class musician ever since his work in the early 1970âs (with such renowned performers as Arlo Guthrie, Christy Moore and the Bothy Band and with his far-reaching solo album, If the Cap Fits).Â During his long musical career Kevin has earned international acclaim in both Europe and America as a solo performer, a teacher and as a member of some of folk musicâs foremost groups including Celtic Fiddle Festival, and Patrick Street. He is also a featured member of Grammy winner Tim OâBrienâs wonderful crossover band, The Crossing. Kevin is a National Endowment for the Arts 2002 National Heritage Fellowship recipient, the USA's highest honor for excellence in the folk and traditional arts. Previous National Heritage Fellows include B.B. King, Doc Watson, and Bill Monroe. 2010 saw Kevinâs induction to the Oregon Music Hall of Fame. He was very honored to receive such a tribute from his adopted home state.Â Â www.kevinburke.comÂ Â\n\nOne of the most accomplished Irish multi-instrumentalists alive. The flourishing diaspora of Irish traditional music had no finer exponent than John Carty â¦Â\n\n---Earle Hitchner, Irish Echo\n\nJohn Carty is one of Ireland's finest traditional musicians having been awarded the Irish Television station, TG4's Traditional Musician of the Year in 2003.Â Carty has three solo fiddle albums, two banjo albums, two group albums and a sprinkling of recorded tenor guitar and flute music recordings under his belt. Born in London, John has established himself among the elite in Irish traditional music and as a staunch supporter of its preservation. Carty developed his love for fiddle, banjo, and flute, all of which he has mastered, through his multi-instrumentalist father who was a member of the Glenside Ceili Band in London in the 1960's.Â With a firm foundation of both talent and knowledge of the tradition, John has been a welcome addition to many of the great bands of today, including Patrick Street, The Chieftains, and DeDanaan, as well as his remarkable solo career.\n\nAll festival events are free to the public unless otherwise indicated.\n\nFor more information, please call (415) 810-3774\n\nor email info@irishamericancrossroads.org\n\nClick here to download a PDF file with the 2013 calendar poster."
