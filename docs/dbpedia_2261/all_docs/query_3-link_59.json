        "text": "At an early age, Basquiat shows an affinity for drawing, often using paper his father brings home from the accounting firm where he works to make drawings inspired by television cartoons. His mother has a strong interest in fashion design and sketching, and she frequently draws with Basquiat.\n\n“His mother got him started and she pushed him. She was actually a very good artist” (Gerard Basquiat). 1\n\n1965\n\nWith his mother, Basquiat often visits The Brooklyn Museum, The Museum of Modern Art, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. His mother continues to encourage his interest in art and emphasizes the importance of education. Basquiat attends kindergarten at a Head Start Project school.\n\n“I’d say my mother gave me all the primary things. The art came from her” (Basquiat). 2\n\nIn May, while playing ball in the street, Basquiat is hit by an automobile. He breaks an arm, suffers various internal injuries, and has to have his spleen removed. He is hospitalized at King’s County Hospital for one month. While recovering, he receives a copy of Gray’s Anatomy from his mother. The book makes a lasting impression; its influence is found in Basquiat’s later work with anatomical drawings and prints and in the name of the band he co-founded in 1979, Gray.\n\nGerard and Matilde Basquiat separate. The seven-year-old Basquiat lives with his father and two sisters in East Flatbush.\n\nImage Credit: ‘Notes’ © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nGerard Basquiat and his three children move to the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn. Basquiat leaves St. Ann’s for public school, P.S. 181, the first of many New York City public schools he will attend, including P.S. 6, 101,45, and I.S. 293.\n\n1974\n\nDue to a job promotion and relocation, Gerard Basquiat moves with his three children to Mira Mar, Puerto Rico, near San Juan, where Basquiat attends an Episcopalian school.\n\n1975\n\nBasquiat runs away from home, staying for a few hours at a local radio station until the employees call his father, who immediately brings him home.\n\n”Jean-Michel did not like obedience. He gave me a lot of trouble” (Gerard Basquiat).4\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, after a job transfer, Gerard Basquiat and his three children return from Puerto Rico to live in their Boerum Hill brownstone. Basquiat resumes schooling at Edward R. Murrow High School.\n\nAfter a few weeks, he transfers to the City-as-School, a progressive school in Manhattan. Part of the New York City public school system, the City-as-School is an alternative high school where work-study internships are accepted as credit toward a high school degree. Designed for gifted and talented children who find the traditional educational process difficult, it is based on John Dewey’s theory that students learn by doing. At City-as- School, Basquiat meets Al Diaz, a graffitist from the Jacob Riis Projects on the Lower East Side; they become close friends and early artistic collaborators.\n\nIn December, Basquiat again runs away, this time for about two weeks, hanging out in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, a place he and Diaz would often frequent. After much searching, Gerard Basquiat finds him and brings him home. Basquiat proclaims, “Papa, I will be very, very famous one day. 5\n\n“I left home at 15, and went to Washington Square Park. I just sat there dropping acid …. Now that all seems boring; it eats your mind up” (Basquiat). 6\n\nPhoto Credit: Downtown 81 (New York Beat) © New York Beat Film LLC.© The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat Photo by Edo Bertoglio\n\nThrough the City-as-School, Basquiat becomes involved with an Upper West Side drama group called Family Life Theater. During this time, he creates a fictional character named SAMO (Same Old Shit), who makes a living selling a fake religion. Basquiat and Diaz, among the most popular students at City-as-School, both very creative and with a knack for getting into a lot of trouble, begin collaborating on the SAMO project as “a way of letting off steam.” 7\n\nThey begin spray-painting aphorisms on the D train of the IND line and around lower Manhattan. The writings consist of witty philosophical poems: SAMO as an end to mindwash religion nowhere politics, and bogus philosophy,” “SAMO saves idiots, Plush safe he think; SAMO.\n\n“The stuff you see on the subways now is inane. Scribbled. SAMO was like a refresher course because there’s some kind of statement being made” (Al Diaz). 8\n\nNora Fitzpatrick begins residing with Gerard Basquiat. She becomes a maternal figure, and friend, to the younger Basquiat.\n\nAt Diaz’s graduation from the City-as-School in June, Basquiat, on a dare, prepares a box full of shaving cream, and while the principal is speaking he runs up to the podium and dumps the box on his head. Although only a year away from graduating, Basquiat feels there is “no point in going back.” 9\n\nPhoto Credit: Downtown 81 (New York Beat) © New York Beat Film LLC.© The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat Photo by Edo Bertoglio\n\nIn June, Basquiat leaves home for good. Gerard Basquiat, with some trepidation, gives his son money with the understanding that he will try his best to succeed.\n\nBasquiat’s fascination with stardom and “burning out” is a recurring subject in his life. Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, two people whose work and artistic achievement Basquiat admires, had both died of drug overdoses at the age of twenty- seven in 1970. His admiration for musicians, singers, and boxers like Joplin, Hendrix, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Joe Louis is shown later in various paintings.\n\n“Jean-Michel was planning to be a star” (Gerard Basquiat). 10\n\n“Since I was seventeen, I thought I might be a star. I’d think about all my heroes, Charlie Parker, Jimi Hendrix …. I had a romantic feeling of how people had become famous” (Basquiat). 11\n\nBasquiat stays at the homes of various friends, frequently at the Canal Street loft of British artist Stan Peskett, who throws parties that bring the uptown graffitists, including Fred Braithwaite and Lee Quinones, downtown, although more for the exchange of musical ideas than art. At these parties, Basquiat also meets Michael Holman, a future member of Gray, and Danny Rosen, who immediately becomes a companion on the downtown club scene. Basquiat, Rosen, Holman, and Vincent Gallo, who would also join Gray, are referred to as the “baby crowd” at the clubs.\n\n“They were gorgeous, extremely stylish, and danced fantastically” (Edit DeAk).12\n\nBasquiat begins to sell hand-painted postcards and T-shirts to make a little money. He approaches Andy Warhol and Henry Geldzahler inside the SoHo restaurant WPA; he sells a postcard to Warhol but Geldzahler dismisses him as “too young.” 13\n\nBasquiat begins dating Alexis Adler and the two often stay together at friends’ houses in downtown Manhattan. They live for a while in the apartment of their close friend Felice Ralster, until Basquiat becomes unbearable because he writes and draws over everything in the apartment.\n\n“Basquiat painted on anything he could get his hands on: refrigerators, laboratory coats, cardboard boxes, and doors” (Mary Ann Monforton). 14\n\nBasquiat and Adler move into a small apartment at 527 East 12th Street, his first fixed address. During this time, he becomes a regular among a crowd of filmmakers, musicians, and artists that hang out at the “new” downtown spots: the Mudd Club, Club 57, CBGB’s, Hurrah’s, and Tier 3. Along with Patti Astor, co-founder of the Fun Gallery, David Byrne, Blondie, Madonna, Tina Lhotsky, the B-52s, John Lurie, Diego Cortez, Edit DeAk, Ann Magnuson, and John Sex, Basquiat regularly makes the scene at the Mudd Club.\n\nAt the same time, a cultural aesthetic is flowering uptown in the streets of Harlem and the basements of the South Bronx: rap, graffiti, and breakin’ -the roots of hip-hop culture. Fred Braithwaite notes that “the scene downtown … was pretty much all white except for me, Jean-Michel, and a few other people.”15\n\nAs Basquiat saw it, “there’s not enough black people downtown in this … whatever it is, pseudo art bullshit.” 16\n\nShortly after the article in The Village Voice, Basquiat and Diaz have a falling out that ends the SAMO collaboration, and “SAMO is dead” begins appearing on various SoHo walls.\n\n“Jean-Michel saw SAMO as a vehicle, the graffiti was an advertisement for himself. … all of a sudden he just started taking it over” (Al Diaz). 20\n\nBasquiat concentrates on painting T-shirts and making postcards, drawings, and collages. They display a combination of graffiti art and Abstract Expressionism, and focus on baseball players, the Kennedy assassination, and consumer items such as Pez candy. Basquiat collaborates on many of these with John Sex and Jennifer Stein, and sells the work in Washington Square Park, around SoHo, and in front of The Museum of Modern Art.\n\nPhoto Credit: Henry Flynt ‘The SAMO© Graffiti Portfolio, 1979-91’, ‘Boom For Real’ Catalogue\n\nIn May, Basquiat, along with Michael Holman, Shannon Dawson, and Vincent Gallo form the band Channel 9, later renamed Test Pattern, then Gray. They are subsequently joined by Wayne Clifford and Nick Taylor. Basquiat plays clarinet and synthesizers for the group, which performs a distinct blend of jazz, punk, and synth-pop, often referred to as “noise music.”\n\n“It wasn’t about the level of playing, it was about the sound”\n\n(Michael Holman) .21\n\nIn the fall, while wandering around the School of Visual Arts, Basquiat meets fellow artists and downtown scenemakers Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf. Haring and Scharf are as much a part of the scene at Club 57 as Basquiat is at the Mudd Club. Basquiat and Haring share an on-again, off-again relationship for the rest of their lives. Basquiat admires the raw, graffiti qualities of Haring’s work, and he sees Haring as truly a part of the graffiti subculture in a way that he is not. After reading “SAMO is dead,” Haring per- forms a eulogy for SAMO at Club 57. In 1988, Haring paints A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat as a memorial to Basquiat.\n\nThrough Fred Braithwaite, Basquiat meets Glenn O’Brien, the producer of TV Party on New York cable television and music editor at Interview. They become good friends, and Basquiat frequently appears on O’Brien’s TV Party.\n\nAt the Mudd Club, Basquiat meets Diego Cortez, an artist and filmmaker, who knows people within and outside of the East Village club scene. Cortez takes a liking to Basquiat’s work, sells some drawings, and eventually shows the work to art dealers. He also formally introduces Basquiat to Henry Geldzahler, who becomes a friend and early collector of Basquiat’s art.\n\n“Diego had done a lot … some performance stuff with Laurie Anderson. He was one of the few people who had contacts in both music and art at the Mudd Club”(Glenn O’Brien).22\n\nIn June, Basquiat’s art is publicly exhibited for the first time in the “Times Square Show,” a group exhibition held in a vacant building at 41st Street and Seventh Avenue in the Times Square area of New York. The exhibition is organized by Colab (Collaborative Projects Incorporated), an artist-run group based on the Lower East Side, and Fashion Moda, a graffiti-based alternative gallery space in the South Bronx. Like members of the two organizing groups, the conjunction of artists in the show represents two very distinct subcultures: the downtown avant-garde consisting of new wave and neo-pop, and the uptown avant-garde of rap and graffiti.\n\nSome of the other artists in the show are: John Ahearn, Jane Dickson, Mike Glier, Mimi Gross, David Hammons, Jenny Holzer, Joe Lewis, Candace Hill-Montgomery, Tom Otterness, Lee Quinones, Kenny Scharf, Kiki Smith, and Robin Winters.\n\nPhoto Credit: Red Kings, 1981 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nThe “Times Square Show” is enthusiastically received by the art world, an early step in legitimizing the artists of the East Village club scene. Basquiat creates a large SAMO installation on a single wall of the space and is one of a few artists discussed in the review for Art in America.\n\n“A patch of wall by SAMO, the omnipresent graffiti sloganeer, was a knock- out combination of de Kooning and subway spray-paint scribbles” (Jeffrey Deitch). 23\n\nEncouraged by the recognition of his artistic talent, Basquiat announces that he is quitting Gray, and the band plays for the last time at the Mudd Club on August 3.\n\nPictured Here: VNDRZ, 1982 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nIn January, Basquiat and his girlfriend, Suzanne Mallouk, a singer and artist, begin sharing an apartment at 68 East lst Street.\n\nIn February, Basquiat is included in “New York/New Wave,” an exhibition organized by Diego Cortez for the large gallery space at P.S. 1, Institute for Art and Urban Resources, in Long Island City. The show includes more than twenty artists, among them Edie Baskin, Keith Haring, Robert Mapplethorpe, Kenny Scharf, Andy Warhol, and the graffiti artists Ali, Crash, Dondi, Fab 5 Freddy (Braithwaite), Haze, Lady Pink, Seen, and Zephyr. Basquiat has high visibility in the show, with a wall on which he installs more than twenty drawings and paintings. These works attract the attention of dealers Emilio Mazzoli, Bruno Bischofberger, and Annina Nosei. The day after the opening of the show, Basquiat returns home to Brooklyn around six in the morning and proclaims, “Papa I’ve made it!” 24\n\nImmediately after the P.S. 1 show, Haring organizes the “Lower Manhattan Drawing Show” at the Mudd Club, for which he selects more than seventy artists, including Basquiat, Charlie Ahearn, Donald Baechler, Fred Braithwaite, Crash, Jane Dickson, Futura 2000, Joe Lewis, Judy Rifka, Kenny Scharf, and Sir Rodney Sur.\n\nIn April, Braithwaite and Futura organize an exhibition at the Mudd Club, “Beyond Words: Graffiti Based-Rooted-Inspired Works.” The show includes the work of Basquiat (as SAMO), Tseng Kwong Chi, Daze, Dondi, Keily Jenkins, Phase II, Iggy Pop, Quick, Rammellzee, and Zephyr.\n\nIn May, Basquiat travels to Europe for the first time, for his first one-artist exhibition, at the Galleria d’Arte Emilio Mazzoli in Modena, Italy. The work is shown under the name SAMO.\n\nBasquiat is invited by Annina Nosei to participate in the group show “Public Address” at her gallery in September. Sociopolitical content is the focus of the exhibition, with works by Bill Beckley, Mike Glier, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, and Peter Nadin. Basquiat is given the entire rear gallery for his paintings, whose subjects include policemen, rabbis, and Native Americans. Following this exhibition, Nosei becomes Basquiat’s primary dealer and, knowing he has no studio space of his own, invites him to use her gallery basement space as a studio.\n\nPictured Here: “SAMO”, FIRST ONE MAN SHOW, Exhibit Invitation Card, Galleria d’Arte Emilio Mazzoli Italy, 1981 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nThe first extensive article on Basquiat, “The Radiant Child,” by Rene Ricard, appears in the December 1981 issue of Artforum. The detailed essay examines the emerging New York artists from the Mudd Club shows, the “Times Square Show,” and “New York/New Wave.” Some of the other artists discussed are John Ahearn, Fred Braithwaite, Francesco Clemente, Dondi, Futura 2000, Keith Haring, Lady Pink, and Judy Rifka.\n\n“I’m always amazed by how people come up with things. Like Jean- Michel. How did he come up with those words he puts all over every-thing.? Their aggressively handmade look fits his peculiarly political sensibility …. Here the possession of almost anything of even marginal value becomes a token of corrupt materialism …. The elegance of Twombly is there but from the same source (graffiti) and so is the brut of the young Dubuffet” (Rene Ricard). 25\n\nPhoto Credit: Jean-Michel Basquiat in his studio, New York 1982. Photo by Gianfranco Gorgoni © Maya Gorgoni\n\nIn January, Basquiat moves with Suzanne Mallouk to 151 Crosby Street in SoHo, an apartment that Nosei arranges for Basquiat.\n\nBasquiat meets Shenge Kapharoah, an artist from Barbados. The two become inseparable friends, sharing interests in African ideologies and the concerns of artists within the African diaspora, subjects that were not of interest to many of Basquiat’s friends.\n\n“You can see our friendship in the work. The paintings speak for them- selves … Moses and the Egyptians, Charles the First, lines like ‘most kings get their heads chopped off. ‘ This is what we were talking about” (Shenge Kapharoah). 26\n\nIn March, Basquiat has his first one-artist exhibition in the United States at the Annina Nosei Gallery. Paintings in this show include Arroz con Pollo, Self-Portrait, Untitled (Per Capita), and Untitled (Two Heads on Gold). The exhibition is a huge success.\n\nPictured Here: Arroz con Pollo, 1981 © Collection of Felipe Grimberg.\n\nBasquiat stays at the Chateau Marmont and at friends’ houses for about six months. He likes the Los Angeles climate and club scene and is given a friendly initial reception among Los Angeles collectors; Eli and Edythe Broad, Douglas S. Cramer, and Stephane Janssen become early collectors of Basquiat’s work. He returns to Los Angeles at least two or three times a year for the rest of his life.\n\nIn June, Basquiat, at age twenty-one, is the youngest of 176 artists invited to participate in the international exhibition “Documenta 7” in Kassel, West Germany. His work is shown with that of such established artists as Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, A. R. Penck, Gerhard Richter, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol, in addition to that of younger artists Francesco Clemente, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, Lee Quinones, and David Salle. Among the paintings shown are Acque Pericolose (Poison Oasis) and Arroz con Pollo.\n\n“Jean-Michel Basquiat … has an inbred compositional sense that verges on good taste, as was particularly evident in his Documenta canvas Acque Pericolose …. his strength comes not so much from the social- commentary aspect of his work (although he has made some unforgettable saints and sinners) … but from his Twomblyesque lyrical qualities” (Noel Frackman and Ruth Kaufmann). 30\n\nBasquiat creates his first portfolio of prints, titled Anatomy. It consists of eighteen silkscreens on paper in an edition of eighteen with seven artist’s proofs, printed by Jo Watanabe and published by the Annina Nosei Gallery.\n\nHis first one-artist exhibition at the Galerie Bruno Bischofberger in Zurich opens in September. This exhibition marks the first showing of Basquiat’s exposed corner crossbar paintings. Bischofberger becomes his exclusive dealer in Europe.\n\nIn October, an Art in America article by Suzi Gablik entitled “Report from New York: The Graffiti Question” features Basquiat, Braithwaite, Futura 2000, Haring, and Quinones, among others, identifying them as part of the new “graffiti movement” and discussing the emergence of the Lower East Side art scene. The piece is an early attempt to label artists of the 1980s. Basquiat, however, was not a representative graffiti artist because his written messages as SAMO did not share the formal concerns of graffiti artists, namely, their colorful palette.\n\nNevertheless, because he is young and because he is black, Basquiat’s paintings and drawings encourage the recognition of graffiti art within the art world. By this time, the Lower East Side arts scene has graduated from exhibitions in clubs to small storefront alternative gallery spaces that exhibit hundreds of young artists from the downtown club scene, artists who were rarely accepted by the larger art community of New York. Among these alternative venues are the Fun Gallery, East Seventh Street Gallery, Kenkeleba House, Gracie Mansion, B-Side, Area-X, and Civilian Warfare.\n\nBy the fall of 1982, personal differences have brought Basquiat’s relationship with Annina Nosei almost to an end. He works feverishly in his studio apartment on Crosby Street.\n\nI had some money; I made the best paintings ever. I was completely reclusive, worked a lot, took a lot of drugs. I was awful to people.” 31\n\nPictured Here: ‘Self-Portrait,’ 1982 © Collection of Bo Franzen\n\nIn November, Basquiat has a one-artist exhibition at the Fun Gallery, located at 254 East 10th Street and run by Bill Stelling and Patti Astor. Paintings in the show are severely underpriced with no regard for Basquiat’s present market value. This show, held contrary to the advice of Annina Nosei marks the end of Basquiat’s association with his first American dealer. The canvases reveal a terrific rawness in a crowded installation designed by Basquiat. The “messy” character of the installation may have been Basquiat’s response to criticism that, with his rising international fame and “cleaner” shows in the more finished spaces of SoHo galleries, his work had lost some of its originality. The paintings in this show, the fruit of his hermetic season in the Crosby Street loft, prove the critics wrong.\n\nThe show included approximately thirty works, among them Cabeza, Charles the First, Jawbone of an Ass, Three Quarters of Olympia Minus the Servant, and Untitled (Sugar Ray Robinson), which were among his favorites and which he kept for his personal collection.\n\n“Gut emotions lie behind the phrases and images, not the desire to make neo-expressionist commodities …. Basquiat makes paintings, but eschews the medium’s traditional rules” (Susan Hapgood). 32\n\nPictured Here: Untitled (Crown) 1982 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\n“Jean-Michel Basquiat’s show at the Fun Gallery was his best show yet. He was at home; the hanging was perfect, the paintings more authentic than ever” (Nicolas A. Moufarrege).33\n\nBasquiat poses for the renowned photographer James Van Der Zee, famous for his documentary photos of the Harlem Renaissance and his portraits of the artists, singers, and writers of the period. Basquiat grows to admire the elder Van Der Zee and later paints his portrait. The photo session with Van Der Zee is arranged by Diego Cortez to accompany Henry Geldzahler’s interview with Basquiat for Interview. This photo portrait places Basquiat in a geneaological line with other black artists of the twentieth century.\n\nIn December, Basquiat’s paintings are presented in a one-artist exhibition at the Galerie Delta in Rotterdam. In these works, like those in the Fun Gallery show, the crossbars of the stretcher corners are exposed and often hung on the wall by twine. LNAPRK and Kings of Egypt are among the paintings in the show.\n\nWith Rammellzee and graffiti artist Toxic, Basquiat returns to California. He spends part of winter 1982-83 in Los Angeles, often staying at the L’Ermitage hotel and dining with friends at Mr. Chow’s in Beverly Hills. He frequently gives paintings to Michael and Tina Chow, in return for food and drink.\n\nPhoto Credit: James Van Der Zee. Jean-Michel Basquiat, 1982.

Basquiat, with Hoffman’s help, produces five editions of prints, published in 1983 by New City Editions in Venice, California. Printed by Joel Stearns, the editions consist of three Untitled sets along with Back of the Neck and the 8-foot-tall Tuxedo.\n\nBasquiat’s interest in music continues. He produces a rap record with Fred Braithwaite, Toxic, A-One, Al Diaz, and Rammellzee and often dj’s at various Manhattan clubs. Some of his paintings-Charles the First, CPRKR, Discography (One), Discography (Two), Horn Players, and Max Roach-express his strong affinity for the work of the jazz artists Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Charlie “Bird” Parker, and Max Roach. Basquiat’s literary preferences include William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac.\n\nThe interest in jazz for Jean-Michel began with his father, then the personality of these characters and how they developed in their worlds, which he saw as similar to his own, particularly Parker and Holiday (Shenge Kapharoah).34\n\nIn February, Annina Nosei presents a one-artist exhibition of Basquiat’s work that includes Untitled and the Anatomy print portfolio.\n\nIn March, Basquiat returns to Los Angeles for his second show at the Larry Gagosian Gallery. Paintings include Untitled (Sugar Ray Robinson), Jack Johnson, Horn Players, Eyes and Eggs, Hollywood Africans, and All Colored Cast (Parts I and II). They feature texts and images related to famous boxers, musicians, and Hollywood films and the roles played by blacks in them.\n\nAlso in March, Basquiat is included in the 1983 Biennial Exhibition” at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. The exhibition includes more than forty artists, many being shown for the first time at the Museum, among them Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, David Salle, and Cindy Sherman. Basquiat, at age twenty-two is one of the youngest artists ever to be included in a Whitney Biennial. The two works exhibited are Dutch Settlers and Untitled (Skull).\n\nWe got tickets for the opening of the New Art show at the Whitney, the Biennial. And the show is just like the sixties …. These kids are selling everything-Jean-Michel Basquiat’s show sold out in Los Angeles” (Andy Warhol). 35\n\nPictured Here: Hollywood Africans, 1983, © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nIn May, Basquiat, Toxic, and Nick Taylor leave New York for a week in Jamaica, where Basquiat often draws in his hotel room and carries notebooks and writing tablets that he fills with cryptic notes and small drawings.\n\nOn August 15, Basquiat moves into 57 Great Jones Street, a building he leases from its owner, Andy Warhol. Their relationship flowers, though it prompts much discussion of white patronization of black art. Warhol and Basquiat work out together, paint each other’s portraits, attend art events, and regularly discuss philosophies of life and art, as well as Basquiat’s family experiences. Warhol encourages Basquiat to be more responsible toward his family.\n\n“Wanted Jean-Michel to come over and paint, but he was giving his mother a birthday party so I went to meet him and met his mother. She’s a nice-looking lady …. she was really nice and everything” (Andy Warhol). 36\n\n“One thing that affected Jean-Michel greatly was the Michael Stewart story …. He was completely freaked out. It was like it could have been him. It showed him how vulnerable he was” (Keith Haring). 39\n\n“It could have been me, it could have been me” (Basquiat). 40\n\nIn October, Basquiat and Warhol leave New York for Milan. Basquiat spends time in Madrid and Zurich as well as a week in Tokyo with dealer Bruno Bischofberger to attend a November exhibition of his work at the Akira Ikeda Gallery.\n\nBasquiat returns to New York in November. He, Warhol, and Francesco Clemente begin working on collaborative paintings in New York, an endeavor arranged by Bruno Bischofberger. Basquiat and Warhol also execute their own collaborative paintings.\n\n“Jean-Michel came up to the office but he was out of it. Clemente brought up some of the paintings that the three of us are working on together, and Jean-Michel was so out of it he began painting away. Jean-Michel and Clemente paint each other out. There’s about fifteen paintings that we’re working on together” (Andy Warhol). 41\n\nPictured Here: Dos Cabezas, 1982 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nBasquiat returns to Los Angeles in December, where he stays at L’Ermitage Hotel and spends time with Madonna, an acquaintance from the East Village and the Mudd Club. Through Larry Gagosian and Fred Hoffman, Basquiat rents a studio on Market Street in Venice, California, where he begins a series of paintings on wood panels, assisted by Matt Dike, a friend and Los Angeles dj. These paintings, later shown at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York, include Flexible, Water-Worshipper, and Gold Griot.\n\nBy the end of the year, Bischofberger in Switzerland is Basquiat’s only primary dealer. Problems with dealers have become a recurrent feature of Basquiat’s career.\n\nResponding to a question about whether it is harder to get along with girlfriends or dealers, Basquiat replies, “They’re about the same actually.” 42\n\nIn January, Basquiat leaves Los Angeles for Maui, Hawaii, a place that he thenceforth frequents. He rents a ranch on a remote part of the island, three hours from the airport in the town of Hana, where he sets up a studio to make drawings and paintings with materials sent from Los Angeles. In February, Paige Powell, his sister Jeanine, Nora Fitzpatrick, and Gerard Basquiat come to visit. Exceedingly generous, he also flew in what his father called “a planeload of freeloaders.43\n\nIn May, Basquiat has his first one-artist exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery. Paintings include Bird as Buddha, Brown Spots, Eye, Untitled (Africa), and Wine of Babylon. The show was met by mixed reviews.\n\n“The early work is of an original primitivism, with a graffiti heritage. The originality has quickly become stylized and somewhat self-conscious in this current show” (Donald Kuspit), 45\n\n“The young artist uses color well …. But more remarkable is the educated quality of his line and the stateliness of his compositions, both of which bespeak a formal training that, in fact, he never had” (Vivien Raynor).” 46\n\n“And throughout floated a disembodied eye, which seemed to allude both to the self-the ‘I’-and to the witness or seer. But one sensed little of what Basquiat is witness to, or of why it bears accounting” (Kate Linker). 47\n\nAlso in May, Basquiat is included in An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, which inaugurates the reopening of the museum.\n\nPictured Here: Tenor, 1985 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nAt Christie’s spring auction of contemporary paintings, a 1982 Basquiat canvas, Untitled (Skull), fetches a record $19,000. The painting had originally been purchased for $4000 the year before. Remarkable for any twenty-three-year old artist, this auction price is all the more noteworthy for an artist of color.\n\nIn August, Basquiat’s first museum exhibition opens at the The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh. Organized by Mark Francis, the exhibition surveys paintings from 1981 to 1984 and travels to the Institute for Contemporary Arts, London, and the Boymans- van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam.\n\nIn September, Basquiat’s collaborative paintings with Warhol and Clemente are shown at the Galerie Bruno Bischofberger in Zurich. The trio had completed about fifteen paintings and this show demonstrates the degree of celebrity status and popularity that Basquiat has attained at such an early age.\n\nThough Basquiat’s acceptance within the smaller art community of people of color has not been very warm, he is included in the exhibition “Since the Harlem Renaissance: 50 Years of Afro- American Art,” organized by the Center Gallery of Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. The two works shown, Danny Rosen and Untitled, are installed in the section “Self-Taught to Neo-Expressionism,” along with the work of graffiti artists Blade, Dondi, and Futura 2000, the self-taught artists William Hawkins and Bill Traylor, and the expressionists Robert Colescott and Bob Thompson. Other artists include Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, Ed Clark, Sam Gilliam, David Hammons, Palmer Hayden, William H. Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis, Joe Overstreet, Howardena Pindell, Betye Saar, and Alison Saar.\n\nLate in 1984, Basquiat meets Jennifer Goode, sister of the owner of the New York club Area. This relationship is said to be one of the most serious romantic affairs of Basquiat’s life.\n\nBasquiat’s friends become more and more concerned about his excessive drug use. They often find Basquiat in a state of paranoia and uncharacteristically unconcerned with his appearance. Basquiat’s paranoia is also fueled by the very real threat of people stealing work from his apartment.\n\n“Many drawings were destroyed because Jean-Michel knew that people might steal them or art dealers might come and take unfinished work” (Melode Ferguson). 48\n\n“Jean-Michel called at 8:00 in the morning and we philosophized. He got scared reading the Belushi book. I told him that if he wanted to become a legend, too, he should just keep going on like he was. But actually if he’s even on the phone talking to me, he’s okay” (Andy Warhol). 49\n\nPictured Here: ‘Untitled’ Yellow Tar and Feathers, 1986 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nIn January, Basquiat has a one-artist exhibition at the Galerie Bruno Bischofberger in Zurich. Paintings shown include Max Roach, Tabac, and Zydeco.\n\nOn February 10, he appears on the cover of The New York Times magazine, posing barefoot for Cathleen McGuigan‘s extensive article,” New Art, New Money: The Marketing of American Artist.” This portrait, in comparison with the 1982 Van Der Zee photograph, arouses many questions about media hype marketing, and quality in the increasingly image-conscious art world of the 1980s, in which Basquiat proved to be a more than competent provocateur. In Van Der Zee’s frontal photograph, Basquiat comes off looking dignified, yet aggressive. In contrast, Lizzie Himmel’s photograph for The New York Times Magazine poses Basquiat with his bare foot up on a chair, coyly gazing at the viewer, the dreadlocks nicely cropped.\n\n“To be a race-identified race-refugee is to tap-dance on a tightrope, making your precarious existence a question of balance and to whom you concede a mortgage on your mind and body and lien on your soul” (Greg Tate). 50\n\nPhotograph by: Lizzie Himmel for The New York Times Magazine, 1985\n\nIn March, Basquiat has his second one-artist show at the Mary Boone Gallery. In the exhibition catalogue, Robert Farris Thompson speaks of Basquiat’s art in terms of an Afro-Atlantic tradition, a context in which this art has never been discussed. Paintings in the show include Gold Griot, Grillo, Flexible, Wicker, His Glue-Sniffing Valet, and BigJoy.\n\n“Because he is black and because he is young some critics will not be able to resist the temptation to link Basquiat to the more obvious forms of New York black and Puerto Rican street art …. In his hands black vision becomes at once private, public, didactic, playful, serious, sardonic, responsible, and, above all, deliberate …. Basquiat’s blues typography, at once interruptive and complete, makes visual black song, with equivalents to pause, shout, spacing, and breath …. Yet even here we must be wary of the claim that Basquiat signals a synthesis of the Afro-Atlantic and European artistic traditions, when his actual biography seems to speak of a graffitist sensibility of the naif that has been sophisticated by a SoHo savvy audacity” ( Robert Farris Thompson). 52\n\nIn May, on the recommendation of Henry Geldzahler, Basquiat, along with Francesco Clemente, Keith Haring, and Kenny Scharf, is commissioned to do art installations for a new club, the Palladium, on East 14th Street, opened by impressarios and Studio 54 founders, Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell. Basquiat executes two large mural-sized paintings for the Palladium’s Michael Todd Room.\n\nBasquiat’s deteriorating health becomes more noticeable, particularly the dark spots on his face. These discolorations may have been caused by the removal of his spleen, which kept his body from cleaning out the toxins from the drugs.\n\n“Jean-Michel was really upset about the spots and asked me and lots of other people for advice about dermatologists and treatments. I told him that if his blood was pure they’d go away. He thought it was sadly funny that Andy s oxidation portrait of him had given him spots like those on his face …. You can see lots of self-fulfilling prophesies in his work, or in the work of anybody whose work runs deep” (Glenn O ‘Brien). 53\n\nIn September, sixteen collaborative paintings by Basquiat and Warhol are shown at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. At Shafrazi’s suggestion the two artists pose together in boxing trunks and gloves for a poster advertising the show. Unfavorable reviews cause tension in and, ultimately, weaken the Warhol-Basquiat friendship.\n\nPictured Here: Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, 1982 © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nIn January, Basquiat travels to Los Angeles for two weeks for his last show at the Larry Gagosian Gallery. Paintings in the show include Peruvian Maid, J’s Milagro, and Link Parabole. The following month he travels to Atlanta, his first and only trip to the South, for an exhibition of his drawings at the Fay Gold Gallery.\n\n“He was very paranoid … being in the South. After much discussion, Jean-Michel did a news interview that he very much did not want to do ” (Fay Gold). 56\n\nIn August, Basquiat, accompanied by Jennifer Goode and her brother Eric, travels to Africa for the first time. He is joined there by Bruno Bischofberger, who, at Basquiat’s urging, has arranged for a show in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.\n\nRelations with Mary Boone take a turn for the worse, and by the end of the year Basquiat is again without a primary dealer in New York. Problems between the equally charismatic Basquiat and Boone have been a constant part of their two-year relationship. Bischofberger continues to represent him in Europe, while trying to arrange for another New York dealer.\n\nIn January, Basquiat has a one-artist exhibition of twelve paintings at the Galerie Daniel Templon in Paris. Some works in the exhibition are Gin Soaked Critic, Gri Gri, Mono, and Sacred Monkey.\n\nOn February 22, Andy Warhol dies. Though their friendship had suffered greatly in the last year, Basquiat appears to be devastated by this loss. Basquiat paints Gravestone, a memorial to Andy Warhol.\n\n“It put him into a total crisis …. He couldn’t even talk” (Fred Braithwaite). 59\n\n“The death of Warhol made the death of Basquiat inevitable, somehow Warhol was the one person that always seemed to be able to bring Jean- Michel back from the edge. Always when Jean-Michel was in the most trouble it seemed that Andy Warhol was the person who he would approach …. After Andy was gone there was no one that Jean-Michel was in such awe of that he would respond to” (Donald Rubell). 60\n\nPictured Here: Gravestone, 1987 Collection of Enrico Navarra © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nIn May, three large works on paper are shown at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. Through Shafrazi, Basquiat meets Vrej Baghoomian, who purchases paintings and begins acting as a dealer for Basquiat’s work.\n\nAt Baghoomian’s suggestion, Rick Prol, a painter and old friend of Basquiat’s from the East Village, becomes Basquiat’s studio assistant. Basquiat begins work on paintings intended for shows in New York, Paris, and Dusseldorf the following year.\n\nBasquiat has not had an exhibition of paintings in New York for more than a year and a half, and in January, Basquiat exhibits new paintings for one night at Baghoomian’s gallery at the Cable Building in SoHo. The paintings are those being sent to shows in Paris and Dusseldorf.\n\nBasquiat travels to Paris for his one-artist show at the Galerie Yvon Lambert. Paintings include Light Blue Movers, Riddle Me This Batman, ,,,,,,,,She Installs Confidence and Picks His Brain Like a Salad, and To Be Titled. There he meets Ouattara, a painter from the Ivory Coast residing in Paris. Ouattara invites him to come to his home in Africa after the summer. In the same month, Basquiat travels to his one-artist exhibition at the Galerie Hans Mayer in Dusseldorf.\n\nHe returns to New York for a one-artist show at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery in April. Some critics praise the work, and it seems as if Basquiat has suddenly been redeemed. Paintings include Eroica I, Eroica II, The Dingoes That Park Their Brains with Their Gum, The Mechanics That Always Have a Gear Left Over, and Riding with Death.\n\n“Basquiat’s use of line is the way he commits to record what has been seen. Whatever your point of focus, in any given moment the work is crystal clear …. His line is the product of his mental process, the active proof of the passage from inner thought to articulation” (Demosthenes Davvetas).61\n\nBasquiat has always been resistant to drug abuse treatment programs. In an apparent attempt to kick drugs, Basquiat leaves New York, stopping in Dallas and Los Angeles, on the way to his ranch in Hawaii.\n\nHe leaves Hawaii for New York at the end of June, stopping for a week in Los Angeles. Brian Williams, his former assistant in Los Angeles, remarks that Basquiat seems overwhelmingly happy and is proclaiming that he has kicked drugs for good.\n\nOn Friday, August 12, Jean-Michel Basquiat dies in his Great Jones Street loft at age twenty-seven. The autopsy report from the office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Manhattan Mortuary, lists cause of death as “acute mixed drug intoxication (opiates- cocaine).”\n\nOn August 17, a private funeral is held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on Madison Avenue and 81st Street. The funeral is attended by the immediate family and close friends, including Keith Haring, Francesco Clemente, Paige Powell, and others. Jeffrey Deitch delivers the eulogy. Basquiat is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.\n\nOn November 5, about three hundred of Basquiat’s friends and admirers attend a memorial gathering at St. Peter’s Church at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street. Music is played by Gray and others, poetry is recited, including a particulary moving reading by Suzanne Mallouk of A.R. Penck’s “Poem for Basquiat.”\n\n“Jean-Michel lived like a flame. He burned really bright. Then the fire went out. But the embers are still hot” (Fred Braithwaite). 62"
