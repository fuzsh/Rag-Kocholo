Woodward in New York Times. \"A poet of heartbreak, she writes most tellingly about the hopeless, angry passion that courts self-ruin.\" Her women are loving, but frustrated, betrayed, lonely, and struggling to escape the role society has assigned them, while her male characters are cruel, cold, drunken, and irresponsible. The divorced mother of two, O'Brien knows about struggle, heartbreak, and pain firsthand. She has used her personal experiences, especially her childhood in Ireland, as sources for many of her works, drawing on her memories to evoke the emotions of her readers. An author of novels, short stories, plays, biographies, and children's books, she is a prolific writer, often considered controversial, who appeals to many audiences.\n\nO'Brien was born in Tuamgraney, County Clare, a small, rural, devoutly Catholic village of about 200 people in the west of Ireland. Raised on a farm, she grew up in an area where everyone knew everyone else's secrets, business, and problems. She claims this has helped her in her writing, telling Amanda Smith in Publishers Weekly: \"I had sort of a limitless access to everyone's life story. For a writer, it's a marvelous chance.\" Educated first at the local national school and then in a convent, she escaped rural life by attending Pharmaceutical College in Dublin. In 1952, she eloped with Czech-Irish author Ernest Gébler. They moved first to County Wicklow, and then to London, where O'Brien has remained. They divorced after twelve years of marriage, and she raised their two sons alone.\n\nBooks were scarce in O'Brien's childhood, and it wasn't until she was in Dublin that she began to take an interest in them. Introducing James Joyce by T.S. Eliot was among her first purchases.\n\nConflict and writing seemed to go hand in hand for O'Brien throughout her career. The birth of her first published novel, The Country Girls, heralded the death of her marriage. Written at the age of twenty-six and published in 1960, The Country Girls broke new ground in Irish literature, giving a frank speaking voice to women characters. The subject matter and especially the daringly graphic sexual scenes caused this book, and the six that followed, to be banned in Ireland. The first novel in what became a trilogy, The Lonely Girl and Girls in Their Married Bliss completed the set. The three novels were collected in The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue, published in 1986.\n\nThe stories revolve around two young women, the \"country girls\" Kate and Baba, who search for love and sex in a series of tragicomic adventures after being expelled from their convent school. Kate Brady, the daughter of a drunken father, was raised in poverty. She is the shy, naive but pretty woman who begins her adventure by having an affair with an older, married man. Baba Brennan, the daughter of the village veterinarian, is the tough, sassy character willing to live as freely as a man. Through affairs, marriages, more affairs, children, and psychotherapy, Baba and Kate remain friends.\n\n\"Miss O'Brien's outlook is intemperate, like Irish weather. She's fond of blarney, but a bleak, literary kind, more in the mood of the later Yeats than of Celtic charm,\" commented Anatole Broyard, writing in the New York Times Book Review. \"She has no patience with the ordinary, the soothing monotony of innocent small events.\" Feelings of loss, conflict, and disappointment in love pervade each novel of The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue as the girls try to reach their dreams. Village Voice contributor Terrence Rafferty observed that \"the psychological insights are sharp, the descriptions graceful and resonant\" in The Country GirlsTrilogy and Epilogue. At the conclusion of the trilogy, both women are disillusioned, neither one having reached her dreams or found love or happiness. What began in The Country Girls ends far from \"married bliss.\"\n\nO'Brien added the epilogue when the stories were released in one volume. Rafferty explained that it \"brings the story full circle, back to earth, in a tragedy that would be unbearable were it not for the exuberance of the writing, the hope engendered by language that goes on and on.\" The epilogue is presented as Baba's soliloquy, a retrospective view of both women's lives. Mourning the deceased Kate, raging against the men who took advantage or abused them in some way, blaming men for Kate's death, and remembering the happier times, Baba concludes the trilogy with emotional force.\n\nMany of O'Brien's short stories have also been assembled and published as collections, including A Fanatic Heart: Selected Stories of Edna O'Brien. Covering two decades of her career, the twenty-nine stories in this collection explore the themes of childhood, love, and loss, all from a woman's perspective. \"Most of the stories in A Fanatic Heart are set down in languorous, elegiac prose,\" commented Michiko Kakutani in the New York Times, adding that \"they're enlivened by Miss O'Brien's earthy humor and her sense of place.\" She writes of relationships, exile, and betrayal, drawing the reader in by seeming to reveal herself. Tales such as \"My Mother's Mother,\" describing the \"ghastly\" death of her grandfather one night while saying the Rosary, evoke O'Brien's native Ireland. Others explore the temptations of the flesh in strictly-reared young women, as in \"The Connor Girls,\" or contrast girls with carousing drunks, as in \"Irish Revel.\" Still others concern affairs, mental breakdown, and entrapment in bad marriages.\n\nO'Brien presents another side of Ireland in Tales for the Telling: Irish Folk and Fairy Stories, a book for children published in 1986. Twelve stories reveal a land of fairy folk, giants, castles, princes and princesses, magic, and heroes. A fierce wolf and a young boy dance to the magic tune of fife music in one tale, and another tells of a giant who betters an opponent with help from his cunning wife. O'Brien writes her stories in standard English, using the characters' conversations to express their Irish descent. Another critic, Times Literary Supplement contributor Patricia Craig, remarked that O'Brien's stories correspond rather closely to those published in Donegal Fairy Stories written by Seumas MacManus, but commented that O'Brien's tales \"are notable for their decorativeness and sturdy vocabulary.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor wrote that the \"color-rich, vigorous paintings\" by Michael Foreman complement \"a collection for the entire family [that] fires the imagination.\"\n\nO'Brien examines more than Ireland in her various writings. In two stage plays she focuses on Virginia Woolf and Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary. \"O'Brien … knows how to create climax, epiphany and incandescence by compression,\" observed Jack Kroll in Newsweek, discussing the play Virginia. The story of Woolf, one of the Bloomsbury group and a prominent literary figure, the play encompasses her life from her birth in 1882 to her suicide in 1942.\n\nMadame Bovary is similar to Virginia, particularly in its use of time and narration. O'Brien claims the title character as her own creation rather than an adaptation of Flaubert's novel. The story of love, marriage, boredom, adultery, and death by suicide, O'Brien's work, however, closely follows Flaubert's piece. The drama takes place in Emma Bovary's mind, even juggling the events as if they were really memories happening in her head, giving the audience clear access to her thoughts and emotions.\n\nWhile continuing to publish books for children, short stories, and plays, O'Brien waited ten years after Johnny I Hardly Knew You before publishing another novel. The long-awaited volume, The High Road, concerns Anna, a middle-aged, successful Irish writer recovering from the breakup of an affair. She escapes to an unidentified Spanish island, hoping to take time to write in her diary and repair her broken heart. However, she becomes involved with the other inhabitants, eventually having an affair with another woman. The story ends in tragedy, with the death of Anna's lover. Publishers Weekly contributor Sybil Steinberg called The High Road \"a disappointing narrative.\"\n\nO'Brien returns to the short story with Lantern Slides: Stories. \"Though she covers little new ground here, she also digs deeper into the old ground than ever before, unearthing a rich archeology,\" commented David Leavitt in the New York Times Book Review. The stories focus on women and their relationships—with lovers, fathers, husbands, and children. Insanity, jealousy, and fear are only some of the emotions O'Brien calls into play in her tales. In \"Brother,\" an incestuous relationship causes one woman to plot the death of her new sister-in-law. Another story explores the feelings between a mother and her son during a Mediterranean vacation in the company of his girlfriend. The title story, \"Lantern Slides,\" was highly praised by many critics, Leavitt labeling it the \"collection's masterpiece.\" Describing a birthday party held for a woman whose husband has deserted her, the tale reveals the guests individually, discussing their problems as it moves along.\n\nRegarding the whole collection, Times Literary Supplement contributor Louise Doughty praised Lantern Slides, writing that \"the same precision with which she portrays landscape is applied to human emotions; there isn't a single character in these stories who is unconvincing. O'Brien continues to display acute powers of observation in a prose that is always neat and often immaculate.\"\n\nTime and Tide features a hard-luck protagonist who faces one disaster after another. First, Nell endures physical abuse at the hands of her husband; when she summons the courage to leave him, she has to battle for custody of their two sons. Although free of her husband, Nell continues to experience tragedy: the death of a son, drug addiction, a nervous breakdown, and failed romances. \"O'Brien transforms what could have been a depressing or, at best, maudlin tale into a revelation,\" commented Gale Harris in Belles Lettres. Writing in the Times Literary Supplement, however, Patricia Craig averred that \"throughout the bulk of O'Brien's narrative, clarity gets lost in a fuzz of emotions.\" Still, Craig noted that \"parts of Time and Tide are wonderfully clear-toned and powerfully imagined.\"\n\nO'Brien's next novel, House of Splendid Isolation, departs somewhat from the author's usual terrain. The story of an IRA terrorist who takes an elderly woman hostage, the novel directly engages the contemporary political struggles in Northern Ireland. While McGeevy, the terrorist, is the character that sets the plot in motion, it is his elderly captive, Josie O'Meara, whose remembered passions and setbacks make up the heart of the story. Writing in the New York Times Book Review, John L'Heureux maintained that the novel's two distinct components are not successfully fused. \"Uncomfortable with her story of the terrorist and the lady, Ms. O'Brien seeks refuge in easy symbolism, and her art is swallowed up in rhetoric.\" Still, noted L'Heureux, O'Brien excels in portraying Josie's world: \"The author is comfortable here. She understands the blindness and desperation of these characters and she gets inside them with devastating effects.\"\n\nO'Brien's confessional tone and use of the first person in many of her novels has led to speculation concerning the distance between her life and her fiction. In the Dictionary of Literary Biography, a contributor quoted an interview between Ludovic Kennedy and O'Brien, wherein the author said her life and her work are \"quite close, but they're not as close as they seem.\" The quote continued: \"I think writing, especially semi-autobiographical writing, is the life you might have liked to have had.\" In an interview with Woodward, O'Brien concluded: \"All I know is that I want to write about something that has no fashion and that does not pander to any period or to a journalistic point of view. I want to write about something that would apply to any time because it's a state of the soul.\"\n\nO'Brien's novel Down by the River is based on the actual case of an Irish girl who became pregnant by a friend of her father, and the theme of the book is the abortion issue in Ireland. In the novel, the girl, Mary, becomes pregnant as a result of her father's sexual abuse. The story begins with the father assaulting her for the first time, an act he repeats with more frequency and violence after Mary's mother dies. After returning from London with a neighbor who helps her with the termination of her pregnancy, Mary and the friend are arrested. Her life is torn apart by politicians and anti-abortion advocates who don't know that Mary's father was responsible for the pregnancy. Jose Lanters wrote in World Literature Today that Down by the River makes the point \"about the involvement of church and state in what are often very painful and tragic personal circumstances.\"\n\nNew York Times Book Review contributor Brooke Allen called Wild Decembers a \"beautiful and lush novel.\" Joseph Brennan and his younger sister, Breege, live in a remote area of western Ireland. Joseph's mother had begged him to stay when he made one attempt at leaving, and now he and his sister live alone in Cloontha, immersed in their ancient culture and farming practices. Mick Buglar arrives from Australia to claim his inheritance, the neighboring farm. The two families have had a generational feud over grazing rights and boundaries, but the two men become friends, with Joseph teaching Mick the old ways, and Mick introducing him to modern practices, like the first tractor to be used on their mountain. Their differences surface when disputes over property rights develop, and the friendship suffers. Joseph is also upset by the relationship that is developing between Breege and Mick. Mick's fiancée, Rosemary, is waiting for him to build their home, after which she will travel from Australia, but Mick realizes she will never adapt to the desolate land. \"O'Brien's evocative prose shows the chilling hold that history and the dead clamp on the living,\" wrote Paul Gray in Time.\n\nAllen wrote that \"O'Brien's prose is her own and firmly under control, an apt instrument for the precise, poetic recollection of a distant world. With the instincts of an orchestra conductor, she builds from muted subtleties to crescendos of linguistic color.\" Allen continued that \"O'Brien is a past master at mixing up such lyrical flights with tonic doses of sexual humor. In Wild Decembers this takes the shape of two lascivious sisters, Reena and Riat, who have feathered their nest with hush money from the local men they ensnare. Reena and Rita are a little too out there, too bawdily O'Brienesque, to ring quite true in this essentially somber tale—yet who can confidently accuse any novelist of exaggeration when the truth is so often supremely bizarre?\"\n\n\"O'Brien allows the inevitable tragedy to play itself out, evincing the pity and terror of classical drama,\" noted a Publishers Weekly contributor. Molly Winans wrote in Commonweal that \"O'Brien's eye is most often trained on turbulent sorrow, and her gaze is fearless. Each character is torn so many ways.\" Winans continued: \"Breege and Bugler's love for each other is itself a question without an answer. Happiness rarely enters in, and then only tinged by dread—Bugler, already engaged to a beautiful woman, has no reason to court trouble with the immensely shy sister of a man who hates him—and still, the very existence of Breege and Bugler's love gives us hope.\" The reviewer added: \"The hope it introduces is thrilling and clean.\" Booklist contributor Grace Fill called O'Brien's writing \"dark, but not without humor, and rich in dramatic imagery of the Irish countryside, as she probes the inner landscape of the human heart.\"\n\nWorld of Hibernia contributor John McCourt wrote that in James Joyce, O'Brien \"puts her critical heritage, her vast experience as a novelist and short-story writer, and her dazzling linguistic skills to excellent use in this biography, which will be remembered for its panache, verve, readability, and its humane understanding of Joyce and of the Irish world that formed him.\" Booklist contributor Mary Carroll noted that O'Brien \"also provides thoughtful appreciations of Joyce's major works.\" Contemporary Review contributor John McGurk commented that O'Brien reveals \"Joyce's love/hate relationship with Dublin and Ireland, with the ‘Rock of Rome,’ the English Crown, the legal profession: and between home and exile, then his other innermost conflicts between lust and love; order and chaos, family restrictions and the free-booting spirit at odds with the tenacity with which he pursued his life as a writer.\"\n\nNew York Times Book Review contributor Robert Sullivan called James Joyce \"a hardheaded hagiography in which [O'Brien] spends a lot of time knocking Joyce around, especially the early Joyce, the Joyce who would run into you at the pub, go on about his imminent greatness, pity you, and then hit you up for a couple of quid on his way out.\" \"After she's roughed Joyce up,\" wrote Sullivan, \"she raises his hand in the air and proclaims him a genius.\" Sullivan added: \"Not since Anthony Burgess has anyone so gorgeously sung such praise for a man whose work, let's face it, can seem incomprehensible to the noninfatuated.\" Sullivan continued: \"The chapters on Ulysses and then Finnegan's Wake are explanatory marvelings at the respective books' literary merits but also at Joyce's obsession with his craft, in the face of every conceivable obstacle.\" Sullivan went on to note that \"O'Brien's triumph is that while celebrating Joyce and his ecstatic quest to lay image on counterimage … she has drawn the desperation and sadness of the man whose name means joy.\"\n\nIn her 2002 novel, In the Forest, the author tells a fictionalized version of the real life murder of a County Clare priest, mother, and her young children. The itinerant who committed the murders said he was following the instructions of the devil. In O'Brien's novel, the murderer is Michen O'Kane, who begins going to the forest at an early age as a refuge from his violent father. When his mother dies, O'Kane feels abandoned and alone and, as a ten-year-old, steals a gun which he calls Rod and cuddles for safety. O'Kane's life goes from bad to worse as he is sent to institutions and suffers abuse. Eventually O'Kane abducts Father John, an attractive woman named Eily, and her child. The readers follow the story as the Father John and Eily try to reach O'Kane's sanity only to fail as O'Kane succumbs to his madness. A contributor to the Economist noted that the author \"will not let us see these people as symbolic victims,\" adding: \"We are offered details of their lives that remind us constantly of their humanity.\" Commenting on the novel in an interview with Robert McCrum for the Observer of Manchester, England, O'Brien noted: \"Ostensibly it's about a triple murder in a forest, but I believe that the novelist is the psychic and moral historian of his or her society. So it's about that part of Ireland I happen to know very well. It's about that part of Ireland, and the darkness that still prevails.\"\n\nOnce again, O'Brien received high praise for her novel and writing abilities. Nola Theiss, writing in Kliatt, commented that the author \"captures the essence of the Irish countryside and people in a way reminiscent of James Joyce.\" Library Journal contributor Starr E. Smith noted that O'Brien's \"skillful narration keeps the pace at page-turning level as the frightening events proceed to their inevitable … conclusion.\"\n\nO'Brien's next book, The Light of Evening, was called \"a novel of powerful, complicated emotions and rapturous writing\" by a Kirkus Reviews contributor. Once again, the author draws from real life, this time the life of her mother and her own life. The novel tells the story of an Irish woman named Dilly as she lays in her hospital awaiting the arrival of her famous daughter, who is a controversial writer. \"In The Light of Evening [O'Brien] has taken the letters her late mother wrote to her over the course of her life and spliced them almost verbatim into a fictional story,\" noted John Freeman in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The novel follows Dilly as she recalls her life, from going to New York to be a maid to her return to Ireland and complicated relationship with her daughter. Eleanora, the daughter, must also come to terms with her own role in the strained relationship she has had with her mother due to Eleanora's myopic dedication to her writing. \"It is no easy task to write a novel about the bravery and nobility of novel-writing,\" wrote Tom Deignan in America. \"O'Brien, however, is able to pull this off.\" Brad Hooper, writing in Booklist, noted the author's \"deft, poised, and compassionate fashioning of her chief character.\"\n\nO'Brien has also continued to write plays, including Triptych, which was produced at the Irish Repertory Theater in New York in 2004. The play revolves around a successful playwright and three women in his life: his wife, daughter, and mistress. \"In depicting these women, with their intricate connections, the towering figure of the man takes shape,\" noted Irene Backalenick writing in Back Stage. \"Here is the man you love to hate … brilliant, seductive, demanding, self-centered.\" Variety contributor Dennis Harvey noted that the play \"has streaks of brash humor.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nConcise Dictionary of British Literary Biography, Volume 8: Contemporary Writers, 1960-Present, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1992.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 3, 1975, Volume 5, 1976, Volume 8, 1978, Volume 13, 1980, Volume 36, 1986, Volume 65, 1991.\n\nContemporary Novelists, 6th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 14: British Novelists since 1960, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1983.\n\nEckley, Grace, Edna O'Brien, Bucknell University Press (Lewisburg, PA), 1974.\n\nFeminist Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nStaley, Thomas F., editor, Twentieth-Century Woman Novelists, Barnes & Noble (Totowa, NJ), 1982.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerica, April 15, 1995, Ron Hansen, review of House of Splendid Isolation, p. 35; October 4, 1997, Thomas H.
