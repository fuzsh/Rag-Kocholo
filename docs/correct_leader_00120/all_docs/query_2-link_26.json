        "text": "Land and Climate\n\nPortugal occupies about one-sixth of the Iberian Peninsula, a piece of land in southwestern Europe. Spain, Portugal’s neighbor to the east and north, occupies the rest of the peninsula. On the west and south Portugal faces the Atlantic Ocean. This maritime location has been one of the factors of the country’s destiny, for the sea dominates much of Portuguese life. The Azores and the Madeira islands are also part of Portugal. These autonomous, or self-governing, regions of Portugal lie far off the mainland, in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe country’s main rivers flow generally from east to west, from Spain to the Atlantic. The Tagus River divides Portugal roughly in half. North of the Tagus the land is quite hilly, especially north of the Douro River. The northern half of Portugal has most of the country’s mountains, including the Estrela Mountains (Serra da Estrela). The Estrela Mountains rise to some 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) at the highest point in mainland Portugal. (The Ponta do Pico volcano, on Pico Island in the Azores, reaches the highest elevation on Portuguese soil, rising to 7,713 feet, or 2,351 meters.) Between the Tagus and Douro rivers, there is a coastal plain. South of the Tagus the land generally lies below 600 feet (180 meters). The region is best described as a gently rolling landscape. The southernmost part of the country is known as the Algarve.\n\nThe Douro River reaches the sea at Porto (Oporto), while the Tagus River descends to Lisbon—both key urban centers of modern Portugal. Other rivers that reach the coast include the Mondego, Sado, and Guadiana.\n\nPortugal has a Mediterranean climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. Its temperatures and rainfall reflect the influence of the sea. Northern Portugal has temperatures in the 40s F (about 4 to 9 °C) in the winter and the 70s F (about 21 to 26 °C) in the summer. Its rainfall averages 35 inches (89 centimeters) per year. In contrast, southern Portugal has a climate resembling that of the Costa del Sol region of southern Spain, with winter temperatures in the 50s F (about 10 to 15 °C) and summers near 80 °F (27 °C). In southern Portugal the rainfall is lower than in the northern part of the country—20 inches (51 centimeters)—and the summers are very dry.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nRoughly two-fifths of Portugal’s land area is covered by forests. Wooded areas lie mostly in the northern highlands. The trees are typically oak, chestnut, and pine. Bush and grasslands are found in the south. Olive trees once extended into the north but are now generally limited to elevations below 1,200 feet (400 meters). Nature parks, reserves, and other protected areas have been established throughout much of the country.\n\nThe countryside is home to such animals as foxes, rabbits and hares, wild goats, wild pigs, and deer. Wolves are found in remote areas of the north. Portugal has a great variety of birds. The peninsula lies on the winter migration route of bird species from western and central Europe. Fish, especially the European sardine, are plentiful in the Atlantic waters of mainland Portugal. Larger fish, such as tuna and mullet, are caught off the Azores and the Madeiras.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nEastern Portugal is generally rugged, barren, and sparsely populated. Greater concentrations of people are found in the mountainous northwest and in the coastal plains of central and southern Portugal. Most of the population lives in urban areas. Population growth is low relative to other countries in western Europe. This is due in part to the country’s high rate of emigration (people leaving the country to live elsewhere) but also can be ascribed to a fairly low birth rate.\n\nEthnicity, Language, and Religion\n\nMore than nine-tenths of the country’s people are ethnically Portuguese. There are small groups of Brazilians, Han Chinese, and Africans. There are also small numbers of Roma (Gypsies) and ethnic Marranos (descendants of Jews who converted to Christianity to escape persecution but who secretly practiced Judaism). Language is a common bond. Portuguese, the official language, is spoken by nearly everyone.\n\nChristians (mainly Roman Catholics) constitute by far the largest religious community in Portugal. Islam is followed by a small portion of the population. There is also a very small Jewish population, based mostly in Lisbon.\n\nCultural Life\n\nPortugal’s daily cultural life centers on the home and family. The great majority of people are practicing Roman Catholics, so the church is also a center of religious and cultural activity. People tend to gather in the evening in cafés, where entertainers sing melancholy folk songs called fados. Another traditional cultural event is bullfighting. In Portuguese bullfighting the matadors (main bullfighters) are on horseback and the bulls are not slaughtered in the ring, as is the common practice in Spain (though they are usually killed backstage after the fight). The most popular Portuguese national sport is soccer (association football). The sport evokes intense emotion. Portugal’s national team is among the world’s finest and has included such renowned players as Eusebio and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe most significant cultural achievements of the past date from the 15th and 16th centuries. In that period The Lusiads, the finest works in Portuguese literature, were written by Luís de Camões. A distinctive architectural style—the Manueline—emerged in the ornate monasteries and cathedrals of Belém and Coimbra. The noted paintings of Nuno Gonçalves also date from that era.\n\nModern Portuguese fiction has generally taken two forms: one with regional overtones and the other stark realism. The latter group includes fictional studies of Portuguese rural life typified in works by José Maria de Eça de Queirós, Eugénio de Castro, and Miguel Torga. Regionally oriented fiction has depicted life in Brazil, the Azores, and East Africa. Admired novelists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries included Almeida Faria, José Cardoso Pires, António Lobo Antunes, and José Saramago. Saramago won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998. Fernando Pessoa was an important Portuguese modernist poet of the early 20th century. Lyric poetry remains of great significance today. Abstract painting and sculpture have a strong following.\n\nLisbon, the capital, is Portugal’s largest city as well as a major commercial and cultural center. Lisbon was almost destroyed by an earthquake in 1755, but remnants of the earlier era are still charming tourist attractions. Lisbon’s Calouste Gulbenkian Museum is considered by many to be Portugal’s best museum. It features a vast collection of ancient and modern art. The historic center of Porto, the country’s second largest city, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996. The city of Braga, in the north, is a leading religious center. Thousands make an annual pilgrimage to Braga’s church of Bom Jesus do Monte, a Roman Catholic shrine.\n\nEducation and Social Welfare\n\nPortugal’s literacy rate is high. More than 95 percent of the people age 15 and over can read and write. Education is compulsory (required) between the ages of 6 and 18. Enrollment is good, but there is a high dropout rate. There are many opportunities for higher education, including universities and technical schools. The University of Coimbra is Portugal’s oldest university. It was originally founded in Lisbon in 1290 but was relocated permanently to Coimbra in 1537. Among other institutions of higher learning are the University of Lisbon and the University of Porto, both founded in 1911.\n\nThe Portuguese welfare system provides sickness and disability benefits, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions. A major reform of the health care system was undertaken in the early 21st century with the goal of reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Portugal has both public and private hospitals. Major hospitals are generally located in the main district capitals. Other hospitals and medical facilities are found in smaller population centers.\n\nEconomy\n\nFrom the 15th through the 18th century, Portugal’s colonial empire made the country one of the world’s wealthiest. However, failure to invest in its domestic infrastructure by the 19th century led to a long decline in the national economy. By the 20th century, Portugal was among the poorest countries in western Europe. Portugal’s membership in the European Community (now the European Union) from 1986, however, largely contributed to strong and steady economic increases during the late 20th century. Economic growth improved living standards dramatically, raised incomes, and reduced unemployment.\n\nToday, the Portuguese economy is dominated by the service sector, including tourism and trade. Manufacturing industries account for a smaller but significant share of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), the total value of goods and services produced in a year.\n\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fishing\n\nThe role of agriculture became greatly reduced in the late 20th century. It now accounts for only a very small portion of the GDP and employs less than one-tenth of the labor force. About one-fifth of the land in Portugal is arable, or fit for raising crops. The remainder is handicapped by steep slopes, infertile soils, and, in the south, by low and irregular precipitation. Tomatoes and other types of produce are important crops, as are grains such as corn (maize) and wheat. Portugal is one of the world’s leading wine producers. Its best-known wine export is port, which is produced mainly in the Douro Valley. Olive oil is also a leading food export. Such fruits as apples, pears, and peaches are raised in the north, while oranges are grown in the warmer south. Limited amounts of these fruits are exported.\n\nLivestock production is also important. Sheep, pigs, cattle, and chickens are among the country’s leading livestock.\n\nMost of the mountainous areas are well suited to forestry. The pulp and paper industry contributes significantly to the economy. Portugal is also a leading producer of cork, which has become a significant export.\n\nFishing is a centuries-old component of the economy. The waters off of Portugal’s long coastline hold an abundance of species. The most commercially important include cod, sardines, and hake. However, the total catch is small relative to other coastal countries. Much of the fish consumed in Portugal is imported.\n\nIndustry\n\nManufacturing is a major sector of the economy. The most important items produced include machinery and transport equipment, textiles and clothing, shoes, processed foods and beverages, ceramics, and metals. Petroleum refining and the production of wood and paper products, chemicals, and electronics are also important. Some components of the manufacturing sector, notably heavy industry, became nationalized (government owned) in 1975. However, after reforms in the late 1980s nearly all the publicly owned industries were sold to private owners.\n\nMined resources include tungsten, tin, copper, and coal. Marble is quarried and exported in great quantity. Portugal imports most of its energy supplies. It depends heavily on petroleum, petroleum products, and coal. In the early 21st century, however, the country began increasing its use of renewable energy sources, including wind power, solar power, and waterpower.\n\nServices\n\nThe service sector employs more than two-thirds of the workforce and contributes about three-quarters of the GDP. Tourism is a key component of the service industry. Portugal’s popularity as a vacation destination ensures millions of visitors each year.\n\nPortugal’s role in world trade stretches back several centuries. Today, the sector is a vital component of the economy. Among the top exports are automobiles, parts, and other transport equipment; textiles, apparel, and footwear; refined petroleum; and wood products. Machinery, crude and refined petroleum, natural gas, and medicine are among the key imports. Spain, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands are some of Portugal’s most important trade partners.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nThe country’s transportation system, much neglected during the 20th century, has been greatly improved. A four-lane superhighway connects Lisbon with Porto. Other highways link Lisbon with Madrid, Spain, and with the Algarve. The rail network has also been updated and expanded. There are international airports at Lisbon, Porto, and Faro (a city in the Algarve) and in Madeira and the Azores. Portugal also has numerous domestic airfields.\n\nPortugal’s ports have received considerable investment to improve and expand their ability to handle cargo and containers and to provide other services. Major Portuguese ports include Lisbon, Porto, and Setúbal. River transport includes both pleasure cruisers and commercial barges.\n\nThe telecommunications system is growing. The number of Internet users today includes about four-fifths of the Portuguese population, and there are now more cell phone subscriptions than there are people in Portugal. The government operates a national television network and several radio networks. There are also many privately owned television and radio stations.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly History\n\nPeople have been living in the Iberian Peninsula—which includes what are now Portugal and Spain—since long ago in prehistory. However, the first identifiable culture dates to about 5500 bc. The peninsula is named for a prehistoric people, the Iberians, who lived there. In the 1st millennium bc peoples known as Celts migrated to the peninsula. As a result of intermarriage and assimilation with the Iberians, “new” Celts emerged whom scholars term the Lusitani.\n\nRome conquered the Iberian Peninsula in the 2nd century bc. Lusitani tribes had battled the Romans for generations before being incorporated into the empire. Roman rule progressively rose and declined over the next six centuries.\n\nUltimately the region was abandoned to Germanic tribes. These tribes ruled until the Muslim invasion of ad 711, which left only northern Portugal under Christian rule. In 1139 Afonso Henriques established a Portuguese kingdom and began taking areas from Muslim control. He ruled as Afonso I. Forty years later, in 1179, Pope Alexander III recognized the new state. The boundaries of modern continental Portugal were completed under the fifth Portuguese king, Afonso III, who reigned from 1248 until his death in 1279.\n\nThe Portuguese Empire\n\nPortugal’s position on the Atlantic Ocean gave it an advantage when Europe began searching for new routes to the East. What has been called the Age of Discovery began in the 15th century with the support of Prince Henry of Portugal and later continued under King John II. Explorers who sailed under Portuguese patronage included Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama, who pioneered routes around Africa to Asia.\n\nBeginning in the 16th century, Portugal amassed a huge empire in Africa, South America, and Asia—an overseas empire about 23 times the size of the home country. In addition to the Azores and the Madeiras (now autonomous regions of Portugal), the empire included the African colonies of Angola, Cabo Verde, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau), and Sao Tome and Principe. The empire also included Brazil, now the largest country in Latin America. Also part of the empire were eastern Timor (now East Timor), in Southeast Asia; the peninsula of Macau, on China’s southern coast; and the little colonies of Goa, Daman, and Diu, on India’s western coast.\n\nThe House of Bragança\n\nIn 1580 the Portuguese royal family died out. Philip II of Spain had his forces occupy the country. He was soon accepted as Philip I of Portugal. He and his successors ruled Portugal until 1640 amid gradually increasing resentment. Finally, while Spain was embroiled in war with France, Portugal threw off the Spanish yoke. John, duke of Bragança, was selected to become the new king. He was crowned as John IV on December 15, 1640. The house of Bragança remained on the throne of Portugal until 1910, though its hold on power was frequently challenged.\n\nPortugal forged a new and enduring alliance with England that lasted through the Napoleonic era in the early 19th century. Throughout much of this time Portugal’s security was difficult to maintain, because its two allies—France and England—were often at war with each other. Difficulties were greatest during the Napoleonic Wars, which devastated much of Portugal. When Napoleon’s armies overran the Iberian Peninsula in 1807, they forced the Portuguese royal family, including the future king John VI, to flee to Brazil. The Peninsular War lasted until 1814, when the British commander Arthur Wellesley (later the duke of Wellington) finally defeated the French armies. John VI returned to Portugal in 1821. Brazil declared its independence a year later, ending Portuguese power in Latin America.\n\nBy 1892 Portugal had been plunged into bankruptcy. Internal conflict led to the assassination of King Carlos I and his eldest son, Luis, in 1908. Two years later Carlos’s successor, Manuel II, was forced to step down, and Portugal was proclaimed a republic.\n\nDictatorship and Military Rule\n\nCivil strife nevertheless persisted until 1926, when a military dictatorship gained control in Portugal. António de Oliveira Salazar became premier in 1932. With the establishment of his “new state” in 1933, he was given dictatorial powers. Salazar ruled Portugal for 36 years.\n\nWhen Salazar became ill in 1968, he was replaced by another dictator, Marcello Caetano, who was himself overthrown in a military coup on April 25, 1974. The new president, General António de Spínola, pledged to start the process of giving up control of Portugal’s colonies. Soon the colonies were abandoned, one by one. Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau) became independent in 1974. Angola and the other African colonies followed in 1975. Macau, Portugal’s last remaining overseas territory, was officially returned to China in 1999.\n\nTransition to Civilian Rule\n\nAfter two years of military rule, a new constitution was adopted in April 1976 that committed Portugal to socialism. Free elections were held that year. Mário Soares, leader of the center-left Socialist Party, became prime minister (and later served as president).\n\nAs Portugal transitioned to full civilian rule, two political parties became dominant: the Socialist Party and the center-right Social Democratic Party. The Social Democrats held power, with Aníbal Cavaco Silva as prime minister, from 1985 to 1995. In 1989 the constitution was revised to remove socialist elements. After the Socialists won the 1995 elections, António Guterres became prime minister.\n\nPortugal, along with Spain, joined the European Community (now the European Union) in 1986. The results were a strong expansion of the economy, boosted by strong consumer spending, investment, and privatization of businesses.\n\nThe 21st Century\n\nAntónio Guterres stepped down as prime minister in late 2001 following the massive defeat of Socialist Party candidates in local elections that year. José Manuel Barroso of the Social Democratic Party succeeded Guterres in 2002. In 2004 Barroso resigned from office to accept the post of president of the European Commission, the main executive body of the European Union. The Socialists returned to power in 2005.\n\nSupport for the Socialists eroded as Portugal struggled during the global economic downturn that began in 2007. Government efforts to stimulate the economy caused the budget deficit to skyrocket. The government eventually reached an agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for Portugal to receive a bailout worth some $116 billion. Pedro Passos Coelho, leader of the Social Democrats, became prime minister in 2011. The country emerged from a prolonged recession three years later.\n\nAntónio Costa, a former mayor of Lisbon, headed a Socialist-led coalition government from 2015. As prime minister, Costa focused much of his efforts on fostering economic growth. In October 2016 the United Nations General Assembly elected former prime minister Guterres to serve as UN secretary-general. Guterres’s term began on January 1, 2017.\n\nIn 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic began to disrupt life in Portugal, as it did elsewhere around the world. Over the next two years the country experienced several waves of COVID-19 cases and recorded more than 25,000 COVID-19-related deaths. Costa’s government earned praise for a highly successful vaccination drive that began in early 2021. By the end of the year, Portugal had one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the world, with more than 85 percent of its mainland population fully vaccinated against the virus. Costa’s Socialist Party secured an absolute majority in the parliament when elections were held in 2022."
