        "text": "Many stories will be told from now on about the political characteristics of Dr. Mário Soares, which, for some, will always be defects and, for others, qualities! Political struggles, economic and geostrategic decisions, national, European, Portuguese-speaking and international! There will certainly be choices for all tastes.\n\nFrom these fights, there will be many who can (and should…) write with propriety, so many were the co-protagonists of these episodes who, with him, helped to write the recent history of Portugal, where I am simply not included.\n\nHowever, even though today the editorial line of the news that comes to us daily constantly includes some news about the environment, sustainability, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, the truth is that this was not always the case!\n\nIn the long gone 90s of the last century, at the time when environmentalists were known for being ill-educated and development protesters, and the newly created Ministry of the Environment was labeled as the Ministry of No, there were so many refusals to leave destroy what was left of species and habitats across that country and that tied the progress, Dr. Mário Soares exercised his second term as President of the Republic.\n\nAnd I, who didn't think I was so rude, was one of the kids who actively collaborated in the environmental movement, at the time, at Associação Almargem, in the Algarve.\n\nIn a decision hitherto unprecedented in the area of ​​the environment, Dr. Mário Soares starts, in 1994, an open presidency – an innovation no longer abandoned by his successors – dedicated precisely to the environment!\n\nKnown that he was the most traveled president ever - it has already been noticed that Dr. Marcelo will be known for another feat, that of adding the word \"Marselfie\" to our lexicon, since at the end of the term there will hardly be a Portuguese who will not have taken a “Marselfie” – such a predilection of Dr. Mário Soares for travel continued not only abroad, but also in the real country!\n\nAnd when the royal country showed Dr. Soares the rivers and streams flooded with raw sewage and foul smelling, or the open-air dumps at the back of the slopes on the outskirts of towns and cities, Dr. Soares was not indifferent!\n\nHe was accompanied by Governors, gave a lot of writing work to the political advisers who unfolded in letters with requests for clarification and messages to the Government and listened attentively and consequently to many cries of fear and despair, from the many who suffered daily with the side. black that the heralds of development insisted on hiding and, when they couldn't, explained how the inevitable costs of progress and guaranteeing employment!\n\nThere was the curious case of having had the opportunity to follow the visit that Dr. Mário Soares made a point of including in that open presidency of 1994, to the Ria Formosa Natural Park, more precisely to the barrier islands of Culatra and of Farol (that being physically the same geological formation, a military perimeter separated into two distinct nuclei).\n\nOn that visit, many of the testimonies of inhabitants reported the despair of feeling the cracking of their homes, during the periodic and immemorial military activity of bursting out of obsolete ammunition, included in the training activities that were carried out every year off the coast. island, usually in the middle of August!\n\nTo this description, accompanied by the demonstration of walls, ceilings and roofs full of fissures, some of which included the entry of a human hand, were added the descriptions of fishermen who tried to illustrate, let us say, with much more difficulty, the desert in which the waters were transformed, in which not a single fish was caught in the weeks following such breaks! All of this elicited, from Dr. Soares's already heavy face, a reaction of astonishment and disbelief that would not let him remain indifferent!\n\nWithout the frenzy of online rights and social networks that today tell us, up to the minute, what politicians think, almost before they themselves have time to elaborate on some ideas they share – that alone explains some truly epic sharing – it took many months to hear again about this episode that had visibly disturbed the President of the Republic!\n\nDangerously earlier than usual, an alarm sounds loud in the Ria Formosa Natural Park! The activity of bursting obsolete ammunition that had made Dr. Mário Soares indisposed, and about which it was learned that he had given a strong note to the responsible military authorities, had been anticipated.\n\nInstead of taking place in August, in the middle of the bathing season, it was now planned to take place in June, in the most sensitive nesting season of the many birds that occupied the desert space between the Faroread the Hangars, and that in June, they would have their juveniles in their nests still too young and undeveloped to be able to undertake any reaction of flight and defense!\n\nIt was a strange decision, especially because it seemed to fulfill a will, but one that protected those who needed it least, the vacationers, while again imposing the suffering of the populations, to which the President had not been indifferent!\n\nWhen the channels were sold out diplomats and administrative between the hierarchy of the Natural Park, the Institute that supervised it and the political leaders who had received from the military the response that such a change was in line with the will expressed by the President of the Republic, continued the indignation of some more well-informed officials , who, despite their command structure, would let the matter spill over to the media.\n\nThe journalists asked the environmentalists, who at the time answered that they simply did not believe that this decision had its origin in the will of Dr. Mário Soares, even doubting that this was even known to him, so present that it had remained in my memory. his indignation at the testimonies of the populations of the Farol and the breech.\n\nWith the start date set for the last day of June 1995, the military exercise of blasting ammunition off the Farole Culatra mobilized a group of volunteers from the Almargem Association, who lined up a press release and painted a protest banner to contest, on the spot, early on, what seemed to us to be an unacceptable decision, but one that particularly angered me!\n\nThe morning broke silent on the island and the course of the day did not bring confirmation that the blasts had taken place! The strategically placed banner on the military perimeter fence didn't withstand Zebro's first pass from the military patrol, but we held our positions until around lunchtime!\n\nIn a telephone call from a café on the island to a well-known journalist, we were informed that the military denied the exercise and that the Presidency of the Republic did not talk about the matter. The lunchtime news reported on the protest, but the first statements by those responsible were evasive and contradictory. We demobilized and returned to the Association's headquarters.\n\nIn an act of daring typical of youth, we decided to call the contact we had for the Presidency of the Republic, which had been left to us the previous year, when the presidency was held open to the environment we had been following.\n\nThe advisor responsible for the environmental area, who kindly answered the phone, to our effusive expression of indignation and perplexity, responded in a sympathetic and firm manner that Mr. President had taken good note of the problem he had noticed at the site and which he had transmitted entitled that such occurrences were unacceptable. So I was sure that would not happen again. Thanks and we were expectant!\n\nThe news in the evening paper was already clear and firm, the military transmitted the decision that they would no longer blow up obsolete ammunition, whatever the time of year! Not in June, not in August!\n\nI never spoke with Dr. Mário Soares! Not about this one, not about any other subject! Later I cycled by his side during his passage through an action of the Portuguese Federation of Cycling and Bicycle Users!\n\nBut I keep this good memory of him and I believe that he was, in fact, a politician who put the environment in his priorities! Portugal won with it! I at least owe you a thank you!"
