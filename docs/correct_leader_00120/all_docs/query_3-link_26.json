        "text": "A lit cigarette opens RTP’s broadcast on the 6th of November, 1975. José Megre welcomes the viewers to the first debate televised live for the entire country. On one side, Mário Soares, general secretary of Partido Socialista; on the other side, Álvaro Cunhal, general secretary of Partido Comunista Português.\n\nThe debate would make History on Portuguese television, not only for being the first one, but also because of its length. For three and a half hours, Joaquim Letria and José Megre moderated the talk on the TV show Responder ao País. A format that would be impossible to repeat nowadays.\n\nBut the exchange got heated pretty quickly. What started as simple questions from the journalists escalated to a verbal battle. When Mário Soares accused his opponent of wanting to install a dictatorship in Portugal, the answer “olha que não, olhe que não!” (“look, it isn’t so, look, it isn’t so!”) would be forever remember by the Portuguese – and leave its mark in the Portuguese political vocabulary.\n\nThe studio and the tables did little to improve the aesthetics of the background, and the political speeches lacked brilliance – and soundbites.\n\nThe context? The so-called “Verão Quente” (“Heated Summer”) of 1975 had just ended, at a time when society was radicalised between left and right. In the aftermath of the revolution on the 25th of April, Portugal lived a troubled political moment, marked by successive interim governments and streets in ongoing turmoil.\n\nIt all started on the 11th of March, 1975, when parachuting troops linked to general Spínola attacked Regimento de Artilharia Ligeira (RAL1), in Lisbon.\n\nThe goal? To stop the operation “Matança da Páscoa”, an alleged far left wing coup in Portugal.\n\nAfter a few hours of tensions which caused a dead soldier, Spínola’s coup would fail, leading him o exile. The most heated summer in the history of Portuguese politics was about to start.\n\nThe facilities are occupied and, on the outside, PS organises a demonstration, showing support to the former administration. Concentration rises and tensions can be felt.\n\nAnthems are sung and words of order are uttered against the “occupiers” of the building, against PCP, against Álvaro Cunhal and against MFA. The newspaper is closed for good.\n\nPS leaves the government, joined soon after by PPD/PSD, causing the fall of IV Governo Provisório (IV Interim Government) on the 17tg of July, 1975.\n\nTwo days later, PS organizes the Fonte Luminosa rally, what became one of Soares’ toughest speeches against PCP.\n\nOn the 8th of August, the V Interim Government is born, the las tone led by Vasco Gonçalves. The period that would become undoubtedly known as “gonçalvismo” became another important mark.\n\nDiário de Notícias’ administration is altered and Luís de Barros is named director and José Saramago assistant-director of the newspaper. A number of journalisms question the ideological orientation of a newspaper that was supposedly being manipulated in favor of Partido Comunista Português.\n\nThe administration was, then, handed a petition which defended the revision of the editorial orientation and demands its publication. One day later, the document was published by Expresso and had been sent to BBC. This action would result in the suspension of 24 journalists, which would become forever known as “saneamento dos 24” (“riddance of the 24”).\n\nLater on, on the 19th of September, 1975, the VI Interim Government, led by Pinheiro de Azevedo, takes office.\n\nOn the 29th of September, in an “emergency measure” taken by the Government, the studios of a number of radios and RTP were occupied in an attempt to avoid the “state of emergency” in the country.\n\nHowever, difficulties with the Media would still arise later, when the newsroom of the newspaper O Século starts an ideological debate.\n\nTwo groups oppose each other: one linked to Partido Comunista Português (PCP) and the other to Movimento Reorganizativo do Partido do Proletariado (MRPP), which ends up in an internal referendum, which decided the dismissal of the director Adelino Tavares da Silva and deputy head Joaquim Benite.\n\nThe decision doesn’t please a lot of people and ends up leading to the departure of sixteen members of that outlet.\n\nTensions were far from over. On the 9th of November, a demonstration of support to the VI Interim Government, promoted by Partido Popular Democrático (PPD) and by Partido Socialista (PS) at Terreiro do Paço, in Lisbon.\n\nThe explosion of tear gas that was felt in the middle of the protest caused panic and led to the famous sentenced uttered by Pinheiro de Azevedo: “There’s no danger. People are calm, listen. It’s only smoke”.\n\nThe next day, construction industry workers started a strike and got together next to Assembleia Constituinte. The protesters, who aimed to pressure the Government until a favorable deal was accepted, didn’t allow for the deputies to leave the building.\n\nThe most famous siege in the History of Portuguese politics had begun.\n\nOnly in the early hours of the 14th did the union leaders and Pinheiro de Azevedo reach an agreement. The Prime Minister compromised to enforce the Contrato Coletivo de Trabalho (Collective Contract of Work) from the 27th of November on.\n\nPeople would remember Pinheiro de Azevedo’s words while leaving the Assembly: “I don’t like to be kidnapped, it’s something that bothers me”."
