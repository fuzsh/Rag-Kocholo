        "text": "Portugal on Thursday will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the \"Carnation Revolution,\" an almost bloodless revolution that took place on April 25, 1974, ending 48 years of a fascist dictatorship.\n\nREAD MORE: Carnation Revolution commemorative events in Massachusetts. Here’s all the details\n\nA group of military captains planned the coup that toppled the regime, which was helmed by dictator António Oliveira Salazar from 1932 to 1968. It only crumbled four years after his death with the \"Carnation Revolution\".\n\nIt is called the \"Carnation Revolution\" because soldiers placed blossoms in the barrels of their guns.\n\nREAD MORE: 50 years of the Carnation Revolution to be celebrated in New Bedford with special program\n\nThe events April 25, 1974 led to the return of Communist Party leader Álvaro Cunhal and Socialist leader Mário Soares.\n\nThe \"Carnation Revolution\" also led to the collapse of Portuguese colonial rule overseas, notably in Africa, where wars against national liberation movements had exhausted the military and drained state coffers.\n\nGeneral António de Spinola, one of the heroes of the 1974 revolution in Portugal, became the first president after the revolution but he only remained in office for five months as the country became increasingly unstable as the left tried to gain ground.\n\nREAD MORE: UMD conference explores how Portugal’s revolution changed the diaspora and the world\n\nOne of the main factors generating instability after the revolution was the splits that emerged in the different military units with some, particularly the Lisbon garrison, strongly favoring the left.\n\nThe centralized military command COPCON, led by General Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, was created in July 1974 with the aim of maintaining order. It was dissolved after the failed far left coup of November 25, 1975.\n\nBy the time Socialist leader Mário Soares was elected in 1976, Portugal was in a state of almost chronic disorder with frequent confrontations between communist and anti-communist groups.\n\nTHIS REUTERS VIDEO COMPILATION CONTAINS:\n\n1. Troops standing around armored car in square as a military coup without bloodshed took place, toppling Marcelo Caetano and his cabinet and making General António de Spinola the country’s new leader.\n\n2. Various of troops on armored vehicles driving through streets , some officers holding carnations, and crowd and soldiers watching.\n\n3. Civilians in lorries driving by square, general view of square with troops and crowd.\n\n4. People in square as soldiers speak from top of lorry.\n\n5. Various of people on lorry and packing street.\n\n6. Troops on lorry passing through crowd.\n\n7. Jubilant soldiers on lorry driving through square.\n\n8. Military ship in Tagus River.\n\n9. Various of troops and civilians at square.\n\nGeneral António de Spinola was the hero of the 1974 revolution in Portugal and first president of the new regime. He lasts five months in office and finally goes into exile in Brazil. His Prime Minister, Colonel Vasco Gonçalves, survives more than a year at the head of an increasingly left-dominated government.\n\n10. General António de Spinola leaving building and walking inside car.\n\n11. Colonel Vasco Gonçalves who was going to be Spinola's prime minister surrounded by media.\n\nCommunist Party leader Álvaro Cunhal and Socialist leader Mário Soares return to Portugal at the end of April 1974 after the revolution. The Communist Party is well organized under its leader, Álvaro Cunhal, who had been living in Eastern Europe, and consolidates itself in the confusion that reigns in Portugal, but never quite manages to gain power. It is Socialist leader Soares who emerges the victor when elections are held in April 1976, two years after the revolution, but popular support does not ensure him any more influence in the government.\n\n12. Crowds in stadium at Communist Party rally.\n\n13. Various of communist party leader Álvaro Cunhal at rally and people waving fists.\n\n14. Various of Portugal's Socialist Party leader at the time Mário Soares on election day.\n\nBy the time Soares is elected in 1976, Portugal is in a state of almost chronic disorder with confrontations between communist and anti-communist troops. Troops are called out to break up a demonstration organized by Maoists near Lisbon, who demand the release of political prisoners. Cunhal is trapped in the fighting for four hours until he was rescued by troops.\n\n15. Protesters running troops dispersing demonstrators and firing rifles into the air.\n\n16. Crowds chanting at Communist Rally.\n\n17. Anti-Communist militants attacking Communist rally and premises.\n\n18. Injured man.\n\n19. Cunhal looking.\n\n19. Cunhal looking.\n\n20. Various of demonstrators throwing things from building and setting fire in the street.\n\nCommunist printers occupy the premises of the independent pro-Socialist newspaper República. Protests are triggered by the government's decision to close it down. The protests don't only come from the Socialists, but also from abroad due to the threat to press freedom.\n\n21. Various of headquarters of newspaper \"República\" occupied by communist demonstrators and troops guarding entrance.\n\nOne of the chief complicating factors in the Portuguese political situation after the revolution are the splits that emerge in the different units with some, particularly the Lisbon garrison, strongly favoring the left. COPCON, led by General Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho is created in July 1974. The centralized military command encompasses all the special units of the Armed Forces with the objective to maintain order. It was dissolved after the failed far left coup of November 25, 1975.\n\n22. Military facility entrance.\n\n23. General Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho arriving at a facility.\n\n24.
