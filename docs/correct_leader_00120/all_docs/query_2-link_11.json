        "text": "MÃ¡rio Soares fought against the Portuguese dictatorship from a very young age. He became involved in opposition movements, joined the Portuguese Communist Party, wrote and co-signed the main manifestos against the regime, took active part in the candidacies of Norton de Matos and Humberto Delgado for the Presidency of the Republic, was founder and leader of AcÃ§Ã£o Socialista Portuguesa (Portuguese Socialist Action) and of the Socialist Party and, in the ranks of the democratic opposition, was a candidate for the legislative elections.\n\nFor all this, he was arrested 12 times, deported to the island of SÃ£o TomÃ© by order of Salazar, and became a political exile, in Paris, since 1970. The European issue was present in his thinking and reflections and was behind the battles he fought. MÃ¡rio Soares believed that the struggle for a free and democratic Portugal implied a European Portugal, the same way that the European option could not be fully materialized without fulfilling the first premise.\n\nHence his denunciation of the Portuguese authoritarian regime to the international community, particularly seeking the support of the Member States of the European Community and of the great figures of European democracies. His voice of protest and indignation against a Europe that showed complacency towards dictatorships was heard in many addresses at congresses and conferences, especially those organized under the aegis of the Socialist International, the European Socialist Parties, or the European Federalist Movement. Let us especially mention the speech he gave at the Council of Europe, in 1970, referring to the violation of human rights in Portugal, and in which he stated: âWe, as democrats, wish to join Europe â because it is in our best interest, as well as in the interest of democratic Europeâ.\n\nMÃ¡rio Soares made this position clear also in his writings, in the book Portugal AmordaÃ§ado (âPortugalâs Struggle for Libertyâ), which he published in France in 1972, and in the various articles he wrote for the national and international press. In one of those articles, which at the time was cut by the Portuguese censorship, he stated: âI am in favour of a Europe of workers, one that will have to be built gradually, by developing democracy in each European country. I believe that the correct attitude for left-wing political parties is to join the construction of Europeâ.\n\nIn 1973 he founded the Socialist Party (PS, Partido Socialista), laying down in his initial program the foundations of a European policy, choosing to get closer to Europe as an instrument to transform a country that had been living under a dictatorship for almost five decades.\n\nMÃ¡rio Soares was the first political exile to return to Portugal after the Armed Forces Movement coup that, on April 25th, 1974, toppled the dictatorship. He arrived in Lisbon on the 28th, travelling on the âfreedom trainâ, and there was a crowd waiting that greeted and cheered him.\n\nThe times that followed led Soares to assert himself more and more as a European leader, at the same time that he became the Portuguese politician with greater international recognition. After the rally that took place on the 1st of May, he was given the task of obtaining international recognition for the Portuguese revolution, by visiting the main European capitals, where he met FranÃ§ois Mitterrand, Harold Wilson, Olof Palme, Willy Brandt, Joop Den Uyl, and Trygve Bratteli.\n\nBeing appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the first three Provisional Governments (1974-1975), he developed a wide-ranging diplomatic action in order to open Portugal to the outside, establishing relations with countless countries, and started the decolonization process, for which he had fought so hard. In September 1974, speaking for the first time before the General Assembly of the United Nations, he said: âI want to make it very clear that the free and democratic Portugal we are building, with great difficulties, but encouraged by the confidence shown by our entire people, now begins to feel proudly accompaniedâ.\n\nEstablishing deeper commercial and political relations with the Member States of the European Economic Community (EEC) was a priority. Aware of the Portuguese economyâs delicate situation, Soares developed a skilful approach to the EEC, highlighting the countryâs position as a link between Europe and Africa. At the same time, the contacts established were translated into international support, particularly from European socialists to the Socialist Party, a young party still being shaped.\n\nIn a period during which in Portugal political-military clashes became more intense, MÃ¡rio Soares asserted himself as the better-known political face of the defence put up in favour of a pluralist democracy for the future of the country. He was the leader of the party that won the first free Portuguese elections â for the Constituent Assembly, on April 25th, 1975 â leaving no doubt as to where he stood, namely in the conflicts that pitted him against the Prime Minister, Vasco GonÃ§alves, and the leader of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), Ãlvaro Cunhal. The end of the revolution, on November 25th, 1975, and the institutionalization of democracy brought about the political and social conditions for MÃ¡rio Soares and the Socialist Party to place a future accession to the European Communities as a major objective.\n\nThe European option indelibly marked the Socialist Partyâs campaign for the 1976 legislative elections. Full and immediate accession to the EEC was inscribed in the âProgram for a PS Governmentâ as a fundamental and strategic goal, and the slogan created for the campaign endorsed that path: all over the country, from north to south, by the side of the roads, A Europa Connosco (âEurope with Usâ) was present in flags, posters, stickers and, above all, in speeches delivered at large rallies or improvised gatherings, but always with a high influx of people.\n\nThis strategyâs highest moment took place in March 1976 with the organization of a Summit at the Crystal Palace, in Porto, with the same motto: âEurope with Usâ. The PS meant to make Porto the socialist capital of Europe and, therefore, invited the main European socialist and social democratic leaders, who accepted the challenge. During three days, Willy Brandt, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand, Bruno Kreisky, Felipe GonzÃ¡lez, Francesco de Martino, Josep Den Uyl, Olof Palme, and Hans Janitschek addressed a pavilion completely full of people.\n\nIn a truly historic event, Portugalâs path towards the European Communities gained strength and the PS acquired a national and European recognition that let it further consolidate itself. Before the participants in the congress, Soares declared: âThe new Portugal is deeply committed to the transformation of Portuguese society on democratic and socialist bases. To rethink Portugal and its future involves rethinking the Europe which Portugal wants to join.â\n\nReturning to Portugal, MÃ¡rio Soares reported to the country that âall the misgivings put to us were more or less overcomeâ, revealing the support and understanding he had received from the various countries. There was no doubt that it was time to move forward. After presenting the results of the European rounds and obtaining the assent of the Assembly of the Republic, it was up to Prime Minister MÃ¡rio Soares to address, to the President of the Council of the European Communities, Portugalâs formal application for accession to the European Communities (ECSC, EEC and EAEC).\n\nPortugalâs application for accession to the European Communities was formally accepted on April 5th, 1977. Formal negotiations began in October 1978, a process that included Spain, since it was decided that both countries âshould join the EEC simultaneouslyâ.\n\nWork meetings followed one another, as did visits to Portugal by EEC politicians and technicians. The weak Portuguese economic development was going to be one of the most complex issues. But many other matters were the subject of intense negotiations, with particular emphasis on social issues, agriculture, fisheries or transport and infrastructures.\n\nThe negotiations calendar underwent changes, as did the estimates as to the date the process would be completed. The succeeding heads of Portuguese Governments and the holders of the Foreign Affairs portfolio multiplied the contacts with their European counterparts, trying to speed up negotiations.\n\nIn 1983, taking over again as Prime Minister (IX Government), MÃ¡rio Soares, dissatisfied with the sluggishness of the process, put pressure on the European Community to take a decision regarding Portugalâs accession.\n\nWith Jaime Gama, in his role as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and ErnÃ¢ni Lopes, as Minister for Finance and Planning, negotiations sped up and the manifold files were closed one by one. In October 1984, after the Fontainebleau Summit, MÃ¡rio Soares signed, in Dublin, the âConstat dâAccordâ that marked the end of the negotiations and ratified the date for Portugalâs accession to the EEC: January 1st, 1986. The final political agreement was reached in Brussels in March 1985. At last, the following month, at the Assembly of the Republic, the Prime Minister closed the debate on this fundamental moment of Portugalâs recent history.\n\nOn June 12th, 1985, Prime Minister MÃ¡rio Soares signed the Treaty of Accession to the EEC.\n\nConsidering the imminent fall of the Central Bloc Government (PS plus PSD, the Social Democratic Party), the Portuguese political situation was very instable. Although the date of the ceremony had already been set, it only became effectively possible after conducting negotiations with the newly elected leader of the PSD, AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva, who wanted a postponement. In the end, the Social-Democratic ministers accepted to tender their resignations only the day after the signing. Thus, Portugalâs Treaty of Accession â together with that of Spain â was signed on the scheduled day.\n\nThe signing ceremony was held at the JerÃ³nimos Monastery, after a welcoming session at the Tower of BelÃ©m and another session to present greetings to the President of the Republic. The EEC delegation consisted of its President, Jacques Delors, Commissioner Lorenzo Natali, Secretary-General Emile Noel and other figures.\n\nThe treaty was signed by Prime Minister MÃ¡rio Soares, Deputy Prime Minister Rui Machete, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jaime Gama, and the Minister for Finance and Planning, ErnÃ¢ni Lopes.\n\nIt was an historic moment for both Portugal and Europe, as laid down by MÃ¡rio Soaresâ speech: âI am honoured to have been the one to sign, on behalf of the Government of the Republic, Portugalâs application for accession to the EEC, in March 1977. Eight years later, after closing the negotiation process, which was lengthy and difficult, but that, as everyone recognizes, was successful, I now have the historic opportunity to sign the Treaty of Accession. We did it!â\n\nMÃ¡rio Soares was elected President of the Republic in 1986. He monitored the process of Portugalâs integration into the European Communities, intervening at crucial moments to uphold his political vision of Europe, often as a counterbalance to the ideas of the contemporary Government, which he thought was too concerned with economic aspects.\n\nSoares continually insisted that Portugal would have to be a key player in Europe, alongside the other Member States. A voice heard and respected, that contributed to the development of the European project. He underlined his idea of ââPortugalâs original contribution to the European Union: a dual and reciprocal role as Europeâs link with Brazil and with Portuguese-speaking African countries, but also as Europeâs representative to all those countries.\n\nIn MÃ¡rio Soaresâ thinking, the Europe of freedom, equality and fraternity was always present, a Europe of citizens, culture and critical thinking, values ââthat he proclaimed in successive public speeches and by assuming and performing various offices. He was Chairman of the Committee of Wise Persons of the Council of Europe, Member of the European Parliament and President of the European Movement International, he defended a federalist Europe and the proposal of a European Constitution.\n\nSoares wrote, thought and debated about Europe until the end of his life. In recent years he was very critical and disenchanted with the European project, considering that it had been captured by neoliberal doctrines, and was no longer a project centred on freedom, unity and solidarity. He believed that this was destroying Europe and that it jeopardized democracy itself, and therefore it was necessary to recover the roots that presided over the creation of the European Community and its foundersâ ideals.\n\nHe always believed in Europe as the future: âIn the face of difficulties, we must defend more Europe. (...) Let us promote the âEurope of Citizensâ and the âSocial Europeâ, insisting on the reform and improvement of the European social model, as one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century that cannot be called into question, in the 21st century, by dubious economic criteriaâ."
