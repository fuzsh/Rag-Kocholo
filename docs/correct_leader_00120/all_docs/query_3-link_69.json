        "text": "In 1974, Portugal’s Carnation Revolution, which overthrew the country's almost half-century dictatorship, inaugurated the “third wave” of global democratization.\n\nThe “first wave” began with the American and French revolutions, and 29 countries became democracies in the period up to 1922. That number shrank to 12 with the rise of Communism, Fascism and Nazism.\n\nThe “second wave” arrived at the end of World War II, when decolonization brought democracy to countries like India and Sri Lanka, and ebbed with events like the military coups in Bolivia and Brazil in 1964, and Argentina in 1966.\n\nIn the thirty years following the Carnation Revolution, democracy expanded around the world like never before. But around 2006 it came to a halt. Though the total number of democracies has not sharply declined, space for civil society is shrinking. Freedom and democracy are in recession. This timeline charts the spread, regression, and sometimes even collapse, of democracy in the last 40 years.\n\nApril 25, 1974\n\nThe Carnation Revolution and the Birth of the 'Third Wave'\n\nIn April 1974, young left-wing officers of the Movimento das Forças Armadas (M.F.A.) overthrew Portugal’s 48-year-old nationalist dictatorship in a swift military coup, launching the first democratic transition in what would become the “third wave” of global democratization.\n\nA tense, uncertain period of political maneuvering, worker strikes, attempted coups and countercoups followed in the next two years, until parliamentary elections took place in April 1976, and Mário Soares, a dissident who had been jailed 12 times under the dictatorship (and who was known to Portuguese as ''sempre em pe,'' the name for a toy that bounces back whenever it is knocked over) and his Socialist Party formed a coalition government.\n\nNov. 17, 1974\n\nGreece Returns to Democracy\n\nIn July 1974, Greece's junta collapsed after seven years in power after it supported Greek Cypriots in a coup that led to Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.\n\n“Thousands of people gathered in Constitution Square and shouted ‘Tonight, fascism dies!’ and ‘No more blood!’” The Times reported on July 24.\n\nKonstantinos Karamanlis and his conservative New Democracy party “swept to an overwhelming victory” in parliamentary elections in November.\n\nJune 1977\n\nSpain's Democratic Transition\n\nIn Spain, following the death of the long-time dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, elections in 1977 completed a democratic transition.\n\nAug. 4, 1980\n\n'Solidarity' Brings Reform to Poland\n\nLech Walesa, an electrician “with a vocational school education and a sure touch for mass politics,” led the founding of the Communist bloc’s first independent trade union, Solidarity (Solidarność), at the Gdansk shipyards in Poland. Solidarity, which eventually claimed more than nine million members, became the spearhead and symbol of a broad campaign of nonviolent resistance to the Polish Communist regime, which declared martial law in 1981 in an effort to eliminate the union.\n\nBut years of political repression failed to suppress widespread civil resistance, and in the face of mounting social unrest the government of General Wojciech Jaruzelski entered into roundtable negotiations with Solidarity on Feb. 6, 1989.\n\n“Poland's Communist leadership at last seems prepared to acknowledge that there can be no reform without the participation of working people on terms of their own choosing,” read an editorial in The Times on Jan. 21, 1989.\n\nThe talks yielded an agreement for open parliamentary elections in June 1989 (the freest in the country since 1947). Solidarity led the formation of a coalition government and, in December 1990, Mr. Walesa was elected president.\n\nOct. 30, 1983\n\nThe End of Military Rule in Argentina\n\n“Consider the sad paradox of modern Argentina,” read an editorial in The Times in 1980. “Abundant resources, including food and energy, and high levels of development and education have encouraged the dream of a prosperous society playing an influential role in regional affairs. Yet a primitive politics keeps puncturing the dream.”\n\nArgentina’s military dictatorship collapsed in 1983 after its defeat in a short war with Britain over the Falklands the previous year. Raúl Alfonsín, leader of the Radical Civic Union, won the 1983 presidential election and went on to form the first democratic government in Argentina since 1976, bringing an end to seven years of repression, in which more than 10,000 people (and possibly as many as 30,000) were “disappeared” by the military, and many more went into exile.\n\nJan. 15, 1985\n\nThe 'Opening' of Brazil\n\nThe long-time democratic political leader Tancredo Neves won an indirect election to become the first president of a restored democracy in Brazil, concluding two decades of military rule and an extended process of political opening, known as the abertura.\n\nFeb. 22-25, 1986\n\n'People Power' in the Philippines\n\nA tumultuous period of protest and conflict in the Philippines was unleashed by the August 1983 assassination of the charismatic democrat, Benigno Aquino, on the tarmac of Manila airport as he was returning from three years of exile in the United States. In February 1986, after four days of massive, nonviolent civil resistance to defend the presidential election victory of Mr. Aquino’s wife, Corazon Aquino, President Ferdinand E. Marcos flew into exile after more than 20 years in power. Ms. Aquino assumed the presidency.\n\nJune 10-29, 1987\n\nSouth Korea's Democratic Uprising\n\nNineteen days of mass popular protests, led by university students and a burgeoning civil society, forced the military regime to accept direct presidential elections to determine the successor to its strongman, Chun Doo Hwan.\n\nSouth Korea went on to become one of the most successful third-wave democracies.\n\nOct. 5, 1988\n\nChile Says 'No' to Eight More Years of Pinochet\n\nIn 1988, after 15 years of repressive military rule, Gen. Augusto Pinochet gambled his grip on power for the opportunity to govern as a democratic leader, and held a plebiscite on the question of whether he should be granted a new eight-year term as president.\n\nA broad-based opposition united to campaign against him and won 55 percent of the vote. Democratic elections the following year ushered in a coalition government and Chile went on to become one of the most liberal democracies in Latin America.\n\nJune 4, 1989\n\nPro-Democracy Movement Derailed in Tiananmen Square, Beijing\n\nOn this day, tens of thousands of People’s Liberation Army troops and hundreds of armored military vehicles crushed student pro-democracy protests. The death toll from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed that hundreds, probably thousands, were killed that day, and thousands more were detained, tortured or executed in the subsequent days and weeks. Since then, the cause of political reform has remained derailed in China and public discussion of the 1989 Tiananmen protests and crackdown is forbidden by law.\n\nSeptember 1989\n\nThe Fall of the Berlin Wall\n\nAfter Hungary began removing its border defenses with Austria in May 1989, thousands of East Germans escaped through the country to Austria. By November, the exodus of East Germans had become a floodtide and, on Nov. 9, Germans began tearing down the Berlin Wall.\n\nThe following year East Germany held democratic elections for a transitional government that negotiated German reunification.\n\nCommunist rule collapsed throughout Central and Eastern Europe, and most countries, led by Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia (which then split into two nations) transitioned to democracy.\n\nFeb. 11, 1990\n\nSouth Africa's First Multiracial, Democratic Elections\n\nIn 1990, one week after President F. W. de Klerk had lifted the ban on Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and other opposition parties, Mr. Mandela was released after more than 27 years of imprisonment.\n\nIn April 1994 the A.N.C. won a massive victory in the country’s first multiracial, democratic elections, and Nelson Mandela became president at the helm of a five-year, transitional power-sharing government.\n\nDec. 25, 1991\n\nThe Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nOn Dec. 25, 1991, after six-and-a-half years as general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, and a historic period of liberalizing reforms, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as president of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and presided over its peaceful dissolution. Boris N. Yeltsin, who had been elected president of Soviet Russia in May 1990, became the first freely elected ruler of the Russian Federation.\n\nMarch 23, 1996\n\nAn Election in Taiwan\n\nThe Republic of China, Taiwan, completed a decade-long process of gradual democratic opening with its first-ever direct presidential election. President Lee Teng-hui of the ruling Kuomintang party was elected despite China conducting missile tests off the coast of Taiwan in what was widely seen as an attempt to intimidate Taiwan's electorate and influence the election.\n\nOct. 12, 1999\n\nA Coup, and Military Rule, in Pakistan\n\nThe Pakistani military overthrew the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (the third time the military had overthrown the government in the country’s 52-year history) after Mr. Sharif attempted to replace the chief of staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. The bloodless coup ushered in another long period of military rule in Pakistan, under General Musharraf.\n\nCivilian constitutional government was restored in the 2008 elections, but under the continuing heavy constraint of a military establishment beyond civilian control — and not before former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated on Dec. 27, 2007, while campaigning for a seat in Parliament.\n\nDec. 15, 1999\n\nHugo Chávez Strengthens His Grip on Venezuela\n\nVoters gave Hugo Chávez, who had been elected president in 1998 after a failed attempt to seize the office in a coup six years earlier, a new constitution that greatly strengthened the powers of the presidency — lengthening its term and allowing re-election, weakening the national legislature and dismissing the existing Congress and Supreme Court.\n\nWhen Chávez was re-elected, in July 2000, the National Assembly gave him authority to rule by decree for a year, and he proceeded to consolidate an authoritarian regime.\n\nMarch 26, 2000\n\nUnder Putin, Democratic Gains in Russia Are Undone\n\nAfter winning a presidential election marred by serious and extensive irregularities, Mr. Yeltsin’s designated successor, Vladimir V. Putin, moved to centralize power in the Kremlin and rout what remained of Russia’s badly fragmented liberal opposition.\n\n\"Mr. Putin has the chance to be both democratic and effective. It would be a great loss for Russia and the world if he followed the K.G.B. rulebook and turned the Kremlin back into a fortress,\" read an editorial in The Times on March 26, 2000.\n\nIn the years since, Mr.Putin has destroyed every independent source of power and accountability in the federal system, the Parliament, the media, business, and civil society while constructing a kleptocratic and increasingly repressive authoritarian regime.\n\n2003-2011\n\nThe Iraq War Turns Public Opinion Against 'Democracy Promotion'\n\nThe U.S. and its coalition partners invaded Iraq \"to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.\"\n\nSaddam Hussein’s dictatorship was swiftly deposed, but the coalition forces failed to find evidence of weapons of mass destruction and the U.S. switched to a strategy of promoting democracy in Iraq. The war and occupation fractured the country and unleashed violent sectarian divisions that continue to destabilize the region.\n\nThe corruption, lawlessness and instability undermining governance in Iraq to this day brought into question the idea of a “freedom agenda” executed with military force.\n\nNovember 2004\n\nThe Orange Revolution in Ukraine\n\nIn the face of massive fraud in the November 2004 presidential election, Ukrainians poured into the streets of the Maidan in Kiev to launch a campaign of civil resistance against the theft of the vote by the candidate of the post-Soviet establishment, Viktor Yanukovich.\n\nOpposition candidates Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko joined in a united effort to rally the country behind demands to respect the election results, and protesters braved bitter cold to participate in sit-ins and strikes. Finally, on Dec. 3, Ukraine’s Supreme Court annulled the election. In a fresh vote, Mr. Yushchenko won with 52 percent, leading to his inauguration as president on Jan. 23, 2005.\n\nUkraine’s democratic progress stalled as Mr. Yushchenko and Ms. Tymoshenko turned against each other, and Mr. Yanukovich won the 2010 presidential elections. He dragged Ukraine back into authoritarianism and away from Europe, provoking a second popular uprising — the Maidan Revolution of February 2014, and a new chance for democracy to work in Ukraine.\n\nJan. 14, 2011\n\nBen Ali Is Toppled in Tunisia, Optimism Spreads and Quickly Fades\n\nAfter 23 years as president, Tunisian strongman Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled the country following a month of grassroots protests. The popular uprising against authoritarian rule spread to Egypt, generating mass protests that led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11, 2011, after 29 years in power.\n\nSimilar protests erupted in Bahrain, Libya, Syria and Yemen. The initial optimism that the \"Arab Spring\" would topple dictatorships and democratize the region has faded as the revolution has folded into sectarianism and repression.\n\nMore on NYTimes.com\n\nAdvertisement"
