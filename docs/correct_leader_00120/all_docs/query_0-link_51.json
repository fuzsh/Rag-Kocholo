The following essay is based on a lecture that he delivered in December 1998 at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. The lecture, which concluded the series entitled “The Democratic Invention,” was co-sponsored by the Mário Soares Foundation, the Luso-American Development Foundation, and the International Forum for Democratic Studies."
