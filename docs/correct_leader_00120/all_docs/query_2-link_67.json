Apesar de a maioria dos artigos publicados focar a realidade portuguesa, os AHAM estão abertos à submissão de artigos sobre outras regiões, especialmente quando contenham visões inovadoras de uma perspectiva comparativa e analítica.\n\nOs AHAM acolhem propostas de publicação de artigos originais, documentos/fontes inéditas, recensões críticas e notícias, em português, espanhol, francês, inglês e italiano. Aceitam, igualmente, propostas de dossiers de carácter temático.\n\n- Brasil/Brazil Revista de Literatura Brasileira/ A Journal of Brazilian Literature\n\nBrasil/Brazil is a journal specializing in Brazilian literature, including comparative literature with a Brazilian focus. It publishes scholarly essays, original fiction and poetry by Brazilian authors, and translations of Brazilian works. Brasil/Brazil is jointly published by the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies at Brown University and the Associação Cultural Acervo Literário de Erico Verissimo (ALEV) in Porto Alegre, Brazil.\n\nBrasiliana – Journal for Brazilian Studies of Aarhus University intends to be a dynamic academic forum where scholars from diverse disciplines in Humanities and Social Sciences will be able to publish their research, to establish academic discussion, exchange ideas and draw on each others’ research within the field of Brazilian Studies.\n\nThis journal has a significant role to play at this moment, when Brazilian Studies is developing as a new research area. It sets out to discuss the epistemological significance of the term Brazilian Studies and seeks to define it as an area of studies. To Danish academia this journal provides a solid platform in Brazilian Studies, both in Humanities and the Social Sciences, and it places Denmark firmly on the international map of ongoing academic discussions of Brazil.\n\nEach issue includes a special dossier, with 3 to 5 peer reviewed papers on aspects of Brazil from the perspective of Humanities and Social Sciences. These dossiers are interdisciplinary and bring subjects that are considered important to lay the foundations for academic discussions about Brazil. Besides the Dossier, each issue has a general section, with up to 3 peer reviewed papers, on the areas covered by the Journal e.g. Brazilian Literature, culture, sociology, economy, anthropology, music, language, history, geography, political science, strategy, etc. Special attention is given to the Book Reviews section, covering most recent and important academic publications about Brazil worldwide. Finally, the Journal includes a section dedicated to publishing call for conference papers, news about courses and seminars, as well as interviews with people important to the development of Brazilian Studies.\n\nThe journal will publish papers in English, Danish, Spanish and Portuguese language.\n\n- Bulletin of Hispanic Studies\n\nSince its founding by Edgar Allison Peers in 1923, Bulletin of Hispanic Studies has become the foremost British academic journal devoted to the languages, literatures and civilizations of Spain, Portugal and Latin America. Recognised across the world as one of the front-ranking journals in the field of Hispanic research, it is supported by an editorial committee specialising in a vast range of Hispanic scholarship.\n\nThe journal’s interests are broad-ranging and cover the linguistic areas of Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Basque and Amerindian. While BHS mainly publishes articles in the areas of literature, linguistics, cultural history, film and visual arts, cultural and gender studies, this wide-ranging Spanish studies journal encourages reflection and engagement with all aspects of Hispanic Studies, both modern and traditional.\n\nAs of 2016, Bulletin of Hispanic Studies will be moving to 10 issues a year.\n\nBulletin of Hispanic Studies is indexed and abstracted in:\n\nArts and Humanities Citation Index\n\nCurrent Contents/Arts & Humanities\n\n- Bulletin of Portuguese / Japanese Studies\n\nThe Bulletin of Portuguese / Japanese Studies, launched in December 2000, is an interdisciplinary journal of humanities and social sciences published in English. The BPJS was created as a result of the development of historiographical studies on the Portuguese presence in East and South-East Asia, and particularly in Japan. Throughout these fifteen years of activity and after publishing twenty-one volumes, scholars and students interested in the numerous aspects related to Portuguese-Japanese relations referred to the BPJS as a container of new ideas, approaches, and reliable historical research. At the same time, the BPJS has been considered an important venue for publications in the fields of political, social and religious history, but also the fields of anthropology, sociology, the visual arts and the conservation of objects.\n\nThe first series of the BPJS was published in print with a semi-annual periodicity, which was maintained until its 21st volume. However, the adaptation to new academic contexts and (inter)disciplinary frameworks, to new and ever-improving criteria of scientific production, as well as the urge to meet new profiles of academic research eventually determined a new outline for the BPJS.\n\nThe Bulletin will now start a second series, in digital format and in open access (online), publishing only one number per year. With this new format we hope to explore new approaches and subjects even more deeply and widely, and to meet the needs and the interest of even a larger number of scholars and students all over the world.\n\n- Bulletin for Spanish and Portuguese historical Studies\n\nBSPHS is the journal of the Association for Spanish and Portuguese Historical Studies (ASPHS; formerly SSPHS). The Association was founded in 1969 to promote research in all aspects and epochs of Iberian history and related disciplines. ASPHS conducts annual meetings, provides a forum for scholars of Iberian affairs, awards prizes for books, articles and dissertations, and publishes annually the Bulletin for Spanish and Portuguese Historical Studies. As an affiliated society of the American Historical Association, ASPHS also sponsors sessions at the AHA's yearly meeting.\n\n- Bulletin of Spanish Studies\n\nFounded at Liverpool in 1923 by the influential British Hispanist E. Allison Peers, the Bulletin of Spanish Studies is a learned review dedicated to research into the languages, literatures, histories, cultures and civilizations of Spain, Portugal and Latin America. Also known as theBulletin of Hispanic Studies (1949–2001), the Bulletin of Spanish Studies soon established a world-wide reputation, and is now recognised as one of the front-ranking journals in the field of Hispanic scholarship. The Bulletin publishes articles and reviews, as well as some full-length studies and reference-works, on almost any and all aspects and topics concerned with Spain, Portugal and Latin America.\n\nThe articles, review-articles, reviews and other longer works published in the Bulletin deal with an impressive number of different authors, works, themes, genres and periods, researching both the Old and the New Worlds of Hispanic cultures and civilizations. In addition, the Bulletin is currently extending further its already wide-ranging interests by publishing regularly special issues wholly dedicated to Hispanic Visual Studies.\n\n- Cadernos Do Arquivo Municipal\n\nThis peer-reviewed journal disseminates documentation conserved in the Arquivo Municipal de Lisboa.\n\n- Colonial Latin American Review\n\nColonial Latin American Review (CLAR) is a unique interdisciplinary journal devoted to the study of the colonial period in Latin America. The journal was created in 1992, in response to the growing scholarly interest in colonial themes related to the Quincentenary.\n\nCLAR offers a critical forum where scholars can exchange ideas, revise traditional areas of inquiry and chart new directions of research. With the conviction that this dialogue will enrich the emerging field of Latin American colonial studies, CLAR offers a variety of scholarly approaches and formats, including articles, debates, review-essays and book reviews. These contributions not only reflect the latest research on different aspects of colonial Latin America, but also point to new critical directions shared by art, history, anthropology, literature and other disciplines.\n\nThe journal is also committed to fostering an international network of colonial scholars and invites contributions in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Studies done from a comparative perspective or that engage broad thematic issues are particularly welcome\n\n- e-Journal of Portuguese History\n\nThe e-Journal of Portuguese History (e-JPH) was founded in 2002 by the editors who also hold the copyright of the journal. The journal is published in English twice a year (June and December), only in electronic format. The first issue of e-JPH appeared in Summer 2003. The e-JPH is a peer reviewed international journal. Its main objective is to provide publication of scholarly work on historical subjects, especially those concerning themes and topics of Portuguese history analyzed in comparative perspective. Historically oriented contributions from the different social sciences are also welcome. It is furthermore the aim of the journal to offer new insights on developments in Portuguese historiography, as well as to provide news and information on research activities concerning Portuguese history.\n\nThe ethos of e-JPH is a pluralist one. It does not subscribe to any particular ideological, theoretical or methodological approach. The editors of e-JPH aim at publishing quality, blind refereed articles covering any period within any sub-field of historical research.\n\nContributions to e-JPH will be considered for the following sections.\n\n- Articles All papers submitted are first screened by the editors and subject to a blind refereeing process\n\n- Surveys and Debates This section includes commissioned contributions on selected topics providing new insights and controversy on recent historiographical developments\n\n- Institutions and Research It is the purpose of this section to provide critical assessment and appraisal of scholarly work and research undertaken in both Portuguese and non-Portuguese institutions.\n\n- Book Reviews The editors of the journal encourage and welcome the contribution of reviews of books published in any language on Portuguese history.\n\nInternational and Portuguese publishers are kindly invited to send books for review to the mailing address of the journal.\n\n- Entrepalavras\n\nEntrepalavras é a Revista de Linguística do Departamento de Letras Vernáculas da Universidade Federal do Ceará (UFC) é um periódico acadêmico-científico dedicado a divulgar trabalhos originais e inéditos de interesse da Linguística, de caráter teórico ou aplicado, produzidos por graduandos, graduados e pós-graduados de universidades nacionais ou estrangeiras.

IJIS is interested in history (20th century onwards), government and politics; foreign policy and international relations.\n\n- Journal of Lusophone Studies\n\nThe Journal of Lusophone Studies is the official journal of the American Portuguese Studies Association. It is peer-reviewed and published twice a year. Each spring, we publish a special issue on a specific theme, and each autumn we publish a general issue. In keeping with the founding principles of APSA, the Journal of Lusophone Studies strives to foster the expansion and diffusion of knowledge on the peoples and cultures of Portuguese-speaking countries and diasporas. It achieves this by publishing the scholarly work of APSA members.\n\nThe journal’s commitment to open access is an extension of APSA’s founding principles. It shows our support for the accelerated discovery of information through the unrestricted sharing of ideas, and it allows us to increase public enrichment through the free presentation of cutting-edge research on the languages, peoples, and cultures of countries where Portuguese is spoken.\n\n- Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies\n\nThe Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies ( JMIS ) is a new interdisciplinary journal for innovative scholarship on the multiple languages, cultures, and historical processes of the Iberian Peninsula, and the zones with which it was in contact. Recognizing the vitality of debates about change in the fourth and fifth centuries, and conscious of the artificiality of the boundaries associated with 1492, we encourage submission of all innovative scholarship of interest to the community of medievalists and Iberianists.\n\nJMI , which aims to bring theoretically informed approaches into creative contact with more empirically minded scholarship, encompasses archaeology, art and architecture, music, philosophy and religious studies, as well as history, codicology, manuscript studies and the multiple Arabic, Latin, Romance, and Hebrew linguistic and literary traditions of Iberia. We welcome work that engages peninsular Iberia in relation to other parts of the ‘post-classical’ world; which explores links of colonization and exchange with the Maghreb, embraces the study of Occitania, addresses Iberia’s presence in the Mediterranean, or adopts a transatlantic or Latin American frame. We also encourage interdisciplinary work combining radically different forms of sources or theoretical proposals, and ‘unconventional’ types of submissions including brief opinion pieces or archival reports, individual or clustered interviews with prominent scholars, audio clips, ‘podcasts’, and video files.\n\n- Luso-Brazilian Review\n\nIn 2015, the Luso-Brazilian Review marks 50 years of continued publication as a biannual, interdisciplinary journal dedicated to stimulating and disseminating research on the Portuguese-speaking world. Founded in 1964 by Professor Alberto Machado da Rosa and published by the University of Wisconsin Press, the Luso-Brazilian Review has been edited or co-edited by professors from the University of Wisconsin Department of Spanish and Portuguese since its inception. Over the five decades of its publication, the LBR has benefited from the collaboration a wide range of well-known scholars from throughout the world. It currently enjoys a reputation as the foremost interdisciplinary publication in the field of Luso-Brazilian Studies in the U.S., and one of the journals with the longest uninterrupted publishing history.\n\nAs the current editors of the LBR have continued the practice of seeking to include a variety of topics and critical approaches, the journal has become a key venue for the publication of in-depth studies of the various national cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world. It also has become an important resource for the continued reassessment of the role played by language, literature, geography and history in a world that is increasingly, yet unevenly, globalized and transnational. Portuguese is the official language of eight countries on four different continents and the LBR regularly includes articles authored by national and international scholars whose teaching and research center on the networks that link these countries. The editors are dedicated to maintaining open discussions regarding the models and methodologies will best lead to new modes of production of knowledge about the Lusophone world.\n\n- Medievalista Online\n\nA Revista Medievalista online publica originais sob a forma de artigos, comunicações em congressos, cartas ao Director, recensões e estados de artesobreestudosmedievais.
