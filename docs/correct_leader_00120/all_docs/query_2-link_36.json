        "text": "The Czech lands and Portugal, countries with few commonalities in the history of the European continent, underwent turbulent changes in the twentieth century which were marked by coups and major revolutions – first the military coup in Portugal in 1926 and the communist coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948, then the third wave of democratisation which commenced with the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and (almost) concluded with Velvet Revolution in 1989.Footnote 1 These countries began interacting in the 1920s, developing cultural and business relations. The Portuguese canning industry saw Czechoslovakia as a major export destination for fish products, while Czechoslovak factories planned to export weapons for the Portuguese army.Footnote 2 The progress of this cooperation was halted by the creation of a corporative Salazar regime in Portugal and the country's support for Franco in the Spanish Civil War, combined with the outcome of the Second World War and the February 1948 coup d’état in Czechoslovakia. These historical events turned the countries into ideological enemies and members of two competing political blocs.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1968 Czechoslovakia used its strategic position between Paris and Moscow to accommodate communist exiles from several countries in Southern and Western Europe, including Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal.Footnote 3 Their political activity made Prague a kind of ‘communist Geneva’ – a metaphorical but fitting term used by the Czech historian Karel Bartošek.Footnote 4 Throughout this period the Czechoslovak government contributed, as did other Eastern Bloc countries, materially and financially to the Portuguese communists’ fight against the right-wing authoritarian regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. On several occasions Czechoslovakia indicated the possibility of normalising its relations with Portugal, which had severed diplomatic relations with Prague in 1937, but Lisbon insisted on Czechoslovak acceptance of the colonial status of Portuguese territories in Africa and Asia as a quid pro quo. Ideological differences and the low level of commercial exchange made a further rapprochement between the two states impossible.\n\nThis article examines the interconnectedness of the events of 1968, 1974 and 1989 in Czechoslovakia and Portugal. I argue that, in the context of détente and the political transitions in both Southern and Eastern Europe, the two countries were brought together in specific ways: Czechoslovakia supported a democratic transition in Portugal in the mid-1970s, whereas Portuguese democratic governments criticised the politics of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia in the normalisation period.Footnote 5 1968 saw the Prague Spring, as well as the replacement of Salazar with Marcelo Caetano, a technocrat and modest reformer. Developments that year dramatically changed the role of Prague for the Portuguese exiles – some turned away from the ideals of communism and left Czechoslovakia, and for the conservative, pro-Soviet Portuguese communists, Prague was no longer a secure place. The officials of the Portuguese Communist Party (Partido Comunista Português; PCP) turned instead to Budapest and Bucharest. Although Portuguese media coverage of the Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968 was sympathetic towards the Czechoslovak forces of reform, the Marcelist government paid little attention to the normalisation regime in subsequent years. This situation remained unchanged until the Portuguese Carnation Revolution of April 1974, which led to a prompt restoration of official diplomatic relations between the two countries. Czechoslovakia was again the focus of Portuguese media attention in spring 1974 when Portuguese communists were accused of preparing a 1948-style ‘Prague coup’.Footnote 6 From this point onwards there was much greater political interaction between these countries. Czechoslovak authorities carefully observed the developments in Portugal and used the newly re-established relations to promote mutual trade, offer education programmes for Portuguese students in Czechoslovakia and support leftist economic reforms."
