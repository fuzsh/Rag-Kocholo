        "text": "Mário Soares (born December 7, 1924, Lisbon, Portugal—died January 7, 2017, Lisbon) was a Portuguese politician and lawyer who in 1986 became Portugal’s first elected civilian head of state in 60 years; he held the post until 1996.\n\nHis father, João Lopes Soares, was a liberal republican who was often jailed or exiled during the dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar. The young Soares studied at the University of Lisbon and at the Faculty of Law, Sorbonne, Paris, becoming a student activist and thereafter taking up a law practice defending political dissidents. In 1964 he and others founded a clandestine society, the Portuguese Socialist Action, which later transformed into the Portuguese Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Portuguesa). By the time the army-imposed right-wing dictatorship fell in 1974, Soares had been jailed 12 times and had twice experienced exile, in São Tomé (1968) and Paris (1970–74).\n\nFrom 1974 to 1975 Soares was foreign minister in the new but still military-controlled government and oversaw the negotiations for the independence of Portugal’s overseas colonies. In 1976 he became the first constitutionally elected prime minister since the 1974 revolution (serving 1976–78 and 1983–85), and in 1986 he became the first civilian head of state (president) since 1926, ending 60 years of army overlordship. Soares was reelected in 1991. Constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term, he left office in 1996. After serving as a member of the European Parliament (1999–2004), he ran again for president in 2006 but finished third."
