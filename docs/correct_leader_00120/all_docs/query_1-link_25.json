        "text": "MÃ¡rio Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares, GColTE, GCC, GColL (7 December 1924 â 7 January 2017) was a Portuguese politician who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1976 to 1978 and from 1983 to 1985, and subsequently as the 17th President of Portugal from 1986 to 1996.\n\nSoares was the son of JoÃ£o Lopes Soares (Leiria, Arrabal, 17 November 1878 â Lisbon, Campo Grande, 31 July 1970), founder of the ColÃ©gio Moderno in Lisbon, government minister and then anti-fascist republican activist who had been a priest for some time before marrying Elisa Nobre Baptista (SantarÃ©m, Pernes, 8 September 1887 â Lisbon, Campo Grande, 28 February 1955), MÃ¡rio Soares's mother, at the 7th Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon on 5 September 1934. His father also had another son by an unknown mother named Tertuliano Lopes Soares. His mother had previously been married and had two children, J. Nobre Baptista and CÃ¢ndido Nobre Baptista. MÃ¡rio Soares was raised as a Roman Catholic, but came to identify himself as a republican, laic and socialist.\n\nEarly life\n\nSoares was born in the CoraÃ§Ã£o de Jesus neighbourhood of Lisbon, and graduated in History and Philosophy from the University of Lisbon. He became a university lecturer in 1957, but his activities in opposition to the dictatorship of AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar led to repeated arrests. He was active in resistance groups such as the Movement for Anti-Fascist National Unity and the Movement for Democratic Unity.\n\nSoares began his studies at ColÃ©gio Moderno, owned by his father. There, for a short period he was taught Geography by Ãlvaro Cunhal, who would later become the towering figure of Portuguese Communism and one of Soares' greatest political rivals.\n\nWhile a student at University, Soares joined the Portuguese Communist Party, being responsible for the youth section. In this capacity, he organised demonstrations in Lisbon to celebrate the end of WWII. He was first arrested by PIDE, the Portuguese political police, in 1946, when he was a member of the Central Committee of the Movement of Democratic Unity (Portuguese: Movimento de Unidade DemocrÃ¡tica), at the time chaired by MÃ¡rio Azevedo Gomes. Soares was arrested twice in 1949. On those latter occasions, he was the secretary of General Norton de Matos, a candidate for the Presidency. However, he became estranged from Norton de Matos, when the latter discovered Soares's Communist sympathies.\n\nSoares married Maria de Jesus Barroso Soares, an actress, on 22 February 1949, while in the Aljube prison, at the 3rd Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon. They have a son, the former Lisbon Mayor JoÃ£o Soares, and a daughter, Isabel Barroso Soares, b. 1951, who manages the ColÃ©gio Moderno.\n\nSoares's multiple arrests for political activism made it impossible for him to continue with his career as a lecturer of history and philosophy. Therefore, he decided to study law and become an attorney.\n\nPolitical activity during the Estado Novo\n\nIn 1958, MÃ¡rio Soares was very active in the presidential election supporting General Humberto Delgado. Later, he would become Delgado's family lawyer, when Humberto Delgado was murdered in 1965, in Spain, by agents of the dictatorship's secret police (PIDE). As a lawyer, he defended some of Portuguese political prisoners and participated in numerous trials conducted in the Plenary Court and in the Special Military Court. Represented, particularly, Ãlvaro Cunhal when he was accused of several political crimes, and along with Adelino da Palma Carlos he also defended the dynastic cause of Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza.\n\nIn April 1964, in Geneva, Switzerland, MÃ¡rio Soares together with Francisco Ramos da Costa and Manuel Tito de Morais created the AcÃ§Ã£o Socialista Portuguesa (Portuguese Socialist Action). At this point he was already quite distant from his former Communist friends (having quit the Communist Party in 1951); his views were now clearly inclined to economic liberalism.\n\nIn March 1968, MÃ¡rio Soares was arrested again by PIDE, and a military tribunal sentenced him to banishment in the colony of SÃ£o TomÃ© and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea. His wife and two children, Isabel and JoÃ£o, accompanied him. However, they returned to Lisbon eight months later for in the meantime dictator Salazar had been replaced by Marcello Caetano. The new dictator wanted to present a more democratic face to the world, so many political prisoners, Soares among them, were released.\n\nIn the October 1969 general election, which was rigged, the democratic opposition (whose political rights were severely restricted) entered with two different lists. MÃ¡rio Soares participated actively in the campaign supporting the ColigaÃ§Ã£o Eleitoral de Unidade DemocrÃ¡tica or CEUD (Electoral Coalition for Democratic Unity). CEUD was clearly anti-fascist, but they also reaffirmed their opposition to Communism.\n\nIn 1970, MÃ¡rio Soares was exiled to Rome, Italy, but eventually settled in France where he taught at the Universities of Vincennes, Paris and Rennes. In 1973, the 'Portuguese Socialist Action' became the Socialist Party, and Soares was elected Secretary-General. The Socialist party was created under the umbrella of Willy Brandt's SPD in Bad MÃ¼nstereifel, Germany, on 19 April 1973.\n\nCarnation Revolution\n\nOn 25 April 1974, elements of the Portuguese Army seized power in Lisbon, overthrowing Salazar's successor, Marcelo Caetano. Soares and other political exiles returned home to celebrate what was called the \"Carnation Revolution.\"\n\nIn the provisional government which was formed after the revolution, led by the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA), Soares became minister for overseas negotiations, charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas colonies. Among other encounters, he met with Samora Machel, the leader of Frelimo, to negotiate the independence of Mozambique.\n\nWithin months of the revolution however (and in spite of the April 1975 Constituent Assembly election results which gave victory to the Socialist Party and clearly favored the pro-democracy political parties), it became apparent that the Portuguese Communist Party, allied with a radical group of officers in the MFA, was attempting to extend its control over the government. The Prime Minister, Vasco dos Santos GonÃ§alves, was accused of being an agent of the Communists and a bitter confrontation developed between the Socialists and Communists over control of the newspaper RepÃºblica.\n\nPresident Francisco da Costa Gomes dismissed Vasco GonÃ§alves in September 1975 and a failed far-left coup in late November ended the far-left influence in Portuguese government and politics. After the approval of the 1976 Constitution, a democratic government was finally established when national elections were held on 25 April 1976.\n\nPrime minister\n\nThe 1976 legislative election gave the Socialists a plurality of seats in the newly created Assembly of the Republic and Soares became Prime Minister. Deep hostility between the Socialists and the Communists made a left-wing majority government impossible, and Soares formed a weak minority government. Vast fiscal and current account deficits generated by previous governments forced Soares to adopt a strict austerity policy, which made him deeply unpopular. Soares had to resign from office after only two years, in 1978.\n\nThe wave of left-wing sentiment which followed the 1974 revolution had now dissipated, and a succession of conservative governments held office until 1983, with Soares' Socialist Party unsuccessful in the 1979 special elections and 1980 elections. Soares again became Prime Minister following the 1983 elections, holding office until late 1985. His main achievement in office was negotiating Portugal's entry into the European Economic Community. Soares almost single-handedly turned public opinion around, for Portugal at the time was very wary of integration into the EEC.\n\nPresidency\n\nIn the 1986 presidential election, Soares was elected President of Portugal, beating Diogo Freitas do Amaral by little more than 2%. He was reelected in 1991, this time with almost 70% of the vote. For most of Soares' two terms of office, Portugal was governed by the centre-right Social Democratic Party, led by AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva.\n\nHe devised the so-called PresidÃªncia Aberta (Open Presidency), a series of tours around the country, each addressing a particular issue, such as the Environment or a particular region of Portugal. Although generally well received by the public, some claimed that he was criticizing the government and exceeding his constitutional role. Others stated that the tours were in the style of medieval courts. Yet the name stuck for today's presidential initiatives of the same type.\n\nPost-presidency\n\nSoares retired in 1996, but in 1998 he headed the Independent World Commission on the Oceans.\n\nIn 1999 he also headed the Socialist ticket in elections to the European Parliament, where he served until the 2004 elections. He ran for President of the Parliament, but lost to Nicole Fontaine.\n\nIn 2000 he was awarded the North-South Prize.\n\nSoares was a member of the Club de Madrid, an independent organization of more than 80 former democratic statesmen from around the world. The group works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.[1]\n\nIn March 2005, he launched a petition urging the European Union to start membership talks with Cape Verde.\n\nOn 30 August 2005, he announced his candidacy to run for President in the election that occurred on 22 January 2006, when he was 81 years old. However, he lost the election to AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva and was even behind Manuel Alegre, receiving 14% of the vote. \"The results went against my expectations. I accept this defeat with a feeling of mission accomplished,\" he said. It was suggested (on the RTP1 TV programme PrÃ³s e Contras in March 2008) that one of the reasons for his weak support could be that the Portuguese were reluctant to elect any president for more than two terms (only allowed by the Portuguese Constitution of 1976 if non-consecutive).\n\nIn the TV-programme Os Grandes Portugueses (English: The Greatest Portuguese), he was voted 12th, the highest-placed among living people chosen by the public. Dictator AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar would eventually win.\n\nHe was also a member of the strongest Masonic lodge of Portugal.\n\nHe was president of the FundaÃ§Ã£o MÃ¡rio Soares (MÃ¡rio Soares Foundation).\n\nHe also sat in the board of Directors of the FundaÃ§Ã£o Oriente.\n\nHe was also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State, as a former elected President of Portugal.\n\nAfter the Finnish general elections on 17 April 2011, Soares opined that \"Finland has changed into an extremely conservative country, where solidarity is unknown.\" Soares evoked the memory of Kalevi Sorsa, contrasting his generosity with \"those dwarfs, who now want to rule Finland, their ethical values and hostility to Portugal\". According to Soares the Finns live in an illusion, believing that \"speculative markets and credit criminals can destroy nations with nine hundred years' independent history\".\n\nDeath\n\nSoares died of undisclosed causes in a Lisbon hospital on 7 January 2017, aged 92.
