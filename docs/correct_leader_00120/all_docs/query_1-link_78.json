        "text": "The Portuguese Embassy in Luxembourg has opened a book of condolences for those wishing to write a message in memory of late former President Mário Soares.\n\nSoares died on Saturday aged 92, a fortnight after he was admitted to hospital. Widely regarded as the father of Portugal's modern-day democracy, Soares was the founder of Portugal's Socialist Party.\n\nA longer summary of his life and career can be read here.\n\nPortugal declared three days of national mourning from Monday and the former leader's state funeral will be held on Tuesday.\n\nThe book of condolences in Luxembourg will be open to the public on Monday, January 9, from 2pm to 5pm and on January 10 and 11 from 9am to 1pm and from 2pm to 5pm.\n\nThe embassy is located at 282 route de Longwy, 1940 Luxembourg Ville, Luxembourg.\n\nLuxembourg's Grand Duke Henri sent an open letter to the current Portuguese President paying his respects to the late Mr Soares. In it, he wrote: \"In Mr Soares, we pay tribute to a personality who has left his mark on the history of his country, both as a statesman and as a fervent European. We also remember with emotion this committed friend of Luxembourg.\""
