        "text": "Thanks for sharing!\n\nBackground of Carnation Revolution in Portugal\n\nThe Portuguese Republican Party overthrew the monarchy in 1910. However, Ditadura Nacional (National Dictatorship) replaced this in 1926. In 1933, the corporatist Portuguese state installed Estado Novo (New State), formally the Second Portuguese Republic. The president of the Council of Ministers of the authoritarian regime Estado Novo was Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. The fascist regime had a significant impact on the country, and it lasted over four decades!\n\nEstado Novo was one of the longest authoritarian regimes in Europe in the 20th century. Fascist and autocratic ideologies led Estado Novo, and it defended Portugal’s traditional Catholicism. They opposed communism, anarchism, socialism, liberalism, and anti-colonialism. Elections were manipulated, and voting was no universal right.\n\nPIDE was the political police that would attack and oppress opponents and even kidnap, torture and murder anyone promoting communist or left sentiments. The resistance and fights against the dictatorship continued, however. Primarily thanks to the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP).\n\nSalazar was in charge until 1968 when Marcelo Caetano replaced him. Salazar died on July 27th, 1970, at the age of 81. The regime fell on April 25th 1974. Portugal changed to a democracy, which was also the end of the Portuguese Colonial War in Africa.\n\nThe Colonial War\n\nAfter the Second World War, all European countries were obliged to leave their respective colonies. Portugal thought it was different from other countries, the so-called luso-tropicals (lusotropicalismo), meaning that the Portuguese were better colonizers than other European nations. But things were about to change.\n\nThe Portuguese Colonial War (Guerra Colonial Portuguesa) started in 1961. It was a 13-year-long conflict with the Portuguese military and independence movements in the African colonies. In the former colonies, the war is known as the War of Liberation (Guerra de Libertação).\n\nThe armed movements wanted independence in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique, and Portugal’s African wars caused thousands of deaths! The Angolan, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambican War of Independence ended with the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and the withdrawal of Portuguese troops. Unfortunately, Mozambique and Angola fell into a civil war, and Timor-Leste was soon to be invaded by Indonesia.\n\nThe start of the coup\n\nMuch of the international community, as well as the Portuguese people, were against the regime. This, combined with an economic crisis and an overstretched Portuguese army, created a situation to overthrow the government. 40 years of dictatorship in Portugal ended with an almost-bloodless coup, and almost no shots were fired.\n\nA group of junior military officers affiliated with the socialist and communist parties, known as Movimento das Forças Armadas, or Armed Forces Movement MFA, organised a civil resistance campaign against the fascist regime. Important MFA members of the revolutionary process were Vítor Alves, Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, Vasco Lourenço, and Salgueiro Maia. Francisco da Costa Gomes is known to be the leader of the revolution and the armed forces.\n\nThe revolution began with a song!\n\nOn the 24th of April, at 10:55 PM, a song by Paulo de Carvalho played on the radio. E Depois do Adeus was the first sign the uprising had started. The next day, at 00:25 AM, another song played on the radio. It was Grândola Vila Morena by Jose Afonso. Grândola Vila Morena was banned during the dictatorship, which was the second signal that the military coup started. Rebels were taking over strategic points in the city, and Rádio Clube Português read the first communiqué by the MFA at 4 AM the same day.\n\nE Depois do Adeus (And After the Farewell) was Portugal’s entry in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. The song Grândola Vila Morena is still a symbol of revolution, anti-fascism and democracy. You can listen to it in the below YouTube video. O povo é quem mais ordena is like the Portuguese version of Power to The People. It’s one of the most meaningful lyrics of the song.\n\nThe uprising\n\nThe popular forces joined the military uprising, and the MFA publicly announced their objectives. Its goal was to end the dictatorship and to end the colonial war. The revolutionary forces were led by Salgueiro Maia, who advanced to Terreiro do Paço, where the government’s main office was located.\n\nA restaurant worker named Celeste Caeiro started giving carnations to the soldiers. She put them in their guns and on their uniforms to show that the revolution was peaceful. This is where the name Carnation Revolution comes from.\n\nAfter only a few hours of protesting and negotiations, Caetano surrendered to General Spínola and the MFA. Big crowds gathered outside the PIDE Headquarters, which also gave in the following day. The MFA and political forces then formed the Junta of National Salvation.\n\nAfter the April 25th in Portugal\n\nAfter years of political repression, a transition to democracy started. The National Salvation Junta, or Junta de Salvação Nacional, was designated to maintain the government in Portugal. General António de Spínola was temporarily made President of the Republic. The MFA pre-planned the Junta of National Salvation, and the MFA Program contained four D’s: Democratise, Decolonize and Develop.\n\nThese values were incorporated straight away by drafting a new constitution. The secret police PIDE was abolished, workers’ unions were established, and different political parties were legalised. The 1st of May, Workers’ Day, was also celebrated this year by over a million people in Lisbon! There were many social reforms, such as agricultural land reform and establishing a welfare state.\n\nUnder the new democratic laws, censorship was prohibited, and political prisoners were released. Decolonisation of the occupied African territories also started. Portuguese colonies like Mozambique, Cape Verde, Angola, and São Tomé and Principe gained independence in 1975.\n\nThe first free elections in a democratic country\n\nThe first year was chaotic, with a few attempted counter-coups. But one year after the coup, Portugal held its first free elections. It was time for the first constitutional government to come into power. This was the start of the democratic system, and women were allowed to vote for the first time in Portugal.\n\nThe Portuguese people voted for the first elections for Parliament in 1976. The winner of the polls was the Socialist Party (PS), and Mário Soares became Portugal’s first democratically elected Prime Minister. Ramalho Eanes won the election for the President of the Republic, a title he held for ten years.\n\nHow is the Carnation Revolution remembered today?\n\nThe Carnation Revolution in Portugal is celebrated annually on April 25th. Older people lived under the fascist regime and will remember Estado Novo very well. The younger generation grew up listening to many stories, and the celebration is important to recognise the value of democracy, the end of Portuguese colonialism, and the fight against fascism.\n\nFlorists will often give carnations to the public for free, and there will be celebrations nationwide. There will be parades, parties and dances on the Portuguese streets. The Parliament celebrates the Carnation Revolution on the 25th of April every year with a ceremony.\n\nThe first Portuguese Netflix Original\n\nDo you want to know more about the time of Estado Novo? Then you can watch the spy thriller Gloria on Netflix. It is set in the village of Glória do Ribatejo in the 1960s.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen you visit Portugal in April, you can witness the annual celebrations with the Portuguese people on April 25. This day celebrates the end of the fascist regime led by António de Oliveira Salazar and the start of the Portuguese democracy.\n\nLearn how a group of young military officers in the Armed Forces Movement overthrew the authoritarian rule and stood up against the political police, leading to free elections for the Constitutional Assembly. The constitutional reforms played a huge part in changing Portugal’s civilian rule, and Mário Soares became Portugal’s first democratically elected Prime Minister.\n\nClick here to learn more about events and festivities in Portugal!\n\nPin to read later!\n\nThanks for sharing!"
