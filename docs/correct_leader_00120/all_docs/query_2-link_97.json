Everything begins with people and human connections, and sports events, such as tours, are a great way to bring people together. To illustrate this, this chapter reviews the 100+ years of diplomatic history of Sporting Clube de Portugal (SCP) via its tours to the five corners of the world — Brazil (1928), southern African countries (1954), Angola (1979), China and Macau (1978), and Macau (2018). The tours, though different in context, were approached in a singular manner. Each tour was a tremendous success triggered through sports’ soft power and completely aligned with the UNESCO International Charter on Physical Education and Sport, which stresses that sporting activities “must seek to promote rapprochement between peoples and individuals, as well as disinterested emulation, solidarity and fraternity, mutual respect and understanding, recognition of integrity and dignity of human beings.” Lessons from SCP’s 100+ years of sports diplomacy history can, and should, be used by all nations to achieve results that go way beyond sports or culture, and truly contribute to the understanding of people and nations.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThis chapter was developed for the III International Annual Symposium, organized by City University of Macau and Joaquim Chissano University, centred around the transition from sporadic bilateral exchanges to a comprehensive multilateral platform of mutual development cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the Portuguese-speaking African countries. The authors of this chapter are of the firm belief that sports is a gateway to connecting different countries and regions of the world. Hence, the main focus of this chapter is sports diplomacy. Through a multifaceted analysis, the object of the study — the century-old history of diplomacy pertaining to Sporting Clube de Portugal (SCP) — can teach valuable lessons concerning the development of sports diplomacy interconnecting Portugal to the countries that are at the centre of this symposium — the People’s Republic of China and the Portuguese-speaking African countries. The main question of this study is: Can connectivity between people and countries be achieved through sports diplomacy? To answer this broad question, the authors have gathered information from three different and yet complementary sources:\n\n1. A literature review regarding cultural diplomacy and sports diplomacy;\n\n2. A brief explanation regarding the characteristics and historical circumstances of the five most relevant tours that SCP made in the last 100 years: Brazil in 1928, southern African countries in 1954, the People’s Republic of China and Macau in 1978, Angola in 1979, and Macau in 2018;\n\n3. A collection of testimonies of relevant people with experience and knowledge about sports and diplomacy today.\n\nThe conceptual model of this chapter can be defined as deepening, converging from wider into more specific concepts, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nBy looking into SCP’s history and current testimonies, the authors intend to highlight the advantages of sports diplomacy, as well as to provide guidelines to make efficient use of sports clubs’ reputation and goodwill to project political objectives that are otherwise difficult to obtain. The importance of this work therefore lies in the fact that, unlike the academic papers and analyses published up to now, it focuses on the role of a sports club in sports diplomacy and in fostering intercultural dialogue and political advancements. To date, most studies have focused on international sporting events and friendlies between national teams. As such, individual clubs’ contribution and role as a representative of their country of origin has been overlooked. The analysis of the historical impact of SCP tours and the impact of the opinion of relevant personalities may reveal important conclusions, and be of great importance in understanding the reach of sports diplomacy. Hence, the authors will review episodes of diplomatic history via SCP’s tours to different corners of the world across 100 years of SCP’s memoir. Each tour, according to different contexts, was approached in a singular manner, but each was also a tremendous success triggered through sports’ soft power and completely aligned with the UNESCO International Charter on Physical Education and Sport, which stresses that “Through international co-operation and partnerships, all stakeholders should place physical education, physical activity and sport at the service of development, peace, solidarity and friendship among individuals, communities and nations” (UNESCO, 2015)\n\nThis chapter argues that the lessons from SCP’s century-old history can, and should, be used by other nations to achieve results that go beyond sports or culture, and truly contribute to the understanding and connectivity of people(s) and nations. As such, in this chapter, the authors will analyze the concepts of cultural diplomacy and sports diplomacy as an independent chapter within cultural diplomacy. The authors will then focus on the specific cases of the SCP tours to Brazil (1928), the southern African countries (1954), Angola (1979), China and Macau (1978), and Macau (2018). Finally, the collection of valuable testimonies will provide a glance of the current state of sports diplomacy, which will lead to conclusions and contributions for the future.\n\n2. The Concept of Cultural Diplomacy\n\nIt all starts within the big umbrella of “culture,” understood as social exchanges. First, it is crucial that we define cultural diplomacy. Traditionally, it has been “an instrument ... and a way of interacting with the outside world” (Gienow-Hecht & Donfried, 2010, p. 11). Concerning its characteristics, in the study Cultural Diplomacy 2.0: Challenges and Opportunities in Museum International Practices, the author states that: “Cultural diplomacy implies the use of the art of diplomacy in promoting culture resulting in a potential greater awareness of each other’s cultural backgrounds. Such awareness can lead to interaction among various players, states, and individuals” (Grincheva, 2013). Reflecting on how these interactions can be developed, Grincheva states that “These interactions are usually achieved through the organization of events or a series of cultural activities among countries and employing the instrumentality of ‘culture’ in promoting a country’s interests in economic, political, and strategic fields” (2013). In short, “cultural diplomacy aims to bring people from different countries together so they can learn about each other’s cultures and traditions” (Grincheva, 2013)\n\nCultural diplomacy has been developed in the past decades with, as affirmed by Leadbeater (2010), “significant changes in the global culture of communication, the traditional principles of cultural diplomacy such as image cultivation, propaganda, and marketing- oriented activities (Melissen, 2006, p. 3) have proved to be outdated diplomatic strategies.”\n\nIn a chapter entitled “Public Diplomacy before Gullion: The Evolution of a Phrase” (Cull, 2009), N. J. Cull examines the unique aspects of cultural diplomacy: In the course of its discursive expansion, cultural diplomacy has also been yoked to the cause of public diplomacy, advocated as a more citizen-oriented form of diplomacy than the standard model, whose ‘targets’ are no longer other governments so much as diverse national and global audiences and publics. It is increasingly understood as a trans-national process that can be engaged upon not just by governments and their agencies but by civil society and/or private sector stakeholders as well. (Cull, 2009)\n\nAn important part and as well as instrument of cultural diplomacy is sports and its unique characteristics. In fact, according to the UNESCO International Charter of Physical Education and Sport: The virtues of sport, including courage, justice, wisdom and self- achievement, among others, have already been raised many times. For most of the people, a proper education through sport turns into a school of life. Physical education and sport make up an essential part of education and culture, enriching social relations and developing fair-play (UNESCO, 2015). Besides its role in education, sport’s “popularity and global attraction to sport enables people to transcend national, cultural, socio-economic and political boundaries (Sport for Development and Peace International Working Group, 2008) [...] If cultural diplomacy concentrates on cultural exchanges and mutual understanding, sport is definitely part of it. As stated above, the common language provided by physical education and sport facilitates the dialogue between individuals and nations, sometimes even transcending the cultural and traditional differences. [...] Sport as a tool for cultural diplomacy has already recorded many successes, both at the regional and international level” (Institute for cultural diplomacy). This connection is ancestral. “Actually, the link between sport and peace may be traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games, when belligerent states would agree a temporary ‘Olympic Truce’ for the duration of the Games” for a series of matches in ten cities. (2002)\n\nAfter this marking point in history, the importance of the benefits of sports was legitimated by UNESCO: At the international level, UNESCO launched the International Charter of Physical Education and Sport in 1978, calling for the development of fair-play and the enriching of social relations. For its part, the European Commission set up the European Sports Charter shortly after the end of the Cold War (1992). (Institute for Cultural Diplomacy)\n\nTo conclude this chapter, it is important to emphasize the contribution of sports in personal development and in intercultural dialogue: “Hence the idea of encouraging more and more people participating in intercultural sport events to show them that sport is open to everyone, and is not a battlefield of races, cultures but a competition ground for teams or individuals has to be a good thing” (Markovits & Rensmann, 2010). The next section will analyze the singularities of sports diplomacy and what distinguishes it from other forms of diplomacy.\n\n3. Singularities of Sports Diplomacy within the Broader Spectrum of Cultural Diplomacy\n\nBroadly speaking, sports diplomacy consists of using sports to overcome linguistic, political, and sociocultural differences to pursue specific political objectives. As a 2016 European Commission report states: Although it used to be downgraded, sport is today increasingly and successfully regarded by various countries and governments as a tool to improve their foreign policy and international relations, reach external audiences more deeply, positively and effectively, support external policies and enhance their international image and influence. (Fourneyron et al., 2016)\n\nIndeed, sports have proven to be the most unifying and inspiring development and peace tool in the world. No other social activity brings people together in such great numbers, and with so much passion and enjoyment. Regardless of age, gender or ethnicity, sports are enjoyed by all. Its reach is unrivalled. More importantly, sports promote universal values that transcend language, culture and ideologies. Sports events are a great opportunity for diplomatic exchanges, as Korr and Close explained: There are plenty of official meetings and summits for diplomats and heads of state, but few of them are as desirable and entertaining as sport events – nor do they receive as much media attention. [...] Sporting events have another special feature. Because most people who watch a competition already know the rules, the events bridge cultural and linguistic gulfs that may exist between the hosting nation and the spectators. [...] sports teams, events, and even individual athletes can become sports ambassadors and can provide a face to the nation. A benefit of sport events and individual athletes over official diplomats and politicians is that the negotiations can be seen less as government directed and more as free and spontaneous. (Korr & Close, 2008)\n\nBeing a part of culture, sports can have as much potential as art to unite people in the new globalized world: Sport events, athletes, and teams can provide a face to a nation and a useful instrument to exert their soft power and showcase their hard power to the world, but only if they are used and leveraged correctly. [...] Sport plays an enormous role in our daily lives and, similar to other cultural global phenomena such as popular music, food, and dance, sport entails a universal language that everyone speaks. As Nelson Mandela once stated, ‘Sport has the power to change the world, to inspire and to unite people in a way that very little else can.’ (Korr & Close, 2008)\n\nSeveral further examples can be provided: At the Four Countries 4 Peace Football Tournament, an initiative to promote reconciliation and dialogue between young people from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda, each team had an equal number of boys and girls, but only the girls were allowed to score goals. In the absence of a referee, the players were responsible for resolving any disagreements. By playing together, these young people were unwittingly learning the universal values of respect, tolerance, and fair play. It was a victory for humankind through sports. Moments like these show that sport has a huge potential to effect social change. Sports and physical activity improve individual health and wellbeing, both physically and mentally, and teach important values and social skills. Moreover, sports do not just empower on an individual basis; it also unites and inspires people collectively, which builds communities, from neighbours to transnational movements. In many countries, however, the opportunities to participate in sports are limited by significant infrastructural, social, and political barriers. Given the personal and social development benefits that sports offer, increasing access and participation is a development goal. For this reason, the United Nations (UN) office on sports for development and peace has been running a youth leadership programme since 2012, with the aim of empowering young leaders from disadvantaged communities to use sports as a tool for progress. The initiative has enjoyed notable successes. In 2014, a young Paralympic athlete, Maclean Dzidzienyo, from Ghana, participated in the Berlin YLP camp.\n\nIn August 2013, the UN general assembly adopted a resolution establishing April 6 as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace. The day offers a natural focal point for the movement, which was buoyed by sports’ recognition in the sustainable development agenda adopted by the UN last year. The day encourages people to participate in sports, and aims to raise awareness of sports’ potential as a peace and development tool, and to promote grassroots projects and organizations. More recently, a campaign has been launched encouraging people and organizations involved in sports for development and peace to share a picture or video on social media, highlighting the sustainable development goal to which they are contributing. The campaign “Let’s Play for the Sustainable Development Goals” has enjoyed significant support from partners and participants alike.\n\nOther celebrated illustrations of sports diplomacy go from the rugby national team “Springboks” that united the white and black communities under Nelson Mandela’s visionary leadership to Nixon’s rapprochement with China in 1971 through Ping Pong, or Portugal’s lead up to the opening of an Embassy in Beijing in 1979 with the contribution of SCP’s friendly football matches in China.\n\nBut how do these sports events affect diplomacy? The answer is simple, because they are a communication and representation tool, which is essential to diplomacy. As Pigman wrote in his 2010 study: The main features of diplomacy have been communication and representation. Diplomacy has long been established as the first step to avoid or resolve conflicts. In addition, it helps with negotiations; protects the citizens and other interests abroad; promotes economic, social, cultural, and scientific exchanges between states; and manages foreign policy decisions. Diplomacy traditionally involves government-to-government contact, but there are other channels of communicating national interest and influencing other countries. After the official diplomatic recognition between states, the dialogue usually continues through other channels of diplomacy, such as educational exchange programs, concerts, or other cultural events. [...] While sovereignty has remained key in international negotiations and diplomatic recognitions, it no longer implies that only official diplomats can serve as representatives of a nation’s interest and culture. (Pigman, 2010)\n\nThis reality has been developing in the past decades: Indeed, in the 21st century more nonstate actors such as individuals, teams, and even companies can function as representatives of their nation. This is another reason why today even sports teams or individuals can become the messengers of their nation’s diplomatic messages. Famous artists or athletes can act as bridges between nations and can help to resolve national issues via cultural and sport diplomacy. (Pigman, 2010)\n\nSports personalities play an important role in diplomacy: While the athletes usually do not directly participate in the negotiations, the athletic event serves as a great venue for heads of state and diplomats to meet and discuss issues. This influence based on the attraction of countries is also called soft power. [...] Sport can play an important role in this process, because of its universal popularity and its ability to serve as common ground between nations. (Chalip, 2006)\n\nIt is therefore important to state that sports play “a crucial role in shaping more inclusive collective identities” (Markovits & Rensmann, 2010, p. 2). For instance, continental club competitions attract people and fans from different countries, leading them to admire “foreign” players, or others belonging to ethnic minorities. In this context, sports can be linked to the Robert Putnam’s concept of “bridging capital,” meaning the power to bring different groups together, beyond their cultural boundaries” (Markovits & Rensmann, 2010)\n\n4. Sporting Clube de Portugal: 100 Years of Sports Diplomacy\n\nSporting Clube de Portugal, a Portuguese sports club based in Lisbon, was established in 1906 and its strong identity distinguishes it from other clubs. It is based on two major concepts: eclecticism and athletic development. Since 1906, the idea of its main founder, José Alvalade, was to establish a club that developed a great variety of sports in Portugal and that opened up sports practice to everyone — which was fully accomplished. Indeed, SCP is currently represented with more than 10,000 athletes across 54 sports competitions, has participated in 21 Olympic Games and currently boasting over almost 150 Olympic athletes that have brought home nine Olympic medals. However, the club is mostly famous around the world for having one of the best football academies, having formed Luis Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo — two Portuguese players whom were considered the best players in the world. In fact, there are many successful football academies in the world, but only one has created two FIFA World Player of the Year winners.\n\nIn 2021, the club celebrated its 115th anniversary while continuing to maintain the two original concepts of its identity. Throughout SCP’s history, it has conquered 38 European titles in seven different sports. In football, SCP has won 23 national championships and one European title — the Cup of the Winners’ Cup. Regarding the club’s diplomatic influence, it is important to evoke the history of Portugal in the context of its 16th century maritime discoveries, as since then the Portuguese language has become the fifth most widely spoken language in the world. This includes countries such as Timor-Leste, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Macau SAR of China, and many other territories spread across the world where Portuguese communities have set roots, with an estimated 280 million Portuguese speakers around the globe. Just like the language, SCP subsidiaries, training academies and social clubs have reached an impressive number of 400 contact points across the five continents. Football is part of the culture of the Lusophone countries and territories, while SCP is one of the largest fan-based clubs. The combination of these factors has made SCP an international powerhouse that has been used by diplomacy to achieve various national interests with mutual benefits. Subsequently, we will defend the importance of the five tours mentioned earlier on within their historical context.\n\n4.1. Brazil (1928)\n\nSporting Clube de Portugal made its first major international tour in 1928. The football team embarked on a vessel, reaching the coastline of Brazil after a two-week journey. A truly epic and bold mission that brought the countries closer to each other at a very sensitive time when the world was plunging into an extraordinary crisis, which culminated in the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, with terrible implications for the Brazilian coffee empire. Simultaneously, Portugal was experiencing deep political turbulence, being in a transition phase between the end of the First Republic and the beginning of the Second Republic. Hence, the trip to Brazil was an instrument for communicating and representing Portugal to overseas nations and the overseas Portuguese as a solid and stable country under the new administration.\n\nThis pioneering sports tour was marked by the impact of its arrival in Rio de Janeiro and by the friendship between the delegations and the athletes, as reported by the Brazilian press at the time. In fact, as SCP was crossing the Atlantic, the newspaper Rio Sportivo stated that “Sporting does not come to Rio with the sole purpose of bringing victories to their homeland. It comes to us with much higher feelings because they want to further strengthen the indissoluble bonds that exist between Portugal and Brazil.” It is important to highlight the characteristic of one of the most distinguished members of the tour: Salazar Carreira — doctor, journalist, athlete, manager and later President of SCP — known as “Mr. Eclecticism.” Salazar Carreira, aware of the historical value of the successful realization, praised it through a detailed report, which was published by the SCP’s newspaper Boletim Sporting Club de Portugal over five magnificent editions (Sporting’s trip to Brazil, report by Dr. Salazar Carreira, Boletim Sporting 08/20/1929; 10/31/1929; 02/28/1930; 03/31/1930; 03/30/1930, Museu Sporting, Documentation Center). The first impression of Brazil was astonishing, Mr. Salazar Carreira described the huge avenues, the beauty of the landscapes and the different cities visited that, he assured, “there is not one single member of the tour, who is not enchanted by Rio de Janeiro!”\n\nThe stadiums and the quality of the local football were described with the same admiration by Salazar and the other members of the tour. The various diplomatic visits were also reported, as well as the evidence of friendship and affection. Salazar Carreira highlighted in his reports several relevant moments during the visit to Brazil: the trophies won, the reactions in the press, and the ceremonies in honor of SCP. Fundamentally, more than sports results, it was the intercultural dialogue and the importance of representing Portugal to the Portuguese community in Brazil and to the international community that mattered the most.\n\n4.2 Southern African Countries (1954)\n\nThe historical framework of this trip was totally different from the expedition to Brazil in 1928. In 1954, the Portuguese political regime was going through one of its most delicate periods in history. When SCP arrived in Mozambique, Portuguese territories in India (Dadrá and Nagar-Aveli) were attacked by nationalist groups from the Indian Union, which continued throughout the time that SCP was in Africa. According to reports from SCP’s newspaper Boletim Sporting Club de Portugal, the arrival in Mozambique took place on July 3, 1954. The trip was described as a mission to strengthen the already close ties between continental Portugal with its overseas provinces and aimed to honor SCP as well as Portugal. However, this trip in particular was not only a sports project, but also a political assignment. One may claim that the task was to bring together the locals in the Portuguese provinces in Africa to continental Portugal through sports. SCP had an apotheotic welcome reception at Mavalane airport in Mozambique. The D.E.T.A. airplane from Johannesburg landed at 11:30am, under immense cheers and applause from local inhabitants. The delegation was received by Board Members of Sporting de Lourenço Marques, a Mozambican subsidiary of SCP. The Rádio Clube de Moçambique team recorded the first statements by SCP President Góis de Mota. The President dubbed the mission as “Rota da Saudade,” which means the “Nostalgia Tour.”\n\nOn July 24, the leader of the delegation further declared that “Sporting was invited to go to the United States of America, but instead chose to accept the invite to tour the Portuguese provinces of Africa. If we traveled to America we would have had higher revenues. But the extraordinary overseas fans deserved the preference of Sporting. We came, and from what we saw, the provinces fully deserved Sporting’s decision,” President Góis de Mota declared.\n\nOn August 7, Boletim Sporting Club de Portugal described the arrival to Johannesburg. The SCP delegation went to the Ponta Vermelha Palace to express to the local General-Governor his complete solidarity with the Portuguese government against the attitude of the Indian Union, which SCP’s President classified as an attack on the national honor. Góis da Mota expressed strong disapproval regarding the violence of the Indian Union against the territorial integrity of the Portuguese India.\n\nLuanda, in Angola, represented another apotheotic arrival. In fact, the echo of SCP’s journey according to the press of Portugal and the African provinces, was extensively used as an aphorism to publicize the exceptionality of Portuguese colonialism and also the “Portugueseism” present throughout the Portuguese overseas territories.\n\n4.3 China and Macau (1978)\n\nOn June 25, 1978, a delegation of 41 people arrived in China. This paper argues that this tour illustrated in quite a formidable way how sports diplomacy was exercised through, and in partnership with, SCP. The Portuguese delegation, led by SCP President João Rocha, also included members of the Democratic Portugal-China Friendship Association (Associação Democrática de Amizade Portugal-China, ADAPC), journalists, reporters, and political members. In fact, the impact of SCP’s trip was tremendous, prompting Chinese Vice Prime- Minister Marshal Chen Xilian to claim that the delegation was considered more than sports, as it was, above all, a diplomatic mission. He may also have wanted to emphasize that it was the first official state visit from Portugal to China since the Chinese Revolution of 1949.\n\nSino-Portuguese accord had in fact begun a few years earlier. The United Nations (UN) was one of the ways used in this initial phase, particularly through Veiga Simão, the Ambassador of Portugal in that organization (May 1974 to June 1975). After contacts with the Chinese counterpart Huanh Hua on January 6, 1975, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MNE) issued a diplomatic note stating that the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was “the only representative of the Chinese people,” Taiwan was an “integral part” of Chinese territory, and “Macau could be the subject of negotiations when both governments deemed it appropriate” (Silva, 2020). On the other hand, as Silva explains, “a civil society association had been created to establish informal contacts between the two sides: The Democratic Portugal-China Friendship Association (ADAPC). This association was discreetly created by the PCP-ml (Portuguese Communist Party – Marxist Leninist), under the guidance of Beijing. Carlos Ricardo, first director of ADAPC, traveled to China more than once and it was in these contacts, discreet, that an initial proposal for the movement of a Portuguese football team to the country was born. In 1976, the Governor of Macau, Garcia Leandro, had been informed by an “intermediary” in the PRC that “Beijing would be open to a proposal from Lisbon for a sports exchange.” This information was sent to Lisbon, specifically to General Ramalho Eanes, on December 7, 1976. Sometime later, Heduíno Gomes was contacted by a comrade of the PCP-ml who collaborated with Sporting’s newspaper. The leader of the PCP-ml informed that the club’s president, João Rocha, intended to speak with him. The aim was to prepare an SCP trip to China. Still in 1977, Heduíno Gomes took the message to Hua Guofeng, which would be a confirmation of the initial proposals. The willingness of the Portuguese authorities to advance towards the establishment of diplomatic relations was declared. As “Vilar” is a well-known Sporting fan, the process was even easier. Thus, on June 25, 1978, the Portuguese team left for China. José Faleiro Baltazar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hang Chang-kang, official of the Xinhua Agency delegation in Portugal and several leaders of the PCP-ml were present. Veiga Simão, João Rocha, and Carlos Ricardo were also part of the delegation (Silva, 2020).\n\nThe itinerary in Asia included the cities of Bangkok, Hong Kong, Beijing, Kunming, and Macau, resulting in a total of 28,785 km traveled by the delegation. On arrival to Chinese territory, more precisely to Guangzhou, a local representative of the Chinese Football Association arranged for the first official reception. From there the entourage flew to Beijing, where it encountered its first surprise of the trip: At Beijing airport, the caravan was welcomed by the players and officials of the Chinese national football team as well as officials of the Chinese Football Association. SCP was subsequently treated to a dinner offered by Chinese sports officials, during which the entire SCP delegation was presented with gifts, showcasing the traditional Chinese hospitality. In fact, “the SCP delegation was received by prominent leaders of the Chinese party and state apparatus, including the deputy prime minister of China and the military governor of Beijing province, Marshal Ten Xie Lie. In a speech given by Lieutenant-General Chen Xilian [Ch’en Hsi-lien], it was pointed out that “Sporting’s tour had a much broader meaning than that which was limited to the sports field and constituted the most decisive step undertaken until that time in the relations between the two peoples»” (Silva, 2020). On the other hand, “the President of the Chinese Association of Friendship with Foreign Countries, Wang Bingnan, makes the following statement: “The ping-pong ball is very small and that is why we have only opened a window to the United States. But football uses a very big ball, so let’s open the door wide” (Silva, 2020). In fact: SCP’s tour, which took place between June 27 and July 10, 1978, was one of the most evident “political signs” established between the two countries for the establishment of diplomatic relations. It was also implied that the situation in Macau was implicitly agreed, as revealed by the statements of the members of the CCP. According to news at the time, on this trip, President João Rocha delivered a message from Prime Minister Mário Soares and transmitted a greeting from then President Ramalho Eanes. In turn, Veiga Simão, on a semi-secret mission, also took a letter from Ramalho Eanes to leaders Hua Guofeng or Deng Xiaoping, opening the door to a re-establishment of diplomatic relations. (Silva, 2020).\n\nIndeed, the tour to China with its sports purposes had significant political meaning. As SCP President João Rocha stated: For our part, we deem this visit to China of great importance and significance. It’s not the first time that sports helped unlock the history books!” concluding with a premonitory vision that “Sporting CP made history. With history stretching beyond merely sporting parameters. In the years to come, soon enough they will show in full the extent of the service provided to our country by Sporting CP.\n\nIn fact, a mere couple of months later, Portugal and China would commence formal diplomatic relations with the opening of the Portuguese embassy in Beijing, on February 1979.\n\n4.4 Angola (1979)\n\nIn 1979 Sporting Clube de Portugal returned to Africa on, yet again, a very specific occasion — the 4th annual celebration of the independence of the Republic of Angola from Portugal. From 1961 to 1974, Portugal had been at war with the Angolan independence movement, trying to counter the objective of its then provincial territories to gain independence. At the time of SCP’s 1979 trip, Angola had just been guaranteed its independence and was still in the middle of a civil war, and therefore this was the first delegation of a sports club to tour sovereign, independent Angola. The SCP entourage was comprised of 120 athletes from various sports. The objectives were once again not related to sports results or competitions but about people-to-people connectivity and rearranging diplomatic relations with the country that had just gained independence from Portugal. It was a journey that marked a new time and a new type of bilateral relationship, and which found an essential tool to re-establish both formal and informal channels of relationship via sports diplomacy. SCP, a private sports institution, represented Portugal once again and with great success on such a sensitive occasion.\n\n4.5 Macau (2018)\n\nIn 2018, SCP’s official museum Museu Sporting developed a temporary exhibition in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Sporting’s 1978 tour to China and Macau. The commemorations of the anniversary of this historical trip showed how the historical heritage of the club could become an asset and contribute to the dialogue between Portugal and China. Since 1978, the Tour to China is remembered and retold, but in 2018, its commemoration achieved new historical moments, including articles published in the media channels of SCP, China, and Portugal newspapers, as well as with the exposition of the temporary exhibition in the corporate hall of the club visible to all sky box members and presidential guests to SCP games. The Ambassador of China in Portugal at the time, Cai Run, also visited the exhibition, participated in the launching ceremony in Lisbon, and attended a SCP match in representation of the People’s Republic of China. The celebrations ended with the SCP football team touring Macau to play two friendly matches against the Macau Football Association team and SCP’s Macau subsidiary, Sporting Clube de Macau, both with the presence of the Portuguese General Consul of Portugal in Macau, the president of the Macau Football Association, and the sports authorities in Macau. Complimentary gifts were exchanged between the SCP entourage and the official entities in Macau, thus strengthening the people-to-people connectivity, respect, admiration, and understanding. The following table sums up the main characteristics of the tours mentioned above.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nEverywhere in the world sports play an important role in society. It is capable of conveying basic rules and essential values of peaceful coexistence — such as tolerance, team spirit, loyalty, and fair play as well as establish bridges otherwise unreachable. In addition, sports are especially suitable for forming character skills, which are important for a fulfilling and happy life, because sports also provide the value of discipline, endurance, courage, and self-motivation. By conveying the ethics of sports, it also lays the foundations for a more peaceful and emphatic world. It is possible to conclude that sports diplomacy is a central part of cultural diplomacy and that its potential has not yet been fully explored and studied. We saw through SCP’s historical tours that it is possible to develop bilateral relations and dialogue between peoples through sports and, in this specific case, through a sports club. The testimonies collected were an extremely rich source that indicate that SCP left a legacy that remains today, demonstrating that the tours had not only an immediate impact, but influenced international relations to this day.\n\nThe answer to the main question of the study is clear: Yes, it is possible to guarantee connectivity between countries and peoples through sports diplomacy. We conclude this chapter with the hope of having contributed to the future, and with the example of SCP tours as a way of developing sporadic bilateral exchanges to foster intercultural dialogue as well as to create opportunities for mutual political advancement. An example to praise, but above all, for the political authorities and sports clubs of the People’s Republic of China and the Portuguese-speaking African countries to eventually follow."
