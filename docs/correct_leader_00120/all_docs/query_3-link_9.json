        "text": "Lawyer, professor, oppositionist to the dictatorship, imprisoned more than ten times, deported and political exile, leader of the Portuguese Socialist Action, founder and Secretary-General of the Portuguese Socialist Party Vice-President of the Socialist International, Minister, Prime Minister and President of the Republic, Member of the European Parliament, President of the European Movement; and Chairman of the Committee of Wise Persons of the Council of Europe, the Independent World Commission on the Oceans, the Committee for the World Water Contract and the Commission on Religious Freedom.\n\nA central political figure in the construction of democracy in Portugal after the Revolution of April 25th, 1974.\n\nDuring the 1974-1975 revolutionary period, MÃ¡rio Soaresâ action was decisive for Portugal to transform itself into a pluralist democracy. As Prime Minister, he played a decisive role in concretizing the basic principles of the Constitutional Regime and the construction of a welfare state in Portugal. It was MÃ¡rio Soares who initiated and led the process of Portugalâs accession to the European Economic Community, between 1977 and 1985, the year in which, as Prime Minister, he signed the Accession Treaty.\n\nâAs a European and as a socialist I firmly believe in Europe. I know that the idea of a political Europe, based on a community of interests and objectives and, above all, on the ideal of freedom, poses a great challenge. Not only for us, who are living the tormented post-war period, but also for the new generations facing planetary problems that jeopardize the survival of the human species. A challenge that deserves our commitment with determination and courage, in order to overcome our present economic and social difficulties and also as a balancing factor between rival blocs and superpowersâ.\n\nAt the age of 17, he entered university, enrolling in the course of Historical-Philosophical Sciences, starting at that time his action as an anti-fascist activist. He joined the Portuguese Communist Youth and several unitary anti-fascist movements. In 1946, when he was 21 years old, he signed his first political text â âYouth is Not with the New Stateâ â and soon asserted himself as a spokesman for the Portuguese democratic youth.\n\nâIt is difficult to ascertain the moment when one begins to think with oneâs own mind, so slow and arduous is the learning of mental independence and so decisive are the influences that weigh, clash, and condition our positions, even those apparently more personal. / I do know that I enrolled at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, at the age of seventeen, in October 1942, and that, at the time, I already had a clearly outlined mental and political position. (â¦)â\n\nAt their side, he resisted and fought the dictatorship, discussed political works of reference and consolidated his political and cultural thinking. When, in 1951, he finished his degree, in the meanwhile breaking up with the Communist Party, he had already developed an intense activity in the opposition, having been arrested four times for political reasons. He was imprisoned at the Aljube Prison, in Lisbon, at the time he married Maria de Jesus Barroso (1925-2015).\n\nMÃ¡rio Soaresâ personal journey merges with the fight for freedom and the assertion of democracy in Portugal.\n\nAlways at the forefront of the resistance to the dictatorship, he quickly became one of the most respected figures in the democratic opposition, nationally and internationally\n\nHe fought the New State for more than three decades: joining and leading resistance organizations; supporting and getting actively involved in the electoral campaigns through which the opposition tried to fight the regime; writing, signing, being spokesman for fundamental texts which denounced the dictatorshipâs actions against freedom and fundamental rights; organizing and taking part in many public demonstrations; and as a lawyer for countless political prisoners, in the course of which his pugnacious interventions and his oratorical and reasoning skills became famous.\n\nHe was arrested twelve times. In 1968 he was deported to S. TomÃ©, by order of the dictator Salazar, with no date for his return to Lisbon. He then received the solidarity of the International League for Human Rights and was named âPrisoner of the Yearâ by Amnesty International. With the fall of Oliveira Salazar, who was succeeded by Marcello Caetano, the deportation of MÃ¡rio Soares ended, and he continued his political combat.\n\nThe fight against the Portuguese dictatorship was intensified. The regime was increasingly challenged at the international level, the main focus being the colonial policy and the colonial war in which the country was engaged since 1961.\n\nIn 1970, after a tour of several Latin America countries marked by successive addresses denouncing the dictatorship, MÃ¡rio Soares delivered an important speech in New York against the Portuguese governmentâs colonial policy. A few days later, he took part in a debate at the Council of Europe, on âViolation of Human Rights in Portugalâ. The governmentâs retaliation did not take long, opening a lawsuit against Soares, accusing him of âtreason to the motherlandâ.\n\nMÃ¡rio Soares went into exile in Paris, where he carried on his oppositionist activity. He intensified his contacts with great European politicians, such as FranÃ§ois Mitterrand or Willy Brandt.\n\nIn 1972, he led the integration of the Portuguese Socialist Action, which he had founded in 1964, in the Socialist International. Soares then took part in the debate âSocialist Policy for Europeâ.\n\nA year later, in Bad MÃ¼nstereifel, Germany, he founded the Portuguese Socialist Party and was elected as its first Secretary-General. MÃ¡rio Soares wanted the party to be an instrument to transform Portugal, at a time when moves against the dictatorial regime were intensifying.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Portuguese dictatorship by the Armed Forces Movement, on April 25th, 1974, MÃ¡rio Soares returned from his exile in Paris to continue his fight, now in a context of freedom: to build a pluralist democracy in Portugal.\n\nIn the long and consistent work that he had carried out until then, Soares had conceived and prepared a political project for Portugal, for which he fought during the troubled years of the Revolution (1974-1975). The Socialist Party quickly evolved from a poorly organized force to the main Portuguese political party, winner of the first free and democratic elections (constituent, legislative and municipal).\n\nAs Minister (Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister Without Portfolio) of the provisional governments, MÃ¡rio Soares chose, as priorities for Portugal, establishing international relations with Europe and with the world, after decades of isolation, and the decolonization process of the Portuguese African territories. His confrontation with the Communist Party, which he accused of intending to âseize powerâ and implant a communist regime in Portugal, was decisive for the outcome of the revolutionary period.\n\nFacing a serious financial crisis, his governmentâs policies laid the foundations of the Welfare State, through the creation of the National Health Service and extensive reforms in the areas of education, justice, labour and social rights. He kept on opening Portugal to the world, changing the paradigm of international relations, asserting the country in the European context. Since the years of the Portuguese dictatorship, Portugalâs integration in Europe had been one of his greatest concerns.\n\nHe put into practice a new way to exercise the highest office of the State, getting closer to the citizens, listening to them and their problems, making use of a magisterial influence. He created the âOpen Presidenciesâ, in which he toured the country, selecting and drawing attention to major issues, in very different areas: from culture to education and science; from economy to the environment; from solidarity and cooperation to technology, innovation and modernization, among many others. In 1991, he was re-elected President of the Republic, garnering the highest vote ever for that office.\n\nA builder of democracy, a man of culture, with an historical conscience and an unusual political intuition, MÃ¡rio Soares never turned his back on a political fight. Throughout his personal journey, the citizen merges with the politician, in a constant struggle for a better, more just and egalitarian world.\n\nâLet us give the floor to the new generations and encourage them to freely give their Country the creativity of their youth. Let us live up to the best of our history and our culture. In solidarity, let us raise the name of Portugal in the World, with valorous deeds and works, at the service of man, of our land and peaceâ.\n\nMÃ¡rio Soares was a major figure in contemporary Europe. He reflected deeply, discussed and wrote about it, striving for and defending the ideal of a united, strong and solidary Europe.\n\nMÃ¡rio Soares always rejected the notion that the European Union should be nothing more than a sum of the interests and rivalries of its Member States,\n\nguided by economic and financial criteria, adopting a policy of deference towards other world powers or concentrating on short-term interests and objectives. On the contrary, he argued in favour of an independent, cohesive and united Europe, around a solid project for the future, the reinforcement of its welfare states and an unwavering respect for human rights.\n\nAfter exercising the highest political positions in Portugal, MÃ¡rio Soares assumed, between 1997 and 1999, the Presidency of European Movement International, where he developed a broad work to promote European ideals and values. He was also, between 1997 and 1998, Chairman of the Committee of Wise Persons of the Council of Europe, and exercised a mandate as Member of the European Parliament (1999-2004).\n\nDuring the last years of his life, MÃ¡rio Soares raised his voice â in speeches, interviews, articles and essays â in defence of the values that presided over the construction of Europe, feeling that they were being left behind. He defended the proposal for a European Constitution and fiercely criticized the dominant neoliberal policies and the âglobalization without valuesâ which were dragging Europe into a serious identity crisis and, in his opinion, undermined democracy itself.\n\nAlthough disillusioned, he was not resigned, and continued spreading a message of hope for the future. In 2011, he wrote:\n\nâI believe that the European People, as a whole, at both national and European levels, are capable of reacting peacefully and imposing another way on European political and economic leaders, so as to avoid falling into decay and disaggregation.â\n\nA humanist and universalist politician, the main challenges that the world faced (and still faces) were also MÃ¡rio Soaresâ main concerns. He thought and acted in a changing world, always aware of both the past and perspectives for the future. He knew that the fight for a better world is a constant and daily fight, requiring persistence and courage. MÃ¡rio Soares never lacked these in the many and varied global causes he embraced.\n\nThe fight for the respect for Human Rights guided his action, always with the objective of ensuring the dignity of the human person, regardless of colour, gender, religious belief or social condition. He defended the fundamental values of freedom and democracy, publicly denouncing those regimes that did not respect them, a labour that was recognized and for which he received several awards, such as the qual recebeu vÃ¡rias distinÃ§Ãµes, como o International League for Human Rights Award, as early as 1977.\n\nâProgressive societies must necessarily be societies imbued with freedom, justice and well-being â for all citizens and not just for some. The right to be different and the right to pursue individual happiness, and full personal fulfilment, are based on equal opportunities for all, laid down at the outset, on respect for others and on a general sense of tolerance, to which I like to call fraternityâ.\n\nIt was a wake-up call regarding one of humanityâs greatest challenges: saving the oceans. He was also Chairman of the Committee for the World Water Contract (since 1998) and Patron of the International Ocean Institute (since 2009).\n\nChairman of the Portuguese Commission for the Celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1998), he headed the fact-finding mission on the situation in Algeria, by appointment of the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan (1998), and the European Parliamentâs delegation for relations with Israel (2002). Between 2007 and 2011, he chaired the Commission on Religious Freedom and was President of the Jury for the UNESCO FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny Peace Prize. In 1997, he was elected President of the Portugal-Africa Foundation.\n\nA year earlier, he had created his own foundation, where he developed a wide-ranging effort to preserve the memory of the fight for democracy, both in Portugal and in Portuguese-speaking countries."
