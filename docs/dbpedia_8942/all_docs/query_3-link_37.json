        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe First Dynasty of Islam The period 661–750 AD was a crucial one for the history of Islam and the Middle East. The territories conquered by the Muslims in the Middle East, north Africa and Spain were ruled from Syria by a succession of caliphs belonging to the Umayyad family, the first caliphal dynasty to emerge in the history of Islam. Under their rule the region began a process of transformation which eventually led to the emergence of Islam, both as a religion and as a culture, in its classical form. The First Dynasty of Islam provides a succinct and accessible introduction to the Umayyad period. An introductory chapter discusses the importance of the era as a whole, with further chapters examining • • • • • • •\n\nthe Umayyad family and its rise to the Caliphate the Sufyanids the second civil war ?bd al-Malik and al-Hajjaj the development of factionalism and the problems of Islamisation the third civil war and the caliphate of Marwan II the overthrow of the Umayyad caliphate\n\nThe first edition established itself as a balanced and approachable text for undergraduates and others interested in the early history of Islam.

This book was generally well received by reviewers and has proved useful for its intended readership. Since it has been out of print for some time and in any case was available only as a (rather expensive) hardback, it has now been decided to reissue it in paperback. The opportunity has been taken to correct a few errors (for pointing out which I am grateful to reviewers) and to add a postscript surveying some of the important work relevant to the Umayyad caliphate which has appeared since the first edition in 1986. The postscript also refers to a few works which should have been included in the original bibliography. For technical reasons it has not been possible to change the original text in three places where some expansion is required: At p. 83, with reference to the victory of Charles Martel over the Arabs, the date of 732 should probably be changed to 733. At the very least the article of M.Baudoit, ‘Localisation et datation de la première victoire remportée par Charles Martel contre les musulmans’, in Mémoires et documents publiés par la Societé de l’Ecole de Chartres, 12 (1955), 93–105 needs to be consulted on this question. Secondly, at p. 52, it is wrong to give the impression that the term mahdi is not known in accounts of events before the rising of al-Mukhtar: it occurs of course, apparently for the first time, in reports about the rising of the Tawwabun which took place just before that of al-Mukhtar. I am especially grateful for Michael Morony’s review (IJMES, 21 (1989)) for drawing attention to these points. I remain unconvinced, however, that the word mahdi originally lacked any eschatological significance. Finally, on p. 91 reference is made to the theory that Rusafat Hisham was not at the Rusafa which was ancient Sergiopolis but was rather to be identified with Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi near Palmyra. I\n\nxix\n\nxx\n\nForeword to the Second Edition\n\nought to have known, but did not, that that theory, proposed by Sauvaget and others, has been discredited by Oleg Grabar in his work on Qasr al-Hayr: City in the Desert: Qasr al-Hayr East (Cambridge, Ma: Harvard University Press 1978). There is now a convenient discussion of Ru?afat Hisham in the second edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam, s.v. ‘Rusafa’ (by C.-P.Haase), which explains too the problematic tradition that Hisham was there when he received the caliphal regalia. GRH. March 2000\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements\n\nBetween the general surveys of Islamic, Arab or Middle Eastern history, of which there are several of varying quality, and detailed monographs on particular aspects of Umayyad history, many of which are not in English, there is little that can be recommended confidently as an introduction to the importance, main events and personalities, and problems of the Umayyad period. The present work tries to provide such an introduction. The standard modern account of Umayyad history is Julius Wellhausen’s The Arab kingdom and its fall, first published in German in 1902 and translated into English in 1927. In spite of the inevitable dating of Wellhausen’s own political and religious outlook, and the criticisms of his method of source analysis made recently by Albrecht Noth, his book remains of fundamental importance for anyone wanting more than an introductory knowledge of Umayyad history, particularly its political and military events. The present work is certainly not intended to supersede The Arab kingdom. As an introduction, however, experience has shown that Wellhausen’s work is not especially suitable. Leaving aside the rather idiosyncratic English of its translation, it contains more detail than is readily absorbed, its presentation is not as clear as modern readers expect, and its concern with source criticism is not appreciated by those who do not have even a simplified traditional narrative against which to set it. Attempts to get students to read and digest Wellhausen usually result in puzzlement and the beginnings of a conviction that Umayyad history is too difficult for undergraduate study. But there is really little else, especially in English, which treats the period as a whole and which can serve as an introduction. M.A. Shaban’s first volume of his Islamic history. A new interpretation, it is true, is readily available and does provide a lively narrative coverage of the period. Its interpretation, however, seems to me to be frequently questionable and on occasion only loosely related to\n\nxxi\n\nxxii\n\nPreface\n\nthe sources, and the title itself indicates that it was not conceived as an introduction. Similarly, Patricia Crone’s Slaves on horses seems to me a brilliant analysis of the development of the early Islamic state and society but not a book for relative beginners since it presumes, rather than provides, a fairly detailed acquaintance with the events of the period. There still seems a need, therefore, for the sort of introduction which I have attempted here. Given, then, that the present work is not attempting to provide a wholly new version of the Umayyad period, and that much of it depends on the findings of the many scholars who have contributed to our understanding of Umayyad history, it has seemed unnecessary to provide references to the original Arabic or other sources. Readers capable of studying the primary sources themselves will easily be able to track them down in the secondary works to which references are normally confined in my notes. These notes are usually a guide to further reading, with readers of English primarily in mind, and are not necessarily the sources of particular statements, but in a general way they indicate the scholars and works to which I have been most indebted. Neither the references in my notes nor the bibliography given at the end claim to be complete or extensive, but I hope that I have mentioned most works of fundamental importance. My special thanks are due to my colleague Dr David Morgan, who kindly read the whole typescript and whose feeling for both history and style has undoubtedly saved me from a number of blunders; to my wife Joyce who has similarly read and commented on the typescript; to Sue Harrop, the Cartographer at the School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London, for help with the maps; and to Peter Sowden who first suggested that I write the book and then gently prodded until it was done. For the remaining limitations, imperfections and errors I am responsible.\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction: The Importance of the Umayyad Period and its Place in Islamic History In the summer or autumn of AD 661, Mu‘awiya b. Abi Sufyan, governor of Syria since 639 and already acclaimed by his Syrian followers as caliph (khalifa), religious and political leader of the Muslim state, entered the Iraqi garrison town of Kufa. In historical tradition this event is seen as bringing to an end a bitter period of civil war among the Arabs, achieving the reunification under one ruler of all the territories conquered by them, and initiating the caliphate of the Umayyad dynasty of which Mu‘awiya was the founder. The dynasty was to rule for 90 years or so until its overthrow and replacement by that of the ‘Abbasids in 749–50. The Umayyad dynasty was the first to emerge in the Middle East following the conquest of the region by the Arabs, a conquest which had begun in the 630s and was still continuing for much of the Umayyad period. Apart from this fact, however, what was the importance of the period of Umayyad rule, a period which in its details is often complex and confusing, and how has it traditionally been regarded by Muslims in relation to the history of Islam? The answer to the first part of this question is provided by discussion of the two concepts of islamisation and arabisation, referring to two related but essentially distinct historical processes.\n\nIslamisation The term ‘islamisation’ refers both to the extension of the area under Muslim rule and to the acceptance of Islam as their religion by peoples of different faiths, but in the Umayyad period the question is further complicated by the fact that Islam itself was developing from its still to us not completely understood origins into something approaching the religion with which we are familiar. One should not imagine that Islam as we know it came fully formed out of Arabia with the Arabs at the time of their conquest of the Middle East and\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nwas then accepted or rejected, as the case might be, by the non-Arab peoples. Although many of the details are obscure and often controversial, it seems clear that Islam as we know it is largely a result of the interaction between the Arabs and the peoples they conquered during the first two centuries or so of the Islamic era which began in AD 622.1 During the Umayyad period, therefore, the spread of Islam and the development of Islam were taking place at the same time, and a discussion of islamisation has to begin with some consideration of the importance of the Umayyad period for the development of Islam. In the first place, it was under the Umayyads that there began to emerge that class of religious scholars which eventually became the leading authority within Sunni Islam and which is chiefly responsible for shaping the historical and religious tradition which has come down to us. In effect, it was this class which led the development of Islam as we know it, and it is important to remember that it emerged largely in opposition to the Umayyad government. The Umayyads had their own conception of Islam, itself developing with time and different circumstances, but on the whole we see the religion from the viewpoint of the religious scholars. In the emergence of this class the most important region was Iraq, and in Iraq Kufa was the leading centre. Other regions tended to follow its lead. Building on and reacting against the ideas and practices available in Kufa and other centres, from the second half of the Umayyad period onwards groups of Muslim scholars tried to develop and put on a sound footing what they saw as a true form of Islam. In doing so they frequently accused the Umayyads of impious or unislamic behaviour. The main concept which these scholars developed and worked with was that of the Sunna. This idea went through several stages but increasingly came to be identified with the custom and practice of the Prophet Muhammad, which was to serve as the ideal norm of behaviour for his followers, and was eventually accepted as the major source of Muslim law alongside the Koran. Increasingly, Muslim ideas, practices and institutions came to be justified by reference to the Sunna, the words and deeds of Muhammad as transmitted by his companions to later generations. The proponents of the Sunna as thus understood became increasingly influential, and political and religious developments after the Umayyads had been overthrown resulted in the final crystallisation of the Sunni form of Islam with the religious scholars, the guardians of the Sunna, as its leading authority.2\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nNot all Muslims, though, accepted the primacy or even the legitimacy of the Sunna, and the Umayyad period also saw the emergence of the two other main forms of Islam, Shi‘ism and Kharijism. Tradition dates the fragmentation of a previously united Islam into the three main forms which we know today (Sunnis, Shi‘ites and Kharijites) to the time of the first civil war (656–61), which ended with the accession of Mu‘awiya to the caliphate. However, just as the development of Sunni Islam was a slow process which only began under the Umayyads, so too Shi‘ism and Kharijism were not born in one instant. They too developed in opposition to the Umayyads, in a number of distinct movements which each had individual characteristics, and again Iraq was of prime importance. Kufa was the centre of the development of Shi‘ism in the Umayyad period. As early as 670, but especially after the revolt of Mukhtar in 685–7, Kufa saw a number of movements aimed at overthrowing the Umayyads and appointing a relative of the Prophet, usually a descendant of his cousin and son-in-law ‘Ali, as imam, which title the Shi‘ites tend to prefer to caliph. Where these Shi‘ite movements differed from one another was in the particular member of the Prophet’s family whom they favoured and in certain other doctrines they developed; what they had in common was devotion to the Prophet’s family and insistence that membership of it was a sine qua non for the imam. Some of them developed more extreme beliefs, such as acceptance of the imam as an incarnation of God and a doctrine of the transmigration of souls. It seems that from an early date the conquered non-Arab peoples were attracted to the Shi‘ite movements, and it may be that some of their doctrines were influenced by the previous beliefs of these non-Arab supporters. Shi‘ism has a long and complex history which extends well beyond the Umayyad period, but it was then that its basic character was established.3 The basic principle of Kharijism was a demand for piety and religious excellence as the only necessary qualification for the imam, and a rejection of the view that he should belong to the family of the Prophet, as the Shi‘ites demanded, or to the tribe of the Prophet (Quraysh), as the Sunnis required. Like Shi‘ism, Kharijism too was manifested in a number of movements, some relatively moderate and others more extreme. The extremists tended to insist on the rejection of all other Muslims, regarding them as infidels and therefore liable to be killed unless they ‘repented’ and ‘accepted Islam’, that is, unless\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nthey recognised the Kharijite imam and accepted the Kharijite form of Islam. This fierce rejection of other Muslims, however, involving the duty of rebellion against what was regarded as an illegitimate government, became increasingly difficult to maintain except in areas remote from the authority of the government or in times when the authority of the government for some reason collapsed. In Basra, the second of the Iraqi garrison towns, on the other hand, a more moderate form of Kharijism was elaborated and spread to eastern Arabia and North Africa. It is this form of Kharijism which has survived into the modern world.4 Each of these three main Muslim groups came to hold that Islam should be open to all peoples and that all should enjoy the same status within it regarding rights and duties. The development of this idea too, of Islam as a universal religion, can be traced to the Umayyad period, again in circles opposed to the dynasty. Although it can be debated whether the Koran was addressed to all men or to the Arabs only, the Umayyads and the Arab tribesmen who first conquered the Middle East regarded their religion as largely exclusive of the conquered peoples. There was no sustained attempt to force or even persuade the conquered peoples to accept Islam, and it was assumed that they would remain in their own communities paying taxes to support the conquerors. Although from the start there was some movement of the conquered into the community of the conquerors, the separation of Arabs from non-Arabs was a basic principle of the state established as a result of the conquests. This is clear both from the procedure which a non-Arab had to adopt in order to enter Islam and from the fact that there were, from time to time, official measures designed to prevent such changes of status. Islam was in fact regarded as the property of the conquering aristocracy. In order to attach himself to the religion and society of the Arabs, a non-Arab had to become the client (mawla, pl. mawali) of an Arab tribe. In other words, in order to become a Muslim, something which it is possible to see as a social or political as much as a religious move, he had to acquire an Arab patron and become a sort of honorary member of his patron’s tribe, adding the tribal name to his own new Muslim one, even though he and his descendants were in some ways treated as second-class Muslims. It is evident, therefore, that membership of Islam was equated with possession of an Arab ethnic identity.5 Nevertheless, association with the elite in this way did have advantages for some, and at various times in different places we hear\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nof large numbers of non-Arabs attempting to enter Islam by becoming mawali but being prevented from doing so, or at least from having their changed status recognised, by local Umayyad governors. Probably the best-known example was in Iraq around 700 when large numbers of local non-Arab cultivators sought to abandon their lands and flee into the Arab garrison towns to enter Islam as mawali, only to be forced back by the Umayyad governor al-Hajjaj who refused to recognise their claims. In the long run it proved impossible to maintain the isolation of conquerors and conquered from one another in this way, and attempts to do so only served to alienate further those Muslim groups which had come to see Islam as a religion open to all. The problem for the Umayyads was that they had come to power as leaders of a conquering Arab elite and to have allowed the conquered peoples to enter Islam en masse would have abolished or at least weakened the distinction between the elite and the masses. The crucial privileges of Islam, from this point of view, were in the area of taxation. In principle the Arabs were to be the recipients of the taxes paid by the non-Arabs. If the conquered peoples were allowed to become Muslims, and to change their position from that of payers to that of recipients of taxes, the whole system upon which the Umayyads depended would collapse. But as the pressure from the non-Arabs built up, and the universalist notion of Islam became stronger, this problem became increasingly urgent for the dynasty and played a major part in the generally negative attitude of Muslims towards the Umayyad dynasty.6 How far the development of Islam in the Umayyad period involved radical changes in religious practices or beliefs is not easy to say. Broadly speaking, Muslim tradition assumes that the fundamental institutions of Islam—such things as belief in Muhammad as a prophet, acceptance of the Koran in the form in which we know it as the word of God, and performance of the main rituals such as the five times daily prayer (salat) and the annual pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) —existed at the beginning of the Umayyad period and were accepted equally by the Umayyads and their opponents. The difficulty is to decide how far our Muslim sources, which are relatively late in the form in which we have them, are reading back later conditions into an earlier period. Sometimes, certainly, we have hints that the situation was not so static or so uniform as the tradition generally implies. For example we are told that Muslim rebels supporting Ibn al-Ash‘ath against the\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nUmayyads in the early years of the eighth century accused the caliph of ‘murdering’ the ritual prayer (salat) and called for vengeance for it, although what this meant and what exactly was involved, if anything specific, is not spelled out. 7 Even such tantalisingly obscure hints are relatively scarce, and when we do sometimes have more substantial information its significance seems often to be limited in one of two ways. First, the information may centre on a point which seems to be relatively minor. For instance, much play is made with the charge that the Umayyads insisted on delivering the khutba (in the early period a speech or sermon given usually in the mosque by the caliph or his representative and often dealing with secular as well as more purely religious affairs) while sitting, contrary to what is alleged to have been the practice established by the Prophet and his immediate successors. This is supposed to be a sign of the haughtiness of the Umayyads, refusing to stand before their subjects and preferring, like kings, to remain seated. Even though the detail may have lost some of its significance because of the later decline in importance of the khutba and its associated institutions and ceremonies, however, it is difficult to see arguments about the correct posture for the khutba as of fundamental importance for the development of Islam. In the way in which the practice is presented by Muslim tradition, it does not provide grounds for arguing that the outward forms of Islam underwent great and radical changes under the Umayyads.8 Secondly, even when the information is apparently more weighty, the impression is usually given that the Umayyads were perverting some orthodox practice or belief which already existed and was widely accepted by Muslims. There is no suggestion that basic religious ideas were still in a state of flux and that ‘orthodoxy’ (an ambiguous term in Islam since there is no central authority to say what is and what is not orthodox) was only slowly developing. We are told, for instance, that some of the Umayyads tried to make Jerusalem a centre of pilgrimage, but the sources imply that this was against the background of an already generally accepted practice of annual pilgrimage to Mecca which had been established as the cultic centre of Islam from the time of the Prophet. The reader should be aware of such preconceptions in the sources and consider the possibility that there may not have been, as yet, any firmly established cultic centre in Islam.9 Any attempt to argue that there were during the Umayyad period more fundamental religious developments than the sources allow\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfor, therefore, involves a certain amount of ‘reading between the lines’ of Muslim tradition and using whatever evidence is available outside the Muslim literary sources. A recent discussion using such methods has questioned whether the name ‘Islam’, as the designation for the religion of the Arabs, existed much before the end of the seventh century.10 Muslim tradition itself, though, has proved remarkably impervious to analysis with such questions in mind, and one’s attitude to the question of the extent of the religious development of Islam in the Umayyad period must depend greatly on one’s attitude to the value of Muslim sources for the history of the period, and especially the earlier part. The spread of Islam during this period, as already indicated, has to be viewed on two levels, that of its territorial expansion and that of its acceptance by the conquered non-Arab peoples from a variety of religious backgrounds. Muslim tradition is generally more concerned with the former process. When an area is under Muslim rule and subject to Muslim law, that area is regarded as a part of the Muslim world (dar alIslam), even though the majority of its population may remain nonMuslim. Strictly speaking, only Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians (these last known as majus) were to be allowed to refuse to accept Islam and maintain their existence as separate religious communities under Muslim rule, but in practice toleration was frequently extended more widely. From this point of view, then, the extensive conquests made under the Umayyads were an extension of Islam. At the beginning of the Umayyad period Arab Muslim rule did not extend much further west than modern Libya or further east than the eastern regions of Iran, and even within these areas many regions must have been held only precariously or merely nominally. By the end of the dynasty all of North Africa and southern and central Spain were included in the boundaries of the Muslim world, and in the east the extension of control into central Asia and northern India prepared the way for later advances in those areas. In the west the garrison town of Qayrawan was founded about 670 in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia), and this served as the base for further westward expansion. ‘Uqba b. Nafi‘ is subsequently said to have marched as far as the Atlantic before being killed by the still unsubdued Berbers, but it was not until the end of the century that regions of modern Algeria and Morocco were substantially pacified and the Berbers brought into Islam, but keeping their own language and tribal\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nsystem. This development is associated with the governorship of Hassan b. Nu‘man in Ifriqiya (683–707). It was Hassan’s successor, Musa b. Nusayr, who initiated the invasion of Spain in 711, sending his Berber client (mawla) Tariq to lead the expedition. It is from this Tariq that Gibraltar takes its name (Jabal Tariq, ‘the hill of Tariq’). In the east too the years around 700 saw major advances. Al-Hajjaj, governor of the eastern part of the Umayyad territories from 694 to 714, sent his generals Ibn al-Ash‘ath against the ruler of Kabul, Qutayba b. Muslim into the territories lying beyond the river Oxus (Jayhun or Amu Darya in Muslim works), and Muhammad b. al-Qasim into northern India. Qutayba is said to have reached the borders of China and sent an embassy demanding submission from the ‘king of China’. The extent and effectiveness of these expeditions may sometimes be open to question, but it is clear that Arab Muslim control was extended and consolidated in the east under the Umayyads.11 The spread of Islam among the non-Arab peoples of the conquered regions is much less explicitly described in our sources. At the outset of the Umayyad period it is clear that very few of the conquered peoples had accepted Islam, however we understand this last phrase (islam literally means ‘submission’). But by the end of the period, in spite of the initial attempt by the Arabs to keep themselves apart religiously and socially from their subjects, and in spite of the refusal by caliphs and governors to allow the non-Arabs to enjoy the advantages of acceptance of Islam, large numbers of the subject peoples had come to identify themselves as Muslims. The spread of Islam vertically in this way is clearly a complex process, depending on a variety of factors which were not the same in every area or among every group of the non-Arab population, and resulting in divergent rates of progress. Because of the silence or ambiguity of the sources we are often reduced to speculation about causes and the spread of the process. For example, we know very little about the islamisation of Syria and there are only one or two references in non-Muslim sources which seem to indicate substantial islamisation of the local peoples during the Umayyad period. On the other hand, the Muslim sources have many references to the difficulties caused to Umayyad governors of Iraq and Khurasan when large numbers of nonArab non-Muslims attempted to accept Islam by becoming mawali in the early decades of the eighth century, but they still leave many questions unanswered or answered at best ambiguously. So far as the evidence enables us to judge, and leaving aside the Berbers whose society and way of life made them likely allies for\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nthe Arabs in the wars of conquest, it seems to have been in lower Iraq, Khurasan and Syria that Islam made the most significant advances among the subjects peoples in the Umayyad period. In western Persia and Egypt, on the other hand, it seems that islamisation in this sense was relatively slow and that it was not until after the dynasty had been overthrown that Islam became the religion of the majority in these areas.12 In spite of our uncertainties, it seems clear that the Umayyad period was crucial for the process of Islamisation in all its forms.\n\nArabisation By ‘arabisation’ I mean the spread of a culture characterised above all by its use of the Arabic language in the area which had become subject to Arab Muslim rule. Although associated with the process of islamisation, arabisation is a distinct movement as can be seen from the fact that important communities of Jews and Christians survived in the Islamic Middle East into modern times. These communities maintained their religious traditions in spite of the fact that they had renounced the everyday languages which they had used before the Arab conquest and had adopted Arabic. Conversely, Persia presents a striking example of a region which largely accepted Islam as its religion but maintained its pre-Islamic language at first in everyday and later in literary use, although, of course, the language underwent significant changes in the early Islamic period. Again one has to take into account that Arabic itself changed as it spread and was elaborated in the process of interaction between Arabs and non-Arabs. Put crudely, as the non-Arab peoples adopted Arabic, so their own linguistic habits and backgrounds affected the language, leading to significant changes and to the formation of different dialects. The result of this evolution is usually described as Middle Arabic as opposed to Classical Arabic, which is identified with the language of the Koran and of the poetry which, it is claimed, originated in pre-Islamic Arabia. The origin and nature of Classical Arabic itself, though, is to some extent a topic of controversy. What led to the adoption or rejection of Arabic by nonArabic speakers is obviously a very complex question involving consideration of political and social relationships as well as more purely linguistic ones.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn attempting to chart the progress of arabisation the difficulties again arise from the lack of explicit information on the topic in our literary sources and from the paucity of written material surviving from the Umayyad period. For instance, although it has been suggested that Jews of all sorts began to speak Arabic as early as the seventh century, the process of change must have been gradual and our earliest texts written in Judaeo-Arabic (that is, the form of Middle Arabic used by Jews and written in Hebrew rather than Arabic script) come from the ninth century. Our earliest Christian Arabic texts (Arabic written in the Greek script) have been dated to the eighth century, but there has been some argument about the dating. On the other hand, from later developments we know that Persian must have survived as the spoken language of the majority of Iranians during the Umayyad period, but our sources only rarely and ambiguously let us see that it was so, and almost all of our source material on the history of Persia under the Umayyads is in Arabic. More concrete evidence is provided by the administrative papyri which have survived from Egypt. In spite of the limited range of subjects with which they are concerned, they at least enable us to see a gradual change from Greek to Arabic in the language of the administration. Furthermore, our literary sources report that around 700 it was ordered that henceforth the government administration should use Arabic rather than the languages which had been used before the Arab conquest and which had continued in use thus far. This could indicate that there was at that time a significant number of non-Arabs with sufficient command of Arabic at least for the purposes of administration, since the bureaucracy continued to rely overwhelmingly on non-Arabs. The change of language in the bureaucracy did not happen overnight, and the sources are not unanimous about when it was ordered, but in the development of arabisation it seems to have been a significant step. Why and how Arabic, and with it the other features which seem to make Islamic culture in the Middle East significantly Arab and distinguish it from others, spread is, therefore, still debatable. Eventually, as we know, the adoption of Arabic for most purposes became general in Syria, Iraq and Egypt while the Berbers and Persians, in spite of their acceptance of Islam and therefore of Arabic as their sacred language, continued to use their own languages for everyday purposes. We can assume that arabisation, like islamisation, progressed a long way under the Umayyads, but precise evidence is hard to come by.13\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nThe Umayyads in Muslim Tradition The second question asked at the beginning of this chapter concerned the way in which the Umayyad dynasty has been regarded by Muslim tradition and how it has been seen in the context of Islamic history generally. Discussion of this question, which involves some consideration of the way in which our Muslim sources for the period came to be formed, is a necessary condition for an understanding of the narrative history which the remainder of this work undertakes. Even allowing for the qualifications which will be made shortly, there is no doubt that in its broad outlines as well as in its details Muslim tradition is generally hostile to the Umayyads. When the two can be distinguished, Shi‘ite tradition is more hostile than that of the Sunnis, but many of our sources contain material which reflects both Shi‘ite and Sunni points of view so that there is some justification, for our purposes here, in talking about Muslim tradition as a whole.14 The hostility of tradition is reflected in both what the tradition reports and the way in which it reports it. We are told that before Islam the Umayyad family was prominent in the opposition to Muhammad among the Meccans and that most of the members of the family only accepted Islam at the last moment when it became clear that the Prophet was going to be victorious. Once inside the Muslim community, however, they exploited circumstances, and, by skilful political manipulation not entirely free from trickery, they obtained power, displacing those whose claims to the leadership were based on long service to Islam, piety, and relationship to the Prophet. In power they pursued policies which at best paid no regard to the requirements of Islam and at worst were positively anti-Islamic. Among the charges brought against them, some of the most prominent are that they made the caliphate hereditary within the Umayyad family; that they oppressed and even caused the death of numerous men of religion and of the Prophet’s family, most notably of the Prophet’s grandson Husayn; that they attacked the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, going so far as to bombard Mecca with catapults on two occasions— an image which may well symbolise the conception of the Umayyads in tradition; and that they prevented non-Muslims from accepting Islam and obtaining the rights due to them. They ruled by force and tyranny. Literary works came to be produced devoted to cataloguing the crimes of the Umayyads, singing the praises of their opponents,\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nand explaining why God allowed the community to fall under the sway of these godless tyrants. The best-known of these works are those of Jahiz in the ninth and Maqrizi in the fifteenth centuries.15 Tradition expresses its hostility to the dynasty above all by insisting that they were merely kings and refusing to recognise them, with one exception, as caliphs. The caliphate, according to tradition, emerged in Medina on the death of Muhammad in order to provide a leader for the Muslims in succession to him. The title khalifa is interpreted as meaning ‘successor of the Prophet’, in full khalifat rasul Allah, and the caliph was to be motivated solely by the interests of the Muslims. The Muslim theory of the caliphate took time to evolve and was never static, but two ideas in particular came to be prominent. First, the caliph was to be chosen, from among those with the necessary qualifications, by some sort of election. How this election was to be carried out was never agreed on but the feeling was that the caliph should not simply seize the office by force or be appointed by one man with no consultation of the Muslims. Secondly, the caliph’s authority was to be limited, in particular in the sphere of religion, where the real authorities, the guardians of the Sunna and the heirs of the Prophet, were the religious scholars (the ‘ulama’). In effect, the caliph was simply to maintain the conditions in which the religious scholars could get on with their task. (All this, of course, refers primarily to the Sunni view of the caliphate. The Shi‘ites and Kharijites had different ideas.) 16 A sharp distinction is then made between the idea of a caliph and that of a king, between caliphate (khilafa) and kingship (mulk). Unlike the caliph, the king (malik, pl. muluk) is an arbitrary, worldly ruler whose power depends ultimately on force. The symbolic type of king for Muslim tradition is the Byzantine emperor (Qaysar, i.e., ‘Caesar’) and the Sasanid shah (Kisra, i.e., ‘Chosroes’, ‘Khusraw’). When tradition denigrates Umayyad rule as kingship, therefore, it is putting the Umayyads in the same category as all the other kings of this world and contrasting them with its own ideal of Islamic government. It is not the personal qualities or defects of a ruler which determine primarily whether he is to be accorded the status of caliph or discarded as a king, although the personal piety or wickedness of an individual could affect the question. There were some personally upright Umayyads just as there were corrupt and debauched members of the ‘Abbasid dynasty which took over the caliphate\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nwhen the Umayyads were overthrown. The latter, however, are all accepted as caliphs by Sunni tradition while the former, with the one exception, are merely kings. Nor does it depend on the selfdesignation of the dynasty. The Umayyads do not appear to have used the title malik (king) and they did not, at least in the earlier Umayyad period, affect in a very marked way the paraphernalia of kingship such as a crown, throne or sceptre. In contrast to them, the early ‘Abbasid rule was associated much more with the symbols of a traditional oriental despotism.17 In fact it was the Umayyads’ use of the title khalifa which probably played an important part in the tradition’s classification of them as kings. Whereas Muslim tradition regards the title as an abbreviation of khalifat rasul Allah, signifying successor of the Prophet, the Umayyads, as evidenced by coins and inscriptions, used the title khalifat Allah. While it is not completely impossible to reconcile the use of this title with the traditional understanding of khalifa, it does seem likely that the Umayyads’ conception of the title and the office was different. Khalifat Allah (Caliph of God) almost certainly means that they regarded themselves as deputies of God rather than as mere successors to the Prophet, since it is unlikely that khalifa here means successor (one cannot be a successor of God) and elsewhere khalifa is frequently met with in the sense of deputy. In other words, the title implies that the Umayyads regarded themselves as God’s representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars.18 Above all the charge of kingship is connected with the decision of Mu‘awiya to appoint his own son Yazid as his successor to the caliphate during his own lifetime. This event, more than anything else, seems to be behind the accusation that Mu‘awiya perverted the caliphate into a kingship. The episode will be considered more fully later, but, in the light of the Sunni conception of the nature of the caliphate, what was wrong with Mu‘awiya’s appointment of Yazid was that one man took it upon himself to choose a caliph with no consultation with the representatives of Islam (whoever they might be) and without even a token nod to the idea that the office should be elective. It is probable that such ideas were not generally held, even if they yet existed, in the time of Mu‘awiya. But according to tradition he acted as a king in this matter, introducing the hereditary principle into the caliphate, and the dynasty which he thus founded, and which maintained the general principle that the ruler nominated\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nhis successor, was thus a line of kings. Yazid’s personal failings, which are certainly underlined by tradition, merely seem to reinforce the message and are not really the source of opposition to his appointment.19 It should be clear, then, that tradition is generally hostile to the Umayyad dynasty. It is, nevertheless, true that the same Muslim tradition transmits some material which is more ambiguous, sometimes even overtly favourable to the Umayyads. For example, the administrative and political ability of caliphs like Mu‘awiya and ‘Abd al-Malik is admitted, and some of the ‘Abbasids are said to have expressed admiration for this aspect of their predecessors’ work. Even on more strictly religious questions, the tradition sometimes seems less clear-cut than one would expect. The name ‘the year of the (reestablishment of the) community’, which is applied both to the year in which Mu‘awiya received acknowledgment in Kufa after his defeat of ‘Ali and to that in which ‘Abd al-Malik similarly ended the second civil war, recognises the virtues of these two caliphs in rescuing the community from a period of internal dissension. Indeed, one often finds in tradition a fearfulness for the fate of the community under such enemies of the Umayyads as ‘Ali and Ibn al-Zubayr, whatever their personal merits might have been. In legal traditions some Umayyads, notably Marwan, himself caliph for a short time and ancestor of one of the two branches of the Umayyad family to acquire the caliphate, are frequently referred to as makers of legal rulings, and they often come out quite favourably even in comparison with some of the most important of the Prophet’s companions. On occasion a maxim which one tradition ascribes to, say, Marwan will appear elsewhere as a maxim of the Prophet himself. Even the bombardment of Mecca and the consequent damage to the Ka‘ba, which is a key point in the traditional complaints against the dynasty, can be toned down. Among the various reports of these events, some say that the fire which damaged the Ka‘ba while Mecca was being bombarded came about accidentally, and some even say that it was caused by the carelessness of one of the defenders of Mecca, even Ibn al-Zubayr himself being named. Here we are not concerned with the historical accuracy of these reports, merely with the fact that they are transmitted even though the tenor of Muslim tradition is broadly anti-Umayyad.20 Even the treatment of the one Umayyad caliph who is recognised as such in tradition and exempted from the accusation of kingship\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nlevelled at the others, ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (‘Umar II, 717–20), may be ambiguous. In one way to nominate him as the only caliph in a line of kings serves, of course, to underline the contrast between the pious ‘Umar and the rest of the dynasty, but equally it could be argued that the existence of ‘Umar to some extent rescues the dynasty from complete condemnation. While the traditions about him emphasise the links on his mother’s side with ‘Umar I, the second successor of Muhammad and one of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs, they also do not hide the fact that on his father’s side he was a leading member of the Umayyad family. His father was brother of the caliph ‘Abd al-Malik and governor of Egypt for most of the latter’s caliphate. Evidently, therefore, the Umayyads could produce a genuine caliph and one could conclude that there was nothing inherently bad in the family.21 In order to understand both the generally negative attitude towards the Umayyads in Muslim tradition and the fact that the tradition transmits material which is apparently more favourable to the dynasty, it is necessary to understand the way in which the tradition came to be formed—the way in which our Muslim literary sources originated, were transmitted, collected and finally committed to writing in the form in which we know them. It seems likely that it was not until the later part of the Umayyad period that traditions, religious or historical (and the distinction is not always clear), came to be committed to writing with any frequency. Before that time they were generally transmitted orally in short, separate reports which were self-contained and relatively easy to memorise. As it became more common to put them in a written form, however, these short reports could be united into more complex units, compiled around a theme or organised in a narrative framework. In the later Umayyad and early ‘Abbasid period, then, scholars such as Abu Mikhnaf (d. 774), Ibn Ishaq (d. 761), or ‘Awana (d. 764) began to compile ‘books’ by collecting the traditions available and organising them around a theme such as the battle of the Camel, the second civil war, or even the history of the caliphate. They may have simply dictated the relevant material to their disciples, which would account for the different versions of works attributed to a particular scholar which have come down to us from different disciples, or they may have put it in writing themselves. The material thus collected was then transmitted to later generations which treated it in a variety of ways. It might be again\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nbroken up and put together with material from different sources in order to make it relate to a different theme; long narratives might be abridged by omitting material considered irrelevant; short narratives might be filled out by interpolation or by linking material together without making it clear where the link occurs or even that it has been made; material might fall out of circulation or it might be reshaped consciously or subconsciously by substitution of words or phrases, by the addition of glosses, or even by formulating entirely new material. It is obvious, therefore, that there was plenty of scope for the material to change in the course of its transmission, and it would be natural that it should change in accordance with changing political, social and religious circumstances. Generally speaking, the material would have been constantly revised to make it relevant and acceptable, and the original significance and context of the material would come to be forgotten. This process continued for some generations until, in the ninth and tenth centuries, written versions of the material were produced which have survived as our earliest Muslim literary sources, our earliest examples of Muslim historical writing, biography, Koranic exegesis, and so on. In fact, of course, the process continued even beyond the ninth and tenth centuries: even in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Muslim scholars were selecting from and reshaping the works of their predecessors, but, when we have the material in both its early and its later form, we can clearly see what has happened to it in the course of transmission. Our problem with our earliest sources for the Umayyad period is that the material prior to the ninth and tenth centuries has been lost and we have to depend on relatively late versions of it transmitted to us by scholars such as Baladhuri (d. 892) and Tabari (d. 923).22 An important point is that a decisive role in the collection, transmission and reduction to writing of the material was played by scholars representative of the opposition to the Umayyads. That is, scholars associated with the Muslim circles hostile to the dynasty, predominantly in Iraq, took a leading role in collecting, arranging and editing the material. If we add to this the fact that the written material which has come down to us was produced in the period after the Umayyads had been overthrown, under the caliphate of the ‘Abbasids who had supplanted them, it is not hard to understand why it has the fundamental hostility to the Umayyads which has been indicated. It is not a question of the ‘Abbasids employing scholars to produce deliberate justifications for ‘Abbasid rule, rather\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nthat the scholars involved inherited material from, and were themselves part of the tradition of, Muslim opposition to the Umayyads. Although we often refer to scholars like Baladhuri and Tabari as historians inasmuch as they were concerned with producing a picture of the past and its relationship to their own times, objectivity, which has been regarded as at least a desideratum of the historian since the nineteenth century, is not to be expected from them. Fundamentally they were religious scholars and it is useful to remember that Tabari, whose Ta’rikh (a mixture of history and chronicle) is one of our fullest sources of information on early Islam and the Umayyad period, wrote a Koranic commentary which is even more voluminous and which, regarding the life of Muhammad, often provides more ‘historical’ information than is available in the Ta’rikh. If the outlook of these scholars was likely to make them generally hostile to the Umayyads, however, certain things mitigated this hostility and help to explain the more ambiguous material which has been noted. Most importantly, the material collected and transmitted by any individual scholar may be traced ultimately to a wide variety of sources, including even pro-Umayyad sources, and there was no central directory imposing a censorship on the scholars. It used to be thought, following Wellhausen, that the scholars could all be classified as the representatives of one or another ‘school’, that the material associated with the name of a particular scholar would be biased to support the geographical and religious viewpoint of the ‘school’ to which he belonged. So Abu Mikhnaf was regarded as a representative of the Iraqis, Ibn Ishaq of the Medinese, and so on. But it is now recognised that one will find many different shades of opinion represented in the material transmitted under the name of any individual. Even the earliest of them already had an amount of material from which to select, and we cannot point to a particular time or individual as being decisive in the formation of the tradition. Any analysis of the tradition needs to take into account both its final editing and arranging and its earlier transmission.23 Secondly, the scholars were strongly aware of the element of continuity in the history of Islam, and to have been too hostile to the Umayyads, portraying them as non-Muslims for example, would have been incompatible with this sense of continuity. It may be that the traditions about ‘Umar II, linking the Umayyads with the period of Rightly Guided Caliphs, are particularly influenced by this sense\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nof continuity. Those scholars representing the Sunni tendency had a particular problem. If the legitimacy of the Umayyads was questioned too sharply, ammunition might be provided for the Shi‘ites, most of whom came to see ‘Ali as having been cheated not only by Mu‘awiya but also by the first two caliphs, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, who are of central importance for the Sunni concept of the transmission of the Prophet’s Sunna to the later community. Furthermore, Mu‘awiya himself was a companion of Muhammad, his secretary according to tradition, and one of the characteristics of Sunni Islam is its championing of the companions as sources of authoritative teaching, as against the Shi‘ites who viewed them in general with suspicion and as enemies of ‘Ali and the imams. Muslim tradition is virtually our only detailed source for the history of the Umayyad state. It should be obvious, therefore, that the nature of the tradition has to be borne in mind constantly when attempting to discuss the history of the period. For modern treatment of the Umayyads, see Appendix 2.\n\nNotes 1. C.H.Becker was one of the first to insist on the distinction between islamisation and arabisation, and he stressed too the crucial importance for the development of Islam as we know it of the interaction between Arabs and conquered peoples outside Arabia in the period after the Arab conquests. See his Islamstudien, i, 66–145, and in English his ‘The expansion of the Saracens’ in the Cambridge Mediaeval History, 1st edition 1911–36, ii, chapters 11 and 12. 2. This understanding of the emergence of the schools of religious scholars and their elaboration of the notion of Sunna depends on the results of J.Schacht’s persuasive, but still controversial, studies of early Muslim jurisprudence. See his Introduction to Islamic law, especially chapters 5 and 6, and the article ‘Fikh’ in EI2; for a more conservative analysis of the concept of Sunna, taking issue with Schacht, M.M.

The Muslim genealogical tradition divides the Arab people into two main groups which for convenience we may call ‘northerners’ and ‘southerners’, referring to the areas of Arabia which are regarded as their homelands. The ‘southerners’ are held to be descended from the biblical Joktan (Qahtan), a descendant of Noah, while Ishmael is the father of the ‘northerners’. Among the many tribal groups of whom Ishmael is seen as the ancestor was that of Quraysh, and the Umayyad family was a sub-group of Quraysh.1 In the pre-Islamic period Quraysh had settled in Mecca and taken control of the town together with its ancient sanctuary, the Ka‘ba, which, tradition tells us, Abraham had built at God’s command. In the course of time the Arabs had corrupted Abraham’s sanctuary and adopted polytheistic beliefs and practices, although they still regarded the Ka‘ba as the most important sanctuary of Arabia and pilgrims came to it from nearly all the Arab tribes. It was one of the main tasks of the Prophet Muhammad at the beginning of the seventh century to purify the Ka‘ba and restore its cult to the worship of the one true God. Muhammad himself was, like the Umayyads, a member of the tribe of Quraysh, and so too were the ‘Abbasids, the family which eventually displaced the Umayyads as caliphs. Indeed it seems to have become accepted quite early by most Muslims that only members of Quraysh could aspire to the office of caliph or imam.2 The specific descent of the Umayyads within the wider grouping of Quraysh begins with a certain ‘Abd Shams, son of ‘Abd Manaf of the tribe of Quraysh. The Umayyad family is sometimes designated by the slightly more general expression Banu (that is, descendants\n\n21\n\n22\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\nof) ‘Abd Shams. From ‘Abd Manaf to the Prophet Muhammad Muslim tradition counts five generations. If the names refer to real historical persons, therefore, ‘Abd Manaf must have lived about the second half of the fifth century. Among other offspring, ‘Abd Manaf is said to be the father of twin sons, one of whom was ‘Abd Shams and the other Hashim. In tradition these are the most important of ‘Abd Manaf’s descendants for, while ‘Abd Shams was the ancestor of the Umayyads, Hashim begat a line which included the Prophet Muhammad, his son-in-law and cousin ‘Ali, whom most Shi‘ite Muslims regard as the only rightful leader (imam) of the community after the death of the Prophet, and the ‘Abbasids. 3 It should not be surprising, then, that the traditions about the relations between ‘Abd Shams and Hashim and between their descendants often seem to prefigure the hostility which existed in Islamic times between the Umayyads and the descendants of Hashim. Since Muslim tradition generally supports the Banu Hashim against the Umayyads, the stories about their pre-Islamic history usually glorify the former at the expense of the latter. So we are told that ‘Abd Shams and Hashim were Siamese twins who had to be separated by cutting. The blood that thus flowed between them at their birth was a symbol of future events. Just as, in the book of Genesis, Esau lost his birthright to his younger twin Jacob, so ‘Abd Shams, who emerged from his mother before Hashim, failed to obtain the wealth, prestige and influence which accrued to Hashim. The son of ‘Abd Shams, Umayya, eponym of the Umayyad family, was notably unable to match the generosity of his uncle Hashim, and as a result Hashim obtained the prestigious offices of supplying food and drink to the pilgrims who came to Mecca. These offices were two of a number associated with the Ka‘ba which had been handed down in the family to which ‘Abd Manaf belonged. In the Islamic period the right of providing drink for the pilgrims was still associated with the Banu Hashim. 4 In spite of this, by the time of Muhammad it was the descendants of ‘Abd Shams who were in positions of wealth and power while the Banu Hashim was less to the fore. The Umayyads in fact appear as one of the leading families of Mecca at this period and by 624 they had become the leading Meccan family and, as such, leader of the Meccan opposition to Muhammad. 624 was the date of the first great victory of Muhammad and the Muslims over the still pagan Meccans at the battle of Badr. The leader of the Umayyad family at the time, Abu Sufyan, is said to have opposed the decision taken by other\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\n23\n\nleading Meccans to engage the Muslims in battle and consequently after the defeat he alone was able to preserve some prestige. Abu Sufyan, the head of the Umayyads, henceforth appears as the director of pagan Meccan opposition to Muhammad and Islam, an image which would naturally appeal to later Muslim opponents of the Umayyad caliphs. The opposition to Muhammad was, as we know, doomed to failure. By 629 he was able with his followers to occupy Mecca almost without fighting and receive the submission of most of these Meccans who still maintained their hostility to him and his religion. Already before this event, we are told, Abu Sufyan and other prominent Meccans, among them his son Mu‘awiya, had begun, seeing which way the wind was blowing, to go over to Muhammad, sometimes secretly. Naturally, these ‘conversions’ are the subject of many, frequently variant, accounts, differing parties wanting to make them earlier or later, providing attendant circumstances which confirm or call into question their sincerity, and so forth. It is generally accepted, however, that the fall of Mecca ended Meccan opposition to Islam and that Abu Sufyan and his family, notably his sons Yazid and Mu‘awiya, accepted Islam by this date at the latest. A derogatory expression which is sometimes used in Muslim tradition to refer to the Umayyads is al-tulaqa’, ‘the freedmen’. This is explained by the fact that the conquest of Mecca had made them slaves of Muhammad but he had chosen to set them free. However, tradition also reports that the Prophet was eager to secure and reinforce the allegiance of his former enemies like Abu Sufyan and, to this end, he made them special gifts after his conquest of Mecca, a tactic known as the ‘winning of the hearts’ (ta’lif al-qulub).5 One might have expected that the triumph of Islam in Mecca would lead to the disappearance of the former pagan leaders from positions of power and influence, but, while positions of central power certainly passed to figures known for their early and genuine acceptance of Islam, it seems that the former Meccan pagan nobility had qualities which were useful to the new order. We are told that Abu Sufyan himself was given positions of authority in the Yemen and in Ta’if even while the Prophet was still alive, and his sons Yazid and Mu‘awiya were put in command of some of the raiding forces sent to Syria after the Prophet’s death. When Syria eventually fell to the Arabs following the battle of Yarmuk in 636 and its Byzantine rulers were driven out, Yazid, the son of Abu Sufyan, became its second governor and, when he died soon afterwards, he was\n\n24\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\nsucceeded by his brother Mu‘awiya in 639. It was from this position as governor of Syria that Mu‘awiya, some fifteen years later, was to launch the campaign which brought him to the caliphate. This summary of the fortunes of the Umayyads in the pre-Islamic period and through into the early years of the Islamic era raises questions about authenticity which are probably insoluble. The image of the Umayyads as leading opponents of the Prophet and Islam, their late and opportunisitic acceptance of the new religion, and the antiquity of the rivalry between them and the Banu Hashim, all seem possible creations, or at least elaborations, of political and religious feelings against the Umayyads which developed during the course of their caliphate. Equally, the items of tradition which are more favourable towards the Umayyads, such as the story that Abu Sufyan lost an eye in the service of Islam and the Prophet promised him an eye in Paradise in compensation, or that it was Abu Sufyan’s battle cry which aroused the spirit of the Muslims at a crucial time in the conquest of Syria, could be remnants of pro-Umayyad propaganda during their caliphate or later. It seems best, therefore, to accept the above as a summary of what Muslim tradition tells us and to leave open the question of its basis in fact.6\n\nMu‘awiya’s Acquisition of the Caliphate Mu‘awiya became caliph and founder of the Umayyad dynasty as a result of the events of a period of about five years, between 656 and 661, during which the Arabs were divided into several camps each hostile to the others. These internal hostilities led on a number of occasions to the outbreak of fighting among the recent conquerors of the heartlands of the Middle East. Muslim tradition knows this period as the Fitna (‘time of trial’), or Great Fitna to distinguish it from other, later periods of internecine conflict between Muslims. Modern writers usually refer to it as the first civil war of Islam. The Fitna came to be seen as a period of crucial importance and as the end of something like a Golden Age in the history of Islam: not only did it give rise to the Umayyad caliphate, it is traditionally regarded as the time when the three major Muslim sects—Sunnis, Shi‘ites and Kharijites—emerged from what had previously been a united community.7 In Muslim historical tradition the disputes of the Fitna appear largely as rivalries between different personalities, centring on the\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\n25\n\nquestion of who was the legitimate caliph and what were to be his powers. Modern scholars have sought to get behind this surface explanation and to uncover the social, political and religious tensions which came to breaking point at this time. In a general way, it seems clear that the Fitna was the result of tensions which developed among the Arabs as they were faced with the tremendous changes to their way of life associated with their rapid conquest of large areas of the Middle East, but individual scholars have emphasised different tensions. Some, like Wellhausen, stressed the rivalries which developed among the leading circle of Muslims in Medina, between the Meccans and Medinese among the Muslim elite, and between the more pious early Muslims and the later, opportunist converts like most of the Umayyads. Another approach, followed notably by H.A.R.Gibb, has been to stress the developing opposition between the tribesmen who made up the conquering armies, with their customary strong independence and primitive democracy, and the demands of the emerging central governmental institution headed by the caliph. The conflict between the two is seen to focus on the problem of what should be done with the land which was conquered. Should it, as the conquering tribesmen wanted, be shared out among those who had conquered it, or should it be treated as communal property for the benefit of all the Muslims, left to be cultivated by those who had done so before its conquest, and taxed by the state which would then share out or keep the proceeds as the caliph and his advisors saw fit? The latter solution, we are told, was adopted by the caliph ‘Umar (634–44). Gibb argued that in ‘Umar’s time the conquests were in full spate and the conquering tribesmen failed to understand the significance of his decision since they were still taking vast amounts of movable booty (slaves, wealth, livestock, and so on) and did not need the land itself. After ‘Umar’s death, however, the pace of conquest began to slow down, the acquisition of movable booty decreased, and the tribesmen began to resent the fact that the land which they had conquered had been taken away from them. Discontent among the tribesmen against the caliph, then, was the most important element in the outbreak of the Fitna, and the tension between the tribesmen and the government was its main theme. More recently Hinds and Shaban have argued that we should concentrate on divisions among the tribesmen themselves. They have focused on the situation in the garrison towns and have discerned rivalries between those who took part in the original\n\n26\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\nconquests and settlements and the newcomers who migrated from Arabia in the wake of the first conquests. These rivalries were exacerbated as the government tried to increase its control over the tribesmen by supporting the authority of leading tribal notables, who had usually arrived after the first conquests, against the leaders of lesser stature who had established their positions in the garrison towns earlier. Hinds in particular has produced a body of evidence which is impressive for its cohesiveness, but here we can leave aside detailed consideration of these arguments and concentrate on the importance of the Fitna for the Umayyads.8 We have seen that Muslim tradition portrays the Umayyads generally as late and rather reluctant in their acceptance of Islam. This generalisation, though, is subject to at least one notable exception. ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan was both a descendant of Umayya and an early Muslim, and after the death of the Prophet he was one of the inner circle which directed the affairs of the emergent Muslim state. In 644 he was chosen as the third caliph following the death of ‘Umar. Although an Umayyad, ‘Uthman is not counted as one of the Umayyad dynasty since he was chosen by the inner circle of early Muslims, owed his election to his status as an early Muslim, and made no attempt to appoint an Umayyad as his successor. It was under ‘Uthman that the Golden Age of early Islam began to become tarnished and the crisis which was to issue in civil war and the irrevocable division of the community developed. Opposition to him arose in several quarters, particularly in the garrison towns, and finally in the summer of 656 a band of tribesmen from the Egyptian garrison town of Fustat came to Medina where, after the failure of negotiations, they attacked and killed ‘Uthman in his house. There are a number of possible explanations for the rise of opposition to ‘Uthman, and Muslim tradition preserves whole lists of accusations made against him by his opponents. Prominent among these accusations is the charge that he practised nepotism by appointing his Umayyad relatives to important offices in the state. Indeed we are told that, in addition to confirming Mu‘awiya as governor of Syria, ‘Uthman appointed Umayyads to governorates in Egypt, Kufa and Basra, and that he gave the important office of keeper of the caliphal seal to another relative, the father of the future Umayyad caliph Marwan. This has been interpreted as being no more than a way in which ‘Uthman sought to increase his personal control in the provinces at a time when important administrative problems were arising, but more traditionally it has been seen as a\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\n27\n\nresult of a weakness in his personality and the ability of his clever and unscrupulous family to exploit this weakness. However we interpret it, tradition shows us the Umayyads to some extent rebuilding under ‘Uthman the influence and power which they had had before Islam.9 ‘Uthman’s murder was followed by the choice of ‘Ali, cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, as the next caliph. His appointment, however, was by no means universally welcomed: personal and political rivalries existed, and his opponents were able to use the circumstances in which he had come to power—following a killing which his opponents declared unjustified, and with the support of those who had carried out the killing—to impugn his legitimacy, even though he was not charged with having personally taken part in the murder of ‘Uthman. ‘Uthman’s Umayyad relations were prominent in the opposition to ‘Ali, but the first active resistance came, not from them, but from other Qurashis resentful of ‘Ali’s rise to power. The leaders of this first opposition to ‘Ali were ‘A’isha, the widow of Muhammad, and Talha and Al-Zubayr, former companions of Muhammad and members of the inner circle at the centre of the state. At the end of 656 they marched from Mecca, where they had first proclaimed their hostility to ‘Ali, to Basra in Iraq, where they raised an army to fight against him. Learning of this, ‘Ali too left the Hijaz (never again the centre of the caliphate) and came to the other Iraqi garrison town, Kufa, where he raised an army to fight the dissidents. The two forces met, in December 656, outside Basra in a battle known in tradition as the battle of the Camel, so called because the fighting wheeled around the camel upon which ‘A’isha sat in her litter. The result was a complete victory for ‘Ali; Talha and alZubayr were killed, and ‘A’isha taken off back to Medina to be held in limited confinement there.10 The chronology and exact course of events are somewhat vague, but generally tradition puts Mu‘awiya’s decision to come out openly against ‘Ali only after the battle of the Camel. At first, we are told, he limited himself to impugning ‘Ali’s legitimacy, demanding that those who had killed ‘Uthman be handed over for punishment in accordance with the law of blood vengeance, and arousing among his Syrian Arab supporters fury at ‘Uthman’s murder. Although not the closest relative of the murdered caliph, Mu‘awiya was the Umayyad with the strongest power base, having governed Syria for about fifteen years and, furthermore, being free from suspicion of\n\n28\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\nhaving benefited from ‘Uthman’s alleged nepotism since he owed his appointment in Syria to ‘Uthman’s predecessor, the venerable ‘Umar. At this time Mu‘awiya was not claiming the caliphate for himself, merely demanding vengeance for ‘Uthman and questioning ‘Ali’s right to rule. In the spring of 657 ‘Ali marched north from Kufa on campaign against Mu‘awiya and the latter, who had been attempting to wrest Egypt from ‘Ali’s governor, headed for Mesopotamia to meet him. The two met at Siffin, a site which has not been securely identified but which seems to have been in the vicinity of Raqqa but on the right bank of the Euphrates. It was late spring or early summer, and we are told that the armies faced each other for some time before fighting commenced. Then, according to the Muslim reports (contradicted by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes), ‘Ali’s men were on the point of victory when there occurred an episode which has become famous. What happened is to some extent obscure but it is generally accepted that Mu‘awiya’s men raised copies or parts of the Koran on the ends of their spears and ‘Ali’s men, or the more pious among them, seeing this, forced ‘Ali to stop fighting and enter into negotiation with Mu‘awiya. Whether the raising of the Korans was intended as a general reminder that both parties were Muslims and should not be fighting one another, or whether it was intended as a more specific signal that the dispute should be resolved by reference to the Word of God, is not clear, but there is a tendency to see it as no more than a ruse by the Syrians to get out of a difficult situation. The idea of it is credited, not to Mu‘awiya himself, but to his right-hand man, ‘Amr b. al-‘As. ‘Amr, who had previously led the Arab conquest of Egypt and had served as governor there before being removed by ‘Uthman, was not himself an Umayyad but another of those Meccans whose acceptance of Islam was regarded as opportunistic. During the Fitna he appears rather as Mu‘awiya’s evil genius, though this is perhaps a device to save the reputation of Mu‘awiya to some extent, and the implication is that he supported Mu‘awiya in order to win back the governorship of Egypt. The essence of the trick of the raising of the Korans is that ‘Amr is supposed to have realised that ‘Ali’s army included a large number of religious enthusiasts (the so called qurra’) and that sight of the Scripture would cause them to waver in their determination to fight. Whatever the truth of the matter, the episode is said to have led to the breaking off of the fighting. Discussions were held and the two\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\n29\n\nsides agreed to put their dispute to arbitration. Each side was to name a representative and, at an agreed time and place, the two representatives were to meet and arbitrate the dispute. Like the raising of the Korans, the arbitration too has become famous. Mu‘awiya appointed ‘Amr b. al-‘As as his representative while ‘Ali chose a former governor of Kufa and early Muslim with a reputation for piety, Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari. Why ‘Ali chose Abu Musa is something of a problem. He had been governor of Kufa when ‘Ali arrived there in pursuit of ‘A’isha, Talha and al-Zubayr before the battle of the Camel, and he had made it clear that he did not want to become involved in the Fitna, advising the Kufans to remain aloof. After ‘Ali gained possession of Kufa, Abu Musa was forced to leave the town. Now, however, we find him chosen as ‘Ali’s representative in the vital arbitration process. The only explanation which appears to make sense is that he was forced upon ‘Ali by those pious followers who had been instrumental in getting him to accept the arbitration principle in the first place. The traditions about the meeting of the arbitrators are confused and often contradictory. For one thing, it is not at all clear what they were to discuss. Was it merely the question of the legitimacy of ‘Uthman’s murder, or the choice of a caliph? For another, how was the arbitration to proceed? We are told that the Book of God and the Sunna were to be examined, but this raises questions about the significance of these terms at such an early date and how they were to provide answers for the problems facing the Muslims. Different dates and places for the meeting of the arbitrators are given, and this has led some to suggest that they met more than once and in different places. There is general agreement that the arbitration was inconclusive and that it broke up in disarray, but the reports about it do not really make sense. Abu Musa is said to have been tricked by ‘Amr b. al-‘As into publicly abandoning his support for ‘Ali on the understanding that ‘Amr would abandon his support for Mu‘awiya, but, after Abu Musa had fulfilled his side of the bargain, ‘Amr refused to honour his side. It has been pointed out that if such a blatant piece of trickery did occur, it would have been easy for ‘Ali and his supporters to refuse to accept any outcome of the arbitration. In any case, the arbitration does not appear to have had much importance for the further development of the Fitna, except insofar as ‘Ali had diminished his status as caliph by agreeing to take part in it. More important was the major split which occurred in the support for\n\n30\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\n‘Ali after the battle of Siffin. On the way back to Kufa, we are told, a large part of his army withdrew their allegiance to him and left his camp because they now repented of their appeal to him to stop the fighting and enter into discussions. They demanded that ‘Ali too should repent and withdraw from the arbitration. As a slogan signifying their opposition to the arbitration they adopted the formula, ‘arbitration (or judgement) belongs to God alone’ (la hukma illa li’llah), which is traditionally interpreted as a protest against the decision to appoint men (the two arbitrators) to decide what was fundamentally a religious matter and should therefore be left to God. These dissidents among the supporters of ‘Ali came to be known as ‘Kharijites’ (‘those who went out’ or ‘rebels’) and the slogan remained a badge of the movement long after the Fitna was over. For the Kharijites the immediate enemy now became ‘Ali, who had to be fought until he repented of his decision to accept the arbitration. This ‘Ali could not do, and from Siffin onwards he had to devote more time to his struggle against the Kharijites and less to that with Mu‘awiya. He achieved a major victory over the Kharijites at the battle of Nahrawan in Iraq (658), but this, by providing the movement with martyrs, merely intensified the hatred against him. After Siffin, therefore, we see a steady erosion of ‘Ali’s position: he seemed to have given grounds for the questioning of his legitimacy by agreeing to the arbitration, and the Kharijite secession threatened him on another front. At the same time the stock of Mu‘awiya rose. He had come to be seen as at least an equal of ‘Ali, and was able to rely on the support of his Syrian Arabs. With the collapse of ‘Ali’s position, we hear that the Syrians now gave their allegiance (bay‘a) to Mu‘awiya as caliph. The chronology again is not clear, but it seems to have been in 659 or 660. After this the Fitna came to a dramatic end. In 661 ‘Ali was murdered in Kufa, reportedly by a Kharijite seeking revenge for the massacre at Nahrawan, and Mu‘awiya took advantage of the situation to march into Kufa where he was able, by a combination of tact, money and the threat of force, to win the acceptance of most of ‘Ali’s remaining supporters. In the eyes of some of ‘Ali’s supporters the successor to ‘Ali should have been his eldest son, Hasan, but Mu‘awiya, it is generally accepted, persuaded Hasan to retract his claim to the imamate and to withdraw into private life in the Hijaz where he died some years later.11 Naturally, acceptance of Mu‘awiya as caliph was not unanimous. He was still opposed by the Kharijites and not all of ‘Ali’s former\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\n31\n\nsupporters accepted him, but they were no longer able to carry out a consistent armed struggle against him. The remnants of ‘Ali’s party formed the basis of what was to become known as the Shi‘a (the ‘Party’ of ‘Ali), supporting the claims of ‘Ali and his descendants to the imamate and developing into a number of sub-groups as their religious and political ideas became more elaborate. Eventually they posed a greater threat to Umayyad rule than did the Kharijites and were to play a major role in the movement which finally ended the Umayyad caliphate. This, though, was in the future. For the time being, 661 saw the end of the Fitna, the reunification of the divided Muslim community, and general recognition of Mu‘awiya as caliph. With hindsight it was seen as the beginning of the Umayyad dynasty. If we accept the data provided by Muslim tradition, then, the Umayyads, leading representatives of those who had opposed the Prophet until the latest possible moment, had within thirty years of his death reestablished their position to the extent that they were now at the head of the community which he had founded. As a result the Fitna has often been interpreted as the climax of a struggle for power within Islam between that class of Meccans typified by the Umayyads, the wealthy and powerful leaders of pre-Islamic Mecca, and those, largely from a lower social stratum, whose acceptance of Islam was more wholehearted. To use expressions frequently applied, it was the result of a struggle between the old and the new aristocracy. Within this interpretation some have taken a more strongly antiUmayyad line and argued that the civil war was consciously engineered by the old aristocracy in order to regain the position it had lost with the triumph of Islam. In this view Mu‘awiya plays an active role by delaying answering the appeals of the caliph ‘Uthman for help when he was faced with the rebellious Egyptian soldiers in Medina, arousing the Syrians by holding an exhibition in the mosque of Damascus of the dead ‘Uthman’s bloody shirt or severed finger, and even plotting with his relative, the keeper of ‘Uthman’s seal, to ensure that any possible compromise between ‘Uthman and the Egyptian rebels would break down. The aim of all this was to ensure that ‘Ali, whose succession to ‘Uthman was seen as inevitable in any case, would succeed to the caliphate in circumstances which would cast doubt on his legitimacy and enable the old aristocracy to turn the situation to their own advantage. Others have taken a more moderate line and seen the emergence of the old aristocracy as the new leaders of Islam as an unconscious and almost inevitable process since they\n\n32\n\nThe Umayyad Rise to the Caliphate\n\nwere the only ones with the background and skills necessary to govern and hold together the new state made possible by the Arab conquest of the Middle East. In this view Mu‘awiya is the symbol of everything that the supporters of the old aristocracy wanted—a strong central government which would keep in check the unruly bedouin who had been vital for the expansion of Islam but who now threatened its survival as a unity. As the long-serving governor of a province with a tradition of ordered government dating from the Byzantine period, Mu‘awiya, it is argued, was the obvious candidate of those members of the old aristocracy, whose wealth depended on trade and therefore stability, and who feared the anarchistic tendencies of the bedouin. On the other hand, ‘Ali, although himself a Qurashi Meccan, had come to power on the shoulders of the discontented tribesmen and his whole campaign was bedevilled by his inability to impose discipline on his men.12 It may be that such interpretations accept too readily the data of Muslim tradition with its strong anti-Umayyad stance, but it nevertheless seems likely that Mu‘awiya’s success did owe much to the relative stability of his Syrian base and the support of the Syrian Arabs on whom he relied. Equally it appears that discontent among the tribesmen of the garrison towns had much to do with the outbreak of the Fitna and that ‘Ali’s reliance on this element was a major cause of his failure in the struggle with Mu‘awiya. To this extent the interpretation of the Fitna as a conflict between the nomads and the developing state, between the demands of primitive democracy and those of ordered stability, is attractive. In itself, though, Mu‘awiya’s victory did not solve the problems which had led to the Fitna, and he was now faced with ruling an empire which perhaps accepted him for lack of alternatives rather than out of conviction.\n\nNotes 1.

The Umayyad family was, indeed, very extensive and was made up of several branches often hostile to each other and competing for wealth and prestige. With the death of the Mu‘awiya’s grandson, the caliph Mu‘awiya II, in 684, the Sufyanids were to provide no further caliphs and, as a result of the civil war which erupted even before the death of Mu‘awiya II, they were supplanted in the caliphate by the Marwanid line of Umayyads descended from Marwan b. alHakam. 1 After the Umayyad dynasty had been overthrown and the ‘Abbasids took over the caliphate in 750, the Sufyanid branch again achieved some prominence for a time. During the first century or so of ‘Abbasid rule a number of political and religious movements developed in Syria which had a strong messianic character and looked for the coming of a figure who would overthrow the ‘Abbasids and reestablish Syrian glory. This figure was known as the Sufyani and was expected to be descended from the line which had produced the great Mu‘awiya. It is as if the Sufyanid period of Umayyad history had come to be regarded as of special significance and something like a Golden Age for Syria. 2\n\nOrganisation and Administration of the Caliphate3 From the point of view of its rulers, the major division among the peoples of the territory over which Mu‘awiya had established his rule was that between the Arabs and the conquered peoples.
