Note, it is probably impossible to get a good estimate due to a range of reasons (plagues, extent of borders, lack of data available).\n\nThe worlds population in 700 CE was estimated to be between 207 Million and 220 Million. In 800 CE, the worlds population was estimated to be somewhere between 220 Million and 240 Million."
