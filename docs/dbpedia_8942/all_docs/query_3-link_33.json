        "text": "While not much of ancient Harran survives, its atmosphere remains imbued with a sense of magic and mystery. The Mesopotamian city was a former dwelling place of Abraham and home to Anatolia’s first mosque. And it was long a center of stellar worship, remaining one of the ancient world’s last pagan strongholds. In this Harran guide, we’ll be covering the city’s fascinating history and prominent landmarks, including its iconic Beehive Houses.\n\nHarran was inhabited as early as the Chalcolithic age but first grew to prominence in the 3rd millennium BC as part of the Assyrian Empire. Due to its position on important trading routes, it quickly became a major commercial center.\n\nAnd for thousands of years, Harran was synonymous with the worship of Sin, the Mesopotamian moon good. Sadly, nearly all was lost following the Mongol invasion of 1251, but Harran’s numerous legends live on.\n\nAs an easy day trip from Urfa (learn how below), visiting Harran is essential for those touring southeast Turkey.\n\nYears later, around 556 BC, Nabonidus took control by usurping the throne. And he wasn’t even native to Babylon, but came from Harran. Accordingly, during his reign, he shifted focus away from the Babylonian patron deity of Marduk and toward the moon god Sin.\n\nIn the three identical inscriptions on display at the Şanlıurfa Museum, Nabonidus writes that though he wasn’t born of royal blood, the gods decreed that he was destined to rule.\n\nHe also claims that Mesopotamians at the time had forgotten their traditions and shunned the gods, resulting in a society rife with lies and cruelty. This caused him to depart Babylon during his reign, traveling between outlying cities for years.\n\nHistorical records indicate that he spent 10 years in the city of Tayma (current Saudi Arabia) while still holding the title of king. And later, he’d visit his hometown of Harran to establish a Sin temple there. In his stela, Nabonidus writes that Sin commanded him to do so in a dream.\n\nThe first Sin temple in Harran was established as early as the 23rd century BC by King Narram-Sin, ruler of the Akkadian Empire. It was already ruined by Nabonidus’s time, and he needed to search long and hard for it.\n\nBut once he found it, he excavated and restored the temple. Amazingly, Nabonidus is widely regarded as the world’s first archaeologist!\n\nEventually, though, Nabonidus would return to Babylon in 543 (his son had been ruling as prince). And only several years later, Cyrus the Great of the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered the city, ending the Neo-Babylonian Empire for good. Despite being an outside invader, Cyrus garnered much local support by restoring the prominence of Marduk.\n\nBut over in Harran, the cult of Sin would thrive for centuries. And its unique religious community would come to be known as the Sabians.\n\nHarran was long inhabited by the Sabians, a group who merged Neo-Platonic philosophy with Babylonian star worship.\n\nThough they assigned a divinity to each planet, their primary god was Sin, the moon god. The god was first known as Nanna, but it was eventually synchronized with the Semitic moon god of Sin during the Akkadian Empire era.\n\nThe Sabians were known to have always faced north during their sacred rites. Could it be a coincidence that the circular enclosures of Göbekli Tepe, just 40 km away, were also oriented north?\n\nGöbekli Tepe, built at least 12,000 years ago, consisted of multiple T-shaped pillars. And the Sabians of Harran also prayed to their deities in the form of stone pillars. Some sort of connection, therefore, seems highly probable.\n\nThe Sabians prayed in the morning, midday and at sunset. And aside from Sin, their pantheon included other Mesopotamian deities like Shamash and Ishtar, Sin’s mythological children.\n\nThe traditions of Harran proved to be incredibly resilient. When Christian Rome sought to ban all practice of ‘paganism’ throughout its empire, the Sabians continued to thrive.\n\nAround this time, it’s speculated that the priesthood of Egypt fled to Harran for refuge, bringing the entire library of Egyptian texts with them. The compilation of and intermingling with other sacred teachings (like those of the Iranian Magi) supposedly gave birth to Western Hermeticism.\n\nThe origin of the Sabians’ name is a mystery, as they’re mentioned in the Quran as a ‘People of the Book.’ But clearly they were not.\n\nAccording to legend, in the 9th century, the Abassid caliph Al-Mamun threatened the moon worshippers with death if they didn’t convert to monotheism.\n\nIn fear for their lives, they consulted the Quran and found the reference to the Sabians, claiming the title for themselves. If the tale is indeed true, the real identity of the Quran’s Sabians remains an unsolved mystery.\n\nHarran’s Sabians continued to thrive throughout the Islamic era, though many of their structures would be replaced with Islamic ones. At a time when astrology played a major role in Islam, the Sabians were highly respected by the Abassids for their knowledge of the stars and planetary cycles.\n\nInfluential Islamic scientists and astrologers would study in Harran, and some even speculate that Islam’s star and crescent symbol has Sabian roots.\n\nIn the 10th century, however, a Muslim uprising destroyed the original Sin temple. And, as legend has it, following Harran’s 13th-century destruction, those with the ancient knowledge fled west into Europe, giving birth to the various Occidental mystery schools.\n\nThe spread of this knowledge – at least in underground circles – would then set the foundation for the Italian Renaissance.\n\nDuring your walk around the castle, don’t be surprised to get pestered by local children asking for money. The ones here were relentless, following me around for a good fifteen minutes!\n\nFinished with the castle, I walked around the outside of the Citadel Mound rather than through it. In many areas, parts of the original wall remain partially intact.\n\nThough I’d been considering heading back to Urfa at this point, I realized I was still doing good on time. And so I decided to make a big detour over to the northwest to check out one more ancient landmark.\n\nIn an area about 1.5 km north of the Aleppo Gate is a well which appears in a famous Biblical story involving Jacob.\n\nIn the Book of Genesis, Jacob was the grandson of Abraham and the son of Isaac and Rebecca. And Harran is also where Rebecca’s brother Laban lived.\n\nRebecca sent Jacob to her hometown after learning of his brother Esau’s intentions to murder him. Jacob had deceived their blind father Isaac and received the birthright blessing, despite Esau being the firstborn.\n\nUpon arrival in Harran, Jacob stopped at a well, where he laid eyes on the beautiful Rachel – also his first cousin. He then asked his uncle for Rachel’s hand in marriage in exchange for seven years of labor.\n\nBut Jacob was tricked when Laban replaced Rachel with her less attractive older sister, Leah. Jacob then had to toil another seven years in exchange for Rachel’s hand in marriage.\n\nJacob remained in Harran for quite some time, fathering more than a dozen children there (i.e. the Twelve Tribes of Israel).\n\nHaving made the long walk over, I was disappointed to find the entire area locked. I was, at least, able to get a fairly good view from outside the fence.\n\nAnd as I walked around to get the best vantage point, I saw a man across the street waving at me, signaling for me to come over.\n\nI thought he might have the key, but this was not the case. It was simply a hospitable and friendly local who wanted to get to know a foreign visitor.\n\nThe house was next to a lumber yard, where I met several brothers along with their father. They were all taking a break at the time, chatting while drinking some Coke.\n\nIt was still hot out and I graciously accepted a glass. With the help of Google Translate, we went over the basic subjects like my marital status, job and what I’m doing in Turkey. But then they asked me about the well.\n\nI told them I just tried to go and it’s locked. But no, they weren’t talking about Jacob’s Well, but another well nearby with great treasures inside.\n\nThe problem was, they explained, the treasures were being guarded by a djinn (a genie in Islamic mythology). ‘Do you know any priests?’ they asked me. ‘Or anyone who can remove the djinn?’\n\nThe conversation had been lighthearted up to that point, but now they seemed serious. ‘Sorry, but I just got here and I don’t know any priests,’ I explained.\n\n‘What about someone who knows magical spells?’ they asked me again. I told them I wouldn’t be able to help, and the conversation returned to normal from that point on. But it was quite the interesting – and oddly fitting – end to the day in a town like Harran."
