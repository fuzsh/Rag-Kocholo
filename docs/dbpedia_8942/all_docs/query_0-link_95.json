        "text": "Marwān II (born c. 684—died 750, Egypt) was the last of the Umayyad caliphs (reigned 744–750). He was killed while fleeing the forces of Abū al-ʿAbbās as-Saffāḥ, the first caliph of the ʿAbbāsid dynasty.\n\nThe grandson of Marwān I, Marwān II was governor of Armenia and other territories for 12 years, gaining military experience which later led him to reorganize the Islāmic army. In place of a clumsy system of divisions based on tribal loyalties, Marwān II created smaller, more mobile divisions of paid troops under professional commanders. Ascending to the throne in 744, he completed the reconquest of Syria by 746. However, the ʿAbbāsid rebellion broke out in 747, and a combined force of ʿAbbāsids, Persians, Iraqis, and Shīʿites decisively defeated the Umayyad army at the Battle of the Great Zab River in 750. The subsequent death of Marwān II marked the end of the Umayyad dynasty."
