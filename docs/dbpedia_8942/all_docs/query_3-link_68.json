        "text": "Back then, the lines between different religions were blurry. Early Christians were actually Jewish people who followed Jesus, so figuring out who exactly was considered a “Jew” became tricky. So, how exactly a Jew to be defined? Of course to answer such theological questions the rabbis of Mesopotamia established the great Yeshivas of Sura and Pumpedita during the period of Ardashir. They launched on the great project of research that would conclude in their compilation of the Talmud.\n\nDifferent people had different ideas. The Jewish synagogues were places of communal gathering where the Torah was studied and debated, and where Jewishness — loudaismos, in Greek — was rarely given (“Judaism,” in the sense that it is used in modern English, was a Christian invention). Different communities and individuals had varying definitions of Jewishness, making it a subjective concept. It seemed that being a Jew was more about personal claim than a concrete definition. Consequently, the dividing line between Jews and non-Jews, or “Gentiles,” remained fluid. Some people claimed that proselytes were fully Jewish. Others claimed they were “as harmful as sores.” The rabbis, unable to reach a consensus on who qualified as a Jew, accepted their differences and agreed to disagree, with debates ranging from the acceptance of proselytes to their rejection.\n\n3. The Church has four gospels, but the heretics have many\n\nBy the time the Mesopotamian Yeshivas were established in the early third century C.E, there had already emerged a formidable stronghold of Christian sages — and one that bore little resemblance to the rabbinical institutions of Sura and Pumpedita.“Edessa” famed among Christians everywhere as the “Blessed City”. The church has made the city a true centre of Christian scholarship. The hymns, prayers, and translations written there would help Syriac, the language of the Edessans, become the lingua franca of the whole Christian Near East or on the Arabian peninsula.\n\nChristians in Edessa in North-West Mesopotamia, continued to refuse to consume meat that had not been drained of all its blood, as mandated by the Torah. They celebrated Christ’s resurrection on a date determined by a Jewish method of computation. Even the term they used to call their priests, rabban, sounded similar to and had the same meaning as rabbi. The earliest translation of the Old Testament into Syriac was most likely done not by Christians, but by Jews who later converted and donated their work to the Church. It was not always clear to many Jews that accepting Jesus as the Messiah required them to abandon their Jewish identity. Similarly, among the ranks of Christians, there were those who insisted on keeping the Torah and saw Paul as “a renegade from the Law” — the heretic of heretics. Some found no conflict in balancing their bets even further by invoking both the ‘One God of the Jews’ and the ‘Trinity of the Christians’ at the same time.\n\nThroughout the early 320s, Emperor Constantine was busy crushing the last remnants of opposition to his rule and drawing up plans for his new capital. In 318 C.E Christian theologian, by the name Arias, who taught that the Son of God was not eternal, and was subordinate to God the Father. He denied the validity of the Christian Trinity. His sect then became known as Arianism. Although he attracted considerable support at the time (and since), Arius’s views were voted into heresy at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, (so too were a host of other Christian sects and factions) leading to the formation of the Nicene Creed.\n\nThen, a hundred years later, in 451 C.E, the Church’s biggest ecumenical council, attended by a full 600 bishops, was held at Chalcedon. This time, it aimed to settle more disagreements and strengthen church unity by defining the empire’s standard version of Christianity. Across the empire’s eastern provinces, particularly in Syria and Egypt, Christians who believed that Christ’s human nature had been inseparably mixed with the divine refused to be bound by the council’s judgements. The Chalcedonian council scornfully labelled them as “Monophysites,” a name meant deeply insulting. The heretic Monophysitism asserted that the person of Jesus Christ has only one, divine nature rather than the two natures, divine and human. Similarly, another group called Nestorians, follower of the teaching of Nestorius, arose as a result of the ecumenical councils of Ephesus (431 CE) and Chalcedon’s rejection of Nestorius and his ideas (451 CE). When supporters of Nestorius gathered at the theological school of Edessa, it was closed by Rome’s imperial order in 489, and a minority of Nestorian Christians migrated to Persia. The Persian Church’s intellectual centre then became the new school in Nisibis, which carried on the venerable traditions of Edessa. And this is how Nestorianism became the official church doctrine in Sassanian Iran.\n\nDuring the time when the Babylonian Talmud was being put together, a similar process was happening in Palestine. The development of Jewish law in Syria Palaestina was one of the focuses of the Talmudic Academies. The Palestinian Talmud is a compilation of rabbinic notes from the second century Jewish oral tradition known as the Mishnah, which serves as the foundation for Islamic isnads. The Jews were viewed as a challenge and an embarrassment by Christian authorities in the Holy Land. So, they were forbidden to join the army; to serve in the bureaucracy; to buy Christian slaves. Synagogues, although protected by law from being burned down or converted into churches, were permitted only to be renovated, and on no account to be built from scratch. By the sixth century, the Jewish population in Palestine was likely a small fraction, around 10 percent, of the overall population.\n\nInterestingly, the religious landscape was not simply divided between Christians and Jews in Palestine during this period. In the central part of the province, there was a group known as ‘Samaritans.’ These individuals publicly criticized both Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, considering them places of ‘idolatry.’ They lived in Samaria, a location halfway between Jerusalem and Galilee, believed to have retained the plain wishes of heaven. “There is only One God,” they asserted. “Let us trust Him and Moses, His Prophet.” Their faith, known as Samaritanism, centered around the Samaritan Pentateuch, which they believed to be the original and unaltered version of the Torah given to Moses on Mount Sinai. To them, it was not in Temple Mount nor the rock of Golgotha that Noah’s ark had landed, Abraham had prepared to sacrifice Isaac, and the laws given to Moses had been preserved, but in Samaria — Mount Gerizim.\n\nThe early “Samaritans” were a half-pagan Jewish sect who were said to worshipped a dove. The Samaritans intermarried with the pagans. And they believed that Mount Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the one true sanctuary chosen by God.\n\nThe rabbis had accused the Samaritans themselves of being the idolators — this on the supposed grounds that they were descended from pagans and worshipped a dove. As a result, far from embracing them as potential allies, most Jews refused even to sit down with them, let alone consume their wine or food. The similarities between Samaritans and Jews were such that the rabbis found it impossible to draw a clear distinction between the two groups. Unlike Jews, Samaritans were permitted to serve in the Roman army. However, the Roman emperor Zeno (who reigned from 474 to 491 CE) tortured and executed many Samaritans, replacing their synagogues with churches on Mount Gerizim. Later, in 484 CE, the Samaritans revolted. The rebels burned five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cut the finger of bishop Terebinthus, who was officiating at the ceremony of Pentecost. The Roman authorities then suppressed these riots, many Samaritans were forcefully converted to Christianity.\n\nThen again, under a charismatic, a mysterious prophet named Julianus ben Sabar (or ben Sahir), the Samaritans launched a war to create their own independent state in 529. But emperor Justinian I crushed the revolt; tens of thousands of Samaritans killed or were enslaved, it was specifically decreed that they must be sold as far afield as possible — preferably in Persia or India. The prospect that any of them might grow up within striking distance of their homeland was altogether too alarming to be tolerated. The Christian Byzantine Empire effectively prohibited the Samaritan faith, which had previously enjoyed the status of religio licita; from a population of at least hundreds of thousands, the Samaritan community plummeted to tens of thousands.\n\nMany Samaritans fled the empire, out into the wilderness of the desert beyond Palestine. The Samaritans were far from the first refugees to seek refuge outside the borders of the Promised Land. Other Jewish-Christian sects had done the same thing during their long persecution at the hands of Rome. The ebionites, Marionites, Nazoreans, Arians, Monophysites, Nestorians and many others. The monasteries that mark Palestine’s eastern border were meant to stand as bulwarks of the Holy land. Cyril, a Christian Bishop in Jerusalem urged “Be prepared to defend yourself against heretics, Jews, Samaritans, and pagans.” Cyril had advised his followers that “If a book is not read in a church, then do not read it yourself, even alone”. Indeed, a cautioned against fake scriptures that “had the title of ‘gospels,’ but were false and full of deception. Cyril well knew that, nowhere else in the world were banned gospels, banned doctrines, and banned identities more likely to be available than in Palestine and its borders.\n\nMoreover, immigrants were not the only heretics to be found in Palestine. Camped out on the frontier between Christianity and Judaism, on what had become, since the Council of Nicaea, there were the Gnostics. It was no wonder that bishops such as Cyril regarded the melting-pot of faiths to be found in Palestine as so potentially toxic. The possibility of heresy in the Holy Land appeared as scary to scholars of his day as it had always been. After all, if a Jew could be a Christian — and a Christian a Jew — then who was to say what further horrible fusions of beliefs might be possible?\n\nA Bishop named Epiphanius of Salamis, in Cyprus, had described a group known as the Nazoreans, an early “Jewish Christian sect”. The Nazarenes were similar to the Ebionites, in that they considered themselves Jews, maintained an adherence to the Law of Moses. They rejected all the canonical gospels and used only the Aramaic Gospel of the Nazarenes. Unlike the Ebionites, they accepted the Virgin Birth. They considered Jesus as a prophet and denied the Trinity and performed daily prayers facing Jerusalem. The bishop then pointed to a teacher named Ebion, who, according to Epiphanius, had combined Judaism with “the repulsiveness of the Samaritans,” as well as a number of other heresies. Indeed, a world in which nothing could stop some daring and innovative heretics from stealing a piece of preaching from every group and fashioning themselves after them all. It’s no surprise, then, that bishops like Cyril and Epiphanius worked long and hard to impose an orthodox vision of Christianity on the Holy Land. If the Ebionites and others did survive within the Christian empire, it had to be on the outskirts: either on the Golan Heights above Galilee, or in outposts deep in the desert beyond Syria-palestina.\n\n4. Children of Abraham — Tracing the Arabs Monotheistic Pagan roots\n\nSome 30 kilometres south of Jerusalem, there was a place called ‘Mamre’ where an oak tree stood. Every summer, people from beyond the borders of Syria-Palestine, who followed pagan beliefs, would gather there for a festive celebration. The name ‘Mamre’ is mentioned in the Bible in the context of Abraham and the three visitors. The three mysterious strangers who had brought him the happy news that his wife, Sarah, was expecting a son. While two of them left, the third, revealing Himself as God, informed Abraham about the intention to destroy Sodom. The oak of Mamre is the name given to the tree under which he was believed to had pitched his tent.\n\nChristians claimed that Mamre was a place of original holiness dedicated to worshiping their Savior. They asserted that the three strangers Abraham encountered, could only be the Trinity. As a result, all pagan claims to the location, in Emperor Constantine’s stern opinion, were blasphemous and fraudulent. To counter any pagan claims, Constantine built a Christian basilica there, attempting to put an end to the pagan practices happening there. But the pagans, however, had continued to visit Mamre. More than a century after Constantine tried to outlaw their summer festival, where they would sacrifice cockerels, pour wine and cakes into Abraham’s well, and abstain from sex, the pagans were still gathering around the sacred tree.\n\nThe majority of festival goers came from outside the borders of Palestine. Who were they? Of course, they were the Arabs. It was reported that the Arab’s major shrine, which was surrounded by palm trees some place in the desert south of Palestine, and where the locals were said to meet twice a year for a month or more at a period. At Al-Hirah, for example, there were two stones dedicated to a god named Dushara, which his worshippers would frequently smear with gore. A second deity, al-’Uzza — the “Mighty Queen,” received an even more dramatic flow of blood when Lakhmid king Mundhir sacrificed 400 Christian nuns in her honour in 527 C.E.\n\nWhen Bishop Epiphanius, the same cataloguer of heresies who had condemned the Ebionites, turned his eye on Dushara, he reported that the worshippers of Dushara believed the deity was born of a virgin — a ka’iba — in a blasphemous imitation of Christian doctrine. The bishop, however, had misheard: Dushara was a deity of a ka’ba — a “cube,” not a ka’iba. The reference was to a black and uncarved stone that the Nabataeans worshipped as an embodiment of the deity, located in a shrine near Petra, today’s Jordon. Churches had grown crowded in Nabataean cities, and even in the desert’s wilds, whole tribes had turned to Christ. There was frequently a degree of opportunism in this, because it was widely known that the Romans would only ever give favour upon Arabs who were fellow Christians.\n\nThe arabs were then known as Hagerens or Ishmaelites or Saracens by Christian writers because they were already mentioned in the Bible. In the biblical myth, Abrahams concubine Hagar was pushed out into the desert with infant Ishameal by his angry wife Sarah. The exact location of this desert has been much debated, with some academics, recognising it as Sinai(It’s still a location in the Myth not real in real sense). However, the overwhelming consensus is that it could only have been the Negev. No other area was closer to important places associated with Abraham, like Mamre, the Church of Saint Lot, and Hebron, where Abraham was believed to be buried with Isaac and Jacob in a cave. So, the early Christian and Jewish writers concluded that the Arabs were descendants of Ishmael through Hagar based on this biblical tale.\n\nNote that, It was not Arabs who first claimed to be descendants of Ishmael; it was Jews and Christians who began referring to them as descendants of Ishmael, which gradually influenced Arab’s consciousness.\n\nIn the 5th century, a Christian priest named Theodoret, who spoke Greek and lived in Syria, wrote about people in the desert who were proud of their Ishmaelite ancestry. He wrote: “For there are individuals in the desert who are proud to trace their ancestry back to Ishmael”. After all, Ishmael’s mother, Hagar was hardly the best of ancestors. She had been a slave-girl and pushed out into exile not once, but twice. Because of this, a new term, Saracens, became associated with the Arabs.\n\nBishop Theodoret had come to the conclusion that the Saracens; he had seen huge numbers of them gathered before the pillar of Saint ‘Simeon the Elder,’ a Syrian stylite and he had seen the impact. The reason for Theodoret’s keen interest in the Saracens was that they were the only barbarians mentioned in the Bible.\n\nSozomen (400–450 CE), a contemporary of Theodoret’s, offers a particularly creative theory for the derivation of the word “Saracen.” “Shocked by Hagar’s slave attitude,” he added, “the Ishmaelites chose to conceal the condemnation of their origin by choosing a name that would indicate that they were derived instead from Sarah, Abraham’s wife.” Thus, the word “Saracens” in his view, to be derived from Sarah. Sozomen was an experienced observer of the region, who came from near Gaza, between the Mediterranean and the Negev. He had been to Mamre, for example, and seen the crowds who gathered there. He was well aware that people, not just Christians but also Jews and pagans, worshipped Abraham. Unlike Theodoret, this led Sozomen to wonder: What if the Saracen’s knowledge of their ancestors didn’t always bring them to Christ? What if it took them in an entirely different direction?\n\n“After all, their origin being what it is, they practise circumcision like the Jews, refrain from the use of pork like the Jews, and observe many other Jewish rites and customs. That they deviate at all from the Laws of the Jewish people can only be ascribed to the lapse of time, and to the influence upon them of other, pagan people” — Sozomen\n\nIf the Arabs are cleansed of their paganism, what emerges from them may not be a Christian people at all, but an entire tribe of Jews. Indeed, this had already occurred, according to Sozomen: “There are those among them who, by coming into touch with Jews, learn the truth of their origins, and therefore revert to the ways of their kinsmen, and are convinced to accept Jewish traditions and regulations.” Sozomen had no clue who these Jews were, but it’s clear that beyond the control of the Roman Empire, Arabs had more than just Christianity to consider for their religious beliefs. In areas beyond Palestine, where direct Roman rule didn’t extend, heresies (unpopular religious beliefs) that were thought to have disappeared within the empire’s borders were found to survive and even flourish.\n\nFor example, in the forests beyond the borders of Danube and the Rhine in the northern regions of Rome, a bishop named Ulfilas, with heretical Arian views (Arianism being a heretical Christian sect), worked to convert his fellow Goths (Gothic tribesmen). If the stories about him were true, he achieved significant success. Within a century of his death, he was celebrated as the Moses of the northern barbarians. Like the Children of Israel, these people believed they were chosen by God to receive a promised land. Consequently, when the group calling themselves the ‘Good’ or ‘Visi’ Goths won Spain, they resisted converting to Catholicism. Instead, they held onto their ‘Arianism,’ a heretical belief, rather than adopting Catholic orthodoxy.\n\n5. The Fall of Western Rome\n\nThe Roman Empire was divided into East and West. After unifying the empire, Constantine established Nova Roma (“New Rome”) — later named Constantinople — in modern-day Turkey, making it the capital. The challenge for Roman Emperors right from the heyday of the empire was to control the frontiers, especially in the western regions along the Danube and Rhine. Conquering the lands beyond these regions was considered not worth the effort. So, what the Romans did was to establish garrisons in the frontiers, but it was much easier to pay bribes to employ the natives beyond the borders as mercenaries, Or as vassal kingdoms.\n\nOver time, these previously scattered tribal entities started merging, becoming wealthier, and adopting Roman military techniques. When the Roman Empire descended into civil war in the fifth century, these tribal communities had become sufficiently Romanized and effective in combat against civic forces, that they were able to cross the borders and took control of former Roman provinces. The sociopolitical climate was turbulent, and the Roman Empire’s status was far from favorable due to prolonged infighting among emperors. In the 5th century, both the Visigoths and the Vandals sacked Rome. This, combined with the migration of Germanic tribes in the 4th century, ultimately led to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 A.D. We can conclude that the same process will eventually happen in the East.\n\n6. Countdown to Apocalypse.\n\nThe Arab deserts had unexpectedly become the border of not one, but two superpowers, Rome and Persia. Positioned on a world’s most dangerous geopolitical fault-line, both empires were in urgent need of swords, and the Arabs found themselves in a prime position to offer their services to the highest bidder. For the Romans, hiring barbarians as mercenaries wasn’t a new concept since they had previously done it before in the western region of the Empire, employing tribes as confederates: as “foederati”.\n\nEven before the Persian threat emerged, in the second century CE, the Romans successfully bought and bribed a number of tribes into serving as a desert police force, and the example of this confederation, the “Thamud”, was remembered by Arab poets for a long time. Perhaps understandably so: what it had demonstrated was that even the most proud and fractious desert tribes could, under certain conditions, be formed into a shirkat — a “partnership.”\n\nAlthough the Thamud confederation had long before disintegrated, having been struck down by a thunderbolt, according to an Arab legend, new foederati had quickly formed to take its place. It is telling that, beginning in the fourth century, Roman authors began to employ a new name to describe Arabs, one that appears to have eventually originated from shirkat: “Saracens.” Although the Romans appear to have been completely unaware of the previous meaning, and their stereotype of the “Saracens” remained the reassuringly conventional one of nomads, bandits, and savages, using this new name showed they recognized the growing power of these desert kingdoms.\n\nOn the Persian side, they hired another tribe called the Banu Lakhm, known as “Lakhm’s Sons,” establishing the Lakhmid Kingdom. These guys were like the Rome’s partners, but for Persia and had been mercenaries for a long time, working for the Persian king. Their capital stood at Hira, South of Mesopotamia. It was like a giant army camp (the name Al-Hira itself means “the camp”), always ready to fight. Their job was to keep the other Arab tribes in line and stop them from causing trouble for Persia. When a war broke out with Rome in 502 C.E, the Persian king Kavad appointed the capable chieftain Mundhir as the ruler over all the scattered Arab tribes confederated to Persia.\n\nMeanwhile, Rome’s Arab partners, the Ghassanids, set up their own kingdom in Jabiyah, east of the Golan Heights. These two Arab kingdoms, the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids, were basically enemies, always fighting each other on behalf of their bigger empires.\n\nIn the year 541 C.E., a devastating plague broke out in eastern Byzantine Rome, wreaking havoc. It began in Egypt in 536 C.E and spread rapidly to the east and west. The impact was particularly severe on the Romans, because cities are significantly more prone to the spread of disease than in deserts. A Roman commander observed this and noted the consequences as follows: “While the empire’s once countless military units, have dwindled in number; the plague, that ally of war, has not so much touched the rancorous tribes of the desert,”. So there is almost for the first time a sense that there is a balance of power between the nomads of the desert and the armed forces governing the fertile crescent settlements.\n\nBefore the plague emerged in 536, an unusual dust cloud had shrouded the region in darkness for months, affecting Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia continuously for 18 months. Research now reveals that a volcanic eruption in Iceland was the cause, with two more massive eruptions following in 540 and 547. These events, combined with the plague, plunged Europe into economic stagnation until 640. Then, in December 557, a massive earthquake shook the Roman capital, Constantinople, and even ruined the dome of the famous church, Hagia Sophia —r equiring years of repairs.\n\nAround the same time, starting in the 540s, groups of nomadic steppe farmers called Slavs started invading into Roman lands from the north. Then, another group of tough warriors called Avars came from the east and demanded danger money from the Romans. But maybe the worst thing was that a tribe called the Lombards invaded Italy in 568. With the world becoming more Christian and these “barbarians” attacking everywhere, people started to worry that the world was ending. They thought maybe God was angry with them.\n\nThen, around easter in the year 600 C.E., the plague returned to Galilee, spreading aggressively across the Golan Heights and the desert wasteland near Palestine. This was bad news for a group of desert people called the Ghassanids, who lived in big tents in Jabiya and couldn’t escape the sickness. Before, the desert had kept them safe from the plague, but this time it caught up with them.\n\n7. End of the Arab Federations\n\nThe Ghassanid Arabs were followers of Miaphysitism(derived from earlier Monophysitism), a version of Christianity considered heretical by the Byzantines. This led the Byzantines to break up the Ghassanid federation in 586, splitting it into smaller chiefdoms. The Ghassanids’ support for the Miaphysite Syrian Church was crucial for the church’s survival, revival, and its expansion into Arabia through missionary efforts. Historian Warwick Ball suggests that the Ghassanids’ promotion of a simpler, more strictly monotheistic Christianity in an Arab context foreshadowed the rise of Islam.\n\nOn the other hand, the Lakhmids remained influential in the sixth century. However, in 602, the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II executed the last Lakhmid king, al-Nu’man III ibn al-Mundhir, due to false suspicions of treason, leading to the annexation of the Lakhmid kingdom. By 602, both the Ghassanid and Lakhmid Arab federations came to an end.\n\n8. Byzantine-Sassanian war (602–628)\n\nIn the early seventh century, the ancient world’s equivalent of the black death was followed by the ancient world’s equivalent of World War I. A devastating war erupted between Rome and Persia, known as the cold war of 602 CE. The leaders during this war were Khosrow II for the Sasanians (Persian dynasty) and, on the Roman side, first Phocas and later Heraclius. For a long part of the war, from 602 to 622 CE, the Sassanians were winning, taking over significant territories from the Byzantines like Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, Asia Minor, and Egypt.\n\nDuring this time, the Sasanians captured Jerusalem, taking many Christian relics, including the most precious one in the Roman Empire — the cross believed to be where Jesus was crucified. This sacred item was taken as a trophy of war back to Iraq. However, in a remarkable military comeback, Heraclius, the Roman Emperor, defeated the Persians and brought the true cross back to Jerusalem.\n\nThe war finally ended when Heraclius invaded the core of the Persian empire. This move triggered a civil war among the Persians, leading to the overthrow of Khosrow. The rebels then sought peace, and Persian control in the East was significantly weakened.\n\nDuring the war between 602 and 622, the Persians occupied Egypt, Palestine, Syria and levant, taking control of what had been the Ghassanid and Lakhmid territories. However, in 622, the Romans pushed back the Persians, giving Arabs independence. It’s important to remember this year because it marks the beginning of the Islamic Hijra calendar.\n\n9. Hijra\n\nBy C.E 600, large populations of immigrants, known as Muhajirun in Arabic, had settled between Palestine and the Hijaz. In the traditional account, the Muhajirun’s were Muslims who migrated from Mecca to Medina with Prophet Mohammed, but this, not appears to be the case here; rather, the Muhajiruns were merely migrants who traveled north to settle in territories around the Syria-Palestine border to join as foederatis. It is fortunate, then, that the Qur’an is not fully free of historical constraints. We can be confident of one thing: its ultimate shape predates the collapse of the Thamud, the huge confederation of Arab tribes hired by the Romans and commemorated by the Prophet as an example of worldly greatness brought low.\n\n“When God gave you mastery over the earth, when you seized its plains to build your palaces, and carved dwellings from the mountains — until, as punishment for deviating from the path, they were despatched by a scream so horrible that it left them withering, like dried straw”\n\nThamud, an Arab mercenary confederation to Rome are mentioned twenty-three times in the Quran. If the Prophet’s name-checking of the Thamud suggests knowledge with the workings of Roman imperialism, it is dramatically reinforced by another verse — the only one in the whole Qur’an to mention a contemporary power. “The Romans have been defeated in a nearby land,” it is said, “and yet, after their defeat, they shall be victorious — in a few years.” — Quran — 30 (Surah Ar-Rum). Romans are the only one geopolitical power name checked in the Qur’an. It seems likely that this is a reference to the great war between the Romans and the Persians, and it appears to be most likely written after Khosrow II invaded Palestine and took the true cross as war booty back to Iraq.\n\nThe world Muhammad knew was diverse and riddled with fusion of beliefs. It was required for the “Believers” to remain vigilant. The vast number of peoples with varied religions who populated the region astounded and fascinated him. By this standard, as Muhammad himself appears to have been uncomfortably aware, there was nothing to distinguish a rabbi or a monk from a mu’min’: a “believer.” In the Quran, At times, the Torah and the Gospel are hailed as “Guidance to Mankind,” sent down from heaven, and people who uphold them are referred to as the Ahl al-Kitab — the “People of the Book.” but at other times, Christians are condemned for ascribing to trinity.\n\nSuch conflict was not new; it echoed Jewish and Christian arguments about the concept of the trinity and Jewishness in the early centuries of Christianity. Perhaps, had a Christian authored a book giving voice to Ebionites and Marionites in the years prior to the Council of Nicaea, it would have covered the same degrees of tolerance and hostility toward Jews as found in the Qur’an. When deciding where to draw the line between his own teachings and those of the “People of the Book,” Muhammad was dealing with an issue that was many centuries older than himself. In his need to define the problematic border zone that divided the Believers from the Jews and Christians, Muhammad was fully capable of doing so in a manner that any devout Caesar (Roman emperor) would have recognised. Just as Roman Emperor Justinian I imposed severe financial penalties on “all those who do not rightly worship God,” the Qur’an mandated that Jews and Christians pay a specific tax, the jizya — and in such a manner that their inferiority was clear to all.\n\nIn the Qur’an Christians are most frequently referred with the word “Nasara”. The name would have meant almost little to the vast majority of Christians in the seventh century. Only the learned — perhaps scholars familiar with the works of Jerome and bishop Epiphanius — might have picked up on the meaning. It maybe the “Nazoreans,” those strange Christian heretics who believed in the Law of Moses and the Holy Spirit as Christ’s mother, had long since been vanished from their old Palestinian homeland. Yet, in the Qur’an, which was written almost two centuries after Jerome, described the Nazoreans as a mere curiosity, the Prophet not only uses their name as shorthand for all the “People of the Gospel,” but their ideas evoke some of his most bitter contempt. “Did you truly say to people,” God is portrayed asking Jesus, “Take me and my mother as two gods instead of God?” Of course, the Qur’an was labouring under an almost absurd mistaken assumption here: orthodox Christians, contrary to what the Nazoreans may have believed, had no concept of a “God the Mother.”\n\nIf Arianism of the Ostrogoths or Visigoths and Vandals (fedorati tribes, Northern Rome) had shockingly served to demonstrate, the place for Christian orthodoxy had never been completely destroyed. A heresy, if it can sustain itself beyond the reach of the imperial Church, may yet enjoy a late flourishing bloom. So, what and who are we to make of the Qur’anic references to the enigmatic Nasara? Arianism’s survival in the forests of the North shows that the Nazoreans may very well have survived in the deserts of the South. The one-sided debate on the nature of Christ found in the pages of the Quran — one that firmly rejects the Trinity and asserts that Jesus himself was only ever a man — has an atmosphere about it that seems to rise from a distant past, before the council of Nicaea, let alone Chalcedon, when there was no united Church, only a plethora of sects. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified;\n\n“They killed him not,” the Prophet declares, “nor did they crucify him, but so it was made to appear to them.” — Quran 4:157\n\nThis story is much older than the Quran itself coming from the second century gnostic gospels. Almost none of Basilides own works have survived, and he is not cited in Gnostic sources, his doctrine is derived entirely through his Christian opponents. Such an idea has not been heard in centuries. After all, what was it if not the long-delayed Gospel of Basilides argument? The voice we hear in the Quran is not necessarily that of Basilides himself, of course. Nevertheless, the echoes of long-muted Christian heretics — of Gnostics and Nazoreans — are sufficiently loud in the Qur’an to make one question where, if not from God, they might have originated from? This problem is made all the more disturbing by the fact that disappeared gospels are not the only traces of a distant past to be discovered in the holy text’s verses. The Qur’an alludes to old stories that have passed and yet continue to exist within itself. Unsurprisingly, many of these same hints have always been seen as a puzzle by commentators. There are phrases and even entire passages in the Qur’an that have long baffled scholars. What, for example, would one make of a brief sura about the punishment of wrongdoers known as “the People of the Trench”?\n\nNumerous attempts have been made throughout the centuries to explain this puzzling word in the Quran. According to one early scholar, it may have alluded to the servants of a king who used a catapult to launch Abraham into a flaming trench. Or Perhaps it was connected to Jewish king Yusuf’s genocide against the Christians of Najran in Yemen. But what if it wasn’t original to the Qur’an at all, but was borrowed from another textual source — specifically, one of those mysterious, old Jewish texts that occasionally appeared in the wilds of the desert outside Jerusalem in late antiquity? The discovery of an entire stockpile of similar writings, known as the “Dead Sea Scrolls,” has caused a number of experts to suspect a relationship between their teachings and those of the Qur’an. What else should be used to describe “hell” in the Dead Sea Scrolls if not “the Trench”? And what should be the fate of the condemned on the “Day of Judgement” if not to be cast into the “burning of the Trench”? Could this be the basis of the enigmatic and much-debated word in the Qur’an — a vision of the End Times preserved from a distant Jewish past?\n\nTraces of various ancient texts, ranging from Roman emperor’s propaganda to Christian saints stories, long-lost Gnostic gospels to ancient Jewish pamphlets, can be clearly found in the Qur’an. Just as Muhammad claimed to be the Seal of the Prophets, his revelations contained, signs of how earlier peoples, in the often distant past, had similarly had experiences with the divine.\n\nWhat does the Seal of the Prophet or Mohammad as the Last Prophet possibly imply?\n\nThe secret of Muhammad’s mission he claims maybe found in the fact that his fundamental doctrine was that “the times announced by Daniel and Jesus had arrived: So he was the last Prophet chosen by God to preside conjointly with the Messiah who was to return to earth for this purpose, at the end of the world and the final judgement”. It seems he firmly believed and taught that his coming, and the end of the world were causally connected, and he would probably witness the final dissolution before he dies, given the ongoing battle between the Romans and the Persians, as well as the plague and economic collapse very a plausible explanation. But again, debatable.\n\nEven gods who existed when Alexander was born are not entirely missing from its pages: after all, what are Dhu’l Qarnayn’s horns if not Amun god’s ram horns? Does the narrative of the Greek conqueror Alexander the Great’s appearance in the Quran, after all, provide us a hint to the term houri — wide and beautiful eyed virgins who will serve the faithful in heavens? It seems a strange coincidence, after all, that Zeus’s wife goddess ‘Hera’, Virgin Queen of Heaven, did have seductively huge wide eyes. Muslim scholars would undoubtedly be perplexed and disturbed by the Prophet’s emphasis that celestial maidens had “wide eyes,” judging it to be a description more suited to cows. Their anger would have been heightened if they had known that Hera was always referred to as “ox-eyed” in ancient Greek poetry.\n\nIn the Quran, the syriac legend of Alexander appears as Dhu’l Qarnayan(man with two horns). The coins that were issued in the wake of alexander’s death showed him with the curling ram horns of Ammon the king of the Egyptian god. The Quran portrays him travelling to the “setting of the sun.” Him according to the Qur’an, travelled to the ends of the known world, where he erected gates of iron covered with bronze, imprisoning the rushing armies of Gog and Magog. The Gog prophecy is meant to be fulfilled at the approach of what is called the “end of days”. A legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the Roman period. Then, after the Roman Emperor Heraclius defeated the Persians, took the true cross and escorted it back to Jerusalem. In celebration of this, a man in Syria wrote a story in which says, Alexander does much the same. It appears almost word for word in the Qur’an, with the exception of anything resembling of Christian or Roman propaganda being omitted. The Dhul-Qarnayn tale in the Quran, or Alexander, also travels eastwards, confronting Gog and Magog and walling them up behind bronze gates, but there is no mention of Jesus or Rome.\n\nEven more improbable than the depiction of Mecca as a thriving city or commercial hub is the possibility that it was once teeming with Gnostics, Roman propagandists, and fans of Homer and Virgil. But, if the Qur’an, did not start in Mecca, where did it come from? There is only one place to go for an answer to that question: inside the pages of the Qur’an itself. Muhammad is unlikely to have realised it, but his claim to be sealing the revelations of prior prophets was not unique to him. Three and a half centuries before the Qur’an’s composition, a man who desired and with much self-consciousness, to create the ultimate in holy books. Prophet Mani blended different religions, and his followers founded Manichaeanism.\n\nMani was born near Ctesiphon (Iran) in 216, soon before the city fell to Ardashir, he grew up in a Jewish-Christian sect known asElcesaites that, just like the Nazoreans, Manicheans practised circumcision, believed the Holy Spirit to be female, prayed to Jerusalem, and Mani claimed to be final prophet. The self-proclaimed prophet’s disciples spread to the borders of West and East, fashioning a truly worldwide faith from their master’s teachings. From Carthage to China and India, Manichaean units had sprung out “in every country and in every language.” They may have even been discovered in Arabia: the “Sabaeans,” a mysterious group mentioned in the Qur’an with the Jews and Christians as one of the three “Peoples of the Book,” were, it has been believed, none other than Manichaeans.\n\nBy the beginning of the seventh century, monotheism had almost completely established over the two opposing empires. Many sects deemed heretics were persecuted by both empires. These persecutions had impacted pagans, Manichaeans, Jewish Christians, and Christian Jews. There was no escape from imperial authority in the Fertile Crescent, but the vast desert to the south of the two major empires had produced ideas that had vanished elsewhere. Only in Arabia were the old cults able to survive, beyond the reach of emperors, bishops, and mowbeds. There was much more room for cross-pollination in Palestine’s borders. Nowhere else in the Near East have so many types and degrees of faith survived intact. There were Jews, whose attraction to the desert Arabs had long been acknowledged by church lawyer Sozomen, as well as monks, the uncompromising defenders of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, and the Monophysite soldiers of the Banu Ghassan — the Ghassanids.\n\nThe Samaritans too, despite the tragic failure of their revolt against Justinian, they had continued to oppose Roman authority, and in the aftermath of their defeat and persecution, they had migrated out into the neighbouring deserts. They were simply following in the footsteps of others who left the Holy Land: Ebionites, Nazoreans, and a variety of Christian heretics. However, not every type of belief found in northern Arabia was formed using materials brought across the Roman frontier. The pagan traditions that led Mundhir of Lakhmids to sacrifice al-’Uzza’s altar stones with the blood of four hundred Christian nuns and the Nabataeans to worship the black Ka’ba of Dushara had never been actively suppressed, in contrast to those of the Fertile Crescent.\n\nFor example, following the actions of Jewish king Yusuf in the Himyarite kingdom of Yemen in 523 C.E, where he massacred and burned down the Church of the Himyarite Christian population in Najrān, he was eventually overthrown and killed by a coalition of Christians from Ethiopia (Abyssinians), with support from the Romans. Concurrently, a domed monument, referred to as the Ka’ba due to its cuboid foundation, was erected over the remains of the Najran church as a memorial to the priests and virgins who had been massacred by Yusuf. Interestingly, according to Arabian sources, Khath’am an Arab Christian tribe, used to undertake annual pilgrimages to the Christian Ka’aba of Najran.\n\nIf the Christians of Najran preserved evidence of their ancestor’s reverence for worshipping rocks in the name they gave to their great shrine, it suggests that elsewhere in Arabia, wherever the faiths and customs of outsiders met those native to the Arabs themselves, the potential existed not just for conflict but for the imperial authorities’ ultimate nightmare: the cross-breeding of rival beliefs. And by the time of the Great War, this had become a nightmare. Fusion of religious practice's were being bred in Arabia. These hybrid cults presented frightening indications of what can arise as a result of a free market in beliefs. What, for instance, were rabbis or monks to make of a community that acknowledged a single god to be the creator of the world, freely confessed his omnipotence, and had a thoroughgoing knowledge of Moses and Jesus — yet offered up prayers to al-’Uzza?\n\nAccording to its biggest critic, Mohammad, this was nothing more than the filthiest and most degraded example of shirk. But the man making this charge was neither Jewish nor Christian. The Mushrikun were not mysterious aliens to Muhammad, they also believed in “one god” but often associate God with other beings. Although the Prophet is strongly opposed to his opponent’s worship of al-’Uzza — and other names called from the Arabian idol worship, such as al-Lat “and the third one, Manat” — he never actually accuses the Mushrikun of worshipping this trinity of “females.”\n\n“Now, have you considered Lât and ’Uzza, and the third one, Manât, as well? Do you prefer to have sons while you attribute to him daughters? — Quran 53:19–21.\n\nThe word “goddess” does not appear once in the Qur’an; nor does the Prophet mention the existence of pagan sanctuaries or shrines. Idols too, despite all the triumphant smashing of images that the Prophet is supposed to have got up to at Mecca, are also notable for their absence from his revelations — as well as from the archaeological record. So, if the Mushrikun did not recognize al-’Uzza as a deity, what did they think she was? The Prophet doesn’t wait long to provide an answer after naming her :\n\n“Those who deny the life to come, give the “angels” female names.”\n\nAl-’Uzza, no longer a deity, had become just a “daughter of God”. Muhammad was not the first to argue that those who claimed to be “monotheists” yet directed their prayers to angels. Christians have done the same thing since the time of Paul. “To call upon the angels by name, and to organise their worship, is strictly forbidden.” This was the strong warning of a Church Council held immediately after Roman king Julian’s death, at a period when bishops had particular need to warn the people against activities that smelled of the pagan.\n\n“Let anyone who is caught devoting himself to this concealed idolatry be cursed.”\n\nMuhammad couldn’t have said it better himself. How simple it was for humans, even those who professed to be fervent followers of the One True God, to stay enslaved to shirk. A veiled paganism — a pretended monotheism — that most unsettled and outraged the Prophet. In reality, Mushrikunes were monotheists who were accused of idolatry.\n\nThe Mushrikun’s crimes were not only heinous, but also hidden. Just as bishops in Justinian’s day were shocked to discover the enduring fondness of Christian peasants for rites practised by their unbaptized predecessors. The crime of Mushrikuns was “minor malpractices regarding the use of farm animals.” It was not only by the worship of angels, he charged, that the Mushrikun insulted the Almighty. They did it as well by slitting the ears of their livestock, exempting specific cattle from ever having to work a plough or carry a load, and occasionally refusing to mention the name of God in a slaughterhouse. Offences as heinous as these, the Prophet warned, would result in the guilty being “subjected to Hell.”\n\nNone of which, it is fair to say, would come to feature prominently in his biographies. If a concern to regulate agriculturalist behaviour appears to mix awkwardly with the considerably more dramatic and crowd-pleasing narratives told centuries later of his activities in Mecca, it is because it so obviously does at that time. It’s difficult to say which is more perplexing: the Qur’an’s utter absence of evidence for any idol smashing on Muhammad’s part, or its depiction of the Mushrikun as owners of vast herds of oxen, cows, and sheep’s.\n\nMost farmers would agree that Mecca, a notoriously arid and barren land, is not an ideal location for cattle ranching, just as the volcanic dust that makes up its soil is unsuitable for growing “grain, vines, fresh vegetation, olive trees, date palms, lush gardens, fruit, and fodder.” These, if they were to be found in seventh-century Arabia at all, would have been limited to oases or to Nabataea and the Negev, where the desert had been made to blossom during the Prophet’s lifetime and agriculture was flourishing like never before. The Qur’an contains details of a Roman defeat in the “nearby land,” as well as echoes of legends about Alexander the Great told in Syria. Moreover, the prophet’s description of how his enemy makes a living, and a fascination with Thamud hints to something pretty surprising. This setting of Muhammad’s revelations sounds more to the north of Mecca.\n\nThe Prophet’s eyes were set on an enormous horizon that stretched far beyond his birthplace. As a result, just nine sites are named throughout the whole Qur’an. Only two of them can be securely identified from records: Mount Sinai and Yathrib, the oasis settlement that would later become known as Medina. The third place, Badr, where the Qur’an implies a war was fought, had been referenced a century before by a poet praising a particularly cunning camel — but the only hint he had provided to its location was that it lay somewhere in the middle of a vast desert. Another five locations, including Mecca, are mentioned for the first time in the Qur’an and may have been anywhere given the amount of information provided.\n\nThe final location mentioned in the Qur’an, however, is the most enigmatic: a “House” in Bakka. Muslim scholars, perplexed by this connection, attempted to argue, with much cleverness, that this was just another name for Mecca — as well they could have, for Bakka is described in the Qur’an as a location of primal and incomparable holiness. But, the origins of the word “Mecca” is still unknown.\n\nThe valley of the Bakha is mentioned in the Book of Psalms Chapter 84, in the following passage:\n\n“Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. Those Who passing through the valley of the Bakha, they make it a spring; Also blessing the first rain will give. They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.”\n\nThe same Hebrew term (“bakha”) is related with a legendary battle described in 2 Samuel 5:23–24 in the Valley of Rephaim, some 4–7 kilometres southwest of Jerusalem’s current Old City. Scholar Patricia Crone, postulate that Mecca and Bakkah might not be different spelling variations of the same area, a view commonly held by historical and modern Islamic authors, but rather Bakkah existed in another place. Bakkah must have been located somewhere near Byzantine Empire’s southern frontier, Mecca before Islam is absent in Byzantine records of Hejaz, Quran mentioning Byzantine military expeditions and Quranic imagery (such as Mushrikun having cattle’s and gardens of vines, olives, and pomegranates) being vastly different from desert regions of Mecca and being more in line with wetter Syria-Levant region.\n\n“Pilgrimage to the House,” so the Prophet declares, “is a duty owed to God.” It’s no surprise, therefore, that the attempt to pinpoint the exact location of this incredible place has prompted commentators to add speculation upon speculation. That Bakka was Mecca, and that Mecca stood in the Hijaz, were propositions taken wholly for granted by biographies of Ibn Ishaq and his successors.\n\nNote that, if these places of pilgrimage are mentioned in scripture, but they’re not firmly located, then they’re up for grabs and people have an interest in a stake in locating where they might fit in with it. Just as Christian hermits gathered at “Mount Serbal” in the fourth century, believing it to be the biblical Mount Sinai, and then in the 6th century that the monastery built there was abandoned in favor of the newer belief that Mount Saint Catherine was the Biblical Mount Sinai.\n\nIt is currently hard to say where Muhammad believed Bakka stood. Such proof, if it ever existed, has long ago vanished. Or just as Mount Sinai, which has no historical roots other than in the stories, so, any mountain that fits the vague description can be Mount Sinai. At the very least, it is significant that Arabs in the wilds outside Palestine had a strong appetite for appropriating biblical settings. They, like Jews and Christians, have long come to Mamre’s sanctuary: the precise place maqom — where Abraham “had stood before the Lord.” Furthermore, the Arabs had accomplished what no other group outside the Christian dominion had imagined possible: a plausible claim to Abraham’s legitimate bloodline. The Arabs’ entitlement to the term “Ishmaelites” was openly recognised across the Fertile Crescent due to their heritage from Hagar, Abraham’s concubine and Ishmael’s mother.\n\nRather than being embarrassed about having a slave-girl in the family, those who were aware of their Hagarene ancestry had learned to enjoy it. A Nestorian historian near the Persian border with Mesopotamia referred to the existence of a mysterious domed sanctuary, reportedly established by Abraham and sacred to the Arabs, in the 660s, some two centuries after Theodoret originally documented the Ishmaelites’ pride in their genealogy. “Indeed,” the chronicler said, “there is nothing new for the Arabs to worship there — for they have showed respect to the father of the head of their nation since the beginning, from their earliest days.” A fascinating detail, because it is practically identical to what is stated in the Qur’an.\n\nIn the verse about the House of Bakka, the Prophet recognised the man who built it as none other than Abraham himself. Is it possible that the sanctuary praised in the Qur’an as the primaeval, the “blessed place,” was the same identical one known as far afield as Persia as “the Dome of Abraham”? At their desperate attempts to link Bakka with Mecca, Muslim scholars went to considerable and often absurd lengths to explain how a patriarch who, according to old tradition, had been given Canaan by God, rather than Arabia, could have ended up in Mecca. Some had him abandoning Hagar and Ishmael there on a long road journey; others, quite strikingly, depicted him as being directed by the Shekhinah — the rabbis’ term for the divine presence on earth.\n\nClearly, the precise location of the Arab’s desert shrine remained as a mystery to outsiders as it had always been. Nonetheless, there were some unsettling hints. One bishop, for example, observed that the Muhajirun of Iraq bowed to pray to the West — “towards the Ka’ba, primordial wellspring of their race” — while those in Alexandria bowed to the East. Surprisingly, Muslim tradition also recorded something very similar. According to tradition, the founder of the first mosque in Kufa launched an arrow to identify the qibla — the direction of prayer — and it fell somewhere to the west of the mosque, rather than to the south, in line with Mecca. In their imaginations, the idea that they acquired from Jews and Christians — that a single shrine may be bestowed with a holiness so awesome as to draw pilgrims from all over the world — competed with a diametrically opposed tradition. The fact that a bishop referred to the Muhajirun’s temple as “the Ka’ba” was highly useful, although there were Ka’bas stretching all the way from Nabataea to Najran.\n\nTo see the holy in even the most ordinary things, such as a spring, a well, or a strangely coloured stone, was an instinct among the Arabs; nevertheless, although this unmistakably referenced a sensitivity to the divine, it also indicated a careless attitude about the significance of specific shrines. Over the course of generations, sanctuaries have been repeatedly marked out as holy — became haram — and then abruptly abandoned. Even the Prophet, when attempting to describe the direction in which his followers should pray, was capable of a reversal:\n\n“The foolish people will say, ‘What has turned them away from the prayer direction they used to face?”\n\nThe Prophet had not thought to describe what the original qibla may have been, or what its replacement might have been — but the fact that one sanctuary had been promoted at the expense of another was apparent enough.\n\nCertainly, there is no evidence of Muhammad’s contemporaries believing Abraham was active in Mecca, that Abraham had established in Canaan, and that Hagar and Ishmael had taken refuge in one of the various stretches of desert that surrounded it. There is nothing in the Qur’an that would serve to contradict this general presupposition. In fact, just the contrary. The Prophet’s Bakka has the same supernatural atmosphere that has long been associated with another sanctuary: Mamre. “This is where Abraham stood to pray”: So the prophet portrays Bakka in the verse. So, if not the maqom, what could this possibly be an echo of?\n\nThere was definitely a connection between the Hebrew word for “place” and its Arabic equivalent. “Take as your place of prayer,” the Qur’an says, “the place where Abraham stood” — the Maqam Ibrahim. When Mecca eventually finally established as the site of Islam’s holiest sanctuary, Muslim scholars would associate this Maqam Ibrahim with a stone just to the north of the Ka’ba — an explanation that offers no insight into its far more likely beginnings many hundreds of kilometres to the north.\n\nThe fact that the Prophet repeatedly echoes the traditions linked with Mamre in his accounts of how the House at Bakka came to be established does not imply that the two shrines were one and the same — but it does reveal, to disturbing and dramatic effect, a very specific context for his revelations. The ground he and the Mushrikun walk on is imprinted with the footsteps of Abraham, Ishmael, the patriarch’s son, and Lot, his nephew. Why, therefore, do the Prophet’s opponents fail to understand the teachings written for them in such a landscape?\n\n“Lot was a messenger as well,” prophet recalls the Mushrikun: “Remember when We delivered him and all his household, Except for an old woman, who was left behind. Then We destroyed the others. You pass by them day and night; will you not understand?“\n\nThe allusion is about the Sodomites. What is interesting is that the location for this event was universally held to be near the Dead Sea, and the writer of the Qur’an says that his readers pass by these ruins day and night. This places the location of the writer far closer to Israel than Mecca, some 1,300 km to the south. It is clear that wherever the Prophet’s audience was located, it was clearly not far from what the Arabs named the Bahr Lut, or “Sea of Lot,” or what we now know as the Dead Sea. And, if the Qur’an is to be trusted , and Muhammad’s opponents did really reside within a short distance of the remains of Sodom and Gomorrah, the importance of the shrine at Bakka would scarcely have been in a remote desert near Mecca.\n\nBack in the reign of Justinian, a Roman ambassador had reported on the great desert shrine where “even the wild beasts live in harmony with men” he offered another important detail: it was sacred to “the majority of the Saracens.” Could this be Bakka’s desert shrine? The ambassador’s description is so vague that it’s difficult to be certain. Nonetheless, one intriguing detail among the Prophet’s numerous revelations appears to reflect the Roman report. According to the Qur’an, while working on the House of Bakka, Abraham and Ishmael prayed to God, “Make our descendants into a community loyal to you.” That was, of course, to portray their descendants, the Ishmaelites, as various divided factions. They may have been divided into several tribes, but according to the Qur’an, they were to be treated as just one people — a “community.” Bound by a unity of purpose, and joined by a common ancestry, what would they therefore share in, if not a God-sanctioned partnership — a shirkat?\n\n10. Decoding the Shirkat (Partnership): The Origin of the Term ‘Quraysh’\n\nIt was not the only God-approved partnership that existed beyond Palestine. Behind the Thamud — and every union of Arab tribes since — had lurked Roman interests and influence. It was only natural in an era when proxy wars between the two superpowers cast a deeper shadow over Arabia than ever before. This had prompted a significant recruiting drive on the side of Roman strategists in the decades preceding the great war with Persia, as they attempted to compensate for their relative shortage of troops along the border by employing Arabs to patrol it in depth. This, in turn, encouraged mass emigration from across Arabia, with whole tribes moving northward from the Hijaz into Palestine.\n\nThe provincial authorities attempt to manage and regulate this movement was clear in the effort with which they attempted to categorise the newcomers. Exotic names bloomed on the “foederati” squad. Although it was not an ethnic grouping between Palestine and the Hijaz, the provincial authorities attempted to foster it. Never before, perhaps, has the tribal make-up of Arabia attracted the curiosity of Roman strategists so intensely.\n\nAll is dead silence about Mecca, the city where the Prophet allegedly grew up, and in the Quraysh, the clan to which Muhammad allegedly belonged. Again, it is not until a century or more after the Prophet’s death that the name appears for the first time in a datable text — and even then, it is not quite clear what the reference means. This is doubly perplexing because, according to Muslim tradition, not only were the Quraysh the dominant power in the Hijaz, renowned far and wide across Arabia, but Muhammad’s own ancestor, an adventurer named Qusayy, is said to have seized power in Mecca only after Qaysar — “Caesar” — “had extended him aid.”\n\nWhy, then, do the Romans appear to have never heard of the ‘Quraysh’? Such a people did exist: in four tantalizing passages of the Qur’an, they are depicted as embarking on winter and summer journeys and getting both supplies and security from God. Even famous Muslim scholars may be perplexed by the precise meaning of the word “Quraysh.” Perhaps it was taken from the name of a well-known travel guide, a breed of camel, or a species of shark, they speculated. The reality was, no one knew anything more than two centuries after the Prophet’s death. The origins of the name “Quraysh” had long since been forgotten.\n\nThere was nothing out of the ordinary about this. When the Romans began referring to Arabs as “Saracens” in the fourth century, few realised that the name may have come from a word in the Arabs’ own unintelligible tongue: shirkat. Perhaps it is no surprise that Quraysh appears to reflect the same precise notion of “partnership” — but in Syriac. “Qarisha” means “collected together” — “confederated” in the Syriac language that had rapidly become the Fertile Crescent’s readiest lingua franca.\n\nIs this, then, to what “Quraysh” had originally referred — those tribes brought together in a common partnership, as foederati of the New Rome? It’s telling that the Ghassanid kings — and no doubt other Arab commanders — spoke Syriac as a matter of course, as it was the lingua franca throughout the fertile crescent. The Arabized term ‘qarisha’ might have been used well beyond the imperial boundaries as a convenient shorthand for all the tribes that had grown fat on Roman patronage. Of course, all of this is speculation. Nonetheless, if correct, it would suggest that the word of “Quraysh” in the Qur’an refers to an entire confederation of peoples; that the territories where they were to be found spanned from the Negev to the northern Hijaz; and that the sustenance and security supplied by God was mediated by Caesar — the Roman emperors.\n\nIf this is the case, it would surely explain why news of Roman defeat “in the nearby land” was broadcasted even in the Qur’an. After all, the Arabs across the border were not far removed from the conflict that ravaged the Fertile Crescent; rather, they were immediately and directly affected by it. By breaking the Roman hold on Syria and Palestine, the Persian invasion permanently severed what the Arab foederati had hitherto taken for granted: the supply of gold from their royal sponsors. Not that this would have meant absolute disaster: the Persian invaders would have been desperate for the same leather, food, and provender that Arab merchants had previously given to the Romans.\n\nFurthermore, based on the evidence of the Qur’an, the Mushrikun could provide these commodities on order. It is noteworthy that trade, no less than agriculture, appears to have captivated the Prophet, with even God being depicted by him as a merchant: one who receives the souls of humans as pledges for their debts and remorselessly keeps account of their activities in “an unblotted ledger-book.” No doubt, the Prophet’s evident familiarity with what appear to be extended business trips — both over the sea and on land — is telling as well. Perhaps the requirement to go by ship during the summer and with pack animals during the winter is one explanation for the Quraysh’s two annual trips.\n\nIn the 690s, more than a century before Ibn Hisham’s biography, it was already being recorded by a Christian chronicler in Edessa that “Muhammad travelled for the purposes of trade to the lands of Palestine, Arabia, and Syria.” A fascinating information — and, if true, one that suggests a record of business dealings at the height of the Persian occupation.\n\n” It is no offence,” the Qur’an says, “to seek some bounty from your Lord.”\n\nAfter all, war frequently provides opportunities for people on the margin to profit. The terminology for highways, forts, and even legionaries painted shields — all literally translated from the original Greek and Latin — have presences in the Prophet’s revelations. When, for example, in the opening sura of the Qur’an, the prayer “Guide us to the straight path” was offered to God. It marked a stunning act of appropriation. The huge military roads — the “strata” — that had covered the eastern boundary for generations and functioned as both symbols and tools of Roman strength were being brought to fade beneath the light of a heavenly ‘sirat’ — a road eternally straight. The Arabic term for road, ‘sirat,’ is derived from the Roman Latin word ‘strata’ via Classical Syriac.\n\nThe divine experience had taken many shapes and left countless imprints. Whether they were otherwise lost gospels, ancient Jewish literature discovered in caves, or copies of pagan epics stored in libraries for would-be lawyers to utilise, books, like humans, might speak of the need to comprehend heaven.\n\n“Those who disbelieve say: ‘This is nothing, but myths of the ancients.’ — Quran 6:25\n\nThe Prophet was sensitive to this specific accusation, as seen by his frequent efforts to refute it throughout the Qur’an. However, he never went so far as to proclaim the originality of his message.\n\n“This is certainly a revelation from the Lord of all worlds, which the trustworthy spirit brought down into your heart — so that you may be one of the warner’s — in a clear Arabic tongue. — but it is ‘also in the Books of the ancients’.” — Quran 26:192–195.\n\nJust as Jews consider the Talmud as a record of eternity and Christians see the Church as an emblem of the unchanging order of the heavens, the Prophet — always a man of his time — insisted on the timelessness of his message.\n\nHe might have declared “the straight path” to God with such courage and conviction. What were the unpaved strata, long ago abandoned in a condition of chronic decay by Justinian’s budget cuts? One was immortal, while the others were already returning to the barren sands. Confederations, like highways, may fail. What was a band of mercenaries loyal to a foreign power compared to a community of Believers devoted solely to God? The Thamud had long since fallen, and their descendants, God willing, would as well. “We gave them guidance, but they chose blindness above guidance.” The Prophet’s adversaries were doubly Mushrikun: not only did they connect angels with God as appropriate objects of worship, but they were also tied to a joint servitude as participants in a Roman-sponsored shirkat. They were not only heretics, but also collaborators. Naturally, the offence against God was the most unpleasant to the heavens — but there were other hints in the Qur’an of lesser earthly sins and mistakes.\n\nThe Prophet presents his followers as a mirror image of the foederati. Just as entire tribes had long been migrating to the north, driven by their desire for Caesar’s money, but now in the cause of God, the Believers were to be regarded as emigrants — the Muhajirun. A brilliant move. A monarch who was immeasurably more powerful than both Caesar and Shahanshah was being served. An entire mass-movement pattern was being redesigned and placed in dramatic reversal. “Whoever abandons his home as an emigrant to God and His Messenger and is seized by death, his reward lies upon God, because God is All-Forgiving and Compassionate to each.” Not that one necessarily had to die before being rewarded for joining the Muhajirun. However, earthly rewards were not to be ignored.\n\n“They inquire about your booty.” One sura begins. “ Say: ‘Booty belongs to God and His Messenger.’\n\nThis was a message intended to resonate with anyone experiencing financial difficulties during a time of global disaster. Even if the profits from selling leather to the Persians were considerable, it was unlikely that they would make up for the lack of payments from Caesar’s agents. The Arab tribes that had flocked north on the scent of Roman gold and who had depended on their paymaster’s wealth for decades had suffered severe impoverishment. So perhaps the Prophet’s word, that he had authority from God to loot unbelievers, would have been received joyfully.\n\n“Think back to a period when you were few in number and perceived as weak on earth, when you were afraid that mankind would rip you apart. He provided you with safety, helped you in His victory, and gave you His blessings.”\n\nBounties from the Roman rulers that perhaps earlier Muhammad’s followers might have been happy to accept — but not now. A dried-up reservoir was no longer a reservoir at all. Despite the heavy layering added centuries later by prophets biographers and commentators, the real incident may still almost be traced. The Qur’an is the biggest evidence to them, rather than being at some mythical distance from the ebbs and flows of time. It is the account of a man going through a time of entirely unknown upheavals, alert in every way to the word of God, and showing a distinctively intellectual sensibility even as he considers the end of the universe.\n\nGod describes the approaching End Times by saying, “That will be the Day when We roll up the heavens as a writer folds up his scrolls,” — Quran 21:104, at one point. Such pictures, which recur frequently throughout the Qur’an, reveal a man who was the exact opposite of illiterate and who, despite laying claim to enormously venerable traditions of divine inspiration, knew well what he was doing. The Seal of the Prophets was to be just that: “a herald of good tidings, a bearer of warning.” The good news offered an answer to humanity’s problems independent of human agency; the warning described what would occur to those who chose to ignore it.\n\nBut simply having the Prophet’s message imprinted into the minds of his listeners was not sufficient. The problems of the day were both political and spiritual, and both economic and moral. The Prophet understood that not just individuals, but society itself, needed to be shaped to God’s purposes, just like the rabbis of Mesopotamia and Tiberias, Justinian, and his great team of jurists did. It would appear that this is what motivated him to start a state, first among the Mushrikun and then, after they rejected him, among the Muhajirun. And its capital? In this instance, at least, there is no conflict between the Qur’an and the massive network of later Islamic tradition. The Qur’an claims that all of these events took place in a location that it actually names, including a battle that was fought against insurmountable odds, “a violent wind and invisible forces” sent by God against the Prophet’s enemies, and a glorious victory that was snatched from the jaws of defeat. It would appear that Yathrib, a rich oasis in the northern Hijaz, was in fact “Madinat an-Nabi,” or the “City of the Prophet.” Medina served as Muhammad’s first heavenly outpost that he built on earth, according to tradition. Does this imply that the story of a single, dramatic flight there, known as a hijra, is similarly founded in reality? It is noteworthy that the word itself does not exist in the Qur’an anywhere, and that all references to the Prophet’s departure to Yathrib — as with so many other events in his life — are extremely late in their development.\n\nThe Prophet and his followers may have had some significance in mind when they were “emigrating,” which later tradition has clouded. This is perhaps enough cause for suspicion. Although the hijra narrative is memorable, there seems to be a glimpse of something far more seismic hidden behind it. Emigration is portrayed in the Qur’an as an obligation owed to all believers, regardless of their situation or location. Far from alluding to a single journey into exile — whether to Yathrib or to anywhere else — it seems to imply a call to arms that is all-embracing, universal and unbounded by time or place.\n\n“Anyone who migrates for God’s cause will find many a refuge and great plenty in the earth.”\n\nNothing could have sounded more unsettling or radical to the Prophet’s listeners. For any Arab, the idea of leaving behind family and tribe was the most horrifying thing imaginable. But if the Qur’an is to be believed, then this was the commitment that the Prophet was calling for — not only from his own people, but from all the different Ishmaelites, wherever they may be found, throughout the whole of Arabia. The successful raising of his banner at Yathrib, against the backdrop of the world’s evident end, was merely the beginning. All were asked to accompany the Prophet on a journey that might take him somewhere only God knew, but only those with the courage — or perhaps the pure desperation — to accept his challenge and set out on a new beginning. There was certainly no shortage of Arabs who were ready to respond to the call, whether they were attracted by heaven, loot, or both. “You are the most virtuous and morally upright group of people to ever emerge among mankind, who also profess faith in God”. The Prophet praised the Muhajirun as a group of warriors who had it in them to not only establish an entirely new social structure but also to inherit the earth as a reward for doing so. A claim that would soon be proven true and pretty dramatically so.\n\n11. What really happened in the 630s?; The Siege of Damascus (634) and the Siege of Jerusalem (636–637)\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the plague, there was a tremendous process of closing everything down, including roads, fortifications, garrisons, and so on. In the fertile crescent, the Romans virtually decommissioned their forts along the Palestinian and Syrian borders. The citadels and fortresses were abandoned to Jackals, weeds and to hermits. And here, for those Arabs outside the border looking to benefit themselves, was another opportunity to hold onto Roman gold. Business conditions have not been better since the collapse of the spice trade. Syria’s countryside, as well as its towns, had been devastated by the plague. For the Arab’s the implications of this are enormous since the source of money that their paymasters in Constantinople had been providing them has suddenly been cut off, and they, too, are caught up in this cataclysm.\n\nThe Ghassanids and Lakhmids were enemies fighting for Rome and Persia for a long time. However, in the early 600s, both Rome and Persia breaks the Arab federation, and Kushrow II assassinates the ruler of Lakhmid kingdom. Then when the potracted Byzantine-Sassanian war(602–628) ended, it left both Romans and Persians resources depleted. As the treasuries of both the Romans and Persians were severely depleted, neither empire was in a position to mount a defense. The Romans simply withdrew from the areas, leaving a power vacuum that the Arabs filled. Arabs took advantage of this opportunity to seize control of these territories because the war, combined with the devastating Justinian plague, caused severe economic collapse among Arabs, resulting in them taking over Syria, Jerusalem, and conquering Persia.\n\nThere are few early Christian sources that describe Mohammad invading Palestine in 634 and wanting to build a prayer place for his followers on the old Jewish temple on Temple Mount (which was in ruins during the Roman period) and his goal was to capture Jerusalem which appears to be the holy place for his followers, but nobody seems to have met him in person, and the source information appears to be written based on stories told or learned from others. A century later, caliphs like Abd al-Malik were likely to want to Jerusalemize Mecca as the new holiest site for Muslims, diconnecting their roots from Jews and Christians.\n\nThere was the mysterious Arabian prophet to whom the Doctrina Jacobi refers in 640C.E, whose words and deeds resemble those of the prophet of Islam and differ sharply from them in important ways. He refers to an “Antichrist,” an Arab “armed with a sword,” He says also that he has “the keys of paradise”,who is alive after Muhammad was supposed to have died. This information is acquired from a letter by a Palestinian Jew and the event in the letter is set in 634C.E.\n\nThere was the Mhmt to whom Thomas the Christian priest refers in the 640s, whose Taiyaye were doing battle with the byzantines.\n\nYou can read more about the earliest source in the book “Seeing Islam as Others Saw it” by historian Robert G. Hoyland\n\nExcept for minor skirmishes, evidences from the 630s suggests that there was no planned conquest or large scale invasion of Jersualem or Damascus except the conquest of Persia. The Arabs from the east seize Damascus in 634, and the Arabs from the west seize Jersualem (636–637). They beat a Roman army (made up of Arabs) at Yarmuk(636), then at Qadisiyyah they beat a Persian army. Despite the lack of supporting verifiable evidence, Muslim writers later Islamized these encounters to argue that the conquests were for Islam. Early Arab commanders and rulers never mention that they are acting in support of a new religion or a prophet named Mohammad. And there is no evidence for any “rightly guided caliphs” perhaps they were local warlords, but no one mentions them in any sources. ‘The conquerors were neither all Arabs nor all Muslims, and the meaning of both terms was in any case evolving in the immediate aftermath of the conquests.’\n\nScholar and historian of Islam, Robert G Hoyland assertes in his book “In God’s path”: The impression one gets from the contemporary sources that we have looked at is that in the 620s and early 630s Muhammad’s west Arabian coalition was only one among many Arabian groups trying to take advantage of the lax security situation created by the pre-occupation of Byzantium and Persia with warring against each other. On the margins of these empires raiding had become endemic already by the 620s. Even once the Arab takeovers were under way in the late 630s, it is likely that some opportunists took the chance to enrich themselves under the cover of the chaotic political situation. A chief with the un-Arab and un-Islamic name of Qanan, for example, took some captives in southern Anatolia and he and his followers killed a Byzantine general who attempted to challenge them. These other actors are, however, airbrushed out of history by later Muslim writers, or if mentioned at all they are recast as false prophets or claimed as loyal Muslims.\n\nChristian chroniclers inform us about some of these raiding parties who were not part of Muhammad’s coalition, but they are not interested in the details of their identities and usually to them using generic terms such as Saracens and Tayyaye. It is therefore all but impossible for us to probe beneath the surface of the storyline presented by later Muslim historians that the conquest venture was fully managed and directed solely by Muhammad and his successors from Medina. There are enough small cracks in this storyline for us to see that the Arab conquests were not initiated by Muhammad alone, but had begun before him and were being conducted by other leaders in other locations; yet we cannot easily recover their aims or identities.\n\nThe various Arab warlords, who had built out this empire from pieces of the Roman and Persian empires, started to fight among one another, and It appears that the basis for this territorial dispute or struggle reflects the much older division between Lakhmids and Ghassanids -the old Arab mercenaries employed by the Romans and Persians. According to Shia or Muslim tradition, the fourth caliph Ali is the one who ought to be the first caliph; he is the heir to the Lakhmids, is referred to as the Amir of Hira,who then was assassinated by a persian slave in 662 and his opponent Mu’awiya, an Umayyad, an Arab, according to even traditional Muslim accounts, had territories or estates within in Roman Syria and Palestine which is something that is clearly impossible if he is from Mecca, so it seems he has the power base that is within Syria, which he utilises to seize control of the former Lakhmid region (Mu’awiya is from the Marwanid family of Northern Syria or Iraq). The battle between them results in establishing the Umayyad dominion in Syria; basically, the Roman side ultimately wins over the Persian side. Mu’awiya is the first historically attested ruler of the Arab empire. There is no evidence that Mu’awiya was a Muslim; in fact, he struck coins bearing Christian crosses. He is welcomed in Jerusalem and makes pilgrimage to Christian holy places. When he passed away, there was another implosion; this is still remembered by Shi’as as the Battle of Karbala, a civil war.\n\nThe date of Ali’s assassination derives from Muslim historians, but it is typical of the general murk of the sources for the period that a near-contemporaneous Marionite Christian chronicle, written in Syria, dates it to 658.\n\nMuawiya’s earliest ideas on monarchy were inspired by ideas that didn’t have much in common with the Roman model. Was it just a coincidence, for instance, that he engaged with God in a similar way to how angels participate in Mushrikun prayers? Mu’awiya — was the lord of Chalcedonian and Monophysite Christians, of Jews and Samaritans, of Zoroastrians and Manichaeans — had far more options available to him.\n\nEven before this civil war, a warband known as the Kharijites was ravaging the empire, killing anyone they came across in the markets or on the streets. The origins of Kharijites rebels are unclear and disputed. During this period of uncertainty, a new claimant to the empire emerges from deep within Arabia, his name is Abdulla Ibn al-Zubayr, he was a staunch opponent of the Ummayads, and he, too, is confronted by Kharijites rebels who pose a threat to his rule. So, his brother Mus’ab simultaneously launched a military campaign that extended as far as the Persian uplands across the south of Iraq in response to the far bloodier and taxing mission of suppressing the Kharijites. It was not only through a counter-insurgency campaign, however, that Ibn al-Zubayr aimed to bring order to a chaotic world. But he also knew that not every message has to be delivered using a sword. The Kharijites motto was “Judgement belongs to God alone.” Because, in Kharijites’ opinion, the successor should be chosen not by family, but by God’s judgement. Ibn al-Zubayr now wants to redefine the message of Kharijites. While in no way opposing this message, Ibn al-Zubayr and his followers decided to seek to improve it by describing in as much detail as possible that how and when the judgement of God had been revealed.\n\nI’m afraid to include as much information on the origin of Kharijites as described in traditions, because scholars disagree on the exact origin of this warband. Therefore i’m attaching the Wikipedia page for you to read more about the historical analysis of Kharijites: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharijites scroll down to the “Historical analysis” section.\n\nAs the fitna went on in Iraq, one of Zubayr’s lieutenants created a coin in Sassanian style conveying a unique and shocking message in either 685 or 686. It read, “In the name of God, Muhammad is the Messenger of God,” or “Bismallah Muhammad rasul Allah.”\n\nThis is the first coin in recorded history to have the name Muhammad, who is now officially recognized as a prophet of God. Ibn al-Zubayrs opponent’s the Kharijites was upholding the motto, “judgement belongs to God,” but now it comes through the “messenger of God”, Mohammed. The power of this slogan was clear in the midst of the violence and turmoil of the times. The brilliance of Ibn al-Zubayr was to see, as Roman emperor Constantine had long before him, that any monarch of a huge empire who claimed God’s favour must make sure that the foundation of that favour was rock solid. Military action would never be enough to put a stop to the fitna of the Kharijites. Only a framework of principles that all fighters might embrace as genuine and gifted by God had any chance of doing this. Hence, the supreme value of the example of the Prophet.\n\nWhereas Constantine at Nicea had been forced to rely on fractious and unreliable bishops to stamp a particular brand of his chosen faith as orthodox, Ibn al-Zubayr had discovered a considerably less troublesome sanction: not only had Muhammad claimed to be a medium for divine revelation, but he was also safely long dead by that time. Illustrate that ‘Mohammad’ had truly been a Messenger of God, and that whatever ascribed to him was going to be received by the faithful as a message dropped from heaven. “Those who disrespect the Prophet,” God had revealed to Muhammad, “are cursed in this world and in the next.” This was a true blessing for any warlord wanting to doom his opponents. This was why, as Ibn al-Zubayr and his men became more aware of its potential, they made more use of their new message that: Muhammad had actually been the Prophet of God. It seemed to promise them world dominance far more effectively than any troop surge in Iraq.\n\nIbn al-Zubayr may have had a relationship with or direct knowledge of Mohammad. Even as other Arabs began to forget Mohammad, he may have retained some of his memories even nearly 60 years after his death.\n\nAmid the chaos another Umayyad emerges during that period of the civil war. This Umayyad is a relative of Mu’awiya, a Marwanid, and the son of Marwan. He is known as “Abd al-Malik,” and while his power was based in Syria, he faced rivals in Arabia. The enemies of Abd al-Malik minted coins that refer to Mohammad as a prophet of God and Abdul malik in response did the same, because both sides in the civil war recognized the power of Mohammed’s prophetic status, which many Arabs appeared to have acknowledged even as their memories of him were fading. This gave both sides a reason to justify their actions, and in the end, whoever gains control of Mohammed can essentially justify themselves as the deputy of God, the caliph, the Khalifa — “successor selected by God”. And Abd al-Malik won; it was during his rule that much of what we now identify as canonically Islamic began to develop. For instance, the kind of architecture that would get from the “Dome of the Rock” which will evolve to become the mosques and the abstraction of the “lack of images” on the coins to emphasize the text of the scripture, and the establishment of Arabic as the official language of the ruling classes. And it is from that point onwards, Islam truly begins to establish itself as an imperial religion, the religion of conquerors. Abd al-Malik is also the Constantine of the Arabs.\n\nAbd al-Malik constructs the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount, the holiest place for Jews, where the old Jewish temple once stood. The structure is based on the Church of Resurruction in Jerusalem. Just as the rabbis associated this location with the Shekhinah — the divine’s immanence on earth — Abd al-Malik and his architects gave it a similarly awe-inspiring significance. Inside the Dome was a rock platform. According to traditional Jewish sources, it is believed to be the place from which the creation of the world began where God stood on the rock and then went into heaven, leaving an impression of His foot behind. Moreover, many Jews believe the site to be where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac.\n\nIn due course, this tradition would become an embarrassment to Muslim theologians, since it implied that God had a body. In the eleventh century, an alternative explanation for the construction of the Dome of the Rock was enshrined: that it commemorated the ascension into heaven not of God but of Muhammad, who was supposedly transported from Mecca to Jerusalem specifically for the purpose.\n\nThe rock would also be transfigured at the end of time, because on the Day of Judgement, all the faithful, all the mosques around the world, and even the Ka’ba itself, were destined to travel to Jerusalem, “so that the people will cry, Hail to you, who come as pilgrims, and hail to her to whom the pilgrimage is made.’” Given the seeming imminence of the “End Days”, it’s understandable that Abd al-Malik wanted to erect a monument appropriate for the climactic role that the Rock was destined to play in them.\n\nIn the autumn of 691, Abd al-Malik appointed his trusted commander Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf to capture and kill Ibn al-Zubayr who is reportedly hiding in a sanctuary. The exact location of this sanctuary is still unknown. Al-Hajjaj is said to have destroyed the sanctuary and killed Ibn al-Zubayr. So, while no contemporary informs us just where Ibn al-Zubayr took refuge, the weight of evidence points to a place to the north of the Hijaz, around halfway between Kufa and Alexandria.\n\nTwo years later, the Abd al-Malik himself embarked on an extravagant pilgrimage to the desert. Already lord of the Temple Mount, where the Dome of the Rock was completed in the same year as the defeat of Ibn al-Zubayr, he now claimed authority over a location equally impressive and sacred. “To us belong two Houses: the House of God, of which we are governors, and the venerated House on the mount of Jerusalem,” a court poet penned in celebration of his sparkling success. Yet there was another telling uncertainty here. Of course, the position of the Dome of the Rock was obvious — but where precisely was the mysterious “House of God”? The poet did not think to mention it. Neither did any of his contemporaries. Perhaps this was to be expected. Literate people, after all, did not tend to live in the desert — or visit it either. Even if the habit of going on pilgrimage to Arabia had become well established before the time of Abd al-Malik — and there is no evidence that it had — then the increasing anarchy of the times would surely have halted the practice.\n\nAs a result, among those believers sufficiently educated to put pen to record, the particular facts of the faraway desert sanctuary, even down to its own name, appear to have been a fog. The most reliable clues to its whereabouts may be found not in poetry, chronicles, or gazetteers, but in stone. Workmen fiddled with the design of various mosques in the years after Abd al-Malik’s voyage to Arabia. Qiblas that had previously directed east were painstakingly reoriented to the south, from the busiest section of the Nile to the most isolated corner of the Negev. Meanwhile, the west-facing qibla at Kufa was deliberately angled in the same direction. The House of God no longer appeared to be located between Medina and Palestine. Rather, if the mosque renovators calculations were to be trusted, it lay far further south, in the depths of the Hijaz. A location that could only have been Mecca.\n\nNaturally, such a shift was noticed. Even after sixty years, opponents of Abd al-Malik still condemned him as the one who “destroyed the sacred House of God.” Even in the immediate aftermath of his conquest of Arabia, however, confusion regarding what had happened and what constituted “the sacred House of God” was widespread and growing. Umayyad’s propagandists, while not denying the destruction wrought by Al-Hajjaj, insisted that the true vandal had been Ibn al-Zubayr, and that Abd al-Malik had merely restored the Ka’ba to its original, pristine condition.\n\nFew Arabs thought to dispute this claim: the belief that a sanctuary might be demolished and rebuilt not once, but multiple times, and still remain numinously the same was widely accepted. In due course, Abd al-Malik and Ibn al-Zubayr would join a long list of persons who had allegedly either repaired or rebuilt the House of God: legends such as Muhammad, Abraham, and Adam. The future of the Ka’ba was one that would see it enshrined as both a marker of Adam’s tomb and the pivot of the cosmos itself. If there was an echo, in this sensational array of attributes, of the traditions that Christians, in the wake of Helena’s (Constantine mother) discovery of the True Cross out of nowhere, claiming it to be the real cross where Jesus was said to be crucified, had attributed to the rock of Golgotha, then that was surely no coincidence. Just as it had taken Constantine to establish, once and for all, the site of Jesus’s crucifixion, so likewise, perhaps, had it needed a ruler such as Abd al-Malik — an autocrat no less visionary, self-confident or domineering — to define this sanctuary as the eternal heartbeat of the world.\n\nNone of which, of course, solves the mystery of why an obscure and barren spot a thousand miles from the centre of Umayyad power should have been chosen for such an honour. But it is clear that Abd al-Malik must have had motivations beyond simple opportunism. Just as he would never have promoted Muhammad as the founder of his religion without truly believing that the Prophet had been an authentic medium for the words of God, so would he never have gone on pilgrimage to a site that lacked any aura of the sacred. Long before his arrival there, a Ka’ba must surely have stood on the spot. Perhaps, like the one at Bakka, it also had some association with Muhammad. If not, then the Umayyads would certainly have had both motive and opportunity for promoting it as the shrine named in the Prophet’s revelations as Mecca.\n\nBack in the time of Mu’awiya, he made a strong attempt to strengthen his hold-over Arabia despite having spent the most of his reign located in Syria. Any piece of ground that could sustain crops had been ruthlessly seized, its water sources had been changed, and its settlements had been taken over. The Umayyad henchmen’s entry into the oasis in Medina had only increased the family’s unpopularity and sparked Ibn al-Zubayr’s uprising. However, the policy has seen noticeably more success further south in the Hijaz. In fact, Mu’awiya had made such a significant investment in the area that Ta’if, a thriving oasis that served as its summer capital, was supposed to have moved there from Palestine.\n\nAbd al-Malik’s links to the town were probably even closer. Not only had his father, Marwan, served as its governor, but his most trusted lieutenant, Al-Hajjaj, had grown up in the oasis. Both, then, would surely have been fully familiar with the shrine that stood a mere 60 miles or 96 kilometres to the north-west, behind a wall of wind-scoured, black-baked mountain, and which Abd al-Malik himself honoured as the House of God in 694: the shrine that history would remember as the Ka’ba of Mecca or the “cube” of Mecca. So it was that a second sanctuary — paired with the Dome of the Rock — came to be enshrined once and for all as a fit object of pilgrimage for the faithful. This much seems clear enough. Beyond that, however, everything is obscure. Was Abd al-Malik the first Amir to renovate the site, or did he follow in the footsteps of Ibn al-Zubayr? Where had the sanctuary demolished by Al-Hajjaj stood — at Bakka or at Mecca? What was more necessary for the conquerors to establish: continuity with the past or a fresh start?\n\nCertainly, more than a century after the reign of Abd al-Malik, there was a persisting suspicion that the House of God might not have always been anchored to the location in Mecca. One Muslim scholar would recall: “At the time of the Prophet, may God save him and give him peace, our faces were all turned in one direction — but after the death of the Prophet, we turned ourselves hither and thither.” Others, as per reports of Mecca, may express similar concerns. In these accounts, not only was the Ka’ba constantly being demolished and rebuilt — so too was the mosque that enclosed it.\n\nA sacred well was lost and then miraculously rediscovered on no less than two separate occasions. Most bewildering of all, perhaps, was the sheer range of sacred stones associated with the holy site, and which were forever being shifted or discovered. There was the Maqam Ibrahim, for instance, which had been carried along by a flood. Then there was the rock uncovered by Ibn al-Zubayr, and which had been stamped with the name of God. Finally, and perhaps most enigmatically of all, there was the much-venerated “Black Stone,” which enjoyed a prominent position in the wall of the Ka’ba. Some claimed that Adam had found it, whereupon it had gobbled up the parchment on which was written his contract with God. Others said that Abraham had unearthed it and then dragged it all the way to Mecca with Ishmael. But, still others claimed that Ibn al-Zubayr found it during the construction of his sanctuary and placed it in an ark, similar to the one used by Moses to transport the Torah through the desert.\n\nThe Black Stone, it seemed, was not only fabulously ancient — it was surprisingly mobile as well. As such, it is hardly unique. A talisman like the Black Stone had long been an important necessity for any monarch who desired to conceal the parvenu status of a recent foundation under a veneer of class. After all, antiques were associated with status. This was why Constantine had introduced a touch of old Troy to his upstart capital, assuming the narrative about him stealing the statue of Palladium from Rome was to be believed. In Late Antiquity, it was rumoured that the Palladium was transferred from Rome to Constantinople by Constantine the Great and buried under the Column of Constantine in his forum.\n\nSimilarly, during Persian king Peroz’s reign, the mowbeds had lit the “Fire of the Stallion” (Fire Temples are places of worship in the Zoroastrian religion) amid the desolate peaks of Media claiming to be Zoroaster’s birthplace, insisting that its flames were, in fact, eternal and had originally roamed the world. The claim had worked incredible magic in just a few generations. Zoroastrians who were horrified by Heraclius’ demolition of the Temple had no idea it had only been in existence for a century and a half. The history assigned to a sanctuary, especially if it is lonely, may provide evidence NOT of the preservation of real customs, traditions, or recollections, but of the polar opposite: bold innovation. And, without a doubt, Abd al-Malik was a revolutionary in his determination to reshape the world as he saw fit. Even before his decisive triumph against Ibn al-Zubayr, he had been planning how to brand his enormous empire as he had previously stamped Jerusalem: as celebrated by the authentic religion of God.\n\nAccording to a variant Islamic tradition, Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, governor of Iraq, collects the Qur’an, standardizes its text, has variants burnt, and distributes his version to all the provinces. Hajjaj then introduces Qur’an reading into mosque worship. He adds diacritical marks into the text of the Qur’an, enabling the reader to distinguish between various Arabic consonants, thereby enabling the reader to make sense of the text.\n\n12.
