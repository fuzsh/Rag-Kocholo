This was accompanied by destruction of the cities of those civilizations, the demise of their Kingdoms and a transition period, after which different and, at first smaller, entities emerged. The causes of these events have been assigned variously to technological advances, natural catastrophe and migrations. Whilst the empires of Egypt and Babylon were significantly impacted they managed to survive and the changes were greatest in the Eastern Mediterranean. In Greece the events were followed by the “Greek Dark Ages” and are thought to have influenced the story lines of later Greek epic poems such as the Iliad and the Odyssey capturing both the past glories and the chaos of the period.

He is remembered today for his efforts on behalf of Korean independence in the waning days of the Joseon dynasty and a statue to his memory now stands near the gates of Seoul's Changdeok Palace. In 1895, Min was appointed as the first ambassador to the United States. However, the murder of his aunt, the Empress Myeongseong, by Japanese troops in October 1895, prevented his taking up the post. In April 1896, Min was appointed special ambassador and sent to Russia to attend the coronation of Czar Nicholas II. After a six month journey Min returned to Korea in late October of the same year. In January 1897, Min was again sent to Europe as Korean envoy to the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. These journeys served to further convince Min of the necessity of modernization. Upon his return to Korea, Min was an active supporter of the Independence Club.\n\nOn November 17, 1905, Japan succeeded in foisting upon Korea the Eulsa Treaty making Korea a Japanese protectorship. Min and many other officials pleaded with King Gojong to annul the treaty and execute the five Korean officials who had signed it, now widely referred to as the \"Five Traitors of Eulsa\" (Eulsa ojeok). But, his remonstrations were silenced by Japanese force, Min decided to commit suicide as a final act of resistance and protest by a loyal official. On November 30, 1905 Min cut his own throat. After his death, in his pockets were found five identical messages on the back of his calling cards to the representatives of China, Great Britain, the United States, France, and Germany in which he pleaded with those powers to recognize the true situation within Korea. He also left a final message directed towards the people of Korea, in which he promised to help his fellow countrymen \"from the nether world\" if they would strengthen their collective will and spirit and exercise their learning in an all out effort to \"restore our freedom and independence.\" - Wiki\n\nPlea found on the back of envoy calling cards:\n\nOur twenty million citizens may be annihilated in the midst of their struggle for survival.

He is most well known for the account of his shipwrecked travels in China from February to July 1488, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Choe's diary accounts of his travels in China became widely printed in the 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also utilize his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century. (Wikipedia)\n\n\"Choe Bu is determined to prove himself a good Confucianist and Korea a great Confucian state. Not only do the Koreans impress the Chinese with their behavior, but they are also well on the way to proving that they are respectable people. Good manners and Choe's Confucian learning save their lives.\" (Choe Bu's Diary, From the Introduction by John Meskill)\n\n*Note all connection descriptions are from the travel diary of Joseon Official Choe Bu.

After 20 years the Augustae were supposed to retire - but only 1 successful rotation took place - in 305. Each ruler had a territory - leading to the creation of \"multiple\" capitals for Italy, East, Gaul and Illyricum. It lasted in various forms from 293 AD to 324 though it began to break down in 305 and the period after 313 was one of internecine conflict until Constantine emerged victorious in 324 uniting the empire and declaring himself the sole \"Augustus\" (but now ruling from the East). The \"personnel\" involved included - Diocletian, Maximian, Constantius, Galerius, Severus, Maximinus, Licinius, Maxentius and Constantine. 6 Thirty Years' War The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history.

These did exist in Ancient times but had their high point much later after the introduction of the Camel around 3C AD such that \"regular trade routes did not develop until the beginnings of the Islamic conversion of West Africa in the 7th and 8th centuries. Two main trade routes developed. The first ran through the western desert from modern Morocco to the Niger Bend, the second from modern Tunisia to the Lake Chad area. These stretches were relatively short and had the essential network of occasional oases that established the routing as inexorably as pins in a map. Further east of the Fezzan with its trade route through the valley of Kaouar to Lake Chad, Libya was impassable due to its lack of oases and fierce sandstorms. A route from the Niger Bend to was abandoned in the 10th century due to its dangers\" (Wiki) The main goods included gold and slaves going north and Salt going south.

The exact route described by the term is difficult to determine since it varied over time, had several branches and archaeological views about it have varied. The current name has been Latinised from \"The Way of the Sea\" (Isaiah 9:1) and seems to have been adopted in late C13 as meaning the total coastal route from Egypt to the Northern Levant and beyond. Some scholars believe however that the Isaiah was refering only to a route from Meggido to Tyre.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Maris 5 VOC The VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) or Dutch East India Company was a chartered company established in 1602, when the States-General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly to carry out trading and colonial activities in Asia. 5 WIC The Dutch West India Company (Dutch: Westindische Compagnie or WIC) was a chartered company of Dutch merchants.
