        "text": "Umayyad Caliphate is born\n\nJuly 25, 661 CE is the date when a brand new political setup rose from the ruins of the Rashidun Caliphate. For the next ninety years, it ruled over all those areas previously governed by the Rashidun Caliphate from its capital, Damascus. , It is usually referred to as the Umayyad Caliphate in the annals of history from the fact that all fourteen rulers were from the Umayyah clan of Quraysh. , The citizens of the Umayyad Caliphate, however, did not call it by this name. They called their country ‘Allah’s Caliphate.’ Since we have to give a name to the country, which should be different from that of the ruling house, ‘Umayyad Caliphate’ is easy one.\n\nThe political history of the Rashidun Caliphate is predominantly a story of how Muslim Arabs conquered vast lands. On the other hand, the political history of the Umayyad Caliphate is predominantly how the Middle East changed profoundly. Let’s start!\n\nThe bloody First Arab Civil War left Mu’awiya the only candidate of caliphate in the field. When he entered Kufa triumphantly in July of 661 CE, everybody in the country pledged allegiance to him in without exception. , Neither anybody dared to oppose him nor did he deem it necessary to consult anybody.\n\nThe Muslim community was generally happy due to the end of the civil war. Their most dreaded fear of losing everything due to infighting was over. The ‘neutral party’ wrapped up their ‘wait and see’ attitude and joined hands with Shi’a Uthman without any hesitation. The Muslims called this year ‘Ām al jama’ah – the ‘year of unity’ (عام الجَمِيعَه). The group that formed as a result of the merger of Shi’a Uthman with a ‘neutral party’ is called “The Unity Party.” (ahl al jami’ah اهلَالجَمِيعَه). The merger took place everywhere in the country.\n\nMu’awiya takes oath\n\nHoyland observes that the change of power from Hasan to Mu’awiya would have been a continuation of the same political setup in the eyes of contemporary Muslims. Their illusion soon disappeared. Policy changes from the previous caliphate can be traced back to the time Mu’awiya took an oath of the caliph in September of 661 CE in a ceremony organized for the event. Instead of choosing Medina for this purpose, where all preceding caliphs had taken their oath, Mu’awiya preferred Jerusalem. A debate might have taken place on this issue among the close circles of Mu’awiya because the Maronite Chronicler, who is an eyewitness to the events, notes that Mu’awiya “placed his throne in Damascus and refused to go to Muḥammad’s throne.” One of the promises of Abdullah bin Zubayr, the principal challenger of the Umayyads in the 680s, was that he would place Mecca and Medina once more at the heart of the Arab Empire. Jerusalem already held a sacred status in the eyes of Muslims. They might have accepted it as a suitable alternative to Medina. , Mu’awiya officially adopted the title of Amir ul Mu’minin in this ceremony. He used to be called Amir before it.\n\nAn undated inscription about the construction of a dam near Medina has been discovered. It mentions the full official designation of Mu’awiya, which was ‘Abdullah Mu’awiya Amir ul Muminin’. A mawla of Abdullah bin Abbas was the builder and Kathīr bin al Ṣalt and Abu Musa were the overseers. The identification of the builder gives us a hint that the Banu Hashim were co-operating with the new government. Other documents also preserve the official designation of Mu’awiya. One of them is a 674 CE demand written on a papyrus, discovered from Naṣṣanna about 59 Km south of Beer-Sheba in Palestine.\n\nFirst dynasty in Islam\n\nWith the death of the Rashidun Caliphate, an important principle of early Islam died out. A new caliph of ummah must not necessarily be unrelated to the outgoing caliph. A peculiar characteristic of Umayyad Caliphate was the concentration of power within one family. Hawting calls Umayyad Caliphate the ‘first dynasty in Islam’. Actually, by the time of rise of Umayyad Caliphate, the dominance of Arabs in the Middle East was no longer a purely religious movement headed by a religious leader. It was a secular state governed by a ruler. Previously, the Islamic state was governed by four ‘leaders of the religion’ unrelated to each other. Now, the first three rulers of the dynasty were descendants of Abu Sufyan. After Mu’awiya bin Abu Sufyan (661 – 680 CE), his son Yazid bin Mu’awiya (Yazīd يَزِيد) ruled the country (680 – 683 CE). Yazid was followed by his son Mu’awiya (Mu’awiya II مُعاوىَه الثالِث) for a brief period (683 – 684 CE). These three rulers are generally called the Sufyanids. .\n\nAfter the death of Mu’awiya II, the power shifted to another branch of the Umayyah clan. First, Marwan bin Hakam ruled briefly (684 – 685 CE). He was succeeded by his son, Abdul Malik bin Marwan (‘Abd al Malik عَبدالمَلِك) (685 – 705 CE). Abdul Malik was himself succeeded by no fewer than four of his own sons, Walid, (Walīd I وَلِيد الاوّل) (705 – 715 CE), Sulayman (سُلَيمان) (715 – 717 CE), Yazid (Yazīd II, اثانياً يَزِيد) (720 – 724 CE) and Hisham (Hishām هِشام) (723 – 743 CE) up to 743 CE. Their rule was briefly interrupted by their paternal first cousin Umar bin Abdul Aziz (عُمَر بِن عَبدُ العَزِيز) (717 to 720 CE). Then, the power transferred to the third generation of Abdul Malik. Walid II, (743 to 744 CE) was son of Yazid bin Abdul Malik. Yazid III (يَزىِد الثالِث) (744 to 744 CE) and Ibrahim (اِبراهِىم) (744 to 744 CE) were the sons of Walid bin Abdul Malik. None of the third generationists could have a good grip on power. Marwan bin Muhammad, (Marwan II مَروان اثانِياُ) (744 to 750 CE) who had the sad honour of being the last ruler of Umayyad Caliphate, was a grandson of Abdul Malik. Abbasid Caliphate ousted the weak last ruler of Umayyad Caliphate.\n\nAs each government of Umayyad Caliphate differed slightly from the previous one, we shall discuss political developments during each government separately.\n\nMu’awiya consolidates central government writ\n\nAfter becoming the undisputed ruler of the country, Mu’awiya emerged as a statesman. He introduced such modifications that changed the character of an Islamic state forever. All modifications came gradually over the next twenty years of his tenure, the longest so far for any caliph.\n\nMu’awiya had inherited everything the Rashidun Caliphate had achieved – its vast area, its varied population, its revenue rich provinces, and its political jumble. A big task at hand for the new Caliph was to bring political stability and good governance in the country. Reining the unruly Ashraf in cantonments and preventing the prominent members of the Quraysh from making personality-based parties to compete for the seat of central ruler was the main goal of Mu’awiya during first decade of his tenure.\n\nMu’awiya didn’t want to deal with too many petty governors. Within a few months after coming to power, Mu’awiya aggregated management of Medina, Mecca and Taif in one unit called Hejaz and appointed Marwan bin Hakam as its governor. He continued this policy later on wherever possible.\n\nSyria and its dependencies did not have any politicial grouping during the Rashidun Caliphate. It still continued to be pro-government. Two important personalities of Syria had participated in the battle of Siffin from Mu’awiya’s side and had helped in propping him up as a caliph. They were Habib bin Maslamah and Abdur Rahman bin Khalid. As the years passed, Habib bin Maslamah died of natural causes in 661 CE. Mu’awiya remained apprehensive that Abdur Rahman bin Khalid could challenge his authority in Syria. Abdur Rahman had many credentials in his account. He was the son of the most decorated Muslim general. He had earned a reputation of being a brave soldier on his own merit by commanding routinely carried out raids against the Byzantine. The Syrians loved him. According to Tabari, Mu’awiya masterminded the cold blooded murder of Abdur Rahman bin Khalid by poisoning him in Homs around 666 CE. , , , , The two deaths secured Syria for Mu’awiya.\n\nThe brief governorship of Muhammad bin Abu Bakr in Egypt, characterized with mismanagement, had effectively uprooted Shi’a ‘Ali from the province. After Shi’a ‘Uthman came to power, the province and its dependencies remained pro-government. Amr bin As had asked Mu’awiya to appoint his son Abdullah bin Amr bin As as governor of Egypt after Amr’s death. Mu’awiya rejected the proposal tactfully. , . When Amr died on January 6, 664 CE, his son Abdullah bin Amr adopted the governorship of Egypt by default in an attempt to convert the province into a hereditary governate. , Mu’awiya tolerated him for two years while he was busy with other more demanding hot spots. Once Mu’awiya gained enough political stability in the country, he sent a dismissal notice to Abdullah bin As around 667 CE. Abdullah had to comply. Mu’awiya appointed a Shi’a Uthman by the name of Mu’awiya bin Hudaij (Mu’āwiyah bin Ḥudaij مُعاوِيه بِن حُديَج) in Abdullah’s stead. Thereafter, matters in Egypt ran smoothly throughout the time of the Umayyad Caliphate as far as the central government was concerned.\n\nThe two eastern provinces of the country, Kufa and Basrah, were the main battlegrounds of the First Arab Civil War. A political rift continued there and Mu’awiya had to tread tactfully to handle them.\n\nAfter the initial experimentations of the governors over Kufa, Mu’awiya appointed Mughira bin Shu’ba, an important ‘neutral’, as governor of Kufa and its dependencies, Azerbaijan and Tabaristan in October 661 CE. , ,\n\nMughira proved to be a successful governor and held his post until his death in September of 670 CE. Being a neutral, he did not have any difficulty in recognizing all the political groups of Kufa as equals and dealing them with a uniform policy. , ,\n\nWhen Hasan signed the abdication of Mu’awiya, Humran bin Aban (Ḥumrān bin Abān حُمران بِن ابان) had assumed the governorship of Basrah in Mu’awiya’s name. , Mu’awiya then sent Busr bin Artat to take over Basrah. He remained there for six months. Then, after due deliberations, Mu’awiya brought in Abdullah bin Amir as governor of Basrah and its dependencies of Sistan and Khorasan. , To the dismay of Mu’awiya, Abdullah bin Amir proved to be a weak governor for the turbulent province.\n\nMu’awiya started looking for a new face for his administration in Basrah. Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan (Ziyād bin Abīhī/Abū Sufyān زِياد بِن اَبِيهئ ابَو سَفيان) was the lieutenant governor of Fars for Ali when Mu’awiya gained power. . Ziyad was a prominent member of the neutral party and had not participated in the Battle of Camel or Siffin. Probably he did not expect the dismissal because of his neutrality. On the other hand, perhaps Mu’awiya sensed danger as he was the only member of Ali’s administration reknowned for his efficiency. Mu’awiya summoned him to Kufa (where Mu’awiya was for his triumph ceremony) to give an audit of revenues. Ziyad could smell the danger and refused flatly. Mu’awiya ordered the arrest of his sons in Basrah and threatened to kill them in case Ziyad didn’t comply. Ultimately, Abu Bakra and Mughira bin Shu’ba brokered a deal between them, according to which, Ziyad met Mu’awiya in Kufa, presented a report of his revenues, received an allowance from Mu’awiya to keep what he had accumulated during his governorship, and took a dismissal letter to settle in Basrah. When Mu’awiya decided to dump Abdullah bin Amir, Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan passed through his mind. Ziyad must have been annoyed with Mu’awiya because of the way the latter treated him a few months ago. To parley with him, Mu’awiya declared him the brother and son of Abu Sufyan. , , ,\n\nWhen Ziyad started twisting on Mu’awiya’s tunes, the latter dismissed Abdullah bin Amir by the end of 664 CE. , , Then Mu’awiya brought in Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan as governor of this vast and fussy province on July 6, 665 CE. , ,\n\nThis time, Ziyad took charge of the governorship in Basrah when there was open depravity in the town and in the province. During his introductory speech (khuṭbah), he made clear that the doves of Mu’awiya’s government had gone and the hawk had arrived. , .\n\nZiyad enforced a night time curfew in Basrah with orders to kill on sight any person who defies it. He arrested people on mere suspicions of a crime and introduced punishments which were never heard of during the Rashidun Caliphate. .\n\nZiyad’s strictness over people bore fruit. He could compel people to obey the government and could implement government prescribed punishments. After a while, Ziyad would proudly announce a government-backed insurance on all stolen goods in the province without the payment of any premiums. He advised people to fire their watchmen in the wake of a newly-announced insurance in the public sector on all goods. He could achieve a level of security in the town where women could sleep with their doors unlocked. People would not pick a valuable thing left unattended by somebody for fear of punishment.\n\nZiyad was aware that punishment serves as an exampler for a community. It is not an end in itself. His policy was not stick only. It was carrot and stick. He poured stipends on those who obeyed him loyally to create a group of government loyalists. At the same time, he organized projects for public good. He built provision depots in the whole of the town to demonstrate that the governor was interested in public welfare. , .\n\nMu’awiya had appointed Ziyad as the governor of Basrah and its dependencies, initially. Mu’awiya was so impressed with Ziyad’s capabilities that he added Bahrain, Oman and the frontier of Hind to the territory of Basrah.\n\nZiyad remained in the good books of Mu’awiya and when the governorship of Kufa had a vacant role due to death of Mughira bin Shu’ba in September of 670 CE, Mu’awiya appointed Ziyad as governor of Kufa. In doing this, Mu’awiya aggregated two important provinces of the country – Basrah and Kufa – in one administrative unit which was called Iraq. , ,\n\nZiyad repeated the same strategy in Kufa that he had gained mastery of during his governorship in Basrah with the same desired results. Tabari gives credit to Ziyad for being the “first in Mu’awiya’s tenure who secured the government’s business and hence secured the monarchy of Mu’awiya.” Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan continued to manage his ‘eastern province’ with highhandedness until his death in August 673 CE. , , ,\n\nThe situation in which the caliph manages Syria and Egypt and their dependencies, all of which were snatched from Byzantine Rome, and leaves the administration of the eastern part of the country, which consisted of the ex-Sasanian empire, into capable hands of a viceroy, arose for the first time during Mu’awiya’s tenure. Later on, it can be seen in the duo of Yazid and Ubaydullah bin Ziyad, and Abdul Malik and Hajjaj bin Yusuf.\n\nCentral government all powerful\n\nAfter achieving political stability in all the provinces, Mu’awiya felt confident in hiring and firing governors at his own whim. He never gave a reason to a governor while firing him and didn’t give a reason for raising someone to the status of governor. The government of the Umayyad Caliphate was no longer a team knit together by a common goal. It was a work group stuck together under boss-subordinate relations to accomplish the boss’s goal.\n\nGovernment’s administrative tools\n\nThe question is how did Mu’awiya successfully harness the restless provinces while his predecessors had bitterly failed to do so?\n\nMu’awiya had the courage to set religion aside and make practical changes in the administrative structure of the country. Many changes can be easily spotted. Mu’awiya’s predecessors did not have any troops at their personal disposal. They used their religious authority to govern the country. During the later years of the Rashidun Caliphate, Ashraf started disobeying the government by simply rejecting a government order because one of them did not perceive it to be in line with the teachings of Islam. It made the caliph’s religious authority controversial on which he completely banked to manage the country. Mu’awiya had come to power by showing off his ‘Syrian Troops’. He maintained their daunting reputation in the minds of his country fellows by keeping them away from perils of a war but threatening their possible use in case of disobedience. They became a force behind any order that came from caliph’s mouth. Sources don’t record a single occasion where Mu’awiya had to convince his subjects to obey his order because he had a religious authority over them. To assure the loyalty of his Syrian Troops towards the central government, Mu’awiya paid them much more lavishly than what he used pay to their provincial counterparts in Iraq. The Muslim Arabs of Syria were only one part of the Syrian Troops. This elite army comprised of all kind of elements. Many non-Muslim Arabs were recruited. Actually, people from as far as the Copts of Egypt were employed as Syrian Troops. Non-Muslim slaves were an essential part of the Syrian Troops. .\n\nThe basic troublemakers in cantonments were soldiers who kept only self interest in sight. Their demand for bigger salary and perks was insatiable. Ashraf, who had their own political ambitions and rivalries, utilized their position as an intermediary between the soldiers and provincial governors to play politics on the soldier’s behalf. During the last decade of the Rashidun Caliphate, the soldiers were out of any governmental control. They were armed and the caliph was totally unarmed. They could turn on the caliph anytime and it had happened to Uthman. Mu’awiya was aware of the issue. Restarting Futuhul Buldan was not in the interest of country in the face of internal crisis. Mu’awiya decided to start low impact border raids on all neighboring countries. The policy pushed the troublemaking soldiers out of cantonments and spread them out over lengthy borders. ,\n\nBorder raids definitely supplemented their income, changed their mindset from asking the government for handouts to generating for themselves, and reduced their numbers in cantonments and hence their precariousness for the government. Cantonments devoid of soldiers were easily manageable by the small but loyal Syrian Troops at Mu’awiya’s disposal.\n\nThe police (shurṭ) were very rudimentary in the Rashidun Caliphate. Mu’awiya established a well-trained police force in each provincial capital and put it at the disposal of its governor. The police were the force behind the orders of any governor. Many policemen were non-Arab Muslims. , Mu’awiya made sure that the provincial police force was not strong enough to defy his Syrian Troops if the confrontation arose and it was not weak enough that the authority of a governor was jeopardized. .\n\nThe tentacles of a successful government are its intelligence agencies. They keep the government aware of internal and external threats. The Rashidun Caliphate did not have any organized intelligence agency. Umayyad Caliphate organized basic ones. These services kept the threat level to the government low. Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan, for example, separated his intelligence department from the police and put Ja’d in charge of it. Ja’d’s function was to ‘deal with evil doers, and to pursue them’. .\n\nThe Ashraf and the soldiers received stipends as their religious right during the Rashidun Caliphate. They insisted that they had created it by participating in the jihad of Futuhul Buldan and government did not do any favour to them by distributing it to them after its collection. The Umayyad Caliphate was not bogged with theoretical rights, duties and privileges. The government had attained a physical means to impose its decisions. The Mu’awiya government derecognized the receiving of stipends as a religious right, rather it became a privilege. The government regularly withheld stipend from those who disobeyed the it and lavished it on those who obeyed the it. Once, Mu’awiya became angry with Abdur Rahman bin Hakam (the brother of Marwan bin Hakam), Mu’awiya’s staunch supporter. Mu’awiya withheld his stipend. On another occasion, Mughira bin Shu’ba withheld the stipends of Shi’a Ali in Kufa. On the same lines, Ziyad distributed five hundred of Basran Shaykhs among his companions and provided them with three hundred to five hundred dirhams each by his own discretion. .\n\nThe Ashraf no longer remained as a mere intermediary between the government and the soldiers. During the Rashidun Caliphate their main duty was to make sure that stipends were distributed in a smooth fashion and in a justified quantity to the group they administered. The Mu’awiya government not only insisted on obedience on the part of a Sharif in order to remain in office, it also expected from him to assure the obedience of his subordinate tribesmen and soldiers to the government. The Ashraf working in this capacity were called ‘Ārif.\n\nThe pre-Islamic Arab tribal society believed in the principle of talio, which had lingered on. Violence against law-enforcing personnel was common as retaliation to their violent actions committed on behalf of the state. No government can work if it does not give physical protection to its employees. Mu’awiya outlawed any retaliatory action against his officials. .\n\nIn a nutshell, Mu’awiya gradually introduced all the administrative interventions that the governor’s conference had pondered upon during last days of Uthman’s tenure but Uthman had rejected them.\n\nMu’awiya was a genius of management. He created many new departments in the central government with someone in charge for each of them. Tabari credits him to be the first one to create a department of seal with a designated in charge of the department. . Khalifa gives details of all central government departments in Mu’awiya government. The Mu’awiya government continued the tradition of the Rashidun Caliphate of appointing a chief secretary who was responsible for all governmental business.\n\nSupport to Arab Nationalism\n\nMu’awiya not only changed the administrative structure of the country, he tried to broaden the official ideology on which the country was based. During the Rashidun Caliphate, the basic classification of the masses was between Muslims and non-Muslims. While maintaining it, the Mu’awiya government started patronizing Arab Nationalism. His government hired scholars to write down the history of pre-Islamic Arab kings. History gives a group much needed reasons for belonging to that group. It was a preliminary attempt to reclassify the masses in Arabs and non-Arabs. Arabs would have included Christian tribes of Syria and other places. Non-Arabs would have included those Iranians and Turks who had adopted Islam.\n\nRadif disintegrate completely\n\nThe process of disintegration of Radif as a distinct socio-political group and their merger into the broader Arab Muslim elites had started during the First Arab Civil War. One of the leaders of the rebels against Uthman hailed from the Radif tribe of Hanifa. During Mu’awiya’s caliphate, Radif and Ahl al Ayam merged seamlessly. We observe members of ex-Radif tribes being appointed to higher government offices like lieutenant governors. The exact details of the merger are not known. Probably, the attraction was from both sides. When Quraysh and Ahl al Ayam fought among themselves in the First Arab Civil War, the warring groups needed more hands. Radif were welcome to join them. On their part, Radif had realized that even by organizing themselves in a socio-political group, they cannot compel the powerful Ahl al Ayam to share their wealth with them. They found the First Arab Civil War as an advantageous opportunity when Ahl al Ayam were willing to accept them in their elite group. This is an example how a socio-political group disappears once it doesn’t find any reason for lingering on.\n\nNovel punishments\n\nOne of the reasons for the decline of the Rashidun Caliphate was a reluctance on the part of the caliph to punish Arab Muslim elites for disobeying the government. Actually, there was a debate in government circles if a Caliph of Muslims had a legal right to kill Muslim political miscreants or not. Similar concepts might have lingered on during the early phase of Mu’awiya’s government. It explains the reluctance to pressurize the people of Kufa on the part of Mughira bin Shu’ba. Later on, the Umayyad Caliphate started devising new kinds of punishments which actually spared the life of the disobedient but insulted them head to heal. Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan was the mastermind behind these punishments. Once, the governor gave a laxative to a loose-talking poet with political inclinations and mounted him on a donkey. When the donkey passed through the alleys of Basrah with him on top of it, defecating in his clothes, he became a laughing stock. A non-Muslim Persian of the town could not help controlling his laughter at the sight and shouted to the poet “een cheest? (What is this?)”. “Resin juice for you,” the irritated poet answered. .\n\nSome people pelted stones at Ziyad when he reached Kufa and delivered his first introductory speech in the grand mosque. The action started when he praised the people of Kufa for being truth loving so he had come only with his family rather than with two thousand policemen from Basrah. Ziyad tactfully screened the culprits out of the gathering and had their hands amputated on the spot. , Later on, the amputation of hands became a standard punishment for throwing pebbles at a governor during his speech.\n\nNew punishments were not limited to the physical ones. Examples of the imposition of heavy fine for a crime are present. .\n\nSecurity of dignitaries\n\nOne aspect in which the Umayyad Caliphate diverged away from the practices of the Rashidun Caliphate was regarding the security arrangements of political dignitaries. It was a need of the time. After the murder of Uthman, the Muslim ummah never agreed on a single caliph. Groups of political dissidents always survived in the society who considered the killing of the sitting caliph or his appointees a pious duty.\n\nMu’awiya was the first to make use of bodyguards (Ḥaras). The contingent of Mu’awiya’s personal bodyguards had a proper captain. They manned the gates of Mu’awiya’s residence all the time. His governors followed the example. Marwan bin Hakam, Mu’awiya’s governor over Medina, made a maqsurah in the mosque of the Prophet. Mu’awiya followed him. The Umayyad Caliphate used guards to protect public places as well. Ziyad recruited five hundred guards and stationed them to protect the grand mosque of Kufa under a properly appointed captain.\n\nCriteria for a government job\n\nCompanions of the Prophet had attained special reverence by the middle of the Rashidun Caliphate when Umar had devised a policy that ideally there should not be a situation whereby a Companion of the Prophet is subject to the authority of a non-Companion. The principle faded during the later years of the Rashidun Caliphate when the rulers realized that competence to meet the demands of a job is more important than being pious. This principle was defunct during Mu’awiya’s tenure. Neither tribal affiliation nor piety or close relationship with the caliph were required qualifications to be a governor or a general during the early years of the Umayyad Caliphate. The only criteria were proficiency and loyalty to the caliph. Mu’awiyah bin Hudaij was known to possess leadership skills and he was loyal to Mu’awiya. Mu’awiya appointed him governor over the important province of Egypt while Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr, a Companion of the Prophet, a was resident of Alexandria. Mu’awiya also appointed Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan as governor over Basrah. He did not have any verifiable tribal affiliations but was known to be capable.\n\nCompanions of the Prophet lost political significance but they retained their religious reverence. If they were appointed to a government post, usually a lower one, they were acknowledged as being a Companion of the Prophet though a notice.\n\nHowever, the governors used the religious reverence of the Companions of the Prophet in the eyes of the common people for the advantage of the government. When Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan planned to eliminate crime from Basrah he appointed a Companion of the Prophet as judge in Basrah.\n\nMu’awiya’s advisors\n\nMu’awiya took a U-turn from the practices of the Rashidun Caliphate as far as consultation with peers was concerned. We don’t hear of a single personality who regularly advised Mu’awiya. He definitely took inputs but decided independently. He kept a close connection with the Ashraf and used to invite all of the Ashraf of a given province in the form of a delegate to Damascus to meet him in person. Usually the governor of the respective province was present at the occasion. In 679 CE, for example, the governor of Basrah, Ubaydullah bin Ziyad, met Mu’awiya with the notables of Basrah. Mu’awiya had created a hierarchy among Ashraf and used to see them one on one, the senior most first. He never seated them in one gathering. His body language during such meetings conveyed a message to them that he was superior to them. He used to sit on a high dice during such meetings. ,\n\nWhat happened to the Kharijis?\n\nThe Kharijis were an important factor for internal instability during last years of the Rashidun Caliphate. They had a pivotal role in bringing down Ali’s government. Ali, on his part, had taken a principled decision about them. He had allowed them to keep their ideology as far as they obeyed the government but they were liable to the death penalty if they revolted against the government. Shi’a Ali hated them from bottom of their heart and Mu’awiya knew it.\n\nWhen Mu’awiya camped at Nukhayla outside Kufa waiting for a ceremony to be organized for his triumphant entry in the town, a band of about five hundred Kharijis attacked Kufa. This time, the reason of their terrorist attack was to register their disagreement with Mu’awiya’s rule. Initially, Mu’awiya sent his Syrian Troops to tackle them but they were defeated. Mu’awiya aptly conveyed to the Kufans that the Kharijis were their menace and they had to sort it out. If Kufans didn’t do anything about it, they shouldn’t expect their government to whip the Kharijis into shape for them. Mu’awiya’s government upheld this principal throughout its life.\n\nBefore we dig into further developments of issue of the Kharijis during Mu’awiya’s tenure, let’s acquaint ourselves with an important pattern of any human society.\n\nIf we measure any human trait in a given population and plot its distribution on a graph we get a bell shaped curve. Let’s take an example of one trait that is easy to measure accurately. The graph in figure I represents the distribution of the men’s height in a given population. Very few males are absolutely short. They take a place at the extreme left end of the curve. Similarly, very few are absolutely tall. They get a place on the extreme right end of the curve. The vast majority of men, who are neither short nor tall, find their place in the middle, swelling the curve upwards in the center. The average height of majority imparts the curve its bell shape. Let’s take another example of another trait, which is slightly more difficult to measure objectively. The graph in figure II represents a distribution curve of human intelligence measured in I.Q. Again, we see that a few people are on the right and left margins of the curve, being highly intelligent and highly unintelligent respectively. The great majority of humans find their place in the middle and they possess average intelligence. Again, the average intelligence of majority gives the curve its bell shape. Religiosity is also a human trait. It cannot be measured precisely as it is a deeply subjective feeling. If one day we succeed in measuring distribution of religiosity in a given society accurately, presumably its graph will be bell shaped like curves of other human traits. A small number of people would find their place on extremes, extremely religious on one end and extremely anti-religious (atheists) on the other end. The great majority of people would fit in the middle. Who are these people? They can be conveniently called ‘secular’. Secular are the people who uphold both religion and worldly pursuits simultaneously. They know how to keep both separate. They also know how to concentrate on one of them at different occasions.\n\nLike all times and all societies, the Muslim society of the Umayyad Caliphate had a range of religious behaviours. On one extreme there were people, albeit few, who did not believe in any religion. Their purpose of life was to strive for their physical needs. On the other extreme there were people, again few, who did not pay heed to any worldly need. The purpose of their life was to strive for their spiritual needs. The overwhelming majority was neither atheist nor religios. They were just living their life. They wholeheartedly strived for their physical needs and at the same time sought spiritual strength from religion. We meet with all three kinds of characters among the Muslim society of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\nThe Kharijis were religious fanatics. By definition, extremists are few. Hence, the Kharijis remained few in number. They had typical political ideology. Here is an excerpt from the speech of Ḥayyān bin Ẓabyān, a Khariji leader, who made it in 662 CE in front of his companions in Rayy delineating Khariji political agenda: let us be off [for jihad], may Allah have mercy upon you, to our city (miṣr, here he means Kufa). Let us join our brothers and summon them to commanding good and forbidding evil (amr bil ma’rūf wal nahi ‘unil munkar) and to jihad against the factions. For we have no excuse for being inactive while our rulers are oppressive, and while Sunnah is abandoned and our vengeance remains unexecuted against those who killed our brothers in the majālis at Naharawan.\n\nThe Kharijis changed meaning of Jihad in Islam. It was no longer fighting against non-Muslims. The Kharijis preached fighting against their fellow Muslims, because they had abandoned Islam, according to the Khariji dictionary. They used to call non-Khariji Muslims ‘ahl al qiblah’ – meaning nominal Muslims. The Khariji leaders regularly adopted title of Abdullah, Amir ul Mu’minin though the followers of this Amir ul Mu’minin could be as few as three hundred in whole country. .\n\nTheir religio-political thoughts were well known to the people. They canvassed that only reign of Abu Bakr and Umar was just. Both Uthman and Ali were tyrants and they introduced innovations in Islam. The current Mu’awiya government was also tyrannical in the eyes of the Kharijis because it had diverted from true path of Islam by monopolizing use of fay and by failing to apply ḥudūd sentences appropriately. The war against such a government and its supporters was just. , Still, the general public never was convinced that they were an ideal alternative to the current political set up. A repeated scenario of Khariji exasperation during Mu’awiya’s tenure was that one person gets attached to Khariji ideology, mostly in Kufa, sometimes in Basra. He gathers a clique of handful supporters. They abscond to an area where government control was weak, such as ex-Sassanian territories indirectly administered by Umayyad Caliphate, Rayy or Khuzestan. There they trained themselves in warfare and then made a surprise suicide attack on either Kufa or Basrah. The purpose of the attack was to inflict as much damage as possible until their death at the hand of law enforcing agencies or civilian vigilante. , .\n\nThe government strategy to deal with them was two pronged. One, it unleashed its intelligence agencies on them. The intelligence agencies were capable of detecting small groups of Kharijis in Kufa or Basrah when they were in hatching. The provincial police could then bust up their rings and arrest them to be imprisoned. Second, the government facilitated the establishment of vigilante groups of citizens in Kufa and Basrah whose duty was to kill the Kharijis in case of a surprise attack on their communities. Shi’a Ali were the most enthusiastic members of such vigilante groups. .\n\nThe Kharijis could spread harassment in Kufa and Basrah during Mu’awiya’s tenure but they never became a threat to the governance of these provinces. Their number never increased more than three hundred on one occasion. The central government didn’t bother to even issue a statement against them. The last Khariji terrorist attack during Mu’awiya’s tenure is reported as occurring on October 674 CE. However, the government could not eradicate the Khariji ideology from the society. As they say, the government’s use of violence can kill people not ideology.\n\nShi’a Ali and the Mu’awiya government\n\nIt was not the Kharijis who gave tension to Mu’awiya. It was the Shi’a Ali who were on his mind. He took their opposition seriously. All of the Banu Hashim, including Husayn, Hasan, Abdullah bin Ja’ffar and Abdullah bin Abbas had pledged allegiance to Mu’awiya. Still, Mu’awiya didn’t extend a hand of friendship towards them. He made very sure that none of the Banu Hashim got any appointment in his government, even at the lowest level.\n\nFrom the very beginning of his government, Mu’awiya banned the public expression of superiority of Ali over Uthman in his domain, though his government had to tolerate such expressions in private. He also ordered his officials to advertise Ali’s faults to the public. He purged the Shi’a Ali using the excuse of revenge of the murder of Uthman wherever possible. For example, in 662 CE he sent his dreadful field commander Busr bin Artat to Medina, Mecca and Yemen. Busr investigated and killed some citizens who were allegedly involved in murder of Uthman. ,\n\nShi’a Ali had definitely shrinked in size during the later years of Ali’s tenure due to the deteriorating law and order situation in the country. They, anyhow, did not disappear from the political field of the country. Rather they gradually increased in number during Mu’awiya’s reign. At one stage, during Mughira bin Shu’ba’s governorship in Kufa, two-thirds of the Kufan population were Shi’a Ali. They did not show any political activism for a while and remained dormant.\n\nThe Shi’a Ali were scattered all over the country but a large number of them had concentrated in Kufa. In the beginning of Mu’awiya’s government, they co-operated with the government in governing the country. They, for example, participated in vigilante groups to eradicate the Kharijis. As years passed, they started showing passive resistance. They never challenged the authority of the central government but used to irritate Mughira bin Shu’ba, the governor of Kufa on regular basis. Hujr bin Adi (Ḥujr bin ‘Adi حَجر بِن عَدى) of the Kindah tribe was foremost in these activities. , When Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan took charge of the governorship of Kufa in September of 670 CE, some miscreants threw pebbles on him in the grand mosque of Kufa where they had gathered to listen to his introductory speech. That time, the government decided to crack down on the Shi’a Ali of the town.\n\nZiyad swiftly unleashed his police over them, dug out their ring leaders, arrested them and sent them for their final trial in ‘Adhra’ in Syria. Ziyad recorded the statements of about seventy witnesses implicating them in expressing pro-Ali views, assembling people around them and instigating them to rebel against the government. In the sham court trial whose judge was Mu’awiya himself, all of them pleaded not guilty. They reiterated their loyalty towards the government. In this scenario, the charges of instigating people to rebel against the government didn’t stand. Rather, the court insisted on them denouncing their pro-Ali views publicly to be acquitted. None of them did so. The court handed over a range of punishments on them. Seven of them were exiled away from Kufa. Six of them, including Hujr bin Adi, were executed by a single stroke of sword after their graves were dug in front of their eyes and the shrouds put nearby. One of them was executed by burying alive. ‘Amr bin Ḥamiq escaped from Kufa during the government crackdown campaign. He got caught in Mosul where he was executed on the orders of Mu’awiya for murdering Uthman. , ,\n\nThe description of the trial by Tabari unveils a very important precept. The Shi’a Ali did not mind expressing loyalty towards the government of Mu’awiya, which was their political stand. However, they preferred death to denouncing the superiority of Ali over Uthman. It was their moral stand. The Shi’a Ali was no longer a purely political party. It had started changing into a faith-based sect.\n\nShi’a Ali never revolted openly against the Mu’awiya government. However, they maintained their political identity and kept presenting themselves to malcontent portions of masses as an alternate political set up. They kept producing propaganda material which would have disseminated secretly. Here is a piece. Hind bint Ziyad bin Makhramah of Ansar lamented Hujr’s death:\n\nO Ḥujr, Ḥujr of Banū ‘Adi\n\nMay safety and happiness receive you.\n\nI fear for you what destroyed ‘Adi\n\nWhile an old man is roaring in Damascus\n\nHe thinks killing the best is all right for him\n\nWho has a wazīr from the worst people.\n\nConstitutional reforms of Mu’awiya\n\nMu’awiya’s concept of a ruler was different from all those who ruled the Islamic state before him. He used to express it when he was not even the governor of Damascus. When Umar came to Syria on an official visit and Mu’awiya had to pay him a courtesy call as a field commander, he came in form of a pompous procession. At Umar’s objection, he justified that opponents of the Rashidun Caliphate must know that its officials were powerful. On assuming caliphate Mu’awiya made far reaching changes in the personal appearance, constitutional role and legal powers of a caliph.\n\n“Then came Mu’awiya bin Abu Sufyan,” reports Ya’qubi, “He built palaces, ……. he acquired guards, acquired a police force (shurṭah), established chamberlains.[ḥujjāb, its sin. is ḥājib – a person whose duty was to screen people so only few could see a ruler], and built ruler’s compartments (maqṣūrah) in mosques. He rode good-looking mounts and padded saddles. He wore silk and brocade.” “Mu’awiyah was the first in Islam to institute …. gate-keepers [bawwābūn. pl. of bawwāb]; to drape-curtains [sitr, pl. sutūr; to conceal the caliph from the gaze of visitors]; and to have men walk in front of him with lances. He was the first to ….. sit on a throne (sarīr) with the people below him,” Ya’qubi continues. Mu’awiya never formally announced that he had different rights and privileges from those of his predecessor caliphs. His body language showed that he had transformed the office of a caliph. The caliph no longer remained primus inter pares. He became a superior comparari pares.\n\nThe change in the get-up and the role of a caliph was not by coincidence. It was a well-conceived strategy. Mu’awiya is the first ruler in Islam whose name appears on monuments and coins. It gives Jeremy a clue that Mu’awiya had ‘royal ambitions’ from the beginning of his rule.\n\nThe adoption of an authorative posture by Caliph Mu’awiya in the private and public domains must have helped the Umayyad Caliphate in the proper management of the country, which was at the brink of collapse when Mu’awiya assumed power. However, it came at a cost. Mu’awiya’s opponents found an angle for political criticism in it. They started calling him a ‘king.’ “Mu’awiya is king of the Holy Land and so is his son,” satires Abdullah bin Amr bin As, after his deposition as governor of Egypt at the hands of Mu’awiya. The criticism was not merely about the title of the ruler. It was about the role of a ruler of the Islamic state. The Muslim Arab’s political mind had a sharp distinction between a caliph and a king. A caliph, whose complete title was khalifah al rasūl Allah during the Rashidun Caliphate, was simply a successor of the mission of Prophet Muhammad. His sole motivation should have been promotion of Islam and Muslim interests. Being a caliph was a responsibility. A king, like qaysar or kisra, was simply administrator of any country. His sole motivation was maintenance of law and order. Being a king was a benefit. A caliph must be humbled by the responsibility he had, a king must be proud of the status he achieved. The criticism lingered on after the death of Mu’awiya. Later Muslim scholars were unanimous that whereas the caliphs of Medina had ministered to their subjects in fairness and piety, Mu’awiya had transformed this just rule into dynastic and autocratic dominion after the fashion of the Byzantine and Persian emperors. .\n\nA point to note is that Mu’awiya himself never claimed to be a king. “Mu’awiya did not wear a crown like other kings in the world,” observes a contemporary Chrisitian, the anonymous writer of the Maronite Chronicle. His reputation, however, persisted as a king. “Mu’awiya was the first ‘king’ in Islam and he converted caliphate into kingship,” writes Hawting. Abdallah bin Khalifa was a political exile and a Shi’a Ali sympathizer during Mu’awiya’s reign. Lamenting the execution of Hujr, he referred to Mu’awiya:\n\nSo, O Ḥujr, who will bleed the throats of the horses [meaning lead them in battle]\n\nAnd of the aggressive king whenever he acts unjustly.\n\nMu’awiya’s other constitutional reform was distancing the caliph’s office from the religious affairs of Islam. Mu’awiya was a Companion of the Prophet and so was his scribe. If he wished he could use his good relationship with Prophet Muhammad as an excuse to continue to act as director of religious affairs as his predessesor caliphs had been. He separated the institution of caliph from day to day business of religion. Let’s take up a case study. Prophet Muhammad had determined the boundaries of Haram around Ka’ba. They were marked by pillars (anṣāb) on all the roads entering Mecca. The pillars used to get blurred now and then due to the desert conditions. The sitting caliph had to reconfirm the boundaries before their renovation, as the caliph was expected to be the supreme authority in religious matters. When the time of renovation came during Mu’awiya’s tenure he did not bother to determine the location of the pillars himself. He rather ordered a common Meccan, Kurz bin ‘Alqamah of the Khuza’ah tribe, to figure out where exactly these pillars should be installed.\n\nWe don’t find a single example throughout the reign of Mu’awiya where the caliph reminded people of their religious duties. Nor we hear of any episode in which the caliph claimed that he had heard a certain thing from the Prophet, or presented a quote from the Qur’an to reinforce his arguments. Caliph Mu’awiya never acted as a judge in bickering over religious matters of Islam. Perhaps Mu’awiya had learned from the woes of Ali who emphasized too much on religious role of the caliph and submersed into a morass of religious controversies.\n\nIn theory the caliph remained the supreme spiritual leader of Muslims but practically religious scholars took over this role.\n\nFinally, Mu’awiya dismantled the political doctrine of the Rashidun Caliphate that a person must be a pioneer in Islam to qualify as caliph to the Prophet. Instead, he introduced a new concept that it is Allah Himself who picks the rulers and whoever Allah wishes, choses. It is the duty of masses to obey him with words and deeds instead of pondering over his affiliation to Islam or his nearness to the Prophet. Extending on this principle, the title of khalifa rasul Allah started changing into Khalifa Allah during Mu’awiya’s tenure. The phrase simply meant that a Khalifa is directly appointed by Allah. People used to call Mu’awiya ‘khalifa Allah’, especially when they had to accolade him to get a benefit. Mu’awiya never corrected their grammar. Such changes in the title of Khalifa might have gone through easily because a lot of grass root level administrators who were still non-Muslims didn’t appreciate the terminology of the ruling Arab Muslims.\n\nAll of the constitutional reforms of Mu’awiya were destined to last longer than his life. Resultantly, Islam split into two streams. One stream was the Islamic state and its caliph. Like any other state, its sole function became to administrate the country and strive for the political stability and prosperity of its people. The other stream was the preservation and spread of Islam. Religious scholars became skippers in that stream. .\n\nGenial relations with non-Muslims\n\nOnce the turbulence of Futuhul Buldan was over, the Rashidun Caliphate had started building a bridge between the ruler of the state and the non-Muslim subjects. There was a realization that they were the back bone of the economy and the main tax payers in the country. If they revolted successfully, the Arab Muslim elite would have to abandon the comfortable garrision towns and flee to their pasturelands in Arabian Peninsula. Mu’awiya comprehended it more than his predecessors. His power base was Syria, which was the bastion of staunch Christianity. He could hardly afford a discontent population in his own province.\n\nMu’awiya had chemistry with his Christian subjects. The intimacy had started when Mu’awiya was governor of Damascus during the Rashidun Caliphate. When Uthman sent the ten political dissidents to Damascus, Mu’awiya had no trouble in lodging them in a church with the consent of local Christians. From day one of his tenure as a caliph, Mu’awiya started creating an impression that the caliph was caretaker of all religious groups of the country, including Muslims and Christians. After taking the oath of his office in Jerusalem, Mu’awiya went to the sacred Christian sites in Jerusalem to pray there. The gesture would have worked as a confidence building measure.\n\nMu’awiya knew that the Christians were divided in denominations. Members of one denomination hated the other one more than they hated members of other religions. Mu’awiya took full advantage. One incident recorded by the anonymous chronicler of Maronite denomination provides evidence. The Maronite and Jacobites had a religious disputation in the capital Damascus in June of 659 CE with Mu’awiya acting as a judge between them. Mu’awiya judged the Jacobites to be defeated. He ordered the bishop of Jocobites to keep quiet in future and to pay twenty thousand dinars annually to Mu’awiya as a cost of protecting the Jacobites from attacks of other denominations. Mu’awiya had not only created a permanent source of income for his government through the debate, he also won the favour of Maronites.\n\nMu’awiya looked after the interests of Christians of Syria throughout his tenure. Over time, the Muslim community of Damascus greatly increased in numbers and there was a dire need to extend the grand mosque of Damascus. Mu’awiya announced that his government would extend the mosque by annexing the cathedral of Saint John. Christians objected to the plans. Mu’awiya didn’t offend his Christian subjects, rather he withdrew the plan. ,\n\nYa’qubi asserts that Mu’awiya was the first ruler in Islam to appoint Christians to the highest bureaucratic post of a central government secretary. Most rekowned of them was Sarjūn (Sergius), the finance secretery. One might argue that Sarjun was already a bureaucrat in the Byzantine Roman setup and the Rashidun Caliphate retained the services of Roman bureaucracy, just like they did with the Sasanians. Yet, we can spot new Christian faces in Mu’awiya’s bureaucracy. Mu’awiya’s tax collector at Homs was Uthāl, a Christian by faith. The re-use of the bureaucratic apparatus of pre-existing states was a norm from the Rashidun Caliphate times. Creating new bureaucrats from Christians was not a precedent.\n\nMu’awiya’s pro-Christian policies must have borne fruit for the Umayyad Caliphate. The Umayyad Caliphate enjoyed more political stability in Christian dominated provinces of the country, like Syria, Jazira, and Egypt throughout its life.\n\nReligious tolerance under the Umayyad Caliphate\n\n“Justice flourished under his reign, and a great peace was established in the countries that were under his government, and allowed everyone to live as they wished,” are the words of John bar Penkaye, a contomprary Christian who compiled a chronicle around 688 CE. The early Islamic practice of allowing non-Muslim subjects the right to live according to their own customs and laws seems a continuation of the Sasanid institution of the semi-independent religious communities. In general, it was in the Muslim’s own interest to maintain the conquered communities intact, insofar as they provided a stable economic base for the nascent Muslim empire. Not surprisingly, this tolerance is nowhere more noticeable than in the former Sasanid territory itself, among the subjugated Zoroastrian community. In a comparative study of both pre- and post-conquest Zoroastrian legal texts, Bodil Hjerrild is able to conclude that 1) Zoroastrians were not persecuted under Arab rule, and 2) new legal texts, applicable to all within the community, continued to be complied into the tenth century CE at least; and no greater indication of the degree of this tolerance is to be found than the continuation – encouragement, even – of a practice which offends a very ancient Semitic principle and undoubtedly seemed abhorrent to Arab Muslims: the Zoroastrian custom of marriage within the forbidden degrees. .\n\nThough the Umayyad Caliphate upheld the tradition of religious tolerance already being practiced during the Rashidun Caliphate, anecdotes of intolerance can be found in history books. For example, in 770 CE Ubaydullah bin Abi Bakra, the lieutenant governor of Sistan ordered to execute the hirbidhs (Zoroastrian priests) and to extinguish all the ritual fires in Sistan. Since such episodes are rarely mentioned in historical texts, one can assume that it might have resulted from local inter-religious tensions, and was not a stated government policy.\n\nWorth noting is that we don’t find any evidence of efforts on the part of the government or Arab Muslim elites to appease Zoroastrians. As far as Zoroastrians were concerned, the Umayyad Caliphate was totally neutral.\n\nPro-Muslim policies of Mu’awiya\n\nMu’awiya’s gestures of goodwill towards Christians were to neutralize their negativism towards Muslim rule. Mu’awiya never intended to prop them up as his power base. His power base always remained the Arab Muslim elite, especially the Ashraf. Whenever Mu’awiya got a chance, he used gimmicks to impress his Muslim subjects. The Umayyad Caliphate was still using Byzantine Dinars as its currency. According to the anonymous Maronite chronicler, Mu’awiya removed the Christian symbol of cross from the coins. It might be true. Archaeologists are aware of at least three coins up to now, which are in line with the statement of the anonymous Maronite chronicler. The experiment, however, didn’t go well and Mu’awiya had to revert to the old design. The anonymous Maronite chronicler tells the inner story – the new currency was not acceptable to the Christians. , .\n\nIn 670 CE Mu’awiya ordered the pulpit of the Prophet and his staff to be removed from Syria. He was in Medina on his way to pilgrimage. He inspected the staff that was in possession of Sa’d al Qaraz (The pulpit was still in the mosque). Mu’awiya argued that the pulpit should not be left in Medina, where the enemies and murderers of Uthman were present. Abu Huraira and Jābir bin Abdullah pleaded to Mu’awiya not to remove the pulpit on the grounds that the Prophet had left it in the mosque. They asked, “Will you remove the mosque as well?” While arguments were going on there was a complete solar eclipse. Probably people took a bad omen from it. Mu’awiya changed his stance and said that he just wanted to bring to attention the condition of the pulpit, which was worm sticken. He refrained from removing the pulpit, rather added six steps to it. As a result the pulpit had eight steps at the time of writing of Tabari. Mu’awiya apologized to people for what he had wished. It is still not clear what was Mu’awiya’s actual agenda in removing the pulpit from Medina to Syria. Many scholars assume that he intended to place it in Jerusalem to further enhance the prestige of the town.\n\nMu’awiya was not neglecting the Ka’ba at expense of Jerusalem, anyhow. He was the first caliph who covered the Ka’ba with brocade (dībāj) and brought slaves to serve it. As the country’s law prohibited keeping a Muslim in slavery, it can be safely assumed that the slaves serving the Ka’ba for menial jobs were non-Muslims.\n\nSoldiers vs generals vs central government\n\nThe formula for the division of booty between the soldiers, the commanding generals and the central government changed fundamentally during the Mu’awiya government.\n\nThe issue of larger remuneration for the general as compared to ordinary soldiers settled in favour of generals. When a military force raided Ifriqiya under command of Mu’awiya bin Hudayj in 670 CE, Mu’awiya bin Hudayj set aside one fifth of booty as central government share. He gave only half of the remaining booty to the soldiers. One can assume that the general kept the remaining half in his pocket.\n\nAs the Umayyad Caliphate was not pursuing a policy of border expansion during its first three decades, it was less dependent upon soldiers who were willing to cross borders into other countries. The soldiers, on the other hand were desperate to supplement their income with booty. In this background, the one fifth share of the central government no longer remained fixed. It became flexible and negotiable. Take a note of two events.\n\nḤakam bin ‘Amr, a lieutenant governor of Khorasan, raided a Turkish community sometime around 670 CE. He collected a lot of booty which included felts and vessels made up of gold and silver and other precious objects. The Caliph Mu’awiya demanded that all the vessels made up of gold and silver and other precious objects should be delivered to the central government without delay. Hakam neglected the orders, arguing that the caliph’s orders cannot supersede the Qur’an which clearly prescribed one fifth share for the central government. He sent one-fifth to the central government and distributed the remaining equally among his soldiers. His immediate supervisor, Ziyad bin Abihi/Abu Sufyan, the governor of Basrah, got so angry with Hakam that he vowed to behead him. It was Hakam’s good luck that he died naturally before Ziyad could fulfill his vow.\n\nIn 680 CE ‘Amr bin Mu’awiya, a field commander of the Syrian contingent, returned from a summer campaign against Byzantine. Caliph Mu’awiya asked him how much the khums amounted to. He informed him, and Mu’awiya asked where it was? ‘Amr said “You are asking me about the khums, while I see one of the emigrants walking on foot. Shouldn’t I give him a mount?” Mu’awiya said, “He will not get it as long as I live.” ‘Amr said, “Then I don’t care!” and recited:\n\nThe Quraysh in Damascus are given my booty,\n\nWhile I abandon my friends. That is unjust.\n\nI am not an amīr who accumulates money like a merchant,\n\nAnd I do not seek a long amirate with miserliness.\n\nSo if the shaykh of Damascus withholds his wealth, fine;\n\nBut I do not wish to lock up my wealth. .\n\nThe moral of the story: Sometimes the center demanded more than one-fifth of the booty and the commander refused. Other times, the center demanded at least one fifth, and the commander slipped out with money.\n\nThe central government’s share of the booty was still called a ‘fifth’ though it was no longer exactly 20%.\n\nThe share of the booty of the cavalry remained double that of the infantry.\n\nRemunerations of governors\n\nThe governors and lieutenant governors had to work for a basic salary during the Rashidun Caliphate. They routinely stole from the tax money to supplement their income. The caliph, in his part, routinely used to audit the governor and lieutenant governor, confiscate the illegally acquired wealth, and punish the governor or lieutenant governor by dismissal. The practice developed a clash of interest between caliph and governors. Instead of doing his job perfectly, the governor concentrated on hiding his wealth and avoiding audit. By auditing a governor, the caliph tarnished the image of his governor in eyes of the very people on whom he was expected to govern.\n\nMu’awiya changed it all. The salaries of governors and lieutenant governors increased in recognition of their services. The salary of Ziyad was twenty-five thousand dirhams annually while that of junior government officers was one thousand dirhams annually. On top of salary the governors and top government officials, received commission for their work. They regularly pocketed some amount of the tax that they collected. The central government never audited them during their tenure. At the time of their dismissal or death, the central government asked for audit. At that time, the central government determined rate of their commission. The governor, or his family in case of his death, could either keep whole amount he had accumulated or half of it. Probably, the rate of commission depended upon the way a governor managed his domain, and the way he kept the caliph satisfied. In this method, the governor did not have to steal. His public image never shattered. His whole mind focused on his performance and to be in good books of the caliph. Mu’awiya didn’t want to leave an impression that he was confiscating wealth of his governors at the end of their tenures just as a grudge against them. Rather, it was the fiscal policy to run the Umayyad Caliphate properly. Commission-based remuneration didn’t mean the central government had given the governors a free hand to rack up whatever they wished. They were given a tight target of tax revenue collection that was based upon a figure calculated by the auditors of the central government specifically assigned for that particular province. They were not allowed to increase the tax rate because it carried political risks.\n\nThis arrangement of commission based remuneration of governors imparted the governors a capacity to pay those subordinates lavishly who obediently served their interest. Ziyad bin Abihi/Sufyan granted ‘Ubayd bin Ka’b of the Numayr tribe a piece of land for a successful representation of Mu’awiya for Ziyad.\n\nDistinction between state’s and caliph’s property\n\nTheophanes the Confessor informs us that “Mu’awiyah used to live at Damascus in royal style and stored up his monetary treasures there.” Ya’qubi confirms it. In Ya’qubi’s own words, “Mu’awiya bin Abu Sufyan…. built palaces, constructed houses, ….. rode good-looking mounts and padded saddles….. wore silk and brocade. He acquired crown lands (ṣawāfi) … Ṭirāz (from Persian word meaning an ornamental band of cloth with woven or embroidered inscriptions) was made for him in Yemen, Fustat, Alexandria and Ruha. His family, children, and officials acquired what he acquired and did as he did. A mere salary cannot buy luxuries. Obviously he was using state money on his personal expenditures and was not accountable to anybody for it. The boundary between state exchequer and caliph’s personal wealth got blurred. “Mu’awiya did in Syria, the Jazira, and Yemen what he had done in Iraq, setting aside for himself and making him own the estates that had belonged to the (former) kings, and he granted them to members of his family and entourage. He was the first to have such estates throughout the world, even in Mecca and Medina, and loads of dates and wheat from them used to be delivered to him every year,” notes Ya’qubi. This approach gave his opponents an argument that he was appropriating fay for himself and his family. This argument continued to echo throughout the life of the Umayyad Caliphate for each caliph. It can be found on lips of anybody who opposed the Umayyad rule.\n\nMu’awiya’s personal property can be traced in the hands of his heirs even when the family had lost power. Mu’awiya’s heirs remained affluent but were not super rich. It means that some of the residential palaces Mu’awiya built remained technically a government property and were utilized by the people who became caliphs after him. The line between government exchequer and the private wealth of a caliph had been blurred but not obliterated. The caliph could utilize as much from the government exchequer on his personal needs as he wished. However, transferring the government property to heirs was not possible. The formal check and balance on personal spending of a caliph was public scrutiny and criticism during the Rashidun Caliphate. Nobody could criticize the ‘Khalifa Allah’. The only limiting factor on caliph’s personal spending remained the financial health of the country he ruled. If he used his economic intelligence to run the country, taxes continued to generate and he had enough to spend personally and vice versa.\n\nUmayyads got filthy rich\n\nGranting crown lands to the political dignitaries was a usual practice of the Rashidun Caliphate. The dignitaries received lands, not the caliph himself. The Mu’awiya government modified this. It persued the policy of granting crown lands exclusively to caliph’s clan members, particularly those who were in his good books. First among them was the caliph himself. Ya’qubi asserts that Mu’awiya not only allotted crown lands to himself but to his relatives. Baladhuri holds the same opinion. Again, the reason behind the nepotism was that constitutional check and balance on the ruler were loose. A new logic had emerged that caliph is appointed by Allah and he is responsible only to Allah. He could do whatever he wished in financial matters. If he was wrong, only Allah could judge him.\n\nPomp and show of the governors\n\nThe exhibition of wealth and power was not limited to the caliph in the Umayyad Caliphate. It trickled down to the governors, lieutenant governors and probably to the Ashraf as well. Wealth definitely bestows a comfortable life to its owner. Nonetheless, the display of wealth has nothing to do with comforts of life. It is basically to impress the onlooker. Its aim is to emphasize the wealth-based hierarchy in which the poorest are at the bottom. Showing off wealth is to prevent the poorer members of a society from challenging the authority of wealthier. It is to snub possible criticism on the moral conduct of the affluent. When it imparted so many advantages to those responsible for governing of the country, it is very likely that the caliph himself encouraged such behavior by setting an example. It is generally known that behavior of a subordinate is reflection of that of the boss. .\n\nA big procession of people used to walk in front of Ziyad bin Abihi / Abu Sufyan, holding spears and clubs whenever he appeared in public, asserts Tabari. Tabari also gives graphic details of the pomp and show of the procession that took Ubaydullah bin Ziyad from Syria to Khorasan after the later was appointed lieutenant governor there. .\n\nThat was the time rulers started using plural pronouns for themselves.\n\nMu’awiya government’s taxation policy\n\nThe Mu’awiya government strived to increase the income of the central government and that of the caliph and his well wishers. The central government needed higher revenues to pay the Syrian Troops who were absolutely essential to maintaining the government writ. The government also needed more money as the size of the government was increasing. Mu’awiya introduced many beurocratic departments, which were not heard of during the Rashidun Caliphate. For example, the office of seal (dīwān al Khātam), which was apparently established to authenticate and prevent the falsification of caliphal documents, was a Mu’awiya government innovation. The maintenance of communication and intelligence over the vast areas needed more sources than those at the disposal of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nThe main tax payers of the country were non-Muslims. All of them had entered into sulḥ contracts with the state during the Rashidun Caliphate, which stipulated how much each community would pay. Dishonouring those contracts and compelling them to enter into new contracts might be politically risky. The Mu’awiya government didn’t touch them. It simply introduced a new indirect tax. It was customary for the Iranians/Zoroastrians to give gifts to higher ups on the occasions of their festivals during pre-Islamic times. They kept on giving such gifts to the officials of the Rashidun Caliphate. The rulers of the Rashidun Caliphate didn’t mind the practice because the gifts were mostly token. The officials of Mu’awiya government didn’t hesitate accepting high value gifts on the occasions of Zoroastrian festivals. Ya’qubi reports that “Mu’awiya ordered that he should be brought gifts at Nowrūz and Mihrajān. So one million dirhams would be sent to him at Nowruz and other occasions, and ten million dirhams on Mihrajan. The tax was obviously discriminatory. The Christian population of the country didn’t have to enjoy paying gifts to the government officials on the occasions of Christmas and Easter.\n\nSoldiers and recipients of ‘Aṭa’ were exempt from any kind of tax during the Rashidun Caliphate. This was no longer the case during the Mu’awiya government. Mu’awiya imposed zakat tax on the ‘Ata’ income. The move brought many more citizens of the country in a tax bracket.\n\nAs the income of the central government increased, it was more in position to spend on development projects. Mu’awiya ordered a land survey to be conducted in whole of Iraq and all the crown lands (ṣawāfi). He built dams on them and the revenue of these lands only from the province of Kufa was fifty million dirhams. Mu’awiya took this revenue. ,\n\nThe Mu’awiya government allegedly confiscated the properties of those who dared to oppose the government. The policy might have supplemented the government income.\n\nStunned territorial growth\n\nMu’awiya spent all his life fixing the intrinsic problems of the country he had inherited from the Rashidun Caliphate. The Umayyad Caliphate didn’t add a single square inch of land to the country during Mu’awiya’s tenure. The state didn’t even plan or wish to do so in all sectors except Byzantine Rome. The Umayyad Caliphate was a big country surrounded mostly by petty principalities. It could survive without demarcating its borders with its neighbours through mutual treaties and crossing the effective line of control as and when it wished. Realities at the borders shaped foreign policy of the Umayyad Caliphate during Mu’awiya’s tenure. It was to raid all neighbouring countries on a regular basis. None of the raiding expedition intended to occupy any area permanently. All were small in size, comprising of cavalry only and scanty in heavy military hardware. The raids definitely enriched the participants, produced a source of income for provincial and central governments, and kept the public of Umayyad Caliphate in illusion that the government had not abandoned jihad against infidels.\n\nAfrican Front\n\nEgypt and its dependencies never raided the principalities located to the south along the River Nile. The soldiers of the Umayyad Caliphate loved their eyes. There was no harm in raiding the other adjacent areas of Africa, anyhow. The Umayyad Caliphate raided them regularly as its birth right. It never faced much resistance during these raids and never was disappointed by the amount of booty they yielded. The raids appear to be regularly carried out every two years. Their description is brief, meaning the purpose of raids is clear to the sources. In 665 CE “Mu’awiya bin Abu Sufyan sent Mu’awiya bin Hudayj on a raiding expedition. He reached Fḥṣ and took some captives, but did not conquer any city or fortress. Then he returned,” reports Khalifa. , If people are regularly mentioned as enemies in these raids, they are non-Muslim Berbers. There is only one exception to raiding policy and it merits attention. Carthage maintained its status as a sole Byzantine Roman colony on the African coast for a while. In 679 CE, the army of the Umayyad Caliphate reached Carthage under the command of Dinar Abu Muhajir. After fierce fighting, which lasted two years, and during which many died and wounded from both sides, the opponents struck a peace deal. They evacuated the peninsula for Dinar’s army, probably temporarily. , , Despite pressure, the Mu’awiya government failed to get full hold of the Byzantine colony.\n\nIndian Front\n\nThe Makran-Hind front was active as early as 662 CE when a contingent of the Umayyad Caliphate penetrated deep into Sind under the command of a local lieutenant governor. However, the raids in this direction didn’t prove profitable. We hear of a few raids on Qīqān during the next eight years with very little mention of booty but a lot of casualties on the Muslim side and successes of ‘polytheists’. Perhaps the Umayyad Caliphate shelved its plan of border raids on this front after the death of its lieutenant governor on the battlefield in 670 CE. , ,\n\nThe Sistan-Hind front has similar story. We hear of very few raids across the border from this front. In one particular raid in 664 CE, the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate marched to Qandabil, from where they proceeded to Banna and reached up to lhwn /hwz and returned home with their hands full of booty. , In another raid in 673 CE, which originated from Kandahar, the raiders reached Bayt adh Dhahab. , .\n\nBusyness with local nobles explains the lack of action on the Sistan borders. We hear of many notices of disobedience from the local nobles. The Umayyad Caliphate had to re-subdue Amol, Rokhhaj, Zubulistan, Zaranj and Kandahar on different occasions. ,\n\nThe revolt of Kabul particularly attracts attention. It started in 664 CE when the troops of the Umayyad Caliphate had to discipline the district. Two years later, the Shah of Kabul, whose title was Zunbīl, expelled the Umayyad Caliphate monitors from the town and expanded his influence up to Zabulistan and Rukhhaj. The Umayyad Caliphate could only halt him at Bust. Zunbil held his grounds for four years until the Umayyad Caliphate would impose a tax of one million Dirham on him again in 672 CE. ,\n\nCentral Asian Front\n\nThe Khorasan-Central Asia border was the farthest from the capital. It was also far away from the provincial capital of Basrah, which controlled it. The Umayyad Caliphate had a dual job in this area. It had to quell periodic revolts of local non-Muslim nobles and tailor to unceasing cross border raids.\n\nOver the twenty years of Mu’awiya’s caliphate, the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate in Khorasan had to re-subjugate the mountainous district of Ghūr and Farāwandah, Quhistan, as well as Balkh. ,\n\nRiver Oxus marked the boundary of the Umayyad Caliphate. Cross border raids were essentially across River Oxus. Annual raids became routine in the area. After the First Arab Civil War, when the Mu’awiya government adopted a policy of stable borders, Central Asia provided a fertile ground for the Umayyad Caliphate for treasure hunting. Winter was bitter in the region. Campaigns were possible only duing summer. Each spring, the troops of the Umayyad Caliphate used to cross the River Oxus, raid any prinicipality that was not on alert that summer, grab booty, and return to comforts of Merv before winter.\n\nThe raids took the troops of the Muslim Arabs as far as Bukhāra in 672 CE and Samarkand and Tirmidh in 676 CE. , .\n\nSources specifically mention an abundance of booty in the raids carried out by Merv. Apparently, the success of the raids was the result of the mutual hostility of Turk princes, and their willingness to co-operate with the invaders to harm their opponent prince.\n\nNorthern front\n\nThe northern border of the Umayyad Caliphate, across which laid the powerful Khazar Khanate, remained passive. Here, the border was formed after the defeat of the Rashidun Caliphate when two big powers had come face-to-face. The only time the Muslims raided across this was immediately after Mu’awiya assumed power in 662 CE. This was against the people of Alāns. , .\n\nByzantine Rome front\n\nSyria and its dependencies, Mu’awiya’s own province, bordered the hottest front of the country. When Mu’awiya came to power, he was already in a truce with the Byzantine Rome. We don’t know how the truce broke. Baladhuri alleges that the Romans were perfidious. Ya’qubi asserts that Mu’awiya had consolidated his power over the Umayyad Caliphate, he no longer needed the truce. In any case, whatever the reason, the truce was already over in the second year of Mu’awiya’s caliphate because Tabari alleges that in 662 CE, Muslims raided the Byzantine and inflicted a shocking defeat on them, reportedly killing several generals (baṭāriqah). ,\n\nSince then, the winter and summer raids against Byzantine Rome each year became routine. According to Baladhuri the campaigns started from the border cities of Syria and Jazira and from the naval bases of coastal cities. The Umayyad Caliphate used to delay invasions if it perceived the enemy to be strong and vigilant. The raiders used to traverse the whole of Anatolia and reach up to the fringes of Constantinople. There was not a single year up the death of Mu’awiya when the Umayyad Caliphate didn’t raid Anatolia once or twice a year. Sometimes, the raids were a combination of land and sea attacks.\n\nMostly the notices of these campaigns are short. It means the primary aim of the Umayyad Caliphate for these raids was to harass the Byzantine Rome and to keep it on its toes. Over and above regular raiding, the Umayyad Caliphate didn’t lose any other chance of destabilizing the Byzantine Caliphate. In 668 CE, for example, general Saborios of Armenia rebelled against Emperor Constans. Both quickly sent their envoys to Damascus to win over Mu’awiya’s support. The envoy of Saborios asked for military support and the envoy of Emperor Constans requested neutrality. Mu’awiya’s leaning was towards supporting the rebel forces. He pushed both envoys into a war of bidding, in which the winner would get Mu’awiya’s support for his cause. Emperor’s envoy could not offer to pay what Saborios’s envoy was willing to. Mu’awiya had been sending campaigns into Byzantine lands and helping Saborios was not an extra burden for the Umayyad Caliphate. The Umayyad Caliphate sent its usual campaign with instructions to help the rebels. The matter didn’t go further because Emperor Constans defeated the rebel forces before the Arabs could help them.\n\nThe full efforts to keep Byzantine Rome on its toes was for a purpose. Mu’awiya had not learned any lessons from the defeat of 656 CE at Constantinople. He was still dreaming of capturing Constantinople with an amphibian attack, killing the Emperor and ending the empire. To achieve its target, the Umayyad Caliphate occupied many islands in and around Aegean Sea and established military posts on them. “Tighten the noose around the Byzantines, for then you will have other nations in your power,” was Mu’awiya’s message to those soldiers of the Umayyad Caliphate who were preparing to capture one such island. Many of these islands were otherwise uninhabited.\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphate occupied and stationed military in Rhodes, Crete, Cicily and many small unnamed Islands one by one. The occupation of Sicily was the last and most difficult. Raids on it started from Egypt during the governorship of Mu’awiya bin Hudayj (664 – 670 CE). At the long last, the island surrendered partial areas for permanent occupation by the Umayyad Caliphate in 680 CE. , , ,\n\nThe catalyst of Mu’awiya’s hope of finishing off Byzantine Rome was the internal weaknesses of Byzantine Rome itself. The country had hardly given a stiff resistance to the sorties sent by the Umayyad Caliphate. The only restraining factor on advance of the Umayyad Caliphate was absence of any population group in Byzantine Rome willing to co-operate with Arabs. The country was a theocracy and was bogged by religious differences among its population. The Emperor was not strong enough to force the antagonizing groups into sub ordinance. Fights among the Emperor and the generals for power always fanned opposing religious ideas further. Such conspiracies and theological differences were the background of the assassination of Emperor Constans in 669 CE in Sicily. His son, Constantine (IV) had to fight wars against the conspirators to gain the throne of his father.\n\nWhen the Umayyad Caliphate achieved full internal stability and the the scars of the First Arab Civil War were over, Mu’awiya decided to launch a full-fledged amphibian attack on Constantinople. Theophanes the Confessor gives vivid details: “In March of 673 CE a rainbow appeared in the sky and all mankind shuddered. Everyone said it was the end of the world.” The rainbow was a bad omen for the Byzantine Romans from God in Theophanes’ worldview. “In this year the deniers of Christ readied a great expedition. They sailed to and wintered in Kilikia; Muhammad bin Abdullah was at Smyrna and Qays in Kilikia and Lykia. Mu’awiya also sent the emir Khalid with yet another expedition to help them” while “there was a plague in Egypt”. , By that time Byzantine Rome had acquired a secret weapon – Greek fire – which the Umayyad Caliphate was completely unaware of. Theophanes gives the credit of its invention to a certain Kalinikos, who was an artificer from Heliopolis, and had fled to the Romans. He had devised a sea fire which had a capacity to ignite the Umayyad Caliphate’s ships and burn them with soldiers on board. , When the military and the navy of the Umayyad Caliphate advanced and “Constantine (IV) learned of the movement of God’s enemies against Constantinople, he prepared huge two-storied warships equipped with Greek fire and siphon-carrying warships, ordering them to anchor in the Proklianesian Harbour of the Caesarium. , . In the spring, of 674 CE the expedition of enemies of God anchored in the Thracian territory from the heights of Hedbomon known as Magnaura on the west to the cape of Kyklobion on the east. . The clashes between the two sides continued from April to September. The Arabs retreated to Kyzikos, which they had taken, to winter there. In the spring [of 675 CE] they set out in the same way to meet the Christians in sea-battle. ….. but with the aid of God and His Mother they were disgraced, expending a host of warlike men. They retreated in great distress, with severe wounds inflicted on themselves. As their expeditions were going away after God had ruined it, it was overtaken by a tempestuous winter storm near Syllaion. It was shivered to atoms and completely destroyed. A second brother, Sufyan bin Auf, joined battle with Roman force under Florus, Petronas, and Kyprianos’ 30,000 Arabs were killed”. The “sea fire ignited the Arab ships and burned them with all hands. Thus it was that the Roman returned with victory.” , Greek fire was such a defensive ‘atom bomb’ for the Romans that its design and composition became a highly classified state secret. Still scholars debate about its nature. , ,\n\nThe defeat of the Umayyad Caliphate at Constantinople was not due to passive resistance by Byzantine Rome. It was from active onslaught. This was the first victory of the Christian power over the Islamic state. The victory definitely imparted the Byzantine Romans with a necessary moral boost. Modern historians consider it a turning point in the survival struggle of Byzantine Rome in the wake of Arab invasions.\n\nByzantine Rome was still not powerful enough to send an army all the way across Anatolia to Syria. Their only option was sabotage operations along the southern and eastern Mediterranean littoral. Around 676 CE Emperor Constantine IV dispatched a guerrilla force, dubbed “insurgents” (mardaites). They sailed to the coast of Tyre and Sidon. After disembarking they dispersed into the mountains of Lebanon. Jarājimah were the Christian inhabitants of the rural areas around Antakya. They never paid Jiziya after Futuhul Buldan because they agreed to provide the Rashidun Caliphate with spying services on Byzantine Rome. However, mostly they played a role of double agent. This time they were aware of arrival of mardaites and were waiting to join them. In addition, many run away slaves and native peasants joined the mardaites. The numbers of the guerrilla force swelled into the thousands within short time. The insurgents played havoc from the peaks of Lebanon Mountains to Jerusalem. The Umayyad Caliphate didn’t have the ability to curb them. Hesitantly, Mu’awiya government heeded to Byzantine Rome for Armistice. After prolonged negotiations the two sides agreed on a written peace accord for thirty years term to be taken under oath. The Umayyad Caliphate had to pay three thousand Dinars, fifty prisoners, and fifty high bred Arabian horses. The two parties exchanged the copies of the treaty with each other. The humiliating conditions of the peace accord enhanced the status of Byzantine Rome in eyes of its neighbours. Avar Khanate and the rulers of the countries on the western borders of Byzantine Rome re-confirmed their peace agreements with Byzantine Rome. ,\n\nDue to constant raiding of frontier regions of Anatolia, the Byzantine side of the border remained deserted. Few people settled there after Heraclius’s abandonment of the forts. They had to flee for safety every time Umayyad Caliphate raided. Sometimes Byzantine government brought and stationed some fighters in the area as a transient measure.\n\nOn the Byzantine Rome frontier, Armenia remained a thorn in the side of the Umayyad Caliphate. It was within the boundary of the Umayyad Caliphate but its people got inspiration from Byzantine Rome. Umayyad Caliphate had to calm down its regional revolts time and again. .\n\nNew cantonments incepted / Military organization/ lieutenant governors\n\nConstant raiding in the border areas necessitated different military infrastructure from that of Futuhul Buldan. The Umayyad Caliphate organized the military on an altered module from that of the Rashidun Caliphate. The districts located on the borders were called Junds. The Umayyad Caliphate took out troops from centrally located cantonments and stationed them in Junds. Some of the border towns had much influx and so much regular military activity that they grew into a cantonment town in their own right. uring ‘Ali’s tenure a number of soldiers from both kufa and Basrah garrisons refused to serve ‘Ali anymore. They immigrated to Syria to join Mu’awiya. He settled them in Qinnasrīn and converted this rural district attached to Homs into a garrison city. Another example of extension of pre-existing town into a cantonment is Merv.\n\nThere were border areas which did not have any big towns. If Umayyad Caliphate had to maintain constant raiding in the area it had to lay foundation of new safe residential complex. Such is the case of Kairouan (Qayrawān). Kairouan was built on pattern of Kufa, Basrah or Fustat in 670 CE. The land was cleared of thickets, the wildlife chased away, lots cut and houses built. Governor house and grand mosque decorated the central plaza. , , ,\n\nJunds were attached to the relevant provincial governments for governance. However, they had their own administrators. They were tax collectors cum military commanders and were called Amīr (lieutenant governor). The lieutenant governors were mostly appointed by the provincial governor. Sometimes they were appointed directly by the caliph. ,\n\nThey were responsible to the provincial governor directly and to the caliph indirectly. The lieutenant governors of Rashidun Caliphate did not have legal powers to take the troops across the border without permission of the provincial governor. Lieutenant governors of Umayyad Caliphate were expected to do so. The military stationed in the junds was at their disposal.\n\nThe lieutenant governors had to be palpably unpredictable. They raided the neigbouring country whenever they perceived that the ‘enemy’ was in distress or unvigilant. Their troops were not equipped with heavy militaryware. They were all cavalry for swift movement.\n\nThe arrangement of the surprise attack would have been incomplete without naval support for the raids on Anatolia. The Umayyad Caliphate built a large naval base at Acre where military ships were.\n\nTransplantation of population\n\nBoth voluntary and forced transplantation of big groups of the population from one part of the country to another continued. When Mu’awiya took over Kufa from Hasan he expelled many Shi’a Ali from the town and settled them in Syria, Basrah and Jazira.\n\nIn 662 CE Muy’awia transplanted many Persians from Baalbek, Homs and Antakya to the sea coast of Jordan, i.e. Tyre, Acre and other places. He also moved people of other ethnicities from Baalbek, Homs, and Kufa to Antakya. In the same year, or a year before or after, he also transplanted some asāwirah from Basrah and Kufa to Antakya.\n\nSa’id bin Uthman bin Affan, Mu’awiya’s lieutenant governor over Khorasan had taken fifty youths, sons of grandees of Samarkand, as hostage as a guarantee of good conduct on their part. When Mu’awiya dismissed him, Sai’d broke his agreement in frustration and took all of them to Medina.\n\nA new political group – mawla\n\nThe term ‘mawla’ (mawlā) orgininated from the pre-Islamic era. It designated those weak men who received protection from a tribe they were not born in. During the Rashidun Caliphate, the concept of mawla changed a bit. He was a slave who earned his freedom by converting to Islam. The process of creating mawla in this way continued. Side by side, another way of creating mawla emerged as well. This was conversion of non-Arab free men into Islam. When an individual or a group of non-Arabs converted to Islam, they sought the blessing of an influential Arab personality or tribe. This personality or tribe claimed that it was a catalyst in their conversion and symbolically relieved the converts of ‘political slavery’. The non-Arab new Muslims were thus recognized by the state as mawla of the Arab personality or the Arab tribe who catalyzed their conversion. The mawlas usually remained politically and socially loyal to their catalyzer. They participated in political struggle from the side of their catalyzer.\n\nMost of the mawlas adopted an Arabic name at the time of conversion. . That is the reason it is difficult to recognize them in historical sources unless the source explicitly mentions the origin of that person. Mawlas belonged to almost all ethnicities. We cannot label each and every mawla to be Persian by default. The identification of a mawla in historical sources has one more problem. All Mawlas mentioned in historical sources were not newly converted Muslims. Sometimes, Islamic sources use this term for those non-Muslims who were in the employment of the Arab Muslim elites. , . Mawlas were not slaves (mamlūk or ‘Ābid). However, Islamic historical literature sometimes confuses the two in the flow of writing. On occasions, Islamic sources use the word mawla explicitly for a person who is actually a slave and a non-Muslim. On other occasions Islamic sources use the word ‘Abd for a person who is technically a Mawla. Basically, whenever Islamic sources wish to emphasize a superior–inferior relationship between two persons, they tend to choose the term mawla, though the inferior might not be technically a mawla. He might be a slave or an employee. When term mawla is used for such non-mawlas, it appears, the source intended to emphasize loyalty on the part of the inferior towards the superior.\n\nMawlas – newly converted Muslims – became part of Arab politics from the time of the battle of Siffin when they participated in the battle from both sides. As time passed their presence in politics increased. However, mawlas did not have any independent political views during the early years of the Umayyad Caliphate. They appear in politics under the leadership of an Arab Muslim and toe his line of action.\n\nMawlas were going to play a pivotal role in the history of Islam from now onwards.\n\nMu’awiya’s vision of future\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arab traditions, many of which were still lingering on, tribal leadership changed hands on a qu’dūd basis. People pushed the seniormost figure of a tribe to a leadership role after the death of the existing chief. This was not the case for the transfer of power in a state-like entity. The leadership transferred to the most capable among the descendants after the death of a ruler. When Islamic Arab society matured from its tribal form to the bureaucratic form, the rule of qu’dūd changed into primogeniture form. The last change of power in the Rashidun Caliphate was between the father and the son – Ali and Hasan.\n\nOnce Mu’awiya became the undisputed ruler of the country and could maintain a reasonable political calm, one question preoccupied him. Who would rule the country after him? Umayyad Caliphate had still not made any hard and fast rules regarding succession.\n\nThe generation of the earliest Muhajirun who had governed the country in the past had already passed away. Now their second generation had come of age. It was discernible that after Mu’awiya the power would go to the next generation of stalwarts. The question in the air was whose generation? Should it be the next generation of caliphs preceding Mu’awiya according to the qu’dūd rule or the next generation of caliphs according to the primogeniture rule? Being caliph was no longer merely an honor of serving the Muslim community as their head. The long and autocratic rule of Mu’awiya had added a new dimension to being a caliph. It was understandable that whoever would succeed him, would not only have unchecked political powers but also would be able to determine his remunerations lavishly without needing pre-authorization from any institution. The post of caliph had become extremely lucrative.\n\nMu’awiya deemed it a right of the sitting caliph to pick the next caliph and didn’t see any discrimination if the picked man was the caliph’s own son. However, Mu’awiya had one problem. His twenty-three-year-old son Yazid, who could potentially take over the caliphate, was not fit for the job. “He loved children’s games and the pastime of idle”, blames John bar Penkaye. , , Each society has a moral ideal that it wishes to see in its ruler. This moral ideal is always lofty and the majority of society’s own members do not follow it. Yazid lacked the character which was necessary to be the caliph of Muslims. Mu’awiya was aware of the shortcomings. .\n\nBefore Mu’awiya promoted his son as heir apparent, he started building his image. He gave him command of a contingent to raid Byzantine Rome. The contingent included almost all prominent men of Quraysh like Abdullah bin Zubayr, Abdullah bin Umar and Abdullah bin Abbas. It also included the respected nonagenarian Abu Ayub al Ansari, who was one of the few surviving Companions. The contingent reached the vicinity of Constantinople in 669 CE. , , , , . The aim of the campaign was definitely not assaulting Constantinople. Mu’awiya did not send any supporting navy. Theophanes gives the numbers of accompanying soldiers to be only five thousand. It returned home like any other summer campaign.\n\nMughira bin Shu’ba could surmise Mu’awiya’s commotion at this stage and publicly tipped him to declare Yazid as heir apparent. . After the death of Mughira, Mu’awiya requested Ziyad to advise Yazid to mend his etiquette. , .\n\nAfter securing reassurances from his confidants, Mu’awiya wrote a will and revealed it to an assembly of like-minded Ashraf in Damascus. Everybody accepted Yazid as their heir apparent (walī al ‘ahd). Soon after, the governors of the provinces secured similar acceptance from the Ashraf of their respective provinces. . Nobody gave a second thought to the proposal including most of the Quraysh, all of the Ansar and all of the other tribes of Arabia. , .\n\nNot everybody in the country agreed with Mu’awiya’s plans. When Mu’awiya went to perform Hajj in 670 CE, five prominent members of Quraysh, residents of Medina, met with him and conveyed their reservations. They were Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr, Abdullah bin Umar, Husayn bin Ali, Abdullah bin Zubayr and Abdullah bin Abbas. They objected to the procedure of choosing next caliph without a wider consultation. None of them showed any intention to consider any of them as a potential candidate but they did express that a son of any of the past caliphs could be the next caliph. So, why only Mu’awiya’s son? , The opposition was so meagre, so feeble and so divided that Mu’awiya showed indifference to it and left it for Yazid to sort it out after becoming caliph. We don’t hear of any actions from the opposition during Mu’awiya’s tenure. , Probably, they were aware of their weak position and postponed the issue to the death of Mu’awiya.\n\nDeath of Mu’awiya\n\nPaving Yazid’s way to the dice of the caliphate was Mu’awiya’s last political action. He died of a short suppurative ailment on April 21, 680 CE. , , Mu’awiya had a shirt of Prophet Muhammad and his nail clippings. He willed to be wrapped in that shirt for burial and wanted the nails ground and put in his eyes and mouth. , It is customary for Muslims to proclaim shahada at the time of death so everybody present could know that he died on Islam. Mu’awiya had been being blamed of abandoning his faith throughout his political life. , His will to bury the regalia of the Prophet with him could be equivalent to shahada.\n\nMu’awiya’s place in history\n\nMu’awiya was at the helm of power for twenty years as governor of Syria and twenty further years as caliph. Due to the longest tenure so far he had more potential to shape early Islam than any of his predecessors. Mu’awiya was definitely a statesman. In his eulogy Ḍaḥḥak bin Qays said that he brought unity to the divided Ummah. Given the fact that Mu’awiya faced only symbolic opposition as compared to his predecessors, Ali and Uthman, one can assume that Mu’awiya was a popular ruler. “While Mu’awiya reigned there was such a great peace in the world as was never heard of,” writes John bar Penkaye, a contemporary Christian who compiled a chronicle around 688 CE. , These flaws included his appointment of troublemakers to rule the community without consulting its members, even though there were remaining Companions and virtuous individuals among them; his appointment of his son as his successor, who was known for being a drunkard, a winebibber who wears silk and plays ṭunbūrs [a musical instrument]; his allegation about Ziyad, while the Messenger of Allah has said, “The child belongs to the bed, and the adulterer should be stoned; and his killing of Ḥujr. Woe unto him twice for Ḥujr and his companions.\n\nHis contribution in relieving the institution of the caliph of the burden of religious jurisprudence and assigning this load to the shoulders of religious scholars cannot be neglected. It helped further the development of Islam independent of the tutelage of the state and granted the future caliphs the flexibility to formulate laws according to the need of hour. He, anyhow, bitterly failed to develop a constitutional principle about the succession of a caliph and his death heralded another war of succession known as the Second Arab Civil War.\n\nHuman society has experienced many different forms of government. One common form is autocracy. It is the rule of a legal but strong leader. Such leader gathers enough power to run the government affairs by his own will, without getting any inputs from anybody else. Another common form is democracy. It is arbitrarily defined as ‘a government of people, by the people, for the people. Yet there is another form of government. It is called an anocracy. An a"
