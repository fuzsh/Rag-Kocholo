        "text": "Abbasid Dynasty (750-1258) builds their capital in Baghdad, making this Silk Road city a center of power where philosophic, scientific and literary works are cultivated. The Abbasid Dynasty was the third of the Islamic caliphates and was founded in Harran in 750 by the descendants of Prophet Muhammad's youngest uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. From Haran the capital shifted in 762 to Baghdad, which grew under the Abbasids for two centuries. Previously, during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Marwan II, Harran had become the seat of the caliphate government of the Islamic empire which stretched from Spain to Central Asia. During the late 8th and 9th centuries, the city of Harran was also a center of learning where translating works of astronomy, philosophy, natural sciences, and medicine from Greek to Arabic brought an exchange of knowledge between the classical and Islamic worlds.\n\nAchaemenid Empire (c. 550330 BCE), also known as the Persian Empire, was the largest empire by geographical extent in ancient times; at the height of its power, the empire spanned three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe. The empire was forged by Cyrus the Great. At its greatest extent, the empire included the modern territories of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, parts of Central Asia, Asia Minor, Thrace and Macedonia, much of the Black Sea coastal regions, Iraq, northern Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya.\n\nAfrican Trade Routes For much of history, Africa was regarded by Europe as the Dark Continent, because so little was known about it. Yet, for millennia, African routes existed overland, by river, and by sea. Between 3000-1000 BCE, the first extensive trade routes were developed upon the great rivers which become the backbones of early civilizations - the Nile in Africa, the Tigris and Euphrates in the Near East, and the Yellow River and the Indus in Asia (historically, the period from 1250 BCE153 CE saw the Mediterranean, Western Asian, Chinese and Indian societies develop major transportation networks for trade). But it was in the eastern Mediterranean where extensive maritime trade first developed -- first between Egypt and Minoan Crete (c.3000-1000 BCE) -- and later with Phoenician ships throughout the Mediterranean and along the north African coast. (See Carthage / Saharan Trade) More...\n\nAfrosiab The name for ancient Samarkand, often called \"the Heart of the Silk Road,\" now in modern-day Uzbekistan. One of the great archaeological finds of the 20th century, Ulugh Beg's observatory, built in the 1420's, is located here. The city is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nAge of Discovery (also known as the European \"Age of Exploration\") was a period which began with 16th century geographic exploration, leading to European overseas expansion and the rise of colonial empires. In the late Middle Ages, transcontinental trade along the Silk Routes declined, as sea routes increased and maritime trade developed. More...\n\nIn search for the passage to India and beyond, Europeans sought to sail eastward from Europe, to fabulous Cathay (China), and the mysterious island of Cipango (Japan). The desire to trade directly with China was the main motive behind the expansion of the Portuguese Empire beyond Africa after 1480, followed by the expansion of the Dutch and British colonial empires.\n\nAhmedabad was founded in 1411 by Sultan Ahmed Shah on the banks of the river Sabarmati. Later, the Royal City of Ahmedabad became the commercial and cultural capital of Gujarat. When the Mughal Empire annexed Gujarat in 1572, Ahmedabad lost its political pre-eminence, but continued to flourish as a great trading centre connecting the silk route with the spice route. Through the centuries Ahmedabad remains a prosperous city, as it is Indias seventh largest city, and is also one of the subcontinents few medieval cities which continues to prosper. More...\n\nAk Han Kervansaray is a typical example of Seljuk Caravanserai architecture. It is located near Denizli along the Silk Routes of Turkey. The Seljuk Islamic decorative motifs include an ornate front portal that includes flowers, leaves, and doves as part of its stone sculpture decoration. A tower stands at each end of the main entrance hall, serving as a lookout towers. The 13th century Caravanserai was built on a flat plain that allowed travelers, enemies or robbers to be seen from a considerable distance.\n\nAk Han Kervansaray, Turkey built c. 1253-1254\n\nAkbar\n\nJalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (1542  1605) the third Mughal Emperor. He was of Timurid descent; the son of Humayun, and the grandson of Babur, the ruler who founded the Mughal Empire in India. At the end of his reign in 1605, the Mughal Empire covered most of the northern and central India and was one of the most powerful empires of its age. The Silk Road brought trade and prosperity to northern India. Akbar's reign significantly influenced art and culture in India and the region. Under the The Mughal Emperors and the Islamic Dynasties of India, the city of Agra became a leading center of art, science, commerce, and culture. More...\n\nAksu (Akesu) is a city in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It was an important stop on the Northern Silk Road that runs along the northern edge of the Taklamakan desert in the Tarim Basin between Kucha and Kashgar. Aksu was positioned on a junction of trade routes: the northern-Tarim route of the Silk road, and the dangerous route north via the Tian Shan's Muzart Pass to the fertile Ili River valley. Aksu Prefecture shares a boundary to the northwest with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. In the south, it is separated from Hotan by the Taklamakan Desert. It is northeast of Kashgar. Aksu lies at the south foot of Tianshan Mountain on the north edge of the Tarim Basin. The Tianshan Mountains are in the north while the Taklamakan Desert lies to the south.\n\nAksum (Axum) Much of of the wealth of Axum derived from its control of the Incense trade. The Ethiopian Kingdom of Aksum challenged Rome's monopoly of Eastern trade by way of the Red Sea. With the economic decline of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century, Greco-Roman trade in the Indian Ocean declined. Thanks to the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, the demand for Oriental goods prospered under the Byzantines, whose capital Constantinople, now Istanbul, replaced Rome as the the leading city in Europe. Greco-Roman commerce with India reached its peak during the reigns of the Julio-Claudian and Flavian emperors, 31-96 AD. More...\n\nAksumite Kingdom (or Axumite Empire) was an important trading nation in northeastern Africa (modern Ethiopia), which achieved prominence by the 1st century AD. The Aksumite Kingdom and other civilizations of Eurasia were involved in various commercial activities, such as the spice trade, since ancient times. More...\n\nAla Shan a desert in Central Asia, in northern China, between the Ala Shan Range (Heilungkiang) and the Hwang Ho River in the east, the Jo Shui (Etsin Gol) River in the west, the foothills of the Nan Shan in the south, and the Gobi tectonic depression at the border between China and Mongolia in the north. It has an area of about one million sq km. The altitude ranges between 820 m in the northwest to 1,660 m in the south. The Ala Shan is a stratified plain with small isolated ranges of a relative altitude of 150200 m (Bayan Ula, Hara Ula, and others) and areas of low rounded hills. There are numerous closed depressions with fresh or salt subsoil waters not far from the surface and salt lakes that are sometimes dried out (Hara Nur, Zhalatai Daws). There are large tracts of moving sands: in the southwest, Badan Zhareng; in the south, Kholalis; in the southeast, Tengri; and in the northwest, Ulanpukho. The Badan Zhareng tract has the largest sand ridges, attaining heights of 300400 m. The river system is rich in seasonal streams, which flow only in the summerduring monsoon or other heavy rains. The biggest rivers are the Jo Shui and Shuihe. There are many lakes but most of them are very small, except the Sogo Nur and Shara Burdu lakes.\n\nAlaqa-Beki Daughter of Genghis Khan who by the 1220's was a major figure in Mongol China representing Onggud.\n\nAl-Athir (1160 -1233) An Arab historian whose works are extremely important for the early years of Mongol expansion to 1231.\n\nAldaulat\n\nSa'd Aldaulat of Abar Jewish physician and vizier to Ilqan Arghun during the 13th century.\n\nAleppo (Hallab) was a large trading city, like Hamidiye, located in Syria at the western end of the Silk Road. Equidistant from the Mediterranean and the Euphrates, Aleppo rivals Damascus in its claim as the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. After Islamic rulers conquered it, in A.D. 636, Aleppo succeeded Antioch as the most important Western destination for Silk Road caravans. The citys souk (market) still occupies its original Silk Road site. More...\n\nAlexander the Great (born c. 356 BC) The expansion of Alexander the Great's empire into Central Asia contributes to opening the Silk Road between the East and West. Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of Macedon or Macedonia. By the age of thirty he was the creator of one of the largest empires in ancient history, stretching from the Ionian sea to the Himalaya. He is considered one of the most successful commanders of all time. Alexander was tutored by the famed philosopher Aristotle. In 336 BCE he succeeded his father Philip II of Macedon to the throne after he was assassinated. The Macedonian Empire stretched from the Adriatic sea to the Indus River. Following his desire to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea,\" he invaded India in 326 BC, but was eventually forced to turn back.\n\nIt was after Alexander's Balkan campaign in Europe that Alexander crossed into Asia where in 334 BC the Battle of the Granicus River was fought in Northwestern Asia Minor near the site of Troy in modern-day Turkey. He conquered Asia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia, Egypt, and Iran. After Alexander defeated the last of the Achaemenid Empire's forces in 328 BC, he began a new campaign against the various Indian kings in 327 BC. Crossing through the Amudarya, in the summer of 327, he passed through the Hindukush and began his famous Indian campaign. Alexander's goal was to conquer the entire \"known world,\" which in Alexander's day, ended on the eastern end of India. In August 329 BCE, at the mouth of the Fergana Valley in Tajikistan Alexander founded the city of Alexandria Eschate or \"Alexandria The Furthest.\" This later became a major staging point on the northern Silk Route.
