Paravicini Bagliani\n\nA basic but, fundamental change in Europe in the 12th Century was the rise of a new form of learning that included astrology and alchemy. The focus of this seminar is on the 10th and 13th century which marked a period of remarkable intellectual achievements in Dar al-Islam, which some historians have termed the “Golden Ages”, which would, during this era, be transmitted throughout much of the Western world. Kieckhefer identifies two key factors which transformed European intellectual life in the later middle ages, the first of which was the development of universities out of the earlier cathedral schools and the importation of Arabic learning, including the transmission of Aristotelian philosophy and science from Arabic culture. Both these developments are inextricably linked to the superior intellectual and cultural traditions that had developed in the Islamic empire since its expansion.\n\nThis paper explores the significance of the ancient Arabian astrological views in the mental-spiritual life of pre-Islamic Arabs who divinized the celestial bodies, and endeavored to pierce the veils of the future by the study of motions and relative positions of the planets, the sun, the moon, the their interpretation in terms of human characteristics and activities. First, I discuss the echoes of ancient astrological views in Arabian religious-philosophic system, rituals and mysteries, and in their mythology. Arabs as the other Semitic peoples personified celestial bodies, gave them human characters and told stories about them. Building on these observations this paper aims to identify the traces of astrological notions in the early Arabian tradition — pre-Islamic poetry and early Muslim hagiography. Of particular interest for us is an important role of ancient Sabians in astrological views of pre-Islamic Arabs, particularly in kāhin practices.\n\nThe medieval Arabic-speaking world had southern Spain, or Andalusia, as its far western border and then stretched across North Africa eastward to include all of modern-day Iran. Its two major intellectual centers were Cordova in the west and Baghdad in the east. As for its temporal extent, what might be termed \" the classical period \" of Arabic philosophy and science roughly began in the fi rst half of the ninth century with the \" fi rst \" Arabic philosopher, al-Kindı ¯, and continued until the end of the twelfth, when Persian began to emerge as a rival to Arabic for writing and thinking about philosophy and the \" Aristotelian \" approach to science began gradually to be abandoned. Certainly one of the signifi cant contributions of those working in the medieval Arabic-speaking world was the continuation of a scientifi c tradition going back to the earliest Greek natural philosophers , which attempted to explain the various natural phenomena and physical features that make up our world. The study of nature in the medieval Arabic-speaking world was characterized by two currents that usually fl owed in parallel, while occasionally crossing over and feeding one another: these were the intellectual traditions associated with kala ¯m and falsafa. Although one is tempted to translate these terms respectively as \" theology \" and \" philosophy, \" it is not clear how helpful such labels are for understanding the differences between the two, since both traditions were interested in roughly the same set of questions, and their answers often shared common intuitions. Perhaps a better way to distinguish between the two is to consider how the CHAPTER 3\n\nThe present article deals with the practice of predictions and the art of interpretation of dreams, circulated in pre-Islamic Arabia – with the subject that may seem inclined to ordinary and everyday affairs rather than to the real knowledge. However, the comprehensive analysis of the art of foretelling of pre-Islamic Arabs reveals all these issues to be closely connected with the religious-mythological notions of ancient Arabs, with their psychological and spiritual state, and their interest towards the world around them. It is hardly possible to fully understand spiritual and cultural life of Jahiliyya Arabs without the study of widely spread superstitions and divinations as extispicy, in which the prediction is made by examination of the state of the sacrificial animals' body internally, or augury (iyafat) – the fortunetelling by the flight of birds, or physiognomy (qiyafat) – the art of judging character and destiny from facial features, or interpretation of dreams. Representatives of this art were kahins (soothsayers) and 'arrafs (foretellers), whose practice was genetically connected with the mysteries of neighboring nations as Babylonians, Egyptians, Chaldeans and others. Although Islam liquidated the institution of kahins as something related to heathen rites and occult sciences, nevertheless in Muslim tradition very frequently a situation is stipulated that some kahins foretold the coming of the prophet Muhammad and owing to their belief became Muslims, that promoted the recording of information about their predictions."
