The dynasty expands the Caliphate as far as the Indus river.\n\nAround 684, Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik makes one of the first attempts to purge the Caliphate from heresy. The believe in free will is especially dangerous because it is believed to undermine the legitimacy of the caliphs. One heretic is crucified around 699.\n\nThe religious scholar Dirham is executed for heresy by the Caliph HishāmʿAbd al-Malik in 724."
