        "text": "In the seventh century Armenia and Caucasian Albania formed the Umayyad North, a province that stretched from Erzurum in modern Turkey to the Caspian Sea, and as far north as Darband in modern Daghestan and Tbilisi, in Georgia (see Figure .). After the Islamic incursions in the s, early caliphs followed Sasanian and Byzantine precedent to install presiding princes over Armenia, Albania, and Georgia. This suggests a model of rule whereby the caliph presided from afar but allowed the local elite to rule themselves. At first glance, it seems possible to project Armenia and Albania as 'external challenges', tributary neighbors, or loosely a liated allies, not invested or integrated into the Umayyad Caliphate in the way we might see in the 'lowland provinces'. Yet, despite the considerable autonomy allowed to Armenians, Arabs, Georgians, and Albanians who inhabited the North, the Umayyads were not absentee rulers. They sent governors to the North and fought extended wars against the peoples of the Caucasus, namely the Khazars and Alans. Modern scholars catalogue post-reform coinage and collect evidence of censuses, taxes, and treaties. Armenian sources tell of the princes and nobles who headed to the royal court as diplomats or hostages. Further, the Umayyad family itself was heavily involved in governing, settling, building, and defending the North. Muhammad b. Marwan, Maslama b. Abd al-Malik, and Marwan b. Muhammad served as governors over Armenia and Albania. The presence of these scions of the Umayyad house in the provincial capitals of the North and on the battlefields of the Caucasus challenges the idea of a far-flung empire only nominally ruled by the Umayyads. Umayyad control of the North was not an idle claim or delusion of empire. This chapter introduces the Umayyad North by focusing specifically on the involvement of the Umayyad family in governance, diplomacy, and military campaigns. This adds the perspective of a periphery province to broader discussions about the Umayyads, such as regionalism, centralization, and source criticism. In order to read the Umayyads as part of Armenian and Albanian history in this way, we need to understand the content and concerns of Armenian, Albanian, and Georgian sources. Armenian sources predominate here due to their relative abundance, though Georgian sources also o er interesting perspectives. Most importantly, one Albanian history survives, that attributed to Movses Daskhurants'i"
