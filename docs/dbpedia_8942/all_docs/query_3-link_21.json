        "text": "Continuing our series on “Cities of Islam,” we move on to Şanlıurfa, formerly known as Edessa and often referred to as the “City of Prophets.” Enjoy your reading!\n\nThe Mesopotamian City of Şanlıurfa\n\nŞanlıurfa, situated between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in the northern region of Mesopotamia, is located in the Southeastern Anatolia region of Turkey. Because of its strategic location and fertile climate, the city has played a significant role in trade, agriculture, science, and religion throughout history. Today, it’s recognized as the “Fertile Crescent” in archaeology and hosts numerous prehistoric remains.\n\nThe City of Prophets\n\nUrfa, believed to be where agriculture began with Prophet Adam and associated with prophets like Abraham, Jacob, Job, Jethro, and Elisha, is referred to as the “Holy City” and the “City of Prophets.” The city’s oldest name is Edessa. This name was used briefly during the Seleucid period. Until the Ottoman era, the Arabic name Ruha was used for the city, which later became Urfa. Some believe that Urfa comes from the Syriac word “Orhai” or the Arabic word “veriha,” meaning “abundant water.” In 1984, the city was renamed “Şanlıurfa” to honor its people’s heroic contributions during the National Struggle.\n\nUnder Islamic Rule in Şanlıurfa\n\nWhile part of the Eastern Roman Empire, the city was conquered during the time of Caliph Umar under the leadership of Iyaz ibn Ganm. During the Umayyad period, it became a province along with Harran and Samsat. After the death of Umayyad Caliph Marwan II, the city was handed over to the Abbasids. As the regional authority of the Abbasid state weakened, the city came under the rule of Hamdanids, Marwanids, and the Byzantine Empire. The struggle for control continued between the Crusaders, Ayyubids, and Mamluks until the Ottoman era. In 1516, Yavuz Sultan Selim defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Marj Dabiq, incorporating Urfa into Ottoman territories.\n\nHalil Rahman Complex\n\nThe complex includes the Halil Rahman Mosque, the Halil Rahman Madrasa, the Ridvaniye Mosque, and the Ridvaniye Madrasa. The oldest structure in the complex, the Halil Rahman Mosque, was built in 608 (1211-1212). Architecturally impressive, the Ridvaniye Mosque and Ridvaniye Madrasa are the grandest buildings in the complex. They were commissioned by Ottoman governor Ridvan Ahmed Pasha in 1129 (1717). Balikligol, surrounded by the rectangular complex, is said to have been a fire into which Abraham was thrown by King Nimrod for defying idols. The fire turned into a lake, and logs turned into fish. Therefore, carp living in the lake are considered sacred, and their consumption is believed to bring misfortune.\n\nUmayyad Capital and Center of Knowledge: Harran\n\nWith a history dating back to 6000 BC, Harran stood out due to its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes. In 744, during the Umayyad period, Harran was designated as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate. A governor’s palace was built, and the city’s grand mosque was renovated. Investments were made to boost agriculture and trade in the region.\n\nFlourishing during the Umayyad era, the city also became an important center of knowledge during the Abbasid period. Scientists nurtured here played a significant role in translation and composition activities in the early Abbasid era. Battani of Harran laid the foundations of modern trigonometry and calculated the solar year during this period. The city also played a crucial role in religious sciences. Many Hanbali jurists and hadith scholars emerged during the Seljuk period. One of them was Ibn Taymiyyah.\n\nThe World’s Oldest Archaeological Temple: Göbeklitepe\n\nŞanlıurfa’s east, Göbeklitepe, is considered the world’s oldest temple, with a history of approximately twelve thousand years. Its history predates the invention of the wheel and other tools, indicating primitive construction with the division of labor by many individuals. The temple contains numerous T-shaped standing stones with remarkable animal and human figures engraved on them.\n\nArranged in a circular layout, these standing stones are interpreted as stylized human sculptures. Excavations have revealed six of these structures, with an estimated total of about twenty. Ongoing excavations continue to uncover the mysteries of Göbeklitepe, which was included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 2018. This elevated the region’s significance, leading to the declaration of 2019 as the Year of Göbeklitepe in Turkey.\n\nHidden Paradise: Halfeti\n\nLocated in the western part of Şanlıurfa, Halfeti is often referred to as the “Hidden Paradise” or the “Lost City” because it’s submerged under the waters of the Euphrates River. It has become a tourist hub today due to its historic stone houses and natural beauty. The Great Mosque, with only its minaret above water, and the abandoned structures of Savaşan Village, also known as the “Sunken City,” can be visited by boat. The Karagül flower, which grows exclusively in Halfeti, is one of the region’s symbols.\n\nŞanlıurfa in Evliya Çelebi’s Seyahatname\n\nŞanlıurfa in Evliya Çelebi’s Seyahatname\n\nEvliya Çelebi visited Urfa twice, in 1646 and 1649. In the third volume of his Seyahatname (Book of Travels), he described the city in various aspects, including its physical features, trade, social life, and religion. According to his accounts, the city is inhabited by Turks, Kurds, and Armenians. The people of the city are known for their kindness and hospitality, often hosting guests in accordance with the traditions of Prophet Abraham’s hospitality. The city experiences rainy summers and snowy winters. The neighborhoods boast elegant houses, baths, numerous mosques, and neighborhood mosques.\n\nProminent scholars have emerged from madrasas, daru’l-kurra, daru’l-hadis, and primary schools. Evliya Çelebi noted the prosperity attributed to the blessings of Abraham and Khalilullah in this land. The city is known for its tandir kebab, halva, mulberry wine, and silk.\n\nThe Holy City of Semitic Religions: Example of Şanlıurfa Grand Mosque\n\nHaving hosted various civilizations throughout its history, Şanlıurfa holds a special place in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity due to being the birthplace and dwelling of Prophet Abraham and his activities in the city. The city is considered sacred from the perspectives of these religions due to its historical and cultural sites related to the three faiths. In this context, the Şanlıurfa Grand Mosque is a magnificent structure in terms."
