After an initial period of Khārijite rebellion against the Umayyads in the 120s/740s, in which Khārijite revolutions in North Africa spilled over into the Iberian Peninsula, profound ties developed between the Umayyad amīrs, and the Midrārid and Rustumid imāms. In the far Maghrib, where ‘Abbāsid power did not reach, trade—especially the trade in human beings—brought these erstwhile political and religious enemies together. Relationships between these groups lasted well beyond the destruction of the Midrārid and Rustumid dynasties in the early fourth/tenth century. This paper re-examines the textual and numismatic evidence for Ibāḍī, Ṣufrī, Iberian Umayyad (and even early ‘Abbāsid) relations in order to propose that strong economic interests based primarily in the slave trade underlay the political ties that developed in the late second/eighth century between these groups.\n\nAffan, Muhammad. \"Peperangan Proxy, Mozarab, dan Cordova Dalam Sejarah Umayyah II Di Andalusia.\" JUSPI (Jurnal Sejarah Peradaban Islam) 2, no. 1 (July 31, 2018): 36. http://dx.doi.org/10.30829/j.v2i1.1546.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></p><p><em>The following article aims to describe the proxy warfare, Mozarab and city of Cordova in the history of Umayyad II in Andalusia, Spain.

Many of them did not resist Islam and its divine teachings and gradually converted to this new religion; however, they stood up to the racist and oppressive dominance of Umayyad family and whenever they got an opportunity, they expressed their hatred towards them by joining anti-Umayyad uprisings. Abdolrahmanibn Mohammad ibnAsh’at was one of the anti-Umayyad uprisings. Many of Sistani people took part in this uprising. In the present study, the descriptive—analytical research method has been used and with the help of library sources, the role of Sistani people in the uprising of ibnAsh’at against the Umayyad caliphate system has been reviewed. Due to dissatisfaction of Sistani people with the oppressive Umayyad governance, Khawarij’s anti-Umayyad propaganda in Sistan region, exponential financial and bodily costs resulting from successive wars of the Umayyad governors in eastern borders with the governance of Ratabilan, the essential substrate was built for Sistani people to join ibnAsh’at’s anti-Umayyad uprising. Although this uprising failed, but it weakened the pillars of the Umayyad governance and it proceeded to the extent that Umayyad family was on the verge of being falling and it also paved the way for the anti-Umayyad uprisings subsequent to it.\n\nWandiyo, Wandiyo, Ida Suryani, and Kabib Sholeh. \"Nilai-Nilai Dealektika Hubungan Sriwijaya dengan Dinasti Umaiyah Pada Abad VIII Masehi.\" Criksetra: Jurnal Pendidikan Sejarah 9, no. 2 (August 13, 2020): 162–78. http://dx.doi.org/10.36706/jc.v9i2.10261.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstrak: Hubungan Sriwijaya dengan Dinasti Umayah sudah terjadi pada abad VIII Masehi yang ditandai dengan saling mengirimkan surat sebagai bentuk hubungan kerjasama.

Abstract: The relationship between Srivijaya and the Umayyad dynasty occurred in the VIII century AD which was marked by sending letters to each other as a form of cooperative relations. To further discuss this topic, this study raises the issue of how are the dealectical values of Srivijaya's relationship with the Umayyad dynasty. The purpose of this study was to analyze the dealectic values of the relationship of Srivijaya with the Umayyad dynasty in the VIII century AD. The method used in this study is the historical method, namely heuristics, source verification, interpretation and historiography. This study reveals the relationship of the Kingdom of Srivijaya with the Arab rulers of the Umayyad dynasty, precisely during the reign of Umar bin Abdul Aziz (717 AD) in the VII century AD. In this connection, it was proven by sending a letter by Sriwijaya to the government of Umar bin Abdul Aziz, who called him Srivijaya himself as the kingdom of the king, his own king descended from the kings. The sending of the letter happened twice, interestingly, one of the contents of the letter contained a deal from the Srivijaya king who wanted to send an ulama or expert in Islam to the Srivijaya center in Palembang. In the dealectics of the two relations there are values contained both politically, economically and religiously.Keywords: Dealectic value, Srivijaya, Umayah.\n\nGonzalez, Valerie. \"Aporia in Umayyad Art or the Degree Zero of the Visual Forms’ Meaning in Early Islam.\" Journal of Material Cultures in the Muslim World 1, no. 1-2 (February 9, 2021): 6–33. http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/26666286-12340002.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract This article re-examines the established findings about Umayyad art as a transitional production essentially anchored in the Western and Eastern Late Antique traditions that have inspired it. It argues instead that the Umayyads brought about an aesthetic revolution laying out the foundations of what has become known as “Islamic ornament,” a predominantly aniconic art form. An epistemological shift from art history to critical inquiry allows us to show that, beyond the adaptive borrowing of pre-existing forms, the Umayyads redefined the art’s condition of meaning based on an unprecedented attitude to images and visual discourse informed by Islamic ontotheology and logocentric metaphysics.\n\nTayyara, Abed el-Rahman. \"Rebellious Son.\" Al-ʿUsur al-Wusta 28, no. 1 (October 1, 2020): 116–49. http://dx.doi.org/10.52214/uw.v28i1.8411.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article concerns early representations in Arabic-Islamic sources of Ḥijāzī opposition to the dynastic succession initiated by Muʿāwiya b. Abī Sufyān shortly before his death in 41/661. The study emphasizes the importance of Qurʾānic exegesis for understanding the origin of the Ḥijāzī-Umayyad debate over rightful caliphal succession. It also demonstrates that examining how this episode is depicted in various literary genres offers a wider perspective on the construction of historical narratives in terms of provenance, protagonists, and objectives. The analysis of tafsīr interpretations of Q 46:17, which serve as the article’s underpinning, reveals that the Umayyad court promoted the view that ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Abī Bakr was the rebellious son mentioned in this verse. Depictions of this dispute in the ḥadīth, ansāb, and adab genres clearly connect Marwān b. alḤakam with this interpretation after ʿAbd al-Raḥmān questioned Muʿāwiya’s appointment of his son Yazīd as his successor. The portrayals of the Ḥijāzī-Umayyad debate in taʾrīkh accounts represent a different perspective, one that shows a transition from a tribal and provincial setting to a broader caliphal political framework. The gradual shift from a reliance on Medinan transmitters to a focus on Iraqi authorities testifies to this orientation, as does the appearance of new leading protagonists. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān’s central role as a leader of the Ḥijāzī opposition to the Umayyads in the tafsīr, ḥadīth, and adab literature becomes secondary and overshadowed by other Ḥijāzī figures, particularly ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Zubayr.\n\nTohme, Lara G. \"Out of antiquity : Umayyad baths in context.\" Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2005. http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/33740.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThesis (Ph. D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 2005.\n\n\"September 2005.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 197-223).\n\nThis dissertation explores the relationship between the art and architecture of the early Islamic period to those of pre-Islamic Bilad al-Sham (the region encompassing the modem-day countries of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Israel), and focuses on the Umayyad bathhouse as a paradigm through which this relationship is articulated. The visual culture of the Umayyad dynasty (661-750CE) is of extreme importance, not only because it constitutes the foundation of Islamic art and architecture, but more importantly because it serves as the main link in the chain of cultural transmission from the Greco- Roman and Byzantine worlds to the Medieval Islamic world. The first section of this dissertation explores the ways in which this relationship has been studied as well as the nature of the primary sources, and suggests a new method of how best to study and understand Umayyad art and architecture and their relationship to precedent and contemporaneous cultures. The second section examines the cultural, architectural and political changes in Bilad al-Sham between the fourth and eighth centuries CE, and how the events of these four centuries shaped the art, architecture and culture of the Umayyads.\n\n(cont.) The third and fourth sections concentrate on transformation of the shape and function of the bathhouse in late antiquity, and how the bathhouse was adapted to fit the needs of both pre-Islamic and Islamic late antique cultures in this region. This study concludes by suggesting that Umayyad architecture and culture can best be understood only when interpreted as part of the rich regional and cultural milieu of late antique Bilad al-Sham.\n\nby Lara G.

Late Roman Syria's continuing material prosperity, despite the ravages of plague and Persian invasion, is emphasized. Importance is also placed upon the deep-seated religious divisions among Christians, particularly those within the majority Chalcedonian community. The study examines the probable extent of social change in Syria brought about by the Islamic Conquest and Muslim Arab settlement, arguing that the administration of post-Conquest Syria owed relatively little to its predecessor. It goes on to discuss distinguishing characteristics of the Early Umayyad State, particularly its fiscal policy and military activities. It argues that the average tax rate imposed upon the non-Muslim population of Syria was soon raised substantially over Late Roman levels, proposing, in addition, that the wars fought by the Early Umayyad State to the early 660s, both external and internal, had significantly wider dimensions than are generally estimated. The religious divisions among Syrian Christians, previously considered, are examined more closely with regard to the Early Umayyad period; the study attempts to demonstrate that the Monothelete crisis and Islamic State policy combined to produce a formal division among Chalcedonians in Syria between Dyotheletes and Monotheletes during the 650s. Finally, it examines the significance of apocalyptic literature produced by eastern Christians during this period, particularly, it is argued, the Melkite community in Syria.\n\nSolaiman, G. M.

The Balqa' was a provincial area of Transjordan, which had long been part of the classical world heavily influenced by the Arab tribes of the Syrian desert. After the Arab conquest the Balqa' took on a new role as the home or some of the ruling Umayyad elite. But a process of economic, demographic and urban decline had already begun in the middle of sixth century. Even the ethnic and religious composition of the Balqa's population remained stable; the region was primarily inhabited by Christian Arabs during both the late Byzantine and the Umayyad periods. In passing from Byzantine to Umayyad control the Balqa' underwent a process of transformation, especially in regards to political matters. But the more important trend was one of continuity, even the transfer of political power from the Byzantine bureaucracy to Arab notables was but the culmination of a trend which had begun with the rise of the Ghassanids in the previous century.\n\nAnderson, Glaire D. \"The suburban villa (munya) and court culture in Umayyad Cordoba (756-976 CE).\" Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2005. http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/38861.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThesis (Ph. D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 2005.\n\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 218-241).\n\nAs the capital of the Umayyad dynasty (r. 756 CE-1031 CE), the city of Cordoba developed into one of the most renowned urban centers of the western Mediterranean. The Great Mosque of Cordoba is the outstanding testament to the architectural activities of the dynasty, yet textual and material evidence indicates that the Great Mosque was but one facet of a broader program of Umayyad patronage. The dissertation focuses on the dynasty's secular monuments - the suburban villas (Arabic munya, p. munan) constructed around the city by the Umayyad rulers and their courtiers. It analyzes the munya as a medieval architectural, landscape, and social phenomenon. By addressing issues of function, patronage, and meaning, the dissertation utilizes Cordoban villas as a vehicle for the investigation of Umayyad court society. The dissertation is divided into two parts. Part One (Chapters I-IV) defines the architectural characteristics and agricultural functions of the munya. Part Two analyzes the social functions of the Cordoban estates as settings for Umayyad court activities, and the meanings associated with estate patronage and the Umayyad construction of a villa landscape.\n\n(cont.) The dissertation contextualizes the munya within a broader constellation of Mediterranean villas and villa culture, and argues that the munya tradition informed subsequent developments in palace architecture on the Iberian Peninsula. Cordoban villas provided significant revenue for the state and patrons, supplied the court with the luxury crops considered necessary to refined life, served as settings for court activities, and demonstrated status and power among the Umayyad ruling class. The Cordoban rulers therefore attached a strong ideological importance to the estates. With the establishment of the caliphate in the tenth century, Cordoba's fertile villa landscape became entwined with Umayyad notions of sovereignty and good governance, in which a fertile landscape was conflated with political legitimacy, a theme that is also apparent in Umayyad court literature. Thus, the dissertation demonstrates that an appreciation of the many links between the villas and the Cordoban ruling class is central to comprehending Umayyad court society.\n\nby Glaire D.

Likewise, the Umayyads wanted to use various methods, especially if we knew that the Umayyad's opponents were strong in terms of their legitimacy and personality, because they were from the family of the Messenger of God. This is what made the Umayyads to search for legitimacy. One of the techniques they used is the ideas of determinism and political determinism. And the summery of the idea is, that man is a transcendent power and it is God who imposed everything on them, as well as the Umayyad's political and authority rule within that inevitable scope, so the people must accept it, and submit to it, because their authority was derived from God. To impose this idea, the Umayyads benefited from the roots of that idea that is prevalent among Muslims and had many followers who defended it."
