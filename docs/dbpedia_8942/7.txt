At its zenith, around 750 CE, the Umayyad Caliphate was one of the largest empires in history, covering over 11 million square kilometers (about 4.3 million square miles). It stretched from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus River valley in the east, encompassing large portions of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, North Africa, the Caucasus, and parts of the Indian subcontinent. This vast expanse made it one of the most significant political and cultural entities of the early medieval period, facilitating extensive trade, cultural exchange, and the spread of Islam.

The Umayyad dynasty was known for its military conquests, administrative innovations, and contributions to the arts and Islamic culture. However, internal dissent, financial troubles, and the rise of the Abbasid Revolution led to the dynasty’s downfall in 750 CE. The Umayyad Caliphate’s legacy continued in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) with the establishment of the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba, which later became the Caliphate of Córdoba, lasting until 1031 CE.

Capital of Umayyad Caliphate

The capital of the Umayyad Caliphate was Damascus, Syria. After Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan established the Umayyad dynasty in 661 CE, he moved the Islamic caliphate’s capital from Medina to Damascus. This city then served as the political, cultural, and economic center of the Umayyad Caliphate throughout its rule until the Abbasids took over in 750 CE. Damascus’s choice as the capital allowed the Umayyads to exert greater control over the vast territories of their empire, which stretched from Spain in the west to India in the east.
