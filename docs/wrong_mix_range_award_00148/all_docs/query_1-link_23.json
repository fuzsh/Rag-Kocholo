        "text": "In a career spanning poetry, theatre, journalism, painting and teaching, Derek Walcott harnessed “the complexity of his own situation” – the phrase used by the Swedish Academy when he was awarded the Nobel prize in literature in 1992. Walcott, who has died aged 87, powerfully explored the cultural and linguistic complexities of the Caribbean, where each island has its own distinct melody and vocabulary, as well as those of his own life.\n\nHe said that his work could be summarised on a postcard: “Wish you were here.” The poignant current of nostalgia that runs through his verse reflects his belief that Caribbean poetry is “very happy when it’s very sad”. Good Caribbean writing, he believed, has a strong sense of tragicomedy and a brave attitude. It does not despair easily. He described the region as a place of “unfinished associations”, bearing the amnesia that followed indenture and slavery. It is also “the territory of metaphor”, a fertile imaginative terrain, and Walcott’s work is accordingly full of symbolism, myth and folklore.\n\nHe chronicled life’s journeys with compassion and tenderness. His poem Another Life (1973) captures that sense of journey in an apt metaphor, the open and closed book:\n\nVerandahs, where the pages of the sea\n\nare a book left open by an absent\n\nmaster\n\nin the middle of another life –\n\nI begin here again,\n\nbegin until this ocean’s\n\na shut book, and like a bulb\n\nthe white moon’s filaments wane.\n\nWalcott was born in Castries, St Lucia, in the British West Indies. His birthplace had a profound influence on his writing, which is rich in evocative descriptions of the dramatic landscape. His mother, Alix, was a teacher at the town’s Methodist school. His father, Warwick, was a civil servant and died the year after Derek was born. Derek had a twin brother, Roderick, and an older sister, Pamela. At an early age, he knew that he wanted to continue his father’s work as a painter and poet. His mother, an amateur actor, relentlessly recited Shakespeare to him as a child.\n\nAt the age of 17, Walcott declared to his mother that he wanted to publish a book of poetry. She funded Twenty-Five Poems (1948), which he modelled on Faber editions. “She was so open-hearted, she thought it was OK to be a writer. But to want to be a writer in St Lucia in that time was a very brave thing to want to do,” he explained at the Hay festival in 2007.\n\nAlix also inspired Walcott’s career in education. Upon finishing his studies in 1947 at St Mary’s college in St Lucia, he immediately became an assistant master there. He received a scholarship to attend the University College of the West Indies, in Mona, Jamaica, where he earned a BA degree. Until 1957, he worked as a schoolteacher at Grenada boys’ secondary school and at Jamaica college, Kingston.\n\nAfter self-publishing his first books, he despaired of attracting a publisher, but Alan Ross, the editor of the London Magazine, who had published some of Walcott’s work, successfully presented a collection of his poems to Jonathan Cape. While his early work was imitative of the English poets he admired – Shakespeare, Auden, MacNeice – Walcott gradually developed a distinctive style of his own. His breakthrough collection was In a Green Night: Poems 1948-60 (1962). The collection includes Prelude, which opens with these lines:\n\nI, with legs crossed along the daylight,\n\nwatch\n\nThe variegated fists of clouds that\n\ngather over\n\nThe uncouth features of this, my prone\n\nisland.\n\nThroughout his work, he would be in this position: the observer chronicling the minute peculiarities of his beloved island as well as his departure and the emotions that it wrought. In the mid-1950s he moved to Trinidad, where he worked as a theatre and art critic. He would publish more than 20 plays, including the allegorical Dream on Monkey Mountain (an Obie award winner in 1971), and he also founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop (in 1959, after a year spent studying theatre in the US) and in 1981 the Boston Playwrights’ theatre at Boston University. He criticised the dominance of London as the centre of the theatrical world. His academic positions in the US included periods at Columbia University and Harvard University in the early 1980s.\n\nWalcott’s Methodism perhaps fuelled his dedication to hard work, but he would still wait for poems to arrive, without trying to force them. He believed, with Robert Graves, that a poem first comes in a line and a half, a musical phrase, that then has to be filled. His work combined ambitious scale with minute detail. His epic poem Omeros (1990), described by the New Yorker as “Walcott’s masterpiece”, draws on Homer’s The Iliad and The Odyssey to voice the story of the Caribbean people.\n\nWalcott illuminated the experience of both time and place in the Caribbean. On place, he said: “You can’t wake up in the Caribbean without looking out of the window with a sense of astonishment in the renewal that you see. I feel blessed in that sense.” On time, he said: “The landscape doesn’t have narrative, it has present tense all the time. There’s a different scansion, a different measure. We don’t have seasons. Everything is bright, all the time. It’s an eternal summer. If you don’t have those divisions that are there in other climates, how do you scan time? What happens to your philosophy? Your history? Your art? You’re working with a perpetual ‘is’, you’re working with renewed astonishment.”\n\nIn 2000 he combined his loves of painting and poetry in the publication Tiepolo’s Hound, which featured his own artworks alongside the story – told in verse – of Camille Pissarro. His appreciation of teaching as well as writing also remained until his final years: in 2009, he took up the post in Canada as the University of Alberta’s inaugural distinguished scholar in residence. That year, he withdrew his candidacy to be professor of poetry at Oxford University after what he denounced as “a low and degrading attempt at character assassination” against him. Anonymous packages were sent to Oxford academics, extracting details from the book The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus, by Billie Wright Dziech and Linda Weiner, which described a sexual harassment case brought against Walcott by a student at Harvard in the early 80s. When it emerged that his rival for the post, Ruth Padel, had emailed journalists to draw attention to the book, she resigned after only days in the post.\n\nAnother private rift to be made public was with VS Naipaul, whom he dubbed VS Nightfall. In his book A Writer’s People (2007), Naipaul suggested that Walcott had gone stale. The following year, Walcott read The Mongoose, a poem about Naipaul, at a literary festival. It opened: “I have been bitten. I must avoid infection / Or else I’ll be as dead as Naipaul’s fiction.”\n\nWalcott’s many awards included the WH Smith literary award for Omeros and the TS Eliot prize for his “technically flawless” collection White Egrets (2010). His later work – the evocative plays Moon-Child (2012) and O Starry Starry Night (2013), and a collaboration with the painter Peter Doig, Morning, Paramin (2016) – revealed that his great talent for experimenting with and innovating artistic form remained undiminished.\n\nHis three marriages, to Faye Moston, Margaret Maillard and Norline Metivier, ended in divorce. He is survived by his partner, Sigrid Nama, a son, Peter, from his first marriage, and two daughters, Anna and Elizabeth, from his second.\n\nAnita Sethi\n\nLawrence Scott writes: In 1979, as stage manager, I sat next to Derek Walcott rehearsing his play Remembrance in the back rooms of the Normandie hotel, Port of Spain. Each direction in each scene was like a line of poetry rehearsed over and over to hold the emotion of the moment. I then stood on the boards of the Little Carib theatre in Port of Spain in his musical Marie Laveau in 1980, awaiting each precise move and timing for the comic part I was playing. He loved working with actors.\n\n“Shorter poems better,” he once told me at a master class. Then, scanning my lines: “What about leaving out every other line in the longer ones?” He laughed. Two poems were reshaped, his pen making their corrections. It was in those moments that I knew him best, felt his warmth and affection – a teacher. He admired teachers. I remember him asking with that condoning tone, “You teaching?” Nodding his approval. I knew that voice of Derek’s, that St Lucian/Trinidadian tone, that tonal authenticity of his poems, the lines of his plays, felt in the brush strokes of his watercolours.\n\nIn 2013 we were together at the Lakeside theatre at Essex University, where he was visiting professor, with a full house gathered for O Starry Starry Night, with a cast of mainly Trinidadian actors: Brian Green, Wendell Manwarren, Martina Laird and Nigel Scott. Derek expressed his pleasure in bringing these actors together. Meeting outside Trinidad, there was always a sense of joy at finding compatriots, as if he had been lost and had suddenly found himself in finding them. He was private, complex in his responses, stricken by the melancholia that pervades much of his poetry. Yet, he was a wit, quick with Trinidadian picong: repartee, puns, jokes. But it was the work that always mattered, and he was a hard taskmaster when things were not going the way he wanted them. He remained, till the end, passionate about the new writing from our Caribbean."
