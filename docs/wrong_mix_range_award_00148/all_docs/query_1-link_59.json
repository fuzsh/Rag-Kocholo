In fact, I even split with one of my old friends because he thought most of my reading was not sufficiently dogmatic in a Marxist sense. Of course, he read about eight books a year, while I typically read somewhere between 150 and 160. Call me ugly, call me fat, call me vicious even—but don’t attack my reading choices.\n\nHere are seven authors whose work I have read this year who are relatively unknown even to more literate readers, but they are all excellent writers. And several of them have won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nIvo Andrić (1892-1975). Bosnian Serb.1921-1996) Nobel Prize. Most famous work: The Bridge on the Drina.\n\nNicolas Bouvier (1929-1998). Swiss. Travel writer. Most famous work: The Way of the World.\n\nGeorge Mackay Brown (1921-1996). Scottish from the Orkneys. Poet and fiction writer. Most famous work: Collected Poetry.\n\nPatricia Highsmith (1921-1995). American. Mysteries. Most famous work: Strangers on a Train.\n\nLászlo Krasznahorkai (1954-Present). Hungarian. Novelist. Most famous work: The Melancholy of Resistance.\n\nPatrick Modiano (1945-Present). French. Novelist. Nobel Prize. Most famous work: Pedigree.\n\nDerek Walcott (1930-2017). Caribbean. Poet. Nobel Prize. Most famous work: Omeros.\n\nIf you recognize two or more of the above writers, you have my congratulations. I have read multiple works of five of the above. I plan to read more by Bouvier and Walcott in the coming six months.\n\nRate this:\n\nAn Islander Recalls Cythera\n\nI am always enchanted by poems based on paintings that I love. And my favorite painting of the Eighteenth Century is Antoine Watteau’s “The Embarkation for Cythera,” a promise of love in the offing, but no delivery for certain. Cythera, or Kythira, is an island off the Peloponnese. The following poem was written by another islander, from Saint Lucia in the Caribbean, namely Derek Walcott. It is poem XX in the sequence of his collection Midsummer and called simply “Watteau”:\n\nThe amber spray of trees feather-brushed with the dusk, the ruined cavity of some spectral château, the groin of a leering satyr eaten with ivy. In the distance, the grain of some unreapable, alchemical harvest, the hollow at the heart of all embarkations. Nothing stays green in that prodigious urging towards twilight; in all of his journeys the pilgrims are in fever from the tremulous strokes of malaria’s laureate. So where is Cythera? It, too, is far and feverish, it dilates on the horizon of his near-delirium, near and then further, it can break like the spidery rigging of his ribboned barquentines, it is as much nowhere as these broad-leafed islands, it is the disease of elephantine vegetation in Baudelaire, the tropic bug in the Paris fog. For him, it is the mirror of what it is. Paradise is life repeated spectrally, an empty chair echoing the emptiness.\n\nRate this:\n\nOutstanding, Good, So-So, Stinko\n\nI have completed my Januarius Project for January 2022. Just to remind you, I typically reserve an entire month at or near the beginning of the year to introduce myself to authors whose work I have not hitherto read. Below is the summary, beginning with the best books and ending with the one stinko book.\n\nOutstanding\n\nMartha Gellhorn, Travels with Myself and Another. She might be Ernest Hemingway’s ex-wife, and she may well be as good if not better than her former hubby.\n\nM F K Fischer, Two Towns in Provence. Consists of two parts, a great book on Aix-en-Provence, and a merely very very good book on Marseilles.\n\nSaint Augustine, Confessions. I’d put this one off for decades, but it is really great, especially the chapter about time.\n\nKenzaburo Oe, A Personal Matter. A Nobel Prizewinner I will have to read more of.\n\nBen Loory, Stories for the Nighttime and Some for the Day. A great original short story collection of fantasy and horror.\n\nGeoffrey Moorhouse, The Fearful Void. A solo journey across the width of the Sahara that didn’t pan out, though this book about it certainly did.\n\nDerek Walcott, Midsummer. A Nobel Prizewinning poet from the Caribbean. Super stuff.\n\nGood\n\nAngela Carter, The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography. What the Marquis and Pornhub have in common.\n\nNic Pizzolatto, Galveston. A promising neo-noir author.\n\nEdward Whittemore, Quin’s Shanghai Circus. Wild, exotic, and interesting.\n\nEric Jager, The Last Duel: A True Story of Crime, Scandal, and Trial by Combat. The 2021 Ridley Scott movie was based on this medieval thriller.\n\nRoger Shattuck, The Banquet Years: Origins of the Avante-Garde in France 1885 to World War I. How four French artists (a painter, a composer, a poet, and a playwright) influenced modern art.\n\nSo-So\n\nPete Beatty, Cuyahoga. A weird fantasy on the early history of Cleveland, the city of my birth.\n\nMeghan Abbott, Die a Little. Vaguely promising, but typical of a New Yorker who knows very little about L.A.\n\nPeter Theroux, Translating LA: A Tour of the Rainbow City. Better than most, but nearly so good as his brother Paul’s work.\n\nStinko\n\nWilliam Beckford, Vathek. This 1786 oriental fantasy is still studied in college. Why?\n\nAll in all, this year’s Januarius project was a rousing success. Twelve out of the sixteen authors I read for the first time are worth following up on in the months and years to come.\n\nRate this:\n\nA Syrian or an Assyrian\n\nThe following poem by Derek Walcott is from his collection entitled Midsummer. Born on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, Walcott won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992 and passed away in 2017. The name of the poem is the Roman numeral LIII (not to be confused with Super Bowl LIII):\n\nThere was one Syrian, with his bicycle, in our town.\n\nI didn’t know if he was a Syrian or an Assyrian.\n\nWhen I asked him his race, about which Saroyan had written\n\nthat all that was left were seventy thousand Assyrians,\n\nwhere were sixty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine?\n\nhe didn’t answer, but smiled at the length of our street.\n\nHis pupils flashed like the hot spokes of a chariot,\n\nor the silver wires of his secondhand machine.\n\nI should have asked him about the patterns of birds\n\nmigrating in Aramaic, or the correct\n\npronunciation of wrinkled rivers like “Tagus.”\n\nAssyria was far as the ancient world that was taught us,\n\nbut then, so was he, from his hot-skinned camels and tents.\n\nI was young and direct and my tense\n\nwas the present; if I, in my ignorance,\n\nhad distorted time, it was less than some tyrant’s\n\nindifference that altered his future.\n\nHe wore a white shirt. A black hat. His bicycle\n\nhad an iron basket in front. It moved through the mirage\n\nof sugar-cane fields, crediting suits to the cutters.\n\nNext, two more Syrians appeared. All three shared a store\n\nbehind which they slept. After that, there was\n\na sign with that name, so comical to us, of mythical\n\nspade-bearded, anointed, and ringleted kings: ABDUL.\n\nBut to me there were still only seventy thousand\n\nAssyrians, and all of them lived next door\n\nin a hot dark room, muttering a language whose sound\n\nhad winged lions in it, and birds cut into a wall.\n\nRate this:"
