        "text": "The paper examines the paradoxes of pain and joy in Derek Walcott's fragmented and hybrid identities and racial and colonial tensions in his poetry. It also deals with Walcott's celebration of the hybridity and cosmopolitanism of Caribbean culture. The paper shows how Walcott never loses sight of his colonial past and how he remains critical of the forces shaping the future of his own culture. The paper points out how he confronts the conflicts of his European and African ancestry from the perspective of postcolonial reality. The paper makes a postcolonial analysis of Derek Walcott's one earlier poem, \"A Far Cry from Africa\" (In a Green Night: Poems, 1948-60, 1962) and two later poems, \"Names\" (Sea Grapes, 1976) and \"The Sea is History\" (The Star-Apple Kingdom, 1979) to highlight his search for a Caribbean history while exploring the racial, cultural and colonial tensions embedded in his Caribbean identity. It also shows the historical and political contexts in which he wrote these poems.\n\nThis book focuses on Derek Walcott's literary and artistic wor(l)d. Western postcolonial critique has depicted the Nobel Prize laureate as one of the greatest poets of the 20th century world. This, however, devalues his fundamental contribution to the realm of Caribbean theatre and art. The text examines Walcott's multimodal production, a combination of West Indian folkloric forms and Western-oriented structures and themes, by discussing three of his works - two plays, The Joker of Seville and Pantomime, and a long poem, Tiepolo's Hound. These epitomise respectively a response to Spanish, English, and French cultural legacies in the New World as postcolonial re-writings of Don Juan, Robinson Crusoe, and Camille Pissarro's stories. Following Quijano and Mignolo's decolonial approaches and Riane Eisler's partnership perspective, the book uncovers the strategies used by Walcott to respond to the colonial matrix of power.\n\nDerek Walcott’s work lends itself to the analysis and evaluation of a plethora of themes and perspectives. This paper seeks to analyze and evaluate the notion of visual imagination in the poetic works of this renowned scholar. The paper looks specifically at three poems in his work, Collected Poems 1948-1984. The poems include ‘Egypt Tobago’, ‘Ruins of a Great House’ and ‘Jean Rhys’. These works will be evaluated with a view to critiquing the extent of their reality, relevance and application in the context of the Caribbean’s landscape and soul. They will also be analyzed with reference to the poems that have been chosen for this presentation. The paper will be examined from a discourse analysis approach, where patterns and variations that stem from these patterns will be assessed.\n\nCritics have frequently addressed the theme of betrayal that runs throughoutDerek Walcott's poetry due to leaving St. Lucia, the island where he was born. Walcott's poetrypresentsconfused characters, divided between their desire forreturning home and the temperament for travelling and adventure.Thisstudy questions the role ofthe socio-political conditionsof the post-independence Caribbean in motivating artists to live abroad. The Caribbean gained independence in the beginning of the 1960s, and confrontedserioustrialsto become a nation throughout the 1970s. Thecritiqueexamines Walcott'sdirect attack on the Caribbean cultureinsome of his most important poems, where the persona is either visiting or leaving his native island.He is a quester who mirrorsthe poet'sanger at the people's difficulties, political corruption, social climbing, and discrimination based on class and colour.\n\nThe aim of this paper is of explore the ambivalence in the poetry of Walcott. Walcott presents postcolonial and multicultural ambivalence in his poetry; that is, his poetry demonstrates the Caribbean people \" s love and hate of the colonizer \" s culture. As he is the son of both Anglo-European and the Afro-Caribbean heritage he is divided in his own identity. We find both attraction and revulsion towards the English culture and language all through his poems. There is common style in his poetry that he tries to reduce the gap between the colonizers and colonized. It is true that sometimes he articulates his misery as a divided self but this is not to attack the colonizer but to reveal his crisis and his recommendation is to universalize the ideas. An endeavour is made below to discover Walcott \" s ambivalent in his poetry.\n\nAlthough one is always ultimately engrossed in the primary world of Walcott\\u27s poems and plays, there is also, as a kind of referential reflex, the contrary motion of glimpsing and seeking thematic and even stylistic interconnections, parallels and contrasts within the secondary world of his essays, articles, published talks, and interviews. Walcott\\u27s Stockholm acceptance speech, \\u27The Antilles: Fragments of Epic Memory\\u27/ is at the very least a further valuable contribution to the debate on the nature of West Indian literary culture. But the fact of the Nobel Prize, however cynical we might normally be about the possible motivation of the selection committee from year to year, and the fact that Walcott was perfectly prepared to accept the honour and write the mandatory lecture, may lead us to look at its text with a more broadly enquiring eye. He was, after all, not just addressing his immediate audience in Stockholm; he was speaking to and for the world of all those for w...\n\nAbstract Walcott has been a melting pot of ambivalence, hybridity and identity crisis. Walcott’s ambivalence is evident in his themes, choice of language and rhetorical devices etc. His ardent love for Caribbean land, its people and language has been frequently uttered through his emotional voice in his poems. At the same time, he possesses a divided societal position living overseas with appreciation for Western society and love for universal appeal of English language. However, he criticizes the brutality of the colonizers for their imperialistic attitude and torture. This has thrown him into ambivalence of choice and disapproval, acceptance and rejection, and love and hatred. Ambivalence is, thus, ever-present a spectre in his poems as well as in his divided self. The article aims at exploring Walcott’s expression of ambivalence, duality, hybridity and postcolonial dilemma in manifesting identity. Keywords: Ambivalence, Hybridity, Dilemma, Postcolonial, Divided Self etc\n\nCaribbean poet Derek Walcott , in his commitment to the Caribbean and, of course, with artistic excellence, disappointingly finds his nation still confined to marginalization which is self-imposed, though it was colonially imposed during the colonial period. The issues contributing to this self-imposed marginalization, an otherwise colonial legacy, are the exigent factors Walcott’s relentless poetic efforts address. This paper aims at exploring how Walcott ’s unalloyed poetic dedication of epistemological siginificance, with a view to strengthening the Antillean from within, concentrates on the marginalized nation’s unconscious, imprudent and self-centred thoughts and measures in the issues of Caribbean self, tourism, urbanization, governance, literary tradition and uniqueness of literature in a post-colonial context of agressive Euro-American economy and culture."
