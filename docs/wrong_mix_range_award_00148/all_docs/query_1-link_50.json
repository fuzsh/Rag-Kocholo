        "text": "Derek Walcott (b. 1930) is a St. Lucian poet and artist who in 1992 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is also an Obie-winning playwright, the recipient of a MacArthur “genius” grant, and was knighted in 1972. Walcott’s most famous work is the epic poem Omeros, published in 1990.\n\n“Good science and good art are always about a condition of awe … I don’t think there is any other function for the poet or the scientist in the human tribe but the astonishment of the soul.”\n\nSource: Uncommon Genius: How Great Ideas are Born (Penguin, 1990), pp. 176(via WikiQuote)\n\nPhoto credit: “Derek Walcott” by Bert Nienhuis – File of the Werkgroep Caraibische Letteren, The Netherlands. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nWe must get happiness right — even when the world around us gets it wrong.\n\nA perfect map is as useless as it is impossible to create.\n\nA longstanding mismatch between theory and experiment motivated an exquisite muon measurement. At last, a theoretical solution has arrived.\n\nPropofol, a drug commonly used for general anesthesia, derails the brain’s normal balance between stability and excitability.\n\nAn analysis of Indonesian cave paintings is reframing the history of human art, though whether the paintings really were created by human hands remains an open question."
