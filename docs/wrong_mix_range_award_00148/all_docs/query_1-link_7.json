        "text": "Derek Walcott\n\nPoetry\n\nThe 1992 Nobel Laureate in Literature Derek Walcott reads his poem ‘Sea Grapes’ from “Collected Poems 1948-1984”. The video was recorded at Harvard University in April, 2005.\n\nTwo poems by Derek Walcott\n\nSea Grapes\n\nThat sail which leans on light,\n\ntired of islands,\n\na schooner beating up the Caribbean\n\nfor home, could be Odysseus,\n\nhome-bound on the Aegean;\n\nthat father and husband’s\n\nlonging, under gnarled sour grapes, is like\n\nthe adulterer hearing Nausicaa’s name in\n\nevery gull’s outcry.\n\nThis brings nobody peace. The ancient war\n\nbetween obsession and responsibility will\n\nnever finish and has been the same\n\nfor the sea-wanderer or the one on shore now\n\nwriggling on his sandals to walk home, since\n\nTroy sighed its last flame,\n\nand the blind giant’s boulder heaved the trough from\n\nwhose groundswell the great hexameters come to the\n\nconclusions of exhausted surf.\n\nThe classics can console. But not enough.\n\n“Sea Grapes” from COLLECTED POEMS 1948-1984\n\nby Derek Walcott.\n\nCopyright © 1986 by Derek Walcott.\n\nUsed by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nCAUTION: Users are warned that this work is protected under copyright laws and downloading is strictly prohibited.

The choir’s\n\nsky-high praise\n\nturned off. A book\n\nof prints that turns\n\nby itself. The ticktock\n\nof high heels on a sidewalk.\n\nA crawling clock.\n\nA craving for work.\n\n“Fame” from THE ARKANSAS TESTAMENT by Derek Walcott.\n\nCopyright © 1987 by Derek Walcott.\n\nUsed by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nCAUTION: Users are warned that this work is protected under copyright laws and downloading is strictly prohibited.
