        "text": "A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt\n\nOf Africa, Kikuyu, quick as flies,\n\nBatten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.\n\nCorpses are scattered through a paradise.\n\nOnly the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:\n\n“Waste no compassion on these separate dead!”\n\nStatistics justify and scholars seize\n\nThe salients of colonial policy.\n\nWhat is that to the white child hacked in bed?\n\nTo savages, expendable as Jews?\n\nThreshed out by beaters, the long rushes break\n\nIn a white dust of ibises whose cries\n\nHave wheeled since civilization’s dawn\n\nFrom the parched river or beast-teeming plain.\n\nThe violence of beast on beast is read\n\nAs natural law, but upright man\n\nSeeks his divinity by inflicting pain.\n\nDelirious as these worried beasts, his wars\n\nDance to the tightened carcass of a drum,\n\nWhile he calls courage still that native dread\n\nOf the white peace contracted by the dead.\n\nAgain brutish necessity wipes its hands\n\nUpon the napkin of a dirty cause, again\n\nA waste of our compassion, as with Spain,\n\nThe gorilla wrestles with the superman.\n\nI who am poisoned with the blood of both,\n\nWhere shall I turn, divided to the vein?\n\nI who have cursed\n\nThe drunken officer of British rule, how choose\n\nBetween this Africa and the English tongue I love?\n\nBetray them both, or give back what they give?\n\nHow can I face such slaughter and be cool?\n\nHow can I turn from Africa and live?\n\nFrom IN A GREEN NIGHT (Jonathan Cape, 1962)\n\nThe time will come\n\nwhen, with elation,\n\nyou will greet yourself arriving\n\nat your own door, in your own mirror,\n\nand each will smile at the other’s welcome,\n\nand say, sit here. Eat.\n\nYou will love again the stranger who was your self.\n\nGive win. Give bread. Give back your heart\n\nto itself, to the stranger who has loved you\n\nall your life, whom you ignored\n\nfor another, who knows you by heart.\n\nTake down the love letters from the bookshelf,\n\nthe photographs, the desperate notes,\n\npeel your own image from the mirror.\n\nSit. Feast on your life.\n\nFrom SEA GRAPES (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1976)\n\n(For Stephen Spender)\n\nSomewhere a white horse gallops with its mane\n\nplunging round a field whose sticks\n\nare ringed with barbed wire, and men\n\nbreak stones or bind straw into ricks.\n\nSomewhere women tire of the shawled sea’s\n\nweeping, for the fishermen’s dories\n\nstill go out. It is blue as peace.\n\nSomewhere they’re tired of torture stories.\n\nThat somewhere there was an arrest.\n\nSomewhere there was a small harvest\n\nof bodies in the truck.Soldiers rest\n\nsomewhere by a road, or smoke in a forest.\n\nSomewhere there is the conference rage\n\nat an outrage.Somewhere a page\n\nis torn out, and somehow the foliage\n\nno longer looks like leaves but camouflage.\n\nSomewhere there is a comrade,\n\na writer lying with his eyes wide open\n\non mattress ticking, who will not read\n\nthis, or write. How to make a pen?\n\nAnd here we are free for a while, but\n\nelsewhere, in one-third, or one-seventh\n\nof this planet, a summary rifle butt\n\nbreaks a skull into the idea of a heaven\n\nwhere nothing is free, where blue air\n\nis paper-frail, and whatever we write\n\nwill be stamped twice, a blue letter,\n\nits throat slit by the paper knife of the state.\n\nThrough these black bars\n\nhollowed faces stare. Fingers\n\ngrip the cross bars of these stanzas\n\nand it is here, because somewhere else\n\ntheir stares fog into oblivion\n\nthinly, like the faceless numbers\n\nthat bewilder you in your telephone\n\ndiary. Like last year’s massacres.\n\nThe world is blameless. The darker crime\n\nis to make a career of conscience,\n\nto feel through our own nerves the silent scream\n\nof winter branches, wonders read as signs.\n\nFrom THE ARKANSAS TESTAMENT (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1987)"
