        "text": "Rochester alumni and faculty have to date received a total of 13 Nobel Prizes, across a range of categories that includes physics, medicine or physiology, and economics.\n\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to National Institutes of Health scientist Harvey Alter for work that has led to diagnostic tests and treatments for a life-threatening form of hepatitis. He shared the prize with British scientist Michael Houghton and Rockefeller University scientist Charles Rice.\n\nThe Nobel committee cited the scientists “for the discovery of Hepatitis C virus.” “Thanks to their discovery, highly sensitive blood tests for the virus are now available and these have essentially eliminated post-transfusion hepatitis in many parts of the world, greatly improving global health,” the committee noted.\n\nAlter, who holds BA and MD degrees from Rochester, is the 13th Nobel laureate with ties to the University.\n\nHere’s a look at all of Rochester’s Nobel Prize recipients:\n\n2020 Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nHarvey Alter ’56, ’60M (MD), discovery of Hepatitis C virus\n\n2020 Nobel Prize laureate Harvey Alter ’56, ’60M (MD) received the University’s highest alumni award in 2015 (University photo / J. Adam Fenster)\n\n2018 Prize in Physics\n\nDonna Strickland ’89 (PhD) and Gérard Mourou, developers of “chirped-pulse amplification” in lasers\n\nGérard Mourou, left, photographed in Rochester in 1987, and Donna Strickland ’89 (PhD), seen aligning an optical fiber in her lab in Rochester in 1985. The pair shared half of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics “for their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.” (University photos)\n\n2018 Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nPaul Romer, developer of the endogenous growth theory\n\nPaul Romer, a former assistant professor of economics at Rochester, was recognized as a pioneer of the endogenous growth theory, which integrates technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis. (TT News Agency via AP photos)\n\n2017 Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nRichard Thaler ’74 (PhD), one of the founders of behavioral economics.\n\nRichard Thaler ’74 (PhD), a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and one of the founders of the discipline of behavioral economics, receives an honorary doctor of science degree from the University of Rochester in 2010. (University photo / J.
