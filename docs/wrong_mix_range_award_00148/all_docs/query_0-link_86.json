        "text": "From the President's Desk\n\nFirst, I want to thank all of you who were able to attend one of the sessions with the search consultants from Academic Search, Inc., who were on campus yesterday and today to begin the process of the search for the College's next provost and dean of the college. The provost and dean of the college serves as the chief academic officer and convenes the President's Cabinet when the President is not available to meet. Needless to say, the search process will be important to all of us, and it will be crucial for all of us to support the Search Committee in its work. Dr. Darrell Jodock, professor of religion and Drell and Adeline Bernhardson Distinguished Professor, was elected by the committee to serve as chair; his leadership and knowledge of the College and our community will be invaluable to the process. Other committee members are Sidonia Alenuma-Nimoh, assistant professor of education; Tom Annesley (board), professor of pathology, University of Michigan; Keisha Bates (student); Becky Bergman (board), vice president, new therapies and diagnostics, Medtronic, Inc.; Leila Brammer, professor of communication studies; Kirk Carlson, associate director of admission and financial aid; Eric Dugdale, associate professor of classics; Gwen Freed, vice president for marketing and communication; Maya Jayawardena (student); Steve Mellema, professor of physics; Doug Nimmo, professor of music; Jeff Owen, assistant professor of economics and management; Jeff Stocco, vice president for student affairs and dean of students; Linnea Wren, professor of art and art history; and Jolene Christensen, assistant to the president and secretary to the committee. I hope you will join me in thanking them for their willingness to serve. In the coming days and weeks, Dr. Jodock will share with all of us periodic updates on the progress of the committee's work. Thank you for your support of this important process. ~President Ohle\n\nNews & Announcements\n\nLetters Sought for Tenure Candidates...

The consulting firm of Spelman & Johnson has been engaged by the College to help with the search for the next vice president for student life and dean of students. The consultant, Peter Rosenberg, will be on campus next week visiting with a number of groups and individuals. He looks forward to talking with you regarding your perspectives about future needs and priorities of the College that will be helpful in his work with the Search Committee and with prospective candidates. One open session for administrators and staff is slated for Wednesday, Sept. 29, at 2:30 p.m. in the Three Crowns Room. An open session for faculty has been scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. 29, at 3:30 p.m. in the Three Crowns Room.\n\nWe hope you will be available to visit with the consultant about this important search.\n\nBack by Popular Demand... The Hand-Felted Scandinavian Slipper Class will be held during the \"Fall Fest at the Arb,\" Saturday, Oct. 9, from 1 to 4 p.m. in the Interpretive Center. Use natural fiber roving to employ a wet-felting technique and custom-make your very own slippers. This felting method does not require knitting.

Contact Kathy at kerlands@gustavus.edu to register or call 507-933-6514 with questions.\n\nFlu Shot Clinic for Employees... On Wednesday, Oct. 13, from 7:30 a.m. through 12:30 p.m., the College is offering a flu shot clinic for employees in Alumni Hall. The cost is $25, which may be paid by cash or check or billed to your insurance. If you would like the vaccine billed to your insurance, you will need to bring your card to the Flu Shot Clinic; you will also need to provide the policy holder’s name, address, and date of birth. Spouses, domestic partners, and dependents over the age of 18 may also receive the vaccine at the Employee Flu Shot Clinic. This year’s flu shot will protect against Influenza A, Influenza B, and H1N1 Influenza. The flu (influenza) is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection that is spread from person to person primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes. After a person is infected with the virus, symptoms usually appear in 2-4 days. The symptoms include fever, chills, headache, dry cough, congestion, and muscle aches. Unlike the common cold, influenza can cause extreme fatigue lasting several days to more than a week. All flu shots administered will contain inactivated virus. You CANNOT get the flu from this. PREVENTION IS KEY!\n\nGet an annual flu shot.\n\nWash hands FREQUENTLY! Use soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer.\n\nCover your cough! Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve (not your hand).\n\nAvoid sharing food, drinks, water bottles, or personal items with others.\n\nHave tissues readily available.\n\nStay home if you are sick. Do not “tough it out” and come to work, classes, or practice if you are ill, especially if you have a fever and are coughing or sneezing. You are exposing others when doing so.\n\nQuestions? Stop by Health Service or call (ext. 7630).\n\nPhotography Requests and Image Library... With the school year beginning, take a moment to think about the photography needs in your area for Gustavus marketing and communication purposes (e.g., external marketing pieces, such as brochures, ads, newsletters, or websites, that will enhance the image of Gustavus and especially help with recruitment and fundraising goals). As in the past, Stacia Vogel (mktng. & comm.) can work with you on such requests to meet your needs and the College's. To best fit the situation and the budget, it may mean hiring a professional from off campus, or assigning a student photographer from our area or another member of the marketing and communication team, or perhaps sharing one of the office's cameras with you (or another staff member or volunteer in your area). Stacia is happy to train you and others to use the camera equipment to shoot the images to meet your intended outcomes. To help with scheduling, please submit each photo request in a timely fashion using the online Photo Request Form at: gustavus.edu/marketing/photorequest.php. The form is very simple and only takes a few minutes. Please submit photography requests four weeks prior to the date needed. If it's less than a four-week window of time, please submit an online request and then follow up with an immediate phone call. If you have any questions, please contact Stacia directly. If you'd like to access Gustavus's online image library to look through some existing Gustavus photographs, please visit the website gustavus.widencollective.com, click on \"Create User,\" and follow the prompts. Questions on either of these should be directed to Stacia Vogel (stacia@gustavus.edu, x6395) in the Office of Marketing and Communication.\n\nCampus Happenings\n\nChapel Schedule...
