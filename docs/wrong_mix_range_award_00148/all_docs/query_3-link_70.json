        "text": "Richard Feynman was a Nobel-prizewinning US theoretical physicist. Famed for his brilliant mind and mercurial personality, his main work was in quantum physics and particle physics, where he is particularly known for the Feynman diagram, a way of depicting particle processes graphically. But he was a prolific writer and thinker who also pioneered ideas in quantum computing and nanotechnology. In his last years, he gained widespread public fame as a prominent and outspoken member of the commission investigating the fatal Challenger Space Shuttle disaster.\n\nFeynman first made a scientific name for himself as a member of the Manhattan project to build the nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 at the end of the second world war.\n\nHowever, the scientific work for which Feynman is most noted came in the decades immediately following the second world war, when he was a key player in developing the theory of quantum electrodynamics, or QED. This is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force, and explains how charged particles such as electrons interact by exchanging photons of light. In 1965, Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel prize in physics with Julian Schwinger and Shin’ichirō Tomonaga for “fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles”.\n\nFeynman diagrams were part of this work. They provide a way to visually represent the complex interactions underlying quantum field theory, including “virtual” particles popping up out of nowhere from a quantum vacuum, without using the full complex mathematical machinery of the theory. The later Nobel prizewinner Frank Wilczek once said that many breakthroughs in particle physics, for example establishing how the Higgs boson, the particle that gives all other fundamental particles their mass, could be produced and observed, would have been “literally unthinkable” without Feynman diagrams.\n\nThe Great Explainer\n\nFeynman was a tireless educator and populariser of physics across the board. The Feynman Lectures on Physics, which he originally gave to undergraduates at the California Institute of Technology in the 1960s, sealed his reputation as The Great Explainer, and remain a staple of many university physics courses today. His computational skill was matched by his love of the bongo drums, his pranks and his witty barbs. Ironically, perhaps his most famous quote – “If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics” – has no written source.\n\nFeynman’s first wife Arline died of tuberculosis in 1945. Following her death, and his qualms about the use of the nuclear weapons he had helped to develop, he experienced a deep depression. His relationship with women was generally complex, including two further marriages, bouts of womanising and the visiting of sex workers, which he detailed in two best-selling volumes of reminiscences, Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! (1985) and What Do You Care What Other People Think? (1988). For many, this has come to cast a shadow over his considerable and wide-ranging scientific achievements.\n\nHis scientific expertise was most notoriously put on public display as an initially reluctant member of the Rogers Commission established to investigate the causes of the 1986 Challenger disaster, in which seven crew members of the space shuttle, including school teacher Christa McAuliffe, died when it exploded shortly after take-off."
