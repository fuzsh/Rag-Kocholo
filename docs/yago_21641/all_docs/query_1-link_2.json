        "text": "Bud’s Recruit (1918)\n\nProduction Company: Boy City Film Co. (General Film Co., distributor). Producer/Writer: Judge Willis Brown. Director: King Vidor. Cast: Wallis Brennan (Bud Gilbert), Robert Gordon (Reggie Gilbert, his older brother), Ruth Hampton (Edith, Reggie’s sweetheart), Mildred Davis (Edith’s sister). Transfer Note: Copied at 19 frames per second from a 35mm negative preserved by the UCLA Film & Television Archive, with video tinting reproducing the original print colors; 2 reels. New Score: Martin Marks. Running Time: 26 minutes.\n\nThis two-reel home-front story, the earliest surviving film from King Vidor, is a pointed World War I tale about a boy who sets a patriotic example for his family. It is also the first film from the Boy City Film Company of Judge Willis Brown, former Utah juvenile court justice and founder of “Boy Cities” for the homeless. The goal of the company, which ran a studio and homeless shelter in Culver City, California, was to make “clean, wholesome, and highly entertaining stories in which the captivating humor of boy life plays a prominent part.” The films were rapidly produced, with the Vidor directing at least ten in early 1918. Except for this one, all included the judge.\n\nAlthough Bud has molded neighborhood kids into a fighting unit, he must struggle bring his family into line. His effete draft-age brother shirks military duty. His mother is annoyed by Bud’s disruption of her “Peace Society” meeting and refusal of dinner on “a meatless day.” Voluntary “Meatless Mondays” were a way around wartime rationing and promoted self-sacrifice through posters like the ones displayed in the film. (Vidor’s World War I masterpiece, The Big Parade (1925), opens with a similar doting mother and her initially slacker son. But seven years had given Vidor, and America, time to come to a darker understanding of the price exacted for patriotism.) Of the Judge Brown series, Vidor wrote, “I deeply believed in these films and I put my heart and soul into making them.”—Scott Simmon"
