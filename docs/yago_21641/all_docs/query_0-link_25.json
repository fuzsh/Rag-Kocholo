Opening Dec. 7. (In wide release.)\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nTHE ABYSS\n\nThis lively featurette, from 1910, may take the prize as the original running-away-with-the-circus melodrama. A surprisingly modern and unaffected vamp, Asta Nielsen stars as a freespirited woman who gets picked up on a Copenhagen streetcar and joins her bourgeois admirer at a summer resort. But when a travelling show passes through town, she runs away with an artiste in a cowboy hat and follows him—and her passion—down the abyss to her degradation. This was the first film by the director, Urban Gad (Nielsen’s husband), and he seems amazed by the power of the cinema to make such familiar things as trolley cars and gardens, railroads and alleyways, all seem wondrously new again. The action culminates in Nielsen’s stage routine with her theatrical heartthrob, an apache dance of a still stunning erotic audacity, which Gad, also apparently stunned, filmed in a single, hypnotic three-minute take. Silent.—Richard Brody (Scandinavia House; Dec. 5 and Dec. 8.)\n\nTHE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY\n\nIn 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, the editor of French Elle, suffered, at the age of forty-three, a massive stroke that left him able to move nothing but his left eye. The little book that Bauby composed by blinking while a secretary ran through the alphabet serves as the basis for this astounding movie, which was directed by Julian Schnabel and written by Ronald Harwood. At first, we see only what Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) sees: a blur of faces, which turn out to be the doctors and nurses at the hospital, who float into view in fearsome closeup, like deep-sea monsters. Consciousness arrives, and we experience the discomforts of Bauby’s treatment. But then, by degrees, the movie opens up to the great world: Bauby’s life and past, his fantasies and dreams. The associations are wild and free, yet nothing feels arbitrary or showy (one thinks of the visionary episodes in silent films rather than of Fellini). We need this free-flowing beauty; we deserve it; the movie, in the end, is an overwhelming sensual experience. With Emmanuelle Seigner, Olatz Lopez Garmendia, and Marie-Josée Croze. Magnificent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. In French.—David Denby (Reviewed in our issue of 12/3/07.) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE DOCKS OF NEW YORK\n\nGood, unclean fun about a brawny coal stoker (George Bancroft) who saves a woman (Betty Compson) from suicide, marries her without a license (in a saloon), then finds himself torn between his new love and his old wandering ways. The director, Josef von Sternberg, knew how to use visual zing to fuel a seventy-four-minute movie, and if you’ve seen later collaborations (such as “Morocco”) between him and this picture’s screenwriter, Jules Furthman, you’ll recognize the roots of their specialty here: characters who behave better than they think they can. Compson is terrific as a heroine who knows the time of day and wishes she didn’t; her eyes are like sundials registering the come-ons of the men around her. Silent. Released in 1928.—Michael Sragow (MOMA; Dec. 9.)\n\nENCHANTED\n\nDisney fights back. After years of seeing its animated features outclassed by the competition—not least from Pixar, its own subsidiary—the company has realized that its strength lies in plundering its back catalogue and making sport with the spoils. Hence Kevin Lima’s new film, which starts in a cartoon kingdom (an unabashed homage to early Disney, exploding with anthropomorphism) and suddenly spirits its main characters into the real world—or, at any rate, into a New York where people sing on cue, and where a divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) can discover his inner warmth. So, not that real. But the conceit is smartly wrought, so much so that the attempts at comic relief (from a C.G.I. chipmunk and a henchman played by Timothy Spall) seem not just lumpen but superfluous. Happily, the leads carry the day: James Marsden as a prince of grinning vanity, Susan Sarandon as the wicked stepmother (although the climax turns her into something else, again unnecessarily), and, above all, Amy Adams, who, in the role of a would-be princess, finds true momentum, not just sappiness, in the farce of innocence. With songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.—Anthony Lane (In wide release.)\n\nTHE GOLDEN COMPASS\n\nAn earnest and unsatisfying adaptation of the first book in Philip Pullman’s best-selling young-adult fantasy trilogy, “His Dark Materials.” The adventure takes place in a land where people’s souls manifest themselves as animals and the sinister government of the Magisterium wants to rule the world. The story involves a young orphan girl (Dakota Blue Richards) who, with the aid of a magic compass, sets out to find two friends who have been kidnapped, for nefarious reasons, by the Magisterium. At the same time, she is befriended by a glamorous world traveller (Nicole Kidman), who promises to help her on her quest but has her own agenda. The movie, directed by Chris Weitz, is stuffed with subplots and characters (talking animals, witches, and water gypsies) who all have a story to tell, and the narrative gets so busy that the plot gets lost. With its soaring Roman structures, vehicles out of Jules Verne, and Dickensian Cockney dialogue, Weitz gets the look and the feel right, but the magic ends there. And the unresolved ending is a huge problem, particularly if the audience hasn’t been told that the film is basically a setup for things to come.—Bruce Diones (In wide release.)\n\nGRACE IS GONE\n\nStanley Phillips (John Cusack) is a middle-aged store manager with spectacles and a touch of flab. He used to be in the military, but his eyesight grew too weak; his wife, however, is still a soldier, serving in Iraq. When news comes that she has been killed, he cannot bring himself to break it to their daughters, Heidi (Shélan O’Keefe) and Dawn (Gracie Bednarczyk), choosing instead to take them out of school for a visit to the Enchanted Gardens, in Florida. Much of the movie unfolds as a kind of anesthetized road trip, with ordinary life—and the fact of death—barely intruding upon their joyless adventure. The writer and director, James C. Strouse, spends the whole film working up to Stanley’s moment of revelation and then blows it, smothering the scene in music that blots out the words. Cusack, moving like a sleepwalker, is cast strongly against type, but that type (think of his motormouth in “High Fidelity”) was always appealing, and his fans will miss his wit; thankfully, the movie, which looks drab and drained, is rescued by the wonderful O’Keefe, whose grave demeanor seems ominously mature—it is as though she were already primed to assume the mother’s role. With Alessandro Nivola as the hero’s antiwar brother.—A.L. (In wide release.)\n\nI’M NOT THERE\n\nOn the principle that the range and mutability of Bob Dylan’s music defies classification, and that his own character has been an amalgam of selves, this new Todd Haynes movie assigns six separate actors—Marcus Carl Franklin, Ben Whishaw, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Richard Gere, and Cate Blanchett—to play variations, as it were, on the theme of being Dylan. Of the six, only the first and last make an enduring impact—Franklin with his smile and brio, Blanchett with the audacity of her transformation into a curly-haired, mumbling male sage. The other performers are smothered by the central conceit, which may well exasperate aficionados while baffling the unconverted; the real Dylan is never spoken of, and his songs have to fight for space amid the mythmaking and speculation. In particular, the section with Gere, who moseys around a doomed Western town in the role of Billy the Kid, feels richly redundant to the project. Haynes’s fans, at least, will be gratified to find his command of light and color undiminished. With Bruce Greenwood in fine form as a quizzical journalist.—A.L. (11/26/07) (In wide release.)\n\nMARGOT AT THE WEDDING\n\nThere are many ways of frustrating and boring an audience, but setting up a bunch of characters who are so inept that they can’t hit a croquet ball, or run through the woods without tripping, or chop down a tree without its landing on a wedding tent may be the most infuriating way of all. Noah Baumbach’s new movie is about a family that can’t do anything right. Margot (Nicole Kidman), a novelist with a disconcerting habit of sticking a verbal knife into people, shows up at the house of her unhappy sister, Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is about to marry an out-of-work rocker (Jack Black). Misery, confusion, and much stumbling about ensue. Baumbach has modelled the movie on Bergman’s lacerating isolated-island pictures, but, unlike Bergman, he hasn’t worked out the struggle between speaking and withholding. People simply blurt out scathing remarks or behave badly, so there’s little power in the various revelations and betrayals. The leafless, unbeautiful island is monochromatic. Even nature seems like a flop.—D.D. (11/19/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE MIST\n\nIt takes nerve, and a certain style, for the director of “The Shawshank Redemption” to make a horror film in which almost nothing is redeemable, but that is what Frank Darabont has done. A small town in Maine is invaded by thick mist, under cover of which lurk misshapen creatures—the outcome, we vaguely learn, of wayward military experiments. As if determined to stock up on groceries, they lay siege to a supermarket, where a crowd of locals has found refuge. These include some reassuringly familiar types, such as the heroic pragmatist (Thomas Jane), the consoling schoolteacher (Laurie Holden), the finger-pointing nutcase (Marcia Gay Harden), and the skeptic (Andre Braugher) who refuses to believe in giant, writhing flesh-eaters right up to the moment at which he meets them socially. The result, adapted from a story by Stephen King, is well paced, and blood is shed in careful moderation, but do not be fooled by the anguish of the climax: this is the true, B-movie mixture of shocks and silliness, and is all the better for it.—A.L. (11/26/07) (In wide release.)\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN\n\nThe new movie by the Coen brothers is adapted from Cormac McCarthy’s novel of the same name. Javier Bardem, his menace half-masked by a comical haircut, plays a calm, unstoppable psychopath on the trail of a stolen two million dollars. (His presence is both frightening and entertaining, if never wholly credible.) Various unfortunates cross his path and suffer the consequences, but his principal target is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a passing hunter who took the money. Following them both is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who seems in no particular hurry, and whose ruminations on crimes past and present committed in this desolate part of Texas are spoken in a gravelly voice-over. The movie, photographed by Roger Deakins, is almost stately in its ominous control, drawing us into the minutiae of mayhem and revenge. What other filmmakers would devote an extended scene to the stashing of booty in a ventilation shaft? The result is oddly unemotional, as if a vicious game were being played by solemn rules, with barely a flicker of interest in the characters’ moral plight. Only Kelly Macdonald, in her beautifully judged (and accented) performance as Moss’s wife, begins to restore the balance. With Woody Harrelson.—A.L. (11/12/07) (In wide release.)\n\nLE PLAISIR\n\nThough Max Ophüls’s 1952 costume adaptation of three stories by Maupassant matches the originals in frank sensuality and comic irony, the director reshapes the material with his distinctive blend of visual genius and bitter, worldly wisdom. The first two episodes—concerning a legendary seducer, now elderly, who dons a mask to gavotte with the young belles at a dance hall, and the ladies of a small-town brothel who send the local men into a tizzy when they close up shop to attend the madam’s niece’s first Communion—lift the veil of effervescent ribaldry to reveal the agonies of unsatisfied desire. In the dance hall, Ophüls’s gliding, gyrating camera captures the lusty, pounding steps of a quadrille as erotic as a night-club grind; in church, he slyly suggests the nuanced faith of unrepentant sinners. The third story, about a bright young artist whose relationship with his live-in model goes sour, finds Ophüls pursuing much bigger game—nothing less than the nature of love, the source of art, even the meaning of life. This philosophical tale with a whiplash ending presses the director’s elegant style to the breaking point, climaxing with a harrowing, vertiginous shot that rises to the nightmarish sublimity of the moment. As a bonus, one of the greatest of all last lines: “Happiness is not cheerful.” In French.—R.B. (BAM; Dec. 9.)\n\nREDACTED\n\nBrian De Palma’s movie is based on actual events—the rape and murder, near Baghdad, in March, 2006, of a fourteen-year-old girl, and the murder of her family as well, by five members of an American Army platoon. De Palma has made a fiction out of the events, creating characters and situations whose precise nature he inferred from soldiers’ accounts, blogs, and news reports. And he has assembled his fiction from a variety of fictionalized documentary forms: a video diary made by one of the soldiers, a terrorist Web site showing the murder of the platoon’s master sergeant, a portentous French documentary complete with stern Baroque music, and so on. Some of the men are in terrible shape—scared and trigger-happy, and quick to launch the ritual accusations of faggotry or pussydom at anyone in the platoon who doesn’t want to do something violent. Watching these guys through one lens or another is fascinating but hellish. One longs for a unifying point of view, but De Palma’s idea is that such an experience can no longer simply be told but must be pieced together from clumsy, off-center representations, all of which are guilty in some way. The spectrum runs from impotent observation (the French documentary) to complicity (the soldier’s video diary) to actual violence (the terrorist Web site). In all, the movie is a grimly mischievous emblem of our media-haunted world.—D.D. (11/19/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE SAVAGES\n\nA vital, honest, and engaging movie about two fortyish siblings who have never grown up. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a saturnine literature professor who specializes in the most acidulous of twentieth-century artists, Bertolt Brecht, and Laura Linney is his kid sister, an unproduced playwright who gets by working temp jobs, stealing from office supply rooms, and hustling for grants. Unresolved in everything that matters, brother and sister, to their chagrin, find themselves in charge of their nasty and unreachable father (Philip Bosco), who has never given them any love. The movie, however, is less interested in their relation to him than in their cranky elbowing of each other. Written and directed by Tamara Jenkins, “The Savages” asks whether two people who have never been prized can possibly bring themselves to value anyone else or even themselves. The answer is soberly inspiring.—D.D. (12/3/07) (In wide release.)\n\nALSO PLAYING\n\nAWAKE: In wide release. BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU’RE DEAD: In wide release.
