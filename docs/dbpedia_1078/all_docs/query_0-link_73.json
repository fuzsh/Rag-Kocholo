The people assembled there tried every possible way to escape from the attack that persisted for 10-15 minutes. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands seriously injured.\n\nUdham Singh As A Revolutionary And Freedom Fighter\n\nUdham Singh turned out to be a committed revolutionary at an early phase of his life. He travelled to many countries to accomplish his ultimate objective. In 1920, he moved to Africa and Nairobi in 1921.He was back to India in 1924.

He was freed from jail on 23 October 1931 and was involved in revolutionary activities in the Punjab to for three years.\n\nUdham Singh Shot Michael O’’Dwyer\n\nA 40-year-old Indian man featured himself like an Englishman, pulled out a revolver and fired 6 rounds into a gathering. O’Dwyer was shot twice. He died on the spot. Udham Singh then fired Lord Zetland, who was seriously injured. Singh did not try to escape from the crowd, but he was arrested immediately on the spot. This event occurred on 13 March 1940. On 31 July 1940, he was condemned to death. So, India celebrates Martyrdom Day of Shaheed Udham on 31 July every year.
