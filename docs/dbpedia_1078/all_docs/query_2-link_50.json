        "text": "Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer CB (9 October 1864 – 23 July 1927) was a British Indian Army officer who, as a temporary Brigadier general, was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar (in the British Indian province of Punjab). Dyer was removed from duty, but he became a celebrated hero in Britain, particularly among people with connections to the British Raj.[1] Some historians argue the episode was a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India.[2]\n\nEarly life and assignments[]\n\nDyer was born in Murree, in the Punjab province of British India, which is now in Pakistan. He was the son of an Indian-born Anglo brewer who managed the Murree Brewery in the town of Ghora Gali.[3] He spent his childhood in Simla and received his early education at the Bishop Cotton School in Simla. He attended Midleton College, County Cork, Ireland between 1875 and 1881. In 1885, soon after graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst he was commissioned into the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) as a Lieutenant,[4] and performed riot control duties in Belfast (1886) and served in the Third Burmese War (1886–87). He was then transferred to the British Indian Army, initially joining the Bengal Staff Corps as a Lieutenant in 1887.[5][6] He was attached to the 39th Bengal Infantry, later transferring to the 29th Punjabis. He served in the latter in the Black Mountain campaign (1888), the Chitral relief (1895) (promoted to Captain in 1896)[7] and the Mahsud blockade (1901–02). In 1901 he was appointed a Deputy Assistant Adjutant General.[8] He was then transferred to the 25th Punjabis.\n\nIn August 1903 he was promoted to Major, and served with the Landi Kotal Expedition (1908). He commanded the 25th Punjabis in India and Hong Kong and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in 1910.[9] During World War I (1914–18), he commanded the Seistan Force, for which he was mentioned in despatches[10] and made a Companion of the Bath (CB). He was promoted Colonel in 1915,[11][12] and was made a temporary Brigadier-General in 1916.[13][14] In 1919, about a month after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, in the Third Anglo-Afghan War, his Brigade relieved the garrison of Thal, for which he was again mentioned in despatches.[15] For a few months in 1919 he was posted at the 5th Brigade at Jamrud .\n\nHe retired on 17 July 1920, retaining the rank of Colonel.[16]\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn 1919 the European population in Punjab feared the Indians would overthrow British rule. A nationwide hartal (strike action), which was called on 30 March (later changed to 6 April) by Mahatma Gandhi, had turned violent in some areas. Authorities were also becoming concerned by displays of Hindu-Muslim unity.[17] Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, decided to deport major agitators from the province. One of those targeted was Dr. Satyapal,[18] a Hindu who had served with the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I. He advocated non-violent civil disobedience and was forbidden by the authorities to speak publicly. Another agitator was Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew,[19] a Muslim barrister who wanted political change and also preached non-violence. The district magistrate, acting on orders from the Punjab government, had the two leaders arrested.[20] On 9 April 1919, crowds soon gathered at a bridge leading into the Civil Lines, where the British lived, demanding a release of the two men. Unable to hold the crowd back, troops panicked and began firing, killing several protesters. The shooting of protesters resulted in a mob forming and returning to the city centre, setting fire to government buildings and attacking Europeans in the city. Three British bank employees were beaten to death, and Miss Marcella Sherwood, who supervised the Mission Day School for Girls was cycling round the city to close her schools when she was assaulted by a mob in a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan. Sherwood was rescued from the mob by local Indians.[21] They hid the teacher, who was hurt in the beating, before moving her to the fort. This attack, and others against Europeans, angered Dyer who was the commandant of the infantry brigade in Jalandhar. He arrived on 11 April to assume command, then instructed the troops of the garrison regarding reprisals against the population.\n\nThough authorities initially claimed that the massacre was triggered by the assault on Sherwood, regimental diaries reveal that this was merely a pretext. Instead, Dyer and Michael O'Dwyer (Lieutenant Governor of Punjab) feared an imminent mutiny in Punjab similar to the Indian Rebellion of 1857.[22]\n\nAmritsar massacre[]\n\nFurther information: Jallianwala Bagh massacre\n\nBrigadier Dyer is notorious for the orders that he gave on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar. It was by his command that 50 troops, including 25 Gurkhas of 1st/9th Gurkha Rifles, 25 Pathans and Baluch of 54th Sikhs and 59th Sindh Rifles, all armed with .303 Lee-Enfield rifles opened fire on a gathering of unarmed civilians, including women and children, at the Jallianwalla Bagh in what later came to be known as the Amritsar massacre.\n\nThe civilians had assembled at Jallianwala Bagh to participate in the annual Baisakhi celebrations which are both a religious and a cultural festival of the Punjabis. Coming from outside the city, they may have been unaware of the martial law that had been imposed. The Bagh-space comprised 6 to 7 acres (28,000 m2) and was walled on all sides except for five entrances. Four of these entrances were very narrow, admitting only a few people at a time. The fifth entrance was blocked by the armed soldiers, as well as by two armoured cars with machine guns. (These vehicles were unable to pass through the entrance.) Upon entering the park, the General ordered the troops to shoot directly into the gathering. Shooting continued until his troops' supply of 1,650 rounds of ammunition was almost exhausted.[23] The shooting continued unabated for about 10 minutes.[24]\n\nDyer is reported to have, from time to time, \"checked his fire and directed it upon places where the crowd was thickest\";[23] he did this not because the crowd was slow to disperse, but because he (the General) \"had made up his mind to punish them for having assembled there.\"[23] Some of the soldiers initially shot into the air, at which General Dyer shouted: \"Fire low. What have you been brought here for?\"[25] Later, Dyer's own testimony revealed that the crowd was not given any warning to disperse and he was not remorseful for having ordered his troops to shoot.[26]\n\n“ The worst part of the whole thing was that the firing was directed towards the exit gates through which the people were running out. There were 3 or 4 small outlets in all and bullets were actually rained over the people at all these gates… and many got trampled under the feet of the rushing crowds and thus lost their lives… even those who lay flat on the ground were fired upon.[27] ”\n\nThe official reports quote 379 dead and over 1,000 injured. However, public enquiry estimates,[28] from Government Civil Servants in the city (commissioned by the Punjab Sub-committee of Indian National Congress)[29] as well as counts from the Home Political[28] cite numbers well over a thousand dead. According to a Home Political Deposit report, the number was more than 1,000, with more than 1,200 wounded.[30] Dr. Smith, a British civil surgeon at Amritsar, indicated over 1,800 casualties.[31] The deliberate infliction of these casualties earned General Dyer the epithet of the \"Butcher of Amritsar\" in India. The actual estimates were suppressed by the government for political reasons.[citation needed]\n\nThreatening language[]\n\nThe day after the massacre Kitchin, the Commissioner of Lahore as well as General Dyer, both used threatening language. The following is the English translation of Dyer's Urdu statement directed at the local residents of Amritsar on the afternoon of 14 April 1919, a day after the Amritsar massacre:\n\nYou people know well that I am a Sepoy and soldier. Do you want war or peace? If you wish for a war, the Government is prepared for it, and if you want peace, then obey my orders and open all your shops; else I will shoot. For me the battlefield of France or Amritsar is the same. I am a military man and I will go straight. Neither shall I move to the right nor to the left. Speak up, if you want war? In case there is to be peace, my order is to open all shops at once. You people talk against the Government and persons educated in Germany and Bengal talk sedition. I shall report all these. Obey my orders. I do not wish to have anything else. I have served in the military for over 30 years. I understand the Indian Sepoy and Sikh people very well. You will have to obey my orders and observe peace. Otherwise the shops will be opened by force and Rifles. You will have to report to me of the Badmash. I will shoot them. Obey my orders and open shops. Speak up if you want war? You have committed a bad act in killing the English. The revenge will be taken upon you and upon your children.[32]\n\nCrawling order[]\n\nBrigadier Dyer designated the spot where Marcella Sherwood was assaulted sacred and daytime pickets were placed at either end of the street. Anyone wishing to proceed in the street between 6am and 8pm was made to crawl the 200 yards (180 m) on all fours, lying flat on their bellies.[33][34] The order was not required at night due to a curfew. The order effectively closed the street. The houses did not have any back doors and the inhabitants could not go out without climbing down from their roofs. This order was in effect from 19 April until 25 April 1919. No doctor or supplier was allowed in, resulting in the sick being unattended.\n\nReaction in India and Britain[]\n\nReaction to the massacre varied. A large section of the British population in India condoned it while many Indians were outraged. A Committee of Inquiry, chaired by Lord Hunter, was established to investigate the massacre. The committee's report criticised Dyer, arguing that in \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"[35] Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view,\" they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" He was met by Lieutenant-General Sir Havelock Hudson, who told him that he was relieved of his command. He was told later by the Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir Charles Monro, to resign his post and that he would not be reemployed.[36]\n\nMany in Britain supported General Dyer. Rudyard Kipling, who claimed Dyer was \"the man who saved India\", started a benefit fund which raised over 26,000 pounds sterling, including 50 pounds contributed by Kipling himself.[37] Dyer was, however, also heavily criticised both in Britain and India. Among those who spoke out against him were:\n\nPandit Motilal Nehru, father of Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, who called the massacre the \"saddest and most revealing of all.\"[38]\n\nRabindranath Tagore, the first Asian Nobel Laureate and distinguished Indian educator, who renounced his knighthood in protest against the massacre and said, \"a great crime has been done in the name of law in the Punjab.\"[39]\n\nSir Shankaran Nair who resigned his membership of the Viceroy's Executive Council in the Legislative Council of Punjab in protest to the massacre.[40]\n\nPunjab Legistative Council members Nawab Din Murad and Kartar Singh, who described the massacre as \"neither just nor humane.\"[40]\n\nCharles Freer Andrews, an Anglican priest and friend of Gandhi, who termed the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as \"cold-blooded massacre and inhumane.\"[41]\n\nBrigadier-General Surtees who stated in the Dyer debate that \"we hold India by force – undoubtedly by force.\"[42]\n\nEdwin Samuel Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, who called it \"a grave error in judgement.\"[41]\n\nWinston Churchill, at the time Secretary of State for War, who called the massacre \"an episode without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the British Empire... an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation... the crowd was neither armed nor attacking.\" during a debate in the House of Commons,[43]\n\nHerbert Asquith who observed: \"There has never been such an incident in the whole annals of Anglo-Indian history nor I believe in the history of our empire since its very inception down to present day. It is one of the worst outrages in the whole of our history.\"[44]\n\nB. G. Horniman who observed: \"No event within living memory, probably, has made so deep and painful impression on the mind of the public in this country (England) as what came to be known as the Amritsar massacre.\"[45]\n\nThe era of Michael O’Dwyer and Dyer has been deemed \"an era of misdeeds of British administration in India.\"[46]\n\nDuring the Dyer debates in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there was both praise and condemnation of Dyer.[47] In 1920, the British Labour Party Conference at Scarborough unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the Amritsar massacre as a \"cruel and barbarous action\" of British officers in Punjab and called for their trial, recall of Michael O’Dwyer and Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy, and the repealing of repressive legislation.[48]\n\nReturn to Britain[]\n\nOn his return to Britain, Brigadier Dyer was presented with a purse of 26,000 pounds sterling, a huge sum in those days, which emerged from a collection on his behalf by the Morning Post, a conservative, pro-Imperialistic newspaper, which later merged with the Daily Telegraph. A Thirteen Women Committee was constituted to present \"the Saviour of the Punjab with the sword of honour and a purse.\" This single incident angered the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore so much that he renounced his knighthood in protest. The Morning Post had supported Dyer's action on grounds stating that the massacre was necessary to \"Protect the honour of European Women.\"[49] The Morning Post blamed Montagu, Secretary of State (India), and not General Dyer for the massacre and asked for his court trial. Montagu, on the other hand, in a long letter to the Viceroy, passed the blame to Michael O'Dwyer and admitted \"I feel that O’Dwyer represents a regime that is doomed.\"[citation needed]\n\nGeneral Dyer himself seemed oblivious to the events for which he was responsible.[citation needed] He wrote an article in the Globe of 21 January 1921, titled, \"The Peril to the Empire.\" It commenced with \"India does not want self-government. She does not understand it.\" He wrote later that:\n\nIt is only to an enlightened people that free speech and a free press can be extended. The Indian people want no such enlightenment.\n\nThere should be an eleventh commandment in India, \"Thou shalt not agitate.\"\n\nThe time will come to India when a strong hand will be exerted against malice and 'perversion' of good order.\n\nGandhi will not lead India to capable self-government. The British Raj must continue, firm and unshaken in its administration of justice to all men.\n\nIn the British Army Museum in London, a testimonial to Dyer by the British Monarch is the first exhibit along the wall of the staircase as one ascends to the first floor devoted to the Indian Army.[22]\n\nDeath[]\n\nDyer suffered a series of strokes during the last years of his life and he became increasingly isolated due to the paralysis and speechlessness inflicted by his strokes. He died of cerebral haemorrhage and arteriosclerosis in 1927.[50] On his deathbed, Dyer reportedly said:\n\n“ So many people who knew the condition of Amritsar say I did right...but so many others say I did wrong. I only want to die and know from my Maker whether I did right or wrong.\n\n—The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer by Nigel Collett\n\n”\n\nThe Morning Post remembered him in an article titled \"The Man Who Saved India\" and \"He Did His Duty\" but the Westminster Gazette wrote a contrary opinion: \"No British action, during the whole course of our history in India, has struck a severer blow to Indian faith in British justice than the massacre at Amritsar.\"\n\nPopular culture[]\n\nDyer is played by Edward Fox in the 1982 film Gandhi. Dyer's scenes in the film depict the massacre as well as Dyer's testimony to the inquisition panel.\n\nA fictionalised account of Dyer's actions in Amritsar is contained in the 1981 prize winning novel Midnight's Children, by author Salman Rushdie. (See List of Midnight's Children characters).\n\nRole of Michael O'Dwyer[]\n\nMichael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab from 1912 to 1919, endorsed General Dyer and called the massacre a \"correct\" action.[51] Some historians now believe he premeditated the massacre and set Dyer to work.[52][53][54][55] Many Indians blamed O'Dwyer, and while Dyer was never assaulted, O'Dwyer was assassinated in London in 1940 by Udham Singh as a retaliation for his role in the massacre.\n\nSee also[]\n\nSeistan Force, for the full text of Dyer's Mention in Despatches\n\nThe Butcher of Amritsar\n\nReferences[]\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nAlfred Draper, The Massacre that Ended the Raj, London, 1981\n\nIan Duncan Colvin, The life of General Dyer, Edinburgh, London : W.
