        "text": "Udham Singh, who symbolised the hockey ethos of India and was three times an Olympic gold medalist, has died aged 71. An inside-forward, he was known for his finesse and fluency of his play during the golden age of Indian hockey. He played in four Olympics - Helsinki in 1952, Melbourne in 1956, Rome 1960 and Tokyo in 1964 - and was unfortunate not to have been in five; only a finger injury stopped him playing at the 1948 games in London.\n\nBorn in Sansarpur, in the Punjab, considered to be the cradle of Indian hockey, Udham first played for his state at 17. He toured Poland with the Indian national team in 1953, played in the Warsaw International in 1955, and led his country's squad for the 1959 tour of East Africa.\n\nOutside of competitive hockey, he became a coach for the Punjab police squads and played a leading role in shaping a host of star Indian players. A stickler for details and a strict disciplinarian, Udham always urged his wards to strive for more. Ignoring the advice of his doctor to recuperate after a heart attack, he was teaching children hockey in his home village when he died.\n\nHe married for a second time four years ago and leaves his wife and young child.\n\nUdham Singh, hockey player, born August 4 1928; died March 23 2000"
