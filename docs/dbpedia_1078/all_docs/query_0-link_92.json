        "text": "S. Udham Singh was born on December 26, 1899 in Sunam, District Sangrur of Punjab, India, to a Sikh Family. His father S. Tehal Singh was a railway crossing watchman in the Village Upalli. His mother died in 1901, and his father in 1907. S. Udham Singh changed his name to Ram Mohammad Singh Azad, symbolising the three Major Religions of India: Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism. S. Udham Singh is a prominent figure of The Indian Independence Struggle.\n\nS. Udham Singh was an Indian Revolutionary, well known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer in March 1940. This act has been described in the history as an avenge of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre at Amritsar on 13 April, 1919.\n\nThis college was founded and established in 1969 under the name of Shaheed Udham Singh Memorial Degree College, Sunam. In 1974, when the ashes of the great martyr brought from London to Sunam with the efforts of Centre and State Government, the name of the institution was changed to Shaheed Udham Singh Government College, Sunam."
