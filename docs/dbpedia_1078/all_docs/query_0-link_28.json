        "text": "Born on December 26, 1899, Udham Singh is one of the many freedom fighters who fill the youngsters with vigour and strength to do something for the nation. On this day in the year 1933, he was hanged on charges of murdering Michael O Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Reginald Dyer was the one who ordered the shooting at Jallianwalla, Dwyer condoned his actions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe name of Sardar Udham Singh is recorded as a revolutionary of Punjab in the fight for India's independence.\n\nEarly life of Udham Singh\n\nUdham Singh was born as Sher Singh in the village of Sunam in Sangrur district of Punjab. His parents died while he was still a child. He was taken away by Central Khalsa Orphanage, Putlighar.\n\nHe was an eyewitness to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre -- the incident which painted the pages of Indian history in pitch-black.\n\nAssassination of Dwyer\n\nOn March 13, 1940, a meeting of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society was going on at Caxton Hall in London.\n\nHe attended the meeting with sole purpose of the assassination of Dwyer. Singh had carved the shape of the revolver by cutting the pages to fit it inside the book.\n\nUpon the end of this meeting, Udham Singh fired on Michael O Dwyer but did not run away after shooting two times at the former Lt Governor of Punjab, who died on the spot. Singh, instead, waited for the officials to arrest him.\n\nHe was sued in Britain and on June 4, 1940, Singh was convicted of murder and hanged on July 31, 1940, in the Pentonville jail.\n\nThe remains of Udham Singh are preserved at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar.\n\nThe time when Udham Singh he acted in Hollywood movies\n\nYes, Udham Singh, the revolutionary freedom fighter acted in not 1 but 2 Hollywood movies.\n\nWhy? To earn extra money in order to support the Gadar Party -- an organisation Indians formed to end the British rule in India.\n\nThe movies in which he played a role are:\n\nElephant Boy (1937)\n\nThe Four Feathers (1939)\n\nAlexander Korda's Elephant Boy is a movie on the story of 'Toomai of the Elephants' in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. It also went to win the Best director's award in the Venice Film Festival.\n\nZolton Korda's The Four Feathers was about a British officer who disguises himself as an Arab to save his comrades.\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
