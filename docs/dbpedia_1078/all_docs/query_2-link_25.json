He lost his parents during the Jallianwala massacre.It is believed that the Jallianwala Bagh massacre had a deep impact on him.\n\nAfter the Rowlatt Act was passed, the Punjab government started suppressing all protests. Meanwhile, on April 13, 1919, the public gathered at Jallianwala Bagh to celebrate Baisakhi, but the British government took it as a political gathering.\n\nDespite General Dyer's order to prevent unlawful assembly, people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. Where two resolutions were to be discussed, one condemning the firing on 10 April and the other requesting the authorities to release their leaders to be done.\n\nOn receiving information about the gathering of people, Brigadier-General Dyer ordered them to open fire without any warning.\n\nThe firing went on for 10-15 minutes and the firing stopped only after the ammunition was exhausted. The total estimated number of dead in this incident was more than 500."
