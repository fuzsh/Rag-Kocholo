        "text": "“A valiant martyr, weddedto gallows who avenged Jalianwala Bagh massacre”\n\n“Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once” penned William Shakespeare in his masterpiece Julius Caesar. These lines seem most apt for Shaheed-i-Azam Sardar Udham Singh, who became a martyr for the cause of the country and to avenge massacre of innocent people in Jalianwala Bagh at Amritsar.\n\nRecently, letters written by him to his friend Shiv Singh Johal during his days in prison after the shooting of Sir Michael O’Dwyer, have been discovered and published. These letters show him as a man of great courage.\n\nHe looked upon death as a bride he was going to wed. A letter written by him shows his patriotic zeal when he writes, “I have never been afraid of death. I am going to marry the gallows soon. What use is it to remain alive till old age? The real credit is to die young. I want to be a martyr for the nation!”\n\nShaheed-i-Azam Sardar Udham Singh, whose Martyrdom Day falls onJuly 31 was deeply influenced by the activities of Shaheed-i-Azam Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary group. Born on 26th December 1899 at Sunam in the then princely state of Patiala, he was given the name Sher Singh at birth. It was at the Central Khalsa Orphanage at Amritsar where he was admitted after the death of his parents, that Sher Singh was given the name Udham Singh and his brother, Mukta Singh given the name of Sadhu Singh. In 1917, Udham Singh’s brother also died, leaving him alone in the world. Udham Singh left the orphanage after passing the matriculation examination in 1918.\n\nHe was present in the Jallianwala Bagh on the fateful Baisakhi Day, 13th April, 1919 when a peaceful assembly of people was fired upon by General Reginald Edward Harry Dyer, killing hundreds of people. He used to recall the massacre with anger and turned to the path of revolution.\n\nAlways on the lookout for an opportunity to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy, he found that long-awaited moment after almost 21 years on 13th March 1940. On that day, a meeting of the East India Association was being held in conjunction with the Royal Central Asian Society in the Caxton Hall, London. Udham Singh fired six shots from his pistol at Sir Michael O’Dwyer, who was Governor of the Punjab when the Amritsar massacre had taken place. Michael O’Dwyer was hit twice and fell to the ground dead and Lord Zetland, the Secretary of State for India, who was presiding over the meeting, was injured. Udham Singh was arrested with a smoking revolver as he made no attempt to escape and continued saying that he had done his duty for the motherland. On 31 July 1940, Udham Singh was hanged in Pentonville prison in London.\n\nThe name of Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh would always be etched in golden letters in the annals of our freedom struggle."
