        "text": "Shaheed Udham Singh is most associated in popular culture as the person who exacted revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy.\n\nHe is referred to as the 'lone assassin' or the 'patient assassin' since he was the one who shot and killed Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, whose government oversaw the horrific Amritsar slaughter, and who later gave Brigadier-General Dyer's murderous orders his blessing.\n\nSingh was a secular individual despite being born on December 26, 1899, into a Sikh family. Ram Mohammad Singh Azad was the new name he went by. Following his father's death, he and his older brother were raised in an orphanage.\n\nHISTORY:\n\nAfter World War I, Udham Singh was disillusioned with the British government's broken promises, and he joined the Ghadar Party in 1919, marking the beginning of his heroic journey.\n\nDriven by rage following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, he emerged as a significant player in the distribution of revolutionary literature throughout Punjab.\n\nHis involvement sent him to East Africa and Uganda, where he strengthened his ties to the revolution. Singh rose to prominence as a Ghadar activist in the US, establishing the Azad Party and broadening his network abroad.\n\nAfter being arrested in 1927 for carrying a weapon and reading seditious literature, he met Bhagat Singh in prison, who later served as his tutor. Following his release, Singh journeyed around Europe, carrying on with his revolutionary endeavours until his valiant heritage was cemented.\n\nSTORY OF REVENGE:\n\nAs Udham Singh was giving a speech at Caxton Hall, he shot Michael O'Dwyer twice at point-blank range, killing him with a handgun hidden in a book. By killing Punjab Lieutenant Governor Michael O'Dwyer during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Udham Singh exacted revenge.\n\nThe massacre's mastermind, Reginald Dyer, had passed away in 1927. Singh's perseverance paid off when, following a trial and a denied appeal, he was executed on July 31, 1940, in a London jail.\n\nLEGACY:"
