        "text": "Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible)\n\nWikipedia (April 2011):\n\n\"Ivan oversaw numerous changes in the transition from a medieval nation state to an empire and emerging regional power, and became the first Tsar of a new and more powerful nation... At the core of this political revolution stands the newly adopted title of Tsar. By being crowned Tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the one and only supreme ruler, and his will was not to be questioned.\"\n\nHistoric sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality: he was described as intelligent and devout, yet given to rages and prone to episodic outbreaks of mental illness. One notable outburst may have resulted in the death of his groomed and chosen heir Ivan Ivanovich, which led to the passing of the Tsardom to the younger son: the weak and possibly mentally retarded Feodor I of Russia.\"\n\nIn 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law for wearing immodest clothing, and this may have caused a miscarriage. His son, also named Ivan, upon learning of this, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff, causing his son's (accidental) death.\"\n\n\"Ivan had made overtures to Queen Elizabeth I of England several times toward the end of his reign, inquiring about the possibility of fleeing Moscow and being granted asylum in her realm; this also has been interpreted by some as another possible sign of his deteriorating mental health.\"\n\n\"His contemporaries called him 'Ivan Groznyi' the name, which, although usually translated as 'Terrible', actually means something closer to 'Great' and carries connotations of might, power and strictness rather than horror or cruelty... Perhaps a translation closer to the intended sense would be Ivan the Fearsome, or Ivan the Formidable.\"\n\nPeter the Great\n\nStatue at Peterhof\n\nWikipedia (April 2011):\n\n\"One of Alexis' daughters from his first marriage, Sophia Alekseyevna, led a rebellion of the Streltsy (Russia's elite military corps). In the subsequent conflict, some of Peter's relatives and friends were murdered, including Matveev, and Peter witnessed some of these acts of political violence. The Streltsy uprising of April–May 1682 made it possible for Sophia, the Miloslavskys (the clan of Ivan), and their allies, to insist that Peter and Ivan [Ivan V] be proclaimed joint Tsars, with Ivan being acclaimed as the senior of the two. Sophia acted as regent during the minority of the two sovereigns and exercised all power. Peculiarly, a large hole was cut in the back of the dual-seated throne used by Ivan and Peter. Sophia would sit behind the throne and listen as Peter conversed with nobles, also feeding him information and giving him responses to questions and problems. This throne can be seen in the Kremlin museum in Moscow. For seven years, she ruled as an autocrat.\"\n\n\"In 1697, he traveled incognito to Europe on an 18-month journey with a large Russian delegation–the so-called \"Grand Embassy\"—to seek the aid of the European monarchs.\"\n\n\"In England he met with King William III, visited Greenwich and Oxford... He also travelled to the fledgling city of Manchester to learn the techniques of city building he would later use to great effect at Saint Petersburg.\"\n\n\"Peter founded the city of Saint Petersburg (Germanically named after Saint Peter the Apostle) ... in 1703. He forbade the building of stone edifices outside Saint Petersburg - which he intended to become Russia's capital - so that all stonemasons could participate in the construction of the new city.\"\n\n\"During Peter's reign the Russian Orthodox Church was reformed. The traditional leader of the Church was the Patriarch of Moscow. In 1700, when the office fell vacant, Peter had refused to name a replacement, allowing the Patriarch's Coadjutor (or deputy) to discharge the duties of the office. Twenty-one years later, in 1721, Peter ... erected the Holy Synod, a council of ten clergymen, to take the place of the Patriarch and Coadjutor. Peter also implemented a law that stipulated that no Russian man could join a monastery before the age of 50.\"\n\n\"Peter implemented social modernization in an absolute manner by requiring courtiers, state officials, and the military to shave their beards and adopt modern clothing styles... Boyars who sought to retain their beards were required to pay an annual beard tax of one hundred rubles. \"\n\n\"Peter decided that all of the children of the nobility should have some early education, especially in the areas of sciences. Therefore, on 28 February 1714, he issued a decree on compulsory education, which dictated that all Russian 10- to 15-year-old children of the nobility, government clerks, and even lesser ranked officials, must learn basic mathematics and geometry, and should be tested on it at the end of their studies.\"\n\n\"All of Peter's male children had died—the eldest son, Alexei, had been tortured and killed on Peter's orders in 1718 because he had disobeyed his father and opposed official policies.\"\n\nWikipedia (April 2011):\n\n\"Elizabeth, the second-oldest surviving daughter of Peter the Great and Catherine I of Russia... Out of the twelve children of Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only two daughters, Anna and Elizabeth survived... Her father had tried to also find a brilliant match for Elizabeth with the French Royal court when he paid a visit there. It was Peter's intention to marry his second daughter to the young French King Louis XV, but the Bourbons declined the offer... At the time of Peter's death, no marriage plan had succeeded.\"\n\n\"She was commonly known as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire.\"\n\n\"... 1741, Elizabeth seized power with the help of the Preobrazhensky Regiment. ... the troops marched to the Winter Palace where they arrested the infant Emperor, his parents and their own lieutenant-colonel, Count von Munnich. It was a daring coup and passed without bloodshed. Elizabeth had vowed that if she became Empress that she would not sign a single death sentence, an unusual promise that she - notably - kept to throughout her life... Generally, she was one of the best loved Russian monarchs, because she did not allow Germans in the government and not one person was executed during her reign.\"\n\n\"She also spent exorbitant sums of money on the grandiose baroque projects of her favourite architect, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, particularly in Peterhof and Tsarskoye Selo. The Winter Palace and the Smolny Cathedral remain the chief monuments of her reign in Saint Petersburg.\"\n\n\"As an unmarried and childless Empress, it was imperative for Elizabeth to find a legitimate heir to secure the Romanov dynasty. She chose her nephew, Peter of Holstein-Gottorp [See Catherine II below].\"\n\n\"Under the reign of Elizabeth, the francophile Russian court was one of the most splendid in all Europe. Foreigners were amazed at the sheer luxury of the sumptuous balls and masquerades. The Empress prided herself on her skills as a dancer and wore the most exquisite dresses. She issued decrees governing the styles of dresses and decorations worn by courtiers. Nobody was allowed to have the same hairstyle as the Empress and Elizabeth owned fifteen thousand ball gowns, several thousand pairs of shoes as well as an unlimited number of silk stockings. In spite of her love of court, Elizabeth was deeply religious.\""
