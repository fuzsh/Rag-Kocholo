        "text": "Her Imperial Highness, The Grand Duchess Olga Nicholaievna Romanov was born on November 15, 1895 at Tsarskoe Selo. She was the oldest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra. She has 3 younger sisters - Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia - and one younger brother Alexei. Olga was the most like her father, the Tsar Nicholas the Second, with chestnut-blonde hair and blue eyes. She was the more thoughtful of her sisters and very intelligent, but she was sometimes difficult, and argued with her mother, Empress Alexandra. Olga was extremely close to her younger sister Tatiana, who was 18 months younger then her. Tatiana and Olga shared a bedroom and were called \"The Big Pair\", while Olga's other two younger sisters - Maria and Anastasia - were called \"The Little Pair.\" Olga was going to maybe marry Price Carol of Romania, but Olga didn't want to leave Russia. \"I am Russian and I mean to remain Russian!\" So Olga did not marry Prince Carol. When World War I started Olga, her sister Tatiana and her Mother the Empress Alexandra became War nurses. During the War Olga became more aware of the resentment that the Russian people had for her family. Also During the war she had a mental breakdown. When her father abdicated, for himself and Alexei, Olga and her family were prisoners of the Revolution, in Tobolsk. After that, Olga's father, mother and sister Maria went to Ekaterinburg, leaving Olga with her sisters Tatiana and Anastasia and her younger brother Alexei. Olga and her sisters took care of Alexei because he got very hurt before her father, mother and sister left. After Alexei was well enough to be moved, Olga, Tatiana, Anastasia, Alexei and some of their employees went to Ekaterinburg, to be with their parents and Maria. In Ekaterinburg the Romanov's lived in a place called \"The House of Special Purpose.\" Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia all shared a room, while her father, mother, and Alexei shared. On July 17, 1918 the Romanovs, their Doctor, and others where set up in a basement in \"The House of Special Purpose.\" Then, 11 executors entered and started firing. Olga and her family and servants all died. Olga was only 23 years old when she died. But, when they found the bodies of the Romanovs and their servants they realized they are missing two, Alexei and either Maria, Tatiana, or Anastasia. Recently the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia canonized the Romanovs as saints."
