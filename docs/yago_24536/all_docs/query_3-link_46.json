        "text": "Anastasia Romanovna Zakharyina-Yurieva, the first wife of the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible and the first Russian tsaritsa (Queen-consort)\n\nIvan IV (known as Ivan the Terrible or Ivan the Fearsome) was the First Tsar of Russia, who also Paved the Way for the Romanov Dynasty.\n\nIvan IV (1530 – 1584) was a controversial historical figure: a tyrant and a reformer, a monster and a strategist, a poet and a composer of considerable talent, he supported the arts, liked playing chess and had a sarcastic, wicked sense of humour. He acquired vast amounts of land during his long reign, an era marked by the conquest of the khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia, created a centrally controlled Russian state, imposed by military dominance.\n\nThe court intrigue and constant danger that Ivan was exposed to while growing up molded much of his ruthless and suspicious nature. His father, Grand Prince of Moscow Basil III, died when he was 3 years old. His mother, Elena Glinskaya, ruled as regent until her death in 1538, when Ivan was 8, and was wildly rumoured to be poisoned. During this time, the realm rapidly degenerated into chaos as rival noble (boyar) families disputed the legitimacy of her rule. Evidence indicates that Ivan was a sensitive, intelligent boy, neglected and occasionally scorned by members of the nobility who looked after him after his parents' death. The environment nurtured his hatred for the boyar class, whom he suspected of being involved in his mother's death.\n\nIvan IV of Russia aka Ivan the Terrible On 16 January 1547, at age sixteen, Ivan IV of Rurik dynasty was crowned with Monomakh's Cap at the Cathedral of the Dormition. He was the first to be crowned as \"Tsar of All the Russias\". By being crowned Tsar (King), Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the one and only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Tsar.\n\nOfficially, Tsar Ivan IV had 7 wives, but it was his first marriage to Anastasia Romanovna Zakharyina-Yurieva (1530 – 1560) that influenced his character and his rule, and in the end led to the Romanov Dynasty taking the throne.\n\nInspection of potential brides\n\nTwo weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife Anastasia Romanovna, a member of the Romanov family, who became the first Russian tsaritsa (Queen-consort). She was the daughter of nobleman (Boyar) Roman Yurievich Zakharyin-Yuriev (okolnichi of Ivan’s father, Basil III), who died on 16 February 1543, who gave his name to the Romanov Dynasty of Russian monarchs, and his wife Uliana Ivanovna, who died in 1579.\n\nAnastasia Romanovna was brought to the Kremlin for Ivan's inspection along with as many as 1500 other potential brides in accordance with old custom of Byzantine Emperors - nobles from across Russia brought their eligible daughters and Ivan himself selected Anastasia as his preferred companion.\n\nAnastasia was described by chronicles as a beauty of small stature, with fine and soft features, dark eyes and rich chestnut hair. She had a kind and mild persona, was pious and honest in character. Despite her many good qualities many noble families didn’t approve the marriage as they considered Anastasia to be beneath the Tsar and not equal to other, far more noble lines.\n\nAnastasia with her newborn son Ivan and his christening. The marriage lasted 13 years and proved to be affectionate and successful, the only such marriage for Ivan. Anastasia gave birth to six children (Anna, Maria, Dmitry, Ivan, Eudoxia, and Feodor) before she died in 1560.\n\nAs a wife she had a calming and moderating influence on Ivan's mercurial nature and his volatile character, was supportive of him and was among few people Ivan really trusted or listened to.\n\nJerome Horsey, an agent for the Russia Company and later envoy for Queen Elizabeth I of England, recorded in his memoirs that: “he [Ivan IV] being young and riotous, she [Anastasia] ruled him with admirable affability and wisdom”.\n\nMany boyars resented Anastasia’s influence on her husband.\n\nFuneral of tsaritsa Anastasia\n\nIn the summer of 1560, Anastasia fell ill to a lingering illness and died. It could be due to numerous pregnancies and births weakining her health, but Ivan IV thought that his wife was poisoned by boyars.\n\nUpon her death, Ivan IV suffered an emotional collapse and went into a deep depression, his behavior became more erratic and out of control. He banged his head on the floor in full view of the court and smashed his furniture. He tried to tear his hair out and rip his clothes. At the funeral, following the coffin of his wife, Ivan was crying uncontrollably and could barely walk. Several of his courtiers had to hold him by the hands to support him. One Metropolitan, himself in tears, dared to remind Tsar of the hardness of a Christian. But it was in vain. Angry and depressed, with his old cruelty resurfacing, Ivan raged against the boyars. Although he had no actual evidence against the boyars of poisoning Anastasia, he had a number of them tortured and executed.\n\nStatue of Anastasia Romanovna\n\nRenowned Russian historian and writer, Nikolay Karamzin, wrote in his History of the Russian State about Anastasia’s funeral: “Never common grief professed more touchingly and stronger. Not only the court but all of Moscow came to bury their first, dearest Queen. When the body was carried to the Ascension Convent, the people did not give way either to clergy or nobles, crowding the streets round the coffin. All wept inconsolably and all the poor, beggars were calling Anastasia their mother. They wanted to deal alms among the poor as it was common in such cases: they did not take it, devoid of all joy in this day of sadness”. As Karamzin put it : “Nobody knew what Anastasia took with her to the grave! Here is the end of happy days of Ivan and Russia: for he had lost not only spouse, but virtue”.\n\nOver the next 24 years, Ivan IV earned the moniker by which he's now best known - the nickname \"Grozny,\" which roughly translates as \"formidable or sparking terror or fear”. It was during this period that Ivan displaced and destroyed the major boyar families in the region and created the Oprichniki, the first official secret Russian police force. Ivan IV’s personal life became chaotic, all other six marriages proved to be unstable and most of them turned out to be disastrous, several of the wives not lived long enough to enjoy royal years. By coincidence or by design, most of them met their end when still young, sometimes very shortly after the wedding bells and coronation. Ivan IV often openly compared his subsequent spouses with his first wife Anastasia and death of his other wives never caused him much grief unlike the death of Anastasia. None of the wives had such a soothing and positive influence on tempestuous Tsar.\n\n18 years after Anastasia’s death Ivan IV wrote in a letter to Prince Kurbsky, his former close friend and then a leading political opponent, who had defected to Lithuania (Kurbsky was believed by some historians to be aware of the plot to kill Anastasia.): “Why did you separate me with my wife? If you hadn’t taken my young wife from me, there would have been no bloody victims”.\n\nOut of six children of Ivan IV and Anastasia all their three daughters died in infancy, their eldest son and heir, Dmitry, died due to accident (he drowned) in 1553. Their son Ivan was killed in 1581 by Ivan IV himself in a fit of rage after Ivan IV beat his pregnant daughter-in-law, causing a miscarriage. In 1584 Ivan IV died of an apparent stroke. He willed the kingdom to his youngest son from Anastasia, Feodor, who died childless and whose rule spiraled Russia into difficult Time of Troubles, leading to the establishment of the Romanov Dynasty.\n\nMichael I of Russia, grandnephew of Anastasia Romanovna and first Tsar of House of Romanov\n\nAnastasia's brother Nikita Romanovich was the father of Feodor, the first to take the surname Romanov. In other words, Feodor Romanov was the first cousin of the last Rurik Tsar, Feodor I. This connection facilitated the election of Feodor Romanov's son Mikhail Romanov, the first Tsar of House of Romanov, to the throne in 1613 after the Time of Troubles.\n\nHouse of Romanov ruled over Russia from 1613 until the abdication of the last Russian Tsar Nicholas II in 1917.\n\nAnastasia Romanovna was buried in Ascension Convent in Kremlin, which was destroyed by Bolsheviks in 1929. However, her remains along with remains of other grand princesses, tsarinas and noble ladies from the Muscovite royal court were moved to the Cathedral of the Archangel in Kremlin. Examination of the bone remains of Anastasia in the late 20th century by archaeologists and forensics experts have been able to provide evidence that could actually sustain her husband's claim. The extremely high levels of mercury found in her hair, fabrics and dust indicate that she indeed may have been poisoned.\n\nAnastasia Romanovna and her role in Ivan IV’s life left a notable mark not only on history, but also in arts.\n\nIvan IV and Anastasia in the movie by Eisenstein The acclaimed two-part historical epic film about Ivan IV of Russia (1944,1958) written and directed by the filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, featured Anastasia, her love and support for her husband, her death through poison and Ivan´s gradual slide into madness as a result of her death."
