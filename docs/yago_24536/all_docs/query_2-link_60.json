        "text": "Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the TerribleWP) (イヴァン雷帝WP, Ivan Raitei?), Class Name Rider (ライダー, Raidā?), is a Rider-class Servant summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru in the Grand Orders of Fate/Grand Order.\n\nProfile[]\n\nIdentity[]\n\nAlso called the Thunderous Emperor (雷帝, Raitei?), the alternate world Lostbelt version from the Russian Lostbelt. As of the time of the Lostbelt, he had ruled as Tsar of Russia for nearly 450 years into present day 2018 AD (2020 AD of the English Version) of the Lostbelt, and later registered as a Servant of Chaldea after the Lostbelt was destroyed.\n\nThe history of Ivan's Lostbelt diverged from that of Proper Human History in 1570 AD when an asteroid struck and plunged the world into an ice age. Most humans died, and while Russians were used to the cold and prepared for such weather, but 90% of their population perished and they were on the cusp of extinction. Ivan and his mages were able to save the country by combining humans with magical beasts, creating the Yaga, with Ivan himself becoming the first after the Tsar had fused himself with the body of an ancient primordial beast hidden in Russia's tundra.[3]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nHe was once known as the worst tyrant of Russia, and his severity and brutality are unparalleled. On the other hand, he acted like a devout follower towards god. These seemingly contradicting aspects are not something that could be tolerated of any normal person, but something that is only allowed for a tsar with supreme authority. Having gained knowledge of the present, Ivan has become more aware of his situation, but he fears he would stop containing himself if his alignment were to change to Chaotic. Luckily, any regular human would just faint upon seeing him. Not simply because of his monstrous form, but because his aura as a tsar is too overwhelming.[2]\n\nHe is simply arrogant. He may understand his words, but he will rarely pay attention to what his Master says, excluding the times when he's revered as a tsar. He is obviously not dumb enough to kill his Master, but if their friends or family were to act disrespectfully towards him, he will immediately exercise his authority as tsar. In a regular Holy Grail War, his wish for the grail would be to obtain the approval of the grail to ascend to the kingdom of heaven. (Though this has no relation to FGO).[2]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nGilgamesh / Gilgamesh (Caster)\n\n\"So that's the king of Heroes... To be a king and also be sought for his prowess as a hero... It must have been difficult, living in the Age of Gods.\"[4]\n\nQin Shi Huang\n\n\"The first of the Emperors of China... What intensity... An ordinary man would likely be swallowed up.\"[4]\n\nGilgamesh / Qin Shi Huang /Iskandar\n\n\"So it was necessary to have not only influence, but power as well, huh. The kings of old certainly had it rough...\"[2]\n\nAnastasia Nikolaevna Romanova\n\n\"The consort I once so loved... The love I have for her may be different, but I still have such affection for her. Frankly, she's like a precious daughter to me. Though, she may not like that...\"[4]\n\n\"She who carries the same name as my beloved wife. May her days be beautiful, refreshing and quiet... What? She enjoys pranks? She's quite the devil? Hahaha, easy on the jokes. No way one as beautiful as her would be capable of doing a submarine throw with a snowball... Wait you're serious?\"[2]\n\nGrigori Rasputin\n\n\"Insolence...such insolence...! To trick me with the name of my adviser as I slept...such heresy...!\"[2]\n\nMartha / Georgios\n\n\"Ohh, the saints I always saw in my dreams! Please, offer me your guidance!\"[2]\n\nGreat Statue God\n\n\"Am I imagining it? This completely normal statue which looks like a cuter version of myself...Did it just move? Maybe it's my imagination...\"[2]\n\nRole[]\n\nFate/Grand Order[]\n\nAnastasia: Permafrost Empire[]\n\nThree months before Chaldea’s arrival, the Fantasy Tree Orochi manifested in Yaga Moscow. Ivan however used his powers as the Lostbelt King to prevent it from taking root. He then asleep, activating Chyornyj Oprichniki to calling forth the Oprochnik from his dreams. Needing Orochi to take root so the Lostbelt can expand, Kadoc Zemlupus devised to overthrow and replace him with his Servant, Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova.[5] Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was brought to the royal palace to keep Ivan asleep by continuously playing Requiem for Death. After playing endlessly for two months, he had Antonio Salieri take over for him.[6]\n\nSeeing Anastasia as his wife (bearing the same name), Ivan asks her about outside of Russian. Wishing to spread Russia’s glory to the rest of the world, he asks how Europe and the Far East fare. Anastasia lies that Europe has submitted to him, and negotiations in the Far East are progressing. Ivan says however that peace isn’t enough and decides he must unite the world. This prompts Anastasia to order \"Mozart\" to lull Ivan to sleep.[3]\n\nIvan later receives a revelation from the Alien God to spread Russia’s glory, and to condemn those worlds that didn’t end up like his. He is also told to destroy the Proper History, and to eliminate Chaldea. He wakes up, and Anatasia misinforms him that Grigori Rasputin (seeing him as his past advisor, Metropolitan Macarius) is spreading peace, and preaching his gospel in his stead across the land. He then speaks with Rasputin himself and recounts what Anatasia told him. Rasputin misinforms him that the Yaga having nothing but respect and admiration for him. He says this was thanks to the Oprochnik, but regrets that there’s not enough. Ivan therefore agrees to bolster their numbers and send them to cities in the farthest reaches of Russia. He then tells Rasputin about the revelation he received. However, he cannot take action against Chaldea himself because his anger already destroyed a village. Rasputin tells him those Yaga abandoned their faith and neglected to pay him homage. Therefore it was only a matter before they gave into evil and perished, thus they don’t need Ivan’s pity. Ivan agrees, but believes it could’ve been avoided if he was stronger. He admits he doesn’t care about using Orochi to spread Russia, instead he’ll use his Oprochnik to achieve his dream. He asks Rasputin if he’s doing the right, and if he must not stop now. Rasputin answers he is, and that mustn’t. He then tells him to sleep, and Ivan promptly does so.[7]\n\nRasputin later brings Patxi to look upon Ivan.[8] Simply seeing the tsar invokes immense fear in Patxi, who gives Rasputin the Rebellion Army’s location.[9]\n\nEventually Ivan begins to awaken with the construction of Adam. When he finally wake up, all of the Oprochnik disappear. He emerges infused with a mountain-sized mammoth-like creature. He demands to know from Anastasia if she truly betrayed and lied to him like the Oprochnki said. Ritsuka (controlling Adam), Atalanta Alter, Beowulf, and Miyamoto Musashi then attack him, but they can’t even leave a scratch. Fortunately for them, Salieri’s wrathfully playing Dies Irae leaves Ivan vulnerable. Ivan attempts to destroy the palace to kill Salieri, but Ritsuka uses Adam to block him. In response, Ivan unleashes a blast of lightning to destroy them, along with the palace, but Mash arrives and blocks. Ivan unleashes a blast, but Mash blocks it with Mold Camelot. The light of her Noble Phantasm entrances Ivan enough for him to lower his trunk. Musashi uses this chance to cut it off, disappearing immediately afterwards. Ritsuka then rips out Ivan’s main body using Adam. This leaves the mammoth inert, and causes Adam to fall apart.[6]\n\nIvan confronts and demands to know Beowulf, Atalanta Alter, and Anstasia’s names, which they give. He realizes the Lostbelt will be culled, but Anastasia refuses to let it be so. She declares herself the new tsar, so Ivan fights her to prove her worth. He loses and leaves to speak with Ritsuka.[5]\n\nConfronting them before Orochi, he asks Ritsuka why they wish to destroy his world, and if their world is truly worth it. He adds that with the proper history gone, his world gained the impossible chance at restoration. He understands though that it will soon be culled, the very existence of the Yaga erased. He then asks Ritsuka if they have the resolve to destroy his world to save theirs. They’re unable to answer, so Ivan fights them and Mash despite his wounds. He is defeated, but sees Ritsuka still lacks the resolve, finding it fitting for one from the realm of the weak that is the proper history. But, he notes that they’re happy despite their weakness. He then remembers his wife was very much the same. Accepting he and his world lost because they lacked such traits, Ivan disappears.[5]\n\nChristmas Event: Holy Samba Night[]\n\nIvan and Anastasia are partners in the Santa Tag Team Tournament, representing Russia. Though they’re not on the best terms, they have put their differences aside because they both heartily agree that Russia’s tsars are the rightful heirs to Santa’s throne. Outside of Black Quetzal Mask (Quetzalcoatl’s evil self) and her partner, they are the strongest team in the tournament. This is primarily thanks to their team attack called Mammoth Tusk Train. The move involves Anastasia carrying Ivan on her back and using wintry magecraft to ice-skate around at incredible speeds, taking advantage of Ivan’s mass for the power.\n\nBradamante and Quetzalcoatl face off against them in the semifinals. Apologizing for the blizzard he brought with him, Ivan proclaims that the victor will gain the power to make Christmas eternal and, with it, winter everlasting. So if Santa is the ruler of endless winter, Ivan declares he himself is the rightful Santa. He then shatters the ice golem Anastasia encased herself and she explains why they are competing together despite their differences. Next, before the match even starts, the tsars demonstrate their team attack,\n\nThe speed and power of the move makes the match difficult for Bradamante and Quetzalcoatl. Though she’s an enemy, Ivan commends her for astute observation of their move, and asks to shake her hand after the match. But Bradamante refuses to give up and she and Quetzalcoatl before their own team attack. Ivan and Anastasia counter with their team attack, but Bradamante breaks through. Only Anastasia is defeated, though, with Ivan only losing a tusk. Ivan commends Bradamante for the effort, saying he would have been defeated had she perfected the move. To reward her prowess, he declares he will fall asleep on the count of three and moves to fall on top of the collapsed Bradamante. But Bradamante stops playing possum, blinds Ivan, and defeats him.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nIvan the Terrible lives up to his name in every sense of the word.[10] Having once been the greatest monster of the sixteenth century,[11] Avicebron initially claims that although Atalanta may be a famous hunter from Greek myth, even her would have a hard time facing Ivan the Terrible. Goredolf Musik says that to beat him they would need to summon a more powerful Servant, such as the King of Heroes, the King of Conquerors, or the King of Knights.[12] Atalanta further speculates that having lived for 450 years, the Tsar is likely to be as powerful as a Phantasmal Beast from the Age of Gods, potentially even at the level of a Divine Beast.[13] However, these are all estimations made without having still learned the true nature of this version of Ivan the Terrible. In the history of the Russian Lostbelt, the legendary Tsar initially became a Yaga that ended up merging with an ancient primordial Demonic Beast he encountered long ago, beginning a period of \"growth\". Whether it was thanks to his heroic temperament or his imperial bloodline, that growth and mutation continued for five centuries up to the present day.[6] Due to this, Ivan ended up developing a Spirit Origin with strength on par with that of a Divine Spirit.[11] In fact, just from having seen him sleeping for a short moment, Caenis claims that he's a top-class monster and that he may win against their own Chief God in a brawl.[14] The Tsar is utterly inhuman. He is a primal being, the kind that must have existed on this planet long before humans ever did.[10]\n\nWhile the Ivan from panhuman history may have been a tyrant, he was a stranger to magecraft. However, when the world that would end up becoming the Russian Lostbelt was in danger of freezing over, Ivan summoned a group of magi. He sought a way for humanity to survive, which came in the form of fusing humans and magical beasts.[2] His knowledge of magecraft was later enhanced by becoming a Lostbelt King, which granted him special authorities over the Fantasy Tree Orochi, allowing him to alter and expand the Lostbelt, though he refused to make use of these powers, given their origin, and prevented the tree from properly taking root.[7] In this state he can control the weather and despite having been asleep for so long, his power still kept the blizzard from raging too hard in the capital.[10] He is also well known in his domain for his lightning blasts, which are said to be one of his most powerful weapons.[15] Even on the verge of death after having been defeated by Chaldea, he's able to shut down Ritsuka's communicator with a wave of his staff once Goredolf Musik interrupts the conversation the two were having.[5]\n\nEven though the Tsar is from a Lostbelt, the musical arts seem to have an oddly powerful effect over him. While Mozart is able to keep him asleep with his Noble Phantasm once he starts to wake up, Kadoc Zemlupus claims that he alone wouldn't be able to keep the Tsar pacified should he hear any commotion.[3]\n\nIt would normally be impossible to summon him, but perhaps in response to such an unprecedented event like the scorching, or the editing of the human order, the human order has sought stronger Heroic Spirits.[2]\n\nSkills[]\n\nClass Skills[]\n\nRiding (EX Rank): The ability to ride. Usually, he'd have a rank that would allow him to just ride something like a horse, but thanks to the Innocent Monster skill, he has fused with a rideable being.[1][2] As a Rider, his Mount appears to be a Gigantic Mammoth.[6]\n\nMagic Resistance (D Rank): Nullifies single-action magecraft. This level of resistance equal to using an amulet that wards off magecraft.[1][2]\n\nPersonal Skills[]\n\nContradictory Mind (A Rank): During his reign as the tsar of Russia, Ivan established a centrally controlled government which he ruled by fear. In the mornings he'd lock himself up in a temple to repent for his sins, and in the evening he'd joyfully torture those who rebelled against him. His mentality is something similar to that of a saint and a villain combined, and it randomly changes his alignment between the two. That is, between lawful or chaotic.[1][2]\n\nInnocent Monster (Foreign) (A Rank): Even as a human he named himself an existence equal to god, and by driving off the nobles who boasted about their political influence, his authority managed to reach its peak. Russia respected him as an absolute tsar, but the people of western Europe feared him and called him 'the terrible'. Now that he's fused with a giant mythical beast from Siberia, he has now become a being completely different from what he was in life.[1][2]\n\nEmergency Prerogative (A Rank): Supreme submission and obedience through fear that Ivan sought in order to control the nobles. The intimidating aura he puts against everyone in his surroundings creates a heavy pressure that reduces all their stats by one rank. A regular person would find it difficult to keep their eyes open under this. This skill can be negated by Charisma with rank B or higher.[1][2] When facing his supremacy, his unbridled glory, Patxi can't do anything but immediately surrender to him.[9] Ivan the Terrible is the ultimate Yaga that embodies despair incarnate. Anyone that looks at him shall know fear.[16]\n\nNoble Phantasms[]\n\nZveri - Krestnyy Khod[]\n\nThe reason Ivan the Terrible is so powerful is his Noble Phantasm Zveri - Krestnyy Khod with which he assumes his mammoth form to mercilessly destroy his enemies.[1] The Tsar is not a human nor Yaga, not even a Heroic Spirit. He is a beast of the gods with the size of a mountain. His mammoth is a \"Prime One\", a member of a dominant species from an ancient age before there were humans on this planet. While Atalanta had fought both Demonic Beasts and giants before, they were never as big as this monster, and she claims that it would give the gods of Olympus's true forms a run for their money.[6] Whereas Surtr is a conceptual calamity, Ivan is a physical one.[17] He is a walking natural disaster and an active volcano that only causes destruction whenever he wakes up.[6] During one of those events, Ivan completely obliterated a village leaving behind a crater which resembled the aftermath of the Tunguska event.[18] Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart believes he could easily end up grinding the entire russian country to a pulp if he were to wake up. He packs tremendous force and can cause an avalanche with a single step. He can even slam his trunk into the ground in place of an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm.[6] Ivan could also knock down the Fantasy Tree if he wanted to.[7] While Musashi would like to cut him down starting at the legs, she doesn't think that would work, and even her Heavenly Eye can't see a way to kill him.[6]\n\nIn this form, the Tsar can also call down lightning from the very heavens capable of stripping Avicebron's Golem Keter Malkuth of its skin and flesh and leveling the deserted buildings around them. Just from witnessing this attack, Kadoc claims he is stronger than he thought. Furthermore, Ivan can create a storm with the tip of his trunk to fire blasts on par with the lightning attack of a Divine Spirit. While Avicebron's ultimate golem may have been able to survive it, none of the other servants aiding Chaldea could have had it not been blocked by Mash's Mold Camelot. Although he can shoot this attack multiple times thanks to being a seemingly bottomless well of Magical Energy, Mash claims that he's nothing compared to the enemies Chaldea already overcame in the Human Incineration incident such as the King of Mages.[6]\n\nThe major weakness of this Noble Phantasm is its speed. Ivan is slow, so he can't dodge the attacks of other servants. His weak spot is the crown on its head, its real body, however reaching it is extremely difficult. Musashi claims that even running up his trunk at full speed wouldn't be enough to keep from getting swatted before she ever reaches the top.[6]\n\nIvan is ultimately defeated in the events of the Russian Lostbelt due to Adam and Anastasia's Viy Viy Viy momentarily holding him back and Mash blocking his attacks, allowing Salieri to play the piano without the Tsar being able to kill him. By using his anger, Salieri manages to increase the power of his own Spirit Origin and his Noble Phantasm to boost his abilities to the point where they managed to bind the Tsar's heart, weakening him and leaving him wide open for Musashi's Ishana Daitenshou to split his enormous truck clean in half. Fujimaru dealt the finishing move with Adam by taking off Ivan's crown, separating the true body from the monstrosity, thus, completely shutting it down.[6]\n\nChyornyj Oprichniki[]\n\nChyornyj Oprichniki is a Noble Phantasm transformed from the Tsar's Extraordinary Authority and based on his OprichnikiWP. It activates when Ivan falls asleep and while he sleeps, it spawns the Oprichniki which dwell in the Tsar's dreams, who protect and rule over his dominion, not resting until his enemies are killed. Their strength as a group is overwhelming, but the individual soldiers possess relatively low strength. In the vicinity of the capital Moscow however, a single unit gains power comparable to a low-rank Servant.[1] The closer they are to the Tsar the stronger they are.[13] When the Tsar wakes, the Oprichniki turn to dust and return to his dreams.[6]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nCreation and Conception[]\n\nIvan the Terrible was designed by danciao in Fate/Grand Order.[1] His scenario writer is Yuuichirou Higashide in Fate/Grand Order.[2]\n\n[]\n\n\"At first I just drew him as a human with his eyes hidden under a crown. But then I was told \"it's ok if you go crazy enough that people might think it's too far\", so I was able to create something very close to what I envisioned. I keep getting asked where his eyes are, to which all I can answer is that he's looking at you from the deep darkness.\" (danciao)[2]\n\nReferences[]"
