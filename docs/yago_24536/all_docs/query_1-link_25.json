        "text": "Alexandra Feodorovna Romanova Appearance(s) Anastasia Age 37 (when she died) Song(s) N/A Voice actor(s) N/A Singing voice actor(s) N/A\n\nTsarina Alexandra Feodorovna was a character who briefly appeared in the 1997 film, Anastasia. She was the wife of Tsar Nicholas II and the mother of Grandducheses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei. She is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nDespite her brief appearance in the movie, it is said by her mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, that her youngest daughter, Anastasia, inherited her looks and beauty.\n\nHer hair experiences great variation in color from scene to scene despite her limited role in the film. In the prologue, for example, it is the same shade of auburn as the 18-year old Anastasia; however, the portrait of the Imperial family depicts it as strawberry-blonde. A third still further discrepancy, this time in the vision Anastasia holds of the past, portrays Alexandra with chestnut hair.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBefore Alexandra married Nicholas II and became Empress of Russia, she was Princess Alix of Hesse. Alix was born on June 6, 1872 in the city of Darmstadt, Germany. Her parents were Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse and Grand Duchess Alice, who was the daughter of Queen Victoria of England and Prince Albert.\n\nShe moved to Russia after she married Nicholas II on November 26, 1894, 25 days after he became emperor of Russia after the death of his father, Alexander III.\n\nAlexandra was murdered at the hands of Rasputin's revolutionary mob along with her husband and four of her five children in 1916. Her descent from a portrait hanging on the wall at one end of the Catherine Palace ballroom during the musical number \"Once Upon a December\" constitutes her sole reappearance in the film following this event.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe purple dress that Alexandra wears during \"Once Upon a December\" is the same as the one sported by her figurine inside the music box.\n\nAccording to the film, Anastasia was eight years old rather than fifteen at the time of the revolution. In addition, the film also states that the revolution occurred in 1916 as opposed to 1917. This implies that Alexandra was thirty-seven instead of forty-six.\n\nShe is one of the only two members of Anastasia's family shown in the film who was not native to Russia (the other being Dowager Empress Marie)."
