        "text": "1. Early Life and Rise to Power\n\nThe Ivan portrayed by Cracraft is a fully believable human being, whose terrible acts are the consequence of a long and excruciatingly painful physical illness, ranging from the moderate to the severe. This illness caused him to undergo much mental and physical torment, for which he was never able to forgive the man who he held responsible, Meteveli - a foreigner in the Russian Court, who had advised that he should take a course of mercury in order to cure his illness. It is some of Ivan's tormented acts that separate Cracraft from Longworth and De Madariaga. They both refer to an incident in 1553, where Ivan subjected the son of a wealthy merchant to a mock knighting ceremony, before ripping open his abdomen and leaving him in agony for 4 days before eventually dying. Astoundingly, it seems that this terrible act was in response to the boy marrying a girl who Ivan had wished to marry himself. Cracraft's take on this incident is a logical one, in that he considers the act to be a product of the intense paranoia known to have been suffered by Ivan, which in turn can be attributed to his chronic illness. He uses the example of the boy marrying the girl to demonstrate Ivan's fear of sedition in the changing climate of the sixteenth century. This act of violence signifies a change in the nature of Ivan's previous cruelty. Up until this point, he had only punished those who he believed to have wronged him, often with the punishment far outweighing the perceived offense. However, there are many more terrible events not reported by Cracraft which have been passed down through generations and are still common knowledge in Russia today. These stories are the reason why the popular image of Ivan IV is that of a man bordering on insanity, who enjoyed inflicting cruel and unusual punishments on his subjects. Cracraft refutes this claim, stating that while Ivan was certainly insane, the level of his sickness and its implications on his psychology has been greatly exaggerated. By drawing on his own expertise in the methods and results of Ivan's internal administration, as well as looking for evidence of systematic cruelty and irrational cruelty, Cracraft offers another very strong argument. He explains that Ivan was always ruthless in his actions and by drawing on his own expertise in change during his reign, he was simply responding to the necessity for change in the manner he felt was best. This is most evident in his final acts of legislation where, in the role of an active monarch, he sought to improve the quality of life for his beloved oprichnina.\n\n1.1. Childhood in Moscow\n\nIvan was born on 25 August 1530 and was only three when his father died. He was then raised by his mother, who was a devoted Eastern Orthodox and presided over the household. The family was forced to live in poverty and paranoid fear. Ivan was teased and bullied by the children of the boyars, who were slum children. With Kolychev's assistance, Godunov was able to enlist the much older boyars from among the leading Muscovite families to swear an oath of allegiance to the young Tsar. Boyar and Church alike proved vastly incompetent in their attempts at ruling the vast Muscovite territory. At this period in his life, Ivan was greatly influenced by the high and low passions of the Muscovite people. This was in stark contrast to his treatment at the hands of the boyar nobility. Ivan was held and coddled by the church so that by his adulthood, he was a complete believer. For a six-year period prior to 1537 and then for an eight-year period up until 1543, the Muscovite state was ruled by regents. Decades of political exigency had reduced the power of the grand prince, and the boyar class was living in a state of 'Balkanized anarchy'.\n\n1.2. Ascension to the Throne\n\nIvan's ascension to the throne was the product of his uncle's death. He was eleven. The boyars (estate of aristocracy in Russia) begged Anastasia to think of her son, Dmitri, to be the manner and that Ivan be retained within the village and groomed for his successor. If reality be told, Anastasia's reign was already validated to knobs with Ivan at her aspect, indicating ever an increasing quantity of the territory changed into ruled with the aid of merely the son. It really didn't matter loads of whether or not or not Ivan might become czar; all of them knew they would be ruled by the kid besides. Events had been to vindicate that the boyars had no preference in the problem. With the understanding of his ultimate break into from the palace, Ivan had them arrested at a gathering and then all executed. They'd refused to proclaim to be patriarchs whilst not being capable of act inside the miraculous pursuits of the kingdom. As they had been forgiven roles and then made an amazing correction in a group consisting mainly of themselves, Ivan's new plan of putting off them and his partnership device changed into a sensible one. Ivan accused the magnates of seeking to limit his power. Events had demonstrated that he had never actually been to his memorial, at the same time as he incredulously asked why they had ever voted to accept what had in fact been a at no point. Therefore, they were to his forfeiture. Again, Ivan's statistical analysis changed into quite right. A number of the magnates may still confuse on really. He had completely no idea how much his undertaking had cost the rebellion responsible for he had not been in a position to know, which is also a cause. With the magnates not loyal to the pope, they were to be excommunicated. This separation of Russia from the Eastern Orthodox Church was not to last. The clergy was deeply affected by indicant reforms that were overdue and were interrupted by the issues with the boyars. With Ivan now rid of both teachings of the clergy and the advice of extraneous modernizers, he could restore the public administration.\n\n1.3. Consolidation of Power\n\nIvan IV, also known as Ivan the Terrible, started his career as a ruler at the very young age of three when he ascended to the throne as the Grand Prince of Moscow. Due to the young age at which he started ruling, various factions had to fight for control of the throne using Ivan to justify their rule. As a result, Ivan was ignored, put on display, or overthrown numerous times, causing a great deal of mental strain and insecurity for Ivan. After reaching maturity, Ivan sought to remove power from the boyar aristocracy and placed it in the hands of a strong ruler, which he hoped to become. His initial efforts to centralize power were met with great resistance. The first signs of an independent and a single nation state began with Ivan's call for a zemskii sobor or a national assembly. In July 1566, Ivan summoned the zemstvo to hear their grievances. Rival groups within the assembly clashed and chaos ensued, culminating in a display of Ivan's rage at the boyars, which was directed toward forming a new order. In 1565, a conspiracy of nobles formed against the Tsar's life led by Ivan's aunt and the leader of one of the opposing factions of nobles, Prince Andrei Kurbskii. The culmination of the acts of the defiant nobility convinced Ivan of the incapability of the boyars to assist in the governing of the Russian state. This led to the most significant change in Russian government in Ivan's reign and perhaps in all of Russian history. In 1565, on the return from an inconclusive military campaign against Lithuania, Ivan announced that he was abdicating the throne because it was too great a burden for one man to bear. This announcement threw the boyar class into chaos. They had what they desired, a weak-willed idiot on the throne named Fedor, who would be easily manipulated. Upon seeing the despair that his abdication had caused, Ivan made the momentous decision to seize absolute power and to shed his dependence on the Russian aristocracy.\n\n2. Reign and Policies\n\nThe years 1547 to 1560 mark the high point of Ivan's reign, when he was able to consolidate and increase his power. The first thing he did was add the title \"czar\" to his other titles and proceeded to take the central areas of the steppe from the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan. This allowed him to secure trade routes to the Middle East that avoided the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Crimean Khanate, which were at that time not favorable to Russia. His greatest move was the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan. Ivan's rule was known for the creation of the first Russian legal code, Sudebnik of 1550, which unified the system of law that had been based on the law code that had existed since the Kievan Rus'. When it was completed in 1550, it provided for the first time a body of laws and rules for Russia. This was an extremely important and progressive move that marked the beginning of the Russian state and its move away from the medieval era. Sadly, Ivan's law code was ahead of its time and was not fully implemented in his reign.\n\n2.1. Expansion of the Russian Empire\n\nRussia had expanded its lands under the reigns of previous Grand Princes of Muscovy, but Ivan's reign saw a considerable increase in Russia's territory. The first quarter of the 16th century had still seen Tatar rule over Kazan, Astrakhan, and the entire Volga region. Ivan sought to throw off the Tatar yoke, giving him a casus belli to attack the Khanate of Kazan, just southeast of the Tatar lands. Despite the first attempt to take Kazan ending in failure due to the newly emerged threat of a Tatar counterstate, the Crimean Khanate, closely allied to Turkey, and attacks from Sweden and Poland taking advantage of Russia's war with Tatar, Kazan was taken in 1552-1554. The initial plan to install a puppet Tsar to make Kazan a vassal state had been quickly thwarted by a revolt in 1555. As a result, the entire Kazan population was massacred or enslaved and the city was razed to the ground. The next step for Ivan was to organize the newly annexed areas. Initially, Ivan sought to secure the vital Volga trade routes by building a strong fortress at the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers. This would become the city of Nizhny Novgorod, still a large city to this day. In 1556, the Crimean Khan Devlet I Giray raided central Russia, burning down the new city and causing some 100,000 residents to flee. This prompted Ivan to go on the offensive and annex the Tatar lands east of the middle Volga, sacking Sarai, the Tatar capital, and destroying the Khanates of Astrakhan and the remnants of the Golden Horde. The result of these campaigns was a Russian population within reach of Tatar-Turkic raids. As a result, the government was inviting settlers to colonize new Russian territories, mostly from the regions of the Russian Uplands and Great Perm. The need to protect and consolidate land already claimed prompted the growth of a professional army during Ivan's reign.\n\n2.2. Strengthening Centralized Rule\n\nIn addition to expanding Russia's territory, Ivan found it necessary to centralize the authority in the state. Ivan's previous efforts to build a power base in the Novgorod and Smolensk principalities legitimized their subjugation to Muscovy. The dispersal of their populations to other regions checked disloyalty and removed foreign influences. Centralization was essential with the ever-increasing threat of foreign intervention. The Tatar raids in the mid-16th century emphasized the need for military and defense reforms. To further Wilson's point, the Livonian war (1558-1583) was launched with Russia and Poland trying to claim the Baltic region. Ivan saw the war as another attempt to open a second front and tie the Tatars to a Polish alliance. During his absence, the most well-known period of Ivan's centralizing reforms. The term Oprichnina is used to refer to this period as it is the name of the organization formed to administer the separate part of Russia which Ivan created. This part of Russia was made up of 1/3 of the state which Ivan considered disloyal. At the helm of the organization was Ivan himself, the Boyar Duma was replaced by a new body made up of Ivan's appointees, and the Tsar was the absolute dictator. The main objective of the Oprichnina was to create a new and dependable support for the Tsar throughout the troublesome times Russia faced. This was done by not just purging the state of the groups Ivan considered disloyal but also instilling fear in the remaining populace so that such opposition would not rise again. A chronicle account of the archbishop of Novgorod's execution gives insight into the nature of the Oprichnina.\n\n2.3. Implementation of the Oprichnina\n\nIn 1564, Ivan founded the Oprichnina, a large organization that was involved in administration and military functions. The members were known as the Oprichniki. The group was known for the mass repression of nobility and the taking of their land and wealth, although its exact purpose is a matter of debate. Some historians believe that the Oprichnina was an attempt to create a new noble elite, based on loyalty to the Tsar, as many oprichniki were low-ranking gentry from Russia's outlying provinces. Others believe that the Oprichnina was a manifestation of Ivan's paranoia and mental deterioration, in which he attempted to assert his authority on the Russian nobility. The word oprichnina perhaps describes at the most basic level the act of creating a separate entity within a state which is distinguished by terror and lawlessness, the term itself coming from the Russian word \"опричь\", which means \"apart from\". This ordinance had both short- and long-term repercussions for Russia and Ivan's rule; the structure and organisation of the Oprichnina gradually declined as many of the oprichniki became idle and reliant upon handouts from the Tsar, and the creation of a separate entity had demonstrated the severe division still within Russia between the peasantry and the nobility.\n\n3. Ivan's Personal Life and Legacy\n\nIvan's personal life was complex and at times tragic. He married five times and treated his wives in different ways. He first married in 1547 to Anastasia Romanovna, who was the daughter of a boyar. She died in 1560, and he was so stricken by grief that he became a monk. In 1564, he was forced to become Czar again, at least in name, and then began to act as a tyrant. In 1581, when he was striking his eldest son to death in a quarrel, the son fled and broke his skull by falling down the stairs. Ivan died a year later during an argument with a boyar. When Anastasia died in 1560, Ivan was so overcome with grief and remorse that he locked himself away for weeks. He would not attend her funeral and created a private chapel at the Church of Michael the Archangel in the Kremlin, where services were sung daily by clergymen in memory of his wife until he died. This was where he was eventually buried. He accused members of the Tsar's court and other nobility of being responsible for her death in order to weaken his power. This event was the beginning of his paranoia and a part of his life that was to become progressively worse.\n\n3.1. Marriages and Family\n\nIvan IV was married eight times in his life and had seven legitimate children, four of whom reached adulthood. His first marriage, in 1547, was to Anastasia Romanovna, a great-aunt of the future Tsar Michael I of Russia. She was a loving and nurturing wife, and they had six children together. In 1560, she miscarried a child, which caused her much distress. The miscarriage led to a severe illness from which she never recovered. Her death in 1560 also caused Ivan a great deal of distress. In the same year, Ivan was given the title \"Tsar\" and crowned his wife's successor, but the title was later passed to his eldest son. After Anastasia's death, Ivan became quite unstable, experiencing fits of rage and madness. According to popular belief, the source of this pain was his relations with the nobility and the boyar council. The nobility pressured Ivan to marry another woman so that he would have adult children to take over the throne if he were to die. However, he did not want to relinquish the power of the throne and saw this as a threat to the previously arranged succession of his favorite son from his beloved late wife. To appease the boyars, Ivan arranged a hasty marriage to a woman of lowly birth, which he later called off, allegedly because she was too old. This arrangement was a slap in the face to the elite of the time and caused an orthodoxy and a nationalistic uprising, which was put down by Ivan's private army. This event is linked to the supposed cause of his madness and the death of his wife, which was otherwise uneventful. During the Time of Troubles, the male line of the Rurik Dynasty came to an end, and there was no clear successor to the throne. This led to the establishment of the Romanov Dynasty. Fyodor I was the cousin (once removed) of Ivan and had been designated the heir to the throne by Ivan in a zemskiy sobor during the latter's illness in 1581. Ivan arranged the marriage of his son, later Tsar Michael I, with a daughter of Patriarch Jeremiah. After Ivan's death, Michael and his descendants would be the only ones legally entitled to the throne.\n\n3.2. Psychological and Physical Decline\n\nIt is in the final decades of his life that Ivan's reign of terror turns inwards on himself. On two occasions, firstly in 1564 and again in 1581, Ivan acted on his wish to abdicate the throne and retire from public life. However, on both occasions, the Russian people, so used to personal rule, would not allow it. During the 1560s, Ivan suffered from a long illness, which sought to change Russia in his absence from the capital. The illness set off the initial seizures of bad temper as he grew extremely concerned with the state that his realm was in. It was in a moderate position with the upper class of people that provided the peace of the kingdom, given royal states and cultured bourgeois. This was once a flourishing period (strictly of the Chuvash nation). In '81, the event known as the Chudnov incident led to the death of Ivan's son, Ivan Ivanovich. This follows on to the crisis of 1581 where Ivan is claimed to have died of a stroke while playing chess as a severe seizure of bad temper comes about. This has led to the recent assessments of his death as suicide. These later occurrences of silent rage for his own actions were to change into serious and wild ravings during the last months of his life. He would ask the generals from the oprichina for advice as to what to do when the Tsar murdered an emissary from Novgorod, and it was at this time that the people began to feel that the Tsar was too stained by blood and was punished by God. During his last years, which were spent amongst those torn between alternative masters and praising his past years, a further thought of the abdication of the throne came to his mind.\n\n3.3. Assessing Ivan's Historical Impact\n\nWhile modern Western depictions of Ivan IV are often colored by rejecting the old Soviet propaganda, it is clear that Russia's first crowned tsar was a tormented soul whose goal was to unify and modernize his country. In assessing Ivan IV's impact on Russian history, one must take into account the logistical vision and shrewdness embodied in Ivan's two attempts at unifying and consolidating a uniquely Russian state. Ivan began his reign with a series of administrative reforms whereby he replaced the old boyar Duma with a haphazardly elected assembly known as the 'Chosen Council'. This effectively limited the power of the boyars and streamlined the decision-making processes in the Muscovite state. However, Ivan's plan was premature, and the inefficiency of the Council combined with the relative disorganization of the Russian military led to a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Crimean Mongols in 1852. In the wake of what he perceived as the treachery of the boyars and their refusal to accept responsibility for the military defeat, Ivan declared them all 'traitors' who he claimed had forfeited their patrimonial rights in the service of the state. From this point onward, Ivan divided the Russian populace into two categories: 'service people' and 'possession people'. Service people, including all past and present state and military employees, were to be given grants of land in return for faithful service to the tsar. This is viewed as the beginning of Russian feudalism. Possession people were all others who were to become effectively serfs, providing free labor in the fields of the service people. Although the decree proved to be a muddled failure throughout Muscovy, it was re-instituted among the Cossacks and in Ukraine where it remained a very effective social order. In 1865, Ivan furthered the division by creating the first legal code of Russia, the Sudebnik which, while secular in its administrative law, made a clear distinction between the privileged classes and ordinary kholopy, or serfs. Overall, it is clear that Ivan's attempt to alleviate the problems of a disorganized and decentralized Russia were not far-fetched, but were simply premature in a time of relative state weakness and foreign pressure.\n\n4. Controversies and Historical Interpretations\n\nHistorical interpretations of Ivan IV are controversial. He has been seen as a reflection of the character of his people and the political and social forces of his time, as a deeply disturbed individual, and as a great man who attempted to change his country for the better. The argument that he was a product of his time is probably the most credible. It is hard to see Ivan IV as occurring in a vacuum. The confrontations with his boyars and the destruction of the old service gentry and its replacement with a new one were reactions to the peculiar constraints of the old Muscovite system. The chronic warfare, particularly the long Livonian War, was a reflection of the rapidly changing power relationships among the European states and the struggle between Protestantism and Catholicism. It should be noted that his warfare was not so disastrous as to prevent the rapid expansion of Muscovy in the later sixteenth century after his death. Also, it should not be forgotten that the Time of Troubles began simply because there was no tsar and society was struggling for order. A common starting point for many English language works on Ivan IV is to make an argument that contrasts with earlier Russian historiography. In the post-Soviet era, there was a tendency to focus on his positive qualities and write biographies which presented him as a misunderstood leader who was, in fact, a statesman ahead of his time. This has especially been the case in popular biographies. However, academic biographies outside Russia are often more balanced. The output of Western biographical works on Ivan IV has been quite high. They often have new information and perspectives to offer, but a major difficulty for a non-Russian biographer is to get to grips with the cultural and religious foundations of Muscovite society and grasp the significance of the tsar's actions within the Russian context. This requires a deep understanding of the Russian language, literature, and source material. As such, Western biographies have sometimes been useful to other historians mainly as ways of introducing the subject to new audiences. Recently, the controversies in English language historiography reflect debates going on in Russia. This historiography is more accessible to non-Russian historians and is thus a more significant point of comparison between them.\n\n4.1. Ivan's Reputation as \"The Terrible\"\n\nIvan's reign has generated a variety of debates on his personality, actions, and significance in Russian history. None has been so intense as the debate on Ivan's character as a human being and a historical figure. So fierce has this debate been that one historian recently has characterized his discussion of Ivan IV as the pursuit of a phantom. This debate has centered primarily on Ivan's behavior. Western historical opinion, beginning with the German diplomat Von Rautenberg, who was his contemporary, has viewed Ivan as insane. This view was perpetuated in the historical literature of Tsarist Russia and the Soviet era. In the West, it was echoed and expanded by scholars who utilized firsthand accounts of Ivan's behavior in the latter part of his reign, as well as the opinions of Tsarist-era Russian documents. This view has seen Ivan as a cruel and mentally unstable tyrant, a view that has persisted until the present. Implicit in this characterization was the idea that Russia was not yet ready for a more centralized government. The second view ran parallel with the first. This view saw Ivan as a cruel but rational state builder, who is remembered by the epitaph Groznyi, which could mean either terrible or awesome in the Russian of that time. This view, long held by Tsarist-era historians and many Soviet historians, interpreted terrible to mean awesome and respect-inspiring, and saw it as Ivan's rightful due as Tsar. This view tended to apologize for his excesses against nobility, the tradition of pisars, and the merchants, as a necessary part of a process of centralization. This view, however, also holds that Ivan's behavior in the latter part of his reign was a detriment to the Rus' state and was instrumental in the beginning of the Time of Troubles. This understanding of the word Groznyi has been reinforced in recent years by historians who advocate conservative Russian nationalism. Finally, there is the view in contemporary non-historical literature and Russian folklore that Ivan was a just but firm ruler who was led astray by others. Finally, a more recent and more complex view sparked by a new interest in Russian cultural history sees Ivan's erratic behavior as symptomatic of a crisis of the Tsardom and spread to many elements of Russian society in his time. Proponents view Ivan as always holding an essential belief that he was ruler by divine right, actively seeking to establish the legitimacy of his royal title, and support the idea with a new interpretation of Ivan's correspondence and the various legal and political reforms of his reign. They see the oprichnina as an attempt to build an alternative society to traditional Russian society in which service and support of the Tsarist autocracy would be rewarded. This view is still being argued and is likely to garner new interpretations of Ivan's reign.\n\n4.2. Debate on Ivan's Mental State\n\nThe third main area of Ivan's rule is the quite focused debate on Ivan's mental health during his life. This topic has been debated seriously for the period of his rule as being very convincing to a lot of historians, and it has been the subject for two very modern academic works, one by Daniel Peris (2004) and another by I.V. Rowland (1989). David Northrup thinks that Ivan IV was paranoid and schizophrenic but not consistently mentally ill, and that his mental health was quite good when he was not suffering from the after effects of polio in his childhood, injuries obtained in service to the state, or going through circumstantial stresses of major political crises or the result of military setbacks. Martin has an opinion that there is insufficient evidence to say definitely that Ivan was mentally ill, and thinks that the Tsar's behavior may be explained by the extreme stress and pressures of leading Russia in the sixteenth century and dealing with domestic problems and external threats to the state. Peris, in his book \"The Tsar's Foreign Policy,\" describes Ivan's behavior as erratic and, in places, irrational, and thinks that the only explanation was that the Tsar had to be suffering from a mental illness. Rowland studies various testimonies of foreign ambassadors to Ivan's court and thinks that Ivan's behavior was the result of what was acceptable for a ruler of that time period, and his actions were the actions of an intelligent man who had thought out his domestic and foreign policy very carefully. The question of Ivan IV's mental illness cannot be answered from modern clinical approaches to psychiatry, and it is probable that it never can be given a definite answer based on the available evidence from the time period.\n\n4.3. Revisionist Views on Ivan's Rule\n\nOne of the most common revisionist interpretations is that the degree of terror and destruction wrought by Ivan has been greatly exaggerated. There is a lack of consensus on the nature and extent of Ivan's responsibility for the ravaging of Russia during his rule. This school of thought sees events such as the Massacre of Novgorod as propaganda or chance for which Ivan was not responsible, and emphasizes the fact that Ivan also enacted a great deal of constructive reform to the Russian state. They argue that Russia at this time was deeply divided and that the nobility were often actively resisting the tsar's attempts to centralize the Russian state. In order to effect his reforms, Ivan found it necessary to ruthlessly suppress the opposition. He may have gone too far on occasion, even becoming paranoid and delusional in later life, but given the state of opposition to his policies, the revisionist interpretation argues that other methods would have been unlikely to succeed. There is also a smaller school of thought which argues that much of what is commonly believed about the terrible aspects of Ivan's reign is unfounded and is based on a misunderstanding of the sources. This school counters claims about Novgorod and other events as being based on biased and unreliable sources. For example, Soviet historiography of Ivan IV was based on the damaged text of the Novgorod First Chronicle, and is still widely believed. However, the chronicle was edited in the 18th century before being translated into French and thence English, and much has been shown to have been lost in translation or misinterpreted. Other historians have taken a Freudian interpretation of Ivan, and argued that Western historians have projected their own fears and stereotypes of Russian despotism onto Ivan; this is an area where psychohistory has led to a wide divergence of opinion, and can be said to be a post-revisionist area."
