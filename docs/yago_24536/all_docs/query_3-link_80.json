        "text": "Ivan IV had three daughters with Anastasia Romanovna: Anna, born 1548, Maria, born 1551, and Eudoxia, born 1556 who all died at young ages. I read somewhere that Russian rulers of the Rurikid dynasty did not marry their daughters out because there was no one higher than an Orthodox emperor and they could not marry beneath themselves. I think this idea was developed in the late fifteenth, early sixteenth century because there was no more Orthodox kingdoms, besides Russia. With a little research I discovered that Ivan the Great married his daughter Helena to Alexander, Grand Duke of Lithuania (but the religions of the spouses plagued the marriage). His son, Vasily did not have daughters, and as I stated, Ivan IV's daughters died young. If they had lived (or even one), would Ivan had tried to use them in diplomatic marriages. I know he was very religious and that would be an issue with potential marriages, but I feel his desire to spread the borders of Russia might have overridden that, somewhat.\n\nPotential spouses: John Sigismund Zapolya, King of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania\n\nErik XIV of Sweden\n\nSigismund Augustus, King of Poland\n\nUtemish (Alexander) Guiery (former) Khan of Kazan and royal hostage\n\nMagnus, Prince of Denmark (\"King of Livonia\")\n\nIvan IV married his cousin, Vladimira Starista to the second son and brother of the King of Denmark, Magnus who claimed the title, King of Livonia.\n\nAny ideas are welcome.\n\nSigismund Augustus, King of Poland\n\nThe match of Ivan III daughter and a Polish King was a failure, so no-no.\n\nUtemish (Alexander) Guiery (former) Khan of Kazan and royal hostage\n\nTried and well known thing since also Ivan III times. Likely the likeliest of the grooms.\n\nMagnus, Prince of Denmark (\"King of Livonia\")\n\nAlso likely, in case of surviving Tsarevnas the Staritsa girls are nobodies.\n\nErik XIV of Sweden\n\nMay be given an offer but would likely refuse."
