        "text": "Grand Duke of Moscow (1533â€“84) and tsar of Russia. Ivan was crowned in 1547 and married Anastasia, a Romanov. At first an able and progressive ruler, reforming law and government, after his wife's death in 1560, he became increasingly unbalanced, killing his own son in a rage. By annexing the Tatar states of Kazan and Astrakhan, he gained control of the Volga River. He established trade with w European states and began Russian expansion into Siberia. He established a personal dominion, the oprichnina, inside Russia. He also created a military force, the oprichniki, which he set against the boyars."
