        "text": "Ivan IV, \"The Terrible\", was crowned Russia's first Tsar at the age of 17.\n\nIvan the Terrible was the fallen angel.\n\nHe started as a very wise Tsar and ended as a devil. Ivan IV, \"The Terrible\" was a cruel tyrant, who never knew the meaning of moderation; he drank too much, laughed too loudly and hated and loved too fiercely.\n\nHe took easily offense, and he never forgot any insult, imaginary or not. He was definitely shrewd, and his called name \"Grozny\", meaning \"The Terrible\", was very appropriate.\n\nIvan was only 3 years old when his father died. His uncle Yuri challenged his rights to the throne, was arrested and imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nIvan's mother, Elena Glinskaya, assumed power and was regent for five years. She had Ivan's other uncle killed, but a short time afterwards she suddenly died, almost surely poisoned. A week later her confidant, Prince Ivan Obolensky, was arrested and beaten to death by his jailers. While his mother had been indifferent toward Ivan, Obolensky's sister, Agrafena, had been his beloved nurse. Now she was jailed in a convent.\n\nNot yet 8 years old, Ivan was an intelligent, sensitive boy and an insatiable reader. Without Agrafena to look after him, Ivan's loneliness deepened. The boyars alternately neglected or molested him; Ivan and his deaf-mute brother Yuri often went about hungry and threadbare. No one cared about his health or well being and Ivan became a beggar in his own palace.\n\nIvan was crowned Russia's first Tsar at the age of 17. Three weeks later he married, having chosen his bride in a national virgin competition. Virgins over the age of twelve were brought to the Kremlin to be paraded before him. He married the youthful Anastasia Zakharina, who charmed him with her beauty and soft femininity.\n\nHe had lost his virginity at 13; contemporaries say that he had several hundred lovers in the course of those first three years. And now, a week after his marriage, the boyars could not recognize their czar: gone were rough-and-tumble practical jokes with bears and jesters, the obscene songs, the whores who filled every room of the palace ... Ivan was notably courteous and helpful towards the needy. He even released many prisoners from his dungeons. This change was believed to come from the influence of his young wife. Alas, things turned back \"to normal\" in the third week of his honeymoon.\n\nHis first marriage lasted for 13 years, in the course of which Anastasia, who lived the life of a recluse, bore six children and was the only one person who could hold his cruelty in check. Disease and the never-ending insults of her husband wore the Czarina out, and she died before the age of 30.\n\nIvan accused his nobles of poisoning her, and became even more mentally unstable. Until recently, most scholars have dismissed Ivan's accusation of murder as evidence of his paranoia. But recent forensic tests on Anastasia's remains have revealed more than ten times the normal levels of mercury in her hair. It is likely, that Anastasia was indeed murdered, sending Ivan into a downward spiral of murder and cruelty.\n\nHe became famous for torturing and executing thousands of people. More than 3,000 people lost their lives in Ivan's attack on Novgorod alone. Even members of the Russian Orthodox church were not exempt from Ivan IV's executions.\n\nThe church had traditionally been a check on the power of the rulers, however when church leaders expressed disagreement with Ivan' IV's policies they were often tortured and executed. Oddly, Ivan IV was a member of the Russian Orthodox church and he offered prayers for those he had executed.\n\nThe Orthodox Church allows only three marriages. Yet there was no law for Ivan, and - apart from constant orgies in the Kremlin, with at times 1,000 -1,500 girls - he married not less than six more women.\n\nShortly after each marriage the bride was exiled to a monastery dungeon, or simply executed, allegedly because of \"exceeding whorishness\" !!!\n\nDuring his long rule (1533-1584), Ivan IV expanded the Russian lands and made Russian culture more religious than it had ever been.\n\nHe was responsible for centralizing the administration of Russia and expanding the boundaries of the Russian empire. He also established the empire in Siberia and promoted trade with various European countries, including England, France and Holland. He was noted for his highly progressive administrative policies.\n\nHe died on March 17th 1584. Before his death, Ivan was re-christened as the monk Jonah and buried in his monk's habit - in the hope of finding ultimate forgiveness.\n\nThe movie\n\nThe movie \"Ivan The Terrible\", part I + II of the unfinished trilogy, an epic cinematic portrait of Tsar Ivan IV by Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein was released in 1946. Eisenstein died in 1948 before he could realise the end of his dream.\n\nIvan the Terrible was first proposed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who wanted to recuperate the tsar as a great leader and one of his historical forerunners. Many still find it odd that Stalin would chose Ivan IV for this project. Stalin probably assumed that, if Ivan's reputation could be recuperated, his own tyranny would be more accepted.\n\nGreat use of the expressionist method by an always inspired Eisenstein who managed to please Stalin and the movie lovers in the same time. A classic."
