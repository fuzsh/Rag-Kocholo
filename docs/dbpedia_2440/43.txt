Futura

Released in 1927, Futura is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by German type designer Paul Renner. It was a revolutionary design for its time, as most books in Germany were still being printed in heavy blackletter scripts. Futura has remained consistently popular since its release over 85 years ago. It’s the favorite typeface of directors Wes Anderson and Stanley Kubrick and has been the main advertising typeface of Volkswagen since the 1960s. Futura continues to be one of the most popular fonts used on the web.
