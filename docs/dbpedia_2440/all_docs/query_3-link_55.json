        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nSince ancient times, plants have been used as a medical source for treating human diseases [1]. Nowadays, the search for natural compounds displaying therapeutic efficacy with less toxicity and side effects than synthetic drugs is still of great interest. Many phytochemicals are currently being studied for their potential benefits against the major threats to human health, i.e., non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular disorders, cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegenerative diseases, as well as metabolic impairments related to insulin resistance and liver disorders, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction are considered as common denominators of such a variety of pathologies; hence, in a preventive and therapeutic perspective, many efforts are being made to discover and characterize the antioxidant properties of natural compounds [2].\n\nFucoidan (FU) is an example of phytochemical that gained a great interest in research due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [3,4]. FU is a fucose-rich sulfated polysaccharide with a backbone of α-(1–3)-linked fucose units or α-(1–3)- and α-(1–4)- alternating linked fucose residues. It is abundant in the cell wall of marine brown algae, but also found in marine invertebrates, such as in the jelly coat from sea urchin eggs, and in the sea cucumber body wall [5]. Recently, it has been identified also in the terrestrial tree Eucaliptus globulus [6], which is widely known for different uses in herbal medicine. This latter finding inspired us to investigate the presence and properties of FU from another medicinal terrestrial plant, i.e., Ferula hermonis, a small shrub belonging to the Apiaceae family. F. hermonis is endemic in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, where the roots, harvested from August to October, are traditionally used to enhance sexual behavior and treat infertility and menopausal disturbances, so that it is commonly known as “Shirsh El Zallouh” or “Lebanese Viagra” [7]. Moreover, it has been shown that F. hermonis exerts antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, and hepatoprotective effects. These biological activities are related to the presence of a wide range of active compounds such as sulfur-containing compounds, sesquiterpenes, coumarins, ferutinin, α-pinene, camphene and carvacrol, as well as vitamins (A and E) and some minerals [7]. According to the chemical composition reported by Abdel-Kader et al. [8], F. hermonis roots contain 38.38% carbohydrates, 8.33% lipids, and 3.48% proteins; however, to our knowledge, no investigation has been conducted on the water-soluble polysaccharide fractions. In the present work, for the first time we extracted and structurally characterized a FU fraction from F. hermonis roots. We termed this extract FUFe and we evaluated its radical scavenging capacity, as well as its antioxidant and antisteatotic effects using in vitro cellular models of NAFLD and endothelial damage.\n\n2. Results\n\n2.1. Extraction Yield and Chemical Composition\n\nThe yield of the FU extraction from F. hermonis roots was 3.07%. The chemical composition of the extract is shown in . The analyses confirmed that FUFe was composed primarily of fucose with an amount of sulfate groups of 1.8% (molar ratio respect to fucose 1:0.1). The content of glucose was the highest respect to other monosaccharides such as galactose and mannose. The molar ratio in native polysaccharide was estimated to be about 1.1:1.0:0.1:0.05 for fucose, glucose, galactose, and mannose, respectively. The low protein content indicated a high degree of purity of the FUFe extract.\n\nTable 1\n\nSulfateFucoseGlucoseGalactoseMannoseProteins1.8 ± 1.5231.5 ± 6.129.3 ± 6.322.6 ± 5.821.2 ± 4.950.46 ± 7.6\n\n2.2. Spectroscopic Characterization\n\nThe FUFe extract was subjected to preliminary structural analysis (spectra are reported in Supplementary Materials). As shown in Figure S1, Supplementary Materials, the FTIR spectrum of FUFe showed a wide band centered at 3301 cm−1, which was assigned to hydrogen bonded O–H stretching vibration. The weak signal at 2926 cm−1 indicated the presence of C–H [9]. The band at 1595 cm−1 indicated the absorbance of uronic acid carbonyl group C=O, while that at 1410 cm−1 was assigned to carboxylate group vibrations (C–O). The weak band at 1273 cm−1 indicated the presence of S=O stretching vibration of the sulfate group, and the absorption at 1028 cm−1 was due to a sulfate ester group [10]. Additional band at 531 cm−1 indicated the presence of C–O–S sulfate residues [11].\n\nThe Proton (1H) NMR analysis of FUFe is shown in Figure S2. The 1H NMR spectrum contained chemical shifts ranging from 5.0 to 5.7 ppm that are consistent with the presence of protons (H1α) of α-linked-l-fucose and β-linked sugars (H1β). Chemical shifts indicated between 0.75 and 1.81 ppm corresponded to the methyl group which is a main characterization of L-fucopyranose (L-FucP). The spectrum contained resonance characteristics of FU with signals from ring protons (H-2 to H-5) at 3.46–4.20 ppm that support the presence of different types of fucosal sulfate groups with changes in glycosidic linkage positions and monosaccharide patterns [12,13]. Furthermore, 1H signals due to linear unsubstituted L-fucose resonated at 5.07 to 5.22 ppm and the signals at 5.38–5.39 ppm could be supposed signals of substituted L-fucose and side chain of D-pyranose residues [14].\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum of FUFe reported in Figure S3 showed major signals of sulfated L-fucan between 92.2 and 103.7 ppm (C1) and at 16.6 ppm (C6). The signals obtained in the region 60.2 and 82.0 ppm corresponded to pyranoid ring carbons (C2–C5) [12,15].\n\nIn the 13C NMR spectrum of FUFe there are at least seven separate anomeric carbon signals. Analysis of monosaccharide components reported in indicated the presence of fucose and glucose in similar molar ratio (1.1:1) and traces of galactose and mannose, so the degree of heterogeneity is high. The C6 signal of presumably glucose is visible at 62.4 ppm, but some signals, for example those at 61.4 and 60.1.3 ppm, probably come neither from fucose nor from other monosaccharides, being rather due to unidentified impurities.\n\n2.3. Radical Scavenging Capacity\n\nDPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays were used as easy, rapid and sensitive methods to determine the scavenging capacity of FUFe against different radicals. The results are summarized in . As indicated, FUFe showed a good ability in scavenging the DPPH free radical (about 20% to 76% inhibition in the concentration range 50–500 µg/mL), resulting in an antioxidant activity about 38 times lower than ascorbic acid (IC50 for ascorbic acid was 4.14 ± 2.12 µg/mL).\n\nTable 2\n\nFUFe (µg/mL)RSA%5018.1 ± 4.27526.6 ± 9.210036.4 ± 9.120060.5 ± 11.230072.8 ± 5.140075.7 ± 4.950075.7 ± 4.2IC50 = 157.6 ± 3.3 µg/mL\n\nshows the results of ABTS and FRAP assays. A high scavenging capacity was measured by ABTS assay, in which FUFe antioxidant activity was about 10 times less than Trolox. The FRAP value reflected the significant antioxidant activity of FUFe, that could be attributed to different mechanisms, such as complex with transition metal ion catalysts, break of chain initiation, radical scavenging prevention and increase of reductive capacity.\n\nTable 3\n\nABTSFRAPTEAC\n\n(μmol TE/g)IC50\n\n(μg/mL)TEAC\n\n(μmol TE/g)Fucoidan from\n\nF. hermonis (FUFe)410.0 ± 14.044.26 ± 2.3581.30 ± 7.20Trolox4.53 ± 1.53\n\nSimilar assays have been performed with other water-soluble polysaccharides and fucoidan fractions previously characterized from different sources [4,6,13,14,16,17]. shows a comparison of maximum RSA for FUFe with respect to other terrestrial and marine sources of FU extracted following the same procedures [6,14]. FUFe displays a higher radical scavenging potential with respect to FU from the brown algae Stypopodium schimperi, but it is a weaker antioxidant when compared to FU recently identified in another Lebanese terrestrial plant, Eucalyptus globulus.\n\nTable 4\n\nFU SourceSpeciesRSA at 500 µg/mLReferenceTerrestrial plant Ferula hermonis 75.7%- Eucalyptus globulus 95.6%[6]Brown algae Stypopodium schimperi 44.13%[14]\n\n2.4. Antioxidant and Antisteatotic Activities of FUFe in a Cellular Model of Hepatic Steatosis\n\nWe used an in vitro model of hepatic steatosis consisting in FaO cells overloaded with a mixture of oleate/palmitate (OP, 0.75 mM) to mimic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [18]. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that FUFe at different concentrations (5–100 μg/mL) did not affect FaO cell viability both in the absence and in the presence of OP, as measured by MTT assay (data not shown). The intermediate dose of 50 μg/mL FUFe was selected for further experiments.\n\nThe antioxidant ability of FUFe was analyzed using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay for ROS detection in FaO cells ( ). OP treatment resulted in a significant increase in ROS production (+30%, p ≤ 0.01 with respect to control), but FUFe was able to significantly reduce ROS production by more than 50% as compared to steatotic cells (p ≤ 0.001 vs. OP).\n\nThe antisteatotic action of FUFe was assessed by measuring triglyceride (TG) accumulation in FaO cells ( ). As previously described [19], OP treatment resulted in a significant increase in TG content with respect to control (+175%; p ≤ 0.001). However, incubation with 50 μg/mL FUFe after OP treatment decreased TG content by 36% with respect to OP (p ≤ 0.01) ( A). These results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy visualization of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) stained in green with BODIPY 493/503 ( B). We also measured extracellular TG content in cell culture medium as an indication of TG secretion by FaO cells. C shows that TG secretion was significantly increased in OP cells with respect to control (+40%, p ≤ 0.01), and that subsequent FUFe treatment did not affect this value.\n\nTo further explore the antisteatotic effects of FUFe, we used qPCR to investigate the expression of key genes of hepatic lipid metabolism, such as those coding for PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) transcription factors [20] and for a family of LD-associated proteins (perilipins, PLINs) [21]. The most abundant PPAR isoforms expressed in FaO cells are PPARα and PPARγ [19] and A shows the results of cell treatments on their expressions. For PPARα, a slight increase in steatotic cells and a return to control values after FUFe treatment was apparent, but the results did not reach statistical significance. On the contrary, PPARγ expression was significantly induced by OP treatment (1.5-fold induction, p ≤ 0.05) and a significant down-regulation to control levels was measured after incubation with FUFe (p ≤ 0.01 as compared to OP). PLIN2 and PLIN5 hepatic expressions are regulated by PPARγ [22,23]. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of both PLINs are significantly increased in steatotic FaO cells with respect to control (1.5- and 2- fold induction, p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively) and down-regulated to control values by FUFe incubation (p ≤ 0.01 and p ≤ 0.001 for PLIN2 and PLIN5, respectively; B).\n\n2.5. Effects of FUFe on Steatotic Endothelial Cells\n\nOP-treated HECV cells can be considered as a model of atherosclerosis and endothelial damage [24]. As for FaO cells, OP treatment of HECV cells resulted in a significant increase in ROS production (+46%, p ≤ 0.05 with respect to control), as measured by DCF assay. In OP cells, FUFe was able to significantly reduce ROS production to control levels (p ≤ 0.05 vs. OP) ( A). As shown in B, OP treatment also significantly enhanced NO production in HECV cells compared to control (+118%, p ≤ 0.001) and this increase was effectively reduced by FUFe treatment (−33%, p ≤ 0.001 with respect to OP).\n\n3. Discussion\n\nFucoidan (FU) is a water-soluble polysaccharide that possesses a variety of potential therapeutic and pharmaceutic applications, due to a wide spectrum of biological activities [3,4]. The main source of FU is the marine environment, particularly brown algae, such as Fucus vesiculosus [5]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a FU has been isolated and characterized from the roots of F. hermonis, a terrestrial shrub endemic in Lebanon, where it is known and currently used as a medicinal plant. Of note, the extraction yield of FU from F. hermonis (FUFe) (3.07%) was higher than that recently obtained from another terrestrial plant, i.e., E. globulus growing in Lebanon (2.1%) [6]. On the other hand, FUFe yield is smaller when compared to those reported for marine sources: for example, FU extraction yield from the brown seaweed Cystoseira barbata is 6.44% [25].\n\nThe chemical composition of FUs extracted from different sources can be relatively complex, with traces of different sugars which increase the difficulty of structural analysis [5]. The analysis of FUFe composition revealed the presence of minor monosaccharides (galactose and mannose), considerable amounts of fucose and a comparable content of glucose. The latter seems to be a peculiarity of FUFe structure, which deserves further investigations. The low protein contamination of FUFe (about 0.5%) indicated a high level of purity as compared with similar extracts. In fact, a protein content ranging from 0.2% to 2.5% has been reported in FUs extracted from different sources [26,27,28]. We tried to further purify FUFe with advanced methods such as gel filtration, but it reduced the FU yield and did not change protein content significantly. It is also well known that several factors including extraction method, vegetal species, seasonal variations, and reproductive status of the plants can affect the yield and chemical composition of purified FUs [29].\n\nA preliminary structural analysis of FUFe was performed by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy (spectra are reported in Supplementary Materials), which confirmed the presence of functional groups, such as fucopyranosyl units and sulfate groups, that characterize FU. Some variations in the peaks that can be appreciated when comparing data obtained from F. hermonis to those from E. globulus or Dictyopteris polypodioides [6,15] could be related to the different species and the diversity of the growth environment. Together with differences in chemical composition, these variations likely affect the bioactivity of purified FU [30].\n\nBased on our data, we can hypothesize for FUFe a linear chain of alternating (1,3)- or (1,6)-linked α-L- fucopyranose residues (103.6, 92.2 ppm) with sulfate groups at positions 2 (82.0 ppm). However, further spectrophotometric techniques and chemical characterization studies are currently planned to better investigate the detailed structure of FUFe regarding sulfation, O-acetylation, linkage, and branching points of the backbone chain. This will help to understand the relationships between the chemical structure of FUFe and its biological activities that remain to be established.\n\nBeing oxidative stress a common cause of most of the non-communicable diseases of the modern age, the antioxidant activity is perhaps one of the main biological potentialities of phytochemicals in general and of FU in particular. The hydroxyl hydrogen donor groups detected by FTIR spectroscopy could contribute to the antioxidant potential of FUFe. We used three different assays to characterize the antioxidant capacity of FUFe, and our data showed that it exhibited a high scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS radicals, as well as a ferric reducing power. Compounds or extracts displaying IC50 values ranging from 50 to 100 μg/mL in different antioxidant assays are considered as strong antioxidants [31]. As reported in and , FUFe IC50 was 38 times lower than ascorbic acid in DPPH assay and 10 times less than Trolox in ABTS assay. shows that at the concentration of 500 μg/mL, FUFe as an antioxidant was weaker than FU extract from E. globulus, but stronger than FU fraction from Stypopodium schimperi [6,14]. This confirms that the radical scavenging activity of FUs depends on vegetal species as well as on environmental conditions. Other reports [13,16] showed high antioxidant abilities in several FUs from brown algae (Sargassum filipendula, Cladosiphon okamuranus, Sargassum hornery, Kjellmaniella crassifolia, Nemacystus decipiens, and Fucus vesiculosus), with different strength depending on the species (IC50 ranging from 1.15 to 4.50 mg Trolox/g FU), and suggest that a combination of factors, such as the amount and position of sulfate groups, the kind of side chain sugar, and the molecular weight, all contribute to determine the final antioxidant action of different FU extracts [13].\n\nBesides in vitro antioxidant assays, it is of note that radical scavenging capacity of FUFe was confirmed in cellular systems, pointing to beneficial actions of FUFe as a phytochemical.\n\nFirst, we focused on cellular models related to NAFLD and endothelial damage. NAFLD is a physio-pathological condition affecting 25% of the population worldwide; it does not simply represent a fatty liver, because its worsening is a burden to the liver and extrahepatic tissues as well, being closely associated with cardiovascular diseases [32]. Apart from dietary and lifestyle interventions, there is still a lack of therapies for NAFLD, and research is addressed to discover new natural compounds able to counteract NAFLD onset and progression, possibly without the side effects of synthetic drugs. The literature about algae as nutritional and functional food sources, is extremely rich [33] and FUs from different seaweeds are the most extensively studied algal polysaccharides in relation to NAFLD, showing efficacy both in in vivo and in vitro experimental models, as we recently reviewed [34].\n\nIn our NAFLD model of OP-treated FaO cells [18], 50 μg/mL FUFe down-regulated ROS production induced by excessive fat. Oxidative stress can be considered as the starting point of the hepatic damage, contributing to immunological dysfunction and inflammation, thus triggering NAFLD progression and worsening toward more severe hepatic damage [35]. Accordingly, the antioxidant effect of FUFe was associated with an antisteatotic action, resulting in a significant decrease in the intracellular TG content in lipid-overloaded FaO cells.\n\nTo further investigate the antisteatotic effect of FUFe in FaO cells, we measured the expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that play a key role in the regulation of hepatic lipid balance, and their expression is regulated in NAFLD and by NAFLD therapies [20]. As previously reported, in lipid-overloaded FaO cells hepatic steatosis was associated with an increase in PPARγ expression [18]. PPARγ is a known marker of fatty liver and its expression is induced to allow energy storage, as it mediates the activation of lipogenic genes [36,37]. Accordingly, the decrease in intracellular fat content elicited by FUFe treatment of steatotic FaO cells was associated with a down-regulation of PPARγ expression toward control levels. In the liver, PPARγ appears to regulate the expression of PLIN2 and PLIN5 [22,23]. PLINs (perilipins) are a family of LD-associated proteins that confer dynamicity to these organelles and play important roles in their metabolism, taking part in the regulation of lipid trafficking inside and outside the cell [21,38]. In our NAFLD model, PLIN2 and PLIN5 displayed the same pattern of expression of PPARγ, being significantly enhanced in steatotic cells and decreased after FUFe treatment. Taken together, these results confirm the antisteatotic action of FUFe demonstrating a down-regulation of energy storing mechanisms with the involvement of changes in LD trafficking, which are also documented by the representative image of BODIPY staining for neutral lipids, showing less LDs in FUFe-treated steatotic FaO cells. Excess fats mobilized from LDs could be addressed to secretion or oxidative catabolic pathways. It was beyond the scope of this paper to further investigate these mechanisms; however, the lack of effect of FUFe on TAG released by steatotic cells in the culture medium might indicate that lipid secretion is not directly stimulated by FUFe.\n\nIn NAFLD, endothelial cells of the hepatic sinusoids participate in the development toward liver inflammation and fibrosis [39] and endothelial functions are impaired in metabolic disorders since the endothelium represents the interface between blood and tissues to allow energy supply [40]. Therefore, we investigated the effects of FUFe also in human endothelial cells (HECV). Previous data showed that these cells cultured in the presence of fatty acids accumulate cytosolic lipids and could be considered as a model of atherosclerosis [24]. In HECV cells, ROS production was enhanced by OP treatment, but decreased to control values after FUFe incubation, thus confirming the antioxidant capacity of FUFe in cellular systems. Moreover, in our model lipid overload and oxidative stress were associated with an increase in NO production, which was lowered by FUFe treatment. It is well known that in liver sinusoids, NO influences endothelial cell functions related to inflammatory and fibrotic processes [39]. Moreover, NO regulates vascular tone and blood flow by activating soluble guanylate cyclase in the vascular smooth muscle, and it is essential for leukocyte adhesion and platelet aggregation. As such, our results suggest the potentiality of FUFe to counteract endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular pathologies such as hypertension and atherosclerosis, which are often associated with NAFLD [41]."
