        "text": "Hello there gentle emacs users (greetings also to the vim user in you, I’m a vim user too). … so what brought me here is my perpetually failing effort to build the CVS version of emacs on my Intel mac. Previously, when I only had my powerpc Powerbook G4, the build would fail with the same error message:\n\nLoading loadup.el (source)... Using load-path (/home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/emacs-lisp \\ /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/language /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/international \\ /home/ritesh/pkg/emacs/lisp/textmodes) Loading emacs-lisp/byte-run (compiled; note, source file is newer)... Invalid coding system: emacs-mule make[1]: *** [bootstrap-emacs] Error 255 make: *** [src] Error 2\n\nWell, this is not exactly the place to be bug-reporting, but as I said, looking to resolve the bug is how I stumbled on the wiki, etc.\n\nWhat the gentle reader might actually find useful is my emacs customization file, which I’ve perfected over years. Here’s a screenshot on the mac. The default font is Optima, Futura is another nice font, where by nice I mean easy on the eyes and aesthetically pleasing. None of these are available on X11, unfortunately. However, if one has access to the mac opentype fonts, one can use FontForge to convert them to truetype and use those on Linux, and that is exactly how I did it. The tabs btw, I obtained through {{{elscreen}}}, a feature that I had been sorely missing in Emacs.\n\nNow for the customization file itself, which you can’t wait to get your hands on: Here’s the [init.el init file] that performs some checks and then loads the [Customization.el customization file]. Its the latter that contains settings for the various faces that you see in the screenshot.\n\n/* moin code generated by txt2tags 2.6b (http://txt2tags.sf.net) */ /* cmdline: txt2tags -t moin /Volumes/home/ritesh/Emacs/notes.t2t */"
