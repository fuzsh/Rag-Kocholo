I mean, what I need is the PS version of them\n\n(the .afm and .pfb files, or something similar, I think).\n\nOptima is called classico in\n\nftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/GhostPCL/urwfonts-1.41.tar.gz\n\nIt's ttf, but that shouldn't be an obstacle.\n\nftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/GhostPCL/urwfonts_t1-1.40.tar.gz\n\nRalf Stubner\n\nPost by Michael Zedler\n\nI'm not sure if it's included in CorelDraw -- if it is, just get an\n\nold version on ebay, they are cheap as dirt.\n\nYes, Bitstreams version of Futura is included in (some versions of)\n\nCorelDraw, even under this name. See\n\nTEXMF/fonts/map/fontname/bitsrea.map. However, since the OP asked for\n\n'Function' and 'Opus', he might be looking for the Softmaker versions\n\nwhich includ OsF (and SC?, can't remember). These are particularly rare\n\namong sans serif faces. The only free (as in beer) sans serif font with\n\nOsF that comes to my mind is the Linotype Frutiger that comes with the\n\nMS Reader. The recently submitted fontools (somewhere on CTAN) come with\n\nan installation script for these fonts. But then, these fonts have\n\nabsolutly no kerning. Question is whether that is better or worse than\n\nthe often realy wrong kerning data in Softmaker fonts ...\n\ncheerio\n\nralf"
