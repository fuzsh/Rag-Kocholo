        "text": "You don’t need thousands of fonts to create a great-looking website. But you do need to make sure that the fonts you use are visible to everyone who visits your website. And that’s where web safe fonts come in.\n\nAnd if you could find web safe fonts which are a) 100% free to use and b) don’t need to be hosted anywhere else for your visitors to see them, it’d be a homerun for you.\n\nThat’s exactly what this post has been written for: we’ll cover the 31 best-looking web safe fonts and show you exactly how to implement them into your WordPress site.\n\nUse the links on the side to navigate to the section that interests you the most, or jump directly to our list of web safe fonts.\n\nWhat Fonts are Web Safe?\n\nIncluding variations, there are over 650,000 different fonts available online. Fonts that are supported by the majority of web browsers and operating systems are considered to be web safe. The operating system automatically includes the font files, so visitors don’t have to download fonts from your servers.\n\nAn example is the ubiquitous Arial font that birthed thousands of “spin-offs”.\n\nAre Web Safe Fonts Necessary?\n\nSure, the vast majority of users now use Google Chrome, both on mobile and desktop. But that doesn’t mean web safe fonts are a thing of the past.\n\nIn fact, supported fonts vary based on the operating systems, including the current version a user has. So if you design a website with a font only supported by the newest version of Windows 10, most users will see something else.\n\nIn addition, if you choose to use and host a custom local font, or font hosted by a third party, it can slow down your website. So, switching to web safe fonts can speed up your website. And that’s a great thing. Because nearly 70% of consumers say page speed influences their purchasing decisions.\n\nAre Google Fonts Web Safe?\n\nGoogle Fonts aren’t inherently supported by your operating system, so by definition, they aren’t web safe fonts. Rather, since Google, a third-party, hosts them, a Google Font is called a web font. Confusing, we know, but the difference is that your browser needs to load a file before it can show Google fonts.\n\nWeb safe fonts already have font files ready on the majority of devices. But, don’t worry about the lack of the word safe. Google Fonts are completely safe to use to enhance the design of your website. But, the extra HTTP requests to an outside server could slow down your page loading speed.\n\n31+ Best Web Safe Fonts\n\nWe’ve compiled a list of over thirty different great-looking web safe fonts you can use to design your website.\n\nLet’s jump right into it.\n\n1. Arial\n\nArial is a classic sans serif font, suitable for both paragraphs and headlines. It’s long been a staple in web design. Although in recent years, it’s often used as a fallback in a font stack, rather than as the main font-family.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Arial, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, sans-serif.\n\n2. Baskerville\n\nBaskerville is a relatively thick serif font, originally developed as a typeface by John Baskerville in 1750. The design is well-balanced, using a mix of thick and thin strokes to soften the hard edges of a typical serif typeface. It’s well supported by newer Apple and Microsoft OS versions.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Baskerville, Baskerville Old Face, Garamond, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n3. Bodoni MT / Bodoni 72\n\nBodoni MT is a serif font, like Times New Roman, more suitable for paragraph text than headlines for most websites. Bodoni MT is available by default with Microsoft 10 and some older versions. Bodoni 72 is included with macOS Sierra and newer versions.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Bodoni MT, Bodoni 72, Didot, Didot LT STD, Hoefler Text, Garamond, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n4. Calibri\n\nCalibri is Microsoft’s standard sans serif font and has been since its release with Microsoft Office 2007. It has a soft, modern look, with rounded edges to elevate the typical sans serif feel, making it more warm than robotic.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Segoe UI, Optima, Arial, sans-serif.\n\n5. Calisto MT\n\nCalisto MT is a serif font with slightly softer and less pronounced serifs than most similar typefaces. It’s a standard Microsoft font, included with most newer versions of Windows. The macOS or iOS equivalent is the Bookman Old Style font.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Calisto MT, Bookman Old Style, Bookman, Goudy Old Style, Garamond, Hoefler Text, Bitstream Charter, Georgia, serif.\n\n6. Cambria\n\nCambria is an even softer serif font, with, in many cases, barely noticeable serifs even for capital letters. This gives it a more modern feel and also maintains a high level of readability on screens.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Cambria, Georgia, serif.\n\n7. Candara\n\nCandara is a sans serif font. It’s part of Microsoft’s ClearType font collection. The macOS and iOS equivalent is Optima Regular. The uneven stroke weights make it feel a bit less modern and corporate than other sans serif fonts.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Candara, Calibri, Segoe, Segoe UI, Optima, Arial, sans-serif.\n\n8. Century Gothic\n\nCentury Gothic is a geometric sans serif font, with a very clean and balanced look. It’s a great font for the web, especially for headings and subheadings. It was originally designed to compete with the font Futura. It’s included with most Microsoft and Apple operating systems.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Century Gothic, CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif.\n\n9. Consolas\n\nConsolas is a sans serif font with a unique approach to design. All characters have the same width, which is why it uses serifs only for the letter “I” and the lowercase “l”. It’s part of the ClearType collection.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Consolas, monaco, monospace.\n\n10. Copperplate Gothic\n\nCopperplate Gothic is a gothic-inspired font, with slight glyphic serifs on certain letters. As it’s inspired by gothic runes, there’s no lowercase font available.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Copperplate, Copperplate Gothic Light, fantasy.\n\n11. Courier New\n\nCourier New is a monospaced slab serif font, with much thinner regular text than most other serif and sans serif fonts. It has almost perfect coverage by both Microsoft and Apple on both computers and mobile devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Courier New, Courier, Lucida Sans Typewriter, Lucida Typewriter, monospace.\n\n12. Dejavu Sans\n\nDejavu Sans is a sans serif font with clean, straight lines, almost a throwback to the classic sans fonts like Arial and Verdana.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Dejavu Sans, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif.\n\n13. Didot\n\nDidot is a font inspired by the original Didot typefaces, used by 19th-century French printing business, the Didot family. It’s an Apple mainstay, supported by the majority of their OS and devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Didot, Didot LT STD, Hoefler Text, Garamond, Calisto MT, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n14. Franklin Gothic\n\nFranklin Gothic is a sans serif font with unusually thick letters, almost as if the bold version of another font. The original typeface was developed in the early 20th century by American Type Founders. It’s a good font choice for headlines, but might not be a great choice for body text.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Franklin Gothic, Arial Bold.\n\n15. Garamond\n\nGaramond is a serif font, inspired by typefaces made by the 16th-century Parisian engraver, Claude Garamond. It has softer, rounder edges than some of the more standard serif fonts, like Times New Roman. Modern versions of Microsoft and Apple OS include their own versions of the Garamond font.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Garamond, Baskerville, Baskerville Old Face, Hoefler Text, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n16. Georgia\n\nA close relative of Garamond, Georgia is another serif font with mostly rounded edges and a fairly warm feel. It was developed for Microsoft in 1996 and is still one of the most widespread MS fonts. It’s supported by virtually all Windows and macOS versions.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n17. Gill Sans\n\nGill Sans is a sans serif font, with sharp, clean lines that give it a modern look. It’s not ideal for paragraph text out of the box, because of its lack of contrast between letters, and close spacing. But as you can see in the example text, it makes a great-looking headline. Most iOS, macOS, and Windows-powered devices support it.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Gill Sans, Gill Sans MT, Calibri, sans-serif.\n\n18. Goudy Old Style\n\nGoudy Old Style is a soft old-style serif font, with strong serifs and an old-fashioned look and feel. The periods are diamond-shaped rather than the regular perfect, round circles of most serif fonts. It’s included with most newer versions of Windows.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Goudy Old Style, Garamond, Big Caslon, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n19. Helvetica\n\nHelvetica is perhaps the most famous font of all time, and definitely one of the only fonts to have its own dedicated documentary. It’s a modern sans serif font, inspired by other modern Swiss and German fonts from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nRather than a soft, rounded, and warm design, it’s balanced and focused on clean lines and shapes. This makes it one of the few fonts suitable for both body copy and headlines. All Apple devices include Helvetica fonts, while Microsoft defaults to Arial, its MS equivalent.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.\n\n20. Impact\n\nImpact is a realist sans-serif font, with a very thick bolded look as its default for all text, capital, and lowercase alike. The boldness makes it stand out from regular text and makes it perfect for headlines or CTAs (calls to action), but it’s not ideal for body copy.\n\nIt was part of the original core fonts for the web package in 1998. It’s still widely included and supported by both Apple and Windows computers and phones to this day.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Impact, Charcoal, Helvetica Inserat, Bitstream Vera Sans Bold, Arial Black, sans serif.\n\n21. Lucida Bright\n\nLucida Bright is the serif font in Microsoft’s line of Lucida fonts, developed for MS in 1991. One of the things that makes it stand out is the use of more square, sturdier serifs, for example on the capital “T” and “L”. It’s included by default in most newer versions of Windows, whereas macOS typically only includes the sans serif font Lucida Grande, making Georgia a logical fallback font.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Lucida Bright, Georgia, serif.\n\n22. Lucida Sans\n\nLucida Sans is a clean-cut humanist sans serif font, designed specifically to complement the serif fonts in the Lucida line. There’s a greater variation in the stroke weight than with the cleaner sans fonts like Helvetica or Arial. This makes it feel a bit less futuristic or robotic, and more playful. Out of the box, it’s a great font for headlines and CTAs.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Lucida Sans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.\n\n23. Microsoft Sans Serif\n\nMicrosoft Sans Serif is a sans serif font first introduced with Windows 2000. It’s the successor to the MS Sans Serif font, which was also known as Helv (short for Helvetica). It’s inspired by and based on Helvetica, the leading sans serif typeface in modern times.\n\nIt’s a clean font with even stroke weight, leading to a clean, professional look. Perfect for headlines and corporate websites. It was included as one of the original fonts for the web and is still standard for all Microsoft devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: MS Sans Serif, sans-serif.\n\n24. Optima\n\nOptima is a humanist sans serif font, with varying stroke weight and varying symmetry. This makes it look almost done by hand, which combats the typical mass-produced feel of a sans serif font. It’s one of the standard Apple sans serif fonts and supported by most iOS and macOS devices. The Microsoft equivalent is Segoe.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Optima, Segoe, Segoe UI, Candara, Calibri, Arial, sans-serif.\n\n25. Palatino\n\nPalatino is another old-style serif and would feel right at home in any online newspaper or magazine. But it’s less uniform than something like a Georgia or Times New Roman, with varying stroke weights and shapes.\n\nThe design approach helps to soften sharp letters like k, l, x, y, and z. It’s also slightly bolder than other serif fonts. These two factors help it feel a bit warmer. Palatino is included with the majority of Windows and Apple devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Palatino, Palatino Linotype, Palatino LT STD, Book Antiqua, Georgia, serif.\n\n26. Perpetua\n\nPerpetua is a serif font with a unique design, originally created by English sculptor Eric Gill. There’s a sharp contrast in the stroke weight, for example, look at the lowercase “e” or the number “3”. This gives the font a creative, almost playful quality. It’s typically a Windows font, but Baskerville, a close relative, is standard on most Apple devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Perpetua, Baskerville, Big Caslon, Palatino Linotype, Palatino, serif.\n\n27. Rockwell\n\nRockwell is a square or slab serif font with very bold, nearly monoweight lettering. It’s suitable for headlines or CTAs, but the added font-weight isn’t great for body text. It’s included in most newer versions of MS Windows.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Rockwell, Courier Bold, Courier, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif.\n\n28. Segoe UI\n\nSegoe UI is the leading sans serif font of the Segoe font family. Microsoft not only uses it in many applications but also in various marketing materials for its products.\n\nIt’s a modern font, with symmetrical letters and little variation in stroke weight. The font isn’t included with Apple computers, but the equivalent Helvetica Neue is similar in look and feel.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Segoe UI, Frutiger, Dejavu Sans, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif.\n\n29. Tahoma\n\nTahoma is another Microsoft-developed sans serif font. It has slightly bolder letters than Segoe UI and uses square dots for its lowercase letters, periods, and other marks.\n\nIt’s a clean, uniform font, and wouldn’t feel out of place in content or headings. It’s included in all Microsoft devices, and virtually all Apple devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Segoe, sans-serif.\n\n30. Trebuchet MS\n\nTrebuchet MS is another sans serif font developed by Microsoft. It was one of the original fonts included in the core fonts for the web package by Microsoft. It’s still supported by virtually all Microsoft and Apple devices. The letters are slimmer than many other sans serif fonts, making it an option for paragraphs and body text.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Trebuchet MS, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, sans-serif.\n\n31. Verdana\n\nVerdana, a clean sans serif font, is another Microsoft staple that’s been around since 1996. The stroke weight is fairly low for a sans serif, leading to slim, easy to read letters. You can use it for both paragraph text and headlines without issue. It’s supported by virtually all Apple and Windows devices.\n\nRecommended Font Stack\n\nFont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif.\n\nWeb Safe Cursive Fonts\n\nIf you want to use a web safe cursive font, you don’t have too many options to choose from. Specifically:\n\nSegoe script\n\nRage\n\nScript MT\n\nSnell Roundhand\n\nLucida Handwriting\n\nThere aren’t any cursive fonts that are universally supported across Apple and Microsoft devices. You should consider that using a cursive font for your body text may not be a great idea, as readability is a huge part of website usability.\n\nYou should always use highly readable text for your paragraphs otherwise visitors with impaired vision will have a hard time reading the text on your site. This can lead to high bounce rates and a general lack of engagement with your content.\n\nWeb Safe Sans Serif Fonts\n\nSans means “without” in French, so sans serif essentially means “without serif”. A serif is a line or stroke added to a longer stroke in a letter. For example, the small vertical lines under the top stroke in a capital “T”, common in newspaper or magazine headlines. Sans serif fonts are the most common and popular on the web, so you have a lot of options to choose from:\n\nArial\n\nCalibri\n\nCandara\n\nCentury Gothic\n\nConsolas\n\nDejavu Sans\n\nFranklin Gothic\n\nGill Sans\n\nHelvetica\n\nLucida Sans\n\nMS Sans Serif\n\nNeue Helvetica\n\nOptima\n\nSegoe UI\n\nTahoma\n\nTrebuchet MS\n\nVerdana\n\nWhere to Download Web Safe Fonts?\n\nThe great thing about web safe fonts is that you don’t have to worry about downloading them. They’re already supported by every visitor’s operating system, so you just need to code it in with CSS. If you don’t know anything about HTML and CSS or coding for the web, this might seem a bit overwhelming.\n\nBut trust us, it’s not as hard as you might think it is. We’ll walk you through the process step-by-step in our next section.\n\nHow to Add Web Safe Fonts to Your WordPress Website\n\nIf you have a WordPress site with the latest Twenty Twenty theme, you can edit the HTML fonts by adding custom CSS in the WordPress customizer.\n\nAccess it by clicking the Appearance > Customize link in the menu, and then expanding the additional CSS tab.\n\nThen you need to use Chrome Dev Tools (or a similar tool for another browser) to identify the selectors of the text you want to change.\n\nFor example, you can inspect the headline of your blog post:\n\nWe can see that the theme uses the standard “entry-title” selector for the headline. You can also search for the “font-family” attribute to see how the theme is styling the text, and at what level.\n\nSince Twenty Twenty doesn’t use a specific font for headlines, you can easily modify the headline’s font by targeting the “font-family” selector.\n\nFor example, if we want to change the headline to the Impact font, we can use the following code:\n\nh1.entry-title { font-family: Impact, Charcoal, \"Helvetica Inserat\", \"Bitstream Vera Sans Bold\", \"Arial Black\", sans-serif; }\n\nSimply add it to the additional CSS and click “Publish” to push your changes live.\n\nWe cover this and much more in our guide on how to change fonts in WordPress. If you built your website using HTML and CSS, you can edit the font directly in the source code.\n\nFor example, if you use the style tag in the HTML documents to apply CSS code to each page, you can edit the font-family attribute there.\n\nIf you want to change the font for all text on the page, you should target the “body” selector. If you want to change the font for specific text, you need to use a specific selector.\n\nIf you used a template to build your website, your CSS is most likely located in a separate stylesheet. This is great because it means you can change the font for your whole site by editing just one file.\n\nIn that case, you need to find your stylesheet file (typically named style.css or some variation of that). Then you need to find the section that controls the fonts and typefaces of your site.\n\nUsually, this is done towards the top. If not, you can search for “font-family” using your code editor of choice.\n\nSummary\n\nJust like with themes and plugins, there’s no shortage of options for you when it comes to font ideas.\n\nWith a variety of serif, sans serif, monospace, and even cursive fonts available for free, web safe fonts are a great place to start when creating a site.\n\nThe perfect fonts make your brand stand out, improve readability, and support your message. Choose wisely!"
