        "text": "English Language Arts\n\nStudents read and write across a variety of genres in middle school. In literature seminar, students use higher-level critical thinking skills to track theme development, draw conclusions, and make inferences. Teachers facilitate thoughtful discussions around texts and provide students an opportunity to express opinions, ideas, and critiques. In writing, students plan, write, and edit stories, essays, poems, and research papers. With a solid foundation in grammar and usage, students also begin to develop their own unique voice and style. Our teachers model every part of the writing process to set students up for success with their work.\n\nMath\n\nIn middle school students are invited to engage with mathematics through a problem-based curriculum. Critical thinking skills are developed as students analyze, process, discuss and solve real world and mathematical problems. Students will build a strong foundation in both algebraic thinking and data science and expand their number sense and geometric understanding. As these skills evolve, students learn to apply a variety of strategies, make connections across concepts, and most importantly learn that they are a mathematician.\n\nScience\n\nLeveraging the knowledge they developed in earlier grades, students dive into greater complexity in life science, physical science, earth and space science, and science practices. Students will not just learn science concepts, but they will explore and apply the science concepts to real-life situations to ensure that they are set up for success for a rigorous high school science curriculum.\n\nSocial Studies\n\nAt this age, your child’s ability to understand their place in society is really beginning to expand. They’re able to think more critically about who they want to become in the future. That’s why it’s important that they expand their understanding of the world through the study of civics, world regions, history, government and economics. They begin to analyze complex issues that affect their communities and the world. As they’re more immersed in the study of American history, they gain a greater understanding of their responsibilities as citizens within the values of American democracy."
