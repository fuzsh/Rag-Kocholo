The conventions I am examining are\n\nthematic, all having to do with the human being’s confron­\n\ntation with time--attitudes toward different stages of life\n\n*and toward the lapse of time and its relationship to many\n\nkinds of experience; the changes that time brings to human\n\njfaculties and perceptions; the impermanence of existence,;\n\ni\n\nworries that time is passing one by without the rewards of\n\nlove or pleasure; fears of deterioration and the grotesque-\n\nries of old age; and the anxieties about pain, death, and\n\neternal life.\n\nSuch concerns take several conventional forms and occur\n\nI\n\nin several genres--in drama, epic, prose romance, and ser­\n\nmons, as well as in lyrics. I have chosen to study four of\n\nthese conventions--cavpe diem3 eavpe florem, eternization\n\nthrough poetry and progeny, and ubi sunt--as they appear in\n\n1\n\nthe lyric poetry of Samuel Daniel, Edmund Spenser, Sir\n\nWalter Ralegh, Robert Herrick, and George Herbert. There\n\nare, of course, other conventions, such as memento mori^1\n\n2 3\n\n\\sic vita3 and the metaphor of the enclosed garden, that\n\ni\n\nI\n\nfocus on the vicissitudes of life and human concerns over\n\nmutability, decay, and death. I have, however, concentrated\n\non those four most interrelated-- the poet who is troubled by\n\nlife's transience, who cries out asking where men and monu­\n\nments of the past have gone, will also try to protect his\n\nown generation's men and monuments from the same fate. And\n\n:the poet who is aware of time's tyranny is also one who will\n\nI\n\n^counsel his readers to seize the day, to make use of every\n\nmoment of life. Furthermore, these four conventions have\n\ncommon classical origins and are the most popular among\n\nRenaissance poets.\n\nFor a detailed discussion on medieval and Renaissance\n\nattitudes toward death see Theodore Spencer, Death and\n\nElizabethan Tragedy (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press,\n\n1936), pp. 3-65.\n\n2\n\nEarl Miner in The Cavalier Mode from Jonson to Cotton\n\n(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1971), pp. 100-155\n\nsees the sie vita motif as including all concerns with time\n\nand the inconstancy of life, and frequently taking the form\n\nof carpe diem and oarpe florem.\n\n3\n\nSee Stanley Stewart, The Enclosed Garden (Madison:\n\nUniv. of Wisconsin Press, 1966), pp. 97-183.\n\nFor many readers in the twentieth century, the very\n\nnames of these conventions--in fact, the words \"convention” [\n\nI\n\nand \"conventional\"--tend to suggest poetry that imitates\n\n;other poetry, reiterates commonplaces and cliches, and is, '\n\ni\n\nperhaps, even unrelated to the life and times of the poet.\n\nThis idea of conventions is uncongenial to many modern\n\nreaders who, as Hallett Smith has said, tend to think that i\n\nthe proper context of poetry is \"the private experience and\n\nbiography of the poet--his particular feelings and 'person- ,\n\nality' which give him his own identifiable voice.\"4 But in\n\nthe late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, as Smith\n\nI :\n\nsays, the appropriate context of poetry is somewhat differ­\n\nent- -we must take into account a traditional literary con­\n\ntext familiar to writers and readers, which includes the\n\nkind of thematic conventions that I am exploring.\n\nIf one were simply to catalogue the poets* use of such\n\nconventions, it would not be very rewarding. What I have\n\ntried to describe is the way each of the poets under study\n\ndraws upon these received materials in fashioning his own\n\nthoughts and in developing his own idiom. I have found that.\n\n4\n\nElizabethan Poetry: A Study in Conventions, Meaning s 3 ■\n\nand Expression (1952; rpt. Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan\n\nPress, 1968), p. vii.\n\nin different hands and in different kinds of lyrics, the\n\nconventions function in varied and original ways. Often\n\nthey serve as an effective shorthand that contributes to\n\nthematic vitality, to both thematic and structural unity, !\n\nand even to the establishment of the poet’s unique and\n\nidentifiable voice.\n\nReading classical authors, Renaissance poets discovered\n\nthat the concern they felt over life’s transience had also\n\nbeen voiced by generations of the distant past. As Earl\n\nMiner has noted, \"The frailty of the human estate, or man's\n\n.subjection to time, are commonplaces of literature because\n\ni\n\n.they are commonplaces of life\" (p. 101). But each age and\n\neach group of people have their own individual anxieties and\n\nconcepts about time. For those living in Renaissance Eng­\n\nland, life was in a state of flux. Discoveries of new stars\n\n' 5 1\n\nand comets in the heavens, the Reformation and the estab­\n\nlishment of contending religious sects, and rapid social and,\n\neconomic changes brought about by industrialization and the\n\nexploration of the world in search of markets created new\n\nuncertainties about man’s role on earth and his relationship\n\nwith God. As a result, numerous works treating such concerns\n\n5\n\nGeorge Williamson, Seventeenth Century Contexts (Chi­\n\ncago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1969), pp. 10-15.\n\nwere published in sixteenth-century England. Two such books\n\nthat best reveal this period's concepts of time are Robert\n\nAshley’s 1594 translation of Louis LeRoy’s La Vicissitude\n\n! des Choses and John Norden's 1600 poetic adaptation of Ash-\n\nley's book. Ashley’s Of the Interchangeable Course or\n\nVariety of things in the whole World traces changes in cus­\n\ntoms, art, religion, and knowledge throughout history,\n\ncoming to the conclusion that all change works for the glory\n\n;of God and each age advances over the previous one. How-\n\ni\n\never, Norden’s poem, Vicissitude) Rerurrij an EZegiacaZZ Poeme\n\ni\n\ni\n\nof the interchangeable courses and variety of things in this\n\ni\n\n'world3 alters Ashley’s conclusion, seeing, as Roller states,\n\n\"the pitiable state of man, the victim of chance, change,\n\nand corruption (p. 230). Of the two views, Norden’s found\n\nmore acceptance and represents the dominant sixteenth-\n\ncentury view on time and change.\n\nI\n\nNorden’s repudiation of the idea of time as progress\n\ndominates English thought through the first half of the\n\nseventeenth century, but this attitude toward mutability\n\nsplits into two divergent concepts (Williamson, pp. 15-24).\n\n0\n\nKatherine Roller, \"Two Elizabethan Expressions of the\n\nIdea of Mutability,\" Studies in Philology, 35 (1938), 228-\n\n37 .\n\n.One, voiced in Dr. Godfrey Goodman's The Fall of Man3 ov the\n\nl\n\nCorruption of Nature Proved by Natural Reason (1616) , sees\n\nman and nature continuously decaying; the other, stated in\n\nDr. George Hakewill's Apologie or Declaration of the Rower\n\nand the Providence of God in the Government of the Norlds\n\nConsisting in an Examination and Censure of the Common Er-\n\nrour touching Nature's Perpetual and Universal Decay (1627),\n\nsees constancy in change and denies that the present age is\n\nmore degenerate than previous times.\n\nI These attitudes toward time were closely linked to\n\nireligious debates over the state of the human soul. For\n\nI\n\nexample, some theologians maintained that man is fallen, but\n\ncould merit salvation thfough faith and good works; others,\n\nthat man is totally depraved and could gain salvation only\n\nthrough the gift of grace. These differences in doctrines\n\ndid not mean, however, that all of the English accepted\n\nfreely one or the other concept or that they lived in\n\nstrict accordance with their church teachings. Personal\n\ndesires for worldly pleasures and fame frequently led indi­\n\nviduals to make their own compromises between Christian\n\ndoctrine and love of life.\n\n7 I\n\nSome people, of course, practiced submission to theo- j\n\n'logical decrees, a response prevalent in the church- j\n\ndominated medieval period. If life were but a preparatory\n\nstate for eternity, then people must submit to the earthly j\n\ntyranny of time, accepting the concept that mutability was\n\na direct result of the Fall. The human role was to submit ;\n\n•to divine judgment, place faith in redemption through •\n\nChrist, and so live as to be worthy of salvation, not damna-'\n\ntion. But for some, this orthodox submission was not en­\n\ntirely satisfactory. Unable to submit completely to tradi­\n\ntional church doctrine about life on earth and desirous of ,\n\ni :\n\nearthly love, fame, and self-expression, they developed a\n\ncompromised submission: one could accept one's theological\n\nfate and responsibilities while \"seizing the dayi\" It was\n\nt\n\npossible to love others, revel in the delights of youth, and\n\nfind pleasure and fulfillment in life without jeopardizing\n\none's eternal soul.\n\nA second course open to those of the Renaissance in\n\ntheir confrontation with time was defiance. While acquiescing,\n\nI\n\nin the common fate of humanity--age and death--one could yet.\n\n7\n\nJ. B. Leishman in Themes and Vavtattons -in Shake­\n\nspeare’s Sonnets (London: Hutchinson, 1961) divides this\n\nconfrontation into two parts: submission and defiance. _\n\n- 8 1\n\nI\n\ndefy time by resisting change (Leishman, pp. 108-09). One\n\nf 1\n\ncould remain young in heart though old in body, could plan j\n\nfor the future, negating and forgetting death, and could\n\nremain constant in beliefs, policies, and love. '\n\nFinally, a person could find ways to defeat time.\n\nThough time is a condition of post-lapsarian earthly exist­\n\nence, a divine punishment for Adam's sin, one's life could\n\nbe perpetuated in this world by two means: progeny and\n\npoetry. Propagation, on the one hand, was considered a\n\ntheological duty directed at the repopulation of heaven, an\n\nidea expressed by Edmund Spenser in his \"Epithalamion\":\n\nAnd all ye powers which in the same remayne,\n\nMore than we men can fayne,\n\nPoure out your blessing on vs plentiously,\n\nAnd happy influence vpon vs raine,\n\nThat we may raise a large posterity,\n\nWhich from the earth, which they may long possesse,\n\nWith lasting happinesse,\n\nVp to your haughty pallaces may mount,\n\nAnd for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit\n\nMay heauenly tabernacles there inherit,\n\nOf blessed Saints for to increase the count.\n\nBut children also form a continuation of one's existence,\n\nextending life into the future.

But no matter how a Renaissance\n\npoet reacted to time’s dominion over humanity, he frequently\n\ndrew on those four conventions of time --oarpe diem, oarpe\n\n! , florem, eternization through poetry and progeny, and ubi\n\nI\n\nsunt--adjusting them to his own needs.\n\n! Renaissance adaptations of these conventions have, of\n\n9\n\ncourse, been discussed by many critics and scholars.

The poets are arranged in\n\nroughly chronological order, beginning with Samuel Daniel,\n\nwhose Delia was the first long work of the sixteenth century\n\nextensively treating the themes of time and change. This\n\nchapter is followed by one on Edmund Spenser and Sir Walter\n\nI\n\nRalegh and finally by one on Robert Herrick and George Her­\n\nbert. Although my main concern is thematic, I shall, on\n\noccasion, refer to textual problems, sources, structures,\n\nand poetics as they become necessary for a complete discus­\n\nsion of a particular poet.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nCHAPTER I\n\ni\n\nI\n\ni\n\nUSE OF THE CONVENTIONS PRIOR TO\n\nTHE RENAISSANCE\n\nIn order to establish definitions and traditional\n\ni\n\nvariations of oarpe diem, oarpe florem3 eternization through1\n\npoetry and progeny, and ubi sunt, I shall briefly trace\n\ni\n\ntheir development prior to the English Renaissance, begin­\n\nning with the Greeks and Romans and continuing through the\n\nMiddle Ages to the Renaissance in Italy and France. In some\n\ninstances, as with ubi sunt3 I shall also examine Biblical\n\nand medieval English adaptations and variations.\n\nCarpe Diem\n\ni The most universally employed convention of time is\n\noarpe diem, with poets of many nations adapting it in both\n\nLatin and the vernacular languages. Horace's use of the\n\nphrase oarpe diem in Ode I.11 is well known:\n\n11\n\n12,\n\nI\n\nTv ne quaesieris, scire nefas, quem mihi, quem tibi |\n\nfinem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios j\n\ntemptaris numeros, ut melius, quicquid erit pati, !\n\nseu plures hiemes, seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam,\n\nquae nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare\n\nTyrrhenum: sapias, vina liques, et spatio brevi\n\nspem longam reseces. dum loquimur, fugerit invida i\n\naetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.1 !\n\nDon't ask, Leuconoe, the forbidden question, how long\n\nthe gods have given to you and to me: don't imagine !\n\nfortunetellers know. Better to take what is coming,\n\nwhether Jove allows us more winters, or this that now ,\n\nwearies the Etruscan sea as it beats on the cliffs\n\nis the last. Be sensible: strain the wine: in a\n\nlittle life,\n\ntake no long looks ahead. As we talk, time spites us\n\nand runs: reap today: save no hopes for tomorrow.2\n\ni ‘\n\nHere Horace (6,5-8 B.C.) expresses a hedonistic yet stoic\n\n|approach to the dominion of time over human life, advising\n\nI\n\nhis friend to treat each day as if it were the last, yet to\n\ntemper extravagant impulses. For Horace, time's spiteful\n\nindifference to man cannot be controlled or ameliorated, so\n\nman must not delay plans and hopes for a tomorrow that may\n\nnever be. All that one can do is to reap3 the day and use\n\nQ. Horati Flacct- Opera, ed. Edward C. Wickham (1901; >\n\nrpt. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1959), n.p.

Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1965), p. 37.\n\nTranslations are from this edition.\n\n3\n\nThe Latin word oarpe can be translated as either\n\n\"seize\" or \"reap.\" My preference is \"reap\" since this word\n\ni 3!\n\n[\n\nit to the fullest. This, however, does not represent the I\n\ni\n\n4 I\n\nonly focus of the convention or Horace's only use of it. 1\n\n■Before Horace made this moralistic use of the phrase and the|\n\ni\n\n'theme, several Greek poets had offered various approaches to’\n\nthe problem of devouring time. ;\n\nt\n\nSimonides (556-468 B.C.), looking at life philosophi-\n\ni\n\ni\n\ncally, had noted that youth seldom acknowledges or is aware :\n\nof ensuing age and death. Thus he counseled his reader to\n\nutilize time wisely, knowing well that man is mortal:\n\n1\n\nBut there’s one saying of the man of Chios which\n\n; passes all, \"The life of man is even as the life of a\n\ngreen leaf\"; yet few that receive it with the ear lay\n\nit away in the breast; for there's a hope which spring-\n\neth in every heart that is young, and so long as man\n\npossesseth the flowery bloom of youth there is much\n\nthat his light heart deems to have no end, counting\n\nneither on age nor death, and taking no thought for\n\nsickness in time of health. Poor fools they to think\n\nso, and not to know that the time of youth and life is\n\nbut short for such as be mortal! Wherefore be thou\n\nwise in time, and fail not when the end is near to give\n\nthy soul freely of the best.5\n\nbears a connotation of pleasure and fulfillment. The two\n\nwords may, however, be used interchangeably, and are often\n\ninterchanged by translators of Latin poetry.\n\n4See Odes 1.4, 1.7, 1.9, 1.11, 1.25, II.3, 11.11,\n\nIII.8, III.28, III.29, IV.7, IV.10; and Epodes XIII and XV.\n\nOf equal interest to this study is Ode III.15 (see Appendix\n\nA) which offers a reversal if not a refutation of the theme.\n\n5\n\nLyva Gvaeca, trans. J. N. Edmonds (Cambridge, Mass.:\n\nHarvard Univ. Press, 1964), II, 339.\n\n14*\n\nI\n\nSimonides looked to the serious side of life, but other\n\nGreeks were more willing to fill time with pleasure. Only\n\ni\n\nfragments remain of the works of Anacreon (b. 570 B.C.), but!\n\ni\n\nthese reveal the poet's epicurean approach and his pose as al\n\n\"festive and amorous septuagenarian.\" Anacreon's speaker\n\nlooks at life from old age, and with death impending, seeks -\n\nto fill his last days with wine and women. To him, death\n\nis \"dark\" and \"grievous,\" a place of no return:\n\ni My temples have grown grey and my crown bare and\n\nwhite; graceful youth is no longer with me, and my teeth\n\nare the teeth of an old man. There is left for me but\n\na short span of sweet life. And so I often make my moan\n\nfor fear of the underworld. For dire is the dark hold\n\nof death, and grievous the way down thither; and more,\n\n'tis sure that once down there's no coming up. (Anac­\n\nreon 69, Lyra Graeca3 II, 173)\n\nThe imagery focuses on death and the physical degeneration\n\nof an old man; all that is told of life is that it is\n\n\"sweet.\" But the intense description of old age and death\n\njuxtaposed to the minimal, understated modification of\n\n\"life\" places increased value on that little bit of sweet­\n\nness left to one approaching his last days. And it is this\n\nall-consuming consciousness of old age and impending death\n\n6\n\nGilbert Murray, The Li.teva.ture of Ancient Greece\n\n(Chicago: Phoenix Books, 19 56), p. 95.\n\nthat brings poignancy to Anacreon’s attempt to wrench pleas-i\n\nI |\n\nure from life.\n\nYet, if the extant convivial lyrics of Anacreon are too!\n\nI\n\nI i\n\nfragmentary to formulate an accurate evaluation of the >\n\nt ^\n\npoet's use of cavpe diem3 the poems that he inspired, col-\n\n7\n\nlected in the Anaeveontea, bear witness to his hedonistic\n\ninfluence on later Greek poets. In the Anaoveontea, more\n\nemphasis is placed on the amatory aspects of aarpe diem than,\n\non drinking and being merry. Frederick H. Candelaria re­\n\nmarks :\n\nThe boisterous good times around the table are still\n\nhere, but the fear of the poets is at least as great\n\nthat these feasts will not last as it is that the de­\n\nlights of love will be cut short by death. (p. 11)\n\nThe speaker is still an aged man, still seeking to seize the\n\nday, to exact all the delights of life from each surviving\n\nmoment:\n\n\"You're old, Anacreon,\"\n\nThe ladies say; \"look on\n\n\"Your forehead in the glass, and see\n\n\"How thin your love-locks be.\"\n\nAs for my hair, I wot\n\nNot whe'r 'tis thin or not;\n\nBut this I know, the nigher Death’s day\n\nThe more should old men play. {Anaeveontea 7)\n\nElegy and Iambus with the Anaoveontea3 trans. J. M.\n\nEdmonds (London.:__L.o.eb_Cl.as,s.i.cal_L,ib.r.aryL,_19_31.)_,„II______\n\n16\n\n! j\n\nThis tendency to concentrate on love and seduction as\n\nin the Anaoreontea continued to develop, with lyrics from\n\nThe Greek Anthology frequently displaying far more blata-nt\n\ni\n\nsensuality and less gentility than earlier poems. At times,!\n\nin fact, these later Greek lyrics ridicule refined attitudes\n\ntoward love and openly, often grossly, deprecate the woman\n\naddressed. The restraint or moral reserve employed by the\n\nearlier lyricists now often changes to open threat and en-\n\n‘ suihg punishment for those women who would withhold their\n\nphysical favors':\n\n’ Thou grudgest thy maidenhead? What avails it? When\n\n! thou goest to Hades thou shalt find none to love thee\n\nthere. The joys of Love are in the land of the living,\n\nbut in Acheron, dear virgin, we shall lie dust and ashes.\n\nAs has often been noted, here is a predecessor to Marvell’s\n\n\"Coy Mistress.\" This Anacreontic stance also foreshadows\n\nShakespeare’s speaker in his sonnet cycle, aged if not\n\nelderly, who speaks of love to a younger man.\n\nThe oarpe diem motif did not cease development with the.\n\nGreeks. The Romans, learning many of their poetic skills I\n\nfrom them, also adopted some of their thematic conventions\n\n8\n\nAsclepiades V.85 (3rd century B.C.), in The Greek\n\nAnthology3 trans. W. R. Paton, 5 vols. (London: Loeb Clas­\n\nsical Library, 1927), I, 169.\n\nand quickly expanded and individualized them. Catullus\n\n(87-57 B.C.), for example, not only brought to the conven­\n\ntion a new eroticism, but also brought a carpe diem urgency\n\n: to his best-known epithalamium, Carmen 61. The marriage\n\n\"day is passing\" {sed . . . abit dies), and the young bride\n\nand groom must reap the day, nurture the occasion, before it\n\n9\n\nends. Of equal if not greater importance to Renaissance\n\npoets is Catullus’ Carmen 5, translated and adapted by a\n\nmultitude of English writers:10\n\nVivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus,\n\nrumoresque senum seueriorum\n\nI omnes unius aestimemus assis!\n\n!

Not with such\n\nlight touch has Love cleaved to mine eyes that my\n\ndust should forget thee and live loveless. Even\n\nin the dark underworld the hero son of Phylacus\n\ncould not forget his sweet wife, but, yearning to\n\nenfold his dear one with phantom hands, the Thes­\n\nsalian returned in ghostly wise to his ancient\n\nhome. There, whatsoe’er I be, as Cynthia’s lover\n\nshall my shade be known; strong love o'erpasses\n\neven the shores of doom. There let the fair queens\n\nof old, whom the spoils of Troy gave to Argive\n\nhusbands, come in a troop to greet me! Yet the\n\nbeauty of none of these shall please me more than\n\nthine, and though the doom of old age delay thy\n\ncoming long--may earth be kind and grant this\n\n21\n\nboon!--yet shall the sight of thine ashes be dear\n\nto my weeping eyes: and like love long mayst\n\nthou that livest feel, when I am dust; then where­\n\nsoe’er death find me, it shall have lost its\n\nsting. Yet, Cynthia, I have a fear that thou\n\nmayst spurn my tomb, and some cruel passion part\n\nthee from my dust, and force thee, though loth,\n\nto dry thy falling tears. Continued threats may\n\nbend the will even of a loyal maid. Wherefore,\n\nwhile yet may be, let us love and be merry to-\n\ngether. Eternity itself is all too brief for love.\n\nLikewise, both Ovid (43 B.C.-A.D. 17) and Horace re­\n\nmarked frequently on the need for seizing the day. But, in\n\ncontrast to Propertius, who counseled men to fill life with\n\nlove before death separated them from their young ladies,\n\nOvid, in both the Remedies and The Art of Love3 made satiric\n\nuse of the brevity of life and the fragility of youth. To\n\nOvid, an unfulfilled love affair was but a waste of youth:\n\nquale sit id quod amas, celeri circumspice mente,\n\net tua laesuro subtrahe colla iugo.\n\nprincipiis obsta: sero medicina paratur,\n\ncum mala per longas conualuere moras.\n\nsed propera nec te uenturas differ in horas:\n\nqui non est hodie, eras minus aptus erit.\n\nuerba dat omnis amor reperitque alimenta morando;\n\noptima uindictae proxima quaeque dies,\n\nflumina pauca uides de magnis fontibus orta;\n\nplurima collectis multiplicantur aquis.15\n\n14\n\nElegies I.xix, in Propertius3 trans.

(Humphries trans., p. 133)\n\nAnd Horace, who used the carpe diem motif more than any\n\nother Roman poet, imparted a sober, stoic context to his\n\ndiscussion of time in all his usage--love, drinking, poli­\n\ntics. For him, every moment of life was to be used to the\n\nfullest and all poetry must be serious and moral.\n\nAfter the classical period, little use was made of the\n\ncitations from Ovid are from this edition.\n\n16Ovid: The Art of Love, trans. Rolfe Humphries\n\n(Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1966).\n\nconvention; Christianity, with its other-worldly emphasis,\n\nnaturally repressed hedonistic expressions of the use of\n\ntime. Even the Old Testament passages that might seem to\n\ncounsel a somewhat epicurean lifestyle, as in Ecclesiastes \\\n\n8:15: \"Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better,\n\n■thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be :\n\nmerry,\" or that suggest that the day should be filled with ;\n\nlove, as in the Canticles, were quickly moralized and alle­\n\ngorized to fit the teachings of the New Testament. But some\n\n^continuity with pagan attitudes can be seen in the lyrics of\n\n, 17\n\n: the wandering scholars of the twelfth and thirteenth cen- ,\n\nturies, and with the continental Renaissance, interest in\n\n18\n\ncarpe diem once again flourished. Both Tasso and Ariosto\n\nemployed carpe diem statements in their romance epics, and |\n\nmembers of the Pleiade, Jean-Antoine deBaif among them, not\n\nonly translated Greek carpe diem lyrics but again took up\n\n19\n\nthe theme as their own.\n\n17\n\nSee Helen Waddell, The Wandering Scholars (1927; rpt.:\n\nLondon: Constable, 1966), pp. xvi-xxv.\n\n* 18\n\nSince both poets tend to blend the symbolic rose with\n\ncarpe diem3 a discussion of these poets will be postponed\n\nuntil the section on carpe florem.\n\n19\n\nSee James Hilton, \"Ronsard and the Greek Anthology,\"\n\nStudies in Philology3 40 (1943), 103-27; Alice Cameron, The\n\nInfluence of Ariosto's Epic and Lyric Poetry on Ronsard and\n\nA la fontaine je voudrais\n\nAvec ma belle aller jouer.\n\nLa dedans l'eau nous irions tous deux rafraichir\n\nNotre amour trop ardent.\n\nMille douceurs, mille bons mots, mille plaisirs,\n\nMille gentils amoureux jeux se feraient la,\n\nMille baisers, mille doux embrassements la nous nous\n\ndonn1rions.\n\n— A la fontaine...\n\nNous irions par le fleuri pre courir aux.fleurs,\n\nCueillerions l’orfin et 11 argent et le pourprin,\n\nChapelets ronds et bouquets, chaines et tortils nous y\n\nli1rions.\n\n— A la fontaine...\n\nSi le destin le nous permet que feignons-nous,\n\nQue n'allons-nous jouir heureux de si beaux dons?\n\nEt le printemps nous y convie et de notre age la saison.\n\n— A la fontaine...\n\nPese bien: Qu’est-ce du monde, o mon amour doux?\n\nSi 11 amour manque et la plaisance, ce n'est rien:\n\nDu desir done et du plaisir recueillons, belle, le doux\n\nfruit.\n\n— A la fontaine...\n\nIn the pool I would like to go and sport with my fair\n\nlove. There in the water we would both go to cool our\n\ntoo ardent passion.\n\nA thousand caresses, a thousand loving words, a thou­\n\nsand pleasures, a thousand sweet amorous games would we\n\nhave there, a thousand kisses, a thousand soft embraces\n\nwould we exchange there.\n\nWe would go through the flowery meadow running from\n\nHis Group (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1930); and Sir\n\nSidney Lee, The French Renaissance in England (1910; rpt.\n\nNew York: Octagon Books, 1968).\n\nflower to flower; we would pick the golden, the silver, !\n\nand the crimson; garlands and posies, chains and coro- !\n\nnals we would weave there. I\n\ni\n\nIf fate allows us this, why do we linger, why do we\n\nnot go happily to enjoy such sweet gifts? The spring\n\ninvites us to them and this season of our life.\n\nConsider this: What is the world's use, 0 my sweet\n\nlove? If love lacks and enjoyment, it is nothing. So,\n\nfair maid, let us gather desire's and pleasure's sweet\n\nfruit. 20\n\nSome similarity to Carmen 5 of Catullus is apparent with\n\nI\n\ncaresses and amorous games replacing the infinity of kisses.:\n\ni\n\n.But it is a new kind of poem, one that yokes the spring\n\n!\n\n.season to a seductive use of carpe ddem3 offers a refrain,\n\n,and most interestingly, puts forth a claim that \"destin\"\n\n\\a1lows not only the time for love but also the passion it­\n\nself .\n\nCarpe d-iem3 then, is adjusted through the centuries by\n\neach poet, revealing each author's response to the brevity\n\nof life. Man's response to the urgency of time may well be\n\narchetypal, but as each poet considers life's transience,\n\nthe body's degeneration, and death's approach, he expands,\n\nadapts, and fuses prior expressions in an effort to declare\n\nhis peculiar concern and philosophy.

All quotations\n\nfrom the Pleiade are from this edition.\n\ndiem must therefore be broad; and so throughout this study j\n\nI shall use this term to mean a literary motif that im- j\n\nplicitly or explicitly counsels the utilization of each\n\nmoment of life, offering advice to \"reap the day.\" The\n\npurpose for such counsel may vary: it may be purely hedon- \\\n\nistic, promoting the doctrine of \"eat, drink, and be merry\";\n\nit may be seductive, an effort to win over a lady’s favors\n\nby enticement, argumentation, or coercion; it may be prag­\n\nmatic, preaching the need for conservation and full utiliza-'\n\nc\n\ntion of available time; and it may be theological, as in its\n\n;later use by George Herbert, urging the employment of life\n\non earth in preparation for life eternal.\n\nAlthough earpe diem can:'include a number of purposes,\n\nit should not mistakenly be expanded to include all seduc­\n\ntion poems, all drinking songs, all moralistic or theologi­\n\ncal poetic statements. The burden of definition must remain\n\ni\n\non the awareness of tyrannical time and the common termina­\n\ntion of each life--old age and death. Thus, I would not\n\ndefine as oarpe diem poems such as Christopher Marlowe’s\n\n\"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\" and Donne’s Holy Son- ,\n\nnets \"Thou Hath Made Me and Shall Thy Works Decay'.' and\n\n\"Death Be not Proud.\" Although the speaker in Marlowe's\n\npoem seeks to seduce a young woman, he nowhere shows an\n\nawareness of fleeting time or death or suggests a need to\n\nconsume time before it consumes them. In fact, part of the\n\nspeaker's argument is an offer of pastoral escape into\n\nitimelessness, into perpetual rural springtime. In contrast,\n\nl\n\ncarpe diem themes remain firmly embedded in reality, for\n\ntime is a problem of life on earth, not of an imaginative\n\n■\"never-never land\"; and to seek escape from the confines of\n\nreality is to erase time’s dominion, not defeat or defy it.\n\nAnd although John Donne’s speaker, in his colloquies with\n\nGod, acknowledges the dominion of death over life on earth,\n\n!his focus is on timeless eternity. He seeks an escape from\n\nworldly concerns and sin, a union with God, a release from\n\n21\n\ntemporal dangers to his soul. To the Christian, God and\n\n.heaven are outside the range of time; time is the nemesis of\n\nlife on earth, a result of the Fall; it bears no meaning in\n\nlife eternal.\n\ni\n\nCarpe Florem\n\nClosely linked to carpe diem3 if not merely a variation\n\nof it, is carpe florem. Both conventions convey an urgency\n\n21\n\nOn the mystic’s denial of time, see John Passmore,\n\nThe Per feet ability of Man (New York: Charles Scribner's\n\nSons, 1970), pp. 286-327.\n\n’ 2 '8’\n\ni\n\nto use each moment of life, for time is tyrannical, life |\n\nshort, and youth fleeting. But one primary difference i\n\ni\n\ni\n\nstands out. Whereas carpe diem may be explicit or implicit,\n\nI\n\nmay offer countless thematic variations ranging from hedon- '\n\nistic to Christian, and may -offer whatever images the poet i\n\nselects to express his philosophy, carpe florem contains one.\n\ninviolable aspect: the explicit incorporation of the image ,\n\nof a flower, usually a rose. Because this flower image\n\noften becomes a complex symbol, we shall take a closer look .\n\nat both the rose and the carpe florem convention.\n\n22\n\n: The symbolic rose is very old. Barbara Seward, who\n\nhas traced its use, remarks:\n\nNot only do its roots extend at least to the beginnings\n\nof recorded time, but its petals embrace the deepest\n\npositive values ever held by man. Although the flower\n\nis equaled in age and profundity by such fundamental\n\nsymbols as sea, sun, bird, star, and cross, it would\n\nbe difficult to prove that it has been surpassed by any.\n\n(P. 1)\n\nBrahma, the primal entity and creator of the universe in\n\nHindu theology, is said to have been born from the lotus, a\n\n22\n\nA detailed treatment is found in Barbara Seward's The.\n\nSymbolic Rose (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1960). See\n\nalso Peter Dronke, Medieval Latin and the Rise of European\n\nLove-Lyrics (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), I, 180-92 for\n\nRoman influence. Shorter discussions can be found in Miner,\n\nThe Cavalier Mode3 pp. 100-55, and Allen, Image and Meaning,\n\npp . 6 7 - 79 .\n\n29\n\ni\n\nrose-like flower; Isis, the Egyptian goddess of fertility, j\n\n|\n\n‘ is represented by the rose, symbolically denoting the re-\n\ni\n\ngenerative principle of life and the world; and Venus, also |\n\nI\n\n\\\n\nrepresented by the rose, is associated not only with human j\n\nlove and lust but also with fertility, marriage, and regen­\n\neration. Ultimately, the rose of Venus associated itself\n\nwith Cupid, the three Graces, and Dionysus, the deity of\n\n'vegetation and wine whose symbolic rose adorned festive\n\ntables, was woven into wreaths, and, depetaled, strewn into\n\nwine cups (Seward, pp. 10-14).\n\nYet this rose of pre-Christian eras had also a pejora­\n\ntive symbolism in addition to its joyous nature. Roses\n\nwither and die, reflecting the aging process and death of\n\nman, becoming in Rome both the flower of death and adorned\n\ngraves and the flower of afterlife in the Elysian fields.\n\n'And as roses bear thorns, pricking them who hold them care­\n\nlessly, so too love hurts and wounds. The rose to the pagan\n\nworld, then, represented lust and love, life and death,\n\nbeauty and decay, joy and sorrow; as Dronke has noted, it\n\nwas the flos flovum for man (pp. 181-84).\n\nWith the advent of Christianity, the rose, so thoroughly\n\nentrenched in the myths, thoughts, and literature of the\n\npagans, was finally adopted by the Church, but with numerous\n\nadaptations--if not reversals--of symbolic meaning. Epi-\n\ni\n\ncurean emphasis on earthly pleasures and human love con­\n\nflicted with the teachings of Christ: \"Thou shalt love the\n\nILord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and\n\ni\n\nwith all thy strength, and with all thy mind\" (Luke 10:27).\n\nDelight and enjoyment of worldly pleasures were denigrated\n\njas vanities of a fallen being; lust and sexual ecstasy were\n\ni\n\nregarded as perversions of true love. Man was to look to­\n\nward the next world, practice moderation, temper his ani-\n\ni\n\ni\n\n!malistic nature, and love God.\n\n1 The Church at first reacted negatively to the rose.\n\n!\n\n!According to Seward,\n\nTertullian and Clement of Alexandria, early doctors of\n\nthe Church writing in the second century, proscribed\n\nthe crowns of roses worn on festal occasions. As an\n\nemblem of Venus related to sex, the flower was for a\n\ntime the compulsory badge worn by prostitutes as a\n\nmark of disgrace. (p. 19)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nBut, as the Church soon learned, old habits and traditions\n\nare not easily excised from a people's way of life. And so\n\ntransformations were developed which reassigned symbolic\n\nvalues of the rose--transformations that appear simplistic\n\non the surface but which involve profound theological doc­\n\ntrines. The rose of the Elysian fields, then, under the\n\ninfluence of the Catholic Church, became symbolic of Eden;\n\n,the Roman flower of death was transformed into the repre- •\n\n■sentation of the deaths of Christ and his martyrs; the rose\n\n! of regeneration added to its meaning life eternal; and the\n\nI\n\ni\n\nsymbol of Venus attached itself to the Virgin. In other i\n\nwords, the pagan festive rose wreath, parodied in Christ’s\n\n; crown of thorns, became a Christian halo signifying charity,!\n\ni\n\n23 i\n\nholiness, and peace. Finally, the Rose of Sharon of the j\n\n’ Canticles, the beloved of Solomon, was allegorically trans- '\n\niformed into a representation of the Church itself, with the\n\ni i\n\n}Song of Solomon now read as an expression of the love and !\n\nI\n\nt ,\n\nmarriage of Christ and His Church. j\n\ni\n\ni\n\n: These changing symbolic values of the rose are clearly\n\nevident in even a brief survey of the changing use of the\n\nflower image. Roses, indeed all flowers, were employed in\n\nmany love poems, drinking songs, and poetic tales of the\n\ngods, and these frequently included the carpe diem motif.\n\nI\n\nAnacreon, in Ode 75, yokes love, flowers, and wine in an\n\nexpression of, if not carpe florem, at least the enjoyments\n\nof life:\n\nBring water, lad, bring wine, bring me garlands of\n\nflowers; aye, bring them hither; for I would try a\n\n23\n\nSeward, p. 10; for a discussion of this transforma­\n\ntion, see pp. 18-52.\n\n32]\n\nI\n\n!\n\nbout with Love. (Lyra Gvaeea, II, 177) I\n\nt\n\nAnd a poet included in the Anaareontea outlines the pagan ,\n\nattitudes and beliefs connected with the rose:\n\ni\n\nNow that the Spring\n\nHas brought the posies,\n\nCoy comrade, let me sing\n\nA song of roses.\n\nThe dainty rose is this, !\n\nGod’s darling, mortal's joy,\n\nThe wreathed Love-lads* bliss,\n\nGreat Venus’ toy;\n\n'Tis every buxom Grace’s glory,\n\n'Tis theme of Poesy and Story.\n\nOn wooing or winning days\n\nBy briary paths 'tis sweet\n\nTo fondle flowers that raise\n\nLight fancy's heat;\n\nWithout the rose what would befall\n\nThe Wine-God’s rite convivial?\n\nOf Nymphs with arms rose-red,\n\nOf Venus' roseate cheeks,\n\nOf Dawn rose - fingered\n\nThe poet speaks;\n\nBut others who no poets be\n\nDo pleasure find in this same tree.\n\nFor this the sick doth aid,\n\nThis guards the coffined corse;\n\nE’en Time by this is made\n\nTo yield perforce,\n\nFor roses old in years as well\n\nAs roses young do sweetly smell.\n\nAnd now shall I\n\nTo you recall\n\nThe rose's high\n\nOriginal?\n\n33 l\n\ni\n\ni\n\nWhen wet from the blue sea\n\nCame Venus, when Jove's head\n\nBrought forth the War-Lady\n\nThat was Heav'n's dread,\n\nThen too first bloomed from out the earth\n\nThis cunning work, this marvellous birth.\n\nAnd that the same, once born,\n\nLike Gods might ever life,\n\nWhen Bacchus to the thorn\n\nThe rose did give,\n\nHe 'still'd Heav'n's nectar o'er the tree,\n\nAnd so 't has immortality.\n\n(Anaareontea 55)\n\n( Spring, love, Venus, Bacchus, the sick and the aged, death\n\ni\n\nand immortality are linked as this Greek poem not only out­\n\nlines the pagan history of the flower but also yokes the\n\nflower to the pleasurable now. But a true aanpe florem\n\nmotif, an explicit statement of seizing the day or youth or\n\ntime coupled with a floral symbols, is not yet present. , Ex­\n\nplicit examples are, however, evident in the Greek Anthol­\n\nogy. In a poem by Rufinus, an overt comparison between\n\n'fragile youth and the decay of flowers suggests that young\n\nwomen must make use of time before time destroys their\n\nbeauty:\n\nI send thee this garland, Rhodoclea, that with my\n\nown hands I wove out of beautiful flowers. There are\n\nlilies and roses and dewy anemones, and tender narcis­\n\nsus and purple-gleaming violets. Wear it and cease to\n\nbe vain. Both thou and the garland flower and fade.\n\n(Greek Anthology, I, V.74)\n\n34\n\nJust as the Romans adopted the carpe diem convention\n\nfrom the Greeks, so too they used the flower image of their\n\npredecessors. Propertius, writing a seduction poem for his\n\nElegiarum Liber II* ends his carpe diem verse with an ex­\n\nplicit statement of carpe florem3 relating the decay and\n\ndeath of the rose to the future deterioration and destruc­\n\ntion of the speaker and his love:\n\nac ueluti folia arentis liquere corollas,\n\nquae passim calathis strata natare uides,\n\nsic nobis, qui nunc magnum spiramus amantes,\n\nforsitan includet crastina fata dies.\n\n(Elegies II.xv, Barber ed.)\n\nand as leaves drop from withered wreaths and\n\nthou mayst see them bestrew the cups and\n\nfloat therein, so we that love and whose\n\nhopes are high perchance shall find tomorrow\n\nclose our doom.24\n\n'Horace in his odes occasionally embellishes the frequent use\n\nof the carpe diem theme with the image of the flower, again\n\ncomparing the fading freshness of the rose to precarious\n\nyouth:\n\n0 Crvdelis adhuc et Veneris muneribus potens,\n\ninsperata tuae cum veniet pluma superbiae,\n\net, quae nunc umeris involitant, deciderint comae,\n\nnunc et qui color est puniceae flore prior rosae,\n\nmutatus Ligurinum in faciem verterit hispidam,\n\n24\n\nTranslation from Propertius, ed. and trans.

No matter what happiness\n\nand pleasure age can bring, they can never equal those of\n\nyouthful days.\n\nAnd finally, Ausonius, in \"De rosis nascentibus,\"\n\n■brings an eloquence and poignance to his sweeping view of\n\ntime’s toll on youth and beauty through his description of\n\na garden in which flowers bloom and die, ending with an\n\nadmonition to young women to make use of their youth:\n\nhaec modo, quae toto rutilaverat igne comarum\n\npallida conlapsis deseritur foliis.\n\nmirabar celerem fugitava aetate rapinam\n\net, dum nascuntur, consenuisse rosas . , .\n\nconquerimur, Natura, brevis quod gratia talis:\n\nostentata oculis illico dona rapis.\n\nquam longa una dies, aetas turn longa rosarum: . . .\n\ncum pubescenti iuncta senecta brevis. . . .\n\ncollige, virgo, rosas, dum flos novus et nova pubes,\n\net memor esto aevum sic properare tuum.\n\nAnother, which but late had glowed with all the fires\n\nof her bloom, now fades, abandoned by her falling\n\npetals.

Then,\n\nmaidens, gather roses, while blooms are fresh and\n\nyouth is fresh, and be mindful that so your life-time\n\nhastes away.25\n\nWith the advent of Christianity, the use of flowers in\n\npoetry, especially the rose, did not disappear, but it\n\nunderwent transformations. Two works of the late medieval\n\n2^usonius, Ausonius _ , ed. and trans. H. G. Evelyn White\n\n.(London: Loeb Classical Library, 1919), II,\n\n381\n\nperiod which stand out as most relevant to this discussion ,\n\n26\n\nare the Roman de la Rose and the Divina Commedia. Al- J\n\nthough neither of these works employs explicit carpe florem\n\niftotifs, both sufficiently influence Renaissance poets to\n\n27 '\n\nmerit consideration. Not only does the Roman introduce ;\n\nallegory to secular poetry, it also yokes to the rose, in\n\ni\n\nthe work of Guillaume de Lorris, the conventions of courtly\n\nI\n\nlove. Yet if the work contains no overt exhortation to 1\n\nseize the flower of youth, certain aspects of it show close\n\nI\n\nrelationship to this pagan convention (Candelaria, pp. 62-\n\n>66). The story takes place in May, the beloved is symbol­\n\nized by a rose, and it is the quest of the hero to possess\n\n26\n\nSee Seward, pp. 18-52, for a discussion of both these\n\nworks. '\n\n27\n\nThe exact influence of Dante on English poets is not ,\n\ncertain. He was known and used by Chaucer and Milton and\n\n.possibly by others. According to Werner P. Friederich in\n\nDante's Fame Abroad, 1350-1850 ([Chapel Hill]: Univ. of\n\nNorth Carolina Press, 1950), the Divine Comedy was not\n\ntranslated into English until 1782, a fact which attests to\n\nthe lack of favor Dante, a Catholic, hpd in Protestant Eng- J\n\nland.. The first French translation of the Paradiso came in ,\n\n1520 and the first complete translation in 1550. A complete\n\nItalian text was printed, however, in France in 1547. In\n\naddition, a Latin edition of the Divine Comedy was placed in\n\nthe Oxford library in 1382. One must remember also that\n\nmany Renaissance Englishmen traveled to Italy and were flu­\n\nent in Italian. Because of these various means by which in­\n\ndividual poets might have come to know Dante, discussion of\n\ndirect influence on any one poet will be postponed to the\n\nsections dealing with those poets.\n\nthat flower. Considering these facts and the setting, a j\n\nspring garden, the reader can discern a subtle insinuation !\n\nI\n\nthat time operates in this garden and that the lover must\n\nmake his conquest before the flower withers or is plucked by\n\n'another.\n\nIn contrast, Dante, in the Comedy3 leads his poet on a .\n\nspiritual quest culminating in a vision of heavenly glory.\n\nAnd at the core of this mystic sight stands a white rose.\n\n!\n\nIn one sense the rose is literally the flower of Beatrice,\n\n\"but of Beatrice exalted in eternal glory beyond the mortal\n\nwoman\" (Seward, p. 38), and as such \"the flower of mortal\n\n'love revealed as symbol and agent of the immortal\" (p.. 42) ;\n\nin,another, it is the image of Paradise on whose petals sit\n\nthe saints and the Virgin. On the allegorical level, the\n\nrose is representative of Christ's mission to mankind; on\n\nthe moral level, it symbolizes \"the spiritual love that\n\nI\n\nbrings about salvation in the human heart\" (p. 46); and\n\nfinally, on the anagogical level, it is the flower of God\n\nhimself, and as such, a representative of the mystery of the'\n\nuniverse. Thus in Dante, the pagan rose is apotheosized\n\ninto a symbol for Christian mysteries. And yet, even here,\n\none may see remnants of the oavpe florem convention. After\n\nexperiencing the vision of the mystic rose and a direct\n\n40]\n\nvision of God, Dante returns from his journey, back to earth\n\nand life. From this moment, enlightened readers privileged\n\nto view hell, purgatory, and heaven through the poet's eyes\n\n.must strive to use their time so that at death they may join'\n\nf\n\n'Beatrice in heaven permanently. Dante, of course, does not\n\nexplicitly state this in his poem, but an implied purpose ;\n\nbehind his journey is the education of his readers in\n\nChristian theology which counsels them to reap the day, to\n\njseize the rose through a good life. !\n\nWith the continental Renaissance, a return to explicit\n\nuse of the carpe florem convention is evident. The renewed\n\nI\n\ninterest in classical poets brought a profusion of transla­\n\ntions and adaptations of Greek and Roman poems and themes,\n\nand during the sixteenth century, a flourish of cross­\n\nfertilization of ideas and motifs took place between Italian;\n\nand French writers. Ariosto's use of the rose convention\n\nmay have contributed to Ronsard's and the Pldiade's delight\n\nin it, and these French poets themselves influenced later\n\nwriters, including Tasso in Italy. Both Italian and French j\n\npoets, of course, directly influenced sixteenth-century\n\nEngland.\n\nAriosto, in Orlando Furioso, reveals the double influ­\n\nence of the Roman de la Rose and Catullus' Carmen 62.\n\nI\n\nI j\n\ni i\n\nAdapting the carpe florem song of the young men and girls inj\n\nthe Latin epithalamium, he echoes the medieval French poem j\n\n!by giving the song to the love-sick Sacropant:\n\nLa verginella e simile alia rosa, ^\n\nch’in bel giardin su la nativa spina\n\nmentre sola e sicura si riposa,\n\nne gregge ne pastor se le avicina;\n\nl’aura soave e l’alba rugiadosa,\n\nl’acqua, la terra al suo favor s'inchina:\n\ngioveni vaghi e donne inamorate\n\namano averne e seni e tempie ornate. ;\n\nI Ma nom si tosto dal materno stelo\n\n; rimossa viene, e dal suo ceppo verde,\n\nche quanto avea dagli uomini e dal cielo\n\nfavor, grazia e bellezza, tutto perde.\n\n| La vergine che 11 fior, di che piu zelo\n\nt che de* begli occhi e de la vita aver de’,\n\n1 lascia altrui corre, il pregio ch’avea inanti\n\nperde nel cor di tutti gli altri amanti.28\n\n\"Like to the rose I count the virgin pure\n\nThat grow’th on native stem in garden fair,\n\nWhich while it stands with walls environed sure,\n\nWhere herdmen with their herds cannot repair,\n\nTo favor it, it seemeth to allure\n\nThe morning dew, the heat, the earth, the air;\n\nYoung gallant men and lovely dames delight\n\nIn their sweet scent and in their pleasing sight.\n\n\"But when at once * tis gathered and gone\n\nFrom proper stalk where late before it grew,\n\nThe love, the liking little is or none;\n\nBut favor, grace, and beauty all adieu.\n\nSo when a virgin grants to one alone\n\nThe precious flower for which so many sue,\n\nLudovico Ariosto, Orlando Furioso, 1.42-43, in Opere\n\ndi- Ludovico Ariosto, 3rd ed., ed. Adriano Seroni (Milano:\n\nUgo Mursia, 1966).\n\nr ' 421\n\n<\n\nWell he that getteth it may love her best, j\n\nBut she forgoes the love of all the rest.\"29\n\nThe rose here is a symbol of both virginity and love. For\n\nI\n\n; those who would pluck it, haste is a necessity, since once aj\n\ncompetitor captures the rose, it no longer is available or ;\n\nattractive to others. Interestingly, the burden of the\n\n■oarpe florem appeal lies on the young man. Differing from\n\n1\n\n'classical examples in which the woman is enticed to make\n\nuse of time before the bloom of youth is past, these stanzasj\n\nurge the man to seize the occasion before it is too late.\n\n!The rose is also employed by Ariosto in this book as one of\n\njthe visual allurements directed at Rogero in the enchanted\n\nland of Alcino, placing a moralistic indictment on its use\n\ni\n\nby linking it to the lures of an enchantress.\n\nI\n\nThis same stratagem is brought into play by Tasso in\n\nGerusalemme liberata3 this time as part of the temptations\n\nVoiced by Arminda in her bower of bliss (XIV.61-65) and in\n\nthe song of the beautiful bird on her Fortunate Isles:\n\n— Deh mira— egli canto— spuntar la rosa\n\ndal verde suo modesta e virginella,\n\nche mezzo aperta ancora e mezzo ascosa,\n\nquanto si mostra men, tanto e piu bella.\n\n29\n\nAriosto, Orlando Furdoso3 trans.

Edward\n\nPairfax (New York: Colonial Press, 1901).\n\nand not only provides a lyrical segment for Spenser to adopt\n\ni\n\nfor the Bower of Bliss, but also foreshadows the use by\n\nMilton, Spenser, and Jonson of an overt car-pe florem state­\n\nment carrying a covert authorial condemnation.\n\n|\n\n| Unlike the Italian poets who utilized the carpe diem\n\nx\n\nconvention in both epic romances and lyrics, members of the\n\nI\n\nI\n\njPleiade, excited over the publication of the Anacreontea and\n\n|the Greek Anthology in the mid-sixteenth century, limited\n\ni\n\ntheir use of these conventions to lyric poetry. Ronsard,\n\nespecially, found the carpe florem convention appropriate\n\nfor his love poetry. In his \"Quand vous serez bien vielle\"\n\nfrom the \"Sonnets pour Helene,\" the speaker attempts to\n\n;coerce his lady by reminders of death and old age, ending\n\njwith an admonition to seize the flower of life:\n\ni\n\nVivez, si m'en croyez, n'attendez a demain:\n\nCueillez des aujourd'hui les roses de la vie.\n\nI Heed me, live now, do not wait till tomorrow.\n\n; Gather today the rose of life.\n\n(Penguin Book of French Verse_ , II, 74)\n\n! And in his \"Mignonne, allons voir si la rose\" he gently\n\ncompares the rose's fragile freshness with life's transi­\n\ntoriness, ending again with a command to his lady to make\n\n'use of time :\n\nDone, si vous me croyez, mignonne,\n\n.Tandis que votre age fleuronne\n\nEn sa plus verte nouveaute,\n\nCueillez, cueillez votre jeunesse:\n\nComine a cette fleur, la vieillesse\n\ni Fera ternir votre beaute.\n\ni\n\nSo, if you will heed me, sweet, while your young\n\nyears bloom in their freshest newness, gather,\n\ngather your youth: as with this flower, age will\n\nwither your beauty.\n\n(Penguin Book of French Verse, II, 51)\n\nPoets Of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth cen­\n\nturies in England thus had numerous models and multiple\n\ni\n\nvariations to guide their use of this floral convention, for\n\neach of their predecessors, whether Greek, Roman, Italian,\n\n'or French, had found he could adjust the convention to his\n\nown needs. For this reason, a definition of carpe florem\n\nmust allow for individual variations. Basically, carpe\n\nflorem is a carpe diem statement incorporating flower or\n\nrose symbols, and because of the multiple meanings of this\n\n'symbol, it can be easily adapted to both hedonism and\n\nChristianity, immorality and stern morality.\n\nYet one must use caution when seeking out examples.\n\nAll poems that employ floral imagery are not necessarily\n\ntypes of this convention. Again, the burden of definition\n\nmust be on the ominous threats of time--change, age, decay,\n\nand death. The rose has served as image, in simple and\n\n461\n\ni\n\ncomplex forms, for many peoples, ages, and cultures, but in .\n\nI\n\nthe Renaissance, it may at times simply signify the Virgin\n\ni\n\nMary, Queen Elizabeth, or England herself, without impli-\n\nicitly or explicitly counseling the need to seize moments of j\n\nyouth before the advent of age and degeneration. The reader\n\ni\n\nmust therefore not assume that the rose always represents j\n\nt\n\nlove and youth, or that it signals a seduction lyric.\n\nI\n\nEternizat-ion through Poetry '\n\nUnlike oarpe diem and oarpe florem motifs, which seri­\n\nously waned in popularity during the Middle Ages because ofi\n\ntheir pagan philosophical attitudes, the theme of eterniza-\n\ntion through poetry was more adaptable to Christianity and\n\ntherefore suffered a less severe decline. Although pre-\n\nChristian and Christian attitudes toward life and death\n\ndiffered greatly, the need to immortalize a man's name and\n\ndeeds was felt by both pagan and Catholic. Motives perhaps *\n\ndiffered. Classical writers sought to defeat death by\n\nbuilding eternal monuments in verse to themselves, their\n\nlovers, friends, and countries; medieval Christians more\n\noften hoped to provide exempla for the people by teaching of\n\nthe good lives and deeds of saints, martyrs, and religious\n\nleaders. Most of this theological use, however, was in\n\nprose. From the time of the Greeks and Romans through the\n\nMiddle Ages, the theme recurs frequently, finally reaching\n\nits height in the French and Italian Renaissance.\n\nThe idea that the poet had the power to create enduring\n\nfame was a commonplace in ancient Greece: a fact to which\n\neven Homer's Helen attests in wishing \"that we may live in\n\nl\n\n32\n\nsong for men to come.\" Understanding this poetic power,\n\nTheognis set out to eternize Cyrnus and Theocritus, Hiero\n\n(Curtius, p. 476). Both Pindar (Olympic Ode XI) and Sappho\n\nalso utilized the theme (Lee, Shakespeare, p. 118) with\n\nISappho adding a new variation. Not content merely to immor­\n\ntalize others in her poems, she insists that her poetry will\n\nstand as her own lasting memorial:\n\nBut I have received true prosperity from the golden\n\nMuses, and when I die I shall not be forgot. (1.10)\n\n(Lyra Graeea, I, 193)\n\nOnce again the Romans adopted another of the Greek\n\nthemes, but few alterations can be noticed; the two varia­\n\ntions - -perpetuation of others and the eternal fame of the\n\npoet and his works--continue with little adjustment. Horace\n\nnot only expressly uses the Latin verb aeternare when\n\n32\n\nHomer, The Iliad, VI.359, trans. Robert Fitzgerald\n\n;(Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press, 1974).\n\n; 4 \" 8 1\n\ncelebrating Augustus in Odes IV.8, and denies the power of\n\neternization to any but the Muse of poetry: \"dignum laude\n\nvirum Musa vetat mori\" (\"the Muse forbids a praiseworthy man\n\nto perish\"), but he also comments that his poetry will be 1\n\nhis lasting monument guaranteeing him posterity’s praise:\n\nExegi monumentum aere perennius\n\nregalique situ pyramidum altius,\n\nquod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens\n\npossit diruere aut innumerabilis\n\nannorum series et fuga temporum.\n\n{Odes III.30)\n\nMy memorial is done: it will outlast bronze,\n\nit is taller than the Pyramids' royal mounds,\n\nand no rain and corrosion, no raging Northwind\n\ncan tear it down, nor the innumerable years\n\nin succession, and the transitory ages.\n\n(Clancy trans., p. 154)\n\ni\n\nSimilar comments can be found in the verses of Martial\n\n(X.27), Propertius (111.1; III.2; II.24b), Virgil, and Ovid.\n\nIn the Georgias j Virgil seeks a theme that will not only\n\nexalt himself but also his birthplace:\n\n. . . temptanda via est, qua me quoque possim\n\ntollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora.\n\nprimus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita supersit,\n\nAonio rediens deducam vertice Musas;\n\n33\n\nprimus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas;\n\n33\n\nGeorgias III.8-12, in The Eclogues and Georgias of\n\nVirgil3 ed. and trans.

Benzo of Alba (eleventh cen­\n\ntury) also viewed the role of the writer as perpetuator of\n\n34\n\nAs quoted in Curtius, p. 477. Curtius also lists\n\nexamples from Hildebert, Baudri of Bourgueil, and Walter of\n\nChatillon.\n\n50\n\nnames and deeds, but of far more importance to him was the\n\nrole of the poet as teacher, as the man who could provide\n\nexamples and guidelines for future generations through\n\n^stories of the past:\n\nI\n\nFortium quidem virorum nulla foret notio,\n\nSi periti literarum torpuissent otio;\n\nDefuisset exemplorum aurea memoria,\n\nNisi eos propalaret aliqua hystoria,\n\nMoyses iubente Deo scripsit mundi fabricam,\n\nAlii scribae dixerunt heroum prosapiam . . .\n\nNam si litterae celassent res aevi praeteritas,\n\nQuern, rogo, deberet sequi succedens posteritas?\n\n(Curtius, p. 477)\n\nNo investigator can pierce the might of men,\n\nIf the skillful in letters have grown numb through\n\nleisure;\n\nThe golden memory of characters fails in its duty,\n\nUnless it publicly reveals them in history.\n\nMoses ordered by God wrote the story of the world,\n\nOther writers told about the greatness of heroes . . .\n\nFor if books conceal things of past ages,\n\nWho, I ask, might succeeding generations follow?\n\n(My translation)\n\nYet if Benzo looked to the literary man for exempla, other\n\npoets of the period were able to separate their theological\n\nattitudes from their lay verses. Thus Abelard, in a poem to\n\nhis son Astralabius, voices a more classical attitude toward\n\nthe perpetuation of life through poetry:\n\nQui pereunt in se, vivunt per scripta poetae;\n\nQuam natura negat, vita per ista manet.\n\nPer famam vivit defuncto corpore doctus,\n\nEt plus natura philosophia potest.\n\n(Curtius, p. 477)\n\nL\n\n5 1 i\n\nI\n\nThey who themselves die, live through the works of poetry;;\n\nAs nature destroys, life endures through these.\n\nThe learned, though dead in body, live through fame,\n\nAnd philosophy can do more than nature can.\n\n(My translation)\n\ni\n\nThree centuries later, as a new love for classical '\n\npoetry arose during the French and Italian Renaissance, an '\n\nenhanced interest in the eternizing convention developed. ;\n\nJ\n\nt\n\nAriosto, in Orlando Fuviosodenies the ability of common\n\nt\n\nmen to provide lasting fame for others, citing the writer as\n\nthe only perpetuator of enduring renown:\n\ne son chiamati cortigian gentili,\n\nperche sanno imitar l'asino e '1 ciacco;\n\nde’ lor signor, tratto che n’abbia i fili\n\nla giusta Parca, anzi Venere e Bacco,\n\nquesti di ch'io ti dico, inerti e vili,\n\nnati solo ad empir di cibo il sacco,\n\nportano in bocca qualche giorno il nome;\n\npoi ne l'oblio lascian cader le some.\n\nMa come i cigni che cantando lieti\n\nrendeno salve le medaglie al tempio,\n\ncosi gli uomini degni da’ poeti\n\nson tolti da l'oblio, piu che morte empio.\n\nOh bene accorti principi e discreti,\n\nche seguite di Cesare l’esempio,\n\ne gli scrittor vi fate amici, donde\n\nnon avete a temer di Lete d’onde!\n\n(XXXV.21-22)\n\nAnd these, forsooth, good fellows call you must\n\nBecause they learn like ass and pork to be;\n\nBut when their lords be laid full low in dust,\n\nTheir line of life cut off by sisters three,\n\nYea oft by their own surfeiting and lust,\n\nThen these same goodly squires of base degree\n\nIn their vile mouths their names bear up and down\n\n1\n\nA while and after in oblivion drown.\n\nBut as the swans that here still flying are |\n\nWith written names unto the sacred port,\n\nSo there historians learned and poets rare 1\n\nPreserve them in clear fame and good report. !\n\n0 happy princes whose foresight and care I\n\nCan win the love of writers in such sort\n\nAs Caesar did, do as you need not dread\n\nThe lake of Lethe after ye be dead.\n\ni\n\nThe most consistent use of the theme is found, however,\n\n35\n\nin the sixteenth-century works of the French Pleiade.\n\nThese poets frequently claimed immortality both for those\n\ni\n\nwhom they cited in their poems and for themselves, with\n\nI\n\nRonsard evidencing perhaps the most blatant self-assurance,\n\nif not downright arrogance, in pursuing the theme. At times\n\nhe calls on Greek and Roman deities to aid in \"realizing his\n\nimmortal longings\"; at times, he \"bids his page bring him a\n\nhundred leaves of paper on which to write words which are to\n\nlast like diamonds and to be studied deeply by all future\n\nages” (Lee, French Renaissance, p. 278). Yet Ronsard seeks\n\nmore than a lasting fame among the French people; his aim is\n\na perpetual renown throughout the world:\n\nMon nom dez l’onde Atlantique\n\nJusqu'au dos du More antique\n\n35\n\nDiscussions of the French use of this conceit can be\n\nfound in Leishman, pp. 57-62 , and Lee, French Renaissance s\n\npp. 2 76-78.\n\n53\n\nSoit immortel temoigne,\n\nEt depuis l*isle erratique\n\n, Jusqu'au Breton esloigne,\n\nAfin que mon labeur croisse,\n\nEt sonoreux apparoisse\n\nLyrique par dessus tous,\n\nEt que Thebes se connoisse 36\n\nJ Faite Francoise par nous.\n\nMy name, from the Atlantic wave/.:\n\nAs far as the ancient land of the Moor,\n\nAnd from the wandering island\n\nUp to far away Breton,\n\nWill be an immortal testimony,\n\nIn order that my work not be deleted\n\nj But appear sonorous\n\n' And lyrical above all things,\n\nSo that Thebes shall recognize it\n\nMade French by us. (My translation)\n\n'And as he repeatedly claims to immortalize himself, so does\n\nhe claim to eternize others:\n\nMarie, a celle fin que le siecle advenir\n\nDe noz jeunes amours se puisse souvenir,\n\nEt que vostre beautd que j1 ay long temps aimee,\n\nNe se perde au tombeau par les ans consumge,\n\nSans laissir quelque marque apres elle de soy:\n\nJe vous consacre icy le plus gaillard de moy,\n\nL1esprit de mon esprit, que vous fera revivre\n\nOu long temps, ou jamais, par l'age de ce livre.\n\n(Quoted in Lee, French Renaissancej p. 61)\n\nMarie, so that when time brings our young lives\n\nTo their end, they can be remembered,\n\nAnd that your beauty that I have a long time loved\n\nIs not lost in the tomb by the consuming years,\n\nWithout leaving some marks of itself;\n\n36Pierre de Ronsard, \"A son livre,\" Oeuvres completes^\n\ned. Gustave Cohen (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1950), II,\n\n712.\n\n' I here consecrate you, greater than I,\n\nThe spirit of my spirit that you have revived,\n\nFor a long time or forever, through the life of this\n\nbook. (My translation)\n\nOther writers of the Pleiade continue this bold asser­\n\ntion of the immortality of the poet’s works, names, and\n\nthose they celebrate in verse. DuBellay not only echoes\n\nOvid's use of this convention, he also writes \"De Immorta-\n\nlite des poetes,\" exalting the poet while assuring all\n\npatrons that only poetry can create enduring monuments on\n\n[\n\nearth (Lee, French Renaissances p. 27).\n\nThe classical theme of eternization through poetry thus\n\ni\n\nwent through its ups and downs in popularity, but it neither\n\ndisappeared nor became wholly dormant from the time of the\n\nGreeks to the sixteenth century. Although some poets hoped\n\nto defeat time through their writing and others strove to\n\nwrite exempla, only two basic variations are noticeable--the\n\nself-perpetuation of the poet through his work and the\n\nimmortalization of those commemorated in verse. This eter­\n\nnizing theme, as it reached England in the sixteenth cen­\n\ntury, was quite standardized, with the poet explicitly\n\nvaunting his professional ability, if not divine inspira­\n\ntion, to create enduring fame. Poets of every era appar­\n\nently believed they were serving this function whenever they\n\n55\n\n■wrote of heroes, nations, friends, and lovers; yet to be\n\nconsidered as an example of the eternizing motif, a poem\n\nmust include some overt reference to the defiance of time,\n\nithe creation of an \"endless monument,\" or the preservation\n\nof a person’s name, fame, beauty, or virtue. Neither ele-\n\nigies, epics, nor commemorative verse are automatically\n\nrelevant to my present purpose without such explicit com­\n\nment .\n\nEtern-Lzation through Progeny\n\nj At the same time that the theme of eternization through\n\nIpoetry was prevalent, another type of eternization appeared\n\n--eternization through progeny--but with far less popular­\n\nity. The desire to perpetuate one's family, name, and self\n\n■through children, expressed by people of all cultures and\n\nages in numerous ways, needs no documentation. My concern\n\nhere is the expression of that desire in lyric poetry.\n\nParadoxically, however, statements about propagation, about\n\nperpetuating life through children, are seldom voiced in\n\nshort lyrics. While a prayer that children may ensue from\n\nthe nuptial bed develops as a formulaic segment of the epi-\n\nthalamion (Tufte, pp. 136-38), little use is made of the\n\ntheme in other types of lyric poetry. Two reasons for this\n\nsituation might be advanced. One might well be the\n\n56\n\negocentricity of poets who, as has been shown, are prone to j\n\n, l\n\np\n\nvaunt their ability to grant and achieve immortality. To\n\nl\n\nallow that ability to every man would be to diminish their 1\n\niown stature.\n\nA second, less hypothetical, reason is the nature of\n\nlyric poetry itself. This type of poetry has developed\n\nstandard themes, one of which is love. But poetic love has\n\ntraditionally been extramarital; Catullus sought to seduce\n\nhis Lesbia, Propertius his Cynthia, Tibullus his Delia;\n\nPetrarch, failing to win Laura in life, hoped to be reunited\n\nwith her in death; and Dante, surpassing all others, liter- !\n\ni\n\nally apotheosized Beatrice into a symbol of immortal love.\n\nIn these love songs, marriage is not mentioned. Perpetua­\n\ntion through children.appears, nevertheless, in occasional\n\npoetry--that poetry written for special events--such as\n\nepithalamia and celebrational hymns. One such poem is\n\nHorace’s \"Hymn for the Centennial,\" a segment of which sees\n\nchildren perpetuating the gaiety and customs of Rome:\n\ndiva, producas subolem, patrumque\n\nprosperes decreta super iugandis\n\nfeminis prolisque novae feraci\n\nlege marita,\n\ncertus undenos decies per annos\n\norbis ut cantus referatque ludos\n\nter die claro totiensque grata\n\nnocte frequentis.\n\n(\"Carmen Saecvlare,\" 17-24)\n\nGoddess, guide our growing young ones, and bless the\n\ndecrees of the city fathers concerning\n\nweddings, and may the laws of marriage bring forth\n\nmany new children,\n\nso that ten times eleven years, the proper\n\ncycle, may bring back singing and public games\n\ncrowded into three bright days and as many\n\nnights of rejoicing. (Clancy trans., p. 188)\n\nLittle if any use is made of this motif during the\n\nMiddle Ages. Once again, Christianity’s focus precluded\n\nmost self-centered desires for self-perpetuation on earth;\n\n.man’s role was to \"be fruitful and multiply\" so as to re­\n\nplenish the earth and, eventually, heaven. Thus even when\n\nJean de Meun continued the Roman de la Rose3 changing the\n\npoem’s focus from the sensual level to the moral, he coun­\n\nseled the reader to fulfill his theological duty of propa­\n\ngation. Although the eternization theme was the least popu­\n\nlar of the classical motifs treating time, new uses were to\n\noccur in poetry of the English Renaissance, culminating in\n\nits most famous application in Shakespeare’s sonnets.\n\nVbi Sunt\n\nIn tracing the popularity of the various motifs of\n\ntime, one major difference becomes apparent. Whereas oarpe\n\ndiem3 oarpe florem3 and eternization through poetry appeared\n\nfrequently in classical times, declined in various degrees\n\n: 58\n\n■\n\nduring the medieval period, and flourished once again in thej\n\ni\n\ncontinental Renaissance, uht sunt rarely appeared in Greek j\n\n,and Roman poetry, saw heavy use in medieval England and !\n\nFrance, and severely waned in the Renaissance. In other\n\nwords, there appears to be a complete reversal of the scale\n\nof popularity with this convention which asks \"where are\"\n\nthe illustrious men and women, nations, and beauty and glory\n\nof the past.\n\nA hypothetical explanation can be suggested for this\n\ni\n\ncontrast. Greek and Roman religious philosophies of life\n\noffered neither promises of eternal bliss nor threats of\n\neternal damnation. Whatever life after death might include,\n\nit could not compete with pleasures of earthly existence.\n\nAnd so, poets, except when writing epigraphs and funeral\n\nelegies, seldom bothered themselves with thoughts about the\n\ndead; what did find favor with them were attitudes about\n\nI\n\n'living. If life were short, then man must utilize his time\n\nadvantageously, filling his days with pleasure or work as he\n\nsaw fit. Consequently, poetic stress was on \"seizing the\n\nday,\" reaping the flower of youth, and eternizing a man’s\n\nfame on earth, not in the land of the dead.\n\nWith the establishment of the Christian Church, however,\n\na new use was made of ubi sunt. Man's earthly existence was\n\nconsidered but a testing ground, a preparatory state for\n\nlife eternal. Life itself was harsh and demanding, and to\n\nseek pleasure and worldly fame was to deny man's proper\n\n'purpose and duty. All man's thoughts, all his efforts, were\n\nI\n\nto be directed toward the salvation of his soul by living a\n\ngood Christian life, accepting the teachings and leadership\n\nof the Church, and trusting in Christ. If man lived accord­\n\ning to these principles, he could hope to \"find everlasting\n\n;happiness in heaven; if not, he would receive everlasting\n\nI\n\npain and damnation in hell. Christian poetry, then, began\n\nto employ this convention for theological teaching, yoking\n\nthe pagan question of the location of things past with\n\nreligious teachings and, at times, as consolatio. If life\n\nis transitory, man must utilize each moment for his soul’s\n\nsalvation; and if man mourns those who are gone, he can find\n\nconsolation, placing faith in the fact that those who are\n\ndead are now in the company of saints and in the presence of\n\nGod.\n\nIn contrast, Renaissance poets, though Christian, often\n\nfound new delights, new excitement, new hopes in life. They\n\nsought, as has been stated, to find accommodations between\n\nreligious emphasis on other-worldly existence and the pleas­\n\nurable now, frequently developing an ability to separate\n\ntheir poetic work from their religious beliefs. Greatly\n\n■influenced by Greek and Roman poets, they again emphasized\n\ni\n\nI\n\nclassical themes in their lyrics, themes of love, youth, andl\n\nJ\n\nj\n\npleasure. And youthful lovers and hedonistic seekers after\n\npleasure seldom look backward; their primary focus is on\n\ntoday and tomorrow. But when Renaissance poets chose to\n\nemploy the ubi sunt motif, they normally did so in one of\n\nthree ways: as a pagan or nontheological lament for lost\n\nyouth and glories; as an element of an exemplum, teaching\n\nthe transitory nature of life; as part of an elegy for a\n\ndead friend, with the poet employing variations of the medi-\n\n!\n\neval aonsolatio to ameliorate the grief engendered by the\n\nquestion \"where is he now?\"\n\nLooking at examples of pre-Renaissance use of the ub-i\n\nsunt convention, one can see the pagan policy of incorporat­\n\ning the theme in poems treating beauty's transience.. In the\n\nj\n\nfollowing lines from the Greek Anthology3 the speaker\n\ncruelly and satirically describes the faded youth of a\n\nwoman:\n\nWhere, Melissa, now is the golden and admired bril­\n\nliance of thy renowned beauty? Where are they, thy\n\ndisdainful brow and thy proud spirit, thy long slender\n\nneck, and the rich gold clasps of thy haughty ankles?\n\nNow thy hair is unadorned and unkempt and rags hang\n\nabout thy feet. Such is the end of prodigal harlots.\n\n(Greek Anthology, I, V.27)\n\n61 !\n\nI\n\nFor the courtesan, youth brings gold and precious stones,\n\nI\n\nbut age defeats even the most beautiful and vain woman, |\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsubstituting decay and poverty for past glory. j\n\nIn a similar context, Horace lambasts a lover who, in I\n\nthe full freshness of youth, repulsed the poet's advances:\n\nAvdivere, Lyce, di mea vota, di\n\naudivere, Lyce: fis anus, et tamen\n\nvis formosa videri\n\nludisque et bibis impudens\n\net cantu tremulo pota Cupidinem\n\nlentum sollicitas. ille virentis et\n\ndoctae psallere Chiae\n\npulchris excubat in genis.\n\nimportunus enim transvolat aridas\n\nquercus et refugit te, quia luridi\n\ndentes te, quia rugae\n\nturpant et capitis nives.\n\nnec Coae referunt iam tibi purpurae\n\nnec cari lapides tempora quae semel\n\nnotis condita fastis\n\ninclusit volucris dies.\n\nquo fugit Venus, heu, quove color? decens\n\nquo motus? quid habes illius, illius\n\nquae spirabat amores,\n\nquae me surpuerat mihi,\n\nfelix post Cinaram notaque et artium\n\ngratarum facies? sed Cinarae brevis\n\nannos fata dederunt,\n\nservatura diu parem\n\ncornicis vetulae temporibus Lycen,\n\npossent ut iuvenes visere fervidi\n\nmulto non sine risu\n\ndilapsam in cineres facem.\n\n(Odes IV.13)\n\n62\n\nThey listened, Lyce, to my prayers, the gods did,\n\nthe gods listened, Lyce: you are showing your age,\n\nyet you try to look pretty,\n\nyou play around and you drink hard,\n\nand when soused, you attempt to wake sluggish Cupid ;\n\nwith a shaky song. He stands alert for the lovely j\n\nface of blossoming Chia |\n\nwho knows how to sing to the lyre.\n\nFor he flies in disgust by the withered-up oak\n\ntrees, and he hurries away from you because teeth\n\nturned yellow, because wrinkles !\n\nand snow-white hair make you ugly.\n\nRobes of Coan purple and expensive jewels\n\nwill never bring your day again, once and for all\n\nsealed in the public records,\n\nshut fast by time in its flying.\n\nWhere is Venus, ah, where is your beauty? Where is\n\nthat grace of movement? What remains of her, of her\n\nwho once seemed to breathe with love,\n\nwho stole me away from myself,\n\nand was joyful, with Cinara gone, and famous\n\nfor lovely face and charming manner? The Fates gave\n\na few years to Cinara,\n\npreserving Lyce a long time,\n\nso her days would equal those of the ancient crow,\n\nand the hotblooded boys could come and have a look,\n\nnot without plenty of laughs,\n\nat a fire crumpled to ashes.\n\n(Clancy trans., pp. 182-83)\n\nOf special interest in this poem is the revealed close rela-'\n\ntionship between oavpe d-iem and ubi sunt. Lyce is, of\n\ncourse, old, past the time of life when she can successfully\n\nseize the day for love. And yet, behind the brutal portrait\n\nof this aging woman is an implied warning to others to\n\n63!\n\nI\n\nutilize each moment o£ youth to the best advantage; once age;\n\n!\n\nI\n\nhas come, beauty and love are gone. Thus, while the poem I\n\n- I\n\nseems a reversal of traditional oavpe diem3 stating that the'\n\ni\n\n.time for love is past, the moral appears the same.\n\nf\n\n_ That medieval poets knew of these examples of ub'L sunt3\n\nhowever, is impossible to prove. Few medievalists were I\n\ni\n\nskilled in the Greek language, and although Horace and other\n\nRoman poets were read throughout the Christian Middle Ages,\n\n'there is no certainty as to what classical literature an\n\nauthor may or may not have read. Yet this motif could have\n\ncome from another source--the Bible. Life's transience is a,\n\ntheme prevalent throughout the Old Testament, and though the\n\ndoctrine of eternal reward after death is not mentioned,\n\nBiblical exegesis deftly provided allegorical interpreta­\n\ntions to link Hebrew scripture to Christian doctrine. Job,\n\nsitting in ashes, dressed in sackcloth, seeking to under-\n\n»\n\nstand that which has befallen him, cries out: \"But man\n\ndieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and\n\nwhere is he?'f (Job 14:10). His question remains unanswered\n\nand he in turn has no reply to God's \"Where wastthou when\n\nI laid the foundations of the earth?\" (38:4). What Job does\n\nlearn, however, is to place trust in his Lord. And Zecha-\n\nriah, prior to his vision and prophecies of the restoration\n\n: ■ \" 6 4 i\n\ni\n\nof Jerusalem, also receives instructions from God, reminding,\n\ni\n\nhim of the mortal nature of man: \"Your fathers, where are\n\nthey? and the prophets, do they live for ever?\" (Zech. 1:5).\n\nWhatever the source, however, medieval Christian poets j\n\nemployed the conventions to voice their own philosophies,\n\nadjusting past motifs to their individual perspectives.\n\nWith the establishment of Christianity in the British\n\nislands, a strange mixture of pagan and Catholic doctrine\n\ncan be noticed in many poems. One such poem, \"The Wan- 1\n\nderer,\" is of special interest in this study. This elegy\n\n!\n\ntells the story of a man who had known pleasures and honor :\n\n1 .\n\nlin his lord’s hall but, because of the death of that lord,\n\nnow wanders the earth homeless, bemoaning his fate. But if\n\nthis appears to be but a tale of Germanic eomi-tatus 3 it also|\n\ni\n\ncontains Christian elements in the form of a concluding\n\nsermon. The wanderer, lamenting past glories, asks:\n\n\"Hwaar cwom mearg? Hwaar cwom mago? Hwaar cwom ma]p]?umgyfa?\n\nHwaar cwom symbla gesetu? Hwaar sindon seledreamas?\n\nEala beorht bune!

Alas the armored warrior!\n\nAlas the glory of princes! How time has past.\n\n(My translation)\n\nOnce again, as in Job, no answer to the question is given,\n\nbut this time an explicit rejoinder is presented to the\n\nreader by the \"snottor on mode,\" the wise man, to keep faith\n\n!\n\nin God, for that is where all security remains:\n\n. . .

Well is the one who seeks mercy,\n\ncomfort from the Father in heaven, where all our secur­\n\nity stands. (My translation)\n\nAlthough 'the English language underwent complex trans­\n\nformations during the following centuries, the ubi sunt for­\n\nmula remained a popular poetic theme. One of the Middle\n\nEnglish lyrics appearing most often in today’s anthologies\n\nis \"Ubi Sunt Qui Ante Nos Fuerunt?\" a poem found in three\n\n38\n\nversions in medieval manuscripts. This lyric reveals a\n\nChristianization of the pagan convention, establishing a\n\ncomparison between pagan and Christian modes of life. Peo­\n\nple who reveled in life, who sought their paradise on earth,\n\n38\n\nSee E. K. Chambers and F. Sidgwick, eds., Early Eng­\n\nlish Lyrics (New York: October House, 1967).\n\n66\n\n'are now gone and the poet asks:\n\nWere beth they biforen us weren,\n\nHoundes ladden and hauekes beren,\n\nAnd hadden feld and wode,\n\nThe riche levedies in hoere hour,\n\nThat wereden gold in hoere tressour,\n\nWith hoere brightte rode?\n\nEten and drounken and maden hem glad;\n\nHoere lif was al with gamen ilad;\n\nMen keneleden him biforen;\n\nThey beren hem wel swithe heye;\n\nAnd in a twincling of an eye\n\nHoere soules weren forloren.\n\n(Chambers and Sidgwick, p. 163)\n\nThe poet then answers his own question, telling the reader\n\n•that these people are now in hell. In contrast, he adds,\n\nChristian men can defeat the devil through faith in Christ\n\nand through prayer; with such a prayer he ends his poem:\n\nMayden moder, hevene quene,\n\nThou might and const and owest to bene\n\nOure sheld ayein the fende.\n\nHelp ous sunne for to flen,\n\nThat we moten thi sone iseen,\n\n1 In joye withouten hendel\n\nAmen! (p. 16 5)\n\nMedieval French poets also showed much interest in ubi\n\nsunt3 finding it suitable for both \"regrets\" and expressions\n\nof the transitory nature of the world. For example, the\n\nanonymous author of \"Guillaume de Palerne\" (Friedman, pp.\n\n499-505) employed the ubi sunt format in a \"regret,\" voiced\n\nby the grieving mother of a child carried off by a werewolf.\n\n'And Francois Villon, expressing abject despair over life’s |\n\nI\n\ni\n\ntransience in The Testament3 frequently employs the conven- 1\n\ntion to show the fate of all men. Unlike most medieval\n\niEnglish poets, however, Villon appends no Christian conso- j\n\nlation, no statement about eternity, no hint of hope. He,\n\nlike Job, asks an unanswerable question:\n\nDictes moy ou, n'en quel pays, '\n\nEst Flora la belle Rommaine,\n\nArchipiades, ne Thais,\n\nQui fut sa cousine germaine, ‘\n\ni Echo parlant quant bruyt on maine '\n\nDessus riviere ou sus estan,\n\ni Qui beaulte ot trop plus qu'humaine.\n\n; Mais ou sont les neiges d’antan?\n\nTell me where, or in what land\n\nis Flora the lovely Roman,\n\nor Archipiada, or Thais\n\nwho so resembled her,\n\nor Echo speaking when one called\n\nacross still pools or rivers,\n\nand whose beauty was more than human. 3g\n\nBut where are the snows of bygone years?\n\nAfter the middle period, little explicit use is made of\n\nubi sunt. Poems treating mutability and the brevity of life\n\nwere often written during the continental Renaissance, but\n\ni\n\nman’s focus had changed; life no longer was seen as merely\n\nharsh and unyielding; it could be exciting and pleasurable.\n\nThe Complete Works of Francois Villon3 trans.

Quant a moi, j'aime mieux trente ans de renommee\n\nJouissant du soleil, que mille ans de renom\n\nLorsque la fosse creuse enfouira mon nom,\n\nEt lorsque notre forme en une autre se change,\n\nL'homme qui ne sent plus n'a besoin de louange ...\n\nFor my part, I prefer thirty years of fame in the\n\nlight of the sun to a thousand years of renown when\n\nthe hollow tomb has swallowed up my name, for when\n\nour form changes into another, the man who no longer\n\nfeels has no need of praise. {Penguin Book of French\n\n; Vevse3 p. 76)\n\ni\n\nFor Ronsard and others, life was painfully short, but far, '\n\nfar better than death. Life was to be lived to the fullest,\n\nwith the ultimate pleasure derived from love and fame on\n\nearth.\n\nThe ubi sunt convention, then, is of both classical and'\n\nBiblical origin. Treating life's transience, it was used by\n\nGreek and Roman poets to express the inevitable decay of\n\nyouth and beauty and by medieval poets to lament the brevity1\n\nof life, often as prelude to a statement of Christian faith.\n\nYet no matter how it was used, it showed an affinity to the\n\ncommand to \"seize the day.\" For whatever the expression,\n\nubi sunt serves as a reminder of death, subtly urging the\n\nreader to capture each available moment while yet there is\n\n,time--time for love, for gaining fame, for earning eternal\n\nbliss .\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nSAMUEL DANIEL: STRUCTURE AND SEQUENCE\n\nMore than 150 years have passed since Samuel Coleridge,\n\nnoting the resemblances between the poetry of Samuel Daniel\n\nand that of William Wordsworth, remarked that Daniel was\n\n\"one of the golden writers of our golden Elizabethan age,\n\ni\n\nnow most carelessly neglected.\"1 This neglect continues in\n\nthe twentieth century, especially for Daniel the lyricist.\n\nI\n\nNo complete collection of Daniel has been published since\n\nGrosart’s edition of 1885, a book marred by frequent errors;\n\nmost critics ignore Delia, concentrating instead on the\n\nauthor's \"The Complaint of Rosamond,\" \"A Defence of Ryme,\"\n\nThe Civill Wavs, poetic epistles, and masques; and those\n\ncritics who discuss Daniel's lyrics speculate on whether\n\nDaniel influenced Shakespeare, Lodge, and Wordsworth. They\n\n1Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Li, ter aria, ed.\n\nGeorge Watson (1906; rpt.

The extent of this influence has, however, ■\n\nnever been seriously explored.\n\nOther critical investigations have concerned Daniel's\n\n2\n\nsources. Some scholars have called Daniel a plagiarist, a .\n\n'translator, or a typical Elizabethan who adapted classical\n\nand continental poems for practice in attaining poetic\n\nskills. But we need not enter these arguments, asking\n\ni\n\nwhether Daniel relied more on classical, Italian, or French '\n\npoets, nor enter the conflicts over sources of individual\n\npoems. It is clear that Daniel borrowed lavishly from poets'\n\nas diverse as Petrarch, Desportes, Du Bellay, Ronsard, Tan-\n\n3\n\nsillo, Tasso, della Casa, Tebaldio, Guarini, and Cariteo.\n\n*But one point to be noted is that he never blindly followed\n\nanother writer's arrangement of themes.
