        "text": "Dobyns-Bennett is most certainly a very...interesting school. Some teachers are flat out creepy---specifically the art teacher---one of the librarians look like they're apart an adult website, some staff members have obvious favorites---my girlfriends and I always got yelled at for standing in the cafeteria while the group of boys next to us were fine---and a lot of the students are almost completely naked but doesn't get in trouble. A lot of the rooms are either too hot or cold, most bathrooms are treated poorly (this also applies to the cafeteria), and some parts of the school is absolutely wrecked. Overall subject-wise the school is great. There isn't a lot of after school activities, but with the ones that are given, there's a bit of diversity. The food is good on most days, but there's a few cases they served raw/burnt food, which is not worth the 5-10 minute wait. So the school is overall okay, minus the fact you can jump over the railings.\n\nDobyns Bennett is widely known for their outstanding band program led by Lafe Cook, but many of our other successful clubs and students are not as highly recognized. For example, Dobyns Bennett has an incredible robotics team who competed in the world championships and dedicated most of their free time practicing. Dobyns Bennett is also home to many dedicated athletes that have taken home state titles such as Willa Rodgers (DB Women's tennis), Bryce Barrett (Track and Field), or most recently the DB Softball team (2024). Not only does Dobyns Bennett provide an amazing strength program but they are also accredited for their advanced placement classes. Dobyns Bennett was created in 1918 leaving need for improvements within their infrastructure. Unfortunately when I was a sophomore the Dobyns Bennett Dome had partially collapsed which meant that home basketball games were not really \"home\" anymore. Loud drilling and banging became an everyday part of my Junior year schedule.\n\nI loved my time at Dobyns-Bennett. The best parts were the administration and their willingness to help their students learn and be prepared for the world. I graduated in 2022 and I still think about those special teachers in my life and how much they impacted me. There were few bad moments, but those would have to be my experiences with some fellow students.\n\nI am very grateful to have gone to this school, primarily due to the sheer amount of doors it opened for me as a student. There were extracurriculars available for just about every interest/pursuit, and I found myself participating in at least three for the duration of my studies. I was well-prepared for ACT testing, and I had many teachers who were very supportive and good at their jobs."
