        "text": "Senior Spotlight: Alexandra ‚ú® Q: What are your plans after you graduate? A: I will attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in Architecture. I hope to become an architect that focuses on human-focused designs. (Alexandra recently took home 1st place in the Chicago Architecture Center‚Äôs Newhouse Architecture + Design Competition ‚Äì Large Division. This incredible achievement marks her third win in the competition throughout her high school career!) Q: Why did you decide to go to Bennett Day School? A: I chose to go to Bennett Day because I wanted to go somewhere I was allowed to voice my opinions on things I wanted to learn about. I wanted to learn about topics that interested me and were related to things I am passionate about. After my shadow day, I knew I would feel confident in the Bennett community. Q: What are you excited for after Bennett? A: I am excited to meet new people and broaden my horizons. In my time at Bennett, I have learned how to create new connections and I am thrilled for what the future holds for me.

Students were particularly excited about their in-house visit from sociologist/crime researcher Jacob Miller, who came to Bennett from the crime lab at the University of Chicago. They also visited the Chicago History Museum, DuSable Museum of African American History, and Jane Addams Hull-House Museum. Students used this learning to create their interactive Demo Night experience. Each participant was given the identity of an American based on real-world people, and then had the opportunity to understand the world as the American they have been given approaches it. The 11th and 12th graders have spent the last twelve weeks learning about ‚ÄúThe World of Coffee‚Äù, from researching the impact of fair trade practices to exploring the health benefits of coffee to interviewing cafe owners about their businesses. We heard a talk from Elmer, owner of Anticonquista Caf√©, who grew up working on his family‚Äôs coffee farm in Guatemala; met with Kristi, an entrepreneur and CFO of U3 COFFEE; spoke with representatives from the West Loop Small Business Association; visited the North Central College coffee lab; and toured independently owned cafes around the city. The students have worked in teams to create comprehensive business plans for a future Bennett coffee shop. They have carefully considered the local coffee market, customer needs, best business practices, funding and cost analysis, ethical product sourcing, menu creation, branding and marketing, interior design, and health and safety codes. All of their work was distilled into a concise and informative business pitch that was presented and voted on at Demo Night. ü©µ #discoverbennettday #projectbasedlearning #demonight #learnbydoing #coffee #handsonlearning #PBL #chicagohighschool #independentschool #westloop #fultonmarket #westtownchicago\n\nSenior Spotlight: Leslie ‚ú® Q: What are your plans after you graduate? A: I will be attending the University of Michigan (my dream school) where I‚Äôll be pursuing Sports Management and aim to receive a dual degree in Business Administration as well. I love sports, soccer to be specific, and I really want to pursue a future where I can combine this passion with my financial and business literacy skills. I hope to one day work with my favorite soccer team, FC Barcelona), in their Club Management or Finance departments to eventually become their Treasurer. I have also received various scholarships like the Dell Scholarship awarding me $20,000 to use in 6 years, the HEAR Scholarship ‚Äì a four-year renewable scholarship of $5,000, and the ATLAS Fellow Scholarship providing me with up to $20,000 in scholarships every year! Thanks to ATLAS, I will be taking on my first professional internship at an investing firm this summer! Q: What‚Äôs your favorite project-based learning (PBL) memory? A: My favorite PBL was the food PBL during my sophomore year. Not only did we learn about the various ways of food production, but we also got to visit a Two-Michelin Star Restaurant called Ever Restaurant. Visiting Ever, I felt inspired and took a risk in asking for a job. I was 15 at the time, with nothing but a passion for the culinary arts. To my luck, they took a chance in me and allowed me to become a part of their team. I became the youngest chef there for about 2 years, until it was time for something different. While I‚Äôm no longer there, if it wasn‚Äôt for that visit , I wouldn‚Äôt have meet the most amazing people who believed in me and gave me the confidence to be myself and follow my dreams. Q: Why did you choose/decide to go to Bennett Day School? A: I wanted something different. I knew I needed a small environment for me to open up and come out of my comfort zone. I‚Äôve always been a shy introvert and after coming to Bennett, I found my voice and am now capable of presenting myself and standing in front of people.

Students spent time visiting locations around the city, such as the native gardens at the University of Illinois Chicago to learn about indigenous plants in the Chicago area, and the Native Truths exhibit at the Field Museum. Since then, students have been learning about the historical and environmental science essentials necessary to understand the theme, building physical and digital models, and learning how to make their ideas come to life, all while diving deep into cross-curricular content. Inspired by various indigenous communities from all over the world, student groups replicated traditional games, instruments, housing structures, gardening methods, ceremonies, and more. This week, Demo Day attendees got to interact with these creations, listen to student presentations, and ask questions. ü©µ #discoverbennettday #projectbasedlearning #progressiveeducation #demoday #learnbydoing #STEAM #STEM #indigenous #indigenouspeople #indigenousplants #middleschool #independentschool #chicagoschool #purposedrivenlearning"
