        "text": "Mission\n\nNorth Bennet Street School’s mission is to train students for careers in traditional trades that use hand skills in concert with evolving technology, to preserve and advance craft traditions, and to promote greater appreciation of craftsmanship.\n\nThe School’s intensive, hands-on training helps students from around the world to achieve meaningful lives and livelihoods. We encourage individual growth and curiosity, along with technical mastery and a commitment to excellence.\n\nValues\n\nAs the cornerstone of North Bennet Street School, our Values guide all that we do and embody the essence of who we are as an institution. Rooted in a deep commitment to craft and trade education, we dedicate ourselves to providing an exceptional learning environment that equips our students with the skills, knowledge, and expertise needed for success.\n\nWe enrich our educational experience by fostering an inclusive environment that embraces and respects diverse perspectives and talents. We are committed to providing equitable access to quality education, supporting self-actualization and progressive growth for all.\n\nMeaningful Work: We recognize the intrinsic worth and dignity in every craft and trade, and in all the professions that support both the educational experience and workplace success. Each task, from the simplest to the most complex, is honored and valued for its quality and impact.\n\nCommunity: We maintain an inclusive environment that fosters collaboration and mutual support. We recognize the value of working closely with individuals who hold diverse perspectives, talents, beliefs, and backgrounds. Embracing these differences enriches our educational experience and prepares us to navigate the entire ecosystem of professional craft and trade.\n\nStewardship: We responsibly manage and preserve our resources, ensuring the longevity of our tools, materials, and traditions. This stewardship includes our legacy, reputation, financial health, and knowledge, helping to sustain our craft and trade practices for future generations.\n\nRespect: We treat each individual with honor, respect, and consideration in all interactions. We acknowledge the dignity of each person’s journey in growing their skills and finding their unique path in work and life. Our respect extends to the unique contributions and experiences of both our peers and predecessors.\n\nExcellence: We are committed to achieving the highest standards in every area of the institution, especially but not limited to craftsmanship and education. This pursuit encompasses expertise, professionalism, and continuous improvement, ensuring our graduates are well-prepared and highly skilled in their chosen trades.\n\nOpportunity: We empower our students and community by providing equitable access to quality education and skill development in the crafts and trades. Our commitment to opportunity enables the capacity to self-actualize, supporting progressive growth and the pursuit of one’s full potential.\n\nEducation\n\nWe offer both Career Training programs, for those seeking intensive, career-oriented study, and Community Education classes, for those eager to learn a new skill or perfect an existing practice. We also develop programming to teach traditional trades to young adults.\n\nWe’ve used the same teaching approach for more than a century, but our course design is always evolving. We shape our course content around the recommendations of our students, graduates, employers, and artisans. Our goal is to prepare students for a successful career, where they’ll use hand skills to build objects that last.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPauline Agassiz Shaw, the School’s founder, was a visionary educator and supporter of the “Sloyd” system of manual training. This Swedish method focuses on the development of character, intellectual capacity, and hand skills, which includes an understanding of tools, materials, and processes. It also encourages a great sense of care and a commitment to excellence. Ultimately, the method seeks to teach the “whole person” how to make a living and how to lead a fuller life. Today, the philosophy of Sloyd remains at the heart of the School. View a timeline of our history to learn more about how our School developed over 140-plus years.\n\nDiversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI)\n\nIn keeping with our mission and history, and as leaders in craft education, we dedicate ourselves to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusivity within our school, and throughout the areas we serve. We are committed to cultivating a School community where individual differences are expected, supported, respected, and valued. We embrace our obligation to improve our institution’s culture, strengthen our partnerships, and positively impact the future of the industries for which we train.\n\nAccreditation\n\nNorth Bennet Street School is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC), a recognized institutional accrediting agency by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nNon-Discrimination Policy"
