        "text": "I'm trying to identify a font of which I don't even have an image, only a very distinct memory. I remember it having seen used in technical charts of about the 1950s / 1960s, e.g. diagrams describing the NASA satellite and moon missions. It is sans-serif, all caps, or actually more all small-caps since the letters tend towards a square aspect ratio more typical of small letters. The letters have a very clean appearance with no ornaments, none or almost no variation in line width, straight line ends, and a clear rhythm (without being monospaced). The weight is medium to bold.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what I'm talking about?\n\nUpdate: Thanks to JennaDesign who found an image containing the font:\n\nWhat I was thinking of is the font used in the bold labels in the lower part of the image in all small-caps, \"mission\", \"edition\", \"date\". Comparing with the title of the document \"flight plan\", it appears now as if the other labels are actually the small letters of a small caps font, whose large letters are used in the title.\n\nDoes someone know what this font is?"
