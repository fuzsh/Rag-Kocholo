        "text": "The purpose of this final exercise was for us to be able to identify the distinguishing characteristics of four different sans serif fonts: Optima, Futura, Helvetica, Gill Sans. I had to created a grid of the letters “A” “a” “Q” and “n,” one in each font type, and give two characteristics describing the differences that letter as apart from the other three.\n\nThis exercise helped me to hone in on the tiny details that can make a letterform the way it is. It was challenging to find multiple differences between some of the letterforms, especially the capital “A” for Helvetica and Gill Sans, which are quite similar. Overall, this exercise helped drill type anatomical characteristics and terminology into my brain."
