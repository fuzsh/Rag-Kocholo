        "text": "Massimo Vignelli\n\nMilan, Italy, 1931 â New York City, New York, 2014\n\nIntroduction\n\nMassimo Vignelli is one of the most important protagonists in the history of design, and graphic design in particular. He designed graphic systems that had, and still have today, a tangible utility for millions of people everyday, thanks to his determination in basing the design on a true understanding of the usersâs real needs.\n\nThrough both his deep cultural commitment and his real comprehension of the design discipline, Vignelli crucially contributed to the design profession by keeping alive and also promoting the evolution of the fundamental principles that were developed by the Modern Movement during the early 20th century, thus revealing to everyone their ongoing validity.\n\nA validity that we can see in his own design, as demonstrated by both the strength and functionality that still characterise it, and also by the interest toward Vignelliâs design shared by thousands of people from all over the world. The work of Vignelli indeed shows a timeless validity housed in its pragmatic, rational, and visually forceful nature.\n\nVignelli taught us to appreciate the functionality and elegance of simple, rational shapesâan aesthetic that is result of a deep cultural sensitivity, before being a matter of style or taste. His opera will always be an excellent example to make people understand the social value of design and to make designers understand the need to adopt a professional discipline that will allow to properly manage such a responsibility.\n\nI will be forever grateful to him for being the first one to believe in Designculture and giving me the first interview, for his interest toward my own work, and for sharing with me his thoughts about design.\n\nEnjoy your reading,\n\nTO THE TOP â\n\nWhoâs Who\n\nMassimo Vignelli has been one of the most important designers of the 20th century. A deskmate of Heinz Waibl from 1946 to 1950 at the Arts High School in Milan, and a classmate of Marirosa Toscani Ballo at the Brera Academy of Arts in 1948-50. He studied architecture at the Politecnico of Milan in 1951-53 and the School of Architecture at the University of Venice in 1953-57, but interrupted his studies before graduating.\n\nSince he was 16 years old, he started to collect a series of short internships with some of the best Italian architects and designers of that time â Achille Castiglioni and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Giulio Minoletti, Giancarlo De Carlo, Franco Albini, and Ignazio Gardella.\n\nA table lamp from the series Fungo, that Vignelli designed with Paolo Venini in 1955.\n\nWhile still a student at Brera, Vignelli worked for Rotofoto, the photo agency of Fedele Toscaniâfather of internationally renowned photographer Oliviero Toscani. While he was based in Venice, he designed a series of lighting fixtures for his friend Paolo Veniniâfounder of the eponymous blown glass manufacturing companyâinclusing the iconic Fungo lamp (1955). In the same period, he also designed a house that was built in the Venetian and published on Domus magazine (May, 1955) realising that âthe architectural process was too slow if compared to the speed of the industrial design process.â He then started to focus more and more on editorial, product, and packaging design projects.\n\nIn 1957 Vignelli married Elena Valle, who from than on became known as Lella Vignelli (1934-2016). Lella came from an important family of architectsâhis brother was renowned architect Gino Valle (1923-2003)âshe was an architect too and a fundamental professional partner to Massimo during his entire career. The same year the couple left for the USA, where Vignelli was offered a fellowship from a silverware manufacturing company based in Newburyport, Massachusetts. While working there, he was invited to teach graphic design at the Institute of Design, New Bauhaus in Chicago, where he acted as an educator in 1958-59. Meanwhile, Lella started working as an architect at SOM (Skidmore, Owings and Merrill)âone of Americaâs best-known architectural firms.\n\nIn 1960 their visas expired and the couple moved back to Milan, where they opened the Lella & Massimo Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture (1960-64) focusing on furniture, product, and graphic design for important Italian and European companies like Olivetti, Penguin Books, Piccolo Teatro, Pirelli, Poltronova, Triennale, Venice Biennale, and Xerox. The first assistant of Vignelli at his office was Salvatore Gregorietti, who will also became one of the best designers in the history of Italian graphic design. It was at that time that the Vignellis defined the basis of their expressive language and started receiving official recognitions for their workâin 1964 the Compact stacking dinnerware that they designed was awarded a Compasso dâOro, one of the most prestigious design awards in the world.\n\nLella and Massimo Vignelli, âCompact,â stacking dinnerware for ARPE, 1964 (MoMA Collection).\n\nVignelli also continued teaching at Umanitaria School in Milan in 1960-64 and the University of Venice in 1962-64. A colleague at both academies was Bob Noorda, one of the very best designers in the history of Italian graphic design. Since Noorda and his wife Ornellaâalso a designerâshared a similar design attitude to that of the Vignellis, they started to consider the possibility to collaborate in a joint studio. Ralph Eckerstromâformer design director of CCA (Container Corporation of America) for whom Vignelli worked during his permanence in Chicagoâwas also asked to join the initiative and on January 4, 1965 Unimark International, Corporation for Design and Marketing was founded, also in partnership with Larry Klein (a Chicago-based designer), James Fogleman (former design director at Ciba), and Wally Gutches (former plant manager at CCA).\n\nUnimark is a milestone in the history of design. It was the first design consultancy with an international scope and offices worldwideâChicago, New York, Milan, Detroit, Johannesburg, Cleveland, Denver, San Francisco, London, Melbourne, and for a short time Copenhagen, Aspen, and Palo Alto. Vignelli was design director and senior vice-president, coordinating the work of all the offices to be visually consistent. It became soon one of the worldâs best design firms producing iconic projects that are still part of the peopleâs visual culture. The list includes Ford (1965), Knoll (1966), and American Airlines (1967) corporate identities, as well as the New York City Subwayâs sign system (1966) and its Graphic Standards Manual (1970).\n\nThe work done by Vignelli at Unimark indelibly marked the entire worldâs graphic design production and offered the most important contribution to the fortune and fame of the typeface Helvetica. (While unfortunately Lella couldnât join the firm because of U.S. laws from that time forbidding married couples to work together.)\n\nIn 1971 Vignelli left Unimarkâthat soon went bankrupt in almost all of its officesâand established a smaller firm called Vignelli Associates, where he could work together with his wife. The couple developed projects in all the fields of design, following their belief saying that âdesign is oneâ discipline that can be applied to many different fields. During that time, Vignelli designed many projects for major companies including Knoll (1972-87), Bloomingdaleâs (1972), Lancia (1977), US National Parks Service (1977), Sothebyâs (1981), Cinzano (1984), Ferrovie dello Stato (1999), and many others. As Vignelli himself stated, his design can be described as âsemantically correct, syntactically consistent, and pragmatically understandableâvisually powerful, intellectually elegant and, above all, timeless.â\n\nLella and Massimo Vignelli, âIntervista,â series of armchairs for Poltrona Frau, 1989.\n\nIn 1970 Vignelli designed a diagrammatic map for the New York Subway System, following Harry Beckâs design criteria from his London Underground map (1933)âthus using only 45 and 90 degrees lines. In this way the route diagram was simplified and reading the map is self-explanatory. While today this solution is an international standard, at that time passengers felt uncomfortable with a map that didnât match the real geography, so in 1970 it was dropped and replaced with a conventional map.However, in 2008 Vignelli was invited to design a new diagrammatic map that was later revised in collaboration with his assistants, Beatriz Cifuentes and Yoshiki Waterhouse, and finally adopted as the official map of the New York Subwayâs app.\n\nIn 2008 the Vignellis founded and designed the Vignelli Center for Design Studies at the RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology). The institution houses the archives of Lella and Massimo Vignelli, striving to promote their design legacy all over the world.\n\nDuring his career, Vignelli taught at the Institute of Design (New Bauhaus) in Chicago in 1957-58, the Umanitaria School in Milan in 1960-64, the University of Veniceâs School of Design in 1962-64, the Columbia Universityâs School of Architecture in 1967-68, the Philadelphia College of Art in 1969, and the Parsons School of Design in 1980-81. He also gave lectures and workshops in China, Europe, and the USA.\n\nHe has been a member of ADI (Industrial Design Association) since its founding in 1956, and also served on its board of directors in 1960-64. Member of AGI (Alliance Graphique Internationale) since 1965, he was also president in 1985-88. Former president of AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) in 1976-77. Former vice-president of the Architectural League of New York. Member of IDSA (Industrial Designers Society of America).\n\nVignelli was awarded numerous recognitions including the Triennale Grand Prix in 1964, two Compasso dâOro awards in 1964 and 1998, the AIA (American Institute of Architects) Industrial Arts Medal in 1974, the AIGA Gold Medal in 1983, the first Presidential Design Award in 1985, and the Architectural League of New York Presidentâs Medal in 2011.\n\nHe also received lifetime achievement awards from the Brooklyn Museum in 1995 and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in 2003. He was inducted in the ADC (Art Directors Club) Hall of Fame in 1982 and elected Honorary Royal Designer for Industry in 1996 by the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects). He also received honorary doctorates in fine arts and in architecture from the Parsons School of Design in 1982, the Pratt Institute in 1987, the Rhode Island School of Design in 1988, the University of Venice in 1994, the Corcoran School of Art in 1994, the Pasadena Art Center College of Design in 2000, and the RIT in 2002.\n\nHis work is part of the permanent collections of major museums including the Brooklyn Museum, Cooper-Hewitt Museum, Die Neue Sammlung, Met Museum, MoMA, Victoria & Albert Museum, and Vitra Museum. He also had individual exhibitions in Boston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York City, Milan, Toronto, Miami, Moscow, Leningrad, Helsinki, London, Budapest, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Munich, Prague, and Paris.\n\nMany books have been published by Vignelli himself and others regarding his work. The best-known are Design:Vignelli (Rizzoli, 1990), Vignelli: From A to Z (Images Publishing, 2007), and The Vignelli Canon (Lars MÃ¼ller Publishers, 2010), that he also released as a free PDF.\n\nHe died in New York City in 2014.\n\nEnjoy your reading,\n\nTO THE TOP â\n\nQuotations\n\nâAppropriateness transcends any issue of style.â\n\nâAn architectural education is fundamental for graphic design.â\n\nâA good building costs no more or less than a bad building.â\n\nâDesignculture has the same value to that of Neue Grafik, the most important magazine of its era. It represents a fundamental historic moment in the development of our profession and reveals the importance of the seminal work done by our generation to new designers.â\n\nâDesign is not art. Design is utilitarian. Art is useful, but not utilitarian.â\n\nâIf you can design one thing, you can design everything.â\n\nâMassimo Vignelli conceived design as a form of pureness. He fought against who worked without any professional dignity generating visual pollution,â Italo Lupi.\n\nFor more quotations visit The Words of Vignelli.\n\nTO THE TOP â\n\nQ&A\n\nPublished Sep 9, 2013\n\nRecorded Feb 24-May 15, 2013\n\nWhat did you want to do when you were growing up?\n\nExactly what I have done: working in all the fields of design, from graphic design to architecture, from interior design to product. As I have always said, âDesign is Oneâ.\n\nWhat was your educational path?\n\nBasically working in the studios of the greatest architects of my time: Achille Castiglioni and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Giulio Minoletti, Giancarlo De Carlo, Franco Albini, Ignazio Gardella, and many others, before as a ruler penman and then as a partner. Moreover, the cohousing with Max Huber was a great occasion to learn much about graphic design. Then, the experience with glass design at Venini. Always with a great passion for architecture and industrial design.\n\nWhat was your favorite subject at school?\n\nAt the art school: Architecture, History of Art, and Decoration.\n\nWhen and how did you start your career?\n\nI did my first job when I was 16, working for the Castiglioni brothers; and with all the others until 22 years old. Then I started working freelance in graphic design, packaging, and exhibit design.\n\nWhat is the project that you remember with most pleasure and interest?\n\nEvery project, from the one I did on the very first day to the last one that I made yesterday.\n\nA project that you would like to realise.\n\nA corporate identity for a country, for example Italy or Vatican City. I will go to the Pope and say: âYour Holiness, the logo is O.K., but everything else has to go!â\n\nThe companyâs graphic image of American Airlines has been changed after 45 yearsâwhen it was redesigned by Unimark. When is it better to change a visual identity and when to retain it?\n\nDesign reflects the responsibility towards the producer and the consumer and naturally constitutes a durable solution. Styling is ephemeral and gives shortlasting solutions. They have a different liability towards the user and it is economically important to understand such a difference. In a coordinated image for the industry it is important to design a long-lasting identity. The implementation of a new image is expensive and canât be changed for the sake of novelty orâeven worseâto cover up the shortcomings of a bad management. The same goes for design of furniture that, unlike a dress, will not be thrown away after a short time. Forced obsolescence is a crime, an expression of social irresponsibility that increases waste of energy and money, damaging the users.\n\nOne or more designers that you admire.\n\nThere are many, unfortunately almost all dead. In graphic design Pierre Mendell, in architecture Mies van der Rohe, in industrial design Dieter Rams (still alive), in furniture design Charles Eames, in editorial design Willy Fleckhaus. And many others.\n\nA typeface that you like.\n\nThe new digital edition of Helvetica, called Neue Haas Grotesk. [Note: It was the original name of Helvetica, when it was first introduced by the Haas Type Foundry in Switzerland in 1957.] It is perfect and with many weights: thin, light, regular, medium, bold, extrabold, etc.\n\nOne of the first advertisements promoting Helvetica. Designed by Max Miedinger, 1957.\n\nCan you tell me the story of how Helvetica was brought to Italy?\n\nIt was 1960 and no one in Italy had Helvetica. So I went to Felice Nava, whose printhouse was then located under Max Huberâs apartment, and asked him to go to Switzerland and buy it. A man of few words, he only answered: âIâll go!â and left. On the way back, once at the customs, the border officers became suspicious seeing that his car was running really slow and all squashed to the ground. âWhy is your car walking so low and slow?â they asked him. âWellâ¦ It could be the carburettor!â Of course it was full of lead blocks! They searched the car and confiscated all the typecases. When he came back to Milan I asked him what we should do and he said: âHuh, now Iâve wised up! I'll come back to Switzerland and pass the border through a different way!â This is what he did and this is how Helvetica was brought to Italy. From then on Navaâs fortune began: all the graphic designers went to him because he was the only one with the right typeface. [Note: âVignelli asked Nava to go to Switzerland and buy the lead blocks for that typeface [â¦], but Nava wasnât the only one with Helvetica in Milan. Tipocromoâthat later changed its name in to Cromotipoâalso had it in their catalogue,â as Giancarlo Iliprandi stated. After researching, I came to the conclusion that the first one to use Helvetica in Italy could have been Egidio Bonfante for the covers of Edizioni di ComunitÃ , printed by the Stabilimento Poligrafico G. Colombi in 1960.] The peculiarity of Helvetica didnât lies only in its shape, but in the fact that the types didnât have shoulders, so that the letters could be set almost sticked one to the other, obtaining a unique compactness which was lacking with all the other typefaces.\n\nIs it better drawing a new font or using the existing ones?\n\nThere are two main font families: serif (elzevirs) and sans-serif (grotesks). In both families there are some (few) great typefaces, the rest is commercial production. Among the serifs we have Garamond, Bodoni, Baskerville, Century Expanded, and Clarendon. Among the sans we have Futura, Gill Sans, Helvetica, Univers, and Optima. Sometimes it is possible to use a font with a weird look, but only to set a title or a logotype. There is no need to design a new font: What matters is the typographical structure, not the typeface!\n\nAnd what about Our Bodoni, the typeface that you designed in 1989 in collaboration with type designer Tom Carnase?\n\nOur Bodoni originated from our need to match Bodoni with Helvetica, keeping the same body-size with the same upper- and lowercase proportions. I think such an operation is more useful than designing a new typeface. There are many typefaces that could be improved through a redesign, for example Century. We did the same with Our Futura, changing the proportions and making them similar to Helvetica: higher lowercase and lower uppercase, improving the x-height and the kerning.\n\nHas the way people perceive the design changed?\n\nDefinitely, but it is still unclear the marking between design and styling. Design is permanent, styling is ephemeral. The responsibilities are different, so are the results. However, we appreciate much more the aesthetic valueânot the ethicâtoday than fifty years ago. Design, good or bad, is now part of our environment: It is around us and it has an influences on us.\n\nAn old photograph portraing the German Pavilion by Mies van der Rohe, Barcelona, Spain, 1929.\n\nA piece of architecture that you appreciate.\n\nVilla Savoye by Le Corbusier, the Barcelona Pavilion by Mies, and the National Assembly Building of Bangladesh by Louis Kahn. In my opinion, the three masterpieces of the 20th century!\n\nWithout considering technology, what are the main differences between the design from the past and the current one?\n\nOver the past fifty years, graphic design has acquired professional awareness, moving away from the original painterly positions. Now graphic design is becoming visual communication. The term âgraphicâ does not make sense anymore, it does no longer correspond to our time and current technologies. From two-dimensional it has become four-dimensional. Complexities have increased, but the basic discipline remains valid.\n\nScreen or printed paper?\n\nBoth: printed paper less and less, screen more and more. It is more versatile, it provides better colors, and it doesnât take space.\n\nHand drawing or computer?\n\nThey are both useful: the first one to capture a concept, the second one to refine it.\n\nDesign, art, craft.\n\nDesign is not art. Design is utilitarian, art is useful but not utilitarian. Craftmanship is manual by nature, design is industrial by nature.\n\nWhat would you recommend to a young designer?\n\nDeepen your knowledge of the history of design and learn the work of all the protagonists. Learn the theories that determined the development of design. Develop a critical attitude and refine it continuously. Sieve and continuously assess everything surrounding us. Acquire a professional identity and enforce it. Meet the needs of the clients and not their desires, but if necessary evaluate them. Always remember that from a bad client you get a worse client, and from a good client you get a better one. Remember that the word aesthetics contains the word ethics: without this one the first one no longer exists!\n\nA definition of good design.\n\nA good design is a responsible design, expressing an intellectual elegance rather than its contrary: vulgarity.\n\nA description of the Vignellisâs design.\n\nFrom the very start sixty years ago, our design has been a constant struggle against the vulgar, the ephemeral, and the irresponsible rather than a quest for novelty. Based upon universal principles of rationalityâexpressed by the development of the Modern Movement in the 20th centuryâour design believes in discipline but not in dogma, it is not static but dynamic, versatile and coherent even within its own language.\n\nWhat was your favourite game when you were a child?\n\nThe Meccano, and making imaginative scenographies.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you too.\n\nÂ© 2013-19 Massimo Vignelli, Nicola-Matteo Munari. All rights reserved.\n\nTO THE TOP â\n\nPortfolio\n\nBiblioteca Sansoni\n\nBook Series, 20Ã12.5 cm each\n\n1963\n\nOne of many book series that Vignelli designed for Sansoni, Florence. âWe turned the titles sideways to introduce large-sized type and reach greater impact at point of sale.â A simple but incredibly strong and elegant solution, that was highly innovative for the publishing industry of that time. Although based on a schematic layout, the different lenght of the words generate a different cover each time. Beautiful and timeless.\n\nPneumatici Pirelli\n\nPoster, 68Ã48 cm\n\n1963\n\nOne of the greatest masterpieces of the Italian graphic design. A completely pink tyre advertisement featuring a young lady that ride a bycicle without hands, communicating a sense of absolute freedom and limitless joy. An image of women empowerment to advertise an object which is tipically associated with male world.\n\nStudio Verde\n\nPoster, c.70Ã50 cm\n\n1963\n\nIssued by the City of Milan for a conference about green urban design, held the Museo della Scienza e della Tenica (Museum of Science & Technology), Milan.\n\n32B\n\nPoster, c.100Ã70\n\n1964\n\nDesigned for the International Biennale of Art in Venice. Vignelli cut the letters from a sheet of paper. Photo by Aldo Ballo.\n\nPiccolo Teatro\n\nPosters, c.99Ã34 cm each\n\n1964\n\nAmong the best pieces of the Italian graphic design. An excellent example of rhythm within order, featuring the âinformation bands which became a characteristic of our design in the years to follow.â The alternance of red and black titles identify the different theaters where the plays took place (Piccolo Teatro and Teatro Lirico).\n\nTredicesima Triennale\n\nPoster, c.100Ã70 cm\n\n1964\n\nThe official poster for the 13th Triennale Exhibition in Milan. Vignelli was in charge for the whole identity of the exhibition. He designed the mark, posters, catalog, leaflet, and signage.\n\nKnoll\n\nLogotype\n\n1966\n\nThe new logotype set in Helvetica was first paired with the mark designed in 1947 by Herbert Matter and later substituted it.\n\nKnoll International\n\nPoster, 82Ã122 cm\n\n1967\n\nOne of the strongest and most beautiful posters in the history of graphic design. Influenced from the colorful overprints that distinguish the graphics of Max Huberâa former flatmate of Vignelliâit features a simpler and more rigorous geometric layout. Wonderful!\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nLogotype\n\n1967\n\nDesigned with Heinz Waibl at Unimark International. Contrary to what people thought for decades, Vignelli didnât designed the stylized eagle that represented the brand. Indeed, he suggested to use the logotype only, set in Helvetica, half red and half blue to symbolize the American flag. I think that the true strenght of this graphic identity was precisely the typographic pureness that portrayed the company with absolute simplicity and clarity.\n\nHeller Designs, Inc.\n\nPackaging Line\n\n1968\n\nAn excellent example of the strenght and clarity of Helvetica.

Bicentenary\n\nBicentennial Flag, 89Ã127 cm\n\n1976\n\nAn example of Vignelliâs talent. He designed an uncommon and surprising solution with a strong visual impact and meaning. He was asked to designed a poster to celebrate the melting pot, but since he didnât believe in this concept âthis poster celebrates not a melting pot, but the lively interaction of the different ethnic groups that make the United States.â He collected all the foreign and national newspapers published in New York City in that moment, and arrange an American flag with parts of each one.\n\nNational Park Service\n\nPublication Program\n\n1977\n\nThe range of publications designed by Vignelli on the Unigrid is one of his best projects because generated a uniform production with strong identity, consistent order, and useful clarity.

I am generally in agreement with so much of what he says and believes, but whether one shares his views or not it is impossible not to admire his integrity, consistency and dedication. In this interview I particularly like what he has to say to students. I know of no one else who has given them this very practical bit of advice: âMeet the needs of the clients and not their desires, but if necessary evaluate them. Always remember that from a bad client you get a worse client, and from a good client you get a better one.â I am not quite sure what he means in this context by âbut if necessary evaluate them.â I think perhaps it is because Massimo thinks in Italian and he has a thought in mind which eludes me. I hope that he reads this and elaborates in the comments a bit on that.â\n\nMassimo Vignelli 2013, Sep 17\n\nâAs designers we are required to give the client what he needs, not what he wants, but we must be open to consider his wishes to determine whether they are objective or subjective.â\n\nTO THE TOP â\n\nFollow on Facebook\n\nPartnerships\n\nArchivio Grafica Italiana is the first digital resource to the Italian graphic design heritage.
