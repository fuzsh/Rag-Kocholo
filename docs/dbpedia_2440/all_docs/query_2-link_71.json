        "text": "Drop-in Express Hours\n\nDo you have a quick question about your résumé, interview skills, graduate school application, etc., but don't have time for a regular appointment? Check out our in-person Drop-In Express Hours, which will be held every Tuesday and Wednesday from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. where trained career services staff will be able to assist you!\n\nRésumé Review\n\nStudents and alumni are encouraged to submit their résumés to resume-review@iup.edu. Your résumé will be reviewed by one of our career consultants, and you will receive feedback in approximately five business days. We do not schedule résumé reviews on weekends, and same-day or requests for reviews less than 24 hours after the request for review has been submitted will not be able to be accommodated.\n\nQuestions regarding cover letters, interview skills, etc. can be sent to career-development@iup.edu.\n\nWhen preparing your résumé, it is important to remember that the purpose of a résumé is to get you an interview. In the 30 seconds that your résumé will be looked over, you must convince a prospective employer that you deserve an interview. Therefore, do not attempt to present an autobiography of yourself. Focus on your accomplishments and the skills that you have acquired and what you have to offer a particular company for the future.\n\nCreating Your Blueprint\n\nTo begin your résumé, make a detailed list of all of your experiences. Segment these experiences into categories such as:\n\nEducation\n\nWork Experience\n\nInternships\n\nVolunteer Work\n\nCollege Activities\n\nProfessional Group Memberships\n\nHonors\n\nAwards\n\nSpecial Training\n\nOptional items for your résumé include:\n\nAdditional Skills (Computer Skills, Languages, etc.)\n\nRelevant Coursework\n\nPublications/Research\n\nJob Objective\n\nFormats\n\nInclude everything that you can think of because your résumé can be revised later during a résumé appointment with a career coach at the Career and Professional Development Center. Once you have compiled a list of experiences into categories, you will need to decide on the format that best exemplifies your accomplishments and your goals. The two formats most often used are the chronological and functional résumé.\n\nChronological Résumés\n\nA chronological résumé focuses on past experiences. It is the most effective format to use when:\n\nstaying in the same field as prior experience\n\njob history shows growth and development\n\nentering a highly traditional field\n\nprevious employers are highly prestigious\n\nIt is the least effective format to use when:\n\nyou have a spotty work history\n\nchanging your career goals or if you have had frequent job changes\n\nSample\n\nFunctional Résumés\n\nA functional résumé focuses on strengths and accomplishments. It is the most effective format to use when:\n\nemphasizing capabilities not recently used in work experiences\n\nchanging careers\n\nyou have a variety of unrelated work experiences\n\nIt is the least effective format to use when:\n\nentering a highly traditional field\n\nperforming limited work functions\n\nemphasizing a management growth pattern\n\nSample\n\nTips\n\nOnce you have gathered and organized your information, there are several things to keep in mind as you begin the actual writing process:\n\nBe consistent.\n\nUse bullets to draw the reader's attention to your verb phrases.\n\nUse phrases to describe your skills instead of sentences.\n\nCondense ideas.\n\nBe specific.\n\nBe neat and organized.\n\nUse quality résumé paper in shades of cream and gray.\n\nUse a laser printer.\n\nBe honest about your information including your GPA.\n\nProofread.\n\nHave someone else proofread your résumé, and edit, edit, edit!\n\nYou should never include in your résumé:\n\nReferences to race, religion, sex, or age\n\nPhotos\n\nReasons for job changes\n\nSelf-serving claims\n\nAbbreviations or jargon\n\nIrrelevant information\n\nIndividual résumé coaching is available by appointment. Please contact the Career and Professional Development Center to make an appointment.\n\nAction Words\n\nThe following \"action\" words can be used as the first word of sentence fragments in your résumé. Always begin your statements with an action word that describes a certain skill or ability you possess. A thesaurus can be a helpful tool in this process.\n\nThe Do's and Don'ts of Résumé Writing\n\nCommon Employer Criticisms of Résumés\n\nMisspellings, bad grammar, and wordiness\n\nToo long, short, or condensed\n\nPoor layout, physical appearance\n\nPoor punctuation\n\nLengthy phrases, sentences, and paragraphs\n\nToo slick, amateurish, and \"gimmicky\"\n\nToo boastful or dishonest\n\nPoorly typed and reproduced\n\nIrrelevant information\n\nCritical categories missing\n\nHard to understand or requires too much interpretation\n\nDoes not convey accomplishments\n\nText does not support objective\n\nUnclear objective\n\nToo much jargon\n\nTips for Scannable Résumés\n\nIn order to cut costs, some employers have begun using computers to read résumés. The development of scanners and Optical Character Recognition software now enables an employer to \"read\" and store thousands of résumés into a candidate database, which can be searched for keywords when a vacancy needs to be filled. As the use of this technology grows, it will change the way in which résumés are prepared. For now, the following tips can be used to make your résumé more \"scanner-friendly\":"
