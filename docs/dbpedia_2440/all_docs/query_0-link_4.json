        "text": "No one could have predicted that COVID -19 would have changed lives the way it has. In February 2021, we were able to welcome a quarter of our students back in the building for traditional school instruction and the remaining students were permitted to return to the building in April 2021.\n\nAlthough all students were offered the opportunity to return to the building beginning in April, less than half of our students actually returned for traditional instruction. Due to the many students that opted to continue with remote learning, our teachers sustained with incorporating innovative strategies to meet the needs of our students.\n\nDue to the dedication and persistence of our staff and students, we continued to meet school-wide performance goals. Our students maintained their focus on academic achievement throughout the school year and continued to earn credits towards graduation. In fact, our unofficial graduation rate for the Class of 2021 is 89.2%. This will surpass the district’s graduation rate for the last two consecutive years. Last year we surpassed the New York State graduation rate, and we look forward to topping this rate for consecutive years as well.\n\nOur students continue to fulfill our expectations and our motto, “Demand More, Expect More and Achieve More!”\n\nAs we continued to work towards some level of normalcy, we were able to conduct two graduation ceremonies in the auditorium, obeying capacity regulations. In addition, each student was able to invite two guests to attend the ceremonies. I began my Principal’s address with, “What a day; What a year; What an accomplishment”. I believe that these were fitting words for all that our students have experienced over their four years of high school.\n\nAs we continue to build our school, we will be adding two additional Advanced Placement (AP) course offerings in September. These offerings will increase our AP courses to eight. We now will have:\n\nAP Language\n\nAP World History\n\nAP United States History\n\nAP Government and Politics • AP Biology\n\nAP Computer Science\n\nAP Environmental Science\n\nAP Literature\n\nOur school continues to grow and forge an identity. It is hard to believe that three short years ago, we did not offer any Advanced Placement courses. Providing our students the opportunity to take these challenging courses will allow our students to be enrolled in college-level courses and earn college credits while in high school.\n\nWe will be welcoming nearly 120 incoming Freshmen to our school as we continue to increase student enrollment and our school becomes a destination for students throughout the City of Buffalo. Our student enrollment will be nearly 400 as we resume our pursuit of having 700 students enrolled.\n\nWe are excited to share that 48 of the nearly 120 incoming Freshman will be enrolled in our P-TECH program. I have been communicating for three years that we have been working on this program and we are finally ready to implement this tremendous opportunity to our students! The P-TECH program integrates high school and college coursework, enabling students to begin college courses while in high school. Students also participate in a range of workplace opportunities that include mentor- ing, site visits and paid internships, which are designed to support students’ academic and professional growth.\n\nOn behalf of our faculty, staff, and students, I would like to thank the Bennett Alumni Association for their continued support!\n\nOptima Futura!
