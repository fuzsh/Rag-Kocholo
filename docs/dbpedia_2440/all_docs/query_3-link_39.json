        "text": "Marsha Rowe, editor of the groundbreaking feminist magazine Spare Rib, famously recalled: “Suddenly, words were possible.” She was referring to a general climate of liberation in the early 1970s, when the creation of women-run print media allowed women to express themselves freely. This is also how women in Greece must have felt when the second-wave feminist movement erupted after a painful seven-year military dictatorship (1967–1974). But Greek women’s liberation and involvement in writing and publishing didn’t start then; in fact, women were present in publishing in Greece long before that.\n\nOne prominent example is Εφημερίς των Κυριών (Efimerís ton Kirión – “Ladies’ Gazette”), which covered the evolution of women’s liberation and employed solely women writers as early as the 1880s. These developments, however, were probably not recorded in any historical account in the 1970s, when a general process of democratization gave momentum to the feminist movement, expressed by a growing number of feminist periodicals. In many cases, these were politically affiliated magazines funded by large political parties. But because of the popularization of the means of typographic production – with the introduction of dry transfer lettering, phototypesetting, and offset printing – several independent, mostly anarchist publications also sprang up. Πόλη Γυναικών – ανοιχτό περιοδικό θεωρητικών και πρακτικών προβλημάτων χειραφέτησης (Póli Gynaikón, “City of Women” – an open magazine for theoretical and practical emancipation issues) was one of them.\n\nPoli Ginaikon first appeared in January 1982. It was initiated by Ntina Malliakou, who had taken an interest in feminist issues somewhat earlier, as her contributions to Leonidas Christakis’ Ιδεοδρόμιο (Ideodromio) in 1981 indicate. Christakis, a well-known artist deeply interested in graphic design, also designed Poli Ginaikon. He sought the professionalization of the field of graphic design in Greece and served as the editor of various independent publications from the 1950s on. For Poli Ginaikon, he is specifically credited with doing the editing, the “cache” (layout), the “page montage,” and the “page creation.” In later issues, the name of Niki Konidi, who according to the masthead was a member of the editorial team, appears next to Christakis’ for the “page montage” credit. The printing and binding was done in various print shops in Athens, also meticulously recorded in the credits.\n\nThe fact that Christakis – a professional in the field who was not formally part of the editorial team – undertook the design of the magazine constitutes rather an exception to the way radical political periodicals were then produced. Many other publications followed a more pronounced DIY approach. For example, the lesbian-feminist Amazon Quarterly was typed and laid out with machinery purchased and operated by the editorial team. The design, however, was a difficult and multilevel operation, as the editor of Amazon Quarterly attests. It would have been much easier to entrust it to a veteran editor and experienced publication designer.\n\nThe topics covered in Poli Ginaikon were highly diverse, running the gamut from examining the representation and position of women in media, Greek folk art, and scientific theories to analyses of the traditional roles and activities of women (as mothers and housewives, for example, and their reproductive labor in the household). The magazine also reported on news about feminist art, and published poetry and interviews. What united all articles was their ideological compass: a far-left anti-authoritarian stance and a framing of topics with a deep knowledge of sociological and political theories. The articles also demonstrate that the magazine came about at a time when feminist organizations had matured; topics like feminist self-awareness groups were viewed critically as early as the first issue.\n\nIn terms of the imagery and typography, two core aspects of its design, Poli Ginaikon seems like a labor of love. The issues hint at extensive research for appropriate iconography and typographic experimentation with many different headline typefaces.\n\nGenerally speaking, graphic designers, sign makers, and indeed anyone who worked in visual communication in Greece in those days had to perform incredible feats of ingenuity to enhance their designs with display typefaces. The vast majority of such typefaces were produced abroad and did not offer Greek characters. Greek type designer, educator, and artist Takis Katsoulidis recalls that to widen the palette, graphic designers had to step into the role of type designer, repurposing Latin letterforms, modifying them to make them resemble Greek ones, or even creating new glyphs in the spirit of the desired typeface. The process of creating official Greek script extensions by established non-Greek type designers was much the same, as illustrated by sketches for the Greek extensions of Eric Gill’s Perpetua or Jan van Krimpen’s Romulus. Treating an alphabet this way – as derivative of the Latin script – has been criticized as impractical for the intended audience (mostly native users of the script), as not very creative, and as disrespectful of the specific cultural context the script belongs to. Despite the fact that the practice of deriving Greek letterforms from Latin ones is formally similar in the cases of both Gill and Van Krimpen on one hand and Greek type users on the other, the power dynamics at play and the occasions are in fact very different. Designers in Greece were responding to a need – the lack of typefaces – and had insight into the formal possibilities and limits of their native script. They were therefore capable of creating readable, usable letterforms even in a makeshift, one-off way, in order to express their individuality and creativity.\n\nFor Poli Ginaikon, the majority of the titles and headlines seem to have been done with Latin-script typefaces produced for dry transfer lettering. The logo is based on Candice, a bold script issued by Letraset in 1976. While most of the Greek letters are repurposed Latin glyphs, some had to be customized. The Greek capital Π (Pi), for example, apparently is a combination of a swashy stem as found in the Latin capital T, merged with the left part of V and rotated 180 degrees. Other typefaces used include Pluto, Blanchard, and Futura Black, all likewise available from Letraset. These elaborate typographic choices, especially in the context of radical presses, have been perceived as breaking away from the minimalistic orthodoxy of the International Typographic Style. When designing for graphic design magazines, Christakis himself used sans serif typefaces, in a departure from his work for Póli Ginaikón. This suggests that he understood the publication’s specific requirements and was familiar with DIY publications abroad. The body copy in Poli Ginaikon, just as in other instances of radical magazines like the The Black Panther and Amazon Quarterly, was produced on a typewriter, using various monospaced styles. The specific typewriter styles have not yet been identified.\n\nFor the covers and also the interior illustrations in Poli Ginaikon, images by foreign feminist groups (from Denmark, for example) were included, as well as artwork by feminist artists like Judy Chicago, forging a link between the Greek women’s liberation movement and efforts abroad. One can also find sketches and engravings by local artists that visually explored relevant issues, maintaining a link to the local art scene, of which Christakis was an active member. Last but not least, images found in alternative magazines from the 1930s on (Charlie mensuel, Bizzare, and others) were included, not only demonstrating an interest in periodicals as a genre, but also presenting ways in which similarly gendered themes have appeared in media throughout history.\n\nWith its vertical structure dominated by narrow columns, Poli Ginaikon’s layout reflected the serious tone of the magazine, faithful to the reconstruction and dissemination of knowledge – but it also made a playful jab at puritanism with its imagery and typography. It initially measured 28 × 14 cm; after the fifth issue, though, the size was reduced – a change readers seemed particularly fond of.\n\nPoli Ginaikon ceased publication in February 1985, having produced sixteen issues. The theme of the final issue was the precarity faced by women living in cities, thus coming full circle to the topic that gave the magazine its name. Its contribution to the reevaluation of the narratives and dismantling of myths that have cemented the traditional gender roles of women, and especially the gender roles of women in Greece, is undeniable."
