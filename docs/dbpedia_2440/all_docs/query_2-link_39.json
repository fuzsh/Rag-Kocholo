        "text": "Need this translated please. And thank you all who are doing this. It has been much help to me. Also, if any of you live in Michigan and know of a place such as a school to learn latin, please let me know. I've been trying to find a class. Thank you.\n\nI can't help much with the translation, but I can help with your question.\n\nThere are plenty of free resources available, such as the following:\n\nThis forum. Stick around!\n\nLatinum - A free podcast focused on spoken Latin. We know a lot more about how Latin sounded than one would think.\n\nAdler's Grammar - A free, downloadable Latin textbook. This is a must!\n\nKey to Adler's Grammar - The answer key to the exercises in the above book.\n\nNoDictionaries - Once you get the basics down, this makes reading Latin much easier.\n\nLatin Word Study Tool - I have found this tool invaluable in my studies. It won't be much help as you start off, but you'll soon be glad you ever heard of it.\n\nWhitaker's WORDS - I've never used it, but I have heard a lot about it.\n\nWiktionary - Wiktionary often defines Latin words. A word of caution, though - I've been led astray by Wiktionary on a few occasions, and I only recommend it as a last resort for definitions. For conjugation (the changing of verb endings, you'll get to that before long), it isn't too bad a resource.\n\nThank you everybody! I will try your suggestions. And I have already tried the Latinum podcast, its nice, but after the first one, it gets a little confusing. So if there are any beginners out there like me, I would suggest a textbook first. lol\n\nI think the meaning may be carried well by the following, even though it is less literal:\n\nOptimas res nondum vidimus.\n\n= We have not yet seen the best (of times).\n\nOr, more literally:\n\nOptimae res nos adhuc exspectant.\n\n= The best things still await us.\n\nThe neuter optima could refer to the best concrete things. Res is more general, situational, attitudinal, existential as in the original saying's meaning (as I understand it)."
