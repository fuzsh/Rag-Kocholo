        "text": "Whether you’ve decided to hire a graphic designer or you’re going to do it in-house, determining certain characteristics of your sign beforehand can help your signage to remain on brand and ensure its effectiveness. In this article, we’re going to look at which fonts you should consider when it comes to designing your new sign.\n\nHelvetica\n\nHelvetica is a great sans-serif font that is simple and easy to read. Unfortunately, its popularity often means that this font is heavily overused. Despite its overuse, Helvetica is still a great staple font to fall back on if all else fails but be sure to determine whether it really conveys your message.\n\nTrajan\n\nThis serif font is very bold and simple. Best known for its use in movie posters, this font is often associated with religion, marriage, law and history. For a bold statement, it’s an excellent choice.\n\nGaramond\n\nGaramond is actually a group of fonts that date back to a 16th century Parisian engraver named Claude Garamond. These types of fonts are very popular for their easy to read typeface, particularly when it comes to body text and books and so would make a perfect choice for the smaller print on your signage.\n\nBodoni\n\nThe contrast between thick and thin strokes in Bodoni makes it a perfect font for signage and conveys a certain message. The serif style of this typeface is also popular and provides a very professional looking image.\n\nMonotype Curvosa\n\nThis list wouldn’t be complete without a script font. The problem with using script fonts in signage is that some can be very hard to read, however, Monotype Corsiva is the perfect script font that is clear and legible.\n\nFutura\n\nA very geometrically shaped typeface, Futura is often used when small text is required as it is clear and easy to read. It’s become increasingly popular with large displays which creates a divide between people; whilst many will choose to use the font, others do hate it.\n\nClarendon\n\nIf you’re looking for something bold and chunky then Clarendon is ideal. Especially when it comes to choosing which fonts suits your purpose as Clarendon has a lot more weight to it than other fonts.\n\nOptima\n\nOptima is appealing for its simplicity. A lighter version of Bodoni, there is just a hint of serif on this font which gives it that little bit of added flair.\n\nFranklin Gothic\n\nFranklin Gothic is a great font that has a lot of power. It’s simplistic and bold and easily able to convey its message. The width of each character (stretch) is particularly narrow compared to other fonts such as Helvetica or Futura and so some view it as being rather squashed.\n\nMyriad\n\nAnd finally, Myriad is a great sans-serif font that is simplistic and made with great design. You can see the gentle sloping of the Y is very appealing and would look great on any sign.\n\nWhen it comes to determining which font to use, it’s important to take into consideration your current branding and the readability of the font. By understanding what makes a great font for signage, you’ll be sure to create the ideal design.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you may also like…\n\nEverything You Need to Know about Pavement Signs\n\nShop here:"
