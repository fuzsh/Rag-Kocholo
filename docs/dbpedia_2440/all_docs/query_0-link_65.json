Although each discipline speaks in its own unique language, each has historically attempted a dialogue with the other. Architecture speaks of form, space, and purpose, celebrating human continuity and offering experiences that both function and inspire. Graphic design—typography, image, and symbol—communicates the subtleties of time and place and tells cultural and visual stories, clarifying a building’s purpose and echoing its architectural message. Mankind has been telling its collective stories and histories by marking cave walls and inscribing buildings for millennia. Animal drawings at Lascaux, cuneiform writings in Mesopotamia, Chinese calligraphy, and Egyptian hieroglyphs all demonstrate how early mankind expressed themselves by drawing and writing on the places of significance in their lives. These early forms of visual communications or graphic design conveyed beauty, integrity, and above all—permanence. Our need to dedicate and consecrate places is clearly the beginning of the integration of graphic design in the built environment. Classical inscriptions, figurative murals, and ornamental surfaces have long been a part of architecture and have influenced our understanding of typographic form and graphic style and their visual representation in the built environment. Buildings and public spaces coexist with billboards and signs, patterned and textured facades, and informational and wayfinding signs to effect an overall experience with the public. Graphic design has become integrated with the built environment in shaping not only cities but also the lives of their inhabitants. At the intersection of the history of art and architecture, long before the design discipline was defined by its current name, envi-\n\nINTRODUCTION, CONTINUED\n\nronmental graphic design, seminal examples of twentieth-century graphic design arose in our built environment from the cultural, social, and economic climate of their time. Environmental graphic design is a vital part of our visual heritage, appreciated for its practical uses and enjoyed for its decorative appearances. Urban streetscapes, office buildings, museums, convention centers, airports, public parks, shopping malls, and entertainment centers all have been transformed by the use of environmental graphic design. This design discipline has evolved not only by its technical improvements but also by its integral relationship over time to art, architecture, and cultural movements. For example, the meetinghouse signs and identification markers of American Shaker communities; Russian constructivist wall murals lining the streets of Moscow during the Bolshevik Revolution; the great white ways of Times Square, Piccadilly Circus, and the Las Vegas Strip; the festive and celebratory graphics of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics; the provocative typographic walls of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.; and corporate identity and branding of the American marketplace after World War II all responded directly to the social constructs, political upheavals, and economic needs of the times. Additionally, prevailing artistic movements directly influenced and inspired other groundbreaking design benchmarks such as Hector Guimard’s art nouveau entrances to the Paris metro, Otto Wagner’s decorative building facades in Vienna, Edward Johnston's typography for the London Underground, Peter Behrens' integration of graphic and architectural form for Allegemein Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG), supergraphics by Barbara Stauffacher Solomon for Sea Ranch, and Robert Venturi's transformation of the ordinary into the extraordinary by applying decorative imagery to conventional buildings. Innovators 10\n\n11\n\nand visionaries such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Georges Claude, Walter Dorwin Teague, Charles Eames, Margaret Calvert, Donald Leigh, Alvin Lustig, Walt Disney, Paul Rand, Alexander Girard, Dan Reisinger, Deborah Sussman, and Thomas Geismar have all transformed our built environment with innovative and revolutionary graphic design solutions during the course of the twentieth century. Since environmental graphic design has only recently been recognized as a key discipline within the design professions, little if any documentation of importance, substance, or critical evaluation exists that deals with the history of typography, image, symbol, and visual storytelling in the context of our modern man-made world. The built environment that we experience in our everyday lives continually relies upon graphic design to communicate information and identity, shape our overall perception and memory of a sense of place, and ultimately enliven, enrich, and humanize our lives. Graphic Design and Architecture: A 20th-Century History is the first historical overview of twentieth-century graphic design in the built environment. It provides the reader with an invaluable and comprehensive reference of visual and narrative material that illustrates and evaluates this unique and important history. This volume examines the relationship between typography, image, symbol, and visual storytelling in the modern world by exploring principal themes, major technical developments, important manufacturers, and pioneering designers over the last one hundred years. Unlike many recently published titles that focus primarily on isolated contemporary projects, Graphic Design and Architecture places the unique marriage of graphic design and architecture in the context of artistic, social, and cultural movements and influences of the twentieth century. This writer hopes that the reader, in looking back, can derive inspiration and insight into looking forward.\n\nFOREWORD\n\nJAMES STEWART POLSHEK, FAIA James Stewart Polshek, FAIA—designer, public advocate, and educator—is in the fifth decade of his architectural career. In all three of these areas, he has provided an inspirational template for generations of architects. In 1962, he founded James Stewart Polshek, Architects, which ultimately became Polshek Partnership Architects. The legacy firm, Ennead Architects, is recognized internationally. Mr. Polshek’s reputation was initially established in 1963–1964 by his design of two research laboratory complexes in Japan. Over the past fifty years, he and his firm have completed many significant projects, including Santa Fe Opera, Santa Fe, New Mexico; The New York Times Printing Plant, New York City; the restoration and expansion of Carnegie Hall, New York; Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History, New York; and the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas. Mr. Polshek has received numerous awards for excellence, and he’s received honorary degrees from Pratt Institute, the New School University Parsons School of Design, and New Jersey Institute of Technology. Since 2006, Mr. Polshek has been a member of the New York City Public Design Commission, appointed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He continues to serve as design counsel to Ennead Architects.\n\nNewseum Building Facade (detail), 2008 Washington, D.C., USA Poulin + Morris Inc.

They do this by signifying an event, expressing the mission of an institution, and conveying the nature of a process. Fully achieving any of these intentions requires a synthesis of graphic design and architecture. Richard Poulin has, in his professional work and teaching, dramatically demonstrated how architecture can be enriched by symbols and typography. This book contains many examples—some as exaggerated as Venturi Scott Brown’s Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia, others as subtle as Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Graphic Design and Architecture: A 20th-Century History will be mandatory reading for every graphic designer and architect, as well as all those that aspire to these two professions, and most importantly for all who are concerned with the humanizing possibilities inherent in the visual arts. This beautiful book deals with language, meaning, and their indivisibility with two- and three-dimensional design. It is enriched by a brief, but intense, history of the twentieth century (including a cameo appearance of the prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux)—a virtual Jules Verne design voyage around the world! Richard Poulin’s sketches of each of the dozens of graphic designers and architects who populate this history are unfailingly generous. His selections are also stylistically catholic and cosmopolitan—as different as Hector Guimard and his timeless Paris metro stations and Barbara Stauffacher Solomon’s innovative work with Charles Moore at Sea Ranch on the California coast—art nouveau at the end of the nineteenth century to supergraphics in the turbulent sixties. Also included are historic international events such as Robert Moses’s 1964 New York World’s Fair and the tragic Munich Olympics; monumental urban objects from the Eiffel Tower to Luis Barragán’s colorful totems in Mexico City, legendary artists\n\nThe New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center Stairwell Mural (detail), 2003 New York, New York, USA Poulin + Morris Inc.

I came to first know Richard when we worked together on an addition to the Columbia University Law School in 1993. Our first meeting was memorable. He presented his preferred typographic font for the project in a way that can only be compared to a proud father holding up a day-old infant in front of his friends. He lovingly caressed every curve, solid, and void and comprehensively described his rationale for the fonts’ appropriateness. Since then, we have collaborated on over 200 projects, all nonprofit institutions that include the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, WGBH’s headquarters in Boston, and Zankel Hall within Carnegie Hall in New York City. Richard and his partner, Douglas Morris, created, for each, singular graphic expressions that reinforce their identities and aspirations. Richard Poulin’s lifelong teaching career and professional practice provided him with the tools required to undertake the encyclopedic challenge he set for himself. But this never could have been completed so brilliantly without his intellectual curiosity and extraordinary visual judgment. James Stewart Polshek\n\n14\n\n15\n\nFOREWORD\n\nDEBORAH SUSSMAN, HAIA, FSEGD Deborah Sussman is recognized as a pioneer of environmental graphic design for creating arresting visual imagery and designing its highly imaginative applications for architectural and public spaces. Deborah’s passion for the marriage of graphics and the built environment, fueled by her early career at the Eames Office, has led to extensive collaborations with planners, architects, other designers, and clients. Her work, informed by perceptive observation and rigorous documentation of communities and cultures, has found its place in projects for cities, arts and entertainment venues, commercial developments, and the private sector around the world. She began to work with architects in the late 1960s and 1970s, then incorporated as Sussman/Prejza & Co. with husband Paul Prejza. Deborah has led the firm in designing an array of notable projects: the “look” of the 1984 Olympics, which received Time magazine’s award for “Best of the Decade”; the identity and branding applications for the Gas Company of Southern California; the identity, product exhibits, and corporate interiors for Hasbro Inc.; and award-winning wayfinding systems for Walt Disney Resorts and the cities of Philadelphia and Santa Monica. More recent projects include comprehensive interiors for the Seattle Opera, McCaw Hall, and exhibit design for the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco.\n\nCincinnati Civic Center Interior (detail), 2008 Cincinnati, Ohio, USA Sussman/Prejza & Co. (est. 1968), Designers Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nThis book is a gift to all current and future practitioners of, users of, and participants in, environmental graphic design. It demonstrates how this particular field of endeavor has deep roots. It explores and uncovers a history that was not examined or compiled until Richard Poulin delved into it. It organizes and points out major global contributions that have not been linked before. It is a massive collection of material, of benefit and illumination to everyone in the design disciplines. It has stimulated my memory and inspires me to continue. When did I discover the power of words and symbols in the built environment we live in? Perhaps it was as a child, traveling the subway from my Brooklyn home to the great hub of Manhattan. Coming up for air as the train approached the bridge, the Squibb toothpaste tower sign convinced me that all was well. However, it was another sign that really made me think—and worry. Close-by there was a large-scale message in red—probably handpainted: “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and Thou shalt be Saved.” But we were Jewish. I did want to be saved but couldn’t accept the risk. Yet those words called out to me every time I looked through the window. Finally, I decided that, as long as I read that message every time it appeared, life would be okay. Those two icons demonstrate the lasting power of communication when messages and symbols participate in the urban fabric of the built environment. The famous “trylon and perisphere” of the 1939 New York World’s Fair became another lasting icon for me. In this case, it was the form and its whiteness, its newness, its bigness, and its simplicity that lives in memory. It wasn’t architecture; it wasn’t really sculpture, and certainly not graphic design. So what was it? It did not fit into a category neatly. Could it have been “environmental graphic design”?\n\nWalt Disney World Exterior Sign Program (detail), 1989 Orlando, Florida, USA Sussman/Prejza & Co. (est. 1968), Designers Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nThat term, and even that profession as a discipline, did not exist until decades later. It was mainly in the 1960s that people began to practice EGD as a specialized, focused discipline. But it still really had no name. During those early years—and even into the 1980s— there were not so many of us. We were hard to label—not exactly graphic designers, not architects, not interior designers, and so on. Besides, it was (and in some ways still is) difficult to input into a powerful, established “modern” architecture that resisted change. But our numbers increased. A design discipline was born; schools began to support the discipline. Also, as this book reveals, women emerged and continue to be leaders in this field—an interesting phenomenon, especially since women have long been considered minor players in the field of architecture. During the 1960s, the work of Barbara Stauffacher exploded on the buildings at Sea Ranch. In Los Angeles, Corita Kent took graphics off the page and into the street. Suddenly, words were floating in three dimensions—independent of, yet deliberately cognizant of, architecture. These pioneers were challenging the polite obeisance to rules that traditional graphic design was supposed to obey: to “fit” comfortably and “politely” into classically designated spaces. As the line between disciplines has finally become blurry, so too has the line between sacred and profane. Just as I cannot forget my childhood memory of messages viewed from the window of a train going from Brooklyn to Manhattan and the emergence from dark to light, and then the mighty bridge—I cannot separate graphics from architecture, urban design, landscape, lighting, paving, utilities, performance, sound, and ultimately, the experiences of the people who use and need all of it.

In the prehistoric era (30,000 BCE–5000 BCE), rock paintings or pictographs were mankind’s first elemental drawings representing a concept, object, activity, place, or event and inevitably evolved into different forms of graphic communication systems, as well as visual symbols for the written and spoken word. With the development of the world’s earliest system of writing—cuneiform (from the Latin cuneus, meaning \"wedge\")—by the Sumerians in 3100 BCE, mankind began to communicate over long distances and record information for posterity. This innovative and radical new system of visual communication was based on abstract wedge-shaped signs made on clay tablets with a blunt reed or stylus, as opposed to naïve line drawings. From this point forward, writing systems evolved in different cultures throughout the civilized world. In Western Europe, monuments and manmade structures communicated stories and symbolized rituals through their forms, compositions, and locations. The most distinctive archaeological remains from this period (3000–1000 BCE) were stone-built burial chambers that incorporated megaliths (large stones, from the Greek megas, “big,” and lithos, “stone”), some engraved with decorative patterns. For more than 1,500 years, capital square letters or capitalis monumentalis were the ideal Roman letterforms used primarily in inscriptions throughout the vast Roman Empire. Based on the pure geometric shapes of the square, triangle, and circle, these monu-\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES, CONTINUED\n\nmental inscriptions celebrated the achievements and victories of Roman leaders. With Roman triumphal arches, the written narrative was an integral part of the architecture and its letterforms had the same architectural integrity as any other architectural detail. The composition of the arch was a cohesive whole that provided focus to the narrative, as well as a functional and memorable threshold for ceremony. The Middle or Medieval Ages (500–1300) began with the fall of the Roman Empire in 476, marking the end of the ancient world and the beginning of a modern one. During this time period, town seals, monograms, emblems, and coats of arms among the chivalry appeared throughout the built environment and were used as marks of identification, as well as protective shields in battle. In 1188, the monarchs of England, France, and Flanders (present-day Belgium and the Netherlands) unilaterally agreed to represent their military forces with specific graphic symbols and colors. Medieval city dwellers formed guilds to regulate not only economic activities, but political and military affairs as well. Distinctive banners and flags were used by these guilds to identify their industries, such as blacksmiths, wine merchants, and tavern owners. Tradesmen, publicans, apothecaries, and merchants used signboards displayed outside their establishments to promote their offerings and wares. The Renaissance (1300–1600), meaning “to be reborn,” grew out of the Italian Middle Ages and marked the reevaluation and renewed understanding of classical European literature, music, science, art, and architecture that ultimately sparked a cultural revolution throughout Western Europe for the next 200 years. With the invention of printing and moveable type by Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1398–1468) in 1450, new and innovative ideas spread rapidly 24\n\n25\n\n(1377–1446). The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were an era of monarchs, divine right, and absolute rule with the undercurrents of unrest and inevitable revolt. Western Europe turned toward exploration, expansion, and colonization of new worlds. By the 1700s, the printing press had become commonplace throughout Europe and America. In the 1800s, posters and broadsides were primary advertising vehicles, appearing on building walls and signboards throughout Europe and the United States. New developments in typography and printing processes ultimately influenced graphic design in the built environment during this era. The Industrial Revolution transformed the economy of the civilized world during the late 1700s and early 1800s from one based on agriculture in rural communities to one based on manufacturing in urban centers. This transformation began in Great Britain and spread throughout Europe and the Americas due to new inventions and technologies. Machine tools, steam engines, and measuring instruments facilitated and enhanced the growth of industries, transportation systems, and new forms of building construction that started to appear throughout the modern world. Each of these influences left an indelible graphic signature on the built environments of the past. Historical developments in typography, materials, surface treatments, and architectural context have been an essential and invaluable series of references for the evolution of graphic design in the modern man-made world.\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES I\n\nthroughout Italy and then the rest of the European continent by the foremost minds of the time—Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), Leon Battista Alberti (1404– 1472), Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445–1510), and Filippo Brunelleschi\n\nPETROGRAMS AND PETROGLYPHS c. 13000 BCE CAVE PAINTING Cougnac, France\n\nThe realistic representations of hand stencils, drawings, and polychrome paintings of animals, human beings, and crude objects found on the walls of subterranean caves such as the ones in Lascaux and Niaux in southern France are considered to be the first and oldest known examples of graphic symbols created by mankind. These primitive images also communicated and commemorated the social and economic occurrences of the people who created them. Crude pigments were created from charcoal and red and yellow oxides, mixed with fat, to create a medium that was then possibly\n\nsmear-ed onto the walls of these caves with fingers or brushes made of bristles, reeds, or animal hair. Most historians agree that these actions do not mark the beginning of art, but they do signify the dawn of visual communications and one of mankind’s first examples of graphic design in the built environment. Petrograms (painted) or petroglyphs (engraved) were found in most parts of the world, from Europe to Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and the Polynesian Islands.\n\nEurope during the third millennium BCE. In many ways, these monumental structures were as impressive as their cultural and geographic\n\ncounterparts—the colossal pyramids and temples in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Central America, and South America.\n\nSTONEHENGE c. 1500 BCE STONEHENGE Wiltshire, United Kingdom\n\nStonehenge, a megalithic monument structure composed of 30-foot- (9.1 m) tall stones, was the ceremonial site of Celtic sun worship located in Wiltshire, United Kingdom, erected around 1500 BCE. Henge monuments were enclosures that functioned as local ritual centers surrounded by an earth berm and a ditch. Huge, monolithic stones were carefully placed to create a circular enclosed form and interior space that was either open to the heavens above or enclosed by a wooden or thatched roof. Ritual stone circles and rows were prevalent throughout England and northwestern 26\n\n27\n\nc. 2500 BCE EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES\n\nHIEROGLYPHICS\n\nI\n\nAbydos, Upper Egypt\n\nBeginning in approximately 2500 BCE, the walls, surfaces, and passages of Egyptian pyramids were covered with hieroglyphic (in Greek, “sacred carving”) writings of myths, hymns, and prayers supporting the Pharaoh’s life in the afterworld. Hieroglyphics, a picture-writing system used in ancient Egyptian culture, consisted of three types of glyphs—phonetic or singleconsonant characters that functioned similar to an alphabet; logographic; and ideographic. Hieroglyphics was a remarkably efficient writing system used by the Egyptians for over three and a half centuries that contained seven hundred hieroglyphs, with over one hundred that were strictly pictographic. This expansive graphic language was used for decorative and inscriptional purposes everywhere in the Egyptian built environment. It was chiseled into stone or cut into wood as bas-relief or incised relief images, covering the exteriors and interiors of monumental stone temples and tombs and used on furniture, coffins, and clothing. Most hieroglyphics were organized vertically in a columnar composition, read from top to bottom and right to left. Their graphic characteristics were stylized, symbolic, and implicit—men had darker skin color than women; important people were shown in larger scale than less important ones; and the human body was always represented as a two-dimensional frontal figure or form with arms, legs, and head in profile.\n\nTHE GREEK IONIC ALPHABET 403 BCE AN ICONIC VERSION OF THE GREEK ALPHABET USED BY THE ATHENIANS Wiltshire, United Kingdom designer/location unknown\n\nThe great civilizations of Greece, Etruria, and Rome represented the beginning of the Western European world. The Greeks adapted the Phoenician alphabet and modified it into a system of twenty-five characters. The Greek Ionic alphabet included five vowels (A, E, I, O, U), and written language read from left to right; however, there were still no visual separations between words and sentences, nor was there any punctuation. The Greek Ionic alphabet was the sole source of all modern European scripts and 28\n\n29\n\nis considered the world’s first true alphabet. Concurrent with this graphic development, Greek architecture started to be built in either the Doric or Ionic style, named after the Greek dialects. A third style, Corinthian, came into use at the end of the century. Each of these distinctive styles can be best described by their architectural columns that symbolize and characterize their stylistic conventions. The Doric column has an undecorated rounded capital with a tapered column of carefully joined stone drums carved with decorative fluting. The Ionic column is also fluted like its Doric counterpart, yet taller and slender, and its capital characterized by scroll-like appendages. The Corinthian column is capped with a ornamental capital shaped like an upturned bell decorated with carved acanthus leaves and became the leading architectural style of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Parthenon, temple of the goddess Athena, is one of the greatest remaining examples of classical Greek Doric architecture. Located on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, and completed in 447 BCE, the Parthenon was built in stone with continuous columns, within which stood a sanctuary containing a statue of Athena. The carved decorations located in the principal friezes and triangular pediment of the temple communicated themes of special significance for honoring the gods. The inscriptions at the temple of Athena were the inspiration for the twentieth-century glyphic sans-serif typeface Lithos (Carol Twombly, b. 1959) designed in 1989.\n\n81 ARCH OF TITUS\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES\n\nROMAN MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS\n\ndesigner unknown\n\nOne of the most important developments of this time period was Roman inscriptional lettering known as capitalis monumentalis. These classic letterforms, based on early Etruscan and Greek alphabets and the basis for modern capital letterforms, were refined by the Romans so that they would retain their visual characteristics when engraved or cut in stone. Serifs originated with the carving of inscriptions into stone by Roman masons who added small hooks to the tips of letters to prevent their chisel from slipping. These carved inscriptions would then be infilled with cast bronze letters attached with “tangs” or wooden pegs. Roman lettering appeared on buildings and public spaces in each and every town and added to the visual branding of the Roman Empire. Monumental inscriptions on the Roman Forum’s three triumphal arches—Titus (81; at right), Septimius Severus (203), and Constantine (315), and at the base of the Trajan Column (113; see page 30), illustrate the critical visual relationships that occurred between letterform, material, surface, and composition in the Roman built environment. The Arch of Titus, completed in 81, was erected by Domitian (81–96) to commemorate Vespasian’s victory over the Egyptians and Titus’s capture of Jerusalem 230 years earlier. The arch’s composition has a single portal opening flanked on each side by bas-relief columns with early examples of Corinthian capitals (at right). The soffit and flanking facades of the arch are adorned with figurative reliefs of the emperor and his campaign in Jerusalem. Seriflike monumental capital letterforms, carved into its marble fascia, are composed symmecontinued on page 30\n\nI\n\nRome, Italy\n\nRoman Monumental Inscriptions, continued\n\n113\n\n207\n\nINSCRIPTION FROM BASE OF COLUMN\n\nAN INSCRIPTION OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS\n\nERECTED FOR THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\n\nRome, Italy\n\nRome, Italy\n\ndesigner unknown\n\nApollodorus of Damascus (c. 65–110), Architect Damascus, Syria\n\ntrically within the arch’s attic story and are even-stroked and architecturally proportioned. They are also closely spaced and clearly reflect the simplicity and restrained organization of the arch itself. These commemorative monuments were constructed to celebrate and bear witness to the episodes and victories of Roman emperors and generals. They were architectural and graphic compositions of great detail and provided designers and architects with a design vocabulary that would be relied upon for centuries to come.\n\n30\n\n31\n\nErected in 113, the Trajan Column was designed by Greek sculptor and architect Apollodorus (c. 65–110) of Damascus to commemorate Trajan’s military victories in the Dacian (present-day Romania) wars (98–117). Located in the Roman Forum, this 131-foot (40 m) victory column, which was originally topped with a bronze statue of Trajan, consists of 18 blocks of pristine white Carrara marble, each 4 feet (1.2 m) high and 11.5 feet (3.5 m) in diameter and adorned with a continuous spiraling, bas-relief sculpture depicting the epic wars between the Romans and Dacians and carved\n\ncapitalis monumentalis inscriptions considered to be the finest surviving examples of Roman capital lettering. The twentieth-century old style, all-capital typeface Trajan (Carol Twombly, b. 1959) is based on the letterforms found in these Roman square capital inscriptions. The design of the Trajan Column has inspired numerous commemorative monuments and victory columns throughout ancient and modern history.\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES\n\nTHE PANTHEON 125 THE PANTHEON Rome, Italy I\n\nApollodorus of Damascus (c. 65–110), Architect Damascus, Syria\n\nBuilt by Trajan’s son Hadrian (76–138), one of the greatest architectural patrons of all time, the Pantheon is one of the most celebrated architectural masterpieces of Western civilization. It also has one of the finest examples of early Roman inscriptions ever to be integrated to an architectural structure. The simplicity and perfect proportions of the building’s design is world renowned as an architectural benchmark and engineer-\n\ning achievement due to its huge dome hidden behind the building’s classical portico. The typographic inscriptions on its exterior entablature and portico facade are also impressive examples of early Roman graphic design in the built environment. The letterforms are logically\n\ncentered with comfortable spacing, creating a very legible and well-proportioned bronze typographic inscription that reads: M - AGRIPPA L F COS TERTIUM FECIT (translated: Marcus Agrippa the son of Lucius, three times consul built this).\n\nthe childhood of Jesus Christ adorn the apse and surrounding entablature of the building’s interior. Biblical quotations and prayers are inscribed in archaic Latin lettering, sometimes set against the luminescent gold of the mosaics enveloping the interior. The mosaic techniques used during this time period were made of minute “cards” or quadrangular fragments of a pebble or vitreous (glasslike) paste mixture. The latter offered an almost infinite range of colors, including bright\n\nhues of vermilion, emerald green, and cerulean blue. Transparent glass fragments were covered on their back surfaces with sheets of gold leaf that provided a visual depth to the background on which the figures stand out. The church’s mosaics illustrate the fusion between Eastern and Western art influences during this time period. Their organization and architectural integration are also reminiscent of the sculptural figurative friezes found on earlier monuments of the Roman Empire.\n\nCHURCH OF SANT’ APOLLINARE NUOVO 549 CHURCH OF SANT’ APOLLINARE NUOVO Ravenna, Italy Theodoric the Great (454–526), Architect Pannonia, province of the Roman Empire\n\nRavenna, Italy, was the last capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of Rome in 476 and renowned for some of the world’s most remarkable Byzantine mosaics in the Church of Sant’ Apollinare Nuovo (549). Entire walls and ceilings of the church are covered on an epic scale with minuscule fragments of glass, colored marble, and semiprecious stones cut to fit drawn or painted figurative scenes and set in an oblique manner to catch daylight. Mosaic panels depicting scenes from the Old Testament and\n\nCHARTRES CATHEDRAL 1220\n\nThe great Gothic cathedrals of the medieval era, such as Notre Dame (1350) in Paris, France, and the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres (1220) in Chartres, France, marked the beginning of a period of wealth and prosperity for the Roman Catholic church in northwestern Europe. This new French High Gothic style of architecture was characteristic of soaring ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, pointed arches, ornamental gargoyles, carved turrets and canopies, and stained glass windows.\n\nStained glass, as an early form of graphic design in the built environment, reached its pinnacle during the Middle Ages in France and England when it became a primary means of visually communicating symbolic narratives from either the Bible, history, or literature through the use of universal imagery to largely illiterate congregations. Chartres was one of the first architectural structures of the era to accommodate the extensive use of stained glass. Its magnificent stained glass windows, totaling 176, function as illuminated wall decorations inspired by medieval illuminated manuscripts that transform the interiors of this religious monument with a blaze of light and color.\n\nletterforms as an integral and consistent visual element in all of his work. With Santa Maria Novella, Alberti relied upon many of the proportional principles and pure geometric design elements found in the Pantheon (125; see page 31). Alberti considered ornament, including Roman square capital letterforms, as a decorative surface treatment, and this is reflected in the building facade’s broad frieze, pilasters,\n\nentablature, and oculus, all crowned by a pediment depicting the Dominican order’s solar emblem. The entablature directly below this pediment carries the name of the church’s patron: IOHAN(N)ES ORICELLARIUS PAU(LI) F(ILIUS) AN(NO) SAL(UTIS) MCCCCLXX (Giovanni Rucellai son of Paolo in the blessed year 1470). Here, letterform and architecture are one and the same with the inscription running the full length and height of the surface of the entablature.\n\nCHARTRES CATHEDRAL STAINED GLASS WINDOWS Chartres, France designer unknown\n\nBASILICA OF SANTA MARIA NOVELLA 1470 BASILICA OF SANTA MARIA NOVELLA BUILDING FACADE Florence, Italy Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), Architect Genoa, Italy\n\nThe Basilica of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, is considered to be one of the first great monuments of the Renaissance. It is also one of the first primary examples of how letterform, as well as its visual characteristics, proportions, and material, played an important and active role in the design of an architectural facade. Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), the first great architect and theoretician of the Renaissance era, was the first to consider classical 32\n\n33\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES I\n\nPIAZZA CAMPIDOGLIO 1538 PIAZZA CAMPIDOGLIO (Completed in 1940) Rome, Italy Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), Architect Caprese, Italy\n\nMichelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, also known simply as Michelangelo (1475– 1564), an Italian sculptor, painter, poet, engineer, and architect, was one of the defining creative minds of the Renaissance. In 1505, he was invited to Rome by Pope Julius II (1443–1513) to design his tomb, a tumultuous association that would last for more than 40 years. In 1508, Michelangelo began work on a monumental fresco depicting scenes\n\nfrom the Old Testament for the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which he completed four years later. Following the completion of the Sistine frescoes, he became the chief architect of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome in 1546. Michelangelo also designed the Capitoline, the site of the capital of the Roman Empire in Rome, in 1538. The site’s urban plaza is a powerful spatial and visual demonstration of what graphic design and architecture can achieve.\n\nThe pavement pattern of the Capitoline’s Piazza Campidoglio, an early form of optical illusion used in a public space, comes alive with the perception that a dome composed of an interwoven twelve-pointed star is rising into the void of the space framed by the surrounding buildings. While the pavement design was never executed in Michelangelo’s lifetime, Italy’s Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini (1883–1945) ordered the pavement completed in 1940.\n\nTAJ MAHAL 1653 TAJ MAHAL Agra, India Ustad Ahmad Lahauri (1580–1649), Architect Lahore, Persia\n\nThe Taj Mahal or “crown of palaces” in Agra, India, marks the culmination of Shah Jahan’s (1592–1666) architectural activities and was erected in memory of his beloved consort, Mumtaz-i-Mahal (1593–1631). Built in the Mughai architectural style, a style that combines elements of Persian, Turkish, and Indian architectural influences, the Taj Mahal is one of the most admired and widely recognized buildings in the world and has been described as “the jewel of Muslim art in India.”\n\nIts construction began in 1632 and was completed in 1653, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The Taj Mahal’s decorative and commemorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, semiprecious stone inlays, and carvings to the building’s white marble facades and interior wall surfaces. Islamic inscriptions taken from the Koran are either calligraphic, abstract, or plant-based in motif since Islamic law forbids the use of any anthropomorphic or human-based forms.\n\nTHE SHAKER AESTHETIC 1842 MEETINGHOUSE SIGN New Lebanon, New York, USA Hancock Shaker Village, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA designer unknown\n\nThe Shaker aesthetic has been an inspirational influence on graphic design in the built environments of the modern world. The Shakers anticipated the future principles of functionalism and American architect Louis Sullivan’s (1856–1924) famous dictum “form follows function” when they affirmed “hands to work, hearts to God” and “the best is that which functions best.” The first Shaker community was founded by Ann Lee (1736–1784) in Manchester, England. At the age of twenty-two, she joined the 34\n\n35\n\nQuakers, who at the time were being persecuted in England. In 1774, she escaped oppression by fleeing to America, where she established a community in Watervliet, New York. The household tools, furniture, objects, and various wares designed by the Shaker communities were truly remarkable, both on a creative and aesthetic level. Rocking chairs, stoves, their famous boxes, and meetinghouse signs were all imbued with a purity and simplicity of form, whether made from wood or metal.\n\nPRE-20TH-CENTURY INFLUENCES\n\nCORN PALACE 1892 CORN PALACE BUILDING FACADE Mitchell, South Dakota, USA I\n\nRapp & Rapp (est. c. 1900), Architects Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nOriginally built in 1892, the Corn Palace (also known as the Corn Belt Exposition) showcased the rich agricultural opportunities available in South Dakota and encouraged people to settle in the state. The building is also a graphic and architectural celebration of corn, farming, and agriculture in South Dakota. Rebuilt in 1921, this Moorish Revival building is decorated throughout with crop art, its murals and decorative details made of corn and other harvested grains\n\nfrom the region. This “living” building facade is redecorated every year by local artists and designers with only natural-colored corn and two tons of grains and grasses.\n\nThis popular tourist attraction serves as a local arena and civic auditorium for numerous community and regional events and is visited by more than 500,000 people every year.\n\nTHE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT 1893 GREEN DRAGON HOTEL BUILDING FACADE Hereford, United Kingdom Craven Dunhill & Co. Ltd. (est. 1872), Designers Shropshire, United Kingdom\n\nThe Arts and Crafts movement, led by British textile designer, artist, writer, theorist, and socialist William Morris (1834–1896), celebrated traditional craftsmanship, simple forms, and a reliance on the decorative arts. One of the movement’s fundamental goals was to elevate the applied arts to the same level as fine arts in the public’s perception. These tenets became the basis for the birth of modernism, as well as for the genesis of the Bauhaus in Germany in the early 1900s.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, elaborate architectural facades were enhanced with typographic and ornamental motifs communicating the wares and offerings of commercial establishments and often constructed from standard and repetitive units of glazed ceramic tiles. The exterior facade of the Green Dragon Hotel is a prime example of this construction technique used during the Arts and Crafts era. The building’s tiled facade reflects the most durable and permanent of all forms of advertising and is composed of glazed machine-pressed relief tiles containing stylistic letterforms of the era, designed and manufactured by Craven Dunhill & Co. Ltd. (est. 1872), one of the United Kingdom’s leading producers of ceramic tiles.\n\nII THE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nART AND TECHNOLOGY: A NEW UNITY 1901–1928\n\nSTYLE AND THE MASS MARKET 1924–1947\n\nBETWEEN THE WARS 1932–1945\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933 Paris Metro Entrances, 1898 Paris, France Hector Guimard (1867–1942), Architect Lyon, France\n\n1\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, change appeared everywhere. In civilized cultures throughout the world, traditional beliefs were starting to be overshadowed by emerging new ideas. A flood of groundbreaking innovations and inventions redefined the architecture and built environment and forever transformed the nowindustrialized modern world. In the 1870s, the invention of electricity and the incandescent lightbulb by Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) ultimately enhanced the way in which people interacted with one another and with the built environments they lived in. Communication was also dramatically altered in the late nineteenth century by the introduction of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922) and his assistant, Thomas Watson (1854–1934). The development of the first commercially successful internal combustion engine in 1858 by Belgian engineer Étienne Lenoir (1822–1900) and improvements to the assembly line technique of mass production by American industrialist Henry Ford (1863–1947) in the early 1900s, revolutionized the manner in which people traveled from destination to destination, ultimately allowing them to explore every corner of the world. At the beginning of the century, there were approximately 8,000 automobiles in the United States. In 1906, President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt (1858–1919) initiated American domestic tourism by encouraging Americans public to take to the road and “See America First.” Americans’ love affair with the new automobile and their desire to be mobile and explore the open road grew, and with it came the development of the country’s city, state, and federal road systems; service stations, motor courts, and motels. New and revolutionary explorations in art and architecture around the world also inevitably influenced graphic design in the\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933, CONTINUED\n\nbuilt environment during this time period. While the art nouveau movement reached its peak of popularity at the end of the nineteenth century, the birth of modern art, which set the stage for modernism, was considered by many to have begun with Pablo Picasso’s (1881–1973) groundbreaking painting Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon), completed in 1907. Innovative building materials and construction technologies created towering skyscrapers that began to appear in the built landscape that literally altered the urban experience. Improved transportation systems redefined urban metropolises like Paris, Moscow, New York, and London. These and many more twentieth-century innovations and inventions transformed the potential for graphic design in the built environment in the modern world more rapidly and widely than in any previous century.\n\n40\n\n41\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\nTHE INCANDESCENT LIGHTBULB\n\nII\n\n1879 CARBON-FILAMENT ELECTRIC LIGHTBULB PATENT DRAWING Menlo Park, New Jersey, USA Thomas Edison (1847–1931), Inventor Milan, Ohio, USA\n\nThomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) was an American inventor, scientist, and businessman who greatly influenced modern life throughout the twentieth century. He was one of the most prolific inventors in history, with over 1,000 U.S. patents, as well as many held in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Edison is credited with numerous inventions that contributed to the rapid development of the modern, industrialized world including the stock ticker, electric power, the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the incandescent lightbulb. He was born in Milan, Ohio, and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. His initial interest in mass communications was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey,\n\nvestors, including American financier J. P. Morgan (1837–1913) and members of the Vanderbilt family. On December 31, 1879, he made the first public demonstration of his incandescent lightbulb in Menlo Park, New Jersey. While Edison did not invent the first electric lightbulb, he did invent the first commercially\n\nnesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting lightbulbs, as well as creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electrical power. The incandescent lightbulb had a tremendous impact on the evolution of graphic design in the built environment and revolutionized the\n\nin 1877 with an entrepreneurial spirit and business acumen that led him to found fourteen companies over the course of his career, including General Electric in 1892, one of the world’s largest publicly traded companies. In 1878, Edison created the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several in-\n\npractical incandescent lightbulb. By 1879, he had produced a high-heat-resistance lamp with a carbon filament that burned for hundreds of hours and glowed a warm light comparable to that of a candle’s flame. He then developed the lightbulb’s extensive commercial applications and was able to market it to homes and busi-\n\nway in which we experience the nuances of type, image, symbol, and visual storytelling in the modern architectural world.\n\nEIFFEL TOWER 1889 EIFFEL TOWER Paris, France Alexandre Gustave Eiffel (1832–1923), Architect Dijon, France\n\n42\n\nThe Exposition Universelle of 1889, marking the centennial of the storming of the Bastille and the beginning of the French Revolution, was located on the banks of the river Seine in Paris running along the Champs de Mars and the Trocadero. The world’s fair covered 237 acres (95.9 ha), had 7,000 foreign exhibitors, and was attended by 32.2 million visitors by the time of its closing. The main symbol and focal point of the Exposition Universelle was the Eiffel Tower, which served as the main-entrance archway to the fair. It was constructed of puddle iron, a form of wrought iron, and was named after its designer, Gustave Eiffel (1832–1923). Alexandre Gustave Eiffel was a French structural engineer, as well as an architect, entrepreneur, and specialist in metal structures. In\n\nchemistry, receiving the equivalent of a master of science degree in 1855. The École Centrale was a liberal private school that is now known as one of the top engineering schools in Europe. At the time of its completion, the Eiffel Tower was the world’s tallest structure at 985 feet (305 m), illuminated by gaslights from top to bottom and painted five shades of red, from a dark bronze at the base to a golden yellow at its apex. The tower quickly became Paris’s top tourist attraction, drawing millions of people to the city and large amounts of money into France’s economy. At the time, few disagreed with an American news correspondent who\n\naddition to the acclaim he received for designing and building the Eiffel Tower for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, he was also notable for designing the inner supporting armature for the Statue of Liberty (1886) in New York Harbor. He attended the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in Paris, where he studied\n\nwrote that it deserved to be included with “the wonders of the world.” While it was initially considered an unsightly folly to many Parisians, this iconic spire has reigned over Paris for more than a century. After the closing of the exposition, it was set to be demolished but was left intact because\n\n43\n\nof its added function as a radio transmission tower. The Eiffel Tower has become a universal symbol for France, as well as for the creative pioneering spirit that marked the beginning of the industrialized modern era.\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nTHE MODERN BILLBOARD 1891 OCEAN BREEZES ELECTRIC BILLBOARD New York, New York, USA Oscar J. Gude (1862–1925), Designer\n\nsandwich men paraded up and down Broadway and other busy commercial thoroughfares in New York City advertising the latest entertainments and offerings. In 1889 at the Exposition Universelle in Paris and four years later at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the world’s first twenty-four-sheet billboard was introduced and quickly became the standard format for various types of large-scale advertising throughout Europe and the United States. Prior to the automobile, large-scale outdoor advertisements were limited to being painted on building walls of cities and towns\n\nthroughout the world. In the early 1900s, billboards were painted in large production studios throughout the United States. To create a typical billboard advertisement, an image was first projected on a series of individual panels that made up the entire billboard, then “pounced” on the panels, which marked in outline all of the visual elements of the advertisement, such as figures, products, and letterforms. Production artists would then use large brushes and oil paints to complete the billboard image. Once the individual panels were installed, artcontinued on page 44\n\nII\n\nA billboard (also known as a “hoarding” in the United Kingdom and in many other areas of the world) is a large outdoor advertising structure, typically located alongside busy roads and in high-traffic urban areas, that displays largescale commercial advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the billboard took on many evolving forms in the built environment. American showman P. T. Barnum (1810–1891) relied upon huge banners and woodcuts to advertise his P. T.

With the introduction of electricity to New York City in 1882 by Thomas Edison (1847– 1931; see page 41), billboard advertisements in cities around the world started to rely upon this new lighting technology in new ways. Oscar J. Gude (1862–1925), one of New York City’s first sign impresarios, designed the first electric billboard in 1891. Located on the facade of the Cumberland Hotel at the intersection of 23rd Street, Broadway, and Fifth Avenue, this 80-foot- (24.4 m) high by 60-foot- (18.3 m) wide typographic billboard was composed of 1,457 incandescent lightbulbs, built and\n\n44\n\n45\n\ninstalled by the Edison Electrical Company, and advertised the Long Island Railroad’s new Coney Island resort—Ocean Breezes. Nine years later, Gude’s electric billboard for the H. J. Heinz Company in 1900 covered the same building facade of the Cumberland Hotel and was the first to use a pictorial image, in this case a giant 40-foot (12.2 m) wide pickle, flashing on and off against a contrasting and complementary colored blue and orange background. Directly below were some of Heinz’s fifty-seven varieties also displayed in electric typographic lights. This new and innovative method of advertising marked the beginning of the “sign spectacular” (see page 100) that was\n\nto become a common sight along New York City’s future Great White Way (see page 48). In 1908, the Model T automobile was introduced in the United States by industrialist Henry Ford (1863–1947). With the advent of new printing technologies and an increase in the number of automobiles worldwide, advertising billboards grew larger and more colorful. By the next decade, many more motorists were taking to the roads, and therefore the billboard advertisement became an ever-present element in the modern built landscape.\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nII\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\n1\n\nHECTOR GUIMARD AND THE PARIS METRO 1898 PARIS METRO ENTRANCES Paris, France Hector Guimard (1867–1942), Architect Lyon, France\n\nArchitect Hector Guimard’s (1867–1942) art nouveau–styled station entrances for the Paris underground railway system have become timeless symbols for the city of Paris, known throughout the world. Introduced in 1889 at the Paris Exposition Universelle, the initial controversial design ultimately inspired a visual style known as Metro. Guimard was born in Lyon, France, and studied at the École Nationals des Arts Décoratifs and École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While his early design influences came from the English\n\nArts and Crafts movement, he became one of the primary representatives of the art nouveau movement during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In addition to his famous entrances for the Paris metro, he was known for other renowned projects throughout Paris, such as Villa Bérthe (1896), Le Castel Béranger (1897), and Maison Coilliot (1898). His metro station entrances, constructed solely of curvilinear cast iron and glass and culled from natural forms, are seminal examples of visual harmony and continuity in the\n\nart nouveau style. Guimard’s innovative and pragmatic use of standardized formed-metal elements allowed the entrances to be assembled in varied sizes and configurations. Their distinctively sinuous and organic lines, also evident in their decorative patterns, figurative ironwork, mosaics, stained glass, and handdrawn art nouveau–style letterforms inspired by the work of French type designer George Auriol (1863–1938), provided a graphic vitality and identity that is still an integral part of the Paris metro’s visual brand.\n\nCOMMERCE AND THE URBAN STREETSCAPE ca. 1900 NEW YORK CITY STREETSCAPE New York, New York, USA designers/architects unknown\n\nIn the later part of the nineteenth century, the urban streetscape started to transform itself due to the effects and outcome of the industrialized world. The heights of buildings grew taller and taller; telegraph and telephone wires crisscrossed thoroughfares, creating weblike patterns overhead; and commerce expanded at an accelerated rate, thereby increasing the number of advertising and promotional signs evident on any given city street. All of these\n\n46\n\n47\n\nmodern developments added to the visual chaos of the new urban streetscape. During this same time period, the general store began to disappear in most cities and was replaced by the modern department store. Large-scale retailers such as Macy’s, Benjamin Altman, and Lord & Taylor in New York City; Whiteleys in London; La Samaritaine (1906; see page 55) in Paris; Marshall Field and Co. in Chicago; and Wanamaker’s in Philadelphia became\n\nan integral part of the urban streetscape. While these retailers became the universal providers for the general public, there was also a new need for discounted merchandise. The F. W. Woolworth Co. was among the first “five-and-dime” retail stores to sell discounted general wares and merchandise at fixed prices, usually five or ten cents, to the American public while simultaneously undercutting the price of other local merchants.\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\n1902 F. W. WOOLWORTH STORE SIGN Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nThe first Woolworth store was opened in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1902 by the company’s founder, Frank Winfield Woolworth (1852–1919) and was an immediate success. Its storefront also stood apart from any other establishment on the commercial street. Its distinctive bright-red sign band spanned the entire length of the storefront and displayed large-scale, cast-serif, all-capital letterforms painted in metallic gold—a graphic treatment\n\nused for decades on all its storefronts that reinforced their brand, which came to be known for ease of shopping and reasonable prices.\n\nII\n\nWoolworth’s, as it came to be popularly known, was also one of the first retailers to locate merchandise out in the open or “on the floor” for the shopping public to view, handle, and select without the assistance of sales staff. The pervasive and popular general store up until this time period had kept all merchandise behind a sales counter, and customers presented a list of items they wanted to purchase to the sales clerk for processing.\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\ndesigner unknown\n\nTHE GREAT WHITE WAY 1903\n\n1905\n\n1929\n\nNEW AMSTERDAM THEATER FACADE\n\nTHE HIPPODROME BUILDING FACADE\n\nHOLLYWOOD REVUE MARQUEE\n\nNew York, New York, USA\n\nNew York, New York, USA\n\nNew York, New York, USA\n\nHerts & Tallant (est. 1900), Architects\n\nThomas Lamb (1871–1942), J.

In 1880, a section of Broadway between Union Square and Madison Square was illumi48\n\n49\n\nnated by Edison’s new invention—the incandescent lightbulb (1879; see page 41), making it among the first electrically illuminated streets in the United States. By the late 1890s, Broadway from 23rd Street to 34th Street was so brightly illuminated by marquees and billboard advertising signs, people began calling the area “the Great White Way.” When the Theater District relocated uptown, between 42nd and 53rd Streets, and encompassed Times Square, the name was transferred to this relocated area.\n\nThe New Amsterdam Theater was, for many years, the most prestigious theater along the Great White Way and home to legendary Broadway impresario Florenz Ziegfeld’s (1867–1932) world-renowned follies. Designed by theatrical architects Herts & Tallant (est. 1900) and completed in 1903, the theater’s interior is one of the few remaining examples of art nouveau architecture in New York City. The original theater’s entrance spanned three stories and was the most lavish feature of the\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nII\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\n1\n\nbuilding’s ornamental exterior with a triumphal arch portal flanked by rusticated piers that supported paired marble columns at the second floor. Elaborate stone carvings, floral scrolls, and five figurative sculptures—a knight, a maiden, and three statues representing comedy, drama, and music, designed by American sculptor George Grey Barnard (1863–1938)—prominently rested on the facade’s cornice with art nouveau–styled bronze flower motifs framing the windows located directly above. The restored interior is a seamless visual extension of the theater’s facade and among the most richly detailed and ornamented buildings from the turn of the century. It is distinguished by art nouveau–styled botanical motifs framing bas-relief frieze paneling depicting scenes from Shakespeare, Wagner, and Faust.\n\ntween 43rd and 44th Streets in New York City, it was designed by American architects Thomas Lamb (1871–1942) and J. H. Morgan (dates unknown) and built by show promoters Frederic Thompson (1872–1919) and Elmer S. Dundy (1862–1907), who also created Luna Park (see page 51) on Coney Island the same year. This eclectic Beaux-Arts– and Moorishstyled building included a 5,300-seat auditorium with 5,000 incandescent lightbulbs that formed a glowing sunburst pattern in its ceiling. The Hippodrome’s vast projecting stage was large enough to hold 600 performers, two circus rings, and a large elliptical water tank and was well known at the time for its theatrical extravaganzas, performances by dancing elephants, boxing matches, and operas. The building’s block-long exterior was con-\n\ntypographic statements identifying the auditorium, as well as advertising current attractions and performances. Mortimer Norden (1873–1962) was one of the earliest commercial sign designers responsible for conceiving many of the illuminated sign displays in Times Square during the 1920s and 1930s. He was born in New York City in 1873, studied at City College and Cooper Union, and worked as an electrician for years before becoming a sign maker. In 1929, then general manager of the commercial sales division of General Outdoor Advertising Company (est. 1925), Norden designed the one-of-a-kind and never-seen-before “living” Hollywood Revue sign. The sign, or faux facade, was located at the corner of Broadway and West 45th Street in New York City and posi-\n\nIn 1982, the theater was designated a New York City Landmark and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hippodrome was known as the largest theatrical structure in the world at the time of its completion in 1905. Located on Sixth Avenue (now known as Avenue of the Americas) be-\n\nceived as one of the first electrically illuminated billboards and was said to “throw a fire and glare of electric illumination for miles.” Framed by its two corner towers, each supporting a sparkling illuminated sphere outlined in white incandescent lightbulbs, the entrance facade was composed of varied-scaled illuminated\n\ntioned directly above the marquee of the Astor Theater (George Keister, 1906), where the revue was performing. The sign was notorious because at timed intervals throughout the evening, live chorus continued on page 50\n\nThe Great White Way, continued\n\n1931\n\n50\n\n1933\n\nTRANS-LUX THEATER MARQUEE\n\nBILL MINSKY’S BURLESQUE\n\nNew York, New York, USA\n\nBUILDING FACADE\n\nThomas Lamb (1871–1942), Architect\n\nNew York, New York, USA\n\nDundee, Scotland\n\ndesigner unknown\n\ngirls would step out onto a series of catwalks and perform for the passing crowds in Times Square. No other advertisement or promotional gimmick has ever surpassed Norden’s concept. It was memorable, eye-catching, and provided the most immediate means, visual and experiential, for promoting a live revue in the theater. The Trans-Lux Theater, deemed as “the modern theater” in 1931, was on the corner of 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City. It was the first movie theater to use a rearprojection system and featured modern amenities such as larger seats, larger screen, more legroom, and wider aisles than the average theater of its day. Its rear-projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, eliminating the need for ushers, and also eliminated the distraction of a\n\nbeam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. The building interior, as well as its distinctive art deco–style Moderne facade, was designed by renowned theater architect Thomas Lamb (1871–1942). Minsky’s Burlesque was one of the most popular entertainment venues in New York City’s Times Square during the 1930s. It also refers to a brand of American burlesque presented by the infamous Minsky Brothers during the early 1900s, which was declared obscene, immoral, and outlawed in most cities throughout the country. Following the Great Depression (1929– 1940), legitimate theaters were finding it more and more difficult to draw the American public to their productions and still stay profitable. During this same time period, Michael Wil-\n\n51\n\nliam “Billy” Minsky (1887–1932) realized that burlesque could be presented in a refined and sophisticated manner and proposed bringing the Minsky brand of tawdry entertainment to Broadway in the midst of the district’s respectable theatrical shows. In 1931, the Republic Theater (Albert Westover, 1900) just west of Broadway on 42nd Street was acquired by the owners of the burlesque circuit, the Minsky Brothers. The Republic became Minsky’s flagship theater and, soon after, the burlesque capital of the United States. The theater’s facade became well known for its bold, whimsical typography and checkerboard photographic pattern, juxtaposed with large-scale reproductions of the faces of his leading ladies, including the famous stripper Gypsy Rose Lee (1914–1970). The Republic theater is now known as the New Victory Theater.\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nLUNA PARK 1903 LUNA PARK Coney Island, New York, USA Frederic Thompson (1872–1919), Elmer Dundy (1862–1907), Designers\n\nThe park’s innovative creators, Frederic Thompson (1872–1919) and Elmer “Skip” Dundy (1862–1907), were showmen who entertained the American public at the turn of the century. Both men had made a name for themselves at the Pan-American Exposition held in Buffalo, New York, in 1901. It was there that they had created a highly popular attraction or cyclorama show called “A Trip to the Moon,” where the public was transported by an enormous ship with huge, flapping wings on an imaginary journey to the Moon. The name of this winged ship was Luna—the Latin word for Moon. The park became an instant success and featured attractions such as “War of the\n\nWorlds”—a monster battleship with turrets, spontoons, and protruding guns; “Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea”—a submarine ride to the polar regions; the Electric Tower; the Dragon’s Gorge; a wild animal show and circus; and hundreds of other rides and attractions. The premier attraction at Luna Park was Thompson and Dundy’s “A Trip to the Moon.” It was a visual spectacle and pleasure garden where anyone who visited could be immediately transported to a picturesque wonderland— a unique and memorable experience that would not be replicated or redefined until some fifty years later with Walt Disney’s Disneyland (1955; see page 130).\n\nII\n\nLuna Park was one of the world’s first amusement parks that operated in Coney Island in New York City from 1903 to 1944. This 4.15-acre (1.68 ha) fantasyland of exotic spires, towers, minarets, and domes with colorful half-moons adorning its facades and entrances looked like no other city in the world. At night, it was transformed with more than one million incandescent lightbulbs that outlined the façade of every structure. It amazed the public and drew international attention at a time when electrification was still a novelty, and there was nothing else like it in America. At its peak of popularity in 1904, Luna Park attracted 90,000 visitors a day.\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\nIrontown, Ohio, USA; Omaha, Nebraska, USA\n\nNEW YORK CITY SUBWAY 1904 FULTON STREET SUBWAY STATION New York, New York, USA Heins & LaFarge (est. 1886), Architects New York, New York, USA\n\n52\n\nNew York City’s first subway system, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), opened in 1904 and immediately provided the inhabitants of the largest city in the world with a new means of transportation like they had never experienced before. The initial subway line, acclaimed for its high speeds of 40 miles per hour, connected City Hall in Lower Manhattan with the city’s northern borough of the Bronx. The first IRT stations were public monuments to the classical Beaux-Arts style of the era and designed by the architectural firm Heins & LaFarge (est. 1886). Philadelphia-born architect George Lewis Heins (1860–1907) and Christopher Grant LaFarge (1862–1938) first met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge and subsequently worked together at the Boston offices of prominent\n\nterra-cotta panels set within Guastavino*-tiled arches and vaults. Each station was based on a common organizational grid of supporting columns spaced every 15 feet (4.58 m) that created a series of spaces or bays that became the surface area for unique visual motifs designed for each station. Each rectangular bay was clad with 3 X 6-inch (.9 X 1.83 m) white glass tiles that served as a common field or visual ground for distinctive graphics and identification tablet signs that collectively distinguished one station from another. As a counterpoint to the repetitive pattern of bays and columns, a continuous wainscot of yellow Norman brick was also incorporated on all wall surfaces to visually unify all stations. Identification tablet signs were composed of small mosaic tiles in both serif and sans-serif\n\nAmerican architect Henry Hobson (H. H.) Richardson (1838–1886) before opening their own firm. They were also well known for winning the design competition for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. The IRT stations were graphic and architectural showplaces for mosaics and polychrome\n\ncapital letterforms and framed within a decorative graphic border. Directional signs incorporating arrows indicated exits from each station and were also made of mosaic tiles in both styles of letterforms. Faience polychrome panels depicting various New York iconography such as Robert Fulton’s steamship the Clermont and\n\n53\n\ninitial letters such as S for Spring Street were also incorporated into the walls of the IRT’s twenty-eight subway stations for identification and enhancement purposes. As the transit system grew and incorporated the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit (BMT) and the Independent (IND) lines in 1940, station identification evolved into other graphic styles that were derived from the time period when that station was built. *Guastavino refers to the Guastavino Tile Arch System that was created in 1885 by Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino (1842–1908). The system allows for the construction of selfsupporting arches and architectural vaults using interlocking tiles that follow the profile of a curve.\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nONE TIMES SQUARE AND THE FIRST ZIPPER 1904 ONE TIMES SQUARE New York, New York, USA Eidlitz & McKenzie (est. 1900), Architects\n\nII\n\nOne Times Square, also known as 1475 Broadway, the New York Times Building, and the New York Times Tower, was a 25-story, 395-foot-high (110.6 m) skyscraper located at the “Crossroads of the World”—the intersection of 42nd Street, Broadway, and Seventh Avenue in New York City’s Times Square. The building, designed by the architectural and engineering firm Eidlitz & McKenzie (est. 1900), became the second tallest building in Manhattan when it was completed in 1904. It was originally built as the headquarters of the New York Times, which even before the building’s opening utilized electrically powered incandescent lighting displays on its facade, including a searchlight on its roof that could be seen for more than 30 miles, to announce the election of Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) as president in November 1904. When the publisher held its opening celebration with a display of fireworks on January 1, 1905, at midnight, it became an annual tradition in Times Square to this day. The famous New Year’s Eve ball drop tradition began in 1907. The iconic electric news ticker or “zipper” display was introduced in 1928 and was first used to announce the results of the U.S. presidential election that year. Encircling the entire base of the building, the zipper display was composed of 14,800 incandescent lightbulbs and was active twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. To this day, the data-driven ticker or zipper is universally known as one of the most effective and universally identifiable vehicles to communicate real-time news and financial information to the worldwide public.\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\nNew York, New York, USA\n\nFRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND THE LARKIN BUILDING ATRIUM 1904 LARKIN BUILDING ATRIUM Buffalo, New York, USA Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959), Architect Richland Center, Wisconsin, USA\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959), recognized by many as the greatest architect of all time, was an American architect, interior designer, author, and educator. He promoted “organic architecture,” was a leader of the Prairie School style of architecture, and developed the concept of the Usonian home. His pioneering work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including office buildings, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums such as Robie House (1910), Fallingwater (1935), Johnson Wax Building (1939), Taliesin West (1937), Price Tower (1956), and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1959). He also designed many of the interiors of his buildings, including their furniture, lighting, textiles, and stained glass. In 1904, Wright designed the Larkin Administration Building for the Larkin Soap Company of Buffalo, New York. This five-story, dark-red sandstone brick building was one of the first buildings in the United States to utilize steel construction, as well as incorporate innovations such as air-conditioning, built-in furniture, and a rooftop garden and recreation area for the needs of the new, modern-day office worker. One of the building’s most distinctive elements was its 76-foot- (23 m) tall light court or top-lit atrium in the center of the building, which provided natural daylight to all of its floors, as well as a large central work space for employees, located at the atrium’s base. Between the light court’s supporting piers, Wright incorporated a series of typographic inscriptions displayed in the spandrel panels of the galleries. Forty-two inspirational words set in all-caps, serif-styled letterforms, articulated in gold leaf, and framed in sets of three typographic lines with decorative geometric motifs 54\n\n55\n\ncommunicated moral and virtuous messages ranging from “intelligence, enthusiasm, control” to “cooperation, economy, and industry.” At the time of its opening, The Larkin Adminstration Building drew international acclaim\n\nand was described as “the most advanced office of its time, with perhaps the most perfect relationship between architectural invention and organizational innovation that has ever been achieved.”\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nLA SAMARITAINE DEPARTMENT STORE 1906 LA SAMARITAINE DEPARTMENT STORE Paris, France Frantz Jourdain (1847–1935), Architect\n\nglass facade with a forest of metal scrollwork, foliage, and ornamental embellishments.

As one of the first fast-food restaurant chains in the United States, Horn & Hardart Automats quickly became popular in northern industrial cities during the Great Depression due to their offering of simple food, quick turnaround, and low prices. These self-service, coin-operated restaurants featured 56\n\n57\n\nprepared foods displayed in individual-serving compartments behind glass doors. Initially they offered only buns, beans, fish cakes, and coffee, with each item costing five cents and available for purchase by dropping a nickel into a slot. Eventually, they served lunch and dinner entrées, such as beef stew and Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes. Each wall of vending machine windows was capped with a series of white translucent glass panels displaying highly stylized, black in-line, all-capital Moderne letterforms identifying each food category, such as soup,\n\nvegetables, entrées, pies, cakes, and hot coffee. Horn & Hardart was one of the first venues in the United States to mass market art deco–like graphic styling during the austere times of the Depression to promote and advertise their offerings to the general public. Their graphic branding raised simple food at low prices to a higher level in the public’s perception. Originally, the vending machines took only nickels. A diner would insert the required number of coins in a slot then lift a window, which was hinged at the top, to remove a meal. The machines were filled from the kitchen behind. Horn & Hardart Automats were particularly popular during the Depression when their macaroni and cheese, baked beans, and creamed spinach were staple offerings. By the early 1940s, Horn & Hardart had 157 restaurants in the Philadelphia and New York region, serving more than 500,000 customers per day.\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nGRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL 1913 GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL New York, New York, USA Warren & Wetmore (est. 1887), Architects\n\nthe New York Central Railroad at the prime of long-distance passenger train travel in America, it is the largest train station in the world, covering an area of 48 acres (19 ha) with forty-four platforms and sixty-seven railroad tracks.

The sixty largest stars, which identify the constellations, were illuminated from behind with an adjustable, incandescent lighting system that gave them the correct celestial prominence.\n\n59\n\nLocated on the main concourse’s south wall were the original information displays that identified times and track numbers for all arriving and departing trains.

A small prototype of this display system, designed and manufactured by Solari Udine (est. 1725) of Italy, is in New York City’s Museum of Modern Art’s design collection.\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nFIRST MODERN TRAFFIC LIGHT\n\nFIRST THREE-WAY TRAFFIC SIGNAL\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah, USA\n\nCleveland, Ohio, USA\n\nLester Wire (1887–1958), Designer\n\nGarrett Morgan (1877–1963), Designer\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah, USA\n\nCleveland, Ohio, USA\n\nTraffic lights, also known throughout the world as stoplights, traffic lamps, traffic signals, or semaphores, are visual signaling devices at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other road locations to control competing flows of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. These visual devices use a universal color code—green for traffic to proceed in the appropriate direction, yellow/amber for traffic to caution and prepare to stop short of the intersection, and red to prohibit traffic from proceeding forward. These three colors are always displayed in a precise sequence that enables people who are colorblind to comprehend the same information. The first modern red–green electric traffic light was invented by Lester Wire (1887–1958), a Salt Lake City policeman, in 1912. This new system relied upon two complementary colors, red and green; a buzzer that provided an audible warning to drivers and pedestrians when each color changed; and a default control that allowed police and fire stations to control signals in case of an emergency. In 1923, the first three-way traffic signal was invented by Garrett Morgan (1877–1963) that used a three-armed signal mounted to a T-shaped pole indicating “stop” and “go” for traffic in two directions and a third signal for stopping traffic in all directions before the stop and go signals changed. This third signal was the forerunner to the modern yellow or amber traffic light. The earliest road signs in the built environment were milestones or stone obelisks that appeared along the Roman Empire’s Appian Way (312 BCE). In the Middle Ages, multidirectional signs at road intersections became commonplace, giving directions to nearby towns and cities.\n\nBy the early 1900s, modern-day road sign systems were being developed throughout the world. Their standardization based on shape, color, and universal graphic symbols, was set at the 1908 International Road Congress in Rome,\n\nItaly. Subsequently, the United Kingdom and the United States further developed their own road sign systems, which were adopted or modified by many other nations worldwide by the 1920s.\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\n1923\n\nII\n\n1914\n\nGEORGES CLAUDE AND LIQUID FIRE 1915\n\n60\n\n1923\n\nNEON LIGHTING TUBE PATENT DRAWING\n\nPACKARD NEON SIGN\n\nParis, France\n\nLos Angeles, California, USA\n\nGeorges Claude (1870–1960), Inventor\n\nGeorges Claude (1870–1960), Designer\n\nParis, France\n\nParis, France\n\nGeorges Claude (1870–1960) was a French engineer known for the invention and commercialization of neon tube lighting. Neon tube lighting is created by a chemical reaction or electrical glow discharge that occurs between an electrode and neon or other gases contained within brightly glowing glass tubing or bulbs. For example, neon gas produces an intense red, while argon gas produces a grayish blue. By coating the interior surface of the glass tube, an expanded range of colors can be achieved. Considered by some as “the Edison of France,” Claude gave his first public demonstration of this new technology that was composed of two 39-foot (12 m) bright-red neon glass tubes at the Salon de l’Automobile et du Cycle (Paris Motor Show) in 1910. The City of Light’s first neon sign, 3 ½-foot- (1 m) high glowing white letters, was for the vermouth Cinzano that illuminated the night skies of Paris in 1913. In 1915, a U.S. patent (No. 1,125,476) was issued to Claude for the design of electrodes for neon gas–discharge lighting. This patent became the basis for a monopoly in the United States held by him and his company, Claude Neon Lights, for neon tube lighting that became an extremely popular technology for outdoor advertising signs and displays from the 1920s through the 1940s. The first commercial sign application of neon in the United States was for a Los Angeles–based Packard dealership in 1922. The sign read “Packard” in luminescent orange script letters framed within a complementary illuminated bright-blue border. Visible even during the day, people would stop and stare at the sign for hours and quickly dubbed it “liquid fire.” By midcentury, neon lighting became an important cultural phenomenon in the modern\n\nbuilt environment. In the United States, Times Square in New York City and Glitter Gulch in Las Vegas (see page 120) were transformed by designers such as Douglas Leigh (1907–1999; see page 100) and Young Electric Sign Company (est. 1920) and became world renowned for their nighttime neon extravaganzas or “spectaculars” (see page 100).\n\n61\n\n1\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INVENTION 1879–1933\n\nHOLLYWOODLAND 1923 HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN Los Angeles, California, USA Thomas Fisk Goff (1890–1984), Designer\n\nDuring World War II, this popular landmark sign fell into disrepair and was left in a dilapidated state for decades. In 1949, it was restored by the City of Los Angeles with the decision to not replace its lighting, to remake each of its monumental letterforms in white corrugated sheet metal, and to remove the last four letters spelling “land.”\n\nInitially built as a temporary promotional billboard and identifier for an upscale real estate development located in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign has lasted for more than 90 years and has become a visual symbol and memorable icon for the movie-making industry as well as a universally known locale.\n\nrhyming promotional messages displayed on small-scaled, sequential billboards alongside the nation’s highways. Each promotional message was organized in five or six consecutive sign panels, always keeping the reader engaged with the promise of a punchline by the end sign panel. These messages were posted along a roadside edge and spaced for sequential reading by passing motorists. The last panel in the sequence always identified the product name— Burma-Shave. The panels were produced in two-color combinations—red and white and orange and\n\nblack. The brand’s logotype was displayed on one side and “travel poetry” set in a bold, sansserif typeface appeared on the other side with memorable phrases such as “He had the ring/he had the flat/but she felt his chin/and that was that/Burma-Shave.” Public safety messages were also featured in some of the sequenced messages, usually reminding drivers about alertness and speeding. The program was an immediate success, making Burma-Shave the second-highestselling brushless shaving cream in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nBURMA-SHAVE 1925 BURMA-SHAVE ROADSIDE SIGNS designer unknown\n\nIn 1925, the Burma-Shave Company initiated an innovative and memorable roadside promotional program that literally changed the manner in which the American motorist was introduced to product advertising. Burma-Shave was a brushless shaving cream that was initially introduced to the American consumer by the Burma-Vita Company. Unfortunately, the public’s response was tepid, and the company decided to start over by developing a new product with a wider appeal. The result was the Burma-Shave advertising sign program that presented humorous and\n\nII\n\nThe Hollywood sign was erected in 1923 and originally read “HOLLYWOODLAND” with each of its white, monolithic sans-serif letterforms measuring 45 feet (14 m) high and totaling 350 linear feet (110 m). When first erected, the letters were fabricated of unprotected wood and sheet metal and were illuminated with 4,000 20-watt incandescent lightbulbs, spaced 8 inches apart. At night, the sign blinked marquee-style with a flashing, alternating sequence of “Holly,” then “wood,” and finally “land.”\n\nTHE MODERN AGE 1900–1950\n\nLos Angeles, California, USA\n\nEDWARD JOHNSTON, HENRY BECK, AND THE LONDON UNDERGROUND 1916 UNDERGROUND TYPEFACE London, United Kingdom Edward Johnston (1872–1944), Designer San José, Uruguay\n\nIn 1908, Frank Pick (1878–1941) was appointed publicity officer for the London Underground and in the following two decades drastically improved its overall visual appearance, advertising, and public information system. During his tenure, he commissioned some of the most influential artists and designers of the modern era, including renowned British typographer Edward Johnston (1872–1944), who designed the system’s famous roundel symbol (1918) and its unifying typeface. This typeface, used extensively throughout the railway system, became 62\n\n63\n\nan integral part of London’s built environment and is still evident today. Edward Johnston was a man of letters— master calligrapher, letterer, educator, author, and typeface designer. He was born in San José, Uruguay, in 1872, and as a young man, abandoned his early studies in medicine at Edinburgh University to pursue his passion for lettering and calligraphy. In 18"
