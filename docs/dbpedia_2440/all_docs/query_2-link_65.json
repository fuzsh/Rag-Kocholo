Thus, either senesce, or senescito (as previously suggested) or senescas. Then optima futura is not so much wrong as elliptical -- one is meant to understand 'optima futura sunt', I suppose. That sort of thing is technically possible, as a general rule, but it feels out of place here stylistically, and the implied change of subject is awkward; so that the two halves don't feel as if they have been conceived as part of the same sentiment, but are just glued together regardless.\n\nYes, it's Browning.\n\nsocratidion dixit:\n\nI think 'really?' is a way of saying: it is a surprise that anyone should recommend this translation in this way, not only because it is wrong, but also because announcing that it came off the notoriously inaccurate Google translate is like waving a red flag in front of a bull, as far as this website is concerned, so that one has to wonder whether the suggestion was made in earnest; but some days one just can't find the energy to do more than raise the eyebrows.\n\nLook sir, I do not formally speak Latim and that is why I'm here on this forum.

So, how would you write it my friend?\n\nBodhi dixit:\n\nLook sir, I do not formally speak Latim and that is why I'm here on this forum. To learn.\n\nThe google translation was better than \"nam secunda contingent futura\". This doesn't make sense to me at all as \"the best is yet to be\".\n\nBodhi, we do not accept mistranslations on the forum, and it is a violation of the rules to post the output of Machine Translators. If you do not formally speak Latin, then you should not be offering to translate.\n\nThese rules are not negotiable. Please don't break them again.\n\nBodhi dixit:\n\nLook sir, I do not formally speak Latim and that is why I'm here on this forum.

Since you say you are here to learn, I will explain that secunda here doesn't mean \"second things\", but \"good things\".\n\nThe Google translation was, as others have said, wrong."
