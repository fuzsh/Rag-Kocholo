        "text": "What is a web-safe font?\n\nEvery computer comes pre-loaded with a list of fonts. This means that if you use that font on your website, every user will be able to see it.\n\nHowever, if you use a font that you pay for, or add to your computer, not every user will be able to see it — rather they’ll see a very basic font in its place.\n\nWhether you notice or not, you encounter tons of fonts every day — on billboards you pass by on your drive to work, on your smartphone screen, on websites, on pizza boxes, and so many other places you may not even realize.\n\nThere are over 300,000 fonts in the world, and the number grows every year. Fonts give designers the opportunity to create designs and messages that fit nearly any style or brand — and they can evoke different feelings in consumers.\n\nFor example, script fonts create a sense of class and formality, while graffiti style fonts reflect a sense of freedom.\n\nWeb-safe fonts for your next digital project\n\nThis infographic outlines four main classes of fonts, their histories, and common uses.\n\nIn addition, we noted the web-safe fonts.\n\nLooking for some creative web-safe fonts for your next design project?\n\nWe’ve got them labeled for you!\n\nKeep in mind though that the web-safe fonts in this post are only a fraction of the entire list of web-safe fonts.\n\nReady to learn more? Check out our infographic below!\n\n1. Serif fonts\n\nSerif fonts feature short lines stemming from the upper and lower ends of letters at an angle. Readability of Serif fonts varies, but overall, the readability is mediocre.\n\nOld Style\n\nOld Style was developed by typographers of the Renaissance back in the 15th century.\n\nAs you can see in the examples, many of the letters used in the Old Style are loosely based on strokes drawn by a pen.\n\nThis font is also characterized by its wedge-shaped serifs and lack of contrast between thick and thin strokes. Fonts in this class include:\n\nAdobe\n\nGaramond – web-safe\n\nBembo\n\nMinion\n\nAmericana\n\nNeoclassical and Didone\n\nThese two typefaces are so similar, they’re typically classified as one. The fonts in this style are known for their dramatic contrast between thick and thin strokes.\n\nAt first, these fonts were named “classic” fonts, but printers changed the name when they realized they were not simply updates of classic fonts, but entirely new styles. Fonts in this class include:\n\nLinotype\n\nDidot – web-safe\n\nBodoni – web-safe\n\nBordeaux\n\nDedica\n\nTransitional\n\nThe transitional style is known as such since it is thought of as the transition between Old Style and Neoclassical fonts in the mid-18th century. The style was created by printer John Baskerville. Fonts in this class include:\n\nFranklin Gothic – web-safe\n\nFreight Sans\n\nPerpetua – web-safe\n\nBaskerville – web-safe\n\nSlab\n\nThe Slab typeface rose to popularity in the 19th-century, when it was used for advertising purposes. It’s fairly easy to read and makes headlines pop since the letter weight has virtually no contrast. Fonts in this class include:\n\nMuseo\n\nSlab\n\nAachen\n\nBree Serif\n\nClarendon\n\nThis class of fonts is known as one of the last developments in 19th-century typography — and what a great development it was! There is only a slight contrast in weight across strokes and the serifs are relatively short.\n\nIn later years, these fonts were used in larger point sizes in display applications. Fonts in this class include:\n\nITC Clearface\n\nDidot\n\nCambria – web-safe\n\nITC Bookman – web-safe\n\nGlyphic\n\nGlyphic typefaces are largely identified by their triangular-shaped serifs. Fonts in this class include:\n\nBourbon\n\nAgenda\n\nLesmore\n\nGin\n\n2. Sans Serif fonts\n\nSans Serif fonts have letters without serifs, or feet. Serif means foot, and sans means without — so together, they create the meaning “no feet.” This is typically thought of as the most readable class of fonts.\n\nGrotesque\n\nGrotesque typeface was created in 1815. It has obviously stood the test of time, since the fonts in the group are some of the most popular, even today. Letters have a somewhat square quality, and the letters have less contrast in strokes when compared to other styles.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nHelvetica – web-safe\n\nArial – web-safe\n\nProxima Nova\n\nNimbus Sans\n\nSquare\n\nSquare type is mostly used in display design, since its angular style lends itself well to graphic design. The group got its name since most of the curves are more of a square than a semi-circle. Fonts in this class include:\n\nDIN Next\n\nIndustry\n\nEurostile\n\nVan Condensed\n\nHumanistic\n\nExperts declare that the humanistic style is the most legible. However, it’s influenced by calligraphy, which is commonly thought of as hard to read.\n\nYou can make the call for yourself! Fonts in this class include:\n\nGill Sans MT – web-safe\n\nFrutiger\n\nOptima – web-safe\n\nNews Gothic BT\n\nGeometric\n\nIt’s no surprise that the Geometric style is highly influenced by geometric shapes like circles and squares. In terms of readability, the Geometric style is less readable than many other styles.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nFutura – web-safe\n\nAvenir\n\nTown\n\nFilson Soft\n\n3. Script fonts\n\nScript fonts are largely used for embellishments and not for long blocks of text. Typically seen as more formal, the letters in script fonts often connect to one another.\n\nThough these styles are super elegant, they’re not always easy to read.\n\nFormal\n\nFonts in the Formal style are typically used on wedding invitation designs, since they evoke a romantic feel. They’re typically light-weight and the letters have curly ends.\n\nSince there is so much embellishment in Formal fonts, they are typically harder to read than other styles.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nBickham Script\n\nParfumerie Script\n\nShelley Script\n\nArchive Penman\n\nCasual\n\nThe Casual style appears extremely informal, and the letters look like they’ve been jotted down. They evoke a feeling of rushed penmanship and have very different qualities from font to font. Because of their somewhat careless style, these fonts can be hard to read.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nMustang\n\nBlooming Elegant\n\nHello Beautiful\n\nBambusa\n\nCalligraphic\n\nThis long-standing style of type appears to be written with a flat-tipped writing tool. In fact, some characters are connected together, while others are not.\n\nAs a result, this can cause readability issues when the letters run together.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nMonotype Corsiva\n\nSeventies\n\nDream Script\n\nZooja\n\nBlackletter and Lombardic\n\nThis style was popular before movable type was available, which means it’s also one of the oldest styles. It’s so old, in fact, that it was created before movable type was invented.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nOld English\n\nAmador\n\nBluebeard\n\nFat Fritz\n\n4. Decorative fonts\n\nThis class of fonts is the largest and most diverse group of font styles. In addition, it’s never been used in long blocks of text, since its readability is relatively low.\n\nThe fonts in this class typically tell a story by mimicking some sort of culture or state of mind.\n\nGrunge\n\nThe Grunge style is an ode to the 80s music style that took the world by storm. The rough and bumpy edges give an underground feel, but the fonts in this group are some of the most readable in the decorative class.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nTypewriter\n\nAnodyne\n\nPinto\n\nBrush Up\n\nArt Deco\n\nThe Art Deco group of fonts pays homage to (surprise!) the art deco era. Bauhaus was a German art school which was operational in the early 1900s — which shows the artistic influence on these fonts.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nFrontage\n\nBauhaus 93\n\nYasashii\n\nCaslon\n\nGraffiti\n\nThis style evokes a sense of carelessness and extreme style — much like actual Graffiti on the walls of city buildings. As a result, this group can be extremely hard to read, so it’s never used in body copy, but much rather for design purposes.\n\nFonts in this class include:\n\nStreetbrush\n\nAll Over Again\n\nArchiva\n\nGraffiti Classic\n\nGreat fonts make great designs\n\nIn conclusion, with so many fonts, it’s easy to see how you can use them to express different feelings, ideas, and tones. Fonts are a huge part of design, and at WebFX, we have a whole team of web design experts that are all too familiar with fonts and the way they can make or break a website."
