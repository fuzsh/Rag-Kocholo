        "text": "If you own a Miele dishwasher, you’re in luck! Many Miele dishwashers have built-in diagnostic systems which allow your appliance to detect a fault or error, and show this on the door panel display. Each dishwasher model has its own set of digital displays specific to that model. There’s an entire range of different digital displays relating to specific dishwasher models.\n\nWhen you’ve identified the model number of your particular dishwasher, you’ll be able to enter the service mode by following the given instructions in your manufacturer’s manual. As you press the buttons in sequence the system cycle will then run through the possible faults and indicate problems with a fault code, or multiple fault codes.\n\nSo, what are the common Miele dishwasher fault codes? Read on to see the meaning of the letters and numbers showing on the display:\n\nLet’s explore some common Miele dishwasher fault codes\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F11\n\nThis error code indicates a problem with water drainage. It could be due to a clogged filter combination in the cabinet, an obstruction in the drain pump caused by objects, deposits in the drain hose or drainage system, or a kinked drain hose. Clearing any blockages and ensuring proper hose alignment may resolve this issue.\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F12/F13\n\nThese fault codes signify a water intake error. Check if the stopcock, which controls the water supply, is closed. A clogged water inlet filter or a kinked inlet hose can also cause this error. Additionally, if the water pressure is lower than 0.3 bar, it’s recommended to consult an experienced engineer for further assistance.\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F14\n\nThe F14 error code indicates a problem with the heater pressure switch. This switch is responsible for measuring and regulating the water level inside the dishwasher during the heating process. If it malfunctions, the dishwasher may overfill. Seek professional help to diagnose and fix this issue.\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F24\n\nThis error code points to an issue with the heater relay contacts. The relay controls the heating system within the dishwasher. If the contacts are faulty, the water won’t heat properly. Repairing or replacing the relay may be necessary.\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F32\n\nWhen the door lock fails to close properly, the F32 error code appears. This fault may occur if the door is manually closed too quickly. For dishwashers with automatic door closing features, it’s important to ensure that the mechanism is functioning correctly.\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F70\n\nThe F70 code indicates a problem with the float switch, which detects the water level inside the dishwasher. If the float switch is defective, it can trigger the activation of the waterproof system, preventing the dishwasher from operating normally. A trained technician can assess and resolve this issue.\n\nMiele dishwasher fault F78\n\nThis error code relates to a fault in the circulation pump. Potential causes include a disconnection between the electronic components and the circulation pump, a faulty frequency converter electronic device, or abnormal voltage levels affecting the pump’s operation. Expert assistance is recommended to address this fault.\n\nMiele dishwasher troubleshooting\n\nWant to know where the problem is even if you can’t fix it yourself? Look at tips for troubleshooting here:\n\nIntake/drain indicator flashing\n\nIf the intake/drain indicator light is flashing, it signifies an issue with water drainage. Possible causes include a broken impeller on the drain pump, a kinked drain hose, a split-belt drive, or a malfunctioning motor. Additionally, if the dishwasher is connected to a waste disposal unit, food remnants may cause blockages in the drainage pipe. Ensure the water supply is turned on and check the water intake filter for any obstructions.\n\nThe display turns off\n\nIf the dishwasher display turns off, it may be in standby mode to conserve energy. Simply press any button to reactivate the display. However, if the display remains blank and you can hear button sounds, there may be a software fault that requires an update. Contact a professional technician to perform the necessary update.\n\nIf the display is blank and there are audible button sounds this indicates that there is a fault in the software, and an update may be required. You’ll need to arrange a visit from an engineer to carry out this procedure for you.\n\nMiele dishwasher repairs"
