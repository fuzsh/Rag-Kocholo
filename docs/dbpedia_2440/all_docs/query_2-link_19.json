        "text": "I plan on putting up a BST soon, and I wanna get a YYR with some of the money I get. Can anybody give me the lowdown on what the typefaces are like?\n\nI found that the Optima and Futura were the high-performance models out of the group, while the Helvetica and Gotham were your jack-of-all-trades type yoyos. The Comic Sans is a more casual throw and you probably won’t extract a ton of performance out of it compared to the others. The Impact is simply a novelty throw; like a heavy, squared-off ProYo.\n\nI waffled a bit between the Optima and the Helvetica. I ended up going with the Helvetica, maybe embarrassingly, because I prefer the typeface. Also I liked the Comic Sans, but couldn’t stomach owning anything named after that typeface. Helvetica to me also made the most sense in black, but I wanted the green one, which I got. I’m happy with it, it’s my only YYR throw other than the Diffusion. It plays great, but at my skill level it doesn’t stand out vs some others like the MYY YO3 Hertz or the YYF Shutter or Uppercut. “Power” isn’t a term that comes to my mind much when I throw, but the few bi-metals I have seem to be most powerful (at least as far as I understand that term)."
