        "text": "NIGERIA HAS NOT FAILED!\n\nNIGERIA HAS NOT FAILED\n\nI was spreading my washed clothes one afternoon [23-04-2013] when ‘it’ suddenly crossed my mind…\n\nIt’s been repeated on innumerable occasions, through several means; television, radio, newspapers, social networks, bear parlours, collegiate debates, gossip joints etc. that NIGERIA is not only a failing nation, but an already failed and irredeemable one.\n\nIt is said that NIGERIA is a doomed country, a marriage grounded on duress and mistake, a company about to liquidate, a time-bomb waiting to explode. In fact, a particular politician has developed the habit of uttering the view that ‘the ship of the Nigerian state is heading towards {an avoidable} cataract, iceberg and oxbow lakes.’ And, fortunately or unfortunately, that is the view of the majority, excluding, of course, the ‘microscopic few’ who feed off the woes, hunger and misery of the masses.\n\nHowever, putting sentiments aside, and focussing solely on reality; how true can we say this viewpoint is?\n\nI’m sure it is obvious already, from the title of this write-up; that I disagree with the notion, even though I definitely am not part of the parasitic ‘microscopic few’. So what exactly is my thought respecting the issue.\n\nI believe Nigeria is not a failure. But neither can she be labelled a success. I believe just as we cannot call a particular course (or subject, as the case may be) a failure or success, we cannot call ‘Nigeria’ the same.\n\nWhat am I trying to say? Only students fail or succeed. They fail or pass particular courses. And since Nigeria is not a student, {just a subject or ‘a mere geographical expression’ as Chief Obafemi Awolowo once put it} she has neither failed nor succeeded. Thus, the accurate proposition should not be ‘NIGERIA has FAILED’ or ‘NIGERIA is a FAILED STATE’; it ought to be; ‘NIGERIANS have FAILED NIGERIA!’\n\nIn school, we have easy courses {e.g. General studies, use of English etc.} and difficult ones {e.g. advanced mathematics, programming, physics etc.}. If we are to categorise Nigeria into one of these two broad types, she would be a very easy course to pass, easier than English language, easier than religious studies and even easier than ‘nullology’, the study of nothing, if there’s anything such thing. This is so because she has all the resources in the world to make even a dullard pass. Yet, Nigerians have failed her.\n\nThe question to ask now, I guess, is WHY? Why have we failed our fatherland despite her rich and copious mineral resources? Why have we failed our country despite her possessing a more than enough {fresh and youthful} human resources? Why have Nigerians failed Nigeria, even though she is very easy to pass? Why, oh why? Is it that we are that daft? I don’t know. But in a country where hundreds of people die daily in the most despicable ways and yet the number one figure finds it easy to engage in political crusades; a country where little children are being raped, sold, kidnapped and murdered, yet all the parliament thinks of is a raise in allocation; a country where genuine justice is incessantly slaughtered on the altar of cupidity; what else do we expect? It is not that we are too daft to succeed, just that everyone is too busy ‘surviving’ {even if it’s at others detriment}, to care about the greater good. We are too busy salivating for political appointments and governmental contracts to remember that others also deserve a good life; and even a life at all. We are too busy chasing money; fame and comfort that we fail to see the big picture, to be concerned about the verdicts of posterity.\n\nAnd until that changes, we will keep failing this country. We will keep having a ‘carry-over’ of the vicious cycle of corruption and poverty and insecurity.\n\n…\n\nThis article is not aimed at highlighting the many problems bedevilling this country, because we do not just already know them, we, as a matter of fact; sensually perceive them on a daily basis. Again, it is not that I have set out to postulate solutions to these problems, as an ignorance of the way-out of our predicament has never been a problem for us as well; it is the will cum the zeal to follow them through that we lack.\n\nI have only thought it worthwhile to correct the popular, but erroneous notion that Nigeria has failed. No! She hasn’t; because she is inanimate, she is lifeless, and she makes no decisions to determine her well-being or otherwise.\n\nIt is we, Nigerians, that have failed the Nigerian subject.\n\nIt is we, Nigerians, that have failed the Almighty, our teacher.\n\nIt is we who have failed ourselves.\n\nNigeria has not failed; rather she is failed.\n\nRate this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI HOPE TO ALWAYS BE SICK\n\nHOW I WISH …\n\n… TO ALWAYS BE SICK\n\nWalking back home today ‘under’ the scorching heat, with no cash in hand [nor in pocket, nor in the bank], and witnessing a gradual resurrection of my supposedly buried malaria infection, I could not but become philosophical in mood.\n\nI was sick of the level of abject poverty that walks free in my society. Old men without security, struggling to keep a life many without creed would thoughtlessly terminate. Young children who stare at their juniors going to school, and who, rather than go to school too, are forced by their guardians to hawk petty goods for long hours every single day. Fathers [and these days, mothers too] who become speechless or prevaricate whenever their kids ask why they can’t have this or that; why they eat once a day while their neighbours have all they want; why they have to wear the same dress for the same festival, five years in a row, before getting a new sub-standard one. What about the gutters? Rather than prevent flooding; they have become a massive bin system, an abode for flies, tadpoles, and in fact unwanted new-borns.\n\nI was sick of the naivety of our youths. The guys going through any means imaginable to be [not just rich but] filthily and ostentatiously rich, wrongly assuming that’s all there is to life; and then spending all the money, not on education or business ventures, but on drugs and girls. And the girls: thinking so low of themselves and trading their priceless bodily endowment for small, insignificant ephemerons. Both parties trying endlessly to please the other, but doing no more than to ruin their own lives.\n\nI was sick of people dying, dreams quashing and families crumbling; all because some unemployed and confused youths are paid to blow things up for whatever reason. Every year, the frustration keeps increasing. Frustrated youths, both within and without the country, are taken advantage of to frustrate the lives of others. And then, there seems to be no end in sight.\n\nI was sick of the government responsible for all these. Not that it caused it, and neither that it didn’t, but that it failed to arrest them. Politicians who sponsor terrorism just to register fear in the people’s minds and pit them against their opponents. Office holders who steal, in a matter of seconds, what their whole kinsmen and countless progenitors may never exhaust; building mansions in faraway countries, which they may never step in; buying sporty cars as if buying their kids toy cars, and as is they could ride in ten at the same time.\n\nI was sick, and I am still.\n\nHence, how it is that wish to always be sick.\n\nHow I wish my sickness would graduate to become sadness.\n\nHow I wish my sadness would graduate to become resentment.\n\n…and that resentment would, in one way or the other, lead to an insurgence…\n\n…be it peaceful, or otherwise… I don’t care, because no patient is patient enough to care HOW he gets treatment, all he wants is THAT he gets it.\n\nRate this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLEGAL MAXIMS AND THEIR SHORT EXPLANATIONS\n\nLEGAL MAXIMS AND THEIR SHORT EXPLANATIONS\n\nWRITTEN & COMPILED BY: CHARTAVILLE\n\nDOWNLOAD FREE E-BOOK HERE!\n\nACCUSARE NEMO SE DEBET [NISI CORAM DEO]: NO ONE OUGHT TO ACCUSE HIMSELF [EXCEPT TO GOD].\n\nAlso called the ‘right against self-incrimination’.\n\nSimilar to ‘Nemo tenetur seipsum accusare’.\n\nAn accused is fully entitled to plead ‘not guilty’ whatever the facts may be.\n\nA witness may refuse to answer questions on the ground that a reply might incriminate him.\n\nA confession is not admissible unless it is made freely and voluntarily. It must not be induced through promise or threat.\n\nSee R v Lagos, Miranda v Arizona and Mapp v Ohio.\n\nACTA EXTERIORA INDICANT SECRETA INTERIORA: THE OUTWARD ACTS SHOW THE SECRET INTENTIONS.\n\nThis involves the ascertainment of someone’s subjective interest/purpose motivating his/her actions, by considering what the immediate, proximate and reasonably to be anticipated consequences of such actions are and to reason that the person intends to accomplish them.\n\n‘Facta non verba’ – actions speak louder than voice.\n\nACTIO PERSONALIS MORITUR CUM PERSONA: ANY RIGHT OF ACTION DIES WITH THE PERSON.\n\nIt applies to actions in form of ‘ex delicto’. ‘Delict’ meaning wrong/injury done to someone.\n\nIt is a common law rule which states that ‘if an injury were done either to the person or to the property of another for which damages only could be recovered in satisfaction, the action died with the person to whom or by whom the wrong was done.\n\nIn case of injury to the person, if either party dies, no action can be supported either by or against the executors or other representatives.\n\nThus, going by this maxim, it would be better for a motorist to kill rather than merely injure a pedestrian who is unemployed, unmarried, childless and an orphan.\n\nThe relevance of this principle has been substantially removed by statutes which allow a deceased’s estate to pursue the litigation.\n\nIt does not apply to personal action founded on contract.\n\nIt now seems to be generally confined to ‘defamation’.\n\nSee Phillip v Homfray, Ayodele v Ore and Kareem v Wema Bank Ltd.\n\nACTORE NON PROBANTE, ABSOLVITUR REUS: AN ACTION NOT PROVED, ABSOLVES THE GUILTY.\n\nWhen the plaintiff/prosecution does not prove his case, judgment is for the defendant/accused.\n\nThe same principle applies to an appellant if the judges are equally divided in their decisions.\n\nSee Famuroti v Agbeke and Awomuti v Salami.\n\nACTUS DEI NEMINI FACIT INJURIAM: AN ACT OF GOD CAUSES LEGAL INJURY TO NO ONE.\n\n‘The law holds no man responsible for the act of God’ ~Herbert Broom.\n\nThe loss from an injury caused thereby must be borne by the victim.\n\nIt refers to an injury, inevitable as a result of an act of God, which no industry can avoid or policy prevent.\n\nSupposing a storm causes Mr A’s car to land on, thereby damaging Mr B’s house, Mr B cannot claim damages from Mr A.\n\nSee Omotayo v Arbuckie Smith & Co. Ltd.\n\nACTUS NON FACIT REUM, NISI MENS SIT REA: AN ACT DOES NOT MAKE GUILT, UNLESS THE MIND BE GUILTY.\n\nThe intent and the act must both concur to constitute a crime.\n\nSimilar to Nemo cogitationis poenam patitur: No one shall be punished for his thoughts alone.\n\nThe existence of a criminal mind may be negated with the defences of: *Mistake *Accident *Compulsion *Consent *Claim of right.\n\nA lunatic may however be found guilty of crime, but will not be executed and only kept in custody for lack of ‘real’ intent [i.e. mens rea].\n\nSee R v Nasamu, Sweet v Parsely and The State v Adelenwa.\n\nAFFIDAVIT: HE SWORE.\n\nOr ‘FOR HE HAS DECLARED UPON OATH’.\n\nA written sworn statement of fact voluntarily made by an affiant or deponent under an oath/affirmation administered by an authorised person.\n\nWitnessed by a solicitor or a commissioner of oaths.\n\nIt may not be admissible as evidence; must be backed up.\n\nThe content should be only within the knowledge of the affiant.\n\nIf discovered false, with the intent to deceive; may lead to a charge of perjury.\n\nARMA IN ARMATOS SUMERE JURA SINUNT: THE LAW PERMITS THE TAKING UP OF ARMS AGAINST THE ARMED.\n\nThe use of arms is only lawful if it is necessary as a form of self-defence, to prevent or repel the commission of a forcible entry or an atrocious crime.\n\nSee Nwuguru v The State, R v Igwe and The Queen v Jinobu.\n\nAUDI ALTERAM PARTEM: HEAR THE OTHER SIDE.\n\nFirst enacted in the Magna Carta, 1215.\n\nSimilar to ‘AUDITUR ET ALTERA PARS’.\n\nNo person shall be condemned, punished or have any property or legal right compromised by a law court without being heard.\n\nIt includes habeas corpus, right to receive notice of hearing and to be given an opportunity to be represented or heard.\n\nIt is a principle of fair-hearing; that both party shall respond to the evidence against them.\n\nIt is considered a principle of fundamental justice or equity.\n\nThe ancient Greek dramatists considered ‘hear both sides’ as part of ‘common wisdom’.\n\nToday, legal systems differ on whether a person can be convicted in absentia.\n\nEven God, it is said, allowed Adam to make his defence before passing judgment.\n\nSee King v Chancellor, Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works, Fawehinmi v LPD committee per Kayode Eso JSC, R v Chancellor of Cambridge Univerisity, Adedeji v Public Service Commission, Akande v The state, adeigun v A.G. Oyo state and Udemah v Nig. Coal Corp.\n\nCOMMODUM EX INJURIA SUA, NEMO HABERE DEBET: OUT OF HIS OWN WRONG, NO ONE OUGHT TO HAVE ADVANTAGE.\n\nMostly applied in insurance cases whereby the assured inflicts injury on himself, spouse or property to make a fraudulent claim.\n\nSee Lek v Matthews and Cole v Accident Assurance Co. Ltd.\n\nCORPUS DELICTI: BODY OF CRIME.\n\nPlural: ‘Corpora delicti’.\n\nA principle that a crime must have been proven to have occurred before a person can be convicted of committing that crime.\n\nIt is ‘the fact of a crime having been actually committed’ ~Black’s law dictionary.\n\nOut-of-court confession of a defendant is insufficient as evidence.\n\nAn accused cannot be convicted solely upon an accomplice’s testimony.\n\nIf a person disappears and cannot be contacted, a ‘missing person’ case is initiated. A ‘body’ of evidentiary items must be obtained to establish that the missing individual has indeed been murdered.\n\nMisinterpretation: in the case of British serial killer, John George Haigh, he destroyed the bodies of his victims with acid thinking that in the absence of a corpse, murder could not be proven.\n\nDOMUS SUA CINQUE EST TUTISSIMUM REFUGIUM: A MAN’S HOUSE IS HIS SAFEST RETREAT.\n\nThe house of everyone is to him a castle/fortress for his safety, and defence against injury and violence.\n\n“A house” includes a rented house.\n\nIn R v Hussay, the tenant was justified to have shot his landlord who tried to forcibly eject him after a quit-notice.\n\nSee also The Queen v Eyo and R v Ebi.\n\nEX PARTE: FOR ONE PARTY ONLY.\n\nOr ‘OUTSIDE THE AWARENESS OF A PARTY.’\n\nIt refers to the proceedings where one of the parties has not received notice and, therefore is neither present nor represented.\n\nIt is not ex parte, if a notice is received but the person chose not to attend.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions expand it to mean any proceeding that goes undefended.\n\nOne of the parties applies to the court and is awarded without the knowledge of the other party who may be bound or affected by the proceeding/verdict.\n\nEx parte applications often seek‘court injunction’.\n\nIt gives room for injustice.\n\nIt is not common in the adversarial system.\n\nUrgency often leads to it.\n\nThe party present in court must/is expected to present the case fairly.\n\nEX TURPI CAUSE NON ORITUR ACTIO: OUT OF A BASE/DISGRACEFUL/ILLEGAL CAUSE, AN ACTION DOES NOT ARISE.\n\n“No polluted hand shall touch the pure foundation of justice.”\n\n“He who comes to equity, must come with clean hands” [a maxim of equity].\n\nIt means redress shall not be granted to persons involved in an illegal deal.\n\nIllegality in an agreement renders it wholly void of legal effect.\n\nSee Canfailla v Chahin, Stevens v Gourley and Onyiuke v Okeke.\n\nHABEAS CORPUS: MAY YOU HAVE THE BODY.\n\nHabeas: 2nd person singular present subjunctive active of ‘habere’ – to have.\n\nCorpus: accusative singular of ‘corpus’; plural is ‘corpora’.\n\nFully written as ‘habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.’\n\nAlso called ‘the great writ’.\n\nIt is a writ [legal action] that requires a person under arrest to be brought before a judge.\n\nIt ensures that a prisoner can be released from unlawful detention.\n\nThe remedy can be sought by the prisoner and anyone coming to his aid.\n\nIt is addressed to the prison custodian.\n\nOthers, aside the detainee, can write the petition because he might be held ‘incommunicado’.\n\nIt may be suspended due to a ‘national emergency’.\n\nTypes: *Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum.\n\n*Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum (or cum causa).\n\n*Habeas corpus ad prosequendum.\n\n*Habeas corpus ad respondedum.\n\n*Habeas corpus ad testificandum.\n\nINTER ARMA, LEGES SILENT: IN THE MIDST OF ARMS, THE LAW IS SILENT.\n\nFirst written by Cicero in his oration; ‘Pro Milone’, as ‘Silent enim leges inter arma’.\n\n“The laws will thusnot be silent in time of war, but they will speak with a somewhat different voice” ~ChiefJustice William Rehnquist.\n\n“The clatter of arms drowns out the voice of the law” ~Henry David Thoreau.\n\nIt applies between different states, during civil disturbances or a coup d’état.\n\nINTEREST REIPUBLICAE UT SIT FINIS LITIUM: IT CONCERNS THE STATE THAT THERE BE AN END TO LAWSUITS.\n\nOr ‘IT IS FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE THAT A PERIOD BE PUT TO LITIGATION’.\n\nIn effect, the law does not encourage prolonged litigation.\n\nThe wealthy might cause nuisance to the poor if litigation is not restricted.\n\nHence, the court expects the parties to come prepared and present their points of differences as whole and not in bits.\n\nSee Ijale v Leventis Co. Ltd and Agu v Ikwibe.\n\nJUDEX NON REDDIT PLUS QUAM QUOD POTENS IPSE REQUIRIT: A JUDGE DOES NOT GIVE MORE THAN THAT WHICH THE PLAINTIFF ASKS.\n\nIf a plaintiff claims the sum of ₦10 as debt from the defendant, the judge cannot grant more even if evidence reveals it’s actually ₦15.\n\nSee Khawam v Elias and Horizon Ltd v Wasurum.\n\nJUDICIS EST IUS DICERE, NON DARE: THE JUDGE DECLARES (EXISTING) LAW, AND DOES NOT MAKE NEW ONES.\n\nUnder our constitution, the court can only interpret legislations: See Section 4 of CFRN.\n\nSee Abioye v Yakubu.\n\nLEX DILATIONES SEMPER EXHORRET: THE LAW ALWAYS ABHORS DELAYS.\n\n‘Justice delayed is justice denied’ ~William Gladstone.\n\nSee Usikaro v Itsekiri [Land Trustee.]\n\nLEX NON COGIT IMPOSSIBILIA: THE LAW DOES NOT COMPEL THE DOING OF IMPOSSIBILITIES.\n\nThe law which is founded on good sense and reasoning cannot possibly direct that impossible things be done.\n\nSee: ‘nemo tenetur ad impossible’\n\nMANDAMUS: WE ORDER.\n\nA judicial remedy or an order from a superior court to a subordinate court, corporation or public authority to do or not to do some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do or refrain from doing.\n\nTypes: *Alternative *Peremptory *Continuing.\n\nExample: In December 2009, Falana, in a suit against the Attorney General, issued for a writ of mandamus compelling Yar’adua to transmit a written declaration to the Senate President and speaker of House of Representatives empowering Jonathan as Acting President [in line with Section 145 of CFRN].\n\nNEMO DAT QUOD HABET: NO ONE GIVES WHAT HE DOES NOT HAVE.\n\nSometimes called the ‘nemo dat’ rule.\n\nIt states that the purchase of a possession from someone who has no ownership right to it also denies the purchaser any ownership right to it also denies the purchaser any ownership title.\n\nA person who is not the legitimate owner of an item cannot despatch it to another person.\n\nOften stays valid even if the purchaser is not aware.\n\nThere are exceptions, though, which aim to give a degree of protection to bona fide purchasers as well as original owners.\n\nSection 27, Sale of Goods Act: anybody purchasing something without the consent of the legitimate owner only attains the same rights to the item as the dishonest seller.\n\nSection 26(1): a buyer from a non-owner obtains no better title than the seller.\n\nExceptions: *Mercantile agent *Sale by joint-owners *voidable contract *Sale by an unpaid seller *Termination of offer *Quasi-contract.\n\nNEMO DEBET BIS VIXARI PRO UNA ET ENDEM LITIUM: NO ONE OUGHT TO BE TWICE VEXED (SUED) FOR ONE AND THE SAME CAUSE.\n\nSimilar to‘NEMO BIS PUNITUR PRO UNO (EODEM) DELICTO’ – No one should be twice punished for one wrong.\n\nSimilar to the principle of Res judicata; in civil matters.\n\nIt states that nobody should be twice sued or prosecuted upon one and the same set of facts, if there has been a final decision of a competent court.\n\nHowever, an abortive or premature trial can be retried [see Windson v R].\n\nIn Connelly v DPP, the defendant tricked the judge by sending a dozen bottles of champagne with the compliment of the plaintiff, hence winning the case. If realised, the case could be re-tried on the ground of a mistrial.\n\nNEMO DEBET ESSE JUDIX IN PROPRIA CAUSA: NOBODY OUGHT TO BE A JUDGE IN HIS OWN CAUSE.\n\nThis is a principle of natural law.\n\nPopularly known as the rule against ‘bias’ i.e. anything which tends a person to decide a case other than on the basis of evidence.\n\nIt is based on the premise that it is against human psychology to decide a case against himself.\n\nIt accords with the dictum of Lord Hewart C.J. in R v Sussex; ‘Justice should not only be done, but also manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.’\n\nA biased decision is a nullity and is ‘coram non judice’.\n\nMay also be expressed as: *Nemo judex idoneus in propria causa est *Nemo judexin parte sua *Nemo judex in causa sua *In propria causa nemo judex.\n\nThe maxim crystallised in United Breweries Co. v Bath in which the Lord Chancellor (a shareholder in the company) decided in favour of the canal company.\n\nIn Wright v Crump [1790], the Mayor of Hereford, England; claimed title to a local house, arranged with a friend to lease it to him and then the friend brought a legal action for the ejectment of the occupants – Lord Mayor himself found for the claimant. Occupants appealed to the court of King’s Bench and the Mayor was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.\n\nException [doctrine of necessity]: bias would not disqualify an officer if no other person is competent to act in his place e.g. Speaker of a house in impeachment proceedings.\n\nNOLLE PROSEQUI: UNWILLING TO PURSUE.\n\nOr ‘DO NOT PROSECUTE’.\n\nIt is most often used in criminal cases.\n\nIt is called ‘voluntary dismissal’ in civil cases.\n\nSimilar to it is ‘declination of prosecution’.\n\nIts opposite is ‘involuntary dismissal’.\n\nIt is the prosecutor’s decision to voluntarily discontinue criminal charges either before trial or fore a verdict is rendered.\n\nJudges seldom challenge such declarations.\n\nIt is not a guaranteefor the impossibility of a later re-indictment and nor is it a protection against ‘double jeopardy’ as the merits of the case were not adjudicated.\n\nReasons: *Weak or insufficient evidence.\n\n*Doubt as to the guilt of the defendant.\n\n*Death of the accused.\n\nPAR IN PAREM, NO HABET IMPERIUM: AN EQUAL POSSESSES NO POWER OVER AN EQUAL.\n\nAlso called the ‘doctrine of immunity from suit’.\n\nThis is a precept that a state cannot be sued in the courts of a foreign state, along-standing rule of customary international law identified with the personalimmunity of a foreign sovereign from suit.\n\nIt also applies to private individuals acting in their official capacity or representing their state e.g. USA v Guinto.\n\nBut when the public official does act contrary to law and injurious to the plaintiff, he is made accountable e.g. Shauf v Court of Appeals.\n\nPLUS VALET UNUS OCCULATUS TESTIS, QUAM AURITI DECEM: ONE EYE WITNESS IS STRONGER THAN TEN HEARSAYS.\n\nBased on the principle that, at all times, justice must be manifestly seen to have been done.\n\nIn law, ‘hearsay evidence’ is the opposite of ‘direct evidence’.\n\nAlso, any evidence given in the absence of an accused is not admissible against him.\n\nSee R v Samuels and Onwocha v The state.\n\nPRO BONO PUBLICO: FOR THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC.\n\nDone or undertaken for public good without any payment or compensation.\n\nNecessitas publica major est quam privata: public necessity has priority over a private need.\n\nQUI NON IMPROBAT, APPROBAT: HE WHO DOES NOT DISAPPROVE, APPROVES.\n\nHence, a person in authority may be punished for covering a very serious crime known to him/her.\n\nIn English law, ‘MISPRISION’ is an offence which is to conceal a treason/felony.\n\nSee R v Aberg.\n\nQUI PARCIT NOCENTIBUS INNOCENTES PUNIT: HE WHO SPARES THE GUILTY, PUNISHES THE INNOCENT.\n\nFor instance, the letting off of a rapist amounts to an ironical/literary punishment of the victim for her agony, violation of dignity and molestation.\n\nHowever, the sentence of ‘cautioned and discharged’ is deemed a conviction and cannot be equated with sparing the guilty.\n\nQUI PECAT EMBRIUS, LUAT SOBRIUS: HE WHO SINS WHEN DRUNK SHALL BE PUNISHED WHEN SOBER.\n\n…even if a person drunk himself to the state of ‘dementia effectum’ (self-imposed madness), he will be punished for the crime after his sober moment; in common law i.e. before 1920 [introduction of the concept of mens rea].\n\nThe present legal position is that voluntary drunkenness which deprives a person of necessary mens rea cannot ground a criminal conviction.\n\nIf intent is coupled with violent passion, guilt is established as he is presumed to intend the natural consequence of the act.\n\nQUICQUID PLANTATUR SOLO, SOLO CEDIT: WHATEVER IS AFFIXED TO THE SOIL, BECOMES PART OF IT.\n\nIn Onuwaje v Ogbeide, the plaintiff warned the defendant not to enter his land warning that it is his. The defendant went ahead to erecta building on the real estate; and then the plaintiff claimed title to it.\n\nSee also Atanda v Ajani and Tewogbade v Adeolu.\n\nRES JUDICATA: MATTER ALREADY ADJUDGED.\n\nAlso called ‘claim preclusion’.\n\nIt is a legal doctrine meant to bar continued litigation between the same parties.\n\nIt may refer to a case which cannot be appealed because there has been a final judgment.\n\nIt cannot be raised whether in the same court or another.\n\nAims at preventing injustice and a waste of resources.\n\nIt prevents contradictory judgments and multiple recoveries of damages.\n\nRequirements: *Identity in the thing at suit.\n\n*Identity of the cause at suit.\n\n*Identity of the parties to the action.\n\n*Identity in the designation of the parties involved.\n\n*Whether the judgment was final.\n\n*Whether the parties were given fair-hearing.\n\nIt includes two related concepts: *claim preclusion *issue preclusion or collateral estoppel.\n\nIt may be ignored if there is a deficiency in due process in the adjudged case.\n\nSee Agu v Ikewide, Iyayi v Eyiegbe and Odjevwaje v Echanokpe.\n\nSUB POENA: UNDER PUNISHMENT.\n\nA writ by a government agency (court) compelling testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure.\n\nThe English term, ‘witness summons’ is used in England and Wales.\n\nJohn Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury, createdthe writ.\n\nSubpoenas are usually issued by the clerk of the court in the presiding judge’s name.\n\nTypes: *Subpoena ad testificandum: orders a person to testify before court or face punishment, in person or by phone.\n\n*Subpoena doces tecum: orders a person to bring physical evidence before the court or face punishment.\n\nVOLENTI NON FIT INJURIA: THAT TO WHICH A MAN CONSENTS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN INJURY.\n\nExpressly or impliedly assenting to an act makes it not to be actionable as a tort.\n\nIn another sense, no one can enforce a legal right which he has voluntarily waived/abandoned.\n\nThat party must have known of his legal rights and either by express language or sufficient overt act, tells the other party that he is not insisting on it (or them).\n\nSee Herd v Weardale Co. and Odua’s investment Co.

It also encompasses pieces of information which the author deems necessary and fit for public consumption.\n\nWhat do you do: we use our publications to enlighten and re-orient our readership, not forgetting to entertain them in the process. Edutainment is our watchword.\n\nWho are your readers: they range from students to poets, from professionals who need source materials, to anyone who simply enjoys a good write-up.\n\nWhat’s the greatest thing about your blog: though ‘the prodigy’s ratiocinations’ may not yet be popular, it has contributed one way or the other to the society. It gives me a perfect medium to showcase my abilities, share my views and right social wrongs in the little way I can. It is to me, a boon companion. That, I believe, is just awesome.\n\nWhy is it better than other blogs: it is better than many other blogs due to its originality and the universal applicability of some of its contents.\n\nHow’d you come up with the name for your blog: it resulted from the deep musings and ratiocinations of a prodigy, a would-be legend.\n\nWhat was your first blogging experience: I have none prior to the time I created ‘the prodigy’s ratiocinations’.\n\nHow did you first get into the world of blogging: this was through the WordPress android app. I downloaded. After creating the blog, I have had no regrets.\n\nWhat time do you usually start blogging: whenever I find convenient. No fixed time.\n\nHow many hours a day do you usually blog: for now, at most, between 3 and 4 hours.\n\nWhat major problems is your blog coming to address: the problems of ignorance and disorientation in whatever field; grammatical, political, religious, legal, social and so on.\n\nWhen do your best ideas come to you? In bed in the morning? During dinner? On your third beer? Or?: I could be trekking, eating, reading news, about to sleep, praying, just about any time.\n\nA lot of people have big ideas. What gave you the courage to go after yours: a picture of the near-future, the desire to be heard and appreciated.\n\nWhen’s the last time you went on vacation and where did you go to: some months back, Lagos.\n\nRemember the early days of starting up? Describe the struggles you went through: lack of a personal computer was a major challenge, coupled with a limited access to the internet.\n\nHow do you handle frustration: I take a time-off, and do something pleasurable (like sleep, eat, go on a trekking spree or game) to relax.\n\nWhat has been your biggest professional frustration: working hard to get something published, only for it not to be read (as expected). Not too big a deal though.\n\nWhat’s your blogging environment like: just like ‘home’, no strict deadlines, no explicit restrictions, just having fun and making impact.\n\nDo you listen to music: not as the average person does, very minimal and rare.\n\nWatch movies: not frequent, but I enjoy watching good intellectual and mind-boggling movies.\n\nPlay video games: not that frequently too. I only do on a few occasions using my PC.\n\nHow do you picture your blog in 5 years: I see it as a leading blog for getting beneficial, life-changing information; a blog which government visits for guidance in decision-making.\n\nWho or what inspires you: my readers and their inspiring comments.\n\nRole models: Malcolm X, Gani Fawehinmi.\n\nQuotes: ‘speak clearly if you speak at all, carve every word before you let it fall’ (Oliver Wendell Holmes), ‘all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing’ (Edmund Burke), ‘a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a step’ (Lao Tzu).\n\nVideo games: PES 2011, Unreal Tournament, Mortal kombat.\n\nSnack food: mince pie, doughnut, sausage roll.\n\nHow’d you currently make money off your blog: I had not given monetising my blog a serious thought until ‘Cambiar blogs’ gave me a call. Hopefully, I won’t be disappointed.\n\nWhat other advice do you have for other wanna-be bloggers struggling to get started: make originality, diligence and steadfastness your slogans.\n\nWhat would you do if you had a year off and 50,000,000 to spend (on something other than blogging): I would invest judiciously in ICT, agriculture and import/export business.\n\nDo you consider yourself a successful blogger? If not, what will make you feel successful: I do not yet consider myself successful at blogging, and having this feeling will naturally be a function of how much impact I’m able to make, and how much I’m able to gain as well through blogging.\n\nTop 5 websites you couldn’t live without and why: Nairaland.com, Facebook.com, Naijawriterscoach.com, WordPress.com, ipage.com. They all assist me in getting and sharing virtual information, quickly and easily.\n\nWhat is your music genre of choice: if I were to be a music enthusiast, then I would have much preference for ‘blues’.\n\nNumber 1 country you’ve always wanted to visit but haven’t yet? And why that country: there is no country in particular, I wish to be able to travel across the globe with ease one day. However, I hope I would be able to gain a scholarship to study in Harvard University (U.S) for my PhD programme.\n\nThree people (other than you) we should follow on Twitter or BBM and why: @OxygenMat, @naijacontests, @aminugamawa. They keep me informed on happenings in the world of writing, and socio-politics.\n\nRate this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPRESS RELEASE: WE JUST JOINED CAMBIAR BLOGS\n\nContinue reading →\n\nRate this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI KNOW MY COUNTRY\n\nI KNOW MY COUNTRY.\n\nEntry for the 100-word TGIC Centenary essay contest.\n\nImagine a tall Iroko tree, cut away from its roots. It, inevitably, shall collapse, wither and die. Imagine the Nile without its source, the Kagera River. It loses its glory. Now imagine a man isolated in thought from his place of birth. What a pitiable spectacle, he is.\n\nNationality is but an eleven-letter word if it does not entail appreciation of one’s environment, acknowledgment of one’s birthplace and a familiarity with essential traits of our home.\n\nChief Obafemi Awolowo said that no matter how tall a tree is it cannot forget its roots.

Nothing but the mere fact that he believes in the Gospel of Christ and practises it to the letter. What makes a philosopher a true one other than the fact that he believes in the significance of truth, rational thinking and he acts in accordance with his deductions? So what makes a Nigerian a true one? The answer is simple: belief and practice.\n\nI am a true Nigerian! Why? Because I belief in the unity, I belief in the struggle, I belief in the great future of this land. I am equally working tirelessly to make sure that my dream for Nigeria comes to light.

A time when adultery will be committed openly and with impunity[3]. A time of chaos, when normality will become abnormal, when good deeds will be frowned at and evils rewarded. A time, of ‘immoralities and degrading tendencies.’ Sad to say that that time is here. It is staring us in the face, poking its filth into our lives and it has, in fact, managed to gain our acquiescence.\n\nThese days, a lot of upsetting spectacles meet my eyes that I fear they will sink in, in shame and disgust. No day passes without one being greeted with depressing news reports. If it is not of a man getting married to a dog[4] or of a union of prostitutes fighting for their right to operate openly[5], it will be of ‘men’ of God and school principals defiling children young enough to pass as their grandkids[6]. The situation, no doubt, is not just getting out of hand; it has already got out of hand. However, is it so bad to have gone beyond redemption? To this, I reply again with the words of Prophet Muhammad: ‘there is no disease that Allah has created, except that He also has created its treatment.’ [7] Thus, for every problem, no matter how seemingly gigantic, there is a solution. So what is the solution to this pressing problem? How may we curb the immoralities that have enveloped our society?\n\nAllah says in the Qur’an; ‘surely Allah does not change a people’s lot unless they change what is in their hearts’[8]. This verse is similar to the age-old saying that ‘heaven helps those who help themselves’, and it goes to show the importance of self-evaluation and individual development to societal reformation. And like a Greek philosopher [9] once said; ‘the city is what it is because our citizens are what they are.’ In other words, the change has to start from every individual, if we are ever going to get anywhere. We all need to collectively resolve to know what is evil, shun it and return to the will of our Lord.\n\nIn addition to this, the family also has a key role to play in this movement. It is widely acknowledged among scholars that the first agent of socialisation is the family. Whether a child will grow up to be an ‘Abu Bakr’ or an ‘Abu Lahab’ is primarily a function of his/her background. Today, the family system has become a shadow of its former self. We are in a world where fathers are busy 24 hours with sustaining the family. And mothers, whose duty it is to look after the home, are even busier than the family head. We are in a world where the closest companion of the young ones is not the chest of their mothers but that of teddy bears. We are in a world where majority of what children learn is got from social networks. In such a world, how can immorality not skyrocket beyond our control? Hence, we will achieve nothing unless we restore the efficacy of the family.\n\nFinally, it is the case that all other establishments can merely recommend what is appropriate; only the government of the day that can enforce it. It only, can legitimately penalise what is wrong and harmonise legality with morality. If after all is said and done and we still have persons who contravene the common ethical code of the society, then the corrective hand of the law is needed to restore balance, effect justice and eradicate corruption from the land.\n\nI wish to conclude by citing the flawless words of Allah (SWT) in the Holy Qur’an where He says: ‘Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah[10].’ Therefore, each and every one of us must take it as our responsibility to do good, enjoin good and forbid evil. We must all strive to put an end to the immoralities and degrading tendencies in our society, lest they be the one to put an end to us.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1. Sahih Muslim, Book 41, Number 6903.\n\n2.
