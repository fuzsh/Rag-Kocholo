Crowned with a pristine, steel-reinforced, modernist skylight that spans a quarter of the ceiling, brightness streams down. Clouds pass by. Skyscrapers tower as silent next-door neighbors, vanishing upward. Inside that space, another illumination of sorts takes place. A fifteenth-century printing technology is alive, and being introduced to twenty-first-century students. This is the School of the Art Institute of Chicago’s (SAIC) Letterpress Studio, under the auspices of the Visual Communication Design Department. Professing an interdisciplinary curriculum, students from a myriad of departments walk through this door: print media, sculpture, ceramics, fiber and material studies, painting and drawing, performance, architecture, interior design and designed objects, writing, photography, film, video, new media and animation, visual and critical studies, and, of course, visual communication design. What brings them here? Young adults who have grown up with microchips, Google, and pull-down font menus are often unaware they can be simultaneously drawn to lead, tin, antimony, and copper. At first glance, it might seem contrary to the speed-of-light attention spans they have perfected, to stand at a type cabinet and plink, plink, plink one character at a time into a composing stick. But very quickly they recognize it as a welcome antithesis, deepening their spectrum of concentration. Semester after semester, we have a full house. Three sections of a dozen students each, all yearning for something.\n\n(Opposite) The two windows of the SAIC Type Shop. Photo by John Dunlevy.\n\nThe Allure We ask them that question on the first day. And the answers are remarkably similar. Some come, bored and alienated with the digital environment. They long for an activity that slows the blind pace of auto-spacing and default kerning, and demands a rhythmic unity of mind and hand. In a more palpable sense, they want all of their senses to be engaged. Not just eyes reading a screen, but fingers touching and choosing an em space or an en space or a 3-tothe-em space. They want to pull a spatula through a viscous dollop of ink and watch it stream from the blade in a slow, molasseslike dance. The scent of a Type Shop is unmistakable and indelible. Bicep-building type-case lifting will be their calisthenics for the next 16 weeks. Working and studying in a Type Shop is a whole body experience, not for the lethargic or faint of heart.\n\nChapter 1: The Sensual, Printed Artifact\n\n9\n\n(Top) The skylight. Photo by John Dunlevy. (Bottom) Entry to Type Shop. Photo by John Dunlevy.\n\n10\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nUndoubtedly there is an innate human attraction to letterpress. We could go so far as to say “seduction” even. “Love at first glance.” Seeing the sculptural depth that a well-printed piece displays is enough to “take one’s breath away.” Turning the piece over and running one’s finger across the line of impression penetrates the skin as well as the eye, the mind, and the heart. There is little pleasure greater than the satisfaction gleaned from the humble punch of metal into paper. Other students come, wanting to learn the basics of typography via a hands-on approach. Mystified by a vocabulary that they use daily, a vocabulary they do not know the origins of, posits a doubt in their mind. They sense that they should know something, but they aren’t sure what. Why is it called leading? Why is a typical paragraph indentation considered an “em” space? “Really now, do you think you can teach my eye to discern the difference a hair space makes in kerning two characters?” Holding a ligature in one hand and both individual characters in the other might be the first time they touch—and thus understand—the improved aesthetic spacing. They witness the clarity of the sculpture in their hand, and “see” with their fingertips as well as their eyes. There is a historical enticement as well. These students join hundreds before them, each a link in a chain that stretches back more than 500 years. Extending beyond Aldus Manutius to Johannes Gutenberg in the Western world, and even farther in the Eastern, these distant relatives will become closer and more familiar as they touch an italic or gaze at a page of the 42-line Bible. And each time they dip their hand into a California case, they withdraw the same type that veteran compositors—both commercial and hobbyists— have used before them. What will they spell out with the same font used by R.R. Donnelley and Sons, a time-honored Chicago printing company? Or with the type that won Sherwin Beach Press international recognition in the Ninth Biennial Carl Hertzog Book Design Award Competition? Even just caressing the old lead characters retrieved from the garage of an 89-year-old World War II pilot can conjure up inspirational images. Every book tells a story, but every California case has many, many stories to tell. Some students come through our doors searching for a means of incorporating image and text. They might have been working with both in their studio practice, or even just one, and have come to a point where a more unified bonding of the two is necessary to lift their work to a higher level. Writers enter seeking a way to visually present their words in a more physically aesthetic manner.\n\nChapter 1: The Sensual, Printed Artifact\n\n11\n\n(Opposite top) Sherwin Beach Press, Ballet for Opening Day.

(continued on next page)\n\n12\n\nBookbinders, proficient with structural formats, come seeking the means to place content on those pages. Printmakers, tired of straining to write backwards on intaglio plates and litho stones, embrace the forward movement of job stick composition. The resurgence of the media of letterpress over the past few decades has also fueled our enrollment ranks. Curiosity about how these cast iron presses can transfer the delicacy of a hairline serif onto paper gets the better of them. The spectacle of their friend hauling a 1 ½ ton hulk of metal into his basement demands explanation. Even the thrill of winning an eBay auction for a vintage printer’s cut will require a “proof,” and once ink is under their fingernails, they are smitten. Other faculty members speak of it as a “good elective” for artists and designers. Each semester, as a recruitment device, we host visits or short workshops for their students to become acquainted with the Shop. Of course we publicize across the campus with handprinted flyers that are literally ripped down within hours of their posting. Some converts are gleaned from reviewing class evaluations at the Office of Student Affairs, but word of mouth—from student to student—is a faster channel of information. Certainly some just come because they heard “it was fun.” And indeed it is.\n\nThe Passion Once inside the Type Shop, students see a carefully organized studio, replete with vintage as well as contemporary equipment. Just as importantly, they are introduced to instructors and teaching assistants convinced of the relevance of this media to their educational experience and the development of their artistic vision. It is no easy task to campaign for space, budget, and curriculum inclusion in an academic culture strapped for floor space, suffering from a tight economy, and wary of increasing the requisite number of credits a student must take to graduate. Tuition dollars most often dictate career pertinence and high-profile visibility. Letterpress has waxed and waned within societal, commercial, and academic contexts. Persistence and persuasion have proven to be an indomitable strategy in our efforts to keep 15 ½ tons of metal actively engaged within the hands of our students. Conveying the applicability of letterpress to other departments and enlisting them as allies has proven invaluable. And a supportive administration has been indispensable. But most essential is the passion modeled by the individuals who work in the Type Shop every day. This begins with instructors who love the media and love to teach it. It continues with teaching assistants and intermediate and advanced students who have\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nFoldout map of the lake printed on kozo paper, and thirty “text figures” of fish were printed from the original electrotypes used in the 1920 publication Fishes and Fish-Like Vertebrates of Minnesota.

They simply “feel it in their bones” that they need to continue to be there, exploring more thoroughly all that it has to offer and sharing those discoveries with beginners. As for me, I love letterpress because I love books. My father, a man of few (spoken) words, read voraciously. As a child, I remember his bookshelves in the living room, filled with leather-bound tomes, gilt edges, a satin ribbon trailing down each spine. Dad refused to paste a bookplate between the covers, or place a book back on the shelf, until he had read through to the last page. The action of pasting the bookplate was a tacit agreement with that book that his hand had touched every page, his mind had considered every thought, and now it was time for the next individual to delight in what was between its covers. Many of those cherished books now stand on my bookshelf. I love letterpress because I love language. Typography is the vivification of language. Letterforms and alphabets can speak of Shakespearean sonnets or nursery rhymes. When my daughters were first straining to scratch out their ABCs with pencils in their tiny hands, I was overwhelmed with the beauty and consequence of their attempts. One of my favorite broadsides resulted from that moment of tender acquisition in their lives. I love the materiality of holding a character in my hand and assembling a row of “lead soldiers.”1 Tying up forms and tucking them into the galley until it is nearly too heavy to lift. The smell of ink. The pristine field of paper about to be kissed by an arabesque of a Garamond swash. Leafing through a stack of freshly printed pages in an edition is as thrilling as a child “unwrapping” Christmas morning. I love how it engages all of me. Eyes delighting in exact kerning. Fingertips sensing the perfect punch. Hands sliding a sumptuous sheet precisely under the grippers. Feet stepping in parallel cadence with the carriage as it rolls across the bed. Ears tuned to the click/ clack of the cylinder, a rhythmic heartbeat, synchronized with mine. They say printer’s ink gets in one’s veins. This is not a health and safety warning. Printing has a way of reaching deep inside and touching that innate human urge to “make” marks and “leave” one’s mark. The Lascaux cave paintings attest to the former. Stonecarved epitaphs attest to the latter. If, as Horace says, “the written word remains,”2 I believe there will always be printers who want to commit that word to paper. It is this historical legacy that I feel connected to in the studio, a process that was fundamental to the cultural evolution of the world. In a humbler context, it speaks to what I love best: sharing ideas. Most undergraduate students now have lived with computers all of their lives. For them to have the experience of creating a book Chapter 1: The Sensual, Printed Artifact\n\n(Opposite top left) Hand on feedboard. Photo by John Dunlevy.

So much in the world today is not . . . I am also a believer that newer is not always better, faster is not deeper, and that process is as important as product. Letterpress addresses each of these concerns in different, and incredibly rich, ways. I also feel passionately about our collective need to slow, to breathe, and, as creative people, to work with processes that do not require any other electricity than that provided by our bodies.” —Amara Hark-Weber, SAIC Teaching Assistant\n\n15\n\nfrom concept to layout to production, with lead type, paper, ink, thread, book cloth, and glue, engenders a level of ownership and engagement that is rarely attainable elsewhere. Every aspect is a choice they make. Every decision is the result of a series of actions that rely upon one another, build upon one another. Guiding them in their plans, watching them problem-solve and troubleshoot, dialoguing every step of the way is where my love of furthering this media comes in. Teaching letterpress celebrates literacy, history, creativity, and the sensual artifact. Inherent in this pedagogy is a dynamic reciprocity. As instructors, we are communicating our expertise, challenging our students to think critically and imaginatively. But the act of learning continues to occur within us as well. Each time I am asked a probing question to which I do not know the answer, I am compelled to do research. And I am energized by the acumen of the student. In conversing with them one-on-one, we often excavate a concept that stimulates me to create a book. Composing each semester’s new syllabus, I am insistent upon developing improved projects, incorporating more historical references, and initiating more interactivity with contemporary processes. Could it be that the allure of letterpress and the passion for its practice reaches even deeper than we imagine? Could it permeate our subconscious? After Martha had taken her first semester of letterpress with me, she did not register for it the following semester. One night, well into that next semester, she had a dream. She was standing in the Type Shop, surrounded by type cabinets and printing presses. I was there, in the Shop in her dream, and asked her why she hadn’t come back. At that moment, she realized, this is what she was meant to be doing. Could it be encoded in our DNA? As a toddler, each time Martha visited her grandfather, a photo-engraver by trade, instead of playing with Lincoln Logs or Lego, she pulled out a box of wood furniture that he kept under his chair, building structures that children and printers alike would love. Two decades ago, I had been making frequent trips to retrieve donated type for the school, each time packing up my twin daughters in our van and squeezing type cases in between them and behind them. Once, when they were not quite four, I carefully placed a drawer of Palatino swash capitals on top of the pile of cases in the back. Sarah peeked over the seat, reached her hand into the case, picked up a letter, and exclaimed: “Oh Momma, what a beautiful font!” “It sure is!” I replied. And we headed home, treasure in tow.\n\n16\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nNotes 1 “Give me 26 lead soldiers and I will conquer the world” is often attributed to Benjamin Franklin, but also Karl Marx, as well as an unknown French printer; http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/05/with-twenty-five-soldiers-of-lead-he .html 2 Stone, Jon R.

By the time of his death in 1947, Goudy had designed 123 typefaces, establishing himself as one of the best-known and most prolific type designers.5 Oswald Cooper, a printer’s devil in Kansas at age 17, moved to Chicago and studied lettering with Frederic Goudy.6 In 1918, his Cooper Old Style, designed for Barnhart Brothers & Spindler (BB&S),7 a well-known Chicago type foundry, became the first typeface with rounded serifs.8 His Cooper Black, “the boldest, blackest face ever to be released in type,”9 designed in 1922, was “one of the most popular faces used in advertising during that period.”10 After the American Type Founders’ (ATF) takeover of BB&S in 1929, Cooper drew the basis of Boul Mich (named for Chicago’s Michigan Boulevard).11 In 1939 he dedicated time toward developing the corporate identity for the Chicago Daily News newspaper.12 Robert Hunter Middleton studied letterforms and type design under Ernst Detterer at the Art Institute of Chicago in the 1920s, just as Detterer was implementing a new curriculum in the Printing and Typographic Arts Department.13 During his 49-year career at Chicago’s Ludlow Typograph Company, Middleton created one of America’s most respected type libraries, designing almost 100 of the faces in the library himself.14 Middleton was also influential in the revival of interest in the work of Thomas Bewick (1753–1828), the celebrated English wood engraver, whose work he printed at his Cherryburn Press in the city.15 Acquainting our students with these Chicago-based typographic luminaries instills considerable local pride, and positions them to understand the legacy Chicago has contributed to printing history. We encourage instructors and students everywhere to investigate the rich typographic history their location affords. Examining a character from Goudy Old Style or Cooper Black or Coronet, type designs from each of the aforementioned men respectively, students begin to comprehend precisely what Goudy himself expressed: “Each face has a spirit of its own. New types express the tempo of the times.”16 Of course, we hope this appreciation extends to our entire inventory. To facilitate that, index cards, with each font’s designer, original foundry, and date, are placed in many of the California cases, providing a mini history lesson to each student who opens that case.\n\nChapter 2: The Historical Legacy: Connecting the Past and Future\n\n(Left) Cathie Ruggie Saunders, Curator, Littera Scripta Manet: The Written Word Remains.

Photo by John Dunlevy.\n\n“At 40, this short, plump, pinkish and puckish gentleman (Frederic Goudy) kept books for a Chicago realtor, and considered himself a failure. During the next 36 years, starting almost from scratch at an age when most men are permanently set in their chosen vocations, he cut 113 fonts of type, thereby creating more usable faces than did the seven greatest inventors of type and books, from Gutenberg to Garamond.” —Andrew R. Boone17\n\n19\n\n20\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nProject assignments also strive to instill knowledge of and respect for printing history far beyond the geographic location of Chicago. For many years now, each semester students are asked to create a double-sided, digitally printed card about an event, invention, or individual associated with worldwide printing history and its related fields. The card is to be designed “in the spirit of the times,” with the date prominently displayed on the front, resources cited on the back. Each card is then chronologically filed in an elegant box (handmade by a former teaching assistant), which serves as an archival timeline both significant and commonplace. Examples from our registry include the establishment of the Fabriano Paper Mill in Italy (1264),18 the first printed book in the English language (William Caxton in 1473),19 the first woman with a significantly known printing career, Charlotte Guillard of France (1502–1557),20 and the first printing press founded in North America (Mexico, 1539).21 The Archive is available in the Shop for students to study, and we are planning an exhibition of it: cards posted in a timeline format stretching around the walls of a gallery space. A student’s first semester in letterpress will include a project introducing them to two major historical design aesthetics: the classical and the modernist page layout. By setting and printing paired words, students learn to compose both centered and asymmetric layouts, understand the respective Roman and sans serif font use, and strive to relate the definition of each word to its appropriate format presentation. During critique, they are often awed by the powerful eloquence of a single word printed on a page. This project serves as an excellent means of conveying the expressiveness of negative space, and the necessity to evaluate exactly what needs to be printed and what does not. From this single sheet foundation, students carry these lessons on to their bookmaking projects throughout the remainder of the semester. (Refer to Chapter 10 for more information on this first project.) By extending learning outside the studio and viewing the abundant letterpress resources that the Chicago Public Library/Harold Washington Center, the Newberry Library, and the Art Institute of Chicago have in their collections, students see original printed examples. These artifacts imbue the viewer with insights about historical context, technical proficiency, and design aesthetics in a manner more impressive than any PowerPoint presentation. With gloved hands, they touch a page from the Gutenberg Bible, and peering sideways can discern the superlative imposition of that first piece of incunabula. The arts and crafts movement’s emphasis on the handmade nature of the entire book object takes on utter clarity when a student\n\nChapter 2: The Historical Legacy: Connecting the Past and Future\n\n(Opposite top) The Essence of Beeing, written by Michael Lenehan.

Here they can measure its intimate proportions with the palm of their hand; hear the crackle of the deckled handmade sheet as they turn a page; see the printed blackness of the handcast type and the beauty of the Golden Section spanning an open spread. How more apparent and evocative can these typographic and design attributes become? What greater incentive might there be to research William Morris than to physically encounter one of his sensual printed artifacts? The current living generation of printing luminaries is part of the legacy we strive to honor and learn from as well. Muriel Underwood, an individual with the foresight to help establish a letterpress workshop in 1952 for the membership of the Society of Typographic Arts, continues to visit and print with the equipment that became our current shop’s seminal donation.25 The wealth of stories she has shared with our students, and the behavior she modeled—still setting type and printing at 89 years of age—is inspirational. If the United States had a similar tradition as Japan’s designation of deserving elders as “national living treasures,” Muriel would earn our vote. Camaraderie and generosity are hallmarks of letterpress printers. Individuals who have been printers most of their lives have such an affection for the media, they often will quote an inexpensive price (or free!) for their used equipment just to see that it goes into the hands of a younger generation, willing to continue the practice. This is an excellent means by which serious students can begin acquiring equipment to set up their own shops. Schools that teach letterpress are grateful recipients of donations. Equipment or type that comes our way is listed by donor in our inventory of faces and marked with a hand-printed label announcing its provenance. Movable type, by definition, was a “recycling” innovation vastly more efficient than wood block-books. Previously owned movable type confers another dimension upon that recycling concept. Young printers of today are re-using type from yesterday, creating books for the future. Libraries that have special collections are recognizing this and are adding both fine press and innovative artists’ books to their holdings. Among the more than 10,000 artists’ books, periodicals, zines, and multiples in the Joan Flasch Artists’ Book Collection in the SAIC Flaxman Library is a nascent collection of SAIC student work. Awareness of the past informs the present. Appreciation of the past confers a responsibility upon the present to ensure this media’s longevity into the future. With the accelerated momentum of digital printing technology, the continued vitality of letterpress relies upon\n\nChapter 2: The Historical Legacy: Connecting the Past and Future\n\nRobert H. Middleton was dedicated to improving the industry in which he worked. He co-founded the Society of Typography Arts in Chicago in 1927 and was involved in establishing the Institute of Design (the New Bauhaus) in Chicago in 1937. He was also a member of the 27 Chicago designers, organized in 1934, and he was a member of the Caxton Club for 40 years.23 Middleton was among the first American members of the Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) founded in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1957, which was one of the first proponents of typeface design protection.24\n\nFifteen years ago we accepted a donation from the daughter of a printer who had passed away. It is a beautiful collection of vintage type, carefully and obviously lovingly documented with the name of each typeface, foundry, and even purchase price. I kept these records and eight years ago, a young woman walked into the Type Shop and introduced herself as that printer’s granddaughter. She remembered working with him in his basement shop as a child and wanted to see where his equipment had gone. I could show her every­ thing. Interestingly, she is a professional designer herself. She emailed her entire family with pride: she had seen how Grandpa’s type is still alive, in the hands of a new generation of student printers.\n\n23\n\n(Top) Muriel Underwood next to her Sigwalt press.

Preliminary font choices, tentative layouts, and color trials are frequently done on laptops, side by side with Vandercooks and Chandler & Price presses in the Type Shop. Students consult search engines as their book concepts multiply, and research is done immediately, without breaking stride to walk to the library. Adobe Illustrator is at home here, as is the old-fashioned method of bending leading to shape a curved type form. Running out of type to set a page? Budget-conscious solution: print, distribute, and set again. Time at a premium? Set it digitally and have a plate made. Or even faster, send your digital file to the laser cutter and make a relief matrix yourself. Color choice for ink? You will get a better lesson in color theory by opening ink cans and making draw downs than clicking on a drop-down color menu. How does Hosho paper respond to the pressure of letterpress?

As we begin, we walk around the shop, showing and naming the many tools and materials they will be working with during their time there. Galleys, galley cabinets, type cabinets, type cases, type, composing sticks, pica rulers, spacing, leading. These are the terms they need to start. After the discussion of shop rules and the shop tour, we begin the discussion of type and the type case; what is type-high, what are points, picas, what are the parts of type: nick, face, body. Type from ATF, or from Acme in Chicago, or a slug cast on a Ludlow by a Chicago job printer, represents a portion of the history of printing and type design. Letterpress was a highly sophisticated analog technology that was made obsolete for almost all of commercial printing after about 1980. However, the commercial industry’s loss became individual printers’ and art schools’ gain.\n\nTerminology and Measurement By necessity, the beginner must learn in increments. A student can’t learn all of the terms she will need to know on the first day. But by repeated exposure to the correct terminology, the beginner will eventually become familiar with the words and use them with ease. Points and picas are the units of measurement used in the Type Shop. There are approximately 6 picas per inch, and 12 points per pica. A metal line gauge, marked with inches, picas, and points, is the printer’s ruler.\n\nLay of the Case A large number of different type case layouts have been used since Gutenberg, but the California job case is the most commonly used layout in the United States. One California case is designed to hold one size of one typeface (for example, 12-point Bodoni Book). The full-size California case began production in the 1870s.1 The major innovation of the California case is that it combined upper- and lowercase letters with punctuation and numerals into one case. Before the California case, upper- and lowercase letters were in two separate cases, one placed above the other, hence the terms “upper” and “lower” case. In the California case, the caps are arranged in the right third of the case in alphabetical order, except the J and the U, which come after the Z. Although the J and U were added to the Roman alphabet before the invention of the California case, the order of the caps was never changed. Chapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n(Opposite) Type cabinet with leading rack and a full-size California Case. Photo by John Dunlevy.\n\nThe Point System In 1874, John Marder of Marder, Luse & Co. Type Foundry in Chicago persuaded inventor and printer Nelson C. Hawks to go to San Francisco to establish a branch. Marder also asked Hawks to become a partner. At the time, type sizes from different manufacturers almost never matched each other; they each had their own proprietary way of sizing their types. Because of the non-interchangeable type sizes, spacing especially was a challenge. Can you imagine having separate spacing for each brand of type you own, for every size? It was great for the type foundries, since it encouraged brand loyalty. For the printer, it was a problem. Hawks seriously considered the need for uniform type bodies. When Marder visited Hawks in San Francisco for the first time in 1877, Hawks convinced him of the viability of the new system of type bodies. But there had to be a change to Hawks’ original system. The size of the (continued on next page)\n\n31\n\npica was still in question. The pica used by Hawks (and a minority of type founders) was exactly ⅙ of an inch. It embodied a mathematical elegance that was not to be, because the most popular pica in use at the time (there were two), put in place by MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan Type Foundry, did not correspond exactly to the inch. It was .1660 inch and was named the “Johnson Pica.” Mr. Johnson came up with the eponymous pica early on in the foundry’s history, and it subsequently came into widespread usage. Ultimately, the most popular pica, not the best pica, was the one put into use. The marketing power of MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan was stronger than that of Marder, Luse & Company. Still, the newly adopted pica was an improvement over the old system. As foundries adopted standardized sizes, types from different manufacturers could be set together in 1879 for the first time with ease.5\n\nMnemonic Devices for Learning the Layout of the California Case b, c, d, e, i, s, f, g be careful driving elephants into small ford garages l, m, n, h, o, y, p, w , let me now help out your punctuation with commas v, u, t, a, r villains usually take a ride6\n\n32\n\nYou might wonder, why not put the caps in alphabetical order now? The J and the U were added to the Roman alphabet generations ago. Perhaps it is the time investment required in changing an entire print shop of cases, sometimes hundreds, which prevents printers from doing so.2 On the left side and center, lowercase letters and punctuation are placed. Each letter, capital or lowercase, is kept in differing sized compartments based on their frequency of use. Since the letter “e” is used the most, it receives the largest compartment, which descend in size from there. Typeset by hand from a case was the primary method of preparing texts for printing from Gutenberg until the late 1800s, when the invention of the Linotype and the Monotype superseded it. Because of this, there are many different case layouts. Every language with a written system needed an organizational system for its case. Chinese, for example, is especially difficult to set by hand in metal type.3 One alternate case layout currently in our Type Shop is the ⅔ case. It is smaller than the California case, and has two sections in it instead of the three of a full-size California case. The section holding the lowercase letters is the same as in a full-size case, while the caps are arranged behind them at the back of the case. Another case layout that we have is for typefaces with capital letters only. All-capital typefaces are often kept in double, triple, or quadruple caps cases.4 The layout is generally the same as the California case but with the caps section only. The students experience the case for the first time with map in hand, or at least resting next to the case. Until the student has memorized the lay of the case, he will need to refer to the map when setting type. Our Type Shop is made up of type cabinets and cases of different sizes and layouts, from donors and printers with different purposes. Because of this, we tell the students to look inside the unlabeled compartments of the cases for unusual or special characters. For example, if the printer who bought the type requested “æ” or “œ” ligatures from the foundry, they will be found there. Sometimes, as a space-saving device, more than one type size or typeface is kept in one case. This is acceptable when the size and or face are easily differentiated. Some of our type is from the home shop of a commercial printer with excellent taste, Mr. John E. Sullivan of Little Pica Press, who stored his type in ⅔ size cases. Some was more recently acquired from a job printer, Mr. A.W. Meers, who kept his collection of equipment in three buildings in a gentrifying Chicago neighborhood. He showed his love for letterpress (and his cat) by covering the tops of\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nSingle Piece of Type\n\n(Top) The basic unit: a single piece of type.

(10\" x 12\")\n\nMeasuring Wood Type Lead type is generally cast in sizes up to 72 point, after which the amount of metal needed for each character becomes too much and the accumulated weight of a set page too heavy. Wood type is manufactured for type sizes above 72 point. While foundry type is measured in points, wood type is measured in lines or picas. 1 inch = 6 pica = 6 lines 1 pica = 12 points 72 points = 1 inch\n\n34\n\nhis beautiful oak type cabinets with cardboard to prevent them from becoming scratched. (And he let his cat sleep on the bed of the press.) The type acquired from these two men joined type in our shop from the Society of Typographic Arts (STA). The STA collected type and equipment for their members to use in the 1950s. Eventually, in 1984, when they could no longer keep it in its long-time home of the Newberry Library basement, it was transferred to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. This happened mainly through the efforts of STA member (and SAIC alum) Muriel Underwood. Some of the STA collection came from R.R. Donnelley, along with other commercial printers of the time. The following is from Muriel Underwood’s May 1997 article about the Shop for the Caxtonian: A 1952 listing of equipment shows that 30 cases of Futura were to have come from A-1 Typesetters, four cases of Bodoni from Runkle, Thompson, Kovats, and nine galleys of Garamond from Poole Brothers. Ludlow Typographic Company donated leads and slugs. RR Donnelley & Sons Company gave empty California job cases and cabinets, an imposing stone, a Vandercook proofing press, and other miscellaneous equipment necessary for typesetting and printing.7 The history of this collection is integral to its spirit. Our goal is to pass that spirit and history, and the care for it, on to the students. To aid in their use, the type cabinets and cases of type in our shop are inventoried, catalogued, and cross-listed four ways (alphabetically, and by size, style, and location). They are also shared both in a binder and digitally. In identifying the type in the inventory by style, the students slowly learn to distinguish them from each other. It is important to handle type cases with care. The powerful force of gravity is explained on the first day of class; it is best to be aware of it at all times. This may seem like an odd statement, but to students used to digital type, it is prudent to point it out. When handling cases, use both hands. Carefully, with each hand along the sides of the case, pull it incrementally out of the cabinet and lift with your legs/shoulders to place it on top of the slant-top cabinet. If the case is very heavy, get help from a fellow student. We avoid the method where the case directly below the case in use is pulled out halfway, in order to support the case directly above, because it isn’t quite as safe. Many of the rails in the old cabinets are wood and are failing, and therefore cannot support the weight.\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\n(Bottom) Arion Press, The Lulu Plays.

On the student’s first day in the Type Shop, the invisible and hidden becomes visible to them, as solid matter filling the space between words and lines. Spacing and leading are shorter than type high, which in the United States is .918 inch, and therefore they do not print. Each size of type comes with its own matching size of spacing. The basic unit of spacing is the “em quad,” sometimes called a “mutton” to distinguish it from its half-size relative, the “en quad” or “nut.” “Quad” is short for quadrat, which is larger spacing, usually 1 to 4 ems wide. A 12-point type requires 12-point spacing, and the em quad of a 12-point type is a 12-point square. Similarly, a 30-point type em quad is a 30-point square. Completing the set are the spaces, 3-to-the-em (3 of these = 1 em in whatever size you are using), 4-to-the em (4 of these = 1 em, ditto), and 5-to-the-em (5 of these = 1 em). There are also 2 em quads (= 2 em quad) and copper and brass thin spaces. These last two are thin pieces of copper and brass—the copper is ½ point, the brass is 1 point. Copper and brass thin spaces are used for spacing out capital letters and for other very fine adjustments. In the past, printers would sometimes cut exceedingly thin sheets of paper down to make even finer spacing adjustments.8 Often we find these paper thins lingering in our type cases, waiting to be used again by a discriminating student. For space between words, the California case gives the largest space compartment to the 3-to-the-em. In many instances this is the most commonly used space between words in ordinary composition. In some shops, however, when closer spacing is desired, the 4-to-the-em space is the most commonly used.9 This cuts down on the possibility of unsightly areas of white in a page of text. These areas are called “rivers” when they make vertical lines of white and “lakes” when they make a visual hole in the text. Although it is true that typographers do not agree on exact standards in spacing, some say the ideal space between words in straight matter composition should be about the width of the counter in the lowercase “o.”10 In general, the books of Bruce Rogers are an excellent place to learn about beautiful typesetting and spacing; nineteenth-century job printing and composition, with their emphasis on speed, are not.\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n37\n\nLeading and slugs are pieces of metal placed between lines of type, shorter than type high, to add space between them. The thinnest leading is 1 point. There are also 2-, 3-, and 4-point thicknesses of leading. Leading equal to or thicker than 6 points is called a slug. It can be cut with a slug cutter or lead saw to the desired line length. Leading is usually kept in a leading rack on top of the type cabinet. In our Type Shop we keep 2-point leading and 6-point slugs in lengths from 6 to 30 pica on hand in the leading rack, while leading and slugs longer than 30 picas are stored for use in special projects.\n\nSetting Type by Hand “It would be well for the young compositor, learning how to distribute, to cultivate the habit of promptly picking up every letter he drops on the floor. Type is not improved by walking on it.”11 After type and spacing, leading, points, and picas have been explained to them, students are ready to set type by hand. We begin with the composing stick. The composing stick is an adjustable hand-held frame for holding lines of type. The first composing sticks were made of wood and used to set a single line length. The adjustable stick wasn’t invented for another 100 years. In 1645 the iron composing stick came into use. In 1810, the steel composing stick was made with a capacity (depth) increased to nearly 2 inches. It marks the line between ancient and modern composing sticks.12 Printer’s furniture are pieces of wood (often), metal (sometimes), or plastic (rarely) used to hold type in place in the bed of the press while printing. There are substantial differences between wood and metal furniture. Wood furniture is comparatively light and inexpensive. It has give, it expands and contracts with moisture and temperature. With heavy use wood furniture can acquire smashed corners, which reduces its precision even more. Metal (usually iron or steel) furniture is heavy, and can damage the bed of the press if dropped on it, but metal furniture is comparatively exact in its measurements. Because of this, it is especially useful for locking up multiple pages and close registration. Resalite (plastic) furniture has the benefit of not expanding and contracting, and of lightness. It has the advantages of wood and metal furniture, and none of the drawbacks. It is quite expensive, however, and not readily available. Furniture is stored in a furniture cabinet, with sizes ranging from 2 picas x 10 picas to 10 picas x 60 picas. Furniture, like spacing and leading, is shorter than type high, so does not print. It is cut in\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n(Opposite top) Stoffel Van den Bergh and An Eisendrath/ Kastaar, Reopening Museum Plantin-Moretus.

It is easier for beginners to set their type on a standard furniture size line length, so they will have an easier time arranging the furniture around the type while devising a “lockup” for printing. In order to correctly set the line length in your composing stick, place a piece of furniture of the desired line length in the stick and close the “knee.” Remove the furniture without opening the knee. Once you set your line length, in order to preserve uniformity of tautness from line to line, do not loosen the knee of the composing stick to remove the type. Holding the composing stick in your left hand, place a slug in the stick of the same length. The slug should be slightly loose in the stick, not too tight. Listen to the sound of the slug in the stick as you move it back and forth. When the slug is too loose, you hear a different tone than when the slug is snug and not too loose. Try it. You want the tautness of the type and spacing, not the leading, to push slightly against the stick when the line is set. After you choose your type, be sure to keep a slip of paper in the galley, marked with the typeface name, size, and location. This tactile reminder aids in identification and distribution. Set your first line rag right. Begin with an em quad, place it close to the knee. Hold it in place with your thumb. Choose the first letter of your text. Reach into the case with your right hand, find the letter, feel the nick, and set it in the stick upside down with the nick up. The letter will read backwards. Then set the second letter and the third until you finish your first word. When you are holding your stick correctly, you will be reading your type upside down, from left to right. Place a piece of spacing material in the stick (for example, 4-to-the-em) and begin the second word of your text. Continue until you are close to the end of your line. Break your line and fill in with quads and spacing, ending with an em. Always begin and end your line with an em quad. This makes the lines easier to handle, and allows you to hang punctuation. Use the largest pieces of spacing you can, because too many small pieces of spacing, copper, and brass thin spaces make the line springy and difficult to lock up. “Less is more” is a good principle to follow here; if you use the fewest pieces of spacing possible, then you will have fewer pieces to put back in order if the line becomes pied (or spilled). To correctly fill out the line with spacing, remove smaller spacing and replace them with larger ones. Place larger spacing toward the outside and smaller spacing toward the type.\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n41\n\n(Top) Peter and Donna Thomas, Gypsy Wagon, Mohawk Superfine Cover.

Photo by John Dunlevy.\n\n42\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nAgain, whether right- or left-handed, you should be holding your composing stick with your left hand and reaching into the case with your right. Feel your line with your right hand. Does it feel tight? Loose? If it feels loose, fill in the line with spacing until it is tight, but not too tight. It should stand up on its own without falling over, but you should be able to slide it out of the stick without straining your fingers. To begin your second line, place a piece of leading of the same line length as the first on top of the line of type. Begin your second line with an em quad just like the first line, but on top of it. Set your text continuing on from your first line. If you are setting 12-point type, you should be able to set five lines or so in the stick, after which you can remove them and tie them up in your galley. If your lines are very long and your stick is therefore heavy, transfer your type to the galley after only a few lines. If you have more lines to set in your text, place the first group of lines in the closed side of your galley. Add lines until you are finished and then tie them up together in your galley. (See the section “Tying Up the Form.”) Wood type is normally too large to set in a composing stick, but it is still a good idea to match your line length with a standard furniture length. Do a trial lockup of the form in a chase or a galley; use reglets and leading for spacing. When setting a page of type, it is most efficient for all of the lines to be set on the same line length for ease of lockup. Then, when the page is in the bed of the press, all of the lines will create a uniformly taut form. All of the lines must be set with the same degree of tautness. If they are not, some lines will be loose and wobbly, while others will be too tight. Both cause the type to be “off its feet.” When type is off its feet, it is leaning to the side, which causes uneven printing, and sometimes broken type.\n\nAlignment The way most readers are used to seeing type in newspapers and novels is justified left and right. This isn’t the most beautiful way to set type, but some argue it saves the most space. Some prefer rag right (left aligned) for its superior legibility. Like word spacing, there is an ongoing debate about the truth of this. Centered lines of type are also sometimes required. The student must know how to set type all of these ways.\n\nleft/right justified When\n\nsetting lines left/right justified, begin the line with an em as usual and set your type until you are\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n43\n\nI love letterpress.\n\nFLUSH LEFT I love letterpress.\n\nI love letterpress.\n\nFLUSH RIGHT CENTERED\n\nclose to the end of the line. Insert an em. How much space is left? Change 4-to-the-ems to 3-to-the-ems to “space out” and fill the line. Do the opposite to “space in.” The overall goal is to set a uniform page, avoiding visual holes. When looking at the space between letters, keep in mind their shapes; strive for visual balance. Do not use en spaces or spaces smaller than 5-to-the-em between words. Hyphenate words to create a pleasingly spaced page. “Spacing in” is preferred over “spacing out.”\n\nrag right After justified setting, you can easily set rag (text\n\nthat is left aligned). When setting rag right, keep the same word space throughout and break the lines to create a pleasing “rag” while avoiding “widows” or “orphans.” A widow is one word on a line by itself at the end of a paragraph. An orphan is a short line or one word appearing at the top of a page or column. While setting type, look at the edge created; an undulating line is preferred over one very long line followed by one very short line. Make adjustments until you have a satisfactory “rag” edge.\n\ncentered In order to set a line of centered type, place an equal\n\namount of spacing material before the first word in the line and after the last word in the line. The shapes of letters can cause the line to look “off-kilter” even if mathematically correct. Adjust as needed with spacing material. Again, use the largest spacing material possible.\n\nflush right To set flush right, rag left, first set the line as you would rag right. When approaching the end of the line (where you plan to break it), slide type in the stick to the end of the line and fill out the beginning of the line with spacing and quads.\n\nhanging punctuation “Hanging”\n\nquotes and other punctuation into the margin creates an aesthetically pleasing visual line. To hang punctuation in justified copy, remove the em quad\n\n44\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nfrom the end of the line with the quote marks (quote marks are the most common marks to hang) and replace with an en and a 4-to-theem. Adjust as needed.\n\nchoosing line length Take into consideration the length\n\nof the text, size of type, and standard furniture size. One rule of thumb is to not exceed the length of 1.5 lowercase alphabet in the size and style of the type used.13 “If you have liberty to choose, never set a solid text type in a measure of more than fifty ems of that text type. Long lines are hard to read.”14 Therefore, do not set 12-point type on a line longer than 50 picas. To aid in readability, if the line length is longer, increase the leading.\n\nquadding out When you fill up the line with spacing, you\n\nare quadding out. Consider using leading to fill up space if you are short on quads. For example, two 6-point slugs of the correct length can fill up space in a line with 12-point type. Measure the length of the space to be filled and select or trim to the appropriate length of leading. Place the smallest space next to the letter or punctuation, the largest on the end of the line. Finally, before justifying, read and correct your line, and when justifying, do not force characters and spaces into the line. For tips on acquiring speed in hand setting, see the International Typographic Union book Lessons in Printing.15 Although the simple mechanics of setting type by hand can be learned in an afternoon, to do it really well and quickly takes years of practice.\n\nTying Up the Form When your composing stick is full, you are ready to transfer your type to a galley. In order to preserve your line length, especially if you will be setting many lines of the same length, do not unclamp the knee. Place your thumbs and first fingers against the ends of the line. Exert firm pressure. Angle or lean it out while squeezing. Avoid lifting the type if possible. Walk the type out carefully, sliding it onto the corner of the closed end of the galley. Add additional lines until your form is finished.16\n\ntying up Cut off approximately 36 inches of string from a cone\n\nor reuse pieces from previous forms. You need enough to wrap around your form three times, and to wrap some onto your fingers.\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n45\n\n1. Anchor the string by wrapping it around your three middle lefthand fingers several times. 2. Place your anchored string fingers on the corner of the form away from the corner of the galley. 3. Wrap with other hand clockwise, returning to the corner with your anchored fingers. 4. As you turn the corner while wrapping your string, be sure to go below the starting corner, which will catch the string and hold it in place. Tighten the string at the same time. 5. Go around the form three times, tightening and catching the string each time at the same corner. 6. On the third time, again tighten and catch the string on the corner, then stop and tuck the string under with a short piece of leading. Pull the knot to the corner. This allows the string to be untied easily when in the bed of the press. If the knot is tied incorrectly, the form could pi when the string is loosened for lockup. After dressing the form (surrounding the type with furniture in the bed of the press), attempting to untie inappropriate knots is a needless frustration.\n\nInk William Morris chose the ink carefully for his books. After an intensive search, truly additive-free black ink was found in Hanover, Germany, made by the Gebrüder Jänecke ink manufacturer.17 Morris was able to achieve rich black printing with it, in emulation of the dense blacks of medieval manuscripts, which was an aesthetic long out of favor. Gutenberg, amazingly, is still our best model for a rich black ink. Today there are many different manufacturers of ink, although few of them make ink especially for letterpress. Good letterpress ink is stiff in body and highly pigmented. The ink must sit on the face of the letter and transfer easily to the paper, producing a sharp opaque print. Offset lithography inks are often too runny and not as densely pigmented as letterpress inks. Traditional lithography inks are mostly too stiff for letterpress. Etching inks are unsuitable because\n\n46\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nTying Up the Form. Photos by John Dunlevy.\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n47\n\n(Top) Eric Baskauskas, Limited Edition.

Fritz Klinke of NA Graphics, the owner of the original Vandercook blueprints, sells ink especially for letterpress made by Victory Ink and by Great Western Ink. Van Son Ink has been making letterpress ink since 1872. Their rubber base ink has additives that slow the ink drying time and reduce washup. Oil-based letterpress ink (somewhat of a misnomer, because rubber base is also oil base) is also used. It doesn’t have additives to slow the drying process, and is often more densely pigmented than rubber base ink. It can start to dry on the press, however, which then requires additional washup. To remove the ink from the can, skim the knife over the surface of the ink, like frosting a cake, to remove it. Never dig in the can with the knife; keep the surface flat. Digging exposes the ink’s surface to air, which dries it out. Depending upon the paper, letterpress ink dries by oxidation, absorption, and/or evaporation. When letterpress was the primary method of commercial printing, a different formula of ink was used for each kind of paper. For example, “news ink” was a thin, freeflowing ink which “set” only by absorption into the paper; “bond ink” was a fast-setting ink for bond, ledger, or other hard finish paper which allowed for very little absorption into the paper.18\n\nPaper for Proofing We will discuss paper in depth in Chapter 4. Briefly, use smooth white paper for proofing. Scrap bond/computer paper will work. Carbon paper can also be used as a “quick and dirty” proof, bypassing the need for ink. You need a galley for the type to be at the correct height in order to proof on a galley press. Adjust the packing on the proof press as needed. A kiss impression (one where the impression in the paper is barely detectable) is the most desirable in the proofing stage.\n\nProofing For proofing on a galley proof press, tie up your form and place it in the corner of the galley. Check to be sure no string or any other object is under the type. Place two magnets, one on each side of the form, to hold the form firmly against the corner of the galley. Alternately, place your form in the center of the galley and surround it with four slugs, then four magnets. Use a planer to set the type on\n\nChapter 3: Printer’s Primer\n\n“It took six months to remove the paint from my 1994 Nissan Sentra Limited Edition. Working in sections, I reduced each piece to bare metal with a hand-held electric sander before painting it gray. As I sanded the car, the layers of paint were reduced to dust. I saved as much of the dust as possible. When the process was complete, I sifted the pink paint dust into a fine powder and then mixed it with oil to produce ink. The ‘Limited Edition’ emblem from the back of the car was enlarged and turned into a plate for letterpress printing. During printing I used all of the gritty, viscous ink; my dust collection yielded a ‘Limited Edition’ of 243 prints. Due to the imperfect nature of the production methods involved, each print is completely unique. A car is a tool, a device that saves time and work for its owner. With a finite number of days to accomplish our life’s goals, things like automobiles allow us to move toward these ends most efficiently. The process of removing paint and collecting dust from my car was an attempt to explore the economy of time and the pursuit of goals. It was arguably a superfluous and cumbersome way to accomplish something (itself, arguably worthless) that could have been done far more quickly and easily, not unlike modern-day use of letterpress printing as an artistic form.” —Eric Baskauskas\n\n49\n\nVandercook 1 galley press.

The purpose of the proof is to find broken or wrong letters and to evaluate choice of typeface, letter spacing, and word spacing. Black ink on white paper provides the strongest contrast and makes the type the most visible. Use a brayer to roll out the ink on an ink slab. Roll the brayer over the type several times in different directions. Do not use too much ink. Do not push down too hard with the brayer; this will ink the shoulders of the type and produce an over-inked print. Place the paper carefully on the type. Without shifting the paper, take the handle of the press and roll the cylinder over the type and paper, taking the proof. Lift the paper straight up from the type. The first sight of a proof from type set by their own hands can cause the beginner’s eyes to widen, as they experience the delayed gratification the proof gives. Even if the first proof is not perfection, it conveys a humanity that a laser print from a digital file doesn’t. In the words of one-time letterpress beginner and SAIC letterpress teaching assistant Kelly Harris:\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nAbove my desk at home pinned to the wall I have the very first letterpress endeavor I set by hand; a 1 x 3 inch paper that states simply (in the ever prophetic words of Yoda): “Do or do not. There is no try.” Not only is this “piece” printed on cheap white computer paper; it’s torn crooked, the printing is obscenely non-uniform, and there’s a very conspicuous thumbprint on the back side. Arguably, it’s an exercise or draft [. . .] But to me, these qualities are what appeal to me the most—that these mistakes are so tactile—that their existence is possible only through a physical human presence (or in this case, error)—that is what I find most invigorating about working with type.\n\nStudents in the SAIC Type Shop, looking at their first printed sheet. 2012.

As a consequence, there are literally thousands of Chinese characters. . . . In Chinese writing, you had to have a very large number of characters, each individually carved to set in the press.

His paper was made from cotton rags, surviving the 500 years since, forever sealing the relationship between sublime printing and rag paper. Handmade paper, luscious, soft, able to take on many colors, custom-made, thick, pleasingly human, is the top choice for many letterpress printers, just as it was for Gutenberg.\n\nPaper Commercial paper today, used for large runs of magazines, books, and newspapers, is made from trees. After the tree is de-barked and chipped, it needs to be chemically treated in order for it to be made into paper. To get away from this process, seen as environmentally unfriendly, alternatives to paper made from trees have been sought. “Tree-free” paper can mean paper made from cotton, bamboo, or hemp. Although cotton paper is certainly “tree-free,” it is also seen by some as non-sustainable because of the large amount of resources, such as water and pesticides, utilized when growing it.1 Bamboo is touted by some growers and paper manufacturers as a better alternative.2 Bamboo paper for letterpress has been offered by paper mills such as Legion in the United States, Lana Papiers in France, Hahnemühle in Germany, and Awagami in Japan. For so many manufacturers to introduce paper made from bamboo indicates a demand for an environmentally sustainable letterpress paper. However, bamboo is classified as an invasive plant in some places, and cotton paper has not lost its appeal. Boxcar Press recently offered an all-cotton paper to the public that is suitable for letterpress, with a coating for HP Indigo printing. The company states that the paper is made with wind energy, and has carbon-neutral manufacturing.3 The search for the most eco-friendly paper continues. Letterpress has the ability to accept many different materials for printing, especially if the matrix is a photopolymer plate. Photopolymer plates made from digital files tend to be much more resilient than lead type, which is especially true when a heavier punch is desired. The ideal paper for letterpress is soft and smooth, with minimal sizing. Handmade paper fulfills these criteria easily. It is the top choice for letterpress as well as the most expensive. The next best choice is mold-made paper, made on a machine from rags or cotton linters. Least expensive is machine-made paper from wood pulp. Between these three options there are many different possibilities. The grain of paper is evident in machine-made and mold-made paper. Handmade paper has no grain, because the grain of the paper is created when the majority of the fibers line up parallel to each other\n\nChapter 4: Press and Printing\n\n(Opposite) A Noble Fragment, Being a Leaf from the Gutenberg Bible, 1450‒1455.

This happens when the paper pulp is poured onto the moving mold and the fibers line up, like logs floating down a river.4 In the formation of handmade paper, the fibers behave more like leaves in a pond, floating freely in all directions, and so do not form a grain. The effect of grain is that the paper wants to bend, fold, and tear much more easily in one direction, with the grain, rather than the other, against the grain. For this reason, the grain of the paper should always be parallel to the spine of the book, so the pages will bend and fold in harmony with the turn of the page. The two sides of the sheet are different for most paper. One side is the rough mold side. The other side is the smooth felt side, which is normally the top side. Take note of the position of the watermark if there is one. When the watermark is right reading, this is the front or top of the sheet. In some papers the difference between the mold and the felt side is much more pronounced, while in others it is less. Wash your hands before you cut or tear the paper to size. Use a paper knife or a tear bar for a soft edge. Employ a guillotine or a paper cutter for a sharp edge. Stack the paper printing side up. Traditionally, the deckles are at the bottom or the right side of the sheet. This works well for feeding on a Vandercook, since it is better to feed paper into the grippers from a uniform cut edge, rather than an irregular deckle. Be sure to tear to size some newsprint for proofing as well. Allow extra paper for setup. One rule of thumb is to expect 10% to 20% spoilage. When printing an edition of ten, consider buying half as much more of the edition paper. Be prepared for spoilage in each step: in the printing of each color, every time the paper goes through the press, and in the binding. A student’s biggest expense is paper; buy as much as you can possibly afford. For more on paper, see the section “Choosing Appropriate Paper” in Chapter 8.\n\nThe Vandercook Proof Press: “The Editioning Press” Originally, Vandercook presses were not made to be used the way we use them: to teach art students who are almost always absolute beginners. The presses, manufactured in Chicago beginning in 1909, were originally designed for accurately checking the printability of type and plates.5 Vandercooks are capable of producing very-highquality printing even when the operator knows comparatively little about the process. We refer to our four Vandercooks that have grippers and adjustable inking systems as “Editioning Presses.” This is to distinguish\n\n56\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\n(Top) Tear bar in use.

We named them for the way the majority of Vandercooks still in existence today are used: for editioning. Vandercook without a doubt is the most recognized name in the world for proof presses . . . The first press was a “rocker” proof press, made with a geared cylinder. Up to the development of this press all proofs were either made on a roller press that depended on gravity for impression or on a Washington Hand Press.6 We have five Vandercooks: a Universal I, a Universal IAB, a No. 4, and a No. 3. The fifth Vandercook is a No. 1, a small galley press without grippers. After the students set type by hand, print proofs on the No. 1, and make their corrections, we print the type together in a broadside on one of the editioning Vandercooks. Before you begin on any press, wipe down the bed and bearers with a slightly oily rag. Refer to the press manual for oiling and lubrication instructions. Be sure all moving parts are oiled. (In the SAIC Shop, staff oversee this task to be sure every student is not oiling the presses in our Shop.) Buy a manual from NA Graphics, or check the list of manuals downloadable from the Boxcar Press website.\n\npacking The\n\ngoal of packing is the perfect impression. Too much packing and your “punch,” or impression, will be too strong, possibly damaging the type and press. Too little and the ink won’t fully transfer to the paper. At one time the “perfect” impression was a “kiss” impression: no indentation in the paper was visible or felt. This is traceable to 1801, when the Fourdrinier papermaking machine was patented.7 With the adoption of this thinner paper made from wood pulp, the kiss impression allowed faster printing and resulted in less wear on the type.8 Our contemporary aesthetic is an impression just distinguishable on the back of the paper and just visible on the front. This differentiates letterpress from the flat printing of lithography and digital printing. In our Shop we use oiled tympan paper for packing. Follow the recommended thickness for your press; read the cylinder undercut stamped on the cylinder of the press. When the carriage is at the feedboard, the numbers are visible stamped on the operator’s side. The Universal I has a cylinder undercut of .040 inch. Keep in mind the .040 inch thickness recommended by the manufacturer is measured from the bare cylinder to type high, which includes the paper on which you are printing. So if you are printing on very thick paper,\n\n58\n\nFor the Love of Letterpress\n\nVandercook Universal 1 B\n\nD\n\nC\n\nE F\n\nG H\n\nA\n\nI\n\nM\n\nL\n\nN\n\nF J\n\nK\n\nO\n\nP\n\nA – Feed Board\n\nE – Cylinder\n\nI – Form Roller\n\nB – Side Guide C – Paper Guides D – Grippers\n\nF – Bed & Cylinder Bearers G –Vibrator Roller H – Rider Roller\n\nJ – Press Bed K – Dead Bar\n\nM – Inking Roller Trip Lever N – Cylinder Carriage O – Cylinder Trip (Print)\n\nL – Toggle Switch\n\nP – Gripper (Foot) Pedal\n\nChapter 4: Press and Printing\n\n59\n\n(Top) Maria Jose Prenafeta, Fit o no Fito.

Measure the total thickness with a micrometer. Oiled tympan paper becomes compressed with use, so be sure to change it periodically. Some printers, such as Claire van Vliet,9 use a Mylar draw sheet in place of, or on top of, oiled tympan paper. Two of the advantages of Mylar are that it is easily cleaned off when it gets ink on it and it doesn’t need to be changed often. Follow the directions in your press manual when changing the packing: Repacking Cylinder. The cylinder is ground for .040\" packing. It is very important the correct amount of packing is carried on the cylinder. Incorrect packing is apt to cause misregister, slurs, and wrinkles. . . . For most work the best cylinder packing consists of all hard manila sheets. Thickness of packing may be adjusted by placing thin sheets next to the cylinder. To change or adjust packing, move cylinder to center of bed (on trip if there is a form or plate on the bed) so the reel rod is in the up position. Unlatch reel rod ratchet with wrench . . . and loosen drawsheet from reel. With left hand, grasp packing and as cylinder is returned to feedboard, lay packing on feedboard. If necessary to change the drawsheet, loosen the fillister head screws in the packing clamp gripper bar. Unless overlays are being used, only the drawsheet is held by the bar. When moving cylinder to center of bed to secure packing, hold packing in position by smoothing it out with left hand. Be sure packing is tight to cylinder at both sides of gripper edge.10\n\nmixing ink colors In our Shop, students primarily mix\n\nink for short runs, using the color wheel or the Pantone swatch book as a guide. The Pantone book is manufactured for offset printers, but it can be used for choosing letterpress colors. It is handy for finding out what base inks are needed to mix a particular color. For example, you can’t achieve certain colors if you don’t begin with reflex blue or process yellow. Offset printers use an ink scale to measure out amounts of ink for mixing colors. The Pantone book’s ink mixing proportions assume the printer has one. If you don’t have an ink scale, you are still mixing by eye, but with a useful guide (the percentages) and a goal (the printed swatch). If you need to mix a special color consistently, be sure to mix a sufficient quantity. Or, order the ink already mixed from your ink supplier.\n\nChapter 4: Press and Printing\n\n61\n\n(Top) Nick Loaring, Golden Cabinet Gig Posters.

As the NA Graphics website states: “The basic color chart for mixing PMS colors for printing—note these are printed by offset and letterpress typically lays down a much thicker layer of ink than offset. PMS colors printed letterpress typically print darker than . . . the Pantone sample books will show.”11 Some printers compensate for this difference by using opaque white instead of transparent white. Others will use transparent white, as the Pantone Matching System (PMS) book directs, but will aim for one shade lighter than the chosen swatch. Opaque white tends to be more blue-white and is a good choice if you do not want the paper to show through or want the color to cover something else. Transparent white is a vehicle with no pigment in it, but has a yellowish hue because of the oils in it. It spreads out any pigment it is added to, giving it a watery look, and allows the paper and any other printing underneath to show through. The authors of The Practice of Printing advise, “Start with the lightest color first, then add other colors sparingly. If the lighter color should be added last, it would take much more ink to secure the proper proportions, and would result in an over-supply of the mixture.”12 Pigment amount and density is much greater in inks other than white. Therefore, you will create much more ink than you need and waste white ink if you do not follow this rule. Another guide for mixing ink is the color wheel. Explore hues and tints by mixing a color with black or white. Complementary colors can be added to a pure color to reduce brightness or to darken value. “There are times when a dark ink other than black may be used for subduing colors . . . Violet, for instance will deepen yellow and not turn it green as a blue-black is very apt to do.”13 To make an inking slab to mix your ink, place white paper on a flat, comfortable height work surface, then place a thick piece of glass with finished edges on top. Tape down the edges. The area for mixing ink should be clean and well lit, with natural light if at all possible. Remove the ink from the can, skimming the surface with an ink knife. The amount removed will depend upon the number of prints, the absorbency of the paper, and the size of the form. Scrape the ink onto the inking slab and “work it” by drawing the knife down through the ink, turning the knife and drawing it through the ink again. Pick out any dried bits of ink with the knife. Check the consistency of the ink. Drip the ink from the knife to the slab. It should flow slowly down. When in a pile on the slab, it should slump a little, not result in a flat puddle. If the ink is too thick, wo"
