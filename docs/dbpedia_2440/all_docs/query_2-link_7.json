        "text": "Type is everywhere. In the books you read, the products you use, and even in this very website you're on right now. But what is type? In the context of design, type is the style or appearance of text. It can also refer to the process of working with text. Typography can often be an intimidating topic, but it doesn’t have to be. You only need to understand the basics to make an impact in your designs.\n\nSo, let’s begin. Designer and educator Mia Cinelli will discuss type classifications, type families, and help us understand the difference between a font and a typeface.\n\nVideo copyright info\n\nCopyright holder: Mia Cinelli\n\nMackinac 1895, Bags to Riches, The Landscape of Love, What's Past is Prologue, Pandemic Parade Banners\n\nHide Content\n\nWhat Are Type Classifications?\n\nAccording to Ellen Lupton, author of “Thinking with Type,” type classifications are a basic system for classifying typefaces devised in the nineteenth century, when printers sought to identify a heritage for their own craft analogous to that of art history. Humanist letterforms are closely connected to calligraphy and the movement of the hand. Transitional and modern typefaces are more abstract and less organic. These three main groups correspond roughly to the Renaissance, Baroque and Enlightenment periods in art and literature.\n\nHistorians and critics of typography have since proposed more finely grained schemes that attempt to better capture the diversity of letterforms. Designers in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries have continued to create new typefaces based on historic characteristics. Let’s take a look at the common classifications for Serif, Sans Serif, Monospace, Script and Display typefaces.\n\nSerif\n\nA serif is a stroke added to the beginning or end of one of the main strokes of a letter. A typeface with serifs is called a serif typeface. Serifs can be classified as Old-Style, Transitional, Modern and Slab.\n\nCharacteristics of Serif Typefaces:\n\nOld-Style\n\nHave a low contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nHave a diagonal stress in the strokes\n\nHave slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders\n\nTransitional\n\nHave a high contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nHave a medium-high x-height\n\nHave vertical stress in the strokes\n\nHave bracketed serifs\n\nModern (Didone, Neoclassical)\n\nHave a high contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nHave a medium-high x-height\n\nHave vertical stress in the strokes\n\nHave bracketed serifs\n\nSlab\n\nAre heavy serifs with subtle differences between the stroke weight\n\nUsually have minimal or no bracketing\n\nSans Serif\n\nA typeface without serifs is called a sans serif typeface, from the French word “sans” that means \"without.\" Sans serifs can be classified as Transitional, Humanist and Geometric.\n\nCharacteristics of Sans Serif Typefaces:\n\nTransitional\n\nHave a low contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nHave vertical or no observable stress\n\nHumanist\n\nHave a medium contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nHave a slanted stress\n\nGeometric\n\nHave a low contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nHave vertical stress and circular round forms\n\nMonospace\n\nA typeface that displays all characters with the same width is known as Monospace.\n\nScript\n\nScript typefaces have a natural, handwritten feel. Scripts can be classified as Black Letter, Calligraphic and Handwriting.\n\nCharacteristics of Script Typefaces:\n\nBlack Letter\n\nHave a high contrast between thick and thin strokes\n\nAre narrow with straight lines and angular curves\n\nCalligraphic\n\nAre replications of calligraphic styles of writing (formal)\n\nHandwriting\n\nAre replications of handwriting (casual)\n\nDisplay (Decorative)\n\nDisplay typefaces, also known as decorative, are a broad category of typefaces that do not fit into the preceding classifications. They are typically suited for large point sizes and primarily used for display.\n\nCharacteristics of Display Typefaces:\n\nDecorative\n\nAre distinctive, eye-catching and original\n\nExample in Use: Helvetica\n\nThis NYC Subway Map designed by Massimo Vignelli uses a sans serif typeface, Helvetica, to clearly indicate neighborhoods, stations and transit lines.\n\nGet your free template for “Type Classifications”\n\nSecure form\n\nName Please provide your name.\n\nEmail\n\nWe respect your privacy\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nGet free UX design learning material every week\n\n318,649 designers enjoy our newsletter—sure you don’t want to receive it?\n\nWhat are Type Families?\n\nIn the sixteenth century, printers began organizing roman and italic typefaces into matched families. The concept was formalized in the early twentieth century to include styles such as bold, semibold and small caps.\n\nExample in Use: Garamond 3\n\nThis magazine cover uses the Garamond 3 typeface family in various sizes. Although the typeface is classical and conservative, the obsessive, slightly deranged layout is distinctly contemporary.\n\nWhat are Type Superfamilies?\n\nA traditional roman book face typically has a small family — an intimate group that consists of roman, italic, small caps, and possibly bold and semibold (each with an italic variant) styles. Sans-serif families often come in many more weights and sizes, such as thin, light, black, compressed and condensed. A superfamily consists of dozens of related fonts in multiple weights and/or widths, often with both sans-serif and serif versions. Small capitals and non-lining numerals (once found only in serif fonts) are included in the sans-serif versions of Thesis, Scala Pro and many other contemporary superfamilies.\n\nExample in Use: Univers\n\nUnivers was designed by the Swiss typographer Adrian Frutiger in 1957. He designed twenty-one versions of Univers, in five weights and five widths. Whereas some type families grow over time, Univers was conceived as a total system from its inception.\n\nThe Take Away\n\nType is everywhere. In the books you read, the products you use, and even in this very website you're on right now. In the context of design, type is the style or appearance of text. In this lesson, you learned about type classifications, type families and the difference between a font and a typeface.\n\nType classifications were a basic system for classifying typefaces devised in the nineteenth century, in an effort to organize and understand type. Common classifications include Serif, Sans Serif, Monospace, Script and Display typefaces.\n\nYou also learned about type families, a concept formalized in the early twentieth century to include styles such as roman, italic, small caps and bold — and type superfamilies, that consisted of dozens of related fonts in multiple weights and sizes to include thin, light, black, compressed and condensed.\n\nRemember, you only need to understand the basics to type to make an impact in your designs.\n\nReferences and Where to Learn More\n\nLearn more about the Typography by reading this thoughtful book by Ellen Lupton: Ellen Lupton.
