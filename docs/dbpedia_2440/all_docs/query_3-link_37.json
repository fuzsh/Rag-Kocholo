        "text": "November 9, 2023\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nâ\n\nAmazing and worthwhile. I got to hear things about my boys I did not know and also how much they respect my wife and me. I know for a fact it was a worthwhile session for us as a family.\n\nAt 97, for some reason, Stu Klitsner has started having some health problems.\n\nIndeed, the last year has been a bit touch-and-go for Stu, my beloved cousin, now the last one of his generation standing and the patriarch of an extended family of cousins and cousinsâ children and even cousinsâ childrenâs children. An unforgettably radiant person, entirely present in love with whomever heâs with, Stu has had a decades-long career with major musical and dramatic roles on stage and a basketful of supporting roles in TV and film, where his devastatingly handsome, trustworthy face, gravelly voice, and almost vaudeville-style grace won him a variety of roles where something extra to the âgood guyâ roles was needed. This good guy has been a fire chief, a professor, two ministers, two rabbis, a coroner, and countless other authority figures whose well-meaning solidity could instantly communicate decency and likability to an audience.\n\nStuâs only granddaughterâs wedding took place in Napa, California Saturday evening. The brideâs dream was that her grandfather, who, after all, only has one granddaughter, would bring his signature leading-man singing voice to bless her union. Indeed, the bride told me on the phone she believed more of her friends were coming to meet Stu at the wedding than to celebrate with her, and there was nothing to do but agree. Stuâs a personage.\n\nHe almost didnât make it. Yet a series of hospital stays and emergency-room visits over the past year kept him going (and he has remained mentally as fit as ever). Sacralizing both the ceremony and the reception from his wheelchair, where he looked most of his 97 years, he somehow crooned, in a sonorous voice that sounded 45, three of the Broadway tunes for which heâd become famous. He sang with tenderness, force, and infinite love to his granddaughter and her new groom.\n\nItâs always surprised me that Stu is self-taught as an actor. Heâs never used the language of âintentionsâ or âbeats,â nor has he broken down and analyzed scenes in the modern style. The son of an exuberant pianist who played piano professionally to accompany silent movies, Stu has gone on instinct, which seems never to have sent him a false note.\n\nHe did it.\n\nHe willed to live to sing at his granddaughterâs wedding. The ultimate people person, he also saw the wedding as an opportunity, perhaps, to say goodbye to the many cousins he loved.\n\nYou probably have stories very much like this one, cases in which a loved one miraculously defeated the odds and held on till the last child could catch a plane, or she could make that graduation or hold her first grandchild. It is powerful to see the will to live to reach a specific goal right before you, to see the will make a deal with the body. And, in this case, Stu mopped up his weakening body on those nuptial stages. That spirit â whether it stems from the power of Stuâs boundless love or the professionalism of the actor for whom the show must go on â shows us whatâs possible, even in a human body.\n\nBuild your skills in working with groups in our upcoming training and certify in the unique tool that helps others transcend themselves through the power of the love they have (sometimes very deep down!) for each other. Youâll help families come together in the face of the hardest moments of their lives and build their strength for what comes.\n\nFor many people, a conversation on Zoom is really helpful as they get a sense of whether THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® Conductor Training is right for them. Schedule a conversation with me. I look forward to talking with you.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

The post-pandemic fad of comedy shows that deal with what have been taboo topics is currently walking that line.\n\nRead More Â»\n\nNo Comments\n\nActivities & Tools\n\nIf Youâre a Pro, You Gotta Have a Pro\n\nLindsay Bramanâs example can open your mind about what sorts of both joy and utility you can create, simply by letting your own gifts out of the closet and using them in your work, in recognizing that, if a therapist/doodler can connect two passions, so can you.\n\nRead More Â»\n\nNo Comments\n\nContact Us\n\nSeptember 29, 2023\n\nThe Chaplainâs Feet\n\nâ\n\nAt the end of the THE HUMAN JOURNEY session, she said her faith, trust, and resilience were strengthened.\n\nHave you watched, as I have, the transition in many speakersâ English in the last few years, as weâve switched from referring to âhuman beingsâ and moved on to calling them simply âhumansâ?\n\nFor me, the abbreviated term still sounds odd but it does stress our animal nature; we are perhaps like âantelopes,â âwildcats,â or âsnakes.â There is no such thingâyetâas a âsnake being.â\n\nYet what either a âhuman beingâ or a âhumanâ is, is a lifelong search and it kept coming up this week. A dear friend told me about the first meeting she attended of a spiritual discussion group whose opening topic was the little question, âWhat is a human being?â\n\nAnd then Hank Kinzie, currently completing his training as a certified THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® Conductor, described his work as a leadership coach as âhelping executives to be human.â Hankâs description brought me back to how I once described the teaching of theatre directing to my college students â¦ as basically âteaching people to be human in intimate relationships.â (The intimacy is needed when you direct actors because youâre talking about how other people look, speak, move, and otherwise express themselves and very often, youâre asking for it to be other than it is. As you might guess, trust is necessary for this.)\n\nChaplains exercise their humanness with every patient or family member they meet. A patient is âone who suffersâ; the patient chaplain is the one who can help them bear their suffering, emptying herself of, or softening, the alarm bells of her own spirit, emptying the mental and physical hall of everyday noise so as to be fully attentive to what someone else so desperately needs â to be held in deep presence. She grounds into her most basic (perhaps animal) nature, silencing her own thoughts, her biases about any ârightâ way to face the big questions, and receives the patient in, or on, the ground of their earthly co-inhabitance.\n\nIt is, perhaps (and metaphorically speaking!), a job for the chaplainâs feet, in which grounding and solidifying into earthly presence, is the way.\n\nSo whatâs a âmovement chaplainâ?\n\nSomeone who dances with the patient? Someone who helps those newly immobilized? Someone who counsels a gymnastics troupe?\n\nClose.\n\nItâs a chaplain who offers spiritual and emotional support to those engaged in âbodily activism,â who, in essence, put their feet behind their words, and engage in activism and street demonstrations, or âmovements,â to protest policies or to advocate for new, more socially just ones. Recently, such activists and organizers have been involved in actions for such causes as Black Lives Matter and immigrant rights.\n\nThough the term may be new, ScottBey Jones, who directs the Faith Matters Network in Nashville, trains chaplains in movement chaplaincy, helping them get on the ground and ready to catch those who need courage, a long view, or a touchpoint with their faith and hope.\n\nBut the dancer image is also not far off.\n\nIf in seeing the term âmovement chaplainâ you connected physical movement (like dance) with chaplaincy, youâre on track with Keely Garfield, who sees her work as a chaplain completely intertwined with her profession as a dancer/choreographer. In a feature on her recent choreographic work, âThe Invisible Project,â Garfield links the two: Both are simply âthe work of being a human being.â (Maybe Garfield didnât get the memo about the change to âhuman.â)\n\nAgain, there is an unspoken relationship between the words âpatienceâ and âpatientâ in âInvisible Project.â The real work of a chaplain, Garfield says, is to almost become invisible. It comes down to how present she can be, how well she can listen. Garfieldâs being has been immersed in a Zen koan:\n\nHow is it when the tree withers and the leaves fall?\n\nBody exposed in the golden wind.\n\nâThat could be the â¦ theme of my life: Body exposed in the golden wind,â she says. Observed one of her dancers of âThe Invisible Projectâ â âa dance made in the context of COVIDâ â âItâs a lot to hold so many peopleâs stories in your body, and so many people close to passing, or in crisis or trauma, in your body.â\n\nBeing Human â With Other Humans\n\nUltimately, thatâs some of what training to conduct THE HUMAN JOURNEY does for chaplains, social workers, compassionate citizens, counselors, and clergy.\n\nIt helps you be there, a human settled and open to receive another beingâs humanness, in a structure that itself helps them to unfold in your presence and in the presence of those who love them but donât know how to express it.\n\nOur tested, reliable structure supports both individuals and groups constructing meaning out of the worst times in their lives â¦ using the building blocks of their own lives. In so doing, they find their footing going forward, through and past the hell of the moment, into a positive future that embraces them all. Use your feet and help them find theirs.\n\nLearn more about, and certify in, THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® methodology.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

There was a noticeable shift in the serious way they all held space for each other. There were moments of shared experience and relatability, moments of deep empathy when someone talked about coming from a hard place, and lots of âahaâ moments as they all collectively made more sense to each other.\n\nIf youâve ever heard the clanking of a blacksmithâs hammer against an anvil, you know it has a distinct, medium-high pitch, an oddly comforting sound, as if business is getting taken care of, and strong, determined people, perhaps channeling the energy of Greek god Hephaestus, are nearby.\n\nAn urban dweller like me rarely has occasion to hear that sound. Even so, the music of the clanking on the terrace just outside last weekâs Parliament of the Worldâs Religions, held for thousands of interfaith and peace leaders and workers in Chicago, reached my ears for three days, out on the lakeside terrace of the conference center, before I was drawn near by the sound of a folksinger accompanying the labor and singing his heart out.\n\nIt was neither horseshoes nor cabinet hinges that the blacksmiths were making that had caused Parliament attendees to form a line to take their turn at helping.\n\nWhat these blacksmiths from RAWTools were doing was taking surrendered guns from a variety of sources and re-forming them into garden hand tools, embodying their mission and message of peace as elegantly as possible. The organization takes literally the passage from the Book of Isaiah to âbeat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.â\n\nA chance to help pound instruments that can kill into tools that can bring forth new life? I got into line and awaited my turn to put on the suede work apron and goggles.\n\nThe 1893 Moment\n\nThe Parliament of the Worldâs Religions â which attracts people who are engaged in interfaith work from all over the world, and from more than 200 different world religions or spiritual traditions â has its roots in Chicago, dating from the 1893 Worldâs Fair.\n\nAt this Columbian Exposition, Chicago got its chance to compete with Parisâs Eiffel Tower by introducing the Ferris Wheel (in other countries referred to as the âChicago Wheelâ) along with other prized local inventions, including Cracker Jacks, Juicy Fruit gum, zippers, and the first modern skyscraper, which had been built only five years before.\n\nI was excited to attend the Parliament in its â and my â home city, including partly at sites where the 1893 Worldâs Fair took birth, including at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe inspiration for the Parliament dates from September 11th that year when religions of the world had the opportunity, for the first time, to represent themselves publicly, rather than be represented through an outsiderâs distorting lens. Most notably, it was when Hindu teacher Swami Vivekananda shocked and delighted Westerners in the audience by addressing them as âSisters and Brothers of America!â and showing them the many commonalities between Eastern and Western faith traditions, calling for religious tolerance, opening East-West dialogue for the rest of us, and certainly changing American spiritual cultures in marked ways.\n\nYou can expand this image and start to read Vivekanandaâs speech at the site of the Art Institute of Chicago in this 2017 public installation, entitled Public Notice 3, by Mumbai-born artist Jitish Kallat on AICâs grand staircase.\n\nThe Healing of No More\n\nWhen I reached the top of the line, it was my turn to let a gun have it with the hammer as the blacksmith steadied the barrel with his tongs. To begin the work of beating a glowing-red sword, fresh from the forge, into a ploughshare. And, like the others, I did so with the energy of someone whose work is about peace.\n\nA worker for peace in the Middle East insisted at the Parliament, âWe must let go of an idyllic concept of peace. We will have peace with problems, but not peace with violence.â Peace becomes working together to solve those problems. And RAWTools does more than invite people to surrender their weapons. It teaches nonviolent means to resolve problems.\n\nWhen I finally had to relinquish my hammer, the line had gotten even longer. I stood near to watch and learned that RAWTools typically invites those whose lives have been directly impacted by gun violence to come to the head of the line. I heard the story of a woman who had lost a child to gun violence who, taking the hammer, brought it down over and over again with full force, crying out, âEnough is ENOUGH!â\n\nLearn more about, and certify in, THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® methodology.\n\nâ\n\nWow... what an experience...

People whoâd previously had zero interest in public health, or who had had no idea what it was, were following epidemiologists on social media; the germ trackers were the hottest guests on TV news. Epidemiologist parents of young children could put their kids to bed and then proudly imagine their kids telling their kids, down the line, that grandma had been an epidemiologist, and their grandkids sighing wistfully and saying they wish they had known her and maybe they could follow in her footsteps.\n\nPublic health has gotten bigger and bigger in recent decades. What was only thought of in the past as individual choices, like drug addiction, gun violence, or smoking crossed over to be thought of by many as social issues and, eventually, as matters of public health. With the Surgeon Generalâs report that came out in May, 2023, loneliness and isolation may assume their place alongside them as social epidemics.\n\nThe report represented an evolution in Dr. Vivek H. Murthyâs thinking over nine years of listening to the American public and reading in the scientific literature. Loneliness is correlated with tremendous impacts on physical health, greater than those for either obesity or inactivity, and similar to those of smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day, with increases in cardiovascular disease, stroke, dimension, and premature death â not to mention depression and anxiety. It turns out, as Dr. Stephanie Cacioppo has said, âWe are each otherâs key to a long life and healthy life.â\n\nYet it still flatters the individualism of those who donât smoke â or who are insensitive to smoke â or who are unaware of the dangers of secondary smoke â to see smoking as someone elseâs problem or their character flaw. In many peopleâs minds still, smoking has nothing to do with marketing cigarettes to vulnerable populations, with how prejudice impacts behavior, much less with the potential effectiveness of public education and incentives that would make it easier to quit.\n\nBut, then again, these sexy epidemiologists have generally been ahead of the popular imagination, seeing such problems as requiring whole societiesâ attitudes, choices, and behavior to shift and our best social vision, cooperation, and innovation to address.\n\nMany of the health issues that go beyond communicable diseases that weâre still hard put to see as affecting individuals also affect the physical and mental health of others and even their lives, in the case of gun violence.\n\nWith loneliness the social impacts may be equally and more widespread, even, as in Dr. Murthyâs (and othersâ) views it may lead to the total breakdown of our democratic society. Murthy connects loneliness to the increasing polarization in our country and to the survival of our democracy. Loneliness changes the brain, increasing paranoid thinking, vigilance, and creating a vicious circle in which they very brain signals that would ordinarily trigger someone to reach out for social connection instead make them fear others.\n\nis correlated with paranoid thinking and even with violence.\n\nSo what does our Surgeon General put forth as potential solutions?\n\nStructural and policy change to increase interdependence and connection.\n\nAltering our relationship to technology.\n\nAnd rebuilding and strengthening the social connections we already have.\n\nYou know where Iâm going with this. THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® is about reducing the sense of loneliness that can people have, even within their closest relationships, that bite them in the butt when crisis comes:\n\nA parentâs need for 24-hour care, when only one sibling lives close and they know theyâre in over their head;\n\nThe impending loss from breast cancer of the core member of your friend group from college, whom everyone saw as their own best friend; or\n\nThe loss that no one in the family can talk about because it feels just too raw.\n\nOur Conductors are both what we call Compassionate Citizensâthose who are aware of the need and ready to offer their care by offering this innovative, well-structured experience â and professionals in the fields of care management, chaplaincy, hospice, palliative care, counseling, end of life doula work, and social work who have seen the gap in what is offered to families in the pain of transition and what is truly needed.\n\nLearn more about, and certify in, THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® methodology.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

We hope youâll join us for training!\n\nâ\n\nâDo not hesitate!â\n\nRecently, the New York Times featured a story about a seemingly new trend in stand-up comedy: using death and grief as comic material. âThatâs the Funny Thing About Griefâ tracks how common the subjects of death and grief are these days in the work of stand-up comics.\n\nIs it in supremely bad taste, or career-limiting, to use these serious subjects on the American comedy stage?\n\nHealthy and young people have mortality, death, and grief on the minds in ways they may not have prior to 2020. Members of Generation Z think about death more than any other generation, with 35% thinking about it every day. More than 50% of all American adults think about their deaths more often than before they did before the pandemic. With death on so many more peopleâs minds, it stands to reason that it would be in the popular consciousness and appearing in pop culture in new ways â indeed, that it would be bursting to come out.\n\nWe may be more receptive to comedy that leaves a ârespectfulâ amount of time (whatever that is) between a painful event and its treatment in literature or other art forms. For many years, 9/11 was off limits.\n\nIn the years after 9/11, articles appeared in the popular media in which their authors would muse about how much time would have to pass before one could produce comedy about a national event that had at once produced enormous loss of life and attacked Americansâ sense of invulnerability.\n\nWriters and comics had to consider:\n\nWhom would a joke hurt?\n\nWhose memories would it disrespect? and â¦\n\nWhat kinds of people have we become if weâre even capable of creating comedy out of loss?\n\nDoes the Taboo Make Any Sense?\n\nBut we might consider a broadly held assumption that grief and loss donât belong in comedy. Re-visiting a painful event through a comedic and performative lens â provided that event has been grieved to a large extent â might actually help both performer and audience. Using their creative writing and timing when engaging with a live audience could conceivably provide a healing communal experience, easing the natural isolation of the grief experience. Shared laughter can improve mood, boost the immune system, and ease pain. It can relax muscles, decrease your heart rate and blood pressure, and release dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins.\n\nAnd perhaps it is not inappropriate to share, particularly if it is about the authorâs own condition or grief, if it is their own story to tell, rather than trying to own someone elseâs, including making any assumptions about the audienceâs experience.\n\nBreaking such a taboo might even break the ice of a shared reality. When Carnegie-Mellon computer scientist Randy Pausch, who was well-known to have pancreatic cancer, was slated to give his final public lecture, the audience flocked to hear him. His presentational style in that talk could be described as ebullient. At one point he quipped, âIf I donât seem as depressed or morose as I should be â¦ sorry to disappoint you!â\n\nComedy in the Family Gathering Post-Funeral\n\nIn my own extended family of cousins engaged professionally, semi-professionally, or simply by proximity in show business, gatherings at the house after a funeral ceremony has always included funny as well as moving stories. It simply wouldnât be like the Klitsners (yes, youâre free to chuckle) not to laugh in the midst of tears.\n\nThose stories bank on the eccentric or particular behaviors of the person who had died, those habits or ways of a person that endeared him or her to us, or even annoyed us, in similar ways. It was the unique ways in which they questioned the world, the scrapes they would get themselves into that made the person themselves memorable, all the more important after their death.\n\nIâve always loved when such stories would start out with the something that the person âwouldâ do over and over again, as if on automatic. (I finally learned in writing this whatâs the âwouldâ is called: the âhabitual aspect.â)\n\nHenri Bergson famously defined comedy as what happens when what is human seems to be mechanical, acting out of keeping with the norms of a given situation. (The idea of the habitual or mechanical also can become comical when used to poke fun at someone whoâs still alive: the boss who doesnât, but pretends to, know more than his employees; the toddler who says things to nasty relatives his parents wish they could get away with.) The pleasure of the laugh, whether the person being jostled is dead or alive, is perhaps most enjoyable when the audience shares the same knowledge of the person and can recognize their interactions in the speakerâs tale.\n\nSo comedy while the performer or storyteller is grieving â¦ comedy that holds up the personality of the person whoâs died â¦ comedy that acknowledges an experience all have shared and done work on grieving: all stand the chance not only of success at humor but also success in supporting both individual and group healing.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

Our tools also support the work of compassionate citizens, inspired by what they have seen and gone through during the pandemic to make the end of life experience one that brings families closer together, makes it more possible to find meaning in the midst of suffering, and eases the capacity for listening and sharing values. We love working in experience research and design with our clients and invite you to contact us with what you want to accomplish with your services.\n\nOur niche is a very specific one â researching existing patient, family, and staff experiences and designing services and methods for those focused on families and groups â¦ in all their myriad dynamics. Fellow creators have also brought their creative gifts to the support of their colleaguesâ work.\n\nToday, Iâm going to feature one such creator Iâve admired from afar â and who Iâd think youâd be glad to also consider as a resource.\n\nLindsay Braman is both a therapist and an illustrator who, through some stroke of insight, decided to combine their seemingly disparate interests and gifts to become a âvisual translator.â (Imagine being both a closet doodler and a therapist and at last recognizing that the two didnât have to be separate!)\n\nBraman creates delightful explanatory graphics about psychological concepts for colleagues in therapy, social work, and counseling using winsome cartoons, doodles, diagrams, and a spare use of language.\n\nTake the example of Bramanâs image we feature here:\n\nOne senses that Braman is a visual note taker who learns through spatial relationships more than through an overabundance of language. They translate their professional learnings, whether through readings, professional workshops, or even podcasts (as in the example below), into these notes. Many of us âand our patients, clients, and family members, too â are also visual learners, and becoming increasingly so in this social media era. Very likely, more conceptual material stands to benefit from this sort of high-quality translation (much more than a saccharine meme), into a visual progression of thought and thinking, using space as one of the media to make key distinctions in ways that conventionally thickly printed language cannot.\n\nYou have to judge for yourself whether Bramanâs understanding and representation of the concepts is faithful to the original, since it is at least one level removed from its source. (I have the sense, though, that Braman would be open to the dialogue.)\n\nWhile the illustration above describes the formation of anxiety out of suppressed emotions and its bodily correlates, hereâs a contrasting one that functions as a living worksheet:\n\nIf you join Bramanâs Patreon for $5/month (which I did a couple of months ago to support their work), you gain access to truly constructive tools that illustrate many of the concepts youâre trying either to understand yourself or to teach your clients. Several of these, like the ones above, are worksheets that you can print and use. They will create delight as well as some mental structure around moments of healing.\n\nEven richer than that, perhaps, Bramanâs example can open your own mind about what sorts of both joy and utility you can create, simply by letting your own gifts out of the closet and using them in your work, in recognizing that, if a therapist/doodler can connect two passions, so can you.\n\nCheck here for the next THE HUMAN JOURNEY (THJ) Certified Conductor Training that will be available to the public. Weâre also offering tailored in-house trainings for institutions.\n\nYour own âjourneyâ professionally will also benefit from your growth as a THJ Conductor in our training. Consider this: If you know you are good with individuals but have never facilitated groups, or if you have an soulful dimension that youâd love to be able to open up in your work with patients and clients, training with us has these professional development benefits that come along with the territory of learning to conduct THE HUMAN JOURNEY Experience.\n\nAnd wouldnât it be splendid to experience your professional development as something even more than a tool, but a way that opens your heart as it speaks to theirs?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

But even in the midst of being laid up with a bad back or during that excruciating moment after surgery when you realize that, no, it isnât that the operation was a breeze, itâs just that you had really good painkillers, there are almost always parts of you that do feel well: theyâre just a bit harder to access. Even when everything is going smoothly.\n\nMany of us are hardly aware of our bodies when theyâre feeling well â one reason we may run them into the ground through overindulgence or lack of attention. But when something is painful, most of us tend to actually get a sensation of pain.\n\nRetired nurse (now coach) Jack Hopkins published on social media some of the techniques he used to assess patients in pain and to provide them with comfort care that actually eased their perception of pain, resulting in what he held was a 15-20% reduction in the pain medication they would require after his shift or in contrast with the shift preceding his.\n\nWhat Hopkins did was to transpose the commonly used pain scale, which asks patients to associate the pain they are experiencing with a number from one to 10. (When Iâve been the target of one of these demands to rate my pain on a numeric scale, I always felt as though I were being asked to translate a cuneiform text into pig latin: just did not compute.) Rather than ask for a pain number, Hopkins would ask for a comfort number: how did this moment of comfort compare with the the scale of of the most and least comfort his patient had experienced in the past?\n\nThrough Hopkinsâs âreverse pain level assessment,â he reinforced a different set of associations, memories of comfort and ease in the body as well as, likely, moments that surrounded those memories that were pleasant emotionally and in all kinds of sensory ways. No doubt, remembering the absence of pain and the presence of comfort is more demanding â especially when youâre in pain â but it both distracts and conjures up memories that can have some of the same physiological effects on the body when recalled as when first experienced.\n\nHopkins had a second technique, one perhaps youâve seen before in some form. He used verb tense very consciously in his questions to patients about their pain. While doctors would brush into patient rooms and typically ask about the pain they are having, Hopkins would set his questions to patients about their pain in the past tense, inquiring instead about the pain they âhave had,â rather than the pain they are currently in.\n\nWith this subtle adjustment, he opened space for patients to perceive their pain, at least in part, as behind them, rather than as that thing so present they couldnât see anything else. As he helped them âsculpt their inner life,â as he put it, Hopkins opened patients up to a way of seeing that could tolerate ambiguity, offering a more nuanced sense of the present moment, which arguably would make whatever pain is present easier to bear.\n\nFor the patient suffering with profound bone pain, tolerating ambiguity could open her to interpersonal and sensory pleasures that, along with medication, could also reduce her perception of pain, not erasing pain but making it in many ways easier to bear, much as we do with families facing serious diagnosis, anticipatory grief, and loss.\n\nJoin us in one of our 2023 trainings to learn how families facing challenging circumstances can learn to tolerate the pain they are in via our smartly social means of deepening the family bonds, the ability to hear each other at the level of values, and shifting perspective.\n\nI welcome you!

Woman with Lorgnette.\n\nHave you noticed that, after youâve changed your hair style, youâre doubly conscious of everyone elseâs hair choices â and may even be more likely to compliment them on theirs)? Itâs called the Baader-Meinhof illusionâor, more commonly, as the frequency illusion.\n\nMy latest version of this particular illusion stems from my being in the market for new glasses. So, when I joined with members of the Chicago Death Doulas collective to tour the International Museum of Surgical Science, and we passed through a room devoted to the history of eyewear, I had to return after the tour â bypassing glitzier attractions such as the foot x-ray machine to ensure proper shoe fit, the iron lung, the array of refined surgical tools, and the artwork displaying what surgery looked like with early anesthetics.\n\nThe museumâs Optical History room housed eighteenth-century spectacles with giant wooden (!) frames; spectacles that stayed on by hugging the nose (pince-nez) and were folded up when not in use; the first 18th century glasses to have arms that wrapped over the ears; and early 20th century aviator goggles that stayed on the head by means of an elastic band.\n\nThere were glasses that required constant work, and itâs here that my attention rested.\n\nThe lorgnette, like that held by the woman in the painting above by Karel HlÃ¡vaÄzek, had to be held up to the eyes by an attached handle or wand, and so it required maximum participation by its wearer. (Youâve probably seen a lorgnette in a play or movie.) Indeed, the lorgnette was treated more as a fashion accessory and a marker of class status than as ongoing vision correction. (After all, you canât cook or teach school if one hand is seriously busy trying to help you see.) Used to discretely check out other attendees at the theater or opera, as well as to see the stage action, the lorgnette was a sign of discriminating taste.\n\nFrom the perspective of an onlooker, the lorgnette signals the conscious effort to see well. Youâre never not conscious of that ladyâs attempt to see (since the lorgnette was used by women, for whom it was regarded as unseemly to be seen wearing actual spectacles).\n\nNaturally, I referred this back to THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ®. Most people, I would hazard, consider themselves good listeners, and others less good listeners than themselves. Indeed, if people could enroll those close to them in classes on âHow to Become a Better Listener,â there wouldnât be enough experts to teach them!\n\nWhat the lorgnette is to glasses, THE HUMAN JOURNEY is to listening. Not only do we help families listen to each other at a moments of intense change due to serious illness, end of life, bereavement, or other major life transition, but we help family members perceive that they are being heard. Itâs in that perception that âTHJâ really finds its power. Itâs there that the tears tend to flow, and Iâm sure that, intuitively, you know why.\n\nâThe participants were very deeply attuned to each other by the end of the first act. There was a noticeable shift in the serious way they all held space for each other.\n\nJoin us to learn to learn the THJ method, to license to use our materials, and to be able to present yourself as a certified THJ Conductor.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

Onsite in a good-sized gymnasium at the district, it was a welcome shock to be in person in a large working group once again. Iâd wanted to do something a bit different this year, guessing â as it turned out, correctly â that the role shifts for educators over the course of these last few eventful years has never been fully acknowledged, much less processed, in the course of the nationwide crisis that put such pressure on them.\n\nLost in the increased and altered demands on them, administrators hadnât had time or attention, perhaps, to help the teachers reckon with the significant changes in their professional roles. So I wanted to create a structure within which they could:\n\nName those roles or âhatsâ they have had to adopt;\n\nExplore their relationship to all the hats they wear;\n\nMake the hats they wear now feel more choosable; and\n\nExperience a gentle yoga practice that would give them a physical experience beyond role altogether.\n\nTeachersâ jobs were notable because of the ways in which the pandemic first altered, and then kept altering in fresh ways, their relationship to the public and to students. These educators and social service providers were like other professionals Iâd worked with during the pandemic â trying to function on the front line while dealing with some of the same anxieties and losses that their own students, clients, patients were. They were isotragic (not a word, but letâs use it) â in a constant state of trying to function as if they were only the providers rather than also those who needed help.\n\nItâs from these kinds of situations that my grief groups for frontline organizational staff members arose during the pandemic. While national focus has gone to the healthcare workers who sacrificed so much during the pandemic and yet continued to serve other families, educators, community service workers, and many other institutional workers also had to do heavy emotional lifting of others as they suffered the same losses and many, like the educators I had the opportunity to work with last month, transitioned into this theoretically easier period weâre in now without acknowledgment.\n\nYet, as one of the teachers brought up â and others agreed â in a way, this period has its own real challenges, too: their roles have absorbed everything they had to do before, plus everything they also took on during the pandemic and now still do â and they wear all those hats while thereâs been a flight from the field by all those who burned out or couldnât take on the additional health risks. With less help and more responsibility, theyâve been trying to adjust to a vastly altered landscape of what it means to do the work they entered the field to do.\n\nThe grief groups have helped frontline educators and social service providers both learn about grief and learn and practice ways to relate helpfully to colleaguesâ and clientsâ heightened grief over the past few years in the isotragic environments in which they work. And they have started workers on ways to create the more compassionate work environments for grievers that are so needed.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

A painting can stir, a pop song can move, a film can â despite any best efforts â make us sob.\n\nWorks of art create discernible emotions, ones to which words correspond and bodily sensations can be measured.\n\nAwe has a place it tends to show up in the body. Being touched or moved is felt more pointedly in the heart area than does either surprise or amazement. And, as in an artistic encounter, through the THJ Experience, participants are changed physically by what they see and hear â and by what they, to their own amazement sometimes â hear and experience themselves saying.\n\nTheir empathy âburnsâ broadly across their chests when participants hear what sorrows their mother has been carrying for such a long time or the fears she has, even needlessly, for her children.\n\nParticipants are touched or moved and may be feel a very specific sensation in the heart areas as their brother, who normally doesnât like to talk about his feelings, recalls and represents through just his facial expression what he felt at a time he was worried for his sonâs life.\n\nAnd one could say that joy â one of the most consistently modeled emotions in the Finnish study on the bodily experience of artistic emotion â makes participantsâ hearts widen, even in the midst of one of the most challenging times of their lives, as, toward the end of THE HUMAN JOURNEY Experience, they co-create a future with their loved ones and make a vow for their future together.\n\nJust look how brightly joy burns in the image above. Itâs that joy that makes of the sad moment a group may be experiencing a bittersweet one â¦ one in which they can experience the sweetness and their strength as well as the pain.\n\nBecause THJ is a cauldron for group transformation that melts hearts toward each other.\n\nThrough the course of the experience and increasingly by the end, THE HUMAN JOURNEY gives our participants â most of whom we catch at a moment of suffering, when they are crying out for care and connection â a surprise gift that brings the THJ Experience to a natural-feeling closure.\n\nThat gift is the fresh understanding that the artistic emotions they have been drawn to feel over the course of the THJ Experience â the beauty of each otherâs characters; the empathy to know that, even though their journeys have been different, their siblings have experienced things that bring their story together âare completed in the knowledge that the final art work thatâs being shown to them â¦ is themselves.\n\nI developed THE HUMAN JOURNEY out of my understanding that discovering the coherence in the themes, images, symbols, and figures in oneâs life heals in just the way that art heals. Each participant makes meaning through the THJ Experience on their own terms, to their own spiritual lights. And suddenly they, as well as their family, seem to make sense.\n\nThey themselves are the novel, the film, the painting that holds together, whose pieces connect the past and the present moment, while pointing to a future they can see enough now to take the hand of their fellow participants and start out.\n\nPlease join us for our next training. This is the perfect time to register, prepare to receive your Conductorâs Kit and Guidebook, and ready yourself for a memorable adventure that will equip you to help families and support groups, in their times of life crisis and loss, melt their hearts toward each other.\n\nP.S.

It can feel like an accusation, like an invasion of privacy, or like a completely irrelevant question, depending on oneâs method of conception, key relationships, or plan for childrearing. Even in days when there were fewer methods for conceiving a child or for avenues for getting one to adulthood, Emily Post might have advised just to stick with a hearty congratulations.\n\nAll that stuck in my mind as I read a fatherâs bemused, delighted, but also partially baffled telling of something that happened when he was tucking his toddler daughter into bed one night. She reached her arms up around his neck for one last goodnight kiss and then, wriggling more securely under the covers, smiled up at him and said, âYouâre the best daddy I ever had.â It certainly caused him some reflection after she was long asleep.\n\nItâs intriguing to take that literally. So, who were the other daddies? (Bear with me; weâre going on a journey.)\n\nThe Possibility of Multiples\n\nI decided to go down this rabbit hole for a while just to have a bit of a fantastical exploration. Recently, I became aware of the intriguing decades-long work done, up to his death in 2007, by psychiatrist Dr. Ian Stevenson. Founding the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Stevenson had had an early-career interest in psychosomatic medicine. His later research into medical cases that neither genetics nor environment seemed to explain took him down the road of exploring whether, without committing to a âbeliefâ in the phenomenon, reincarnation could be the best explanation we have thus far for diseases that didnât yield to any other apparent cause. Stevenson ended up spending decades examining cases that were âsuggestive of reincarnation,â without ever committing himself to a notion that such a phenomenon exists or is the operative explanatory structure for phenomena that could not otherwise be explained. (One of the hardest-to-explain phenomena is that all of this was able to take place under the auspices of a medical school, one of our most conservative academic fixtures.)\n\nBoth Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker, Stevensonâs protÃ©gÃ©, now the current director of the Division for Perception Studies, focused on children who recounted details of previous lives. Because the Division received hundreds of times more cases than the ones they could research in any depth, it has focused its resources on cases where there was some physical evidence that could not otherwise be explained by fraud, parental influence, or any other factors and yet bore some connection to a verifiable aspect of the childâs memory. A rare placement of a congenital deformity or birth defect in the exact place of the gunshot wound that took the âpreviousâ life. A case of âresponsive xenoglossy,â in which a child has the ability, without any possible explanation for having learned it naturally, to speak another language. A lot of mind-blowing stuff!\n\nChildren who relate aspects of previous lives tend to lose the details as they enter school age even as they forget memories of their immediate early childhood, perhaps as these memories are cleared out to make way for new learning. And yet, if reincarnation exists, somehow biographical memories get stored in something that transcend the individual lifetime. And that something in a sense is the ancestor of anything that happens in the current lifetime. It makes the existence of a âbest daddyâ something to ponder.\n\nSo, who's the best daddy in THE HUMAN JOURNEY?\n\nBack to whoâs the best daddy.\n\nIs it the immediate, biological daddy who tucked the girl in?\n\nItâs easy to see the ways in which we are children of the conditions into which we were born, the gifts with which we were endowed, and our biological and cultural parents, whoever they may be. The first two sections of the THJ Experience trace these connections and draw out the gratitude, awe, and shared history, memories, and resources that bind groups together.\n\nâThe child is the father of the manâ\n\nRemember this Wordsworth line, though, from your school days? You can imagine that, as an adult, you can also be the offspring or outcomes of yourself as a child (or, really, at any time in the past)âin other words, a product of the choices you make as you go along.\n\nIn many ways, the middle section of THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® plays this view out as we move from memory to responsibility. The child becomes âthe father of the manâ as the THJ Experience turns its focus to the interplay among each participantâs choices in life, the character that is formed by those choices, and the spiritual points of view they adopt.\n\nWhether or not you go so far as to believe in multiple lifetimes, itâs a bit of a mind stretch to imagine even that, from moment to moment, we are birthing the next instantiation of ourselves, making decisions that will certainly impact what comes next, and effecting judgments now that will serve as the foundation for later ones. We keep birthing ourselves.\n\nAny more daddies?\n\nBy Act III of the THJ Experience, a whole new âdaddyâ emerges. Act III takes the threads of what has transpired in this transformative event to weave something new for the future of the family or support group. So whoâs the âdaddyâ of each participant, or of the group, by the time the Experience reaches its conclusion? (One we herald as being pretty reliable in getting groups to a place of deeper connectedness, groundedness, and capacity for listening for values.)\n\nItâs not just the biological parents. Itâs not just the person one once has been. Itâs something more ineffable than a person or perhaps even a soul or spirit that transcends lifetimesâand yet itâs key. Itâs the literal group moment in which Act III takes place, the challenge it presents to the participants to bring to life a future that can allow each of them to become within the group organism that they are co-creating. That group, in the moment in which the THJ Conductor holds them, have all the parental power possible to enact and commit to a future that sustains the group forward.\n\nWeâd love to prepare you to take groups anticipating or experiencing a loss, recovering from substance abuse, or seeking a way forward from any major transition through this Experience that uses the âdaddiesâ they know to become, from the alchemy of the group, the ancestor of their future. Itâs a beautiful thing to orchestrate and you do experience, along with the participants, the new group self that emerges. Join us to learn how to bring this experience to your patients, clients, and families.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

She was drowning in meeting othersâ needs.\n\nRecently, the New York Times put its finger on a different kind of relationship crisis: so much physical and psychical togetherness that, again, it became hard for a married woman to find herself. The story suggested that apparently, again, led more by women than by men, a movement to live apart while remaining married and in an expressly loving relationship had a discernible uptick in 2021.\n\nThe âliving apart togetherâ trend had already been noticed by demographers with relation to older people who had been divorced or widowed, wanted to be in a relationship, but preferred to maintain independent households.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, the proportion of married couples who lived apart grew by 25%. And it began to rise again in 2021, possibly (the Times speculates) because of the pandemic and its concomitant rise in caregiving and schooling demands, alongside work, on wives and mothers.\n\nThe women the story profiled decided to live temporarily, and while remaining in contact with their husbands, in their own places, as one said, âremember[ing] who I am by myself, remember[ing] what I like doing by myself.â\n\nSeeing the whole picture that has you in it\n\nThe two versions of women leaving home differ in clear ways.\n\nOne version is permanent, aims to sever relationship and the old sense of home; the other is temporary, maintains relationship, and includes a return. Its success as an experiment depends on ostranenie, remembering oneself, while being able to see anew both a loved one, and oneâs relationship to (in these cases) him. It becomes urgent when your habitual ways of seeing and relating have obscured the emergent reality of the human being you live with.\n\nHow do you embrace and continue to commit to a picture unless you can see it first, and then keep seeing it as it changes?\n\nThe phenomenon of living apart together is of course only available to those who can make an expensive arrangement work economically. And not everybody has to move out to see their family member as if for the first time â an experience of ostranenie that can feel like permission for that person to be themselves and to keep on growing.\n\nValuing the commitment to allow the other person to continue to grow, and for roles to evolve and change, you need a jolt so that you can see the person youâve seen 1,002 times, the 1,003rd time as if for the first.\n\nDespite what they think, people don't already know.\n\nProfessionally, when you work with your clients, patients, or congregants, their families, and with the support groups you lead, you are continually working against their belief they already know who everyone else in the group is, that their existing judgments are true now and forever.\n\nPowerful experiences work much more effectively and lastingly than mere verbal reminders.\n\nWhen offered as an experience for families or groups dealing with serious illness, loss, or a life change such as the recognition of the need to recover from addiction, THE HUMAN JOURNEY actively moves participants into a state of ostranenie, both with respect to every other person in the group and â perhaps even more significantly â with themselves.\n\nNo, they donât end up a freaked-out mess, not recognizing anyone and shattering into 1,000 shards! They see the vulnerability and fragility of each other person, the ways in which they are creating themselves in every moment. And they release a fixed sense of themselves in the process.\n\nThus, when they find home again, it is the one that grants the freedom to every other grieving, or struggling, or growing participantâto be who they are. And the group support they find there is offered to the person they are becoming, day by day.\n\nCertification training to conduct THE HUMAN JOURNEY Experience will enable you to bring families and groups facing grief, serious illness, addiction, and other life transitions together. This tool sets them up to carry what they gained from the experience forward, into listening consistently to each other for values, supporting each other through loss and change from whatever each personâs spiritual perspectives may be, and finding meaning through hard times.\n\nWe are doing a limited number of public Conductor Trainings in 2023. Register here to be included. We limit spaces to allow for personal attention and mentoring.\n\nMay today be a day of seeing as if for the first time.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

Just a creature.\n\nWhen youâre grieving, you miss the physical presence of the person you lost â the size of their hand in yours, the quality of moistness or warmth that skin held. Your body curls into itself in loss. Itâs hard to eat or sleep â¦ or youâre eating or sleeping too much. What you need may not be to talk but to receive physical comforts, which can vary according to the individual, just as learning styles do.\n\nHere's why the Creature Comforts Checklist works:\n\nIt frees people who are grieving of the need to find the words.\n\nIt helps them get the social support they need in healing â support that is already around them and willing, but confused or shy about where to start.\n\nAnd it allows those who love them to offer healing care, building relational bonds for the future. Let me know how the Checklist works for your clients, patients, and perhaps even friends!\n\nWe'd be happy to send you your own PDF copy of the \"CCC\" so you can copy the worksheet for use in your practice or give copies of it to a grieving friend.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.

Just a bit of momentary drama to set the stage. Itâs a medical show. Someone is having an anxiety attack. Maybe heâs hyperventilating.\n\nThe medical professional or first responder fixes her eyes on this (typically) mouth breather and says emphatically and slowly, âFollow me. Breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth.â\n\nAnd then, in an exaggerated fashion, the medical professional demonstrates, raising her shoulders with the inhalation and looking all better and grounded on each exhalation, as she tries to get the person in crisis in her office or at a crash scene, school, or hospital to mirror her.\n\nSomehow, within three of these breaths, the person is miraculously back to normal.\n\nIs that all there is?\n\nBreath can do a lot more for you besides anxiety management.\n\nBreath control is the secret sauce of changing your emotional state. You can raise your basic energy level, focus your attention, or even feel more attuned with those around you by the breath pattern you adopt.\n\nJoining in with, or matching, anotherâs breath rhythm is so powerful that (for better or worse) itâs taught as a sales technique in methods like the controversial Neuro-Linguistic Programming of the 1970s.\n\nWhen invited during our Conductor training with coming up with a ritual for introducing THE HUMAN JOURNEYÂ® Experience and drawing it to a distinct close, Pam Lewis suggested something sheâs used quite a bit in her organizational consulting work in South Africa. Pam invites participants to breathe themselves âintoâ the circle of participation and then, to demarcate the return to everyday life, to breathe themselves âoutâ of the circle again. She demonstrated the circular gesture she used to reinforce the direction of breathing, emphasizing breath as our mode of exchange (as it is!) between ourselves and the world around us.\n\nI have enjoyed teaching workshops to teachers and professionals who work with young people with special needs about how to use breath and yoga sequences that specifically either raise energy, focus attention, calm the spirit, or allow us to join with others more smoothly. In their struggle to do what a less-than-adaptive world asks of them, students with special needs, like all of us, can be out of sync with the demands of them.\n\nThink focus, energize, unify as well as calm.\n\nI have enjoyed teaching workshops to teachers and professionals who work with young people with special needs about how to use breath and yoga sequences that specifically either raise energy, focus attention, calm the spirit, or allow us to join with others more smoothly. In their struggle to do what a less-than-adaptive world asks of them, students with special needs, like all of us, can be out of sync with the demands of them.\n\nExperiment, and you'll see.\n\nIf you start âplayingâ your breath, you quickly discover that it works a lot like an instrument! Your breath has:\n\ndifferent possibilities for proportions (duration) between inhalations and exhalations\n\nsound and silence (how sounded or noiseless it isâyouâll know what I mean if you sleep next to someone who snores!)\n\nplacement in the body (from high in the throat, to middle of the chest, to low in the belly, and even toward the back of the body)\n\nease and resistance\n\nregularity and erraticness\n\ncontinuity and stoppage (moments in which youâre neither inhaling nor exhaling)\n\nand\n\nchannel, that old âin through the nose and out through the mouth.â\n\nThere are other dimensions to breath, of course, as well!\n\nThough I donât recommend it necessarily, you can give yourself something that mimics aspects of a panic attack by playing with a few of these variables. But you can also go beyond in through the nose, out through the mouth to relax.\n\nSimply by experimenting for yourself with just one of these dimensions of breath, you can bring calm to yourself or to someone else by lengthening the exhalations (even if through the nose), regularizing breathing (offering counted inhales and exhales), or focusing on breathing low into the belly.\n\nThe breath is a magnificent instrument for altering our state of being and for connecting us with others, as Pam showed by making breath the centerpiece of her ritual for joining a family prior to taking part in THE HUMAN JOURNEY.\n\nThe challenge of using breathing to help others is not what to do with it, but helping people feel comfortable enough socially to deal with its intimate power.\n\nInvite gently.\n\nAn intimate experience, THE HUMAN JOURNEY is invitational, never pushing people in difficult circumstances to go beyond their comfort levels (including being as vulnerable as others are evidently willing to be). Rather, it is about creating a space to work with a family or group of people who, possibly stressed, guarded, and isolated from each other, can breathe across the space and find each other againâor perhaps for the first time.\n\nCertification training to conduct THE HUMAN JOURNEY Experience will enable you to bring families and groups facing grief, serious illness, addiction, and other life transitions together.

They might jerk still suddenly, their eyes wide and long, like old cartoon figures in a haunted house or a dark cave, when all you could see was the eyes.\n\nThatâs part of the joy of being around children, watching new understandings transform their faces when theyâve discovered not everyone believes the same things about God, or their parents had embarrassing habits when they were kids, or their friendsâ parents let them color on the walls.\n\nMy teaching has mostly been of adults and I find it especially precious â perhaps because itâs rarer â to watch a big shift in perception happen with adults.\n\nThe kinds of shifts adults get seem to be of the fleeting, though recursive, kind. In my own experience, even when I suddenly see things in a wholly fresh way, the recognition might be gone again in an instant, and Iâm back (despite my best intentions) in my habitual way of thinking.\n\nAnd then I get to have the same ârevelationâ again some years later, in a kind of pleasant Groundhog Day reenactment.\n\nIn THE HUMAN JOURNEY (THJ) Conductor Trainings, thereâs been one concept around which Iâve been particularly enjoying watching it take place.\n\nSeeing the Big Shift During Conductor Training\n\nThatâs when we talk about framing our language and refer to the harder experiences of life not as âbadâ nor as a âproblem,â but rather as âhard to bearâ or âpainful.â\n\nThe need to start doing this comes up almost immediately in giving participants a THJ Experience, since the first activity for participants involves identifying the conditions into which each was born. Some of the Conditions might at first be universally regarded as tougher to bear â such as having a parent with a mental illness. Some seem on their face universally more pleasant, such as having dinner as a family every night. (Depends, of course.) And some seem more evidently to depend on the meaning the individual ascribes to the condition, being the oldest sibling, for example.\n\nPerhaps âbadâ and âpainfulâ sound the same at first, but the distinction matters. When we label an event objectively bad, we resist and harden against it. That of course doesnât change the event and it may contribute to making it even harder to bear!\n\nBut when we label it in terms of its effect on us (âhard to bear,â etc.), we acknowledge our difficulty without resisting what is happening, whether we want it to or not. Doing this may alter our black and white thinking about events, and our point of view at THJ is that it can make harder events actually easier to bear. If we can refrain from ascribing what seem like objective judgments to them, the hardest events of our lives â like watching a loved one die or reckoning with grief â can come with an acknowledgment of the pain involved but without the sense that âthis shouldnât be happening.â It is happening.\n\nOur thinking, as revealed in our language, is so deeply embedded in us, though! THJ Conductor trainees tend to be sensitive souls, seekers of soul and peace and imbued with the desire to share their growth with others. And yet, and yet â it takes them a while before they stop returning to speaking of the hard things of life as âbadâ and experience the conceptual leap that makes hard events just hard events, even though theyâre painful.\n\nItâs that understanding that we hope will widen participantsâ eyes when they go through the toughest life experiences. Itâs not that these things donât happen. Theyâre not necessarily a âtragedyâ and they break our hearts. That distinction may just be the thing that enables us to get through them.\n\nTheyâre hard. Weâve gotten through hard times before. We just need to remember how.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEnd of Life\n\nThe Incredible Will to Sing\n\nThe will to make it to a loved oneâs graduation or wedding, or to the birth of a new baby, somehow compels the body to obey the will.
