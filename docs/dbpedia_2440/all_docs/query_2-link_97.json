        "text": "A fast and easy way to add a cinematic look to your renders\n\nIf you want to obtain photorealistic images, rich in contrast or with a more cinematic color correction, when working with Linear WorkFlow (LWF), it becomes essential to use post-production tools such as Photoshop, Nuke or After Effects.\n\nThis pack of free LUTs is designed for linear render engines like Vray, Corona Render, Octane render, FStorm Render, etc. It will allow you to obtain a more photorealistic look directly in the Virtual Frame Buffer of your engine without having to open your post-production software, this will allow you to work much faster and will also give you a preview of how will it look after post-production, something very useful during the Look-Dev process. You can also use them in post-production to replicate the behavior of several photography films.\n\nThis pack has been included in the 1.5 version of Corona Render, as part of the render engine, and it has been very popular in the community."
