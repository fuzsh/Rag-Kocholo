As visible in the project photos, the project has been finished in an eye-catching ‚Äòcopper‚Äô colour, which was unique to this design. Working closely with supply chain partner, AkzoNobel, the Sotech team developed the project specific paint to resemble a weathered steel, giving the fa√ßade a unique and dynamic look. AkzoNobel‚Äôs UK and Ireland Specification Manager, Naveen Sandhu, explained: ‚ÄúWe were presented with a unique challenge by the KSS Architects team, whereby the cladding design intent sought to create a futuristic look and feel whilst still embracing the traditions of the club‚Äôs Thai owners. ‚ÄúA warm and earthy tone was desired, but one which was able to achieve certain characteristics, namely the ability to subtly change in tone based on exposure to different daylight conditions. ‚ÄúOur expert in-house formulators devised a multi-faceted copper metallic effect, backed with a super durable polyester backbone. Copper is traditionally viewed as a lucky colour in Thailand. The resulting finish not only elevates the myriad of components across the complex, but the enhanced durability technology which underpins it ensures it will do so for many years to come.‚Äù The final project, with its curved design to blend in with its rural setting, features 11 full-size training pitches, eight smaller pitches, five training grids, two goalkeeping areas and a pitch for the club‚Äôs academy sides with a 499-seater stand. The main training centre building includes 35 bedrooms so players can stay at the site. Jamie Brown, Business Development Manager at Sotech said: ‚ÄúThe finish is striking. Knowing what went into making it possible makes it even more impressive to consider.‚Äù Scott James Richardson, Architectural Facade Design Technician at Sotech, noted: ‚ÄúI was proud to be part of this project. I‚Äôm not a Leicester City football fan but when I hear it mentioned in passing on the radio or TV it's hard not to take notice‚Äù.
