The expansive house at 88 Garden Street in Cambridge went up in 1810, making it one of the oldest standalone residences in the city.

It was originally constructed at the corner of Garden and Linnaean streets amid the old Harvard Botanical Garden, and then moved to its current spot a little farther out along Garden at Madison Street.

Nicknamed the Asa Gray House after the famed 19th-century botanist who lived there while teaching at Harvard, it was expanded over the centuries and unfolds today to just over 6,000 square feet. That includes five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms as well as six fireplaces and a library.

All of this—plus the location a short jaunt from Harvard Square—means that the house doesn’t come at all cheap: It’s asking $5.75 million, or $956 a square foot, through Coldwell Banker’s Gail Roberts-Ed Feijo Team.

Interestingly, the cabinetry in the family room and that front staircase are historically protected. So know that going in.
