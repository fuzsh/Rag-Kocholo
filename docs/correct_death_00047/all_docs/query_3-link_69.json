        "text": "Mount Auburn Cemetery, in Cambridge MA, is recognized as one of the most significant designed landscapes in the country. This beautiful park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nWe invite you to join Madeline Klyne and others in the CIMC community for a Sunday afternoon mindful walk at Mount Auburn Cemetery. This is a unique opportunity to connect with Dharma friends and meet other practitioners. We will walk, talk, listen, and enjoy seeing fall unfold in this unique and beautiful landscape, mindfully.\n\nWalking in small or large groups, we may feel what a delight it is to be walking together with community. We can open our ears to the sounds around us, and lift our eyes to enjoy the trees, the flowers, the birds and the people near us. Surrounded by gravestones and monuments, attentive and aware of our senses, we can recollect the preciousness of our lives in the present moment. With mindfulness, each step can be nourishing. With our CIMC community each step can be healing.\n\nPractitioners, partners, children, and friends. Everyone is welcome.\n\nLocation: Mount Auburn Cemetery, 580 Mount Auburn St, Cambridge"
