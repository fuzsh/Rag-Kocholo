        "text": "France Marie (Waithe) Bernat\n\nBusinesswoman, Civic Advocate, Friend\n\nThe daughter of Barbadian immigrants Winston E. and Gwendolyn (Jackman) Waithe, Frances Marie Waithe was born on March 25, 1934 at Boston Lying-in Hospital. She was the eldest of three children and the only girl. Living with the family on Williams Street in Roxbury, she attended Boston public schools—the Asa Gray School, the Lafayette School, the Hyde School and Girls’ High School. After high school, she studied to become a radiologic technologist, becoming the first registered Black x-ray technician in Massachusetts---a pioneer in a new field.\n\nThe Roxbury community of her youth was close-knit, particularly amongst Bajan family and neighbors. That nurturing environment of her home community was her foundation and set the pattern for the rest of her life. It was there that the bonds of friendship were formed with her “chosen” sisters—longtime friends Elaine Hampton and Elma Lewis.\n\nIn the 1960s, despite segregation and racial conflicts across the city, the South End’s jazz enclaves were places where people of all ethnicities mingled freely. While out for the evening at Morley’s Jazz Club (a.k.a “the Big M”), Frances and Edward Bernat, the son of Hungarian Jewish immigrants, caught each other’s eyes; sparks were lit and their decades-long relationship began almost immediately. They married in December 1967. The couple settled first in Cambridge, and later in Weston, where they purchased land and built a Colonial Revival house, designed by Royal Barry Wills. The residence became a welcoming place for extended family, friends, and associates. It was the center for holidays, frequent dinner parties, and entertainment. There, they navigated stigma, racism, and prejudice with courage, deep conviction, and unwavering love.\n\nAlways stylishly and impeccably dressed, Frances’ interest in fashion and business savvy extended to their family business, Garland and DSB, a string of clothing stores throughout Massachusetts. She would become Vice President of Design. Her creativity was integral to the growth and success of the company. In the 1980s the Bernats acquired FilterFlo, which became a SOMBA- certified company that manufactured industrial filters. She was company CEO. Frances travelled to major fashion hubs in the U.S. and Europe, attending international fashion shows. She served on the panel of judges for the 1977 Miss Massachusetts pageant and was also a member of The Fashion Group International. This organization formed to foster a widening awareness of women’s critical roles in the American fashion industry.\n\nAs a businesswoman, Frances was an adherent to diversity, inclusion, and equity, long before they became popular buzzwords. Her civic engagement was legendary and included the Coalition of One Hundred Black Women, The Links Inc, The Cambridge YMCA, the National Center of Afro-American Artists (NCAAA) and the Winsor School. With NCAAA, she became involved in the seasonal production of Langston Hughes’ “Black Nativity.” Her collaborations with Miss Lewis were integral to the planning and execution of the artistic and educational endeavor.\n\nA lifelong Democrat, Frances took voting very seriously, only once registering as a Republican, to vote for U.S. Senator Edward W. Brooke during a primary. She contributed both time and money to campaigns and causes in which she believed\n\nGifted with an irrepressible joie de vivre, sophistication, and generosity as a daughter, sister, mother, niece, cousin, wife, grandmother, and friend, Frances was chosen as a godmother, second mother, honorary aunt and grandmother to the children of her many dear friends. One role that she held in high esteem, perhaps above all else, was the role of great grandmother to Langston David Waithe. When they were together, the sanctity of this meeting of the eldest and the youngest was beyond palpable.\n\nHigh fashion was not her only sweet spot. She was also high spirited—if not the life of a party, Frances was always near the center. She loved to dance with abandon— and did so even in her later years, aided by a cane or walker!\n\nShe cared lovingly for her husband Edward as his health declined from a degenerative neurological disease until his death in 1990. In July 2009, while headed to Paris, Frances suffered a near-fatal brain aneurysm. She woke up again the next day, and many times again-- re-engaging with her social life at events far and wide, not to be held down or robbed of joy, laughter, or curiosity. She died peacefully on February 10, 2020.\n\nPredeceased by her parents, siblings, and her eldest son, Lawrence D. Waithe, survivors include her daughter Deborah Bernat of Boston; her son David Bernat and his partner Liesl Rockart of Arlington, two granddaughters, Lauren and Lena Waithe, their mother LaVerne Hall, and her great grandson, Langston Waithe. A large cadre of nieces, nephews, cousins, and extended family also mourn her loss and celebrate her well-lived life.\n\nFrances will be remembered as a rare, compassionate friend, well-read and always ready to laugh. For her friends and their children, she was always a booster, who could be counted on to cheer them on. With an unquenchable zest for life, throughout her life, Frances Bernat chose kindness and joy!"
