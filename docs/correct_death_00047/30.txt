“Paper on the wall of the parlor of Grandfather Moses Gray and grandmother Roxana Howard Gray in 1825. The house was on the hillside, second house above the corner leading to the cemetery (Capt. Z. P. Townsend’s house on corner.) called later “The Cobb Place.” The paper was on the wall till after Cousin George Cobb’s death, in the year 1869, when the house was sold. My impression is there were baskets of flowers or fruit alternating with the design on this piece. Take notice that paper in early days was made not in rolls but in square pieces on sheets & joined across the width, as well as lengthwise.

“The house from the walls of which the paper came, was the boyhood home of Dr. Asa Gray [For his bio, click here or here], Botanist of Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass, from his 14th year until after he ‘attained his majority’ he says in the autobiography – i.e. from 1824 to 1835. In the latter year they moved to the Moses Gray Homestead in the village of Sauquoit. The farm was owned by Moses Gray for twelve years or so after 1835, and called “The Other Place.”
