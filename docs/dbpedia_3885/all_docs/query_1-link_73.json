        "text": "LOS ANGELES, United States — Disney/Marvel superhero comedy \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" continued on a record-setting pace this weekend in North American theaters, clawing its way to an imposing $97 million in ticket sales, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Sunday.\n\nThat brings its domestic total to $395.6 million -- for the eighth best second weekend ever, Variety reported -- while international ticket sales were even more impressive, at $428 million.\n\nBuoyed by the popularity of Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool), and his pal Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), the movie has already set a new record for the highest domestic gross for an R-rated feature, a distinction held since 2004 by Mel Gibson's epic drama \"The Passion of the Christ\" ($370 million, not inflation-adjusted).\n\nUniversal's weather thriller \"Twisters\" held tight in second place, taking in $22.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones play storm chasers caught in the middle of fast-converging tornadoes.\n\nIn third was Warner Bros.' new film \"Trap,\" at $15.6 million. Analyst David A. Gross called that \"a soft opening for an M. Night Shyamalan suspense crime thriller,\" adding that reviews and audience scores have been \"lukewarm.\"\n\nJosh Hartnett stars as a serial killer avoiding police while at a concert with his daughter. \"Trap\" was largely self-financed by Shyamalan, whose 1999 blockbuster \"The Sixth Sense\" grossed $673 million.\n\nSlipping one spot to fourth place was Universal animation \"Despicable Me 4,\" at $11.3 million. It has now taken in a total $314 million domestically and $386 million internationally.\n\nAnd in fifth, also down one spot, was Disney's coming-of-age animation \"Inside Out 2,\" at $6.7 million. With a domestic gross of $627 million and an overseas total of $928 million, it is now well past the $1.5 billion mark and stands as the top animated film of all time, according to Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRounding out the top 10 were:"
