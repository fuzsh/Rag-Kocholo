        "text": "10 Things I Hate About You July 6th, 1999 review details\n\nI really enjoyed this, but not quite as much as the Taming of the Shrew play that I saw in Melbourne many years ago.\n\n28 Days June 10th, 2000 imdb\n\nNot too heavy, not too light.\n\n3 Strikes March 3rd, 2000 details trailers\n\nVery silly, but fun. A sad reflection on the LAPD. There are some BIG guys in this movie. I mean HUGE!\n\n8mm April 20th, 1999 review details\n\nDisturbing and captivating. Hard to judge the movie because the material alone is gripping enough. The \"dance with the devil and the devil will change you\" theme was fairly clumsy.\n\nAlmost Famous February 12th, 2001 July 11th, 2001 imdb\n\nYou probably shouldn't listen to anything I have to say about this movie as I'm still convinced that Penny Lane is Billy's sister.\n\nAlong Came a Spider April 8th, 2001 imdb\n\nMorgan Freeman chasing a murderer always makes for an interesting movie.\n\nAmerica's Sweethearts September 17th, 2001 November 9th, 2001 imdb\n\nJohn Cussack and Billy Crystal are great as always...\n\nAmerican Beauty September 26th, 1999 April 3rd, 2000 details trailers\n\nUnexpected, unusual and very well done.\n\nAmerican History X June 8th, 1999 review details\n\nI see a lot of movies and I enjoy most of them. Every now and then though I see a movie which makes the rest just seem like crap. American History X is one of those movies.\n\nAmerican Pie August 27th, 1999 October 30th, 1999 March 27th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nA good quality teen flick that had me laughing the whole time. The American audience didn't quite seem to find it as funny as I did though (Boston). I enjoyed it just as much the second time (Sydney). And the 3rd (Berne, Switzerland).\n\nAnaconda October 6, 1997 review details\n\nI saw this movie at approximately 4am and quite enjoyed it. I'm not sure how it would fair if I was in a more awake state.\n\nAntz November 6, 1998 review details\n\nI enjoyed this film until I saw A Bug's Life. Antz just lacked the Disney touch.\n\nAs Good As It Gets February 21, 1998 review details\n\nGood entertainment. Jack Nicholson is just brilliant.\n\nAnalyse This March 23, 1999 review details\n\nVery funny. Robert De Niro is always good, and the combination with Billy Crystal in this movie is interesting.\n\nAustin Powers 2 June 29th, 1999 review details\n\nMuch funnier than the first one because it didn't try to push every joke quite as far or as long.\n\nBean July 4, 1997 review details\n\nIf you have watched and loved the show then don't see the movie. It is just recycled humour from the television series. The only interesting part is the way we are shown that Mr Bean actually realizes how annoying he is.\n\nBedazzled January 30th, 2001 imdb\n\nSimple, predictable but not terrible.\n\nBeethovens 3rd August 7th, 2000 imdb\n\nI'll watch anything on a 14 hour flight, not sure I would have got through this otherwise.\n\nBeing John Malkovich January 2nd, 2000 review details trailers\n\nVery clever. Does a great job of making a completely unbelievable story line seem possible.\n\nBig Daddy October 15th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nNot up to par with other Adam Sandler films.\n\nThe Big Hit July 7, 1998 review details\n\nA very pleasant surprise. I knew nothing before I went in, after I came out I was recommending it to everyone.\n\nThe Big Lebowski April 25, 1998 review details\n\nThis was really funny. I never realized how perfectly John Goodman would fit a violent militant role.\n\nBilly Elliot April 19th, 2001 imdb\n\nCharming.\n\nBlade October 13, 1998 review details\n\nI knew nothing about this film when I went in. That made it twice as good as it would otherwise have been just from the surprise.\n\nThe Blair Witch Project August 27th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nYou must see this film, I saw it twice. Brilliant.\n\nBlue Streak November 9th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nMartin Lawrence just can't play Eddie Murphy parts as well as Eddie Murphy can.\n\nThe Bone Collector December 7th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nPatchy. An interesting idea that could have been done a lot better.\n\nBoogie Nights February 20, 1998 review details\n\nI would never has guessed that I would enjoy this film. From the ads it seemed like sex, sex and more sex (not that there's anything wrong with that :-). I heard an interview with the director where he said that he wanted to explore with this movie the way porn is something that many people both enjoy and are disgusted by. Overall, the movie just left me feeling sad.\n\nBowfinger September 14th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nGood fun, but not as good as you might expect from all these big name comedians.\n\nBring It On December 19th, 2000 imdb\n\nTrashy, but fun. Strange that cheerleading never took off in Australia. How many dance related movies have we seen over the last few months!\n\nBrokedown Palace August 26th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nInteresting, but it felt tame since I've read a book by an Australian sent to a Thai prison.\n\nA Bug's Life December 13, 1998 review details\n\nAnother clever and fun Disney film, they just always seem to create magical characters. The end credits is definitely the best part.\n\nCan't Hardly Wait September 22, 1998 review details\n\nI'll admit that I saw this just because of Jennifer Love Hewitt. I shouldn't have bothered.\n\nCast Away January 23rd, 2001 imdb\n\nAfter the brilliant plane crash sequence, anyone could be afraid to fly.\n\nThe Castle July 23, 1997 review details\n\nA hilarious movie about a simple Australian family. Somehow the strange and stupid family members manage to win your heart in their quest to protect their \"castle\". I just hope that overseas watchers realize that this is not a typical Australian family, although it's probably not far from the truth.\n\nCelebrity June 12th, 1999 review details\n\nEnjoyable film with a nice twist of fortunes for the characters. Don't be scared off by Leonardo, his role is very small.\n\nCenter Stage October 17th, 2000 imdb\n\nIf you enjoy watching dancing, you'll enjoy this movie. It scared me that I even enjoyed the ballet.\n\nCharlie's Angels December 5th, 2000 imdb\n\nmmmm... Cameron. Great action and lots of funny little references to other shows / films...\n\nChill Factor September 6th, 1999 details\n\nVery predictable, but some nice action sequences.\n\nChocolat February 23rd, 2001 imdb\n\nSimply delicious...\n\nChopper August 17th, 2000 imdb\n\nExtra scary for all of us who have seen the real Chopper interviewed by Elle McFeast.\n\nThe Cider House Rules April 10th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nMoving and gripping.\n\nA Civil Action May 4th, 1999 review details\n\nIt felt a little bit long and slow, but that may just be because it is based on a true story. The statistics and insights into personal injury law were interesting.\n\nA Clockwork Orange November 27th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nThe bashing we saw after the movie made the violence seem a lot more real.\n\nCopland February 3, 1998 review details\n\nThis movie is great for laughing at Sylvester Stallone. He is just such an oaf!\n\nCoyote Ugly January 13th, 2001 imdb\n\nCoyote ugly and the girls in this movie is a bit of a contradiction.\n\nThe Craic May 11th, 1999 review details\n\nI really enjoyed this film laughing out loud a number of times. It was great seeing Australia through the eyes of an Irishman. The barmaid will take your breath away...\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon January 16th, 2001 April 19th, 2001 imdb\n\nI love the new slow-motion / beyond reality fighting effects, but think this movie took them a bit too far. I enjoyed this movie a lot more the second time.\n\nCruel Intentions April 14th, 1999 review details\n\nFelt a bit stupid and slow at the start. By the end the characters become interesting.\n\nThe Cup June 2nd, 2000 imdb\n\nAll this and the final wasn't even a very good game...\n\nDeep Impact June 23, 1998 review details\n\nSome great special effects. I'm a little ashamed to admit that I got a bit choked up at the end.\n\nDelivering Milo July 23rd, 2001 imdb\n\nStrange and stupid.\n\nThe Devil's Advocate January 13, 1998 review details\n\nAn interesting movie. It had me engrossed the whole way.\n\nThe Dinner Game September 26th, 1999; January 16th, 2000 review details\n\nVery, very funny and traumatic at the same time.\n\nThe Dish October 31st, 2000 imdb\n\nFeels good and is a nice way for relatively young people like me to pretend to experience the moon landing.\n\nDoctor Dolittle July 28, 1998 review details\n\nGood fun.\n\nDoctor Dolittle 2 July 17th, 2001 imdb\n\nCute and funny but quickly forgotten.\n\nDog Park September 24th, 1999 details\n\nA cute little romantic comedy.\n\nDolphins April 25th, 2000 details\n\nIt went through the IMAX motions but there was very little really effective footage.\n\nDouble Jeopardy September 25th, 1999 details trailers\n\nInteresting concept but if you've seen the trailer you've basically seen the film.\n\nDown to Earth July 23rd, 2001 imdb\n\nPretty much a waste of time.\n\nEast is East June 20th, 2000 imdb\n\nDon't let the trailer suck you into thinking that this is a comedy.\n\nEdtv June 1st, 1999 review details\n\nGreat movie. Leaves the Truman Show for dead.\n\nElection October 19th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nWonderful characters.\n\nEnd of Days January 13th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nSatan was the only good thing in this movie.\n\nEnemy of the State January 12, 1999 review details\n\nReally enjoyable. Will Smith and Gene Hackman work well together.\n\nEntrapment July 20th, 1999 review details\n\nSean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, something for everyone! Lots of unexpected twists.\n\nErin Brockovich April 7th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nGreat movie. Julia Roberts is fantastic.\n\nEverest July 21, 1998 review details\n\nThe only good IMAX film I have ever seen. Looking over the edge of the precipice on that screen was just breathtaking.\n\nEvolution November 3rd, 2001 imdb\n\nOn a plane, anything is watchable.\n\nExtreme April 10th, 1999 review details\n\nThis movie confirmed my thinking that the great IMAX format is not enough to make a movie good. The focus on extreme sports sounds perfect but many of the shots were so panoramic that you lost perspective on the size of the waves and the slope of the mountains. Some of the scenes were truly spectacular, just not enough of them.\n\nEyes Wide Shut August 12th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nVery interesting movie. Not as weird as I thought it might be. Nicole is very beautiful, especially with curly hair and glasses.\n\nFace/Off September 13, 1997 review details\n\nFantastic. John Travolta and Nick Cage do an amazing job of acting as each other. Nicholas Cage is just perfect for this bad guy role. The prison on the oil rig was also a highlight.\n\nFantasia 2000 April 12th, 2000 details trailers\n\nSaw this in Japanese which made the visual interpretation of the music all the more impressive. I don't think it has the lasting imagery and characters of the original however.\n\nThe Fifth Element October 6, 1997 review details\n\nQuite enjoyable and interesting.\n\nFight Club November 23rd, 1999 review details trailers\n\nUnexpectedly clever...\n\nFinal Destination March 22nd, 2000 details trailers\n\nJumpy but silly.\n\nFinding Forester April 10th, 2001 imdb\n\nWarm and interesting. Also a good escape from 90 school kids cramped into economy on a red eye flight.\n\nForces of Nature May 25th, 1999 review details\n\nFunny and I liked the ending. Sandra Bullock looks particularly cute in those tracksuit pants...\n\nFunny Games August 9, 1998 review details\n\nThe best movie I have ever seen. My friend and I did not speak for 5 minutes after leaving the cinema. You must see this movie.\n\nGalapogas 3D March 29th, 2000 review details\n\nAnother great IMAX experience.\n\nGalaxy Quest May 2nd, 2000 review details trailers\n\nSilly by funny. The aliens were brilliant.\n\nThe Generals Daughter November 16th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nInteresting, but the casting gave away parts of the story.\n\nGladiator May 23rd, 2000 imdb\n\nFilmed in a way that makes you think there is great depth to the characters and story. Unfortunately, there isn't. Russel Crowe is still fantastic.\n\nGo August 11th, 1999 details trailers\n\nI enjoyed the second and third storylines much more than the first. Saw this at a private screening in the city that my friend Joe won.\n\nGods and Monsters July 13th, 1999 review details\n\nAlthough sick, I showed true dedication (read stupidity) and went to the movies. Unfortunately for the first time ever I keep falling asleep in the cinema. I did enjoy the bits I saw though.\n\nGone in Sixty Seconds July 4th, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb\n\nFast.\n\nGood Will Hunting April 3, 1998 review details\n\nI really liked this movie the first time I saw it. The second time though it felt a bit silly. The effect that Matt Daemon's character had on people seemed unrealistic.\n\nGossip October 3rd, 2000 imdb\n\nThe first movie that has left us thinking and prompted conversation for a long time.\n\nGreat Expectations March 28, 1998 review details\n\nEnjoyable story. More enjoyable though was watching Gyneth in this film.\n\nHannibal March 6th, 2001 imdb\n\nI was more chilled by the air conditioning in the cinema than by the movie itself.\n\nHappy, Texas January 8th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nAbsolutely hilarious. A brilliant script.\n\nHigh Fidelity September 26th, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb\n\nSucked on a plane, great in a cinema.\n\nHimalaya May 16th, 2001 imdb\n\nMovies like this are so easy to believe because they are so far removed from my sense of reality.\n\nHollow Man August 13th, 2000 imdb\n\nGood special effects, but I just hate this type of movie.\n\nThe Hurricane April 16th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nGreat story. If only all the Canadians I know were that nice - NOT.\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer December 16, 1997 review details\n\nI lump this in with Scream, etc. Not a type of movie that I enjoy.\n\nAn Ideal Husband August 16th, 1999 details trailers\n\nAn interesting look at human moral values, ethics and the way we judge others. (Airplane movie)\n\nThe Insider January 25th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nI just couldn't get past Russell Crowe looking so old. Amazing story and Al Pacino is great.\n\nJackie Brown March 7, 1998 review details\n\nI enjoyed the pace of this film. My friends found it too slow but I thought that the pace helped convey the mood of the film and the situations.\n\nJane Austen's Mafia August 6, 1998 review details\n\nVery corny. I was in the mood so some parts were hilarious.\n\nJoan of Arc February 7th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nA great film that twists your mind to two perspectives on the story, leaving you wondering which one is correct.\n\nJudas Kiss February 2nd, 2001 imdb\n\nExciting, interesting, intelligent and unpredictable. Everything a movie should be. Of course, starting with a lesbian love scene helps capture the attention of at least half the audience. ;)\n\nKeeping the Faith June 27th, 2000 imdb\n\nA unique and interesting story, which is quite rare these days...\n\nThe Kid November 25th, 2000 imdb\n\nStarted OK but just got weirder and weirder as it went on.\n\nThe Klumps December 28th, 2000 imdb\n\nAll the good bits are in the trailer. The characters had potential from the first movie, but not enough substance to justify their own.\n\nKM 0 May 6th, 2001 imdb\n\nA classic and interesting tale of lifes little co-incidences.\n\nA Knights Tale September 22nd, 2001 imdb\n\nFantastic. Had me flinching the whole time. I wasn't expecting much, but really enjoyed it.\n\nKundun August 25, 1998 review details\n\nInformative, moving and inspirational. A must see.\n\nL.A. Confidential December 9, 1997 review details\n\nI loved this film. I recommend it to everyone. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce were brilliant. I am still outraged that Kim Bassinger won an Oscar for this film while the Australian boys didn't even get nominated.\n\nLethal Weapon 4 September 15, 1998 review details\n\nThey should have stopped at 3. Not bad, but not legendary like the others. Why is Riggs suddenly too old as well?\n\nLife is Beautiful March 30, 1999 review details\n\nI had to see this because my Dad kept pestering me and Roberto Benigni was just so infectious at the Oscars. Humour and a concentration camp is an unlikely mix but Roberto's infectiousness makes it work very well. Funny and sad.\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels November 24, 1998 review details\n\nVery enjoyable. Especially the payback on the parking officer.\n\nLooking for Alibrandi May 16th, 2000 August 14th, 2000 imdb\n\nGreat! Pia Miranda is just adorable...\n\nLoser August 29th, 2000 imdb\n\nNice. The cast was good, but very much in their trademark roles.\n\nLost & Found August 16th, 1999 details trailers\n\nSome chuckly bits but on the whole it wasn't quite there... (Airplane movie)\n\nMad About Mambo November 29th, 2000 imdb\n\nThere are a lot of dance oriented movies around at the moment. This one, like the others, was quite pleasant to watch.\n\nThe Matrix April 15th, 1999 review details\n\nA fantastic sci-fi film. Amazing special effects, a clever story, computers, filmed in Australia - what more could you want? Just one thing, to be able to move that fast...\n\nMeet the Parents January 2nd, 2001 imdb\n\nHilarious. Ben Stiller rocks.\n\nMemento May 27th, 2001 imdb\n\nInteresting format, but be more awake than I was when you choose to see it.\n\nMen in Black October 6, 1997 review details\n\nFunny. The contrast between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones makes most of the humour possible. My favourite part is still the television advertisement that I didn't understand until seeing the movie. They hold up the memory eraser, it flashes, and the quote \"See it again, for the first time\".\n\nThe Mexican May 1st, 2001 July 23rd, 2001 imdb\n\nEnjoyable little tale ... particularly for those who like drooling over Brad Pitt.\n\nMicky Blue Eyes August 30th, 1999 details trailers\n\nSimple fun with lots of Hugh Grant sorry's.\n\nMiss Congeniality March 25th, 2001 imdb\n\nFunnier and not quite as silly as I was expecting.\n\nMission: Impossible II June 6th, 2000 imdb\n\nLike all good action films, completely unbelievable.\n\nMoulin Rouge June 13th, 2001 imdb\n\nI hate to admit that musicals are growing on me...\n\nMy Best Friends Wedding September 27, 1997 review details\n\nExtremely light. It basically felt like the whole movie was based around one catchy tune (Say a Little Prayer For Me). The hilarious gay friend of Julia Roberts was the one thing that made the movie worth watching.\n\nMulan September 27, 1998 review details\n\nArguably my favourite Disney film. I loved it.\n\nMumford February 13th, 2000 details trailers\n\nSimple, funny. Perhaps I was too dulled by the 13 hour plane trip to enjoy it more.\n\nMusic of the Heart February 13th, 2000 details trailers\n\nNice story, nice movie. Meryl Streep is great.\n\nMystery, Alaska February 13th, 2000 details trailers\n\nGood small town feel and one of the few unpredictable sports movies ever made.\n\nThe Negotiator October 27, 1998 review details\n\nI love Samuel L Jackson films and this was no exception.\n\nNotting Hill June 15th, 1999 review details\n\nNice movie. I was a little disappointed though since I was hoping for another brilliant movie like Four Weddings.\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? January 21st, 2001 imdb\n\nNot sure where it went, but I enjoyed the ride.\n\nThe Opposite of Sex August 18, 1998 review details\n\nThis movie just annoyed me.\n\nThe Out of Towners October 11th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nSilly, as expected.\n\nPatch Adams April 3rd, 1999 review details\n\nVery funny but perhaps a little too sentimental for those who aren't immune to Hollywood movies like I am.\n\nThe Patriot July 25th, 2000 imdb\n\nI even got a bit watery eyed at one point.\n\nPayback March 16. 1999 review details\n\nInteresting watching Mel Gibson as a bad guy. Quite enjoyable, but I think that may be largely due to it starring Mel.\n\nThe Peacemaker December 18, 1997 review details\n\nI think that this was the George Clooney and Nicole Kidman movie. Obviously it left a strong impression on me.\n\nThe Perfect Storm July 9th, 2000 imdb\n\nGreat storm scenes wrapped in a bad attempt at building land-based relationships for the main characters.\n\nThe Phantom Menace June 3rd, 1999 review details\n\nI'd been looking forward to it for ages, and I wasn't disappointed. I just wish that I could be watching the whole 6 film series in order.\n\nPicture Perfect November 1, 1997 review details\n\nMy ex dragged me to see this movie. I should have fought harder to get away.\n\nPlanet of the Apes November 3rd, 2001 imdb\n\nInteresting concept (still), great special effects.\n\nThe Prince of Egypt December 25, 1998 review details\n\nThe story was simply just too serious. Some of the animation was great though.\n\nThe Princess Diaries September 15th, 2001 imdb\n\nLots of smiles from all the \"would be princesses\" in the audience.\n\nProof of Life April 2nd, 2001 imdb\n\nWatchable, but no where near as good as Ransom.\n\nQuills March 4th, 2001 imdb\n\nDisturbing content is by its nature compelling. Unfortunately this film doesn't seem to have a more interesting message hidden below.\n\nThe Red Violin November 2nd, 1999 review details\n\nI really enjoyed it but somehow the 2 hours still felt long.\n\nReindeer Games October 10th, 2000 imdb\n\nIt took half an hour to remember that we'd seen it. I was even looking at the title and thinking that we never got around to it.\n\nRemember the Titans January 31st, 2001 imdb\n\nThings are still not perfect, but it's so hard to imagine living in a time when racism was such a dividing issue. It's also strange to have a feel good movie where people spend most of their time getting pummelled.\n\nRoad Trip September 22nd, 2000 imdb\n\nSlow start, funny middle, poor ending.\n\nRomeo Must Die March 22nd, 2000 May 30th, 2000 imdb\n\nReally good action film. Used some visual effects brilliantly to further highlight the violence.\n\nRounders March 2, 1999 review details\n\nI enjoyed the card playing in this movie. The character Worm infuriated me so much that I almost wasn't enjoying the movie. It must have been good.\n\nRun Lola Run October 26th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nBreathtaking.\n\nRunaway Bride August 19th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nNice to see Julia Roberts and Richard Gere together again.\n\nRush Hour February 9, 1999 review details\n\nNot bad, but it is just so disappointing when compared to the brilliant action in Chinese Jackie Chan films.\n\nSave the Last Dance May 2nd, 2001 imdb\n\nInter-racial dating is something we don't see enough of in the media today...\n\nSaving Private Ryan December 18, 1998 review details\n\nOne of those films where no one in the cinema makes a single noise. Maybe that's because the sound effects were up to 110dB :-). So realistic. Thought provoking. It made me realize the contradictions of war. The overall cause is worthy, the campaigns are costly and futile, but one person can make a huge difference.\n\nScary Movie September 5th, 2000 imdb\n\nIf 30% of one million jokes work you have a funny movie.\n\nScream 2 February 10, 1998 review details\n\nGood suspense like the first one. Just too much gore for me though.\n\nShaft November 7th, 2000 imdb\n\nThe most violent movie I've seen in quite a while. Funny though...\n\nShakespeare in Love March 1, 1999 review details\n\nAn extremely clever movie. Shakespeare within Shakespeare. Highly recommended. I saw it twice.\n\nShanghai Noon August 22nd, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb\n\nFinally a mainstream Jackie Chan movie that gets the mix exactly right.\n\nShooting Fish September 8, 1998 review details\n\nHarmless. Quite funny.\n\nShrek June 29th, 2001 August 3rd, 2001 imdb\n\nFantastic fun... \"that'll do Donkey, that'll do\"\n\nA Simple Plan February 23, 1999 review details\n\nAnother spiral movie, where one bad decision leads to endless problems. Not bad though.\n\nThe Sixth Sense August 27th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nBruce Willis couldn't quite pull off this non tough guy role. A very clever story.\n\nSleepy Hollow January 1st, 2000 review details trailers\n\nEven worse than I was expecting.\n\nSliding Doors August 10, 1998 review details\n\nInteresting concept.\n\nSnatch November 14th, 2000 imdb\n\nGreat story that was very well filmed...\n\nSnow Falling on Cedars January 11th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nConveys a lot of feeling and emotion with visual imagery and sound effects. The subtle portrayal of rasism is very well done.\n\nSomeone Like You August 3rd, 2001 imdb\n\nIt was alright until the terrible ending.\n\nSouth Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut July 29th, 1999 review details\n\nVery, very funny. I particularly liked the music. I'm glad I watched a few episodes on video before seeing the movie though...\n\nThe Suburbans February 13th, 2000 details\n\nVery silly but funny. Jennifer Love Hewitt makes it much more watchable.\n\nSuperstar September 28th, 2000 imdb\n\nSimple but enjoyable.\n\nThe Sweet Hereafter August 11, 1998 review details\n\nI cannot remember a single thing about this movie.\n\nSwordfish July 9th, 2001 imdb\n\nI laughed when I watched the guy while hacking. Banging his head on the desk, having revelations, etc. Exactly the things I do when coding...\n\nThe Talented Mr Ripley April 10th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nUltimately not that interesting.\n\nTarzan April 10th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nGood, but not as special as some Disney classics.\n\nTea with Mussolini October 15th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nAn interesting perspective on WWII but pretty slow.\n\nThere's Something About Mary September 11, 1998 review details\n\nPushes the line of what I feel comfortable laughing at. I laughed very hard in the cinema, I felt a little uncomfortable afterwards. On reflection the laughter is outweighing the discomfort.\n\nThe Thin Red Line March 13, 1999 review details\n\nI was very disappointed. This movie got rave reviews everywhere and I hated it. I thought that it was long and boring. There was very little action and lots of voice overs. I hate voice overs. Some of the sound effects and cinematography was fantastic though.\n\nThe Thomas Crown Affair August 19th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nA very enjoyable power struggle. I love Rene Russo all the more after this film.\n\nThrill Ride: The Science of Fun September 3, 1997 review details\n\nThis IMAX format movie was a real disappointment. Most of the movie is made in the standard cinema screen format. There was probably about 15 minutes of excitement in the 1 hour movie. The title should have been warning enough.\n\nTitanic July 14, 1998 review details\n\nBrilliant. The story was so powerful. One of those amazing movies where the special effects are so good that you don't even realize how good they are because you don't notice them at all. I am so glad that I saw it on the big screen. I wonder if movies will ever get more true to life than Titanic.\n\nTombraider July 13th, 2001 imdb\n\nJust stay home and play the game.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies January 29, 1998 review details\n\nI quite like Pierce Brosnan as Bond.\n\nTopsy Turvey April 15th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nIf I wasn't so jet lagged I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep in that state however. There were some great scenes depicting life at that time.\n\nToy Story 2 December 26th, 1999 review details trailers\n\nSome amazing graphics, I was really disappointed that they didn't show the out-takes during the trailers in my theatre.\n\nTraffic March 20th, 2001 imdb\n\nInteresting style, interesting story, difficult problems, great acting.\n\nTropfest 2001 February 25th, 2001 site\n\n85,000 people decide to converge on the domain have a quiet picnic and watch short films together. Fantastic!\n\nThe Truman Show October 1, 1998 review details\n\nInteresting concept. I just thought that Jim Carrey was unnecessary and that the ending was very weak.\n\nTrue Crime May 13th, 1999 review details\n\nEnjoyable suspense film. The death row prisoner and his family convey their emotion very convincingly. Clint Eastwood makes us feel awkward just watching him fumble through life as a reporter.\n\nTwenty-Four Seven June 30, 1998 review details\n\nI don't feel I can comment on this movie as I don't think that I really understood it.\n\nTwo Hands August 10th, 1999 review details\n\nA strange mix of comedy and weirdness. Lots of subtle Australian jokes.\n\nU-571 May 9th, 2000 imdb\n\nNothing builds suspense like a submarine movie.\n\nUnbreakable January 4th, 2001 imdb\n\nStrange but got more and more interesting as it went on.\n\nVarsity Blues April 6th, 1999 review details\n\nTeen trash. I enjoyed it though, mostly because of William Robert (Billy Bob).\n\nVelvet Goldmine November 21, 1998 review details\n\nWay too weird for me.\n\nVertical Limit April 19th, 2001 imdb\n\nDefinitely exciting and not as over the top as the previews seemed.\n\nVery Bad Things February 16, 1999 review details\n\nIf you think that watching someone get chopped into little pieces is funny, then see this film.\n\nThe Very Thought of You May 18th, 1999 review details\n\nThis romantic comedy walks the fine line but doesn't become a chick flick. A lot of funny unpredictable events.\n\nThe Waterboy February 4, 1999 review details\n\nAnother hilarious Adam Sandler film. Almost as funny as Happy Gilmore.\n\nThe Wedding Singer May 22, 1998 review details\n\nVery funny.\n\nWhat Becomes of the Broken Hearted? August 3rd, 1999 review details\n\nA good sequel to the amazing Once Were Warriors. Jake is still as terrifying as ever and the maturation of his character is very believable. Saw the first half of the movie twice due to a gas leak (false alarm - it was the smell from an oil leak 10km away) evacuation.\n\nWhat Planet are you from? March 4th, 2000 details trailers\n\nStrange but funny. The sound effects were simple but very effective.\n\nWhat Women Want January 9th, 2001 imdb\n\nSlow start, good middle, terrible ending.\n\nWhen Brendan Met Trudy July 20th, 2001 imdb\n\nUnlikely, but funny.\n\nWhere the Heart Is August 7th, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb\n\nIn the 90's you wouldn't think people would still have so much trouble with the concept of contraception.\n\nWhere the Money Is August 7th, 2000 imdb\n\nFunny but forgetable...\n\nThe Whole Nine Yards April 18th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nFunny and very well cast.\n\nThe World is Not Enough November 30th, 1999 March 25th, 2000 review details trailers\n\nBond, pure Bond.\n\nX-Men July 16th, 2000 imdb\n\nA few interesting ideas and concepts surrounded by trash."
