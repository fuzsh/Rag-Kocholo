Featuring an outstanding ensemble cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Chloë Sevigny, Anthony Edwards, and Brian Cox, Zodiac is a searing and singularly haunting examination of twin obsessions: one man’s desire to kill and another’s quest for the truth.\n\nThe 4K UHD Blu-ray + Blu-Ray + Digital Copy of Zodiac is available for preorder at Amazon."
