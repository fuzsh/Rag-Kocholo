        "text": "Patti Yasutake, the actress best known for her roles in Netflix’s “Beef” and “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” has died at age 70.\n\nYasutake died on August 5 following a long battle with cancer after being diagnosed with a rare form of T-cell lymphoma, her manager Kyle Fritz told Variety.\n\n“Patti was my first client when I began over 30 years ago. We enjoyed every day we got to work together, and I will miss her spirit talent and tenacity but most of all her friendship,” Fritz told the outlet.\n\nYasutake’s final TV role before her death was in the hit Netflix series “Beef,” which starred Ali Wong, Steven Yeun and Joseph Lee.\n\nIn the series, which picked up 3 Emmy Awards at last year’s ceremony, Yasutake played Fumi Nakai, who is the mother of Lee’s character George.\n\nThe actress was also known for her role as Nurse Alyssa Ogawa in the hit 1987 film “Star Trek: The Next Generation.”\n\nShe later reprised her role in two follow-up films: “Star Trek Generations,” released in 1994, and “Star Trek: First Contact,” released in 1996.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Yasutake graduated UCLA with Honors in Theater before kickstarting her acting career in 1985.\n\nHer first notable role was an appearance in the police drama “T. J. Hooker,” which starred William Shatner.\n\nShe went on to land a major feature in Ron Howard’s 1986 comedy “Gung Go,” in which she starred as Umeki — a Japanese wife desperately attempting to Americanize herself in the US.\n\nShe later reprised that role on its ABC comedy series that lasted a total of 9 episodes between 1986 and 1987.\n\nYasutake’s onscreen work was soon recognized with an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her role in the 1988 film “The Wash.”\n\nShe went on to appear in several more films, including the 1999 film Drop Dead Gorgeous, as well as “Blind Spot,” released in 1993, and “Road to Galveston,” released in 1996.\n\nYasutake also had a series of guest appearances under her belt on shows like “Grey’s Anatomy,” “The Closer,” “Bones, and “Cold Case.”\n\nThe actress is survived by siblings Linda Hayashi and Steve Yasutake.\n\nA memorial service will be held in Los Angeles, Calif., on August 25."
