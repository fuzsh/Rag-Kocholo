        "text": "media release\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nToronto International Film Festival announces four more 2024 TIFF Tribute Award honourees\n\nMike Leigh to receive TIFF Ebert Director Award, Durga Chew-Bose to receive TIFF Emerging Talent Award, Camille Dalmais and Clément Ducol to receive TIFF Variety Artisan Award\n\nTORONTO — Cameron Bailey is delighted to announce four more esteemed honourees who will be receiving a TIFF Tribute Award at this year’s Festival. Recipients include Academy Award–nominated and renowned British filmmaker Mike Leigh, who will be honoured with the TIFF Ebert Director Award. Canadian rising star Durga Chew-Bose will be honoured with the TIFF Emerging Talent Award presented by Amazon MGM Studios; this award is in the spirit of Torontonian Mary Pickford, the groundbreaking actor, producer, and co-founder of United Artists, whose impact continues today. French songwriting and composing duo Camille Dalmais and Clément Ducol will be presented with the TIFF Variety Artisan Award for composing the soundtrack for Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Pérez, a Netflix film; the award recognizes distinguished creatives who have excelled at their craft and made an outstanding contribution to cinema and entertainment. This latest group of recipients will be honoured alongside the recently announced Amy Adams, Cate Blanchett, and David Cronenberg at the TIFF Tribute Awards gala fundraiser on Sunday, September 8, at Fairmont Royal York Hotel, with Sandra Oh serving as Honorary Chair.\n\n“It’s a true honour to welcome Mike Leigh back to the Festival and present him with the TIFF Ebert Director Award,” said Bailey. “Leigh has long been acknowledged as one of cinema’s great artists; Roger Ebert himself praised Leigh’s ‘sympathy, penetrating observation, and instinct for human comedy.’ Hard Truths is both a summation of that work and a bold move forward. We’re also excited to honour Canadian filmmaker Durga Chew-Bose with the TIFF Emerging Talent Award. Her feature debut, Bonjour Tristesse, reimagines the classic film with arresting imagery and insight into character. And in a bountiful year of music in film, Camille Dalmais and Clément Ducol’s Emilia Pérez compositions stand out for their passion and vitality. We’re pleased to present them with the TIFF Variety Artisan Award.”\n\nMike Leigh returns to the 49th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival for the World Premiere of his 23rd film, Hard Truths, screening as part of the Special Presentations programme. He reunites with Academy Award nominee Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Secrets & Lies) to create a challenging but ultimately compassionate, intimate study of a modern family life. Hard Truths is distributed by Bleecker Street in the US and by Mongrel Media in Canada. Leigh has had eight films in Official Selection at the Festival, including Another Year, Happy-Go-Lucky, and Mr. Turner. Named after legendary film critic Roger Ebert, the Award has gone to celebrated visionaries such as Martin Scorsese, Claire Denis, Ava DuVernay, Wim Wenders, and the late Agnès Varda. Past recipients who received the TIFF Ebert Director Award since the TIFF Tribute Awards were introduced include Spike Lee in 2023; Sam Mendes in 2022; Denis Villeneuve in 2021; Chloé Zhao in 2020; and Taika Waititi in 2019.\n\nMontreal-based Durga Chew-Bose is making her feature film debut as both director and screenwriter of Bonjour Tristesse, which will have its World Premiere in the Discovery programme. This contemporary adaptation of late French author Françoise Sagan’s 1954 novel of the same name stars Chloë Sevigny and Claes Bang. Bonjour Tristesse is distributed by Elevation Pictures in Canada. Previous recipients of the TIFF Emerging Talent Award presented by Amazon MGM Studios include Carolina Markowicz in 2023; Sally El Hosaini in 2022; Danis Goulet in 2021; Tracey Deer in 2020; and Mati Diop in 2019.\n\nCamille Dalmais (Corsage, TIFF ’22) and Clément Ducol (Little Tickles) are prominent figures in the French music scene, often collaborating to create innovative and experimental works. Camille, known for her unique vocal style and blending of pop, folk, and avant-garde elements, has gained acclaim with albums like Le Sac des Filles and Le Fil. Clément Ducol, a versatile musician, arranger, and producer, enhances her projects with his creative arrangements and musical expertise. Together, they form a dynamic duo, pushing the boundaries of contemporary French music. Previous recipients of the TIFF Variety Artisan Award include Łukasz Żal in 2023; Hildur Guðnadóttir in 2022; Ari Wegner in 2021; Terence Blanchard in 2020; and Roger Deakins in 2019.\n\n“Variety is honoured to be giving Camille and Clément our annual Artisan Award at the Toronto International Film Festival,” said Jazz Tangcay, Senior Artisans Editor at Variety. “The soundtrack to Emilia Pérez is a character within the film and a true gift from these fine musicians. Each song and cue is a work of art. The operatic libretto is filled with highlights including Selena Gomez’s Spanish pop song and Zoe Saldaña’s gala number. We are such fans of their work and thrilled to present this award to them, recognizing their talent and contribution this year.”\n\nNow in its sixth year, the Tribute Awards is TIFF’s largest fundraiser, with proceeds from the gala going towards TIFF’s Every Story Fund, which champions diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in film.\n\nThe Tribute Awards have served as an awards-season bellwether, honouring the film industry’s outstanding contributors and their achievements, with past honourees Colman Domingo, Michelle Yeoh, Brendan Fraser, Jessica Chastain, Roger Deakins, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Joaquin Phoenix, Taika Waititi, and Chloé Zhao going on to win awards on the international stage.\n\nMike Leigh Bio\n\nWriter-director Mike Leigh’s first feature film was Bleak Moments (1971).

Passionate about bossa and musicals, she took singing lessons and, at the age of 20, participated in the vocal workshops of the British singer Julie Tippetts. She released her first album, Le sac des filles, in 2002, while still a student at the Institut d’études politiques de Paris.\n\nIn 2005, she was awarded two Victoires de la musique as well as the Prix Constantin for her second album, Le Fil.

In her twenty-year career, she has collaborated with a large number of renowned artists and notably had the opportunity to reunite with Bobby McFerrin on several occasions, on stage and to work on his opera project Bobble.\n\nA versatile artist, Camille has also participated in numerous audiovisual projects. In 2007, Disney entrusted her with the end credits of its successful animated feature Ratatouille, for which she was nominated at the World Soundtrack Awards.

He also sang Yniold’s part in Peter Brook’s adaptation of Debussy’s opera Pelléas et Mélisande. Ducol studied cello, piano, harmony, orchestration, and percussion, and joined the Conservatoire National Supérieur in Lyon to pursue advanced studies in orchestration and percussion, and also trained in dance.\n\nHe later went on to work extensively as a music arranger, producer, and composer in fields spanning pop music, contemporary classical music, and cinema. Ducol has collaborated with some of the most acclaimed contemporary artists in France (Camille, Vincent Delerm, Alain Souchon, Christophe, Vanessa Paradis) and worldwide (Youn Sun Nah, Roni Alter, Melody Gardot, Gregory Porter, Lianne La Havas, Keziah Jones).
