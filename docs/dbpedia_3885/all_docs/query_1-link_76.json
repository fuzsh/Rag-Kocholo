Think about how everyday actions can save energy now.Â\n\nCutting down on sing-use plastics protects our natural world. Grab a cloth shopping bag. Pick up some paper straws. Opt for glass or steel containers. Refill soap dispensers from a bulk-sized jug. Try something new to help the planet.Â\n\nMaking sustainable seafood choices protects our oceans and helps make sure we have a healthy food supply into the future. Read the labels. Ask great questions. Shop around. Join our conservation journey. We are a proud supporter and advocate of theÂ Ocean Wise Seafood program. Ocean Wise Seafood is a nonprofit conservation program created to empower consumers and businesses to make informed decisions about sustainable seafood and educate them on responsible aquaculture practices and issues facing the worldâs fisheries. Ocean Wise works directly with partners to ensure they have the latest scientific information available regarding their seafood so they can make ocean-friendly buying decisions. The Ocean Wise symbol on menus and packaging enables customers to easily choose products that ensure the health of our oceans for generations to come."
