        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA –Aug. XX, 2024\n\nFamily Movies Events, a new entertainment distribution company focusing on wholesome family-centric content announced today the August 9th premiere date for the nationwide release of their first title A Carpenter’s Prayer. The film stars Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects), Bethany Anne Lind (Ozark), and Reno Reyes (The Walking Dead).\n\nFor their debut title, Family Movie Events partnered with Integrity Releasing, a distribution company with deep connections in the faith community, who brought in A Carpenter’s Prayer. The film was written and directed by Matt Webb (Praying the Hours) who also produced along with Lance Clark (Patterns). The film was shot in a variety of locations in and around northern Indiana and Huntington University.\n\n“A Carpenter’s Prayer marks the launch of Family Movie Events, as we introduce a slate of five films that celebrate family values, and inspire hope,” said Harmon Kaslow, President of Family Movie Events. “We are grateful to our theater partners for supporting these uplifting stories and bringing them to audiences nationwide.”\n\nA Carpenter’s Prayer tells the inspiring true story of a pastor and his family who set out to build a new church in 1970s rural Michigan. Along the way, they face challenges that threaten to unravel everything when an afflicted carpenter becomes their unlikely source of hope, proving that faith in God is the true path to redemption, even in the most tragic circumstances.\n\n“At Integrity we are perpetually interested in distributing high-quality family content”, said Heather O’Quinn, President of Integrity Releasing. “Our partnership with Family Movie Events makes it possible for family and faith films to have a path to distribution in communities that are hungry for elevated content like A Carpenter’s Prayer”.\n\n“I am very excited that Forester Film’s debut feature, “A Carpenter’s Prayer,” a true story about my childhood, is coming to theaters this summer.” said producer Lance Clark."
