        "text": "1999 was definitely one to remember as the last of the century.

Let’s revisit them in a bit more detail.\n\nOlympic Scandal\n\nThe International Olympic Committee expelled six members as a result of an inquiry into corruption – the first time in its 105 year history it has been forced to do so. The six members were given cash, gifts, financial help with tuition, and had medical treatment paid for totalling approximately $800,000, in relation to the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Olympics. The scandal triggered a process of reform in which the system of bidding was completely overhauled.\n\nThe six members were:\n\nAgustin Arroyo of Ecuador\n\nZein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan\n\nJean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic\n\nLamine Keita of Mali\n\nSergio Santander of Chile\n\nPaul Wallwork of Samoa\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nVictory for Serena Williams\n\nSerena Williams is widely regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time, male or female. She finished her second full year on the main tour ranked as No. 4 in the world, and her win at the US Open made her the second African-American woman to do so. This could be considered just a taste of what we could come to expect from the superstar.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nBonjour Lance Armstrong\n\nLance Armstrong, a name now marred by the revelations of recent years, became one to watch when he won the 1999 Tour de France, including four of the stages. He would have to wait until some of his competitors who were unable to participate returned to the sport, when he would have the opportunity to truly prove himself. On this occasion however, he beat the second place rider by 7 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
