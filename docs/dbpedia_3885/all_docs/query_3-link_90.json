        "text": "Summary\n\nAdam Sandler frequently casts his wife, Jackie, and their daughters, Sadie and Sunny, in his movies, showcasing his family in his work.\n\nSandler’s film production company, Happy Madison Productions, has been successful in producing hit comedies since its debut in 1999.\n\nMovies like\n\nBig Daddy, Bedtime Stories\n\n, and\n\nThat’s My Boy\n\nfeature not only his wife and daughters but also other family members in cameo appearances, adding a personal touch to his projects.\n\nFans of the comedic star may not realize how often they see Adam Sandler‘s kids in his movies as well as other family members, like Sadie Sandler and Sunny Sandler, and his wife, Jacqueline. On top of starring in hit movies, Sandler produces them as well through his film production company, Happy Madison Productions. This has allowed Sandler more control over his projects, which includes embracing his desire to bring his family into his work.\n\nSandler’s wife, Jacqueline, is an actress and a model. Besides starring in her husband’s films, Jackie has appeared in movies such as The Last Summer and TV series like Kevin Can Wait. Sandler’s two daughters, Sadie and Sunny, also make frequent appearances in their father’s films. While some Sandler family appearances are more prominent, others can be more difficult to spot. However, every Adam Sandler movie featuring his wife Jackie, daughters Sadie Sandler and Sunny Sandler, includes some of his best projects (even those he doesn’t star in).\n\n23 Big Daddy (1999)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays A Waitress\n\nBig Daddy was one of Sandler’s first hits that acted as a signpost for his familial castings to come. The movie follows Sonny Koufax, a slacker in New York City who suddenly finds himself in charge of five-year-old Julian McGrath (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) after the child was left abandoned on his doorstep. One of the first movies in what would become the Sandler multiverse, Big Daddy was also the film to kick off Sandler’s habit of casting his family.\n\nAdam Sandler’s wife, Jackie, had a small role as a waitress, and they met on set. However, it is one of the most notable given that this is where her personal and professional relationship with Sandler began. Her performance wooed Sandler — and the pair were dating by the time the film was released in 1999. Jackie’s role in the movie is very minor with her only appearing briefly in one scene and delivering a couple of lines.\n\n22 Bedtime Stories (2008)\n\nSadie Sandler Appears As “Sweetest Medieval Girl Of All Time”/Jackie Sandler Appears As Lady Jacqueline\n\nWhile Sandler is known for his charmingly juvenile humor in a lot of his movies, they have largely been aimed at an older audience. Bedtime Stories was among Adam Sandler’s first family-oriented films. Sandler plays Skeeter Bronson, a hotel handyman who finds himself in hot water after the outlandish stories he tells his niece and nephew come to life. Sandler’s daughter, Sadie, appearedalongside him in Bedtime Stories at just under two years old, playing the role of the “Sweetest Medieval Girl of All Time” in one of the fairy tales.\n\nIt marked the first time one of Sandler’s children appeared in a credited role in one of his movies. Given her young age, it makes sense that Sadie doesn’t have any lines in the movie. Jackie Sandler also appears in the movie as Lady Jacqueline, the mother of the little girl, who also doesn’t have any lines in the movie.\n\n21 That’s My Boy (2012)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays A Masseuse/Sadie And Sunny Sandler Cameo\n\nThat’s My Boy sees Donny (Adam Sandler) raise his son, Todd (Andy Samberg) for 18 years as a single father. After years apart, Donny arrives uninvited on the eve of Todd’s wedding in a desperate effort to reconnect – ensuring hilarity ensues. The film is a raunchy R-rated comedy that was met with dismal reviews and marks one of the few Adam Sandler movies to bomb at the box office.\n\nJackie Sandler appeared in That’s My Boy as a masseuse who Donny makes a clumsy pass at only to be rejected by the disgusted professional. It is a brief appearance but has a funny reveal that sells the depravity of Donny as a character. His daughters, Sunny and Sadie, appeared as children running a local lemonade stand. It serves as the first time the girls were seen on screen together.\n\n20 Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)\n\nJackie Sandler Stars As Sally\n\nDeuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo tells the story of Deuce Bigalow, a hapless fish tank cleaner who gets himself in dangerous waters after causing expensive damage to the house of a sex worker. To pay for the damages, Deuce Bigalow is forced to turn to sex work himself, resulting in raucous scenes that put Rob Schneider’s comedic talents on the map.\n\nWhile Sandler himself doesn’t appear in the first-ever Happy Madison production, his wife Jackie shows up as Sally. It is another brief role as Sally is a woman who hired Deuce to go out with her friend for a night. However, when Deuce begins to fall for the girl, Sally and her other friends don’t approve of him becoming a permanent love interest. Interestingly, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is a family affair outside of the Sandlers with Elle King, Schneider’s real-life daughter and future music star, appearing as well.\n\n19 The Do-Over (2016)\n\nJackie Sandler Appears As Joan/Sadie And Sunny Play Sally And Daisy\n\nMore than a decade after Sandler teamed up with Damon Wayans for Bulletproof, he returned to the buddy action movie genre with The Do-Over. When their lives begin to go downhill, Max and Charlie (Sandler and fellow Saturday Night Live alum David Spade) decide to fake their deaths and start over with new identities. Unfortunately, the new personas the pair craft for themselves are revealed to have even worse problems than their old ones.\n\nJackie appears in The Do-Over as Joan, a woman whom the two friends meet in the club while living their new lives on the run while Sadie and Sunny play Auto Store Lou’s daughters, Sally and Daisy. Once again, these are brief roles for Sandler’s family members. However, it was further proof that these roles were growing in the new era of Sandler’s career when he partnered with Netflix for a collection of movies.\n\n18 The Benchwarmers (2006)\n\nJackie And Jared Sandler Cameo\n\nThe Benchwarmers sees Richie (David Spade), Gus (Rob Schneider), and Clark (Jon Heder) delusionally dream of becoming pro baseball players as kids only to never get the chance. As adults, the trio forms a baseball team to compete against Little League teams in another classic Sandler sports comedy. The movie is a sign of how Sandler would set up a lot of projects for his famous friends and continue the inclusion of his family members, even if he himself wasn’t in the project.\n\nJackie Sandler makes a brief cameoin the movie, credited only as “Female Customer,” while Adam Sandler’s nephew Jared, who as an adult is a comedian like his uncle, also makes an appearance as the “Autograph Kid.” Jared would become another member of the Sandler extended family who would begin appearing regularly in Sandler’s movies, but this was one of his first speaking roles.\n\n17 Just Go With It (2011)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays Veruca/Jana Sandler Cameos\n\nAfter being burned in love when he finds out his fiancé Veruca cheated on him and married him for his money, Danny (Adam Sandler) decides to tell every future woman he hooks up with that he’s married to avoid commitment and more pain. However, when he meets the woman of his dreams and regrets telling her he’s married, Danny ropes his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) into pretending to be his soon-to-be ex-wife.\n\nJackie Sandler plays Veruca, Danny’s ex-fiance, while his cousin, Jana Sandler, also appears as one of Jackie’s bridesmaids. Despite the fact that Jackie has appeared in many of her husband’s movies, this is the closest time they came to being an on-screen couple. However, even then they aren’t seen sharing the screen as Danny learns about Veruca’s infidelity and insults to him while outside her dressing room.\n\n16 The Ridiculous 6 (2015)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays “Never Wears Bra”/Jared Sandler Appears As “Babyface Patch”\n\nThe Ridiculous 6 served as the first movie Adam Sandler made in partnership with Netflix and also served as his attempt at making a Western comedy in the vein of Blazing Saddles. Sandler stars as Tommy, who was raised by Native Americans, only to discover he has several half-brothers who must band together to help their estranged father. The movie also stars Terry Crews, Rob Schneider, and Luke Wilson.\n\nThe Ridiculous 6 also stars Sandler’s wife, Jackie, as Never Wears Bra, and his nephew, Jared, as Babyface Patch. Jackie’s role was actually part of a larger criticism of the movie in its depiction of Native Americans. Not only is the casting an example of a white actor playing a Native American character, but the character’s name was also perceived as insulting. This led to reports of several Native American actors walking off the set of the movie (via Variety).\n\n15 Little Nicky (2000)\n\nJackie Sandler Appears As Jenna\n\nIn Sandler’s attempt to combine his particular brand of humor with some supernatural elements Little Nicky follows two of the Devil’s sons who have escaped Hell to create a Hell on Earth — and it’s up to Little Nicky (Sandler), the Devil’s mild-mannered son, to bring them home. This makes for a fish-out-of-water comedy that includes a lot of fun cameos, including the likes of Rodney Dangerfield, Quentin Tarantino, and Sandler’s own wife.\n\nLate in the movie, Nicky learns that his mother was actually an angel and he is able to go to heaven to meet her. Reese Witherspoon stars as his mother, while Jackie Sander appears in the scene as Jenna, one of her angel best friends with them acting like teenage girls together. The scene is also notable for including a cameo from Carl Weathers as Chubs, his iconic character from Sandler’s Happy Gilmore.\n\nAlongside Adam Sandler, who plays the titular Nicky, his wife Jackie appears in the movie playing the role of an angel named Jenna, one of Nicky’s mother’s right-hand angels. abound, and some view it as the movie that properly kicked off the Sandlerverse.\n\n14 Grown-Ups (2010) & Grown-Ups 2 (2013)\n\nJackie, Sunny, & Sadie Sandler Appear As Tardio’s Family\n\nWhile Adam Sandler has collaborated with his famous friends on a number of occasions, Grown Ups was seen as an exciting Avengers-like lineup of all these funny people coming together. After the death of their high school basketball coach, five former friends and their families come together to reunite and celebrate his legacy. Even though it’s been 30 years since they won the championship, and they’re all grown up now, this group of friends finds they’re still children at heart.\n\nThe movie brings together Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Kevin James, and Rob Schneider as the friends, with plenty of other familiar faces in Sandler’s sphere also included. Jackie, Sunny, and Sadie all appear inGrown Ups and Grown Ups 2 as the wife and children of Tardio (Richie Minervini), a member of the friends’ rival group. It is the first time Sandler’s family members have had roles they have played more than once.\n\n13 Jack & Jill (2011)\n\nSunny Sandler And Sadie Sandler Cameo\n\nWhat is considered by many to be Adam Sandler’s worst movie, Jack and Jill still maintained the actor’s trend of casting family members. Despite being fraternal twins, Jack and Jill Sadelstein (both played by Sandler) could not be any more different; and while Jack is a successful family man, Jill is singularly focused on her brother’s attention. The movie also features cameos from the likes of Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, playing themselves.\n\nBoth Sadie and Sunny Sandler make appearances in the film in cameos as little girls on the cruise ship that Jack & Jill’s family vacations on. The roles were brief and maintained the trend of many of Sunny and Sadie’s early movie appearances where they appear together in scenes, often playing sisters. However, the brief appearance also shows how the girls were gradually getting some lines to deliver in their appearances.\n\n12 Blended (2014)\n\nJackie, Sunny, Sadie, And Judith Sandler Appear\n\nBlended tells the story of two chaotic families, starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, that come together after being forced to share a South African vacation package. Despite the mess the vacation turns out to be, the two families still find love in each other. While the movie was seen as the lesser out of the three collaborations between the two stars, it still captures a lot of the chemistry that has made them such an effective duo.\n\nBoth Jackie and Sunny Sandler appear in minor roles in the film, playing the Hollywood Stepmom and the Wall Street Stepdaughter, respectively. Sadie Sandler and her grandmother, Judith Sandler, also appear here as the Little League Announcer and her grandmother. Adam Sandler’s mother has actually appeared in a number of his movies, but this serves as one of her only on-screen appearances with actual lines.\n\n11 Hotel Transylvania (2012)\n\nJackie Sandler Voices Martha/Sadie Sandler Voices Winnie And Young Mavis\n\nHotel Transylvania is a departure from Adam Sandler’s usual films both commercially and critically, spawning a beloved children’s franchise in the process. The animated movie features Count Dracula (who Adam Sandler played until Hotel Transylvania 4) and his business — the Hotel Transylvania, a luxury holiday destination for monsters looking to unwind. However, the resort’s peaceful veneer is shattered when an ordinary human manages to make his way to the hotel.\n\nJackie Sandler voices Martha, the late wife of Count Dracula, and Sadie Sandler voices both Winnie and young Mavis. Sunny Sandler is also credited in the movie, but instead of voicing a specific character, she receives the credit of “Additional Voices.” While these are not big roles in the film, they are great examples of how committed Sandler is to including his family in his projects with them even branching out into the animated world.\n\n10 Pixels (2015)\n\nJackie And Jared Sandler Play Aides To The President/Sunny And Sadie Cameo\n\nIn Adam Sandler’s Pixels, footage of classic arcade gameplay sent into space as part of a time capsule ends up being misinterpreted as a declaration of war by an alien race. When the aliens attack Earth in the form of the video games they’d witnessed, it’s up to Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) to save the day. The movie is a bigger-budget sci-fi comedy than what Sandler was generally known for but he still manages to turn it into a collaboration with friends and family.\n\nPixels was truly a family affair; Jackie Sandler plays the role of Jennifer, the assistant of a fictional President of the United States (who everyone hates) and Brenner’s childhood friend, Will Cooper (Kevin James), and Jared Sandler is the White House Junior Aide. Also appearing from the Sandler family are Sunny and Sadie making cameos as a sweet Girl Scout and Lemonade Sadie.\n\n9 Hubie Halloween (2020)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays Tracy/Sadie Sandler Plays Danielle/Sunny Sandler Plays Cooky\n\nAdam Sandler has tackled a couple of holidays in his movies and one of his most popular Netflix movies took a humorous look at the Halloween season. Hubie Halloween follows Hubie Dubois (Adam Sandler), an eccentric community volunteer who is frequently the butt of all of Salem’s jokes. However, when mysterious forces threaten the town’s Halloween celebrations, it’s up to Hubie to save the day.\n\nSandler’s wife and both of his daughters all make appearances in this holiday flick; Jackie appears in the film as the journalist Tracy Phillips, who is part of one of Hubie Halloween‘s best running jokes where several adult women are dressed up as Harley Quinn for the holiday. Sadie plays the role of Danielle, and Sunny Sandler appears as Cooky, two of the teen characters who are central to the story. This was the first time Sandler’s kids had roles that extended beyond wordless cameos and one-scene appearances.\n\n8 The Wrong Missy (2020)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays The Barracuda/Jared, Sadie, And Sunny Sandler Cameo\n\nAlong with Adam Sandler’s own Netflix movies, his partnership with the streaming service has led to him producing a number of projects starring his famous friends. The Wrong Missy follows Tim Morris (David Spade) who invites Missy on a work retreat through a text message, he expects to go to Hawaii with the girl of his dreams. However, he realizes too late that he texted the wrong Missy and instead invited one of his previous, eccentric blind dates.\n\nJackie Sandler plays a major role in The Wrong Missy as “The Barracuda,” Tim Morris’ competitive coworker. It is the largest role Jackie had in a movie at that time with her appearing throughout the story and getting the spotlight in more than a few scenes. Jared Sandler also appears as Stuart, and Sadie and Sunny make cameos in the movie, credited as Lobby Strong Sadie and Sunny.\n\nJackie Sandler Appears As A Dentist\n\n50 First Dates is loosely based on an unbelievably true story as it stars Adam Sandler as Henry, a man living in Hawaii who falls for a girl named Lucy (Drew Barrymore). While Henry forms a quick connection with her over the course of one day, he learns that she has short-term memory loss and forgets about him with each new day, proving a challenge to maintain a relationship with him.\n\nJackie Sandler has another brief appearance in the movie, but it is also one of the quickest appearances by her in one of Sandler’s movies. The opening scene showcases a montage of women who have had romances with Henry discussing their time with him in Hawaii. Jackie plays one of these women, a dentist, who details her affair while tending to a patient. It is one of the rare times the real-life husband and wife have a confirmed romance in a movie, even if they don’t appear on screen together.\n\n6 You Don’t Mess With The Zohan (2008)\n\nJackie And Sadie Sandler Cameo\n\nFormer roommates Adam Sander and Judd Apatow famous collaborated on the comedy-drama Funny People, but they also worked together shortly before that as Apatow co-wrote the action-comedy You Don’t Mess With the Zohan with Sandler. The movie tells the story of a massive career change, which sees Zohan (Adam Sandler) tire of being an Israeli Special Forces Soldier before faking his death to live out his dream of being a hairstylist in New York City.\n\nDespite this being a long-awaited reunion between Sandler and Apatow, it features some of the smallest roles for his family members. Jackie and Sadie Sandler both make uncredited appearances in the 2008 movie as a mother and daughter who are waiting in line for goat rides. However, the film does feature appearances from many of Sandler’s friends, including Kevin James, Chris Rock, and John Turturro, and even includes a cameo from Mariah Carey.\n\n5 Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star (2011)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays A Casting Director\n\nA forgotten Sandler movie that also features Jackie Sandler is Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star. Like many kids, the titular Bucky Larson wants to follow in his parents’ footsteps. This desire inspires Bucky to leave the Midwest for Hollywood to pursue his dream career: being a porn star. The movie serves as the first starring vehicle for Nick Swardson, who was a regular in many other Sandler films in supporting roles, such as You Don’t Mess With the Zohan, Just Go With It, and Jack and Jill.\n\nJackie Sandler appears in Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star as a casting director who acts as an unwitting witness to one of Bucky’s failed auditions for a macaroni and cheese commercial. Unfortunately, with Bucky used to a specific type of on-air behavior, the simple audition turns into a vulgar and disgusting display, much to the horror of everyone witnessing. It is a single-scene appearance by Jackie, but she sells the hilarity of the situation.\n\n4 Murder Mystery (2019)\n\nJackie Sandler Plays “The Great Looking Flight Attendant”/Sunny And Sadie Cameo\n\nAdam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston have also proven to be an excellent on-screen team, with them even building their own franchise at Netflix. In Murder Mystery, Sandler plays New York City cop Nick Spitz and his wife, Audrey (Jennifer Aniston), who go on a European vacation to bring the spark back to their marriage. The trip doesn’t go to plan, however, as the couple ends up framed for the murder of an elderly billionaire."
