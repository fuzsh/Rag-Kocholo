On August 23 the original album will be released along with all four songs from the Southern Tracks EP and three previously unreleased live songs recorded the same year the album was released.\n\nCelebrating the 25th anniversary of Time, fans can pre-order the original LP’s first pressing on vinyl in three unique colors along with new Time merch today. In addition, the rare song, “It’s About Time,” from the Southern Tracks EP is now available on all streaming platforms.\n\n“Time is one of my top albums we made as a band,” shares Third Day frontman Mac Powell. “I’m often asked what my favorite Third Day song is, and I always return to ‘I’ve Always Love You.’ I love its acoustic down-home feel, and it was bold to start the album with it. It’s crazy to be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the album this year. I’m excited to get all four Southern Tracks out to our fans and I’m forever grateful for what the album meant and did in our and our fans’ lives.”\n\nTime, the band’s third album, was the first project produced by Monroe Jones, who went on to produce Offerings, the GRAMMY-winning Come Together, Offerings II, Chronology Vol. 1, and the band’s final album Revival."
