        "text": "The second collaboration between Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy and star Ryan Reynolds is the Netflix time-travel, multiversal adventure film, The Adam Project. In what seems like a practice run for an MCU movie, Reynolds plays a pilot who steals a time-traveling jet to go back in time to save his wife (Zoe Saldaña) from an assassination attempt. There, he teams with his younger parents (Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner) and his younger self (Walter Scobell) and action hijinks ensue. The streaming movie received middling reviews, but Reynolds was frequently singled out for dialing down his patented quips and increasing the emotional pathos.\n\n\"This movie is not entirely worthless. Reynolds and Scobell have amusing chemistry together that evokes a lot of '80s buddy comedies in a fresh way; here is a movie about the tired trope of mismatched partners where the mismatched partners are actually the same person.\" —Matt Singer, ScreenCrush\n\nThe DreamWorks animated cave people movie has an overprotective family driven out of their cave by curious daughter Eep (Emma Stone) only to uncover a whole new outside world of adventure. The family is led by Nicolas Cage and Catherine Keener as Grug and Ugga Crood. While Eep ignores her father's wishes and ventures outside the cave, she runs into a more modern human named Guy (Reynolds) and a romance starts to blossom, much to Grug's chagrin. Reynolds wasn't particularly singled out for his work and the film received middle-of-the-road reviews, but that didn't stop The Croods from becoming a stealth franchise that has spawned a sequel, two television series, and a couple of video games.\n\n\"A handful of adrenalizing sequences of animated anarchy can't save this story from feeling overly primitive.\" —Keith Staskiewicz, Entertainment Weekly\n\nReynolds' second streaming movie of 2022 was this holiday musical sendup of Charles Dickens' novella A Christmas Carol. The film stars Will Ferrell as The Ghost of Christmas Present, who must select an unredeemable soul to redeem, and that's Reynolds' Clint Briggs, an overzealous cutthroat media consultant with that trademark Reynolds smarmy charm. Since the film was on streaming, it's difficult to tell how the film performed, but critically, it hit right down the middle, with many critics dinging the film for being too long at over two hours and for not hitting the heights of the Ferrell-starring modern Christmas classic, Elf.\n\n\"Even Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell aren't charming enough to redeem AppleTV+'s humbug musical adaptation of A Christmas Carol.\" —Samantha Nelson, IGN\n\nThe surprisingly robust Croods franchise returned for a second go-around with even more of the open world for the cave people family to explore. Reynolds' Guy returns with girlfriend Eep (Emma Stone) in tow. They eventually run into the more evolved Bettermans, a family that initially frowns upon the idea of the Croods existing in the modern world. Many critics thought the film was an improvement from the original, while others thought it was too antic and overstuffed with creatures. But families looking for entertainment in theaters in November of 2020 probably didn't mind. Director Joel Crawford's next DreamWorks animated film would be the unexpected hit Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.\n\n\"The first film was so middle-of-the-road that most have probably forgotten it existed. Its sequel creates a more lasting impression, with vibrant animation and a wackadoodle sense of humour.\" —Olly Richards, Empire\n\nIt looks like Disney's fortunes are smiling on them with the success of Inside Out 2, and the hype for Deadpool & Wolverine is reaching a fever pitch with a massive global press tour featuring a tight-lipped cast running into this week's debut of the MCU's first R-rated film. The movie is coming on the heels of last November's The Marvels, the MCU's lowest grossing film to date. Last year did also include Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which made $476 million globally and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which made $845 million, so it wasn't a complete wash, but red and yellow have a lot of bromancing to do in order to vanquish the most dastardly supervillain of them all: Superhero Fatigue!\n\nIt may not help that the Shawn Levy-directed Deadpool & Wolverine is the only one of the three Deadpool films not to receive positive reviews from critics.\n\n\"I found this movie messy and overstuffed, but I laughed almost as often as I cringed from its obnoxiousness and can't dispute that a vast audience will delight in every moment. Even if they spend much of the running time sticking blades through each other's handily regenerating flesh, Reynolds and Jackman make sweet love and appear to be having a great time doing it.\" —David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nReynolds starred in yet another animated picture in 2013. This one has him playing Theo a.k.a. Turbo, a garden snail who dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500. Theo gains superspeed through a car race accident that plays out like a superhero-esque origin story. Critics either embraced the underdog sports meets The Fast and the Furious narrative or found it cliché. Most, however, were charmed by the Turbo voice cast, which also includes Paul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson, Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph, and Snoop Dogg. The film was notably spun off into Turbo Fast, a Flash-animated Netflix original series that kicked off the streamer's relationship with DreamWorks animation that continues to this day.\n\n\"All Turbo does is give Reynolds, Paul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson and Snoop Dogg the easiest paychecks they'll ever make, and its corporate overlords the chance to sell a few toys.\" —David Fear, Time Out\n\nWe've gotta admit, this one kinda got by us. The 2014 dark comedy stars Reynolds as a schizophrenic worker at a plumbing appliance center who has conversations with his pets that have deadly consequences. After a date with co-worker Fiona (Gemma Arterton) turns deadly, he stops taking his pills and his hallucinations increase. He then goes on a date with another co-worker Lisa (Anna Kendrick) and the cycle continues. Critics appreciated the off-kilter, violently comedic vibes of this under-the-radar flick. Curiously, Voices was directed by Marjane Satrapi, who wrote and illustrated the acclaimed Islamic Revolution coming-of-age graphic novel Persepolis.\n\n\"Reynolds moves on from Green Lantern in Satrapi's psycho-romp, pitched awkwardly between funny-haha and funny-peculiar, but blessed with enough style and smarts to merit a look.\" —Kevin Harley, Total Film\n\nRemember when romantic comedies were a regular mainstay in cinemas? Definitely, maybe? Canadian writer/director Adam Brooks' Definitely, Maybe is about a soon-to-be-divorced dad (Reynolds) recounting how he met his daughter's (Abigail Breslin) mom, but mixes in stories of his past relationships in a sort of romantic puzzle. The possible moms are played by Isla Fisher, Rachel Weisz, and Elizabeth Banks. Critics were honestly more concerned with Breslin, who was coming off of her Oscar-nominated performance in Little Miss Sunshine, but they appreciated Reynolds' shift to leading man status and, depending on the reviewer, were either charmed by the romantic plotting or put off by it being overly sentimental.\n\n\"The film is far from a complete washout, and this is chiefly a tribute to its immensely attractive and appealing cast. Ryan Reynolds proves to have the stuff of a true leading man.\" —Stephen Farber, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nRyan Reynolds previously worked with Deadpool & Wolverine co-writer/director Shawn Levy on this pandemic hit about Guy, an NPC (non-playable character; wait, this is Metacritic, you know what an NPC is!) that becomes self-aware of his status inside a video game and decides to become a hero. The sort-of original IP (if you ignore Grand Theft Auto and The Truman Show comparisons) got butts back into seats—it grossed over $330 million on a reported $125 million budget—in August of 2021 and reunited Reynolds with his Green Lantern co-star Taika Waititi and even included a cameo by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman! The film received mostly positive notices and helped get movie theaters back up and running.\n\n\"The plot may be nothing special, but Reynolds most certainly is. He's just so relatable, genial, nice, in an unforced sort of way that he makes the movie, which he also produced, a fun ride.\" —Soren Andersen, The Seattle Times\n\nAndrew Fleming (Threesome) co-wrote (with Sheryl Longin) and directed this delightful satire about two high-schoolers (Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams) on a White House tour in the early '70s who stumble into a room full of classified intel. Richard Nixon (Dan Hedaya) ends up befriending the girls to try and hide what they've uncovered, and they inadvertently become a part of the Watergate scandal. Ryan Reynolds has a small role as Chip, the beer-bong-using son of White House Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman, whom Dunst's character uses to find information to get to Woodward and Bernstein. Reynolds wasn't particularly singled out in reviews, but this 25-year-old gem is ready for rediscovery.\n\n\"A flinty and deeply enjoyable little comedy. There's genius in its absurdity.\" —Stephanie Zacharek, Salon\n\nAfter Reynolds' misguided Deadpool/Wade Wilson cameo in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he would famously lobby then-Deadpool theatrical studio 20th Century Fox for a do-over, even participating in a proof-of-concept sizzle reel with eventual director TIm Miller that was legendarily leaked and helped get the film greenlit. The result was a marriage of character and actor that is rarely seen, with Reynolds fully embodying the comic-book merc with a mouth. Critics and audiences were largely impressed with the R-rated action/comedy, and it soon became the most successful mutant title in the Fox library. A new franchise within another franchise was born.\n\n\"This movie's junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career.\" —Peter Travers, Rolling Stone\n\nThis high-concept thriller has Reynolds buried alive for most of the film in an homage to Hitchcock's Lifeboat and Rope. Much buzzed about at Sundance in 2010, Buried was scooped up by Lionsgate for release later that year. The film was well-received, with critics warming to the experimental nature of the story that focuses entirely on Reynolds; his performance was widely praised, as was the claustrophobic setting and thrills that it elicited. Some criticisms were levied at the political overtones and the frankly nihilistic vibes that are produced by being trapped inside a coffin with someone for 90 minutes straight.\n\n\"A well-made, excruciating exercise in containment and sustained suspense. It's a breakout moment for Reynolds. Is it a fun hour and a half? No. But it succeeds within its own straitened contours. It's an intriguing squirm. Now, please get me outta here.\" —Ann Hornaday, Washington Post\n\nWhen Wade's girlfriend is killed, he emerges from his grief as an X-Men trainee and eventually runs into time-traveling mutant Cable (Josh Brolin in the flesh and not snapping Infinity Stones), lucky Domino (Zazie Beetz) and normie X-Force member Peter (Rob Delaney). Former stuntman David Leitch takes over as director and the story and action set-pieces are even bigger and more meta this time around. The film even earned slightly more critical praise than its predecessor. Curiously, the film was later cut down to PG-13 (probably to ease a release in China) as Once Upon a Deadpool, itself a meta take on The Princess Bride that even starred that film's Fred Savage. Let's see if Wade's messing with time pays off in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\n\"It all boils down to one important fact: Reynolds gets these comics.\" —Richard Whittaker, Austin Chronicle\n\nThis coming-of-age charmer from writer/director Greg Mottola (Superbad) is a comedy/drama set at a theme park named Adventureland in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the late '80s. There, recent college graduate James (Jesse Eisenberg) must work at the park to save up money for a trip to Europe. The life lessons he learns from the people at the park (played by the likes of Kristen Stewart, Martin Starr, Bill Hader, and Kristen Wiig) are just as important as the ones he would've picked up overseas. Ryan Reynolds plays Mike, the park maintenance guy and part-time musician who's seen it all. The film was well-received for its nostalgic vibes and for the performances of its ensemble cast that are captured here right before all of their mainstream careers took off.\n\n\"Somehow the story of a young man's coming of age never gets old, at least when it is told with the kind of sweetness and intelligence Adventureland displays.\" —A.O. Scott, The New York Times"
