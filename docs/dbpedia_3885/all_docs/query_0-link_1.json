Set in early 1900s France, a widow renews a former romantic interest, until it is discovered that he has had a past fling with one of her new employees, a nanny. This sets the two women into many well-mannered accusations and conversations, but no modern brawling, and puts him in the middle, or possibly on the outside.",
