        "text": "Watching the Star Wars movies in order is a fantastic way to prove you are one with the Force (the Force is with you). Whether you prefer watching them in chronological order or release order, we have you covered.\n\nWatching the Star Wars movies in chronological order allows you to experience the Skywalker saga as it unfolds, getting the prequel trilogy (which didn't score highly on our ranked list) out of the way early. On the other hand, if you opt to marathon this iconic franchise in release order, you get to relive the story as it was originally presented.\n\nIf you don't own physical copies of all the movies, don't worry — Disney Plus has you covered. As the current home of all things Star Wars, it allows you to stream every movie and TV show in the franchise. They offer both monthly and annual subscriptions, so if you're not interested in a long-term commitment, you can subscribe just long enough to enjoy all the top Star Wars content.\n\nIf all the Star Wars movies in order aren't enough for you to get your sci-fi fix, it could be worth checking out our guides for the best sci-fi movies and TV shows to stream on Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Nextlix and Amazon Prime. Our guide also includes Star Wars TV shows, for added context and in case you want to watch those too. So, read on below to get the round-up of Star Wars movies in order. Oh, and one last thing: watch or watch not, there is no try.\n\nNote: This page does contain spoilers.\n\nStar Wars movies in chronological order\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures (2023)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2003-2005)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch (2021-2024)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nStar Wars: Rebels (2014-2018)\n\nAndor (2022)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope (1977)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nThe Mandalorian, season 1 and 2 (2019-2020)\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett, season 1 (2021)\n\nThe Mandalorian, season 3 (2023)\n\nAhsoka (2023)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance, season 1 (2018)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 7 - The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 8 - The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance, season 2 (2019)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 9 - The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nStar Wars: Visions (2021-2023)*\n\n*These aren't really canon, so they don't fit into the proper chronology.\n\nStar Wars movies in release order\n\nStar Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope (1977)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2003-2005)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\nStar Wars: Rebels (2014-2018)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 7 - The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 8 - The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance, season 1 (2018)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance, season 2 (2019)\n\nStar Wars: Episode 9 - The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nThe Mandalorian, season 1 and 2 (2019-2020)\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett, season 1 (2021)\n\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch (2021-2023)\n\nStar Wars: Visions (2021-2023)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nAndor (2022)\n\nThe Mandalorian, season 3 (2023)\n\nAhsoka (2023)\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures (2023)\n\nStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace\n\nRelease date: May 19, 1999\n\nCast: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman\n\nIf you want to watch all the Star Wars movies in chronological order then sadly your marathon starts with the very first (and pretty awful) prequel movie.

This film sees Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi discover a slave boy on Tatooine called Anakin Skywalker who's chock full of Midi-chlorians.\n\nUnfortunately, the Jedi council isn't keen on training the child as a Jedi. But, while trying to protect Queen Padmé Amidala, Qui-Gon Jinn is killed by Sith Darth Maul and in honor of his memory Obi-Wan Kenobi promises to train the kid. Biiiiig mistake.\n\nStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\n\nRelease date: May 16, 2002\n\nCast: Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen\n\nA few years later, Anakin is training as a Padawan under Obi-Wan Kenobi when the now Senator Padmé Amidala’s life is threatened once again. While Obi-Wan investigates, Anakin and Padmé fall in love, despite the Jedi Code which forbids attachments. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers an army of clones being created for the Republic, as well as an attempt by the Separatist group led by Count Dooku to overthrow the Republic using a droid army.\n\nObi-Wan is captured, along with Anakin and Padmé who try to save him, and all three are eventually rescued by the clone army, authorized by the newly powerful Chancellor Palpatine.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nRelease date: August 15, 2008\n\nCast: Matt Lanter, Ashley Eckstein, James Arnold Taylor\n\nNot long after, the Republic's clone army and Dooku’s droid army are at war, with Dooku's Sith Master Darth Sidious kidnapping gangster Jabba the Hutt's son, Rotta, to try and frame the Jedi. Anakin and his new Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, must try and save the little Huttlet, while Obi-Wan negotiates a treaty with Jabba. Worried for Anakin's safety, Padmé attempts to contact Jabba's uncle, Ziro, only to discover that he's actually in on the plan to kill Rotta so he can take over the Hutts.\n\nAnakin and Ahsoka eventually rescue Rotta, but Jabba tries to have them killed anyway, believing they're responsible for kidnapping him until Padmé reveals what she knows.

Palpatine lures Anakin to the dark side with the promise of saving Padmé's life, and orders the clone army to kill the Jedi, declaring himself Emperor.\n\nPadmé and Obi-Wan try to convince the new Darth Vader to return to the light side, but they fight which leaves Vader mortally wounded. Meanwhile, Padmé dies giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia, and Obi-Wan decides to go into hiding with the children. Palpatine rescues Vader, giving him a suit to keep him alive, and telling him that he killed Padmé.\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story\n\nRelease date: May 25, 2018\n\nCast: Alden Ehrenreich, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke\n\nNearly 10 years later, Imperial Flight Academy dropout Han Solo is thrown into a cell with a Wookiee called Chewbacca and the pair team up to escape.

They’re thwarted by marauders, the Cloud-Riders, but convince Vos to give them another chance as long as his lieutenant (and former love interest of Han's) Qi'ra tags along.\n\nTeaming up with smuggler Lando Calrissian, they use his ship the Millennium Falcon to steal the coaxium, but are discovered by the Cloud-Riders who reveal they're actually rebels fighting against the Empire.
