        "text": "Shark movies are notoriously intense, campy, gory, and sometimes absurd. That’s precisely what makes them so much fun. So if you’re looking for a fun way to spend your evening, you might want to know what shark movies are on Netflix. You’ll find some good shark movies and some bad ones on our list. Whatever floats your boat (no pun intended!). To make things especially interesting, we didn’t include any of the Jaws movies. That would be a little too easy.\n\nHere’s our list of the 20 best movies about sharks on Netflix (and beyond), in no particular order.\n\nTable of contents\n\n47 Meters Down: Uncaged (2019)\n\nIMDB Score: 5.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 45%\n\nGenre: Adventure, Drama, Horror\n\nStarring: Corinne Foxx, Sophie Nelisse, Brianne Tju\n\nPlatform: Netflix\n\nPlot: Two sisters decide to explore an underwater city.

This notorious B-movie began the Mega Shark series and is arguably one of the best so-bad-it’s-good movies you can find.\n\nSharknado 2: The Second One (2014)\n\nIMDB Score: 4.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 59%\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy\n\nStarring: Ian Ziering, Tara Reid, Vivica A. Fox\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: Fin returns in this self-aware second installment of the Sharknado film series. This time, floods bring sharks to New York. As tornadoes heighten the drama, Fin and company try to survive the onslaught of sharks that dwarf the one in the first installment.\n\nPlanet of the Sharks (2016)\n\nIMDB Score: 2.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: Not Available\n\nGenre: Science Fiction, Action\n\nStarring: Brandon Auret, Stephanie Beran, Alex Anlos\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: If you’ve seen any of the Planet of the Apes movies, then you know the plot of this one. It’s the future, and highly advanced sharks have taken over the planet. The few remaining humans on Earth must find a way to take out the sharks’ leader if they want to survive. Absurd? Yep. Fun? You better believe it.\n\nBlue Demon (2004)\n\nIMDB Score: 2.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: Not Available\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy\n\nStarring: Dedee Pfeiffer, Randall Batinkoff, Christine Lakin\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: A government-backed science project goes awry and unleashes great white sharks on California’s shorelines. If that doesn’t sell you on this pure-camp B-movie, then you should know that the head shark’s goal is to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge by unleashing a neutron bomb. You’re welcome.\n\nSharknado 4: The Fourth Awakens (2016)\n\nIMDB Score: 3.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 15%\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy\n\nStarring: Ian Ziering, Tara Reid\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: Fin is back at it in the fourth installment of the Sharknado franchise. This time, he’s battling a sand sharknado and trying to save the world from his mortal enemies. A near-endless list of cameos and familiar schtick will please fans of the series.\n\nOpen Water 2: Adrift (2007)\n\nIMDB Score: 5.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 40%\n\nGenre: Horror, Drama\n\nStarring: Susan May Pratt, Richard Speight Jr., Niklaus Lange\n\nPlatform: Netflix, Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: A group of friends is stranded in the ocean after a birthday yacht trip takes a turn for the worst. Unlike its predecessor, “Open Water 2: Adrift” is not a true story, which you’ll probably notice shortly after starting this fun mystery-style take on the shark movie genre.\n\nRaging Sharks (2005)\n\nIMDB Score: 2.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: Not Available\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\nStarring: Corin Nemec, Vanessa Angel, Corbin Bernsen\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: B-movie lovers will enjoy this alien invasion/shark movie hybrid about a team of marine researchers who are preyed upon by a nasty group of great white sharks. It’s not always clear whether the filmmakers are aware of how silly the movie is, which typically makes for a better B-movie (all things Sharknado aside).\n\nDark Tide (2012)\n\nIMDB Score: 4.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 0%\n\nGenre: Action, Drama\n\nStarring: Halle Berry, Olivier Martinez, Ralph Brown\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: Halle Berry stars as a diving instructor who has suffered a traumatic great white shark attack. Though she no longer feels comfortable in the water, she accepts an opportunity she can’t turn down when a millionaire and his son are looking for a guide through the notorious Shark Alley. Any movie that gets a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes is destined for cult-classic greatness, especially when audiences seem to really enjoy it.\n\nOpen Water 3: Cage Dive (2017)\n\nIMDB Score: 4.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 25%\n\nGenre: Horror, Drama\n\nStarring: Joel Hogan, Josh Potthoff, Megan Peta Hill\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: This Blair Witch-style installment of the Open Water franchise tells the story of three friends as they venture into a shark cage to audition for a reality TV show. As you might expect, things don’t go according to plan. The found-footage approach injects new life into the popular shark film series and the entire genre.\n\nShark Night (2011)\n\nIMDB Score: 4.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 19%\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nStarring: Sara Paxton, Katharine McPhee, Alyssa Diaz\n\nAvailable in: Buy on DVD\n\nPlot: Seven college friends take a trip to a Louisiana lake, only to be terrorized by a gang of sharks. Though critics originally slated the film, audiences were more accepting of it as a solid addition to the shark movie genre.\n\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\n\nIMDB Score: 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 56%\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nStarring: Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Angelica Houston, Jeff Goldblum\n\nPlatform: Amazon Prime\n\nPlot: A washed-up oceanographer/filmmaker seeks revenge on the shark that killed his partner. You probably won’t find this out-of-the-box pick on any other shark movie lists, and you might even debate whether it’s actually a shark movie. Nevertheless, Wes Anderson’s cult classic is all about Bill Murray’s quest to find (and destroy) a jaguar shark."
