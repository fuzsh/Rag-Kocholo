        "text": "Six women artists are presenting major exhibitions – the key here is that they are all over 60, and several of them are presenting their first institutional solo exhibitions. ArtsHub salutes their long careers, and place in Australian art history.\n\nDumbrell is aged 82 (b.1941), and this is the first state art museum survey to celebrate the painter’s work. One might say, ‘It’s time to right some wrongs and give this incredible artist her moment.’"
