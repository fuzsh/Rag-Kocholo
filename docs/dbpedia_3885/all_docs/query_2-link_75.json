        "text": "Want to know what half a billion dollars looks like? To Prime Video, it looks like its big-budget fantasy television series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The show, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's popular books, heads into Season 2 with a lot to prove to both Prime Video and fans after the lukewarm reception to its first season. With a season of experience under its belt and a lot of setup for the whole series out of the way (and a whole lot of cash), there's reason for fans to be optimistic that they'll see some improvement.\n\nIf elves and orcs aren't your thing, then tune into the action-comedy film JACKPOT!, starring Akwafina as a \"lucky\" lottery winner and John Cena as the man who protects her from an onslaught of opportunists who can claim her prize if they can kill her. The streamer's other big release this month is Batman: Caped Crusader, an animated series from the co-creator of Lost, the director of The Batman, and the creator of Batman: The Animated Series.\n\nBelow, you'll find our picks for the best shows and movies to watch on Amazon Prime Video in August, as well as the full list of everything coming to Prime Video and Freevee, the free service that's accessible through Prime Video but doesn't require Prime membership.\n\nLast month's guide: New Prime Video shows and movies in July 2024\n\nMore streaming:\n\nThe complete guide to summer TV\n\nNew Netflix shows and movies\n\nNew HBO and Max shows and movies\n\nNew Hulu shows and movies\n\nThe best new movies and shows on Prime Video in August\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader (Aug. 1)\n\nHow many Batman TV shows are there? Seven? 23? 172? Well, add one more, as this animated series about the Dark Knight hits Prime Video at the top of the month. Produced by J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves (director of The Batman), and Bruce Timm (creator of Batman: The Animated Series), Batman: Caped Crusader features Hamish Linklater as the voice of Batman, Christina Ricci as Catwoman, Jamie Chung as Harley Quinn, and Diedrich Bader as Two-Face. The series was originally set up at Max, but was scuttled and picked up by Prime Video, which has already renewed it for a second season. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nJACKPOT! (Aug. 15)\n\nJohn Cena and Awkwafina seem to be in everything, so naturally they're both in this action comedy film from director Paul Feig. The premise is simple (and stupid): The winner of a California lottery (Awkwafina) can cash the prize as long as she stays alive from the threat of all the jackpot hunters, who can legally claim the prize if they kill her. Cena plays a \"lottery protection agent,\" who tries to help her survive for a cut of the cash. I have so many questions about how this all works. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2 (Aug. 29)\n\nHave you heard? Tom Bombadil is making his live-action debut. Despite being well known to fans of the books, the mysterious Lord of the Rings character has never appeared in a major TV or movie adaptation — until now. Rory Kinnear will debut his take on Old Tom in Season 2 of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, a show that already boasts a cast list even longer than its title (and the budget to match). And here's another piece of Middle-earth gossip: Sauron (Charlie Vickers) is getting a new look, assuming the guise of a blond elf. Here's everything else we know about The Rings of Power Season 2. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nMore on Amazon:\n\nBest TV shows on Amazon Prime Video right now\n\nBest movies on Amazon Prime Video right now\n\nAmazon Prime Video pricing, channels, and deals\n\nEverything coming to Prime Video and Freevee in August\n\nAug. 1\n\n21 Jump Street (2012)\n\n22 Jump Street (2014)\n\nAdventureland (2009)\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973)\n\nAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power (2017)\n\nAn Inconvenient Truth (2006)\n\nAnnie (1982)\n\nAnnie (2014)\n\nAtomic Blonde (2017) - Available on Freevee for free with ads\n\nBad News Bears (2005)\n\nBasic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction (2006)\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader (2024)\n\nBorn On The Fourth Of July (1990)\n\nBowfinger (1999)\n\nBreakdown (1997)\n\nCinema Paradiso (1990)\n\nDante's Peak (1997)\n\nDarkman (1990)\n\nDeath Becomes Her (1992)\n\nDiary Of A Mad Housewife (1970)\n\nDon't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)\n\nEastern Promises (2007)\n\nEmma.
