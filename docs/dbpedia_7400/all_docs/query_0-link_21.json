        "text": "Fri 28 Jul 2017\n\nOne of the UK’s biggest outdoor classical concerts, the much-loved Darley Park Concert will be returning on Sunday 3 September in the stunning natural amphitheatre of Darley Park. The event is supported by Hannells Estates Agents, Flint Bishop Solicitors, HUUB, Mortgage Advice Bureau, PKF Cooper Parry, Specsavers and Stratstone BMW Derby.\n\nThis year’s concert will be run in partnership with Classic FM, the UK’s most popular classical music station, which celebrates its 25th birthday in September.As in previous years, the Derby-based orchestra Sinfonia Viva, the Orchestra of the East Midlands, who are supported by Rolls-Royce, will be performing at the concert.\n\nTim Lihoreau, presenter of Classic FM’s More Music Breakfast, will host the event and will also broadcast his breakfast show from Classic FM’s East Midlands studio the following morning. Tim presents the biggest breakfast show on UK commercial radio, with 1.7 million people tuning in every week!\n\nThis year’s programme is guaranteed to delight everyone, with an eclectic mix of returning favourites, popular pieces to celebrate Derby’s 40th year as a City, and a selection of classics chosen by you.\n\nIt has links to Derby's 40th year as a City with performances of famous cricket theme Soul Limbo and the Youth of Britain March. The City’s industrial heritage will also be celebrated with Funiculi Funicula, Runaway Train and Come Fly with Me, whilst Derby County Football Clubis also acknowledged with a performance of Steve Bloomer’s Watching. The event will feature popular pieces from past concerts that will send a shiver up your spine including Thunderbirds, the Star Wars theme and the fantastic Bohemian Rhapsody. The programme also includes three selections made by a public vote: Goodwin: 633 Squadron (2006), Prokofiev: Montagues and Capulets from Romeo and Juliet (2015) and Steiner: Lara’s Theme – Gone with the Wind (2008).\n\nSinfonia Viva have confirmed the concert conductor will be James Holmes along with baritone, Grant Doyle as soloist, who are both regulars at the concert. James has conducted a wide range of concerts and has lots of experience with opera and musical theatre. Born in Adelaide, Grant has appeared in several concerts with Sinfonia Viva, including previous Darley Park outdoor concerts to audiences of over 30,000! As a busy concert soloist he has performed for the Royal Opera along with solo performances with the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Australian Ballet.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming Derbyshire Carers Choir, who will be opening the evening’s entertainment. Set up as part of Sinfonia Viva’s 35th anniversary programme, the Carers Choir is open to everyone from Derbyshire and beyond, priding itself on being accessible and fun for all. The choir will perform some great pieces of music including songs from the shows, choral favourites and pop classics, that are guaranteed to win your heart!\n\nThe Dalesmen Male Voice Choir will be performing during the concert interval. The Dalesmen have grown from a few like-minded friends to a near 70 strong choir! They have always believed that everyone should be given the chance and encouragement to sing and we're sure you'll give them a warm welcome at Darley Park this year.\n\nEarly bird tickets are available to book before the day of the concert and are priced at £2.50 with under 16s free, although they still need a ticket. Tickets for over 16s will be priced at £5 on the day.\n\nWith tickets now on sale it is never too early to book for this fantastic evening of classical music and fireworks!
