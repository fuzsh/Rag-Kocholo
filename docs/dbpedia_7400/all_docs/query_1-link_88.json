        "text": "Molly Doyle, daughter of Nancy and Jim Doyle, Davenport, passed away peacefully at home February 5, 2021. She was 49 years old.\n\nA Memorial Mass will be held on Friday, May 21, 2021 at 4:00PM at Sacred Heart Cathedral. Halligan-McCabe-DeVries is assisting the family with arrangements.\n\nMolly McGuire Doyle was born May 18, 1971 at Moline Public Hospital, Moline, Illinois.\n\nMolly was a beautiful baby and carried that image throughout her life. She was very spiritual, loving, caring, intelligent, classy, and fun loving.\n\nMolly was very successful professionally. She held positions in human resource and procurement, including high-tech professionals and corporate infrastructure. She held management positions with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Sears Corporate, AT&T in Chicago and JC Penny headquarters in Plano (Dallas) Texas – always advancing and improving herself.\n\nMolly attended Grant Elementary, Moline, St. John’s International School, Brussels, Belgium, Eisenhower Elementary, Sudlow Junior High, and Central High in Davenport. She graduated from the University of Iowa with majors in Communications and French. She was fluent in French until the end. She loved the language while living in Europe as a little girl with her parents and brothers Jon and Patrick.\n\nMolly’s family includes her parents, Nancy (who she always called “Beautiful”) and Jim, brother Jon, his wife Charlotte, their children Grace Anne and Charles, San Francisco, California, and her brother Patrick (who she always called “Cheeto”). She is also survived by eight aunts and uncles: Colleen and Kenneth Ring, Nebraska, Sharon and Timothy Doyle, Paulette and Patrick Doyle, Karen and Kevin Doyle all from South Dakota, and 18 cousins, numerous grand cousins and hundreds of friends and associates internationally.\n\nMolly was preceded in death by her maternal and paternal grandparents Mary and John McGuire and Lucille and Edward Doyle, aunts and uncles Louella and Walter Canney, Marilyn and Richard Doyle, and Kenneth Doyle.\n\nMay God Bless Molly and all of the faithfully departed though the Mercy of God, rest in peace and eternal happiness. Amen."
