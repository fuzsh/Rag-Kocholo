        "text": "Cant blame ya, T! I did the sammmmmeeee thing. Secured the bag and shortly thereafter made a huge announcement to the world with my baby boy. The feeling of your firstborn is indescribable. Kind of like the reaction my wife and I had when I got a product hit out of a case with this 2021 National Treasures Trevor Lawrence 1 of 1 RPA ü§ë We're over here like,\"...soooo...baby #2?!\" ü§£ (For those of you who are either just catching on, or haven't quite paid attention yet...yes...the collectibles market has seen significant uptick in recent years. We saw a spike around 2008/2009...and then a \"Covid Era\" growth rate unparalleled by majority of asset driven industries. Once a childhood hobby, sports cards have become a necessary commodity in many investor's portfolios.) The card depicted in this post came out of a case of one of Panini 3 most upper echelon NBA/NFL licenced products, National Treasures FOTL (First Off the Line). At the time I bought in (close to, if not on, product release day) these cases were selling to the consumer market at premium rates of $28,000 and higher per 4 box case. Each box contains 8 cards, making a case only 32 cards in total. National Treasures boasts a significant portion of the top 10 most valuable cards ever sold. SPECIFICALLY, the hunt surrounds the infamous \"Logoman\" & \"True\" RPA (rookie patch autographs). With every card being serial numbered 1 to 99, there a limited cases released each year. 2021 saw a significant demand with 6 or so starting QBs being drafted first round. Some panned out and others have some work to do. In the hobby space, we call the process of determining which will be which early on \"prospecting\". Some of the names from that class include Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Mac Jones, Justin Fields, Ja'marr Chase, and many others. To no surprise, similar to athlete salaries, in NFL products you are soecifically chasing top QBs and T Law proved himself to be the top of his draft class. Another well recognized sales comp from the same product was Trevor Lawrence's NFL Shield 1 of 1 that sold for $336,000 by Goldin in August of 2022. Ken Goldin is far from a stranger to being behind some of the highest sales in sports collectibles and was nominated for an Emmy for his Netflix Series \"King of Collectibles\". Season 2 out now. ü´° ‚ö†Ô∏èüìàüìäSTAY TUNED: Frank DiNote (the man in charge of private sales at Goldin) and I have been working on something for quite some time now that will be big news for TCA. As soon as semantics are ironed out...you MIGHT just see one of those before mentioned \"Logoman\" cards hit their premier auction soon. ü§´ü§´ü§´\n\nFind the Horseshoe! This week, I had the pleasure of spending time with the #Greenscapesfla team out of Naples, Florida, when #HeatherPruchansky mentioned that her horse had lost a shoe. What began as a simple horseshoe search for her horse Danny turned into a full-blown competition, as any dignified salesperson would make it. We arrived at 7 a.m. sharp, ready for the search. The goal was to find the missing horseshoe, and the stakes were high: the one who did not find the horseshoe had to buy breakfast. There were some real lessons to be learned today. First, play by your own rules. My competitor, Heather, arrived ten minutes before me and had already devised a strategy. It was no surprise that her preparedness and initiative-taking approach gave her a significant edge. This experience reminded me of some of the most valuable lessons in sales: 1. Preparation is Key: Arriving early and having a plan can make all the difference. Just as Heather did, being prepared can put you ahead of others. 2. Create Your Own Rules: Don‚Äôt just follow the established norms; think outside the box and set your own path to your success. 3. Stay Competitive: Treat every challenge as a competition and have fun! It is no wonder Heather continually achieves, whether as a girls high school basketball coach, a superstar business developer at Greenscapes, or mastering the art of sleuthing for horseshoes. #greenscapesfl #sales #strategy #discipline #sperber\n\nMY 2024 KENTUCKY DERBY GUIDE IS NOW AVAILABLE!
