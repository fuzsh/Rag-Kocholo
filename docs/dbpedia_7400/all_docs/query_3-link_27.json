        "text": "What it is like for you returning to the role of Robin Oakapple and to Opera North?\n\n“It is such an honour to be asked to reprise the role for Opera North in this brilliant production of Ruddigore. I am very grateful for being given the opportunity in the first place, and to know that it was successful enough to be revived so soon is just icing on the cake.”\n\nHow does the rehearsal process differ for a revived role rather than a new one?\n\n“The rehearsal process is quite different, it begins with simply remembering what we did the first time around, and then becomes an exercise in finding freshness and spontaneity. Also it is a chance to polish up some rough edges. I have done revivals before where I wasn’t in the original production and I find that more difficult – wearing another’s shoes – but this is a joy. The rehearsals have been progressing very swiftly because we are lucky enough to have all of the original cast back, who are all brilliant actors and singers and are fantastic to work with. We are now ready for Jo Davies and her team to put it on the stage again.”\n\nHow do you find performing the two different ‘characters’ of Robin Oakapple and Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd?\n\n“The important thing I have to remember is that there aren’t two characters, it is really Robin all the time. I try to keep him as normal and affable as possible. When he becomes Sir Ruthven, he is forced into playing the part of a bad Baronet but never feels comfortable and after much guilt and comedy torture, finds a way out of it. It is a gift of a role – a character playing a character, with all the over-the-top fun that brings.”\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about this production?\n\n“The best things about this production is all of my colleagues, who create a mad world of comedy characters around me which still make me chuckle, the clear and deft storytelling of Jo Davies’ direction and the exquisite sepia flavoured costume and design – love that hat and cape!”\n\nGrant Doyle plays Robin Oakapple / Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd in Gilbert & Sullivan’s Ruddigore, which opens on Friday 30 September at Leeds Grand Theatre, before touring to Nottingham Theatre Royal, Newcastle Theatre Royal, The Lowry, Salford and the Barbican, London. More details and booking information is available here.\n\nOver the last week, I have been watching rehearsals for Ruddigore, which opens on September 30 after its huge success in early 2010. While writing this, I am cosied up next to two skeletons who live in a prop box when they are not on stage. The atmosphere is relaxed, as everyone loves working on this production. Choreographer Kay will often run warm up sessions, so performers are prepared for the energetic movement sequences on the rake. Before they get to the point where a whole scene or an act are run through, rehearsals are about simultaneity as well as repetition. A sequence is repeated and refined as the performers co-ordinate the many things that happen at the same time (singing, words, movement, gesture, facial expression, reactions). There are also some intermittent periods, where performers are going over steps, music and text, spoken dialogue or movement sequences in isolation. At a Ruddigore rehearsal, a scene in Act 2 sees director Jo Davies talking through a point involving a cloak with the singer of Robin, while Rose and Richard are practising a lift – impressive, as Amy Freston (Rose) sings some very high notes while flung head down over Richard’s (Hal Cazalet) shoulder. They practise it ‘dry’ several times, doing the movements on their own, then running through it again and marking the notes, while a line of chorus bridesmaids practises dainty steps, with the choreographer Kay demonstrating alongside them (but mind the tiger rug along the way!). To a passer-by, this might just seem like a hive of activity, but it’s a flurry of micro-rehearsals before everyone comes back together again with piano for an improved version of the sequence.\n\nThe next day, the gents who sing the parts of the Murgatroyd ancestors practise the choreography of ‘The Ghosts’ High Noon’. One ghost gallops in on an imaginary horse, one persistently chases Baronet Ruthven with a lance – nothing is safe from these mischievous ghouls. This is a show stopping number of skilfully choreographed mayhem, meaning lots of detailed one-by-one rehearsals, concerned with cues, timing and position in the space, often while manipulating props (my skeletal rehearsal room companions!). And of course there’s an opportunity to trip over the tiger rug.\n\nRuddigore is a performance which requires a lot of energy – try performing a Charleston on a raked stage while singing, or try dancing round a couple in an excitable group of singing bridesmaids at least twenty times until it’s exactly right, not to mention spooky dances while singing about the ghosts’ high noon in forte. Finally, try finding your breath in the vigorous finale and its infamous patter, congratulating Mad Margaret and Sir Despard Murgatroyd in William Gilbert’s immortal words:\n\n‘Prompted by a keen desire to evoke,\n\nAll the blessed calm of matrimony’s yoke,\n\nThey will toddle off tomorrow\n\nFrom this scene of sin and sorrow\n\nFor to settle, settle, settle, settle, settle, settle\n\nIn the town of Basingstoke!’\n\nDr Kara McKechnie lectures in theatre and performance at the University of Leeds. Her book on Opera North will be published by Emerald in early 2013.\n\nWith two weeks to go until the opening of Gilbert & Sullivan’s Ruddigore, Kay Shepherd explains why returning to the choreography is like meeting old friends:\n\n“Having had such a joyous time choreographing the original production of Ruddigore for Opera North in 2010, I was both excited and a little apprehensive about returning for the revival. Happily, any concerns about keeping the working process fresh were unfounded and I am now at the start of rehearsal week three, with two really positive weeks behind me.\n\n“Most of the cast is the same as before and I was correct in believing that the majority of the movement and dance would ‘come back’ to the performers’ bodies with a little help from music, lyrics, props, other actors and myself.\n\n“The rediscovery of movements is sometimes like bumping into old friends… much excitement! We then have to remember why we became friends in the first place and not get overtaken with the joy of muscle memory.\n\n“Most of the choreography in the production is as before, but there have been natural developments through re-rehearsal and I have made a few small changes.\n\n“The main objective for me is for the final product to be clear in style and narrative, and for the performers to look and feel comfortable with what I ask them to do.\n\n“And so onwards. I like Leeds, I like Opera North and I like Ruddigore. Happy Days.”\n\nKay Shepherd\n\nChoreographer, Ruddigore\n\nOpera North’s production of Ruddigore, by Gilbert & Sullivan, directed by Jo Davies, opens at Leeds Grand Theatre on Friday 30 September.

The answers are revealed below.\n\n1) ‘I’ve never felt such pure devotion\n\nIn all my life before.\n\nI tell myself that this emotion\n\nWill last for ever more!\n\nBut then my jealous heart imagines another holds her fast,\n\nWhile I, poor fool, have no courage to kiss the ground where she has passed.’\n\nHerman tells Tomsky of his love for Lisa in The Queen of Spades\n\n2) ‘Your strength can protect me.\n\nYour smile so honest and so open you tell me things I was quite unaware of. I’m so contented, I’m so contented…\n\nJust love me a little, a very very little.\n\nThe little love I ask for is no more than a child needs.’\n\nCio-Cio-San pleads with Pinkerton in Madama Butterlfy\n\n3) ‘In bygone days I had thy love,\n\nThou hadst my heart.\n\nBut fate, all human vows above\n\nOur lives did part.\n\nBy the old love thou hadst for me,\n\nBy the fond heart that beat for thee,\n\nBy joys that never now can be,\n\nGrant thou prayer!’\n\nRose Maybud to Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore\n\nCongratulations to CHARLOTTE who was picked at random from all entrants with the correct answer.
