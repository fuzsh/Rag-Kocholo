He will accompany Royal Opera House regulars Grant Doyle and Amar Muchhala, Mezzo-soprano Hollie-anne Bangham and our student performer, Clémence Gleizes.\n\nThe programme includes soothing classics by Mozart, Bizet, Puccini and Britten as well as a rousing sing-a-long version of the Toreador’s Song from Carmen by Bizet.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\n\nHello all lovers of classical music.\n\nMy name is Dominic J. Walsh, and I have been appointed the Artistic Coordinator for Woolwich Opera Works for 2019.\n\nSunday, April 28th, will be the Premier Concert of the 2019 Season and WOW will bring you three more scheduled concerts later in the year; Jun 30th, Sep 15th & Nov 23rd. Hopefully more will sit themselves nicely into the calendar as the months progress.\n\nThis first concert will see professional singers Lucy Hall, Emma Stannard and Jamie Rock joined with RCM student Samuel Stopford accompanied by WOW regular, Janet Haney.\n\nThe music will feature operatic arias, art songs, some classics and some new favourites. We will also have a audience sing-along to end the concert.\n\nWoolwich Opera Works is committed to bringing classical music to the local community. We strive to open the world of classical singing to the public and guide them through the power, the mystery and the incredible drama of opera, art song and classical music.\n\nWe very much look forward to meeting newcomers and welcoming our regular supporters.\n\nEveryone is welcome so if you know people, and they like music, or they are curious about classical singing, or they want to sit and listen, or if they want to enjoy a cup of tea with some wonderful friendly people, or they want to sing along, or if they want to experience live music, then come along!\n\nSee you there!\n\nWe were thrilled to start the year with a FREE Concert series in All Saints Shooters Hill. The concert was a Spanish themed event and featured opera excerpts and Spanish songs with international soloists. It was an absolute triumph and we were touched and thrilled by the feedback from our local community - many whom had never heard opera before. We managed to just about cover our costs and then received a couple of unexpected donations which helped us to break even. Based on the success of it we have planned two further concerts on 30 April and 25 June. We are inspired to continue sharing our gifts and building an opera audience within this community."
