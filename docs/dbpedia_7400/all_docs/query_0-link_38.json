        "text": "Frederick Douglass \"Wilkie\" Wilkerson (1903-1980) was a singer, vocal instructor, and founder of the Frederick Wilkerson Scholarship Foundation. He worked with and taught many well-known entertainers and artists including Maya Angelou, Roberta Flack, and Bernice Johnson Reagon.\n\nBorn in Texas in 1903, Wilkerson began performing at age thirteen, and trained at Brick's College in North Carolina. After singing in Europe under the stage name Gilbert Adams, Wilkerson became a vocal instructor at Howard University and Catholic University, both located in Washington, D.C.\n\nWilkerson taught private lessons in New York City and opened a studio in Washington D.C., where he began co-teaching with former student Joy McLean in 1962. He assembled his students in several choral groups including the Frederick Wilkerson Studio Choir and the Frederick Wilkerson Male Ensemble.\n\nIn 1967, he founded the Frederick Wilkerson Scholarship Foundation in Washington, D.C. to support students and artists in need of financial assistance. He served as the foundation's artistic director. Gaynelle Reed Lewis, the collection's donor, was president of the foundation. McLean chaired the foundation's Concert Committee.\n\nIn 1980, McLean took over Wilkerson's Washington, D.C. studio, after Wilkerson moved back to New York City. He died later that year. The circumstances of Wilkerson's death remain unknown."
