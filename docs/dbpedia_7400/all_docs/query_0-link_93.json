[Source: Carrell/Dungan, Heess, LMW]\n\n** Editor's Note: Research by Lyle Rockwell and Larry Pardoe calls into question the birth and death dates of Cloyd Sidney McCarty and the name of his wife Ethel's mother. Here are their observations:\n\nLarry Pardoe:\n\nAs to Cloyd's date of death, I believe there is an error in what is posted here as to the date of Cloyd's death. The posting shows he died 3 Jul 1988 when in fact the date should be June 4, 1965. (As related information, it was Cloyd's sister Edna (McCarty) Boecker who died July 3, 1988 - per Social Security Death Records). I have both the original edition of the \"Carrell/Dungan\" book as well as the second revision published in 2001 for reference as well.\n\nThe tombstone transcription in Bethel Cemetery, taken by Phil Herman, actually shows Cloyd McCarty, b. Aug 2 > 1884 d. June 4, 1965 (as does on an actual photo taken by Lyle Rockwell). These dates are in conflict with Carrell/Dungan, which shows b. 2 August 1893, d. 3 or 5 June 1965.\n\nThe Social Security Death Records show Cloyd McCarty, b. August 2, 1893, d. June 1965.\n\nSo digesting everything, we know that the 2 August 1884 birth date that is on tombstone can't be the right date. It probably should read b. 2 August 1893. The date of death as 4 June 1965 is probably correct vs. the 3 or 5 June 1965 date that Carrell/Dungan, vol II shows.\n\nOne other interesting note deals with Cloyd's brother, Floyd Stanley McCarty. The Bethel Cemetery site lists him on the same stone with parents William L. and Laura M. McCarty. It shows Floyd b. 1893, d. 1894. Carrell/Dungan shows Floyd, b. April 21, 1892, d. July 4, 1893. If Cloyd was b. August 2, 1893 then his younger brother Floyd couldn't have been born in the same year, 1893. The tombstone must be wrong on this date as well.\n\nLyle Rockwell:\n\nI agree with Lorin on the information summation above. I might also add that my source for the correct spelling of Elida Cole is from her tombstone. Here is what I have in my notes:\n\nSource: Personal visit by Lyle Rockwell to St Paul's Reformed Church Cemetery * on September 24, 1993 finds Ethel M. Carner's stone next to James M. Baker (1861 - 1948) and Elida R. Baker (1864 - 1956). Ethel's stone is also on north side and next to her husband, Lawrence Carner. Ethel is also listed on same stone as Lawrence. Therefore, the mother's name is Elida, not Lydia or something else.\n\n* Editor's Note: Now known as St. Paul's United Church of Christ Cemetery.\n\nLyle Rockwell\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF CLOYD SIDNEY McCARTY AND ETHEL MAY BAKER:\n\n9613421.
