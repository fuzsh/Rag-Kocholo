        "text": "Meet Dr. Grant Biehler\n\nWhen Dr. Biehler was young, he visited a chiropractor after experiencing a sports injury that left him struggling to move his neck. At just 15 years old, he knew that he didn’t want to make pain a part of his life.\n\nHe visited a chiropractor and after just one adjustment, was able to notice a big difference in how he was able to move his neck.\n\nFrom that point on, he was hooked and continued regular care. Ultimately, he decided that chiropractic was the perfect career for him.\n\nI don’t want my patients to have to worry about the daily pains of life. I focus on improving their function so that they can live and move easier.\n\nDr. Biehler attended Texas Tech in Lubbock, and then went on to obtain his Doctorate of Chiropractic from Parker College of Chiropractic in Dallas in 2010.\n\nOutside of the Practice\n\nWhen Dr. Biehler isn’t helping patients in the practice, you can find him spending time with his wife and daughter, tending to his vegetable garden and having family and friends over for a night of BBQ.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about Dr. Biehler and how he can help you, contact us today to book your first appointment. We can’t wait to welcome you into our care.\n\nDr. Grant Biehler | Doyle Chiropractic"
