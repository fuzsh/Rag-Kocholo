        "text": "Music by Gioachino Rossini\n\nLibretto by Cesare Sterbini, based on Pierre Beaumarchais’s French comedy The Barber of Seville\n\nAn opera in two acts sung in Italian\n\nFigaro, Figaro, FIIIIGAROOOOOO!\n\nWritten when he was just 24, Rossini’s delightful belcanto comedy The Barber of Seville is indisputably one of world’s most beloved operas. Packed with hummable tunes we all know, this new production brought to us by Victoria Newlyn and Matthew Kofi Waldren (who directed and conducted La Cenerentola in 2019 and L’elisir d’amore in 2022 at West Green to huge acclaim), is a witty tale of bribery, intrigue, disguise, and, of course, true love conquering all!\n\nThe wily barber Figaro, keen to take on any job as long as it is well paid (“Largo al factotum”), assists the love-struck Count Almaviva in prising the beautiful Rosina away from her scheming guardian, Dr Bartolo. All manner of shenanigans and twists and turns ensue in this immortal romantic comedy!\n\n“A contender for the most beautiful summer opera venue in the country just got more beautiful!”\n\n* musicOMH"
