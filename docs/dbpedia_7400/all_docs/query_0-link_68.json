        "text": "Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams rose to fame with the release of his third album, \"Cuts Like a Knife\" (1983). The album made him popular throughout the United States. However, it was his fourth album \"Reckless\" (1984), which is referred to as one of the best albums of the decade that made him an international superstar and gave him his first Grammy nomination. The album also sold four million copies at the time. In 1987, he released his fifth album \"Into the Fire\", a more social conscious album. The album yielded a top ten single \"Heat of the Night\", another Grammy nomination and another platinum album to his name.\n\nHowever, he released the album \"Waking Up the Neighbours\" (1991) which included the single \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\". The song sold more than three million copies in the United States, becoming the second best selling single, second only to \"We Are the World\". The song was also Adams' first Academy Award nomination and Golden Globe nomination as the song was written for the movie Robin Hood - König der Diebe (1991). \"Waking Up the Neighbours\" sold four million albums in the United States and garnered him six Grammy nominations (a record for a Canadian). He won one for best song written specifically for a motion picture or television (\"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\").\n\nIn 1993, Adams released a greatest hits album, titled \"So Far So Good\", which spawned a #1 single, \"Please Forgive Me\". That same year, he sang the single \"All for Love\" with Rod Stewart and Sting from the movie Die drei Musketiere (1993), which became a #1 single reaching across Europe and North America. He released the single \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" from the movie Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which became his fourth #1 single and his second Academy Award nomination. He became one of two non-American singers to have four number one hits and the most successful Canadian singer ever.\n\nIn 1996, Adams released the album \"18 Til I Die\", which has garnered him another two Grammy nominations. Later that year, he wrote and sang the single \"I Finally Found Someone\", a duet with Barbra Streisand for her movie, Liebe hat zwei Gesichter (1996). \"I Finally Found Someone\" became a top ten single and won Adams his third Academy Award nomination. He released three more albums since then, \"MTV Unplugged\" (1997), \"On a Day Like Today\" (1998) and most recently the songs for the DreamWorks animated movie Spirit - Der wilde Mustang (2002) in which Adams earned his second Golden Globe nomination for \"Best Song\".\n\nBryan Adams was awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia for his contributions to popular music and philanthropic work through his own foundation, which helps improve education for people around the world.\n\nScotty Bowman is a Canadian retired National Hockey League (NHL) head coach. He holds the record for most wins in league history, with 1,248 wins in the regular season and 223 in the Stanley Cup playoffs and ranks 2nd all time (behind Jean Béliveau's seventeen) for most Stanley Cup victories by a player, coach or executive with fourteen. He coached the St. Louis Blues, Montreal Canadiens, Buffalo Sabres, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Detroit Red Wings. He is the Senior Advisor of Hockey Operations for the Chicago Black Hawks. Bowman is regarded as one of the greatest coaches in NHL history.\n\nAs head coach, Bowman has won a record nine Stanley Cup championships; five with the Canadiens (1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979), one with the Penguins (1992) and three with the Red Wings (1997, 1998, and 2002). He has also won five Stanley Cups as a member of an organization's front office. He was director of player development for the 1991 Penguins, Consultant with the 2008 Red Wings, and Senior Advisor of Hockey Operations for the 2010, 2013, and 2015 Blackhawks. Bowman is the only NHL coach to lead three teams to Stanley Cup victories. Bowman won the Jack Adams Award in 1977 and 1996. In the 1976-77 season he won a record 60 games, breaking his own record of 58 wins the year before. He broke his own record again in the 1995-1996 season, with 62 wins. His 8 losses in 1976-77 are a modern record. His teams also made it to the Stanley Cup Finals a record 13 times and the semi-finals a record 16 times."
