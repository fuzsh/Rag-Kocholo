        "text": "CCM is delighted to announce that first-year artist diploma student Teresa Perrotta (MM Voice, ’19) reached the finals of the Lotte Lenya Competition, one of the most prestigious vocal competitions for young artists.\n\nA rising soprano, Perrotta won the Seybold-Russell Award at CCM’s 2019 Opera Scholarship Competition and advanced to the Upper Midwest Regional Auditions in this year’s Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. In December 2019, she made her international debut as Marie Antoinette in the French premiere of John Corigliano’s The Ghosts of Versailles at the Château de Versailles Royal Opera. She studies with CCM Voice Professor Gwendolyn Coleman.\n\nPerrotta is one of 12 finalists in the 2020 Lotte Lenya Competition. These finalists were selected out of 282 applicants from 24 states after a preliminary video round and a semi-finals round in New York City. The finals were initially scheduled for May 2 at the Eastman School of Music, but the Kurt Weill Foundation, which holds the competition, is exploring other options in light of the current global health crisis.\n\nCCM is often well-represented at the Lotte Lenya Competition. In 2017, Paulina Villarreal (DMA Voice, ‘18; MM Voice, ’15) won third prize, while Jasmin Habersham (AD Opera, ‘15; MM Voice, ‘13) and Lisa Marie Rogali (MM Voice, ’18) each received prizes of $3000. Talya Lieberman (AD Opera, ‘16) took Third Prize in the 2016 installment of this prestigious international theatre singing contest, while Lauren Roesner (BFA Musical Theatre, ‘13) won Third Prize in 2013 and alumna Caitlin Mathes (AD Opera, ’10, MM Voice, ‘09) won First Prize in 2011.\n\nAbout the Lotte Lenya Competition\n\nMore than a vocal competition, the Lotte Lenya Competition recognizes talented young singer/actors who are dramatically and musically convincing in repertoire ranging from opera/operetta to contemporary Broadway scores, with a focus on the works of Kurt Weill. Since its inception in 1998, the Lotte Lenya Competition has grown into an internationally recognized leader in identifying and nurturing the next generation of “total-package performers” (Opera News) and rising stars in both the opera and musical theater worlds. The roster of prizewinners has likewise grown to over 100, many of whom have gone on to major performing careers. Visit kwf.org for more information about the Kurt Weill Foundation or the Lotte Lenya Competition.\n\nStory by CCM Graduate Student Alexandra Doyle\n\nWe are thrilled to report that current CCM student Elena Villalón has been named a Grand Finals Winner of the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019 National Council Auditions! After a months-long series of auditions involving more than 1,000 singers at the district, regional and national levels, a panel of expert judges named Villalón and four other singers as the winners of the 65th annual Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. Each winner receives a $15,000 cash prize. You can learn more about all of the 2019 National Council Winners by visiting www.metopera.org/about/auditions/national-council-auditions/winners.\n\nA soprano from Austin, Texas, who studies with CCM Professor William McGraw, Villalón joins Houston Grand Opera’s studio artist program in the 2019-20 season, after being a finalist and winning the audience prize in the 31st annual Eleanor McCollum Competition. She has been a vocal fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center and at Houston Grand Opera’s Young Artist Vocal Academy. Her CCM performances include the roles of Adele in Strauss’ Die Fledermaus, Lucy in Menotti’s The Telephone and Miss Wordsworth in Britten’s Albert Herring.\n\nAs previously reported, fellow CCM-trained singers Joshua Wheeker, tenor (CCM Voice 2007-2012); Murrella Parton (MM Voice, 2017) also advanced to the Met’s National Council Semi-Finals this year.\n\nThis marks the second consecutive year that CCM singers have “won the Met,” as CCM alumna Jessica Faselt (MM Voice, 2016) was one of five singers who won the 2018 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. You can learn more about Faselt’s win courtesy of the Cincinnati Business Courier.\n\nCCM alumni and students frequently advance to the final rounds of the Met’s National Council Auditions, which is widely considered to be the nation’s most prestigious vocal competition. In 2017, four CCM alumni competed in the semi-finals, including Faselt; Summer Hassan, soprano (MM Voice, 2014); Andrew Manea, baritone (MM Voice, 2016); and Cody Quattlebaum, bass-baritone (BM Voice, 2015) — who was chosen as a finalist during that year’s national competition.\n\nAbout the Metropolitan Opera’s National Council Auditions\n\nFollowing the creation of the Met’s National Council in the 1952-53 season, the first Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions took place in 1954 in the Twin Cities. For over 60 years, the annual competition has helped launch the careers of countless young singers, including some of opera’s greatest stars. Every season, over 100 former participants in the National Council Auditions appear on the Met roster.\n\nThe district-level and regional auditions, held across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, are sponsored by the Metropolitan Opera National Council and administered by National Council members and hundreds of volunteers from across the country. Currently in its 65th year, the program has launched the careers of such well-known stars as Renée Fleming, Susan Graham, Frederica von Stade, Deborah Voigt, Lawrence Brownlee, Thomas Hampson, Eric Owens, Angela Meade, Nadine Sierra, Jamie Barton and Ryan Speedo Green. The competition garnered international attention with the release of the 2008 feature-length documentary The Audition, directed by award-winning filmmaker Susan Froemke, which chronicled the 2007 National Council Auditions season and Grand Finals Concert.\n\nCCM hosts acclaimed mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano for a master class featuring CCM students at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in CCM’s Mary Emery Hall, room 3250. The master class is free and open to the public. Cano visits CCM after she performs as a featured artist in the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra’s “One: City: Beethoven 9” concert on Nov. 9 and 10.\n\nA naturally gifted singer noted for her commanding stage presence and profound artistry, Cano has garnered critical acclaim in a variety of roles. During the 2018-19 season, she returns to the Metropolitan Opera as Emilia in Otello and Meg Page in Falstaff and makes her role debut as Offred in Poul Ruders’ The Handmaid’s Tale with Boston Lyric Opera. Cano’s orchestral engagements include Bernstein’s Jeremiah Symphony with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde with the Colorado Springs Philharmonic, and Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the Pittsburgh and Cincinnati symphonies. A dedicated recitalist and chamber musician, she joins tenor Matthew Polenzani and pianist Julius Drake at Carnegie Hall for an evening of Schubert, Beethoven, Brahms and Janáček’s The Diary of One Who Disappeared. She will return to Chamber Music of Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall for a performance of Ravel’s Sheherazade and Falla’s Psyche. Cano will also be part of two world-premiere performances this season: Paul Moravec’s A New Country and Gregg Kallor’s Sketches from Frankenstein Suite.\n\nCano has given over 100 performances at the Metropolitan Opera, with recent roles including Bersi, Emilia, Hansel, Meg Page, Mercedes, Nicklausse, Wellgunde and Waltraute. Other operatic appearances have included Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni with Boston Lyric and Arizona operas, the Sharp Eared Fox in Janáček’s Cunning Little Vixen with the Cleveland Orchestra, Carmen in Bizet’s Carmen with Boston Lyric Opera, Orphée in Orphée et Eurydice with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis and Des Moines Metro Opera, Diana in La Calisto with Cincinnati Opera and Marguerite in Berlioz’s La Damnation de Faust with the Tucson Symphony. She has recently worked with an impressive array of conductors, such as Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Franz Welser-Möst, Gustavo Dudamel, Manfred Honeck, Marin Alsop, Robert Spano, Louis Langrée, Osmo Vänskä and Sir Andrew Davis.\n\nCano is a native of St. Louis and made her professional operatic debut with Opera Theatre of St. Louis. She has earned degrees from Webster University and Rice University and was honored as a distinguished alumna and commencement speaker at Webster University last May. Cano joined the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program at the Metropolitan Opera after winning the Metropolitan Opera National Council Audition, and she made her Met debut during the 2009-10 season. Among her honors are a First Prize winner of the Young Concert Artist International Auditions, Sara Tucker Study Grant, Richard Tucker Career Grant and George London Award.\n\nLearn more about Cano on her professional website at jenniferjohnsoncano.net\n\n____________________\n\nMaster Class Time\n\n2 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 11\n\nLocation\n\nMary Emery Hall Room 3250, CCM Village\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati\n\nAdmission\n\nFree and open to the general public\n\nParking and Directions\n\nParking is available in the CCM Garage (located at the base of Corry Boulevard off Jefferson Avenue) and additional garages throughout the campus of the University of Cincinnati.

Werner Recital Hall. A reception in the Baur Room will follow. A video stream of the service will be available at ccm.uc.edu/resources/technology/barbaraclarkmemorial. A CCM alumna and a beloved member of our faculty from 2004-13, Clark passed away unexpectedly on Sept. 2, 2018.\n\nMost recently an Associate Professor of Voice and Chair of Voice at Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music, Clark began her teaching career at the Crane School of Music in Potsdam, New York. A highly-regarded teacher and artist, Clark taught a generation of students, many of whom are now performing in leading opera houses and festivals all over the world. Blessed with a lustrous, beautiful voice and a keen intelligence, she was also a sought-after soprano soloist who enjoyed a distinguished performing career. She will be remembered as a gifted teacher and mentor, a compassionate and generous friend known by all for both her good humor, and her kind and loving nature.\n\nA native of Ann Arbor, Michigan, Clark received a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Arizona and a master’s and doctorate from CCM. She was a treasured aunt and sister, and is survived by her sisters Susan Clark Joul and Jill Meiburg, and her brother Robert Clark. In addition, she is survived by her beloved niece Ivy Brooke Joul, and nephews Henry, Sebastian, and Maxwell Meiburg. She is also survived by brothers-in-law Thomas Meiburg and Kent Joul, in addition to her many current and former students.\n\nThe CCM community sends its deepest condolences to Clark’s family and friends. Her impact on her family, students and colleagues remains immeasurable.\n\nCCM highlights alumni guest artists who will return to campus for the Sesquicentennial Alumni Showcase in a series of alumni spotlight stories.\n\nAward-winning mezzo-soprano Helene Schneiderman (MM Voice, 1979; AD Opera, 1981) sings Rossini’s “Cruda sorte” from L’Italiana in Algeri in CCM’s Sesquicentennial Alumni Showcase this Saturday, April 21. She also closes the concert with fellow CCM alumna Tamara Wilson, soprano, in a performance of Strauss’ “Champagne Song” from Die Fledermaus with the CCM Philharmonia.\n\nSchneiderman was born in Flemington, New Jersey and began her studies at Westminster Choir College. After graduating from CCM, Schneiderman moved to Germany, where she joined the Heidelberg Opera Ensemble in 1982 and has been a member of the Staatstheater Stuttgart since 1984.\n\nIn addition to her work with Stuttgart, she has made guest performances with many major European and American opera companies, including Munich State Opera, Karlsruhe, Düsseldorf, Orlando and New York City Opera. From 1982 to 1987, she appeared regularly at the Heidelberg Schlossfestival and at the Rossini Festival in Pesaro in 1990. In 1998, Schneiderman was given the prestigious title of Kammersängerin from the City of Stuttgart, at the time she was the youngest singer ever to have been so honored. She made her debut at the Salzburg Festival as Zweite Dame in The Magic Flute conducted by Bernard Haitink. She has also worked with Leonard Bernstein, Dennis Russell Davies, Giuseppe Patané, Sir Georg Solti and Alberto Zedda.\n\nAs well as her operatic commitments, Schneiderman has developed a varied concert career and has appeared widely in oratorio and lieder recitals. Her most notable performance was at the 1989 Beethoven Festival in Bonn, Germany where she sang Arias and Barcarolles by Leonard Bernstein in the presence of the composer. She has also recorded the Eight Poems of Emily Dickinson by Aaron Copland on compact disc with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s under Dennis Russell Davies.\n\nIn 1990, Schneiderman appeared as Smeaton in Anna Bolena at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam and repeated her interpretation of the role at the Vienna Konzerthaus in 1994 alongside Edita Gruberová. For the 1994-95 season, she returned to the Concertgebouw to sing Queen Henrietta in I Puritani conducted by Jan Latham-Koenig. In Stuttgart she has had much success, most notably as Penelope in Monteverdi’s Il Ritorno D’ulisse in Patria, as Rosina in The Barber of Seville and the title role of Carmen. In the 1995-96 season, she made her debut at the Royal Opera House performing Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro, with a cast that included Cheryl Studer and Barbara Bonney, conducted by Bernard Haitink. She also sang Suzuki in Madama Butterfly for the New Israeli Opera Tel Aviv and made her role debut as Isabella in L’Italiana in Algieri in Stuttgart.\n\nIn the following seasons, Schneiderman returned to the Salzburg Festival, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden for Dorabella in Jonathan Miller’s acclaimed production of Così fan tutte. In Stuttgart she sang Meg Page in Johannes Schaaf’s new production of Falstaff, Bradamante in Jossi Wieler’s new production of George Frideric Handel’s Alcina, Ottavia in The Coronation of Poppea and a highly successful role debut with the title role of Giulio Cesare. She made her debut at the Opéra National de Paris in two runs of The Magic Flute. She also returned to the Royal Opera House for further performances of Dorabella in Così fan tutte conducted by Sir Colin Davis as well as to the Salzburg Festival for a highly acclaimed Marcellina in The Marriage of Figaro. She made successful debuts with Seattle Opera as Olga in Eugene Onegin and with San Francisco Opera, where she sang Bradamante in Alcina and returned for a much acclaimed Rosina in The Barber of Seville.\n\nIn 2008, she was honored with the Otto Hirschfeld Medal, and in 2010 she was awarded the Baden-Württemberg Order of Merit. Her repertory includes Annina (Der Rosenkavalier), Teresa (La sonnambula) and Ottavia (The Coronation of Poppea). She is also known for her performances of Jewish song.\n\nLearn more about the Sesquicentennial Alumni Showcase concert and view a complete list of guest artists at ccm.uc.edu/about/villagenews/save-the-date/sesquicentennial-alumni-showcase.\n\n____________________\n\nSESQUICENTENNIAL ALUMNI SHOWCASE CONCERT\n\nREPERTOIRE\n\nSTRAUSS: Overture to Die Fledermaus (1874); featuring the CCM Philharmonia led by Christopher Allen\n\nBEETHOVEN: Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-Flat Major, Op. 82 “Emperor” (1811); featuring Anton Nel, piano\n\nWALLER: Ain’t Misbehavin’; featuring Janelle Reichman, saxophone\n\nWARREN: There Will Never Be Another You; featuring Janelle Reichman, saxophone\n\nWAGNER: “Mild und leise,” from Tristan und Isolde (1859); featuring Tamara Wilson, soprano\n\n-Intermission-\n\nROSSINI: “Cruda sorte,” from L’Italiana in Algeri (1813); featuring Helene Schneiderman, mezzo-soprano\n\nSCHUMANN: Konzertstück for Four Horns, Op. 86 (1849); featuring Allene Hackleman, Julie Beckel Yager, Nathaniel Willson, Jennifer Paul, soloists\n\nBROWN: “A Summer in Ohio,” from The Last Five Years; featuring Betsy Wolfe, vocalist, with Roger Grodsky, conductor\n\nBAREILLES: “She Used to Be Mine,” from Waitress; featuring Betsy Wolfe, vocalist, with Roger Grodsky, conductor\n\nSCHWARTZ: “Meadowlark,” from The Baker’s Wife; featuring Betsy Wolfe, vocalist, with Roger Grodsky, conductor\n\nSAINT-SAENS: Violin Concerto No. 3 in B Minor, Op. 61; featuring Yang Liu, violin\n\nSTRAUSS: Champagne Song from Die Fledermaus; featuring Tamara Wilson, soprano, and Helene Schneiderman, mezzo-soprano\n\nPERFORMANCE TIME\n\n8 p.m. Saturday, April 21\n\nPlease note: UC’s Nippert Stadium will also host an FC Cincinnati game at 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 21, 2018.

She praises McGraw for “his complete knowledge of the voice, the way he nurtures young artists and his kind heart.”\n\n“He knows how to push his students toward success and gives us the tools we need, but never allows us to be too hard on ourselves,” Sheppard adds.\n\nSheppard says she has dealt with anxiety and depression for most of her life but that music has been a source of therapy for her. She studies voice and international human rights, and hopes to combine the two disciplines in her work. She currently works with children with disabilities and uses music to teach them life skills.\n\n“I have always believed that as artists and musicians, it is our duty to use our unique medium for good,” Sheppard says. “As a singer, we carry grand responsibility. We posses a public voice. I really want to be a voice for minorities and those who have faced extreme hardships around the world. I plan to combine activism work with recitals.”\n\nAt the Kennedy Center concert, she plans to sing a song cycle titled Love After 1950 by Libby Larsen. It features collected poetry written by women. Sheppard will also work with Larsen this summer as a Colburn Fellow at SongFest in Los Angeles.\n\n“Art is an outlet for many,” Sheppard says. “It is crucial that we become more accepting of those with mental illness, and come together as collaborators, not as competitors. I have many friends who suffer from very similar mental disorders. I encourage them to apply for this same award and to be a strong voice for those with all types of anxiety and depression.”\n\nVisit the Kennedy Center’s Facebook page or website to watch Sheppard’s performance at 6 p.m. on Thursday, May 25.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that three current and former CCM students won awards as finalists in the 2017 Lotte Lenya Competition.
