        "text": "Caroline Foulkes is a young opera singer and a graduate from Trinity Laban. Caroline recently joined Blackheath Halls as its part time administrator and helped at our Stone House event on Tuesday 11th June. This is her report of the evening.\n\nA Verdi evening at Stone House\n\nTuesday 11th June 2013\n\nMiriam Murphy – Soprano\n\nGrant Doyle – Baritone\n\nMatthew Rose – Bass\n\nJeremy Silver- Piano\n\nRoss Alley – Lecturer\n\nProgramme:\n\nVieni! t’affretta! – Macbeth\n\nPace, pace – La Forza del Destino\n\nEri tu – Un Ballo in Maschera\n\nRigoletto and Sparafucile duet – Rigoletto\n\nKing Phillip’s aria – Don Carlo\n\nConfutatis maledictus – Requiem\n\nStone House in Lewisham provided the perfect setting for this hugely enjoyable Verdi evening. Generously hosted by Jonathan and Yvonne Horsfall Turner, guests were delighted to explore the beautifully restored late 18th century villa and gardens.\n\nExquisite Italianate canapés circulated as our guests admired the murals of the Naval College and Queen’s House in the dining room. The first floor music room comprises of a central circular space flanked by two squares which provided the perfect performing space for the singers and an intimate setting for the audience.\n\nRoss Alley, currently Guest Lecturer at the Royal Opera House, presented the programme with informative and entertaining insights as we were swept along on a tour-de-force through Verdi’s life and the socio-political context of his writing. Miriam Murphy sang first with Lady Macbeth’s first aria ‘Vieni! t’affretta!’ – a thrilling performance from Miriam who will sing the role in Blackheath Halls Community Opera. The dramatic soprano who has performed Wagner with Opera North and WNO left us in no doubt of Lady Macbeth’s power and ambition from the opening spoken dialogue through to the soaring final cadenza. ‘Pace, pace’ with its perfectly executed high pianissimi provided a great contrast to her Lady Macbeth as Leonora prays she may find peace in death.\n\nRoss took us a little further along our journey before we heard from Grant Doyle, known to many in the audience after his performance at the Halls in Cendrillon last year. Grant sang an impassioned ‘Eri tu’ and was then joined by Matthew Rose for the Rigoletto duet. The dramatic and vocal energy from Matthew and Grant was so exciting to experience from being in such close proximity to them. Grant and Matthew have been involved with Blackheath Halls Community Opera for many years and are both of Ambassadors of the opera. Jeremy Silver, who played fantastically throughout the evening, played a gentle ‘Va, pensiero’ while Ross talked about Italian nationalism which prompted a rather impressive humming chorus from singers and audience alike. After Grant’s beautifully moving aria from Don Carlo, Matthew performed the fantastically powerful solo from Verdi’s Requiem. Matthew is well known to the audience from his performance in Britten’s Noye’s Fludde at Blackheath Halls and for hosting our Opera Gala Night and we are delighted that he will make his debut in our Community Opera, singing the role of Banquo.\n\nWe are most grateful to Jonathan and Yvonne Horsfall Turner and to Matthew Rose, who made this evening possible. Jonathan and Yvonne were very generous in making Stone House available to us, providing us with wine and delicious canapés made by Yvonne. Matthew organised the musical programme and performers for the evening. Thank you Jonathan, Yvonne and Matthew for giving us all a wonderful and memorable evening!\n\n<"
