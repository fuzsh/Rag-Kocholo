        "text": "The Doll in Brisbane\n\nFrom Barbies and Bratz to Cabbage Patch Kids, there’s something vaguely creepy about many of our favourite dolls. Popular Brisbane theatre group Babushka takes a look at the world through a doll’s eyes for their new comedy cabaret show The Doll, featuring an array of original songs blending opera, 80s pop, nursery rhymes and rock’n’roll.\n\nThe Doll, Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts, Fortitude Valley, 20 to 23 May\n\nRyan Trecartin: Re’Search Wait’S\n\nA leading artistic voice of the post-internet age, multimedia artist Ryan Trecartin will have his first major Australian solo show at Melbourne’s NGV. The toast of the 2013 Venice biennale and fresh from curating this year’s New York’s New Museum triennial, the artist will show Re’Search Wait’S, a visual essay of four films exploring consumerism, identity, excess and narcissism, informed by reality television shows, MTV, personal webcams, and karaoke. Sure to get everyone vlogging.\n\nRyan Trecartin: Re’Search Wait’S, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, 15 May to 13 September\n\nRhymes with Silence in Sydney\n\nDomestic violence is on a terrifying upward spiral in Australia, with commentators calling it a national crisis. Sydney theatre collective Improvising Change looks at some of the stories behind the statistics with an evening of 13 new short plays, written by nine Australian writers, that connect on theme. Required viewing.\n\nRhymes with Silence, 107 Projects, Redfern Sydney, 16 to 24 May\n\nHozier on tour\n\nHe was a big name at this year’s Bluesfest; now Hozier returns for a new round of national dates. His infinitely hummable Take Me To Church scored him a Grammy nomination, legions of fans and a David LaChapelle-directed viral video featuring dancer Sergei Polunin, but rave reviews for his show promise the bluesman is unlikely to be a one-hit wonder.\n\nHozier, Belvoir Amphitheatre Perth on 28 October, then Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane\n\nDon Giovanni in Adelaide\n\nDon Juan spends his days seducing unsuspecting women, but his wickedness will eventually catch up with him. The legendary cad lives again in a new production of Mozart’s Don Giovanni for the State Opera of South Australia. Adelaide‐born baritone Grant Doyle returns home to sing the lead role, and will be accompanied by a host of local and international talent."
