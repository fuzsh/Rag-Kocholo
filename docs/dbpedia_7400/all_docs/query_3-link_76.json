        "text": "Composer\n\nMarcus DeLoachâs multi-faceted international career as a soloist in opera, musical theater, and popular music inspires a dramatically expressive compositional style that finds its roots in a fusion of the classical tradition and contemporary musical theater vocal idioms.\n\nHis first opera, Mooch the Messy, based on the book by acclaimed childrenâs author Marjorie Weinman Sharmat, was premiered at the Greenwood Music Festival, SC in 2010, with Metropolitan Opera tenor Keith Jameson in the title role. The opera has been subsequently produced by the Boston Conservatory and Tulsa Opera âOpera on Tourâ outreach program, where it played to over 30,000 school children.\n\nIn 2016, DeLoach was commissioned by Music Director Elizabeth Braden to write âLook Up Into the Heavens,â an anthem for choir and organ, for the Chancel Choir of Wallingford Presbyterian Church of Wallingford, PA. The group subsequently commissioned him to write another anthem âThe Lord is My Shepherdâ in 2019, which was featured in Opera Philadelphiaâs 2021 Digital Channel original film Organ Stops. His first sacred choral work, an a cappella anthem âThe Prayer of St. Francisâ, was commissioned in 2013 by the Director of Music Ministries Steve Newberry for the St. Johnâs Chorale of The Church of St. John the Divine, Houston, TX.\n\nWhile a student at Rice University, DeLoach wrote and produced Three Capstan Shanties, folk- song arrangements for three solo voices and harmonium. Additionally, in cooperation with The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music, DeLoach wrote new chamber orchestra arrangements for baritone of four of the composerâs most popular songs âMack the Knife,â âSeptember Song,â âTchaikowsky,â and âJohnnyâs Song.â\n\nIn 2016, DeLoach completed a song cycle Four Robinson Songs for baritone and piano and based on the poetry of Weldon Kees, which was premiered by baritone Keith Phares in 2022. His other classical songs include settings of the poetry of Derek Walcott, E. E. Cummings, Robert Bly, and James de Priest.\n\nAs part of a 2021 Vice Provost for the Arts grant from Temple University, he completed Five Poems of Robert Bly and \"Billy in the Darbies\" which were premiered in Philadelphia in 2022 by baritone Andrew Garland. Also, in 2022 were premieres of Images for tenor and string quartet, written for Hayden Smith and based on poetry of William Cullen Bryant, and Three Last Songs (\"Leith Hill,\" \"A Perfectly Practical Ender,\" and \"It's Still a Wonderful World\"), cabaret-style settings for which he wrote the music and lyrics.\n\nOther operatic projects have included authoring the libretto for Jeff Graceâs one-act opera The Train Ride for American Opera Projects and serving as stage director for the world premiere of Mark Volkerâs opera The Legend of Sleepy Hollow for the Young Opera Company of New England.\n\nDeLoach holds a B.M. and M.M. in Voice Performance from The Juilliard School and a D.M.A. from Rice Universityâs Shepherd School of Music where he studied composition with Dr. Karim Al-Zand. Current compositional projects include another song set of Robert Bly texts, a new arrangement of his setting of \"The Lord is my Shepherd\" for choir, piano, and violin, and an original opera.\n\nCurrent for 2023\n\nSchedule\n\nPerformances in the 2022/23 Season\n\nCONCERT\n\nTEMPLE UNIVERSITY\n\nOct. 15, 2022\n\nthe road goes on ahead: the music of Marcus DeLoach - an evening of Marcus' own original vocal compositions performed by w.
