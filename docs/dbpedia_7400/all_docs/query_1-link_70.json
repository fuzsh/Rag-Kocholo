        "text": "The Albertus Magnus College mourns the loss of William (Bill) J. Doyle, a dedicated Trustee and member of the Executive Committee of the Albertus Board of Trustees for 20 years. He died April 18, succumbing to the Coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\n“Bill provided vision and wisdom in promoting the mission of Albertus. He was a fighter for causes he believed in even until the very end. Our hearts and prayers go out to Bill’s entire family and his friends and colleagues who all loved him deeply. Bill, better than most, loved this place and understood the amazing resilience of this College. His dedication and commitment to Albertus Magnus were clear and will carry us forward with his memory in mind,” said Albertus President Dr. Marc M. Camille.\n\nBorn in Boston in 1936, Doyle was the second of five children of the late Ellen of William I. Doyle, who were natives of Ireland. Doyle, himself a lover of “all things Irish,” grew up in Meriden.\n\nDoyle’s accomplishments were numerous, especially as an attorney. He was the former head of the litigation practice of Wiggin and Dana and the principal trial lawyer for Yale University for more than 25 years. In addition to his legal accomplishments and service to the Albertus Community, Doyle was President of the Board of the New Haven Public Library, a board member of the Children’s Center in Hamden, and President of the Board of the New Haven Lawn Club.\n\nDue to the current worldwide pandemic, funeral services will be held at a later date. Sisk Brothers Funeral Home in Hamden is in charge of arrangements."
