        "text": "Peter George Doyle's importance in the emotional life of Walt Whitman is well established. The romantic friendship that sprang up in 1865 between the streetcar conductor and the poet spanned the years of Whitman's residence in Washington, D.C, and continued nearly up through Whitman's death in Camden, in 1892. Yet despite the prominent role that Doyle played in Whitman's life, our knowledge of his personal history is incomplete. The following biography fills in some of the missing pieces about this enigmatic figure.1 In so doing, it hopes to give voice to the man John Burroughs hailed as \"a mute inglorious Whitman.\"2\n\nNotes\n\n1. I dedicate this article to Mary McLaughlin, great-niece of Peter George Doyle, whose desire to learn more about her great-uncle inspired me to write this short biography. I am indebted to Mrs. McLaughlin, and also to John Fragale, Craig Howell, Morgan McDonald, Kenneth Plonsky, Peter Scott, Sherwood Smith, and Kurt Vorndran, for reviewing the manuscript and providing me with many helpful suggestions for improvement.

O'Mahony was unable to find a baptismal record for Francis Michael, a circumstance that O'Mahony says is not unusual. Doyle claimed Francis as his brother. Francis' birth date was obtained from his widow's pension application.

From September through October 1863, the company muster rolls for the 38th Battalion include the name of George Doyle, with the notation that he is \"Absent sick since March 18, 1863, Petersburg, Va.\" The rolls also indicate that Doyle was last paid on November 7, 1862 (the date of his discharge). After October 1863, Doyle is no longer listed on extant company muster rolls. [There are no extant company muster rolls for the periods August 1862 through July 1863, and December 1863 through June 1864 (Moore, 142).] (Back)\n\n30. For this quote, I have relied on Horace Traubel's handwritten notes of the Doyle interview in the Feinberg Collection (Container 45), Library of Congress. The published account in Bucke does not mention Doyle's imprisonment. I am grateful to Dr. Alice Birney of the Library of Congress, for making me aware of the Traubel manuscript, and alerting me to the fact that the manuscript and the published transcript of the Doyle interview differ in significant respects. (Back)\n\n31. The description of Doyle's confinement is based on my review of records in the \"Turner-Baker papers,\" National Archives and Records Admnistration, Record Group 94, Records of the Adjutant General's Office. The record does not provide a physical description of Doyle. One possibility is that this is Peter Doyle, Sr. However, there is no indication that the senior Doyle ever came to Washington, D.C. Mary McLaughlin (Peter Doyle's great niece) recalled that her grandmother (Doyle's sister Margaret) told Mary that Margaret lived in Alexandria, Virginia, immediately before moving to Washington, D.C. The first record of Margaret Doyle in Washington is contained in the 1870 Population Census (National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group Number 29), which lists her as living with her widowed mother, Catherine, and her brothers, Peter and Edward. (Back)\n\n32. The Old Capitol, situated where the Supreme Court building is today, was so named because it served as the meeting place for Congress for several years, after the British had burned the Capitol building during the War of 1812. Carroll Prison occupied a row of decrepit wooden structures fronting the Capitol between East Capitol and A Streets, SE, and received its name from the old Carroll family mansion that had been located nearby. (See Curtis Carroll Davis, \"The `Old Capitol' and Its Keeper, How William P. Wood Ran a Civil War Prison,\" in J. Kirkpatrick Flack, ed., Records of the Columbia Historical Society of Washington, D.C. (Charlottesville: The University Press of Virginia, 1989), 207. (Back)\n\n33. National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group Number 71, Records of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. The payroll record does not provide any identifying information other than name, and occupation. The 1864 D.C. directory lists only one Peter Doyle, who is listed as a laborer residing at 62 M Street South, the same address as Francis Doyle and James Doyle. (Back)\n\n34. Frank E. Vandiver, Jubal's Raid: General Early's Famous Attack on Washington in 1864 (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., 1960), 144. (Back)\n\n35. A physical description of Doyle is found in the Rendezvous Report for the Princeton, March 2, 1865 (National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group Number 24, Records of the Bureau of Ships). Francis Doyle enlisted under his middle name, Michael. Details of Doyle's naval career, given below, were also obtained from this record. (Back)\n\n36. National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group Number 15, Records of the Veterans Administration. See Pension Record for Francis M. Doyle, Private, Captain Clarke's Company, 7th Battalion, D.C. Military Infantry, 1861. The birth dates for Francis Doyle's children were also obtained from this record. (Back)\n\n37. The 1860 Population Census for the District of Columbia (National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 29) lists Francis M. Doyle as a blacksmith at the Navy Yard. I examined the Washington Navy Yard civilian payroll records for the period January 1859 through March 1867 (National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 71). Francis Doyle is listed as a blacksmith from January 1859 through September 1862. He is not listed thereafter. I am grateful to Ms. Rebecca Livingston of the Archives for her help in obtaining these records. (Back)\n\n38. National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group Number 94. See Compiled Military Service Record for Francis M. Doyle, Private, Captain Clarke's Company, 7th Battalion, D.C. Military Infantry, April 24, 1861 through July 24, 1861. (Back)\n\n39. In some years, Peter George's name is inverted. This also occurred with frequency for Francis Michael. Both Peter and Francis used their middle names as their first names when they enrolled in the military. It is not unusual for a man to use a nickname or a middle name in place of the sissified \"Francis.\" In Peter's case, the family to distinguish him from his father may have called him George. (Back)\n\n40. The information on James Doyle's marriage and the names and ages of his wife and children, were derived from the 1870 Population Census for the District of Columbia (National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group Number 29). (Back)\n\n41. A Peter Doyle, age 66, Irish native, died in Manhattan, on August 4, 1865, of \"Debility.\" He was buried in Calvary Cemetery. See Vital Records, New York City Department of Records and Information Services, Municipal Archives, New York, New York. (Back)\n\n42. See the 1870 Population Census for the District of Columbia. Catherine Doyle was living with her son Pete as early as the summer of 1869, according to a reference made by Whitman in a letter to Doyle. See Walt Whitman, The Correspondence, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York University Press) 2: 84. The Washington, D.C. directory lists Edward for the first time in 1869. (Back)\n\n43. Nash's birth date is inscribed on his gravestone in Congressional Cemetery, Washington, DC. Nash's obituary in The Washington Evening Star of October 15, 1883, provided a description of his early life in the District. (Back)\n\n44. Ann M. Nash's birth date is inscribed on her gravestone in Congressional Cemetery. Her obituary in Washington, D.C.'s Evening Star on March 27, 1891, states that she was the daughter of Robert and Jane Clarke. (Back)\n\n45. See Michael Nash's \"Last Will and Testament\" filed on October 24, 1883 in the Office of the Register of Deeds for the District of Columbia, D.C. Archives. (Back)\n\n46. Sarah Booth Conroy, \"Chronicles: Washington's Living Archive,\" The Washington Post, August 30, 1993. (Back)\n\n47. The records of the Association of the Oldest Inhabitants are in the library of The Historical Society of Washington, D.C. (formerly the Columbia Historical Society). (Back)\n\n48. Doyle worked a minimum of 21 days per month, and a maximum of 25 days per month during the period December 1863 through January 1865. In February 1865, the number of days worked dropped to 19, then in April to 18, and in June to 10 days (March and May 1865 records were not legible). After June 1865, Peter Doyle is no longer listed on the Navy Yard payroll. (Back)\n\n49. E.D.

(Back)\n\n53. Mary Catherine was the daughter of Peter Doyle's sister, Margaret. Her daughter, Mary, told me that her mother had made this reference to Uncle Pete when Mary became acquainted with Whitman's work as a student at Barnard College in the 1930's. (Back)\n\n54. Charley Shively, Calamus Lovers: Walt Whitman's Working Class Camerados (San Francisco: Gay Sunshine Press, 1987), 38. (Back)\n\n55. For a biographical sketch of Vaughan, I have relied on Shively, and on the 1880 Population Census for a Frederick Vaughan of Brooklyn, New York. The Census lists Vaughan, 43 years old, an engineer, birthplace Canada, as living at 341 Lexington Avenue, with his wife, Frank, 35, a homemaker, and their children, Frederick B., 17, an office clerk, Frank C., 15, an office clerk, Harry C., 11, a student, and Mabel L., 1 year old. The name of the oldest boy, and the ages of the three boys, correspond approximately to the ages given by Vaughan for his children in a November 1874, letter to Whitman (Shively, 50). In that letter, Vaughan also mentioned a fourth son. This boy probably died in his youth; he is not listed in the 1880 Census. The 1900 Census for Schenectady, New York lists what I assume to be the family of Fred's son, Frederick. He lived with his wife, Mary, and daughter, Maybelle, and his widowed mother, Frances. The 1900 Census also reported that Fred, Jr., was born in January 1863, and that his mother was born in January 1846. The 1900 Census further noted that Frances had given birth to five children, of whom only three were still living at the time of the Census. (Back)\n\n56. Edward \"Ned\" Stewart testified to Doyle's fondness for limericks in a February 25, 1870, letter to Whitman (Shively, 111). (Back)\n\n57.

Blodgett, Arthur Golden, and William White (New York: New York University Press, 1980), 2: 488. (Back)\n\n59. Whitman used the personal name, \"Jonathan,\" in A Boston Ballad, first published in the 1855 edition. The name was not meant to represent a fictional hero as in \"Come Up From the Fields Father\". Rather, as Jerome Loving has noted, Jonathan was a \"term used to denote the average American in the nineteenth century\" (see Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass, edited by Jerome Loving (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 469).

Bucke does not identify the newspaperman. (Back)\n\n67. Ed Folsom, \"1868 Photograph of Peter Doyle,\" Walt Whitman Quarterly Review, 4 (Spring 1987), 38 and back cover. (Back)\n\n68. Whitman and Doyle corresponded with each other over a twenty-year period. Although many of Whitman's letters have survived, only nine of Doyle's letters are extant (Shively, 104–114). Of the nine, seven were written in the summer and fall of 1868, one was written in November 1875 and one in January 1878. (Back)\n\n69. Daily Morning Chronicle, September 10, 1869, Washington, D.C. Like Burroughs in his tribute to Doyle as a \"mute, inglorious Whitman,\" the copywriter of this advertisement also borrowed heavily from Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.\" (Back)\n\n70. See the September 28, 1904, letter from Henry Bryan Binns to Edward Carpenter, in the Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress. (Back)\n\n71. I have dated this outing by cross-referencing Whitman's known visits to his mother in her Portland Avenue home (from the Correspondence), with New York performances of the opera Poliuto, as reported in George Odell, Annals of the New York Stage, (New York: AMS Press, 1970). (Back)\n\n72. Traubel's manuscript of this interview quotes Doyle as saying, \"I stayed in Jersey City.\" (Back)\n\n73. Robert D.

The manuscript of Bucke's draft of the biography with Whitman's markings is in the collection of the Duke University Library. Apparently, Bucke planned to mention Whitman's friendship with Doyle by excerpting John Burroughs' description of the two on the Washington streetcars that I cited above. This section, however, is marked through for deletion (presumably by Whitman) in draft page 60, and was not printed. (Back)\n\n83.
