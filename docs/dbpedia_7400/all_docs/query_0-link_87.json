        "text": "In April this year, Graham Ross directed the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge in a performance of Monteverdi's Vespers of 1610 at Smith Square Hall (formerly St John's Smith Square). The performance featured the English Cornett & Sackbutt Ensemble, plus Margaret Faultless, violin, Jonathan Manson, bass violin, William Hunt, violone, Elizabeth Kenny, theorbo and Silas Wollston, organ, alongside instrumentalists from Cambridge University. Nicholas Mulroy did the heavy lifting as soloist alongside other soloists from the choir.\n\nThe result was filmed, beautifully, by Andrew Staples for Studio 2359, with recorded sound by John Rutter. The film has now been released and is available the Choir of Clare College's YouTube channel. The results are nothing less than astonishing and extremely engaging. Despite using a college choir, this is a relatively intimate performance and I have great admiration for the way a series of soloists step out from the choir and perform all those solos with terrific aplomb.\n\nI could listen to Nicholas Mulroy for ever in this style of music and his performance remains a treasure. But credit music go to the women who do all those concertos, going way beyond the technical and giving each appearance real character. Then there are the two baritone soloists in the Magnificat going high into the upper reaches with real aplomb. But I think the palm must go to a series of tenors, especially those who duet with Nicholas Mulroy, so that for instance in Duo Seraphim the second and third tenors match Mulroy ornament for ornament.\n\nThe full performances is available on YouTube. As it is free of charge, please do consider making a donation to the college's music if you are enjoying the performance.\n\nDvorák: Cello Concerto - Anastasia Kobekina, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, Jakub Hruša - BBC Proms (Photo: BBC/Andy Paradise )\n\nDvořák: Cello Concerto, Suk: Asrael Symphony; Anastasia Kobekina, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra; Jakub Hrůša; BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall\n\nReviewed 27 August 2024\n\nThe Czech orchestra impresses with its superb accompaniment to Kobekina's idiomatic approach to the concerto, and then Suk's huge symphony receives a superb performance, completely consumate and deeply felt\n\nThe Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and its principal guest conductor, Jakub Hrůša, have been on a tour of European Summer festivals with stops at Elbphilharmonie Sommer in Hamburg, the Lucerne Festival and Wiesbaden's Rheingau Musik Festival with a final stop at the BBC Proms with two concerts. For their first concert, on Tuedsay 27 August 2024 at the Royal Albert Hall, Jakub Hrůša conducted the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in Dvořák’s Cello Concerto, with soloist Anastasia Kobekina, and Josef Suk's Asrael Symphony.\n\nSuk's masterwork was making only its second appearance at the BBC Proms. Czech Philharmonic and Hrůša have recorded Asrael for a Suk cycle they are currently preparing for Pentatone, whilst Hrůša conducted the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra (of which he is chief conductor) in Suk's Asrael Symphony at the Edinburgh International Festival earlier this month.\n\nDvorák: Cello Concerto - Anastasia Kobekina, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, Jakub Hruša - BBC Proms (Photo: BBC/Andy Paradise )\n\nDvořák’s Cello Concerto was written for his friend cellist Hanuš Wihan in 1894 whilst Dvořák was working in New York at the National Conservatory for Music, and one of the more unlikely impetuses for the work is that whilst in New York, Dvořák heard the premiere Cello Concerto No. 2 by composer and cellist Victor Herbert, one of the teachers at the conservatory. Herbert's use of a cello in a concerto was unusual at the time but the writing convinced Dvořák. Another inspiration is that whilst writing it, he learned that his sister-in-law was dying and she was the woman that Dvořák had originally been in love with!\n\nArthur Bliss: Works for Brass Band; Black Dyke Band, John Wilson; Chandos\n\nMalcolm Arnold: Music for Brass Band; Foden's Band, Choir of Chetham's School of Music, Michael Fowles; Beckus\n\nReviewed 24 August 2024\n\nTwo discs focussing on 20th century composers whose works for brass band are performed alongside arrangements to create two brilliant and highly satisfying portraits\n\nBrass bands emerged in the UK in the mid-19th century as a popular pastime, the result of a combination of circumstances, industrialisation, which produced a large working class population, technological advances in instrument design, and the mass production to manufacture and distribute the instruments. It can be argued that bands were an expression of solidarity by growing communities, but the association of brass bands with industrial concerns often arose because they were seen as a way to keep workers from organising in radical groups. The first British open brass band championships took place in Manchester in 1853, and competition remains a strong feature of brass banding. Moving into the 20th-century, the movement developed sufficient confidence that well-known, non-specialist, composers would be approached for pieces, particularly for competitions.\n\nTwo recent discs illuminate the way 20th century British composers have interacted with brass bands.\n\nOn Chandos, John Wilson conducts the Black Dyke Band in music by Sir Arthur Bliss, his two brass band works, Kenilworth and The Belmont Variations, along with arrangements of music from Adam Zero, Checkmate, and Things to Come. The Black Dyke Band traces its history continuously from 1855 when it formed as the band of the Black Dyke Mills in Queensbury, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, a company owned by John Foster.\n\nOn the Malcolm Arnold Society's Beckus label, Michael Fowles conducts Foden's Band in music by Malcolm Arnold, his brass band works, Fantasy for Brass Band, Song of Freedom, and Litte Suites Nos. 1 & 2, plus arrangements of his Peterloo: Overture, suite from Sweeney Todd, The Roots of Heaven: Overture and March: Overseas. Foden's Band traces its origins back to 1900 when the village of Elworth, near Sandbach in Cheshire, formed its own band, and from that base local industrialist Edwin Foden formed the Fodens Motor Works Band.\n\nThe world’s largest festival of Indian classical music (outside India) returns to the Barbican Centre from 24 to 27 October 2024 when Darbar Festival presents the finest international and UK Indian classical musicians with a mix of emerging talent, master performers making their UK debut, and a medley of world class legends.\n\nLaunched 19 years ago in memory of Gurmit Singh Ji Virdee, an inspirational tabla player, teacher and the father of artistic director Sandeep Virdee, the 2024 programme includes concerts, workshops, talks, free family events and a pop-up market. Sandeep Virdee said: \"Indian classical music is often misunderstood as an obscure artform that distances the audience. Far from it. With a vast repertoire of music styles and subgenres depending on your emotional state, it has the power to stir, thrill and inspire the soul. We are delighted to showcase the world’s finest proponents of this magical artform and welcome audiences from richly diverse backgrounds near and far.\"\n\nPerformers include India’s finest tabla legend, Pandit Anindo Chatterjee with his son and fellow tabla player, Anubrata Chatterjee, India’s foremost female vocalist, Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, sitar player Pandit Kushal Das, violinist, composer and conductor, Dr L Subramaniam, makes his Darbar Festival debut with his son Ambi Subramaniam, to champion contemporary Carnatic percussion, sarod instrumentalist Amaan Ali Bangash who makes his UK solo debut accompanied by Anubrata Chatterjee on tabla, and Carnatic vocalist, Aruna Sairam.\n\nJayanthi Kumaresh, a virtuoso of the Saraswati veena, hosts Veena Unwrapped a lecture demonstration that shares her expertise, insights and passion for the veena. Dr L Subramaniam's lecture East West Composition Unwrapped explores his approach to composition.\n\nFull details from the Darbar Festival website.\n\nEugène Delacroix: Liberty Leading the People - painted to commemorate the 1830, July Revolution\n\nBerlioz' Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale was written in 1840 to be performed by a huge military band as part of commemorations for marking the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution of 1830 which had brought Louis-Philippe I to power. The celebrations involved erecting the July Column in the Place de la Bastille and the symphony's first movement was performed during the march to the Bastille, the central movement during the ceremony and the third on the return march. The work was such a success at the dress rehearsal that it was performed twice more in August and became one of the composer's most popular works during his lifetime.\n\nIt was originally written for a military band of around 200 players, but in 1842 Berlioz revised it, adding option string parts and a chorus at the end. Richard Wagner attended a performance of this new version at the Salle Vivienne on 1 February 1842. On 5 February, he told Robert Schumann that he found passages in the last movement of Berlioz's symphony so \"magnificent and sublime that they can never be surpassed.\"\n\nThe work only gets very occasional outings. It has been twice at the BBC Proms, in 2009, Thierry Fisher conducted the military band version with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and back in 1983, Sir John Pritchard conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the revised version with strings and choir to open the BBC Proms that year.\n\nNow, the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire (RBC) is launching a season of French music with a performance of Berlioz' Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale on 25 October 2024. Michael Seal conducts the RBC Symphony Orchestra at the Bradshaw Hall, performing a new orchestration of Berlioz' work.\n\nRBC's focus on French music include a week of salon-style concerts devoted to Fauré and his contemporaries, the first known performance of a work by the black composer, violinist and conductor Chevalier de Saint-Georges, Poulenc’s opera La voix humaine, a 150th anniversary all-Ravel recital on RBC’s 1890 Érard piano, and a centenary tribute to Boulez with his dazzling Sur incises.\n\nFull details from the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire's website.\n\nBohuslav Martinů: The Greek Passion - Den Jyske Opera\n\nBohuslav Martinů's opera, The Greek Passion, is one of those complex works that continue to resonate, even though actual performances are still relatively rare. Whilst the work is technically about a village's preparations for Easter, central to the action is how the villagers deal with a group of refugees, subject that remains alarmingly topical.\n\nJutland Opera (Den Jske Opera), Denmark's touring opera company based in the country's second city, Aarhus, opens a new production of Martinů's The Greek Passion tonight, 23 August 2024. The production is a co-production with Theater Osnabrück where the production debuted in 2022. Directed by Philipp Kochheim and conducted by Andreas Holz, The Greek Passion features Rhys Jenkins, James Edgar Knight, Michael Ha, Amira Elmadfa, Stephanie Hershaw, Norbert Schmittberg, Mikolaj Bonkowski and Sten Byriel.\n\nThe work has a somewhat complex history. Written for Covent Garden in 1957, to Martinů's own English libretto (based on Jonathan Griffin's translation of the novel Christ Recrucified by Nikos Kazantzakis), the opera was rejected by Covent Garden, Zurich Opera and Universal Edition, Martinů radically revised the work and it was premiered in Zurich in 1961. The two versions are very different and the 1957 original was regarded as too radical, it has however been reconstructed and performed. Jutland Opera will be performing the work in the composer's 1961 revision, in English.\n\nLooking ahead, the company has two more operas in the 2024/25 season. This Autumn they are performing Puccini's Madama Butterfly, conducted by Christopher Lichtenstein and directed by Ulrich Peters with Chunxi Stella Hu and Victoria Kaminskaite sharing the title role.\n\nPerhaps even more interesting, the final production of the season is Fete Galante, the only opera by Danish composer, Poul Schierbeck (1888-1949), which premiered in 1931. A pupil of Carl Nielsen, Schierbeck was known as a teacher in the Conservatory at Copenhagen, and the overture to Fete Galante retained a place in the orchestral repertoire, but his opera remains a relative rarity.\n\nDetails from Den Jyske Opera's website.\n\nVache Baroque in 2021\n\nVache Baroque's Summer opera production this year will be Pergolesi's L'Olimpiade, his 1735 setting of a libretto by Metastasio that clocked up more than 50 different settings (including one by Vivaldi from 1734 which was performed earlier this year by Irish National Opera, see my review). Vache Baroque's production takes place in the grounds of The Vache, a 17th-century house in Buckinghamshire. The production will be directed by Laura Attridge and conducted by Jonathan Darbourne with a cast including Nazan Fikret, Natasha Page, Bechara Moufarrej, Shafali Jalota, Frances Gregory, Robert Forrest and Aoife Miskelly. I recently met up with Aoife, during a break in their rehearsals, to find out more.\n\nPeergolesi's L'Olimpiade was written for the Carnival season of 1735 at the Teatro Tordinona in Rome, becoming one of the most admired settings of Metastasio's libretto. The work was the composer's penultimate opera, he died of tuberculosis in 1736, leaving his Stabat Mater, composed in the final weeks of his life, as his best-known work. Apart from performances in Italy in 1937 (for Pergolesi's bicentenary), the opera's modern performance history dates from 1990s, since when it has cropped up surprisingly infrequently.\n\nBefore being asked to sing in L'Olimpiade, Aoife had no experience with Pergolesi's opera, but she did see Irish National Opera's production of Vivaldi's setting of the libretto. She calls the opera a lovely discovery, a work full of beautiful arias. They are giving it in a mix of Italian and English, the Italian arias will be performed with new English spoken dialogue by Laura Attridge based on the original recitatives. The mix of language does not bother Aoife and she thinks that it makes the opera nicely accessible. Most of the characters have stunning arias and she finds it interesting that the work is so little known. Perhaps the fact that it has four soprano roles has something to do with it. Pergolesi's writing for the soloists is a mix of lyric and coloratura, this latter is a challenge as, like Vivaldi, Pergolesi's vocal music is very instrumental.\n\nVivaldi: Bajazet - Aoife Miskelly, James Laing - Irish National Opera in 2022 (Photo Kip Carroll)\n\nThis year, the Cumnock Tryst is presenting five days of events to celebrate its 10th birthday.\n\nFounded by composer Sir James MacMillan, the festival runs from 2 to 6 October 2024. MacMillan, who grew up in the East Ayrshire town, remains the festival's artistic director and takes his inspiration from models such as Peter Maxwell Davies’ St Magnus Festival in Orkney and Benjamin Britten’s Aldeburgh initiative. The Cumnock Tryst has established itself as a festival for and of its local community.\n\nBeyond the five day festival in October, The Cumnock Tryst continues its year-round work in the local community, and this year also sees the inaugural International Summer School for Composers – an opportunity for young composers from across the globe to come to East Ayrshire and work alongside Sir James MacMillan and Anna Thorvaldsdottir.\n\nThe festival this year features the debut of the newly formed Cumnock Tryst Ensemble. This new chamber group is directed by cellist Christian Elliott and consists Scottish musicians who have had an association with The Tryst over the last 10 years. The ensemble will have a commitment to the local community and a special focus on composers of our own era, with performances, in Cumnock and elsewhere, and will participate in many of the festival's community and education projects spearheaded. The inaugural recital includes music by Olivier Messiaen, Elliot Carter, Rebecca Clarke, James MacMillan and Frank Bridge.\n\nMusic of Land Reclamation, on the second day of the festival, will be the culmination of a composition project for Higher and Advanced Higher Music students at Robert Burns Academy. In a project led by Sir James MacMillan and Ayrshire composer Gillian Walker, the composers have responded to photographs of the local area from photographer Simon Butterworth’s series Abstract Excavationism: The Art of Industrial Land Reclamation.\n\nOver the years the festival has developed a number of ground-breaking music projects for children and adults with additional support needs, and this year James MacMillan has been working in Hillside School and the nearby Riverside Centre alongside Drake Music Scotland and the Hebrides Ensemble. With the belief that disability should never be a barrier to a deeply engaging involvement with music, the performance of The Unbroken Thread, follows a series of creative workshops where all involved devised their own music and modes of expression.\n\nThe Cumnock Tryst Tenth Birthday Gala Concert, All the Hills and Vales will feature local ensembles with international visitors for a birthday celebration of brass, strings and voices. The main work is All the Hills and Vales Along, an oratorio which James MacMillan composed for the 2018 festival to mark the centenary of the WW1 Armistice. Scottish emerging composers Gillian Walker and Erin Thomson will hear the world premieres of their recent Tryst commissions.\n\nOther performers at this year's festival include pianist Steven Osborne, the Maxwell Quartet, the Gesualdo Six, Joshua Ellicott, guitarist, flautist and singer Seán Gray, the Euan Stevenson Trio, Ayshire fiddler Alastair Savage and the Tommy Smith Youth Jazz Orchestra.\n\nFull details from the festival's website.\n\nThe Past & I: 100 years of Thomas Hardy; Arthur Keegan: Elegies for Emma and String Quartet No. 1 'Elegies for Tom', Derek Holman, Muriel Herbert, Britten, Imogen Holst, Gurney, Robin Milford, Finzi, Kerry Andrew; Lotte Betts-Dean, James Girling, Ligeti Quartet; Delphian\n\nReviewed 21 August 2024\n\nInspired by a letter from Thomas Hardy to Holst which was preserved by Holst's daughter and gifted to Britten, Arthur Keegan combines two of his own powerful responses to Hardy with 20th century Hardy settings in new arrangements, superbly performed.\n\nIn 2019, composer Arthur Keegan had a residency at the Red House in Aldeburgh and was supposed to be writing an orchestral work. But he was shown a letter that poet Thomas Hardy had written to composer Gustav Holst, thanking Holst for setting his poems. Holst kept the letter in a book of Hardy's poems, left it to his daughter Imogen, who in turn presented as a gift to Britten in 1952 who, in 1953 would set Hardy's poetry in the cycle Winter Words. Increasingly drawn to Hardy's poetry, Keegan would write two elegies based on Hardy's words which form the bookends to a fascinating collection of original work and arrangements by Keegan exploring reactions to Thomas Hardy (1840-1928).\n\nThe Past & I: 100 years of Thomas Hardy on Delphian features Arthur Keegan's Elegies for Emma and String Quartet No. 1 'Elegies for Tom', Derek Holman's Midnight on the Great Western, Muriel Herbert's Faintheart in a Railway Train, Britten's At the Railway Station, Upway, Imogen Holst's Weathers, Ivor Gurney's In the Black Winter Morning, Robin Milford's If It's Ever Spring Again, Gerald Finzi's The Too Short Time, Kerry Andrew's The Echo Elf Answers, and Finzi's The Shortening Days. Apart from the Keegan and the Andrew, all the remaining songs are arranged for the performers, mezzo-soprano Lotte Betts-Dean, guitarist James Girling and the Ligeti Quartet, by Arthur Keegan.\n\nGöteborg Opera is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. Founded in 1994, the company, which won the award for Sustainability at the International Opera Awards 2022, strives to be efficient in all its operations when working with finite and renewable resources. Its celebratory 2024/25 season includes new productions of Verdi's Otello and Britten's Peter Grimes, along with performances of Puccini's Madama Butterfly, a double bill of Mozart’s Der Schauspieldirektor and Tchaikovsky’s Iolanta, and Bizet’s Carmen and Puccini’s Tosca.\n\nVerdi's Otello, receiving its first staging in Gothenburg for 55 years, will be directed by the Spanish director Rafael R. Villalobos and conducted by Vincenzo Milletarì, but features a very Swedish cast, with Swedish Court singer Michael Weinius making his role debut as Otello, his dream role, which made him want to become an opera singer as a young boy at the Royal Opera in Stockholm, Gothenburg-born Julia Sporsén as Desdemona and Jens Søndergaard as Iago.\n\nPerhaps, even more intriguingly, Britten's Peter Grimes is being performed by a largely non-Anglophone cast, a fact that signals not only the international acceptance of the opera but will bring different perspectives to the performance. British director Netia Jones's production is inspired by the Swedish West coast and features Joachim Bäckström in the title role with Matilda Sterby as Ellen and Åke Zetterström as Balstrode. Distinguished mezzo-soprano Katarina Karnéus features as Auntie. The conductor is Christoph Gedschold, music director of Oper Leipzig.\n\nThe revival of Yoshi Oïda's 2016 production of Puccini's Madama Butterfly features the 1904 Brescia version of the opera. This was Puccini's first revision, made after the unsuccessful premiere. This was the first version to divide the opera into three acts, but this version is less revised than the final version and more openly condemnatory of colonialism and exoticism.\n\nFull details of Göteborg Opera's season from the company's website.\n\nBach: St John Passion - Benjamin Bruns, Christian Immler, Masaaki Suzuki, Bach Collegium Japan at BBC Proms (Photo: BBC/ Mark Allen)\n\nBach: St John Passion; Benjamin Bruns, Christian Immler, Carolyn Sampson, Alexander Chance, Shimon Yoshida, Bach Collegium Japan, Maasaki Suzuki; BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall\n\nReviewed 19 August 2024\n\nUltimately this was Maasaki Suzuki's evening as he forcefully directed the music that he knows and loves, giving us a personal vision that more than filled the hall\n\nThe BBC Proms provide the opportunity for a large number of people to hear a remarkably diverse range of music, but with the proviso that not everything is really suited to the wide open spaces of the Royal Albert Hall and visiting ensembles, often on a tour of more conventional venues, can struggle to fit the hall's distinctive acoustics.\n\nMaasaki Suzuki and the Bach Collegium Japan are in the middle of a Summer tour and their London stop at the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall gave us a chance to hear Suki's masterly approach to Bach's St John Passion with Benjamin Bruns as Evangelist, Christian Immler as Christus and the bass soloist, plus soloists Carolyn Sampson, Alexander Chance and Shimon Yoshida.\n\nBach: St John Passion - Alexander Chance, Masaaki Suzuki, Bach Collegium Japan at BBC Proms (Photo: BBC/ Mark Allen)\n\nSuzuki used 17 choristers with the soloists singing in the choir thus bringing the number up to 20/21, and an instrumental ensemble with 13 strings, and in the hall this meant that balance was somewhat off. In the big choruses, the upper strings simply did not carry against the choral sound, though the bass line, reinforced by double bass, bassoon and magnificent contrabassoon, was strong. But this is a compromise we must happily make to enable us to hear this ensemble. On the plus side, the soloists were all well attuned to the hall and there were none of the audibility problems that occurred in Saturday's performance of Britten's War Requiem [see my review].\n\nThe results were absorbing, at times thrilling and undoubtedly moving, but let us not kid ourselves, what we heard was probably a world away from anything Bach might have expected. But Bach's music is able to transcend the limitations and strictures of any particular performance.\n\nFounded just over three years ago by Jack Bazalgette and Jack Crozier, through the noise presents informal crowdfunded classical gigs to local communities across the UK and beyond. the company's Autumn 2024 season features over 50 concerts in venues across 22 UK and European cities. The Autumn line-up includes six extensive tours and five exclusive solo dates, from 4 September to 7 December 2024.\n\nA tour by Sheku and Isata Kanneh-Mason will feature two shows at London nightclub KOKO and a performance at Nottingham’s 2000-capacity stadium, Rock City and there will be two tours showcasing the traditional music of West African with acclaimed musicians Sidiki Dembélé and Seckou Keita. A journey into the UNESCO-protected polyphonic sounds of the mediaeval Mediterranean will feature Idrîsî Ensemble and a spotlight on pianists will include Mariam Batsashvili, Natalie Tenenbaum, and Pavel Kolesnikov.\n\nArtists making their noisenight debut are Mariam Batsashvili, Natalie Tenenbaum, Anastasia Kobekina, Idrîsî Ensemble, and Tangram Sound. Sheku and Isata Kanneh-Mason also make their first appearance as a duo.\n\nFull details from the through the noise website.\n\nBritten: War Requiem - Allan Clayton, Natalya Romaniw, Antonio Pappano, Will Liverman, London Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms with chorus directors Mariana Rosas and Neil Ferris (Photo: BBC/Chris Christodoulou)\n\nBritten: War Requiem; Natalya Romaniw, Allan Clayton, Will Liverman, London Symphony Chorus, BBC Symphony Chorus, Tiffin Boys Choir, Antonio Pappano; BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall\n\nReviewed 17 August 2024\n\nAntonio Pappano draws an evening of intense contrasts from his performers from thundering cannonades to intense, personal intimacy, yet always with a sense of discipline and clarity\n\nBritten's War Requiem has been a presence at the BBC Proms since 1963, a year after the premiere, and was last at the BBC Proms in 2019 when Peter Oundjian conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (with Allan Clayton as tenor soloist). This year the work returned on Saturday 17 August 2024, with Antonio Pappano conducting the London Symphony Orchestra with soloists Natalya Romaniw (soprano), Allan Clayton (tenor) and Will Liverman (baritone), plus the London Symphony Chorus and the BBC Symphony Chorus, with a boys choir drawn from the Tiffin Boys Choir (director James Day) with boys from HM Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace, and Temple Church.\n\nThe performers filled the stage and choir stalls, the wide open spaces of the hall seeming ideal for this work. But Britten's score pits the large scale against the intimate, and Antonio Pappano drew a remarkable dynamic range from his performers, from hushed, barely there to sheer terror. However, whatever the dynamic, the approach was always disciplined and even in the noisy cannonades of the Libera me, there was a clarity to the textures. Throughout, Pappano seemed to encourage a crispness of diction from his choral singers so that the very opening of the work was strong and intent, despite the hushed tones. This strength of character and intent wove its way throughout the performance.\n\nBritten: War Requiem - Natalya Romaniw, Allan Clayton, Antonio Pappano, Will Liverman, London Symphony Chorus, BBC Symphony Chorus, London Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms (Photo: BBC/Chris Christodoulou)\n\nAs has become the norm with this work, Pappano conducted both the orchestra and the chamber ensemble (placed stage left). His two male soloists, Allan Clayton and Will Liverman, seemed to both be deliberately holding back, drawing us toward them. Both gave us moments when they easily filled the hall, but a lot of the time the performance made us work to listen hard, the result was some magic moments but a tendency for the Wilfred Owen settings to seem somewhat muted (at least from our seats in the stalls, it may well be different on the radio or on TV).\n\nThe Miró Quartet at La Jolla Music Society in 2024 [Photo: Ken Jacques]\n\nThe Miró Quartet's album, Home, released in May 2024 is the quartet's second album on Pentatone, following their recording of Beethoven’s Complete String Quartets (2019). With the new album, the quartet explores the many concepts of what the term 'home' can mean. The pieces on the disc, all composed by Americans past and present, include two new commissions by Kevin Puts and Caroline Shaw, as well as known and lesser-known works by George Walker and Samuel Barber.\n\nBased in Austin, Texas, the Miró Quartet is one of the USA's most celebrated quartets. Founded in 1995, the current line-up is Daniel Ching and William Fedkenheuer, violin, John Largess, viola, and Joshua Gindele, cello. Daniel Ching and Joshua Gindele are founding members of the quartet, whilst John Largess has been a member since 1997. I recently chatted to John, via Zoom, about the new disc and the quartet's approach to performing and commissioning music, how the composers they work with often become friends, and the challenges facing chamber music in the 21st century.\n\nThe quartet's previous album featured Beethoven's complete quartets whilst earlier albums focused on the music of Schubert, so this new album represents a significant change. Yet John emphasises that Home represents a big part of who they are as a quartet. They love new music, love commissioning music, and they also love 20th-century North American music. The classic repertoire remains important to them, and their Beethoven disc required a huge commitment from them in terms of concerts and studio time, so it felt natural to do a disc which showed another side to the quartet.\n\nThe new disc is partly named for Kevin Puts' Home which appears on the disc alongside Caroline Shaw's Microfictions [volume 1] but the idea of home extends both to the concept of musical home and artistic home. Puts and Shaw are not only commissioned composers but both are friends, part of the quartet's community, another aspect of home.\n\nAlongside these new pieces, the quartet plays String Quartet in B minor by Samuel Barber (1910-1981), which John calls a wonderful work they had long wanted to record, and the slow movement from Quartet No. 1 by George Walker (1922-2018)\n\nThe Oxford International Song Festival (formerly the Oxford Lieder Festival) is back for its 23rd year with 70 events in 16 days, from 11 to 26 October 2024. Under the title of Cities of Song: People, Places, Music the festival explores the broad theme of cities that have inspired and influenced composers. With over 200 singers, instrumentalists and speakers in hundreds of works including the great song cycles of Schubert and Schumann alongside Baroque lute songs, contemporary works hot off the press, some exceptional chamber music, and choral performances.\n\nWorld premieres include Silent Songs of Josefine, a Kafka-inspired work by Can Bilir, performed by soprano Mimi Doulton with pianist Dylan Perez, and a reimagining of the Bhagavad Gita by Indian-American composer Reena Esmail, performed by contralto Jess Dandy and pianist Keval Shah. New songs by the emerging star composer Emily Hazrati will be sung by soprano Ella Taylor with pianist Jocelyn Freeman [see my recent review of their performances of Hazrati's songs at SongEasel in SE London]\n\nIrish composer and vocalist Jennifer Walshe performs selections from her album A Late Anthology of Early Music Vol. 1: Ancient to Renaissance, before leading a discussion on the potential uses of AI in the music of the present and future.\n\nNew generation performers at the festival include mezzo-soprano Angharad Rowlands, soprano Katy Thomson, bass-baritone James Newby (BBC New Generation Artist 2018 to 2020), and tenor Ted Black.. Eight of the evening recitals begin with a short Emerging Artist slot, giving a vital showcase to outstanding young professionals.\n\nAnne Le Bozec makes a return to the Festival to lead the annual Mastercourse, an opportunity for the eight outstanding duos from the festival’s Young Artist Programme to immerse themselves in song and learn from the very best international tutors and performers. It also gives an insight into the creative process for members of the public. Le Bozec will be joined by four guest tutors.\n\nThe middle weekend of the Festival is dedicated to Franz Schubert, part of a build-up to the Schubert bicentenary in 2028. The centrepiece will be a lecture-recital led by Graham Johnson, giving his ongoing survey of Schubert’s life 200 years on. So this year he explores Schubert in 1824, and he will be joined by singers including the English soprano Harriet Burns and German bass-baritone Stephan Loges. Other recitals are given by Christian Immler and Sophie Karthäuser, and the weekend concludes with Christopher Maltman and Audrey Saint-Gil performing Winterreise.\n\nLate night events include soprano Claire Booth and violinist Tamsin Waley-Cohen performing György Kurtág’s Kafka Fragments in the atmospheric setting of the candlelit 15th-century chapel of New College , and the Castalian String Quartet performing Schubert’s Rosamunde in the same magical setting.\n\nFull details from the festival's website.\n\nFounded in 2009, cellist Natalie Clein's Purbeck International Chamber Music Festival is celebrating Youth and Experience in its 2024 festival which runs from 29 August to 1 September 2024, featuring concerts set in the stunning landscapes of Dorset and the Isle of Purbeck.\n\nAlongside artistic director and cellist, Natalie Clein, performers will include violinists Henning Kraggerud, Priya Mitchell, and Nurit Stark as well as Aoife Ní Bhriain, at home both in the classical repertoire and Irish folk music, plus pianist Einav Yarden who will also be giving a solo recital dedicated to Fathers and Children, composer and viola player Brett Dean, and cellist Tatu Kauppinen, and mezzo-soprano Lotte Betts Dean.\n\nThere will be the world premiere of Brett Dean's I Starred Last Night, I Shone, written for his daughter, Lotte Betts Dean who will be joined by a string trio including Natalie Clein. Brett Dean has also arranged Schumann's Mary Stuart Song for mezzo-soprano (Lotte Betts Dean) and string quartet. Violinist Henning Kraggerud will perform alongside his daughter Alma Kraggerud also a violinist making a name for herself, and her brothers Franz and Hector on piano and cello. All the string players in the festival will be joining together to perform Mendelssohn's Octet/\n\nFull details from the festival website.\n\nMarschner: Der Vampyr - Milena Knauß - Gothic Opera (Photo: Craig Fuller)\n\nMarschner: Der Vampyr, in a version by Julia Mintzer & Kelly Lovelady; Giuseppe Pellingra, Milena Knauß, Jack Roberts, Amber Reeves, Conall O'Neill, Madeleine Todd, Matthew Scott Clark, Gráinne Gillis, director: Julia Mintzer, conductor: Kelly Lovelady, Gothic Opera; Grimeborn Festival at the Arcola Theatre\n\n14 August 2024\n\nA brave revival of the important German Romantic opera, reinvented as a Vampire romp, performed with a gusto that rather lost the subtleties of Marschner's score.\n\nA younger contemporary of Weber, Heinrich Marschner wrote operas in the same vein of German Romanticism, with its fascination with supernatural, exploring heightened emotions and the dramatic possibilities that the orchestra and an increased used of reminiscence motifs offered. Marschner's leading male characters are often flawed individuals, Don Giovanni-like, psychologically complex and his operas had an important influence on Wagner. However, they have their limitations, these composers and their librettists were developing a new German opera and the tradition lacked the depth of experience that Italian librettists could draw on. And from a modern stand-point, heroines tend to be passive and lack any sort of agency.\n\nMarschner's 1827 opera, Der Vampyr remains on the very fringes of the repertoire, partly because its libretto (by Marschner's brother-in-law) is ultimately based on John Polidori's 1819 short story, The Vampyre. But in English-speaking countries, productions of the opera remain rare. I am not sure when it last received a large-scale production in the UK, and its last significant outing was on TV in 1992 as a TV soap-opera! But then, this reflects the general lack of interest in pre-Wagnerian German Romantic opera, as much tends to me made of its dramaturgical limitations.\n\nGothic Opera was founded with a production of Marschner's Der Vampyr in 2019, and director Julia Mintzer and music director Kelly Lovelady returned to the opera, revisiting that adaptation. The production opened at Arcola Theatre's Grimeborn Festival on Wednesday 14 August 2024. Giuseppe Pellingra as Ruthven, Milena Knauß as Malwina, Jack Roberts as Aubrey, Amber Reeves as Emmy, Conall O’Neill as Davenaut, Madeleine Todd as Janthe, Matthew Scott Clark as Georg and Gráinne Gillis as Vampire Master. Designs were by Charles Ogilvie.\n\nMarschner: Der Vampyr - Giuseppe Pellingra, Amber Reeves - Gothic Opera (Photo: Craig Fuller)\n\nThe opera was sung in German, but with new English dialogue by Julia Mintzer and the production was best understood as being after Marschner, as Mintzer and Lovelady created a rather irreverent romp inspired by more modern vampire films, the production leaned into humour rather a lot and the finale veered between schock-horror and Monty Python. Somewhere along the line, Marschner's brand of German romanticism got well and truly lost.\n\nSimon Callaghan and the Piatti Quartet at Conway Hall in December 2022\n\nThe 2024/25 season Conway Hall's Sunday Concert series opens on 15 September 2024 when the Zoffany Ensemble returns to the hall with a programme that combines the original nonet version of Brahms' Serenade No. 1 with a chamber version of Richard Strauss' Til Eulenspiegel and the Septet by the 19th century French composer Adolphe Blanc.\n\nThe season continues with pianist Patrick Hemmerlé in a programme that moves from Bach and Beethoven, to Albeniz's Iberia, Granados' Goyescas and Spanish-inspired movements from Debussy's Préludes. Then horn player Ben Goldscheider joins the Heath Quartet for a a fascinating programme which includes horn quintets by Mozart and York Bowen, along with Eleanor Alberga's The Shining Gate of Morpheus for horn quintet. The series artistic director, pianist Simon Callaghan, joins the Brompton Quartet for a programme of Haydn, Grażyna Bacewicz and Dvorak, and there is a pre-concert recital from the Tondo Duo (Sophia Elger, saxophone, Declan Hickey, guitar). The Gildas Quartet will be mixing things up with William Alwyn and Jessie Montgomery alongside Haydn and Debussy.\n\nAs part of the Bloomsbury Festival, Darragh Morgan (violin) and Mary Dullea (piano) explore themes of ‘human’ qualities and ‘kindness’ in their programme of Arvo Pärt, Deirdre McKay, Hannah Kendall, Evis Sammoutis, Chick Corea and César Franck. The Autumn series ends on 15 December 2024 when the Primrose Piano Quartet move from a duo by Mozart to a trio by Schubert to a piano quartet by Brahms.\n\nI write the programme notes for the concert series, and give occasional pre-concert talks. My next one is on Sunday 8 December, with Past, present and future, looking at the music of Caroline Shaw, Schumann and Beethoven in advance of the Kyan Quartet's concert.\n\nFull details from the Conway Hall's website.\n\nMichael Morpurgo's 1999 book Kensuke's Kingdom might have very modern concerns with its bringing issues about care for the environment and the natural world into what is a traditional adventure story, but the new animated film based on the book which was released last month has a refreshingly traditional approach to the genre. The film, directed by Neil Boyle and Kirk Hendry with Peter Dodd as animation director and Michael Shorten as art director, features traditional hand drawn animation along with a fine symphonic score by British composer Stuart Hancock.\n\nHancock's score has a strong dramatic sweep to it and the original motion picture soundtrack, on MovieScoreMedia, makes for substantial and satisfying listening. The film was produced by Lupus Films, and the soundtrack was recorded by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra, conductor David Hernando Rico, and the Holst Singers, conductor Michael Waldron, and the score even has a solo for actor Ken Watanabe who plays Kensuke.\n\nI enjoyed listening to the soundtrack immensely, the album has 31 tracks lasting 73 minutes, which is a lot of music for a film, from short cues to longer sequences. Hancock's music has a depth and complexity to it, which is reflected in the fact that the performers include the full Bratislava Symphony Orchestra and the Holst Singers. Even from just listening, there is a strong emotional range, and I can't help but hope Hancock has time, energy and impetus to create a concert suite from the music.\n\nHancock says of the writing process, \"Kensuke’s Kingdom has very little dialogue – a gift for a composer! The two lead characters cannot speak each other’s language, so the music has space to flourish and help tell their story. I composed initial character themes and sketches, working closely with the directors from the storyboard/animatic stage onwards. I honed the music as the animation gradually fell into place, culminating in fantastic recording sessions with full symphony orchestra, choir and solo musicians in late 2022. Personal highlights included recording Ken Watanabe’s singing (remotely from Tokyo) and having author Michael Morpurgo’s glowing seal of approval at regular intervals!\"\n\nStuart Hancock's score for Kensuke's Kingdom is available via MovieScoreMedia and can be streamed on Spotify or YouTube. Full details of the film from the Kensuke's Kingdom website.\n\nGiacomo Meyerbeer: Le prophète; John Osborn, Elizabeth DeShong, Mané Galoyan, Edwin Crossley-Mercer, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre des Jeunes de la Méditerranée, Lyons Opera Chorus, Maîtrise des Bouches-du-Rhône, Mark Elder; LSO Live (with Palazzetto Bru Zane)\n\nReviewed 12 August 2024\n\nCaptures the essence of this remarkable opera, listening to this performance really conveys why the opera captivated so many in the 19th century\n\nThe first critical edition of Meyerbeer's 1849 opera, Le prophète, was published in 2011 and the 2017 recording from Essen (on Oehms Classics) conducted by Giuliano Carella was the first to record it. But that simple statement hides something more complex, the critical edition is not so much a definitive version as a template for various versions, owing to the work's complex history.\n\nLike other French grand operas, Le prophète was long and so subject to cuts, some sanctioned by the composer. But casting for those 1849 performances was fraught, Meyerbeer got his first choice for Fidès with the great Pauline Viardot, but had to live with Gustave-Hippolyte Roger in the title role. Roger was a lyric tenor who sang originally at the Opéra-Comique and the role of Jean had to be trimmed to suit him. Thus the composer sanctioned cuts do not exactly reflect Meyerbeer's intentions. The recording from Essen used a very full version, giving us nigh on 215 minutes of music (that's a hell of a long time in the theatre).\n\nLe prophète still needs a studio recording which explores all this in the right sort of editorial detail. This is what Palazzetto Bru Zane is good at, but the company has been relatively late to recordings of Meyerbeer's French operas. The new recording of Meyerbeer's Le prophète is a collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra and issued on the LSO Live label. Recorded live at the Festival d’Aix-en-Provence in 2023, it features Mark Elder conducting the combined forces of the London Symphony Orchestra and Orchestre des Jeunes de la Méditerranée, with John Osborn as Jean, Elizabeth DeShong as Fidès, Mané Galoyan as Berthe and Edwin Crossley-Mercer as Oberthal with Lyons Opera Chorus, and Maîtrise des Bouches-du-Rhône.\n\nThe recording does not come with the usual editorial superstructure that we might have expected if it had been on Palazzetto Bru Zane's own label. The booklet is frustratingly coy as to what we are exactly hearing, but it seems to be Meyerbeer's sanctioned 1849 version but in the new modern edition. Certainly the Essen recording has more material on it and lasts some 20 minutes longer than the LSO Live recording. Both discs have John Osborn in the title role, and I could quite happily hear him sing this for ever, but the new set has the advantages of Elisabeth DeShong as Fidès, and Mark Elder conducting the LSO.\n\nDe Pasión Mortal: Songs from two golden ages; Henry Purcell, Claudio Monteverdi, Víctor Jara, Tomás Méndez, Silvio Rodríguez, Ariel Ramírez, Ñico Rojas, Rafael Hernández Marín; Nicolas Mulroy, Elizabeth Kenny, Toby Carr, Music for a While; LINN Records\n\nReviewed 9 August 2024\n\nCombining 17th century European song with that from 20th century Latin America, Nicholas Mulroy and friends create a recital which seduces and engages, by turns lyrical and melancholy, yet always compelling\n\nDe Pasión Mortal: Songs from two golden ages on Linn Records features tenor Nicholas Mulroy in a recital that juxtaposes two very different, yet equally intimate song traditions, that of 17th century Europe (here England and Italy) and 20th century Latin America. Mulroy is joined by Elizabeth Kenny on archlute, guitars and theorbo, Toby Carr on guitars and theorbo, and Music for While (Margaret Faultess and Rachel Stroud, violin, Anna Curzon and Francesca Gilbert, viola, Andrew Skidmore, cello).\n\nThe recital features music by Henry Purcell and Claudio Monteverdi, alongside 20th century Latin American composers, Víctor Jara, Tomás Méndez, Silvio Rodríguez, Ariel Ramírez, Ñico Rojas, and Rafael Hernández Marín. Perhaps, at first, the combination might seem slightly unlikely, but all feature the same intimacy of a voice and one or two stringed instruments. The majority of tracks feature both Elizabeth Kenny and Toby Carr, though each gets an instrumental solo, and four tracks feature the instrumental ensemble Music for While as well.\n\nBarbican Quartet (Photo: Andrej Grilc)\n\nThe Barbican Quartet (Amarins Wierdsma, violin, Kate Maloney, violin, Christoph Slenczka, viola, Yoanna Prodanova, cello) is so-named partly because the founding members, Amarins, Christoph and Yoanna met at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama during their studies, first playing chamber music together for pleasure and later becoming more serious. The present line-up was formed in 2022 when Kate joined them, and that year the quartet won the 71st ARD International String Quartet Competition in Munich.\n\nOne of the prizes that the quartet took away from the competition was a recording with the Genuin label. That recording, the quartet's debut, came out in June. Manifesto on Love features Leoš Janáček’s String Quartet No.2 \"Listydůvěrné\" (Intimate Letters), The Ear of Grain by Dobrinka Tabakova and two works by Robert Schumann, String Quartet No. 3, Op. 41 in A major and Wenn ich ein Vöglein wär. The works in the programme, including the new piece commissioned from Dobrinka Tabakova by the competition, are all linked by the idea of the love letter, as Schumann's quartet can be seen as a love letter to his wife Clara. The idea of storytelling is something that the quartet focuses on, it gives them great pleasure. Though they felt that it made sense for their album to have a theme, Manifesto on Love also enabled them to make a wonderful connection between two pieces they love, with the nickname for Janáček's extremely direct quartet seeming to give them their theme.\n\nThey comment that everything is connected in some way, and it is easy to make such connections even if these are somewhat abstract, there are different ways of storytelling. It is not just about having a theme, stories can involve the way pieces relate, but also the more personal element with all four individual voices creating a narrative. This sense of four different voices creating a single whole is one that the quartet works on a lot in rehearsals, admitting that it can be hard work. What they are aiming for is that sense of understanding each other without the need for words. So, the storytelling need not be literal, they can use colour and sound, as well as the sense of communication between the four voices. An abstract piece of music might have a story based on colour and mood, an essence of feeling as in a short story. Sometimes the story simply comes from a visual image as in Dobrinka Tabakova's piece on the disc, inspired by a Joan Miró painting of the same name and links to the Brothers Grimm story.\n\nBeethoven: Violin Concerto - Tobias Feldmann, Anja Bihlmaier, BBC Philharmonic Orchestra - BBC Proms (Photo: BBC/Andy Paradise)\n\nGerman conductor Anja Bihlmaier has been appointed principal guest conductor of the BBC Philharmonic, starting in September, working alongside the orchestra's chief conductor, John Storgårds. Bihlmaier conduct the BBC Philharmonic at the BBC Proms last night (8 August 2024) in a programme the consisted of Beethoven's Violin Concerto with soloist Tobias Feldmann, Brahms' Symphony No. 4 and Sarah Gibson’s warp & weft, inspired by the work of Canadian artist Miriam Schapiro.\n\nBihlmaier commented, \"From our first concert at Bridgewater Hall, playing Shostakovich and Dvorak, I felt a special bond and mutual trust with the musicians. I love their dedication, their virtuosity and willingness to experiment, their sense of humour and most importantly their great passion for the music, and how they bring it to life for their audience. Our Proms concert last year and Bruckner 7 in Manchester were unforgettable highlights. I look forward to continuing our journey, hoping to achieve something special in the vibrant city of Manchester and at the BBC Proms.\"\n\nBihlmaier studied at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg and the Mozarteum Salzburg, where she was a pupil of Dennis Russell Davies and Jorge Rotter. She has been chief conductor of the Residentie Orkest since August 2021, conducted the August performances of Glyndebourne’s production of Carmen.\n\nProm 26 is available on BBC Sounds. Full details from the BBC website.\n\nGlasgow Cathedral Festival in 2022\n\nGlasgow Cathedral, the city's oldest building, is hosting the eighth Glasgow Cathedral Festival from 19 to 22 September 2024, featuring a diverse programme of live music, film, art, multi-media collaborations, talks and tours, all offering audiences the chance to reconsider, rediscover, reimagine, to expand their imaginations, explore beneath the surface and refresh their senses.\n\nThe first stone cathedral was dedicated in 1136, in the presence of King David I. Fragments of this building have been found beneath the structure of the present cathedral, which was dedicated in 1197, although much of the present cathedral dates from a major rebuilding in the 13th century. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Mungo, the patron saint of Glasgow, whose tomb lies at the centre of the building's Lower Church, and following its foundation in 1451, the University of Glasgow held its first classes within the cathedral's chapter house.\n\nThe festival opens with a recital from Scottish mezzo-soprano Rowan Hellier and pianist Jonathan Ware. She Represents sees fashion and song intersect; exploring the role of symbolism and sensuality in the modern female identity, Hellier and Ware perform music by French composer Rita Strohl (1865-1941), Francis Poulenc, Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg, Mischa Spoliansky (including the wonderful Ich bin ein Vamp), and Cathy Berberian's amazing Stripsody, with outfits created by designer Rebekka Dornhege Reyes.\n\nSilent film has become a popular part of the festival's programme and this year it is the American horror classic Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1920), with a live soundtrack from Odeon Leicester Square’s organist Donald MacKenzie.\n\nImage by Kirsty Matheson\n\nThe Hebrides Ensemble will be performing Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire with soprano Stephanie Lamprea, alongside Helen Grime's Pierrot Miniatures and the Scottish premiere of Brushstrokes of Nightmares and Dreams by Electra Perivolaris and an exhibition of new paintings by Kirsty Matheson, an artist in whose work music and art intertwine and who has done a sequence of 21 paintings for the 21 movements of Schoenberg's work.\n\nFiddle/harp duo Twelfth Day will be presenting their unique blend of classical skill and folk roots in the cathedral's cloister in an event aimed at families, whilst in the evening the crypt is the location for Twilight in the Crypt with saxophone improvisations from Scottish jazz legend Tommy Smith, and Octandre Ensemble making their Scottish debut with time-space-sound-light, a reflective sequence of music by Christian Mason.\n\nThe festival ends with another family-friendly lunchtime event: a recital from organist Katherine Dienes-Williams, Director of Music at Guildford Cathedral, whose programme evokes everything from Hollywood glamour to Scottish folk songs—with a sighting of some penguins along the way!\n\nThere are tours of the cathedral and wider Glasgow including the necropolis, and which links up with the museum of Glasgow Royal Infirmary across the precinct.\n\nFull details from the festival's website."
