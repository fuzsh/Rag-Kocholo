        "text": "We are happy to present the June 2017 issue of SGNScoops Magazine, filled with great features, photographs and information for all Gospel music fans everywhere. We highlight the Collingsworth Family this month with a great cover story by Erin Stevens. Complimenting that feature is a Father's Day chat with the men of the Collingsworths by Craig Harris. Kari Gooch talks about her dad, Rickey, and his recent health issues, as recorded by Fayth Lore. Other intriguing artist features include the Hinson Family, Eagle's Wings, Talleys, Anchormen and Carolina Quartet. We hear about Southern Gospel in the West through Derek Simonis and Justin Gilmore. Elena Cragun of the Craguns is the star of Younger Perspective and Joey Gore talks to Lorraine Walker about the Wilmington Celebration Choir. Don't miss a photospread from the Gaither Family Fest, Dusty Wells, Selena Day, Randall Hamms' CD reviews, and so much more."
