Doyle passed away on December 6, 2023, surrounded by his family, leaving behind a legacy marked by dedication, kindness, and a zest for life. The family will receive friends from 6:00pm – 8:00pm, Tuesday, December 12, 2023 at Nalley-Pickle & Welch Funeral Home in Midland, Texas.\n\nBorn and raised in the picturesque town of Bonnerdale, Arkansas, Doyle had a deep appreciation for nature from an early age. He could often be found exploring the great outdoors, hunting and fishing, or camping with his beloved son, Jim Diggs. These shared experiences created lasting memories that will be cherished forever.\n\nDoyle’s dedication was commendable, both in his personal and professional life. As an electrician, he exemplified the meaning of hard work and perseverance. Whether he was troubleshooting electrical systems or lending a helping hand to those in need, Doyle’s expertise and commitment made him a valuable member of the community.\n\nA true steward of the land, Doyle took great pride in maintaining his family farm and nurturing the surrounding environment. His dedication was an inspiration to all those who knew him, illustrating the importance of preserving the natural world for future generations.\n\nDoyle leaves behind a loving family who will forever cherish his memory. He is survived by his son, Jim Diggs and wife Tameka Diggs, who will continue to honor his father’s teachings and values. He is also survived by his sister, Bobbie Parker of Bonnerdale, Arkansas, and his brother, Carroll Diggs and wife Donna (Gail) Diggs of Granite Shoals, Texas. Additionally, his grandson, Michael Diggs of San Angelo, Texas, will fondly remember their shared moments of laughter and love.\n\nThough Doyle’s journey in this life has come to an end, his spirit will live on in the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing him. His gentle demeanor, contagious laughter, and unwavering love for his family and nature will forever be remembered.\n\nDoyle Diggs will be greatly missed but his impact on the lives of those who knew him will forever remain. May he rest in eternal peace.\n\nThe family would like to give thanks to Legacy Ranch and Home Hospice for all their help.\n\nGraveside service will be 11:00AM, Saturday, December 16, 2023, in the Grant's Chapel Cemetery, Bonnerdale under the direction of Smith Family Funeral Home, Hot Springs."
