        "text": "By Purnima Pilapitiya\n\nView(s):\n\n2018 began on a high note for Kishani Jayasinghe. On January 8, the well known soprano thrilled close to a full house at the Lionel Wendt with âKishani Sings with Friends from the Royal Opera Houseâ. Despite being a Monday, music lovers braved the rush-hour traffic to catch the artiste in action together with her guest performers and obvious friends- Grammy award-winning pianist and accompanist Christopher Glynn and Australian baritone Grant Doyle.\n\nBoth a technically skilled singer and performer, Kishani is no stranger to wowing audiences and has over the past few years since her return home, treated local music aficionados to new musical experiences. This three part programme paid tribute to operaÂ followed by a selection of Broadway favourites. The two and a half hour show with its beautifully balanced programme of light, rich and dramatic pieces laced with the genuine joy in performance and the chemistry between the three artistes saw the curtain fall to shouts of âencoreâ and caused the usually restrainedÂ Sri Lankan audience to spontaneously take to their feet with a much deserved standing ovation.\n\nBoth Kishani and Grant took turns wowing the crowd with their strong and unamplified (not a single microphone was used) vocals and sincere interpretations. While Sri Lankan audiences have come to expect Kishaniâs powerful performances, Grant Doyle mirrored her emotion and sincerity, capturing every single audience member with his rich baritone and effortless singing.Â Having performed together since they were fellow artistes at the Young Artistes Programme at the Royal Opera House, their duets from intense arias from Pucciniâs âLa BohÃ¨meâ, Bizetâs âThe Pearl FishersâÂ to Broadway standards-Â âSomewhereâ and âLove Changes Everythingâ held viewers captive with their diverse dramatic skills and genuine connection.\n\nNot to be overshadowed was Christopher Glynn whose accompaniment almost anticipated the mood of every performance that night, at times fiery, at times breathtakingly haunting but consistently melting into the vocals and providing the two singers with the perfect instrumental companion. Other standout performances included Kishaniâs haunting arias from I Capuleti e i Montecchi or Belliniâs opera based on Romeo and Juliet and La Boheme which carried aÂ tenderness and melancholy that lent variety to the programme.\n\nIt was difficult to identify Grant Doyleâs musical comfort zone as the baritone delivered consistently spirited pieces throughout the night. Whether he was a determined Inspector Javert, a cheeky Don Juan or performing the iconic Figaroâs aria from Barber of Seville the charismatic singer had the audience in the palm of his hand as he worked the stage entrancing the entire auditorium, leaving each performance in a storm of applause.\n\nKeeping to the name of the show, the night saw three artistes from around the world linked by a friendship which resonated through the music and the care they displayed for each otherâs performance. It was a memorable night of pure artistry and an experience local audiences were privileged to be a part of."
