        "text": "Fri 28 Aug 2020\n\nPicnic rugs and barbecue tongs at the ready – it is nearly time to enjoy The Hannells Darley Park Concert at Home! Here is your essential guide to how to enjoy this year’s virtual event on Sunday 30 August, after the Covid-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of this year’s live concert.\n\nDerby LIVE, Derby City Council’s arts and events arm, has teamed up with Sinfonia Viva, the orchestra of the East Midlands, and BBC Radio Derby to bring The Hannells Darley Park Concert to you at home. Derby LIVE are delighted that the sponsors who were originally involved in this year’s outdoor concert are also supporting this innovative celebration of music. They are Hannells Estate Agents, Flint Bishop Solicitors, HUUB, Mortgage Advice Bureau, Stratstone BMW and MINI Derby and WDS.\n\nThanks to some technical wizardry, video recordings of last year’s concert and some new, filmed footage have been blended to create a three-hour show, to be broadcast live on the BBC website and BBC iPlayer from 6pm and 9pm, while the show is broadcast simultaneously on BBC Radio Derby. The host will be BBC Radio Derby favourite Andy Twigge.\n\nTo set the mood in the lead up to the virtual event, tune in to BBC Radio Derby from 4pm for all the background chat about how the concert has been re-invented for this year, with presenter Dean Pepall.\n\nFrom 6pm, watch the event live on your PC or laptop from the BBC Radio Derby website at bbc.co.uk/darley20. You can also find this link on BBC Radio Derby's Facebook page.\n\nAlternatively, watch on BBC iPlayer by going to bbc.co.uk/iplayer on your PC, or choosing BBC iPlayer on your smart TV. You will need to sign in to view using your BBC username and password, which you can set up beforehand at bbc.co.uk. Search for Darley Park Concert. The live broadcast will start at 6pm.\n\nThe event is known for its sense of community spirit, so to capture this in the most unusual of circumstances, you can post photos and messages with #Darley20 on your own Twitter or Instagram, or on the @DerbyLIVE Facebook page, or on BBC Radio Derby’s Facebook page, to appear on our Derby LIVE Social Media wall. We look forward to seeing your photos, comments and videos.\n\nYou can access all the links, to the BBC Radio Derby website, to iPlayer, Facebook and the Social Media wall, from the Derby LIVE website here, on the day of the concert and for seven days afterwards.\n\nLast year’s concert celebrated 1969 and Golden Anniversaries through a programme of music put together by the Grammy-nominated Sinfonia Viva. The conductor from last year, Ben Pope, has remastered the sound for this year’s broadcast, and will also present the live introductions to each piece of music.\n\nFurther highlights are five new songs recorded by a cabaret band of seven Sinfonia Viva musicians, with conductor James Holmes, a familiar face from the Darley Park Concerts who was due to lead this year’s live event. They are joined on vocals by Derbyshire singer Andy Quinn, who wowed the crowds at the Darley Park Concert in 2018. Sinfonia Viva’s new recordings are supported by Rolls-Royce.\n\nDerby Jazz are also contributing a set as part of their LOOSEN UP programme, set up in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the continuing constrictions on live performance, Derby Jazz has commissioned Dennis Rollins MBE to create and write new music, designed to be played outdoors by an eleven-piece acoustic ensemble. This recording is one of ten or more performances they are giving in Derby in September and October.\n\nCouncillor Robin Wood, Derby City Council’s Cabinet Member for Culture, Leisure and Tourism, said:\n\n“I had the pleasure of watching some of the recording for the new pieces of music, and it is marvellous how everyone has pulled together to create a musical experience to remember for this most unusual of years.

With funding from Arts Council England, and sometimes Derby City Council, in a normal year it promotes over twenty performances, runs workshops for adults and young people and in most years it also commissions new work from major artists with strong Derby and East Midlands connections.\n\nThis year its normal work has been massively disrupted so it’s diverted its resources into commissioning Dennis Rollins MBE to create and write new music for LOOSEN UP. An eleven-piece acoustic ensemble designed to play outdoors and made up of eight of the region’s most exciting professional jazz musicians, two outstanding amateur players and an incredibly talented schoolboy from Nottingham. Under Dennis’ leadership they’ve been working together online and have spent two days rehearsing together in the flesh. This recording is one of ten or more performances they are giving in Derby in September and October. Derby Jazz hope to be back with their regular programme in January 2021."
