Here, the information is very compressed and shows broadly where they have worked or which organisations have employed them; this seems to be the simplest indication of success. It is, in a sense, quantitative.1 Readers wishing to find more interesting information on, for instance, which works were performed or composed, or names of collaborators or conductors, can search the websites.\n\nThere is no systematic link between the length of entries and the importance of each artist’s work.\n\nThere is a listing of artists who are in the early stages of careers who have not had time to accumulate lengthy CVs. Placement in this list is somewhat intuitive.\n\nOrchestral players are included only if they are section principals, unless they are members of an orchestra such as the Vienna Philharmonic for which entry is extremely competitive.\n\nSimilarly, opera singers are included only if they are well launched as soloists in major roles.\n\nMembers of young artist programs, even with the most distinguished companies, are not included.\n\nThe rules for this list are not intended to downplay the considerable achievement in gaining positions in overseas orchestras, opera companies or ensembles.\n\nThis list is based on achievement overseas and does not include information about work in Australia. One consequence is the omission of very important artists whose careers have been in Australia.\n\nA rationale for this survey and ruminations on what has been discovered can be found here.\n\nReaders wishing to propose someone for inclusion or to correct an entry are welcome to send the name and a few lines of explanation to letts@musictrust.com.au.1\n\nMain List\n\nGraham Abbott, conductor.
