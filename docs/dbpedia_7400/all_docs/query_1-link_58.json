        "text": "LaNell Barron Doyle, 82, loving follower of Christ, passed away Tuesday, November 30, 2021.\n\nShe was born to Frank and Minnie Barron near Edom, Texas. She met her husband of 60 years, Charles “Ed” Doyle, Jr., while attending Tyler Junior College where she received her associate degree in business. They married shortly after and lived in Austin while Ed completed his studies. They moved to Fort Worth where they raised a family together.\n\nLaNell worked outside of the home for IBM, General Dynamics and finally as a financial secretary for Travis Avenue Baptist Church where she was a faithful member and preschool Sunday school teacher for many years. She loved serving others in time of need by providing food, clothing, words of encouragement and prayer support.\n\nShe and Ed shared a love for travel as they spent time in retirement visiting many foreign locations including Israel, Russia, Japan and European countries.\n\nIn addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Martha (Ron) Baxter; children, Lisa (John) Snell, Amy (Mike) Petersen and Scott (Pam) Doyle; grandchildren Andrew (Blake) Petersen, Ryan (Amanda) Snell, Tyler (Keely) Snell, Elizabeth Petersen, Sawyer Snell, Grant Doyle, Blake Snell and Erin Doyle; and great grandchild, Camden Petersen. She also leaves behind numerous nephews, nieces, and cousins.\n\nThe family wishes to thank all those who have provided care and support to LaNell during the last few years.\n\nThe memorial service will be held on Tuesday, December 7 at 2:00 pm in the sanctuary at Travis Avenue Baptist Church.\n\nVisitation will be held at 12:30 pm at the church prior to the service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Travis Avenue Baptist Church or Mercy Clinic, PO Box 11557, Fort Worth, Texas 76110."
