        "text": "Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang by Kate Wilhelm\n\nSynopsis: Before becoming one of today’s most intriguing and innovative mystery writers, Kate Wilhelm was a leading writer of science fiction, acclaimed for classics like The Infinity Box and The Clewiston Test.\n\nNow one of her most famous novels returns to print, the spellbinding story of an isolated post-holocaust community determined to preserve itself, through a perilous experiment in cloning. Sweeping, dramatic, rich with humanity, and rigorous in its science, Where Later the Sweet Birds Sang is widely regarded as a high point of both humanistic and “hard” SF, and won SF’s Hugo Award and Locus Award on its first publication. It is as compelling today as it was then.\n\n1977 WINNER OF THE HUGO AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL\n\nFirst Published: 1976 | ISBN-13: 978-0312866150\n\nAuthor’s Homepage: http://katewilhelm.com\n\nAs humanity is all but wiped out and sexual reproduction fails, a cloistered family of doctors and scientists attempt to clone themselves. But the clones seem… different. A haunting tale of human individuality and imagination, this book is a perfect read. – From 10 Great Books on Science Fiction\n\nThe Guardian Book Review\n\nEyrie Book Review\n\nScience Fiction Ruminations Book Review\n\nSpeculiction Book Review"
