        "text": "Before becoming one of today's most intriguing and innovative mystery writers, Kate Wilhelm was a leading writer of science fiction, acclaimed for classics like The Infinity Box and The Clewiston Test.\n\nNow one of her most famous novels returns to print, the spellbinding story of an isolated post-holocaust community determined to preserve itself, through a perilous experiment in cloning. Sweeping, dramatic, rich with humanity, and rigorous in its science, Where Later the Sweet Birds Sang is widely regarded as a high point of both humanistic and \"hard\" SF, and won SF's Hugo Award and Locus Award on its first publication. It is as compelling today as it was then.\n\nBorn in 1928, Kate Wilhelm has been publishing novels since the early 1960s. Her SF writing has earned her a Hugo Award and three Nebula Awards.\n\nWinner of the Hugo and Locus Awards\n\nBefore becomming one of today's most innovative mystery writers, Wilhelm was a celebrated SF author. With this novel, one of her most famous books returns to print.\n\nWhere Late the Sweet Birds Sang tells the spellbinding story of an isolated post-holocaust community determined to preserve itself through a perilous experiment in cloning. Now, at the dawn of the 21st century, this tale is perhaps more compelling and timely than ever before.\n\n\"The best novel about cloning written to date.\"Locus\n\n\"Kate Wilhelm's cautionary message comes through loud and clear.\"The New York Times"
