        "text": "Introduction by Lisa Tuttle\n\nThe Sumner family can read the signs: the droughts and floods, the blighted crops, the shortages, the rampant diseases, and, above all, the increasing sterility of the population all point to one thing. Their isolated farm in the Appalachians gives them the ideal place to survive the coming meltdown, and their wealth gives them the means. Men and women must clone themselves for humanity to survive. But what then?\n\n'Superb' THE ENCYLOPEDIA OF SCIENCE FICTION\n\n'If all SF was as finely crafted as Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang, we'd have great cause to rejoice' VECTOR\n\nKate Wilhelm (1928-)\n\nKate Wilhelm has won many awards for her writing, including the Hugo for Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang. She has also been influential beyond her writing through the Milford Science Fiction Writers' Conference, founded by her late husband, Damon Knight."
