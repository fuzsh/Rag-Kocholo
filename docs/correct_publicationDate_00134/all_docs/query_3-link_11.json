        "text": "1974 single by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nFor the film, see Sweet Home Alabama (film).\n\n\"Sweet Home Alabama\" is a song by American rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, released on the band's second album Second Helping (1974). It was written in response to Neil Young's 1970 song \"Southern Man\", which the band felt blamed the entire South for American slavery;[5] Young is name-checked and dissed in the lyrics. It reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1974, becoming the band's highest-charting single.[6]\n\nThe song remains a staple in southern and classic rock, and is arguably the band's signature song.[7][8][9][10]\n\nNone of the three writers of the song were from Alabama; Ronnie Van Zant and Gary Rossington were both born in Jacksonville, Florida, while Ed King was from Glendale, California. In an interview with Garden & Gun, Rossington explained the writing process: \"I had this little riff. It's the little picking part and I kept playing it over and over when we were waiting on everyone to arrive for rehearsal. Ronnie and I were sitting there, and he kept saying, 'play that again'. Then Ronnie wrote the lyrics and Ed and I wrote the music.\"[11] The introductive signature riff, prevalent throughout the song, was written and played by Ed King. [12] The basic track was recorded with guide lead vocals, Ed King's lead guitar, Leon Wilkeson's bass, and Bob Burns' drums. The final lead vocals from Van Zant, along with Rossington and Collins' rhythm guitars and Powell's piano were added later.[13]\n\n\"Sweet Home Alabama\" was a major chart hit for a band whose previous singles had \"lazily sauntered out into release with no particular intent.\" The hit led to two television rock show offers that the band declined.[14] In addition to the original appearance on Second Helping, the song has appeared on numerous Lynyrd Skynyrd compilations and live albums.\n\nRecord World called it the group's \"most commercial single entry so far.\"[15]\n\n\"Sweet Home Alabama\" was written in answer to two songs by Neil Young, \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama\", because the songs \"took the entire South to task for the bloody history of slavery and its aftermath.\"[5] \"We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two,\" said Ronnie Van Zant at the time.[14] The lyrics to \"Sweet Home Alabama\" include the following lines:\n\nWell, I heard Mister Young sing about her\n\nWell, I heard ol' Neil put her down\n\nWell, I hope Neil Young will remember\n\nA Southern man don't need him around anyhow\n\nIn Young's 2012 autobiography Waging Heavy Peace, he commented on his song: \"My own song 'Alabama' richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record. I don't like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue.\"[16]\n\nAnother part of \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was also controversial in its reference to George Wallace, the governor of Alabama and supporter of racial segregation:\n\nIn Birmingham, they love the governor (boo boo boo)\n\nNow we all did what we could do\n\nNow Watergate does not bother me\n\nDoes your conscience bother you?\n\nTell the truth\n\n...\n\nSweet home Alabama, oh, sweet home baby\n\nWhere the skies are so blue and the governor's true\n\nThe choice of Birmingham in connection with the governor (rather than the capital of Montgomery) is significant because it was the site of civil rights activism and violence in the 1960s. In 1975, Van Zant said: \"The lyrics about the governor of Alabama were misunderstood. The general public didn't notice the words 'Boo! Boo! Boo!' after that particular line, and the media picked up only on the reference to the people loving the governor.\"[17] \"The line 'We all did what we could do' is sort of ambiguous,\" Al Kooper notes, \"'We tried to get Wallace out of there' is how I always thought of it.\"[17] Toward the end of the song, Van Zant adds \"where the governor's true\" to the chorus's \"where the skies are so blue,\" a line seemingly contradictory to the previous lyrics. Journalist Al Swenson argues that the song is more complex than many believe and is not an endorsement of Wallace.[17] Van Zant said: \"Wallace and I have very little in common. I don't like what he says about colored people.\"[17]\n\nFurther complicating the racial politics of the song is the fact that Merry Clayton and Clydie King, two well-known black studio singers, are heard on the track as backing vocalists. In a 2013 interview, Clayton spoke at length about her decision to take the job. In her recollection, her initial response was negative: \"[Clydie King] said the song was 'Sweet Home Alabama.' There was a silence on the phone for quite a while. I said, 'Clydie, are you serious? I'm not singing nothing about nobody's sweet home Alabama. Period.'\" Nonetheless, Clayton was persuaded to take the job, to \"let the music be [her] protest.\"[18]\n\nMusic historians examining the juxtaposition of invoking Richard Nixon and Watergate after Wallace and Birmingham note that one reading of the lyrics is an \"attack against the liberals who were so outraged at Nixon's conduct\" while others interpret it regionally: \"the band was speaking for the entire South, saying to northerners, we're not judging you as ordinary citizens for the failures of your leaders in Watergate; don't judge all of us as individuals for the racial problems of southern society.\"[19]\n\nEd King, the song's cowriter, contradicted his former bandmates in a 2009 post on his website. He claimed that the song was originally intended as the unabashed defense of Alabama, and even Wallace, that the song appears to be:\n\nI can understand where the \"boo boo boo\" would be misunderstood. It's not US going \"boo\" ... it's what the Southern man hears the Northern man say every time the Southern man'd say \"In Birmingham we love the gov'nor\". Get it? \"We all did what WE could do!\" to get Wallace elected. It's not a popular opinion but Wallace stood for the average white guy in the South.\n\n\"Watergate doesn't bother me\" because that stuff happens in politics...but someone's conscience ought to bother them for what happened to Wallace. Arthur Bremer may or may not have been a yankee but he sure destroyed whatever chance Wallace had to be president. And hardly anyone in America noticed. I still like the plaque that hangs here in my office that says I'm an honorary member of the Alabama State Militia...signed personally by George C. Sure, the man had his flaws. But he spoke for the common man of the South. And, whoa, I'm gonna get in trouble over this whole dang post!\"[20]\n\nPartial credits (those noted with a reference) mostly via Richard Buskin and Rodney Mills.[13]\n\nRonnie Van Zant – lead vocals[13]\n\nEd King – lead guitar,[13] backing vocals (first \"woo\" at the end of the last chorus)\n\nLeon Wilkeson – bass guitar,[13] backing vocals (second \"woo\" at the end of the last chorus)\n\nBob Burns – drums[13]\n\nBilly Powell – piano[13]\n\nAllen Collins – rhythm guitar[13] (left channel)\n\nGary Rossington – rhythm guitar[13] (right channel), acoustic guitar (left channel)\n\nAl Kooper – backing vocals[13] (left channel), producer,[13] engineer[13]\n\nClydie King – background vocals[14]\n\nMerry Clayton – background vocals[14]\n\nRodney Mills - engineer[13]\n\nRichard Buskin and Rodney Mills claim that the female backing vocals were performed by The Sweet Inspirations instead of Clydie King and Merry Clayton; Buskin also does not credit the acoustic guitarist but also recalls that the band did not like when their producer Al Kooper overdubbed himself onto their records, which means the acoustic guitar is likely played by Rossington, Collins, or King.[13]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales Brazil (Pro-Música Brasil)[32] Gold 30,000‡ Denmark (IFPI Danmark)[33] Platinum 90,000‡ Germany (BVMI)[34] Platinum 500,000‡ Italy (FIMI)[35] Platinum 50,000‡ Spain (PROMUSICAE)[36] Platinum 60,000‡ United Kingdom (BPI)[37] 2× Platinum 1,200,000‡ United States (RIAA)[39]\n\nDigital Gold 3,680,000[38] United States (RIAA)[41]\n\nMastertone Platinum 1,200,000[40]\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nKid Rock's 2008 song \"All Summer Long\" interpolates \"Sweet Home Alabama\" on the chorus and uses the guitar solo and piano outro, as well as the \"turn it up\" shout before the guitar solo; Billy Powell is featured on the track. \"All Summer Long\" also samples Warren Zevon's \"Werewolves of London\", which has a similar chord progression to \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\n\nThe song is credited to Matthew Shafer, Waddy Wachtel, R.J. Ritchie, Leroy Marinell, Warren Zevon, Edward King, Gary Rossington and Ronnie Van Zant.

It is also featured in NASCAR 3D: The IMAX Experience as well as NASCAR 21: Ignition.\n\nThe song featured in the soundtrack of the 2010 animated film Despicable Me.\n\nThe song featured in the soundtrack of the 1997 film Con Air.\n\nThe song was parodied and mocked by Warren Zevon in \"Play It All Night Long,\" a song from his 1980 album Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School.\n\nIn May 2006, National Review ranked the song #4 on its list of the 50 greatest conservative rock songs.[45]\n\nIn July 2006, CMT ranked it as the #1 southern rock song.\n\nIn 2009, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[46]\n\nMuscle Shoals, Alabama\n\nThe Swampers\n\nUnited States portal"
