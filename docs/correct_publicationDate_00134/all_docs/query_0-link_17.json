        "text": "American science fiction writer (1928–2018)\n\nNot to be confused with Kati Wilhelm.\n\nKate Wilhelm (June 8, 1928 – March 8, 2018[1]) was an American author. She wrote novels and stories in the science fiction, mystery, and suspense genres, including the Hugo Award–winning Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang. Wilhelm established the Clarion Workshop along with her husband Damon Knight and writer Robin Scott Wilson.\n\nKatie Gertrude Meredith was born in Toledo, Ohio, daughter of Jesse and Ann Meredith. She graduated from high school in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked as a model, telephone operator, sales clerk, switchboard operator, and underwriter for an insurance company.\n\nShe married Joseph Wilhelm in 1947 and had two sons. The couple divorced in 1962 and Wilhelm married Damon Knight in 1963. She and her husband lived in Eugene, Oregon, until his death in 2002[2] and she remained there until her own death in 2018.[3]\n\nHer first published short fiction was \"The Pint-Size Genie\" in the October 1956 issue of Fantastic, edited by Paul W. Fairman (assisted by Cele Goldsmith, who was responsible for looking at unsolicited submissions to the magazine). The next year, her first accepted story, \"The Mile-Long Spaceship\", was published in John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction, and ten of her speculative fiction stories were published during 1958 and 1959.[4] Her debut novel was a murder mystery, More Bitter Than Death (Simon & Schuster, 1963), and her science fiction novel debut, The Clone (1965) by Wilhelm and Theodore L. Thomas, was a finalist for the annual Nebula Award.[4]\n\nHer work has been published in Quark/, Orbit, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Locus, Amazing Stories, Asimov's Science Fiction, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, Fantastic, Omni, Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, Redbook and Cosmopolitan.\n\nShe and her second husband, Damon Knight, mentored many authors and helped to establish the Clarion Writers Workshop and the Milford Writer's Workshop. After his death in 2002, Wilhelm continued to host monthly workshops, as well as lecturing at other events, until her death.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Wilhelm in 2003, its eighth class of two deceased and two living writers.[5]\n\nIn 2009, she received one of three inaugural Solstice Awards from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (founded by Knight in 1965), which recognize \"significant impact on the science fiction or fantasy landscape\".[6][7]\n\nThe Nebula Award trophy was designed for the first awards by J. A. Lawrence, based on a sketch by Wilhelm.[8]\n\nShe also won a few annual genre awards for particular works:[6]\n\nNebula Award for Best Short Story, 1968, \"The Planners\"[9]\n\nHugo Award for Best Novel and Locus Award for Best Novel, both 1977, Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang[6]\n\nNebula Award for Best Novelette, 1986, \"The Girl Who Fell into the Sky\"[9]\n\nNebula Award for Best Short Story, 1987, \"Forever Yours, Anna\"[9]\n\nHugo Award (best related book) and Locus Award (best nonfiction), both 2006, Storyteller: Writing Lessons and More from 27 Years of the Clarion Writers' Workshop (Small Beer Press, 2005; ISBN 0-7394-5613-X)[6]\n\nThe Hugo- and Locus Award-winning novel Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang was also a finalist for the Nebula Award, winner of the short-lived Jupiter Award from science fiction instructors, and third place for the academic John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[6]\n\nIn 2016, the SFWA renamed the Solstice Award the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award.[10]\n\nMain article: Kate Wilhelm bibliography\n\nHolloway is an attorney in Eugene, Oregon.
