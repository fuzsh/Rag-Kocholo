Their descendants would have everything they needed to raise food and do the scientific research\n\nnecessary for survival.\n\nBut the family was soon plagued by sterility, and the creation of clones offered the only answer. And that final pocket of human civilization lost the very human spirit it was meant to preserve as man and mannequin turned on one another!\n\nCondition: Good. Some spine creasing."
