        "text": "very disappointed!\n\nThis was my last Kate Wilham book to listen to. I'm glad I left it last instead of listening first. I have GREATLY enjoyed all of her books...except this one. Not my cup of tea. I have listened and enjoyed other dystopia themed books, The Hunger Game Series, Divergent, & The Host but not this one. It was depressing, I could not get a feel for anyone. I couldn't care for any of the characters and they could not care for themselves.\n\nNot my fave\n\nI'm not really a Sci-Fi fan but every now and then I sample a book or two just to see if I have changed or maybe Sci-Fi has.\n\nSince I have enjoyed many of Kate Wilhelm's books and absolutely adore Anna Fields' narration (and continue to mourn her loss) it seemed like this book had a better than average chance of being the Game Changer.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nMy apologies to Wilhelm and Fields\n\nTimeless Scifi\n\nA wonderful story of a dystopian world. No horror, no zombies, no violence. You certainly don't miss it in this unique tale. Even though it was written decades ago there isn't any content that dates it. It could have been written yesterday. A delight to listen to.\n\nHaunting science fiction at its best\n\nI never knew where this story was going. I’m pretty good at guessing what is about to happen next, but I was constantly surprised throughout the reading. This will certainly get a second listen in the next few years.\n\nStands the test of time\n\nOne of my favorite sci fi novels that stands the test of time and 3 re-reads over 3 decades. The story still feels original after all these years, which says something. I love science fiction but so much these days is super derivative or so bizarre (structure and/or storyline), that I can’t relate.\n\nHad to get used to the audio narrator (not my favorite) who gives a pretty straight reading, but once I did, I enjoyed the book on audio as much as reading it.\n\nWorth a listen.\n\nI loved the premise and really wanted to love the book, but while the bones were good, there just wasn't enough meat for a satisfying meal. I much prefer the \" Giver\", which covers the same themes, but gave me characters to care about. It isn't until the last third of this novel that there was anyone to really connect with and that was a weak connection.\n\nI generally do not comment negatively on a narrator, but having Ms. Fields' emotionless delivery only added to the overall feeling of wanting more.\n\nStill as I said in the headline, worth a listen.\n\nInteresting, but dated\n\nI had heard this was an excellent dystopian piece and that it was worth the time reading. I agree, mostly. I didn't find the character development as rich as I had hoped and that left me without strong feelings for any of the characters. And, if a reader doesn't feel a connection to some of the characters, it is hard to care about them or their plight. Still, I found the story interesting enough and I did finish it. Overall, I cannot recommend this as a great book, but it was still worth completing.\n\nunusual premise. I enjoyed it.\n\nunusual premise. I haven't come across it before. a very timely book. I enjoyed it.\n\nAn Original Take On A Possible Future\n\nNot much to say. I enjoyed it; an original take on a possible future.\n\nI’m not sure if the existence of clones feels as threatening now-a-days as it might have felt back when the book was written in the 70s, so perhaps it was more of a pager-turner then... nevertheless, I thought it was interesting."
