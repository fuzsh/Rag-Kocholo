        "text": "At first, I didn’t like this book. In fact, I thought I was going to hate it and steeled myself to slog through it. I thought, “Another author with an agenda.” But I was wrong.\n\nThe book starts off painting the typical dystopian future where man has destroyed the Earth and a small group of powerful people decide to create a way to survive. Like most good ideas, this one has a fatal flaw that, Frankenstein-like, rises up to destroy the very people who created it. But, unlike the monster, the new society lives on, despite its flawed birth. That is, until its inherent weaknesses are exposed by time and nature.\n\nThere are no shortage of books (or politicians) promoting socialism, globalism, and Gaia-based cultism as the only salvation of mankind. And that’s the way this book starts off. (It’s slow in the first few chapters, but I urge you to keep reading.) Eventually, in a natural reveal, we watch as the system breaks down because its foundations deny nature. The powerful emerge and perpetuate evil act after evil act, all while cloaked behind the flag of “for the good of the state.” The corruption that arises is predictable and inevitable. As is its eventual demise by the sword of individualism.\n\nIf you value individualism, freedom, and self-determination, you’ll find yourself shaking your head at yet another society ignoring history and making the same mistake - believing that the good of the many outweighs the choice of the few - as long as you’re part of the group who defines what is good and who are the many. I highly recommend this book."
