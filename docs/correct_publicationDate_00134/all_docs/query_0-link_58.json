Sweeping, dramatic, rich with humanity, and rigorous in its science, Where Later the Sweet Birds Sang is widely regarded as a high point of both humanistic and \"hard\" SF, and won SF's Hugo Award and Locus Award on its first publication. It is as compelling today as it was then.\n\nWhere Late the Sweet Birds Sang is the winner of the 1977 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied."
