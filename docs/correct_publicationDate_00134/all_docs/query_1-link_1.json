        "text": "January 5, 2023\n\nSF Masterworks #67 : What begins as a look at a family of entrepreneurs, scientists and doctors dealing with what looks like an unstoppable collapse of humanity, morphs into a quite an unsettling and eerie look at cloning and what generations of clones in a Homo Sapien-less world could become!\n\nMy first SF Masterworks' read by a women writer and what a scorcher; originally published in 1974, with some tremendously well thought out multi-faceted character led storytelling, Wilhelm really plays on the inhumanness of clones wonderfully... darkly! Another classic sci-fi read with an unsettling horror subtext. A very strong Four Star read, 8 out of 12.\n\n2019 read\n\nJanuary 16, 2015\n\nDavid Sumner has a problem: the world as he knows it is about to end. what's a brilliant young man and his equally brilliant family to do? why, bring back members of that extended family, store supplies, circle the wagons, and build a lab which will eventually help the Sumner family to repopulate the earth, of course. sounds like a good plan to me.\n\nthere's something about the 70s that I just really dig. many things, actually. besides the wonderfully hideous clothes and the wonderfully not-hideous moustaches and of course all of the brilliant movies, one of the things I like about that decade is the science fiction that came out of it. sci-fi that is confident mankind is headed for cataclysmic change any day now; sci-fi writers that came up with all sorts of ways that mankind can survive or transform or transcend or even just die. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is such a book. one of the very 70s things about this novel is its sweet but not saccharine attachment to nature... if you don't dig nature, you have a lot to learn man. there's a vagueness to that sentiment just as there is a vagueness to what exactly is causing the world to break down. and that vagueness is also pretty 70s. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is not the sort of novel that will spell things out for you. you either dig it or you don't dig it.\n\nMolly of the Miriam Sisters has a problem: she went on an expedition to see what could be found out there, and she came back changed. she doesn't see things the same way. she should probably try to change back; she's making her duplicate sisters uneasy and her community deals with unease in fairly drastic ways. but she doesn't want to change. she's not sure why she is drawing these disturbing images or why she finds such new comfort in nature, in being by herself. but she likes it. she likes being an individual.\n\nand that's another great thing about the 70s, in sci-fi and beyond: that interest in exploring the necessity of both individuality and community. Wilhelm does not paint this after-the-fall society in broad strokes so that the reader can easily hiss at it. there is a nurturing, loving vibe to this future community. people support their siblings automatically. sexuality is nonchalant. it is a community that cares for its citizens. well, in its own way. but of course in the end Wilhelm cherishes individuality and this community is shown to be deeply flawed. if this sounds like the novel may be some kind of didactic screed on individualism, well, it's not. Wilhelm is subtle. she is a lovely writer but she is also fine with making the reader a bit uncomfortable. Molly's \"descent\" into individuality is eerie and unnerving, haunting, as strange an experience for the reader as it is for this new and vaguely threatening Molly - no longer of the Miriam Sisters.\n\nMark has a problem: he is not like the lab-bred brothers & sisters, and they don't like that. the clones don't like this natural-born kid. but they need him, they need his skills, they need his bravery, they need his ability to understand nature and to be by himself. unfortunately, they don't actually know they need him and how badly they need individuals like him for their survival as a race. at one point Mark builds a snowman. the young clones don't understand it and they don't really see it - because it is a lone snowman, no lookalike snowmen surrounding it. so they pelt it with snowballs and tear down the monstrous lone thing.\n\nI love how this kid is portrayed as an arrogant little asshole who mercilessly pranks his clone relatives, blithely uncaring of the genuine harm they can and often expressly want to do to him. assholes make the best heroes for me because I can often see myself in them. I like their flaws, their humanity; heroic heroes are often quite tedious in the end. the 70s had no problem with asshole heroes. but although Mark is quite a jerk, he has something his family members don't understand outside of their clone groupings: empathy. jerks who are empathetic know how and where to hit the hardest. and so Mark hits the clones hard, right where it hurts.\n\ngreat novel! a classic.\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\n1977 Hugo winner for best novel.\n\nWe've got some serious competition out here for best dystopia, but what about the old SF classics that decided to do it first, and often better, than all the modern trash out here?\n\nSure, there's a seriously 70's vibe here, man, with all the deep concerns for community versus individuality, but it's not like we've really outgrown the issues. You can read the novel as a deep condemnation for conformity and group-think and the logical extremes of extroversion and as a reader identify with the introverted outcasts and their iconoclast talents, even if such things are considered, among most, as a euthanizable offence. Sound familiar, modern YA dystopia readers?\n\nWell this isn't a YA novel, either. It starts out as a pretty horrific descent into chaos as the world turns sterile and plagues decimate the population, but fortunately, for the deeply optimistic and appreciated optimism of SF of the day, science comes to the rescue... with Clones! Cool, right?\n\nJust think, an Army of Clones! I mean, it's such a classic idea, right? I mean, first Star Wars did it, and then everyone just... ooh... wait... I think I'm mixing up cause and effect here... Still, this novel isn't a war novel. If anything, it's a bit humorous watching a nature boy lead a bunch of cloned children through the forest to go on raids. Sure, the world has gone to hell, but Science Wins. I can't fault the optimism, and all of these characters are very well drawn.\n\nWe've taken free love into whole new territories, decided that art therapy can have seriously bad repercussions, and that individuals really out to be allowed to be, you know, individual. :) But I did find it just as fascinating to see how their society dealt with Extreme Communalism. :) Scary, too. The breeding farms were major-ick.\n\nI would have been killed as a kid as a nonfunctional unit. :) They'd have expressed sympathy and all, but it doesn't change the fact that I'd be pasteurized.\n\nThis may not be my favorite SF novel ever, mind you, but I really enjoyed it. It didn't decide to be very dark and wallow in all the things that modern dystopias pride themselves on... like complete and utter hopelessness. :)\n\nDefinitely a worthwhile read.\n\nJanuary 11, 2016\n\n(Edit to add: the review below contains what some may consider to be spoilers. But on the whole, I do not think that reading this review will spoil the enjoyment of the book for you.)\n\nScience fiction stories usually concern the impact of the progress of science on human beings. When the science part dominates, it is called “Hard SF”: when the human part dominates, it is “Soft SF”. However, this is not a rigid categorisation as most Hard SF stories (for example, Asimov’s Foundation series) contain some sociology, and most Soft SF cannot exist without some science. The most fascinating Soft SF stories deal with a society unalterably modified by science, and how human beings come to term with it.\n\nDid I just say “human beings”? Well, as far as Kate Wilhelm’s Hugo and Locus award-winning novel, Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is concerned, you can add the word “almost” – since most of the characters in this story are clones.\n\nThe Story\n\nThe novel is a dystopia: one that many science fiction writers seem to love – the whole world having gone to hell on a handcart. Wars, pollution and pestilence of Biblical proportions are slowly wiping out life on earth. To compound the problem, human beings and animals are becoming increasingly sterile. It seems that the world is doomed to extinction.\n\nThe filthy rich Sumner family, up in their farm on the Shenandoah Valley, have read the signs early and have found a solution. They will preserve an island of stability and sanity in a world gone volatile and mad in their mountain citadel – and led by the gifted Dr. Walt, Harry Vlasic and David Sumner, they develop the ultimate answer to sterility – cloning.\n\nSo far, so good. Only, they discover too late that clones are not humans in the true sense of the word. Much more single-minded and efficient than their originals, and sharing an extra-sensory empathy with one another, they soon take over… and the world seems ready for a new species. A society where individuality is unknown and any deviation from the group is frowned upon; where sex is a group activity and the production of children, other than the cloned ones, is by harvesting a handful of fertile women as “breeders”. It is the end of humankind as we know it.\n\nOr is it?\n\nOn a field trip to gather information and building materials (a perilous one that a few hardy individuals periodically make – it is literally a matter of life and death for any clone to be separated from the group for too long), Molly, the artist, is touched and permanently changed by nature. She can’t go back to the group existence any more: she has rediscovered humanity. Her art becomes steadily less utilitarian and more idiosyncratic, and she begins questioning group values. Of course, this striving for individuality is major deviant behaviour among the clones, so they isolate her in the old house, with its hoard of books. Unknown to them, she is carrying something else – the son of the doctor Ben in her womb.\n\nMolly and her son Mark enjoy an idyllic existence in the old house for five years until they are ultimately discovered. Mark is taken away to live in the communal nursery with other children, and Molly is assigned the role of a breeder, a baby – producing machine.\n\nBut once touched by nature, man cannot become a machine again. As the clone community declines because of lack of innovation, abhorrence of nature and the steadily dwindling resources from a dead world, Mark, the earth-child, provides the spark to ensure that humanity is born again.\n\n***\n\nThe novel is structured in three parts: the first part (and in my opinion, the weakest) showing the development of the society of the clones and their takeover, the second part detailing Molly’s “conversion” and the third, the renaissance of humanity through Mark. Even though it attempts to be nothing other than science fiction, the mythical overtones are hard to miss. David Sumner is the original savior prophet/ hero, who creates the chosen race and is ultimately sacrificed by them: Molly, the Mother of God/ Mother Goddess: and Mark, the persecuted God Child/ Hero/ Messiah of the new world.\n\nKate Wilhelm wrote this novel in the seventies, when the cold war was going strong. For Western Europeans and Americans, the Soviet Union was the Devil Incarnate and the ultimate dystopia, a place where human beings have lost all claims to individuality and function only as cogs in the machine, as epitomised by the communist bloc (we now understand that this was far removed from the truth). In those days, a communist takeover of the world was a real threat in the mind of the average American; the end of civilisation as we know it. Part of the success of this novel is that that particular paranoia is explored in detail, without being judgmental.\n\n“The Freedom of the Individual” is at the heart of the American secular religion, sometimes (in the opinion of citizens of other countries) carried to ridiculous extremes (one cannot imagine a philosophy like Ayn Rand’s meriting serious consideration anywhere else in the world). Collectivism of any kind is to be abhorred. So imagine the situation if the human race becomes collective, not through force, not through choice, but as an inherent feature of their biological make-up? That is what the author does, and her prediction on the fate of such a society is clear and unambiguous: death by atrophy of the spirit.\n\nThe passage reproduced below encapsulates the author’s philosophy in a nutshell.\n\n…He looked over the class, and continued. “Our goal is to remove the need for sexual reproduction. Then we will be able to plan our future. If we need road builders, we can clone fifty or a hundred for this purpose, train them from infancy, and send them out to fulfill their destiny. We can clone boat builders, sailors, send them out to the sea to locate the course of the fish our first explorers discovered in the Potomac. A hundred farmers, to relieve those who would prefer to be working over the test tubes than hoeing rows of carrots.”\n\nAnother ripple of laughter passed over the students. Barry smiled also; without exception they all worked their hours in the fields.\n\n“For the first time since mankind walked the face of the earth,” he said, “there will be no misfits.”\n\n“And no geniuses,” a voice said lazily, and he looked to the rear of the class to see Mark, still slouched down in his chair, his blue eyes bright, grinning slightly. Deliberately he winked at Barry, then closed both eyes again, and apparently returned to sleep.\n\nThe community where everybody is forced to work in the fields and children belong to the group and not to their parents seems like a parody of Chairman Mao’s China.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Mark saves the society because he is more in tune with nature than the clones who needs the presence of each other for sustenance and cannot survive alone. While stressing individuality, Ms. Wilhelm also seems to advocating the recognition of our umbilical tie to Mother Earth (Gaia, Bhumi, call her whatever you will). Presumably it was the separation which brought about the unnamed catastrophe at the beginning of the story – a scenario which eerily parallels the situation we find ourselves in today…\n\nJune 22, 2012\n\n\"She shook her head, her eyes fixed, staring at the nightmare scene before them. Who had done this? Why? It was as if the people had converged here to destroy this place that had failed them in the end so completely.\"\n\nThe scene that is described here was indeed nightmarish, as was a large portion of this story. Although there were a lot of dark scenes throughout, it did have some bright and uplifting scenes to redeem its eerie disposition. I was on a roller coaster of emotions while reading this - which is rare for me, not many stories can evoke such an array of feelings, as this did. The many different scenarios depicted page-after-page, were filled with fantastical ideas that held a deep-down plausible truth.\n\nI have read many books about robotics being used in extending the lives of individuals or prolonging the existence of mankind. However, in this 1977 Hugo and Locus Award winning novel by Kate Wilhelm, she shows humans living beyond their original due date, by way of cloning. Even though much has progressed in the science of cloning in the past 30 years, the ethical questions are still the same and the controversies may never change. I assumed the heated controversies on this topic started in the 90's, with the birth of Dolly, the cloned sheep, but actually it appears to have been a heavy subject way before that. These ethical issues were concerns in the 70's, made apparent by Kate's writings, and perhaps even began far sooner than we know.\n\nWhether or not you have a solid opinion on the cloning of humans, reading this book, will broaden your ideas on man's finite existence on earth, for it has mine.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI recently learned where Kate Wilhelm got the title of her novel. It was from a quotation of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 73.\n\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold,\n\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\n\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\n\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\n\nIn me thou seest the twilight of such day,\n\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west,\n\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\n\nDeath's second self, that seals up all in rest.\n\nIn me thou seest the glowing of such fire,\n\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\n\nAs the death-bed whereon it must expire,\n\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\n\nThis thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,\n\nTo love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\n\n–William Shakespeare\n\nAugust 17, 2018\n\nWell, that was....interesting.... Uneven pacing, klunky writing, and boring story without even a pseudo-scientific explanation or rationale for cloning leads to hive mind. And what felt like a rather hamfisted indictment of collectivism versus individualism. I felt like Wilhelm was saying that collectivism led to zombie people who had no capacity for kindness, imagination or creativity, while individualism was better because its followers were self-reliant, creative, and forward-thinking. (I wonder if Wilhelm was thinking of “the evils of communism” (imagine Guy Smiley-ish cartoonish figure intoning that) when writing this, as the Cold War was still going on...)\n\nI can’t really understand why this story was held so highly.\n\nSeptember 14, 2021\n\nBeyond clones and cloning and the end of civilization, at it's heart Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is a touching, melancholic story about what makes us individuals and why our differences and diversity are central not only to the evolution of humanity but also key to our survival. I wouldn't be surprised if this inspired Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, as they tackle numerous similar themes including the threat of global sterility and women losing control of their freedoms and reproductive rights.\n\nJanuary 12, 2019\n\nMost of the science in this novel is bad, but one important thing that the writer got right and presented properly is that cloning is the absolute last desperate move you can make to save a species. Just as one might expect, the story turns into a conflict between an individual and the community, with plenty of counter culture sprinkled all over (am I the only one who noticed some stylistic similarities with The Silent Spring).\n\nEven though bits of the story are predictable, I was taken in by the method and style the author used to tell it (probably because I am used to think of clones in a more cyberpunk setting). And this made it not the best read, but an enjoyable one.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\n“ … the trees are alive, and when you need them, they’ll talk to you.”\n\nThe Sumners of Shenandoah Valley were a family, triply blessed with enormous wealth, tremendous technical knowledge and abilities in a wide variety of scientific endeavours and, finally, the fortunate isolation that was needed to survive the holocaust level plagues and disasters that seemed bent on sending mankind to the graveyard of extinction.\n\nWHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG is not necessarily a cautionary tale but it certainly is an extended thought-provoking essay on the ethics and possible practical results of cloning human beings and its effect on human thinking and behaviour, reproduction, loss of genetic diversity, love and emotions, and eventually what a “human” thinks it means to be “human”. Differences between those bred by cloning and those bred by “normal” reproductive processes, multiply and magnify. As in John Wyndham’s THE CHRYSALIDS, ultimately these differences become impossibly and fatally non-negotiable. Something has to give.\n\nEntertaining, compelling stuff indeed. Highly recommended.\n\nPaul Weiss\n\nAugust 4, 2021\n\nI am baffled by the reputation this book enjoys. I found it to be a muddled, diffuse slog, and its central idea — that clones would not inherently be capable of any form of imagination or individuality — to be preposterous.\n\nAh well, on to more fulfilling books, I hope.\n\nAugust 27, 2017\n\nI should have read Kate Wilhelm’s stellar Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang years ago. I had it in the back of my mind as a seminal work, a must-read, for just short of forever, yet I never found myself actually diving in to that first page. Then I won a copy through the Goodreads Firstreads contest, and I knew my time with this speculative classic had finally come. I received my copy, became flush with excitement…and reverently shelved the book, as I didn’t have the time and energy to do justice to a story I’d been anticipating for so very long.\n\nFinally, the time was right, so I pulled the book from my shelves and was immediately charmed by the story’s warmth and humanity. The first few chapters perfectly set the stage for what is to come, introducing the central family at a time when things are mostly normal, a time before the world began to disintegrate and life took on a thousand forms of adversity and complexity. I liked this family, appreciated their strong loyalties and values. I wanted things to go well for them.\n\nBut things do not go well, or at least not as planned. Ecological, economic, and environmental turmoil ensues, and the process is wholly believable to a modern reader. Wilhelm was remarkably prescient in her writing, and the book feels neither dated nor far-fetched in its allusions to these societal troubles. She writes as a realist, neither heavy-handed nor preachy. Yet she is unflinching in authenticity, and I was fully convinced that her future is not only plausible, but at least partially probable. This apocalypse makes a bang for the world at large, but in the microcosm of the world of the central family, the effect is more akin to a whisper spreading out through the generations, impossible to ignore, until finally it is the only sound left.\n\nLest I spoil anything essential, I will only circle around the novel’s plot beyond what is plainly told on a dust jacket synopsis. Due to the aforementioned worldly catastrophes, fertility is drastically impaired – both for animals and humans. One large, extended family, blessed both with resources and the ingenuity of a number of brilliant and resourceful individuals, devises a long-long-term plan to both allow the family to survive and to provide for the clan in the future. The result is the single most insightful, well-rounded, and horrific exploration of the wider implications of cloning I’ve ever encountered, (Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go included) as well as a true-ringing exploration of one family's struggle in a post-apocalyptic world. Labeling these people \"tenacious\" only scratches the surface of their character. I kept hearing Robert A. Heinlein in my head, chanting a litany: \"Specialization is for insects.\" Indeed, specialization is what initially allows the family to survive, through their polymathic panoply of diversely-skilled members. But over time, an almost insect-like efficiency and homogeneity prevails and affords the family the strengths it needs to thrive. (Of course, as things tend to be cyclic in nature, what goes around comes around again...)\n\nThe book is organized into sections focusing on successive generations of the family, and each is at once more alien and more familiar than the last. Wilhelm is adept at engendering empathy in the reader, coaxing you to understand the motives and choices the family must employ, even when those paths seem unthinkable or distasteful. Whatever gets to you on a personal level - a young man struggling with unrequited or lost love, a young woman determined to be independent even at the expense of her heart, a father figure making hard decisions for his family, a woman wanting something better for her child, a boy striving to fit in yet be different, a woman afforded no rights, a scientist desperately seeking solutions, an artist seeing the world differently, a youth determined to make his own path in the world...selfish, selfless, self-sacrificing, self-centered - they're all here, and more. In fact, nearly every conceivable facet of \"the self\" can be found in the whole of the entity of \"the family\", filtered through thematic lenses of adaptation vs stagnation, conformity vs self-determination, tradition vs innovation. This is social/anthropological/archetypal science fiction at its absolute best, exploring with unclouded eyes the ability of humanity to endure through adaptation, through re-inventing itself as something new as many times as necessary, to discover, re-discover, and explore territory both new and old, and to finally emerge from its chrysalis reborn, yet perhaps even more fully human than ever.\n\nI feel Kate Wilhelm has created an absolute classic of speculative literature which is tragically under-exposed. I was enormously enriched by this reading experience, and I know I will revisit this title again and again over the years, now that its seed has been sown in me. (In fact, it took me many weeks after reading to be able to fully express my thoughts, as well as to gain enough distance for an even marginally-objective review.) I enthusiastically recommend Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang to all fans of intelligent fiction.\n\nJanuary 30, 2015\n\nI had read this before, but so long ago (early teens?) that I couldn't really remember it. I've liked other stories by Wilhelm, so decided to re-read. Starts off with a nicely promising apocalypse, but quickly becomes a story of oh-no-the-clones! They're not Human!\n\nThe (very thin) scientific premise is that individuality must be developed at an early age, and if a group of clones grows and develops together, they will fail to develop individuality (and associated traits like creativity, imagination, the ability to fall in love, the possibility of genius, etc). The clones think they are awesome and aim to create a safe, communal society. Only a couple of people see the deadly trap the remnants of humanity are falling into.\n\nNot only is there no logical reason that clones would develop the traits that Wilhelm gives them, the book's message about the importance of creativity and individuality seems like a straw man argument. Would anyone seriously argue that the ability to innovate is NOT important? Maybe there's a bit of a cold-war era residual paranoia about communism that contributed to this; I'm not sure.\n\nThe \"happy\" ending of the book is also problematic. OK, the one 'individual' man kidnaps a harem of fertile women and sets out to repopulate the earth with hardworking innovators. Hmm. Are we concerned about genetic diversity, anyone? The numbers of individuals required for a viable population? Nah, everything'll be fine. (I'm fairly certain that people did know about the problems associated with extreme inbreeding even in 1976.)\n\nI have to admit that I still found the book enjoyable - I just like this sort of apocalyptic novel. But it's definitely flawed.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 28, 2017\n\nEn su promoción se habla de La estación del crepúsculo como la mejor novela sobre clones y este tema por sí solo me da un poco lo mismo. Sí me deja sin palabras cómo Wilhelm entremezcla este contenido con la literatura apocalíptica y la distópica para tejer una historia que bebe de todas y cada una de esas temáticas, saca partido a cada vertiente sin terminar de decantarse por ninguna y logra una personalidad singular.\n\nLa descripción de la sociedad de clones que nace con el colapso de la civilización es tan brillante como su evolución. Lo mismo cabe decir del retrato de los personajes alienados del grupo, los protagonistas sobre los que se focaliza el relato y, tristemente, padecen el yugo de una organización cada vez más alejada de sus comienzos. Hay detalles detrás de la parte conceptual que me han costado más asumir, caso de la maniquea confrontación entre humanos y clones sustentada en la imposibilidad de estos últimos de apreciar ciertas cualidades, digamos, más interiores y subjetivas. Obcecados en la eficiencia y en factores objetivos, entre insensibles e incapaces de sentir la más mínima empatía por sus antecesores. Parecen primos hermanos de aquellos cucos aterrizados en Midwich 20 años antes. Pero una vez aceptado esto, el resto entra solo.\n\nWilhelm se entrega a una narración que, a pesar de las elipsis y de un ritmo vertiginoso, sabe detenerse en las escenas adecuadas, sugiere tanto como muestra y culmina con un clímax intachable. Si no es el premio Hugo más injustamente olvidado en España, poco le falta. Y eso que su última reedición tiene menos de una década.\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nI don’t write reviews.\n\nI went into this with no knowledge or expectation. The best way. This was a good book. It contained a lot of ideas and Kate sketched them out in an interesting way. A nice days entertainment.\n\nI gave it three stars because every time I got into a character the time jumped forward and we moved on in the timeline. I understand the reason why she did this. Kate wanted to tell a bigger story of change. I can dig it, but I’m a sucker full of questions of the kind that three year olds ask their parents. Why? How? Tell me!!!\n\nBut I liked it. A nice find from a time and genre I thought I knew so well. My husband the bookman actually didn’t know this one either.\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nSometimes books transcend their accolades. Where Late The Sweet Birds Sang is one of those. A cheap used paperback came into my bookshelves, and bloody hell, this one swept me away. Finely melancholic without turning purple-prosed. Haunting, yes. Bittersweet, even more so. A wonderful novel about post-apocalyptic identity, a novel about human/clone ostracization, darkly future-forward.\n\nTold in three sections, the focus never leaves the clinic inside this valley of Virginia. Of course the world has ended: atmospheric maladies, infertility, and even perhaps, some good old-fashioned bomb-dropping. Wilhelm chooses not to focus on the causes of 'The End', but how the human race reinvents itself to maintain some resemblance of integrity...and survival for the long-term. The first section focuses on David, entirely human, who helps build the facility to start the cloning business. This part is the strongest of the three -- a deeply haunting scenario of man vs. his creation, but not what a reader would think - the black sheep syndrome in full exposure. Section 2 focuses on Molly, a 1st-gen clone who relishes in her artistic individuality, only to be shunned by the group and their collective hive-mind. Section three focuses on birthed-clone, Mark, and while this feels cut from the cloth of a YA novel at times, it is something to behold as the relationship between a doctor, Ben, and Mark himself shows the weight of an emotional conundrum. The thing is, while haunting and brooding, Wilhelm doesn't relish 'the villain', the 'westworld' clone intent on destruction. Wilhelm is more concerned with co-existence and intent, yes, more than human. That is what propels this elegant novel from those sepia-toned 1970s. It poses the big questions and lets you figure them out in this moral play, a science fiction wonder. Magnificent.\n\nJanuary 28, 2015\n\nWell, I definitely expected to like this book more than I did. Almost everyone I know who has read it has rated it very highly. I take a few issues with it:\n\n1. Half the book is more of a summary, and the book is just plain too short for the story it is trying to tell. It reminded me of A Canticle for Leibowitz in that way, told in three parts, from an author whose greater strength, arguably, is in the short story. Wilhelm is well known for her decades of contributions to Orbit (see recent anthology of her work in that magazine in Kate Wilhelm in Orbit, Volume One.) Either it should have been broken into separate books to really give the author time to tell the full story of each part, or she should have given us less of the backstory - a true summary, no characters. In the end, why do we care which family owned the land? They didn't end up mattering one bit, other than the fact that they provide the genetic code for the future society.\n\n2. Breeders. Every book that demotes women to baby factories as a \"solution\" for our \"future society\" is never going to win with me. The men get to decide what happens, and the women have the children. It is frustrating coming from a female writer in particular, I don't care that this was written in the 1970s. She is talking about clones! Why can't they just be in the test tube so women can have another role?\n\n3. The book is a framework to allow Wilhelm to spout her ideas of adaptability and creative thinking (my terms are taken from this Guardian review which also explores why we like post-apocalyptic literature so much.) I don't disagree with these ideas but I prefer story over message. The Cory Doctorow novels that do this same thing bother me in the same way (Pirate Cinema just being one example, although not all Doctorow suffers from this, to be clear.)\n\n4. I also found the survival tactics to be a bit unbelievable, relying on outside food sources and recon missions for multiple decades? When the major cities have burned or been hit with something radioactive? Perhaps the after-effects of radiation were not fully known in the 1970s but there would have been mega contamination issues. At least they were traveling in the water and not on roads. She seemed more interested in the nuclear winter concept, focusing on dropping temperatures and ice fields. Actually, this was a popular future-disaster trope in the 1970s and I almost could have used far more of it rather than the focus on the clones and the incest.\n\n5. The audiobook itself may have taken this book one notch. The narrator is female while most of the points-of-view in the book are male. So most of the time she is trying to do male voices and not really pulling it off. I would have picked someone else to fit the feel of the book better.\n\nJune 4, 2022\n\nAside from those shitty Star Wars movies, clones don't seem to be a popular trope in sci-fi, at least in my readings in the genre. It's a fascinating topic once you move behind sheep and boring internal organs and really get into the nitty-gritty of what a clone society-by-necessity might look like. That's the meat of Sweet Birds: ecological and political crises basically eradicate fertility and humanity, so the extended family of a scientist living in the mountains of western Virginia (where I happened to happily grow up; not a clone, people!) shut themselves off from the disaster and start cloning themselves to survive. Cool idea, but what's even cooler is that Wilhelm digs deep into the idea, exploring what a clone society might look like after a few generations (group sex among clone clusters!) and what happens to the unlucky fucks who might actually be individual. The exploration of the theme is largely psychological exploring what it would mean to have no real individual personality of your own, and how outsiders who do would negotiate having to live in a clone society.\n\nIt's a fine read, with little intrusive judgments and what-not, and plays out in some unexpected ways keeping predictability at bay.\n\nAugust 27, 2021\n\nThis was the Hugo Award winner of 1977 and a book I first read back in the 80s--and my recommendation for a book for my science fiction book discussion group. And that was for last April and we had a pandemic and never had the discussion. I reread the book (actually re-reread it) and think it would have made for a good discussion! The world is undergoing environmental collapse but a wealthy family--the Sumners--have a plan for survival. They set up a scientific research center in a remote valley near the Shenandoah River in Virginia. And they clone themselves. However, there seems to be a problem with the clones. The lookalikes stick together and it looks like the clones are forming their own society to replace that of the \"normal\" people. There seems to be some humanity missing from the humans of the future.\n\nAlthough some reviewers may find holes in the story and not care much for the science fiction in the story, I like Kate Wilhelm's prose and the epic quality of the story (and for such an epic, the story seems short and a fast read). It's an exploration of what it means to be human. 4/5 stars ( 5 if the story had been more developed)\n\nMay 5, 2020\n\n3.5 stars rounded up, because I'm always glad when I read one of the classics and really like it (not fair, I know, but most of the time my enthusiasm for SF books from the 70ies and earlier is a bit, well … dated)\n\nKate Wilhelm presents an interesting thought experiment about an post-apocalypse humanity where individualism is opposed to a group collective where everybody has to play their roles for the greater good of the whole community.\n\nIt is also a quite eerie clone story. I haven't read many of those so far, so perhaps she just falls in line with all the other clone stories here, but for me her scenario was very convincing and thoughtprovoking. She doesn't make a clear statement as to right or wrong, good or bad, but describes in a rather unemotionally way the crash of those two concepts.\n\nAs with other books I've read of her the standout feature of her writing is the psychological character driven approach which speaks very much to me. The what and why of the apocalypse doesn't play any role and the explanation thereof wasn't missed by me.\n\nDecember 25, 2018\n\nThis book starts with an environmental apocalypse. Due to radiation and other environmental issues, humanity and animals are becoming infertile and crop failures are causing famines. The rest of the book is about how a group of survivors try to ensure humanity’s survival, and the consequences of their chosen method. Since this book is so short I hate to give away many details and spoil the discovery of reading it for oneself, but I’ll put a more tangible explanation of what the book is about within the spoiler tags. Cloning, not just of livestock but also of humans. The idea is that, after a certain number of clones, fertility will start to increase again to the point that natural births will be a viable lifestyle again. However, the clones see their reproductive method as an improvement and have different ideas, and there are a lot more of them than there are of the original humans.\n\nI liked the story, but I also grew restless with it pretty often and I took more breaks from reading than I typically do. It isn’t slow-paced, though; it covers a lot of ground in a short, 250-page book. I wouldn’t have minded a little more detail, but I think we were told enough to convey the important parts of the story. The author uses the third-person omniscient perspective, especially in the second and third parts of the book. That’s the only type of perspective that really bothers me when I encounter it, although I did eventually adjust to it. It did simplify things a bit to know what everybody was thinking at the moment it was relevant. I expect it wouldn’t bother me as much if I encountered it more often because I would be more used to it, but it just feels wrong to me to hop heads so frequently even when it’s perfectly clear whose head I’m in.\n\nThis book was published in 1976 and it had a very 60ish “free love” type of feel to it. Nothing is described graphically or in any detail except maybe in one spot, but there are many casual mentions of everybody having sex with everybody, usually in groups. It fits fairly well into the story and the society portrayed, but might be off-putting to some.\n\nI’m not very strong in the natural sciences, but the science presented in this book felt a little hand-wavey to me. I was skeptical as to how realistic it was even for the time when it was published, but I was mostly able to just accept it as a vehicle for the author’s story. I did occasionally get pulled out of the story by some of the psychological aspects that seemed a little too extreme to be realistic.\n\nThere are some interesting ideas here, and the story is told well. If I were being more objective I would probably give this 3.5 stars, but my subjective enjoyment level stayed around 3 stars and that’s what takes priority for me when I rate a book.\n\nMarch 3, 2016\n\nI rarely give out 5 stars, but when a book is this moving and enthralling it deserves it!\n\nThis book is disaster, science fiction, dystopian - and also an expose of what it means to be human.\n\nWhat if man was not just a social animal, but part of society closer to what bees and ants have? What would happen? Would we still be human?\n\nThat's what this book sets forth. There is some disaster that one highly educated family sees coming and tries to hedge their bets with cloning. It explores this with 3 interlinked parts, novellas really. They are interlinked, yet they are their own stories.\n\nBut this is more than just pure science fiction. It is more a character study of three disparate but similar characters. There is David who lives through the end of civilization (as he knows it) and helps start a new one (without realizing it) and learns to regret it. There is Molly of the new civilization who is forced out and ends up being a catalyst for change. And there is Mark who sees the dangers and finds away to save mankind.\n\nA wonderful book, even if you're not a sci-fi fan.\n\nThere were some items to note. (Don't go farther for spoilers.)\n\n-- how does one family create a healthy group of people? wouldn't you need to go outside for fresh DNA?\n\n-- I loved the idea of the hive mind. At times cruel and insensitive. You wondered if because of this there could be no crime, no war, no violence.\n\n-- In the end, the deterioration of the clones, the lack of initiative, the voices they hear in the trees... very affecting.\n\nJuly 28, 2010\n\nWhen I dug out my grotty old paperback of this book, I checked the publication date out of curiosity. It is a 1981 edition that I clearly bought second hand. So I'd guess I bought it in the late '80s when I was in my late teens. That feels right with my vague memory of first reading it and means it is now well over 20 years since I read Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang. That long ago read had left me with a good feeling about the book, but I had no idea how it would hold up all these years later. Considering it was already around 10 years old in my hypothetical \"late '80s\" (it won the Hugo Award in 1977) it can certainly now be classed as an old book and maybe even a classic. It was republished as part of the \"SF Masterworks\" series in 2006 (with the nice cover shown above and not the horrible one I have) so there are clearly people out there who do consider it a classic.\n\nIn terms of the book \"holding up\", I had two main reactions. A yes and a maybe.\n\nI think the scientific premise stands up very well. In fact the end of the world as it comes to David and his family could be an eerily close future. It is a world of pollution, climate change and declining population where humanity's science can't keep up with what we have done to our planet. The solution the family reaches - to clone themselves - has been a science fiction staple for a while now, but I suspect was much newer in 1976 when the book was first published. It is, in fact, disturbingly much more possible now that it was then, making Wilhelm's vision of what such a drastic step might do to our cloned descendants still very timely all these years later.\n\nAs for the maybe, that concerns the writing style. This book is very much a \"tell\" book, rather than a \"show\" book. I can't truly say if this is a product of when it was written and published - too many years and other books have gone by, not to mention brain cells, for me to remember. However, I have my doubts that it would be published today in this form for just that reason. It's an older style of story-telling now and with demands for a first paragraph \"hook\" and lots of \"show\" from modern writers, Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang may well have a style that would not resonate with modern readers.\n\nDid it work for me? Yes, it did. Whether that is because the style still works (well, of course it does if it tells the story well) and stands on its own, or because I read it with the awareness I was rereading an older book, I really can't say. But hey, I enjoyed reading it and surely that what counts? All the same, for all that it is about people, their personalities, individuality (or loss of same) and psychology, it is an idea book more than it is a character book.\n\nConsidering that, Wilhelm does an excellent job of making you care for the characters as, twice over in quite different societies, we watch people forced to stand back as their youngers take over their place in the community and wonder if things will be better or worse in the new future.\n\nI liked David a lot. I'm not sure why, as in many ways there isn't all that much too him, but I remember I did last time and I did now as well. He starts out young, disbelieving and a little idealistic, but faced with the coming catastrophe, embraces the only solution they have found to save themselves and make a future. All the same, he and the other \"elders\" clearly see cloning as a short term solution that needs to be replaced by sexual reproduction as soon as fertility returns. It is the clones themselves, really not the same as their progenitors, who change the plan. And David is forced to stand aside to let what he sees as a dangerous future fall into place without him and those like him.\n\nI don't know if it is a fault in the writing or a deliberate choice of the writer, but on the whole the clones themselves, both in the early generations and later in part 2, have very little personality and none of them really stand out. It seems to me that the only one who truly has character in the book is Barry. All the other main characters, David, Molly, Ben and Mark, have their own personalities and individuality. It is Barry who remains part of his brother-group, who feels right that way, but still can stand back and see the bigger picture.\n\nFor all I liked David and Mark, on this reading it was Barry who impressed me most. It is Barry who can see that the community is failing, that with the successive generations the clones are losing creativity and that without inspiration to solve an unexpected problem, failure is the only possible result. The next generation, led by Andrew and his brothers, can still see this, but see no reason to do anything about it. Their solution will inevitably lead to the end of the community, but this does not seem to concern them unduely.\n\nBarry cannot do anything to change things himself and like David however many generations before (I do wish there was some idea of how much time has passed between part 1 and part 2), he must stand aside as the future forges on, however disastrously, just as David was forced to do.\n\nBut what saves the community is Mark. Strange, single, individual Mark, who is still creative, inspired and ingenious. And Barry has enough wisdom to stand back and let Mark do what he can’t do himself.\n\nI didn't remember the bit of psychological theory thrown into the mix that suggests there is an optimum age for individual ego to develop, that in the clone groups it is swamped by the brother or sister group and never occurs. But Mark is still with Molly at that age and has no clone brothers, so in him that development does occur, no matter how many generations it is since the original catastrophe. It's an interesting idea. I have no idea if it makes sense in terms of modern psychological theory, but it certainly works for the book.\n\nI ended up taking away two main things from Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang. Okay, on reflection, make that three.\n\nFirst and most clearly, the book is an ode to individuality. It is that individuality and inspiration that lets David and the others find a solution to ensure survival, one that that they consider must be only temporary. But as the clones form their own small collectives, they wish to maintain that and go to whatever ends to see that happen. As they lose their individuality to conformity, all those things that allowed humanity to reach the heights it did begin to be lost. It is only with the rediscovery of individuality in first Molly (and a little in Ben) and later in Mark, that humanity has a chance to escape a second possibility of extinction.\n\nBut it is also about the lengths we will go to in order to maintain our own kind, and for the purpose of this book the clones are a totally different type of \"own kind\" from humanity such as we are out here in the real world as represented by David and later by Mark. David's generation saw the cloning as a necessity to survival - but they weren't setting out to make a new kind of human (as they in fact did). They were, as they saw it, creating a stop-gap measure that would allow \"real people\" (for lack of a better term) to re-emerge on the other side.\n\nOn the other hand, the clones wanted their kind of people and community to survive. And as they begin to face their extinction in the latter part of the book, they too will go to great lengths to maintain their own kind. The problem is that \"their kind\" is a dead end - they have lost too much of what it takes to survive and it is only going to get worse. Andrew and the others' solution doesn't seem very practical to me and would probably only hold off the inevitable a bit longer (something that the epilogue seems to endorse). But, unlike David and Walt and their colleagues, the clones lack the ingenuity or ability to risk or “something” that David and the others did have, to try a different way. They choose to maintain their way and in the end they lose.\n\nAnd a smaller third thing, that struck me as I reached the last few chapters was that perhaps, survival is enough. Barry objects to Mark's plan because he sees all the things that will be lost. They will have to be so focused on survival that the \"higher learning\" things the Valley community has struggled so hard to maintain and gone out foraging for will get forgotten. Perhaps they will indeed, but surely as Mark sees, our very survival is the most important thing. Once you have that, you can start rebuilding those other things, but if you are so determined to keep the electricity and the technology and such without the proper infrastructure to maintain it, then you'll fall. And in the end, that is what happens to the clones, while the reader is left with the feeling Mark and his group will thrive - slowly perhaps, but surely.\n\nHmmm, after having written all this, I find that if I go back to the original question of how the book holds up, I have to say very well. Clearly it has made me think and reflect, and that's what good science fiction should do. Many books these days tell a story and little more - and there's nothing wrong with that - but the classics are the ones that stick with us and have something more to them. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang surely fits into the latter category and I hope it is still being read well into the future.\n\nOn a simpler note, I've also always felt that it has such a perfect last line. It sums up what much of the whole book and its dominant theme of individuality is all about. And it reads beautifully too.\n\n\"Because all the children were different.\"\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 19, 2017\n\nEste livro fala-nos de um mundo pós-apocalíptico. Depois de destruida a espécie humana, subsistem apenas os clones humanos.\n\nA visão da autora é muito interessante. Mostra-nos uma civilização formatada, com relações de dependência em relação aos outros clones, mas uma dependência meramente física, uma dependência tão básica como o respirar. Os laços de afeto são inexistentes e a promiscuidade sexual é parte do seu quotidiano.\n\nEstes clones não dispõem de sentido de orientação que lhes permita andar pelo mundo e são desprovidos de criatividade.\n\nÉ uma visão alternativa mas interessante sobre aquilo que, quem sabe, um dia poderá ser a realidade de um planeta imensamente fustigado pela poluição e destruição provocada pelo Homem.\n\nMarch 19, 2019\n\nThis book starts in a direction I hadn't anticipated, as it's heralded as one of the first scifi works to deal with the ethics of human cloning ... and won a Hugo, it starts with a full dose of incest rage. Not just incest but how we should feel the frustration of our main character as he learns he can in fact not mate with his beautiful beloved first cousin.\n\nThe setup for the background of the story, the slow environmental and biological collapse of the modern world, felt a little off so far as timeline goes, at least compared to modern apocalypse stories. I won't go into an in depth analysis, as others have done that already, and to be honest I skipped the sections that were too focused on HOW they were doing what they were doing because \"movie science\" always manages to make me angry, but the middle of the story really gets to why it won a Hugo. The character building as well as the plot left a lot of room for the wide range of ethical questions this book is known for, from the obvious ethics of cloning, to community rights versus that of the individual and the notion of individual identities as a whole, not to mention challenging conventional ideas around sexuality (I'm assuming this part was deeply influenced by the 60's and 70's). These topics were presented in a way I hadn't really read previously, which obviously added to the enjoyment.\n\nAll of this being said I had some major disappointments as well, not just with the somewhat impossible start, or the extremely frustrating ending, but a central point to the plot. This lead to the lowing of the overall star rating. I would recommend this only because it is historical significance to the genre .... and it's an incredibly quick read.\n\nAnd now.. spoilers: I don't understand why a central theme to the end of the world is the need for males to repopulate it. Reducing any surviving, and non-sterile, women into living incubators forced to produce litter after litter, risking their life with each birth. Also, Eeeeeewwww on the ending. I had hoped Mark would find his mother and continue on with survivors elsewhere, but the kidnapping of fertile women, to final conclusion of the story, resulting in his relationship with what I assume based on age is his granddaughter, it left me feeling like they left a bad situation for potentially a worse one. Though the breeder's breakout was something I hoped to happen, they didn't really get much of a change in their way of life as they are still considered a resource above their identity as a human. Since it was spelled out to Mark upon his escape that none of the clone children he took are fertile, I assume incest was once again the name of the game. I also felt like he became that which had frustrated him so greatly, using the clones he stole as worker bees to help set up the life he wanted with his own stolen harem.\n\nApril 25, 2015\n\nA Post-Apocalyptic story about an isolated group of clones in their Appalachian hideout, their history and future.\n\nThe story itself wasn't that great - simple, predictable, diffuse. Only the ending was emotionally adequate.\n\nMain strengths were the nature centric, poetical language which you don't find very often in SF. Sometimes, it read like a description from Colonial North America with native Americans fishing and talking to the trees. Rivers flooding on dam bursts, nature growing as humanity retreats, vast empty landscapes, ruined cities. You'll find poetry everywhere in this novel, starting from the title which cites Shakespeare's Sonnet 73, starting with\n\n\"That time of year thou mayst in me behold,\n\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\n\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\n\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\"\n\nThe other part's titles are also citations which fits the general poetic hayfield feeling very well:\n\nSecond part's title \"Shenandoah\" refers to the Virginian river, covered by several poems, e.g. one from Carl Sandberg. Third part's title \"At the Still Point\" is taken from T.S. Eliot's poem https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5827...\n\nAnother strength was the juxtaposition of normal humans and the clone society. The latter one being nearly as pack-minded as the Tines in A Fire Upon the Deep. This contrast remembered me a lot of the newer Beggars in Spain with its new generation of sleepless kids opposing human society.\n\nCloning is one of the central themes of SF: Bokanovsky's process in Brave New World comes to mind. But there are other contestants as well: Nine Lives is a story from Ursula LeGuin which seems to be the basis for Kate Wilhelm's novel. Novelette \"Mary\" in The Best of Damon Knight or Cloned Lives (note that she is Knight's third wife), only to name a few. In addition, there is the multiple-award winning Cyteen spinning around one clone protagonist.\n\nWilhelm published an eponymous novel on cloning in 1965 with Ted Thomas - The Clone - I didn't read that one, though. It was nominated for the Nebula Award but lost to Dune.\n\nIf you're hunting for literary references on cloning, I'd suggest I Am the Other: Literary Negotiations of Human Cloning - don't know if that one is really good, though.\n\nThe novel isn't good at scientific aspect - wherever you dive into scientific motivations, you'll find large holes: cloning and several other predictions like energy production isn't rooted in science at all. It is more the humanistic aspect, the philosophical musings embedded in beautiful descriptions making this work worth reading. In the end, I didn't find the predictions and philosophical questions convincing: The group consciousness is introduced without motivation or understanding, and I don't believe that creativity is linked to individuality, but alone the dispute was very worthwhile.\n\nIt won the Nebula Award in 1976 and the next year's Hugo Award, it is included in several lists as \"must-read\" SF. I don't think that it is an outstanding work of literature, but I enjoyed it and recommend it.\n\nApril 3, 2016\n\nThis novel is, I suppose, a dystopia. And if one thinks about it loosely, one may be reminded of a handful of similar-seeming ones, like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, Lois Lowry's The Giver, or any number of other novels in which the rigid and law-bound community controls and destroys the notion of the creative individual. But those similarities are largely cosmetic, I think. Dig a little deeper, and this becomes a novel about the stages humanity will go through, at the edge of the precipice, in order to survive. This is a story of several generations of people struggling with choices as humanity almost dies off, tries to save itself, digs itself into a deep and very nasty hole, and then, finally, almost despite itself, crawls out the other side. It is a warning against our attitudes toward technology, efficiency and control, and a call for a return to the natural world, spontaneity, acceptance, and human instinct. It is an exploration of how much loneliness and isolation humans are willing to suffer in order to maintain their drive, ambition, and curiosity. What is more important, a sense of belonging or a sense of progress? The book suggests very convincing reasons why we can't have both. The issues evoked are thought-provoking, even if, ultimately, it is clear which side the novel falls on. But what is most welcome here is that the story is told mostly in honest moments of discord between people who all mean well. Everyone wants humanity to survive. There are no bad guys here - only bad decisions. The novel treats everyone as if their motivations are honest, even if they are clearly wrong.\n\nIt is amazing how much this novel accomplishes in so few pages. The book was also stranger than I expected. The clones, when we first meet them, are so off-putting, so smug, so dead inside, that they are horrifying. There is an unexplained whispering in the trees, like in the tv show Lost. There is artwork that makes everyone who contemplates it mysteriously uncomfortable, and they can't explain why. There are women kept as breeders in pens, and given drugs to keep them happy. Main characters disappear from the book half-way through, never to be seen again, and their absence haunts the remaining pages. But there are also moments of joy, and moments of communion with nature. The book is eerie, but also lovely. It is dark, but also full of hope. The tone, this particular combination of effects, was captivating.\n\nI just read C. J. Cherryh's Cyteen earlier in the summer, and now I feel I have read two great texts on the subject of cloning. They come from very different places, but both have much to say about the human conundrum, and the choices we face when we decide what sort of civilization, full of what sort of people, we intend to leave to our children."
