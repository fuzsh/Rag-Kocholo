        "text": "DETROIT, March 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Huron Capital Partners LLC (\"Huron Capital\"), a prominent lower middle-market private equity firm, announced today that it has acquired ACE Asphalt of Arizona, Inc. (\"Ace\") with plans to merge the company with its infrastructure services platform Sunland Asphalt & Construction, Inc. (\"Sunland\"), a leading asphalt producer and paving solutions provider based in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nFounded in 1966, Phoenix-based Ace provides parking lot maintenance & repair and comprehensive site development services for paved and concrete surfaces in five southwestern states: Arizona, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\n\n\"The entire Ace team is proud of the growth we have achieved over the past several years,\" said Scott Phillips, President of Ace, who will remain with the combined company as President of the Western Division. \"We are excited to continue that growth by joining forces with Sunland and creating what we believe to be one of the market leaders in our region.\"\n\nThe combination of the two companies provides greater market stability and expands Sunland's presence into two new states – Texas and Oklahoma. The management team of the combined company will draw on the strength and proven capabilities of executives from both companies.\n\nDoug DeClusin, CEO of Sunland, will continue to serve as CEO and lead the integration of the two companies as they come together under the Sunland brand.\n\n\"We have always had tremendous respect for Ace's team and the company's capabilities,\" DeClusin said. \"This merger provides both companies with an exciting opportunity to diversify our markets and expand our services to a wide array of public and private customers. The combination of our infrastructure and services will prepare us to offer the most powerful and comprehensive suite of solutions available.\"\n\nThe merger of Sunland and Ace also paves the way for the combined company to offer a greater range of services. New and existing customers will benefit from Ace's slurry-sealing capabilities and Sunland's chip-sealing expertise, as well as both companies' state-of-the art equipment and similar service-oriented cultures.\n\n\"Given its fragmentation and strong secular tailwinds, infrastructure services is an area we've been targeting for several years. We made our initial platform investment in Sunland earlier this year and could not be more pleased with the quick completion of this first acquisition,\" said Huron Capital Managing Partner Jim Mahoney. \"We are delighted to partner with Doug, Scott and their respective teams to build on the established momentum of both Sunland and Ace and leverage the market and financial strength of the combined companies going forward.\"\n\nAbout Huron Capital\n\nFounded in Detroit in 1999, Huron Capital is an operationally focused private equity platform with a long history of growing lower middle-market companies through our proprietary ExecFactor® buy-and-build investment model.
