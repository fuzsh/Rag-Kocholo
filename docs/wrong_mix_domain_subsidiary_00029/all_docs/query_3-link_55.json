Any other type of flip chip LED is applicable to the present invention.\n\nMetal electrodes 14 are formed on the LED 10 that electrically contact the p-layer, and metal electrodes 16 are formed on the LED 10 that electrically contact the n-layer.\n\nthe electrodes are gold bumps that are ultrasonically welded to anode and cathode metal pads 18 and 20 on a ceramic submount wafer 22 .\n\nthe submount wafer 22 has conductive vias 24 leading to bottom metal pads 26 and 28 for bonding to a printed circuit board. Many LEDs are mounted on the submount wafer 22 and will be later singulated to form individual LEDs/submounts.\n\nthe underfill material 30 is then injected under and around the LED 10 to fill in air gaps between the LED 10 and submount wafer 22 .\n\nthe underfill material 30 is typically liquid epoxy that is then cured to harden.\n\nthe hardened underfill provides structural support and protects the chip from contaminants.\n\nthe underfill material 30 is injected by a nozzle 32 that is moved around the LED 10 while injecting the underfill material 30 at a relatively high pressure to fill the narrow gap between the LED 10 and submount wafer 22 .\n\nthe underfill may extend further laterally than shown in the figures in actual devices.\n\nany excess underfill material 30 e.g., epoxy\n\nany excess underfill material 30 e.g., epoxy\n\nthe growth substrate 12 is then removed using a laser lift-off process (not shown).\n\nthe photon energy of the laser e.g., an excimer laser\n\nthe photon energy of the laser is selected to be above the band gap of the LED material and below the absorption edge of the sapphire substrate (e.g., between 3.44 eV and 6 eV).\n\nPulses from the laser through the sapphire are converted to thermal energy within the first 100 nm of the LED material.\n\nthe generated temperature is in excess of 1000Â° C. and dissociates the gallium and nitrogen.\n\nthe resulting high gas pressure pushes the substrate away from the epitaxial layers to release the substrate from the layers, and the loose substrate is then simply removed from the LED structure.\n\nthe underfill helps prevent the thin LED layers from cracking under the high pressure.\n\nthe growth substrate 12 may instead be removed by etching, such as reactive ion etching (RIE), or grinding.\n\netching such as reactive ion etching (RIE), or grinding.\n\nRIE reactive ion etching\n\nOther techniques may be used depending on the type of LED and substrate.\n\nthe substrate is Si-based and an insulating material between the substrate and the LED layers is etched away by a wet etch technique to remove the substrate.\n\nthe submount wafer 22 is then sawed or scribed and broken to singulate the LEDs/submounts.\n\nthe submounts may then be soldered to a printed circuit board.\n\nthe underfill process is sequentially performed on an array of LEDs mounted on a submount wafer, prior to the LEDs being singulated. There may be 500-4000 LEDs mounted on a single submount wafer, depending on the size of each LED and the density. Injecting the underfill material under each LED in the array using a single moving nozzle may take 10-40 minutes, depending on the number of LEDs.\n\nAnother problem is that the properties of the underfill material must be carefully selected for proper viscosity, thermal expansion, reliability over the long lifetime of the LED, dielectric properties, thermal conductivity, contaminant protection, and other factors. If the viscosity is too high, the pressure needed to inject the underfill under the LED to fill all voids may damage the LED. Voids must be eliminated since any air will expand when the LED/submount becomes hot and push the LED off the submount. Further, since a void area does not support the LED during the laser lift-off process, the downward stress on the LED during the laser lift-off process may crack the LED.\n\nThermal expansion of the underfill is extremely important since the LEDs undergo a solder reflow process when soldering a singulated LED/submount to a printed circuit board. Such temperatures may be 265Â° C.\n\nthe solder reflow temperature is above the typical 185Â° C. glass transition temperature for epoxy, which is the typical underfill material.\n\nthe glass transition temperature (T g ) is the temperature at which epoxy becomes soft. Above the glass transition temperature, the epoxy thermal expansion rises significantly, causing upward pressure on the LED, resulting in cracking or lifting off of the LED.\n\nAn underfill technique for LEDs is described where compression molding is used. The process is performed prior to any substrate lift-off process.\n\nthe LEDs, mounted on a submount wafer, are placed in a mold.\n\nthe mold is sealed at least around the perimeter of the submount wafer, and a vacuum is created within the mold.\n\nthe mold may be aluminum with separate cavities aligned with each LED on the submount wafer.\n\nany suitable underfill material such as a liquid polyimide, is then applied to the inlet of the mold under pressure, and the combination of the vacuum and the liquid material pressure causes the material to completely fill the cavities in the mold where the LEDs are located. There are no voids once the material has filled the mold.\n\neach mold cavity causes the liquid material to completely encapsulate each LED, along with its growth substrate.\n\nthe liquid material is then cured by heat or UV light to harden the underfill material, and the mold is released from the submount wafer.\n\na higher temperature post cure may be performed after the mold is released.\n\nthe liquid underfill material may first fill the mold, having a peripheral raised seal, and then the submount wafer is placed over the mold so that the LEDs are immersed in the underfill material. Under compression, the liquid material fills all voids under each LED. Air is pushed out through the seals along with a certain amount of the underfill material. The material is then cured, and the mold released from the submount wafer. Since such a molding process does not rely on the injection of the liquid material under pressure at an inlet of the mold, there is little possibility of damage to the fragile LEDs.\n\nthe underfill material used to fill the mold is not a liquid but is a powder or small tablets.\n\nthe solid material is then heated in the mold to melt or soften it so that it can conform to the mold and encapsulate the LEDs. Compression is used to mold the softened material and cause it to flow into the voids under each LED. Handling the underfill material as a solid has various benefits. Such compression molding using an initially solid underfill material greatly increases the number of possible underfill materials.\n\nOne of the materials which can be used for this process is the powder of an epoxy molding compound.\n\nthe entire submount wafer is subjected to a microbead blasting process to etch away the underfill material until all of the growth substrate is exposed.\n\nthe substrate is then removed using a laser lift-off process, or other suitable process.\n\nthe underfill supports the thin LED during this process.\n\nthe LED may be thinned to improve light extraction.\n\nthe surface of the LED may then be roughened to further improve light extraction by reducing the number of internal reflections.\n\nLenses may then be molded over the LEDs and/or other wafer-level processing techniques may be performed.\n\nthe LEDs/submounts are then singulated using sawing, scribe and break, or any other technique.\n\na preferred underfill material that can be used with the present process is a polyimide, which has a glass transition temperature near or above the solder reflow temperature, so that there is very little thermal expansion of the polyimide under worst case conditions.\n\nthe underfill processing time can be reduced to only a few minutes.\n\nFIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a prior art flip-chip LED, mounted on a submount, where the LED underfill material is dispensed under pressure by a small nozzle at the base of the LED.\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates a simplified portion of a submount wafer populated by an array of LEDs, such as 500-4000 LEDs.\n\nFIG. 3A illustrates a wafer-level injection molding process used to encapsulate all LEDs on the submount wafer with an underfill material.\n\nFIG. 3B illustrates an alternative type of wafer-level molding process, not using injection, used to encapsulate all LEDs on the submount wafer with an underfill material.\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates the LEDs on the wafer after being removed from the mold of FIG. 3A or FIG. 3B .\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates the upper portion of the underfill material of FIG. 4 being removed by microbead blasting.\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates a laser lift-off technique for removing the growth substrates from the LEDs.\n\nFIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a single LED mounted on a submount after the LED has been thinned and after the LEDs/submounts have been singulated.\n\nthe submount is shown soldered to a printed circuit board.\n\na conventional LED is formed on a growth substrate.\n\nthe LED is a GaN-based LED, such as an AlInGaN or InGaN LED, for producing blue light.\n\na relatively thick n-type GaN layer is grown on a sapphire growth substrate using conventional techniques.\n\nthe relatively thick GaN layer typically includes a low temperature nucleation layer and one or more additional layers so as to provide a low-defect lattice structure for the n-type cladding layer and active layer.\n\nOne or more n-type cladding layers are then formed over the thick n-type layer, followed by an active layer, one or more p-type cladding layers, and a p-type contact layer (for metallization).\n\nportions of the p-layers and active layer are etched away to expose an n-layer for metallization.\n\nthe p contact and n contact are on the same side of the chip and can be directly electrically attached to the submount contact pads. Current from the n-metal contact initially flows laterally through the n-layer.\n\nthe flip-chip LED used as an example in the present invention is the LED structure of FIG. 1 comprising a semiconductor LED 10 , its growth substrate 12 , and its electrodes 14 / 16 , where the LED is mounted on a submount wafer 22 .\n\nFIG. 2 is a simplified illustration of a submount wafer 22 on which is mounted an array of LEDs. There may be 500-4000 LEDs on a single submount wafer 22 . An LED is also referred to herein as an LED die.\n\nFIG. 3A illustrates one type of suitable injection molding process for creating the underfill for each LED.\n\na mold 36 has cavities 38 that define the shape of the hardened underfill material after the molding process.\n\nthe mold 36 may be formed of aluminum.\n\nthe mold 36 has a perimeter seal 37 that seals against the submount wafer 22 when the mold 36 is aligned with the wafer 22 and pressed against the wafer 22 .\n\nthe mold 36 has at least one inlet 40 , for injecting the liquid underfill material 41 (e.g., a polyimide), and at least one outlet 42 connected to a vacuum source.\n\nthe liquid underfill material 41 e.g., a polyimide\n\nthe underfill material 41 is injected through inlet 40 .\n\nthe underfill material 41 flows into all the cavities 38 via channels 44 between the cavities, assisted by the vacuum and the injection pressure of the material 41 .\n\nthe vacuum removes almost all the air in the mold 36 .\n\nthe entire mold 36 will be filled with the underfill material 41 , including all voids under the LEDs.\n\nthe mold 36 is then heated to cure the liquid underfill material.\n\nthe temperature of the mold 36 during curing is about 150Â° C.\n\na transparent mold may be used and the underfill material may be cured with UV light.\n\nFIG. 3B illustrates an alternative wafer-level molding process that does not use pressure injection of the underfill material.\n\nthe mold 48 has cavities 50 that are first filled with the liquid underfill material 41 at atmospheric pressure.\n\nthe submount wafer 22 is brought against the mold 48 so that the LEDs are immersed in the underfill material in each cavity 50 .\n\nthe wafer 22 and mold 48 are pressed together to force the underfill material to fill all voids.\n\na perimeter seal 53 allows the pressure to be high while allowing all air to escape as the underfill material fills the voids.\n\na vacuum may also be pulled between the wafer 22 and the mold 48 using a vacuum source around the seal 53 .\n\nthe mold 48 is then heated to cure the liquid underfill material.\n\na transparent mold may be used and the underfill material may be cured with UV light.\n\nthe mold of FIG. 3A or 3 B is then removed from the wafer 22 , resulting in the structure of FIG. 4 , having excess hardened underfill material 54 encapsulating each LED. There may also be a thin layer of hardened underfill material on the wafer 22 surface between each LED depending on the mold.\n\nthe wafer 22 may then be subject to a post-cure temperature of about 250Â° C. to additionally harden the underfill material.\n\na post-cure temperature of about 250Â° C. to additionally harden the underfill material.\n\nits glass transition temperature (Tg) is between 260-300Â° C., so a post cure temperature less than the Tg is preferred to limit any thermal expansion of the underfill.\n\nthe underfill material used to fill the mold is not a liquid but is a powder or small tablets.\n\nthe solid material is then heated in the mold of FIG. 3A or FIG. 3B to melt or soften it. Compression is used to cause the softened material to take the form of the mold and to fill the voids under the LEDs while encapsulating the LEDs.\n\nthe melted or softened material is then cured or cooled, if necessary, to make it solid again. Certain materials hardened automatically after the heating and compression process. Handling the underfill material as a solid has various benefits.\n\nsuitable materials that can be used for an underfill are not a liquid at room temperatures prior to curing, so heating up a solid material in the mold followed by compression greatly increases the number of possible materials that can be used as an underfill.\n\nOne suitable solid polymer that can be used is an epoxy molding compound in powder form.\n\nthe underfill material 54 over the growth substrate 12 must be first removed. If the growth substrate 12 will be removed by grinding or another mechanical etch process, such grinding may be used to simultaneously remove the excess underfill material 54 .\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates the removal of the excess underfill material 54 by blasting the entire surface of the wafer 22 with high-velocity microbeads 58 .\n\nthe microbeads 58 have diameters between 1-20 microns and are formed of NaHCO 3 .\n\nthe microbeads 58 are accelerated through a nozzle by air at a pressure of about 100 psi or less.\n\nthe nozzle may be large to etch the underfill material 54 from all or a large portion of the wafer 22 without the nozzle moving, or a smaller nozzle may be used to etch the underfill material 54 off only a few LEDs at a time followed by the nozzle moving to a next position over the wafer 22 .\n\nRemoving excess material of any kind using microbeads is a known process.\n\nthe underfill material 54 is etch so that its top surface intersects an edge of the LED semiconductor layers to ensure that the entire LED is supported by the underfill during the substrate laser lift-off process.\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates the laser lift-off process, previously described.\n\nthe laser pulses are shown by arrows 60 .\n\nthe surface of the GaN absorbs heat, causing the surface layer to decompose into the Ga and N 2 .\n\nthe N 2 pressure pushes the sapphire substrate away from the LED.\n\nthe growth substrates 12 become detached from the semiconductor LED layers during the lift-off process, they are removed by, for example, an adhesive sheet or some other suitable process.\n\nthe exposed LED layers are then thinned by, for example, RIE or a mechanical etch, since the exposed top layer is a relatively thick n-layer, and the surface has been damaged by the laser lift-off process.\n\nthe resulting top surface may then be roughened to increase the light extraction efficiency.\n\nwafer-level processes may also be performed on the LED array while mounted on the submount wafer 22 .\n\nOne such process may be to overmold a lens on each LED in a single mold process similar to that shown in FIG. 3A or 3 B. Details of a wafer-level lens molding process are described in Patent Publication US 2006/0105485, entitled Overmolded Lens Over LED Die, by Grigoriy Basin et al., assigned to the present assignee and incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIG. 7 illustrates a single LED/submount soldered to pads on a printed circuit board 64 .\n\nthe underfill material may be selected substantially independently of its viscosity.\n\nthe dielectric underfill material may be primarily chosen based on its coefficient of thermal expansion, ease of use, and reliability under all temperatures to which the LED is subjected.\n\na polyimide is the preferred underfill, possessing much better qualities than epoxy.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nMicroelectronics & Electronic Packaging (AREA)\n\nComputer Hardware Design (AREA)\n\nPower Engineering (AREA)\n\nManufacturing & Machinery (AREA)\n\nLed Device Packages (AREA)\n\nEncapsulation Of And Coatings For Semiconductor Or Solid State Devices (AREA)\n\nUS12/050,082 2008-03-17 2008-03-17 Underfill process for flip-chip leds Abandoned US20090230409A1 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (10)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US12/050,082 US20090230409A1 (en) 2008-03-17 2008-03-17 Underfill process for flip-chip leds PCT/IB2009/051055 WO2009115968A1 (en) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 Underfill process for flip-chip leds JP2011500333A JP5372133B2 (ja) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 ããªãããããï½ï½ ï½ã«é¢ããã¢ã³ãã¼ãã£ã«å¦ç EP09722834.0A EP2266149B1 (en) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 Underfill process for flip-chip led KR1020107023171A KR101524004B1 (ko) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 íë¦½ ì¹© ï½ï½ ï½ë¥¼ ìí ì¸ëí íë¡ì¸ì¤ CN2009801094605A CN102084505B (zh) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 ç¨äºåè£ è¯çledçåºé¨å¡«å å·¥èº BRPI0909788-0A BRPI0909788B1 (pt) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 mÃ©todo para fabricar um dispositivo emissor de luz RU2010142267/28A RU2502157C2 (ru) 2008-03-17 2009-03-13 ÐÑÐ¾ÑÐµÑÑ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÐºÐ»Ð°Ð´ÐºÐ¸ Ð´Ð»Ñ Ð¿ÐµÑÐµÐ²ÐµÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ ÑÐ¸Ð´ TW098108499A TWI463701B (zh) 2008-03-17 2009-03-16 ç¨æ¼è¦æ¶ç¼å äºæ¥µé«çåºé¨å¡«å èç US13/115,475 US8273587B2 (en) 2008-03-17 2011-05-25 Underfill process for flip-chip LEDs\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US12/050,082 US20090230409A1 (en) 2008-03-17 2008-03-17 Underfill process for flip-chip leds\n\nRelated Child Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US13/115,475 Division US8273587B2 (en) 2008-03-17 2011-05-25 Underfill process for flip-chip LEDs\n\nPublications (1)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date US20090230409A1 true US20090230409A1 (en) 2009-09-17\n\nFamily\n\nID=40677561\n\nFamily Applications (2)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US12/050,082 Abandoned US20090230409A1 (en) 2008-03-17 2008-03-17 Underfill process for flip-chip leds US13/115,475 Active 2028-03-25 US8273587B2 (en) 2008-03-17 2011-05-25 Underfill process for flip-chip LEDs\n\nFamily Applications After (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US13/115,475 Active 2028-03-25 US8273587B2 (en) 2008-03-17 2011-05-25 Underfill process for flip-chip LEDs\n\nCountry Status (9)\n\nCountry Link US (2) US20090230409A1 (da) EP (1) EP2266149B1 (da) JP (1) JP5372133B2 (da) KR (1) KR101524004B1 (da) CN (1) CN102084505B (da) BR (1) BRPI0909788B1 (da) RU (1) RU2502157C2 (da) TW (1) TWI463701B (da) WO (1) WO2009115968A1 (da)\n\nCited By (21)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US20100244277A1 (en) * 2009-03-25 2010-09-30 Rui Huang Integrated circuit packaging system with package underfill and method of manufacture thereof US20110108865A1 (en) * 2009-11-06 2011-05-12 Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
