wafer workpieces and, more particularly, to an improved system for receiving a cassette of wafers; CMP polishing, cleaning, rinsing and drying the wafers; and returning the polished and cleaned wafers to the same cassette and to the same slot from which they were taken.\n\nCMP polishing and/or planarization is performed by one machine and wafer cleaning and drying is performed by another, separate machine.\n\na processing layer i.e., oxide, tungsten or the like\n\nthe dry wafers are placed in a cassette and hand carried to a CMP polishing machine.\n\nthe CMP machine removes excess material by planarizing the wafers, and then typically rinses the wafers and places the wafers into a wet cassette. After polishing, residual particles still reside on the wafer ' s surface. If these particles dry on the wafer prior to cleaning, the microelectronic structures on the wafer may be corrupted.\n\nthe present invention overcomes the shortcomings of conventional prior art systems by integrating the polishing, cleaning and drying functions in one machine.\n\na primary object of the present invention is to provide a combined wafer CMP polishing, cleaning and drying machine in which wafers are removed from a dry cassette, polished, cleaned, dried and returned to the same cassette and slot from which they were removed.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to maintain the load station, the cleaning stations and the drying stations of the combined polishing and cleaning machine at a class 1-10 clean room environment.\n\nPositive laminar air flow from the load and cleaning stations of the machine into the CMP station of the machine is utilized to maintain the clean environment within the load and cleaning stations.\n\nthe positive air flow ensures that slurry and other particles that may be liberated from the wafers during polishing do not migrate into or otherwise contaminate the clean environment.\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention is utilization of a six-axis robot to remove wafers from a dry cassette and to transport the wafers to an index table within the CMP station of the machine.\n\nthe robot is also configured to transport wet wafers from a rinse station in the cleaning station of the machine to a spin dryer station also located in the cleaning station.\n\nthe robot also removes the dry wafers from the spin dryer station and places them back into the cassettes located in the load station of the machine.\n\nthe robot has a wet end effector and a dry end effector to ensure that wet and dry wafers are isolated during transport.\n\nthe dry end effector is used to unload and load dry cassettes, and the wet end effector is used to move wet wafers from the rinse station to the spin dryer station.\n\nthe mapping system determines which slots within a wafer cassette is occupied by wafers. The mapping system also determines whether wafers are properly aligned within the slots and whether more than one wafer is within a particular slot.\n\nthe mapping system preferably comprises an optical scanning device, such as a video camera, mounted in a mounting bracket attached to a top portion of the robot and a system processor configured to interpret and process the signals from the scanning device.\n\nthe robot end-effector retrieves the scanning device (camera) from the mounting bracket and traverses up and down in front of the cassette, allowing the optical scanner to view the contents of the cassette.\n\na back lighting source behind the cassette may be utilized to increase the effectiveness of the optical scan vision system.\n\nthe CMP station is preferably configured to receive and polish five wafers at a time.\n\na multi-head transport apparatus lowers five wafer carrier heads into proximity with the index table and picks up the wafers.\n\nthe transport apparatus then moves laterally until it is positioned above a polishing surface.\n\nthe transport apparatus is then lowered such that the wafers are pressed against the polishing surface.\n\na polishing slurry is preferably provided, and the individual carriers are rotated on and oscillated radially across the polishing surface.\n\nthe wafers are returned to unload cups in the index table.\n\na flipper apparatus then transfers the wafer from the unload cups to the cleaning station of the machine.\n\nthe cleaning station of the machine preferably comprises a water track, cleaning stations, a rinse station, a spin dryer station and a plurality of wafer staging areas. More specifically, when a wafer is first loaded into the cleaning station from the CMP station of the machine, the wafer is held at a first staging area until the machine determines that it is clear to release the wafer. When cleared, water jets urge the wafer into a first cleaning station configured to wash and clean both surfaces of the wafer. From the first cleaning station, the wafer is transported down a water track into a second staging area. Again, the wafer is held at this position until the machine determines that the wafer in front of it has cleared to the next station.\n\nthe wafer cleaning stations preferably comprise a plurality of pairs of rollers which pull the wafers through the cleaning stations and which also clean the top and bottom flat surfaces of the wafers.\n\nVarious rollers within the roller boxes may operate at different rotational speeds and rotate in different directions. In this manner, certain rollers may function as drive rollers to move wafers through the cleaning stations, while other rollers may function to clean wafer surfaces as the wafers are driven through the cleaning stations.\n\nthe rollers are contained in enclosed boxes which may be easily removed from the machine to facilitate convenient changing of the rollers as the roller surfaces become worn through extended use.\n\na plurality of channels are preferably formed in an upper inside surface of the roller boxes to permit distribution of a plurality of different chemicals (e.g. , water, cleaning solutions, surfactants, friction reducing agents, and agents to control the pH of the various solutions) into discrete regions of the roller boxes.\n\na plurality of roller boxes are preferably employed, different chemicals may be used in different cleaning stations.\n\nthe first roller box may for example, may distribute a cleaning solution and deionized water mix onto the wafers to facilitate heavier cleaning, while the second roller box may simply distribute deionized water onto the wafers to achieve a rinse.\n\nWafers are transported from the second cleaning station to the rinse station via a water track.\n\nthe water track is supported by support posts and the support posts may incorporate a vertical adjustment system for track alignment.\n\nWafers are rinsed in a serial manner within the rinse station, which is configured to tilt downward during the rinsing procedure. The downward tilt facilitates effective drainage and removal of any debris or chemicals.\n\na number of water jets urge each wafer into the rinse station, maintain the position of the wafer during rinsing, and perform the rinsing of the upper and lower surfaces of the wafer.\n\nthe water jets also support the wafer within the rinse station such that mechanical contact with the wafer is minimized.\n\nthe robot uses a wet end effector to lift wafers from the rinse station and transfer them to a spin dryer station.\n\nthe spin dryer station is equipped with a motor which spins a platform holding a wafer at speeds in the range of about 4,000 rpm, to thereby remove residual deionized water from the wafer.\n\nthe spin dryer station preferably includes a shield around the spinning apparatus to guard other stations of the machine from water and debris that may be shed during the spin-dry process.\n\nthe shield preferably includes a movable door so that the robot can access the spin dryer.\n\nthe spin dryer preferably employs a number of gripping fingers configured to maintain the wafer upon the platform during spinning.\n\nthe robot uses a dry end effector to retrieve dry wafers from the spin dryer station and to return the dry wafers to the cassette from which they originated. Each wafer is tracked and monitored through the polishing and cleaning steps so that after processing, it can be placed back into its original slot in its original cassette.\n\na vision system or other position sensing method may be utilized to monitor wafers as they pass through the cleaning station of the machine and to determine if the wafers have properly moved from one area of the cleaning station to the next. Wafers are released from the various staging areas when it is determined that the wafers are all safely positioned within the proper staging areas; that is, when it has determined that lodged wafers are not still in the water track or in the various cleaning, rinsing and drying stations.\n\nthe flow of fluids to the wafer index station, polish station and cleaning station may be controlled through use of a fluid flow regulator system, which monitors the flow of fluid, as opposed to prior art systems which typically measure fluid pressure. By measuring fluid flow directly, the system is less susceptible to variations in inlet fluid pressure. Fluid flows within the system may thus be much more accurately controlled than is possible with prior art systems.\n\nthe present invention may also incorporate an operator interface such as a flat panel touch screen.\n\nthe touch screen preferably presents a three-dimensional graphical image of virtually every relevant aspect of the system to facilitate operation, maintenance, trouble-shooting, and the like.\n\nFigure 1 is a plan view of an integrated machine for polishing, washing, rinsing, spin- drying, and unloading workpieces according to the present invention\n\nFigure 2 is a front view of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 3 is a side view of the load/unload station and a portion of the index station of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 4 is side view of a robot used in the load/unload station of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 5 is an exploded side view of the two end-effector configuration on the robot of Figure 4;\n\nFigure 6 is an exploded plan view of one of the end effectors of Figures 4 and 5;\n\nFigure 7 is a plan view of the cleaning station of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 8 is an exploded plan view of the first water track of the cleaning station of Figure 7;\n\nFigure 9 is a sectional view of the first water track taken through lines 9-9 of Figure 8;\n\nFigure 10 is an exploded plan view of the second water track of the cleaning station of Figure 7;\n\nFigure 11 is a sectional view of the second water track taken through lines 11-11 of Figure 10;\n\nFigure 12 is a sectional view of the second water track taken through lines 12-12 of\n\nFigure 13 is an exploded plan view of the third water track of the cleaning station of Figure 7;\n\nFigure 14 is a sectional view of the third water track taken through lines 14-14 of Figure 13;\n\nFigure 15 is a front view of the scrubber box of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 16 is a plan view of the top panel of the scrubber box of Figure 15;\n\nFigure 17 is a rear view of the scrubber box of Figure 15;\n\nFigure 18a is a plan view of the rinse station of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 18b is a sectional view of a fluid supply port, manifold and jet which form a part of the rinse station of Figure 18a;\n\nFigure 19 is a side view of the rinse station of Figure 18;\n\nFigure 20a is an exploded plan view of the rinse station of Figure 18 in its configured location proximate the water track;\n\nFig 20b is another exploded plan view of the rinse station, depicting entrance of a robot end-effector into the station to retrieve a rinsed wafer;\n\nFigure 21 is a side view of the rinse station of Figure 18 in a declined position\n\nFigure 22 is a block diagram of a fluid flow control system used in conjunction with the machine of Figure 1\n\nFigure 23 is a sectional view of the spin dryer station of the machine of Figure 1;\n\nFigure 24 is a schematic diagram showing the course of wafer flow according to the present invention. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments\n\nMachine 10 comprises wafer load/unload station 100, wafer index station 200. wafer CMP station 300, and wafer cleaning station 400. Each of the foregoing stations are structurally and functionally described in greater detail below.\n\nwafer load/unload station 100 is configured to accommodate a plurality of wafer cassettes to permit substantially continuous operation of machine 10.\n\nload/unload station 100 includes three wafer cassette platforms 102, each configured to hold at least one wafer cassette 104 full of wafers to be polished and cleaned.\n\nwafer cassette platforms 102 each configured to hold at least one wafer cassette 104 full of wafers to be polished and cleaned.\n\nMachine 10 then processes all wafers which reside in a first one of the cassettes 104. After all wafers have been removed from the first cassette 104. machine 10 processes the wafers in a next one of the cassettes 104. After the wafers have proceeded through the CMP and cleaning processes, machine 10, as discussed more fully below, preferably returns the wafers back to the same slot in the same cassette 104 from which they originated. After machine 10 has returned all wafers back to a cassette 104. that cassette may be removed from its cassette platform 102 a new cassette 104 (filled partially or fully with wafers) installed in its place. In this manner, substantially continuous, uninterrupted input of wafers into machine 10 may be achieved, facilitating substantially higher workpiece throughput than previously achievable with known\n\nmachine 10 polishes, cleans, and dries the wafers in one continuous process, the need for separate cleaning machines and additional processing is alleviated. Also, because machine 10 returns the wafers back to the same slot in the same dry cassette from which they originated, the operator and the manufacturing facility can better track each cassette and each wafer through the fabrication process.\n\neach cassette platform 102 includes a tilted base 106 for supporting each cassette 104.\n\nthe tilt of base 106, and accordingly cassette 104 causes the wafers in the cassette 104 to slide to the back of each cassette, ensuring that the wafers are properly positioned in the cassette prior to removal.\n\nthe tilted cassette ensures that the wafers are properly secured in the cassettes prior to their removal.\n\nBase 106 preferably has a tilt in the range of 5-18 degrees, and most preferably has a tilt of 6 degrees.\n\nBase 106 may be manually set at the desired degree of tilt or, alternatively, an elevator assembly, for example a servo assembly, stepper motor, torque motor assembly, or the like, may be used to adjust the tilt of base 106.\n\nEach cassette platform 102 preferably includes two doors for maintaining a clean room environment within load/unload station 100 and within cleaning station 400.\n\nAn inner platform door or barrier 108 is located between each platform 102 and load/unload station 100 and is configured to automatically engage and retract at certain times.\n\nan outer platform door 1 10 is located on the outer front side of the platform and isolates platform 102 from the outside environment.\n\ninner door 108 is configured to close before an operator may open outer door 1 10.\n\nouter door 1 10 includes a controlled locking mechanism, for example, a magnetic or pneumatic lock, which prevents an operator from opening outer door 1 10 until it is safe to do so.\n\nPlatforms 102 preferably comprise various sensors for monitoring cassette positions and other status information.\n\nplatforms 102 include cassette position sensors for monitoring whether cassettes are properly positioned on base 106, and outer door sensors for determining whether outer door 110 is open or closed. If cassette 104 is improperly positioned on base 106. the cassette position sensor will send a signal to the machine's controller which, in turn, will sound an alarm or illuminate a warning light for the operator. Similarly, if outer door 1 10 is open, the outer door sensor will send a signal to the machine's controller, and the controller will prevent inner door 108 from opening, thus ensuring that the clean room portion of the machine is not compromised.\n\nPlatforms 102 also preferably comprise cassette status sensor/indicators for monitoring the status of cassettes during processing.\n\nthe cassette status indicator may transmit signals to the machine ' s processor/controller indicating that a cassette is present, that a cassette is mapped and in service, or that cassette processing is completed and the cassette is ready to be removed. Accordingly, if a cassette is in service, the processing system will lock outer door 110 and prevent the operator from removing it. Similarly, if the status indicator indicates that it is safe for the operator to access the cassette, the operator can request the processing system to unlock outer door 110 so that the operator can remove and/or replace the cassette.\n\nCassette platforms 102 are preferably configured to accommodate many different cassette designs and configurations. Most preferably, platforms 102 are configured to accept 6 inch. 8 inch and 300 millimeter wafer cassettes.\n\nload/unload station 100 could be configured to accept Standard Machine Interface (SMIF) wafer pods instead of traditional open air wafer cassettes and cassette platforms. In such a configuration, load â unload station 100 would include SMIF pod adapters in place of cassette platforms 102.\n\nSMIF Standard Machine Interface\n\nPlatform areas 102 may include ionizers to minimize accumulation of static charge. Also, as one skilled in the art will appreciate, when outer door 110 is opened, particles from the outside environment may enter platforms 102. Positive laminar air flow may be provided by HEPA filters mounted above machine 10 in order to keep airborne particles out of platforms 102. Suitable filters are manufactured by Asyst Technologies, Inc. of Fremont, California. In addition, each platform may include a back lighting system which improves the effectiveness of the wafer mapping system which is described in more detail below.\n\nrobot 1 12 After cassettes 104 are placed in platforms 102 and machine 10 is set for processing, robot 1 12 removes wafers individually from cassettes 104 and moves them through air knife 1 14 to index station 200.\n\nrobot 1 12 preferably comprises a six-axis robot, for example, the SV3 six-axis robot manufactured by Motoman, Inc. of West Carrollton, Ohio.\n\nRobot 1 12 preferably includes two wafer controlling end-effectors 1 16 and 1 18 connected to the wrist axis 120 of robot 1 12.\n\nEnd-effector 116 is configured to handle dry wafers (e.g.\n\nend-effector 1 18 is configured to handle wet wafers (e.g. , wafers in transit from the rinse station to the spin-dry station).\n\nend-effector 1 16 may be configured to handle wet wafers and end-effector 1 18 may be configured to handle dry wafers, or both end-effectors may be configured to handle all wet or all dry wafers.\n\nEnd-effectors 1 16 and 1 18 include vacuum holes 122 for applying vacuum pressure to wafers held thereon.\n\na vacuum source is configured to supply the necessary vacuum pressure.\n\nthe vacuum pressure applied to the end-effectors securely holds the wafers on the end-effectors while robot 1 12 moves the wafers about its various axes. For example, robot 1 12 removes wafers from cassettes 104 \"device side upâ. The wafers are then moved through air knife 1 14 and into index station 200. where they are flipped into a \"device side down \" ' state and placed on an index load cup 204 (see Figure 1).\n\nthe vacuum pressure holds wafers on the end-effector as robot 112 flips the wafer.\n\nEnd-effectors 1 16 and 118 preferably include sensors (typically vacuum-type) for detecting the presence or absence of a wafer on the end-effector. If a wafer is lost from an end-effector during transport of the wafer, the sensor will promptly detect the error and send a signal to the robot controller and/or the machine controller to stop system processing and sound an alarm. The machine controller and associated alarm system will stop machine 10 so that other expensive wafers are not lost.\n\nend-effectors 116 and 118 may manufactured from, or coated with a static dissipative material, such as ESD410, to make them resistant to electrostatic discharge.\n\nload/unload station 100 and/or robot 112 may include an ionizing system to help reduce the build up of electrostatic charge.\n\nrobot 112 may include a mapping system for determining which locations within a wafer cassette contain wafers and for determining whether any of the wafers are improperly positioned within a cassette. Examples of improperly positioned wafers include multiple wafers disposed within a single slot, and wafers cross-slotted between two slots.\n\nthe mapping system preferably includes an optical scanning device 128. such as a video camera, mounted in a mounting bracket 129 attached to a top portion of robot 112 so that robot 112 can scan wafer cassettes 104.\n\nthe scanning device may be attached to any suitable portion of robot 112.\n\nthe mapping system and scanning device may be installed on machine 10 completely independent from robot 112.\n\nMapping system 128 preferably comprises an optical vision mapping system, for example, the \"IVS Express\" mapping system manufactured by Acuity Imaging, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio, which determines the location of wafers within a cassette and transmits that information to a system processor configured to interpret and process the signals received from the scanning device.\n\nthe processor incorporated in the robot controller, the machine controller, an independent mapping processor, or a combination of these devices.\n\nthe processor receives vision data and converts it into wafer location data.\n\nthe location data preferably comprises thirty-two bits of data: thirty bits are used to define the cassette and slot information for each wafer; one bit is used as an error bit to signify that a wafer is cross-slotted between two slots; and the other bit is used as an error bit to signify that a cassette slot contains multiple wafers. If one of the two errors occur, the processor will send a signal to the machine controller, which will stop the machine processing and notify the operator that there is a problem. If no error occurs, the controller will save the location information for each wafer and, as discussed in more detail below, will use that stored information to ensure that each wafer is placed back in the same slot in the same cassette from which it originated.\n\nprocessor that performs the storage and machine and mapping control functions\n\nthe processor may comprises a single processor, or alternatively, multiple linked processors. Some of the control and storage functions may be performed by the mapping or robot controllers, for example, while others are performed by the machine ' s controller. The distribution of control functions among multiple processors is well known in the art.\n\nthirty-two bits of data are preferred for defining wafer locations and/or wafer position errors, any appropriate number of bits may be used to designate wafer location information.\n\nthe wafer mapping system may be configured to perform wafer code reading (bar code or OCR) directly.\n\nAir knife 1 14 preferably comprises an opening between load/unload station 100 and index station 200 and includes a positive airflow from load/unload station 100 into index station 200 to keep renegade particles from entering the clean load/unload station.\n\nany particle control means may be used to keep particles from entering load/unload station 100 while allowing wafers to be transferred into index station 200 from load/unload station 100.\n\nindex table 202 After entering index station 200. robot 1 12 places each wafer device side down onto one of a plurality of load cups 204 residing on index table 202.\n\nIndex table 202 also includes a plurality of wafer unload cups 206 which alternate with load cups 204. After a wafer is deposited on one of the plurality of load cups 204, table 202 rotates so that a new load cup 204 aligns with air knife 1 14. Robot 1 12 then places the next wafer on the new empty load cup 204. This process continues until all load cups 204 are filled with wafers.\n\nIndex table 202 preferably includes five load cups 204 and five unload cups 206.\n\nwafer carrier transport assembly 208 having individual wafer carrier elements 210 (see Figure 3) aligns itself over index table 202. such that respective carrier elements 210 are positioned directly above the wafers residing in respective load cups 204. Transport assembly 208 then lowers carrier elements 210 into proximity with the wafers such that carriers 210 can retrieve the wafers from the load cups. After each carrier obtains a wafer, transport assembly 208 moves the carrier elements with their respective wafers laterally into CMP station 300 and positions the wafers above a polishing table 302. Once above polishing table 302, transport assembly 208 lowers carrier elements 210 such that the wafers are pressed into operative engagement with a polishing pad disposed upon polishing table 302.\n\npolishing table 302 and the polishing pad disposed thereon rotate about their vertical axes.\n\nindividual carrier elements 210 spin the wafers about their respective vertical axes and oscillate the wafers back and forth across polishing table 302 as the wafers are pressed against the polishing pad. In this manner, the surfaces of the wafers are polished and/or planarized.\n\nthe wafers are lifted from the polishing pad. and transported back to index station 200. At this time, the wafers may be polished on a second polishing table 213, if desired. Next, transport assembly 208 lowers individual carrier elements\n\nindex table 202 rotates and carrier elements 210 are again lowered to receive a new set of wafers from load cups 204 for polishing.\n\nthe wafers are transported to CMP station 300 and the process repeats. While wafers are being polished in\n\ntransport assembly 208 is described as having five polishing stations or wafer carrier elements 210, use of any appropriate number of carrier elements is envisioned. Moreover. the present invention may be employed in circumstances where not all carrier elements are functioning at the same time. Many standard wafer cassettes, for example, have slots to accommodate twenty-four individual workpieces or wafers. Consequently, with a five carrier element transport apparatus, when the last four disks within a cassette are retrieved for polishing, the fifth carrier element will be empty.\n\nCleaning station 400 is illustrated in detail in Figure 7.\n\nCleaning station 400 preferably comprises first, second and third water tracks 402, 404 and 406, first and second scrub stations 408 and 410, a rinse station 412 and a spin-dry station 414.\n\nFigure 24 provides an overview of the wafer flow between these stations. Essentially, before a wafer can be moved from one station to the next, not only must processing at that station be complete, but it must also be verified that no wafers are present in the next processing station.\n\nthe machine controller Before wafer âAâ can be moved by flipper 212 into first water track 402, the machine controller, utilizing sensors appropriately located in cleaning station 400 as will be described below, must first verify that wafer âBâ has been passed from track 402 to first scrub station 408. Once this is verified, flipper 1 12 moves wafer âAâ from unload cup 206 onto first water track 402. Wafer âAâ is moved from water track 402 into scrub station 408 only when it has been verified that wafer âBâ has moved onto second water track 404. Wafer âAâ is retained in scrub station 408 until scrubbing is complete and until it is verified that wafer \"B \" has moved onto second scrub station 410. at which time \"Aâ is moved onto second water track 404.\n\nwafer âAâ is passed to second scrub station 410. After wafer âBâ is passed from the first to the second portion of water track 406, and scrubbing of wafer âAâ in station 410 is complete, wafer âAâ is passed into the first portion of track 406. After wafer âBâ is passed from the second portion of track 406 into rinse station 412. wafer âAâ is moved into the second portion of water track 406. Once rinsing of wafer âBâ is complete, wet end-effector 1 16 of robot 1 12 retrieves wafer \"Bâ from rinse station 412.\n\nwafer \"Aâ is passed into station 412 from the second portion of water track 406 for rinsing. Wafer âAâ remains in station 412 until rinsing is complete and until it is verified that wafer âBâ has been transferred from wet end- effector 1 16 into spin dryer station 414. At this time, wafer âAâ is retrieved from rinse station 412 by the wet end-effector 116 of robot 112. Wafer âAâ is then moved into spin dryer station 414 when it is verified that wafer \"Bâ is present on dry end-effector 1 18 of robot 112.\n\nwafer \"Aâ is retrieved by dry end-effector 1 18 and placed in its proper slot in an unload cassette 104.\n\nfirst water track 402 is configured to receive a wafer and hold it in a staging position until the cleaning station is ready for it to be released.

Plugs may be employed to seal the entry holes formed during the boring or drilling process.\n\nscrubber boxes 450 may include a fluid nozzle (not shown) at the location where wafers exit the scrubber boxes to give the wafers a good rinse or flush as they exit the roller box.\n\nthe post scrub station rinse ensures that loosened particles do not settle back on the wafer surface as the wafer exits box 450.\n\nthe post scrub station rinse may be accomplished by increasing fluid flow in the wafer track at the location the wafer enters the track. In this manner, the existing wafer track configuration may be utilized, thus. eliminating the need for an extra fluid nozzle or scrubber boxes 450.\n\ncleaning station 400 may further comprise a hydrofluoric (HF) acid polish station located between second scrub station 410 and rinse station 412 (not shown).\n\nthe HF station may include a robot or other handling device for dipping the wafer into the HF acid. From the HF station the wafer would travel to rinse station 412 via water track 406. Referring now to Figures 18-21, the construction and operation of rinse station 412 will now be described. As wafers come out of second staging area 444 of third water track 406. they are received by rinse station 412. The air gap between third water track 406 and rinse station 412 is relatively small to ensure that wafers do not appreciably dry prior to the rinsing process.\n\nHF hydrofluoric\n\nrinse station 412 is configured to receive wafers in a serial manner, thoroughly rinse each wafer with one or more rinsing solutions such as deionized water, and hold each rinsed wafer for retrieval by robot 112, which thereafter transports the rinsed wafer to spin dryer station 414 (see Figure 7). More particularly, rinse station 412 comprises a rinse ring 600 which preferably includes a ring body 602 for holding wafers during the rinsing process. Ring body 602 comprises a fluid manifold 604 communicating with respective fluid supply ports 606A and 606B. Manifold 604 is advantageously configured with a plurality of jets 608 disposed about a substantially horizontal surface 610 of ring body 602.\n\nFluid supply ports 606 supply fluid to the internal region of manifold 604, such that fluid is ejected from respective jets 608 at a substantially uniform pressure and flows about the arc defined by surface 610.\n\nthe orientation of the fluid supply ports 606, manifold 604 and jets 608 is best seen in Figure 18b.\n\nplane 612 is slightly above (e.g., 5-20mm and preferably about 10mm) the horizontal surface defined by surface 610 of ring body 602.\n\nthe fluid (not shown) ejected from jets 608 supports the wafer as it is transferred from the water track to the rinse ring.\n\nwafers are preferably centered about manifold 604 through the interaction of respective wafer guides 614, 616 and respective centering pins 618, 620, 622 and 624 as they are transferred from third water track 406 to the rinse ring in the direction of arrow 626.\n\nthe perimeter edge of each workpiece may gently contact wafer guides 614, 616 and/or one or more centering pins 618-624, mechanical contact between flat wafer surfaces and rinse ring body 602 is substantially avoided.\n\na wafer When a wafer is substantially centered within the rinse ring and supported by fluid ejected from jets 608 ( Figure 18), the wafer is said to be completely transferred from third water track 406 and received within the rinse station.\n\nrinse ring 600 is caused to tilt downwardly as shown in Figure 21. deviating from the horizontal plane by an angle in the range of 10Â°-50Â°, and most preferably about 30Â°.\n\na laminar flow of rinsing fluid is supplied to both the upper surface and bottom surface of the wafer.\n\na first fluid nozzle 628 is configured to discharge rinse fluid at the upper surface of the wafer, substantially in the direction of arrow 630.\n\na second rinse nozzle 632 is suitably configured to discharge rinse fluid at the bottom surface of the wafer, substantially in the direction of arrow\n\nrinse station 412 has been described herein as having a tiltable rinse ring, one should appreciate that the rinse ring may be fixed at an angle of about 10 - 50, and most preferably about\n\nThroughput may be increased by simultaneously rinsing both the upper and lower surfaces of each wafer.\n\nthe perimeter edge of the workpiece may also be effectively rinsed.\n\nrinse fluid is applied to the top surface at a rate in the range of OJ-20 liters/minute, and most preferably at a rate of about 4 -5 liters/ minute.\n\nrinse fluid is advantageously applied to the bottom surface at a rate in the range of OJ-10 liters/minute, and most preferably at a rate of about 1.5 liters/minute.\n\nthe tilted rinse ring assembly Upon completion of the rinsing operation, the tilted rinse ring assembly is manipulated back to the horizontal position and robot 112 retrieves rinsed wafers and transfers them to spin dryer station 414.\n\nwet end-effector 1 18 of robot 112 enters rinse station 412 to retrieve a rinsed wafer and transfer it to spin dryer station 414.\n\nrobot 112 may retrieve rinsed wafers from the rinse ring while the rinse ring is in the tilted position.\n\nSpin dryer station 414 is illustrated in Figure 23.\n\na spin dryer assembly suitable for use in spin dryer station 414 is fully disclosed and explained in detail in U.S. Patent App. No.\n\nSpin dryer station 414 includes a spin dryer 700 enclosed within a chamber 701 defined by a shroud or shield 704.\n\nSpin dryer 700 comprises a workpiece platform 702 configured to hold a wafer securely thereon as the platform is spun at high velocities by motor 760.\n\na plurality of mass-reducing apertures are formed through platform 702 in order to reduce the mass of spin dryer 700 and thereby minimize spin cycle acceleration and deceleration times.\n\na plurality of gripping fingers 706 are pivotally mounted around the outer periphery of platform 702 to grasp or grip the edges of a wafer placed on platform 702 by robot 112 (wet end- effector 1 18). Fingers 706 include a head portion 706a which extends above platform 702 and engages the wafer, and a shank portion 706b which extends below platform 702. Gripping fingers 706, or at least the portions 706a which contact the wafers, are made of a soft, pliable material, such as Ertalyte, that will not damage or scratch the held wafers.\n\nSpring-loaded plungers 710 mounted below platform 702 contact bias shank portions 706b radially outwardly, thereby moving head portions 706a radially inwardly, to maintain gripping fingers 706 in a gripping or secured position.\n\nWafers loaded onto spin dryer 700 do not rest directly on platform 702 but instead rest on support pins 703, which are also made of a soft, pliable material.\n\nActuator assembly 714 mounted below platform 702 serves to spread the gripping fingers apart and release held wafers as follows. Assembly 714 is vertically movable by virtue of its attachment to an air cylinder 750. When actuator assembly 714 is moved upwards, cam ring 716 which forms a part of assembly 714 contacts shank portions 706b of gripping fingers 706.\n\nPlatform 702 is accelerated by motor 760 to a velocity of approximately 4,000 rpm in preferably about 1.0 seconds, is spun at that speed for preferably about 20 seconds to remove all water and other particulates from the wafer surfaces, and is then decelerated back to an idle condition in preferably about 1.0 seconds.\n\nan air flow module may be mounted above shield 704 to direct a column of forced air across the upper wafer surface.\n\nactuator assembly 714 is again moved upwardly to engage shank portions 706b and cause gripping fingers 706 to move to a release position as described above. Assembly 714 is maintained in this position until the dried wafer has been retrieved by dry end-effector 1 16 of robot 1 12 and cleared out of spin dryer station 414. Robot 1 12 then returns the dried wafer to the slot of the cassette from which the wafer originated.\n\nMachine 10 During operation of machine 10 various fluids need to be supplied to the CMP station, the rinse station, the water track, and to the scrubber boxes of the cleaning station. Moreover, a plurality of different fluids (e.g. , three) may need to be supplied to the scrubber box during the cleaning operation.\n\nMachine 10 is preferably configured such that a desired volume rate of flow is supplied to these various operations, which flow rate is substantially unaffected by changes in fluid supply pressure, as described below.\n\nthe box designated as a \"fluid siteâ 802 may comprise rinse station 412. a fluid inlet port in scrubber box 450. or a wafer rinse supply port.\n\na process controller 804 associated with machine 10\n\nthe volume rate of fluid flow to the fluid site 802 may be accurately controlled notwithstanding the presence of variations in the fluid supply pressure.\n\nControl scheme 800 further comprises a fluid source 806 for holding a supply of a desired processing fluid, a flow meter 808, a pump 810 for controlling the fluid flow, a pump controller\n\na suitable pump may comprise peristaltic pump model number 07015-21 manufactured by the MasterFlex company of Vernon Hills, Illinois.\n\nPump controller 812 may comprise any suitable pump controller compatible with the pump being used. Alternatively, pump controller 812 may be eliminated and system processor 804 may function as the pump controller.\n\nFlow meter 808 is preferably a non-contacting flow meter such as product model number M- 10000 which is available from the Malema company of San Ramon, California.\n\na desired flow rate through flow meter 808 to fluid site 802 is programmed into processor 804 prior to (or during) operation of machine 10.\n\nflow meter 808 outputs an electrical signal 814 indicative of the actual flow rate through flow meter 808 to site 802.\n\nProcessor 804 receives electrical signal 814 and, responding thereto, directs pump controller 812 to adjust the pump 810 as necessary to maintain the actual flow rate within a predetermined range from the desired set point flow rate.\n\nprocessor 804 outputs an electrical signal 816 to pump controller 812.\n\nPump controller 812 then sends a signal 818 to pump 810. directing the pump to thereby change the pumping rate in an amount necessary to drive the error between the actual flow rate and the desired flow rate through flow meter 808 to a minimum.\n\na real time, closed loop PID control scheme is employed by processor 804 to effect this function.\n\na touch screen display (not shown) may be employed to allow the operator to monitor, reconfigure, troubleshoot, and otherwise operate machine 10. More particularly, a touch screen display panel may be configured to display, preferably in three dimensions, a graphical representation of the various operational features of machine 10 described above. For example. if the operator desires to load a new cassette into load station 100. the operator may press a graphical icon representative of load station 100 on the touch screen display.\n\nthe touch screen display may then prompt the operator with questions, or may simply permit the operator to touch the door associated with the cassette loading function to thereby open the door.\n\nThis model of touch screen interaction may be applied to virtually any aspect of machine 10 described herein.\n\na vision system could be utilized to track wafers as they travel through cleaning station 400 and to detect when and if errors, delays, wafer breakage, or the like occur during the cleaning process.\n\nthe IVS Express vision system from Acuity Imaging Inc. could be utilized to this end.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nMechanical Engineering (AREA)\n\nComputer Hardware Design (AREA)\n\nCondensed Matter Physics & Semiconductors (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nManufacturing & Machinery (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nMicroelectronics & Electronic Packaging (AREA)\n\nPower Engineering (AREA)\n\nContainer, Conveyance, Adherence, Positioning, Of Wafer (AREA)\n\nMechanical Treatment Of Semiconductor (AREA)\n\nCleaning Or Drying Semiconductors (AREA)\n\nFinish Polishing, Edge Sharpening, And Grinding By Specific Grinding Devices (AREA)\n\nPCT/US1998/018897 1997-09-10 1998-09-10 Combined cmp and wafer cleaning apparatus and associated methods WO1999013498A2 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (3)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP98946024A EP1012876A2 (en) 1997-09-10 1998-09-10 Combined cmp and wafer cleaning apparatus and associated methods JP2000511187A JP3417925B2 (ja) 1997-09-10 1998-09-10 çµã¿åããï½ï½ï½ããã³ã¦ã¨ãæ´æµå¨å ·ããã³é¢é£æ¹æ³ KR1020007002594A KR20010023908A (ko) 1997-09-10 1998-09-10 íµí©í ìì í¼ ì°ë§/ì¨ì´í¼ ì¸ì² ì¥ì¹ ë° ê·¸ ê´ë ¨ ë°©ë²\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (2)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US08/926,700 US6213853B1 (en) 1997-09-10 1997-09-10 Integral machine for polishing, cleaning, rinsing and drying workpieces US08/926,700 1997-09-10\n\nPublications (3)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date WO1999013498A2 true WO1999013498A2 (en) 1999-03-18 WO1999013498A3 WO1999013498A3 (en) 1999-06-03 WO1999013498A8 WO1999013498A8 (en) 1999-09-23\n\nFamily\n\nID=25453584\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date PCT/US1998/018897 WO1999013498A2 (en) 1997-09-10 1998-09-10 Combined cmp and wafer cleaning apparatus and associated methods\n\nCountry Status (6)\n\nCountry Link US (7) US6213853B1 (zh-TW) EP (1) EP1012876A2 (zh-TW) JP (4) JP3417925B2 (zh-TW) KR (1) KR20010023908A (zh-TW) TW (1) TW432446B (zh-TW) WO (1) WO1999013498A2 (zh-TW)\n\nCited By (12)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title WO2000023230A1 (en) * 1998-10-19 2000-04-27 Speedfam-Ipec Corporation Catastrophic error recovery apparatus and associated methods WO2001000335A1 (en) * 1999-06-29 2001-01-04 Lam Research Corporation High rpm megasonic cleaning WO2001012384A2 (en) * 1999-08-12 2001-02-22 Speedfam-Ipec Corporation Apparatus for moving a workpiece KR20020053584A (ko) * 2000-12-27 2002-07-05 íí¨ì© ï¼³ï½ï½ ìì¤í ì ë¦°ì¤ ì¥ì¹ WO2002080237A1 (en) * 2001-03-30 2002-10-10 Lam Research Corporation Angular spin, rinse, and dry module and methods for making and implementing the same US6795202B2 (en) 2002-11-15 2004-09-21 Tdk Corporation Wafer processing apparatus having wafer mapping function US7379174B2 (en) 2004-10-26 2008-05-27 Tdk Corporation Wafer detecting device WO2009128698A1 (en) * 2008-04-18 2009-10-22 Hun Sniah Khoo Semiconductor die sorter for wafer level packaging EP2155590A1 (en) * 2007-05-11 2010-02-24 Applied Materials, Inc.
