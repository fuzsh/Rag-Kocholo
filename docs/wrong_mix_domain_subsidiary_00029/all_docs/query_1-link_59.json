Standardization and international uniformity has many advantages.  People can expect the same level of quality of any specific brand anywhere around the world.  Standardization supports positive consumer perceptions of a product .If a company enjoys strong brand identity and a strong reputation, choosing a standardized approach might work to its benefit.  Positive word-of-mouth means an increase in sales around the globe.  It also includes cost reduction that gives economies of scale. Selling large quantities of the same, non-adapted product and buying components in bulk can reduce the cost-per-unit.  Other advantages related to economies of scale include improved research and development, marketing operational costs, and lower costs of investment.  Standardization is a reasonable strategy at a time where trade barriers are coming down.  Following a standardized approach helps companies aim focus on a uniformed marketing mix specifically focusing on one single product, leaving enough room for quality improvement\n\n27.
