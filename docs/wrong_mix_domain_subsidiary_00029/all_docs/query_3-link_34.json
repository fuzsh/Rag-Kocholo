They described the advantages and disadvantages of the leading traditional approaches to assessing the value of an enterprise and proposed a model of the dynamics of the company&#39;s value, taking into account the ownership structure, explaining the mechanism of the influence of the company&#39;s ownership structure on the capital structure. Using an example, we examined the change in the company&#39;s value by individual factors and identified which factors have the most significant positive and negative impact.\n\nDownload\n\nAbstract: In this paper we present the case of Slovenian public limited companies based on the discounted free cash flows to equity and comparing it with market value of equity capital of companies before and during the financial-economic crisis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the equity value of companies, as well as present the importance of fair and honest company valuations. The fundamental value of equity capital of a company is important for both management and external shareholders. The wide disparity between market and fundamental values can lead to high value adjustments, which reduces investors confidence in the capital market. This has had a negative impact on the operations of financial institutions, and individual as well as company investment; especially on developing financial markets during a financial-economic crisis. This paper shows the problem of company valuation on small and emerging capital markets which have a short history of data.

Valuation is the process of determining the economic value of a business or a company which reflects the performance of the company both its past performance as well as expectation of its future performance. Valuation is used by financial market participants to determine the price they are willing to buy or sell to the effect of sale of business. To study the intrinsic value of the firm’s equity and compare the calculation of intrinsic value with their corresponding market values. The data is analyzed by using financial models like discounted cash flow method, Dividend growth model applied for rubber tyre companies and done comparative studies. The intrinsic value of the firm’s equity compared to the market value. This paper is expected to reveal that how the Indian companies tend to reward better value to the shareholders that are measures the corporate valuation and encourages regulators to initiate further timely reforms to build a strong relationship between those who run the company and the stakeholders.\n\nDownload\n\nThe importance of financial statement is articulated by the role it plays for its users or stakeholders. The primary interest of users is to assess the fair value of shares by estimating and interpreting from financial reports. They use different models to capture the pulse of the firm to make sure of their investment prospects and use measures for valuation of the company. This paper aims to analyze different valuation models and interrogates the conjecture around the company valuation and estimation of measures particularly at the time of crisis that provokes the debate about the reliability of financial statements. The paper concludes that for forecasting value, it is imperative to understand the economic factors, strategic choices made by the management such as choosing product, location, quality, R&D program, alliances but at the same time, it is correspondingly significant to look at the business conditions like legal, political and regulatory constraints.\n\nDownload\n\nProceedings of the 1st Unimed International Conference on Economics Education and Social Science, 2018\n\nDownload\n\nJournal of Business Valuation and Economic Loss Analysis, 2017\n\nThe discounted cash flow model (DCFM) views the intrinsic value of common stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows. This paper analyses whether the equity terminal value (EqTV) of the firm calculated by fundamentals is appreciated by the market. It also studies the impact of variations in EqTV and the extent to which the market perceives these variations. Using a sample of 62 Spanish listed companies, this paper shows that EqTV and its variations are positively and significantly correlated with EqTV assigned by the market and its corresponding variations. It therefore corroborates the validity and relevance of the valuation model.\n\nDownload"
