        "text": "Tag: Moroccan Israelis\n\nMoroccan-Israelis party with Sharaka visitors\n\nThe current crisis has not deterred a group of young Moroccans from visiting Israel. During their tour, they were addressed in their dialect of darija and had a spontaneous party with evacuees of Moroccan origin in their hotel. Report in the Jerusalem Post:\n\nA delegation of 23 Moroccan young leaders, influencers, professionals, academics, and civil society activists visited Israel as a part of Sharaka’s flagship program to promote tolerance through Holocaust education in the Arab and Muslim world.\n\nThe delegation visited Israel this past week, “a cohort of brave young Moroccans who have chosen to come to Israel as courageous statement in support of Israel-Morocco relations and Jewish-Muslim coexistence in a time when anti-Israel sentiment in the Arab and Muslim world is tense and volatile following the October 7 attack and ongoing war in Gaza,” as the non-governmental organization phrased it.\n\nDuring their week-long journey throughout Israel, the delegation visited the historic and holy sites of Jerusalem, met with experts and community leaders, connected to the Israeli hi-tech scene, and heard from Israeli officials, including Knesset Speaker of Moroccan roots Amir Ohana, and former National Security Council Meir Ben Shabat who gave an entire lecture in the Moroccan dialect.\n\nThe group also toured sites of the October 7 terror attacks to gain learn of the current war and geopolitical picture. Their visit focused on an extensive seminar at Yad Vashem, Israel’s national Holocaust Museum and education institute, where they engaged in a series of in-person and online lectures and conversations, about the Holocaust, extremism, genocides in modern history, and what we can do in our societies to promote tolerance. The program was conducted with the assistance of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which is sponsored by the Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” and supported by the German Federal Ministry of Finance.\n\nSharaka, which means “partnership” in Arabic, is a non-governmental, non-profit and apolitical project, established by social entrepreneurs from the Arab world and Israel to promote warm peace between people. It is jointly led from its offices in Israel, Bahrain and Morocco, and has advisors and volunteers from around the Arab and Muslim world and throughout the US and Europe. The organization sees itself as a “peace start-up” platform for people to people engagement, dialogue and collaborations, working to promote the Abraham Accords concept regionally and internationally.\n\nIn a typical Israeli coincidence, the hotel where the delegation stayed also hosted families of displaced Israelis from Shlomi on the northern border, a community renowned for its Moroccan origins. When the northern guests-turned-half-residents learned of the origin of the delegation, a spontaneous hafla (part) erupted all of a sudden with dancing and singing, as if siblings separated at birth encountered each other after years of separation. Videos of the dancing and singing went viral on Israeli social media and soon enough found their way to Moroccan outlets as well, bringing with it an expected wave of criticism, yet despite first feelings of stress, the young participants braved the event and kept on dancing.\n\nRead article in full\n\nMizrahi trailblazer David Levy dies\n\nDavid Levy, Moroccan-born Likud minister and trailblazer for Mizrahim in Israel, has died aged 86. He favoured integration into the political establishment and played a part in the rise of the Mizrahi middle class, The Times of Israel reports:\n\nFollowing a landslide victory in 1977 for Begin’s Herut party (precursor to today’s Likud), boosted by Levy’s appeal to Mizrahi voters, he was able to leverage his proximity to the Mizrahi working class and act as an intermediary between it and the prime minister.\n\nPreceded by more radical Mizrahi movements such as the Israeli Black Panthers, which made waves in the 1970s without much electoral success, Levy favored integration into the Israeli political establishment.\n\nLevy’s effort to secure economic benefits for Mizrahi communities is perhaps the most enduring aspect of his legacy. Likud’s resulting success in creating a Mizrahi middle class solidified the community as its core constituency, an electoral trend that continues to this day.\n\n“Polls showed enormous support for the Panthers, but people were not prepared to vote for them. The person who identified this was David Levy, who was until then almost unknown,” explained Sami Shalom-Chetrit, a scholar of Mizrahi social movements, to Davar Magazine in 2021. “There is no David Levy without the Panthers, there is no Likud as a popular movement without the Panthers.”\n\nDuring his tenure as construction and housing minister in Begin’s first government, Levy alleviated housing shortages in Mizrahi neighborhoods in Jerusalem by incentivizing young couples to relocate to settlements in the occupied territories in the West Bank.\n\nRead article in full\n\nMimouna becomes more and more popular\n\nFive years ago, Shmuel Rosner wrote this Jewish Journal article to explain how a Moroccan-Jewish tradition – a party to mark the end of Passover – is now celebrated by 38 percent of all Israelis. The percentage might even be higher today:\n\nThis process is evident in the waning of some “ethnic” traditions, such as the tradition of refraining from eating kitniyot during Passover (see graph, right). It’s also evident in the spread of “ethnic” traditions. While Ashkenazic Jews are losing the ethnic battle over kitniyot (probably for their own good), another group is winning the battle over another ethnic custom: Mimouna. This festival ceased being merely an “ethnic” custom long ago. It is a national holiday. So much so, that in 2016, then-Environment Minister Avi Gabbay decided to exempt Mimouna (like Independence Day) from the general ban on making noise after 11 p.m. Mimouna celebrations, which include late-night ululations, received an official stamp of approval.\n\nMimouna is an end-of-Passover tradition that was imported to Israel by a minority. A “marginal, sectarian” festival that received the “status of a national holiday, partly religious, partly civil,” as Rachel Shabi wrote in a book on the subject. Moroccan immigrants celebrated it in their homes until someone had the idea to take it public in the mid-1960s. Initially a few hundred came, then thousands, then tens and hundreds of thousands, and with them the politicians, who understood the electoral power represented by the revelers.\n\n“Moroccan immigrants celebrated Mimouna in their homes until someone had the idea to take it public in the mid-1960s.”\n\nAt some point, the celebrations turned mainstream in a way that made some keepers of the ethnic traditions uncomfortable. These people — a minority — started complaining of too quick a switch “from the erasure of a culture to its appropriation.” They argued that at first Israel pushed the Moroccan immigrants and their culture to the margins, but then was seduced by the smell of mufletot — the traditional Mimouna pancakes — to appropriate this part of the culture.\n\nAround half a million Moroccan immigrants, whether first- or second-generation, live in Israel today. This corresponds with our finding that one-tenth of Jews in Israel (9%) say they “host Mimouna at home.”\n\nAround half of the hosts also “wear traditional dress” on Mimouna (4%). These are the numbers that represent a traditional “ethnic” holiday. Mimouna, however, requires not only hosts but also guests. In Morocco, Jews used to invite their Muslim neighbors to Mimouna. In modern Israel, they invite their Jewish compatriots from other communities, who are not fortunate enough to have such a beautiful festival of their own.\n\nTherefore, almost 4 in 10 Israelis attend Mimouna (38%). More than one quarter of Ashkenazic Jews report that they attend Mimouna (27%). A similar proportion of Jews from the former Soviet Union report the same (28%). That’s not to mention Mizrahi Jews (48%) and Israelis from mixed families (43%). A simple calculation of hosts and guests reveals that almost half of Israel’s Jewish population celebrates Mimouna.\n\nRead article in full\n\nMore about Mimouna\n\nHusband of ‘Rachel Cookies’ dies\n\nRachel Edery and her husband David were among the heroes of 7 October. They kept five Hamas terrorists talking for hours in their Ofakim home until the security forces arrived. Now David has passed away, aged 68, probably due to the trauma he experienced. Ynet News reports:\n\nAs Israeli news reported yesterday, none of that really made a difference for her husband, David. During the nineteen hours that she and her husband were held, something broke in David Edri. After he and his wife were saved by Israel’s Counterterrorism Unit, they were physically safe, and she became a bit of a folk hero. But not David. He didn’t speak, rebuffed anyone who tried to engage him.\n\nHe died yesterday at the age of 68 and was buried in the cemetery of Ofakim, where he had lived, and where he had been held hostage in his own home.\n\nHow many people were killed on October 7? What we know is that we don’t know. We know how many people were physically murdered that day. What we do not yet know is how many people died, but are still walking the earth.\n\nRead article in full (Hebrew)\n\nCharlie Biton, Black Panther activist, has died\n\nOne of the founders of the 1970s Black Panther movement in Israel has died, aged 76. Charlie Biton was born in Casablanca, Morocco, one of six children. His family moved to Israel in 1949 when he was two years old. He grew up in the Musrara neighbourhood of Jerusalem and attended an ORT vocational school. In early 1971 he founded the Israeli Black Panthers along with Sa’adia Marciano, Reuven Abergel and Eli Avichzer. The Times of Israel reports:\n\nAs a radical activist and later a Knesset member, Biton was the face of a movement that forced a national reckoning starting in the 1970s on long-entrenched discrimination against Jews of North African and Middle Eastern extraction, pushing the government to address pervasive economic inequality and disenfranchisement in politics, academia and other walks of life at the hands of the country’s Ashkenazi European elite.\n\nBiton lived in the Jerusalem suburb of Mevasseret Zion at the time of his passing. He is survived by a wife, children and grandchildren.\n\nNo cause of death was announced, but Biton’s health had deteriorated steadily since 2021, when he suffered complications from a botched neck surgery that burst one of his blood vessels.\n\nThough Biton’s Black Panthers never mobilized enough support to succeed electorally, many credit the movement with paving the way for the success of future Sephardi and Mizrahi political organizing, in particular the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.\n\nRead article in full\n\nJTA article\n\nMore about the Black Panthers\n\nFilm explores story of a child with two mothers\n\nIn Morocco, Jewish families had the custom of giving away a child to a couple who could not conceive. This creates rivalry between the biological and adoptive mothers, tensions between the families, and a confused sense of identity for the child. A new film, Seven Blessings (Sheva Brakhot) explores these questions. The film has been put forward as Israel’s official entry for Best Foreign Language film in the Oscars. Here’s a taster from the Times of Israel:\n\nIn the film, the bride, Marie (Raymonde Amsellem), is marrying into a French Ashkenazi family. Much of the film takes place over the course of the “seven blessings,” the ritual meals hosted during the post-wedding week by the couple’s siblings and matriarchs.\n\nThe crux of the sometimes humorous, intimate film is to explore a situation in which Moroccan families once gave away children to relatives who couldn’t conceive.\n\nThe film’s character of Marie (Amsellem) was raised from the age of two by her aunt Grazia, played by Rivka Bachar, and away from her mother, Hanna, played by Tiki Dayan, who won her first Ophir for her supporting actress role in the same film.\n\nRead article in full\n\nVideo demolishes myth of peaceful coexistence\n\n“It’s the most important video I have ever made,’ says Israeli tour guide Oren Pinto. He began making videos in 2022 called ‘Travelling Israel’ and has thousands of followers. Here he tackles the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Arab countries (with thanks: Laurence):\n\nFor Pinto this video, about the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Arab countries, is personal: his family came from Morocco.\n\nHe begins by demolishing the ‘false narrative’ that Jews and Muslims lived in peace and harmony before the establishment of Israel. There were forced conversions, Jewish homes were looted, their residents murdered and women raped during numerous pogroms. He pauses with a swipe against Youtube’s community guidelines: the ‘r’ word cannot be uttered on Youtube for fear of upsetting its sensitive viewers.\n\nCommunities which had tens or hundreds of thousands of Jews are now down to single figures, or have no Jews at all.\n\nPinto has strong words to say about Israelis: they may be able to name two or three ethnic dishes, but they do not know their own family history. Parents and grandparents have idealised life back in the old country in order to protect their children and memory has a tendency to gloss over the more unpleasant experiences. For instance, Jews in Morocco were rich and all knew the king. Pinto urges his viewers to interview their relatives and write down their history before it’s too late.\n\nThe intimate, yet distant, relationship of Berber Jews and Muslims\n\nShluh is a derogatory word, meaning a sloppy and dirty person. It was brought to Israel by westernised, urban Moroccan Jews and originally described Berber (Amazigh) Jews, who shared thousands of years of history and culture with their Muslim neighbours. Fascinating article by Chen Malul in The Librarians (with thanks: Michelle) :\n\n(The journalist Charles) Abehsera, a young representative of the Western Moroccan Jews, distanced himself from the “shluh”, whom he viewed as a dirty and undesirable individual who spoke neither Arabic nor French, but only the Berber language. The “Young Israel” section of L’Avenir Illustré was read by the Jewish youth in Morocco who typically received a French education in the Jewish Alliance schools. These young boys and girls spoke French and identified with European Western values more than with traditional Moroccan values​.\n\nAbehsera certainly did not invent the term “shluh,” but he used it to differentiate himself and his community from the newcomers who were moving into the city from the rural areas. Incidentally, the word “Berber” also stems from a pejorative term. The Berbers call themselves “Amaziye’im” (“Imaziye’in” meaning “freemen”). However, the word Berber derives from the ancient Greek word Barbaros (βάρβαρος), which the Greeks used to refer to anyone who did not speak Greek.\n\nRegardless of the young Abehsera’s views and the desire of many of Morocco’s urban Jews to differentiate themselves from the Berber-speaking Jews, it is important to understand that until the Jews left Morocco, half of the country’s population (Muslim and Jewish) spoke Berber as a first or second language. After Morocco’s independence and the introduction of a state education system, this number dropped to about 30 percent. Most of the Berber-speaking Jews spoke the Tashelhit dialect, and for some (for example the people of Tifnit in the Souss Valley region) Tashelhit was their mother tongue at least until the French occupation. The French protectorate’s road-building efforts connected the villages to the larger cities, which led to the migration of rural populations to urban centers. The slanderous label was an outcome of the city folk’s encounter with the villagers.\n\nThe complex relationship between the Jews and their Shilha neighbors is an important part of the story of Moroccan immigration to Israel, just as it is part of Morocco’s history. The two groups not only lived side by side in the same villages for perhaps thousands of years, but also shared beliefs and customs, such as veneration of local saints, folk medicine and a whole repertoire of Berber song, dance, folk tales and sayings. Therefore, the dismissal of Shilha culture and the disdain towards it — which began already in Morocco — serve to undermine a significant element of North African Jewish culture.\n\nDespite the complex and delicate relations that existed between the neighboring populations, the Jews and Berbers have come to embrace their common past. The Jews’ departure from Morocco severely impacted the Berber and Shilha rural economy for years. Before the establishment of formal relations between Israel and Morocco, nostalgia for these bygone relations led to the idealization of Jewish life in the villages and towns in Morocco in the past. Today, with travel to Morocco now possible, Israelis of Moroccan origin can see for themselves the living conditions in the villages and renew the ties forged over the generations between their ancestors and the Amaziye’in.\n\nRead article in full"
