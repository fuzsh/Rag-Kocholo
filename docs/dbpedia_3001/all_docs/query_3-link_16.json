        "text": "Renal lymph nodes for tumor staging: appraisal of 871 nephrectomies with examination of hilar fat.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehta, Vikas; Mudaliar, Kumaran; Ghai, Ritu; Quek, Marcus L; Milner, John; Flanigan, Robert C; Picken, Maria M\n\n2013-11-01\n\nDespite decades of research, the role of lymphadenectomy in the management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still not clearly defined. Before the implementation of targeted therapies, lymph node metastases were considered to be a portent of markedly decreased survival, regardless of the tumor stage. However, the role of lymphadenectomy and the relative benefit of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in the context of modern adjunctive therapies have not been conclusively addressed in the clinical literature. The current pathologic literature does not offer clear recommendations with regard to the minimum number of lymph nodes that should be examined in order to accurately stage the pN in renal cell carcinoma. Although gross examination of the hilar fat to assess the nodal status is performed routinely, it has not yet been determined whether this approach is adequate. To evaluate the status of lymph nodes and their rate of identification in the pathologic examination of nephrectomy specimens in adult renal malignancies. We reviewed the operative and pathology reports of 871 patients with renal malignancies treated by nephrectomy. All tumors were classified according to the seventh edition of the Tumor-Nodes-Metastasis classification. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Nx, no lymph nodes recovered; N0, negative; and N1, with positive lymph nodes. Grossly visible lymph nodes were submitted separately; as per grossing protocol, hilar fatty tissue was submitted for microscopic examination. We evaluated the factors that affected the number of lymph nodes identified and the variables that allowed the prediction of nodal involvement. Lymph nodes were recovered in 333 of 871 patients (38%): hilar in 125 patients, nonhilar in 137 patients, and hilar and nonhilar in 71 patients. Patients with positive lymph nodes (n = 87) were younger, had larger primary tumors, and had lymph nodes of average size, as well as a higher pT stage, nuclear grade, and rate of metastases\n\nInvestigating Associations Between Proliferation Indices, C-kit, and Lymph Node Stage in Canine Mast Cell Tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrick, Erika Lauren; Kiupel, Matti; Durham, Amy C; Thaiwong, Tuddow; Brown, Dorothy C; Sorenmo, Karin U\n\nPrevious studies have evaluated cellular proliferation indices, KIT expression, and c-kit mutations to predict the clinical behavior of canine mast cell tumors (MCTs). The study purpose was to retrospectively compare mitotic index, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs)/nucleus, Ki-67 index, KIT labeling pattern, and internal tandem duplication mutations in c-KIT between stage I and stage II grade II MCTs. Medical records and tumor biopsy samples from dogs with Grade II MCTs with cytological or histopathological regional lymph node evaluation were included. Signalment, tumor location and stage, and presence of a recurrent versus de novo tumor were recorded. Mitotic index, AgNORs/nucleus, Ki-67, KIT staining pattern, and internal tandem duplication mutations in exon 11 of c-KIT were evaluated. Sixty-six tumors (51 stage I; 15 stage II) were included. Only AgNORs/nucleus and recurrent tumors were significantly associated with stage (odds ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.0, P = .049; odds ratio 8.8, 95% CI 1.1-69.5; P = .039). Receiver-operator characteristic analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of AgNORs/cell â¥ 1.87 were 93.3% and 27.4%, respectively, (area under the curve: 0.65) for predicting stage. Recurrent tumors and higher AgNORs/nucleus are associated with stage II grade II MCTs; however, an AgNOR cutoff value that reliably predicts lymph node metastasis was not determined.\n\nComparison of four staging systems of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Ming; Zhu, Guanyu; Ma, Yan; Xue, Yingwei\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThe classification of lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer is still controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the relative merits of four staging systems of lymph node metastasis. In our study, the nodal status was classified according to the 5th edition of the tumor node metastasis (TNM) system, the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (JCGC), the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes, and the size of the largest metastatic lymph node. Each staging system was scored as good (+2), fair (+1), or poor (0) with respect to the theoretical value (extent of the anatomical lymphatic tumor spread), convenience (simplicity), surgical applicability (extent of lymph node dissection), and prognostic value (ability to predict survival rate). In the multivariate analysis including the four staging systems and other potential prognostic factors, stepwise Cox regression revealed that the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes was the most independent prognostic factor. The TNM, ratio, and size systems were convenient because they had no consideration for the location of the tumor and lymph node. Although the JCGC system had advantages in theoretical value and surgical application, it was most optional due to the complexity of the system. Although all different staging systems are comparable, the metastatic lymph node ratio system is convenient, reproducible, and has the highest ability to predict survival.\n\nContribution of lymph node staging method and prognostic factors in malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors: A world wide database analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jieyu; Li, Jun; Chen, Ruifang; Lu, Xin\n\n2018-07-01\n\nTo investigate the clinicopathologic prognostic factors in patients with malignant sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) with lymph node dissection, and at the same time, to evaluate the influence of the log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) on their survival. Patients diagnosed with malignant SCSTs who underwent lymph node dissection were extracted from the 1988-2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify independent predictors of survival. 576 patients with malignant SCSTs and with lymphadenectomy were identified, including 468 (81.3%) patients with granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) and 80 (13.9%) patients with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCTs). 399 (69.3%) patients and 118 (20.5%) patients were in the LODDSÂ <Â -1 group andÂ -1Â â¤Â LODDSÂ <Â -0.5 group, respectively. The 10-year OS rate was 80.9% and CSS was 87.2% in the LODDSÂ <Â -0.5 group, whereas the survival rates for other groups were 68.5% and 73.3%. On multivariate analysis, age 50 years or less (pÂ <Â 0.001), tumor size of 10Â cm or less (pÂ <Â 0.001), early-stage disease (pÂ <Â 0.001), and GCT histology (pÂ â¤Â 0.001) were the significant prognostic factors for improved survival. LODDSÂ <Â -0.5 was associated with a favorable prognosis (OS: pÂ =Â 0.051; CSS:PÂ =Â 0.055). Younger age, smaller tumor size, early stage, and GCT histologic type are independent prognostic factors for improved survival in patients with malignant SCST with lymphadenectomy. Stratified LODDS could be regarded as an effective value to assess the lymph node status, and to predict the survival status of patients.

Nevertheless, the extent of the primary tumor resection and the necessity of a neck dissection still is a common issue. Since little is known about lymph node metastasis in early-stage parotid gland cancer, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of lymph node metastases in T1 and T2 carcinomas and its impact on local control and survival. We retrospectively analyzed 70 patients with early-stage (T1 and T2) primary parotid gland cancer. All patients were treated with parotidectomy and an ipsilateral neck dissection from 1987 to 2009. Clinicopathological and survival parameters were calculated. The median follow-up time was 51.7 months. A positive pathological lymph node stage (pN+) was found in 21.4% of patients with a significant correlation to the clinical lymph node stage (cN) (p = 0.061). There were no differences in the clinical and histopathological data between pN- and pN+ patients. In 73.3% of pN+ patients, the metastases were located intraparotideal. The incidence of occult metastases (pN+/cN-) was 17.2%. Of all patients with occult metastases, 30.0% had extraparotideal lymphatic spread. A positive lymph node stage significantly indicated a poorer 5-year overall as well as 5-year disease-free survival rate compared to pN- patients (p = 0.048; p = 0.011). We propose total parotidectomy in combination with at least a level II-III selective neck dissection in any case of early-stage parotid gland cancer.\n\nLymph node metastasis in grossly apparent clinical stage Ia epithelial ovarian cancer: Hacettepe experience and review of literature\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Lymphadenectomy is an integral part of the staging system of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the extent of lymphadenectomy in the early stages of ovarian cancer is controversial. The objective of this study was to identify the lymph node involvement in unilateral epithelial ovarian cancer apparently confined to the one ovary (clinical stage Ia). Methods A prospective study of clinical stage I ovarian cancer patients is presented. Patient's characteristics and tumor histopathology were the variables evaluated. Results Thirty three ovarian cancer patients with intact ovarian capsule were evaluated. Intraoperatively, neither of the patients had surface involvement, adhesions, ascites or palpable lymph nodes (supposed to be clinical stage Ia). The mean age of the study group was 55.3 Â± 11.8. All patients were surgically staged and have undergone a systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Final surgicopathologic reports revealed capsular involvement in seven patients (21.2%), contralateral ovarian involvement in two (6%) and omental metastasis in one (3%) patient. There were two patients (6%) with lymph node involvement. One of the two lymph node metastasis was solely in paraaortic node and the other metastasis was in ipsilateral pelvic lymph node. Ovarian capsule was intact in all of the patients with lymph node involvement and the tumor was grade 3. Conclusion In clinical stage Ia ovarian cancer patients, there may be a risk of paraaortic and pelvic lymph node metastasis. Further studies with larger sample size are needed for an exact conclusion.

The micrometastases have been studied as prognostic factor in gastric cancer, which are related to decrease overall survival and increased risk of recurrence. However, their identification is limited by conventional methodology, since they can be overlooked after routine staining. To investigate the presence of occult tumor cells using cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3 immunostaining in gastric cancer patients histologically lymph node negative (pN0) by H&E. Forty patients (T1-T4N0) submitted to a potentially curative gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy were evaluated. The results for metastases, micrometastases and isolated tumor cells were also associated to clinicopathological characteristics and their impact on stage grouping. Tumor deposits within lymph nodes were defined according to the tumor-node-metastases guidelines (7th TNM). A total of 1439 lymph nodes were obtained (~36 per patient). Tumor cells were detected by immunohistochemistry in 24 lymph nodes from 12 patients (30%). Neoplasic cells were detected as a single or cluster tumor cells. Tumor (p=0.002), venous (p=0.016), lymphatic (p=0.006) and perineural invasions (p=0.04), as well as peritumoral lymphocytic response (p=0.012) were correlated to CK-positive immunostaining tumor cells in originally negative lymph nodes by H&E. The histologic stage of two patients was upstaged from stage IB to stage IIA. Four of the 28 CK-negative patients (14.3%) and three among 12 CK-positive patients (25%) had disease recurrence (p=0.65). The CK-immunostaining is an effective method for detecting occult tumor cells in lymph nodes and may be recommended to precisely determine tumor stage. It may be useful as supplement to H&E routine to provide better pathological staging.

Since the ascertainment of breast cancer stage determines the following treatment, such a \"hypo-diagnosis\" leads to inadequate therapy, and hence is detrimental for the outcome and survival of the patients. The purpose of our study was to investigate functional metabolic characteristics of living cells derived from metastatic and tumor-free lymph nodes of breast cancer (BC) patients. Our methodology is based on the ability of living cells to hydrolyze fluorescein diacetate (FDA) by intracellular esterases and on the association of FDA hydrolysis rates with a specific cell status, both in physiological and pathological conditions. The present study demonstrates a significant difference in the ability to utilize FDA by lymph node cells derived from metastatic and tumor-free lymph nodes in general average, as well as in the metastatic and tumor-free lymph nodes of individual patients. Cells from metastatic lymph nodes had a higher capacity for FDA hydrolysis, and increased this activity after additional activation by autologous tumor tissue (tt). The association between increased FDA hydrolysis rate and activated T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APC) was shown. The results of the present study may contribute to predicting the risk of involvement of seemingly \"tumor-free\" axillary lymph nodes in occult metastatic processes, and to reducing false-negative results of axillary examination.\n\n[Correlation factors of lymph node metastasis in patients with clinical stage T1a non-small cell lung cancer].\n\nPubMed\n\nRuochuan, Zang; Shugeng, Guo; Jie, He; Yousheng, Mao; Qi, Xue; Dali, Wang; Juwei, Mu; Jun, Zhao; Yonggang, Wang; Xiangyang, Liu; Fengwei, Tan; Gefei, Zhao; Qian, Zhang; Moyan, Zhang; Peng, Song\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTo explore the relationship between the lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological features in patients with clinical stage T1a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinicopathological data of a total of 418 patients who underwent lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological features. Lymph node metastasis was observed in 25 patients. There were 122 patients who were diagnosed as ground glass opacity with no lymph node metastasis. 399 patients had subcarinal dissection, among them 7 patients were found to have lymph node metastasis. Univariate analysis showed that gender, smoking history, diameter of lymph node, ground glass opacity (GGO), differentiation of the tumor and tumor site were the factors affecting lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that diameter of lymph node, differentiation of the tumor and the site of lesion were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis of NSCLC. Tumor in the left lung, poor differentiation, and diameter of lymph nodes â¥ 1 cm on the preoperative CT image are independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis of NSCLC, hence we should pay attention before surgery and systematic lymph node dissection should be done. For patients with poor differentiation and lymph nodes â¥ 1 cm, subcarinal lymph nodes dissection is recommended for the sake of higher possibility of lymph node metastasis. For patients with ground glass opacity â¤ 2 cm, the lymph node metastasis is extremely rare, therefore, selective lymph node dissection is reconmmended.\n\nImmune response in melanoma: an in-depth analysis of the primary tumor and corresponding sentinel lymph node\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMa, Michelle W.; Medicherla, Ratna C.; Qian, Meng; de Miera, Eleazar Vega-Saenz; Friedman, Erica B.; Berman, Russell S.; Shapiro, Richard L.; Pavlick, Anna C.; Ott, Patrick A.; Bhardwaj, Nina; Shao, Yongzhao; Osman, Iman; Darvishian, Farbod\n\n2013-01-01\n\nusing clinical stage.

Methods We used a dataset of de-identified breast MRIs organized by the National Cancer Institute in The Cancer Imaging Archive. We analyzed 91 biopsy-proven breast cancer cases with pathologic stage (stage I = 22; stage II = 58; stage III = 11) and surgically proven nodal status (negative nodes = 46, â¥ 1 positive node = 44, no nodes examined = 1). We characterized tumors by (a) radiologist measured size, and (b) CEIP. We built models combining two CEIPs to predict tumor pathologic stage and lymph node involvement, evaluated them in leave-one-out cross-validation with area under the ROC curve (AUC) as figure of merit. Results Tumor size was the most powerful predictor of pathologic stage but CEIPs capturing biologic behavior also emerged as predictive (e.g. stage I+II vs. III demonstrated AUC = 0.83). No size measure was successful in the prediction of positive lymph nodes but adding a CEIP describing tumor âhomogeneity,â significantly improved this discrimination (AUC = 0.62, p=.003) over chance. Conclusions Our results indicate that MRI phenotypes show promise for predicting breast cancer pathologic stage and lymph node status.

We explored the prognostic effect of LAG-3 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in NSCLC and its potential for inclusion in an immunoscore, supplementing the TNM classification. Primary tumor tissue from 553 stage I-IIIB NSCLC patients and 143 corresponding metastatic lymph nodes were collected. The expression of LAG-3 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. On univariate analysis, LAG-3 + TILs in the intraepithelial and stromal compartments of primary tumors and in the intraepithelial and extraepithelial compartments of metastatic lymph nodes were associated with improved disease-specific survival (DSS). On multivariate analysis, stromal LAG-3 + TILs were a significant independent predictor of improved DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.82; PÂ = .002). Stromal LAG-3 + TILs did not have prognostic impact across all pathologic stages. In the metastatic lymph nodes, intraepithelial (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.99; PÂ = .049) and extraepithelial (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70; PÂ < .001) LAG-3 + TILs were independently associated with favorable DSS. LAG-3 + TILs are an independent positive prognostic factor in stage I-IIIB NSCLC. LAG-3 in metastatic lymph nodes is a candidate marker for an immunoscore in NSCLC. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, US-guided FNA was performed in 27 patients with early-stage breast cancer for comparison with SNB. Data were analyzed by calculation of sample proportions. Tumor subtypes included invasive ductal carcinoma (85%), invasive lobular carcinoma (7%), and tubular and metaplastic carcinoma (4%). FNA had a sensitivity of 45%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 73%. Axillary lymph node cytology obtained by US guided-FNA in patients with breast cancer had a specificity similar to that of sentinel lymph node histopathology in the presence of axillary node metastases. However, when lymph node cytology is negative, it does not exclude the existence of metastatic implants, due to its low sensitivity in comparison to sentinel lymph node histopathology.

Interobserver variability for the different tumor size measurements was also assessed. Preoperative pelvic MRI of 212 patients with histologically confirmed endometrial carcinomas was read independently by 3 radiologists. Maximum tumor diameters were measured in 3 orthogonal planes (anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal planes [CC]), and tumor volumes were estimated. Tumor size was analyzed in relation to surgical staging results and patient survival. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for preoperative risk status based on endometrial biopsy. Intraclass correlation coefficients and receiver operating characteristics curves for the different tumor measurements were also calculated. Anteroposterior tumor diameter independently predicted deep myometrial invasion (P < 0.001), whereas CC tumor diameter tended to independently predict lymph node metastases (P = 0.06). Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, the following tumor size cutoff values were identified: anteroposterior diameter greater than 2 cm predicted deep myometrial invasion (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 12.4; P < 0.001; adjusted OR, 6.7; P < 0.001) and CC diameter greater than 4 cm predicted lymph node metastases (unadjusted OR, 6.2; P < 0.001; adjusted OR, 4.9; P = 0.009). Large tumor size was associated with reduced progression/recurrence-free survival (P â¤ 0.005 for all size parameters), and CC diameter had an independent impact on survival (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.04; P = 0.009). The interobserver variability for the different size measurements was very low (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.78-0.85). Anteroposterior tumor diameter greater than 2 cm\n\nDetection of Wilms' tumor antigen--specific CTL in tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with early breast cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nGillmore, Roopinder; Xue, Shao-An; Holler, Angelika; Kaeda, Jaspal; Hadjiminas, Dimitri; Healy, Vourneen; Dina, Roberto; Parry, Suzanne C; Bellantuono, Ilaria; Ghani, Yasmeen; Coombes, R Charles; Waxman, Jonathan; Stauss, Hans J\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Wilms' tumor antigen (WT1) is overexpressed in approximately 90% of breast tumors and, thus, is a potential target antigen for the immunotherapy of breast cancer. We have tested the working hypotheses that WT1 can be immunogenic in patients with breast cancer and can stimulate CTL of sufficient avidity to kill tumor cells. Paired tumor-draining lymph node and peripheral blood samples were analyzed from five HLA-A2-positive patients with stage I/II breast cancer. Fluorescent HLA-A*0201/WT1 tetramers were used to quantify WT1-specific CTL and the functional capacity of the CTL was assessed using cytotoxicity assays and intracellular cytokine staining. WT1 tetramer-binding T cells expanded from all lymph node samples but none of the corresponding peripheral blood samples. Functional assays were carried out on T cells from the patient who had yielded the highest frequency of HLA-A*0201/WT1 tetramer-positive cells. The cytotoxicity assays showed WT1 peptide--specific killing activity of the CTL, whereas intracellular cytokine staining confirmed that the tetramer--positive T cells produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with WT1 peptide. These WT1-specific T cells killed HLA-A2-positive breast cancer cell lines treated with IFN-gamma but no killing was observed with untreated tumor cells. These results show that WT1-specific CTL can be expanded from the tumor-draining lymph nodes of breast cancer patients and that they can display peptide-specific effector function. However, the CTL only killed IFN-gamma-treated tumor targets expressing high levels of HLA-A2 and not tumor cells with low HLA expression. This suggests that induction of autologous WT1-specific CTL may offer only limited tumor protection and that strategies that allow a high level of peptide/MHC complex presentation and/or improve CTL avidity may be required.\n\nHistologic pattern of Merkel cell carcinoma sentinel lymph node metastasis improves stratification of Stage III patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKo, Jennifer S; Prieto, Victor G; Elson, Paul; Vilain, Ricardo E; Pulitzer, Melissa; Scolyer, Richard A; Reynolds, Jordan P; Piliang, Melissa; Ernstoff, Marc S; Gastman, Brian; Billings, Steven D\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy is used to stage Merkel cell carcinoma, but its prognostic value has been questioned. Furthermore, predictors of outcome in sentinel lymph node positive Merkel cell carcinoma patients are poorly defined. In breast carcinoma, isolated immunohistochemically positive tumor cells have no impact, but in melanoma they are considered significant. The significance of sentinel lymph node metastasis tumor burden (including isolated tumor cells) and pattern of involvement in Merkel cell carcinoma are unknown. In this study, 64 Merkel cell carcinomas involving sentinel lymph nodes and corresponding immunohistochemical stains were reviewed and clinicopathologic predictors of outcome were sought. Five metastatic patterns were identified: 1, sheet-like (n=38, 59%); 2, non-solid parafollicular (n=4, 6%); 3, sinusoidal, (n=11, 17%); 4, perivascular hilar (n=1, 2%) and 5, rare scattered parenchymal cells (n=10, 16%). At the time of follow-up, 30/63 (48%) patients had died with 21(33%) attributable to Merkel cell carcinoma. Patients with pattern 1 metastases had poorer overall survival compared with patients with patterns 2â5 metastases (p=0.03), with 22/30 (73%) deaths occurring in pattern 1 patients. 3 (10%) deaths occurred in patients showing pattern 5, all of whom were immunosuppressed. 4 (13%) deaths occurred in pattern 3 patients and 1 (3%) death occurred in a pattern 2 patient.

In this study, 64 Merkel cell carcinomas involving sentinel lymph nodes and corresponding immunohistochemical stains were reviewed and clinicopathological predictors of outcome were sought. Five metastatic patterns were identified: (1) sheet-like (n=38, 59%); (2) non-solid parafollicular (n=4, 6%); (3) sinusoidal, (n=11, 17%); (4) perivascular hilar (n=1, 2%); and (5) rare scattered parenchymal cells (n=10, 16%). At the time of follow-up, 30/63 (48%) patients had died with 21 (33%) attributable to Merkel cell carcinoma. Patients with pattern 1 metastases had poorer overall survival compared with patients with patterns 2-5 metastases (P=0.03), with 22/30 (73%) deaths occurring in pattern 1 patients. Three (10%) deaths occurred in patients showing pattern 5, all of whom were immunosuppressed. Four (13%) deaths occurred in pattern 3 patients and 1 (3%) death occurred in a pattern 2 patient. In multivariable analysis, the number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (1 or 2 versus >2, P<0.0001), age (<70 versus â¥70, P=0.01), sentinel lymph node metastasis pattern (patterns 2-5 versus 1, P=0.02), and immune status (immunocompetent versus suppressed, P=0.03) were independent predictors of outcome, and could be used to stratify Stage III patients into three groups with markedly different outcomes. In Merkel cell carcinoma, the pattern of sentinel lymph node involvement provides important prognostic information and utilizing this data with other\n\nEarly diagnosis of lymph node metastasis: Importance of intranodal pressures.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiura, Yoshinobu; Mikada, Mamoru; Ouchi, Tomoki; Horie, Sachiko; Takeda, Kazu; Yamaki, Teppei; Sakamoto, Maya; Mori, Shiro; Kodama, Tetsuya\n\n2016-03-01\n\nRegional lymph node status is an important prognostic indicator of tumor aggressiveness. However, early diagnosis of metastasis using intranodal pressure, at a stage when lymph node size has not changed significantly, has not been investigated. Here, we use an MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr mouse model of lymph node metastasis to show that intranodal pressure increases in both the subiliac lymph node and proper axillary lymph node, which are connected by lymphatic vessels, when tumor cells are injected into the subiliac lymph node to induce metastasis to the proper axillary lymph node. We found that intranodal pressure in the subiliac lymph node increased at the stage when metastasis was detected by in vivo bioluminescence, but when proper axillary lymph node volume (measured by high-frequency ultrasound imaging) had not increased significantly. Intravenously injected liposomes, encapsulating indocyanine green, were detected in solid tumors by in vivo bioluminescence, but not in the proper axillary lymph node. Basic blood vessel and lymphatic channel structures were maintained in the proper axillary lymph node, although sinus histiocytosis was detected. These results show that intranodal pressure in the proper axillary lymph node increases at early stages when metastatic tumor cells have not fully proliferated. Intranodal pressure may be a useful parameter for facilitating early diagnosis of lymph node metastasis. Â© 2015 The Authors.

Jack; Barth, Richard J.; Kaufman, Peter A.; Hasan, Tayyaba; Pogue, Brian W.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLymph node biopsy (LNB) is employed in many cancer surgeries to identify metastatic disease and stage the cancer, yet morbidity and diagnostic delays associated with LNB could be avoided if non-invasive imaging of nodal involvement was reliable. Molecular imaging has potential in this regard; however, variable delivery and nonspecific uptake of imaging tracers has made conventional approaches ineffective clinically. A method of correcting for non-specific uptake with injection of a second untargeted tracer is presented, allowing tumor burden in lymph nodes to be quantified. The approach was confirmed in an athymic mouse model of metastatic human breast cancer targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, a cell surface receptor overexpressed by many cancers. A significant correlation was observed between in vivo (dual-tracer) and ex vivo measures of tumor burden (r = 0.97, p < 0.01), with an ultimate sensitivity of approximately 200 cells (potentially more sensitive than conventional LNB).

The paucity of lymph node yields in patients undergoing resection after preoperative chemo radiotherapy (CRT) in rectal cancer has seen. Lower total number of lymph nodes in the total mesoractal excision (TME) specimen after CRT, could a marker of better tumor response. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the prospectively managed data of patients underwent excision for rectal cancer, who treated by neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. From 2010 to 2014, 364 patients underwent rectal cancer surgery, of which ninety-one treated with neoadjuvant treatment. Standard surgical and pathological protocols were followed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the number of total harvested lymph nodes with group 1, having 12 or more nodes harvested, and group 2 including patients who had <12 lymph nodes harvested. The total number of lymph nodes retrieved from the surgical specimen was correlated with grade of tumor regression with neoadjuvant treatment. Results Out of 91 patients, 38 patients (42%) had less than 12 lymph nodes examined in specimen. The difference in median number of lymph nodes was observed significantly as 9 (range, 2â11) versus 16 (range, 12â32), in group 2 and 1, respectively (P<0.01). Patients with fewer lymph node group were comparable with respect to age, BMI, pre-operative staging, neoadjuvant treatment. Pathological complete response in tumor pCR was seen with significantly higher rate (40% vs. 26%, P<0.05) in group 2. As per Mandard criteria, there was significant difference in tumor regression grade (TRG) between both the groups (P<0.05). Among patients with metastatic lymph nodes, median LNR was lower in <12 lymph nodes group at 0.167 (range, 0.09â0.45) versus\n\nBinocular Goggle Augmented Imaging and Navigation System provides real-time fluorescence image guidance for tumor resection and sentinel lymph node mapping\n\nPubMed Central\n\nB.

While visible blue dyes are commonly used in locating sentinel lymph nodes, since they follow tumor-draining lymphatic vessels, they do not provide a metric to evaluate presence of cancer. An area of active research is to use fluorescent dyes to assess tumor burden of sentinel and secondary lymph nodes. The goal of this work was to successfully deploy and test an intra-nodal cancer-cell injection model to enable planar fluorescence imaging of a clinically relevant blue dye, specifically methylene blue along with a cancer targeting tracer, Affibody labeled with IRDYE800CW and subsequently segregate tumor-bearing from normal lymph nodes. This direct-injection based tumor model was employed in athymic rats (6 normal, 4 controls, 6 cancer-bearing), where luciferase-expressing breast cancer cells were injected into axillary lymph nodes. Tumor presence in nodes was confirmed by bioluminescence imaging before and after fluorescence imaging. Lymphatic uptake from the injection site (intradermal on forepaw) to lymph node was imaged at approximately 2 frames/minute. Large variability was observed within each cohort.\n\nContribution of diffusion weighted MRI to diagnosis and staging in gastric tumors and comparison with multi-detector computed tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nArslan, Harun; Fatih Ãzbay, Mehmet; ÃallÄ±, Ä°skan; DoÄan, Erkan; Ãelik, Sebahattin; Batur, Abdussamet; Bora, AydÄ±n; Yavuz, Alpaslan; Bulut, Mehmet Deniz; ÃzgÃ¶kÃ§e, Mesut; Ãetin Kotan, Mehmet\n\n2017-03-01\n\nDiagnostic performance of Diffusion-Weighted magnetic resonance Imaging (DWI) and Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) for TNM (Tumor, Lymph node, Metastasis) staging of gastric cancer was compared. We used axial T2-weighted images and DWI (b-0,400 and b-800 s/mm2) protocol on 51 pre-operative patients who had been diagnosed with gastric cancer. We also conducted MDCT examinations on them. We looked for a signal increase in the series of DWI images. The depth of tumor invasion in the stomach wall (tumor (T) staging), the involvement of lymph nodes (nodal (N) staging), and the presence or absence of metastases (metastatic staging) in DWI and CT images according to the TNM staging system were evaluated. In each diagnosis of the tumors, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative accuracy rates of DWI and MDCT examinations were found through a comparison with the results of the surgical pathology, which is the gold standard method. In addition to the compatibilities of each examination with surgical pathology, kappa statistics were used. Sensitivity and specificity of DWI and MDCT in lymph node staging were as follows: N1: DWI: 75.0%, 84.6%; MDCT: 66.7%, 82%;N2: DWI: 79.3%, 77.3%; MDCT: 69.0%, 68.2%; N3: DWI: 60.0%, 97.6%; MDCT: 50.0%, 90.2%. The diagnostic tool DWI seemed more compatible with the gold standard method (surgical pathology), especially in the staging of lymph node, when compared to MDCT. On the other hand, in T staging, the results of DWI and MDCT were better than the gold standard when the T stage increased. However, DWI did not demonstrate superiority to MDCT. The sensitivity and specificity of both imaging techniques for detecting distant metastasis were 100%. The diagnostic accuracy of DWI for TNM staging in gastric cancer before surgery is at a comparable level with MDCT and adding DWI to routine protocol of evaluating lymph nodes metastasis might increase diagnostic accuracy.\n\nStructural alterations in tumor-draining lymph nodes before papillary thyroid carcinoma metastasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHinson, Andrew M; Massoll, Nicole A; Jolly, Lee Ann; Stack, Brendan C; Bodenner, Donald L; Franco, Aime T\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to define and characterize the thyroid tumor-draining lymph nodes in genetically engineered mice harboring thyroid-specific expression of oncogenic Braf V600E with and without Pten insufficiency. After intratumoral injection of methylene blue, the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland was visualized in real time. The thyroid gland/tumor was resected en bloc with the respiratory system for histological analysis. Although mice harboring Braf V600E mutations were smaller in body size compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates, the size of their thyroid glands and deep cervical lymph nodes were significantly larger. Additionally, the tumor-draining lymph nodes showed increased and enlarged lymphatic sinuses that were distributed throughout the cortex and medulla. Tumor-reactive lymphadenopathy and histiocytosis, but no frank metastases, were observed in all mice harboring Braf V600E mutations. The tumor-draining lymph nodes undergo significant structural alterations in immunocompetent mice, and this may represent a primer for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) metastasis.

However, the best surgical option, i.e. repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection, is still debated. Purpose of the study is to assess the performance of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy. In a multicenter study, lymph node biopsy completed by back-up axillary lymph node dissection was undertaken for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or new ipsilateral primary tumor. Tracer uptake was used to identify and isolate the sentinel lymph node during surgery, and it was classified after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies. Aside from negative predictive value, overall accuracy and false-negative rate of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy were assessed. A multicenter, prospective study was conducted performing 30 repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy completed by back-up axillary lymph node dissection for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or new ipsilateral primary tumor in patients formerly treated with previous breast conservative surgery and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. Negative predictive value, overall accuracy and false-negative rate of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy were assessed. Sentinel lymph nodes were mapped in 27 patients out of 30 (90%). Aberrant drainage pathways were observed in one patient (3.7%). Tracer uptake was sufficient to identify and isolate the sentinel lymph node during surgery in 23 cases (76.6%); the patients in whom lymphoscintigraphy failed or no sentinel lymph nodes could be isolated underwent axillary lymph node dissection. The negative predictive value was 95.2%, the accuracy was 95.6% and the false-negative rate was 33%. Repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy is feasible and accurate, with a high negative predictive value.

From January 2014 to January 2016, 40 patients with cervical cancer stage IA2-IIA, based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 criteria, were included in this study. The normal cervix around the tumor was injected with a total of 1 mL of carbon nanoparticles (CNP)at 3 and 9 o'clock. All patients then underwent laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection and radical hysterectomy. The black-dyed sentinel lymph nodes were removed for routine pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining. Among the 40 patients, 38 patients had at least one sentinel lymph node (SLN). The detection rate was 95% (38/40). One hundred seventy-three SLNs were detected with an average of 3.9 SLNs per side. 25 positive lymph nodes, which included 21 positive SLNs, were detected in 8 (20%) patients. Sentinel lymph nodes were localized in the obturator (47.97%), internal lilac (13.87%), external lilac (26.59%), parametrial (1.16%), and common iliac (8.67%) regions. The sensitivity of the SLN detection was 100% (5/5), the accuracy was 97.37% (37/38), and the negative predictive value was 100. 0% and the false negative rate was 0%. Sentinel lymph nodes can be used to accurately predict the pathological state of pelvic lymph nodes in early cervical cancer. The detection rates and accuracy of sentinel lymph node were high. Carbon nanoparticles can be used to trace the sentinel lymph node in early cervical cancer.\n\nPrognostic significance of pathological response of primary tumor and metastatic axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachiavelli, M R; Romero, A O; PÃ©rez, J E; Lacava, J A; DomÃ­nguez, M E; RodrÃ­guez, R; Barbieri, M R; Romero AcuÃ±a, L A; Romero AcuÃ±a, J M; Langhi, M J; Amato, S; Ortiz, E H; Vallejo, C T; Leone, B A\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe prognostic significance of pathological response of primary tumor and metastatic axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed in patients with noninflammatory locally advanced breast carcinoma. Between January 1989 and April 1995, 148 consecutive patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma participated in the study. Of these, 140 fully evaluable patients (67, stage IIIA; 73, stage IIIB) were treated with three courses of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC), followed by modified radical mastectomy when technically feasible or definitive radiation therapy. The median age was 53 years (range, 26 to 75 years); 55% of patients were postmenopausal. Objective response was recorded in 99 of 140 patients (71%; 95% confidence interval, 63% to 79%). Complete response occurred in 11 patients (8%), and partial response occurred in 88 patients (63%). No change was recorded in 37 patients (26%), and progressive disease occurred in 4 patients (3%). One hundred and thirty-six patients underwent the planned surgery. Maximal pathological response of the primary tumor (in situ carcinoma or minimal microscopic residual tumor) was observed in 24 (18%); 112 patients (82%) presented minimal pathological response of the primary tumor (gross residual tumor). The number of metastatic axillary nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was as follows: N0, 39 patients (29%); N1-N3, 35 patients (26%); > N3, 62 patients (45%). Considering the initial TNM status, 75% of the patients had decreases in tumor compartment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Also, 31% and 23% of patients with clinical N1 and N2, respectively, showed uninvolved axillary lymph nodes. A significant correlation was noted between pathological response of primary tumor and the number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Median disease-free survival was 34 months, whereas median overall survival was 66 months.

However, its clinical impact on stage IV colorectal cancer remains unclear. The study aimed to explore the prognostic value of LN status after palliative resection of primary tumor for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We combined analyses of mCRC patients in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC).A total of 17,553 patients with mCRC were identified in SEER database. X-tile program was adopted to identify 2 and 10 as optimal cutoff values for negative lymph node (NLN) count to divide patients into 3 subgroups of high, middle and low risk of cancer related death. N stage and NLN count were verified as independent prognostic factors in multivariate analyses of patients in whole cohort and in subgroup analyses of each N stage (P<0.05). Validation of FUSCC cohort of patients demonstrated that metastatic tumor burden (P = 0.042), NLN count (P = 0.039) and sequential chemotherapy (P = 0.040) were significant predictors of poorer CSS. Specifically, the prognosis of patients at stage N0 was significantly more favorable than that of patients at stage N2 (P = 0.038). In conclusion, primary tumor LN status was a strong predictor of CSS after palliative resection of metastatic colorectal cancer. Advanced N stage and small number of NLN were correlated with high risk of cancer related death after palliative resection of primary tumor.\n\nLocoregional treatment of early breast cancer with isolated tumor cells or micrometastases on sentinel lymph node biopsy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTallet, AgnÃ¨s; Lambaudie, Eric; Cohen, Monique; Minsat, Mathieu; Bannier, Marie; Resbeut, Michel; Houvenaeghel, Gilles\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe advent of sentinel lymph-node technique has led to a shift in lymph-node staging, due to the emergence of new entities namely micrometastases (pN1mi) and isolated tumor cells [pN0(i+)].

To correlate tumor blood flow (TBF) acquired from arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion-weighted MR imaging with pathological degree of tumor differentiation, clinical stage, and nodal metastasis of HNSCC. Retrospective analysis of 43 patients (31 male, 12 female with a mean age of 65Â years) with HNSCC that underwent ASL of head and neck and TBF of HNSCC was calculated. Tumor staging and metastatic lymph nodes were determined. The stages of HNSCC were stage 1 (nâ=â7), stage II (nâ=â12), stage III (nâ=â11) and stage IV (nâ=â13). Metastatic cervical lymph nodes were seen in 24 patients. The degree of tumor differentiation was determined through pathological examination. The mean TBF of poorly and undifferentiated HNSCC (157.4âÂ±â6.7Â mL/100Â g/min) was significantly different (Pâ=â0.001) than that of well-to-moderately differentiated (142.5âÂ±â5.7Â mL/100Â g/min) HNSCC. The cut-off TBF used to differentiate well-moderately differentiated from poorly and undifferentiated HNSCC was 152Â mL/100Â g/min with an area under the curve of 0.658 and accuracy of 88.4%. The mean TBF of stages I, II (146.10âÂ±â9.1Â mL/100Â g/min) was significantly different (Pâ=â0.014) than that of stages III, IV (153.33âÂ±â9.3Â mL/100Â g/min) HNSCC. The cut-off TBF used to differentiate stages I, II from stages III and IV was 148Â mL/100Â g/min with an area under the curve of 0.701 and accuracy of 69.8%. The TBF was higher in patients with metastatic cervical lymph nodes. The cut-off TBF suspect metastatic node was 147Â mL/100Â g/min with an area under the curve of 0.671 and accuracy of 67.4%. TBF is a non-invasive imaging parameter that well correlated with pathological degree of tumor differentiation, clinical stage of tumor and nodal metastasis of HNSCC.\n\nTumor deposits counted as positive lymph nodes in TNM staging for advanced colorectal cancer: a retrospective multicenter study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jun; Yang, Shengke; Hu, Junjie; Liu, Hao; Du, Feng; Yin, Jie; Liu, Sai; Li, Ci; Xing, Shasha; Yuan, Jiatian; Lv, Bo; Fan, Jun; Leng, Shusheng; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Bing\n\n2016-04-05\n\nWe investigated the possibility of counting tumor deposits (TDs) as positive lymph nodes (pLNs) in the pN category and evaluated its prognostic value for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A new pN category (npN category) was calculated using the numbers of pLNs plus TDs. The npN category included 4 tiers: npN1a (1 tumor node), npN1b (2-3 tumor nodes), npN2a (4-6 tumor nodes), and npN2b (â¥7 tumor nodes). We identified 4,121 locally advanced CRC patients, including 717 (11.02%) cases with TDs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the disease-free and overall survival (DFS and OS) for npN and pN categories. Multivariate analysis showed that the npN and pN categories were both independent prognostic factors for DFS (HR 1.614, 95% CI 1.541 to 1.673; HR 1.604, 95% CI 1.533 to 1.679) and OS (HR 1.633, 95% CI 1.550 to 1.720; HR 1.470, 95% CI 1.410 to 1.532). However, the npN category was superior to the pN category by Harrell's C statistic. We conclude that it is thus feasible to consider TDs as positive lymph nodes in the pN category when evaluating the prognoses of CRC patients, and the npN category is potentially superior to the TNM (7th edition) pN category for predicting DFS and OS among advanced CRC patients.\n\nComparison of the current AJCC-TNM numeric-based with a new anatomical location-based lymph node staging system for gastric cancer: A western experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAuricchio, Annamaria; Cardella, Francesca; Mabilia, Andrea; Diana, Anna; Castellano, Paolo; De Vita, Ferdinando; Orditura, Michele\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground In gastric cancer, the current AJCC numeric-based lymph node staging does not provide information on the anatomical extent of the disease and lymphadenectomy. A new anatomical location-based node staging, proposed by Choi, has shown better prognostic performance, thus soliciting Western world validation. Study design Data from 284 gastric cancers undergoing radical surgery at the Second University of Naples from 2000 to 2014 were reviewed. The lymph nodes were reclassified into three groups (lesser and greater curvature, and extraperigastric nodes); presence of any metastatic lymph node in a given group was considered positive, prompting a new N and TNM stage classification. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves for censored survival data and bootstrap methods were used to compare the capability of the two models to predict tumor recurrence. Results More than one third of node positive patients were reclassified into different N and TNM stages by the new system. Compared to the current staging system, the new classification significantly correlated with tumor recurrence rates and displayed improved indices of prognostic performance, such as the Bayesian information criterion and the Harrell C-index. Higher values at survival ROC analysis demonstrated a significantly better stratification of patients by the new system, mostly in the early phase of the follow-up, with a worse prognosis in more advanced new N stages, despite the same current N stage. Conclusions This study suggests that the anatomical location-based classification of lymph node metastasis may be an important tool for gastric cancer prognosis and should be considered for future revision of the TNM staging system.

This study suggests that the anatomical location-based classification of lymph node metastasis may be an important tool for gastric cancer prognosis and should be considered for future revision of the TNM staging system.\n\nPRC2/EED-EZH2 Complex Is Up-Regulated in Breast Cancer Lymph Node Metastasis Compared to Primary Tumor and Correlates with Tumor Proliferation In Situ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYu, Hongxiang; Simons, Diana L.; Segall, Ilana; Carcamo-Cavazos, Valeria; Schwartz, Erich J.; Yan, Ning; Zuckerman, Neta S.; Dirbas, Frederick M.; Johnson, Denise L.; Holmes, Susan P.; Lee, Peter P.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Lymph node metastasis is a key event in the progression of breast cancer. Therefore it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms which facilitate regional lymph node metastatic progression. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed gene expression profiling of purified tumor cells from human breast tumor and lymph node metastasis. By microarray network analysis, we found an increased expression of polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) core subunits EED and EZH2 in lymph node metastatic tumor cells over primary tumor cells which were validated through real-time PCR. Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and quantitative image analysis of whole tissue sections showed a significant increase of EZH2 expressing tumor cells in lymph nodes over paired primary breast tumors, which strongly correlated with tumor cell proliferation in situ. We further explored the mechanisms of PRC2 gene up-regulation in metastatic tumor cells and found up-regulation of E2F genes, MYC targets and down-regulation of tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin targets in lymph node metastasis through GSEA analyses. Using IHC, the expression of potential EZH2 target, E-cadherin was examined in paired primary/lymph node samples and was found to be significantly decreased in lymph node metastases over paired primary tumors. Conclusions/Significance This study identified an over expression of the epigenetic silencing complex PRC2/EED-EZH2 in breast cancer lymph node metastasis as compared to primary tumor and its positive association with tumor cell proliferation in situ. Concurrently, PRC2 target protein E-cadherin was significant decreased in lymph node metastases, suggesting PRC2 promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lymph node metastatic process through repression of E-cadherin. These results indicate that epigenetic regulation mediated by PRC2 proteins may provide additional advantage for the outgrowth of metastatic tumor cells in lymph nodes.

We extracted from the medical data base cases of early ovarian cancer with lymphadenectomy who had been treated between 1994 and 2008. The sample was divided in three groups according to the left-right laterality of the tumor in the pelvis (bilateral, left sided, right sided). For each case, we subtracted the number of dissected lymph nodes on the left side from the number of dissected lymph nodes on the right side of the pelvis (N(Right side) - N(Left side)). We used one sample t test to determine whether the mean of differences for each group was different from zero. Results. We extracted 48 cases with early ovarian cancer who had undergone lymphadenectomy. The average number of dissected lymph nodes was 24 (SD, 12). In 3 cases, we confirmed the presence of lymph node metastasis (6.3%). In 2 of the upstaged cases, tumor and involved lymph nodes were on the right side of the pelvis. In the third case, the tumor was on the left side, whereas involved lymph nodes were on both sides of the pelvis. For bilateral tumors, tumors on the left, and those on the right side of the pelvis, the mean difference was -0.5 (95% CI, -9.9 to 8.9; t, -0.137; P = 0.90), 0.32 (95% CI, -3.8 to 4.5; t, 0.16; P = 0.87) and 3.5 (95% CI, 0.03 to 7.01; t, 2.09; P = 0.048), respectively. When the tumor was on the left or on both sides of the pelvis, there was no significant difference in the number of removed lymph nodes. In contrast, when the tumor was on the right side, the number of removed lymph nodes was significantly higher on the right hemipelvis than on the left hemipelvis.\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of early-stage cervical carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiaz, John P; Gemignani, Mary L; Pandit-Taskar, Neeta; Park, Kay J; Murray, Melissa P; Chi, Dennis S; Sonoda, Yukio; Barakat, Richard R; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWe aimed to determine the sentinel lymph node detection rates, accuracy in predicting the status of lymph node metastasis, and if pathologic ultrastaging improves the detection of micrometastases and isolated tumor cells at the time of primary surgery for cervical cancer. A prospective, non-randomized study of women with early-stage (FIGO stage IA1 with lymphovascular space involvement--IIA) cervical carcinoma was conducted from June 2003 to August 2009. All patients underwent an intraoperative intracervical blue dye injection. Patients who underwent a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy received a 99m Tc sulfur colloid injection in addition. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification followed by a complete pelvic node and parametrial dissection. SLN were evaluated using our institutional protocol that included pathologic ultrastaging. SLN mapping was successful in 77 (95%) of 81 patients. A total of 316 SLN were identified, with a median of 3 SLN per patient (range, 0-10 SLN). The majority (85%) of SLN were located at three main sites: the external iliac (35%); internal iliac (30%); and obturator (20%). Positive lymph nodes (LN) were identified in 26 (32%) patients, including 21 patients with positive SLN. Fifteen of 21 patients (71%) had SLN metastasis detected on routine processing. SLN ultrastaging detected metastasis in an additional 6/21 patients (29%). Two patients had grossly positive LN at exploration, and mapping was abandoned. Three of 26 (12%) patients had successful SLN mapping; however, the SLN failed to identify the metastatic LN. Of these 3 false negative cases, 2 patients had a metastatic parametrial node as the only positive LN with multiple negative pelvic nodes including negative SLN. One patient with stage IA1 disease and lymphovascular invasion had unilateral SLN mapping and a metastatic common iliac LN identified on completion lymphadenectomy of the contralateral side that did not map.

The diagnostic and prognostic significance of increased CTSB in the serum of cancer patients have been evaluated for some tumor types. CTSB serum and protein levels have also been reported previously in colorectal cancer (CRC) with contradictory results. The aim of the present study was to investigate CTSB expression in CRC patients and the association of CTSB expression with various tumor stages in a Middle East population. Serum CTSB levels were evaluated in 70 patients and 20 healthy control subjects using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) technique. CTSB expression was determined in 100 pairs of CRC tumor and adjacent normal colonic tissue using quantitative PCR for mRNA levels. Detection of CTSB protein expression in tissues was carried out using both immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. ELISA analysis showed that in sera obtained from CRC patients, the CTSB concentration was significantly higher in late stage patients with lymph node metastases when compared to early stage patients with values of 2.9 and 0.33 ng/ml, respectively (P=0.001). The majority of tumors studied had detectable CTSB protein expression with significant increased positive staining in tumors cells when compared with matched normal colon subjects (P=0.006). The mRNA expression in early stage CRC compared to late stage CRC was 0.04Â±0.01 and 0.07Â±0.02, respectively. Increased mRNA expression was more frequently observed in the advanced cancer stages with lymph node metastases when compared with the control (P=0.002). Mann-Whitney test and paired t-test were used to compare serum CTSB and mRNA levels in early and late tumor stage. A subset of four paired tissue extracts were analyzed by western blotting. The result confirmed a consistent increase in the CTSB protein expression level in tumor tissues compared with that noted in the adjacent normal mucosal cells. These findings\n\nRelative value of physical examination, mammography, and breast sonography in evaluating the size of the primary tumor and regional lymph node metastases in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerrada, J; Iyer, R B; Atkinson, E N; Sneige, N; Buzdar, A U; Hortobagyi, G N\n\n1997-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to correlate physical examination and sonographic and mammographic measurements of breast tumors and regional lymph nodes with pathological findings and to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on clinical Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage by noninvasive methods. This was a retrospective analysis of 100 patients with locally advanced breast cancer registered and treated in prospective trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients received four cycles of a doxorubicin-containing regimen and had noninvasive evaluation of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by physical examination, sonography, and mammography and underwent breast surgery and axillary dissection within 5 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The correlations between clinical and pathological measurements were determined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. A proportional odds model was used to examine predictive values. Eighty-three patients had both a clinically detectable primary tumor and lymph node metastases. Sixty-four patients had a decrease in Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage after chemotherapy. For 54% of patients, there was concordance in clinical response between the primary tumor and lymph node compartment; for the rest, results were discordant. Physical examination correlated best with pathological findings in the measurement of the primary tumor (P = 0.0003), whereas sonography was the most accurate predictor of size for axillary lymph nodes (P = 0.0005). The combination of physical examination and mammography worked best for assessment of the primary tumor (P = 0.003), whereas combining physical examination with sonography gave optimal evaluation of regional lymph nodes (P = 0.0001). In conclusion, physical examination is the best noninvasive predictor of the real size of locally advanced primary breast cancer, whereas sonography correlates better with the real dimensions of axillary lymph\n\nSentinel lymph node navigation surgery for early stage gastric cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nMitsumori, Norio; Nimura, Hiroshi; Takahashi, Naoto; Kawamura, Masahiko; Aoki, Hiroaki; Shida, Atsuo; Omura, Nobuo; Yanaga, Katsuhiko\n\n2014-05-21\n\nWe attempted to evaluate the history of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS), technical aspects, tracers, and clinical applications of SNNS using Infrared Ray Electronic Endoscopes (IREE) combined with Indocyanine Green (ICG).

The tumor has heterogeneous histopathologic features and a poor prognosis (median survival of 15% in five years). Aim To estimate the relationship between the presence of nodal metastasis and other prognostic factors in sporadic gastric adenocarcinoma. Method Were evaluated 164 consecutive cases of gastric adenocarcinoma previously undergone gastrectomy (partial or total), without clinical evidence of distant metastasis, and determined the following variables: topography of the lesion, tumor size, Borrmann macroscopic configuration, histological grade, early or advanced lesions, Lauren histological subtype, presence of signet ring cell, degree of invasion, perigastric lymph node status, angiolymphatic/perineural invasion, and staging. Results Were found 21 early lesions (12.8%) and 143 advanced lesions (87.2%), with a predominance of lesions classified as T3 (n=99/60, 4%) and N1 (n=62/37, 8%). The nodal status was associated with depth of invasion (p<0.001) and tumor size (p<0.001). The staging was related to age (p=0.048), histological grade (p=0.003), and presence of signet ring cells (p = 0.007), angiolymphatic invasion (p = 0.001), and perineural invasion (p=0.003). Conclusion In gastric cancer, lymph node involvement, tumor size and depth of invasion are histopathological data associated with the pattern of growth/tumor spread, suggesting that a wide dissection of perigastric lymph nodes is a fundamental step in the surgical treatment of these patients. PMID:24676292\n\nComparison of five systems for staging lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, W; Choi, G S; Whang, I; Suh, I S\n\n1997-09-01\n\nThere are several systems for staging lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer. Their relative merits are not clear. In this retrospective analysis, the nodal status was classified according to the Union Internacional Contra la Cancrum (UICC) and Japanese staging systems, the number and frequency of lymph node metastasis, and the level of involved nodes. Each staging system was scored as good (+1), fair (0) or poor (-1) with respect to prognostic value, theoretical value, convenience, reproducibility and surgical applicability. There were no differences between the five staging systems in predicting survival. The Japanese staging system was most arbitrary owing to the complexity of the system, although it had an advantage in surgical application. The same disadvantage was found in the UICC system and the level system. Determination of the number and frequency of involved nodes was convenient and reproducible, but the number of lymph nodes dissected must be considered when the number of positive nodes is used for staging. The classification of metastasis to the regional lymph nodes as N0 (no nodal metastasis), N1 (metastasis in 1-25 per cent of dissected nodes) and N2 (metastasis in more than 25 per cent of dissected nodes) would be a simple, convenient, reproducible staging system with an ability to predict surgical results.\n\nEvaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to axillary lymph node dissection: the role of isolated tumor cells/micrometastases and multifocality/multicentricity-a retrospective study of 1214 breast cancer patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchrÃ¶der, Lars; Fricker, Roland; Stein, Roland Gregor; Rink, Thomas; Fitz, Hartmut; Blasius, Sebastian; WÃ¶ckel, Achim; MÃ¼ller, Thomas\n\n2018-06-01\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone has thus become an accepted surgical approach for patients with limited axillary metastatic disease. We investigated to what extent isolated tumor cells (ITC) or micrometastasis in SLNBs is associated with proven tumor cells or metastasis in non-sentinel lymph nodes. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of SLNB in multifocal and multicentric tumors as both entities have been considered a contraindication for this technique. 1214 women suffering from T1 and T2 invasive breast cancer, with clinically and sonographically insuspect axillary status and undergoing primary breast cancer surgery including SLNB and axillary staging in case of SLN (sentinel lymph node) metastases, were recruited into this multicentered study. ITC and micrometastases were found in 2.01 and 21.4% of patients with SLN metastases (nâ=â299). Among patients with sentinel micrometastases, 4.7% showed further axillary micrometastases, while only two patients (3.1%) had two axillary macrometastases. Multifocal and multicentric tumors were diagnosed in 9.3 and 2.6% of our patients who at least had one SLN resected, respectively. Detection rates of SLNs did not differ between the cohorts suffering from unicentric and multifocal or multicentric disease. Moreover, the portion of tumor-free SLNs, the number of SLNs with metastasis as well as the mean number of resected SLNs did not differ. No patient with sentinel node micrometastases showed more than two axillary macrometastases. Multifocal and multicentric disease is no contraindication for SLNB.\n\nSentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer: utility of intraoperative versus postoperative assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nFader, A Nickles; Edwards, R P; Cost, M; Kanbour-Shakir, A; Kelley, J L; Schwartz, B; Sukumvanich, P; Comerci, J; Sumkin, J; Elishaev, E; Rohan, L Cencia\n\n2008-10-01\n\nTo determine the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative blue dye, and radiocolloid in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Intra-cervical injection of technetium-99 sulfur colloid and lymphoscintigraphy were performed preoperatively. Isosulfan blue was injected intra-cervically immediately prior to surgery. SLNs were excised and examined intraoperatively (imprint cytology and frozen section) and postoperatively (H and E histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cytokeratin). Thirty eight patients were evaluable. Laparoscopy and laparotomy were performed in 28.9% and 71.1%, respectively. Subjects had squamous cell carcinoma (n=26), adenocarcinoma (n=10) or adenosquamous (n=2) histologies. 55.3% had cervical tumors <2 cm. The overall SLN detection rate was 92.1%. The external iliac region just distal to the common iliac bifurcation was the most common SLN location. A mean of 2.1 SLNs were detected per patient with bilateral SLNs observed in 47.4%. On final pathology, metastatic nodal disease was identified in 15.7% of patients. Of these, 83.3% were detected in the SLNs. Sensitivity of SLN detection of metastasis was 100% for patients with cervical tumors <2 cm. However intraoperative evaluation by imprint cytology and frozen section correctly identified lymph node metastasis in only 33.3%. SLN detection is feasible and accurately reflects pelvic nodal basin status when performed in early-stage cervical cancer patients. However, while current intraoperative pathology techniques for assessing nodal metastases reliably detect metastases larger than 2 mm, they lack sufficient sensitivity to detect micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells.\n\nDifferential Motion Between Mediastinal Lymph Nodes and Primary Tumor in Radically Irradiated Lung Cancer Patients\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchaake, Eva E.; Department of Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam; Rossi, Maddalena M.G.\n\n2014-11-15\n\nPurpose/Objective: In patients with locally advanced lung cancer, planning target volume margins for mediastinal lymph nodes and tumor after a correction protocol based on bony anatomy registration typically range from 1 to 1.5Â cm. Detailed information about lymph node motion variability and differential motion with the primary tumor, however, is lacking from large series. In this study, lymph node and tumor position variability were analyzed in detail and correlated to the main carina to evaluate possible margin reduction. Methods and Materials: Small gold fiducial markers (0.35Â ÃÂ 5Â mm) were placed in the mediastinal lymph nodes of 51 patients with non-small cell lung cancermoreÂ Â» during routine diagnostic esophageal or bronchial endoscopic ultrasonography. Four-dimensional (4D) planning computed tomographic (CT) and daily 4D cone beam (CB) CT scans were acquired before and during radical radiation therapy (66Â Gy in 24 fractions). Each CBCT was registered in 3-dimensions (bony anatomy) and 4D (tumor, marker, and carina) to the planning CT scan. Subsequently, systematic and random residual misalignments of the time-averaged lymph node and tumor position relative to the bony anatomy and carina were determined. Additionally, tumor and lymph node respiratory amplitude variability was quantified. Finally, required margins were quantified by use of a recipe for dual targets. Results: Relative to the bony anatomy, systematic and random errors ranged from 0.16 to 0.32Â cm for the markers and from 0.15 to 0.33Â cm for the tumor, but despite similar ranges there was limited correlation (0.17-0.71) owing to differential motion. A large variability in lymph node amplitude between patients was observed, with an average motion of 0.56Â cm in the cranial-caudal direction. Margins could be reduced by 10% (left-right), 27% (cranial-caudal), and 10% (anteroposterior) for the lymph nodes and â2%, 15%, and 7% for the tumor if an online carina registration protocol replaced\n\nConstruction of a pathological risk model of occult lymph node metastases for prognostication by semi-automated image analysis of tumor budding in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPedersen, Nicklas Juel; Jensen, David Hebbelstrup; Lelkaitis, Giedrius; Kiss, Katalin; Charabi, Birgitte; Specht, Lena; von Buchwald, Christian\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIt is challenging to identify at diagnosis those patients with early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), who have a poor prognosis and those that have a high risk of harboring occult lymph node metastases. The aim of this study was to develop a standardized and objective digital scoring method to evaluate the predictive value of tumor budding. We developed a semi-automated image-analysis algorithm, Digital Tumor Bud Count (DTBC), to evaluate tumor budding. The algorithm was tested in 222 consecutive patients with early-stage OSCC and major endpoints were overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). We subsequently constructed and cross-validated a binary logistic regression model and evaluated its clinical utility by decision curve analysis. A high DTBC was an independent predictor of both poor OS and PFS in a multivariate Cox regression model. The logistic regression model was able to identify patients with occult lymph node metastases with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78â0.89, P <0.001) and a 10-fold cross-validated AUC of 0.79. Compared to other known histopathological risk factors, the DTBC had a higher diagnostic accuracy. The proposed, novel risk model could be used as a guide to identify patients who would benefit from an up-front neck dissection.

The operation was done unilaterally (95 patients) in peroperatively tumor-free patients or in those with limited metastatic growth. In 23 patients with more extensive metastases, bilateral RLND was performed. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 36 patients, and these patients received 3-4 cycles of a cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. If no metastases were detected the patients had no further treatment. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 100%. 8 of 82 patients without detected metastases in the operation specimen relapsed (all outside the retroperitoneal space), but were cured by salvage chemotherapy. Solitary metastases were found in 11 patients, whereas 25 patients had more than 1 metastatic lymph node. The size of the largest metastasis ranged from 0.3 to 40 mm. Metastases from right-sided tumors were detected at all levels of the lumbar region, predominantly to the right of the inferior vena cava and/or within the interaortocaval space. Left-sided tumors metastasized to the upper two thirds of the lumbar space, only rarely crossing the midline. This anatomical distribution of metastatic lymph nodes indicates that the presacral sympathetic nerve plexus and the sympathetic nerve fibers around the aortic bifurcation can be spared from extensive resection in the majority of patients with NSTC in CSI. Unilateral RLND or other nerve-sparing techniques are thus possible, preserving antegrade ejaculation in greater than 80% of the patients. This RLND represents a reasonable alternative to the 'surveillance' policy in NSTC.\n\nAggressive rat prostate tumors reprogram the benign parts of the prostate and regional lymph nodes prior to metastasis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nThysell, Elin; Halin BergstrÃ¶m, Sofia; Bergh, Anders\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn order to grow and spread tumors need to interact with adjacent tissues. We therefore hypothesized that small but aggressive prostate cancers influence the rest of the prostate and regional lymph nodes differently than tumors that are more indolent. Poorly metastatic (Dunning AT1) or highly metastatic (Dunning MLL) rat prostate tumor cells were injected into the ventral prostate lobe of immunocompetent rats. After 10 daysâwhen the tumors occupied about 30% of the prostate lobe and lymph node metastases were undetectableâthe global gene expression in tumors, benign parts of the prostate, and regional iliac lymph nodes were examined to define tumor-induced changes related to preparation for future metastasis. The tumors induced profound effects on the gene expression profiles in the benign parts of the prostate and these were strikingly different in the two tumor models. Gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that tumors with high metastatic capacity were more successful than less metastatic tumors in inducing tumor-promoting changes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses in the entire prostate. Some of these differences such as altered angiogenesis, nerve density, accumulation of T-cells and macrophages were verified by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression alterations in the regional lymph nodes suggested decreased quantity and activation of immune cells in MLL-lymph nodes that were also verified by immunostaining. In summary, even when small highly metastatic prostate tumors can affect the entire tumor-bearing organ and pre-metastatic lymph nodes differently than less metastatic tumors. When the kinetics of these extratumoral influences (by us named TINT = tumor instructed normal tissue) are more precisely defined they could potentially be used as markers of disease aggressiveness and become therapeutic targets.

We aimed to assess the prognostic capability of the eighth tumor node metastasis pathologic lymph node staging system (numeric-based) compared with the 11th Japan Esophageal Society (topography-based) pathologic lymph node staging system in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 289 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection during the period from January 2006 through June 2016. We compared discrimination abilities for overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cancer-specific survival between these 2 staging systems using C-statistics. The median number of dissected and metastatic nodes was 61 (25% to 75% quartile range, 45Â to 79) and 1 (25% to 75% quartile range, 0 to 3), respectively. The eighth tumor node metastasis pathologic lymph node staging system had a greater ability to accurately determine overall survival (C-statistics: tumor node metastasis classification, 0.69, 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.76; Japan Esophageal Society classification; 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.71; PÂ =Â .014) and cancer-specific survival (C-statistics: tumor node metastasis classification, 0.78, 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.87; Japan Esophageal Society classification; 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.80; PÂ =Â .018). Rates of total recurrence rose as the eighth tumor node metastasis pathologic lymph node stage increased, while stratification of patients according to the topography-based node classification system was not feasible. Numeric nodal staging is an essential tool for stratifying the oncologic outcomes of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma even in the cohort in which adequate\n\nLymphatic vessel invasion and lymph node metastasis in patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Du-Young; Lee, Sungsoo\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the association between the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) in primary tumors and lymph node (LN) metastasis in clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. A total of 76 patients who underwent complete resection for clinical stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were retrospectively examined. Tumors consisted of 51 cases of adenocarcinoma and 25 cases of squamous cell carcinoma as determined by histology. LN metastasis was detected in 24.4% (19/76) of patients. Factors associated with LN metastasis on univariate analysis included LVI (pâ<â0.001) and increased tumor dimensions (pâ<â0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of LVI (pâ<â0.001) was the only predictor of LN metastasis. LVI is significantly associated with LN metastasis in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC. These findings may be helpful in determining the most appropriate operative strategy for patients if preoperative detection of LVI becomes feasible.

Its role in multifocal or multicentric tumors is still evolving. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and pertinence of sentinel lymph node biopsy in multifocal and multicentric tumors based on a systematic review of literature. A systematic review was conducted searching in the following electronic databases PubMed using \"sentinel lymph node biopsy\", \"breast cancer\", \"multifocal tumor\", \"multicentric tumor\" and \"multiple tumor\" as keywords. We included original articles published between 2000 and 2014, both French and English, studying feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in invasive breast cancer, multicentric and/or multifocal tumors. The first end point was success rate and false negative rate. Twenty-six articles were included in this literature review, with 2212 cases (782 multifocal, 737 multicentric and 693 multiple tumors). Percentage of tumors whose stage was higher than stage T2 ranged from 0 to 86.3%. Success rate average was 83.1%. False negative average was 8.2%. False negative rate was less than 10% in 15 articles. Mean of sentinel lymph node biopsy was 2 (1-9). The average rate of sentinel lymph node positive was 50.6%. Axillary recurrence rate was 0.5%. Despite the methodological biases of the studies included in this review of literature, the false negative rate of sentinel node biopsy in multifocal and multicentric breast cancers are less than 10% with a low rate of axillary recurrence. Despite the lack of randomized study, this procedure can be routinely performed in accordance with rigorous technical process. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We aimed to investigate clinical outcomes as well as factors associated with overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who had undergone extraperitoneal lymph node dissection and were managed according to their lymph node status. Material and Methods: The medical records of 233 women with stage IIb-IVa cervical cancer who were clinically staged and underwent extraperitoneal lymph node dissection were retrospectively reviewed. Paraaortic lymph node status determined the appropriate radiotherapeutic treatment field. Surgery-related complications and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results: The median age of the patients was 52 years (range, 26-88 years) and the median follow-up time was 28.4 months (range, 3-141 months). Thirty-one patients had laparoscopic extraperitoneal lymph node dissection and 202 patients underwent laparotomy. The number of paraaortic lymph nodes extracted was similar for both techniques. Sixty-two (27%) of the 233 patients had paraaortic lymph node m"
