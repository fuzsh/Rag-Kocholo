        "text": "Since my last post here, I have spent some time back home in Portugal reconnecting with family, friends, the sea and the warm weather (hence the photo)! However, I have now been happily back in Glasgow and although the weather isn‚Äôt even close to what I would wish it was, I am happy to say that I have officially become a #UX Professional! Although my interest in #Design and Humans goes way back, I started studying UX back in January 2022, on my evenings and weekends, by January this year I finished my course from UX Design Institute, but continued learning on Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF), Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare, you name it‚Ä¶ Finally, for the last few months, I have been working with Small99 on several of their products, and it‚Äôs been amazing. While my focus here has been #UX, I am having the opportunity to dabble in all things #Design. Couldn‚Äôt have wished for things to turn out any better. I‚Äôve had some amazing help from my career transition coach Ricardo Brito, who I so much recommend!!! But also the wider #UXCommunity, special props to Michael Haigney. I am looking forward to seeing some of my work in the wild soon. Keep going y‚Äôall out there who are transitioning to a new career, keep putting yourself out there and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help. I am rooting for you. üíì P.S. You won't be seeing any more SFCC recruitment stuff from me but we can still be friends if you're into UX. üòâ\n\nGoodbye SFCC üëã These past couple of years I have been so lucky to be part of this large SFCC network and to work with amazing people all across the ecosystem. I will forever cherish the connections I have built and all of you folks who made this such a fun journey! Right now, I say farewell to Recruitment, SFCC, and Empiric. Thank you for my great team here that made this ride a bit smoother! I learned so much during my time here, from 360 Recruitment to Marketing, and also some skiing. ‚õ∑ I am so excited about what is in store for me next and I have big and ambitious plans that will come to light in due course. But for now, I will be taking a break to reconnect with family and friends. I hope we can still stay in touch and that our paths will cross in the future. I couldn't find any LinkedIn friendly pictures of me and the team, as in most of the photos we are having TOO much fun, so I will leave you with a \"the world is my oyster\" sort of photo of me. üåç Thank you all and see you around! P.S. For all things SFCC please connect with David Morrow as he will be taking over my business here. I couldn't have left you in better hands. üòâ\n\nBonjour mon r√©seau #SFCC üëã Just wanted to say a massive welcome to your new member on the SFCC Team - Anais Gaschet. üôå She has joined us recently to take over and expand on the work we have been doing in the #SalesforceCommerceCloud market in #France, and she actually speaks #French which is absolutely amazing. We all very excited on the impact she is going to make in this market, so keep her name in mind! Please give her a warm welcome as she is currently working on expanding her knowledge of SFCC and connecting with all the amazing folks working with it in France. ü§ó Elise Leidland David Morrow Graham Watson Justin Reid- Head of Salesforce UK and Europe-Empiric Josh Ramsay Thomas Cowley ‚òÅLaura Webb‚òÅ Jordyn Phillips Anthony Mussell Marcus Cloutman John Clements - Senior Consultant - Salesforce, Germany"
