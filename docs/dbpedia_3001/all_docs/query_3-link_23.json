There were 76 complications of intermediate severity (7.33%): catheter or stent displacement (n = 37, 3.57%) catheter occlusion (n = 18, 1.73%), hematuria (n = 12, 1.16%), and urinary tract infection (n = 9, 0.87%). The 55 minor complications (5.3%) comprised inflammation of the skin at the site of insertion of the percutaneous catheter.Conclusion: The small number of complications observed during acts of interventional uroradiology prove transcutaneous manipulations to be safe medical procedures\n\nClinical implications of acute pelvicaliceal hematoma formation during percutaneous catheter nephrostomy insertion.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStewart, Jessica K; Smith, Tony P; Kim, Charles Y\n\nTo determine the clinical implications of acute pelvicaliceal hematoma formation during percutaneous catheter nephrostomy (PCN) insertion. Collecting system hematoma burden was retrospectively assessed for 694 PCN insertions in 502 patients. Pelvicaliceal hematoma formation occurred in 146 kidneys (21%) in 136 patients. Clinically significant blood loss occurred in 3 patients with hematomas within one week compared to 4 patients without hematomas (p=0.39). Twenty-four patients with hematomas underwent catheter exchange within one week, compared to 55 patients without hematomas (p=0.49). Pelvicaliceal hematoma formation after PCN insertion is not uncommon and is associated with very rare clinical sequelae. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: 247 hydronephrosis eases treated with percutaneous nephrostomy guided by ultrosound and fluroseopy flora Januray 2007 to April 2008 were evaluated retrospectively and the causes of complications and suitable treatments were analyzed. Results: The successful rate of percutaneous nephrostomy in 247 hydronephrotic cases reached 100%. In all cases, 4 cases occurred with severe complications (1.6%) including 3 massive hemorrhage and 1 septic shock during the operation. The minor complications (25 cases, 10% ) were hematuria, urinary tract infection, local haematoma, perirenal haematoma, detachment of drainage tube with obstruction and exodus, internal double-J catheter displacement and obstruction, etc. Conclusion: The operative safety and treatment efficacy of percutaneous nephrostomy could be achieved through skillful management and comprehensive preoperative evaluation of the risk factors for the complications.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively analysed 500 percutaneous nephrostomies in dilated an non-dilated systems in 353 patients from 2006 to 2007 (208 males (range 19-95 years), 127 females (range 27-91 years) and 21 children (range 3 months-16 years: 6 females, 15 males)). Percutaneous nephrostomy was considered successful if catheter was placed in renal pelvis and drained urine spontaneously. Successful percutaneous nephrostomies were classified as primary (renal system drained instantly) or postponed (drainage achieved within 24 h after initial failure). Number of complications was registered. Results: All of the 500 nephrostomies were successful within 24 h (96.2% primary; 3.8% postponed). The success rate of primary nephrostomy in dilated and non-dilated systems was 98.2% and 82%, respectively. Major complications occurred in 0.45% and minor complications in 14.2%. Conclusion: Percutaneous nephrostomy using the 'mixed' technique is very successful in dilated systems, is not superior to other PCN techniques in non-dilated systems and has a very low rate of major complications.\n\nPercutaneous nephrostomy - experience of 19 times in 14 patients\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYang, Seoung Oh; Park, Jae Hyung; Choi, Byung Ihn; Han, Man Chung; Kim, Chu Wan\n\n1984-01-01\n\nPercutaneous nephrostomy for relief of obstruction and functional preservation of the kidney was effectively performed 19 times in 14 patients for recent 1 year since July 1982 at Department of Radiology in Seoul National University Hospital. The etiologies of the total 14 obstructive uropathies were metastatc cervix cancer in 6-cases, metastatic rectal cancer in 2 cases, and metastatic bladder cancer, malignant mixed mesodermal tumor of perimetrium, pyonephrosis, bilateral staghorn stone, UVJ obstruction of undetermined cause, congenital UPJ obstruction in 1 case respectively. Percutaneous nephrostomy was done bilaterally in 1 case of congenital UPJ obstruction and unilaterally in 13 case. We used ultrasound as puncture guide in 13 cases and computed tomography in 1 case. Major complication was absent, but minor complications occurred in 4 patients: gross hematuria persisting 24 hours (1 case), catheter dislodgment after several weeks (2 cases) and luminal narrowing after 3 months (1 case). Satisfactory outcomes were made in 13 patients except 1 patient who succumbed one day after the procedure due to preexisting severe sepsis. The procedure proved to be safe and effective alternative to operative nephrostomy in some patients with urinary obstruction\n\nEfficacy and safety in performing of large bore percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasound guidance\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSmilov, N.; Mlachkova, D.; Rizov, A.; Lozev, I.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to compare the success rate, complications and the outcomes from large-bore percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasound guidance performed to 178 cases with another 54 when nephrostomy under x-ray control was performed. We have performed 178 large-bore percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasound guidance and another 54 percutaneous nephrostomy under x-ray guidance to patients diagnosed with obstructive uropathy resulting from benign or malignant supravesical obstruction. We have performed successful nephrostomy in 93,8% of the cases under ultrasound guidance and 100% successful nephrostomy in the cases under x-ray control. In 2,8% of patients under ultrasound guidance the nephrostomy was performed using 4 additional punctures of the pyelocaliceal system and artificially caused hydronephrosis via infiltration of normal saline; and in the remaining 1,7% it was successful at the second attempt after 24 hours. It was not necessary to perform open surgery nephrostomy in any of the cases. The performance of percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasound guidance has a success rate similar to the one done under x-ray guidance and with commensurable frequency and severity of complications, however without the patient and the operator being exposed to x-ray radiation. In general, the percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasound guidance is performed without difficulties in the cases of third or fourth degree hydronephrosis. The lateral decubital patient position, the appropriate place for the puncture, the usage of Color Doppler imaging when the puncture is performed and the continuos ultrasound guidance during dilatation and placement of the nephrostomy tube should ensure the successful performance of the procedure in the case of first or second degree hydronephrosis. When hydronephrosis is absent, the nephrostomy should be performed under x-ray guidance. In emergency cases the application of ultrasound guidance allows the nephrostomy to be performed along the\n\nUltrasound Guided Percutaneous Nephrostomy: Experience at ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nBackground: Obstructive uropathy is a common problem in urologic practice; temporary relief of obstruction in the upper tract poses a significant challenge.

We describe an effective method to achieve transient dilatation of the pelvicaliceal system via induction of diuresis using infusion of a diuretic agent in normal saline, therefore allowing easier access to the pelvicaliceal system. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, the technique had been tested in 22 nephrostomies with nondilated system (a total of 20 patients with 2 patients having bilateral nephrostomies) during a 5-year period. Patients were given 40 mg of furosemide in 250 ml of normal saline solution intravenously by rapid infusion. As soon as maximum calyceal dilatation of more than 5 mm was observed, which is usually 15 min later after the end of rapid infusion, patients were positioned obliquely, and PCN procedure under ultrasound guidance was performed. The procedure was successful in 19 of the nephrostomies in 17 patients with a success rate of 86.36 % per procedure and 85 % per patient in nondilated pelvicaliceal systems. No major nephrostomy-, drug-, or technique-related complications were encountered. The technique failed to work in three patients due to the presence of double J catheters and preexisting calyceal perforation which avoided transient dilation of the pelvicaliceal system with diuresis.

[RWTH Aachen (Germany). Klinik fuer Radiologische Diagnostik; Hunter, D.W. [Minnesota Univ. (United States). Dept. of Radiology\n\n1998-06-01\n\nPurpose: To evaluate technique and practicability of MR-guided percutaneous nephrostomy (MRPCN) in an animal model. Methods: In three domestic pigs, a unilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed into the nondilated collecting system using exclusively MR-guidance with a standard 1.5 T scanner. The urinary tract was visualized by intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA and low-dose furosemide. The entire interventional procedure was controlled using a T{sub 1}-weighted `dual stack` 2D TFE sequence in two orthogonal planes. Results: In all three animals, the puncture needle was safely directed into the nondilated target calyx. Even slight deviations of the needle from the optimal path were readily detected on both MR image planes which enabled immediate correction. This technique successfully achieved a `first attempt` puncture of the targeted calyx in each animal. Over a nitinol guidewire a 5 F catheter was placed into the renal pelvis. Its dysprosium labelled tip was acurately delineated on contrast-enhanced MR images. Conclusions: Percutaneous nephrostomy under MR guidance is a very feasible technique for puncturing the nondilated pelvicalyceal system. This procedure offers some advantages over the current standard modalities. (orig.)

[Depts. of Radiology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Urology, Cumhuriyet Univ. School of Medicine, Sivas (Turkey)\n\n2007-09-15\n\nBackground: Percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) has been established as an effective technique for urinary decompression or diversion. This procedure may be performed with the guidance of fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, a combination of fluoroscopy and ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging. Purpose: To retrospectively review experience with CT-guided PCN over a 10-year period in a single center. Material and Methods: All CT-guided PCN procedures performed in adults at our institution between 1995 and 2005 were evaluated. In 882 patients, 1113 nephrostomy catheters were inserted. Interventional radiologists or radiology residents under direct attending supervision inserted all catheters. During the PCN procedure, bleeding, sepsis, and injuries to adjacent organs were regarded as major complications. Clinical events requiring nominal therapy with no sequelae were regarded as minor complications. Results: PCN procedures were performed via 1-3 punctures in patients with grades 0-1 and 2 hydronephrosis, and via 1-2 punctures in patients with grade 3 hydronephrosis. They were carried out with a procedure time ranging from 9 to 26 min. All PCNs were considered as technically successful, and no major complications were observed. There were minor complications including transient macroscopic hematuria (28.6%, 19.9%, and 4.9% in patients with hydronephrosis grades 0-1, 2, and 3, respectively) and perirenal hematomas in a total of eight patients. No patient required additional intervention secondary to complications of the PCN procedure. Conclusion: CT-guided PCN is an efficient and safe procedure with major and minor complication rates below the accepted thresholds. It can be used for the management of patients requiring nephrostomy insertion in inpatient settings, and might be a preferable procedure in patients with minimal or no dilatation of the renal pelvis.

To evaluate the feasibility of cone-beam CT for percutaneous nephrostomy placement for subsequent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy in children and adolescents. A retrospective review of percutaneous nephrostomy revealed use of cone-beam CT and 3-D guidance in 12 percutaneous nephrostomy procedures for 9 patients between 2006 and 2015. All cone-beam CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomies were for pre-lithotripsy access and all 12 were placed in non-dilated collecting systems. Technical success was 100%. There were no complications. Cone-beam CT with 3-D guidance is a technically feasible technique for percutaneous nephrostomy in children and adolescents, specifically for nephrolithotripsy access in non-dilated collecting systems.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of these two methods by comparing complications, placement success, urinary symptoms, urine culture analyses prior to derivation placement and derivation removal and success of stone elimination after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL. This prospective study included 157 patients with supravesical obstruction caused by ureteral stones. Eighty-one patients underwent percutaneus nephrostomy, and JJ stent was inserted in seventy-six (76 patients. After resolving the obstruction, ESWL was performed in all patients. There were no statistically significant differences in success of the urinary derivation placement, the urine culture results before and after placement and success of ESWL treatment between the two studied groups (p>0.05. Urinary symptoms (dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency, frequent urination during the day were significantly more present in patients with a JJ stent and this difference was statistically significant for each symptom (p<0.001. Major complications were verified in 2 (2.46% patients with PCN catheter, and in 7 (9.2% patients in the group with the JJ stent. Minor complications were significantly more frequent in the group with the JJ stent compared to the group with PCN catheter (28.39% vs 60.52%, p<0.001. Percutaneous nephrostomy and JJ stenting are optimal methods for temporary treatment of supravesical obstruction caused by ureteral stones, with similar incidence of the following complications, except for the pain, which dominates in patients with the JJ stent. Urinary symptoms and asymptomatic bacteriuria are more common in patients with the JJ stent. If the ESWL treatment of ureteral stone is performed after urinary derivation placement, we can expect greater success in patients with the JJ stent.\n\nImproved split renal function after percutaneous nephrostomy in young adults with severe hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Shiwei; Zhang, Qing; Ji, Changwei; Zhao, Xiaozhi; Liu, Guangxiang; Zhang, Shun; Li, Xiaogong; Lian, Huibo; Zhang, Gutian; Guo, Hongqian\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe evaluated percutaneous nephrostomy for adult kidneys with severe hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction and less than 10% split renal function. In this retrospective analysis we included patients who underwent percutaneous nephrostomy for unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction of the kidneys with hydronephrosis and less than 10% split renal function at our hospital between May 2009 and January 2012. Adults (age 18 years or greater) were divided into those 35 years or younger (young adults) and older than 35 years (older adults). The percutaneous nephrostomy remained in situ a mean Â± SD of 6.62 Â± 2.55 weeks and patients underwent repeat renography before pyeloplasty. When there was no significant improvement in split renal function (10% or greater) and drainage (greater than 400 ml per day), nephrectomy was performed. Otherwise pyeloplasty was performed. Patients were followed by renography, ultrasound and contrast computerized tomography at 3 and 6 months, at 1 year and annually thereafter. Of 53 patients 30 (56.6%) showed improvement after percutaneous nephrostomy drainage and urine output greater than 400 ml per day with percutaneous nephrostomy. Pyeloplasty was then performed. Of 29 young adults 24 (82.8%) showed improved split renal function vs 6 of 24 older adults (25%). Nephrectomy of the other 23 kidneys was performed. At a mean followup of 19.27 Â± 7.82 months (range 12 to 36), no patient showed hypertension or urinary tract infection. Split renal function detected by renography may not accurately predict recovered, poorly functioning kidneys, especially in young adults. First observing the recoverability of hydronephrotic kidneys by percutaneous nephrostomy drainage and then preserving select kidneys may be an effective method to manage poorly functioning kidneys due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction.

Renal and perirenal hematomas were detected in five cases and the other five cases showed collections of contrast material in the retroperitoneum except for the anterior pararenal space. CT demonstrated clearly the anatomic distribution and extent of renal hemorrhage and extravasation of contrast material. Three cases of pleural effusion on CT were accompanied by blood or contrast material collections in the posterior pararenal space. No patients required immediate surgery and CT findings helped the choice of conservative therapies.

This study included 328 consecutive patients that underwent PCN at our institution with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) between July 2010 and April 2015. Results of urine cultures obtained from the urethral and nephrostomy catheters were compared. This study included 152 male and 176 female patients. Mean age of the patients was 46.2Â±24.3 years. The main indications were obstructive uropathy due to urolithiasis complicated with pyonephrosis 145 (44%), malignant disease (n=87; 26%), pregnancy (n=26; 8%), and anatomical abnormality (n=23; 7%). One hundred and twenty three patients had diabetes mellitus. The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Blood cultures showed the same results for the PCN and bladder urine cultures. The bladder urine culture was positive in 304 patients, while the PCN urine culture in 314 patients. PCN is an important treatment for the management of pyonephrosis. Cultures from the PCN yield valuable information that is not available from urethral urine cultures, and is a guiding tool for antibiotic therapy selection.\n\nPercutaneous intervention in obstructive\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSouftas, V.\n\n2012-01-01\n\n, performed by the urologist. Before performing a lithotripsy, percutaneous access of the renal collecting system is necessary. Percutaneous ureteral lithotripsy is indicated for management of large renal stones. The kidneys are accessed either using ultrasound, if there is a dilated collecting system, or fluoroscopy, if there is a radiopaque stone. The most ideal access is a calyx that bears the stone. Once access is obtained an angled glide wire is used to cross the obstructing stone and gain access to the ureter. Two wires can then be advanced to the bladder to provide a 'working wire' and a 'safety wire'. Success of lithotripsy is 98-99% for targeted renal stones and 88-89% for ureteral stones. If using only fluoroscopy, a sheathed needle may be used to access the bladder under fluoroscopy. Once urine is aspirated through the sheathed needle, a 3Jwire is inserted into the bladder under fluoroscopy. Using an angled guiding catheter, the 3J-wire is exchanged for an Amplatz and serial dilatation of the tract is performed over the Amplatz. Finally, an 8-F to 12-F suprapubic Foley catheter is inserted over the Amplatz wire into the bladder. Success rate for suprapubic tube insertion has been reported to approach 100% and is comparable to surgical insertion. Complications include bleeding, infection, and bladder or bowel perforation. Perinephric/retroperitoneal urinomas/abscesses drainages are usually due to ureteral obstruction/ trauma from calculi and rupture of the collecting system or to iatrogenic trauma. Most often they are performed under CT guidance, with success rates 100% and very low complication rates. Pigtail drainage catheters 8-F (up to 14-F for abscesses) are used. Sometimes these procedures have to be combined with percutaneous nephrostomy and percutaneous or antegrade ureteral stent placement.\n\nThe role of ultrasound-guided nephrostomy catheter drainage in the management of peripheral pyogenic lung abscess\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAmira A Gaballah\n\n2018-01-01\n\nConclusion US-guided PTD using nephrostomy catheter for peripheral lung abscess is safe and effective; it can improve the outcome, shorten the duration and reduce the need for surgery in lung abscess treatment with less complications.\n\nRisk Factors related to hemorrhage necessitating renal artery embolization after percutaneous nephrostomy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nByon, Jung Hee; Han, Young Min; Jin, Gong Yong; Song, Ji Soo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo investigate risk factors related to severe bleeding necessitating renal artery embolization (RAE) after percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). 36 patients who underwent RAE from January 2005 to June 2014 were retrospectively reviewed.

From 1762 patients who underwent PCN in the same period, we selected 21 patients who underwent PCN without bleeding after the procedure (non-bleeding group). We investigated possible related risk factors, such as the presence of underlying diseases, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), platelet count, puncture site, procedure time, size of the kidney, distance from skin to renal cortex, maximum caliber of the indwelling catheter, parenchymal thickness, and grade of hydronephrosis. We used Fisher's exact test and independent t test for data analyses. We classified hydronephrosis as either 'mild hydronephrosis,' or 'moderate or severe hydronephrosis.' The frequency of mild hydronephrosis was 80.0% (8/10) in the bleeding group and 33.3% (7/21) in the non-bleeding group (p = 0.023). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of underlying diseases. Similarly, other risk factors (PT, aPTT, platelet count, procedure time, distance from skin to renal cortex, maximum caliber of the indwelling catheter, kidney size, and parenhcymal thickness) also did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mild hydronephrosis is a risk factor for severe bleeding necessitating RAE after PCN.

[Klagenfurt General Hospital, Department of Radiology, Klagenfurt (Austria); Portugaller, Horst R. [University Hospital of Graz, Department of Radiology, Graz (Austria)\n\n2006-09-15\n\nIn this review the technique, indication for and complications of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and antegrade ureter stent insertion are described. In the majority of the cases PCN is performed to relieve urinary obstruction, which can be of benign or malignant nature. Another indication for PCN is for treatment of urinary fistulas. PCN can be performed under ultrasound and/or fluoroscopic guidance, with a success rate of more than 90%. The complication rate is approximately 10% for major and minor complications together and 4-5% for major complications only. Percutaneous antegrade double-J stent insertion usually is performed if retrograde ureter stenting has not been successful. However, especially in malignant obstructions, the success rate for antegrade stenting is higher than for retrograde transvesical double-J stent insertion. In the case of severe infection and bleeding after PCN JJ-stent insertion may be contraindicated so long as there is no sufficient concomitant drainage via a PCN. Lower urinary tract dysfunction should be excluded before stent placement. The complication rate is 2-4%. Consequent stent surveillance with regular stent exchange is mandatory.

Romero\n\n2005-04-01\n\nFull Text Available INTRODUCTION: Urogenital neoplasias frequently progress with obstructive uropathy due to local spreading or pelvic metastases. The urinary obstruction must be immediately relieved in order to avoid deterioration in these patients. The percutaneous nephrostomy is a safe and effective method for relief the obstruction; however the indications of such procedures have been questioned in patients with poor prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed with 43 patients (29 female and 14 male with urogenital neoplasias who were undergoing percutaneous nephrostomy during a 54-month period. The median age was 52 years. The primary tumoral site was the uterine cervix in 53.5% of patients, the bladder in 23.3%, the prostate in 11.6% and other sites in 11.6%. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 42.3% of the patients. There was no procedure-related mortality. Thirty-nine per cent of the patients died during the hospitalization period due to advanced neoplasia. The mortality rate was higher in patients with prostate cancer (p = 0.006, in patients over 52 years of age (p = 0.03 and in those who required hemodialysis before the procedure (p = 0.02. Thirty-two per cent of the patients survived long enough to undergo some form of treatment focused on the primary tumor. The survival rate was 40% at 6 months and 24.2% at 12 months. The percentage of the lifetime spent in hospitalization was 17.7%. The survival rate was higher in patients with neoplasia of the uterine cervix (p = 0.007 and in patients with 52 years of age or less (p = 0.008. CONCLUSION: Morbidity was high in this patient group; however, the majority of patients could be discharged from hospital and followed at home. Patients under 52 years of age and patients with neoplasia of the uterine cervix benefited most from the percutaneous nephrostomy when compared to patients with hormone therapy-refractory prostate cancer, bladder cancer or over 52 years of age.\n\nPercutaneous catheter drainage of intrapulmonary fluid collection\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPark, E.

We studied to evaluate the effect of percutaneous drainage in parenchymal fluid collections in the lungs. We performed percutaneous drainage of abscesses and other parenchymal fluid collections of the lungs in 15 patients. All of the procedures were performed under the fluoroscopic guidance with an 18-gauge Seldinger needle and coaxial technique with a 8-10F drainage catheter. Among 10 patients with lung abscess, 8 patients improved by percutaneous catheter drainage. In one patient, drainage was failed by the accidental withdrawal of the catheter before complete drainage. One patient died of sepsis 5 hours after the procedure. Among three patients with complicated bulla, successful drainage was done in two patients, but in the remaining patient, the procedure was failed. In one patient with intrapulmonary bronchogenic cyst, the drainage was not successful due to the thick internal contents. In one patient with traumatic hematoma, after the drainage of old blood clots, the signs of infection disappeared. Overally, of 14 patients excluding one who died, 11 patients improved with percutaneous catheter drainage and three patients did not. There were no major complications during and after the procedure.

Secondary aims were to identify common sources of errors for quality improvement measures. METHODS: Major complications sustained between January 1997-December 2002 were identified. All cases had been carried out by the interventional radiology service of a large teaching hospital with the assistance of a nurse and radiographer, under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance using a Seldinger technique. Existing department protocols specified pre-procedure antibiotics for suspected infected cases and normal coagulation studies. From records and review of case notes pertinent clinical/procedural details and eventual outcome were assessed. The following were particularly noted: adherence to protocols, clinical status at time of procedure, delay in referral, complication sustained, signs of infection or coagulopathy, timing of procedure (in versus out of hours), level of operator and technical faults. RESULTS: Ten of 318 (3.1%) cases sustained a major complication: five had sepsis alone, two haemorrhage (one with sepsis as well) and three patients had a major pelvic injury (one with sepsis as well). Thus the major sepsis and haemorrhage rates were 2.2 and 0.6%, and were within the recommended threshold limits but proportionately more complications occurred out of hours: six of 105 (5.7%) versus four of 312 (1.8%; p=0.087). Sepsis was the most serious complication and may have contributed to the death of two patients. On individual case analysis, failed instrumentation with delay to definitive renal drainage was a common factor with sepsis; but the following were contributory factors in one or more cases: omitted antibiotics (in three of 10; two became septic), technical factors in\n\nLumbar Artery Pseudoaneurysm: A Complication of Percutaneous Nephrostomy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMelody Djuimo\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available A 21 year-old male underwent nephrostomy tube insertion for hydronephrosis due to a large para-aortic adenopathy of a testicular tumor.

A pseudoaneurysm of his first left lumbar (L1 artery communicating with the nephrostomy's access site was found. An embolization was performed with coils in the left L1 artery and one of its subdivisions. Post-embolization controls revealed no bleeding. On the follow-up CT, there were no suspicious retroperitoneal mass.\n\nPercutaneous Management of Ureteral Injuries that are Diagnosed Late After Cesarean Section\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nUstunsoz, Bahri; Ugurel, Sahin; Duru, Namik Kemal; Ozgok, Yasar; Ustunsoz, Ayfer [GATA Medical Faculty, Ankara (Turkmenistan)\n\n2008-08-15\n\nWe wanted to present the results of percutaneous management of ureteral injuries that were diagnosed late after cesarean sections (CS). Twenty-two cases with 24 ureteral injuries that were diagnosed late after CS underwent percutaneous nephrostomy (PN), antegrade double J (DJ) catheter placement and balloon dilatation or a combination of these. The time for making the diagnosis was 21 +- 50.1 days. The injury site was the distal ureter in all cases (the left ureter: 13, the right ureter: 7 and bilateral: 2). Fifteen complete ureteral obstructions were detected in 13 cases. Ureteral leakage due to partial (n = 4) or complete (n = 3) rupture was noted in seven cases. Two cases had ureterovaginal fistula. All the cases were initially confirmed with antegrade pyelography and afterwards they underwent percutaneous nephrostomy. Balloon dilatation was needed in three cases. Antegrade DJ stents were placed in 10 cases, including the three cases with balloon dilatation. Repetititon of percutaneous nephrostomy with balloon dilatation and DJ stent placement was needed in one case with complete obstruction. All the cases were followed-up with US in their first week and then monthly thereafter for up to two years. Eighteen ureters (75%) were managed by percutaneous procedures alone. A total of six ureter injuries had to undergo surgery (25%). Percutaneous management is a good alternative for the treatment of post-CS ureteral injuries that are diagnosed late after CS. Percutaneous management is at least preparatory for a quarter of the cases where surgery is unavoidable\n\nPleural fluid drainage: Percutaneous catheter drainage versus surgical chest tube drainage\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIllescas, F.F.; Reinhold, C.; Atri, M.; Bret, P.M.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nOver the past 4 years, 55 cases (one transudate, 28 exudates, and 26 empymas) were drained. Surgical chest tubes alone were used in 35 drainages, percutaneous catheters alone in five drainages, and both types in 15 drainages. Percutaneous catheter drainage was successful in 12 of 20 drainages (60%). Surgical tube drainage was successful in 18 of 50 drainages (36%). The success rate for the nonempyema group was 45% with both types of drainage. For the empyema group, the success rate for percutaneous catheter drainage was 66% vs 23% for surgical tube drainage. Seven major complications occurred with surgical tube drainage, but only one major complication occurred with percutaneous catheter drainage. Radiologically guided percutaneous catheter drainage should be the procedure of choice for pleural fluid drainage. It has a higher success rate for empyemas and is associated with less complications\n\nTubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy with non-absorbable hemostatic sealant (QuikclotÂ®) versus nephrostomy tube placement: a propensity score-matched analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKoo, Kyo Chul; Park, Sang Un; Jang, Ho Sung; Hong, Chang-Hee\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) using a non-absorbable hemostatic sealant (Quikclot(Â®)) as an adjunct compared to nephrostomy tube placement in patients exhibiting significant parenchymal bleeding following PNL. We identified 113 PNL cases performed between May 2011 and October 2014. For patients with insignificant parenchymal bleeding following stone removal, defined as a clear visualization of the surgical field at full irrigation of the nephroscope, tubeless PNL was performed. For patients with significant parenchymal bleeding, we introduced the tubeless Quikclot(Â®) technique as of September 2013 and have performed it ever since. Formerly, nephrostomy placement PNL was performed. In this study, 40 Quikclot(Â®) applied PNL cases were matched with an equal number of nephrostomy placement cases by propensity scoring based on body mass index, stone size, and Guy's stone score. The mean postoperative drop in hematocrit was comparative between the Quikclot(Â®) group and the nephrostomy group on both postoperative days 1 (p = 0.459) and 2 (p = 0.325). Quikclot(Â®) application was associated with lower VAS scores throughout the postoperative period, lower cumulative analgesic requirement (p = 0.025), and with shorter hospitalization (p = 0.002). Complication rates were comparable with no need for blood transfusions in any patients. Tubeless Quikclot(Â®) PNL was safe and provided effective hemostasis of significant parenchymal bleeding. By avoiding nephrostomy placement, we were able to reduce postoperative pain, analgesic requirements, and hospitalization. Application of Quikclot(Â®) may be considered prior to nephrostomy placement in patients with significant parenchymal bleeding.\n\nPercutaneous Management of Ureteral Injuries that are Diagnosed Late After Cesarean Section\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nUstunsoz, Bahri; Ugurel, Sahin; Duru, Namik Kemal; Ozgok, Yasar; Ustunsoz, Ayfer\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe wanted to present the results of percutaneous management of ureteral injuries that were diagnosed late after cesarean sections (CS).

Methods: Ten consecutive patients (M:F = 9:1, median age: 64 years) were included in this retrospective study. The duodenal stump leakages were diagnosed in all the patients within a median of 10 days (range, 6â20). At first, the patients underwent percutaneous drainage on the day of or the day after confirmation of the presence of duodenal stump leakage, and then the Foley catheters were replaced at a median of 9 days (range, 6â38) after the percutaneous drainage. Results: Foley catheters were placed successfully in the duodenal lumen of all the patients under a fluoroscopic guide. No complication was observed during and after the procedures in all the patients. All of the patients started a regular diet 1 day after the Foley catheter placement. The patients were discharged at a median of 7 days (range, 5â14) after the Foley catheter placement. The catheters were removed in an outpatient clinic 10â58 days (median, 28) after the Foley catheter placement. Conclusions: Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous Foley catheter placement may be a safe and effective treatment option for postoperative duodenal stump leakage and may allow for shorter hospital stays, earlier oral intake, and more effective control of leakage sites\n\nUtilization of a modified Clavien Classification System in reporting complications after ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement: comparison to standard Society of Interventional Radiology practice guidelines.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDegirmenci, Tansu; Gunlusoy, Bulent; Kozacioglu, Zafer; Arslan, Murat; Ceylan, Yasin; Ors, Bumin; Minareci, Suleyman\n\n2013-06-01\n\nTo report our results on percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and classify our complications with the Standard of Practice Committee of the Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines and the modified Clavien Classification System (CCS). Three hundred eighty-nine PCN insertions were performed in 322 patients (224 men and 98 women) at our institution. PCN insertion was performed under ultrasound for dilated pelvicalyceal system and ultrasound/fluoroscopy for nondilated system. PCN was considered successful if the catheter was drained urine spontaneously. Number of complications was registered. Primary successful PCN insertion was achieved in 368 of the 389 procedures (94.6%). The success rates for nondilated and dilated systems were 82.7% and 96.4%, respectively. Major complications occurred in 9.6% and minor complications in 9.9% according to the Society of Interventional Radiology. According to the modified CCS grades I, II, III, IV, and V was 9.9%, 1.2%, 6.8%, 1.2%, and 0.3%, respectively. Age, grade of the hydronephrosis, serum creatinine levels, and mean hemoglobin levels were statistically significant parameters for the occurrence of complications on univariate analysis. The nondilated system has statistically significant parameters affecting the complication rates on multivariate analysis (PÂ = .001, odds ratio [OR]Â = 6.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]Â = 2-18.4). Percutaneous nephrostomy is a well-known procedure in the treatment of temporary or permanent drainage of an obstructed system.

We treated the lung abscesses in 14 patients (12 mean, 2 women), who did not respond to medical therapy, by percutaneous catheter drainage under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. One abscess due to infacted bulla was managed by combination treatment with alcohol sclerosing therapy. Patients were followed by serial chest radiographs every three days and the amount of drained or aspirated pus evaluated. The treatment effect and recurrence were followed by chest PA and lateral chest at one week after removal of drainage catheter. Thirteen patients (93%) recovered clinically and radiologically within 3 days. In 10 patients, drainage catheter could be removed within 2 weeks, and three patients, the catheter was kept longer. Most complications were mild; vague to moderate chest pain (n = 14), mild hemoptysis (n = 2), and pneumothorax (n = 1). One man who suffered from far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis died of asphyxia caused by massive hemoptysis 16 days after percutaneous drainage. Percutaneous catheter drainage is a safe and effective method for treating lung abscess.\n\nConcurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters for percutaneous retrieval of dislodged central venous port catheter\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMing-Tsung Chuang\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this study was to report our experience of percutaneous retrieval ofÂ dislodged port catheters with concurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters. During a 5-year period at our institute (June 2005 to July 2010, a total of 23 dislodged port catheters were retrieved. The interval between port catheter implantation and dislodged catheter retrieval ranged from 43 days to 1,414 days (mean 586.7 days. The time of delayed retrieval ranged from 1 day to 45 days (mean 4.6 days. All dislodged catheters were retrieved with the concurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters via femoral venous route. The prevalence of port catheter dislodgement at our institute was 3.4%. All dislodged port catheters were removed successfully with pigtail and loop snare catheters together. No procedure-related complications were encountered, except for transient arrhythmia in two patients, which required no medication. In conclusion, the concurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters is a feasible and easy way for percutaneous retrieval of a dislodged central venous port catheter.\n\nPrimary Report of Totally Tubeless Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Despite Pelvi-calyceal Perforations.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAghamir, Seyed Mohammad Kazem; Salavati, Alborz; Hamidi, Morteza; FallahNejad, Asghar\n\n2017-07-02\n\nNephrostomy tube insertion and/or a ureteral stent placement is advised when pelvi-calyceal perforations are encountered during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) nevertheless totally tubeless PNL is a possible exit strategy in percutaneous renal surgery therefore case series on the short term clinical outcomes of noninvasive management of iatrogenic pelvicalyceal perforations encountered during PNL is presented. During retrospective analysis of 1271 PNL procedures, 25 incidents of accidental ureteral catheter/ jj stent dislodgement during first 24 post-operative hours were identified in patient who had pelvi calyceal perforations and had no nephrostomy tube (tubeless). Thirteen patients could not be re-stented nor a nephrostomytube could have been placed for them mainly due to patient refusal or comorbid conditions. The main outcome was rate of successful noninvasive management. Eighteen Patients bearing mucosal tears (grade I trauma) or visible peri-pelvic fat (grade II) successfully recovered without need for ureteral stenting or nephrostomy (72.0%). In seven (28.0%) cases of extension of the perforation into the peri-pelvic fat (grade III), either nephrostomy insertion or JJ stenting was needed for resolution of fever and urinoma. The major limitation was the necessity to exclude patients and manage them in the standard fashion according to clinical guidelines. Iatrogenic perforations of the collecting system are quite diverse in terms of severity that result in different natural histories and not all might need urinary diversion via nephrostomy or ureteral stenting.Low grade perforations may be successfully managed in totally tubeless fashion nevertheless further prospective investigations seem warranted.\n\nLung abscess; Percutaneous catheter therapy\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHa, H.K.

All patients initially had relief of acute obstruction. However, occlusion of the percutaneous nephrostomy tubes with debris necessitated tube changes in 5 of 6 patients. In 2 patients recurrent nephrostomy tube obstruction, fever and pain led to percutaneous stone removal during pregnancy. In the remaining 4 patients the nephrostomy tubes were left indwelling through delivery. During the postpartum period 3 patients successfully underwent ureteroscopic stone extraction and 1 passed the stone spontaneously. Bacteriuria developed in each patient despite the use of preventive antibiotics. All 6 women had uncomplicated vaginal deliveries of healthy newborns and are currently asymptomatic with no evidence of obstruction. Percutaneous drainage of an acutely obstructed kidney in a pregnant woman is an effective temporizing alternative to ureteral stent placement until definitive treatment can be performed.\n\nEvaluation of the safety of latrogenic lntestinal perforation during placement of percutaneous drainage catheter in rabbit\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLee, Choon Hyeong; Oh, Joo Hyung; Park, Ga Young; Shin, Hong Sub; Kim, In Sub; Yoon, Yup; Lee, Dong Ho; Ko, Young Tae; Choi, Woo Suk; Lim, Joo Won\n\n1996-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the safety of transgression of the bowel during intraperitoneal percutaneous catheter placement in an animal model.

The latter may either be inserted via the umbilicus or percutaneously. Because of the complications associated with umbilical venous catheter use, many neonatal units prefer to use percutaneously inserted catheters following the initial stabilisation period. The method of parenteral nutrition delivery may affect nutrient input and consequently growth and development. Although potentially more difficult to place, percutaneous central venous catheters may be more stable than peripheral cannulae, and need less frequent replacement. These delivery methods may also be associated with different risks of adverse events, including acquired systemic infection and extravasation injury. To determine the effect of infusion via a percutaneous central venous catheter versus a peripheral cannula on nutrient input, growth and development, and complications including systemic infection, or extravasation injuries in newborn infants who require parenteral nutrition. The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - February 2007), EMBASE (1980 - February 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews. Randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of delivering parenteral nutrition via a percutaneous central venous catheter versus a peripheral cannulae in neonates.

Nineteen patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis were selected for intraperitoneal port-catheter placement in order to perform intracavitary receptor-immuno- or radio-immunotherapy with Ytrium-90. All the procedures were performed percutaneously under US and fluoro guidance; the insertion site for catheters was chosen according to abdominal conditions and US findings: all devices were implanted at the lower abdominal quadrants. All patients were followed up with CT and US according to the therapy protocol. The procedure was successfully completed in 15/19 patients, in 4 being contraindicated by peritoneal adhesions. No procedure-related complications and device occlusions during therapy were observed; one catheter displaced 7 months later the placement. In our experience, this procedure was feasible, reliable and easy to perform, allowing the correct administration of the planned intracavitary therapy. Peritoneal adhesions are the main limitation of peritoneal port placement.

Methods:Patients were diagnosed with hyperkalaemia with serum potassium >5.0 mmol/L and hyperkalaemia was graded as mild(5.0-6.0 mmol/L), moderate(6.1-7.0 mmol/L) or severe(>7.1 mmol/L).Data on age, sex, clinical presentation, presence of concurrent disease, creatinine, potassium, haemoglobin concentration, time interval in doing the nephrostomy since their first presentation, any prenephrostomy medical correction of hyperkalaemia and complications were collected. Results:A total of61 patients(40 males and21 females) with mean age of69.7 years(ranged35 to94 years) underwent69 procedures.Prior to the nephrostomy, the serum potassium was mildly elevated in42 cases, moderately elevated in17 cases and severely elevated in10 cases.The overall mean level of potassium before intervention was6.1 mmol/L(range:5.1 mmol/L-9.3 mmol/L).Forty(58%) had nephrostomy without prior medical treatment of the hyperkalaemia.The mean serum potassium in these patients was5.6 mmol/L(range:5.1 mmol/L-7.5 mmol/L).Twentynine (42%) had medical treatment of the hyperkalaemia prior to nephrostomy.The mean potassium level in these patients was reduced from6.7 mmol/L(range5.4 mmol/L-9.3 mmol/L) before medical treatment to5.8 mmol/L(4.0 mmol/L-7.4 mmol/L).Five patients(7%) had complications from percutaneous nephrostomy including temporary atrial fibrillation in3 patients and transient pyrexia in2 patients. Conclusions:Percutaneous nephrostomy as the initial management for hyperkalaemia from ureteric obstruction is a safe procedure with acceptable complication rates.\n\n[A clinical observation of percutaneous balloon dilation and maintenance percutaneous transhepatic cholangial catheter drainage for treatment of 21 patients with benign biliary strictures and difficult endoscopy].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPan, Jie; Shi, Hai-feng; Li, Xiao-guang; Zhang, Xiao-bo; Liu, Wei; Jin, Zheng-yu; Hong, Tao; Yang, Ai-ming; Yang, Ning\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTo investigate the value of percutaneous balloon dilation and percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) catheter maintenance in the treatment of benign biliary strictures. The clinical data of 21 patients with benign biliary strictures at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from June 2005 to June 2011 were retrospectively studied, in which 12 patients in severe stricture (stenosis > 70%) were treated with percutaneous balloon dilation and PTCD catheter placed across the stricture, while another 9 patients in median stricture (stenosis stenosis was seen in 2 patients. A severe complication with biliary artery branch rupture and massive hemobilia was seen in 1 patient during balloon dilation. Of the 9 patients only treated with 1 - 12 months (median: 6 months) of PTCD catheter placement, 7 patients had the catheter successfully removed. In the follow-up of 5 - 18 months (median: 8 months), patency of bile duct was preserved in 5 of 7 patients, and recurrent stenosis was seen in 2 patients. No severe complication occurred. When endoscopy therapy is failed or the patient can't undergo endoscopy therapy, the percutaneous balloon dilation and PTCD catheter maintenance method is an effective alternative therapeutic approach in the treatment of benign biliary strictures. The moderate benign biliary stricture may be effectively treated only by the PTCD catheter maintenance method.\n\nStabilization of a percutaneously implanted port catheter system for hepatic artery chemotherapy infusion\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShindoh, Noboru; Ozaki, Yutaka; Kyogoku, Shinsuke; Yamana, Daigo; Sumi, Yukiharu; Katayama, Hitoshi\n\n1999-01-01\n\nA port catheter system for hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy was implanted percutaneously via the left subclavian artery in 41 patients for treatment of unresectable liver metastases.

The abscesses (5 unilateral and 1 bilateral) were completely drained using a posterior or lateral approach. The abscess volume was 70 to 700 ml (mean 300 ml) and the duration of drainage 5 to 11 days (mean 7 days). Immediate local symptomatic improvement was achieved in all patients, and there were no procedural complications. CT follow-up at 3 to 9 months showed normalization in 5 patients, 2 of whom are still in medical therapy. One patient, who did not take the medication regularly, had a recurrent abscess requiring new catheter drainage after which the fluid collection disappeared. Percutaneous drainage represents an efficient and attractive alternative to surgical drainage as a supplement to medical therapy in the management of patients with large tuberculous psoas abscesses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two iliopsoas abscesses in 21 patients (11 women, 10 men) aged between 18 and 66 years (mean 36 years) were treated with PCD. Abdominal CT demonstrated the iliopsoas abscesses, which were definitively determined by Gram staining and aspirate cultures. Twenty of the 22 iliopsoas abscesses were primary and two were secondary. All PCD procedures were performed under local anaesthesia using a single-step trocar technique (n=19) or Seldinger technique (n=3). RESULTS: PCD was an effective treatment in 21 out of the 22 iliopsoas abscesses. Recurrence was seen in three abscesses as minimal residual collections. Two of them resolved spontaneously with anti-tuberculous regimen. One required percutaneous needle aspiration. The procedure failed in a diabetic patient with a secondary abscess, who died due to sepsis. The length of time that catheters remained in place ranged from 21 to 75 days (mean 59.7 days). Complications included catheter dislocation in four abscesses, which required removal of dislocated catheters and indwelling new ones. CONCLUSION: CT-guided PCD is a safe and effective front-line treatment of iliopsoas abscesses. Surgery should be reserved for failure of PCD and presence of contraindications to PCD\n\nA COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PERCUTANEOUS AND OPEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUESFOR PERITONEAL CATHETER PLACEMENT.\n\nLENUS (Irish Health Repository)\n\nMedani, Samar\n\n2012-05-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the preferred available option of renal replacement therapy for a significant number of end-stage kidney disease patients. A major limiting factor to the successful continuation of PD is the long-term viability of the PD catheter (PDC). Bedside percutaneous placement of the PDC is not commonly practiced despite published data encouraging use of this technique. Its advantages include faster recovery and avoidance of general anesthesia.â¢ METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of 313 PDC insertions at our center, comparing all percutaneous PDC insertions between July 1998 and April 2010 (group P, n = 151) with all surgical PDC insertions between January 2003 and April 2010 (group S, n = 162).â¢ RESULTS: Compared with group P patients, significantly more group S patients had undergone previous abdominal surgery or PDC insertion (41.8% vs 9.3% and 33.3% vs 3.3% respectively, p = 0.00). More exit-site leaks occurred in group P than in group S (20.5% vs 6.8%, p = 0.002). The overall incidence of peritonitis was higher in group S than in group P (1 episode in 19 catheter-months vs 1 episode in 26 catheter-months, p = 0.017), but the groups showed no significant difference in the peritonitis rate within 1 month of catheter insertion (5% in group P vs 7.4% in group S, p =0.4) or in poor initial drainage or secondary drainage failure (9.9% vs 11.7%, p = 0.1, and 7.9% vs 12.3%, p = 0.38, for groups P and S respectively). Technical survival at 3 months was significantly better for group P than for group S (86.6% vs 77%, p = 0.037); at 12 months, it was 77.7% and 68.7% respectively (p = 0.126). No life-threatening complications attributable to the insertion of the PDC occurred in either group.â¢ CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates further encouraging outcomes of percutaneous PDC placement compared with open surgical placement. However, the members of the percutaneous insertion group were primarily a\n\nRenal access in PNL under sonographic guidance: Do we really need to insert an open end ureteral catheter in dilated renal systems? A prospective randomized study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEryildirim, Bilal; Tuncer, Murat; Camur, Emre; Ustun, Fatih; Tarhan, Fatih; Sarica, Kemal\n\n2017-10-03\n\nTo evaluate the true necessity of open end ureteral catheter insertion in patients with moderate to severe pelvicalyceal system dilation treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) under sonographic guidance. 50 cases treated with PNL under sonographic guidance in prone position for solitary obstructing renal stones were evaluated. Patients were randomly divided into two groups; Group 1: Patients in whom a open end ureteral catheter was inserted prior to the procedure; Group 2: Patients receiving no catheter before PNL. In addition to the duration of the procedure as a whole and also all relevant stages as well, radiation exposure time, hospitalization period, mean nephrostomy tube duration, mean drop in Hb levels and all intra and postoperative complications have been evaluated. Mean size of the stones was 308.5 Â± 133.2 mm2. Mean total duration of the PNL procedure in cases with open end ureteral catheter was significantly longer than the other cases (p < 0.001). Evaluation of the outcomes of the PNL procedures revealed no statistically significant difference between two groups regarding the stone-free rates (86% vs 84%). Additionally, there was no significant difference with respect to the duration of nephrostomy tube, hospitalization period and secondary procedures needed, complication rates as well as the post-operative Hb drop levels in both groups (p = 0.6830). Our results indicate that the placement of an open end ureteral catheter prior to a PNL procedure performed under sonographic access may not be indicated in selected cases presenting with solitary obstructing renal pelvic and/or calyceal stones.\n\nUsefulness of real-time three-dimensional ultrasonography in percutaneous nephrostomy: an animal study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHongzhang, Hong; Xiaojuan, Qin; Shengwei, Zhang; Feixiang, Xiang; Yujie, Xu; Haibing, Xiao; Gallina, Kazobinka; Wen, Ju; Fuqing, Zeng; Xiaoping, Zhang; Mingyue, Ding; Huageng, Liang; Xuming, Zhang\n\n2018-05-17\n\nTo evaluate the effect of real-time three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography (US) in guiding percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). A hydronephrosis model was devised in which the ureters of 16 beagles were obstructed. The beagles were divided equally into groups 1 and 2. In group 1, the PCN was performed using real-time 3D US guidance, while in group 2 the PCN was guided using two-dimensional (2D) US. Visualization of the needle tract, length of puncture time and number of puncture times were recorded for the two groups. In group 1, score for visualization of the needle tract, length of puncture time and number of puncture times were 3, 7.3 Â± 3.1 s and one time, respectively. In group 2, the respective results were 1.4 Â± 0.5, 21.4 Â± 5.8 s and 2.1 Â± 0.6 times. The visualization of needle tract in group 1 was superior to that in group 2, and length of puncture time and number of puncture times were both lower in group 1 than in group 2. Real-time 3D US-guided PCN is superior to 2D US-guided PCN in terms of visualization of needle tract and the targeted pelvicalyceal system, leading to quick puncture.
