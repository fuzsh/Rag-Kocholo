        "text": "Few have not heard of the Damascus Blood Libel of 1840: Jews in Damascus were accused of a murder in order to use the victim’s blood to bake Matza. Innocent Jews were imprisoned, several were tortured or died. Moses Montefiore and Adolphe Crémieux embarked on a mission to entreat the Ottoman sultan to condemn future blood libels. But 13 years later, another Blood Libel was prevented in the city of Aleppo, thanks to a vigilant Jewish baker named Moosa. Halakha of the Day has the story:\n\nThe pleas of the desperate Jewish community of Syria for the influential European countries to intervene were ignored by the British and the French. Several community leaders and rabbis were tortured by the Turkish authorities in Damascus, who seized the opportunity to confiscate property and take by force the possessions of the most affluent families in the community. The Damascus Libel had devastating consequences for the local Jewish population …\n\nA few years later, on the 13th of Sivan in 1853 in the city of Aleppo, a blood libel was avoided just in time. While there is not much documentation in this case as in the case of the Damascus libel, one known version is that on that date the dead body of a child, who died or was killed in dubious circumstances, was “planted” by a group of Gentiles in the house of the Jewish baker at midnight. The antisemites plan was to arrive in the morning with the police and accuse the baker of a ritual murder. Then, start riots, looting the community, etc. A Jewish baker was the perfect target for this accusation, since he would be held responsible for “using Christian blood to prepare matzot, or other ritual foods.”\n\nMiraculously, the baker (named Moossa, Moshe in Arabic) woke up in the night. He discovered the body, understood the potential threat, and got rid of it.When the authorities arrived in the morning they could not find anything.The baker informed the rabbis of the city what had happened and the rabbis said that HaShem , in His mercy, had saved the Jewish community of Aleppo from a terrible tragedy, and instituted that the 13th of Sivan be remembered as “Nes Moossan” (The miracle that happened through Moossa) and in remembrance of this miracle, we skip the recitation of the Viduy (confession), and that is a significant act of liturgical celebration.\n\nRead article in full\n\nThe desperate situation of Afghan women under Taliban rule has prompted Giulia Boukhobza to write this heartfelt Times of Israel blog, protesting the apathy of the West’s ‘woke’ brigade to women’s rights in the Muslim world. As a Jew and a woman, she was well acquainted with the way men harassed girls in Libya. Giulia fled her native Tripoli for Italy in 1967, before re-settling in the USA. (With thanks: Denis)\n\nI was born in Tripoli, the capital of Libya, in 1951. I am the second oldest of six sisters and two brothers. Even though Libya was in some ways more cosmopolitan than Afghanistan — we had movie theaters and concerts, an American airbase, and Italian schools where I had my education — Muslim women still had to wear a burqa in the streets, covering the entire body except for a mesh screen to see out of, and did not work outside the house.\n\nWe, as non-Muslim (Jewish) females, were allowed to wear Western clothes. Yet, I knew from a very young age that I belonged to the worst group of all: Being both a female and an “infidel.” You can argue which was worse. In my view, it was being a female.\n\nWearing Western dress made me a perpetual target. Or, to paraphrase the countless men and boys who tried to pinch me, touch my breasts, and expose themselves to me (and my sisters and female friends), I was a “whore,” a “sinner,” a “prostitute” and a “dog.”\n\nThey would attempt to “bump” into me while walking, or, if I was in the water, come from underneath to try to remove my bathing suit. I could feel their repressed lust coupled with unbridled hatred. My fear was indescribable. I became so traumatized that, to this day, decades later, I am still reluctant to enter the water and can barely swim.\n\nSurely, their hatred was a function of religious indoctrination coupled with the frustration of desiring women but being taught that their own women had to be essentially hidden from sight and “pure.” Yet strangely, because I did not know any better, because I had never seen the world outside Libya, I somehow adjusted to this life. I instinctively understood the tactics for survival – try to stay quiet, keep my head down, cross the street if a male approaches. And, yes, confide in my girlfriends in a similar position for the sake of my own mental health, but never with my parents or brothers in order to protect them from their own sense of helpless rage.\n\nAfter all, we were a tiny minority within a larger minority of non-Muslims in an overwhelmingly Muslim-majority society. And we felt it. We girls more than others.\n\nI remember vividly an episode that encapsulates so much for me.\n\nA new girl from Greece arrived in our school. She and I become fast friends. Earlier, she had lived in Italy, and I thought she was sophisticated, elegant, and beautiful. One afternoon, she and I were walking in the center of Tripoli and some men started groping us. She immediately began screaming at them. I saw danger. I took her hand and started running with her, entering the first store I saw.\n\nBreathless, I told her she cannot yell like that. We could have ended up being punched, killed, or imprisoned on some trumped-up charge. I’ll never forget her reaction. She looked at me as if I were crazy and said: “No, they can’t do that to me. I have my Greek embassy here to protect me.”\n\nI came home and broke my own rule by telling that story to my mother. Her reaction was that from now on I could only meet my new friend at my place or hers, but not outside because if something happened, I did not have any “embassy” to help me.\n\nAnd then in 1967, after a hate-fest that saw some Jewish families slaughtered and my family almost burned alive by a mob, we were allowed to leave Libya with one bag each and the equivalent of thirty dollars per person. I was never to return.\n\nItaly offered us refuge. The ten of us arrived on July 14th, crammed into one room in a hostel, and four days later two sisters and I started working to help our family survive. At the time, we were 17, 16 and 15 years old.\n\nLife was not easy and we were as poor as church mice, but I still remember that period in Rome as one of the happiest times of my life. It took me a while to understand exactly why. And then one day it came to me. It was the discovery of freedom. Freedom to be me. Freedom to be a female. Freedom to walk and not be scared of being harassed. Freedom to appreciate that when young Italian boys would flirt with me, they knew they had no right to touch me or call me a “whore” just because I didn’t wear a burqa.\n\nNow at the age of 70, I cannot even begin to fathom living without that freedom, or, even worse, that my granddaughters would have it denied to them.\n\nRead article in full\n\nMore from Giulia Boukhobza\n\nIsrael’s Supreme Court has rejected a demand by Moroccan Jews to be recognised as Holocaust survivors eligible for compensation. According to Haaretz, the plaintiffs, represented by lawyer David Yadid, had not managed to show objective evidence of ‘fear’ among Moroccan Jews. In addition, the Vichy regime was thought to be acting independently of the Nazis. The ruling by Israel’s top court was not viewed as a total loss by the plaintiffs, as some benefits were afforded to Moroccan immigrants during their long legal battle. This case was for Moroccan Jews to receive monthly renta payments as Holocaust survivors. However, Yadid is determined to ask for a re-hearing. See my comment below. (With thanks: Imre)\n\nThe ruling described the suffering of Moroccan Jews under France’s Nazi-aligned Vichy government, which controlled Morocco at the time and pressured the Moroccan authorities to implement antisemitic legislation. Morocco responded by issuing orders that restricted Jews’ ability to acquire housing, education and employment, it noted.\n\nThe suit, which was filed against the Finance Ministry’s Holocaust Survivors Rights Authority, had argued that these restrictions “gave legitimacy to harming Moroccan Jews” and resulted in “extreme tension and fear,” and therefore deserve recognition under the law.\n\nJustices Neal Hendel, David Mintz, and Yosef Elron agreed that Moroccan Jews suffered antisemitic abuse from the authorities. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs don’t qualify for compensation under the law since the harm they suffered “consisted mainly of a reduced ability to integrate into the job market and acquire an education outside the Jewish community, alongside undermining some community members’ ability to choose their place of residence. These restrictions, which weren’t imposed in the territory of the German Reich but on Moroccan soil, don’t meet the demands of the law.”\n\nMoreover, the ruling said, the Moroccan authorities made their own decisions separately from the main Vichy government, and the Germans had little influence over them. In fact, Morocco rejected some of the Germans’ requests, thereby disproving the petition’s claim that the Vichy government in Morocco was actually worse than the Nazis.\n\nAs for the plaintiffs’ subjective experience of fear and tension, the ruling said they needed to show objective evidence that this fear was warranted. The justices accepted the lower court’s finding that the evidence offered was unpersuasive, just as they accepted its finding that the restrictions imposed did not amount to “deprivation of freedom’.\n\nAs Yadid noted, the plaintiffs’ battle wasn’t completely without fruit. In 2015, the treasury decided to grant financial benefits to survivors from Morocco and Algeria on account of the restrictions they suffered. This consisted mainly of an annual grant of 4,000 shekels ($1,240). And three years later, the Claims Conference decided to give them one-time grants of 2,500 euros\n\nIn summary, the justices wrote that “the role of the historian is separate from that of the court, and that’s a good thing.\n\n“The test of history has many participants, and is subject to additions and updates which are inappropriate for a concrete legal procedure. The law, on the other hand, works according to precise rules, with all the pros and cons that that entails.”\n\nNevertheless, Yadid accused the treasury of “discriminating between victims of the Nazi regime out of budgetary considerations,” pointing out that the Jews of Libya and Tunisia had been recognized as victims of Nazi persecution. He added that he will consider asking the court to rehear the issue with an expanded panel of justices.\n\nRead article in full\n\nMy comment: Supporters of the judgement argue that the class action was a cynical move to extract money from the state seventy-five years after the fact. However, the court’s distinction between the role of the historian and that of the court is mystifiying: surely court rulings should be based on historical facts? On the other hand, the court has been criticised for being influenced by budgetary considerations and its judgement interpreted as evidence of continued discrimination against Mizrahi Jews.\n\nBased on 24,000 questionnaires he sent out to claimants in the class action, an expert witness told Point of No Return:\n\n‘ 55,000 Jews were forced out of their homes in Casablanca and Fez. They were ordered to live in the crowded Jewish run-down mellahs so that they could be prepared for eventual evacuation and deportation. After the war, these people did not regain their property. The Vichy regime was allowed to continue after the Allied landings on 9 November 1942, Operation Torch, until 1944. Vice-President of the Vichy regime Xavier Vallet, deputy to Vichy leader and criminal Maréchal Petain, was convicted as a Nazi war criminal after the war. Vallet initiated the Nuremberg laws in Morocco. Such documentation would have been enough to convict Eichmann.’\n\nThe witness cited the 37 forced labour camps where Moroccan Jews – French colonial subjects – were interned. He claimed that the King had instigated anti-Jewish riots in January and February 1943 in Fez, Meknes and Rabat, and dismissed 60 Jews from their jobs, although he later re-instated them.\n\nAll these factors would have created a climate of fear.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that deportees and inmates in French camps in France, two-thirds of whom were Sephardic Balkan and North African Jews – recent immigrants to France – received reparations from Germany.\n\nThe Moroccan case in the Israeli courts recalls a similar ruling against Farhud survivors, who had argued unsuccessfully, after five legal rounds, that the 1941 pogrom in Iraq was a Nazi-inspired event.\n\nIn any event, we have not heard the last of this story.\n\nIn September 1948, Shafik Ades, the richest and best-connected Jew in Iraq, was hanged in front of his newly-constructed villa, sending shock waves through the Jewish community. Joe Samuels was 17 at the time. He remembers becoming hysterical when he saw the photograph of Ades’ hanging body on the front page of the Alzaman newspaper. Much later, Joe was told the following (uncorroborated) story by Tawfik Zanki, who in turn had heard it from his father. Zanki moved from Basra to Los Angeles in 1996.\n\nAfter the failure of the Arab countries to eliminate Israel in the war of 1948, the Arabs channelled their anger into blaming their Jewish citizens. They openly expressed their mistrust and hatred in the media, such as the evening newspaper Al Yaktha and the mouthpiece of the Istiklal (Independence) party. Articles were filled with hate for the Jews, calling them spies and a fifth column.\n\nAfter WWII the British Army offered to sell as scrap metal what was left of their war equipment and cars which they didn’t want to take back, some of which were still usable. They left the scrap behind at the Shieba camp near Basra.\n\nShafik Ades and a Muslim merchant friend Nadji Al Khutheiry formed a company and bought some of the equipment. Some they sold in Iraq and some they sold to Italy. All sales were cleared with permission from the Iraqi government.\n\nA low-level journalist who was attempting to extract money from Ades threatened to write an article about him in the press. When Shafik refused, the journalist went ahead and published the article, accusing him of shipping war material to Israel through Italy and help her win the war. The article accused Ades alone and did not mention his partner, Al Khutheiry. The article was picked u[p by other media and from there it became a national story.\n\nAdes was then arrested, accused and tried in a special army court in Basra on September 11-13, 1948. The president of the court, Abdallah Al Na’asany, condemned him (not his partner Al Khutheiry) to death by hanging and confiscated his assets. He was executed on September 23, 1948 in front of his villa, whose construction had just been completed. His body was displayed all day long.\n\nShafik had been warned through his connections to flee to Iran through the Shatt al Arab waterway, but he refused, sure of his innocence, and that his close friendship with the Regent and many ministers would protect him. Of course, nothing helped; they needed a scapegoat and it was he – and not his Muslim partner, Al Khutheiry.\n\nMore about Shafik Ades\n\nIt is not well known that aboard the legendary Exodus ship, carrying over 4,000 Holocaust survivors, was a group of 50 young Zionist boys from North Africa. Ynet News has the story (with thanks: Josh):\n\nThe Exodus is the most famous illegal immigrant ship in Zionist history. Its Hebrew name is “Exodus from Europe”, but, it turns out, there were also about 50 young immigrants from North Africa on board, whose story is almost untold. Next month, the Palmach House will host a conference of the first Exodus immigrants on the subject of the group of young people from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria who were on the ship.\n\nA few of the Exodus immigrants from North Africa still survive. Shlomo Busquila, 92, a native of Casablanca, is one of those boys. “Until the age of 17, I lived with my family, and then I and another 7- 6 friends sailed on a ship on the way to Marseille in France, to join a Zionist network that would prepare us to immigrate to Eretz Israel and join the kibbutz,” Busquila recalled. “We went to the city of Toulouse, we went through the training in July 1947 and the agency informed us that we would board an illegal immigrant ship of the ‘Aliyah Bet.’ We went to the city of Sète in the south of France, and boarded a huge ship of 4,500 immigrants.”\n\n“The journey to Haifa lasted seven days, and only on the ship did we realize that most of the immigrants were Holocaust survivors, survivors of the difficult concentration camps in Europe,” says Busquila. “When we arrived in Haifa, the British put us on three British ships – 1,500 immigrants on each ship – and informed us that the ships were being sent back to where they had left, to the port in the south of France. From there we arrived in Hamburg. I arrived (in Israel) six days after the establishment of the state, and already in Haifa I was drafted into the Palmach and fought on the Burma road (to Jerusalem) and the Latrun area. “\n\nWhy is the story of the aliya of North Africans on the Exodus unfamiliar? Busquila says: “Our number was small, we were not Holocaust survivors and we came from orderly homes, so we did not talk about it. It is clear and logical that the myth should actually be about the Holocaust survivors who were on the ship, and not the young people from North Africa. We were a cohesive group of French speakers: “Africa aboard the Exodus.“\n\nMichael Ayalon (94), also a native of Casablanca, remembers the difficult voyage. “There was almost nothing to eat, but the best thing that ever happened to me about the Exodus (was meeting my wife),” says Ayalon, “I knew my wife Hava who was a Holocaust survivor from Hungary. She came with Hashomer Hatzair and I with the Scouts. I studied in Morocco – and my wife knew a little Hebrew from Hashomer Hatzair. “\n\nFor years, the disappearance of Rabbi Yeshaya Attia was an unsolved mystery, until the journal of a Victorian lady traveller came to light. Lydia Collins reveals the truth in this article published in the Sephardi Bulletin (May 2010):\n\nThe first Sephardi synagogue in Manchester opened in 1874. The first official minister was Reverend Henry Pereira Mendes, but fifteen years earlier a group of Aleppo merchants had made an attempt to employ their own rabbi in Manchester. Before the Sephardim had their own synagogue they attended the Ashkenazi synagogue, but it is clear that at the same time they were holding private Sephardi services. The origins of the community were mixed, each group having their own preferred form of service, and the Aleppans, a strongly independent and cohesive group, wanted a rabbi of their own.\n\nIn 1859 a group of merchants in Aleppo made a contract with Rabbi Yeshaya Attia in which he undertook to go to Manchester to serve the colony of Aleppo merchants there. The signatories of the document were Daniel and Eliezer Silvera, Jacob and Nissim Gubbay, Hillel Moses Sassoon, Shammah and Ades, Hara and Raphael, Btesh and Laniado. The Rabbi never arrived in Manchester and the details of his subsequent history have been disclosed in an unexpected source.\n\nIn 1855 an Englishwoman by the name of Mary Eliza Rogers travelled to the Middle East where her brother Edward Thomas Rogers was British Vice Consul at Haifa. During her four-year stay she visited many of the holy places and learnt to speak and read Arabic. She also kept a detailed journal which was later published. In her book she recounts a curious story about one of her fellow travellers on her return journey to England in 1859.\n\nOn 4 June 1859 she embarked at Beirut on board the Demetrius, a merchant ship bound for Liverpool via Alexandria, Malta and the Straits of Gibraltar. Two days later they anchored at Alexandria to take on a cargo of cotton. The captain of the ship knew no Arabic and wanted to speak to one of the deck passengers who had remained on board so he asked Miss Rogers to act as interpreter. She approached the man and passed on the captain’s message and they then fell into conversation. She later described him as aged about thirty, obviously intelligent and wearing the kind of dress usually worn by town Arabs. He told her he was going to some Syrian merchants at Manchester to whom he had been recommended and asked her how to find his way from Liverpool to Manchester as he knew no-one in England and spoke no English. At Miss Rogers’ request he wrote down his name in Arabic characters “Shaayea Ateyas” and she in turn wrote down in English and Arabic script the names of the three Manchester merchants he was to visit, and also provided a letter of introduction to a Syrian merchant at Liverpool. During the subsequent voyage they talked often and he sometimes read to her from the collection of printed books and manuscripts that he had with him.\n\nBy 26 June the ship had crossed the Bay of Biscay and they were within a day’s journey of Liverpool. Rabbi Shaayea’s health was beginning to cause concern. He had brought his own food for the journey but this had been inadequate and he refused all other offers of nourishment. On the night of the 26th there was a heavy swell on the sea and Miss Rogers passed on to Shaayea the captain’s advice to spend the night in a sheltered part of the deck where he would be safe. The following morning he was nowhere to be found and after a thorough search of the ship they were forced to conclude that he had gone overboard in the night.\n\nThe next day, Tuesday 28 June, the ship docked at Liverpool. The Turkish consul at Manchester ordered an inquiry into the disappearance and Miss Rogers was called to give evidence. As the only passenger who had spoken regularly to him she was the star witness and provided a full account of the events which were later reported to the Ottoman authorities. Thus, by a strange coincidence, a Victorian lady traveller had long ago recorded the fate of Manchester’ s first intended Sephardi rabbi.\n\nSources: Yaron Harel, ‘The first Jews from Aleppo in Manchester: new documentary evidence’ in Association for Jewish Studies Review 23:2 (1998), pp 191-202.

London, 1862.\n\nHad it not been for Life photojournalist John Phillips, the destruction of the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem by the Arab Legion in 1948, now ignored by western pundits and politicians, would not have been documented. Phillips evaded the Arab censor to smuggle out poignant pictures. They were later published as the book, A Will to Survive. Richard Pollock takes up the story in JNS News:\n\nPhillips faced personal danger to do the shoot. He entered the Middle East undercover and wore the uniform of the Arab Legion, a British-created Arab army led by British officers, many of whom stayed on with their units to fight the Jews. “Mistaking me for a British officer, the Arab populace left me alone,” he wrote.\n\nHe was appalled about the Arab censorship. “Aware that the sack of the Jewish Quarter would shock the western world, Arab authorities across the Middle East tried to prevent the news from leaking out. Jerusalem could not be mentioned under any circumstances,” he wrote.\n\n“I knew my pictures of the agony of the Jewish Quarter would end up in a censor’s wastepaper basket. I did not want this to happen and decided to smuggle them out of the Middle East.”\n\nPhillips’ first job was to meet the pro-Nazi Arab fanatic, Fawzi al-Qawuqji, the field commander of the so-called Arab Liberation Army—a separate, brutal volunteer force specifically created to battle the Jews.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Fawzi lived in Nazi Germany alongside Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and held the official rank of colonel in the Wehrmacht, the German army. The Nazis awarded Fawzi a chauffeured car and an apartment, along with other privileges.\n\nImpulsively, Fawzi invited Phillips to lunch. He wrote that he was offended by what he saw. “There was a brutishness about the way they roared with laughter and slapped their thighs in delight at the prospect of wallowing in Jewish blood,” he wrote.\n\nAfterwards, Philips ran into a Yugoslav mercenary who had witnessed their lunch meeting. “What rabble,” Phillips wrote, quoting the mercenary. “They have no idea what a real fighting outfit is like. I do. I was with the Waffen S.S.”\n\nIn fact, that soldier was not alone. The ranks of Arab Liberation Army included demobilized Nazi Wehrmacht Army soldiers, including the brutal SS, along with pro-Nazi mercenary forces from across Europe.\n\nPhillips admired the Jewish defiance. “While the Old Quarter might well be indefensible, they would defend it. This was the Jerusalem that Jewish people around the world asked to return to in their prayers.”\n\nThe pre-war atmospherics shocked Phillips, a veteran World War II photographer. “Weapons were peddled on Arab street corners as they were Jaffa oranges. British deserters, German S.S., Polish and Yugoslav mercenaries hired by the Arabs performed acts of sabotage.”\n\nPhillips traveled the city with a British deserter. He was astonished by the destruction of its synagogues. “Whenever we paused to catch our breath, all I seemed to see were damaged synagogues,” he wrote.\n\nHe also saw the destruction of the famed Pirate Josef Synagogue. “From a spot near the Wailing Wall I could see Porat Josef synagogue rising in the distance across no-man’s-land. The synagogue, with its adjoining Talmudic schools and academy, was disintegrating behind billows of smoke. The massive walls were coming down in a rising torrent of stone debris. Stunned by this spectacle of wanton destruction, I wondered how many tons of TNT the Arab Liberation Army would squander to reduce this seat of learning to dust.”\n\nFor 11 days and nights, the battle raged. On May 28, Jerusalem fell to the Arabs. “By day the Arabs blasted their way into the Jewish Quarter with their artillery,” wrote Phillips. “On May 28 the exhausted Israeli fighters surrendered.”\n\nEventually, Jerusalem Mayor Mordechai Weingarten walked in to sign the surrender documents.\n\nThe surrender of the Jewish Quarter now was official. But the city’s tragedy was only beginning. “Had any Jews decided to remain in the Old City he would have been homeless within hours and probably dead by nightfall. Most of the civilians were Orthodox Jews. The men wore beards and side curls, wide-brimmed black felt hats and long black coats. The women wore babushkas. They were descendants of families that had lived in the Jewish Quarter for centuries. Now they were given just one hour to pack and get ready to leave.”\n\nHe describes the stunned civilians. “Dazed by the shelling, the civilians gathered up their belongings and trudged off to Ashkenazi Square.”\n\nAfter the Jews fled, Phillips walked back to witness wild Arab looting and arson. “Arab civilians … had come leaping over the rooftops like a swarm of locusts to loot. In their frenzied path fires sprang up. Black smoke billowed out of windows, while bright yellow flames licked wooden balconies. The entire quarter was now afire. The smell of burning mingled with the stench of death.”\n\nPhillips continued to follow the fires. “Outside the Jewish Quarter burned like a pyre. On May 29 the Jewish Quarter was charred and a burned-out shell. Down Beit El a proud Moslem led the way, followed by his barefoot wife carrying three wooden containers of Sephardic scrolls from a nearby synagogue.”\n\nThirty years later, in 1976, Phillips published Survive. Many of his photos were unveiled at Jerusalem’s Israel Museum. Former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir wrote a short introduction to the book.\n\nWith the help of then-Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, he was able to meet with 51 of the survivors he had photographed.\n\nWhat Phillips said affected him was the Jews’ complete lack of self-pity. “What struck me most while talking to these people, from the Chief Rabbi of Haifa to a Jerusalem housekeeper, was that none indulged in self-pity.”\n\nToday’s Jews still don’t seek pity, but they should demand justice. The sacredness of the Old Jewish Quarter and its brutal destruction by the Arabs need to be widely republicized. There needs to be an international historical reckoning of their 1948 ethnic cleansing. Most importantly, the Jewish community must stand up for historical truths and strongly denounce the Palestinians’ baseless claims for the eastern part of the city.\n\nRead article in full"
