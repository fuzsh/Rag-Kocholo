Lleyton Hewitt has become a father for the third time this week as the former number one announced that wife Bec had given birth to an as-yet-unnamed baby girl.

Bermuda-based Hewitt said the infant would be named shortly. The Australian said on his personal website that he is “elated.” “Bec, Mia, Cruz and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl into our family last Tuesday,” Hewitt said.

“Mum and baby are great! Dad, big sister and brother elated.” Hewitt’s family already includes four-year-old sister Mia and Cruz, one.
