        "text": "THERE will be no more strains of ‘c’mon’ and seen that famous inverted salute has been seen for the final time.\n\nLleyton Hewitt has drawn the curtain on his glittering tennis career.\n\nIt’s been quite the journey as well, from a 17-year-old upstart knocking off Andre Agassi on his way to winning his first tournament in Adelaide to his current lofty standing in the game.\n\nAnd he has amassed some amazing statistics along the way.\n\nThis defines Lleyton Hewitt by the numbers.\n\n1 - the top player in the world for 80 weeks.\n\nFor 18 months shortly after his US Open title win in late 2001 to the middle of 2003, he was unquestionably the dominant force in the game. He won nine titles including Queens and Wimbledon. Agassi assumed the mantle on April 28, 2003 for a mere two weeks before Hewitt climbed back to the top. His second stint though only lasted five weeks before Agassi claimed it back again.\n\n2 - grand slam singles titles\n\nHewitt was a classic case of maximising the most from his talent at a young age. He played his best tennis before the age of 22 and in that time picked up first the US Open title, and then nine months later, Wimbledon. He demolished Pete Sampras in straight sets at Flushing Meadow before dismantling David Nalbandian in similar fashion at SW19. And while he came close to adding to that list, he could never quite get over that line again.\n\n3 - semi-final appearances at the US Open\n\nThere was a period between 2000 and 2006 when Hewitt owned Flushing Meadow. Although he only won the title once, he did reach the final in 2004 (losing to Roger Federer) and the semi-finals in 2000, 2002 and again in 2005.\n\n4 - title wins at Queens\n\nFrom 1952 to 1970, Aussie players won this prestigious Wimbledon warm-up tournament 16 times. They won it again in 1978 (Tony Roach), 1997 (Mark Philippousis) and 1998 (Scott Draper) before Hewitt won it three times in a row from 2000 to 2002. He won it for a fourth time in 2006 by beating James Blake. His best performance since was a quarter-final showing in 2009.\n\n5 - combined career wins against Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal\n\nThat they all came before 2006 shows just how dominant Djokovic and Nadal have become on the ATP circuit. Hewitt won four of his first five encounters against the Spaniard, including at the Australian Open in 2004 and 2005, but has lost on the last six occasions. The only victory he has enjoyed against current world No.1 Djokovic was the first time they met – round three of the 2006 US Open. Hewitt has won only three sets in their last six matches.\n\n6 - games David Nalbandian won in the 2002 Wimbledon final\n\nAfter dropping just eight games to Pete Sampras at the US Open 10 months earlier, Hewitt went two better against the Argentine. In a tournament full of upsets, 28th seed Nalbandian, playing at his first Wimbledon, stunned everyone by reaching the final, but Hewitt, who lost only two sets all tournament, was ruthless, winning 6-1 6-3 6-2. It was such a dominant performance that many tipped it to be the first of many Wimbledon titles. Unfortunately, it was his first and last.\n\n7 - times he has been knocked out of Australian Open first round\n\nAside from an impressive run to the final 2005, Melbourne Park has never been a happy hunting ground. In fact, almost 40 per cent of his visit have ended in first-round exits. The biggest shock was undoubtedly his early departure in 2002 when he was the top seed and was beaten in four sets by unheralded Spaniard Alberto Martin. His best showing - aside from 2005 - has been six visits to the fourth round.\n\n8 - titles won on grass\n\nHis breakthrough at Wimbledon in 2002 was supposed to open the floodgates to more grass court riches. But while he was always a threat on the surface, the results never matched the hype. Still, a Wimbledon crown, four titles at Queens and successes at s-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands, Gerry Weber Open in Germany (where he beat Roger Federer) and the Hall of Fame Championship in Newport represent a pretty decent haul.\n\n9 – number of victories over Roger Federer (compared to 18 defeats)\n\nOne of the great modern-day rivalries actually had its origins as far as back as 1996. When both stepped up to the ATP Tour it was Hewitt who dominated the early exchanges, winning seven of their first nine meetings. Federer though has won 16 of their last 19 matches. Should they not meet at the Australian Open, however, Hewitt will have had the ‘last laugh’ having won their most recent encounter in the final of the 2014 Brisbane International.\n\n10 - number of coaches he has had\n\nThe man he beat for his first ATP title win also oversaw arguably Hewitt’s most successful period in the game. Aussie Jason Stoltenberg took over the coaching role in December 2001 from Darren Cahill and enjoyed a successful 18-month tenure before leaving in June 2003. Roger Rasheed had three-and-a-half years while Tony Roche had two goes and is still part of the Hewitt camp five years after his second appointment.\n\n11 - five-setters he has played at the US Open\n\nHe is not known as the five-set king for nothing. In 2001 he went the distance to see off Andy Roddick and James Blake. A year later Blake took him to five again while in 2005 he played in two more. But he really proved his ironman tag in 2013 when he played two five-set epics on top of two matches that went to four sets. He also played 13 five-set matches at the Australian Open.\n\n12 - age difference between Hewitt and Bernard Tomic\n\nIt was the classic inter-generational battle when the two met at the US Open at the start of 2015. Thirty-four-year-old Hewitt bowed out in five sets to a clearly humbled 22-year-old Tomic. “He is a huge legend to me. I always looked up to him. It was very emotional,” Tomic said. Ironically, the shoe was on the other foot 13 years earlier when 21-year-old Hewitt faced 32-year-old Pete Sampras in the 2002 US Open final.\n\n13 - wins over top 10 players in 2001\n\nAs if 2001 wasn’t amazing enough, Hewitt also pulled off a swag of victories against the best players in the world, culminating in a golden run at the end-of-year Masters Cup. He beat Frenchman Sebastian Grosjean three times and Swede Magnus Norman twice. He also powered past Pete Sampras at Queens and the US Open, Gustavo Kuerten, Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Andre Agassi and Pat Rafter.\n\n14 - Davis Cup singles matches he lost\n\nThe true embodiment of sporting patriotism, Hewitt has always been fully committed to the national cause. From his debut in 1999 to his final tie against Great Britain in November, Hewitt was always the first name called upon. His singles record of 40 wins, 14 losses is exemplary. As is his doubles mark of 14 wins, four defeats. No other tie displayed his value more than this year’s quarter-final against Kazakhstan. A late singles call up in the deciding rubber, he promptly took the match in straight sets.\n\n15 - age he qualified for his first Australian Open\n\nRanked 797th in the world and aged just 15 years and 11 months, Hewitt made it through the qualifying rounds and into the main draw of the first grand slam of 1997. He faced former top French Open winner Sergi Bruguera in the first round and acquitted himself well, although he went out in straight sets.\n\n16 - age he won his first ATP Tour title\n\nA late wildcard into the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide in 1998, Hewitt - ranked 550 in the world - took the tournament by storm, beating Scott Draper, Mark Woodforde, American Vince Spadea and Andre Agassi before facing Jason Stoltenberg in the final. Stoltenberg was ranked inside the top 50 at the time and was only four years earlier ranked at a career-high 19. And when he won the first set, it looked as though the form would hold. But Hewitt dug deep to take the next two sets, the decider in a tiebreaker, to become the lowest ranked title winner in ATP history.\n\n17 - years as a Davis Cup player for Australia\n\nHe has stuck solid through times of success (two titles), frustration (two times runners up) and failure (world group relegation for just the second time in history). Hewitt made his debut in the successful campaign of 1999, playing a big part in the wins over USA and Russia. His most memorable performances though came four years later in the semi-final against Switzerland and later the final against Spain. His five-set defeat of Roger Federer - after being two sets down - went into Davis Cup folklore.\n\n18 - matches lost in one of his best years on ATP tour in 2001\n\nHis first grand slam, five other tournament successes, 80 ATP Tour singles wins and 13 victories over fellow top 10 players. It was quite the 12 months. He began the year by beating Magnus Norman in the final at Sydney and just didn’t stop winning. The then 20-year won at Queens, the Ordina Open in the Netherlands, US Open, Japan Open and his domination was complete when he won the Tennis Masters Cup which was played in Sydney that year.\n\n19 - matches he played on the ATP Tour in 1998\n\nHewitt split time on his first year on the tour between sanctioned ATP events, qualifying tournaments and Challenger events. On the ATP Tour he enjoyed a 10-9 record that was certainly helped by his win in Adelaide to start the year and a good run at the Singapore tournament at the end of the year when he reached the quarter finals - losing to former world No.1 Marcelo Rios. He also reached the round of 16 in Sydney and took Daniel Vacek to five sets in his second attempt at the Australian Open.\n\n20 - consecutive Australian Open appearances\n\nIt may not his best grand slam in regards to performance but his loyalty and dedication to the national product has remained steadfast. That he could never replicate the dizzy heights of 2005, when he was beaten in the final by Marat Safin, has been a source of endless frustration. It’s unlikely his final Australian Open will realise that title-winning dream, but still, he is a big danger and plenty of the leading players will be wanting to avoid him in the draw, especially with such a parochial crowd behind him."
