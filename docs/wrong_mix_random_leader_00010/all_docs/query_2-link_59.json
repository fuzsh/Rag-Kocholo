        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt is a retired Australian professional tennis player who was born on February 24, 1981, in Adelaide, South Australia. Hewitt turned pro in 1998 and quickly established himself as one of the top players in the world, reaching his first Grand Slam final at the US Open in 2001, where he defeated Pete Sampras to win his first major title. He also won the Wimbledon singles title in 2002 and reached the final of the Australian Open in 2005.\n\nHewitt was known for his aggressive baseline style of play, his exceptional speed and footwork, and his fierce competitive spirit. He was a tenacious defender who never gave up on a point and was known for his ability to come back from seemingly impossible situations. Hewitt was also a skilled doubles player, winning multiple Grand Slam titles in doubles and mixed doubles throughout his career.\n\nOff the court, Hewitt was a popular and respected figure in the tennis world, known for his professionalism and sportsmanship. He was a fierce competitor on the court but always conducted himself with dignity and respect, earning the admiration of fans and fellow players alike.\n\nHewitt retired from professional tennis in 2016, having won 30 career singles titles, 3 Grand Slam titles, and 2 Olympic medals (a singles silver medal in 2004 and a doubles bronze medal in 2012). He remains involved in tennis as a coach and mentor to young players."
