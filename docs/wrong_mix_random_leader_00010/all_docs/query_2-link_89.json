        "text": "The 18-year-old is the eldest daughter of one of Australia’s most iconic power couples, tennis great Lleyton Hewitt and actor Bec Hewitt.\n\nThe teenager has two younger siblings, Ava, 13, who is already turning her hand to acting and Cruz, 15, who is focusing on a burgeoning tennis career.\n\nMeanwhile Mia is throwing herself into Bondi life with gusto and was spotted wearing the suburb’s official uniform of activewear, but with a Gen Z twist.\n\nInstead of the usual tight leggings, she opted for baggy track pants, a fashion statement that’s all the rage among her peers.\n\nThe flattering pictures prove that she’s inherited her mum’s flawless complexion and good looks.\n\nMia, part of the celebrity offspring contingent, was born famous as any millennial can remember the hysteria when Lleyton and Bec first hooked up.\n\nLleyton was at the peak of his tennis career and Bec was an Aussie golden girl after starring in Home and Away and winning Dancing with the Stars.\n\nThe couple started dating in 2005 and had a whirlwind romance. They got engaged after only six weeks of dating, married and announced they were expecting their first daughter, Mia, all in the same year.\n\nBec also quickly became famous for her WAG fashion, often being spotted at Lleyton’s games supporting him and rocking trucker hats and singlet tops.\n\nMia’s sighting comes after her parents moved back to Sydney after living in Melbourne for the best part of a decade.\n\nDuring the relocation, Bec and Lleyton reportedly spent $10 million on a resort-style mega mansion in the Hills District.\n\nThe new property reportedly boasts a host of luxury features, including an in-ground swimming pool, tennis court, guest cottage, and office.\n\nThese days, the couple are very low-key and private and likely busy raising their three children, but in 2022, when Hewitt was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the Grand Slam winner quickly praised his wife for all her support.\n\n“I’m so fortunate to have you, Bec. You are the most hands-on mum ever and the best wife and have always supported me with everything. I’m so proud of the three kids and how they’ve grown up, and so much of that is due to you,” he said."
