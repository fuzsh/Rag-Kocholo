        "text": "A superstar has bidden farewell to the tennis world, or at least shifted away from a vocation some observers treated over the years as a sacred calling.\n\nWe who follow him, reveling in his work, may wonder about his future plans.\n\nOn that topic he keeps his own counsel, leaving us to cherish our memories of him as a shooting star in the professional tennis firmament.\n\nTo be clear I am not paying tribute to Roger Federer, the most graceful player ever to take up a tennis racquet, trend-setter who raised the global profile of tennis and changed its aesthetic landscape forever, and trailblazer of the sport’s golden “Big 3 Era.”\n\nRather, I focus here on Twitter’s @PseudoFed, a/k/a/ “Not Roger Federer,” who may be the GOAT of social media parodies, and whose real-life identity remains obscure.\n\nPseudoFed has been kind enough to sit (remotely) for a Q&A session, a transcript of which is posted below.\n\nBut first things first – a journey through highlights of PseudoFed’s sparkling Twitter career.\n\nFrom the start, the Federer phenomenon warped the world of tennis much as a black hole distorts the fabric of space.\n\nOne of the wealthiest players ever, and a conscious fashion icon, Federer drew unmatched attention and prestige from the world’s elite.\n\nTennis writers, almost to a person, were so enamored of young Federer’s balletic form (having never seen anyone float across a tennis court) that they seemed never recover their objectivity.\n\nAt times, it appeared to some fans of the game that the sport’s establishment had aligned itself with Federer. Tournaments seemed to favor him with court assignments and scheduling, governing bodies adjusted rule enforcement in accordance with his concerns, and the men’s tour went so far as to retroactively classify previous years’ editions of an exhibition co-owned by Federer as official competitions.\n\nHype and hagiography from the tennis commentariat made Federer into a figure of legend – graceful, suave, polyglot, and rich, but also (we were told) humble and classy.\n\nHe became a tempting target for parody.\n\nIt was in the heady days near the peak of the Big 3 era, on 17 September 2010, that PseudoFed introduced himself to the world.\n\nHe quickly became a fount of trenchant commentary on and light-hearted criticism of various absurdities on the men’s tennis tour.\n\nHis most pointed, yet affectionate, mockery he reserved for Federer himself and for Federer’s rapturous admirers.\n\nSuggested by @DIRETHGI:\n\nSuggested by @weegonnaseeno:\n\nPseudoFed shared “details” with fans that Federer never got around to posting himself.\n\nFor example, we often heard from Federer’s self-anointed alter-ego that he delegates many quotidian tasks to “staff.”\n\nPseudoFed frequently opined to and about his ‘countryman’ Stanislas “Stanford” Wawrinka,\n\nhis first great rival, Rafael “Rafaello” Nadal,\n\nand in recent years the larger-than-life tennis “bad boy,” Nick Kyrgios.\n\nPseudoFed captured the heart of Tennis Twitter in part through his endearing practice of replying to fans –\n\n– as well as to tennis commentators.\n\nA favorite target of PseudoFed’s needling was the occasionally laughable pro-Federer bias displayed by tennis commentators and journalists.\n\nHe poked gentle fun at suspect treatment Federer enjoyed from tournaments and umpires.\n\nAnd offered countless colorful observations on the grind of the tennis tour and of tournament life.\n\nTo paraphrase a bromide, “All tennis, all day, might have made PseudoFed a dull boy. ”\n\nSo he dabbled in current events –\n\n– and even turned Winter Sports Commentator with a set of live tweets during the Sochi Olympics.\n\nThen the rest was silence – or at least a lengthy silence during Federer’s rest – for most of 2020 through 2022, as Federer struggled to recover from a series of knee surgeries.\n\nHappily, PseudoFed returned from hiatus to post a few choice observations in advance of Federer’s retirement do in London at the swanky exhibition-turned-competition known as the Laver Cup –\n\n– finishing with a farewell to his beloved alter-ego.\n\nBefore embarking on his next adventure, PseudoFed sat down for a (long-distance and words-only) interview about his whimsical career.\n\nPseudoFed, take us out —\n\nTo begin with, I would like to address a popular theory about PseudoFed’s identity, to wit, that PseudoFed is a woman in France.\n\nIs there any truth to this rumor?\n\nHello Cynthia fan, lovely to hear from Me. Staff and I have heard these rumifications. Although nowadays the boundaries between boys and girls appears to be making the blurry faces, I am definitely a boy. As for living in France, it is definitely a non, at least while they have clay.\n\nWhat, if anything, would you like PseudoFed’s fans to know about the place PseudoFed calls home?\n\nMy home has many rooms, and it is in each and every one of you.\n\nDoes PseudoFed have a favorite Federer match?\n\nMais oui, all the ones where I choose to win.\n\nA least-favorite?\n\nThe ones I chose to lose. 😦\n\nWhat have been your favorite and/or most memorable of PseudoFed’s interactions with fans?\n\nI like all staff and treat them equally. Certainly, the most touching are the people that have gone through difficult times in their life and said PseudoFed was the only thing that made them smile during those moments.\n\nWhich tennis player/personality do you interact the most with on twitter?\n\nMyself.\n\nWho are PseudoFed’s favorite commentators and writers?\n\nToo many to do the mentionings, in no particular order: Mr Bradlings, Jo Durie, Darren Cahills, Robbie Koenig, Carole Bouchard, Caro Paquin and many more.\n\nHave you watched Federer play in person?\n\nYes, though he’s PseudoFed in reality.\n\nHave you watched any matches at Wimbledon Centre Court? If so, which ones?\n\nToo many to mention.\n\nHave you ever sat in the Royal Box?\n\nNo, but have used their bathroom.\n\nHave you met any players in person?\n\nQuestion is incorrect, have any players asked to meet Me. Yes, on both accounts.\n\nDo you like dogs?\n\nSnoopy and Scooby-Doo. Anybody that doesn’t love animals should unfollow Me, now.\n\nHow has the tennis world changed over the course of your career (players, journos, equipment, governance, surfaces, PR, officiating, fans, coaches — however you would like to address it)?\n\nThis is a very good question. Things have gone downhill. Novak and Rafaello should have chosen different careers. Why couldn’t they have started an office cleaning empire and beat everybody at that?\n\nAside from this, not much has changed, the journos have only improved in their own heads. The surfraces could have all evolved to grass, this would have pleased Greta, and Me. I think coaches have improved significantly, nowadays they are far more comfortable and even offer wifi, air conditionisations and toilet restrooms.\n\nPseudoFed has maintained a blog over the years. Does He have any favorites among the articles he has published?\n\nI particularly enjoyed this one:\n\nhttps://pseudofedblog.com/2014/07/04/the-sound-of-tennis-by-simon-pseudofunkel/\n\nI understand PseudoFed has also published a book. What kind of feedback did he receive for the book? Is the book still available for purchase?\n\nThe Book was adored by fans and not adored by non-fans alike:\n\nUS link: https://www.amazon.com/PseudoFeds-Guide-Tennis-Life-PseudoFed/dp/1514289245/\n\nUK link: https://www.amazon.co.uk/PseudoFeds-Guide-Tennis-Life-PseudoFed-ebook/dp/B00Y8ZHLXW\n\nI am forever indebted to Mr. Grass for the cover x\n\nWill PseudoFed retire now that Federer has retired?\n\nI am looking at property in Florida for the relaxing faces.\n\nWhat tennis rule (or two, or three) do you believe should be changed?\n\n1. Tennis should be reduced to Aces only. If the opponent can return My serve, then I chose to lose the point, if not, I win the point. No running around making My little legs tired. Nobody wants to see that.\n\n2. Seeded players should never face unseeded players until the final. Mr Wimbledon has been trying to introduce this rule for Me for years.\n\n3. No players should be allowed to play if their names rhyme with Cabal or Prozac.\n\nWhat precious nuggets of advice would PseudoFed offer today to:\n\nNadal\n\nPlease retire.\n\nDjokovic\n\nPlease retire.\n\nMurray\n\nHello Andrew fan.\n\nWawrinka\n\nStanford, please bring Me more chocolates.\n\nDel Potro\n\nJuan, te amamos y te extrañamos.\n\nCilic\n\nStaff love your cleaning products.\n\nTsitsipas\n\nHello little one.\n\nZverev – Medvedev\n\nWhy are your names similar? Have you ever been in the same room at the same time?\n\nBerrettini\n\nForza azzurri.\n\nRublev\n\nDo you know Zverev and Medvedev?\n\nKyrgios\n\nFocus on your tennis young man.\n\nBarbara Schett\n\nHello Barbara fan. Please lose that strange cube thing.\n\nMats Wilander\n\nThanks for your continued support.\n\nBrad Gilbert\n\nLove to Mrs Bradlings. x\n\nDarren Cahill\n\nAs always, rather large props to you, Darren fan. x\n\nOthers in the tennis world?\n\nI hope you get to see Me soon.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nSir Billy – Chief Chariot Pusher and Senior Staff Member\n\nSmall fan\n\nLeanne Lister fan\n\nWallace fan\n\nSuper One fan\n\nLana fan\n\nJulie Britannia fan\n\nGreek fan\n\nBindi fan\n\nAlejandro fan\n\nLucia fan\n\nLaura fan\n\nMelissa fan\n\nWoofy fan\n\nLittle doggy fan Rose\n\nKay fan\n\nAjda fan\n\nJane fan\n\nFarming fan\n\nDivir fan\n\nHillyard fan\n\nJimmy Scott fan\n\nMaria fan\n\nKC Johnson and Sunshine Band fan\n\nJuana fan\n\nTim Malone fan\n\nJimmy Scott fan\n\nRajeev Kumar fan\n\nConty fan\n\nRea fan\n\nTaylor Quick fan\n\nDeep Fried Lard fan\n\nLeo fan\n\nApoorva fan\n\nFrancesca fan\n\nLucy fan\n\nGuy Vernon fan\n\nNick A fan\n\nTheDogHouse fan\n\nIf I forgot to mention you, I am sorry x\n\n(Photo by @puepppy.)\n\nWhat follows is a revised and updated edition of Red Dirt Ballet…, originally published in 2016. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nIn April, professional tennis players change their shoes.\n\nGone are the standard smooth “tennies” designed for comfort on hard courts. In their place are textured soles optimized for traction on loose red powder.\n\nA whirlwind of travel that carries players through the summer heat of Australia and South America, and sets them down in March on the hard courts of North America, delivers them in April to the “red dirt.” There they contest a series of clay court tournaments that culminates in the French Open.\n\nOver the course of seven weeks, in nine countries, on three continents, players are tested in what many fans consider the purest form of tennis – where the surface imparts no advantage to raw power, where players must be proficient at every aspect of the game (serve, return, groundstrokes, volleys, and defense), and where players face the greatest physical and mental demands of the year.\n\nWhat is the “clay”?\n\nThe “clay” in a modern clay court is typically crushed brick layered upon a gravel base to improve drainage. The court’s top layer is a fine red powder.\n\nMuch as an ice rink is smoothed periodically by a Zamboni, a clay court is swept to rid the surface of footprints, skid marks, gouges, and ball marks. Usually, a clay court is swept after every set and sprayed with water as needed to prevent the top surface dust from blowing.\n\nWhat makes clay court tennis special?\n\nThe key characteristics of a clay court, from a player’s perspective:\n\nIt is slippery.\n\nMovement on a clay court is night-and-day different from movement on the hard courts on which professionals spend most of the year. Stopping, starting, and changing direction are all made more difficult by the court’s dusty top layer. Balance becomes especially critical.\n\nThe slipperiness influences tactics (for example, it’s especially profitable on clay to aim a shot behind a moving opponent) and profoundly affects a player’s timing. The most adept claycourters learn to slide into their shots.\n\nThe ball’s bounce is relatively high.\n\nClay rewards players who use heavy topspin (i.e., forward spin), because it gives topspin shots a high bounce. (By contrast, on grass courts and many indoor hard courts, top-spinning balls tend to say low.)\n\nThe high bounce can throw off an opponent’s timing and/or place the ball above an his optimal “strike zone,” in either case making it difficult for an opponent to return a topspin ball with power and accuracy.\n\nWhen the ball strikes a clay court surface, it always leaves a mark.\n\nAt clay tournaments, players cannot ask for computerized “Hawkeye” challenges, because every shot leaves a mark. Instead, players can summon umpires out of their chairs to check ball marks.\n\nIn rare cases, a player might compel a cameraman to photograph a mark.\n\nPlay continues on a clay court in light rain.\n\nClay is the only outdoor tennis surface for which light rain does not suspend matches. (Heavy rain, such as that which interfered with the 2012 French Open men’s final, makes play impossible.)\n\nIn rainy conditions, a clay court becomes soggy. Bounces slow down. Balls become waterlogged and heavy, coated with mud. The dry-slippery court surface becomes sloppy, forcing players to modify their footwork.\n\nClay court tennis requires players to adapt to a wider range of conditions than they would ever encounter during matches on either grass or hard courts.\n\nThe surface is “slow.”\n\nWhen the ball strikes a clay court surface, the friction between the ball and the clay grips the ball for an instant, providing the opponent an extra fraction of a second to reach the ball. (By contrast, grass courts and many hard courts are “fast.”)\n\n(from news.bbc.co.uk)\n\nConsequently, it is much more difficult on clay than on a hard or grass court for a player to hit an unreturnable shot. Matches are both physically and mentally arduous on clay.\n\nClay rewards players with good defensive skills (i.e., the ability to chase down opponents’ shots and keep a ball in play). Some of the tour’s most proficient claycourters, including Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, and Diego Schwartzman, excel at forcing their opponents to hit “one more shot” and eventually miss.\n\nDefense alone, though, is not sufficient to guarantee wins. Those who succeed on clay know when and how to hit an aggressive shot that either takes control of a rally or wins a point outright.\n\nClay rewards decision-making, shot-selection, problem-solving, patience, and the vanishing art of point construction – the chess match wherein each player tries to think several shots ahead and outmaneuver his opponent to make space on the court for a winning shot.\n\nExecuted well, clay court tennis offers both breathtaking athleticism and fascinating drama.\n\nThe Spring Clay Court Season\n\nThe marquee event of the clay court season is the French Open, second of the year’s four Major tournaments, held at Roland Garros in Paris. To ensure that players reach Roland Garros in optimal clay court form, the tennis tour devotes seven weeks to warm-up tournaments in the U.S., North Africa, and Europe.\n\nWeek 1: Houston and Marrakech\n\nThe men’s clay tennis season opened in the week of April 8 with 250-level (i.e., fourth tier, if the Majors are first-tier) tournaments in Houston and Marrakech. Since most of the top players sit this week out to train for more prestigious events to come, young rising stars and experienced middle-ranked journeymen dominate the draws.\n\nTournament: Grand Prix Hassan II (Marrakech)\n\nCategory: 250\n\nSingles field: 32\n\nTop seed: Alexander Zverev (current ranking: #3)\n\nDefending champion: Pablo Andujar\n\nTrivia: Contested in Casablanca until 2016, this tournament is the only ATP event held in Africa.\n\nTournament: Fayez Sarofim & Co. U.S. Clay Court Championship (Houston)\n\nCategory: 250\n\nSingles field: 28\n\nTop seed: Steve Johnson (#39)\n\nDefending champion: Steve Johnson\n\nTrivia: This is the only ATP clay court event held in the U.S.\n\nSome members of the hosting tennis club open their homes for the week to players.\n\nWeek 2: Monte Carlo\n\nLeading off the European series is the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters tournament. First played in 1897, this Masters 1000 event (one tier below the Majors) offers fans and players alike the most beautiful venue of the year.\n\nRafael Nadal won eight consecutive titles in Monte Carlo, from 2005 through 2012, a feat that might never be equaled. Currently, Nadal owns a record 11 Monte Carlo titles.\n\nTournament category: Masters 1000\n\nSingles players: 56\n\nTop seed: Novak Djokovic (#1)\n\nDefending champion: Rafael Nadal\n\nTrivia: A club restaurant overlooks the spectacular center court. Players must tune out a din of conversation and the clinks of porcelain and glassware during their matches.\n\nWeek 3: Barcelona and Budapest\n\nDuring the week of April 22, some players who did not qualify for Monte Carlo will begin their French Open preparations at a smaller event Budapest.\n\nTournament: Hungarian Open\n\nCategory: 250\n\nSingles field: 28\n\nTop seed: Borna Coric (#13)\n\nDefending champion: Marco Cecchinato\n\nTrivia: Five weeks after winning his first-ever career title in Budapest last year, Marco Cecchinato upset Novak Djokovic at the French Open.\n\nMost higher-ranked players will either sit this week out or contest a 500 (i.e., third-tier) event held at the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona – 1899, one of the oldest tennis clubs in Spain.\n\nBarcelona’s crowds are the most polite of the tennis season.\n\nBecause Barcelona’s Open Banc Sabadell serves as the Spanish national championship, nearly every healthy Spanish player is in the field. Thirty-seven-year-old David Ferrer has said that a Barcelona title would mean as much to him as winning a Major.\n\nTournament: Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell\n\nCategory: 500\n\nSingles players: 48\n\nTop seed: Rafael Nadal\n\nDefending champion: Rafael Nadal\n\nTrivia: After hoisting one of the the heaviest trophies of the season, the tournament’s singles champion traditionally jumps into the club’s swimming pool.\n\n(The trophy is no longer quite as formidable as in this 2013 photo, but it is still hefty.)\n\nWeek 4: Munich and Estoril\n\nWeek 4 serves as a break for most the top players and therefore offers opportunities for lower-ranked players to shine at 250s in Munich and Estoril.\n\nTournament: BMW Open by FWU (Munich)\n\nCategory: 250\n\nSingles field: 28\n\nTop seed: Alexander Zverev (#3)\n\nDefending champion: Alexander Zverev\n\nTrivia: By tradition, the singles champion dons Lederhosen before the trophy ceremony.\n\nTournament: Millennium Estoril Open\n\nCategory: 250\n\nTop seed: Kevin Anderson\n\nDefending champion: João Sousa\n\nTrivia: Last year, João Sousa became the first Portuguese to win either this event or its pre-2015 predecessor, the Portugal Open.\n\nWeek 5: Madrid\n\nSince the early 2000s, the lead-up to the French Open has included three Masters 1000 tournaments. Two of those three are the events in Monte Carlo and Rome. Until 2008, the third Masters 1000 on clay was held in Hamburg. Because of Hamburg’s inclement weather (and, most likely, some behind-the-scenes politics), the third clay Masters 1000 was moved to Madrid in 2009.\n\nThe Madrid tournament poses a unique challenge during the pre-Roland Garros swing: high altitude. The ball travels faster through the air in Madrid than at the sea-level events, and Madrid’s relatively dry air makes the court both faster and more slippery.\n\nAs a joint men’s and women’s event with limited court space, the Madrid tournament is known for its long competition days. Nearly every year there are matches that begin after 11 p.m.\n\nHighlighting the 2019 Madrid tournament are a return and a farewell featuring two 37-year-olds: Roger Federer will use the event to return to clay for the first time since 2016, while Spanish veteran David Ferrer will close his career in Madrid in front of the partisan home crowd.\n\nTournament: Mutua Madrid Open\n\nCategory: Masters 1000\n\nSingles field: 56\n\nTop seed: Novak Djokovic (#1)\n\nDefending champion: Alexander Zverev\n\nTrivia: In 2012, the tournament used blue clay instead of traditional red clay. Although the contrast between yellow balls and the blue background was wonderful for television, the bleached-then-dyed clay particles created a treacherously slippery surface. Several players, including Djokovic and Nadal, announced that they would refuse to play the event again on blue clay.\n\nWeek 6: Rome\n\nThe week after Madrid takes the players back to sea level for the season’s third and final Masters 1000 event on clay.\n\nTournament: Internazionali BNL d’Italia\n\nCategory: 1000\n\nSingles field: 56\n\nTop seed: Novak Djokovic (#1)\n\nDefending champion: Rafael Nadal\n\nTrivia: The tournament grounds feature a steeply raked stadium surrounded by classically-styled statues and located atop the site of the swimming venue for the 1960 Summer Olympics.\n\nWeek 7: Lyon and Geneva\n\nThe week before the French Open will find most of the top-ranked players in Paris practicing at Roland Garros, speaking to the media, and appearing at sponsor events. Meanwhile, 250-level events in Nice and Geneva offer final tune-up opportunities for middle-ranked players as well as a few hometown stars.\n\nTournament: Open Parc Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes (Lyon)\n\nCategory: 250\n\nSingles field: 28\n\nTop seed: John Isner (#9)\n\n2018 champion: Dominic Thiem\n\nTrivia: France, with five events including the Lyon tournament, hosts more ATP tournaments than any other nation in Europe.\n\nTournament: Banque Eric Sturdza Geneva Open\n\nCategory: 250\n\nSingles field: 28\n\nTop seed: Fabio Fognini (#18)\n\nDefending champion: Marton Fucsovics\n\nTrivia: Novak Djokovic’s coach, Marian Vajda, won the event in 1988.\n\nWeeks 8 and 9: The French Open, Roland Garros, Paris\n\nOn 26 May, 128 men will begin the quest for the year’s second Major singles title at the French Open at Roland Garros. Fifteen days later, one man will hoist aloft the tournament’s storied trophy, the Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nBecause Roland Garros is the only Major site with no lighting for night matches, and since clay matches tend to be long, the French Open is the only Major whose first contests are held on a Sunday.\n\nEvery Major tournament offers compelling drama from the start. It is fascinating to watch players ranked 70 or 80 in the world, with no hope of winning the title, battle tooth-and-nail for the right to advance to the next round. Every day of the first week promises valor, heart, and sportsmanship.\n\nOne of my favorite tales of Roland Garros valor took place in 2013 and starred then-31-year-old Spaniard Tommy Robredo. Known as a tenacious fighter, and expert like many of his countrymen in the art of tennis on clay, Robredo outdid himself by coming back from two-sets-to-none deficits to win five-set matches in three consecutive rounds, a feat unmatched in the previous 86 years. After his third comeback, Robredo collapsed the court in tears as the stadium crowd chanted his name.\n\nMore drama, of the “never-a-dull-moment” variety, erupted later in the same event, when flare-wielding political protestors crashed the men’s final between Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, spooking both contestants.\n\nIn addition to the French crowd’s perennial hope for a homegrown champion, the intrigue at Roland Garros 2019 features a cast of both veteran contenders and talented rising starsm, many of whom have fascinating storylines.\n\nTournament: French Open\n\nCategory: Major\n\nSingles field: 128\n\nTop seed: Novak Djokovic (#1)\n\nDefending champion: Rafael Nadal\n\nTrivia: The “footprint” of space around Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium court, is the largest of any tournament court in the world. The consequent extra running room is a great boon for players during baseline rallies.\n\nThe Contenders\n\nIt is highly probable that the man left holding the Coupe des Mousquetaires on June 9 will be one of a short list of favorites.\n\nThe King of Clay – Rafael Nadal\n\nThirty-two-year-old Spaniard Rafael Nadal is the greatest clay court player in the history of men’s tennis. Regardless of how the 2019 season unfolds, he is the undisputed King of Clay.\n\nNadal leads all men in the Open Era with a staggering 90 percent of matches won on clay.\n\nIn Best-of-5-Set matches on clay, his win-loss record is 106 – 2. 106, and 2.\n\nHe won a record 81 consecutive matches on clay from 2006 to 2008.\n\nHe won in excess of 50 consecutive semifinal matches on clay from 2008 to 2015.\n\nIn 2017 – 18, at the age of 31, he set a record for consecutive sets won on any single surface with 50 straight sets won on clay.\n\nThe only male player to have won 10 or more titles at any event, Nadal owns 11 trophies at each of *three* clay tournaments of different tiers: Barcelona (500), Monte Carlo (1000), and Roland Garros (Major).\n\nCollage by @JeuSetMaths\n\nSeveral attributes of Nadal’s unique playing style are especially well suited to the red dirt.\n\nThe unmatched topspin he applies to his shots, especially to his forehand with the distinctive “lariat” follow-through.\n\nExcellent footwork, both relentless and precise.\n\nA deep understanding of tennis tactics and point construction.\n\nFormidable problem-solving skills.\n\nGreat competitive intensity that wears down many opponents as Nadal plays every point as though it were his last.\n\nIn addition to his three “Undecimas,” Nadal has won four Madrid titles on clay (and one when the tournament was played on an indoor hard court) and eight Romes.\n\nNadal is no slouch on surfaces other than clay. He owns four titles, including two Wimbledons, on grass (which, fast and low-bouncing, is essentially the opposite of clay). On hardcourts, he has won nineteen titles, include three US Opens and one Australian Open.\n\nNadal’s career has been plagued by injuries. Custom arch supports he adopted in 2006 to protect a congenitally deformed bone in his left foot have wreaked havoc on both of his knees. He suffers from chronic patellar tendonitis and often plays in pain.\n\nOver his 16 years in the ATP Top 100, Nadal has missed more than 24 months of competition and nine Major tournaments due to injuries. Notwithstanding, he has remained in the ATP Top 10 every week since he joined in the Top 10 in the spring of 2005.\n\nToday, in the words of Nadal’s characteristically blunt uncle and first coach, Toni Nadal, “Rafael is not a tennis player but an injured person who plays tennis.”\n\nAt hard court events, which comprise two-thirds of the ATP tour, Nadal seems almost a tragic figure – equipped at age 32 with some of the tactically smartest tennis of his career, eager and determined to play, but much of the time thwarted by his body. Of the 21 hard court events he has been scheduled to contest since September of 2017, Nadal completed five tournaments (winning two and finishing two as runner-up), retired injured from five, and withdrew in advance due to injury from eleven. Sudden stops and violent accelerations on concrete are brutal for chronically injured knees.\n\nClay, with its forgiving, powdered softness, is blessedly different.\n\nNadal opened 2019 by reaching the Australian Open final without dropping a set only eleven weeks after pre-season ankle surgery. In March, he played well through four rounds on the Indian Wells hard courts before being forced to withdraw injured (again) before his semifinal match. He skipped the Miami hardcourts to recover and commence training on clay.\n\nWhat can one expect from Nadal on the clay his year?\n\nAs is his wont, he will respect every opponent he faces.\n\nWe can count on him to play every point as though his life depended upon it.\n\nAlong the way, he may well win some titles.\n\nThe “Prince of Clay” – Dominic Thiem\n\nTwenty-five-year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem has a powerful, aggressive game ideally suited to clay. Thiem imparts speed and blinding spin to both his his forehand and his gorgeous one-handed backhand, enabling him to push his opponents back even when he himself is well behind the baseline.\n\nMany fans view Thiem, the 2018 French Open runner-up, as Nadal’s heir apparent on clay, because Thiem has won eight of his 12 career titles on the red dirt, and because Thiem is the only player to have beaten Nadal on clay in the last two years (in Rome in 2017, and in Madrid in 2018).\n\nAfter struggling to adapt his big strokes to faster surfaces, Thiem has finally realized his potential on hard courts in the last six months. His match against Nadal on at the 2018 U.S. Open – in which Thiem blew through the first set 6-0 and finally succumbed by only a whisker in a fifth-set tiebreak – was voted by fans the best match of the year.\n\nIn March, Thiem confirmed his ability to fight toe-to-toe with the best on a hard court by coming back from a one-set deficit to beat Roger Federer in the Indian Wells final.\n\nAs long as Thiem stays healthy, the question of his hoisting the Roland Garros trophy is one of “when” rather than “if.” He is a title threat at every clay court tournament he enters.\n\nThe Reigning World #1- Novak Djokovic\n\nWhen in late January 31-year-old Serb and World #1 Novak Djokovic won the 2019 Australian Open final in straight sets over Rafael Nadal, speculation among tennis’ talkers coalesced around a new narrative: would Djokovic be able to win his second French Open in 2019, enabling him to capture four consecutive Major titles for the second time in his career? Fashionable wisdom screamed, “Yes!” Typically hyperbolic commentary from the likes of Tennis Channel’s Mary Carillo declared there was no reason to think Djokovic wouldn’t win every tournament he entered for the rest of the season.\n\nThen, in early March, Djokovic returned to competition, on his favorite surface, and proceeded to lose early – to #39-ranked Philipp Kohlschreiber in the Round of 32 in Indian Wells, and to #25 Roberto Bautista Agut in the Round of 16 in Miami. By all accounts, Djokovic was healthy and thus could not account for his unexpectedly weak performances with physical disability.\n\nBecause of his poor results in Indian Wells and Miami, Djokovic is not the current betting favorite for the French Open. He has titles from Monte Carlo, Madrid, and Rome as well as from Roland Garros, so he is capable of performing well enough to win. To do so, he would need more consistent focus and intensity that he exhibited on the hard courts in March.\n\nAlexander Zverev\n\nTwenty-one-year-old German Alexander Zverev plays with a well rounded game blessed with power he can summon from his 6’6″ frame. He has a big serve, decent returns, and strong groundstrokes from both wings. The only weakness in his game becomes clear when he plays at the net. (If/when he becomes a proficient volleyer, watch out!)\n\nZverev has already won three Masters 1000 titles, including clay titles in Rome and Madrid. Last year, he upset Djokovic on an indoor hard court to claim the year-end Tour Finals trophy. With multiple wins over both Djokovic and Federer (but none yet over Nadal on any surface), Zverev has been hailed by the press as a future star.\n\nThat said, Zverev has yet to perform well at a Major. He has reached only one Major quarterfinal, at the 2018 French Open.\n\nWhether Zverev’s collapses at Majors have stemmed from nerves, from fitness problems, or from bad luck, it seems inevitable in light of his prodigious skills and talent that he will break through at a Major sooner or later. The 2019 French Open could be his time.\n\nThe 2015 Roland Garros Champion – Stan Wawrinka\n\nSwitzerland’s Stan Wawrinka, a thirty-four-year old veteran, is always a threat when healthy. Fueled by power in his serve, his forehand, and his lethal one-handed backhanded, Wawrinka’s game has carried him to two French Open finals and Major titles from Australia, Roland Garros, and the U.S. Open.\n\nWawrinka is on a comeback trail after two knee surgeries that sidelined him for half of 2017 and most of 2018. He might not yet be back to his best, but after six weeks of competition in April and May he could be ready for Roland Garros.\n\nThe Wildcards\n\nIt is unlikely that any of these players will be able to win the French Open, but each of them is skillful enough on clay to spice up the draw with upsets.\n\nRoger Federer\n\nOf the “Wildcards,” Roger Federer is the only player who might actually have the game to win the French Open (his second, after hoisting his first trophy in 2009).\n\nFederer is vulnerable on clay for several reasons: because he completely skipped the clay in 2017 and 2018 and thus hasn’t played a clay match in nearly three years; because his one handed backhand is susceptible to attack from an opponent who adds heavy topspin to his groundstrokes; and because, though his shot variety is a rich as ever, at 37 he doesn’t move as well as he did when he was in his prime.\n\nI would not pick Federer to beat a healthy Nadal, a healthy Djokovic, or a healthy Thiem, or any combination thereof, on clay. However, if Federer were to catch some “lucky” breaks – if Nadal, Djokovic, and/or Thiem were disabled, and if other dangerous opponents lost early – Federer could conceivably hoist the Coupe.\n\nKei Nishikori\n\nWith a playing style similar to Djokovic’s, Japan’s Kei Nishikori established himself solidly among the game’s Top 10 before suffering a series of injuries in the last two years. When he is healthy, Nishikori’s easy power and precise ball striking can carry him past any player. He has notched wins over Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic.\n\nTwo of Nishikori’s twelve titles have come on clay, both in Barcelona.\n\nLike Wawrinka, Nishikori is on a comeback trail from injury. He is unlikely to have the physical resilience necessary to win one of the big clay titles this year, but if he stays healthy he could cause some early-round upsets.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas\n\nTwenty-year-old Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas made a big splash in Barcelona last year, when he beat several strong clay-courters (including Dominic Thiem) en route to the final, where he lost to Nadal. Three months later, he made an even bigger noise at the hardcourt Masters 1000 event in Toronto, defeating four Top-10 players, including Djokovic and Zverev, en route to the final (where again he lost to Nadal).\n\nIn Australia this year, he riveted the attention of the tennis world by defeating Roger Federer in the Round of 16.\n\nTsitsipas has a well-rounded, aesthetically pleasing game and a cockiness that serves him well on big stages. He may not yet have the physical stamina necessary to win seven best-of-five-set matches over two weeks in Roland Garros, but no one will be eager to see him across the net.\n\nRoberto Bautista Agut\n\nThirty-year-old Roberto Bautista Agut is the rare Spanish player whose best surface is hard court rather than clay. Consistent, hard-working, and highly competitive, “RBA” (as he’s called in the tennis press) has steadily improved his game to a point where he can compete with the best. Two of his three career wins over #1 Djokovic have come in 2019 (in Doha in January, and in Miami in March).\n\nBautista Agut’s clean, well-rounded game is probably not strong enough to carry him to the trophy stand at any of the spring’s clay events, but he could serve as a spoiler.\n\nNick Kyrgios\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Nick Kyrgios has three wins over Nadal (none on clay), two over Djokovic (both on hard court), and one over Federer (on clay in Madrid). The brutal efficacy of his unreadable serve is somewhat diminished on clay, but he can still be dangerous to anyone in the field if he plays well.\n\nDiego Schwartzman\n\nBoth of Diego Schwartzman’s titles, including a 500 trophy in Rio in 2018, have come on clay. The twenty-six-year-old Argentine is one of the fastest movers and most skillful defenders on the ATP tour, and he can deliver remarkable power from his 5’7″ frame.\n\nSchwartzman was one of only four players to take even a set from Nadal on clay last year (along with Thiem, Zverev, and Fabio Fognini). No one will want to have to face him this April and May.\n\nGaël Monfils\n\nFrance’s best hope for a homegrown Roland Garros title is also an almost universally loved player on the ATP tour, the highly entertaining 32-year-old Gaël Monfils. Blessed with prodigious talent and staggering physical abilities, Monfils has reached the final at Monte Carlo and the quarterfinals at Roland Garros.\n\nIt is unlikely that he can win any of this year’s big titles, but he could produce impressive runs to please both his coaches and the crowds.\n\nKaren Khachanov\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Karen Khachanov of Russia can be a joy to watch on a tennis court if one is not rooting for his opponent. Khachanov’s blistering power and big serve have garnered him some impressive results. Two of Nadal’s closest and hardest fought matches over the last eighteen months have come against Khachanov (at the 2018 U.S. Open and last month in Indian Wells). Against Djokovic, Khachanov scored an upset on an indoor hardcourt to win the Paris Masters title last November.\n\nIn part because he has struggled with health issues, Khachanov opened 2019 with relatively weak results. If he is healthy for the clay season, he could pose a stiff challenge to any opponent.\n\nNikoloz Basilashvili\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili currently sits at a career-high ranking of 17, after a year in which he won his first two titles. Both titles came at 500-level tournaments. One was on clay (in Hamburg last July).\n\nPlaying with a bazooka-hitting style similar to Khachanov’s, Basilashvili is capable of playing wonderful matches en route to a Round of 16 finish or perhaps even a quarterfinal. If he gets a top player on a down day, he could pull an upset.\n\nThe Youngsters: Borna Coric, Alex de Minaur, Frances Tiafoe, Denis Shapovalov, Félix Auger-Aliassime\n\nGallons of ink have been spilt about these five rising stars. Instead of detailing and extolling the achievements and virtues of each, I will note that they have all earned special mention. Individually and as a group, they are better than any generation in men’s tennis since Nadal/Murray/Djokovic. None of them is likely to hoist a big trophy between now and early June, but within three years it is they who will contest Major finals.\n\nWho will win?\n\nI don’t make predictions. 🙂\n\nQuote for Today\n\n“If” doesn’t exist in sport. That’s the real thing. If, if, if – never comes. The thing is, you have to do it. – Rafael Nadal\n\nDavid Ferrer never stops moving.\n\nHe paces. He bounces. He hurls himself at an opponent’s serve. He sprints. He swats a shot with all the power he can muster. He pivots and hits again. And again. And again. When at last a point ends — more often than not over the years in his favor — he slows down. And returns to pacing, back and forth, back and forth.\n\nNicknamed the Energizer Bunny, the Little Beast, the Wall, and “Ferru,” 36-year-old Ferrer is renowned on the men’s professional tennis tour for his tenacity, his stamina, his competitive intensity, and his work ethic.\n\nOver the course of his 18-year professional career, Ferrer has earned 27 tour-level singles titles, including a prestigious Masters 1000 level trophy (in 2012, indoors, at Paris – Bercy). He reached the quarterfinals or better at all four Majors, reached the semifinals at three (not Wimbledon), and reached the final of the 2013 French Open (losing to countryman and “King of Clay” Rafael Nadal). From the beginning of 2012 through mid-2014, he reached the quarterfinals or better at ten consecutive Majors.\n\nFerrer is the most decorated man playing entirely in the Open Era (1968 – present) never to have won a Major title.\n\nHe spent 15 years in the ATP Top 100 and over five-and-a-half years in the Top 10. He qualified five times among the Top 8 for the year-end World Tour Finals. In 2013, he finished the year ranked #3 behind Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic (and ahead of Roger Federer).\n\nAll of this he has achieved in the “Big Four Era,” the most competitive period in the history of men’s tennis.\n\nAgainst the Big Four, Ferrer has notched 17 wins: he is 5-16 against Novak Djokovic, 6-14 against Andy Murray, and 6-24 against Rafael Nadal. The only member of the Big Four against whom he is winless (in 17 tries) is Roger Federer.\n\nSince he has never managed to beat Federer, some tennis writers are at times tempted to downgrade Ferrer in favor of other Big Four Era also-rans, such as big hitters Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Tomas Berdych, both of whom have wins over Federer at Majors.\n\nIn terms of overall career stats, Ferrer ranks well above both Tsonga (16 singles titles, two Masters 1000 titles, one Major final) and Berdych (13 singles titles, one Masters 1000 title, one Major final).\n\nWhy might Ferrer, for all of his success, have been unable even once to solve the puzzle of Roger Federer, while the less accomplished Tsonga and Berdych have managed six wins over Federer apiece?\n\nThe answers are simple: height, and the advantage height confers in shot power and court coverage.\n\nFederer is 6’1″. Tsonga is 6’2″. Berdych is 6’5″.\n\nFerrer is only 5’9″.\n\nIn spite of Ferrer’s tremendous skills and dogged determination, Federer was an unfortunate match-up for Ferrer.\n\n(With 6’8″ Jerzy Janowicz after the 2012 Paris-Bercy final.)\n\nHow Ferrer has been able to create such a wildly successful tennis style with his limited stature is a classic story of optimization. Lacking in power, Ferrer specialized in pinpoint accuracy. Ferrer could place his forehand anywhere in the court on a dime. He compensated for his relatively soft service delivery by befuddling his opponents with serve placement.\n\nLacking the wingspan to prevail consistently at the net, Ferrer instead wore his opponents down with a tactically sound baseline game. Groundstroke after groundstroke flew from Ferrer’s racquet to locations over the net that made his opponents uncomfortable. Compensating for his lack of reach with lightning footspeed, Ferrer ran down every ball, sent shots back to awkward locations, and — at times through lengthy and arduous battles — wore his opponents down.\n\nFerrer also excelled at reading and returning his opponents’ serves – a talent that bought him great advantages against the 6’5″ and taller “servebot” players he encountered with increasing frequency late in his career.\n\nOne of the best matches I ever saw him play was a win over 6’10” American John Isner on the fast, dry clay in Madrid. Again and again, Ferrer launched himself at Isner’s fast, high-bouncing serves, often making contact with the ball while airborne himself, and nearly always getting the ball back into play.\n\n(With John Isner in Madrid.)\n\nAnother of Ferrer’s trademark skills is his uncanny ability to break an opponent’s serve when his opponent is serving for a set. (Among some of his fans, earning a crucial set-saving service break is known as “pulling a Ferrer.”)\n\n(Meme created by @bellezavitale)\n\nFerrer’s most ardent fans might disagree on this point, but for me the match that best exemplified Ferrer’s dogged fight and determination was the 2013 Australian Open quarterfinal against hard-serving countryman Nicolas Almagro. After winning the first two sets 6-4 6-4, Almagro served for the match three times. Each time, Ferrer managed to break. Ferrer eked out the third set 7-5 and the fourth set in a tiebreak before he crushed Almagro’s spirit and cruised to a 6-2 win in the fifth.\n\nEven after a signature win such as that one, he never bragged. Reserved, soft-spoken, and thoughtful, Ferrer, who early in his career described himself as “the worst player in the Top 100,” remains to this day humble and unassuming (in spite of a very respectable $30 million career prize money total). He lives in Valencia in his home country of Spain rather than in a tax haven. He is close to his family and loyal to his friends.\n\nFerrer played for Spain at three Olympics — 2008, 2012, and 2016 — coming closest to a medal (heartbreakingly close) in the 2012 doubles competition, when he and partner Feliciano Lopez finished fourth.\n\n(With Feliciano Lopez.)\n\nHe loves playing for his country. He has said that early in his career he would have handed out water bottles just to have a chance to participate in Davis Cup. By his own reckoning (as reported in several interviews), his best and most important performances have come in that team competition.\n\nIn 2008, he helped Spain to its third Davis Cup trophy (a/k/a “salad bowl”) in nine years.\n\nIn 2009, he came back from two sets down to defeat the tricky and unpredictable Radek Stepanek in the final as Spain won its fourth trophy in ten years.\n\nIn 2011, he played what he himself calls the best match of his career in a five-set win over 6’5″ Argentine rocket-launcher Juan Martin del Potro. The match was a dogfight. Ferrer was so often behind on his serve that one of the U.S. commentators quipped, “to save time, Ferrer should begin every service game 0-15.” In the end, Ferrer’s defense and stamina prevailed over del Potro’s power, helping Spain to another Davis Cup trophy.\n\nIn 2012, with Rafael Nadal sidelined with knee injuries and Ferrer playing some of the best tennis of his career, Ferrer led Spain’s Davis Cup team to the final against the Czech Republic, where he did all he could for the team by winning both of his singles matches, in front of a hostile crowd, over Berdych and Stepanek.\n\nPerhaps it is fitting in light of Ferrer’s many years as a Davis Cup star that his last great performance delivered a crucial point for Spain in this years Davis Cup quarterfinals.\n\nFerrer arrived at the tie, held on a clay court in the bullring in his hometown of Valencia, riding a years-long decline in form. After a decade without what he termed “important injuries,” Ferrer started suffering pain in his Achilles tendons in 2015. Recovery time away from the tour cost him shot precision and endurance. The consistency that had been the hallmark of his game left him, sapping his confidence. No longer able to rely on his groundstrokes and the accuracy of his serves, Ferrer saw his form and ranking decline.\n\nNotwithstanding those set-backs, Ferrer never lost his love for tennis or his desire to compete. He even won a title in the summer of 2017 on the claycourts of Båstad, Sweden.\n\nBy the time of the Germany/Spain Davis Cup tie in April of 2018, Ferrer had recovered his game sufficiently to play for the Spanish team in his hometown and in front of his family, his wife, and his friends.\n\n(“The Armada” in Valencia.)\n\n“The Armada,” as the Spanish team calls itself, was the oldest team contesting this year’s Davis Cup quarterfinals. Its opponent, Germany, fielded the youngest. Throughout the weekend, Germany’s youngsters pushed Spain to the brink.\n\nRafael Nadal delivered wins in his two singles matches, as was expected (or at least hoped, given his winter injury struggles) of the “King of Clay.” Ferrer lost his first singles match to 6’6″, World #3 Alexander Zverev. The doubles match — crucial to many Davis Cup ties — was a nail-biter, lasting five sets and eventually going to the plucky German pair. The outcome of the tie was to be decided by a contest between Germany’s veteran, 34-year-old Philipp Kohlschreiber, and the 36-year-old Ferrer.\n\nOver five hours and seven minutes, Kohlschreiber and Ferrer scrapped and battled. More than once, Kohlschreiber appeared to have the match in hand, only to have Ferrer seize the initiative by (as is his wont) breaking when Kohlschreiber attempted to serve for a set.\n\nOn the match point, after Ferrer hit his final blistering, crosscourt backhand, he stood and waited, unsure whether his shot had landed in. After Kohlschreiber had viewed the ball mark and slumped in resignation, Ferrer collapsed to the ground in relief. Hero of the weekend, Ferrer had ensured that his team would play this coming September in another Davis Cup semifinal.\n\nThat valiant and emotional victory will stand as one of the last, if not the last, of Ferrer’s landmark wins.\n\nIn the weeks after his Davis Cup triumph, Ferrer withdrew of four tournaments in order to be home with his wife, Marta, when his son, Leo, was born. When he finally returned to competition in May, Ferrer was a shadow of his best. He has since won a few matches but never two in a row. Ferrer admits today that the physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion of having a new baby has worn him down. He no longer has either the physical consistency or the mental focus crucial to the success of his game.\n\nFerrer has realized that “this journey of [his] life is coming to an end.”\n\nIn July, he announced his plans to retire. He said he would play the North American summer hard court events. For the rest of 2018 and the start of 2019, he plans to play events if he is invited to. He hopes to retire at home in the spring on clay, in either Barcelona or Madrid.\n\nThis week, for the first time since 2003, Ferrer has dropped out of the Top 100. He arrives at the U.S. Open eager to play (declaring that he “loves tennis”) but far below his best. He plays for the joy of it now, even though at times his Achilles tendons hurt so much that he can barely walk down stairs. With Marta and Leo at his side, he says he plans to “live” the U.S. Open as his last Major.\n\n(Posted by David Ferrer.)\n\nHe will walk onto court for his first-round match on Monday night against teammate, rival, friend — and World #1, and defending U.S. Open champion! — Rafael Nadal. On paper, Nadal is a terrible draw for Ferrer, but Ferrer says he views the match as “a gift.” Facing Nadal enables him to play what may well be his last U.S. Open match in tennis’ biggest arena, Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nWhen Nadal and Ferrer last met at the U.S. Open — in the 2007 Round of 16 — Ferrer prevailed in four hard-fought sets. Ferrer is not as strong a player today as he was then, and Nadal for his part has improved. Although it is possible the Ferrer will beat Nadal on Monday — he has, after all, beaten Nadal six times — the most likely ending will see Ferrer waving good-bye to the crowd as he exits the court for the last time.\n\nFerrer reached the U.S. Open quarterfinals three times and the semifinals twice. As the Ashe night session crowd watches what may be his final effort at a Major, I hope they remember his shining moments in Flushing Meadows.\n\n– His 2007 victory over then-#2 Nadal, which helped propel Ferrer to a Top-8 finish for the year.\n\n– His riveting win over Janko Tipsarevic in the 2012 quarterfinals, which came down to a fifth-set tiebreak.\n\n– The first-set of his 2012 semifinal against Novak Djokovic, in which Ferrer adapted beautifully to windy conditions while Djokovic struggled. (The match was called because of a threatened storm, which never materialized. When the pair resumed play on the following day in still conditions, Djokovic won. Had the match continued in the wind, Ferrer might well have prevailed. This was certainly the closest Ferrer came to a U.S. Open final. It might have been his closest brush with a Major title.)\n\n– His 2013 rematch against Janko Tipsarevic in the Round of 16, which Ferrer won in four sets, and in which Ferrer characteristically broke serve at least once while his opponent was serving for a set.\n\nI hope the crowd on Monday night bestows upon Ferrer the respect and admiration he deserves. Ferrer always gave his all and fought until the last ball had bounced twice.\n\nFerrer’s career ranks him among the sport’s all-time best, possibly (as some fans suggest) meriting a place one day in the Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nThe ATP World Tour will be much poorer without Ferrer’s fight, his heart, his humility, his work ethic, and his soft-spoken wisdom.\n\nAdiós, Ferru.\n\nAnd thank you.\n\nThe best Ferrer highlight reel I have seen.\n\nThe men’s tennis World #1, Rafael Nadal of Spain, was derailed in his attempt to win a second Australian Open title by an injury that forced him out of his quarterfinal against Croatia’s Marin Cilic.\n\nInjury, and specifically injury in Australia, is familiar territory for Nadal and his fans. On three previous occasions – during his quarterfinal against Andy Murray in 2010, during his quarterfinal against David Ferrer in 2011, and during the final against Stan Wawrinka in 2014 – Nadal suffered injuries that stopped him in his tracks (knee, thigh, and back, respectively).\n\nThis year’s setback, though, differed from the others. During his previous Australia injury losses, Nadal was never in a winning position. He lost in 2010 and in 2011 in straight sets, and he won a set in 2014 only because Wawrinka played execrably for a half-hour. Against Cilic in 2018, however, Nadal was up in the score by two sets to one and playing well enough to win when, in the fourth game of the fourth set, he pulled a right hip flexor muscle on a sprint to the net.\n\nHad the injury not occurred, Nadal might well have won the match. His record against the semifinal opponent, Kyle Edmund, suggests that absent the injury, Nadal would probably have reached the final.\n\nWhile Nadal’s fans gnash their teeth and grumble about the Spaniard’s rotten luck in Australia since his 2009 title run, his serendipitous absence from this year’s final cast a spotlight onto two unpleasant facts that would have remained sub rosa had Nadal played for the trophy.\n\nRoger Federer is not the infallible box office draw that journalists, commentators, and others in the tennis establishment assert that he is.\n\nMidway through the tournament’s second week, ESPN’s John McEnroe declared, “Roger Federer is the player people come to see!”\n\nThis rang false when he said it. The 2017 Wimbledon final between Federer and Cilic garnered poor television ratings in the United States, while the most-watched stream from that Wimbledon tournament was a match featuring Nadal, not Federer.\n\nBecause about 90 percent of tennis commentators and writers are Federer zealots, it is understandable that McEnroe, who seems rarely to step outside the tennis media bubble, might be under the impression that Federer sells the most tickets. Evidence from this year’s Australian Open final suggests otherwise.\n\nHere was Roger Federer, treated as a god by many in the sporting media, reputed to be the most graceful athlete ever to don gym shoes, attempting to win an historic 20th Major title in a sparkling career.\n\nAnd there were still tickets available at full price (or at discounts!) a scant four hours before the match was to begin?\n\nHad Nadal played in the final, the match would have sold out; his sizable and enthusiastic local fan base would have snapped the tickets up.\n\nNadal’s absence from the final made it all too evident that Federer is not McEnroe’s “player people come to see.”\n\nThe tennis establishment – commentators, writers, governing bodies, and tournament managers – does itself a disservice with its worshipful focus on Federer. Data from Wimbledon 2017 and Australia 2018 suggest that if the sport continues to promote Federer at the expense of other players, it does so at its peril.\n\n2. The tennis establishment is willing to “grease the skids” for Federer.\n\nThroughout the Australian Open fortnight, Federer played essentially a different tournament from everyone else. Daytime temperatures soared above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, reaching at court level in the “heat bowls” of the stadia up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Federer’s potential opponents for later rounds, including his most recent vanquisher, World #7 David Goffin, sweltered through afternoon matches and lost. Federer, meanwhile, was generously scheduled for the cooler evenings in five of his first six rounds. (The sole exception was a gimme fourth-round contest with world #80 Marton Fucsovics.)\n\nFans complained mightily and with justification as six-time former champion Novak Djokovic was forced to play the highly entertaining, and box office gold, Gael Monfils in oven-like conditions on the same day as one of Federer’s evening matches. (On the other half of the draw, the box office stars Nadal and Grigor Dimitrov alternated in the daytime and evening slots during the five rounds they both played.)\n\nThat Federer’s salubrious scheduling throughout the tournament smacked of favoritism all observers agreed, but no one could identify clear bias on the part of the tournament until the final.\n\nConditions were forecast to be hot for the 7 p.m. final on Sunday, 28 January, with temperatures in the high 30s C (above 95 degrees Fahrenheit). Cilic warmed up for the match on an outdoor court in order to become acclimated to the conditions. Presumably, he set his string tensions, which are sensitive to temperature and humidity, accordingly.\n\nMeanwhile, Federer made the puzzling decision to prepare for the contest on an indoor court.\n\nShortly before match time, the tournament announced its decision to close the roof of Rod Laver Arena and turn on the air conditioning. Cilic had been given no warning. His string tensions were all wrong. Unsurprisingly, he started slowly. Cilic lost the first four games of the match and, although he pushed the match to five sets, he never recovered.\n\nAccording to the tournament’s own Extreme Heat Policy (which had not been invoked a day before, when the women’s finalists fought so hard over nearly three hours that one was sent to the hospital with dehydration), the stadium roof is to be closed only when both the following criteria obtain: ambient air temperature over 40 C, and a humidity measure called “wet bulb” above a specific threshold. Although the wet bulb reading on the evening of the men’s final was slightly above threshold, the air temperature was never over 37 C.\n\nFrom the tournament’s official media guide:\n\nClosing the stadium roof changes court conditions profoundly. Indoor courts are windless and more humid than outdoor courts. Tennis balls tend to bounce lower indoors than outdoors.\n\nAll four of the Grand Slams are supposed to be outdoor tournaments at which players are tested against the elements. Only two men’s Slam finals have ever been played under roofs: the 2012 Australian Open, and 2012 Wimbledon. In both cases, the matches started in the open air, and the roofs were closed only because of rain. The 2018 Australian Open final is the first men’s Slam final to have been played entirely indoors.\n\nNot coincidentally, Roger Federer is one of the best indoor players in the history of tennis. Wind is his adversary, neutering his aggressive attacking style. A closed roof suits him to perfection.\n\nHad Cilic been warned that the roof was to be closed for the final, he would have had a chance. He would have prepared himself and his racquets for the conditions he would face. But he was not told in advance.\n\nAnd Federer is quite candid about the fact that he was told.\n\nSo the Australian Open violated its own heat rules to close the roof for the men’s final, thus handing the better indoor player (Federer) an advantage. They told Federer in advance, enabling him to prepare himself and his string tensions for the cooler air. They did not warn Cilic.\n\nIn the long and colorful history of sports malfeasance, I think medals and trophies have been stripped for less.\n\nOf course, it is not Federer’s responsibility to keep his opponent informed. He might not have known that the tournament was leaving Cilic in the dark.\n\nThat said, the tournament’s cheating on Federer’s behalf rather than Federer’s cheating himself does not render his title any more legitimate.\n\nOnly the appearance of corruption is necessary in order to ruin a sport and thus destroy the livelihoods of many.\n\nAs writer Andrew Prochnow pointed out, “Had Nadal been in [the] final, blowback from roof closure would have made that act impossible.” The tournament would not have dared pull the same trick.\n\nTennis fans have long suspected tournaments and the sport’s governing bodies of taking subtle steps to favor Federer, from unfair scheduling decisions, to selective rule enforcement (such as a disproportionate focus on the Time Rule during Nadal’s matches in 2015), to selective rule non-enforcement (e.g., in Montreal in 2017, when Federer should have been called for both ball abuse and audible obscenity and thus lost a penalty point against Ferrer but was not cited for either infraction), to ad hoc rule changes (e.g., requiring players to stand for the coin toss within 60 seconds of walking onto court, which affects Nadal more than any other player).\n\nEven the Slams’ dropping from 32 seeds to 16 seeds in 2019, which appears to be favored only by a handful of bored journalists, would have the effect of knocking out the player(s) who make(s) slow and/or nervous starts in the Slams. This is usually Nadal.\n\nUntil now, tennis fans have been unable to prove structural favoritism toward Federer. With the 2018 Australian Open final, everything has changed. It is now demonstrably clear that the tennis establishment, if given the opportunity, will cheat on Federer’s behalf.\n\nThis is terrible for tennis.\n\nWorld #8 Tomas Berdych on the velvety Roland Garros clay.\n\nAfter six weeks and ten tournaments in nine countries, the men’s European clay court season arrives at its apogee and ultimate proving ground this coming week at the French Open. Action begins tomorrow, May 22, with 16 singles matches at Roland Garros in Paris.\n\nA few quick thoughts about what we have learned from the men’s clay court warm-up events —\n\nWho’s Out\n\nRoger Federer, suffering from a combination of knee and back injuries that kept him out of the Masters 1000 tournament in Madrid and led to early losses in Monte Carlo and Rome, withdrew from the French Open in advance of the tournament draw. Federer, whose game is much better suited to grass than to clay, hopes to resume competition in time for the pre-Wimbledon grass court tournaments.\n\nJuan Martin del Potro, on the comeback trail from a series of four wrist surgeries, decided to forgo Roland Garros and move immediately to the grass, where he hopes his booming serve will pay dividends.\n\nThe charismatic and highly talented Frenchman Gael Monfils — ever a crowd favorite, and one of the most upbeat and good-natured players on the tour — was forced to withdraw from Roland Garros after being hospitalized this week with a viral illness.\n\nWho Has Proven Himself to be a Dangerous Contender\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem won the title today in Nice and reached the final in Munich, where he lost a very tight contest to German veteran Philipp Kohlschreiber. Earlier, in Monte Carlo, he mounted a very stiff challenge to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.\n\nCurrently ranked 15 in the world and rising quickly, Thiem will surely win the French Open someday. Five of his six titles to date, and two of his three in 2016, have come on clay. His well-rounded game is precise, aggressive, and great fun to watch.\n\nHe will arrive in Paris brimming over with confidence from his win in Nice although perhaps somewhat tired. He is a dangerous opponent for anyone.\n\nJapan’s Kei Nishikori, currently ranked #6 in the world, delivered several strong performances this year on the European clay. He reached the final in Barcelona, where he lost a close match to Rafael Nadal. At the Masters 1000 events in both Madrid and Rome, he played barnburner semifinal matches with World #1 Novak Djokovic, losing in two sets in Madrid and in three sets in Rome.\n\nOver the course of his career, Nishikori has beaten every player now seeded ahead of him at Roland Garros (Djokovic, Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka, and Nadal). His speed, footwork, and shotmaking, and his ability to rob opponents of time by “taking the ball early,” make him formidable on clay. Fortuitously blessed with a good draw, Nishikori could easily reach the quarterfinals, where he might encounter Andy Murray.\n\nIf he keeps his health and fitness, Nishikori could well find himself hoisting the Coupe des Mousquetaires on June 5.\n\nDefending French Open champion Stan Wawrinka will arrive in Paris as he did last year, having bolstered his confidence with a victory at his home tournament in Geneva.\n\nOwner of a powerful forehand, a strong serve, and a one-handed backhand that is both lethal and sublime, Wawrinka can beat anyone on the right day. Although inconsistent and unpredictable, “Stan the Man,” as his sponsors call him, proved last year in Paris that he is capable of winning the title.\n\nThe Favorites?\n\nThe 2016 men’s singles competition at Roland Garros is the most open in years, with three players having emerged from the Masters 1000-level events as favorites (and perhaps even as co-favorites): Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal.\n\nNadal won the title in Monte Carlo without ever facing Djokovic.\n\nDjokovic won the title in Madrid without ever facing Nadal.\n\nMurray lost to Nadal in the semifinals of Monte Carlo and beat him in the semifinals of Madrid.\n\nMurray lost to Djokovic in the final at Madrid and beat him in the final at Rome.\n\nDjokovic and Nadal faced each other once, in the quarterfinals of Rome, where Djokovic won 7-5 7-6. Nadal said afterward that he was happy with his performace, that both sets had been “on his racquet,” and that he had been, “very, very, very close” to winning.\n\nOnly Nadal of the three favorites won two titles in the lead-up to Roland Garros: in Monte Carlo and in Barcelona (a competitive 500-level tournament where neither Murray nor Djokovic was in the field).\n\nThe tournament whose conditions (i.e., altitude, clay quality, weather) are most similar to Roland Garros is Monte Carlo. Nadal won that title, beating Murray in the semifinal. Djokovic lost in his first match.\n\nMadrid, featuring high altitude and hard-packed clay, is the least like Roland Garros. Djokovic won that title, beating Murray in the final. Murray had beaten Nadal in the semifinal.\n\nRome, like Paris, is at sea level. There, Murray beat Djokovic in a hard-fought, testy, and rainy final.\n\nCan one divine French Open outcomes from this data?\n\nFirst, a few words about the tournament draw.\n\nNadal’s Roland Garros draw is freakishly difficult. His first opponent, the 6’4″ cannon-serving Australian Sam Groth, demands intense concentration from his opponent and offers no rally rhythm. The last time Nadal opened a French Open campaign against a “serve-bot” (2011, against 6’10” John Isner), Nadal got down two sets to one and needed five sets to eke out a victory.\n\nIn the third round, Nadal could face the flamboyantly talented and dangerously unpredictable Fabio Fognini, who beat Nadal three times in 2015. The fourth round could bring a meeting with Dominic Thiem (see above).\n\nIn the quarterfinal, Nadal could face France’s Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who has the physical skills to beat anyone on the tour, and who will have the enthusiastic support of the home crowd. In the semifinal, Nadal could face Djokovic.\n\nOver his first five rounds, Djokovic faces a relative cakewalk. None of Djokovic’s early-round opponents has any recent history of success against him.\n\nMurray will have a tricky first match against the wily 37-year-old Czech Radek Stepanek, whose variety and unpredictability can be maddeningly difficult to face. En route to the quarterfinals, Murray could encounter two tricky serve-bots, John Isner and the 6’11” Ivo Karlovic, though neither is likely to threaten Murray’s exemplary return game and defense.\n\nMurray could face formidable challenges in the quarterfinals against Nishikori and in the semifinals against Wawrinka.\n\nMurray will not face either Djokovic or Nadal until the final.\n\nWhat does their Rome match and other recent history say about a Djokovic/Nadal semifinal?\n\nDjokovic owns a 26-23 career head-to-head record against Nadal and has won their last seven meetings, three of which have been on clay. Advantage, Djokovic? Not necessarily.\n\nFrom mid-2011 until mid-2012, Djokovic also won seven straight matches against Nadal. By the end of his seventh loss (the 2012 Australian Open final), Nadal had figured out how to counter Djokovic’s new tactics. When the two next met, at the 2012 French Open final, Nadal won.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that Nadal’s loss to Djokovic in Rome earlier this month would put him at a mental disadvantage in Paris. I am not so sure.\n\nNadal’s competitive psychology is such that he takes every opponent seriously and approaches every match with the idea that he “needs to play [his] best tennis in order to have chances to win.” (That phrase has appeared in his press conference transcripts innumerable times over the years.)\n\nHad a few points gone differently in their match in Rome, and had Nadal prevailed over Djokovic, he likely would have thought, “OK, I won, but it was close. I still need to play my best to have chances to win.” Djokovic, meanwhile, would have arrived at the following Nadal match full of vinegar and determination to avenge his recent loss.\n\nHaving lost in Rome, but having kept the match very close, Nadal will probably approach his next meeting with Djokovic with optimism (in addition to his usual intention to play his best).\n\nThe contest between Nadal and Djokovic in Rome proved that Nadal is ready to compete toe-to-toe with Djokovic. Both players know that now. This cannot be a comfortable feeling for Djokovic.\n\nWhat about Andy Murray?\n\nMurray has long been one of the sport’s greatest defenders – he can chase down and return shots all day – but aggressive play does not come naturally to him. He has a decent first serve, but his second serve has traditionally been his most attackable weakness. Mentally, he has not always exhibited the fortitude and consistency necessary to win against the best players.\n\nIn 2016, Murray has improved both his first serve and his second serve and implemented successful plans of attack against both of his major rivals. During the Rome final against Djokovic, he managed to be the mentally and emotionally stronger combatant under very difficult and rainy conditions.\n\nIf Murray reaches a final against either Djokovic or Nadal, he can take some confidence from the fact that his most recent meeting with each on the clay courts this year was a win.\n\nMurray has never in the past been considered a contender at Roland Garros, but as Stan Wawrinka demonstrated in 2015 (after losing in the first round of the 2014 French Open), history is irrelevant.\n\nIt is the best player on the day who wins.\n\n(Photo by @puepppy.)\n\nPlease click here to see the revised and updated version of this article published in 2019.\n\nIn April, professional tennis players change their shoes.\n\nGone are the standard smooth “tennies” designed for comfort on hard courts. In their place are textured soles optimized for traction on loose, red powder.\n\nA whirlwind of travel that carries players through the summer heat of Australia, South America, and the tropics and sets them down in March on the hard courts of North America, delivers them in April to the European “red dirt.” There they contest a series of clay court tournaments that culminates in the French Open.\n\nOver the next six weeks, in eight different countries, players will be tested in what many fans believe to be the purest form of tennis — where the surface gives no advantage to raw power, where players must be proficient at every aspect of the game (serve, return, groundstrokes, volleys, and defense), and where players face the greatest physical and mental demands of the year.\n\nWhat is the “clay”?\n\nThe “clay” in a modern clay court is typically crushed brick layered upon a gravel base to improve drainage. The court’s top layer is a fine red powder.\n\nMuch as an ice rink is smoothed periodically by a Zamboni, a clay court is swept to rid the surface of footprints, skid marks, gouges, and ball marks. Usually, a clay court is swept after every set and sprayed with water as needed to prevent the top surface dust from blowing.\n\nWhat makes clay court tennis special?\n\nThe key characteristics of a clay court, from a player’s perspective:\n\nIt is slippery.\n\nMovement on a clay court is night-and-day different from movement on the hard courts on which professionals spend most of the year. Stopping, starting, and changing direction are all made more difficult by the court’s dusty top layer. Balance becomes especially critical.\n\nThe slipperiness affects tactics (for example, it’s especially profitable on clay to aim a shot behind a moving opponent) and profoundly affects a player’s timing. The most adept claycourters learn to slide into their shots.\n\nThe ball’s bounce is high.\n\nClay rewards players who put heavy topspin (i.e., forward spin) onto a ball by giving topspin shots a high bounce. (By contrast, on grass courts and many indoor hard courts, top-spinning balls tend to say low.)\n\nThe high bounce can throw off an opponent’s timing and/or place the ball above an his optimal “strike zone,” in either case making it difficult for an opponent to hit the ball with power and accuracy.\n\nThe ball always leaves a mark on the court surface.\n\nAt clay tournaments, players cannot ask for computerized “Hawkeye” challenges, because every shot leaves a mark. Instead, players can summon umpires out of their chairs to check ball marks.\n\nOr, in rare cases, compel a cameraman to photograph a mark.\n\nThe surface is “slow.”\n\nAs the ball strikes the court surface, the clay holds it briefly during the bounce, giving an opponent an extra fraction of a second to reach the ball. (By contrast, grass courts and many hard courts are “fast.”)\n\n(from news.bbc.co.uk)\n\nConsequently, it is much more difficult on clay than on a hard court for a player to hit a winning shot past his opponent. Rallies are long, and matches are both physically and mentally arduous on clay.\n\nClay rewards players who have good defensive skills (i.e., the ability to run down opponents’ shots and keep a ball in play). Some of the tour’s most proficient claycourters, including Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and David Ferrer, excel at forcing their opponents to “hit one extra shot” and eventually miss.\n\nDefense alone, though, is not sufficient to guarantee wins. Those who succeed on clay know when and how to hit an aggressive shot that either takes control of a rally or wins a point outright.\n\nClay rewards decision-making, shot-selection, problem-solving, patience, and the vanishing art of point construction — the chess match wherein each player tries to think several shots ahead and outmaneuver his opponent to make space on the court for a winning shot.\n\nExecuted well, clay court tennis offers both breathtaking athleticism and fascinating drama.\n\nThe Spring European Clay Court Season\n\nThe marquee event of the clay court season is the French Open, the calendar year’s second Grand Slam tournament, held at Roland Garros in Paris. To ensure that players reach Roland Garros in optimal clay court form, the tennis tour devotes six weeks to warm-up tournaments in Europe.\n\nWeek 1: Monte Carlo\n\nLeading off the series is the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters tournament. First played in 1897, this “Masters 1000” event (one tier below the Grand Slams) offers fans and players alike the most beautiful setting of the season.\n\nThe 2016 event, which begins on April 10, boasts the strongest field in years, with seven of the world’s top eight players and a bumper crop of highly talented youngsters playing. There are no easy matches. Nearly every player faces a tough slate of potential opponents.\n\nThe defending champion is World #1 Novak Djokovic of Serbia, who has won the event twice in the last three years.\n\nRafael Nadal won eight consecutive titles in Monte Carlo, from 2005 through 2012. His record might never be equaled.\n\nUpdate: Rafael Nadal def. Gael Monfils 7-5 5-7 6-0 to win the title in Monte Carlo.\n\nClick here for Five Quick Thoughts about the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters.\n\nWeek 2: Barcelona and Bucharest\n\nDuring the week of April 18, some lower ranked players who did not qualify for the Monte Carlo tournament will begin their French Open preparations at a smaller “250” event Bucharest. Most of the top players will either sit the week out or travel to a medium-sized “500” event in Barcelona.\n\nBecause Barcelona’s Open BancSabadell serves as the Spanish national championship, nearly every healthy Spanish player is in the field. Thirty-four-year-old Spaniard David Ferrer has said that winning the Barcelona title would mean as much to him as winning a Grand Slam.\n\nFourteen of the last 20 Barcelona champions have been Spanish, including eleven straight from 2003 to 2013 (and Rafael Nadal eight times between 2005 and 2013), but the player to hoist the tournament’s enormous trophy in the last two years has been the scrappy Japanese baseliner Kei Nishikori.\n\nUpdate: Rafael Nadal def. Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-5 to win his ninth title in Barcelona.\n\nFernando Verdasco def. Lucas Pouille 6-3 6-2 to win the title in Bucharest.\n\nWeek 3: Istanbul, Munich, and Estoril\n\nIn the week of April 25, mid-level and lower ranked players will hone their clay court skills at three small 250-level tournaments in Istanbul, Munich, and Estoril, while most of the Top-20 players take a breather before back-to-back Masters 1000 events in Madrid and Rome.\n\nUpdate:\n\nPhilipp Kohlschreiber won a barn-burner of a final over Dominic Thiem, 7-6(7) 4-6 7-6(4), to take the title in Munich.\n\nDiego Sebastian Schwartzman upset Grigor Dimitrov 6-7(5) 7-6(4) 6-0 in Istanbul to win the first title of his career.\n\nNicolas Almagro outlasted his countryman Pablo Carreno Busta 6-7(6) 7-6(5) 6-3 to take the title in Estoril.\n\nWeek 4: Madrid\n\nSince the early 2000s, the lead-up to the French Open has included three Masters 1000 tournaments. Two of those three are the events in Monte Carlo and Rome. Until 2008, the third Masters 1000 on clay was held in Hamburg. Because of Hamburg’s inclement weather (and, most likely, some behind-the-scenes politics), the third clay Masters 1000 was moved to Madrid in 2009.\n\nThe Madrid tournament poses a unique challenge during the pre-Roland Garros swing: high altitude. The ball travels faster through the air in Madrid than at the sea-level events, and Madrid’s relatively dry air makes the court both faster and more slippery.\n\nAs a joint men’s and women’s event with limited court space, the Madrid tournament is known for its long days. Often matches start after 11 p.m.\n\nNearly every year of the Madrid clay event’s young life has brought intense drama.\n\nIn the inaugural event in 2009, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic played a four-hour-and-three-minute semifinal, which is the longest best-of-three-set match in the Open Era of men’s tennis. Nadal won the match but had nothing left for the next day’s final. The psychological blow of losing that marathon may have contributed to Djokovic’s loss in the third round of that year’s French Open. The physical wear-and-tear surely contributed to the knee problems that led to Nadal’s fourth-round loss at the French and his subsequent two-month absence from the tour.\n\nIn 2011, Djokovic surprised Nadal and angered the home crowd by carrying out some decidedly in-your-face celebrations after beating Nadal in the final, including (by some accounts) a swim in a nearby canal and noisy dancing with his team on top of a parked car.\n\nIn 2012, the tournament replace the red clay with blue clay. Although the blue clay showed up better on television, it might have been catastrophic for the players, because it was extremely slippery. Players who typically remain centered over their feet, such as Roger Federer and David Ferrer, were relatively unaffected. For Nadal and Djokovic, who tend to hit more off-balance defensive shots, the conditions were potentially lethal. After 2012, the tournament switched back to red clay.\n\nIn 2013, a crowd still angry at Djokovic for his behavior in 2011 gave him a hard time during his loss to Grigor Dimitrov. Djokovic, who has never had patience with hostile crowds, and who often behaves as though every crowd owes him affection, screamed at his hecklers in Serbian, “You can lick my ____, and I can ____ your mothers!”\n\nDjokovic has not played in Madrid since 2013. This year he will return. It will be interesting to see how he gets along with the assertive and opinionated Madrid fans.\n\nThe event’s defending champion is Andy Murray. Nadal has won the Madrid event on clay three times.\n\nUpdate: Novak Djokovic def. Andy Murray 6-2 3-6 6-3 to win the title in Madrid.\n\nClick here to read Four Lessons from the 2016 Mutua Madrid Open.\n\nWeek 5: Rome\n\nThe week after Madrid takes the players back to sea level at the Intenationali BNL d’Italia in Rome, first played in 1930. The tournament grounds feature a steeply raked stadium surrounded by statues in a classical style, located atop the site of the swimming venue of the 1960 summer Olympics.\n\nDjokovic comes into this year’s Rome event as the two-time defending champion, having won the title four times in the last six years. Nadal holds the record for Rome titles with seven.\n\nUpdate: Andy Murray def. Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-3 in the Rome final to win his third clay title and his second at the Masters 1000 level.\n\nWeek 6: Nice and Geneva\n\nThe last week before the French Open will find most of the top-ranked players in Paris practicing at Roland Garros, speaking to the media, and appearing at sponsor events. Meanwhile, 250-level events in Nice and Geneva offer final tune-up opportunities for late-arriving journeymen players as well as a few hometown stars.\n\nUpdate:\n\nStan Wawrinka def. Marin Cilic 6-4 7-6(11) to win his second consecutive Geneva title and his third title of 2016.\n\nLike Wawrinka, Dominic Thiem defended his 2015 title and earned his third trophy of 2016 by defeating fellow rising star Alexander Zverev 6-4 3-6 6-0 in Nice.\n\nWeeks 7 and 8: The French Open, Roland Garros, Paris\n\nOn 22 May, 128 men will begin the quest for the year’s second Grand Slam singles title at the French Open at Roland Garros. Fifteen days later, one man will hoist aloft the tournament’s storied trophy, the Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nBecause Roland Garros is the only Slam site with no lighting for night matches, and since clay matches tend to be long, the French Open is the only Slam whose first match is held on a Sunday.\n\nEvery Grand Slam tournament offers compelling drama from the start. It is fascinating to watch players ranked 70 or 80 in the world, with no hope of winning the title, battle tooth-and-nail for the right to advance to the next round. Every day of the first week promises valor, heart, and sportsmanship.\n\nOne of my favorite tales of Roland Garros valor took place in 2013 and starred thirty-one-year-old Spaniard Tommy Robredo. Known as a tenacious fighter, and expert like many of his countrymen in the art of tennis on clay, Robredo outdid himself by coming back from two-sets-to-none deficits to win five-set matches in three consecutive rounds, a feat unmatched in the previous 86 years. After his third comeback, Robredo collapsed the court in tears as the stadium crowd chanted his name.\n\nMore drama, of the “never-a-dull-moment” variety, erupted later in the same event, when flare-wielding political protestors crashed the men’s final between Nadal and Ferrer, spooking both contestants.\n\nIn addition to the French crowd’s perennial hope for a homegrown champion, the intrigue at Roland Garros 2016 — whose field is more open than it has been in years — features a cast of terrific clay court players all of whom have fascinating storylines.\n\nThe Contenders\n\nIt is highly probable that the man left holding the Coupe de Mousquetaires this year will be one of a short list of “usual suspects.”\n\nThe King of Clay – Rafael Nadal\n\nPhoto by @zoricdragan.\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Spaniard Rafael Nadal is the greatest clay court player in the history of tennis.\n\nHe leads all men in the Open Era with a staggering 91.6 match winning percentage on clay.\n\nHe is in second place in the Open Era with 47 titles on clay.\n\nHe won a record 81 consecutive matches on clay from 2006 to 2008.\n\nHe won in excess of 50 consecutive semifinal matches on clay from 2008 to 2015.\n\nSeveral attributes of Nadal’s highly individualistic style are especially well suited to the red dirt.\n\nThe unmatched topspin he applies to his shots, especially to his forehand with the distinctive “lariat” follow-through.\n\nExcellent, precise footwork.\n\nA deep understanding of the game and of point construction.\n\nFormidable problem-solving skills.\n\nGreat competitive intensity that wears down many opponents as Nadal plays every point as though it were his last.\n\nNadal has won eight Monte Carlos, eight Barcelonas, three Madrid titles on clay (and one when the tournament was played on an indoor hard court), seven Romes, and nine French Opens.\n\nThat’s nine titles at the most physically and mentally demanding Major tournament.\n\nNo one else has ever won as many as eight titles at a single Slam.\n\nNadal is no slouch on surfaces other than clay. He owns four titles, including two Wimbledons, on grass (which, fast and low-bouncing, is essentially the opposite of clay). On hardcourts, he has sixteen titles, include two US Opens and one Australian Open.\n\nNadal’s career has been a series of injury outages followed by comebacks.\n\nIn 2005, six months after winning his first French Open, Nadal broke a bone in his left foot (later found to have been congenitally deformed) and was reduced to hitting balls while seated in a desk chair.\n\nIn 2006, he returned to the tour, won his second French Open, and reached his first of five consecutive Wimbledon finals.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, the arch supports he was required to wear to protect his vulnerable foot started to wreak havoc on his knees. In 2009, knee pain forced to stop competing for two months and miss Wimbledon.\n\nIn 2010, in a spectacular run that started in Monte Carlo, Nadal won seven titles, including the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open, in the process becoming the first and only male player in the history of the sport to win three Slams on three different surfaces in the same year.\n\nIn 2012, severe knee tendonitis forced Nadal off of the tour again, causing him to miss the second half of the season, including the London Olympics.\n\nIn 2013, Nadal returned from a seven-month absence to win ten titles, including the French Open and the US Open, and finished the year at #1 – this in spite of his having missed the Australian Open entirely.\n\nIn 2014, Nadal suffered three apparently random physical failures: the first, a back injury that befell him in the middle of the Australian Open final in February; the second, a freak wrist injury in August that forced him to miss the US summer hard courts and the US Open; the third, in October — four days after he had returned to competition — acute appendicitis.\n\nIn 2015, Nadal experienced what he describes as a “mental injury.” For the first half of the year, he suffered crippling anxiety on court. He was unable to control his breathing or his emotions. He was, as he recently described it, “competing against himself.” During that stretch, Nadal delivered several truly baffling performances — including at Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Roland Garros, and later Wimbledon — in which he seemed unable to make decisions and could not hit accurate shots to save his life.\n\nThrough what he describes as “daily hard work,” Nadal was able to gradually rid himself of the anxiety. He told the press in October that those bad feelings had gone away.\n\nBecause he is what some coaches call a “confidence player,” Nadal faces a maddening chicken-and-egg problem during his every comeback:\n\nTo win matches, he needs the confidence to go for big shots on important points.\n\nTo have confidence, he needs to win matches.\n\nLast month, in Indian Wells in the desert of southern California, Nadal seemed at long last to have turned the corner. He had four good wins over difficult opponents and then played his best match against Djokovic in nearly two years.\n\nNadal said in a recent interview that, unlike last year, he now enjoys practices and matches, and he feels ready to compete with anyone.\n\nIn 2016, Nadal is fit, healthy, and happy as he returns to his favorite surface and to events where he has enjoyed great success in the past.\n\n(Memo to his would-be opponents: watch out.)\n\nThe Reigning King of the Tour – Novak Djokovic\n\nOne year Nadal’s junior, Serbia’s Novak Djokovic won his first Grand Slam title (in Australia) in 2009. After floating in the Top 4 for four years, Djokovic came into his own in 2011, winning the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open, and finishing the year at #1 for the first time.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Djokovic opened each year by telling the press in January of his desire (or intention) to win the year’s French Open, and thereby complete his Career Grand Slam (which Federer had achieved in 2009 at age 27 and Nadal in 2010 at age 24).\n\nIn 2012, Djokovic reached the Roland Garros final and lost to Nadal.\n\nIn 2013, Djokovic lost to Nadal in a semifinal — a virtuosic five-set masterpiece that has been called the greatest match ever played on clay.\n\nIn 2014, Djokovic again reached the final at Roland Garros and again lost to Nadal.\n\nLast year, with Nadal floundering, promised to be Djokovic’s golden opportunity. Reversing his Roland Garros script, Djokovic dispatched his usual nemesis by trouncing him efficiently in a quarterfinal.\n\nOn the morning of the final, only the Swiss Stan Wawrinka stood between Djokovic and his Career Grand Slam. After Djokovic won the first set, he seemed well on the way to achieving his much-talked-about dream.\n\nThen Wawrinka delivered the three best sets of tennis he has played in his life, a breathtaking display of power and precision. Pounding the ball off of both wings, Wawrinka kept Djokovic on the run. Wawrinka controlled most of the rallies with bludgeoned groundstrokes and hit winner after blistering winner.\n\nWhen it was over, and Djokovic stood on the podium once again holding the runner-up plate, he received a lengthy standing ovation from a crowd sympathetic to his plight.\n\nDuring the balance of 2015, Djokovic lost only two matches, both of them finals.\n\nDjokovic enters the 2016 European clay court season having won all of his completed matches this year (his only loss was a retirement), but he has shown some uncharacteristic vulnerability.\n\nAt the Australian Open, Frenchman Gilles Simon employed persistent defense to drive Djokovic to distraction, force Djokovic to five sets, and draw more than 90 unforced errors from the Serb’s racquet.\n\nIn Indian Wells, Djokovic lost a set to World #165 Bjorn Fratangelo and later against Nadal commited a striking number of errors with his best shot, the return of serve.\n\nIn Miami, Austrian Dominic Thiem was able to create a passel of break point opportunities against Djokovic but could not cash them in. In the next round, Belgian David Goffin broke Djokovic several times but was unable to maintain any advantage.\n\nIt is possible that Djokovic will “run the table” on the European clay. He might this year finally win the French Open.\n\nOr he might lose a few points at important moments and find himself on the unfamiliar losing end of a match.\n\nDjokovic will be the oddsmakers’ favorite at every event he plays from now through Roland Garros, but he is not a shoo-in.\n\nFederer\n\nWhen 34-year-old tennis superstar Roger Federer published his 2016 tournament schedule, his European clay court season was rather thin. Focusing on tournaments more likely to enhance his legacy (specifically, Wimbledon and the Rio Olympics), Federer had opted to minimize his work on clay.\n\nThen in early February, Federer’s plans were upended by a turn of events new in his experience: an injury that required surgery. Having been forced to sit out for two months, Federer decided recently to refocus on the clay events, beginning with Monte Carlo. This renders the tournaments both more interesting for fans and more lucrative for tournament sponsors.\n\nAlthough he might have lost with age a bit of speed and consistency, Federer is still the most graceful player ever to pick up a tennis racquet. With his lethal serve and time-robbing aggression, Federer can still consistently beat 80 to 85 percent of the players on the tour.\n\nFederer’s playing style is best suited to faster, low-bouncing surfaces (to wit, grass and indoor hard courts at sea level). Winning a clay tournament at the Masters 1000 or Grand Slam level is a tough task for him. That said, if breaks were to fall the right way, anything could happen.\n\nFederer, like Nadal, has shown repeatedly that one is unwise ever to write him off.\n\nThe Reigning French Open Champion – Stan Wawrinka\n\nSwitzerland’s Stan Wawrinka owns two Grand Slam titles: the 2014 Australian Open and the 2015 French Open. Physically strong, and blessed with a one-handed backhand as lethal as it is beautiful to watch, Wawrinka at his best can beat anyone on the tour.\n\nWawrinka is also wildly inconsistent. In 2014, the year of his first Grand Slam and also his first Masters 1000 title (in Monte Carlo), Wawrinka lost nine times in a tournament’s first round, including a straight-sets loss in the first round of Roland Garros.\n\nIn the following year, Wawrinka played brilliantly at Roland Garros, beat both Federer and Djokovic, and won the title.\n\nIt can be difficult to predict on any given day which Wawrinka will show up on court. Realistically, he could lose early in two or three events on the European clay. With equal probability, he might win three or four of the titles.\n\nAny Wawrinka match is worth watching for the quality of his tennis and for the likelihood of on-court drama.\n\nThe Intrepid Fighter – David Ferrer\n\nThirty-four-year-old Spaniard David Ferrer is known and respected on the tennis tour for his dogged determination and indefatigability.\n\nAlthough at 5’9″ Ferrer might be too small to win a Grand Slam during this Golden Age of men’s tennis, experts and commentators agree that in a different era Ferrer would have won at least one Slam and probably a French Open.\n\nWith 26 titles, Ferrer is the most highly decorated male player in the Open Era never to have won a Slam. Like many of his countrymen, Ferrer excels on clay, having won 12 of his titles on the red dirt. Ferrer has reached the semifinals on clay in Madrid, the final in Barcelona, the final in Monte Carlo, and the final in Rome. In 2013, he reached the final at Roland Garros, where he lost to Nadal.\n\nAlthough Ferrer might have slowed down somewhat with age, his disciplined point construction, tenacious defense, and outstanding return of serve can still carry him to victory over most players on clay, especially in a best-of-five-set format.\n\nFerrer may appear to be an outlier among these Contenders, since he has not yet won a title on the European clay, but I believe he belongs on this short list because in his trophy cabinet at home he has hardware from Roland Garros.\n\nOnly five active male players have contested a French Open final.\n\nNadal (2005 – 08, 2010 – 14)\n\nFederer (2006 – 09, 2011)\n\nDjokovic (2012, 2014, 2015)\n\nWawrinka (2015)\n\nFerrer (2013)\n\nThe Second Tier\n\nAmong the remaining 123 men who will contest the singles competition in Paris, at least 15 have the potential to cause upsets within the draw. Some worthy of especial note:\n\nDominic Thiem\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem is almost certainly a future French Open champion. As highly disciplined as he is talented, Thiem possesses a well-rounded game as well as a gorgeous one-handed backhand.\n\nThiem has won two titles so far this year, including on clay in Buenos Aires, where he beat Nadal in the semifinal. Although Thiem may not be ready to win seven best-of-five-set matches at Roland Garros, he might well be capable of taking a Masters 1000 title in the coming weeks.\n\nKei Nishikori\n\nWith a playing style sometimes described as “Djokovic without the celebrations,” Japan’s Kei Nishikori has established himself solidly among the game’s Top 10. Nishikori’s easy power and precise ball striking can carry him past any player. In recent years, he has notched wins over Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic.\n\nTwo of Nishikori’s eleven titles have come on clay, both in Barcelona. If he stays healthy, which is always the biggest question with Nishikori, he could be a threat at any of the European clay events.\n\nGilles Simon\n\nLike David Ferrer, Frenchman Gilles Simon has turned an unprepossessing physical presence into an asset. Although not endowed with great power, Simon brings to court some of the cleanest and most tenacious defensive skill on the tour. An absolute nightmare of a match-up in a best-of-five format, Simon could give the home fans reason to cheer into the second week at Roland Garros.\n\nRoberto Bautista Agut\n\nWith two titles already this year, 27-year-old Roberto Bautista Agut is the most successful Spanish player through the first quarter of 2016. In his short career on tour, he has won four titles, including one each on clay and grass.\n\nBautista Agut’s clean, well-rounded game is probably not strong enough to carry him to the trophy stand at any of the spring’s clay events, but he could serve as a spoiler.\n\nJo-Wilfried Tsonga\n\nAs a player, 30-year-old Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is a bit of an enigma.\n\nSometimes he channels his prodigious talent and athletic ability into an aggressive, powerful game that defeats all comers. He has beaten Federer twice in Grand Slams, including once at the French Open.\n\nAt other times — such as his 2013 dismantling by Ferrer one round after his victory over Federer at Roland Garros — Tsonga looks disoriented and defeated well before the end of the first set.\n\nA subject of Roland Garros scrutiny and pressure every year as a top French prospect, Tsonga truly has a game that would enable him to win.\n\nWhether he hoists any trophies this spring, or pulls off any important upsets, or bows his head in defeat, will depend upon which Tsonga shows up to play.\n\nSo who will win?\n\nI don’t make predictions. 🙂\n\nUpdate: Novak Djokovic def. Andy Murray 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 to win his first French Open title and complete his career Grand Slam.\n\nQuote for Today\n\n“If” doesn’t exist in sport. That’s the real thing. If, if, if – never comes. The thing is, you have to do it. – Rafael Nadal\n\nMen’s professional tennis is enjoying a Golden Age. Two of the sport’s stars, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, are vying for the title of “Greatest of All Time.” Close on their heels is Novak Djokovic, who currently dominates the tour and who will easily finish his career among the sport’s ten best. Further enhancing the quality of tennis week by week is an unprecedented number of seasoned veterans in the Top 100, players who because of advances in sports medicine and training techniques are able to maintain their fitness well into their 30s and benefit on court from hard-earned emotional maturity.\n\nThe year’s fourth and final Grand Slam tournament, the U.S. Open – in which 128 men compete in best-of-five-set matches scheduled over two weeks – will see farewell performances from two of the sport’s sentimental favorites, scrapping efforts from up-and-coming stars, legacy-burnishing performances from all-time greats, and numerous gut-wrenching fights in which both combatants give their all.\n\nTennis is rarely more fun or more fascinating than during a Grand Slam. Here are eleven reasons to watch in the days to come:\n\n1. The Big Four! (Or are they the Fab Five?)\n\nFour players – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray – have won 31 of the last 35 (and 37 of the last 43) Grand Slam tournaments, of which there are four per year, and 82 of the last 97 next-tier Masters 1000 tournaments, of which there are nine every year. The quartet’s wholesale dominance of the sport earned them the moniker “The Big Four.” Even as various members of the group have suffered injuries and illnesses or have otherwise slumped in recent years, a Big Four player (or two) has nearly always reached the finals of the important tournaments.\n\nThis summer, tennis writers decided to expand the Big Four into the Fab Five with the addition of 30-year-old Swiss player Stan Wawrinka, who has won as many Grand Slam titles as Andy Murray (two), and who soundly trounced Novak Djokovic in the final of this year’s French Open.\n\nWhy watch?\n\nA match involving a Fab Five player promises jaw-dropping virtuosity, heart-stopping fight, and more than a little drama.
