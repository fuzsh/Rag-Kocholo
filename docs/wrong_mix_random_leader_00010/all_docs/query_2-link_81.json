        "text": "During his 18-year career in professional tennis, Lleyton Hewitt won 30 career titles earning him a spot in Aussie hearts as one of our most loved athletes.\n\nBeing in the spotlight for so long, the public often saw the two-time Grand Slam champion with his children, Mia, Cruz and Ava Hewitt, who he shares with his wife Bec Hewitt.\n\nFormer Home and Away star Bec and Lleyton met at a charity tennis tournament in 1999. Talking to Stellar Magazine in 2018, Bec recalled the beginning of her relationship with the tennis star.\n\n“It was such a whirlwind, which I think was part of the reason why we ended up with such a lot of attention — because it was after only six weeks that we got engaged,” she said.\n\nThe couple moved to the Bahamas for seven years for Lleyton’s work, however they have since returned to their Melbourne home.\n\nNow, the couple's kids are all grown up and each have their own emerging passions. Here's what their lives look like now:\n\nMia Hewitt, 18.\n\nMia Hewitt has shown an interest in modelling, with her mum often posting headshots of her daughter to her Instagram.\n\nBut most recently, she was photographed at her graduation ceremony, where she received a Diploma of Branded Fashion Design.\n\nJust like other regular teenagers, Mia started off her career working in retail as a sales assistant for Christian Dior, and she's currently paving a path for herself in the fashion industry.\n\nIn 2019, Mia was given the opportunity to attend Paris Fashion Week alongside her mum, with Bec sharing the following photos:\n\nCruz Hewitt, 15.\n\nCruz Hewitt has followed in his father's footsteps, showing a keen interest in tennis. The 15-year-old frequently posts photos of himself playing the sport on Instagram, where he has over 18,000 followers.\n\nThe young athlete is showing signs of becoming a tennis prodigy just like his dad and was recently granted entry into the Australian Open Junior Championships.\n\nHis dad played in the same tournament over 25 years ago, back in 1996 when he was just 14 years old.\n\nCruz is ranked 199 in the boys ranking for his age group and joins 10 other Australian junior players in the championships.\n\nIt's clear his hard work and perseverance are paying off, after he experienced his first win at the Darwin Tennis International."
