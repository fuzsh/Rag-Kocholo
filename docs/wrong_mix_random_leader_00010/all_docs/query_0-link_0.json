        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame\n\nLleyton Hewitt was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame just in time for his 40th birthday.\n\nIn the major American sports, it is common that after the official end of a career five years have to pass before an athlete can move into the respective Hall of Fame. It cannot be ruled out that Lleyton Hewitt actually officially declared his active career ended five years ago. But what can you do? “Rusty”, who turned 40 on Wednesday, just can't help it. Most recently, the Australian tried his hand at the Australian Open with compatriot Jordan Thompson last year.\n\nThe International Tennis Hall of Fame is not contesting a possible further comeback: Hewitt, who celebrated his greatest triumph at Wimbledon in 2002, was inducted into the tennis hall of fame in Newport, Rhode Island as the only soloist from the circle of players. In addition to Hewitt, the “Original 9” will also move into the hall, the group of tennis players who paved the way for the WTA tour under the leadership of Billie-Jean King.\n\nAnd the reputation of a coach has also overtaken: Dennis van der Meer, born in Namibia, who was later given US citizenship, will receive his place of honor. However, posthumously - van der Meer died in 2019."
