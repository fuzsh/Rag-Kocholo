He was born in Nyiregyhaza, the seventh-largest city in Hungary, and resides in Budapest. His parents, Joszef and Edit, are both accountants. He plays for Hungary, the Central European nation still looking for its first Grand Slam singles champion in the Open Era, in the Davis Cup Team.\n\nWhen did Fucsovics start playing tennis?\n\nFucsovics, who goes by the nickname of ‘Marci’, started playing tennis at the age of 5 with his father at his local club in Nyiregyhaza. The Hungarian played several different sports, including football and basketball, as a kid before committing to tennis.\n\nWhat was Marton Fucsovics’ record as a junior?\n\nAs a junior, Marton Fucsovics peaked at No 1 in the ITF world junior rankings in July 2010. The Hungarian won the 2009 US Open Boys’ Doubles title, with Hsieh Cheng-peng of Chinese Taipei. The following year, he won the Wimbledon Boys’ Singles title beating Benjamin Mitchell.\n\nWho is Marton Fucsovics’ coach?\n\nFucsovics is coached by fellow Hungarians Zoltan Nagy and Miklos Jancso. He has been working with them since November 2019. Nagy peaked at No 297 in the singles rankings in 1997, while Jancso peaked at No 318 in the doubles rankings in 1998.\n\nHow many ATP Tour tournaments has Marton Fucsovics won?\n\nMarton Fucsovics has won one ATP Tour singles title in his career so far. He won the Geneva Open in 2018, beating two-time defending champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Peter Gojowczyk in the final.\n\nThat made Fucsovics the first Hungarian player to win an ATP Tour singles title since former world No 12 Balazs Taroczy, who won 13 ATP Tour singles titles in his career.\n\nFucsovics has also reached two other ATP Tour singles finals – in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2019 (losing to Daniil Medvedev) and in Rotterdam earlier this month (losing to Andrey Rublev). Rotterdam marked the first ATP 500 final of his career so far.\n\nMarton Fucsovic’s updated list of titles and finals are available on the ATP website.\n\nWhat is Marton Fucsovics’ best ranking?\n\nFucsovics reached his career-high ATP Tour ranking of No 31 in March 2019 soon after reaching the Sofia final and the Dubai quarter-finals that year. He is currently ranked No 40 in the world and has been ranked inside the Top 100 every week since October 23, 2017.\n\nMarton Fucsovic’s updated ranking and ranking history are available on the ATP website.\n\nHow much prize money has Marton Fucsovics won in his career?\n\nFucsovics has won over $3.8 million in career prize money (as of March 2021) with more than $330,000 of that coming in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nWhat is Marton Fucsovics’ record at the Grand Slams?\n\nFucsovics has played in the main draw at 15 Grand Slam events and has reached the round of 16 three times. Two of those came at the Australian Open (in 2018 and 2020), where he lost to Roger Federer each time.\n\nFucscovics also reached the fourth round at Roland-Garros in 2020, where he defeated 5th ranked Daniil Medvedev on the way. Prior to that match, the Hungarian had an 0-14 record against Top 10 players.\n\nElsewhere, his best performance at Wimbledon has been a second round appearance in 2019, and a third round appearance at the 2020 US Open.\n\nWhy is Marton Fucsovics called the “Ironman of Tennis”?\n\nMarton Fucsovics, who is 6ft 2in (1.88m) and weighs 82 kgs (181lbs), is known for his incredible physique, which has earned him the nickname of “Ironman of Tennis”.\n\nThe Hungarian spoke about the motivation and drive behind his incredible physique in a recent interview to the ATP Tour.\n\n“I was always a strong boy. I was working very hard physically, even when I was younger,” Fucsovics said. “I was a skinny boy when I was way younger, but my coaches told me that we had to work on my physique. I really wanted to improve. I was always a kid who wanted to improve and reach higher goals.”\n\nWho are Marton Fucsovics’ idols and rivals?\n\nMarton Fucsovics’ idols are Marat Safin, Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer. In a recent short film, Fucsovics spoke about Federer, and also about his goals of reaching the Top 10 and winning a Grand Slam among other things.\n\nAndrey Rublev stands as a big rival for Fucsovics, having lost his last four matches to the Russian since October 2020. After his most recent defeat, Fucsovics told Rublev, “I hope I don’t play you anymore this year,” but his wish was undone after just 11 days. He will face Rublev in the Miami Open in what will be their third straight clash at ATP tour events.\n\nWhat are Fucsovics’ hobbies?\n\nFucsovics enjoys travelling, spending time with his dog, watching movies, and hanging out with his friends in his free time. He also supports FC Barcelona."
