        "text": "(born 1981). Australian professional tennis player Lleyton Hewitt had astonishing court speed, fierce determination, and unrelenting ground strokes that allowed him to capture victories at both the U.S. Open (2001) and Wimbledon (2002).\n\nLleyton Glynn Hewitt was born on February 24, 1981, in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia, into an exceedingly athletic family; his father, uncle, and grandfather distinguished themselves as players in Australian rules football, and his mother was a physical education teacher who played netball. Hewitt played Australian rules football until he was 13, when he dedicated himself to tennis. He became the leading Australian junior tennis player in 1996. Two years later he secured his first professional singles title. By the end of 1999, he had advanced to number 22 in the world and had helped Australia to win the Davis Cup. Hewitt concluded 2000 ranked seventh in the world after having swept 61 of the 80 matches he contested that season, establishing himself as the first teenager since Pete Sampras in 1990 to garner four singles titles in a year."
