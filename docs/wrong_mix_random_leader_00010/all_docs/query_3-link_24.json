Each school or school district has its own policy regarding uniforms, so it varies from one school to another. Some schools may require uniforms, while others may not.\n\nWhere did Chief Joseph go to school at?\n\nChief Joseph did not attend a formal school. He received his education from his elders and through traditional Nez Perce teachings.\n\nWhere did Sojourner Truth go to in high school?\n\nSojourner Truth did not attend high school due to being born into slavery and facing significant barriers to education.
