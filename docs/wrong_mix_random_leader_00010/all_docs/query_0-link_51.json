        "text": "By Charlotte Daly for MailOnline\n\nSlating the music at the Australian Open in 2016\n\nThe 2016 Australian Open was a bit of a disaster for Kyrgios. He complained about the music, swore excessively and threw his racket across the court during his loss to Tomas Berdych.\n\nBerdych took the first set in 35 minutes, with Kyrgios appearing to complain towards his box â which contained Aussie great Lleyton Hewitt â that there was not enough vocal encouragement.\n\nHowever, the most notable moment of the match came when Kyrgios stepped up to the line to serve in the second set. He stopped to complain about music he could hear, which is understood to have come from the neighbouring MCG which was hosting cricketâs Big Bash League semi-final.\n\nThe 2016 Australian Open was a disaster for Kyrgios â who complained about everything\n\nIf that wasnât enough, Kyrgios then engaged in a heated exchange with British umpire James Keothavong. Their conversation was picked up by the courtside microphones and itâs safe to say it didnât shower Kyrgios in glory.\n\nHe said: âMate, are you OK? Thereâs music playing in the crowd while we are playing. Iâve told you seven times. Am I hearing things? Am I hearing things? Mate, itâs a circus.â\n\nBerdych then served out for a two-set lead as Kyrgios continued to moan as he sat down on his courtside chair, muttering: âItâs a f****** joke.â\n\nKyrgios went on to lose the match 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 and criticise the chair umpire further â saying âyouâre a terrible refereeâ as he walked off the court.\n\nHe complained about the music, swore excessively, fought with the chair umpire and threw his racket across the court during his loss to Tomas Berdych\n\nThrowing a tantrum over the colour of his towel\n\nYou never quite know which Kyrgios will be turning up on court. He can either be fun and playful or aggressive and short tempered. Unfortunately for the staff at the 2019 Rogers Cup, it was the latter.\n\nDuring his clash with Kyle Edmund, Kyrgios demanded that he was given a white towel, as opposed to a tournament-branded one. (Talk about being a diva!)\n\nThe 26-year-old refused to take part in the match until he was presented with a pristine new towel and caused quite the fuss on court while he waited.\n\nâI just want to know why it took you so long to get a white towel,â Kyrgios asked officials. âTook you 20 minutes for this one. 20 minutes. Oh, you brought me two. Thanks.â\n\nDuring his clash with Kyle Edmund, Kyrgios demanded that he was given a white towel\n\nCaught out partying prior to his Wimbledon 2019 exit\n\nKyrgios has always been known for his controversial antics on court, but this incident questioned his decision-making off the court.\n\nThe Australian bad boy of tennis was seen at the Dog & Fox Pub in Wimbledon until around 11pm the night before his second-round match with Rafael Nadal in 2019.\n\nKyrgios was seen socialising with friends and chatting to girls at the pub on the Wednesday evening, according to sports commentator Miguel Seabra.\n\nHe wrote: âI just had a toast with Nick Kyrgios at the Dog & Fox. He is completely relaxed, laughing with friends, chatting with girls, drinking.\n\nâQuite an unorthodox preparation for tomorrowâs blockbuster, uh? I like it.â\n\nIt comes a no surprise that Kyrgios crashed out of the tournament. However, instead of reflecting on his defeatâ¦the Australian bad-boy headed straight back to the pub to wash away his misery.\n\nDemanding a beer on court at the 2017 French Open\n\nKyrgios crashed out of the 2017 French Open in spectacular form, smashing two racquets and asking for a beer mid-match.\n\nThe Australian star bombed out of the seasonâs second Grand slam in Paris with a 5-7 6-4 6-1 6-2 second-round loss to South African star Kevin Anderson.\n\nKyrgios was visibly frustrated during the match and even asked a spectator to get him a beer after losing serve in the fourth set.\n\nâGet me a beer now. Honest to God, get me one now,â he said. A spectator responded: âYouâre kidding.â Kyrgios said: âI donât think so.â\n\nKyrgios entered the tournament under a fitness cloud â and hip and shoulder niggles undoubtedly contributed to his demise as the then-22-year-old coughed up an uncharacteristic nine double-faults in the four-set defeat.\n\nAdditionally, Kyrgios had just lost his Grandpa â making it somewhat of an emotional torment for more reasons than one.\n\nKyrgios crashed out of the 2017 French Open in spectacular form after smashing two rackets\n\nThe âbad-boyâ also asked a spectator to get him a beer after losing serve in the fourth set\n\nBlaming his defeat on a âhot chickâ in the stands\n\nKyrgios is known for interacting with the crowd while on court. However, it never normally impacts his performance.\n\nThe Australian bad-boy joked he had lost concentration during his 2019 Laver Cup defeat by Rodger Federer because he had spotted a âreally hot chick in the crowdâ.\n\nThe controversial 26-year-old was unable to hold off a rousing comeback from the Swiss great in Geneva, eventually being overcome 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 10-7 after one hour and 51 minutes.\n\nKyrgios gave an amusing post-match interview after he had informed his team of the reason behind his poor performance.\n\nHe could be heard saying: âI lost concentration, I saw a really hot chick in the crowd. Like, Iâm being genuinely honest â Iâd marry her right now. Right now.â\n\nKyrgios joked he had lost concentration as he had spotted a âreally hot chick in the crowdâ\n\nKyrgios could be heard explaining the reason behind his poor patch to his team on the bench\n\nThrowing a chair at the Italian Open in 2019\n\nThe day after giving an explosive interview in which he admitted he âcanât standâ the âcringeworthyâ Novak Djokovic, Kyrgios was guilty of one of his worst meltdownâs to date.\n\nHe hurled a chair onto the court at the 2019 Italian Open and kicked a bottle during an extraordinary outburst. His actions overshadowed iconic moments such as Jo Konta claiming back-to-back victories over Venus Williams and Sloane Stephens to reach the quarter finals.\n\nKyrgios was issued with a fine of Â£17,000 after losing the plot against Norwayâs Casper Ruud when he was given a game penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nPlaying on a noisy outside court at the Foro Italico, Kyrgios was triggered by the crowd and became involved in an exchange with officials after being made to forfeit a game to go 2-1 down in the decider.\n\nHaving angrily hurled his racket to the floor he threw the fold-up chair onto the playing surface and then went into an expletive-filled rant, shouting at the chair: âI am giving 100 per cent to deal with f****** idiots like him, Iâm done. Iâm f****** done. Iâm f****** done with it. I donât give a f***.â\n\nHe then put his bag over his shoulder and walked off court of his own accord, but was officially defaulted from the match.\n\nKyrgios lost his temper at the 2019 Italian Open, smashing his racket and kicking a water bottle\n\nKyrgios then picked up a seat from courtside and hurled that into the centre of the court\n\nTelling Stan Wawrinka a friend âbanged his girlfriendâ\n\nKyrgios got himself into hot water once again after brutally trash-talking his Swiss opponent, Stan Wawrinka, during a second-round clash at the 2015 Montreal Masters.\n\nIn a remark picked up by a courtside microphone, Kyrgios told third-seeded Wawrinka that a teenage Australian player, Thanasi Kokkinakis, slept with his girlfriend.\n\nâKokkinakis banged your girlfriend,â he said, midway through the second set. âSorry to tell you that, mateâ.\n\nKyrgios was referring to his Davis Cup team-mate Kokkinakis, while Wawrinka was romantically linked with Donna Vekic.\n\nWawrinka, who was the reigning Australian and French Open champion, was not happy with Kyrgios and took to Twitter after the match to condemn his actions.\n\nHe said: âSo disappointing to see a fellow athlete and colleague be so disrespectful in a way could never even imagine. To [stoop] so low is not only unacceptable but also beyond beliefâ.\n\nAs a result of his questionable court-etiquette, Kyrgios was fined Â£10,000 and handed a 28-day suspended sentence.\n\nAbusing hecklers and calling out Ben Stiller\n\nKyrgios lost to the 2022 Australian Open champion Nadal in a three-set thriller at Indian Wells. He was beaten 7-6 (7-0), 5-7, 6-4 to end an extraordinary tournament.\n\nHowever, it was Kyrgiosâ tantrum that caught everyoneâs attention. Kyrgiosâ most memorable outburst of the match came when he singled out Ben Stiller â who was watching from the stands with wife Christine Taylor â to deal with a heckler.\n\nThe extraordinary exchange went like this:\n\nKyrgios: âAre you good at tennis?â\n\nHeckler: âNo.â\n\nKyrgios: âExactly, so donât tell me how to play. [Pointing at Stiller and his wife who were sitting nearby] Do I tell him how to act? No.â\n\nKyrgios stopped his service to address a heckler in the stands during the third and final set at Indian Wells\n\nActor Ben Still and wife Christine Taylor found the funny side of Kyrgiosâ antics after being drawn into his tirade at a heckler in the crowd\n\nDropping F-bomb after beating Ruud at Indian Wells\n\nKyrgios has had a long-standing rivalry with Casper Ruud â having previously defaulted from the the Italian Open in 2019 for throwing a chair onto the court in the final set of their clash.\n\nKyrgios ensured that he got the last laugh over Ruud in March 2022 â defeating the 23-year-old 6-4 ,6-4 in a ruthless performance to advance in California.\n\nThe Australian went on to taunt his opponent after emerging victorious. He was filmed saying: âI hear no talking now. I hear no talking now. None. F***ing none.â\n\nHowever, Kyrgios later took to Instagram to apologise for his comments â admitting that emotions got the better of him during the match.\n\nKyrgios launched the F-bomb at old rival Casper Ruud after his win earlier this month\n\nKyrgios looked down the camera lens and said âI hear no talking nowâ after his superb victory\n\nOutburst at the chair umpire Fergus Murphy in 2019\n\nHe just canât help himself can he? Kyrgios was fined Â£98,904 for smashing two racquets and calling the chair umpire a âf**king tool at the Cincinnati Masters in 2019.\n\nThe ATP announced the penalties on the day after the tennis bad-boy berated chair umpire Fergus Murphy during a straight sets loss to Karen Khachanov.\n\nThe ATP listed a breakdown of eight fines ranging from Â£2,282 to Â£15,216 each for violations such as unsportsmanlike conduct, verbal abuse and audible obscenity.\n\nKyrgios (right) was fined Â£98,904 for smashing two racquets and calling the chair umpire (left) a âf**king tool at the Cincinnati Masters in 2019\n\nMimicking a lewd sex act at Queenâs, 2018\n\nYou think Kyrgios would know by now that cameras are everywhere at these sort of events!\n\nThe 26-year-old was caught mimicking a crude sex act with a water bottle during a break in games at the Marin Cilic at Queenâs.\n\nThe live footage of what he thought was a private moment between himself and his playerâs box was broadcast to homes across the world.\n\nKyrgios held his drink bottle towards his groin and appeared to pretend to masturbate.\n\nAfter playing around with his drink bottle he then finished off by spraying water onto the ground and taking a sip before sharing a cheeky grin. He was fined Â£13,000.\n\nEarlier in the week he shouted out âf***â during his match against Kyle Edmund, forcing BBC commentary to apologise for the foul language.\n\nHis response when it was raised afterwards? âFine. I donât careâ.\n\nKyrgios was caught on live TV mimicking a lewd sex act with a water bottle at Queenâs\n\nRefusing to try at Shanghai, 2016\n\nAccusations of tanking have followed Kyrgios throughout his career. He was booed at Wimbledon in 2015 for a lack of effort in returning serves from Richard Gasquet.\n\nFans hoped their furious reaction would teach Kyrgios a lesson, but it seemed to do little good as he did not return shots and served without effort at the Shanghai Masters just one year later.\n\nAt one point he patted a serve over the net and at another he was walking off court before his opponent, Mischa Zverev, had returned the ball.\n\nWhen told to act professionally by umpire Ali Nili after swearing, he responded: âCan you call time so I can finish this match and go home?â.\n\nKyrgios was issued with a three-month ban and a Â£20,500 fine but he made no apologies for his conduct after the match, even taking aim at the fans.\n\nâI donât owe them [the fans] anything. Itâs my choice. If you donât like it, I didnât ask you to come watch. Just leave. You want to buy a ticket? Come watch me.\n\nâYou know Iâm unpredictable. Itâs your choice. I donât owe you anything. Doesnât affect how I sleep at night.â\n\nAgainst Mischa Zverev in Shanghai in 2016 Kyrgios refused to serve properly or return shots\n\nHe was even seen walking off the court before Zverev had returned his serve to win the point\n\nTaking a phone call on court at Australian Open, 2016\n\nBefore a mixed doubles match in Melbourne five years ago Kyrgios answered a phone call as he sat down with partner Ajla Tomljanovic.\n\nHe could have let it go to voicemail. He could have switched it off. He could have left it in the locker room. But no, he decided to answer it on court.\n\nFor once Kyrgios escaped punishment, but eyebrows were still raised after this indiscretion, with many questioning his professionalism and commitment to the sport.\n\nOfficials investigated the incident, which had left Tomljanovic thoroughly bemused, but he avoided sanction because it was pre-match.\n\nâSome of my friends called me,â Kyrgios said. When asked if it was something important, he replied: âKind of, not reallyâ.\n\nKyrgios took a phone call from a friend before a mixed doubles match in Melbourne in 2016\n\nPelting a tennis racket at ball boy\n\nKyrgiosâ gags are usually harmless but he came extremely close to causing some serious damage when he lost his temper at Indian Wells in March 2022.\n\nKyrgios was forced to apologies to the ball boy he nearly hit with a tennis racket after his quarterfinal defeat to Rafa Nadal. The Aussie star fell 7-6 (7-0), 5-7, 6-4 and lost his temper immediately after the match.\n\nHe launched his racket at the wall of the arena â leaving ball boy Tei Park ducking for cover. Overnight, Kyrgios sheepishly took to Instagram to find out the identity of the ball boy and apologise.\n\nSharing a post to his story, Kyrgios said: âI just want to apologise to that ball kid at the end of the match.\n\nâIt was a complete accident and was frustrated at the end of the match. My racket took a crazy bounce and was never my intention. If anyone knows who that ball kid is, send me a message and I will send a racket to him. Iâm glad heâs OK!â\n\nKyrgios was forced to apologies to the ball boy he nearly hit with a tennis racket after his quarter-final defeat to Rafa Nadal at Indian Wells 2022\n\nPurposefully aims a ball at Rafael Nadal\n\nKyrgios confessed he was aiming to hit Nadal with the ball during their second-round match at Wimbledon in 2019. The Australian even refused to apologise for deliberately thrashing a forehand directly at his opponent in their ill-tempered grudge match at Wimbledon.\n\nThe tennis bad-boy admitted he was âgoing for himâ and told a press conference after his four set defeat: âI wanted to hit him square in the chest.â\n\nHe said: âI donât care. Why would I apologise? I mean, the dude has got how many slams, how much money in the bank account? I think he can take a ball to the chest. Iâm not going to apologise to him at all.â\n\nHis confession has sparked an angry backlash on social media, with fans calling for the âspoiled bratâ to be fined or âbannedâ from the sport.\n\nKyrgios said he was aiming to hit Nadal with the ball during their 2019 clash at Wimbledon\n\nThe Spaniard (furthest away) managed to stop the ball from hitting his body with his racquet\n\nIgnoring questions and chugging a Stella Artois\n\nKyrgios showcased his bizarre behaviour once again during a press conference 2019. He ignored a reporterâs question in favour of drinking a beer.\n\nKyrgios had been playing for Team World who lost to Team Europe during the Laver Cup in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nAfter the final tie between Milos Raonic and Alexander Zverev, Kyrgios attended a press conference joined by team captain and US tennis legend John McEnroe.\n\nKyrgios was angry about a question regarding his loss to Roger Federer during the competition and opted to drink he beer rather than answer.\n\nHowever, when promoted, he said: âProbably just had to do with something that I was playing someone thatâs probably the best to ever play the sport.\n\nâI donât think it was a lack of shot selection or lack of discipline or lack of power or lack of anything. I think the guy I was playing was just pretty good. Donât you think so? Yeah. Itâs a pretty bad question, to be honest.â\n\nHe decided to chug a beer over answering a reporterâs question during a press conference\n\nBrands Bernard Tomic âdumbâ and âirrelevantâ in long-running feud â as rival challenges him to a boxing match\n\nLast month Kyrgios poured cold water on a potential boxing bout with arch rival Bernard Tomic, insisting he has âbigger fish to fryâ than taking on the âdead brokeâ World No 417.\n\nThe Australian tennis duo have been embroiled in a war of words for years and their feud escalated even further last month after Kyrgios labelled Tomic âthe most hated athlete in Australiaâ.\n\nTomic, 29, responded by challenging Kyrgios, 27, to a one-off battle on the grass court, with each player stumping up $1million in a winner-takes-all clash.\n\nThe 29-year-old then changed the arena of their battle to the boxing ring, demanding that they âsort this out as menâ.\n\nYet Kyrgios has distanced himself from a boxing debut, with the Canberra-born star expressing sympathy for Tomic, who in 2016 reached a career-high ranking of No 17.\n\nâHeâs not very good anymore, heâs not relevant anymore, and heâs obviously got money issues,â Kyrgios told the Courier Mail.\n\nâFor someone who actually tried to stand up for him before and tried to help him out, like my familyâs helped him out before, I paid for his flights back home from Shanghai because he had no money. So for him to come out and attack is extremely disrespectful I think.\n\nâWhen heâs challenging me for boxing matches â like first of all, I donât know whoâs going to put up $1 million for him because heâs dead broke. Second of all, I have bigger fish to fry at the moment. Iâm trying to get ready for Wimbledon. US Open. Iâve got off court contracts, tournaments still pay me to show up.\n\nâAnd I donât think thatâs happening for him at the moment. But maybe one day, I would love to challenge him in there. I feel like Iâve got him on fitness.â\n\nTomic has rubbished Kyrgiosâ claims.\n\nncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vNopqkZZuuv6i1zqxkoqtdqb%2BmrdOem2asn2Kwqa3MqZigppVisaa4yK%2Bcq52UYq%2B6ecyom56ko2KutXnLqKWdp55isK3BwWaYn6yVp3q4tcybo56cn6N6p7XNmqNmpJ%2BowHA%3D"
