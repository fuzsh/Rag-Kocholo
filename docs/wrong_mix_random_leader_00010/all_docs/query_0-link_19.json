        "text": "Australia and Switzerland were tied at one rubber apiece after the opening round of singles matches in their Davis Cup World Group first-round match in Geneva overnight.\n\nPeter Luczak rode out a case of early-match nerves as he steadied for a 1-6, 6-3, 6-0, 6-3 win over debutant Michael Lammer, before Stanislas Wawrinka levelled for the home team with a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) over Chris Guccione.\n\nLuczak, ranked 117 but the last home player standing in the third round of the Australian Open, said that he steadied after the early flush of trouble against Lammer, the world number 211 who stormed away in the early stages.\n\n\"I had a nervous start and Lammer got off a flyer,\" admitted the Warsaw-born player.\n\n\"He wasn't missing much, but it would have been hard for him to keep that standard over five sets.\n\n\"I took confidence from a close win I had over him before (in 2004).\"\n\nLuczak produced 13 winners and 10 unforced errors along with six aces in his debut, running off nine straight games to earn a two-sets-to-one lead.\n\nThe Australian broke twice in the fourth set to close out the victory for the visitors, who are without Lleyton Hewitt (ankle injury).\n\nLuczak said he also received valuable advice from the tight-knit Aussie bench.\n\n\"(Coach) Todd (Woodbridge) said I'd be nervous, but he said that you have to believe in yourself.. if you get nervous, let it happen and it will get better,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian said that a change of tactic - standing close to the net - \"put me into a more aggressive state of mind. His game went down, it was hard to keep that level up. He started to hit a few loose shots, he played a decent match.\"\n\nAustralia, 28-times winners of the Davis Cup, hold a 3-0 record against the Swiss, who are without the resting Roger Federer."
