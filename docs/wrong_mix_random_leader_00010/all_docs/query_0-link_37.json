        "text": "Grigor Dimitrov broke the Spanish hegemony in the AMT in 2014 by becoming the first champion on hard surface in Acapulco.\n\nMexico City, January 23rd, 2023.- After eight titles for the Spaniards in a 10 year spam period and six of them being consecutive, this 22-year-old arrived to put a stop to the sweeping winning streak of David Ferrer, Rafael Nadal and Nicolás Almagro, to proudly wave the colors of the Bulgarian flag in the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC, celebrating one of its biggest changes, switching from clay to hard court, under the slogan ‘A new court for a new era’.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov, then world No. 22, could not have dreamed of a better debut in Acapulco. Reaching the final, where he faced South Africa’s Kevin Anderson, surprising everyone leaving the current Olympic champion and Grand Slam winner Andy Murray on the way, but perhaps it was the atmosphere that was his best ally.\n\n“My first memory of Acapulco is from the first time I played there and I had an amazing time with the people and everyone who made the tournament. It was very special in the sense that I was playing every match at 10 o’clock at night and the fans were attending and were present on every point played. Without a doubt my memories take me to the atmosphere and I will never forget that I had one of my craziest points, craziest parties, basically crazy everything over there, it’s very different and I really appreciate that as a player. What a beautiful place! Stated for the tournament.\n\nThat final against Anderson had all the ingredients to be remembered as a historic one, as the drama was not lacking in a 7-6(1), 3-6, 7-6(5) score for almost 3 hours (two hours and 58 minutes) of play. It was the second title in Dimitrov’s career, but his first ATP 500. He now totals eight in total, among which he boasts having conquered the ATP Finals in 2017, the same year in which he reached his highest ranking as No. 3 in the world.\n\nAt almost the same age as the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC, Dimitrov reflects on the special anniversary and reveals the details that make the tournament so special “It means a lot. These days when we see how everything is done, it’s quite challenging, but reaching 30 years is reaching an incredible goal, with such good emotions all around. It gives me pleasure to know that the tournament has improved and for a good reason it always has amazing players.”\n\n“What I like most about the destination is that it was very accessible for us and at the same time it was great to be close to the water. Also that the matches began much later in the day really helped a lot, you enjoy everything in general, it’s beautiful and that makes it easy for the players to enjoy and incorporate everything they have for their game.”\n\nFinally, Grigor Dimitrov can’t forget the fans, the most special ingredient he´s had in each of his visits to Mexico “They have been tremendous over the years, it´s been a privilege and an honor to be there and support them in giving everything every time. I’m very pleased that I know I can count on them, throughout the night they are so active and show so much, it’s amazing!” concluded the now 31-year-old world No. 28.\n\n• David Ferrer was the second player in tournament history to lift the Silver Gourd in four ocations, something only Thomas Muster and Rafael Nadal had achieved.\n\nMexico City, January 16th, 2023.- The Spanish flag has waved the most times at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC, thanks in part to David Ferrer. The player from Jávea Spain found in Acapulco one of his favorite playing courts to show one of his best performance and win four of his 27 titles.\n\nFerrer was the second player to win the Silver Gourd in three consecutive editions, after Thomas Muster’s four in a row (1993-1996). From 2010 to 2012, David was the best in Acapulco; winner of main draws that brought together some of the best players in Spain and on clay, such as Fernando Verdasco, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Nicolás Almagro, as well as other outstanding players like Fernando González, Stanislas Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori, among others.\n\nIn his quest for the fourth title, Ferrer faced non other than Rafael Nadal in the 2013 final, where he lost in straight sets. However, David found a way to overcome that result two years later in the 2015 edition, when he won over Kei Nishikori in the title match to definitively enter the tournament’s history books as one of the most successful players to play the tournament.\n\nDespite the Spaniard’s record in Acapulco, Ferrer is very clear about one of his main memories at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC. “I remember a special match against Guga Kuerten on center court, as everyone cheering for Guga, something logical, but it was and is a very close tournament. There´s a great atmosphere, tennis people are going to have a good time, enjoy the sport and have a great week for the most part,” commented David.\n\nFerrer also highlights the evolution of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC in terms of playing surface, something that according to David helped the tournament to remain one of the best. “I remember when it was clay and then it evolved to fast court. On clay the best were already going and then when it became fast court they have come even better. My most sincere congratulations to the tournament director and organization, who has a lot to do with the fact that it has been 30 years in the making,” said the Spaniard.\n\nFor the four-time champion, it´s difficult to choose what he likes most about Acapulco. “The atmosphere, the fact that it’s summer, that it’s in a place where we have great facilities and everything is close by. Honestly, I can’t say just one thing about the facilities, the food,” said David, who now also identifies himself as a fan of the tournament.\n\nFinally, Ferrer invites the public to experience everything the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC has to offer. “Let them go to see one of the best tournaments in the world without a doubt. Enjoy because we have the best players who love to go, live it, play it and it´s part of the history of Acapulco, which is a unique experience, not only to see the best tennis players, but to live it from the outside, the atmosphere there, it´s a day that I would be lovely to go with my children.\n\nThe Spaniard conquered Acapulco in 2008 and 2009 to enter the tournament’s book of records as one of the few two-time champions.\n\nMexico City, December 9th, 2022.- It took 13 years for Acapulco´s audience to see a tennis player successfully defend his crown at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC. Nicolás Almagro, who won his first Silver Gourd in 2008, becoming one of the few two-time champions of the event the following year.\n\nAlmagro knew what it was like to be a champion in Acapulco for the first time very far away from home. That 2008 title was the first he won in a place other than Spain and he managed to win after excelling in a main draw that had players of Carlos Moya´s stature, winner in 2002 and 2004, and Argentine David Nalbandian, whom Nicolás defeated in that year’s final.\n\nThe Spaniard’s first memory, strangely enough was not being in the competition nor the names against whom he would compete, it was the venue of the event. “My first memory of Acapulco is when I arrived there and seeing the resort it was so impressive, seeing the sea so close and thinking that in such an incredible place a tennis tournament was going to be held and that was on itself impressive,” he commented.\n\nAfter becoming champion in 2008, Almagro repeated the feat the following season. Perhaps in 2009 he didn´t have as complicated journey as in the previous year, but he did have some memorable matches, such as that second round match against Potito Starace, whom he defeated 7-6, 6-7, 6-3.\n\nEventually, “Nico” (short for Nicolás) sealed his two-time chanpionship in Acapulco after defeating Gael Monfils in the final after a double 6-4. He then entered the tournaments history books as one of the few tennis players to defend his crown on the beaches of Guerrero and the first to do so in 13 years, the last having been Thomas Muster with his four-time championship in 1996.\n\nAlmagro is a man of traditions, so for him the most special thing about the tournament is one of the most classic celebrations of the event. “The most beautiful part of the tournament is when the all white party is celebrated, all the players come in together, that seemed something unique to me, so impressive, to be able to share the beauty of a place like Acapulco´s beaches (state of Guerrero) with all the players dressed in white and enjoying a exquisite gastronomy”, expressed the Spaniard.\n\nAfter recalling Raul Zurutuza’s key support for Almagro on continuing choosing Acapulco as one of his tour destinations, Nicolás highlighted the energy of the organization and all the people involved in the tournament.\n\n“For a tournament to be 30 years old means that things have been done well for a very long time. To maintain that energy for so many years and transmit it to players and the circuit means that the whole team behind the tournament is impressive, treating people with respect and provide us everything we need to be happy and be able to compete at a very high level,” he recalled.\n\nAlmagro participated in 9 editions of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC throughout his career. Recalling his visits to Acapulco, keeping a fond memory of the Mexican fans.\n\n“For me the Mexican public was always special, they always transmitted me a lot of respect, very good vibes all the time supporting me from the first day. The stands were always lively enough for us to feel the warmth and support, they tucked us in during the difficult moments. They transmit to me that they understand tennis, that they know what they are doing, and above all a very respectful public, always supporting the player and above all that likes the show up to the matches and show their support at all times”, concluded Nicolás.\n\nNicolás Almagro said goodbye on a professional level in 2019 with 13 titles under his wing. In addition to the two-time championships in Acapulco, he managed to reach another final in 2011, which he lost to his compatriot David Ferrer. One thing is for sure: the player from Murcia has secured his place as one of the legends of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC.\n\nHorna won the Acapulco in 2006 coming from the qualifiers\n\nMexico City, December 12th, 2022.- Peruvian Luis Horna lived a dream week in Acapulco during the 2006 edition when he surprisingly and against all odds won the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC.\n\nThe move to Acapulco after its beginning in Mexico City brought the tournament a series of champions including Brazil’s Gustavo Kuerten (2001), Argentina’s Juan Ignacio Chela (200) and Agustin Calleri (2003) and Spain’s Carlos Moya (2002 and 2004) and a young Rafael Nadal (2005), who were joined by Horna.\n\nAnd although the Peruvian, born in the city capital, Lima in 1980, arrived at the tournament with many expectations, being to enter the main draw, a goal he achieved puttingt him on his way to the title.\n\n“For me the best memories of my career happened in Acapulco,” Horna stated to the organization.\n\nCommenting that during the tournament “it was the first time I had passed the qualy of an ATP tournament and at the same time winning my first ATP tournament”.\n\n“I remember the atmosphere and the affection of the fans and of Raúl Zurutuza, (tournament director) who received all the players in the best possible way and made us feel at home, that’s why the Acapulco tournament for me has always meant the best.”\n\nIn the final, Horna won 7-6, 6-4 against Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela, champion in 2000 and also who was looking for his second title in México. Almost a year after Acapulco, in February 2007, Horna won the Viña del Mar Open with a score of 7-5, 6-3 overcoming Chile’s Nicolás Massú.\n\nThose two singles titles were the only ones he won in his career, in which he also won six doubles titles, including a Grand Slam in 2008 winning at Roland Garros teamming with Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas.\n\nSpeaking about the 30th anniversary of the tournament, Horna said that the fact that a tennis tournament can have so much continuity and remain in tiimeless “means that it´s a successful one and what the tournament (in Acapulco) has achieved through the years is to be able to bring together the best players of the circuit and generate an incredible environment for them”.\n\n“Lucho”, as Horna was known (nickname), pointed out that Acapulco is the best destination to play tennis, stating, “I got to play in the old facilities right next to the hotel, it was fantastic since you could easily walk to practice and matches, we had the hotel nexto to the sea and it was really the perfect place to play in”, he stated.\n\nHe also recalled something that used to happen at the end of the tournament, where the players who had advanced in the competition, stating “we (the players) stayed several days to enjoy the beach, that paradisiacal place and the Mexican culture, the truth is that Acapulco has that charm and always made us feel very good”.\n\nHorna, who became a professional in 1998, remained for 11 years in the ATP Tour, due to his injuries he retired in 2009.\n\nThe former Czech player who reached No. 5 in the world, actually won the 6th edition of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel.\n\nMexico City, December 2nd, 2022.- Going back to 1998, when the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC was still played in the country’s capital. Even though Thomas Muster is remembered as one of the greatest stars in the first stages of the tournament after his four consecutive titles, his winning streak as we remember came to an end at the hands of Francisco Clavet and for the sixth edition it was the turn of another European to shine.\n\nHis name is Jiri Novak, a 23-year-old Czech with an impressive height of 1.91 meters (6.3 feet) and with his two-handed backhand began to reap victories in the ATP tour until he won his second title in Mexico City after defeating the Belgian Xavier Malisse 6-3, 6-3.\n\nHis first memory of the Mexican Open was playing at a very high altitude (2,240 meters above sea level), but also has other memories of the tournament when it changed the venue to Acapulco, where he also competed.\n\n“I like the fact that for Europeans, Mexico is a bit of an exotic country. I played twice in Mexico City with a great altitude and for the third year the Mexican Open was held in Acapulco, a great place on the beach. I remember the amazing weather, a beautiful hotel and great facilities.”\n\nNovak won seven titles in total during his 14-year professional career. He´s currently 47 years old and lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\nFrom the confort of his home, he reveals, what for him has been key for the AMT to flourish for three decades.\n\n“For the tournament to turn 30 means that it lives surrounded by a great atmosphere and has an outstanding organization, the sponsors have always supported the tournament, but more than anything it´s because of the fans. I remember that every time I went, there were many spectators who love the sport. It must mean a lot for the whole tournament,” he said.\n\nFinally, Novak, who was a doubles finalist at Wimbledon in 2001 and the US Open 2002, sent a message to the Mexican fans who at some point showed their support.\n\n“I wish that they stay attentive to the tournament in the future and I believe that if they are going to the matches, the tournament, it´s because of them and that´s why the tournament may linger and will continue to do so for many years to come,” stated Novak, who at one point in his career reached No. 5 in the world.\n\n– Clavet won the title in 1997 after playing three semifinals against Austrian Thomas Muster.\n\nMexico City, November the 25th – Before Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer each conquered four titles at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel, and Carlos Moya and Nicolás Almagro each won two, his compatriot Francisco Clavet González, also known as “Pato” Clavet, was then held accountable of uncovering titles for Spain, winning the fifth edition of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in 1997.\n\nClavet, born in Aranjuez, Madrid, in 1968, had to wait patiently while Austrian Thomas Muster won four titles in a row, between 1993 and 1996. At that time, the tournament was played at 2,240 meters above sea level in Mexico City, the venue where he finally managed to win the trophy after several attempts. Although his memories of that title are happy, his arrival in the country´s capital in those years was not very pleasant for him, reaching No. 18 in the ATP ranking in July 1992.\n\n“The first memory I have of the tournament is actually not in Acapulco, but in Mexico City, which was where the tournament was originally organized, and I have to admit that, to tell the truth, it was not very positive,” Clavet told the tournament’s website. He explained that the altitude of the city, the ‘jetlag’ and the capital’s pollution, were factors that played against him, swearing he would not return to the tournament.\n\n“Due to the pollution the first day we went to train, the altitude and the trip I got a huge downfall, and I vowed I would never play again. Obviously I had to eat my words,” he recalled with sympathy.\n\nHe pointed out that in his several visits to Mexico he played three semifinals in a row against Muster “and the fourth year that he did not play, after some luck and the great joy of winning the tournament”, beating Juan Albert Viloca (Spain) in the final. Then, when the tournament moved to Acapulco, Clavet said that what left a great impression on him was the hotel and sports complex where it was held.\n\n“I already felt much more comfortable and relaxed than in any other tournament. The environment and the people made me feel happy and positive when I played,” said Clavet, who played professionally from 1988 to 2003. “It was really a tournament where I always felt very comfortable playing, very loved by the people, and in an incomparable setting. You can’t ask for more,” he said.\n\nRegarding the 30 years history of the tournament, of which he was part of, Clavet said that they indicate “that it´s a tournament of great prestige, which enchants players and spectators, and above all that, not only have they done things very well, but they have been improving every year to at the Top of the ATP tournaments”.\n\nTo the Mexican fans, the Spaniard described them as “great tennis connoisseurs who enjoy the tournament with passion”, and also thanked them “from the bottom of my heart for the affection with which they have always welcomed me, and that they continue coming, enjoying and taking care of the tournament they have, because it´s a jewel”.\n\nIn his professional career, which lasted from 1988 to 2003, Clavet won eight singles titles and reached the semifinals of the Indian Wells Masters 1000 in 1992 and the Miami Masters in 1999. In 2003, his retirement year, he started coaching and liked to visit Acapulco and play the Abierto Mexicano Telcel alongside players such as Feliciano López, Thomaz Bellucci, Alejandro Falla and lastly Santiago Giraldo.\n\nAcapulco has a special place in Juan Ignacio Chela’s heart.\n\nThe Argentinean won the title in two ocations and was ranked number 15 in the world in 2004.\n\nMexico City , Nov the 15th: For the Argentinean, the city of Acapulco means his first title as a professional and his entry into the Top-100 in 2000, memories that make the Mexican tournament have a special place in the heart of the now coach and television presenter.\n\nIn that year, the move from the altitude of Mexico City, 2,240 meters (above sea level) to sea level of the Abierto Mexicano represented a chance to play “like at home” for Latin American tennis players, including Argentineans\n\nWith clay as the main playing surface, the specialists in those conditions were the Spaniards and the Argentines, Chela among them, although at that time he was not among the favorites since he was 130th in the world, but the possibility existed and he fought for it.\n\n“My first memory of the Mexican Open is from the year 2000 which was the first time I went to play it and I have a great memory for a lifetime, because I went to play the quali, achieved the qualification and ended up winning the tournament,” Chela told the tournament’s oficial webpage.\n\nHe recalled the points obtained for the first time and winning were he got into the Top-100.\n\n“I finished I think in 73rd place more or less and that’s why I always have it present in my memories and very much keep in my heart, because it was my first title and then came another final and another title (in 2007) and that’s why it’s one of my favorite tournaments, no doubt,” said the Argentine almost 10 years after his retirement, which took place on December 3, 2012.\n\nChela, now 43 years old, was one of the constants in Acapulco and one of the main entertainers since his relationship with the fans was always great and he remembers them with sympathy due to his last name, Chela.\n\n“They supported me a lot because my last name is Chela and in Mexico the word is slang or short for beer that way, so many were amused by that and cheered me on,” he said.\n\nPrecisely that relationship is what the Argentinean misses and he also misses playing in Mexico “I hope the fans keep going to the tournament and keep supporting tennis, which is an incredible sport, because with their support they make it more beautiful”.\n\nAbout what he liked most about the tournament, the man born in Ciudad Evita, Argentina, recalled that “the matches always started late” and the players during the day “could enjoy all the facilities, the beach, the pools, everything the destination has to offer, which is always impressive and spectacular”.\n\nLater, she recalled, “when it was time to compete, there was an atmosphere that has nothing to envy the biggest tournaments in the world because there are always a lot of people and they love tennis and always go to support all the players, that makes you want to compete and play in Acapulco”.\n\nChela, who in 2004 reached his best ranking position by reaching 15th place in the world, congratulated the organizers of the Acapulco tournament.\n\n“That a tennis tournament celebrates 30 years shows that it´s a great event and the professionalism and success it has is because of all the people who work behind it and because of how well things are done,” he said.\n\nThe Argentinean, who won 2 ATP 500 titles, 4 ATP 250, and 9 ATP Challengers in his career, said that among the Argentinean players and some on the tour “we always put Acapulco as a priority in our calendar, for the atmosphere of the tournament, for the place, the facilities, the organization and for how good you feel every time you go there, so without a doubt it´s one of the best tournaments in its category (Open 500) of the year”.\n\nThe prize pool of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel has evolved over its 30 years, increasing its value to more than $2 million USD.\n\nMexico City, November the 10th – Prize money is the mainstay of the ATP and WTA Tour tennis tournaments, as it can be translated into earnings for the players who, depending on which round they reach in each competition, receive some sort of payment.\n\nThroughout its 30 years, the Abierto Mexicano Telcel has been able to boost an important economic leap thanks to its evolution in category, as well as the support of its different sponsors.\n\nIn its early stages, distributing only $300,000 USD in 1993, this year it stood out with a prize pool of $1,832,890 USD, where champion, Rafael Nadal, was awarded $314,455 USD, while tennis players in the first round received $13,090 USD.\n\nIn 1993 the tournament debuted in the Mexican capital as the first ATP in Latin America and in then World Series category, the next year it increased its financial commitment to $325,000 USD. A year later, another five thousand USD were added, an amount that was maintained until 1997, since in 1998 with the arrival of Grupo Pegaso into management, the prize pool was increased to $340 thousand USD.\n\nAlthough there was no edition in 1999, the AMT achieved one of its greatest monetary leaps for the 2000 edition by distributing $800 thousand USD, since it also moved up to the International Series Gold category of the ATP Tour. In addition, a women’s exhibition tournament was held, as a test for the arrival of the WTA in 2001 along with moving the tournament to Acapulco.\n\nIn that historic edition, the prize pool was also $800 thousand USD for the men’s tournament and $170 thousand USD for the women. These amounts were maintained until 2004.\n\nFor 2005 there was a reduction to $690 thousand USD for two years and for 2007 it increased again to $794 thousand USD. In 2009, when the Abierto Mexicano Telcel was upgraded once again to ATP 500 and added the WTA International Tournaments, the prize pool increased to $1,226,500 USD.\n\nIn 2010 and 2014 it was $1,350,500 USD and for 2015 it exceeded to $1,450,000 USD, with $1.2 million USD for the men’s tournament and $220,000 USD for the women’s tournament.\n\nIn 2016 the same amount was maintained and for 2017 it increased to $2,015,615 USD with $1.7 million USD for the players. In 2020 the prize pool went up once again to $2,845,000 USD, of which $372,785 USD went to the champion.
