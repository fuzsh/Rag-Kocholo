        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt’s career will end in a few weeks but he’s training for the grand finale as if he’s a spirited and hungry teenager entering his debut tournament – not his unprecedented 20th straight Australian Open. The more-intense-than-ever Hewitt has a new summer fitness program which has involved high-intensity hitting, running, swimming, boxing and strength training.\n\nHewitt’s farewell to pro tennis at age 34 is the most intriguing retirement from the sport I’ve ever witnessed. For his final battle(s) on the tennis court, Hewitt has worked perhaps harder than any tennis player ever in history – dedicated on perfecting his game and fitness for almost six hours a day, six days a week – virtually non-stop – since early November in preparation for the final professional matches of his career and life.\n\nHewitt is skipping Brisbane to play the Hopman Cup in Perth where he is assured to play at least three singles and mixed doubles matches in the round robin, then there will be an exhibition and then the Australian Open where the final chapter of Hewitt’s Hall of Fame career will be written.\n\n“In terms of endurance and durability playing professional sport at the highest level for 20 years, there wouldn’t be many athletes who could match it with Lleyton for intensity on a day-to-day basis,” fitness trainer Nathan Martin told AAP recently. “He never gets sore. He turns up every day with the same energy and commitment. His body composition and genetics – he’s just blessed.”\n\nOne can only wonder what Hewitt is aspiring to accomplish at this point. There are so any intriguing questions – Is he inspired by an extreme passionate love for the sport – or perhaps a great fear of getting bounced out early? Is the new fitness level sparking a great new confidence? How will Hewitt’s incredible fitness and dedication translate in Melbourne? Given how much energy and commitment Hewitt is channeling to his farewell how would he handle a potential failure? If Hewitt can get on a roll and force his way to the second week – could he regain the lost fire and decide to change his plans to retire and extend his career another year?\n\nThe fitness coach reveals Hewitt’s workouts: A typical training day for Hewitt begins at 10 am with a three-hour hitting session at his home in Sydney. Baseline drills always against two at the other side of the court with ATP Tour player Matt Reid, Dayne Kelly, Matthew Barton and fellow Open hopefuls James Duckworth and Jordan Thompson serving as his sparring partners. “He’ll only stop about three times for two minutes max to have a drink,” Martin said. A half-hour rest to take in “half a sandwich” and a protein shake is followed by 90 minutes of conditioning work – anything from boxing, run-swim-runs, sprints, on-court agility, weights, stair climbs or shuttle, hill and sled runs. Hewitt’s recovery session, focused on re-hydrating, nutrition and massage, can last up to an hour before he wraps up about 4.\n\nCan you just try to imagine the fury and tenacity Lleyton Hewitt will be fueled by in his final tournament? There has never been a greater warrior on a tennis court. Hewitt was born to play tennis matches and to try to figure out how to prevail in triumph. Fighting on the court is his lifeblood, his heart, his soul, his life. In a sense Hewitt will be fighting for his life. The last match will be his death as a professional player. The ultimate competitor Hewitt will literally be fighting for his tennis life. This is exactly the way Hewitt has designed it. And this is the way he has elected to and will depart pro tennis – there is a big risk here as it could be a fast fall – straight sets in the first round to a top seed like Djokovic or Nadal or Federer or Kyrgios – or hopefully he could get a favorable draw and beat a couple of nondescript journeymen. But how it all plays out and how the final dramatic moments unfold will be – in my opinion – more intriguing and fascinating than what happens in the men’s and women’s finals. Hewitt has always been a compelling player – an awesome figure who has earned gigantic respect from any player who ever played this game – from the greatest legends of tennis to all the local park players – and how this story ends could be a signature, highlight moment of one of the most illustrious careers in modern tennis history.\n\n.\n\nHewitt ready for the fight of his life\n\n<< Brilliant Hire of Moya by Raonic"
