Both are built by McLaren Special Operations division as one-off examples with extra carbon fibre and 24-karat gold plating.\n\nOne of the 375 P1s to be ever made, the MSO version omits the paint and retains the exposed carbon fibre body, held together by lio blue tinted lacquer. There are many more carbon fibre inserts, which go well with the special glossy black alloys. Of course, even the interior has more carbon fibre with the contrasting blue stitching to continue the exterior theme. However, neither of these are the highlights of this P1. As one last hurrah, it gets a 24-karat gold plated exhaust heatshield.\n\nThe 675LT for Geneva also features extra carbon fibre, with an exterior painted in ceramic grey. The carbon fibre also acts as a weight saving measure in the hard top convertible roof. Not much apart from above is different in the 675, but even this gets the gold plated heatshield.\n\nThis is the fourth year that McLaren is attending the Geneva Show. Apart from these two, the British marque will showcase the 650 GT3 racer and a still-to-be-announced member in the Sports Series family."
