        "text": "ByEurosport\n\nPublished 09/11/2004 at 07:35 GMT\n\nCarlos Moya may not ooze the consistency that took him to the world number one ranking in 1999 anymore, but the Spaniard is still a danger on all surfaces. A winner of three tour titles this season, the 28-year-old has helped his country to the Davis Cup\n\nBorn: 27 August 1976, Palma de Mallorca\n\nResidence: Geneva, Switzerland\n\nProfessional Since: 1995\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nRoger Federer (Switzerland)\n\n13/11/2004 at 06:48\n\nCareer Singles titles: 17\n\nSingles Titles in 2004: Three – Chennai, Acapulco, Rome Masters\n\nMAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD 2004\n\nAustralian Open – Did Not Play; Roland Garros – QF (lost to Guillermo Coria); Wimbledon – 4R (lost to Lleyton Hewitt); U.S. Open – 3R (lost to Olivier Rochus)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nCarlos Moya qualified for the Masters Cup in fifth place on the back of consistent performances throughout the season.\n\nThree titles came the Spaniard's way in Chennai, Acapulco and the Rome Masters from five finals (runner-up in Sydney and Buenos Aires) with quarter and semi-final displays in seven other tournaments.\n\nThe drive and determination that took Moya to the number one ranking in March 1999 may have been dimmed by injury, but the 28-year-old is still a mighty force.\n\nAn injury sustained during Spain's Davis Cup semi-final victory over France in September saw him skip Madrid and Paris Masters events.\n\nOnly a lack of match practice will prevent Moya from adding to his 56-17 season win-loss record in Houston.\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nAndy Roddick (United States)\n\n12/11/2004 at 07:00\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nLleyton Hewitt (Australia)\n\n11/11/2004 at 07:14\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nGaston Gaudio (Argentina)\n\n10/11/2004 at 07:23\n\nJoin 3M+ users on app\n\nDownload\n\nScan me\n\nRelated Topics\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"
