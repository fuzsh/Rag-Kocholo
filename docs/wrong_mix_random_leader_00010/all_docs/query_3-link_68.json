        "text": "He went to school in Bunbury and began playing tennis here before moving to Perth for training at the age of 15.\n\nHe was a regular fixture at the Bunbury Tennis Club, where local legend and club stalwart John Cartledge became his first coach.\n\nCrabb finished his own career in 2005 and began coaching in the USA, where he saw Hewitt perform at the 2011 US open.\n\nAfter the tournament, Crabb flew to the Bahamas where Hewitt resides to help him in a training week.\n\nThe first tournament he coached Hewitt in was in Atlanta, where he made a semi-final and fell to John Isner in three close sets.\n\n“I’ve learnt of a lot from being around Lleyton and it has really helped develop my coaching career,” he said.\n\n“He is so professional in everything he does and always controls everything he can.\n\n“He expects the same from everyone in his team working with him and I've found that although I'm employed to help him it also helps me being able to observe the way he goes about his business.”\n\nAlthough Hewitt may have exited Wimbledon earlier than the pair would have liked, Crabb said it was still an effort to be proud of.\n\n“It was disappointing that Lleyton didn’t go on a run and win some matches, but he can look back and know he left no stone unturned in his training and also in his match he left everything out on the court,” he said."
