        "text": "3.15pm: Federer misfires a backhand after a funny bounce then puts another into the net on break point. Believe it or not, Hewitt up 2-13.11pm: Federer gets into a rally after a 142 kph second serve, forces a rare deuce game. Double fault from Hewitt doesn't deter him from holding, 1-13.05pm: Lleyton puts his body on the line but Federer holds in the opening game of the second. 3.01pm: 'Lley-ton Hew-wit' is the chant as Rusty inches closer to the set. 202kph ace give him three set points. Federer forehand into the net on the first is all he needs.Huge but pleasant surprise as AUS take a 1-0 set lead. What a start!2.58pm: Hewitt now serving for the first set 6-5! This is a great opportunity for the Australian.2.57pm: Luczak, Kubler, Tomic, Ebden and Matosevic on their feet, 2 break points and Hewitt takes the first with a forehand winner2.55pm: Unreal serving from Hewitt sees him stay in the set at 5-5. Second serve dropping 80kph below his first serves, most above 200kph2.49pm: Ump gets some cheers as he overrules a Federer forehand as out. No Hawk-Eye, the world number 3 still holds easily 5-42.43pm: Each player holds to love, 4-3. This match living up to its hype so far2.39pm: Now that Federer and Hewitt are on court, there's hardly anyone milling about outside. I reckon this inflatable kangaroo will get a bit of a workout.2.20pm: Courtside .... Huge roar as the world No.3, Federer, steps on court. For world 199 Hewitt, the applause is even more resounding2.15pm: Everyone's on their feet as Federer and Hewitt come on court. There's a loud cheer as Federer is introduced by the MC but the loudest roar is reserved for Hewitt. There's a mild boo and some cheers for the umpire.2.10pm: 3700-strong crowd have their cameras poised, waiting hungrily for their first glimpse of Federer2.08pm: I catch up with Jenny Bradshaw and Hans Wenziker from Perth, and couple Heidi and Dani Meier from Switzerland. The Meiers are here on holiday but I suspect it may have been planned to coincide with the Davis Cup tie - especially since Heidi is wearing a T-shirt with the words \"ROGER forever our no.1\"."
