        "text": "Tennis is a sport that is rivaled by few when it comes to how diverse the field is of athletes taking part at any given time in the many tournaments taking place around the world each year.\n\nIn looking at the diversity, I decided to take on researching and developing this slideshow that will look at the top 15 players to have played or currently play under the Australian flag.\n\nI will present a snapshot (there's too many great accomplishments to list everything) of players from both the pre-Open Era as well as the Open Era. As many point out, there are differences between the two, but one thing remained the same—great tennis. I think it is only right to give credit to the pre-Open Era as it set the ground work and the Open Era has built upon that solid foundation.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot list everyone. And not mentioning someone by no means belittles their tennis accomplishments. This is simply my opinion of who I feel are the top Australian players.\n\nAs you read this piece, you can assist as I encourage you to feel free to provide comments on who you feel should have been listed or maybe someone whom you feel should not have been listed.\n\nIt's always great to have a good discussion.\n\nWell, without further delay, here are the top tennis players from Australia. They are listed in no particular order.\n\nBorn: August 9, 1938\n\nRod Laver is probably one of the most recognizable names in Australian tennis.\n\nOf course, there's the Rod Laver Arena, home to the Australian Open. However, there's also the tennis career behind his achieving such recognition.\n\nLaver was ranked No. 1 for seven consecutive years. He was the first player, male or female, to have won the Grand Slam in the Open Era.\n\nOver the course of his career, he won 11 Grand Slam singles title.\n\nLaver was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993. He is also on the prestigious list of Australia's Living Treasures.\n\nBorn: October 3, 1933\n\nNeale Fraser is the first of several all-around players. I define all-around as playing a combination of singles, doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nIn Fraser's case, though, he was a little partial. His preferences were doubles and the Davis Cup.\n\nOne very important highlight of his career was in 1959, he won the singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles at the US Nationals’ (US Open now) and successfully defended them the next year. To this day, the record still stands.\n\nFraser retired in 1963 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1984 as a Master Player.\n\nBorn: November 14, 1877\n\nImmediately, I am sure that you recognize the name Norman Brookes. If not, ask any man who has won the Australian Open single's title and you would undoubtedly get an immediate response. Why?\n\nThe beautiful prize cup is named after Mr. Brookes—the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, and rightfully so, as he was quite instrumental in establishing the Australian Open (previously known as the Australasian Championship until 1927). He actually won it as a junior in 1911.\n\nDuring his career, he won two Grand Slam men's singles titles (he was the first non-Briton to win at Wimbledon) and four Grand Slam doubles titles.\n\nBrookes served at the president of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia for 30 years.\n\nBrookes was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1977 as a master player, exactly 100 years after his birth.\n\nHe was inducted into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nBorn: September 23, 1965\n\nFor this slide, though it is on Mark Woodforde, there is unspoken recognition to his fellow Aussie tennis player and partner, Todd Woodbridge (shown in the photo above in front of Woodforde).\n\nI felt the need to mention Woodbridge as the majority of Woodforde's achievements came as a result of their partnership on the tennis court.\n\nAforementioned, Woodforde shared a long career playing doubles with Woodbridge. Because of their last names, they were referred to as the “The Woodies.”\n\n“The Woodies” won 61 doubles tournaments (Woodforde won 67 altogether). Of those 61 titles, 11 were Grand Slam doubles titles. Another highlight of his/their career was winning the gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nWoodforde retired in 2000 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 2010 (both along with doubles partner, Todd Woodbridge).\n\nBorn: May 17, 1945\n\nTony Roche's tennis career took him down two paths—player and coach.\n\nDuring his career as player, he played both singles and doubles. He won a Grand Slam singles title (he was actually runner-up five times) and 12 Grand Slam doubles titles. Interesting note, his doubles partner is none other than fellow Australian, John Newcombe, whom you will get to know later on in the slideshow.\n\nRoche played both singles and doubles. He won one Grand Slam singles title and 12 doubles. His highest ranking in singles was No. 2.\n\nAs a coach, he has worked with some of the best. His students have included Ivan Lendl, Roger Federer and fellow Aussie Lleyton Hewitt (Roche currently coaches Hewitt).\n\nRoche was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1998 (both along with doubles partner, John Newcombe).\n\nBorn: November 3, 1936\n\nRoy Emerson was one of the greats prior to the Open Era. During his tennis career, he captured 12 Grand Slam singles titles along with 16 Grand Slam doubles title.\n\nHe is the only male to have won the singles and doubles titles in four Grand Slams. Additionally, he is the first male to have won each Grand Slam at least twice and the first male to have won more than 11 Grand Slams.\n\nEmerson was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1982 and the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nHe retired in 1983.\n\nBorn: November 23, 1934\n\nLew Hoad’s tennis achievements were primarily noted during the 1950s.\n\nHoad won four Grand Slam singles titles, seven Grand Slam doubles titles and one Grand Slam mixed doubles title.\n\nAt the height of his career, he was ranked No. 1.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Hoad’s love for the game continued as he and his wife, Jenny, moved to Spain and opened and operated a tennis resort for more than 30 years. They provided an environment of tennis and relaxation to all who attended, including some of their very famous friends.\n\nHoad was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nBorn: February 24, 1981\n\nLleyton Hewitt is an active tennis player currently on tour.\n\nHis highest ranking was world No. 1(youngest male to accomplish this ranking) back in 2001 at the age of 20. He has captured two Grand Slam titles during his career (Wimbledon in 2002 and the US Open in 2001).\n\nAs a distinguished achiever in tennis, Hewitt is the youngest male to have won a Grand Slam doubles title in the Open Era. He accomplished this feat back in 2000. Additionally, he was the first teenager in ATP history to ever qualify for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup (ATP World Tour Finals).\n\nHewitt is currently ranked No. 173 and coached by fellow Australian tennis great, Tony Roche.\n\nFor those of you who stopped by for a read, I hope that you were inspired by the accomplishments of these Australian men and what they have given not only to Australian tennis but the sport of tennis as a whole.\n\nAnd as I mentioned in the opening slide, I welcome your comments and feedback.\n\nThanks to:"
