        "text": "November\n\nMurray was once again called up to represent Great Britain at the Davis Cup Final 8 in Malaga at the end of the month, where the Brits will compete to take home the title.\n\nSeptember\n\nMurray was selected to join the Lexus Great Britain Davis Cup squad at the Group Stages in Manchester, where he recorded a vital win in the Brits' tie against Switzerland. Murray took on 21-year-old Leandro Riedi with the former world No.1 prevailing 6-7(7), 6-4, 6-4.\n\nAugust\n\nMurray’s win against Max Purcell in the second round of the National Bank Open saw him reach his highest ranking since April 2018 after climbing to world No.36.\n\nMurray's became the first British player and the eighth male in the Open Era to achieve 200 Grand Slam wins following his opening round victory over Corentin Moutet at the US Open. However, the former world No.1 lost to Grigor Dimitrov in the second round 6-3, 6-4, 6-1.\n\nJuly\n\nAndy Murray defeated fellow Brit Ryan Peniston 6-3, 6-0, 6-1 in the opening round of his 15th appearance at The Championships. In the second round he lost a five-set epic to world No.5 Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6(3), 6-7(2), 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-4.\n\nJune\n\nMurray hit a new career milestone when he won the Lexus Surbiton Trophy for the first time in his career - marking his first title on the grass since his last Wimbledon triumph in 2016.\n\nThe 36-year-old beat Austria's Jurij Rodionov 6-3, 6-2 to be crowned champion and lift his second ATP Challenger title of the season.\n\nMurray made it back-to-back grass court titles at the Rothesay Open Nottingham - his 10th career grass court title. He defeated 20-year-old French star Arthur Cazaux 6-4, 6-4.\n\nMay\n\nMurray rallied to win his first title since 2019 at the ATP Challenger event in Aix-en-Provence after clinching a 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over top seed Tommy Paul.\n\nAfter acclimatising to the slow tempo of the clay, Murray fought back from a one-set deficit to ultimately dominate the American in the remaining two sets - marking a first Challenger title in 18 years.\n\nMarch\n\nMurray carried his fine form with him to Indian Wells where he sailed through to the Round of 32 where he faced fellow Brit Jack Draper. In a hard-fought battle of the Brits, Murray's journey in the desert was cut short after being defeated by Draper, 7-6(6), 6-2.\n\nFebruary\n\nContinuing where he left off in January, Murray headed to the Qatar Open where he picked up wins against Lorenzo Sonego, Alexandre Muller, Alexander Zverev and rising star Jiri Lechzka in four consecutive three-set matches to make it to the final. Here, he finished runner up to Daniil Medvedev in a 6-4, 6-4 defeat.\n\nJanuary\n\nMurray started his year at the Adelaide International 1 where he lost out to Sebastian Korda in the first round.\n\nAt the Australian Open, he enjoyed a 5-set epic in the opening round, which saw him knock out world No.14 Matteo Berrettini. Riding on the high of that win, Murray then went on to perform a comeback win against hometown favourite Thanasi Kokkinakis, coming from two sets down to clinch the match 4-6, 6-7(4), 7(5)-6, 6-3, 7-5 to dominate headlines. Unfortunately, Murray lost out to Spain's Robert Bautista-Agut in the third round but left Australia with his head held high.\n\nJanuary\n\nStarted the season by reaching his 69th career ATP final at the Sydney Tennis Classic. He beat Nikoloz Basilashvili, David Goffin and Reilly Opelka en route to the final, where he lost to top seed Aslan Karatsev 6-3, 6-3.\n\nMurray then beat Basilashvili again in an epic five-set match at the Australian Open before losing out in the second round to Taro Daniel.\n\nFebruary\n\nMurray bounced back with a win over Alexander Bublik in Rotterdam but was beaten by eventual champion Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second round.\n\nMarch\n\nThe former World No.1 claimed his 700th career win in the first round at Indian Wells with a stunning comeback against Taro Daniel – winning 1-6, 6-2, 6-4 in two hours.\n\nMurray had a warm welcoming in Miami after a strong first round, beating Top 50 player, Federico Delbonis 7-6(4), 6-1, but his campaign sadly came to a halt after losing to world No.2 Daniil Medvedev in the second round.\n\nMay\n\nMurray returned to the clay in style, comfortably defeating Dominic Thiem at the Madrid Open before knocking out Canadian, and top 20 player, Denis Shapovalov 6-1, 3-6, 6-2. Murray subsequently was forced to pull out of his third-round clash with Novak Djokovic due to illness.\n\nJune\n\nMurray began his grass court season at Surbiton where he advanced to the semi-finals before falling short against America’s Denis Kudla, losing 5-7, 6-7, 6-3.\n\nThe former world No.1 then reached his second ATP final of the season at the Stuttgart Open. He won his first match over a top 5 opponent against Stefanos Tstisipas in the quarter-finals, but lost to Matteo Berrettini 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 in the final.\n\nJuly\n\nThe two-time former Wimbledon champion met Australia’s James Duckworth in the first round at SW19, winning 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to advance to the second round for the 15th time in his career before coming up short against American, John Isner.\n\nAugust\n\nMurray then travelled over to the states, where he reached the quarter-finals in Newport - narrowly losing out to Alexander Bublik 7-5, 6-4 - before making a fierce comeback at the US Open where he advanced to the third round. However, a tough draw in the form of Matteo Berrettini saw Murray exit the tournament in the third despite pushing the Italian to four sets.\n\nSeptember\n\nMurray became the eighth Brit in history to reach a half century after making his 50th appearance for Great Britain at the Davis Cup this year. However, despite Murray’s victory in the singles, the British team exited the Davis Cup Finals group stages after the USA and the Netherlands defeated Murray and partner Joe Salisbury in the doubles to top Group D.\n\nOctober\n\nMurray progressed to the quarter-finals at the Gijon Open before exiting the tournament following a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 defeat to America’s Sebastian Korda.\n\nWhat has Andy Murray won?\n\nMurray has won 46 singles titles, including three Grand Slams (US Open and Wimbledon twice), 14 Masters 1000 series, two Olympic Gold Medals, and a title at the ATP Finals.\n\nWho is Andy Murray's coach?\n\nMurray is currently being coached by Mark Hilton.\n\nWhen did Andy Murray win Wimbledon?\n\nMurray has won Wimbledon twice, once in 2013 (beating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, 6-4) and then again in 2016 (beating Milos Raonic 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2)).\n\nWhen did Andy Murray start playing tennis?\n\nMurray started playing tennis at the age of three with his Mum, Judy Murray.
