        "text": "Mavericks forward/center Elton Brand joined Ben & Skin on KESN-FM 103.3. Here are some highlights.\n\nWhat is your assessment of coach Carlisle, personality wise?\n\nElton Brand: He's a great leader. I think he spends all of his time in the practice facility. I come to shoot, he's there. He'll take a break and play ping pong. He loves basketball, he loves teaching players and he loves winning. His personality is that he's about basketball. And it translates to us.\n\nGive us the nutshell of what it's like being in the locker room with Chris Kaman.\n\nElton Brand: Man, he is a goofball, but he's a great person. He doesn't mean anything malicious by it. He just talks off the cuff, and it translates on the court. We're talking about tough shots. He'll make a whirling dervish 360 left-hand hook. And he'll make it and he'll run down the court giggling and laughing himself. But that's just him. That's his personality. And he brings it to the court. And as you saw last night, he can really play. He's gonna help us in a lot of ballgames.\n\nWhat's your take on Chris Kaman not understanding the importance of hiding the starting lineup?"
