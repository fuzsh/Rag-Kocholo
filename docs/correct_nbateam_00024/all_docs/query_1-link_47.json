        "text": "by Marcel Mutoni / @marcel_mutoni\n\nFree agent guard OJ Mayo broke the news himself on Twitter last night, that he was headed to Dallas after spending the first four years of his career with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nMayo — the third overall NBA Draft pick in 2008 — will reportedly sign a two-year deal with the Mavericks, according to multiple published reports.\n\nPer the Dallas Morning News and Star-Telegram:\n\nFree agent guard O.J. Mayo tweeted the news that he has agreed to terms with the Mavericks, and a league source confirmed that it’s a two-year deal, with a player option on the second year. […] Mayo tweeted, “I will be signing with dallas! #Mavsnation.” Moments later, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban tweeted, “Welcome to the family OJ. We are fired up !! MFFL Mavs/Mayo Fan For Life !”\n\nThe addition of Mayo gives the Mavs 10 players under contract, including Dirk Nowitzki, Shawn Marion, Vince Carter, Rodrigue Beaubois, Dominique Jones, Chris Kaman, Elton Brand, Darren Collison and Dahntay Jones. The Mavs also have a team option for center Brandan Wright at $947,907, and could re-sign free agent point guard Delonte West. […] The 6-4 Mayo, who made $5.6 million last season, could step into the starting lineup with Nowitzki, Marion, Kaman and Collison.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks got off to a rough start this summer, and faced major criticism from fans and media, but they’ve bounced back nicely and put together a compelling team for the 2012-’13 season.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, the Mavs are set up to be major players during next summer’s free agency madness."
