        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks have reportedly added another piece to their frontcourt in forward/center Elton Brand. HoopsHype's Jorge Sierra reports that the deal is for one year and will bring some veteran depth to the Hawks.\n\nBrand spent last season with the Dallas Mavericks where he averaged 7.2 points and six rebounds per game while primarily in a bench role. It was the first time in Brand's career that he failed to average double figures in points. Brand is 34 years old and a 14-year veteran but his agent David Falk thinks he can play four or five more seasons due to his client's seriousness about his conditioning.\n\n\"We think it's a great opportunity for him,\" Falk said. \"I can see him playing 4-5 more years because Elton is serious about his conditioning and, besides, he plays more with his head than his body at this point. Atlanta is a good fit and Elton will be a good veteran presence there.\"\n\nTerms of the deal haven't been reported and the team has not officially announced anything regarding Brand yet.\n\nUpdate* Peachtree Hoops' Robby Kalland has confirmed the report with a league source. Team expected to announce later this afternoon.\n\nUpdate No. 2: The Hawks have issued a press release announcing the signing. Here is a quote from general manager Danny Ferry on the move:\n\n\"Elton brings a veteran presence both on and off the court and is a welcomed addition to our locker room,\" Ferry said. \"His ability to play center or power forward will give our frontcourt a great deal of versatility and we think he will be an outstanding fit to our program.\"\n\nMore from Peachtree Hoops:"
