        "text": "Inks four-year deal with Philadelphia\n\nBona was drafted with the 41st overall pick in the 2024 draft and has secured a rookie contact after a solid start to the Summer League. The UCLA product has averaged 6.3 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.0 blocks in 22.7 minutes per game in the Summer League thus far. It will likely be difficult for Bona to crack the rotation with Andre Drummond already serving as backup to Joel Embiid.\n\nSigns two-year deal with Philly\n\nMartin will boost the team's bench depth due to his positional versatility. However, he's not expected to be a major factor in most fantasy formats. He averaged just 3.7 points and 2.2 rebounds per game across 60 regular-season appearances (two starts) in 2023-24.\n\nOut for 2024 Summer League\n\nDays will not only miss the Sixers' opener in Las Vegas, but the entire tournament. He played for the Vipers in the G League during the 2023-24 season, and all signs point to him returning there in 2024-25 as well."
