        "text": "Elton Brand has traded his sweats for suits, and so far the new Delaware 87ers general manager likes the fit and the feel.\n\nHis days are full of duties that run from the mundane – “Who gets a parking pass?” he said with a hint of pleasant incredulity this week -- to the bedrock goal of player development.\n\nThat leads to questions such as “Has this guy earned an opportunity to play for the Philadelphia 76ers?”\n\nNFL: Wentz works his magic in Eagles' win\n\nCOLLEGES: Blue Hens make long-awaited Top 25 return\n\nNo detail is too small and no task too large when one is in charge of an NBA G League franchise with limited staff that’s aiming for grassroots appeal and to aid its parent club, the 76ers.\n\nThe G League, renamed this year because of a partnership with Gatorade, is the former NBA Development League, or D League.\n\nHaving closed a 17-year NBA playing career at the end of the 2015-16 season, Brand, now 38, appeared set to slide into a career as a filmmaker that was already well underway and quite successful. But an invitation by the 76ers to serve as a player development consultant last December stirred his interest in a second career in basketball off the court.\n\nIn August, he was named GM of the 87ers, who’ll begin their fifth season playing at the University of Delaware’s Bob Carpenter Center in Newark next month. The Sevens’ first home game is Nov. 6.\n\n“What’s our budget for the team meal? Can we get a bus?,” Brand said of some of the matters he must deal with. “It goes all day and night, from talking to players’ agents, dealing with that stuff.\n\n“But that’s how you earn your chops – immerse myself in it and see if this is really for me, can I do this?”\n\nEugene Burroughs, entering his second season as 87ers coach, said what he appreciates most about working with Brand is “He’s a good person, and he wants everyone to be successful. You want someone who can see where you’re at and can help get you to where you want to be.”\n\nBrand was the first pick of the 1999 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls out of Duke. The 6-foot-8 power forward went on to average 15.9 points and 8.5 rebounds with the Bulls (1999-2001), Clippers (2001-08), 76ers (2008-12), Mavericks (2012-13), Hawks (2013-15) and 76ers again (2015-16).\n\nHe was a two-time all-star (2002 and 2006) and also played for the United States in world championship competition.\n\n“It was always a physical battle. He had great footwork,” said 87er Emeka Okafor, who played in the NBA from 2004-13 and is now trying to get back after missing the last four seasons with a neck injury. “He’s been in the league a long time and he gets it. He’s on the other side now [in management] but he still understands what it’s like to be a player so he walks that line pretty well.”\n\nBrand actually retired from playing following his stint with the Hawks, who offered him an assistant GM post.\n\n“I just wasn’t ready to work,” he said. “I needed to relax and stay away from the game for a while, just be with my family [wife Shahara and kids now 9 and 5 at their suburban Philadelphia home]. Then the Sixers called me off the couch.”\n\nBrand answered that call, coming out of retirement in January of 2016 to return to the court. Even though he was told his role would be limited, Brand ended up averaging 13.2 minutes and even started a game.\n\n“That led to this,” he said. “[As a player development consultant] the ownership group let me see high-level meetings, the draft discussions, trade discussions. I thought, this is really interesting. It was really cool. As a player, you’re not exposed to that. You come in every day, get your four or five hours in, make yourself the best you can be and you’re gone.\n\n“The business side of it really piqued my interest. I thought if I could play basketball, I could work basketball.”\n\nBrand had long assumed he would simply transition from playing to film-making. He is one of the co-owners of Gibraltar Films and co-produced its first movie “Rescue Dawn,” which starred Christian Bale as a U.S. pilot shot down and imprisoned during the Vietnam War.\n\nHe expects that experience to help as he launches the new phase of his basketball life, where he’ll need to be creative.\n\n“All the skills translate,” he said. ‘You’ve got to juggle different tasks every day. In working with players, you’re trying to see what the potential is.”\n\nBrand hopes to live by words he heard spoken by 76ers coach Brett Brown – “You have to grow where you’re planted” – in making the 87ers a more important part of the Delaware community, he said.\n\n“We want people to come to the games, sure, but we also want to give back to these communities,” said Brand, referring to the school visits and other such activities 87ers players take part in.\n\nA recognizable name and face such as Brand certainly aid those efforts, said Joe Richmond, the 87ers ambassador of basketball who has been active in local youth and professional basketball the last couple decades\n\n“The reality is, he brings so much credibility to us,” Richmond said. “He’s a family guy, and Delaware’s all about family, Delaware’s always been about community. That’s what Elton brings to the table.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com. Follow on Twitter @kevintresolini."
