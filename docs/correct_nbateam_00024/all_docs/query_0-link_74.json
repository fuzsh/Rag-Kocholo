Luka Doncic is a perennial superstar at only 24 years old. He averaged a career-high 32.4 points last season while grabbing over eight rebounds and dishing out eight assists. Doncic is one of the most exciting, explosive, and reliable players in the league. His floor partner, Kyrie Irving, has also been a star for the past decade. Irving was traded to the Mavericks last year and stayed with the team in free agency. He’s put up more than 23 points per game for the last seven seasons. And Irving is an elite shooter too, hitting nearly 40% from three for his career. If the Mavs go anywhere, it’ll be Doncic and Irving steering the ship.\n\nAmerican Airlines Center is the place to be for NBA viewing.

And Irving is an elite shooter too, hitting nearly 40% from three for his career. If the Mavs go anywhere, it’ll be Doncic and Irving steering the ship.\n\nAmerican Airlines Center is the place to be for NBA viewing. The Osadia Tequila Club is an exclusive, semi-private seats sold in groups of four. Complimentary access, premium benefits, VIP parking, right to first refusal, and access to other premium areas are all a part of the deal. Theater Boxes are another option and accommodate 4-6 or 8-12 guests. In a Suite-like environment, VIP parking, private entrance, all-inclusive food and beverage, access to other areas, and access to adjoining clubs are included. Prices vary for half and full season Box securements. Loge Boxes are another area with private, prestigious, and complimentary amenities. And, for Suites, the Mavericks have you covered. Food and beverage packages, VIP treatment and experiences, fully-equipped meeting rooms, and exclusive access are available.\n\nPast Spotlights\n\nJason Kidd took over for longtime coach Rick Carlisle last year and promptly led the team to the Western Conference Finals, upsetting the top-seeded Phoenix Suns in the second round to get there. The club is surrounding emerging star Luka Doncic with new players after trading Kristaps Porzingis midway through last year and then parting ways with Jalen Brunson over the summer. Tim Hardaway Jr. returning to health will help, as will the addition of Christian Wood, who starred on a down-trodden Houston team. Dorian Finney-Smith also had career-highs last year in points, assists, and steals and will be looking to add to those numbers.\n\nSuites at the American Airlines Center range in size from 18 to 50 guests, so no matter the occasion, a luxury suite at a Mavericks game will suit your needs and are available on three different levels of the arena. All suites come with customizable food and beverage packages, VIP parking in the Lexus Garage, and access to all Platinum Level clubs and lounges in the arena—so be sure to come to the game early!\n\nManagement may have changed, but the expectations remain sky-high in the Lone Star State. Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis lead the way once again as two of the most dynamic and exciting\n\nplaymakers in the NBA. Three-point specialist Tim Hardaway Jr. inked a four-year extension to keep the core of this group together, and the additions of Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown should provide sparks off the bench. A Mavs icon returns to sit at the end of the bench—Jason Kidd replaces Rick Carlisle as head coach of a club that made the playoffs, but was sent home early, in back-to-back years. Kidd most recently served as the head honcho for the Milwaukee Bucks, who made the postseason twice under his wing. American Airlines Arena offers numerous ways to feel as glamorous as team owner Mark Cuban while watching along. Single game or luxury suite leases offer VIP parking in the Lexus Garage as well as private attendant and concierge service. Platinum Premiere provides in-seat service and $30 towards food, beverage, or team merchandise every single time the Mavericks tip-off! Courtside Seating is always a hit with the best views, invitations to exclusive events, and first crack at playoff ticket sales.\n\nLooking for a different team or stadium?\n\nWe rent out suites all over the country\n\nTOP\n\n×\n\nAmerican Airlines Center / Dallas Mavericks Suite Map and Seating Chart\n\nThe seating chart below shows where the Dallas Mavericks suites at American Airlines Center are located.\n\n×\n\nStay in Touch\n\nBook a Suite\n\nThank you\n\nThank you for submitting your request.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
