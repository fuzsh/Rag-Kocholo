Here is every player who has ever held the position of Dallas Mavericks power forward.\n\nMost divisive: Antoine Walker\n\nOver 200 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Dallas Mavericks Power Forwards of All Time\n\nBirthplace : WÃ¼rzburg, Germany\n\nNationality : Germany\n\nTeam : Dallas Mavericks\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1998-2019\n\nThe iconic power forward, Dirk Nowitzki joined the Mavericks in 1998 through a draft day trade and went on to become the most legendary player in the team's history. Possessing a unique shooting touch for a big man, Nowitzki revolutionized the power forward position with his exceptional scoring ability and knack for stretching the floor. As a result, he earned 14 All-Star selections, an MVP award in 2007, and led the Mavs to their first NBA Championship in 2011, also securing the Finals MVP title. Dirk's storied career not only solidified his place among the best Dallas Mavericks power forwards of all time but also as one of the most outstanding players in the league.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1984-1990\n\nSam Perkins joined the Mavericks in 1984, selected as the 4th overall pick in the NBA Draft. Known for his versatility on offense, Perkins was one of the first power forwards to incorporate the three-point shot into his game consistently. This inside-out threat made him a matchup nightmare for opponents, and he was a crucial contributor during the Mavericks' deep playoff runs in the late 1980s. Although he didn't win any awards while with the team, Perkins' groundbreaking style of play and consistent production earned him a well-deserved spot among the best power forwards in Mavericks history.\n\nBirthplace : Waukegan, Illinois, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Dallas Mavericks\n\nPosition : Small forward, Power forward\n\nDallas Mavericks: 2009-2014\n\nAcquired via trade in 2009, Shawn Marion quickly became a vital cog in the Mavericks' machine with his do-it-all playing style. His ability to defend multiple positions, run the floor, and finish around the rim made him an invaluable asset for Dallas, particularly during their championship run in 2011. In addition to his on-court contributions, Marion brought a wealth of experience and veteran leadership to the Mavs, culminating in his selection to the All-Defensive Second Team in 2011. Marion's unique skillset and undeniable impact on the Mavericks' success solidify his position among the team's best power forwards.\n\nBirthplace : Ventspils, Latvia\n\nNationality : Latvia\n\nTeam : Washington Wizards\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nDallas Mavericks: 2019-2022\n\nSecured through a blockbuster trade in 2019, Kristaps Porzingis immediately established himself as a vital part of the Mavericks' future alongside Luka Doncic. Standing at 7'3\", Porzingis utilizes his height and shooting ability to create mismatches for opposing defenses, earning the nickname \"The Unicorn.\" In addition to his offensive prowess, he is an imposing presence on the defensive end with his shot-blocking skills. Though still early in his tenure with the Mavs, Porzingis' unique blend of size and sharpshooting has already etched his name among the top power forwards in team history.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, New York\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1986-1991, 1994-1995\n\nDrafted seventh overall by the Mavericks in 1986, Roy Tarpley showcased immense potential with his impressive athleticism and ability to score both inside and outside the paint. However, his career was marred by a series of off-court issues, limiting what could have been a highly productive stint in Dallas. Despite his tumultuous tenure, Tarpley's undeniable talent, including a Sixth Man of the Year award in 1988, lands him among the organization's top power forwards.\n\nBirthplace : Dresden, Tennessee\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Dallas Mavericks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, Washington Wizards\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1993-1996, 2002-2003\n\nA tenacious rebounder and physical defender, Popeye Jones joined the Mavericks in 1993 after being selected 41st overall in the NBA Draft. His relentless work ethic and ability to contribute on both ends of the floor made him a fan favorite during his three seasons in Dallas. While never an All-Star, Jones' determination and hustle have earned him recognition as one of the top power forwards to don a Mavericks uniform."
