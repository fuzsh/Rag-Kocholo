        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nWas always a smart, hard-working presence in the post. An above-average rebounder and shot-blocker who never stopped working on or off the hardwood. Brought power, skill, intensity and leadership to the court every game. Was a clubhouse asset who mentored younger players. Was a bit undersized for an NBA post player (although his huge wingspan made up for it to some degree). Age and injuries limited his ability to play big minutes as his career wore on, and he became particularly lacking in the durability department late in his career."
