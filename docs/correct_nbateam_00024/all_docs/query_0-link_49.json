        "text": "DALLAS - Free agent shooting guard O.J. Mayo tweeted he \"will be signing\" with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nSoon after Mayo posted his note on Twitter late Monday, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban sent out his own tweet that read, \"Welcome to the family OJ. We are fired up !! MFFL Mavs/Mayo Fan For Life!\"\n\nIn 301 games in the past four seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies, the 6-foot-4 Mayo has averaged 15.2 points a game. Mayo was the third overall pick in the 2008 draft by Minnesota, who then traded him to Memphis in a seven-player deal.\n\nMayo started all 164 games his first two seasons in Memphis, but has since played off the bench. He started only 17 of 71 games played in 2010-11 and played in all 66 games without starting last season, when he still averaged 12.6 points and 2.6 assists per game.\n\nDallas has restocked its roster after being unable to get Deron Williams to join his hometown team this offseason. Guards Jason Kidd and Jason Terry left in free agency a year after the Mavericks won their only NBA title, and 7-foot center Brendan Haywood was designated as their amnesty player.\n\nThe Mavs won the bid to claim two-time All-Star forward Elton Brand off amnesty waivers by Philadelphia on Friday and reached a one-year deal with 7-foot center Chris Kaman. Last week they also acquired point guard Darren Collison and wing player Dahntay Jones from Indiana in a trade for center Ian Mahinmi."
