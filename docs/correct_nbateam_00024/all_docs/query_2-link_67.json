        "text": "Elton Brand is the General Manager of the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers. Elton’s success as a general manager comes following a 17-year NBA playing career, where he was the first overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft (Chicago Bulls), co-Rookie of the Year and a 2X All-Star. This followed his stellar playing career at Duke, where he led the Blue Devils to the 1999 National Championship Game and was the consensus National Player of the Year. Prior to becoming the team’s GM, Elton served in the roles of player development consultant and General Manager of the Delaware 87ers (now Delaware Blue Coats).\n\nIn addition to his role within the 76ers basketball operations, Elton is an active community ambassador, serving on the boards of both the Sixers Youth Foundation and the Philadelphia Film Society. Additionally, he sponsors young people through the Urban Affairs Coalitions Summer Youth Employment Program, which provides paid summer job opportunities and support to youth ages 14-18. The six-week program includes career exposure, on-the-job mentoring, and professional development. Elton is very passionate about educational development, and he has acquired various certifications from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he works closely with Wharton’s leadership experts and others from around the world in a dynamic, interactive environment."
