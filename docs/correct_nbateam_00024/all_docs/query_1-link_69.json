        "text": "Mavericks beat writer Eddie Sefko answered questions in a chat Tuesday. Here are some highlights.\n\nmoe ... Does it really make any sense to make the playoffs? I know you read every year how bad the draft is this year, but wouldn't it make sense to try your luck in the lottery or maybe get some places up in the draft with the lottery pick?\n\nEddie Sefko: Moe, go back to join Larry and Curly. That's an American joke about the Three Stooges, by the way, just in case it doesn't translate across the pond. It's always better to be in the playoffs, even if there's only a slim chance for any success. Fans like it, generally. And players are capable of doing things beyond what they've shown when the lights shine brightest. Besides, you put these Mavericks against the Spurs and I guarantee you they'd figure out a way to throw a scare into those old guys. Now, against OKC, I wouldn't be quite as optimistic that they could win a game or two or three.\n\nStefan ... So do you think we'll think differently of the Mavericks if they make a run here?\n\nEddie Sefko: Maybe I'm easily impressed in my old age, but I already have a fairly healthy respect for these guys, particularly the veterans, who have shown pride and grit and dug out of a major hole. Admittedly, as coach Rick Carlisle said this morning after practice, they have done nothing so far. But they are in position to do something, which a lot of us thought was going to be tough to do. But, referring back to that trivia question a few posts ago, they are 0-11 against the top four in th West, and that includes 0-2 against the Clippers. They need to scrape out a quality win against one of these teams and time is running thin.\n\ngarza4141 ... what if Dallas this summer plugs Al Jefferson in at Center and Mo Williams at PG, how much better would this team be?\n\nEddie Sefko: Better, but still not contending-quality. I was on the Jefferson bandwagon earlier in the year, but I think he has to be your second or third best player to have a title-worthy team. I like Jefferson and have always had a bro-mance on Paul Millsap. But if you have to max either one out, I'm less enthused. But you are on the right track in one respect. Sooner or later the Mavericks are going to have to hit on a major free agent who comes with some risk. Think Andrew Bynum, assuming he doesn't have both legs amputated by now. They will have to roll the dice on a player who others might not be sold on. If they hit, it'll be great. If they whiff, they'll have honorary seats at the lottery for years to come."
