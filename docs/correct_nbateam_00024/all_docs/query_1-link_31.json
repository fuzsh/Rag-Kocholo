        "text": "ATLANTA - The new-look Atlanta Hawks signed two-time All-Star Elton Brand on Monday, picking up a player who can bolster their depth in the frontcourt and provide veteran leadership in the locker room.\n\nThe 34-year-old Brand averaged 7.2 points and 6.0 rebounds per game last season with the Dallas Mavericks. He played in 72 games, with 18 starts. While clearly not the player he once was, the Hawks intend to use the 6-foot-9 Brand in a backup role.\n\n\"Elton brings a veteran presence both on and off the court and is a welcomed addition to our locker room,\" general manager Danny Ferry said in a statement. \"His ability to play center or power forward will give our frontcourt a great deal of versatility.\"\n\nThe Hawks have undergone a massive makeover heading into Ferry's second full season as GM.\n\nFerry acquired forward Paul Millsap with a $19-million, two-year deal and matched Milwaukee's $32-million, four-year offer to point guard Jeff Teague, a restricted free agent.\n\nThe team also re-signed 3-point specialist Kyle Korver, agreed to a deal with free-agent forward DeMarre Carroll, and landed a couple of foreign players in the first round of the draft: point guard Dennis Schröder from Germany and 7-foot center Lucas Nogueira from Brazil.\n\nKNICKS: Metta World Peace says he will be signing with the New York Knicks.\n\nTeam officials at the NBA summer league in Las Vegas wouldn't confirm the move, but World Peace says he is excited to join Carmelo Anthony and the Knicks. \"The team is amazing, the players. I'm excited to play and hustle,\" he said Monday in Las Vegas.\n\nWorld Peace was waived Thursday by the Los Angeles Lakers, who used the amnesty clause to create salary cap space.\n\nPACERS: Signed Chris Copeland to a two-year deal on Sunday.\n\nIt's been a long road for Copeland, who played in Spain, Germany and Belgium and the NBA Developmental League. He signed with the Pacers after spending his rookie season last year with the New York Knicks as a 28-year-old.\n\nWith the Knicks, Copeland averaged 8.7 points on 47.9 percent shooting, including 42.1 percent from 3-point range, and 2.1 rebounds\n\nper game.\n\nMAVERICKS: Continue to negotiate a free-agent deal with Samuel Dalembert, and a source said Saturday that both sides seem optimistic that an agreement will be reached, and that they are inching in that direction.\n\nDalembert remains the best center available on the open market."
