        "text": "Dirk Nowitzki is one of the best players of all and a Dallas icon. But what if it all changed if 76ers picked Dirk Nowitzki over Larry Hughes?\n\n*In this scenario, Dallas selects Robert Traylor and trades him to Bucks for Larry Hughes because Dallas would taken him but the Bucks wanted Traylor anyway so they trade Hughes instead of Nowitzki because already have Ray Allen and Nowitzki was off the board.*\n\nFirst off before we get started, let me just say that these two my favorite players of all time so I’m supremely excited to this what if Dirk Nowitzki’s 39th birthday. You guys ready, because I am, so lets get started. In the 98–99 year, nothing really changes as Iverson is young and Dirk has a rough rookie year. The Sixers still get swept by the Pacers in the Playoffs, and the Spurs beat the Knicks in the NBA Finals. Looking on the next year, nothing relatively changed with the Sixers or Mavericks except Dirk upping his numbers on 17–5 on 46% shooting. This year Shaq still wins MVP and Elton Brand/Steve Francis won ROY, The Sixers win 8 more games and the first over the Pacers and the 3rd best team overall, The Mavericks lose 7 games without Dirk and w/ Larry Hughes. In the playoffs, the Sixers defeat the Hornets in the first round but lose to the Pacers in 5. After that everything is still the same, the Lakers defeat the Pacers in the Finals but the future is bright in Philadelphia. Of course this is the dubious year, where AI didn’t have a second star and had to go at it alone against the 16–1 Lakers, which is the premise of this What if. Now he has Dirk (albeit not in his prime but still good enough to shipwreck the Mavs this year.) Speaking of them, Mavs lose a extra 14 games without Dirk and go 39–43 and will get the 11th pick and draft Jerome Moiso, who I will give 5 dollars to anybody who knows who that is. Meanwhile, The Sixers win 9 more games and win 65 games overall and lock up 1st seed and best record in the East as well as the best record in the league. (See what happens when my boy AI gets another star that caters to his skillset?) They go through the Pacers, Raptors, and the accused rigged ECF against the Bucks easier than before, but one important change that in this scenario is that the Sixers now have homecourt advantage against the Lakers, who still go 16–1 and still have Shaq at his apex. The Sixers win game 1, thanks to 27 points from the league MVP, Allen Iverson as Dirk slapped up a double-double. The Lakers blow out the Sixers by 15 as Shaq put 23–15 and Kobe scored 14 as the Sixers Big 2 went for a combined 10–34. In Game 3 in LA, The Sixers pull it out to take a 2–1 lead with Iverson having a 21 point-12 assist game and Dirk chipped in 17 points. Shaq dominated as usual with a 34–14 game and Kobe threw in 24 points but the problem was the surprisingly bad supporting cast, while the Sixers got 22 points from two unlikely heroes in Rodney Buford and old Toni Kukoc. Lakers bounce back in game 5 winning by 9 thanks to Shaqobe (Bill Simmons’ nickname for Kobe-Shaq, mines too) dropping 54 points together, Shaq also grabbing 14 rebounds. It was obvious Shaq was the issue for the Sixers because he’s freaking Shaquille O’Neal. AI had 29 and Dirk had 19 points. Now its tied 2–2, and in Game 5 The Sixers win it by 9, again Shaqobe dominates again scoring 52 points, but the supporting cast fails them as D-Fish only scores 7 points, Rick Fox in 30 minutes scores only 4 points and Big Shot Bob only scores 5 points, as ironically the Sixers get great support from the bench, as George Lynch scored 9, Mutombo grabbed 18 rebounds, Aaron McKie scored 12 points and AI only scored 15 points but Dirk leads the Sixers for the first time in this series as scores 24 points and grabbed 9 boards. Now with a 3–2 lead and the opportunity to close it out in Los Angeles. But they can’t as Kobe leads with 33 and Shaq puts up 25–14 and Derek Fisher chipped in 12 points as well. Dirk had 16 points and 6 rebounds, and AI had 24 and 7. Now it’s going back to Philly for Game 7 and the opportunity to upset the historically good Los Angeles Lakers. And guess what happened? Philly won the championship in ’01 by 12 with AI and Dirk both scoring 25 points, with AI and Dirk getting their first rings and handing Kobe his first loss in the Finals, and Shaq losing his second finals dropping his record to 1–2 in the Finals. The weird part about all of this is that Lakers did not get good support for Shaqobe, whilst the 76ers got decent production from George Lynch, the immortal Rodney Buford, old Toni Kukoc and Aaron McKie which gives way to the old thought of two top 5–10 players cannot win you a championship. (And before you Lakers fans get triggered I simmed this series on WhatIf Sports *not sponsored* which is the same thing that Mike Korzemba uses so don’t get mad at me, don’t hate the player hate the game….\n\nAfter winning the championship and shocking the world in ’01, Dirk and Philly develop a unbreakable bond like in Dallas, which means Dirk will sign for less for the team. And the truly scary part is that Dirk & the supporting cast will only get better. In the draft, the Mavs select Troy Murphy to fill the PF role despite passing up on Zach Randolph. And at the end of the draft the Sixers and Spurs picks will switch because the Spurs lost to the Lakers (Lakers’ pick was traded to Atlanta in a deal that netted the Lakers Horace Grant). And the Spurs take Tony Parker at 27 instead of 29, and the Sixers still take Sam Dalembert at 29. In free agency, The Sixers who won the chip, and resigned Bruce Bowen (who was w/ Philly early in his career), and Patrick Ewing, who was interested in ring chasing so he signs with Philly in hopes of a ring to cement his legacy. In real life, the Sixers only won 43 games as AI had to carry a unholy load, as such he shot a awful 39% from the field, but in this scenario AI has Dirk to pass to and that opens up the floor for him, as such he becomes a better passer and better teammate. The Sixers add a extra 16 wins with steady improvement from Dirk, AI and Bruce Bowen, and they win 59 games and got the 1st seed w/ the 2nd best record in the league. AI finishes second to Tim Duncan in MVP voting for the dynamic all-around year he had. Dirk puts up 23–10 on 47% shooting. The Mavs lose a extra 20 games without Dirk and miss the playoffs and end up with the 9th pick in the draft. The Sixers face the Raptors in the 1st round, and sweep them in 3. They face the Celts in round 2 and win in 4. They go to face the Pistons in the ECF, and finish them off in 6 to face the Lakers for the 2nd second time in a row. With homecourt advantage in the first round, The Sixers win game 1 by 16 points with Dirk putting up a ungodly 35–14, and AI putting up 25–14. Shaqobe scored 64 POINTS combined but the supporting cast only scored 30 points. In Game 2, the Lakers off two clutch FT’s from Shaq, the series split 1–1. The Sixers won game 3 with Dirk putting up 25–15, and AI 20 and 9, Bowen and McKie each scored 14 pts. Shaqobe puts up 49 pts, and Matt Barnes BFF scored 11, as the Sixers take a 2–1 lead. In game 4, Shaqobe combined for a ludicrous 76 points, Horry scored 14 and Matt Barnes’ BFF scored 16. The AI & Dirk combo scored 49 in a loss, tying the series 2–2 going back to Philly. And at home, Philly wins 97–88, thanks to Dirk’s 39 and AI’s 10 rebounds. *This has been Dirk’s coming out party in the playoffs, and he’s not even in his prime.* Shaqobe “only” scored 37 points and Barnes’ BFF scored 16 again, bringing the series to 3–2 Philly. In LA, with a chance to close out the Lakers in 6 again, The Lakers win by 10 because Shaqobe combined for 61 points. In a losing effort, Dirk put up 29–8, AI put up on 19 on 9–24 shooting. And in the all important G7, the one that might forever alter multiple legacies, the ’02 Sixers win again by one point, 90–89! Shaqobe scored 49 points, and Rick Fox had 12 points, but like in ’01 the supporting cast failed them. Dirk, Bruce Bowen and Matt Harpring all scored 12, and the man of the match, Allen Iverson who tallied 26 pts, 7 asts and 2 stls. Now why do I say he’s the man of the match, well he messed around and hit the biggest shot in NBA history. “Allen Iverson squares up, crosses on Kobe, goes around Horry, stops on a dime pulls up on Kobe….. BANG, BANG! The Philadelphia 76ers win their 2nd straight championship off of AI’s Game Winner! Unbelievable!” You heard budget Mike Breen. The Sixers win their second title in a row as Shaq drops to 1–3 and Kobe is 0–2 in the Finals, which is a stat i dont even have to explain that will effect their legacies. Allen Iverson obviously wins Finals MVP. See, the the 2000's Lakers dynasty finally have a challenger that’s beaten them twice in the East, which in real life was historically bad. I’m not saying their overrated, but they have the Lakers of the East in Philadelphia. AI & Dirk is now 2–0 in the Finals, and instead of being called selfish and a loser, AI is a winner and possibly better than Kobe. Dirk’s two rings puts him over KG for now. In the revamped 2003 Draft, the Sixers get the 29th pick instead of the 16th and J.E. Skeets’ doppelganger. Now for the good stuff, the Mavs instead of the Suns get 9th pick, which means….\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks select….\n\nF Amar’e Stoudemire out of Cypress Creek High School\n\nThe Suns instead take Melvin Ely, The Clippers take J.E. Skeets’ doppelganger. After losing to the Sixers, the Lakers and Jerry West felt they to do something drastic. So with the internal power of Jerry West and David Stern, with Kidd being disgruntled with Byron Scott in New Jersey and being a free agent the next year, he gets traded to LA for Derek Fisher, Rick Fox and 2 1sts.\n\nAnd as soon as Kidd deal happened, Scottie Pippen signed with the Lakers formed a unstoppable fantasy squad in (Kidd-Pip-Shaqobe). In response, the Sixers signed Shawn Kemp for the latest installment of ring chasing. With the addition of Kidd and Pippen go from 50 wins to 68 wins and best record in the West and in the league. The NJ Nets lose a extra 5 games without Kidd. Not far behind is the Sixers with 63 wins, with Dirk putting 25–10, AI putting up 27–5–4. Kobe wins his 1st MVP instead of TD (Sorry Shea Serrano if someway in hell you read this crapshoot of a article) I estimate he averaged 31–6–6.5 on 47% percent with 2 steals with his team winning 68 games. The Mavs lose a extra 13 games without Dirk, but STAT fills in nicely and they still win 47 games and make the playoffs as a 8th seed, which they get promptly swept by the Lakers who are like the ’01 Lakers in the playoffs dominating. The Sixers sweep their first round matchup as well, and face the Hornets, and sweep them as well, going to their 3rd straight ECF to face the Pistons and the Sixers beat them in 5. (SORRY SHEA SERRANO) The Lakers beat the Spurs in 6 to make it the third straight these teams faced off. But like in the 2017 Finals, this was a huge disappointment. In Game 1, the Lakers won by 7 thanks to Shaqobe going for 46–22 and Kidd chipped in 20 and 11 assists. With Kobe hounding him, AI only went for 8 pts on 4/16 shooting. Dirk put up 18 and 6. In G2, Lakers win by 18 as Shaqobe scored 48–16 and Kidd had 16 and 11. Iverson had 21 and 6 but had more turnovers than a bakery. Dirk had 18 and 6 and Bruce Bowen chipped in 16 in the loss. Now going back to Philly, in game 3, the Sixers lead throughout the game with Iverson having 26 pts and Dirk balling with a 28–15 game. With the Sixers leading 99–97 with 3 seconds left, Jason Kidd got the ball, dribbled once and heaved a shot from midcourt….. AND HITS IT TO WIN THE GAME!!! With Kidd hitting the shot and Shaqobe having a 36–21 game, the Sixers got deflated after the loss and came out flat in G4, and was losing big to the Lakers for 3 quarters. They made a deep push with Iverson scoring 21 in that quarter alone, Dirk had 4 3s and a unlikely hero in Eric Snow who had 15 pts. But the dominance of Shaqobe (49–21) and Kidd not kidding around with 11 pts, 14 asts and 3 stls, was ultimately too much. (Kidd won Finals MVP) With the 2003 draft looming (which to some is the greatest draft of all time) and that draft having LeBron James (the guy who was compared to MJ since his sophomore year of high school and Carmelo Anthony, the freshman who lead Syracuse to the Natty (and won it). This is end of part 1 so lets see some early winners/losers:\n\nWinners:\n\nAllen Iverson: 2 rings, MVP runner-up: Has totally changed his perspective in the eyes of NBA fans, and has already won 2 rings.\n\nSixers: 2 rings: Is batting with the Lakers as the team of the 2000's.\n\nDirk: 2 rings: Is seen as better than KG in mosts eyes.\n\nKidd: 1 ring: Got himself out of a awkward situation in New Jersey, and won a ring in the prime of his career.\n\nPippen: 7 rings: Probably elevates him in discussions of the 2nd or 3rd best small forward of all time.\n\nLosers:\n\nShaq: 2–4 Finals record: This hurts his legacy against people like Hakeem and Moses Malone.\n\nShawn Kemp: no rings: Ring chasing isn’t always successful…\n\nSpurs/Timmy: Finals appearances, MVP: Kobe stole a MVP away from TD which might hurt his legacy. The Spurs miss on a Finals apperance which takes from the Spurs lore a bit.\n\nNeutral:\n\nKobe: 1–2 Finals Record, 2003 MVP: The Finals record might hurt his legacy in the future, but what will help is a 2003 MVP five years before he did in real life.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this article it took FOREVER to do and this is only part 1, I will be coming out with pt 2 as soon as I can so sit tight. If you have any ideas, feel free to contact me @Bullsfan323 or the publication I write at @TFCP12. I also have a YouTube channel which I showcase crappy Overwatch gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA4onefOoHz8PUh-cAAki4g\n\nThanks once again and share with friends so they can critique as well.
