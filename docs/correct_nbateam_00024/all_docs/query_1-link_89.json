        "text": "It must be spring again\n\nOkay, the grass is green, there is more daylight in the evening, there are more happy hours and everyone is trying to lose a few pounds from winter hibernation. Spring time?\n\nNo. Playoff time for the NBA and the NHL. My favorite time of the year.\n\nIt’s the only time of the year when you can wear out a set of batteries for your remote control. Whether it is Pistons, Heat, Spurs, Suns or Flames, Senators, Red Wings or Devils, it is the time when some women have nothing coming when they vie for time with their significant other. “Sorry, honey, it is a quadruple header.” In other words you have nothing coming tonight or in the foreseeable future.\n\nYou see, these playoffs run non-stop every night through the first week of June. So get ready.\n\nBoth leagues promise to put on a show. The NBA has started to grow up. Starting with the dress code, the league is starting to show some maturity that was desperately needed. Throw in the likes of Lebron, Kobe, Shaq, Dwayne Wade, Duncan, Nash and oh yes the one TEAM you see every night, the Detroit Pistons, and you have quite a collection of talent and teams. The officiating has become more consistent, so this year’s playoffs should prove to be exciting.\n\nNow that the regular season is over, it is time to announce some awards for this year’s regular season.\n\nMVP. The finalists: Lebron, Dirk Novitski, Steve Nash, Elton Brand and Kobe\n\nClaibs’ Call… Elton Brand, LA Clippers. He will not win it because he plays on the West Coast and many voters are too lazy to watch him put up numbers every night on what traditionally has been one of the worst teams in the league. Look for Lebron to win it. He has re-energized the league and has been a key to Cleveland making the playoffs.\n\nCoach of the Year. The finalists: George Karl (Denver), Avery Johnson (Dallas), Mike Brown (Cleveland), Flip Saunders (Detroit), Byron Scott (New Orleans-Oklahoma City).\n\nClaibs’ Call… Avery Johnson (Dallas). This one was close. All of the finalists could make a good argument, and I left off Lawrence Frank in New Jersey. Karl came in late last season and taught Carmel how to play in the NBA and look at his performance, not to mention that the Nugggets won their division. Mike Brown has never been a head coach anywhere until he met a guy named Lebron and had a chance to coach Larry Hughes. Flip Saunders? Best record in the league. Byron Scott should get some recognition for the job he did in almost making the playoffs with Hurricane Katrina being as big of a distraction as one could very imagine.\n\nThe winner though is Avery Johnson. He took a team that had the reputation of being able to score at will and playing just enough defense to lose under former coach Don Nelson. This year the Dallas Mavericks are the sixth best team in the NBA when it comes to defense. It’s all Avery here. Plus there is not a more respected guy in all of the NBA when it comes to coaches. Honorable Mention: Guan Hollins and Vince Nanc … St. Ann’ s Eighth Grade Girls City- County CYC C champions.\n\nGeneral Manager. Kiki Vendewauge (Denver), Danny Ferry (Cleveland), Elgin Baylor (LA Clippers).\n\nClaibs’ Call… Danny Ferry (Cleveland). Not bad for a Duke guy. When I think of Duke I think of Quin Snyder… Sorry folks. Ferry already had Lebron but adding Larry Hughes, Damon Jones and keeping some key free agents with this being his first GM job is enough for him to win this one.\n\nRookie of the Year… Chris Paul (New Orleans- Oklahoma City). This one was not even close. He was the best player on the team in his first year and they almost made the playoffs. There is hope for the little man in the NBA.\n\nThe finals are a long way away. There are only six teams that can realistically get there, barring some sort of injury. Count on Detroit, Miami, Dallas, San Antonio, Phoenix, and Memphis to say something about who wins it. I’ll have that pick next week along with some NHL and NFL draft thoughts.\n\nSpeaking of the NFL, look for the name John David Washington. Not as first-round draft pick but as a guy that some teams think has a chance to make a team. There have been a number of running backs as well as players that have the name Washington. There have been none before now that can claim that their dad is a twotime Academy Award Winner. You see John David is the son of Denzel. He starred at Morehouse College and had a successful career. If he makes it, he may be one of the few that won’t be in it just for the money. Inside Man is doing very well at the box office, thank you."
