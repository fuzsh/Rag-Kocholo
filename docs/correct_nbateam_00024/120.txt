The recently-amnestied Elton Brand is hoping to land in Dallas, but there’s no guarantee that the Mavericks will be able to win his services via the waiver wire. Per NBA.com: “Free agent forward Elton Brand is hoping the Dallas Mavericks submit the winning bid for his services among eligible teams and claim him off of amnesty waivers, according to a source close to the 33-year-old. Brand was officially amnestied by the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday at 5 p.m., starting the 48-hour claim process in which teams that are under the salary cap can submit blind bids to claim him. The team that submits the highest bid gets the player. Ideally, Brand would want to clear waivers, according to the source. If no team submitted a claim, he would become an unrestricted free agent and would be able to sign with any team, including those over the cap, as long as they had cap exceptions. But the likelihood of no team under the cap making a bid is unlikely, given the dearth of quality big men available. Brand has slowed some in the past few years after suffering an Achilles’ injury, but his career averages of 18.3 points and 9.4 rebounds are probably too good to pass up. Going to Dallas ‘would be great,’ the source said.”
