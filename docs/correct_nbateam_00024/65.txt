Free-agent forward Elton Brand reached a one-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks, his agent David Falk told USA TODAY Sports.

Brand, who will earn $4 million on the deal, spent last season with the Dallas Mavericks and averaged 7.2 points and six rebounds in 72 games. The Mavericks signed Brand to a one-year deal after the Philadelphia 76ers used the amnesty provision on him in July, 2012.

Brand heads to Atlanta where general manager Danny Ferry is trying improve on the fly. In free agency, the Hawks re-signed forward-guard Kyle Korver, signed forward Paul Millsap and retained restricted free-agent point guard Jeff Teague by matching the Milwaukee Bucks' four-year, $32 million offer sheet.

"Elton brings a veteran presence both on and off the court and is a welcomed addition to our locker room," Ferry said in a statement. "His ability to play center or power forward will give our frontcourt a great deal of versatility and we think he will be an outstanding fit to our program."

Brand, 14-year veteran, provides solid front-court depth for the Hawks.

"Elton has four, five quality years left to play," Falk said. "He's not a person who makes plays with his speed or jumping. He's a player who makes players with his head. He's not concerned with starting. He's knows he'll come off the bench. He'll be able to play quality minutes at the four (power forward) and five (center) when teams go small. He played both in Philadelphia and Denver. This is a good opportunity for him."

Falk likes the situation in Atlanta. Falk was Ferry's agent when Ferry played in the NBA, and Falk has known Ferry's dad, Bob, since the mid-1970s. He believes in what Ferry is doing with the Hawks, starting with the decision to hire Mike Budenholzer, a former San Antonio Spurs assistant, as coach.
