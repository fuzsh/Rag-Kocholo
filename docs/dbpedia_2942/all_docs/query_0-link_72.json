        "text": "100 (or so) Favorite Images from the Films of 1952\n\nFavorite Shots from the Films of 1925\n\n100 Images from the Films of 1930\n\n100 (or so) Images from the Films of 1949\n\n100 (or so) Favorite Images from the Films of 1990\n\nWhat I’ll Remember About the Films of 1969 (contains some favorite shots at the end)\n\nWhat I’ll Remember About the Films of 1982 (contains some favorite shots at the end)\n\nTop Ten By Year: 1952 Poll Results\n\nI’m always collecting screengrabs as I make my way through a watchlist. Most often, I’ll go back through the film sometime in the days afterward, and use my timestamp notes to capture images that jumped out at me (I should note that about 25% of the images below were not captured by me). I spend time organizing and placing them in folders with other like-minded images, putting favorites aside for this post. I refer back to them as I very gradually compile my What I’ll Remember post, in the hope that images jog some observation or memory I may be forgetting. So, by the time I post this, I’ve seen these images a lot. And grown attached to them. They, and many more that aren’t on here, have been rattling around in my head, in tandem with one another, for many months.\n\nI’ve curated and ordered them in the hopes that there is an always evolving ~vibe as you scroll through. I like when images from one film enhance or compliment images from another, so I’ve attempted to do that here. I have my reasons for each of these, but I’ll mostly leave the bulk of the post text free, save for some short asides. Sometimes it’s the movement of the shot that matters (which obviously can’t be captured here) or the narrative context. Sometimes it’s the expression on the actor or just pure aesthetics. Sometimes it’s just some combination of the texture of older film images, the past, cinematography, and film stocks. A film from now with the same blocking and framing (although probably a different aspect ratio) likely won’t mean much, if anything, because aesthetics, standards, technology, and production have transformed so completely, that the 21st century image, for a whole host of reasons, very often feels impermanent.\n\nTo wrap up, I’ve finally finished working through the year 1952!!! I won’t be writing about my favorites now. I’ll cross that bridge whenever I do a zine for that year. I’m taking a bit of a hiatus from this project. I’ve been doing it for ten years, and with my other hobbies/interests, the people in my life, and all the non-project films I’ve been itching to see across film history, it just feels like the right time to pause.\n\nI’ll still be working on zines! There are several years from this project that still don’t have one, and I’d like them to (1965, 1930, 1949, 1952). I’m hoping to have a zine for 1965 out by the end of the year. That was only the second year I chose for this, so it was a very long time ago and will involve a lot of rewatching and catching up with a ton I didn’t see the first time through (seems like I still find a way to always have a year watchlist going).\n\nThis means that this is one of only two more 1952 related posts I’ll be making. The other is my What I’ll Remember About the Films of 1952: A Love Letter post, which will go up later this month!\n\nThe “or so” of this title has come to mean about 160 images from 71 different films. I’ve credited the director and cinematographer of each, and, in a few cases, the performer. I hope you enjoy!\n\n100 (or so) Images from the Films of 1949\n\nHi everyone! Lots happening lately in the Top Ten By Year Project:\n\nThe 2 zines I made, for 1943 and 1969, are in permanent stock over at my etsy site Femina Ridens. Please go check it out and pick one (or both!) of them up.\n\nI’m pretty much done with the 1949 watchlist so you can look forward to 2 other posts besides this one going up in the next month. They are What I’ll Remember About the Films of 1949: A Love Letter & the Top Ten By Year: 1949 write-up.\n\nNext, I’ll be taking on 1990. My watchlist is the biggest one to date. I doubt I’ll end up watching everything, but I’m excited to post it next month so keep a look out for that too!\n\nI’ll also be starting on a new zine, this one on 1978 (which was done several years ago for this project; I’ll be revisiting, revising, and reinterpreting everything I did for that year into a new booklet)\n\nFor my What I’ll Remember posts, I always include some favorite shots & images from the films of whatever year I’m doing. However, I’ve only ever done one of these 100 Images posts before (for 1930). It felt time to make this an official part of the Top Ten By Year project.\n\nMany of these screengrabs are mine, some are not. This isn’t comprehensive. Some films aren’t represented here at all, and it’s not because there was nothing standout in them. But from what I was able to capture on my own, as well as what was available on various websites, this is a pretty decent overview of my favorite images. And there are a lot of great images I saved but chose not to use here. Many of these mean more with context, some are purely for aesthetics, most are a combination of both. For the most part, there is some rhyme or reason for the order in which they are presented.\n\n(I have a few more films to watch so I may or may not be adding a few to this post over the next week)\n\nSo go check out the previous one of these (1930 is not the static wasteland you’ve been led to believe, not by a longshot), and please enjoy this one!\n\nPUCE MOMENT (director: Kenneth Anger / cinematography: Curtis Harrington)\n\nTHE QUIET DUEL (director: Akira Kurosawa / cinematographer: Sôichi Aisaka)\n\nTHE PASSIONATE FRIENDS (Director: David Lean / Cinematographer: Guy Green)\n\nTHE QUEEN OF SPADES (director: Thorold Dickinson / cinematographer: Otto Heller)\n\nTHE THIRD MAN (director: Carol Reed / cinematographer: Robert Krasker)\n\nBORDER INCIDENT (director: Anthony Mann / cinematographer: John Alton)\n\nINTRUDER IN THE DUST (director: Clarence Brown / cinematographer: Robert Surtees)\n\nTHE THIRD MAN (director: Carol Reed / cinematographer: Robert Krasker)\n\nUNE SI JOLIE PETITE PLAGE (Such a Pretty Little Beach) (director: Yves Allégret / cinematography: Henri Alekan)\n\nLE SANG DES BÊTES (Blood of the Beasts) (director: Georges Franju / cinematography: Marcel Fradetal)\n\nTHE SET-UP (director: Robert Wise / cinematography: Milton R.

But 100 Images from the Films of 1930 sounds better than 105 images from the Films of 1930, doesn’t it? Well, I’ve finally come to the end of the 1930 Watchlist. It feels good, but it also right on time. Momentum plummeted towards the end, so it was a snail’s pace cross over the finish line.\n\nOver the next two weeks I will be rounding out my 1930 coverage. Posts will consist of, in addition to this, the What I’ll Remember post and the Top Ten which will include write-ups on the films and the year in general. Previous 1930 coverage can be found here:\n\nTop Ten By Year: 1930 Poll Results\n\nMovie Poster Highlights: 1930\n\nWhat follows is a visual celebration of 1930. While viewing over fifty 1930 films in the past six months, I gradually collected screenshots of images that jumped out as something I wanted to capture and cherish for the future. For this post I chose personal favorites from that sizable collection. The images are arrange purposefully. I tried to group together shots that had something visually in common, whether it be content or blocking. I hope you enjoy them. I started doing this with 1978. You can find a sampling of my favorite shots from that year in my What I’ll Remember post. But it was 1925 where this aspect of the Top Ten By Year Project really took off. You can find that here. I promise you won’t regret it; there are so many incredible images from 1925. The same goes for 1930, or at least, I hope you agree.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite shots or images from 1930 film?\n\nPrix de beauté (director: A.
