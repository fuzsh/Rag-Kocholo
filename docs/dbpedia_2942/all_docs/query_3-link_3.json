        "text": "July 31, 2022: The Third Man directed by Carol Reed, whose blue-plaqued house I used to walk past each day twice a day, was broadcast on the weekend and it prompted me to look up the cinematographer given how influential the movie’s visual style, hard lighting, frequent use of the Dutch Tilt and reliance on wide-angle lenses remains in the world of cinematography.\n\nIt turns out that the cinematographer was Robert Krasker, Jewish, born into poverty to a tragically widowed mother, physically small, of Eastern European background, proudly of Australian nationality, born in Alexandria in 1913 on August 21 and whose birth was registered in Perth, Western Australia later that year after the ship returning him, his parents and siblings to this country docked in the port of Fremantle, first destination for so many immigrants from the northern hemisphere back then.\n\nKrasker left WA for Europe in 1929 aged just 16, in search of a life, decent education and a career as so many creative Perth people still do, studying art in Paris and then cinematography, photography and optics in Dresden under the great Professor Robert Luther before moving to London in 1931 or 1932 where he was later a founding member of the British Society of Cinematographers (BSC).\n\n“Robert Krasker was one of the world’s finest directors of photography. Several film books and periodicals list him as the greatest of his era, his work lauded for its atmospheric lighting and expressionist techniques. He worked with Carol Reed, Joseph Losey, John Ford, Luchino Visconti, Robert Rossen, Anthony Mann and David Lean, among others. His credits include Henry V, Odd Man Out, The Third Man, Senso and Billy Budd. He won an Academy Award for cinematography in 1949. But in his home country he is hardly ever mentioned; there is no statue of him, no scholarship in his name, no wing of a film school dedicated to him….\n\nAustralia has produced several DOPs of real note since Krasker, but none is arguably yet of his stature. That Krasker is rarely if ever mentioned in his home country is to this country’s shame. The inevitable justification, as with writer-director John Farrow, is that “he was only born here and worked exclusively overseas”. So what? Krasker was born Australian and always called himself such.\n\nThe definitive article on the degree to which Australian directors of photography take an Australian vision with them onto foreign productions is yet to be written (see interview with DOP Geoff Burton), but the dazzlingly atmospheric work of Robert Krasker might be an excellent place to start.”\n\nCinema Papers, April 1997, issue #115, ‘Robert Krasker: A Filmography by Scott Murray’, at Issuu.\n\nStudiocanalUK: The Third Man | Official Trailer\n\n“Here’s the official trailer to the 1949 mystery film ‘The Third Man’. Watch it now in 4K stunning resolution!

Why? If he had been successful, we might have had a very different and more advanced and better established feature film industry with on-the-job training from a world-class Oscar-awarded master Australian cinematographer, twenty-five years sooner than the “renaissance” of Australian feature filmmaking in the mid-1970s.\n\nSun (Sydney, NSW : 1910 – 1954), Saturday 20 October 1951, page 3\n\nNoted movie cameraman comes home\n\nCelebrated Australian-born movie photographer Robert Krasker today reached Sydney in the Orcades from London with hopes of making a film classic here.\n\nKrasker, who left Perth 20 years ago for overseas, was awarded the Academy Award for his photography in the film, The Third Man.\n\nHe was accompanied by English film art director Harold Evans.\n\nSaid Krasker. “I’ve been thinking about a great Australian film for sometime.\n\n“There are terrific possibilities here with the climate, the back ground and the acting talent.\n\n“But can we find material for film stories?”\n\nEvans said some Australian films had been “wild and woolly” because of poor scripts.\n\nThe Age (Melbourne, Vic. : 1854 – 1954), Fri 19 Oct 1951, Page 3, Won Hollywood “Oscar”\n\nAustralian-born Robert Krasker, top British movie cameraman and winner of a Hollywood “Oscar,” returned in the Orcades yesterday hoping to “put Australia on the film map.”\n\nWith him came British art director Harry Evans, whom Mr. Krasker describes as “a brilliant designer with brilliant ideas.”\n\nMr. Krasker, 38, won an American academy award last year for “the best black and white photography” for his camera work in the film The Third Man.\n\nHe says his other oustanding camera work was in the films Henry V, Odd Man Out, Brief Encounter and Caesar and Cleopatra.\n\nMr. Krasker said that, with Mr. Evans, he hoped to establish a film studio in Sydney as soon as possible.\n\nVital Factor\n\nHe would not follow the line of other film makers here by choosing only stories with a purely Australian background.\n\nSetting did not matter so much, but to make a successful film the story must be a good one, Mr. Krasker said.\n\nAustralia had concentrated too much on making semi-documentary films, such as The Overlanders.\n\nFrom this type of film overseas audiences saw Australia only by “outdoor Australia.”\n\nHe strongly favored “stark realism” in film photography, but technique had to change to suit the atmosphere of the story.\n\n“I’ve wanted to return to Australia since I left it at the age of 16.\n\nIf I can put it on the film map, I will feel I really have done something worthwhile with my life,” Mr. Krasker added.\n\nThe Australian Women’s Weekly (1933 – 1982), Wed 31 Oct 1951, Page 30, Ace Australian movie man here: he wants to make film without kangaroos\n\nBy BETTY BEST, staff reporter\n\nAce cameraman at 38, Australian-born Robert Krasker returned to Sydney this week to explore the possibilities of making an Australian film that is not about gum trees and kangaroos.\n\nIn 1950 Mr. Krasker won an Academy Award for his camera work on “The Third Man.”\n\nAmong the other 20 odd hit films he has photographed are “Henry V,” “Brief Encounter,” “Caesar and Cleopatra,” and “Odd Man Out.”\n\nWhile he is here he will live on a boat in Sydney Harbor as the easiest way to solve the accommodation problem.\n\nHe has already found the boat he wants.\n\n“In the 22 years I have been away, Sydney has become so much bigger and more crowded that the only place I can find my way about is Manly Beach,” he said.\n\n“Australian youth has become almost unrecognisably Americanised, and has lost a lot of its individuality.”\n\nMr. Krasker told me that he had decided three things about the film he would like to make here:\n\nIt should be photographed around Sydney to prove that Australia was not all bush.\n\nIt should be aimed at the international market.\n\nIt should have an English or American star to give it box-office appeal overseas.\n\n“I have been keen to come home for years because people in England and Europe as a whole just don’t know how Australians live, and I would like to show them,” he said.\n\n“All the publicity about Australia has told them repeatedly that it is a large country with miles of unused bush and lots and lots of kangaroos.\n\n“That’s all very well as far as it goes. But I feel that it’s more important to show them how much Australia has in common with other countries rather than how different it is.\n\n“There’s no reason why films made in Australia shouldn’t eventually be better than those made in England.\n\n“Australia has ideal filming conditions.\n\n“Producers in England are aiming first and foremost at speedy production.\n\n“One of the biggest hold-ups in England is the unsuitable climate.\n\n“Sometimes I have waited for weeks to get a sunny day.\n\n“But Australia is a cameraman’s heaven, with day after day of glorious sunshine.\n\n“There’s no reason why Australia shouldn’t get all the necessary equipment and make quick-fire productions ideal for today’s film budgeting.”\n\nMr. Krasker regards the film industry as essentially international and he applauds the policy of sharing stars and producers between England and America.\n\nHe has just finished making a film for Sir Alexander Korda called “Another Man’s Poison.”\n\n“It was a perfect example of international effort,” he said.\n\n“The story centres on a woman who murders her husband in the peculiar atmosphere of the Yorkshire moors.\n\n“That’s a setting that you couldn’t reproduce anywhere in the United States.\n\n“Douglas Fairbanks as producer realised this and determined that the film must be shot in England.\n\n“He wanted Bette Davis as his star, and fortunately the script appealed to her, so she went to England to do it.\n\n“Her husband, Gary Merrill, played her husband in the film. There were only two others in the cast.\n\n“The film was completed in nine weeks, which just shows you how we have to cut down on expenses these days.”\n\nMr. Krasker added that the English film industry was climbing out of the depression it had been in for the past three years.\n\nAt least 15 big studios were turning out films faster than they had ever done before.\n\n“One of the most promising young English stars is Audrey Hepburn,” he said.\n\n“I shot a screen test for her not long ago, and am convinced that she’s heading straight for stardom.\n\n“She recently went to Hollywood, but fortunately I believe that she will return to England soon.\n\n“I deplore the actions of stars like Jean Simmons and Stewart Granger, who have gone to Hollywood, and have become thoroughly typed, and almost lost to the English screen.”\n\nMr. Krasker has been asked to film a Betty Box production in February called “Venetian Bird,” most of which will be shot in Venice.\n\n“It would be a most interesting job,” he added. “But if I can find what I want in Australia and get started soon I shall let it go by the board.”\n\nCommentary\n\nLike Robert Krasker, I grew up under the UV-heavy laser-beam sunlight of Western Australia, but without access to the British and European art galleries and museums that helped him form his way of seeing, lighting and photographing after he moved to Europe as a 16 year old.\n\nUnlike Robert Krasker, I now have access to some of the most sophisticated and powerful lighting instruments ever such as those made by German cinematographer Dedo Weigert under the Dedolight brand name and the ever-evolving collection made by Rotolight, to name just two.\n\nI’ve been wondering what he might have made of today’s DCI 4K 10-bit 4:2:2 HDR production standards and all the amazing and relatively affordable hardware and software available now?\n\nThe lights, cameras and editing gear upon which he built his career were unwieldy and limiting and yet he managed to create cinematic masterpieces with them.\n\nI’ve been collecting stills and trailers of many of the feature films he shot as research for this article and have been struck by how skilled he was at using the fresnel spotlights, brutes and carbon arc lights available through the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.\n\nI’ve also been impressed at how Robert Krasker changed his lighting and cinematography to suit the story and emotions of each movie and have begun collecting videos of his work in order to study them better.\n\nWhile doing so I’m reminded that I’ve seen many of his films on daytime broadcast television over the years and subconsciously learned a great deal from his lighting and camerawork as well as his eye as an artist.\n\nI’ve been saddened by how Robert Krasker has been so forgotten by his fellow Australians and how even those who may know his work only do so from less than a handful of his movies when he worked on so many.\n\nI have been thinking about how he, his work and achievements can be brought to the attention of Australian filmmakers as well as to members of the public, educational institutions and relevant authorities and will be working on that in the coming days.\n\nLinks\n\nB&H Affiliate Link – click here to help us with costs for creating this website and its contents by pre-ordering and purchasing items from B&H.\n\nB&H Affiliate Link – Sekonic – Robert Krasker BSC is depicted above using a classic analog Sekonic light meter on-set: the current version of it is the Sekonic L-398A Studio Deluxe III Light Meter.

By this time considered to be among the front rank of cinematographers, he shot the iconic and celebrated Brief Encounter (1945) based on a stage sketch and scripted by Noël Coward and directed by David Lean. This film was as sensitive and small scale in black-and-white as Henry V had been epic and celebratory in colour: Krasker was equally accomplished in both genres.”\n\nCanberra Times – Canberra International Film Festival looks back for its future – “Three films featuring cinematography by the Australian Robert Krasker will be a major feature of the program. “Krasker was a flamboyant cinematographer,” Pike says, adding that he used strong angles and striking camera moves to help tell cinematic stories.

He achieves amazing depth of field without the sharp, clean contours we associate with depth of focus; draping Reed’s people in mists or spotting them in streetlights and headlamps, outlining them in doorways or profiling them against window shades, Krasker conjures an atmosphere that a viewer’s eyes sift excitedly.””\n\nCinephilia & Beyond – Carol Reed’s ‘The Third Man’: How Orson Welles Stole a Show He Was Barely In – “Australian Robert Krasker, who had previously worked with Reed on Odd Man Out, rightfully took home the golden statuette.
