SYNOPSIS . « « (Not For Publication) One hundred and eighty years after the birth of Christ, the Roman Empire was at the height of its glory under Emperor Marcus Aure- lius (Alec Guinness). However, after seventeen years of warfare on the Northern Frontiers, the Emperor’s health is failing. Aware that his time is short, Marcus Aurelius summons to his Northern Fort, all the rulers of the Empire; and, in a stirring speech, urges their support for a true Pax Romana; a Roman peace whereby all member nations of the Empire will live under the same law as equals. Present at this historic gathering are the Emperor’s son, Commo- dus (Christopher Plummer) ; the Emperor’s daughter, Lucilla (Sophia Loren, as well as Livius (Stephen Boyd), a Roman General. That evening, Marcus Aurelius remarks to Livius that Commodus is not fit to succeed him as Emperor, and instead, Livius shall be the new Caesar. Livius protests but Aurelius makes it clear that Com- modus will not do. Cleander (Mel Ferrer), the blind court prophet, overhears the conversation. Cleander plots with two of Commodus’ friends to kill Marcus Aure- lius. They realize that if Livius becomes Emperor, he will put an end to their corrupt activities. Cleander agrees to smear poison on one side of a knife, cut an apple with it, and hand Aurelius the poi- soned half. When the Emperor dies, it will appear that he has suc- cumbed to his illness. Aurelius does die as planned and nowhere has he written that Livius shall succeed him. With no tangible proof, Livius cannot be- come Caesar, and thus, at the Emperor’s funeral, he proclaims Com- modus as the new Caesar. Livius stays on the Northern border and continues to wage war against Ballomar (John Ireland), leader of the Barbarians. Timonides (James Mason), a Greek philosopher, urges Livius to capture Ballo- mar alive, and convince him to cooperate with Rome. This was the wish of Marcus Aurelius; and when Ballomar is captured, they go to Rome and plead their case before the Senate. As the years pass, Commodus’ corrupt rule causes a revolt in the East. The Armenians, the Persians and even the Roman Legions align themselves against him. He orders Livius and his Army to the East, and there, in a fierce and bloody battle, Livius and his armies emerge victorious. Livius rescues Lucilla and returns to Rome. Commodus sends word tnat he hails Livius as the Savior of Rome, and offers to share the throne with him. But when Livius hears that thousands of prisoners of war have been massacred, he sends Com- modus a message: ‘““There must be a new Rome—or a new Caesar!” Commodus is furious at the turn of events. He orders the slaughter of Ballomar and his Barbarians. Next, he collects all the gold in Rome in order to bribe Livius’ army. Livius enters Rome and makes his way through the revelling crowd to the Temple of Jupiter, where he confronts Commodus and orders him to convene a meeting of the Senate. Livius wants the Senate to decide whether it will be the Rome of Commodus or the Rome in the tradition of Marcus Aurelius. As Livius talks with Commodus, he realizes that he has become insane with power and obsessed with his divinity. Commodus has come to believe that he is a god! Livius is placed under guard, and he, Lucilla and Ballomar are bound to stakes with a horde of Barbarian prisoners in an area where they are to be burned alive. Commodus, however, has a change of heart, and frees Livius so that he can challenge him to a duel. He wants the gods to decide which of the two shall rule Rome. A thrilling, brutal contest ensues, from which Livius emerges tri- umphant. As Commodus dies, he realizes that his Rome has ended. As the fire creeps closer to Lucilla, Livius jumps into the flames and trees her, just as the flame consumes Ballomar and the Barbarians. Now the populace hails Livius as Emperor, but Livius refuses to reign. While the senators bid for the throne he has refused, Livius takes Lucilla’s hand, and together they slip away from the tumult. 61,128 eee Lucilla—Daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius ...SOPHIA LOREN Livius—A Military Tribune of Rome ............

ONG Tf DAVID HILDYARD RUNNING TIME: 152 MINUTES Samuel Bronston’s “The Fall Of The Roman Empire’ Is A Powerful Screen Drama About Ancient Rome Rome, during the Second Century A.D., was a theatre of triumphs, a showplace of Imperial architecture and a center of culture. Now, all this—the drama, romance and adventure—can be seen in Samuel Bronston’s mammoth spectacular, “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” which opens MeL gh tee one ab thes, seo Theatre. Filmed in Ultra-Panavision and Technicolor, and star- ring such top names as Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason and Chris- topher Plummer, “The Fall Of The Roman Empire” has been hailed as one of the greatest film epics of all time. The story starts 180 years after the birth of Christ. The Roman Empire, under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness), is at the height of its glory. However, after seventeen years of warfare on the Northern frontiers, the Emperor’s health is failing. Aware that his time is short, Aurelius summons to his Northern Fort all the rulers of his empire; and in an inspired speech, urges their support for a true Pax Romana, a Roman peace whereby all member nations will live under the same law as equals. At this historic gathering are also the Emperor’s son, Commodus (Christopher Plummer), his beau- tiful and enchanting daughter, Lu- cilla (Sophia Loren) and one of his top generals, Livius (Stephen Boyd). That night, the Emperor tells Lucilla, that for the sake of the Empire, she must marry King So- hamus (Omar Sharif) of Armenia. Lucilla agrees to this in order to preserve peace in the East, al- though she and Livius are in love. Later, that same evening, Mar- cus Aurelius remarks to Livius that Commodus is not fit to succeed him as emperor, and instead, he wants Livius to be the new Caeser. Livius protests to this idea saying that Commodus is like a brother to him, but Aurelius makes it clear that Commodus will not do. When Aurelius suddenly dies, there is no tangible proof that Livius is to succeed him. Thus, at the funeral, Livius proclaims Com- modus as the new Caeser and pledges his complete support. As the years pass, Commodus’ corrupt rule causes a revolt in the East. The Armenians, the Per- sians and even some of the Roman Legions align themselves against him. He orders Livius and _ his Northern Army to the East, and there, in a fierce and bloody battle, Livius and his armies emerge vic- torious. Livius rescues Lucilla and returns with the armies to Rome. Now, as the inevitable showdown between Livius and Commodus draws near, Livius’ proclaims, “There must be a new Rome—or a new Caeser.” Livius enters Rome, alone, and makes a plea to the Senate—he is turned down, and as the thrilling climax is reached, he comes face to face with Commodus and the fate of the Empire is decided. “The Fall Of The Roman Em- pire” was directed by Anthony Mann and written by Ben Barzman, Basilio Franchina and Philip Yor- dan. The music was scored by Di- mitri Tiomkin.

With a star-studded cast headed by Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, Anthony Quayle, John Ireland, Mel Ferrer and Omar Sharif, ‘““The Fall Of The Roman Empire” is the story of Rome’s historic descent from*the height of civilization to the depths of despair. One hundred and eighty years after the birth of Christ, the Ro- man Empire was at the height of its power under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness). How- ever, the Emperor, with his health failing and aware that his time is short, summons all the rulers of the land, and in a stirring speech urges their support for a united empire whereby all member na- tions will live under the same law as equals. Present at this historic gather- ing is the Emperor’s son, Commo- dus, (Christopher Plummer); his. daughter, Lucilla (Sophia Loren) ; as well as Livius (Stephen Boyd), one of his top generals. That night, two things occur which ignite the empire’s sudden downfall; the Emperor tells his daughter that for the sake of the empire she must marry King So- hamus (Omar Sharif) of Armenia; also, he remarks to Livius that Commodus, his son, is not worthy to become his successor, and in- stead, he wants Livius to become emperor. Aurelius suddenly dies, and with- out proof that he wanted Livius as his successor, there is no choice but to name Commodus as the new Caesar. Commodus finally does take over, and with his ascent to the throne, the Roman Empire starts tumbling downward. “The Fall Of The Roman Em- pire” has been acclaimed as one of the most spectacular films ever to be put on the screen. It was di- rected by Anthony Mann and writ- ten by Ben Barzman, Basilio Ban- china and Philip Yordan. The ex- citing music was scored by Dimi- tri Tiomkin.

The Fall Of The Roman Empire’ Is A Magnificent Film Epic (Review) The long awaited Samuel Bronston epic spectacular, “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” opened last night to a packed honee atthe 245.26 2.8..% Theatre. Starring such outstanding names as Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, James Mason, Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer, “The Fall of The Roman Empire” is destined to become one of the great film re-creations of all time. The story begins approximately 180 years after the birth of Christ. The Roman Empire is at the height of its glory under Emperor Mar- cus Aurelius (Alec Guinness), but after several years of warfare, Aurelius feels that his time to live is short and he must find a new heir to his throne. Under normal circumstances, the new Caesar would be Commodus (Christopher Plummer), his son, but Aurelius feels that he is not worthy and instead decides to name Livius (Stephen Boyd), one of his ranking generals and the sweet- heart of his beautiful daughter Lu- cilla (Sophia Loren). This decision is well and good but before Aurelius can officially announce that he wants Livius to succeed him, he suddenly dies. Be- cause there is no tangible proof that Livius is to be Caeser, Com- modus ascends the thrown and with his corrupt rule, the Empire starts tumbling downward. Sophia Loren is stunning as Lu- cilla; her performance, ranging from poignant love scenes to in- tense drama, is superb. Stephen Boyd as Livius gives a powerful portrayal of a Roman general torn between the love for a woman and love for his country. James Mason as the Greek coun- sellor Timonides gives an interest- ing and truly excellent characteri- zation. Alec Guinness, in the im- portant role of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, is highly impressive. His speech to the rulers of the empire is one of the most exciting ever seen on the screen. As Aurelius’ son Commodus, Christopher Plum- mer is remarkable as a crazed Caesar who topples one of the world’s great empires. One of the highpoints of the film is its tremendous scope. The battle sequences are breathtakingly pho- tographed in Ultra-Panavision and Technicolor and when they are seen, it seems as if the viewer is in the middle of the battle. There is also a fine musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Directed by Anthony Mann and written by Ben Barzman, Basilio Franchina and Philip Yordan, “The Fall Of The Roman Empire” is the kind of film that appears only once in a while ... and should not be missed. This Paramount release has everything—-superb acting, in- tense drama, thrilling adventure, big excitement—-to make it the most enjoyable film of the year.

At the outset, Sophia felt her role as Lu- cilla, daughter of Marcus Aurelius, should be a bit more prominent.” “Bronston immediately followed with a better offer: “A million dol- lars for Sophia plus a role that would make her happy.” “Still a bit worried that Sophia might escape him, Bronston went to Rome to get her signature on a contract. He cornered Sophia and pulled out his checkbook.” According to Miss Pensotti, Bron- ston’s sense of humor and diplo- macy carried the day. “Please,” he was reported to have said, “I have just one check and my wife might spend it. Let me give you an ad- vance right away.” Bronston turned the check over —an advance for $300,000.

Alec Guinness Plays Roman Emperor In “The Fall Of The Roman Empire’ Although he picks and chooses his roles with such care that he makes fewer films than most stars of his standing, Sir Alec Guinness, starring in Samuel Bronston’s “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” which opens .......... até thervickact al oe Theatre, is probably one of the most sought-after personalities in motion pictures. Yet, fewer of today’s stars received more rebuffs when they began their acting careers than Sir Alec. Since he has a well- defined sense of humor underlying the serious dedication he gives to his work, he has no hesitancy in recalling them. For instance, he tells of the time he tried out for a school play while attending Pembroke Lodge School near London and his teacher dismissed him abruptly with ‘““You wouldn’t be any good at acting, Guinness!” “Of course I refused to accept such advice,” says Guinness. “T had made up my mind that I wanted to be an actor and I wouldn’t let a little thing like that discourage me.” He wasn’t discouraged later, either, when John Gielgud, who had been a judge at a drama school performance in which Guinness was awarded a prize, tried to help him get a foot- hold in the theatre. Gielgud provided him with letters of intro- duction to other stars of the London stage he knew. One of them was to Martita Hunt. “Martita, bless her soul, was kind enough to give me a per- sonal audition,” Guinness recalls. “Since she is frank and forth- right, she didn’t waste words. She advised me to try some- thing besides acting since, obviously, I was wasting my time.” In Samuel Bronston’s ‘The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” Alec Guinness stars with Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, James Mason and Christopher Plummer.

Theatre. 5 Use Plastic Set For The First Time In “The Fall Of The Roman Empire’ The first film set ever constructed entirely in plastic will be seen in Samuel Bronston’s “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” a Paramount release which opens ......... Osteo s,... . Theatre. Created by production designers Veniero Colosanti and John Moore, the unusual setting is a reproduction of the bedroom of Lucilla, daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, in Rome during the second century. It provides an exquisite background for the magnificient beauty of Sophia Loren, who plays Lucilla. Centered within the square walls of the room is a circular bed dais surmounted by a cupola ceiling of one solid piece of molded plastic, highly decorated in bas-relief. Ex- tremely light in weight despite its size, this entire dome was easily raised and lowered onto graceful columns to facilitate the lighting of the set by cinematographer Rob- ert Krasker. : The plastic walls, consisting of simulated marble and _ bas-relief panels, were realized by Colosanti and Moore from fragments of an- cient ruins uncovered by archaeol- ogists over the years. The effect achieved is that of bringing to life some of the actual wall paintings still visible at Pompeii. ; Gold festoons gracing the win- dows and garden entrance also were of finely molded plastic, so delicate they would have shattered from the vibrations of the heavy lighting and camera equipment, if they had been done in plaster. “This unusual use of the new set material also saves consider- able filming time while making it possible for director Anthony Mann to achieve a camera mobility which added to the effectiveness of the scenes.” In addition to Sophia Loren and Stephen Boyd, the cast of. “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,’ which was filmed in Ultra-Panavision and Technicolor, also is ‘topped by. Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christo- pher Plummer, Anthony’ Quayle, John Ireland, Mel. Ferrer and Omar Sharif. The magnificent Forum set in the forthcoming spectacular, “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” which ODENSE. wi. asiek At thers.) 0c Theatre, took ‘only’ seven months to build. Those who’ve visited the set dur- ing the filming maintain that the creation will dwarf any set ever before seen on a motion picture screen.

Exquisite Plaster Paradise In “The Fall Of The Roman Empire” Typical of the enormity—and ac- curacy—of the huge sets created for “The Fall of the Roman Em- pire,” the latest Samuel Bronston production for Paramount, which opensril..<. atithesss 3h. Theatre, is the fact that three large plaster shops were working full blast for four months turning out classic statuary by the hundred. In almost every arch of every temple and building, both outside and inside, stands the statue of a Roman sage, soldier or Emperor. The Via Appia, recreated for the film, is not, as is usually the case, lined with crosses but with famous statues. On top of the triumphal arches, soaring across the streets of “Rome” are magnificent groups of horses rearing up against the sky. All told, more than five hun- dred plaster figures have been made, both human and animal, for the set decoration in the film. The Bronston studio at Cham- artin has its own plaster workshop, but this was not enough. Two more workshops were taken over, one at the CEA studios on the outskirts of Madrid, and another in far off Valencia, with each workshop em- ploying about fifty skillful plaster- ers. Most of the statues are around eight feet in height, but topping them all is the huge statue of the goddess Minerva in the Basilica Giulia. Over 20 feet in height, she dominates the vast interior set holding aloft her massive shield and sceptre. Sophia Loren, wandering on the set one day between scenes, was properly entranced by all these no- ble Romans. But handsome as they are, she didn’t feel they quite meas- ured up to the flesh and blood Ro- mans who surround her in the film, namely Stephen Boyd, Alec Guin- ness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, Anthony Quayle, John Ireland, Mel Ferrer and Omar Sha- rif. They may not be statuesque, but they are certainly imposing. Anthony Quayle’s Career Is Up In The Air For Bronston’s “The FallOf The Roman Empire” The career of British stage and screen star Anthony Quayle has literally kept him up in the air of late. “It seems that I am in sort of an aerial rut,’ says the talented and dependable actor. For his current role as the aging gladiator, Verulus, in Samuel Bron- ston’s “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” which opens ........ ab Tt aiie e c ih t nce Theatre, he spends more time on the back of a horse than on terra firma. As Colonel Brighton in “Lawrence of Arabia,” the situation was similar, except in that instance the time was spent on the back of a camel. Prior to that his stellar role in “Damn the Defiant” found him emoting a great part of the time in the ship’s rig- ging. “This isn’t the first time that my career has led me into a rut,” he says. “A little over five years ago I decided that perhaps I had be- come too steeped in Shakespeare. I had acted it, directed it, produced it—the lot. Then I realized that this was all very well for people who liked Shakespeare but to every- one else I was a long-haired bore. I decided that to get out of the rut I had to do something to kill the image.” To Quayle’s delight he got a chance to play the villain in “Tar- zan’s Greatest Adventure.” “Before I knew what was happening I was whisked off to the jungle and sud- denly I found myself fighting for dear life on the edge of a cliff, with Gordon Scott breathing down my neck,” he explains. In “The Fall Of The Roman Em- pire,” a Paramount release which Anthony Mann directs from a screenplay by Ben Barzman, Basilio Franchina and Philip Yordan, An- thony Quayle has a co-starring role in a cast which includes such top names as Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher. Plummer, John ' Ire- land, Mel Ferrer and Omar Sharif. Mat 1P Still # ROM/S/29 JAMES MASON plays Timonides, Greek philosopher and counsellor to Emperor Mareus Aurelius, in the Samuel Bronston epic production for Paramount, “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” which opens Art utes Gee atthe oF ees Theatre. Also included in the cast of this Ultra-Panavision, Techni- color film are Sophia Loren, Ste- phen Boyd, Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer. It is difficult to picture beautiful Sophia Loren behind a stove, but when she returned to the Samuel Bronston Studios for additional Theatre she proceeded to prepare an eight course meal for Mr. Bronston and members of his family and staff. Fditorial: “THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE” Back in the days of the glory of the Roman Empire, there was a Classic saying: ‘‘All roads lead to Rome!” They did because roads are the arteries of a civilization, and Rome was the heart; the global center of commerce, military might, art, and a way of life unrivalled since the era of golden Greece and the Egypt of the mighty Pharoahs. Then, like the mighty nation be- fore it, the heart of this great giant began to falter; its bloodstream, consisting of cultural contributions started to dwindle; the pulsing, throbbing force which dominated an entire world subsided. To learn about the present, and anticipate the future, one must on occasion look into the past, and ask: How did this happen? The answer, at least part of it, may be found in a fascinating re- creation of the Rome that flourish- ed, and the Rome which crumbled into dust. Samuel Bronston’s “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,” which opens ...... atetne yeas: Theatre, is not history as it was— completely. These are not the real people, but actors, if extraordin- arily gifted ones, such as Sir Alec Guinness, Sophia Loren, James Ma- son, Christopher Plummer and Stephen Boyd, factual characters who portrayed a role, and them- selves played a part; a part in shaping the course of history. How did the Roman Empire per- ish-—and why? Well, only the en- igmatic Sphinx of ancient Egypt may be able to furnish the com- plete story; but part of it lies in the fact that although an Empire may be erected through tyranny, oppression, and slavery, the pillars of a civilization which is to survive must rest on the principles dedi- cated to the proposition: “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” This is the heart of the matter, which makes a _ nation mighty. When the organ which pumps the lifeblood of freedom through the veins, fails to do this, then it will soon cease to exist. All roads did lead to a city of majesty and grandeur once, as depicted in “The Fall Of The Roman Empire.” But they no longer do because dic- tatorship exacts its toll ultimately; not only in Rome, but in Egypt and Nazi Germany. The price of liberty and the survival of a na- tion as well as human beings, is eternal vigilance. That’s the lesson we may derive from Bronston’s au- thentic re-creation of a remark- able age which was ruled by author, philosopher and humanitarian, the last of the great Emperors, Mar- cus Aurelius, who is portrayed by Sir Alec Guinness as a ruler of infinite wisdom, who shaped ‘the art and moral code of his time. Editorial: “THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE” It is recorded that when the officer of the guard asked the dying Marcus Aurelius for the watchword of the day he replied: “Go to the rising sun; my sun is setting!’ Aurelius, Emperor of the mighty Roman Empire, was not only a philos- opher, but a prophet as well; for, although Rome was then at the height of its glory, its sun was setting too. Marcus Aurelius was a great statesman, and a ruler of profound wisdom; nevertheless for all his brilliance, he contributed to the death of the Roman Empire. For all of his virtues, his wisdom, moral fortitude, he had one weakness; fondness for his son, Commodus, who succeeded him to the throne. And by sacrificing the happiness and well being of millions of peo- ple, the Empire began to collapse. “The Fall Of The Roman Em- pire,” which opens ...... at the Theatre is a magnificent re- creation by Samuel Bronston which does more than capture the sweep and splendor of Rome in its last epoch of glory. It points a moral to every nation; that survival de- pends on the wisdom not only of the leaders of the present, but those to come. Emperor Aurelius for all the wisdom, and despite his statesmanship made the fatal blun- der of letting affection replace ju- diciousness. With that blunder, the Empire began to crumble and break into pieces. Samuel Bronston’s “The Fall Of The Roman Empire,’ has a re- markable cast of performers, in- cluding Sir Alec Guinness, Sophia Loren, James Mason and Stephen Boyd, who give the feel and sweep when the splendid Roman Forum was the meeting place deciding the fate of an Empire. There is a lesson for all nations to be derived from the Bronston production, “The Fall Of The Ro- man Empire.” The people and their leaders must decide not what is best for themselves—but what is best for the world; for power such as was known at the height of the Roman Empire will ultimately crumble when it is corrupted by personal interest!
