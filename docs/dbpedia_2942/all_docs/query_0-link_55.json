        "text": "The Academy Award for best cinematography is one of the most prestigious honors bestowed each year at the Oscars. The best cinematography Oscar has been around since the inception of the award ceremony but it underwent a great deal of experimentation and evolution in the early years.\n\nWatch: Roger Deakins on Film Lighting\n\nSubscribe for more filmmaking videos like this.\n\nAcademy Award cinematography\n\nHistory of cinematography at the Oscars\n\nThe first Academy Awards ceremony, held in 1928, nominated cinematographers for their collective work in the given year rather than an individual film, followed by the next year where the cinematography award was absent entirely, and the third year where films were nominated for Best Cinematography without naming the cinematographers.\n\nWhen color film began growing in popularity, the award was split with the main award going to a black and white film, and a “special achievement” award going to a film shot in color. By the 1940s, two full Academy Awards were given out for cinematography each year, divided into black & white and color. This would continue until 1967 when color and black & white films would finally be judged against each other for a single Best Achievement in Cinematography award. If you love the B&W look, check out our tips for black and white photography.\n\nCinematography Oscar movies\n\nAll Best Cinematography Oscar Winners\n\nBefore we pick our favorite Best Cinematography Oscar winners, let’s recap every single recipient of the award to date:\n\nbest cinematography academy award\n\nAll best cinematography Oscar Winners\n\n2022 - James Friend, All Quiet on the Western Front\n\n2021 - Greig Fraser, Dune\n\n2020 - Erik Messerschmidt, Mank\n\n2019 - Roger Deakins, 1917\n\n2018 - Alfonso Cuarón, Roma\n\n2017 - Roger Deakins, Blade Runner 2049\n\n2016 - Linus Sandgren, La La Land\n\n2015 - Emmanuel Lubezki, The Revenant\n\n2014 - Emmanuel Lubezki, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\n\n2013 - Emmanuel Lubezki, Gravity\n\n2012 - Claudio Miranda, Life of Pi\n\n2011 - Robert Richardson, Hugo\n\n2010 - Wally Pfister, Inception\n\n2009 - Mauro Fiore, Avatar\n\n2008 - Anthony Dod Mantle, Slumdog Millionaire\n\n2007 - Robert Elswit, There Will Be Blood\n\n2006 - Guillermo Navarro, Pan’s Labyrinth\n\n2005 - Dion Beebe, Memoirs of a Geisha\n\n2004 - Robert Richardson, The Aviator\n\n2003 - Russell Boyd, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\n2002 - Conrad L.

Road to Perdition (2002)\n\nA unique rain-soaked shootout\n\nWhen the Sam Mendes directed Road to Perdition was nominated for six Oscars at the 2003 ceremony, cinematographer Conrad L. Hall received his 10th nomination for Best Achievement in Cinematography. Unfortunately, Conrad L. Hall passed away less than three months before the annual awards ceremony. The prestigious Oscar was awarded to him posthumously, becoming his third win in the category and capping off a career that began all the way back in the 1950s.\n\nBest cinematography winners\n\nConclusion\n\nConrad L. Hall left behind an endlessly impressive legacy. This may not be his only entry on this list, read on to find out.\n\nBest cinematography winners & nominees\n\n19. Dances With Wolves (1990)\n\nMajestic scenery in Dances With Wolves\n\nWith Kevin Costner both directing and starring in the frontier epic Dances With Wolves, he needed someone he could trust and rely upon behind the camera, and that person was Dean Semler. Much of the beauty in Dances With Wolves comes from the stunning scenery where all of the action takes place. Dances With Wolves was a technically complex shoot with hundreds of extras, horses, and SPFX technicians requiring precise production coordination.\n\nAcademy Award for best cinematography\n\nConclusion\n\nThe sweeping story and gorgeous landscapes are sure to impress in Dances With Wolves.\n\nCinematography awards\n\n18. Bonnie and Clyde (1967)\n\nThe iconic, groundbreaking finale\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance of Bonnie and Clyde to the history of cinema. The film was groundbreaking and envelope pushing in more ways than one. Inspired by the French New Wave, Bonnie and Clyde was instrumental in the changing style of filmmaking as the 60s progressed into the 70s. And Burnett Guffey’s cinematography was a key part of that pivotal transition, perhaps most notably in the film’s envelope-pushing climax which showcased graphic violence in crystal-clear slow motion. One of the early examples of how to use slow motion to create iconic moments.\n\nAcademy Award cinematography\n\nConclusion\n\nBonnie and Clyde should be on every aspiring filmmaker’s watchlist. Check it out if you’ve never seen it before.\n\nBest cinematography Oscar\n\n17. The Revenant (2015)\n\nA 4K showreel of images from The Revenant\n\nAlejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu quickly followed up his hit Birdman with a second Oscar darling the very next year; an impressive back-to-back showing. The revenant again features show-stopping cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki. What makes the already incredible cinematography even more impressive are the conditions under which the film was made: in freezing temperatures, out in the wilderness, and with almost entirely natural light. Natural light is one of many different lighting sources and techniques used by cinematographers and this film is a high watermark for the style.\n\nCinematography Oscar movies\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Revenant is an impressive technical achievement in all regards.\n\nAcademy Award for best cinematography black and white\n\n16. The Hustler (1961)\n\nHeavy chiaroscuro lighting\n\nThe Hustler is the first black and white film on our list, and was awarded the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar back when the category was still divided into black and white and color sub-categories. Eugen Schufftan’s moody lighting and use of chiaroscuro lighting evokes a Film Noir mood without committing the film fully to the noir genre’s more traditional stylings. The Hustler’s excellent lighting does wonders to make the confined locations of the film feel dynamic and exciting.\n\nCinematography Oscar winners\n\nConclusion\n\nMartin Scorsese’s long belated follow up to The Hustler, The Color of Money, made it onto our list of the best Scorsese movies.\n\nCinematography of the year\n\n15. There Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nThe oil derrick sends fire into the sky\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood is a cinematographer’s dream. It’s an incredibly visual film, and cinematographer Robert Elswit captures and delivers Anderson’s vision perfectly. The film is full of memorable visuals and sequences from start to finish.\n\nThe vastness of the desert is wonderfully captured, and sequences such as the burning of the oil derrick are truly awe inspiring.\n\nCinematography Oscar winners\n\nConclusion\n\nDaniel Day Lewis also won an Oscar for his remarkable performance in There Will Be Blood alongside Robert Elswit for cinematography.\n\nBest cinematography winners & nominees\n\n14. Fanny and Alexander (1982)\n\nAvailable in five parts on YouTube\n\nIngmar Bergman’s semi-autobiographical Fanny and Alexander stands tall as one of the best pieces from the master director’s filmography. Fanny and Alexander was initially planned and produced as a television mini-series which was divided into five parts and clocked in at over five hours in length. A film version was edited out of the mini-series which came in at a still lengthy, but more manageable three hour and eight minute runtime. This film version is what was honored at the academy awards and earned cinematographer Sven Nykvist a much deserved Oscar.\n\nCinematography Oscar winners\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether you watch the mini-series or the slimmed down film version of Fanny and Alexander, you’re sure to enjoy the experience.\n\nCinematography awards\n\n13. The Last Emperor (1987)\n\nA compilation of important moments and impressive visuals\n\nThe Last Emperor is a life-time-spanning epic biopic on the life of Pu Yi, the final emperor of China. Vittorio Storaro won a much deserved award for Best Achievement in Cinematography for his incredible work on the film, and this was far from the only Oscar won by The Last Emperor. The film also won Academy Awards for music, editing, costuming, sound design, art direction, writing, directing, and even Best Picture.\n\nAcademy Award cinematography\n\nConclusion\n\nOnly three films have won more Oscars than The Last Emperor: Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, andBen-Hur.\n\nAcademy Award for best cinematography\n\n12. Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nThe iconic Ride of the Valkyries scene with impressive aerial photography\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam war masterpiece Apocalypse Now garnered eight Academy Award nominations and won two of them: one for Best Sound and one for Best Cinematography awarded to Vittorio Storaro. This is Vittorio Storaro’s second and final entry on our list, though he did win the Best Cinematography Oscar on one other occasion for Reds in 1981. Storaro’s work on Apocalypse Now is made even more impressive by the extreme conditions under which the film was shot.\n\nAcademy Award cinematography\n\nConclusion\n\nApocalypse Now was one of the best films of the 1970s and a strong contender for any list of the best films of all time, and the film’s director, Francis Ford Coppola, made it onto our list of the greatest directors of all time.\n\nAcademy Award for best cinematography\n\n11. Days of Heaven (1978)\n\nGolden hour photography\n\nDays of Heaven was Terrence Malick’s second feature film following his 1973 debut with Badlands. Nestor Almendros won the Best Cinematography Oscar for his work on the film, and he certainly had his work cut out for him. Days of Heaven was famously shot almost entirely during golden hour, the slim window of time just before sunset and just after sunrise when the sky provides the richest light. Days of Heaven is a gorgeous film, packed with golden exteriors and beautiful views.\n\nAcademy Award cinematography\n\nConclusion\n\nBe sure to make use of as many cinematography techniques and tips as possible in your own projects, like shooting during golden hour\n\nAcademy Award for best cinematography black and white\n\n10. Schindler’s List (1993)\n\nThe introduction to Oskar Schindler\n\nSteven Spielberg’s gut-wrenching holocaust film is rich in theme, tone, heart, and cinematography. Janusz Kaminski won the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar for his stark black and white photography with the only splash of color being the little girl’s red jacket.\n\nSchindler’s List was Janusz Kaminski’s first collaboration with Steven Spielberg. The two became close collaborators and Kaminski would go on to shoot every Steven Spielberg film that followed.\n\nAcademy Award cinematography\n\nConclusion\n\nFind out where Schindler’s List ranks on our list of the best Steven Spielberg movies.\n\nAcademy Award for best cinematography\n\n9.
