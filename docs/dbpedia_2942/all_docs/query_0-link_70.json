        "text": "The year 1950 is one of the pinnacles of Hollywood’s Golden Age, reflected in the 14 Oscar nominations for All About Eve and the 11 for Sunset Boulevard (they were later ranked at 16 and 12 in the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest American movies of all time).\n\nIt was such a strong year the Academy could not find room in the best-picture category for one of the masterpieces of British cinema, Carol Reed’s Vienna-set postwar thriller The Third Man (this must rank as one the biggest Oscar snubs).\n\nHowever, The Third Man did win an Oscar for the superb black-and-white cinematography of Australian Robert Krasker, a masterpiece in the use of light and shade that was the crowning achievement of a career that included Henry V (1944), Brief Encounter (1945), El Cid (1951) and The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964).\n\nLess well known is that Krasker was a West Australian who in the years before World War II learned his craft in Paris and Dresden then went on to become a major figure in the British film industry.\n\nKrasker was not the first Australian to win an Oscar; Ken G. Hall and Damien Parer got their first in 1942 with their documentary Kokoda Front Line!\n\nBut such a high-profile win for work on a classic movie is a reminder that Australians have been enjoying Oscar success since the award was first handed out in 1929 at a private dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in a ceremony that lasted 15 minutes.\n\nIndeed, Australians are now such a regular feature of the Oscars, either through films made in this country or by contributing to Hollywood and international productions, when it was announced that George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road had 10 nominations (the second most behind The Revenant’s 12) commentators barely noted the significance of the achievement.\n\nStill, the swag of nominations for Fury Road — including best picture and best director — is the perfect occasion for a flashback, a reminder of the continuing success of homegrown talent in the world’s most important film competition.\n\nIn the year after Krasker’s win, the Sydney-born costume designer Orry-Kelly (the professional name of Orry George Kelly) collected the Oscar for his work on An American in Paris, following that up with Les Girls (1957) and Some Like It Hot (1959).\n\nOrry-Kelly was held in such esteem by Hollywood that when he died in 1964 his pallbearers included Cary Grant , Tony Curtis , Billy Wilder and George Cukor and his eulogy was read by Jack Warner (all this is covered in the Gillian Armstrong documentary, Women He’s Undressed, airing on February 28 on Foxtel).\n\nThe first Australian actor to be nominated for an Oscar was Queensland-born Diane Cilento, who was recognised for her work in Tony Richardson’s rousing Henry Fielding adaptation, Tom Jones.\n\nThe first Aussie actor to take home the gold statuette (that Bette Davis claimed she dubbed Oscar after one of her husbands) was Peter Finch, the English-born, Sydney-reared World War II veteran whose career climaxed with his hair-raising performance in Network as the unhinged news anchor who threatens to kill himself on air.\n\nFinch died at the age of 60 in 1977 becoming the first posthumous winner of an acting Academy Award. Sadly, another Australian, Perth’s Heath Ledger, was the second.\n\nWhile Finch’s famous flameout “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more!” was entering the lexicon — back in Australia our film renaissance was in full swing, with the likes of Fred Schepisi, Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir, Phillip Noyce and the king-of-the-hill George Miller winning plaudits at home and abroad.\n\nWhile our films were celebrated it was not until these future masters started making movies in Hollywood that they were acknowledged by the Academy, with Beresford getting a best-director nomination for Tender Mercies (1983) and Weir short-listed for Witness (1985), Dead Poet’s Society (1989), The Truman Show (1998) and Master and Commander (2003).\n\nBeresford has yet to win an Oscar but he should’ve had one for directing Driving Miss Daisy. In one of the great controversies of Oscar history, Driving Miss Daisy received nine Oscar nominations and won four, including best picture, but its director was not even nominated (it became known as “the movie that directed itself”).\n\nIt was also during this period that the cinematographers who also emerged during the 1970s — John Seale, Dean Semler and Don McAlpine — started to work in the US for both Australians and Americans.\n\nSeale was nominated for Witness (1985) and Rain Man (1989) and won for The English Patient (1996) while Semler won for Dances With Wolves (1990). The grand tradition of Oz cinematographers was continued by Oscar winners Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, 2001), Russell Boyd (Master and Commander, 2003) and Dione Beebe (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005).\n\nDespite the grand work of Australians behind the scenes — I haven’t even mentioned the four Oscars for costume, production and set designer Catherine Martin (The Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge) — Australia’s reputation for producing Oscar nominees and winners hit the headlines when our actors became award-season regulars.\n\nIn 1997 Geoffrey Rush became the first Australian since Peter Finch to win a best-actor Oscar for his extraordinary impersonation of Perth pianist David Helfgott in Shine.\n\nTwo years later Rush got a second Oscar nomination for Shakespeare in Love, Cate Blanchett got her first best-actress nomination for Elizabeth and Rachel Griffiths was nominated for Hilary and Jackie. In 1999, Toni Collette was nominated for The Sixth Sense and Russell Crowe for Michael Mann’s magnificent The Insider.\n\nIronically, Crowe got his best actor Oscar two years later in the much less interesting Gladiator.\n\nAfter being nominated for Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman got her best actress Academy Award for The Hours in 2002, in which she managed to create a believable character while acting under layers of make-up and a false nose.\n\nThe Blanchett juggernaut hit top gear when she won the best- supporting actress Oscar for The Aviator in 2004 then the big one, best actress, in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine last year.\n\nBlanchett, who has seven nominations and two wins to her name, is again in the mix for best actress for her amazingly subtle work in Carol playing a 1950s married mother who falls into an all-consuming love affair with a much younger woman (Rooney Mara). She’s up against the all-conquering Brie Larson (Room) but an upset is not an impossibility (Blanchett is, after all, Hollywood’s reigning drama queen).\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of the Oz-car story is the contribution of Western Australia.\n\nMost famous, of course, is Ledger, who stunned the world when he received a best supporting Oscar nomination playing a gay cowboy in Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain in 2005 then won as The Joker in The Dark Knight in 2008.\n\nBefore the Ledger phenomenon there was Western Australian Institute of Technology-trained Judy Davis, who received a best actress nomination for David Lean’s A Passage to India (1984) and best supporting actress nomination for Woody Allen’s Husbands and Wives.\n\nIt’s also worth acknowledging two WA filmmakers who made a big splash in the short-film area: Peter Templeman, who picked up a nomination for best live-action short in 2006 for The Saviour; and Shaun Tan, whose big-screen version of his beloved book The Lost Thing won the best short-animated film in 2010.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is the dark horse at this year’s Oscar, with Spotlight, The Big Short and The Revenant all slugging it out for best picture.\n\nHowever, Fury Road is so widely admired — a measure of the respect for Miller is that he will chair the Cannes jury this year — I would not write off his chase movie just yet.\n\nIf he wins it will be the biggest Aussie victory yet in a long and proud history.\n\nThe 88th Academy Awards are on February 28 (US time) and will be telecast live on February 29 at 9.30am on Nine/WIN."
