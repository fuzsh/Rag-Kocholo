        "text": "THE apogee of the pre-CGI historical spectacle “El Cid,” which belatedly arrives on DVD Tuesday, is the kind of movie they just don’t make anymore. An actual cast of thousands – and much of the Spanish Army – is on hand for this unusually literate and visually dazzling 1961 epic directed by Anthony Mann.\n\nIt stars Charlton Heston, in arguably his finest performance, as Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, who became a legendary Spanish hero dubbed El Cid (roughly, “The Lord”) by routing Moorish invaders in the 11th century.\n\n“El Cid” is the first offering in “The Miriam Collection,” a classics line from Genius Product named by owners Bob and Harvey Weinstein after their mother. Coming up are two other epics produced by Samuel Bronston at his studios in Spain, Mann’s all-star “The Fall of the Roman Empire” (essentially remade as “Gladiator”) and Henry Hathaway’s “Circus World” starring John Wayne.\n\nA worldwide hit, “El Cid” was the only major success for the Romanian-born Bronston, a wheeler-dealer who opened his Spanish studios in 1959, and who was forced into bankruptcy after the two latter films flopped.\n\n“El Cid” was stunningly photographed by Robert Krasker (“The Third Man”) who worked with Mann to fill the 70-mm Super-Technirama screen with eye-popping spectacle filmed all over Spain. One highlight is El Cid’s battle against another knight for the ancient city of Calahorra in a tournament that was photographed at the famous Belmonte castle.\n\nThe film is best known for its unique and stunning ending, in which the dead hero’s corpse is strapped to his horse – and leads a charge against the terrified Moors.\n\nIn the custom of the time, the Moors are played mainly by Caucasian actors like Herbert Lom, in blackface. But the film – largely written by Ben Barzman, a blacklisted screenwriter who was not originally credited – is notable for avoiding the unintentionally stilted dialogue of Cecil B. DeMille’s films. So did “Ben Hur,” which won Heston an Academy Award for Best Actor the year before the release of “El Cid.”\n\nSophia Loren, who won the Best Actress award the following year for “Two Women,” plays El Cid’s wife, who initially spurns him.\n\nIn an interview ported over from a 1994 laserdisc release, Heston admits there was real-life tension between him and Loren. He objected that Loren would not allow her character to age during a story that spans 30 years, while El Cid does.\n\nMore than two hours’ worth of special features includes an expansive look at the film’s making, as well as profiles of Bronston and Mann, who was mostly known for his Westerns before he went to work for the producer.\n\nA “limited collector’s edition” ($40; a two-disc “deluxe” edition is $25) includes a written introduction by Martin Scorsese, as well as replicas of the original program for the film’s road-show engagement and a comic book based on the film.\n\nBut the big drawing card is the beautiful transfer of “El Cid,” a rare spectacle that holds your interest for three solid hours.\n\nMore at blogs.nypost.com/movies"
