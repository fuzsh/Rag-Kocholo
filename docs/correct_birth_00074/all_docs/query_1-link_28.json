        "text": "AKA Allan Stewart Konigsberg\n\nBorn: 1-Dec-1935\n\nBirthplace: Brooklyn, NY\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Agnostic\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Film Director, Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Annie Hall\n\nAllen Stewart Konigsberg started calling himself \"Woody\" as a young man, when he spent most of his free time at the movies. He was always quick with a quip, and by the time he was 18 he was writing one-liners for Guy Lombardo, Danny Kaye, and Bob Hope. During the 1950s he wrote for The Tonight Show and a short-lived Buddy Hackett sit-com called Stanley. Some sources say he wrote for Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, but his name is not present in the show's credits.\n\nIn the early 1960s he wrote for Candid Camera and appeared in some of the show's gag sketches. He also began performing his own material as a stand-up comedian, exaggerating his neuroses for comedic effect. In 1965, he was hired to write the screenplay for a Peter Sellers-Peter O'Toole comedy, What's New, Pussycat. Allen used that paycheck to purchase the U.S. rights to a cheesy Japanese spy movie, dubbing in a new plot and releasing it as What's Up, Tiger Lily? Through the rest of the 60s and 70s, Allen made hilarious comedies before he decided to \"quit clowning around\" and began making more serious films.\n\nThe standard line on Allen's film career is that his early comedies were brilliant, while his later \"more serious\" films are more hit-and-miss. His best films, such as Manhattan, Annie Hall, or Hannah and Her Sisters, have elements of serious drama mingled with comedy. Allen has written and directed a new film almost every year since the late 70s, to varying critical reaction and small but consistent box office. Crimes and Misdemeanors and Mighty Aphrodite were memorable; Hollywood Ending, Deconstructing Harry, and several others were not. Still, he's widely considered one of America's greatest filmmakers, and famous actors still speak of being \"in a Woody\" as if it's the next best thing to winning an Oscar.\n\nThrough the 70s and 80s he was usually plowing his leading lady, first Diane Keaton and later Mia Farrow. In 1992 Allen and Farrow broke up, and Allen took up with Farrow's 22-year-old adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. It was quite a season for tabloid headlines, and if you were alive on planet Earth you heard the details: Farrow discovered nude photos Allen had taken of Previn while Farrow and Allen were still a couple, and she accused Allen of sexually abusing their seven-year-old daughter, Dylan.\n\nInvestigators found no evidence of abuse, but in 1996 Allen was barred from seeing then 11-year-old Dylan, whose name has since been changed to Eliza, when she made it clear to the court that she hated her father. Dylan later changed her name to Eliza and then Malone, reportedly to avoid intrusive media inquiries about allegedly being abused by Allen. Now an adult, she still maintains that the allegations are true. Allen and Dylan/Eliza/Malone's step-sister Previn were married in 1997, so Allen's ex-lover Farrow is now his mother-in-law.\n\nAllen is beloved as an artiste in France. \"First\", he says, \"they think I'm an intellectual because of my glasses. Second, they think I'm an artist because my films lose money. Neither one is true\".\n\nAllen says he spent eight years in psychoanalysis, then \"got up from the couch one day and offered my analyst a draw. We shook hands\". He legally changed his name to Woody Allen in 1952. Allen plays jazz clarinet at Michael's Pub every Monday evening, and has written six plays and four books.\n\nFather: Martin Konigsberg (jeweler, b. 25-Dec-1900, d. 13-Jan-2001)\n\nMother: Nettie Cherrie (accountant, b. 8-Nov-1906, d. 27-Jan-2002)\n\nSister: Letty Aronson (producer, b. 1943)\n\nWife: Harlene Rosen Konigsberg (m. 1954, div. 1957)\n\nWife: Louise Lasser (actress, m. 2-Feb-1964, div. 1969)\n\nGirlfriend: Diane Keaton (actress, together 1970s)\n\nGirlfriend: Mia Farrow (actress, together 1980-92, one son)\n\nSon: Ronan Farrow (human rights activist, b. 19-Dec-1987)\n\nWife: Soon-Yi Previn (Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, m. 23-Dec-1997)\n\nHigh School: Midwood High School, Brooklyn, NY (1953)\n\nUniversity: New York University (expelled)\n\nUniversity: City College of New York (expelled)\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Letters\n\namfAR National Council\n\nBill Bradley for President\n\nOscar for Best Director 1978 for Annie Hall\n\nOscar for Best Screenplay 1978 for Annie Hall (shared)\n\nOscar for Best Screenplay 1987 for Hannah and Her Sisters\n\nOscar for Best Screenplay 2012 for Midnight in Paris\n\nGolden Globe 1986 for The Purple Rose of Cairo (best screenplay)\n\nNebula 1975 for Sleeper (best dramatic presentation)\n\nPalme des Palmes 2002 (lifetime achievement)\n\nEndorsement of Foster Grant\n\nEndorsement of Smirnoff Vodka 1966\n\nDraft Deferment: Korea 4-F\n\nPolygraphed\n\nLost Child Custody\n\nJewish Ancestry\n\nRisk Factors: Claustrophobia, Marijuana\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS DIRECTOR\n\nWonder Wheel (14-Oct-2017)\n\nCafé Society (11-May-2016)\n\nIrrational Man (15-May-2015)\n\nMagic in the Moonlight (25-Jul-2014)\n\nBlue Jasmine (26-Jul-2013)\n\nTo Rome with Love (20-Apr-2012)\n\nMidnight in Paris (11-May-2011)\n\nYou Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (15-May-2010)\n\nWhatever Works (22-Apr-2009)\n\nVicky Cristina Barcelona (17-May-2008)\n\nCassandra's Dream (18-Jun-2007)\n\nScoop (28-Jul-2006)\n\nMatch Point (12-May-2005)\n\nMelinda and Melinda (17-Sep-2004)\n\nAnything Else (27-Aug-2003)\n\nHollywood Ending (3-May-2002)\n\nThe Curse of the Jade Scorpion (5-Aug-2001)\n\nSmall Time Crooks (19-May-2000)\n\nSweet and Lowdown (4-Sep-1999)\n\nCelebrity (7-Sep-1998)\n\nDeconstructing Harry (26-Aug-1997)\n\nEveryone Says I Love You (6-Dec-1996)\n\nMighty Aphrodite (13-Sep-1995)\n\nDon't Drink the Water (18-Dec-1994)\n\nBullets Over Broadway (16-Sep-1994)\n\nManhattan Murder Mystery (18-Aug-1993)\n\nHusbands and Wives (14-Sep-1992)\n\nShadows and Fog (30-Mar-1992)\n\nAlice (25-Dec-1990)\n\nCrimes and Misdemeanors (13-Oct-1989)\n\nNew York Stories (1-Mar-1989)\n\nAnother Woman (18-Nov-1988)\n\nSeptember (18-Dec-1987)\n\nRadio Days (30-Jan-1987)\n\nHannah and Her Sisters (7-Feb-1986)\n\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo (1-Mar-1985)\n\nBroadway Danny Rose (27-Jan-1984)\n\nZelig (15-Jul-1983)\n\nA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (16-Jul-1982)\n\nStardust Memories (26-Sep-1980)\n\nManhattan (14-Mar-1979)\n\nInteriors (2-Aug-1978)\n\nAnnie Hall (20-Apr-1977)\n\nLove and Death (10-Jun-1975)\n\nSleeper (17-Dec-1973)\n\nEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask (6-Aug-1972)\n\nBananas (28-Apr-1971)\n\nTake the Money and Run (18-Aug-1969)\n\nWhat's Up, Tiger Lily?
