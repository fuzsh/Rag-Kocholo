        "text": "Woody Allen is an influential American movie director, writer, actor, and musician, considered to be a creator of what is called \"intellectual comedy\". Allan Stewart Konigsberg was born in New York in 1935, in a large Jewish family originating from Russia and Austria. In the late 1950s, he began earning some money by selling his jokes and small comedy scripts, followed by him taking part in small comedy shows and stand up shows. He developed a special style of an intellectual comedian, which was something new and unusual for those times. During the late 1960s and for the further 20 years Woody Allen developed his career as a movie director. He filmed over 50 movies which brought him fame and worldwide recognition. Some of the best of his movies include Manhattan, Annie Hall, Stardust Memories, Midnight in Paris, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Match Point. Woody Allen is the winner of 4 Academy Awards, 9 British Academy Film Awards, and many others."
