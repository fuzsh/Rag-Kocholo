        "text": "For a film so steeped in music, it's no surprise that it was the music that came first. It also marks another return to the past, this time Allen's own years growing up in New York, in particular 1938-1944, during the bulk of World War II. He would have been around 8 years old, and he already had a record player and was falling in love with music. Says Allen[2]:\n\n“I wanted to do a whole movie of scenes based on memories of songs of my childhood, like Artie Shaw’s “Begin the Beguine” and Bing Crosby’s “Pistol Packin’ Mama” and “Mairzy Doats.” It was that kind of nostalgia; self-indulgent pleasure that one gets re-creating one’s childhood atmosphere.”\n\nWhat emerged was a large, ambitious, rambling script that paid tribute to the golden age of radio. It would be through his own personal experience. Says Allen[2]:\n\n“That’s what the evenings would be like. They’d be listening to the war news on the radio and my uncle and my father or my aunts and my father were playing gin rummy and my mother would be knitting and the radio would be on and you’d get reports on how the war was going on the seven o’clock news or the nine o’clock news.”\n\nAs usual, Allen would react against his previous films, rather than build on them. This time, he wanted to move away from the intimacy of his previous film, Hannah And Her Sisters. Says Allen[3]:\n\n“Hannah was a living-room picture. It becomes dull, so you look for something different to do, just to break the monotony. And so I thought it would be fun to do something that was episodic and full of music and cartoonlike and nostalgic.”\n\nFor the stories, Allen called upon many stories from his childhood. Allen's father took him to a military exhibition. Seeing his father drive a cab was also a real Allen memory. And the family, with the array of aunts and uncles, mirrors Allen's upbringing.\n\nHe also looked at real events that happened at the time. In particular, Orson Welles' legendary War Of the Worlds broadcast, the fear of German U Boats being in New York and the little girl stuck in the well. Some things, like The Masked Avenger, were generic versions of such superhero shows.\n\nAllen, or course, brushes off any calls of autobiography. Says Allen[2]:\n\n“I’m relying on information in my life, but that’s why I say it’s not autobiographical. It’s much more exaggerated to make the story better.”\n\nAllen also, as usual, lightly brushes off influences. But there is much of Italian director Frederico Fellini in the film, in particular Amarcord (1973).\n\nProduction began on 5th November 1985.\n\nAllen, as usual, made the film in New York. But with so little of New York left to match the period, a lot of work was done in the studio. Production designer Santo Loquasto created much of the sets at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, Allen's go-to film studio in New York.\n\nCasting such a big film wasn't easy, with 150 roles to fill. Casting director Juliet Taylor held open casting calls, in particular public schools in Queens for the kids. She went through her extensive files and even found people off the street.\n\nThe huge cast and ambition also made the production more complicated. Said producer Robert Greenhut[4]:\n\n“It’s not like most movies, where there`s a discernible spine--a single plot line that you can hang scenes on and, frankly, get away with less planning, because you know that, for example, the suspense can carry you through a rough patch.\n\nHere every minute had to count because he was telling so many stories. I think he is always trying to frighten himself, and that`s part of his greatness.”\n\nAllen added to the biographical nature of the story by setting the main family home in the same neighbourhood where he grew up. Yet, it was a recreation tainted by memory and time. Says Allen[5]:\n\n“I think of Radio Days basically as a cartoon. If you look at my mother, my Uncle Abe, my schoolteacher, my grandparents, they were supposed to be cartoon exaggerations of what my real-life people were like.”\n\nAnother location was the Playland amusement park. Like the amusement park in The Purple Rose of Cairo, it had closed by the time of the film's production, and torn down shortly after.\n\nThe film was full of music from the era, from swing and big band. Allen, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of this era of music and a record collection to match, was able to use big hits and rare tracks with great aplomb. Allen's usual music collaborator Dick Hyman, also helped.\n\nIn the end, a whopping 43 songs are used in the film's soundtrack, although many of them are just snippets. From Count Basie, Duke Ellington and more, it is a great introduction to the music of the era.\n\nAllen went to great lengths to make the film authentic. Above and beyond the costumes and cars, the Time Square rooftop recreated several signs that once existed. There's also a story of extras wearing 40s style garters that no one would see.\n\nMuch of Allen's original script was cut before and during production. Other scenes were shot and not used. Says Allen[3]:\n\n“That was such a hard job physically for me. It was exhausting to direct. Not all the film made the picture; originally there were 200 speaking parts. You have to do musical numbers and crowd scenes and nightclub scenes.”\n\nA number of scenes were cut, or not filmed at all. These included:\n\nA sequence involving an escape artist called The Astonishing Tonino, performing a stunt with lots of reporters and the mayor. He was played by Verne G Williams.\n\nVarious scenes of people, neighbours, men at a street corner, listening to various shows.\n\nA 'history of radio' sequence, going back to the making of the first wireless messages, the first sound recordings, and the first radio stations.\n\nMore shows including a sound effects show (featuring John Rothman), a talent hunt show and the actual Whiz Kids show.\n\nUncle Walt radio show. Based on the urban legend around kids radio presenter Uncle Don. Apparently, he made a rude comment about kids when he didn't realise he was on air, and was fired.\n\nSally's story, including her rise through a variety show called the Herbie Hanson show. Hanson was played by Steve Mittleman.\n\nSally saying goodbye to a soldier boyfriend at Grand Central Station, as part of the larger war sequence.\n\nAnother scene featured Chris Elliott, with a moustache. His entire storyline was cut.\n\nAs usual, Allen filmed many of his ideas, much of his first draft, but continued to rewrite and reshoot as the film progressed. For example, he had not locked down the specifics of Mia Farrow's character when production began. Says Allen[2]:\n\n“The first scene of hers we shot for Radio Days I did about thirty-five takes of it and she did thirty-five different voices and I looked at them all and picked one and that’s the one we used for the picture. And of course [he laughs], that scene never made the picture.”\n\nAt a reported $16 million to produce, it was Allen's most expensive film up to that point. A significant amount of the budget went to clearing the rights for all the music.\n\nOverall, Allen found the production, which lasted most of a year, many actors, locations and storylines and the many reshoots, exhausting. He would go completely the other direction for his next film, September (1987).\n\nFrench film writer and UCLA graduate Thierry de Navacelle was allowed to capture the production of Radio Days for a book, which became Woody Allen On Location (called Woody Allen, Action! in France). He was on set every day and kept a diary of the entire experience.\n\nThere is such a large ensemble cast for this film, with several who have appeared in Allen's films before.\n\nWoody Allen narrates the film, but does not appear. He would also narrate, but not appear, in Café Society (2016). He is actually uncredited for this work.\n\nSeth Green stars as Joe. This was one of his first roles, before he found fame in the Austin Powers films, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and one of the creative forces behind Robot Chicken.\n\nMia Farrow plays Sally White. This was her 6th appearance in an Allen directed film. She would return for September (1987).\n\nDiane Keaton returns in essentially a cameo role, her sixth film with Allen, and her first since Manhattan (1979). She had been working in more serious roles such as Reds (1981) for which she was nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. She would work again with Allen on Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). Allen took great care to pick a song for Keaton to sing. Says Allen[6]:\n\n“I wanted to make sure, since Diane was making one little appearance in the picture, that the song was potent.”\n\nTony Roberts is back. This was the last of five Allen films for which he would appear, although he would continue a close friendship with Allen and be seen in public together, and would appear in Allen's 2002 short film Sounds From A Town I Love. His father, Ken Roberts, was a radio announcer and his voice can be heard in the film.\n\nDianne Wiest also returns. This is her third Allen film in a row. She would return twice more, next in September (1987).\n\nAllen also cast several cameos from the golden age of radio. They included sportscaster Guy Le Bow, radio announcer Jackson Beck (who narrated Take The Money And Run back in 1969), radio singer/actress Kitty Carlisle Hart, who had not been in a film for 43 years, and future Saturday Night Love announcer Don Pardo.\n\nThe film also has several other significant acting cameos.\n\nJeff Daniels returns, having appeared in The Purple Rose of Cario (1985). He plays Bill Baxter, a name close to Tom Baxter, one of his characters in The Purple Rose of Cairo. Like much of the cast, he was only given script pages for his scenes, and was largely in the dark about the film.\n\nLarry David has a blink and you'll miss role as a grumpy neighbour. He would work again with Allen on Oedipus Wrecks (1989) and then find huge fame and acclaim with Seinfeld and then Curb Your Enthusiam. He would star in Allen’s Whatever Works in 2009. Says David[7]:\n\n“I didn’t see any cameras, so I turned to someone on the crew, and asked, ‘Where is the camera?’ And he pointed up, way up on the roof. And then, when I saw the movie, all I could see was my bald head.”\n\nWallace Shawn returns, the second of five appearances in Allen films. He last worked with Allen in Manhattan (1979) and would return next for Shadows And Fog (1991).\n\nRadio Days has earned $14,792,779 in the US.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, this is Allen’s 12th highest earning film in the US.\n\nAllen made a rare appearance to talk about one of his old films in February 2012, when he revisited Radio Days before a screening. He was joined on stage by old friend Dick Cavett and it was presented at the 92Y in New York. When asked about his feelings on the golden age of radio, Allen was typically unsentimental. He told the crowd[8]:\n\n“When you go back and hear the old radio shows so many of them were garbage. As a child I sat rapt listening to them but now there are only a few that hold up, most notably Jack Benny. But many that thrilled us as kids, you listen to now and you think “My god how could I have been enchanted by that?’”\n\nPeople who count this film amongst their favourites of Allen's are Colin Firth.\n\nVoted 304th in Empire's The 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time in 2013."
