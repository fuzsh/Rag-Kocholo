        "text": "Although you say you were never the schlemiel you have made yourself out to be, does it feel good to make films where you get the girl and all of that?\n\nI’ve had a certain amount of successes and failures in every aspect of life. My life where I grew up in Brooklyn and in Long Beach was completely average. I was a perfectly good schoolyard athlete. And I had friends and dated some girls and was rejected by others.\n\nDo you ever reflect on your situation now and say, “Wow, I’m having relationships with movie stars”?\n\nI’ve been in the movie business the last twenty years. So it’s logical that I would be seeing an actress or screenwriter or someone in my related field.\n\nMy life began being special when I was sixteen and got a job writing comedy. But even then I went to school in the daytime. I had lower-than-average marks and only went to NYU for a very short time to please my parents.\n\nI was dropped by NYU after less than one year because of bad marks. I was a film major at NYU but couldn’t even pass my major. I took what was called the limited program — three subjects.\n\nYou failed the limited program?\n\nAnd I couldn’t care less, because I’d ride the train to NYU from Brooklyn and I’d think to myself, “Don’t get off here. Keep going.” And I’d go right up to Forty-second Street, cutting school to go to the movies, hang out at the automat, buy the newspapers and go to the Paramount — and then go in to work in the afternoon.\n\nBy then you had a job and an inkling you might do well.\n\nI felt very confident. . . . And again, to please my parents, who were so crushed by this because all of my friends were becoming lawyers and doctors and going to college and doing well, I also went for a very, very short time up to City College.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nHave you changed along with your films?\n\nI don’t know that I have changed. The films have. I’ve become more interested in doing what for me is intellectually more difficult and more challenging.\n\nHow do you respond when people ask you, in effect, “Why don’t you cut the crap and just be funny?”\n\nWell, it has never really meant a thing to me what anyone said. I’m just sort of going the route I’ve chosen to go. If people like it, they like it, and if they don’t, they don’t. Crowd pleasing just never interested me.\n\nThis kind of goes back to your school days, when what teachers said apparently didn’t mean anything to you. What then do you tell the youth of America? Is it okay for them to goof off and just do what interests them?\n\nIt’s hard to give advice, in that sense. You see, I was lucky. I don’t think you can count on being lucky. I was lucky in that I had a talent to be amusing. If I didn’t have that talent, I would have been in great peril. You can only be independent that way if you luck out. But you can’t count on it.\n\nBut people have always told me what to do. And I always listened politely and I’m always nice to them, but I always do what I want to do.\n\nThe world is full of people who are quick to tell you films you should be doing and what to cut out and what to put in. There is an old proverb: “He can’t think, but he knows all about it.”\n\nOr, in more recent history, as you said on film, “Those who can’t do, teach, and those who can’t teach, teach gym.”\n\nYes, that was in Annie Hall, and I always felt people are very quick with advice, fast advice from the man on the street and profound advice from your peers. You read your books and you live your life and you see your friends and make your own evaluation as to what you want to do.\n\nPeople are forever telling me, well, don’t do this joke, or don’t dress that way, or don’t do this subject matter, or don’t do that kind of film. You don’t want to do Take the Money and Run. You want to do a different kind of film. You don’t want to do Annie Hall, you know, because it’s really less funny than Bananas. You don’t want to do Interiors because of this and that. And I always listen politely, because they are nice people, but, you know, I do what I want to do, because your body demands it. You feel it. It’s not so much a conscious decision. You go your route.\n\nHave you ever thought afterward that those people were right?\n\nThat could never be, because I’ve always done what I wanted to do at the time. This doesn’t square itself, necessarily, with commercial success. But who cares about that?\n\nI’ve done films that were not commercial successes that I think were much better than ones I’ve done that were tremendous commercial successes.\n\nFor example?\n\nI think The Purple Rose of Cairo was a much better film than Hannah and Her Sisters. Much better. Much more imaginative. It’s just a better film.\n\nRelated\n\nHow about Radio Days?\n\nIt was the best I could do at that time. As with all my films, you know, when I see it I always feel disappointed, because I have such grandiose notions at first. But when you get into the very, very difficult world of having to translate those grandiose fantasies from a piece of paper and your mind to reality, and it requires props and people and huge crews and music and everything, it’s very hard to transfer it with the same perfection that you conceive it in your mind, where everything moves beautifully. So, I’m always disappointed.\n\nHow did Radio Days fall short?\n\nWell, the concept in my mind was more glorious, was grander and more beautiful and funnier and more profound and more moving. It fell short in every important way. But this is not infrequent for me. It is quite usual.\n\nAnd when you say this, you are not being falsely modest. The fact of the matter is that when you approach something, its potential is very often tremendous. And it’s not an easy job to milk the potential from something, to realize that potential. And the more challenging the project is, a movie like Zelig, the harder it is to get the potential out of it.\n\nAs one who thinks about mortality, have you ever thought in terms of perhaps only living long enough to do ten or fifteen or twenty more films, and that they’d better be good and they’d better be this kind or that?\n\nNo, only because it really doesn’t matter to me. It wouldn’t matter to me if I stopped making films tomorrow. I’d be just as happy to write books.\n\nDo you get any enjoyment from fame?\n\nNo, I’ll tell you what I do like. The perks of being well-known are very good, because I can always get a hotel room or a plane reservation or a table in a restaurant. And you do get good service.\n\nThat’s it? You know, you really don’t have to keep doing a film a year and be compared to Bergman to get a table.\n\nYeah. One of the reasons I don’t travel more is because I’m bothered by the paparazzi. That’s one of the drawbacks of being well-known.\n\nYou’re really more free to walk around New York than you are in Rome?\n\nYes, or Paris, absolutely. There’s no satisfaction in the fame. When you’re a kid, you think there would be. But as soon as you become an adult you see that there’s nothing outside of these practical purposes like . . .\n\nGetting a table.\n\nAnd good theater tickets.\n\nIs there some way that you want to be remembered?\n\nNo. Someone once asked me if my dream was to live on in the hearts of my people, and I said I would like to live on in my apartment. And that’s really what I would prefer.\n\nForever.\n\nExactly. Nothing short of changing the human condition would be worth it. You drop dead one day, and it means less than nothing if billions of people are singing your praises every day, all day long.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nYou wouldn’t know it. It would mean less than nothing."
