        "text": "Bio:\n\nWoody Allen (born Allen Stewart Konigsberg in New York, NY on December 1, 1935) is an iconic, Academy Award director known for helming such hits as Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Midnight in Paris. He began his career as a stand-up comic in the 1950s, then moved on to plays and eventually movies. His directorial debut was the film What’s Up, Tiger Lily? in 1966, and Annie Hall — which earned Woody a Best Director Oscar — came in ’77. His career has continued to thrive, and Allen has made his mark on cinema by consistently focusing on neurotic upper-middle class academic types, often in New York City. He won the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement at the 71st Annual Golden Globes in 2014.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nWoody Allen is best known for his directorial work, but he’s also known as the man who married his longtime partner Mia Farrow’s adopted daughter. He was also accused of sexually molesting one of Mia’s other adopted children Dylan Farrow, which led to Woody becoming estranged from both Mia and his own biological son, Ronan Farrow."
