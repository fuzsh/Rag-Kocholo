        "text": "Four months after Vanity Fair special correspondent Maureen Orth published a major report with comments from Dylan Farrow, Mia Farrow and Woody Allen’s adopted daughter, about the sexual abuse she claims she faced at the hands of the Oscar-winning filmmaker when she was seven years old (charges Allen denies), Dylan Farrow has written an open letter on the subject for The New York Times.\n\nPosted on the blog of Nicholas Kristof—a friend of both Mia and Ronan Farrow’s—the letter describes in detail the ordeal she allegedly experienced as a child.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.\n\nFor as long as I could remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn’t like. I didn’t like how often he would take me away from my mom, siblings and friends to be alone with him. I didn’t like it when he would stick his thumb in my mouth. I didn’t like it when I had to get in bed with him under the sheets when he was in his underwear. I didn’t like it when he would place his head in my naked lap and breathe in and breathe out. I would hide under beds or lock myself in the bathroom to avoid these encounters, but he always found me. These things happened so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from a mother that would have protected me had she known, that I thought it was normal. I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different. I couldn’t keep the secret anymore.\n\nThe open letter arrives at the height of awards season. Last month, Allen was awarded a Golden Globe lifetime achievement honor, with his Annie Hall muse Diane Keaton accepting it on his behalf. Next month, the filmmaker stands to win another Oscar as an original-screenplay nominee for Blue Jasmine. In one notably powerful paragraph of her essay, Dylan Farrow calls attention to all of the actors who continue to work with Allen despite her allegations, including Cate Blanchett, who is the frontrunner in the best-actress race at next month’s Oscars.\n\nWhat if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?\n\nWoody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.\n\nSo imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter.\n\nAre you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?\n\nRead the complete letter here.\n\nRelated:\n\nExclusive: Mia Farrow and Eight of Her Children Speak Out on Their Lives, Frank Sinatra, and the Scandals They’ve Endured\n\nMia’s Story\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace.
