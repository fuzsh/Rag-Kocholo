        "text": "Today on Dec. 1, film legend Woody Allen celebrates his 80th birthday. However, it’s not his real birthday. He was born on Nov. 30 but chose the first of December as his birthday so he could be no. 1. After 50 years producing some of the finest films on the screen, it’s hard to argue with him.\n\nBut this success is closely linked to his willingness to miss the mark, said David Evanier, author of “Woody: The Biography.” Although Allen has churned out an impressive 46 films in as many years, not all of them were hits, and Evanier says that’s because Allen embraced failure.\n\n“His theory is if you throw enough against the wall, some of it is going to stick,” Evanier told MetroFocus Host Rafael Pi Roman. “And it’s true that every third film is quite, pretty terrific.”\n\nStill, that doesn’t mean Allen hasn’t experienced just as many lows in his life as he has highs, and Evanier dedicates a chapter to what many would consider one of the darkest points of Allen’s life: allegations he sexually abused Dylan Farrow, his adopted daughter with ex-girlfriend Mia Farrow, back in the 90s when she was seven years old.\n\nEvanier says after his own research, he personally concluded that Allen was not guilty of the actions, although a judge previously ruled evidence in the matter was inconclusive. And just last year, Dylan, now an adult, penned an open letter in The New York Times detailing the allegations.\n\nDespite this, Evanier says Allen will not be remembered for the scandals in his life, such as his affair and marriage to Soon-Yi Previn, Farrow’s adopted daughter from a previous marriage, but for his craft.\n\n“I think that his films…are timeless,” Evanier said. “And there are so many indelible moments in at least 25 of those films, so I think his legacy is of being the most productive producer and director and artist and comedian in American show business history.”"
