        "text": "Woody Allen has repeated his denial that he molested his adopted daughter, in a letter to the New York Times.\n\nThe filmmaker said Dylan Farrow had been coached to make the claim by his estranged former partner, Mia Farrow.\n\nMr Allen, 78, wrote in the newspaper, external that Dylan had been \"used as a pawn for revenge\" against him by her mother.\n\nDylan Farrow wrote last week in the New York Times that Mr Allen abused her in 1992 when she was seven years old in an attic at Mia Farrow's Connecticut home.\n\nMr Allen alleges that Mia Farrow orchestrated the \"smear\" after discovering earlier in the same year that he was having an affair with her other adopted daughter from a previous partner.\n\n\"Not that I doubt Dylan hasn't come to believe she's been molested,\" Mr Allen wrote, \"but if from the age of 7 a vulnerable child is taught by a strong mother to hate her father because he is a monster who abused her, is it so inconceivable that after many years of this indoctrination the image of me Mia wanted to establish had taken root?\"\n\nHe adds: \"Of course, I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter's well-being.\""
