        "text": "Since Previn and Allen announced their relationship in 1991, the couple has lived a peaceful and mostly quiet personal life together estranged from the Farrow family.\n\nBut in the age of #MeToo people are reconsidering Dylan Farrow’s allegation that Allen touched her inappropriately when she was seven years old — and questioning the dynamic of his relationship with Previn.\n\nThe stakes for Allen are high. In 2017, he signed a deal worth millions with Amazon for five movies — but the studio is now considering scrapping it. Actors from Natalie Portman to Timothée Chalamet have already apologized for working with him, and some have donated their salaries to Time's Up, the Hollywood nonprofit aimed at fighting sexual harassment and assault. Allen — the director and writer of more than 50 movies, many of which are considered to define the romantic comedy genre and are counted as among the greatest films of all time — may never work again.\n\nThe Allen-Previn-Farrow story is a fraught one, filled with he-said-she-said narratives and ugly legal campaigns, at once deeply personal and played out in public.\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nIn 1979, Mia Farrow and Woody Allen began their relationship\n\nFarrow ended her nine-year marriage with the composer André Previn in 1979. Later that year, she met Woody Allen, and the two started dating.\n\nThey never married, but stayed together for years. At the time, they were each at the top of their artistic powers. Farrow had starred in \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"The Great Gatsby,\" and Allen had made \"Annie Hall\" and \"Manhattan.\"\n\nTogether they had a fruitful creative collaboration as well, making movies that are considered among the best of each of their careers — including \"Zelig,\" \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" and \"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n\nBefore her relationship with Allen, Farrow had six children with Previn. She had three biological children: Matthew, Sascha, and Fletcher. She adopted Lark Song Previn and Summer \"Daisy\" Song Previn from Vietnam, and Soon-Yi Previn from South Korea in 1978. Soon-Yi's exact age, given her family background, is in dispute, but her adoption papers say she was born in 1970.\n\nThen they began a family together\n\nDuring Farrow's relationship with Allen, she took three more children into her care.\n\nIn 1980, Farrow adopted a seventh child, Moses Farrow, also from South Korea. And in 1985, Farrow adopted Dylan Farrow, a two-week-old girl from Texas.\n\nIn December 1987, Mia Farrow gave birth to her son with Allen, Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow. Now known as Ronan Farrow, he's a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist whose transformative stories about producer Harvey Weinstein, President Donald Trump, and former CBS CEO Les Moonves are central to the #MeToo movement.\n\nIn 2013, Mia Farrow said Ronan may be the child of her ex-husband Frank Sinatra, with whom she had an affair. But Allen denied the possibility. Nancy Sinatra, Frank's daughter, dismissed Farrow's comments as a joke.\n\nWoody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn began their affair in 1991\n\nBy September 1991, months after a glowing New York Times Magazine article about Allen and Farrow's relationship, Allen became close to Soon-Yi Previn and the two began an affair. Previn was about 20 at the time, just starting Drew College, and Allen in his mid-50s.\n\nIn January 1992, Mia Farrow found nude pictures Allen took of Previn in his home. She was, by all accounts, devastated.\n\nAllen was not.\n\n\"The heart wants what it wants,\" he famously told Walter Isaacson in an interview with Time magazine in 2001. \"There's no logic to those things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that's that.\"\n\nAllen said he had no moral qualms with his relationship with Previn. He said he never viewed her as his own daughter, only Farrow's.\n\n\"I didn't find any moral dilemmas whatsoever,\" he told Time. \"I didn't feel that just because she was Mia's daughter, there was any great moral dilemma. It was a fact, but not one with any great import. It wasn't like she was my daughter.\"\n\nPrevin said she and the rest of her siblings never viewed Allen as a father figure. He was her mother's boyfriend, never her stepfather, and didn't even live in their household.\n\n\"We didn’t think of him as a father,\" Previn told Vulture. \"He didn’t even have clothing at our house, not even a toothbrush.\"\n\nAllen also swatted away rumors that Previn was mentally handicapped. Previn said she has a learning disability, though, which she said Farrow was impatient with.\n\n\"I do have a little learning disability,\" Previn told Vulture. \"I've never spoken about it, because Mia drummed it into me to be ashamed about it. It comes out in spelling, and I had to work much harder in school. But I was driven and interested, and I wish I'd had a tutor the way some kids do for homework.\"\n\nIn his interview with Time, Allen also addressed the idea that his relationship with Previn was somehow reflected in his movies, which have often featured relationships in which a man is significantly older than his romantic interest.\n\n\"It's not a theme in my life,\" Allen said. \"I've been married twice, both times to women practically my age. My two other relationships — Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow — they're not really much younger women.\"\n\nHe has also argued on other occasions that it was hypocritical to criticize their age difference when Mia Farrow began a relationship with Frank Sinatra when she was 19 and he was 48. Farrow herself, he has reminded people, began a relationship with André Previn while he was married.\n\nElsewhere, Allen has said that he's had a quasi-paternal relationship with Previn as well as a more traditionally romantic one.\n\n\"I'm 35 years older, and somehow, through no fault of mine or hers, the dynamic worked. I was paternal. She responded to someone paternal,\" he told NPR in 2015. \"I liked her youth and energy. She deferred to me, and I was happy to give her an enormous amount of decision-making just as a gift and let her take charge of so many things. She flourished. It was just a good-luck thing.\"\n\nAllen and Previn married in 1997 and have since adopted two children of their own.\n\nAs Allen's relationship with Farrow was dissolving, so too was their film collaboration. In 1992 — just months after Farrow discovered Allen's affair with Previn — Allen released his final movie with Farrow, \"Husbands and Wives.\" It's a story about the dissolution of several marriages, filmed in a realistic style. Allen and Farrow filmed it between November 1991 and January 1992, as Allen carried on his affair with Previn in secret.\n\nIt was released a month after an event that destroyed Allen's relationship with Farrow forever.\n\nDylan Farrow accused Allen of sexual assault in 1992\n\nOn August 4, 1992, Dylan Farrow, then 7 years old, accused Allen of sexually abusing her while in the attic of Mia Farrow's Connecticut home.\n\nIn interviews years later, Dylan Farrow said she still found the event traumatic.\n\n\"He said, 'You can't tell anyone.' I didn't realize how careful he was — things that would happen when nobody was in the room. I was not feeling OK with him putting his thumb in my mouth, or how he hugged me,\" she said in 2013. \"There's a lot I don't remember. But what happened in the attic I remember. I remember what I was wearing and what I wasn't wearing.\"\n\nMia Farrow filmed Dylan repeating the allegation, told an attorney about it, and brought Farrow to two different doctors.\n\nSoon afterward, Allen was informed of the allegation and denied it. Allen continues to deny he sexually assaulted Dylan Farrow.\n\nAfter being told of the allegations, Allen sued Farrow to gain sole custody of Dylan and Moses — who Allen had adopted in 1991 — as well as Ronan Farrow. As he explained to Time, he believed Farrow was turning their children against him. Custody negotiations had already been going on prior to Allen's suit, but were ratcheted up in response to the assault claims.\n\n\"I was told by my lawyers she was accusing me of child molestation. I thought this was so crazy and so sick that I cannot in all conscience leave those kids in that atmosphere,\" he told Time. \"So I said, I realize this is going to be rough, but I'm going to sue for custody of the children.\"\n\nHe also repeatedly denied the assault allegation.\n\n\"Nothing at all happened. Nothing,\" he told Time. \"In light-years I wouldn't go into an attic, I wouldn't even know how to find Mia's attic. I'm a famous claustrophobic. And I would not molest my daughter.\"\n\nAllen lamented to \"60 Minutes\" that enormous amounts of attention were being paid to \"a total non-event.\"\n\n\"It wasn't as if, you know, I tickled my daughter or something and much has been exaggerated. I'm saying nothing at all. I mean, I went up and played with the kids, read them stories, did — did my usual things,\" he said.\n\nThe assault accusations and custody lawsuit led to a tangle of legal action and tabloid mudslinging that lasted years and ultimately disintegrated any chance of reconciliation between Allen and Mia Farrow.\n\nOn August 17, 1992, Connecticut state police who investigated the sexual assault allegation asked the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale-New Haven Hospital to evaluate Dylan Farrow and determine whether her testimony could be reliable in a case.\n\nThe report took seven months and eventually concluded that Dylan was an unreliable witness and that Allen had never abused her. A pediatrician on the clinic's team, John Leventhal — who didn't interview Dylan nor Mia — theorized that Dylan was emotionally unstable and that Mia coached her to accuse Allen. The team also destroyed its notes without explanation.\n\n\"We had two hypotheses: One, that these were statements that were made by an emotionally disturbed child and then became fixed in her mind. And the other hypothesis was that she was coached or influenced by her mother,\" Leventhal said in a sworn testimony. \"We did not come to a firm conclusion. We think that it was probably a combination.\"\n\nA judge said Allen's custody case 'had no merit' and sharply limited his visitation rights\n\nIn his 33-page decision on a custody arrangement for Dylan, Ronan, and Moses, Judge Elliott Wilk rejected the work of the clinic, writing that it was \"sanitized\" and \"less credible\" because of the unavailability of their notes, the refusal of several team members to testify, and the lack of supporting data for some of their conclusions.\n\nWilk said Allen's utter lack of knowledge of the basic details about the children's lives — their care, their siblings, the names of their pets or friends, or which children slept in the same rooms — disqualified him from being their custodian, and said his \"position had no merit.\"\n\nWilk wrote that Allen's divisive legal and publicity strategy in the case revealed why he wasn't fit to oversee the children.\n\n\"His trial strategy has been to separate his children from their brothers and sisters; to turn the children against their mother; [and] to divide adopted children from biological children,\" Wilk wrote. \"His self-absorption, his lack of judgment and his commitment to the continuation of his divisive assault, thereby impeding the healing of the injuries that he has already caused, warrant a careful monitoring of his future contact with the children.\"\n\nIn her testimony, Mia Farrow said Allen was \"aggressively affectionate\" toward Dylan to the exclusion of her other children, \"providing her with little space of her own and with no respect for the integrity of her body.\" Her testimony also revealed that Farrow raised the alarm about Allen's affection toward Dylan as far back as 1990. She brought it up with a child therapist at the time, and Dylan herself had been in regular therapy sessions since 1991.\n\nWilk painted a portrait of an Allen who was cold to all of Farrow's children except Dylan, with whom he spent far more time. He sharply limited Allen's visitation rights with Dylan and Ronan. He also wrote that, though Farrow herself was imperfect as a parent — possibly failing to address problems with Soon-Yi, Dylan, and Ronan — there was \"no credible evidence\" for Allen's theory \"that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi.\"\n\n\"We will probably never know what happened on August 4, 1992,\" Wilk wrote. \"The credible testimony of Ms. Farrow [and] Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.\"\n\nAt around the same time, a Connecticut state attorney, Frank Maco, said he had \"probable cause\" to prosecute Allen on charges that he sexually molested his adopted daughter. But he decided, with Mia Farrow's agreement, that dropping the case would be in Dylan's best interest. However, a disciplinary panel overseeing Maco later judged his comments to be \"inappropriate, unsolicited and potentially prejudicial.\"\n\nAllen appealed Wilk's decision twice, reaching New York's highest appeals court. Both times, the courts upheld Wilk's decisions, though they somewhat softened the restrictions on his visitation rights.\n\nFarrow expressed her gratitude to Wilk when she adopted another child in 1994, naming him Gabriel Wilk Farrow. (He later changed his name to Thaddeus.)\n\nYears later, some of Mia Farrow's adopted children contended she preferred her white kids\n\nAccording to Soon-Yi Previn, life in the Farrow household was punishing.\n\nPrevin told Vulture that Farrow was an incompetent mother with little warmth toward her. She said she largely outsourced the job of parenting to her own mother and Previn's friend's parents. André Previn and Allen, she said, were almost entirely out of the picture as far as parenting was concerned.\n\n\"We did the grocery shopping, starting in third grade, for the entire family,\" Previn told Vulture. \"Lark and I wrote the list of everything that we needed for the house, we paid for it, we unpacked it. … Lark cooked, and we cleaned the bathrooms, cleared the dishes, washed up, and did the sweeping.\"\n\nPrevin said she matured quickly and learned to be self-sufficient. She also said Farrow treated her kids differently, and that Farrow was often frustrated that Previn didn't speak English.\n\n\"Mia always valued intelligence and also looks, blond hair and blue eyes,\" Previn told Vulture. \"She tried to teach me the alphabet with those wooden blocks. If I didn’t get them right, sometimes she’d throw them at me or down on the floor. Who can learn under that pressure?\"\n\nPrevin said her adoptive mother could be abusive and domineering as well, hurting her both physically and psychologically. She sometimes slapped her across the face, called her \"stupid\" and \"moronic,\" and threw household objects at her.\n\n\"Mia used to write words on my arm, which was humiliating, so I’d always wear long-sleeved shirts,\" Previn said. \"She would also tip me upside down, holding me by my feet, to get the blood to drain to my head. Because she thought — or she read it, God knows where she came up with the notion — that blood going to my head would make me smarter or something.\"\n\nMoses Farrow has shared similar stories. In a personal essay published in May, Moses, now a family therapist, said his mother physically abused him and \"brainwashed\" him to see Allen as evil. He made similar remarks in a 2014 interview with People.\n\n\"My mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister,\" Moses said at the time. \"And I hated him for her for years. I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\"\n\nBut other children defend her as a great mother\n\nIn response to these anecdotes, some of Soon-Yi and Moses' siblings have pushed back. Dylan Farrow called Moses Farrow \"troubled\" after he published the essay and said, without evidence, that he was operating in a larger effort to discredit Allen's alleged assault.\n\n\"As I said when he last made these claims, this is an attempt to deflect from a credible allegation made by an adult woman, by trying to impugn my mother who has only ever been supportive of me and my siblings,\" she wrote. \"It's easily disproven, contradicts years of his own statements, is beyond hurtful to me personally, and is part of a larger effort to discredit and distract from my assault.\"\n\nRonan Farrow stood with Dylan and said the allegations against their mother weren't credible.\n\n\"My mother did an extraordinary job raising us, and none of my siblings with whom I've spoken ever witnessed anything but love and care from a single mom who went through hell to keep her kids safe,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"My sister's allegation is backed by a significant body of credible evidence, including physical evidence and eyewitnesses to abuse.\"\n\nAnd in a 2013 Vanity Fair article about the Farrow family, Daisy Farrow, who was adopted from Vietnam, said her mother treated all of her children the same — an assessment backed by the children's childhood tutors.\n\n\"If we got into trouble, it was no different than if a biological kid got into trouble,\" she said. \"As far as love was concerned, there was no distinction.\"\n\nRonan Farrow said his mother was attuned to each child's background and their needs.\n\n\"I am so proud of my family,\" he told Vanity Fair. \"I grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and Minh, who is blind. I could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with cerebral palsy. I saw problems and needs, so the next thing you think is: OK, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\nThe story lay dormant for 20 years — until 2014\n\nFor about two decades, the Allen-Farrow saga stayed out of the news. Allen and Previn lived their own lives; Mia Farrow and the rest of her children lived theirs. Allen continued cranking out movies at the pace of about one a year, while Farrow continued to act and shifted her focus to childcare and philanthropy work.\n\nBut after Allen won the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes in January 2014, Ronan Farrow reacted on Twitter with scorn.\n\n\"Missed the Woody Allen tribute — did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after 'Annie Hall?'\" he tweeted.\n\nIt reignited a debate about whether the industry should reward an accused child molester and how far people should go in the presumption of innocence.\n\nIt also led to the first extended comments from Dylan Farrow, now an adult and living under a different name, who excoriated the movie industry for rewarding Allen.\n\n\"Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse,\" she wrote in The New York Times. \"That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up. I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls. I was terrified of being touched by men. I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself. That torment was made worse by Hollywood.\"\n\nRonan Farrow later wrote that \"Woody Allen's PR engine\" had slowed the publication of Dylan's column, and that the Los Angeles Times declined to publish it when she pitched it to them.\n\nAllen responded a few days after Dylan's column with his own piece in The Times. He again denied the alleged abuse took place, reiterated that he believed Dylan had been indoctrinated by her mother, and criticized Wilk for issuing \"a very irresponsible opinion.\"\n\nHe also said he holds out hope that he and Dylan could mend their relationship.\n\n\"I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter’s well-being,\" he wrote. \"Being taught to hate your father and made to believe he molested you has already taken a psychological toll on this lovely young woman.\"\n\nAllen said the importance of abuse victims speaking out also needs to be weighed against the potential of making a false accusation.\n\n\"No one wants to discourage abuse victims from speaking out, but one must bear in mind that sometimes there are people who are falsely accused and that is also a terribly destructive thing,\" he wrote.\n\nMoses Farrow also came out in defense of Allen. He said his mother coached him to hate Allen and was abusive toward him. He also denied that Allen ever abused Dylan.\n\n\"I don't know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,\" Moses Farrow told People. \"Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her wrong side was horrible.\"\n\nIn a statement, Dylan Farrow dismissed any notion that her mother \"planted false memories.\"\n\n\"This is such a betrayal to me and my whole family,\" she told People. \"My memories are the truth and they are mine and I will live with that for the rest of my life.\"\n\n#MeToo further turned the public tide against Woody Allen\n\nIn October 2017, New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey published a story revealing that producer Harvey Weinstein had paid off sexual assault accusers for decades. The story was followed up by Ronan Farrow, now an investigative journalist, who wrote a series of stories in The New Yorker that expanded on the allegations. (By the end of October, more than 80 women accused Weinstein of sexual assault. Weinstein denied the allegations. He was also arrested by the New York City Police Department on the charge of rape. He is under investigation from police in Los Angeles and London, as well as New York state.)\n\nThe stories sparked a larger conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault in the halls of power.\n\nAs the national mood shifted, Dylan Farrow spoke out again. \"Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?\" she asked in the Los Angeles Times December 2017. She singled out actresses who had lambasted Weinstein but who stood behind their work with Allen.\n\n\"It isn't just power that allows men accused of sexual abuse to keep their careers and their secrets,\" she wrote. \"It is also our collective choice to see simple situations as complicated and obvious conclusions as a matter of 'who can say'? The system worked for Harvey Weinstein for decades. It works for Woody Allen still.\"\n\nAround the same time, actors and actresses who had worked with Allen said they regretted it, and that they never would again. The list includes Natalie Portman, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Mira Sorvino, Joaquin Phoenix, and Colin Firth.\n\nTimothée Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, who worked on Allen's latest and unreleased movie, \"A Rainy Day in New York,\" said they would donate their salaries to Time's Up, a legal defense fund for sexual abuse victims. Selena Gomez, who also worked on the movie, reportedly donated her salary as well but didn't publicly disavow him.\n\nMeanwhile, movie critics who had been stalwart fans of Allen, like New York Times chief film critic A.O. Scott, said it was time to reevaluate his work in light of the allegations.\n\n\"Part of the job of a critic — meaning anyone with a serious interest in movies, professional or otherwise — is judgment, and no judgment is ever without a moral dimension. Nor is it ever without a personal interest,\" Scott wrote in The Times. \"What I find most ethically troubling about Mr. Allen’s work at present is the extent to which I and so many of my colleagues have ignored or minimized its uglier aspects. A sensibility that seemed sweet, skeptical and self-scrutinizing may have been cruel, cynical and self-justifying all along.\"\n\nAnd in an interview with CBS in January, Dylan Farrow reiterated her accusation against Allen.\n\n\"I was taken to a small attic crawl space in my mother's country house in Connecticut by my father,\" she said. \"He instructed me to lay down on my stomach and play with my brother's toy train that was set up. And he sat behind me in the doorway, and as I played with the toy train, I was sexually assaulted. … He touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.\"\n\nAllen, for his part, has maintained his innocence. He said he \"should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement\" because not a single actress he's worked with in 50 years has ever \"suggested any kind of impropriety\" in his career.\n\n\"What bothers me is that I get linked in with them,\" Allen said. \"People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse. And I, who was only accused by one woman in a child custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people.\"\n\nDylan Farrow's accusation came before the child custody case, not during it.\n\nMoses Farrow continued to publicly defend Allen. In an extensive personal essay published in May, he maintained that his mother abused him and that Dylan's sexual abuse account was inaccurate.\n\n\"The fatal dysfunction within my childhood home had nothing to do with Woody,\" he wrote. \"It began long before he entered the picture and came straight from a deep and persistent darkness within the Farrow family.\"\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Mia Farrow said she and Moses were estranged.\n\n\"I guess I should be used to these attacks after 20 years,\" she said. \"But still, using my son as a weapon is new and excruciating. Also, it’s still flabbergasting that he can tell so many lies when the facts are readily available.\"\n\nThe charges threaten Allen's massive deal with Amazon — which was signed by a man accused of sexual abuse\n\nIn 2016, Allen signed a deal to make five movies for Amazon. They include \"A Rainy Day in New York,\" which cost $25 million and stars Timotheé Chalamet, Selena Gomez, Rebecca Hall, Elle Fanning, and Jude Law, and has already finished filming.\n\nAmazon's chief of programming at the time was Roy Price, who himself was ousted in October 2017 over a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nNow, Amazon may never release \"A Rainy Day in New York,\" according to Page Six, and is reportedly looking to terminate its deal with Allen, even if it means giving him a hefty payout.\n\nThe interview with Soon-Yi Previn came at the time of Allen's greatest crisis\n\nFor decades, the dispute between Allen and the Farrow family was a personal matter. It played out in the newspapers, but it never made an impact on his professional career. He has continued to release almost one movie every year, a productivity rate nearly unmatched in the modern film industry.\n\nBut with actors and actresses boycotting his movies and the deal with Amazon at risk, Previn has now come to his defense with the Vulture interview.\n\n\"What's happened to Woody is so upsetting, so unjust,\" Previn said in the interview. \"[Mia Farrow] has taken advantage of the #MeToo movement and paraded Dylan as a victim. And a whole new generation is hearing about it when they shouldn't.\"\n\nThe interview has been criticized for its author's closeness to Allen. Daphne Merkin, who wrote it, said she has been friends with Allen for more than 40 years.\n\n\"The story still included bizarre fabrications about my mother while failing to mention that a prosecutor found probable cause of abuse by Woody Allen and that he was in therapy for his unhealthy fixation on my body,\" Dylan Farrow wrote in a public statement. \"No one is parading me around as a victim. I continue to be an adult woman making a credible allegation unchanged for two decades, backed up by evidence.\"\n\nAnd New York Magazine has stood behind the article.\n\n\"Daphne Merkin's relationship to Woody Allen is disclosed and is part of the story, as is Soon-Yi's reason for speaking out now,\" it said in a statement. \"We hope people will read it for themselves.\"\n\nMerkin herself also stood by the article, telling the New York Post she hoped it was nuanced enough to stand apart from the #MeToo narrative. Merkin said Allen wished Previn turned down her request for an interview.\n\n\"It's strange how critics don’t think Soon Yi deserves to be heard, that the abuse she suffered, because it was at the hands of a woman and not a man, is somehow less valid,\" Merkin told the Post in an email. \"My intention was to let a silenced woman’s voice be heard. Far from seeing the piece as anti-feminist, I think the attacks on it are sexist (even — or especially — when made by women) and more than a tad racist.\"\n\nA representative for Allen and Previn didn't respond to comment for this story.\n\nBut if Previn's public defense of Allen is meant to turn the tide and divorce him from the #MeToo movement, it remains to be seen whether it will work. Amazon still hasn't set a release date for \"A Rainy Day in New York.\"\n\nAs for the alleged sexual abuse, it may forever remain a fraught question mark.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that Woody Allen only sued for custody of his children after Dylan Farrow alleged he abused her. However, Allen and Mia Farrow had already been negotiating custody prior to the accusations.\n\nA previous version of this article also stated that Mariel Hemingway, who starred in Allen's \"Manhattan,\" had to rebuff Allen's advances after he offered her a trip to Paris. In a 2015 interview with Hemingway, she said \"He wasn't some disgusting man who said, 'I'm coming after you.' It wasn't like that.\""
