        "text": "Allen’s exile might be a gilded one – we’ve convened at the swanky Hotel Bristol in Paris to discuss Blue Jasmine, his 44th film as a director – but there’s a sense that, two decades after his brush with tabloid infamy, when he left Mia Farrow for her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn and fought off allegations of child abuse, he’s still processing one of the cruellest whipsaws of fortune to befall a major American artist in modern times. The controversy over his and Soon-Yi’s relationship may have long since died down – they have two adopted daughters, Bechet, 14, and Manzie, 13 – but Allen and Farrow’s biological son Ronan still sends bitter tweets such as: “Happy Father’s Day – or, as they say in my family, Happy Brother-In-Law’s Day.” And the burnished cinematic love letters of Annie Hall and Manhattan have long since given way to a curt, flinty late-Allen style where characters watch helplessly as twists of fate precipitate the unravelling of their lives.\n\nOccasionally, though, Allen still hits big. His last film but one, the frothy Midnight In Paris, in which Owen Wilson time-travelled back to the Jazz Age, made over $50 million in the US alone, Allen's best-ever box-office performance there. And now Blue Jasmine is getting some of his most enthusiastic reviews in decades. His first film to be set in the US since 2009’s damp squib Whatever Works, it stars Cate Blanchett as a former Manhattan society hostess who loses everything when her financier husband (Alec Baldwin) is convicted of fraud; in the midst of emotional and mental collapse, she throws herself on the not-so-tender mercies of her working-class sister (Sally Hawkins) and her fiance (Bobby Cannavale) in San Francisco. Blanchett, straining and failing to hold herself together, is already being hailed as an Oscar front-runner, and her delight at working with Allen proves he’s still irresistible to actors. “I wouldn’t care if I was Woody’s fifth choice,” she says, in response to reports that he wrote the part with her in mind. “The fact is that I got the gig. Yes, I was thrilled and terrified when I got the call. It's like when Scorsese calls, you're going to do whatever he asks you to do and hope you won't screw it up and get the sack. Woody's genius is to put his characters in absurd situations – falling in love with the wrong person, desiring the wrong thing – yet somehow we relate to them. He always creates such interesting new archetypes.” And, she adds, he writes a lot of good, juicy parts for women: “I think he understands what fabulous, unusual, complex, volatile creatures we are.”\n\nAllen himself, at 77, seems frail on first encounter; dressed in his everyday uniform of chambray shirt and chinos, his hair totally grey but his skin oddly unlined, he hunches down in his chair and complains of deafness to the degree that my first inclination is to sit close at his right hand and move the tape machine a little nearer. But then I ask him about the parallels between Blue Jasmine's storyline and A Streetcar Named Desire – like Blanche Dubois, who Blanchett recently played on stage to great acclaim, Jasmine depends on the kindness of virtual strangers, and Cannavale sports a decidedly Stanley Kowalski-esque singlet throughout – and the similarities between Jasmine's situation and that of Ruth Madoff, ex-wife of supreme fraudster Bernie. Allen's forthright response – he's not slumping now – reminds you that his former paramour Diane Keaton once averred that he has “balls of steel.”\n\n“These are wild assumptions,” he states flatly. “Firstly, I never wanted to see any production of Streetcar after I saw Elia Kazan’s movie many years ago, because I thought that was absolute perfection and those characters should never be played by anyone else again. And I had no interest in Madoff's wife. What happened was, my own wife came home one day and told me a story of a friend of hers, who knew a woman who was very wealthy – private jets, boats, lavish parties – and it all collapsed on her after 10-12 years, with the government taking her houses and jewels and money, and she was traumatised and broken by it. I thought it was a tragic story, so I went to work on it.”\n\nHe is adamant that Blue Jasmine should not be taken as a parable for our materialistic times: “It’s just about what seems good at the moment. The next idea could be silly, or it could be profound.” (In fact, he’s just completed his next film, a “more lightweight” romantic comedy set in the south of France, with Colin Firth and Emma Stone). Nor, he insists, is he acting out some fear of losing his own mojo: “People always ask me that – do you think you’ll wake up one morning and not be funny or have writer’s block? But that wouldn’t occur to me,” he shrugs. “It’s not a possibility to me.”\n\nBy now, it should be clear that Allen, who made his name in the Sixties as a stand-up (he’s currently contemplating a return to the circuit, having recently seen a show by the 85-year-old veteran Mort Sahl) is really nothing like the nebbish, neurotic on-screen persona of his imperial phase. He’s measured, wry and surprisingly unreflective. “I keep going, I don't look back,” he says. “I feel that if I stop and think about it, I'm going to get depressed. So many films, so much wasted celluloid.” Does the maker of Manhattan, The Purple Rose Of Cairo, Hannah And Her Sisters, and Crimes And Misdemenaours – Blanchett's personal favourite of his oeuvre – really feel that? He shrugs helplessly. “I came into the film world wanting to be an artist; I never wanted to be a commercial film-maker. But the tragedy of my life is that I fell between the two stools – I never had a big audience and I wasn't a pure artist. So I struggle on, year after year, in the hope that a great film will emerge if I make enough of them. You throw enough stuff against the wall, something's eventually gotta stick, right?”\n\nThis last is no minor consideration, considering that Allen – born Allen Stewart Konisberg in The Bronx – claims to have become aware of his own mortality and the existential abyss at the tender age of five. “I remember the dark cloud descending then, and I've walked around under it my entire life,” he says matter-of-factly. “There's a neuro-biological theory that these things are imprinted, hardwired – this guy's gloomy, this one's sunny – and there's nothing you can do about it. We're not born with a clean slate, as Sartre would have you think; rather, we have a little photograph on our negative and it's how you manage that in the developing fluid. Some manage that process better than others, but the imprint is always there. So I need to work to keep my gloom at bay.” Which could explain his relentless daily routine. “I get up in the morning, get the kids off to school, do the treadmill, go into my room and write, have lunch with my wife, write in the afternoon, go for a walk, practice my clarinet, write again, and that's seven days a week, and I don't feel boxed in with that at all, because 'kicking back' is a relatively alien concept to me,” he says. Ideas – for plots, sketches, jokes – are gleaned from newspapers or conversations, scribbled on scraps of paper, and thrown in a big drawer: “Then, at the end of the year, I'll rummage through them, and some might seem very foreign to me – 'What was I thinking, a man who becomes telepathic,' and I throw it back in – but some hold up and I pursue them, broaden them out, usually on my own, but occasionally I'll ask my wife which ones she thinks sound juicier or more fun.”\n\nAllen's current peripatetic phase means that location also has to be factored into any creative consideration. His stature, and the giddy, tourist-tastic view he tends to adopt when shooting in his chosen locales, means he has no shortage of offers – the mayor of Rio de Janeiro recently implored him to set a film there, and he can barely walk down the street without someone suggesting that his next project should be Midnight In Jerusalem or Bullets Over Bogota. But Allen's conditions for setting up shop are clear and unshakeable. Financiers, whether individual or municipal, must give him complete creative control – they certainly can’t be privy to his script – and he has to feel some kind of empathy with his chosen milieu, which rules out, say, South Sudan or Ukraine, or places even closer to home. “Jasmine's sister could have lived in Pittsburgh, or Texas, but I can't,” he says flatly. “Now, I like San Francisco – I did my first ever movie there, Take The Money And Run. So I know I can work there. You know, I'm not a traveller for fun, and I'm not a curious person. If it was up to me, I'd never go any place. My wife pushes me to go to these places, because she likes to experience different countries and cultures.” He grins. “I prefer watching baseball.”\n\nIndeed, despite his world-touring, and the topicality of Blue Jasmine’s storyline, there’s a hermetic, out-of-time quality to Allen; he takes refuge in his beloved trad jazz and “older, classic” movies, continuing to play at the Carlyle Hotel every Monday night with the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band and seeking out Howard Hawks seasons at New York's diminishing supply of art-house theatres. He's never seen Mad Men, or The Sopranos. “People tell me there are wonderful, riveting things on TV,” he says, “and cable networks have made me offers to do whatever I want, but my ideas are movie ideas, not 15-episode ideas.”\n\nGiven that Allen is never satisfied – Blanchett speaks of the “exquisite agony” he exhibits on-set at hearing his lines spoken – it’s only natural that he should have regrets, but they’re not the ones you’d expect. Ageing per se doesn’t bother him – his father attained centenarian status, he says proudly, his mother lived well into her nineties, and his team of doctors (he has five) have pronounced him in rude health: “It’s more that I’m aware that my options are fewer. I can’t play the romantic lead in a movie, and I can’t flirt with girls who are 25 years old.”\n\nBut, innumerable disappointments, self-imposed confines, and caveats notwithstanding, does he at least feel lucky that he’s been able to carve out the life for himself that he has? For the first time today, Allen’s face breaks into its nearest approximation of a beam. “Oh, incredibly lucky, yes. I was thrown out of school, and I never graduated from college, so I’m not suited for anything really respectable. By sheer luck I had a talent for making people laugh, and I’ve parlayed that little gift into an entire career. If I hadn’t had that, I’d be waiting tables or trying to sell you insurance.” And on that atypically upbeat note, he’s off to prepare for Blue Jasmine’s Paris premiere amid his adoring French fans; a feted foreign film-maker, dreaming of his power shower."
