        "text": "one of the most prolific American filmmakers of his generation\n\nAllan Stewart Konigsberg was born in the Bronx on December 1, 1935. He got hooked on movies at the age of three, after his mother took him to see Snow White. He attended Hebrew school for eight years, and then public schools. Although he was a very intelligent child and was placed in accelerated classes from his first year of school, he hated school and was a rather rebellious student. He was also a pretty good athlete, playing basketball, stickball, football, and baseball; at one time he even trained as a boxer, but his parents made him stop.\n\nWhen he was about 15 years old Allan auditioned for the TV show The Magic Clown. He did a magic trick called the Passe-Passe Bottles, but because the trick featured a liquor bottle he didn't appear on the show.\n\nIn 1952 Allan began sending jokes to major New York newspapers in the hopes of getting them used by gossip columnists. A shy lad, he didn't want his classmates to see his name if the jokes appeared, so he changed his name to Woody Allen. His jokes soon became a regular part of \"Earl's Pearls,\" a column written by Earl Wilson of the New York Post. On November 25, 1952, Woody got his first credit as a writer, at the end of Wilson's column.\n\nIn 1953 Woody enrolled in motion picture production at New York University, but he lacked enough enthusiasm to attend classes regularly and was thrown out after the first semester as a failed student.\n\nEarly Career\n\nAllen got his first real job as a writer in 1955, when he was hired by NBC as part of their writer's development program. He subsequently went to Hollywood to join a writers group for The Colgate Comedy Hour. In the summers of 1956-1958, he gained invaluable experience in writing and directing at the Tamiment theater. In November 1958, he began co-writing with Larry Gelbart for The Chevy Show on NBC, starring Sid Caesar.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1968 worked as a stand-up comedian. In 1960 he was making an average of $75 per week, but by 1964 he was an estblished comic making $5,000 a week.\n\nIn 1964, Allen entered the film industry when he was hired to do the screenplay for What's New, Pussycat? (1965). He directed his first film a year later, What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966), and his career skyrocketed from there.\n\nSelected Filmography\n\nOne of the most prolific American filmmakers of his generation, Woody Allen has written, directed, and, more often than not, starred in a film just about every year since 1969.\n\nMany of Allen's films are about either a director making films or a writer, with Allen himself in the lead role.\n\nNearly all of his films start and end with white-on-black credits, set in the Windsor typeface, set to jazz music, without any scrolling.\n\nAlmost all of his films are set in New York City.\n\nWhat's New, Pussycat?
