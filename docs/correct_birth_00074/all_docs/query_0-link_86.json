        "text": "Citation preview\n\nWoody Allen For the musician with a similar name, see Hoodie Allen. Heywood “Woody” Allen (born Allan Stewart Konigsberg,[1] December 1, 1935) is an American actor, writer, director, comedian and playwright, whose career spans more than 50 years. He worked as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces. In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comedian, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes. As a comedian, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish, which he maintains is quite diﬀerent from his real-life personality.[2] In 2004, Comedy Central[3] ranked Allen in fourth place on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, while a UK survey ranked Allen as the third greatest comedian.[4] By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing ﬁlms, ﬁrst specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material inﬂuenced by European art cinema during the 1970s, and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present. He is often identiﬁed as part of the New Hollywood wave of ﬁlmmakers of the mid-1960s to late 1970s.[5] Allen often stars in his ﬁlms, typically in the persona he developed as a standup. Some best-known of his over 40 ﬁlms are Annie Hall (1977), Manhattan (1979), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), and Midnight in Paris (2011). Critic Roger Ebert described Allen as “a treasure of the cinema.”[6]\n\nAllen as a high school senior, 1953\n\nwas Ashkenazi Jewish; his grandparents immigrated from Russia and Austria, and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German.[11][12] Both parents were born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.[11] Allen has a sisAllen has been nominated 24 times and won four ter, Letty, who was born in 1943; they were raised in Academy Awards: three for Best Original Screenplay and Midwood, Brooklyn.[13] one for Best Director (Annie Hall).

Allen performs regularly as a man quite a bit in his early years.[15] He would later joke jazz clarinetist at small venues in Manhattan.[7] In 2011, that when he was young he was often sent to inter-faith PBS televised the ﬁlm biography, Woody Allen: A Docusummer camps, where he “was savagely beaten by chilmentary, on the American Masters TV series.[8] dren of all races and creeds.”[16] While attending Hebrew school for eight years, he went to Public School 99 (now the Isaac Asimov School for Science and Literature)[17] and to Midwood High School.[18] At that time, he lived in 1 Early life an apartment at 968 East 14th Street.[19] Unlike his comic Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg[1] in the persona, he was more interested in baseball than school strong arms ensured he was ﬁrst to be picked for a Bronx and raised in Brooklyn, New York, the son of and his [20][21] He impressed students with his extraordinary team.

Ac1\n\n2\n\n2\n\ncording to Allen, his ﬁrst published joke read: “Woody Allen says he ate at a restaurant that had O.P.S. prices – over people’s salaries.”[22] He began to call himself Woody Allen. At the age of 17, he legally changed his name to Heywood Allen.[23] He was then earning more than both parents combined.[20] After high school, he attended New York University, studying communication and ﬁlm. He later brieﬂy attended City College of New York and soon ﬂunked out.[24] Later, he learned via self-study rather than in the classroom.[21] He eventually taught at The New School. He also studied with writing teacher Lajos Egri.[21]p.74 His status before the Selective Service System was “4-F”, a medical deferment,[25] although he later claimed his actual status was “4-P”, hostage.[26]\n\n2 2.1\n\nCareer Comedy writer\n\nHis daily writing routine could go as long as ﬁfteen hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary. Dick Cavett was amazed at Allen’s capacity to write: “He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coﬀee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working.”[28]:551 When Allen wrote for other comedians, they would use eight out of ten of his jokes. When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.[28]:551 He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: “Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can't wait to ﬁll it! I love to do it.”[28]:551 Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as The New Yorker; he was inspired by the tradition of New Yorker humorists S. J. Perelman, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley and Max Shulman, whose material he modernized.[34][35][36][37][38] Allen has published four collections of his short pieces and plays.[39][40] These are Getting Even, Without Feathers, Side Eﬀects and Mere Anarchy. His early comic ﬁction was heavily inﬂuenced by the zany, pun-ridden humour of S.J. Perelman. In 2010, Allen released digital spoken word versions of his four books, in which he reads 73 short story selections from his work and for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[41]\n\nAllen began writing short jokes when he was ﬁfteen,[27] and the following year began sending them to various Broadway writers to see if they'd be interested in buying any. He also began going by the name “Woody Allen.”[28]:539 One of those writers was Abe Burrows, coauthor of Guys and Dolls, who wrote, “Wow! His stuﬀ was dazzling.” Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, and Peter Lind Hayes, who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes 2.2 Burrows included as samples.[28]:541 As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age nineteen, to join the NBC Writer’s Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on The NBC Comedy Hour in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, initially earning $25 a week.[22] He began writing scripts for The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, specials for Sid Caesar post-Caesar’s Hour (1954–1957), and other television shows.[21][29]p.111 By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week; with Caesar, he worked alongside Danny Simon, whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style.[22][30] In 1962 alone he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics.[28]:533\n\nCAREER\n\nStand-up comedian\n\nFrom 1960 to 1969, Allen performed as a stand-up comedian to supplement his comedy writing. His contemporaries during those years included Lenny Bruce, Shelley Berman, the team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May, and Mort Sahl, his personal favorite. Comedy historian Gerald Nachman notes that Allen, while not the ﬁrst to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redeﬁne the meaning of stand-up comedy: “He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.”[28]:525 After Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, Jack Rollins, who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested him to perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at ﬁrst, but after seeing Mort Sahl on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: “I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.”[28]:545 Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian Shelley Berman introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.[28]:545\n\nAllen also wrote for the Candid Camera television show, and appeared in some episodes.[31][32][33] Along with that show, he wrote jokes for the Buddy Hackett sitcom Stanley and The Pat Boone Show. And in 1958 he cowrote a few Sid Caesar specials with Larry Gelbart.[28]:542 After writing for many of television’s leading comedians and comedy shows, Allen was gaining the reputation for being a “genius”, says composer Mary Rodgers. When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with “reams of paper”, according to producer Max Liebman.[28]:542 Similarly, after writing for His early stand-up shows with his diﬀerent style of huBob Hope, Hope called him “half a genius”.[28]:542 mor were not always well received or understood by his\n\n2.3\n\nPlaywright\n\naudiences. Very unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to 2.3 his audiences in a low-key conversational style, often appearing to be groping for the right words, although his style was well rehearsed. He acted “normal”, dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage “personality”. And he did not improvise: “I put very little premium on improvisation,” he told Studs Terkel.[28]:532 His jokes were simply created from life experiences, with a comedic twist, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor which made them funnier: “I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.”[28]:533\n\n3\n\nPlaywright\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or even socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women’s rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a “classic nebbish”, he did not tell Jewish jokes. Comedy screenwriter Larry Gelbart compared Allen with the Broadway cast of Play It Again, Sam (1969). Allen’s style to Elaine May: “He just styled himself completely after her,” he said.[28]:546 Like Nichols and May, In 1966, Allen wrote the play Don't Drink the Water.

Feldman production What’s New Pussycat? in 1965, for which he wrote the screenplay.[8] He was disappointed with the ﬁnal product, which inspired him to direct every ﬁlm that he would later write.[8] Allen’s ﬁrst directorial eﬀort was What’s Up, Tiger Lily? (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie – Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (1965), “International Secret Police: Key of Keys” – was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967, Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof Casino Royale.\n\nCAREER\n\ntute 's “100 Best Movies” and at No. 4 on the AFI list of “100 Best Comedies.” Manhattan (1979), is a black-and-white ﬁlm often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen ﬁlms, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. The love-hate opinion of cerebral persons found in Manhattan is characteristic of many of Allen’s movies, including Crimes and Misdemeanors and Annie Hall. Manhattan focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) with 17year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), and co-stars Diane Keaton. Keaton, who made eight movies with Allen during her career, tries to explain why his ﬁlms are unique:\n\nAllen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) Take the Money and Run in 1969, which reHe just has a mind like nobody else.

There’s nobody I want to of the late Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, one of meet and nobody I want to work with—I'd rather work Allen’s chief inﬂuences. Interiors represented a departure with Diane Keaton than anyone—she’s absolutely great, from Allen’s “early, funny” comedies (a line from 1980’s a natural Stardust Memories). Woody Allen, Rolling Stone interview (1976)[27] In 1972, Allen wrote and starred in the ﬁlm version of Play It Again, Sam, directed by Herbert Ross and costarring Diane Keaton. In 1976, he starred in The Front (directed by Martin Ritt), a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood blacklisting during the 1950s.\n\n2.5 1980s Allen’s 1980s ﬁlms, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, with their inﬂuences being the works of European directors, speciﬁcally Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. Stardust Memories was based on 8½, which it parodies, and Wild Strawberries. A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy was adapted from Smiles of a Summer Night. In Hannah and Her Sisters, part of the ﬁlm’s structure and background is borrowed from Fanny and Alexander. Amarcord inspired Radio Days. September resembles Autumn Sonata. Allen uses many elements from Wild Strawberries. In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen references a scene from Wild Strawberries.\n\nThen came two of Allen’s most popular ﬁlms. Annie Hall won four Academy Awards in 1977, including Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Diane Keaton, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director for Woody Allen. Annie Hall set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes worn by Diane Keaton in the ﬁlm. In an interview with journalist Katie Couric, Keaton does not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.[50] She also explains that Allen wrote the part based on aspects of her personality Mia’s a good actress who can play many diﬀerent roles. at the time: She has a very good range, and can play serious to comic roles.

He reached an agreement to ﬁlm Vicky Cristina Barcelona in Avilés, Barcelona and Oviedo, where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie stars Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Hall and Penélope Cruz.[63][64] Speaking of his experience there, Allen said: “I'm delighted at being able to work with Mediapro and make a ﬁlm in Spain, a country which has become so special to me.” Vicky Cristina Barcelona was well received, winning Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe awards. Penélope Cruz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the ﬁlm. Allen has said that he “survives” on the European market. Audiences there tend to be more receptive to his ﬁlms, particularly in Spain, France and Italy – countries where he has a large audience (joked about in Hollywood Ending). “In the United States things have changed a lot, and it’s hard to make good small ﬁlms now,” Allen said in a 2004 interview. “The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good ﬁlms – if they get a good ﬁlm they're twice as happy but money-making ﬁlms are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million.”[65]\n\nYou Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, ﬁlmed in London, stars Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Anupam Kher, Freida Pinto and Naomi Watts.

It was released theatrically in the US on September 23, 2010, following a Cannes debut in May 2010, and a screening at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010. Allen announced that his next ﬁlm would be titled Midnight in Paris,[69] starring Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen, Gad Elmaleh and Carla Bruni, the First Lady of France at the time of production. The ﬁlm follows a young engaged couple in Paris who see their lives transformed. It debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2011. Allen said he wanted to “show the city emotionally,” during the press conference. “I just wanted it to be the way I saw Paris – Paris through my eyes,” he added.[70] It has overtaken Hannah and Her Sisters as Allen’s most successful ﬁlm at the box oﬃce in the United States.[71] Critically acclaimed, the ﬁlm was considered by some a mark for his return to form.[72] Midnight in Paris won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His next ﬁlm, To Rome with Love, was a Rome-set comedy released in 2012. The ﬁlm was structured in four vignettes featuring dialogue in both Italian and English. It marked Allen’s return to acting since his last role in Scoop.[73] Blue Jasmine debuted in July 2013.[74] The ﬁlm is set in San Francisco and New York, and stars Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Louis C.K., Andrew Dice Clay, Sally Hawkins, and Peter Sarsgaard.[75] Opened to critical acclaim, the ﬁlm earned Allen another Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay,[76] and Blanchett went to receive the Academy Award for Best Actress.[77] In 2013, in Nice, France, Allen shot the romantic comedy Magic in the Moonlight, set in the 1920s on the French Riviera[78] and starring Colin Firth and Emma Stone.[79] Allen co-stars with John Turturro in Fading Gigolo, written and directed by Turturro, which premiered in September 2013.[80] From July through August 2014, Allen ﬁlmed the mystery drama Irrational Man in Newport, Rhode Island, with Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Parker Posey and Jamie Blackley.[81] Allen said that this ﬁlm, as well as the next three he has planned, have ﬁnancing and the full support of Sony Pictures Classics.[82]\n\n7 origins of jazz in New Orleans. The ﬁlm, tentatively titled American Blues, would follow the vastly diﬀerent careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Allen stated that the ﬁlm would cost between $80 and $100 million and is therefore unlikely to be made.[83] On January 13, 2015, it was announced Allen will write and direct a half-hour television series for Amazon Studios, marking the ﬁrst time he has developed a television show. It will be available exclusively on Amazon Prime Instant Video, and Amazon Studios has already ordered a full season. Allen said of the series, “I don't know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this”, a reference to Price, the head of Amazon Studios.[84][85][86] At the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, Allen said, in reference to his upcoming Amazon show, “It was a catastrophic mistake. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm ﬂoundering. I expect this to be a cosmic embarrassment.”[87]\n\n3 Theater\n\nAllen in 2015\n\n2.9\n\nFuture projects\n\nWhile best known for his ﬁlms, Allen has enjoyed a successful career in theater, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue From A to Z. His ﬁrst great success was Don't Drink the Water, which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with Play It Again, Sam, which opened in 1969, starring Allen and Diane Keaton. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three Tony Awards, although none of the nominations were for Allen’s writing or acting.[88] In the 1970s, Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably God and Death, which were published in his 1975 collection Without Feathers. In 1981, Allen’s play The Floating Light Bulb opened on Broadway. The play was a critical success and a commercial ﬂop. Despite two Tony Award nominations, a Tony win for the acting of Brian Backer (who won the 1981 Theater World Award and a Drama Desk Award for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.[89] After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theater in 1995, with the one-act Central Park West, an installment in an evening of theater known as Death Defying Acts that was also made up of new work by David Mamet and Elaine May.[90]\n\nFor the next few years, Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, yet notable productions of his work were staged. A production of God was staged at The Bank of Brazil Cultural Center in Rio de Janeiro,[91] and theatrical adaptations of Allen’s ﬁlms Bullets Over Broadway[92] and September[93] were produced in Italy and France, reLife-size statue of Woody Allen in Oviedo, Spain spectively, without Allen’s involvement. In 1997, rumors of Allen returning to the theater to write a starring role For many years, Allen wanted to make a ﬁlm about the for his wife Soon-Yi Previn turned out to be false.[94]\n\n8\n\n5 SIGNIFICANT WORKS ABOUT ALLEN\n\nIn 2003, Allen ﬁnally returned to the stage with Writer’s Block, an evening of two one-acts – Old Saybrook and Riverside Drive – that played Oﬀ-Broadway. The production marked the stage-directing debut for Allen.[95] The production sold out the entire run.[96] Also in 2003, reports of Allen writing the book for a musical based on Bullets Over Broadway surfaced, and it opened in New York in 2014.[97] The musical closed on August 24, 2014, after 156 performances and 33 previews.[98] In 2004, Allen’s ﬁrst full-length play since 1981, A Second Hand Memory,[99] was directed by Allen and enjoyed an extended run Oﬀ-Broadway.[96] In June 2007, it was announced that Allen would make two more creative debuts in the theater, directing a work that he did not write and directing an opera – a reinterpretation of Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi for the Los Angeles Opera[100] – which debuted at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on September 6, 2008.[101] Commenting on his direction of the opera, Allen said, “I have no idea what I'm doing.” His production of the opera opened the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, in June 2009.[102]\n\nearliest televised performances was on The Dick Cavett Show on October 20, 1971.[108] Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing each Monday evening at Manhattan’s Carlyle Hotel for many years[109] (as of 2011,[110] specializing in classic New Orleans jazz from the early twentieth century).[111] He plays songs by Sidney Bechet, George Lewis, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone and Louis Armstrong.[112] The documentary ﬁlm Wild Man Blues (directed by Barbara Kopple) documents a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band, as well as his relationship with Previn. The band has released two CDs: The Bunk Project (1993) and the soundtrack of Wild Man Blues (1997). In a 2011 review of a concert by Allen’s jazz band, critic Kirk Silsbee of the L.A. Times suggested that Allen should be regarded as a competent musical hobbyist with a sincere appreciation for early jazz: “Allen’s clarinet won't make anyone forget Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard or Evan Christopher. His piping tone and strings of staccato notes can't approximate melodic or lyrical phrasing. Still his earnestness and the obvious regard he has for traditional jazz counts for something.”[113]\n\nJazz In October 2011, Woody Allen’s one-act play called Hon- Allen and his band played the Montreal International Festival on two consecutive nights in June 2008.[114] eymoon Motel premiered as one in a series of one act plays on Broadway titled Relatively Speaking.[103] Also contributing to the plays are Elaine May and Ethan Coen 5 Signiﬁcant works about Allen with John Turturro directing.[104] It was announced in February 2012 that Allen would adapt Bullets over Broadway into a Broadway musical. It opened on April 10, 2014 and closed on August 24th, 2014.[105]\n\n4\n\nMusic\n\nWoody Allen with Jerry Zigmont and Simon Wettenhall performing at Vienne Jazz Festival, Vienne, France, September 20, 2003\n\nAllen is a passionate fan of jazz, featured prominently in the soundtracks to his ﬁlms. He began playing the clarinet as a child and took his stage name from clarinetist Woody Herman.[106] He has performed publicly at least since the late 1960s, notably with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band on the soundtrack of Sleeper.[107] One of his\n\nA panel from Stuart Hample’s Inside Woody Allen comic strip\n\nApart from Wild Man Blues, directed by Barbara Kopple, there are other documentaries featuring Woody Allen, including the 2002 cable-television documentary Woody\n\n6.1\n\nMarriages and romantic relationships\n\nAllen: a Life in Film, directed by Time ﬁlm critic Richard Schickel, which interlaces interviews of Allen with clips of his ﬁlms, and Meetin' WA, a short interview of Allen by French director Jean-Luc Godard. In 2011 the PBS series American Masters co-produced a comprehensive documentary about him, Woody Allen: a Documentary directed by Robert B. Weide.[8]\n\n9 6.1.3 Diane Keaton\n\nIn 1970, Allen cast Diane Keaton in his Broadway show, Play It Again, Sam. During the run she and Allen became romantically involved and although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in a number of his ﬁlms, including Sleeper as a futuristic poet and Love and Death Eric Lax authored the book Woody Allen: A Biogra- as a composite character based on the novels of Tolstoy phy.[115] From 1976 to 1984, Stuart Hample wrote and and Dostoevsky.

In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in Radio Days and was chosen to replace Mia Farrow in the costarring role for Manhattan Murder Mystery after Allen 6 Personal life and Farrow began having troubles with their personal and working relationship while making this ﬁlm. Keaton has 6.1 Marriages and romantic relationships not worked with Allen since Manhattan Murder Mystery. Since the end of their romantic relationship, Keaton and Allen remain close friends.[118] Allen has had three wives: Harlene Rosen (1954–1959), Louise Lasser (1966–1970) and Soon-Yi Previn (1997– present). Though he had a 12-year romantic relationship 6.1.4 Stacey Nelkin and Mariel Hemingway with actress Mia Farrow, the two never married.

Her bit part in Annie Hall ended up on the cutting room ﬂoor, and their relationship, though never publicly acknowledged by Allen, reportedly began when she was 17, and a student at New York’s Stuyvesant High School.[120][121][122]\n\nAt age 19, Allen married 16-year-old Harlene Rosen.[116] The marriage lasted from 1954 to 1959. Time stated that In her memoir Out Came The Sun: Overcoming The Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction and Suicide in My the years were “nettling” and “unsettling.”[116] Family (2015), Mariel Hemingway alleged that Allen had Rosen, whom Allen referred to in his standup act as “the a crush on her at the time Manhattan (1979) was in proDread Mrs. Allen”, sued him for defamation due to comduction and shortly afterwards wanted their platonic rements at a TV appearance shortly after their divorce. lationship to turn into something more.

Farrow and Allen never married and kept separate homes.[125] In 1991, The New York 6.1.2 Louise Lasser Times opined on Allen’s family life with Farrow: “Few Allen married Louise Lasser in 1966. They divorced in married couples seem more married. They are constantly spend as 1970, and Allen did not marry again until 1997.

There was no scandal, In that case, the court decided for Allen and he continues but people refer to it all the time as a scandal to be their legal father.[137] and I kind of like that in a way because when I In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Farrow stated that go I would like to say I had one real juicy scan[130] Ronan could “possibly” be the biological child of her ﬁrst dal in my life. husband Frank Sinatra, with whom she claims to have “never really split up.”[138] On Father’s Day 2012, Ronan Farrow tweeted “Happy Father’s day – or as they call it in 6.1.6 Soon-Yi Previn my family, happy brother-in-law’s day.”[139] Soon-Yi Previn and Allen have two adopted daughters,[140] Bechet Dumaine (born c. 1999, China)[141] and Manzie Tio (born 2000, Texas).[142]\n\n6.3 Child sexual abuse allegations In 1992, Mia Farrow was given full custody of the children after the sexual abuse case was examined in court and it was determined that the abuse could not be ruled out. The judge declared, in his 33-page decision, that Woody Allen’s behavior toward Dylan was “grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.”[143] Soon-Yi Previn and Allen at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival\n\nAfter Allen and Farrow separated from their long-term relationship in 1993, a long public legal battle for the custody of their three children began. Prior to the proceedings, Dylan Farrow’s doctor reported concerns that Allen had sexually molested his adopted daughter, who was then seven years old. The police-appointed medical team concluded that Dylan “was not molested”, citing contradictory statements by Dylan.[144] The judge eventually found that the sex abuse charges were inconclusive.[145]\n\nAfter ending his relationship with Mia Farrow in 1992, Allen continued his relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. Though Allen never married Mia Farrow[125][131] and was not Previn’s legal stepfather, the relationship between Allen and Previn has often been referred to as a stepfather involved romantically with his stepdaughter[132] because she was adopted and legally Farrow’s daughter and Allen’s son’s sister. After the custody case, the New York Department of SoIn 1991, when the relationship began, Allen was 56 and cial Services closed a 14-month investigation in the case Previn around 21.

There’s no logic to those things. You meet someone and you fall in love, and In February 2014, Dylan Farrow repeated the allegations in an open letter published by Nicholas Kristof, a friend that’s that.”[133] The couple married in 1997.[134]\n\n11 of Mia Farrow, in his blog on The New York Times 's website, describing how Allen allegedly sexually abused her in the attic in their Connecticut summer home while she was playing with her brother’s train set.[147][148][149][150] Allen repeated his denial of the allegations, calling them “untrue and disgraceful”,[151][152] followed by an oﬃcial response published in The New York Times.[153] Dylan’s older brother, Moses Farrow, defended Allen, telling People magazine, “Of course Woody did not molest my sister,” saying that their mother had manipulated her children into hating him as “a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.” Dylan has denied that she was coached by her mother, and has stood by her allegations.[154][155][156]\n\n6.4\n\nPsychoanalysis\n\nAllen spent over 37 years undergoing psychoanalysis, and some of his ﬁlms, such as Annie Hall, jokingly include references to psychoanalysis. Moment Magazine says, “It drove his self-absorbed work.” Allen biographer John Baxter, wrote, “Allen obviously found analysis stimulating, even exciting.”[157] Allen says his psychoanalysis ended around the time he began his relationship with Previn, although he is still claustrophobic and agoraphobic.[129] Allen has described himself as being a “militant Freudian atheist\".[158]\n\n• Sleeper (1973) • Love and Death (1975) • The Front (1976) • Annie Hall (1977) • Manhattan (1979) • Stardust Memories (1980) • A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982) • Zelig (1983) • Broadway Danny Rose (1984) • The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) • Meetin' WA (1986) • Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) • Radio Days (1987) • September (1987) • King Lear (1987) • New York Stories (1989) • Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) • Alice (1990) • Scenes from a Mall (1991)\n\n7\n\nTheater works\n\nIn addition to directing, writing, and acting in ﬁlms, Allen has written and performed in a number of Broadway theater productions.\n\n8\n\nFilmography\n\nMain article: Woody Allen ﬁlmography Films starring Woody Allen (as an actor):\n\n• Shadows and Fog (1991) • Husbands and Wives (1992) • Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) • Don't Drink the Water (1994) • Mighty Aphrodite (1995) • Everyone Says I Love You (1996) • Deconstructing Harry (1997) • Wild Man Blues (1997) • The Impostors (1998) (uncredited)\n\n• What’s New Pussycat?
