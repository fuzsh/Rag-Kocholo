        "text": "Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn have broken their silence over HBO’s Allen v. Farrow, describing the docuseries as a “hatchet job riddled with falsehoods.”\n\nIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, the disgraced director and his wife said that Allen v. Farrow filmmakers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick “had no interest in the truth” and accused the documentarians of “collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers,” only giving Allen and Previn a “matter of days” to respond to the docuseries’ allegations.\n\nIn the first episode of the four-part docuseries, which premiered on Sunday night, Dylan Farrow, the daughter of actress Mia Farrow, speaks in detail about the allegations of incest she has leveled against Allen, who was Mia’s partner during Dylan’s young childhood. The first episode paints a picture of Allen grooming Dylan from a young age.\n\nAllen v. Farrow features unprecedented access to Dylan and Mia Farrow, interviews with Fletcher and Daisy Previn (two of Mia’s children with her late ex-husband, André Previn), and testimonies from Farrow family friends Casey Pascal and Priscilla Gilman, who corroborate Allen’s alleged inappropriate behavior toward Dylan, then a child, that is described by the mother-daughter pair.\n\nRead the full statement from Allen and Previn to THR:\n\n“These documentarians had no interest in the truth. Instead, they spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods. Woody and Soon-Yi were approached less than two months ago and given only a matter of days ‘to respond.’ Of course, they declined to do so.\n\n“As has been known for decades, these allegations are categorically false. Multiple agencies investigated them at the time and found that, whatever Dylan Farrow may have been led to believe, absolutely no abuse had ever taken place. It is sadly unsurprising that the network to air this is HBO – which has a standing production deal and business relationship with Ronan Farrow. While this shoddy hit piece may gain attention, it does not change the facts.”"
