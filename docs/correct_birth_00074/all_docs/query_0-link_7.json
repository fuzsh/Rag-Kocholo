        "text": "Born in the Bronx, New York, on December 1, 1935 at 10:55 PM EST.\n\nDuring his college days Allen wrote gags for Bob Hope.\n\nSuspended from New York University.\n\nWoody began analysis in 1959. He hasn’t stopped it since then.\n\nDiane Keaton and Allen starred together in eight movies. Mia Farrow starred in thirteen Allen movies.\n\nHas got the most Oscar nominees of all, 20 all together. Though he only won three times. In Annie Hall he was nomineed as the Best Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nHe prefers to play his clarinet at Cafe Carlyle (before 1997 he played at Michael's Pub), rather than show up at the Oscar ceremony. He thinks it’s ridiculous to compete in arts.\n\nThe Empire magazine (UK) voted him number 43, on The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list, in October 1997. He was also ranked number 89 on the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history list, in 1995.\n\nStanley Kubric’s widow claims that he wanted to use Allen in the role of Sydney Pollack’s, in the movie Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nOne of the most prolific American directors of his generation, he has written, directed, and more often than not starred in a film just about every year since 1969."
