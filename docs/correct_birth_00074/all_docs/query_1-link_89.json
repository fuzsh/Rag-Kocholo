One television feature and a series of Italian television commercials are also represented. Included are photographic prints, contact sheets, and slides of motion picture production photographs, including cast portraits and off-camera images. The material is arranged chronologically by the year of release for each film. Films represented include “Annie Hall” (1977), “Interiors” (1978), “Stardust Memories” (1980), “Hannah and Her Sisters” (1986), “Radio Days” (1987), “Crimes and Misdemeanors” (1989), “Husbands and Wives” (1992), “Bullets Over Broadway” (1994), “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995), and “Melinda and Melinda” (2004). Persons depicted include Alan Alda, Michael Caine, John Cusack, Jeff Daniels, Judy Davis, Mia Farrow, Julie Kavner, Diane Keaton, Sam Waterston, and Dianne Wiest.\n\nWoody Allen was born Allen Stewart Konigsberg in Brooklyn, New York. He is an American director, screenwriter, actor, comedian, author and playwright. He attended New York University and City College of New York. Allen’s entertainment career began as a comedy writer for other performers and for television, followed by a successful stint as a stand-up comedian in his own right. His film career was launched in 1965 with WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT? for which he wrote the screenplay and acted in a supporting role. Early screwball comedies lead to ANNIE HALL (1977), the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed film of his career. Since that time he has continued to release both comedic and dramatic films at a pace of roughly one per year, including INTERIORS (1978), MANHATTAN (1979), CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989), BULLETS OVER BROADWAY (1994), and MATCH POINT (2005). Allen has been nominated twenty-four times for an Academy Award, receiving Oscars for writing and directing ANNIE HALL and for writing HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986) and MIDNIGHT IN PARIS (2011)."
