        "text": "Even by Hollywood standards, the intrigue around Woody Allen’s personal life—and specifically, his marriage with actress Mia Farrow and the years following their divorce—has only grown with time. While there’s no shortage of celebrity scandals to unpack, it’ll come as no surprise to anyone that HBO is dropping a four-part docuseries about the controversial director.\n\nMia met the critically acclaimed actor slash director in 1979 and starred in no fewer than 13 of his films. They officially separated in 1992 after Mia discovered Woody having intimate relations with his stepdaughter and her adopted daughter. Prior to marrying Woody, Mia was also linked with musician Frank Sinatra and composer André Previn. Mia has numerous children, some biological and some adopted.\n\nMia and Woody’s explosive relationship came to an end when the actress discovered the director was having an affair with their 21-year-old adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. As the story goes, Mia found naked photographs of Soon-Yi in Woody’s apartment. Woody and Soon-Yi have been together since 1992 and have two adopted children: Manzie Tio Allen and Bechet Dumaine Allen.\n\nGiven the somewhat unconventional (to say the least) and confusing nature of the Allen-Farrow clan, here is a family tree to keep in mind while watching Allen v. Farrow, which premieres this Sunday on HBO.\n\nMatthew, Sascha, Lark, Fletcher, and Daisy Previn\n\nAfter divorcing Frank in 1968, Mia married and had twins with André\n\n(those twins are named Matthew and Sascha) in 1970. In 1973, the couple also adopted Lark Song Previn, who passed away in 2008. André and Mia had their third biological child, Fletcher, in 1975 and adopted Summer “Daisy” Song Previn in 1976.\n\nSoon-Yi Previn\n\nJust a year before André and Mia would divorce, the couple adopted Soon-Yi Previn. Soon-Yi is the child of Mia’s most cast in the spotlight, due to her having an affair with Woody while Mia was still with him. While notoriously private, Soon-Yi has come out in defense of Woody in regards to the claims of sexual assault against him and their relationship a few times over the years. She has also accused Mia of being manipulative and an abusive mother.\n\nDylan Farrow\n\nAfter her divorce from André, Mia adopted Malone—who now goes by Dylan—who was later adopted by Woody. Dylan has accused Woody, her then-stepfather, of sexual abuse, although the court has declined to rule in her favor. In her open letter to the New York Times, Dylan wrote, “For as long as I could remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn’t like.” Woody has denied the claims, insisting that Dylan was being brainwashed by her mother into the claims.\n\nRonan Farrow\n\nRonan Farrow is an American journalist most known for his exposé on Harvey Weinstein. Ronan has publicly supported Dylan’s claims of abuse against Woody and defended his mother against the attacks by the Allen camp.\n\nMoses, Tam, Isaiah, Quincy, Thaddeus, and Frankie-Minh Farrow\n\nWhile with Woody, Mia adopted Moses from Korea, and Woody co-adopted Moses in 1991. After learning of the Woody and Soon-Yi affair, Mia adopted Tam, although the Vietnamese-born girl passed away in 2000. Mia also adopted Isaiah in 1992, Quincy in 1994, Thaddeus in 1994, and Frankie-Minh in 1995. Thaddeus died by suicide in 2016, but the rest of Mia’s children—whom she raised by herself following her split from Woody—are still alive.\n\nMoses, most notably, has defended Woody against the claims of abuse and has joined Soon-Yi in alleging the abuse they faced from Mia.\n\nWoody and Soon-Yi released a statement to the Hollywood Reporter in response to the HBO doc, denying all allegations.\n\n“These documentarians had no interest in the truth. Instead, they spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods. Woody and Soon-Yi were approached less than two months ago and given only a matter of days ‘to respond.’ Of course, they declined to do so.\n\n“As has been known for decades, these allegations are categorically false. Multiple agencies investigated them at the time and found that whatever Dylan Farrow may have been led to believe, absolutely no abuse had ever taken place. It is sadly unsurprising that the network to air this is HBO—which has a standing production deal and business relationship with Ronan Farrow. While this shoddy hit piece may gain attention, it does not change the facts.”"
