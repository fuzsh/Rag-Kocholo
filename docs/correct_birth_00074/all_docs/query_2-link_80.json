        "text": "On January 1, 2018, more than 300 powerful women in Hollywood launched a movement called Time's Up, which is aimed toward ending gender imbalance and sexual harassment in the workplace across all industries. Time's Up is undoubtedly a product of the sexual harassment reckoning that happened in Hollywood in late 2017. Following the explosive exposés about Harvey Weinstein in the New York Times and The New Yorker, dozens of famous women—and men—came forward with their own stories of sexual harassment, both at the hands of Weinstein and others. For the first time ever, it feels like sexual assault survivors are actually being heard and their perpetrators are receiving consequences for their actions.\n\nBut there's one exception here: Woody Allen. In 2014, Allen's daughter Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter to the New York Times, alleging he had molested her at seven years old. Allen was never convicted of anything, but it's telling that his son Ronan Farrow has publicly stood by Dylan's side. “I believe my sister,” he wrote in an article for the Hollywood Reporter. (Ronan is also one of the journalists who broke the Weinstein story.) Dylan's accusation was first made in 1992, but little was done then—and nothing's really happened now. In fact, Allen's still very much a working director.\n\nMaybe that will end, though. Lady Bird and Little Women director Greta Gerwig, who acted in Allen's 2012 film To Rome With Love, said in a New York Times op-ed in 2018 that she wouldn't have worked with Allen had she known the allegations against him—and she won't work with him again.\n\n“If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,” Gerwig said. “I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again. Dylan Farrow’s two different pieces made me realize that I increased another woman’s pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization. I grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.”\n\nHere's a nonexhaustive list of what actors who starred in Allen's most recent films have said about him:\n\nKate Winslet (Wonder Wheel, 2017): “He understands the female characters he creates exceptionally well,” she told Sydney Morning Herald. “His female characters are always so rich and large and honest in terms of how they’re feeling, and he just knows how to write dialogue for them to communicate all that.”\n\nIn a September 2020 interview with Vanity Fair, Winslet expressed a change of heart. “It’s like, what the fuck was I doing working with Woody Allen and Roman Polanski?” she said. “It’s unbelievable to me now how those men were held in such high regard, so widely in the film industry and for as long as they were. It’s fucking disgraceful. And I have to take responsibility for the fact that I worked with them both. I can’t turn back the clock. I’m grappling with those regrets, but what do we have if we aren’t able to just be fucking truthful about all of it?”\n\nSelena Gomez (A Rainy Day in New York, 2018): “To be honest, I’m not sure how to answer—not because I’m trying to back away from it,” she told Billboard. “[The Harvey Weinstein allegations] actually happened right after I had started [on the movie]. They popped up in the midst of it. And that’s something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.”\n\nBlake Lively (Café Society, 2016): “It's very dangerous to factor in things you don't know anything about,” she told the Los Angeles Times “I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is he's empowering to women.”\n\nKristen Stewart (Café Society, 2016): “At the end of the day—Jesse and I talked about this—if we were persecuted for the amount of shit that’s been said about us that’s not true, our lives would be over,” she said to Variety. “The experience of making the movie was so outside of that; it was fruitful for the two of us to go on with it.”\n\nCate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine, 2014): “I mean, it’s obviously been a long and painful situation for the family, and I hope they find some sort of resolution and peace,” she said to Hollywood Elsewhere, via Reuters.\n\nIn March 2018, she clarified her statements:\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nDiane Keaton (Annie Hall, 1977): “I have nothing to say about that. Except: I believe my friend,” the actor told the Guardian.\n\nRebecca Hall (A Rainy Day in New York, 2018): In a statement posted to her Instagram, Hall revealed that she'll be donating her wages from A Rainy Day in New York to the Time's Up fund. \"The day after the Weinstein accusation broke in full force I was shooting a day of work on Woody Allen’s latest movie in New York. I couldn’t have imagined somewhere stranger to be that day,\" she wrote. \"When asked to do so, some seven months ago, I quickly said yes. He gave me one of my first significant roles in film for which I have always been grateful; it was one day in my hometown—easy. I have, however, subsequently realized there is nothing easy about any of this. In the weeks following I have thought very deeply about this decision, and remain conflicted and saddened. After reading and rereading Dylan Farrow’s statements of a few days ago and going back and reading the older ones—I see, not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed. That is not something that sits easily with me in the current or indeed any moment, and I am profoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today. It’s a small gesture and not one intended as close to compensation but I’ve donated my wage to Time's Up. I’ve also signed up, will continue to donate, and look forward to working with and being part of this positive movement towards change not just in Hollywood but hopefully everywhere.”\n\nTimothée Chalamet (A Rainy Day in New York, 2018): The actor revealed in an Instagram post that he cannot answer questions directly about working with Woody Allen because of “contractual obligations,” but he doesn't want to “profit” from his work on the film. Because of this, he's donating his entire salary to three charities: Time's Up, the LGBT Center in New York, and RAINN. Here's his full statement:\n\nThis year has changed the way I see and feel about so many things; it has been a thrilling and, at times, enlightening education. I have, to this point, chosen projects from the perspective of a young actor trying to walk in the footsteps of more seasoned actors I admire. But I am learning that a good role isn't the only criteria for accepting a job–that has become much clearer to me in the past few months, having witnessed the birth of a powerful movement intent on ending injustice, inequality and above all, silence.\n\nI have been asked in a few recent interviews about my decision to work on a film with Woody Allen last summer. I'm not able to answer the question directly because of contractual obligations. But what I can say is this: I don't want to profit from my work on the film, and to that end, I am going to donate my entire salary to three charities: TIME'S UP, The LGBT Center in New York, and RAINN. I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\n\nAlec Baldwin (Blue Jasmine, 2014, along with 1990’s Alice and 2012’s To Rome With Love): Baldwin took to Twitter on January 16, 2018, and said that it's “sad” and “unfair” so many actors are distancing themselves from Allen. “Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed,” he wrote. “The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it’s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.” In a second tweet, he posited that Allen could even be innocent because he's never been formally charged with anything. “This is a charge that was investigated aggressively and resulted in…nothing,” he said. “What would it take for you to at least consider that he is telling the truth?”\n\nRachel Brosnahan (Crisis in Six Scenes, 2016): Brosnahan is adding her voice to the chorus of actors who admit they regret working with Allen. “Honestly, it's the decision that I have made in my life that is the most inconsistent with everything I stand for and believe in, both publicly and privately,” she told the Hollywood Reporter. “And while I can't take it back, it's important to me, moving forward, to make decisions that better reflect the things that I value and my worldview. Look, I had a great experience working on that project. But I do have to take this opportunity to say that, for me, I have really struggled with the decision to do that project for a long time.”\n\nColin Firth (Magic in the Moonlight, 2014): “I wouldn’t work with him again,” he told the Guardian on January 18 after the publication asked him about Allen.\n\nMarion Cotillard (Midnight in Paris, 2011): “I don’t think it would ever happen because the experience we had together was very odd,” Cotillard told the Hollywood Reporter about working with Allen. “I admire some of his work but we had no connection on set.” She continued, “I didn’t know much about his personal life, actually. I knew that he had married one of his daughters, which I thought, honestly, was weird, but I cannot judge something I don’t know. But I have to say if he asked me to today I would question more, I would dig more…. I’m very ignorant about this story and I just see that it hurts to see people suffering.”"
