The Empire magazine (UK) voted him number 43, on The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list, in October 1997. He was also ranked number 89 on the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history list, in 1995.

Stanley Kubric’s widow claims that he wanted to use Allen in the role of Sydney Pollack’s, in the movie Eyes Wide Shut.

One of the most prolific American directors of his generation, he has written, directed, and more often than not starred in a film just about every year since 1969.
