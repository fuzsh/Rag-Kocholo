4 QUOTES I am not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens The talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have, instead of what you don't have. Life is divided into the horrible and the miserable

5 POEM In my next life I want to live my life backwards. You start out dead and get that out of the way. Then you wake up in an old people's home feeling better every day. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, and then when you start work, you get a gold watch and a party on your first day. You work for 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You party, drink alcohol, and are generally promiscuous, then you are ready for high school. You then go to primary school, you become a kid, you play. You have no responsibilities, you become a baby until you are born. And then you spend your last 9 months floating in luxurious spa-like conditions with central heating and room service on tap

6 ANALYSIS Slight rhyme – “out of the way…better every day” The language used in “Life Backwards” is informal and casual. The poem was written for comedic reasons
