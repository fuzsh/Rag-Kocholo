The birthplace of famous New Yorkers Al Pacino, Woody Allen, Lou Gehrig, Hip Hop culture and of course home to the New York Yankees and Arthur Avenue. I couldn't leave the Bronx off my list of type maps and now the 5 Boroughs are complete. As usual all the hoods are hand drawn and in their accurate geographic location.
