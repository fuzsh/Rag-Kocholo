        "text": "There has to be more to this story...\n\nAnyways, when I check into a hotel, the first thing they do is swipe my credit card. Skip, stay, or pay, that card is going to get charged for my hotel expenses.\n\nSo maybe his card was denied or something, but doesn't the hotel put a hold on a certain amount of funds upon checkin? So they should have known (at that time) if the card was good...\n\nLike I said, part of the story is missing....I see from a couple of websites that they they paid the $5,500 bill with a cashiers check...More details needed on this one...It doesn't say if that was before or after the fact...\n\nGood point.\n\nUnless the card went bad between the time he checked in and checked out something doesn't make sense. If the hotel didn't swipe the card upon check in then I would think that they have some of the blame.\n\nIf the establishment swiped the card and reserved the funds then I would think they would get them. If not, what's the point of using the card to guarantee the room?\n\nAlso I imagine the room would be in only one of their names, so it doesn't really make sense to me why both were arrested.\n\nYes, more details are needed before we really know what happened.\n\nI couldn`t help thinking of the scene in Total recall when Arnold yells \"I`m not Quaid!\"\n\nA little general and off the subject,several movies were filmed in Rhode Island.I talked to some people who worked as extras.They said many of the actors came off very full of themselves like they are larger than life,and are entitled to do anything they want.Not that they are all like that but I can see why people would side against them.\n\nThere may not have been a card to swipe. Stars stay at that hotel all the time. Santa Barbara is a popular getaway for the Hollywood industry. If they had been there before and were in good standing AND with their name recognition, it may have been the old fashion \"Just put it on my tab and I'll pay when I check out\". Who knows? It could have been a total miss understanding between the two parties. As you say, we need more details.\n\nWhat the hell are these people thinking!\n\nhttp://trib.com/entertainment/movies/article_39622187-cb2a-5745-92fe-f1dc53f4a06b.html"
