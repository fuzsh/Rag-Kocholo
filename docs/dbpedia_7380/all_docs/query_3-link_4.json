        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- If you ever wanted to meet Cousin Eddie, then make plans to attend Fan Expo Cleveland.\n\nActor Randy Quaid, who starred in three “National Lampoon’s Vacation” films as Ellen Griswold’s uncouth cousin and a real tomato ketchup enthusiast (”Nothing but the best!”), will appear at the annual comic con and cosplay event April 12-14 at the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland. Quaid, also known for roles in “Kingpin” and “Independence Day,” has made headlines more recently for his social media activity, which has included making false claims about the 2020 election and calling Donald Trump “the greatest president this country has ever had.”"
