        "text": "We're still in the presidential primaries stage, but next year's general election may be one of the most polarizing yet.\n\nDespite his current legal struggles—with the former president currently facing 91 charges in four jurisdictions—Donald Trump is predicted to land the Republican nomination for a second time, while President Joe Biden is expected to lead the Democrats once again.\n\nAlthough the 77-year-old has consistently railed against the \"Hollywood elite,\" he has no shortage of celebrity fans. While some are outspoken MAGA supporters, others may surprise you.\n\nHere's the full list of famous faces planning to vote for Trump over Joe Biden in the 2024 general election.\n\nBrett Favre\n\nSpeaking to Fearless podcast host Jason Whitlock in May, football star Brett Favre claimed that America was in \"better shape\" while Trump was president.\n\n\"I think Donald was a nonpolitical president, and I liked that about him,\" the 54-year-old said. \"I think if you were an American citizen, he cared about you, first and foremost. I don't know if our current president has the same mentality.\"\n\nThe former Green Bay Packer quarterback was snapped playing golf with Trump at the White House in 2020 and endorsed The Apprentice star during his second presidential run in 2020.\n\nDennis Quaid\n\nAlthough not quite as vocal as his brother—fellow actor Randy Quaid—Dennis Quaid is a fan of the former president.\n\nIn 2020, the 69-year-old praised Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, telling The Daily Beast: \"We see him on television every day, he's involved, and the travel ban early on was a great idea.\"\n\nThat same year, the Reagan star denied reports he was involved in a covert plot to re-elect the former president by taking part in a \"pro-Trump\" coronavirus campaign.\n\nJames Woods\n\nAlthough he originally backed Carly Fiorina in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, James Woods has since become a loyal devotee of Trump.\n\nOn Twitter in 2017, Woods called Trump \"a man who is willing to work for free to make his beloved country a better place.\"\n\nThe 76-year-old maintained his allegiance throughout Trump's presidency. In 2019, Woods described the entrepreneur as \"the voice of the American people,\" slamming news outlets that criticized the business mogul.\n\nAfter special counsel Robert Mueller's final report was unable to confirm Russian interference in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, Woods took to Twitter to celebrate.\n\n\"'If you try to kill the King, you better not miss.' #HangThemAll,\" he wrote in February 2020, leading to a short-term Twitter ban. When Woods account was reinstated, Trump welcomed the Videodrome star back to the site.\n\n\"Thank you Mr. President,\" Woods said. \"You and America are winning so much right now, I just couldn't miss out on all the fun!\"\n\nAfter Trump claimed the 2020 general election was rigged, the independent analysis site Just Security released a report naming the top purveyors of voter fraud misinformation. Analyzing 49 million tweets, researchers ranked Woods' Twitter account as the #1 spreader of election fraud claims on the site in late 2020.\n\nJason Aldean\n\nAnother celeb spotted golfing with Trump, country singer Jason Aldean apparently has \"nothing but good things to say about\" the former president.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, the 46-year-old said it \"wouldn't hurt my feelings\" if Trump landed the 2024 Republican nomination.\n\nThe sentiment appears to be mutual, with the business mogul playing Aldean's controversial track \"Try That in a Small Town\" at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, in July.\n\nJim Caviezel\n\nBest known for starring as Jesus in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and 2023's surprise summer hit Sound of Freedom, Jim Caviezel's conservative views have yet to put a damper on his career.\n\nDuring an appearance on Steve Bannon's The War Room in May, the 55-year-old compared Trump to the biblical figure King David. He believes the real estate magnate has been \"selected by God,\" describing him as \"pretty great.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump, people talk about how private he is about his faith,\" he told Bannon. \"He's getting it done for our Lord and savior.\"\n\nJon Voight\n\nAn Oscar-winner and father of actress of Angelina Jolie, Jon Voight was once a liberal-minded man who protested the Vietnam war and endorsed John F. Kennedy.\n\nHowever, the 84-year-old's political beliefs are very different in 2023. Now a Republican, Voight endorsed Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n\nIn August, the Oscar winner described the property tycoon as \"a man who wants to save America,\" believing that Biden's government has divided the country and thrust citizens into a \"civil war.\"\n\nIn December, quotes from Voight's 2016 interview with right-wing news site Breitbart went viral, after being misattributed to Tom Selleck.\n\n\"I pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump,\" Voight told the outlet. \"He will not let us down. I pray for all good people to see clearly what faces us now. The right vote will save our nation.\"\n\nKelsey Grammer\n\nKelsey Grammer is synonymous with Frasier Crane, the witty but pompous psychiatrist in 80's sitcom Cheers and its spin-off Frasier. The latter was rebooted in October by Paramount Plus, but Grammer's support of Trump appears to be causing publicity issues.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 4 in December, journalist Justin Webb asked the 68-year-old actor if he was still a Trump supporter. While Grammer was happy to discuss his admiration for the former president—whom he's endorsed since 2016—Webb said the Paramount Plus PR team cut his questions short.\n\nIn 2018, the staunch Republican described the then-president as a \"brat,\" but said didn't \"have a lot of problems\" with Trump's policies.\n\nLater that year, Grammer backed Trump's decision to withdraw from the G-20 climate agreement, in which 20 of the world's largest economies work together to fight global warming. The actor voted for Trump again in 2020 and told Webb that he intends to vote for the businessman again in the 2024 general election.\n\nKevin Sorbo\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, Kevin Sorbo was best known as the titular warrior in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and as Captain Dylan Hunt in sci-fi adventure Andromeda.\n\nAfter Andromeda ended in 2005, Sorbo's career began to slump, with the 65-year-old claiming his Christian faith and conservative political views led Hollywood to \"blacklist\" him.\n\nThe Capitol Hill riots on January 6, 2021, sparked a fierce argument between Sorbo and his Hercules co-star Lucy Lawless, 55, online.\n\nPosting a photo of rioters on Twitter, Sorbo wrote: \"Do these look like Trump supporters? Or Leftist agitators disguised as Trump supporters...They don't look like patriots to me...\"\n\nIn response, Lawless—who also led the spin-off Xena: Warrior Princess—commented: \"No, Peanut. They are not Patriots. They are your flying monkeys, homegrown terrorists, QAnon actors.\n\nShe continued: \"They are the d********* that go out and do the evil bidding of people like you who like to wind them up like toys and let them do their worst.\"\n\nSorbo appears to be endorsing Trump once again in the 2024 general election, posting to X in September: \"MAGAnomics: cheaper gas, cheaper groceries, cheaper cost of living. No wonder the left doesn't like it.\"\n\nKid Rock\n\nKid Rock—real name Robert James Ritchie—backed the casino chief in the 2016 general election, with the rapper-turned-country-music-singer expanding his line of merchandise to include pro-Trump merchandise.\n\nThe pair have since become friends, attending UFC bouts together and golfing at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nRock opened his Bad Reputation tour in 2022 with a personalized video message from Trump, in which the former president described the 52-year-old as \"one of the greatest entertainers of our time.\"\n\nKristy Swanson\n\nBest known for starring as the titular character in the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie, Kristy Swanson starred in several hit movies in the 80s and 90s, including Big Daddy and Higher Learning.\n\nHer career took a downturn in the 2000s, but in recent years, Swanson re-emerged as a fully-fledged Trump supporter.\n\nSwanson's response to film enthusiasts calling for Trump's cameo to be removed from Home Alone 2: Lost in New York hit headlines in 2021. The 53-year-old said if Trump's scene was removed from the 1992 Christmas movie, then she wanted her appearances removed from 80's classics Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\n\n\"If Cancel Culture is really going to have Donald J Trump removed from the John Hughes movie Home Alone, then in support of MY PRESIDENT, I'd like to have myself officially removed from the John Hughes' films Pretty in Pink and Ferris Buhler's Day Off,\" the actress wrote on Twitter.\n\nHowever, movie buffs pointed out that Swanson's parts in both films were minor. Her role in Pretty in Pink was a non-speaking character, while her turn in Ferris Bueller's Day Off only had one line.\n\nMichael Rapaport\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that Michael Rapaport was mocking The Apprentice star over his legal issues, but the former Trump hater appears to have changed his tune.\n\nDuring a November episode of his I Am Rapaport podcast, the 53-year-old actor said he would vote for Trump if Biden didn't get the Israel-Hamas \"situation under control.\"\n\n\"If it comes to pig d*** Donald Trump and smokin' Joe Biden, I'm sorry, I am sorry, voting for pig d*** Donald Trump is on the table,\" the True Romance star said.\n\n\"I'll still call him slob d*** Donald Trump, pig d*** Donald Trump and all that, but we need to get this whole f****** situation under control.\"\n\nRandy Quaid\n\nThe National Lampoon alum and brother of fellow Trump supporter Dennis Quaid voted for the former president in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\nThe 73-year-old actor also championed Trump's claims of election fraud, asking his X followers in 2021: \"I just don't see Americans rolling over for this election fraud. Do you?\"\n\nTrump retweeted the message, thanking Quaid for \"working hard to clean up the stench of the 2020 Election Hoax!\"\n\nIn August, the Golden Globe winner reiterated his love for the billionaire on social media, writing: \"I don't like politics. I like Trump.\"\n\nRoseanne Barr\n\nOnce known for her boundary-busting stand-up shows and beloved family sitcom Roseanne, these days, Roseanne Barr is more associated with the MAGA community.\n\nThe comedian backed Trump in 2016, telling the Hollywood Reporter: \"We would be so lucky if Trump won.\"\n\nWhen Roseanne was briefly revived in 2018, her character was a proud Trump supporter. After she was fired from the show for her racist tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, some theorized her adoration for the then-president factored into ABC's decision.\n\nIn 2023, her devotion to Trump has not wavered. During a recent appearance on right-wing streaming channel Real America's Voice, the 71-year-old described a meeting with the reality star.\n\n\"I lost control of myself,\" she told host Gina Loudon. The pair shared a hug, before Barr told Trump: \"We know that you're the only one with balls.\"\n\nScott Baio\n\nThe former teen idol made a name for himself starring in 80's sitcoms Happy Days and Charles in Charge. Now, the 63-year-old mainly hits headlines for endorsing Trump. Scott Baio spoke at the 2016 Republican convention and featured in a promotional video for Trump's 2020 campaign.\n\nAfter the politician lost the 2020 general election, Baio retweeted a post from the Trump campaign claiming \"It's not over.\"\n\n\"To be cont..........,\" he wrote. \"Liberals cheat and don't even care how the 'old white man' won. Republicans still have the Senate, the Supreme Court and know the truth. Peace.\"\n\nSexyy Red\n\nSexyy Red came under fire in October after praising Trump during an appearance on Theo Von's This Past Weekend podcast.\n\nThe rapper—who recently announced her pregnancy after spending the summer touring with Drake—said, \"We need people like him.\"\n\nWhen asked if she thought more Black people would vote for Trump in 2024, Red—whose real name Janae Nierah Wherry—said: \"I like Trump, yeah they support him in the hood.\"\n\n\"At first, I don't think people was f***** with him like they thought he was racist, saying little s***, and you know, against women,\" she continued.\n\n\"But once he started getting Black people out of jail and giving people their free money. Oh baby we love Trump, we need him back in office.\"\n\nHer comments divided people online, with the 25-year-old accused of leaking her sex tape a few days later to \"distract\" from the controversy.\n\nTaryn Manning\n\nFamous for starring as Tiffany \"Pennsatucky\" Doggett in Netflix's prison drama Orange Is the New Black, Taryn Manning has recently called Trump \"her hero.\"\n\nTaking to Instagram in August, the 45-year-old shared a video montage of the entrepreneur, soundtracked with Frank Sinatra's \"My Way.\"\n\n\"I am sick of hiding my truth,\" she wrote alongside the clip. \"I love you, Donny. In all your mistakes and the tool you are, you're my hero. The most un-racist human on this planet. The lies they speak about you hurt.\"\n\nThe actress claimed that \"Everything was good\" when Trump as \"the leader of the FREE WORLD.\"\n\nTed Nugent\n\nThroughout his career, guitarist Ted Nugent has been a vocal conservative and conspiracy theorist, recently causing controversy with his anti-trans views and devotion to the Second Amendment.\n\nThe rock star is also a long-time supporter of Trump. In a 2020 interview with LondonRealTV, Nugent said that Trump was \"sent here by God\" to \"drain the toxic swamp.\"\n\n\"The swamp is infested with lifetime politicians who are liars and thieves,\" he said. \"So we said, 'Fuck you. I like this Donald Trump s***-kicker. Let's put him in charge.'\"\n\nIn March, Trump claimed he was going to be arrested on social media. In response, Nugent urged fellow Trump supporters to \"remain peaceful.\"\n\n\"Put on your truck light. Put on your porch light. Carry a lantern. We need to stand strong,\" he told fans of his YouTube commentary show, The Nightly Nuge.\n\n\"If they wanna arrest President Trump, we need to not protest; we need to not put on rallies... because Antifa, Black Lives Matter and these imported Chinese nationals and Somali nationals who are coming across our open border, as orchestrated by Biden Satan gang, they are ready to do battle.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Nugent performed at a campaign rally for the former president in Waco, Texas. However, the 74-year-old's on-stage remarks—which included calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"homosexual\"—led to his show in Birmingham, Alabama, being canceled in May.\n\nYe\n\nIt may seem like an odd pairing, but Ye—who legally changed his name from Kanye West in 2021—and Trump had a brief friendship in 2022. The pair bonded over a series of phone conversations, around the time Ye was \"canceled\" due to his antisemitic remarks.\n\nIn November 2022, Trump dined with the rapper and white nationalist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nDescribing the meeting at Mar-a-Lago in a Twitter video, the 46-year-old said he planned to run for office in 2024 with Trump as his vice president. However, the politician responded by \"screaming\" at him, telling Ye he would lose.\n\nAt the time of the get-together, Trump claimed to not know Fuentes's history. Still, the meal led to a barrage of criticism and fractured his budding friendship with Ye."
