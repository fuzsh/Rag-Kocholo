        "text": "For Timeline Inconsistencies, See: Continuity Errors for further details.\n\nThis article is for the timeline of the films only, not the TV series. For the TV series timeline, click here.\n\nThe timeline in the Scream universe refers to character births, and events depicted in the franchise, which occur before and after events of the original film. Due to several instances of retroactive continuity and continuity errors, there are occasional gaps and assumptions to be made. The first section refers to a general basis of \"rules\" on what is validated in timeline events, and the subsequent section refers to the series of events in order.\n\nRules\n\nResolving Technicalities\n\nThe 30th birthday of Roman Bridger potentially conflicts with finding Maureen \"four years ago\", as it indicates four years have passed since her 1995 murder (when majority of production for the third film occurred, it was the year 1999). When referring to John Milton's Hollywood parties, he states \"it was the (19)70s, everything was different\", making the logical assumption for it to be a minimum of five years ago. Due to the production of the third film suffering with scripts being written day-by-day during filming, this is one of a few notable continuity errors.\n\nBy real-world logic, a pregnancy is 42 weeks, and Maureen would have conceived Roman via rape in 1969. However, it is also possible, given we know it was a two-year period for Maureen to be a Hollywood actress, Milton is referring to the allegations where \"no charges were brought\", when she came to confront it as early as 1970.\n\nAdditionally, Roman's four-year track can be an approximate timeframe, if we consider the film occurs on its release date (February 2000), 5 months after the 4-year anniversary of her murder; it would be an approximate 4 year and a half period prior, where Roman stalked Maureen (as early as one month prior to her murder).\n\nThis contradicts the bulletin posts of filming dates indicating the film occurs in the summer (when Sarah Darling goes for a meeting). In this case, background filming dates are generally ignored, as they often contradict on-screen dialogue (such as Himbry's office showing an out-of-focus calendar of April 1996, Scream 2 stating Stab is released in April 1997, etc.).\n\nAssumptions\n\nOther assumptions made are ages fitted to real-world requirement ages, such as the age of a high school graduation senior or the actors matching a relatively similar age range, unless stated or strongly implied otherwise. For example, if the characters are seniors in a film set in late-1996, it is generally assumed they are born between September 1978 and August 1979, the California cut-off age of birth for the time period when the film occurred.\n\nA future film may reinvent this rule, and state Woodsboro High has a unique age-based system that cuts off year-by-year. However, for the purpose of real-world logic, it is generally best to stay consistent.\n\nOther assumptions made include the ages of the Scream 4 characters. Unlike their predecessors and successors, they are not explicitly stated to be seniors in the final cut of the film. An extended ending reveals Jill Roberts is 17. However, a future film may retroactively decide Jill is younger i.e 15 years old. This technically would not violate continuity either, as it is generally assumed, based on script reference and dialogue in a deleted scene, for it to be canon.\n\nSome divergences are made from script references if considerably older actors are cast, such as Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell for much younger described characters in a script, or Richie Kirsch, who was promoted as being around 25, but the film makes several inferences to him being a millennial in the final cut (like actor, Jack Quaid, who shot the film at age 28). As such, Richie is generally regarded as having an early-90s, late-millennial birth instead.\n\nPre-series timeline\n\nThe following documents the timeline of events depicted prior to the events in the Scream film franchise:\n\n1930s\n\napprox. 1939: Fred, the janitor of Woodsboro High School was born.\n\n1940s—1950s\n\napprox. 1940s:\n\nMr. Becker is born, husband of Mrs. Becker, father of Casey Becker.\n\nMrs. Tate is born, Woodsboro High English teacher (in absentia since the first film).\n\n1940: Gus Gold is born.\n\n1941: Sheriff Burke is born.\n\n1946: Arthur Himbry is born.\n\nLate-1950: Maureen Roberts (later Prescott) was born in Woodsboro, California.

Roman turns 30 in the movie's events in Scream 3).\n\n1971: Dewey Riley is born to Mrs. Riley and an unknown father, older brother of Tatum Riley.\n\n1972—1978: Maureen and Neil Prescott date and marry.

(Sidney is 17 in Scream, turns 18 before Woodsboro High Class of 1997 graduation, turns 19 before the events of Scream 2 as a freshman, is one month shy of 22 in Scream 3, 32 in Scream 4, 42 in Scream 5).\n\napprox. late-1970s: Majority of Windsor College Alumni, Class of 2000-2001 is born including:\n\nLois (nee unknown) is born to unknown parents (later an Omega Beta Zeta)\n\nMurphy (nee unknown) is born to unknown parents (later an Omega Beta Zeta).\n\nDawnie (nee unknown) is born (Omega Beta Zeta).\n\nCory Gillis is born (Sidney's first prank caller, despite being off-screen, shown on-screen, shown on caller ID).\n\nPaul (no relation to Paul 2.0, unless stated; last name unknown) is born (Randy's roommate at Windsor College).\n\nTed is born (Cici Cooper's boyfriend).\n\napprox. 1978—1979:\n\nCici Cooper and Derek Feldman are born. (Freshman students and Windsor College, Ohio Alumni of 2001.)\n\n1978: Tyson Fox is born.\n\n1979: Angelina Tyler is born.\n\n1980s\n\nMid-late 1982: Martha Meeks, Randy's younger sister, is born.

This includes Robbie Mercer, Trevor Sheldon, Kirby Reed, Olivia Morris, Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper are born. They were toddlers at\n\nSeptember 1, 1993 - Charlie Walker Is born to his unnamed parents.\n\napprox. mid-1990s: Danny Brackett is born.\n\nJuly 29, 1993: Jill Roberts is born to Maureen's younger sister, Kate Roberts and an unknown man.\n\napprox. 1994: Richie Kirsch is born to Wayne Bailey and an unnamed mother.\n\napprox. September 1994: Billy and Sidney start dating as sophomores in high school.\n\nApprox. September 1995: Roman Bridger (mid-20s) tracks down Maureen Prescott, but she spurns him. He stalks her and records her affairs; one of them being Billy's father. Roman uses the evidence to convince Billy Loomis to murder Maureen.\n\n1995: Maureen has had affairs; Hank Loomis and Cotton Weary being definite affairs within the year. Nancy Loomis finds out and leaves Hank, despairing Billy.\n\nThursday 28, September 1995: Billy peer pressures Stu Macher, and the two kill 44-year-old housewife, Maureen Prescott and frame Cotton Weary. (One year before the events of Scream).\n\nBetween September 1995 and September 1996:\n\nCotton Weary is arrested for the murder of Maureen and later convicted of first-degree murder.\n\nSidney testifies in court as a key witness, but Gale Weathers is skeptical, writing stories against her.\n\nLate-1995 or early-1996: Gale writes her first known book, Wrongly Accused: The Murder of Maureen Prescott.\n\nSeptember 1996: Gale is planning to write a soon-scrapped follow-up book to The Murder of Maureen Prescott. (Planned release date \"later this year\", which would be by the end of 1996).\n\nLate-1995—June 1996 (Junior year) or late-1996—June 1997 (senior year): Sidney plays Tiger Lily and Judy Hicks plays a Lost Boy in Woodsboro High's theatre production of Peter Pan.\n\nThis theatre event could have only taken place in either Sidney's sophomore or senior year, given Judy's commentary that she had \"a lot of stuff going on\" relates to either Maureen's murder trial pre-Scream (1996) or the Ghostface murders one year after.\n\nPossible (likely) senior production (late 1996—June 1997): Sidney is able to recall Casey Becker clearly despite being a relative stranger who sat beside her in English class. She has a strong friendship circle also.\n\nIn the early stages of the original film amid Casey's murder news, Sidney appears functional and simply grieving her mother's loss quietly almost one year on exactly (though her emotional state between this time is unaccounted for).\n\nAdditionally, this is during the time she believes Cotton Weary, her mother's alleged killer, has been either brought to justice and awaits death row or arrested and awaiting trial. \"a lot\" also indicates an accumulation of struggles, referring to the media frenzy of both the Ghostface phenomena, her rise to fame and the Ghostface killing spree of 1996's connection to Maureen's murder).\n\nPossible Junior year production (late-1995—June 1996): Despite this, however, Sidney's adamancy in her testimony against Cotton does not underscore her initial trauma stemming from her mother's murder (including Gale's stories against her); Hicks could have simply been referring to these events alone.\n\nApprox. August 1996- During the summer after their Junior year, Billy cheats on Sidney with fellow high schooler Christina, who was a sophomore when they met and conceived Samantha.\n\nChristina (née unknown) is pregnant for approximately 42 weeks. However, it is Billy Loomis' child, not her boyfriend's (unnamed forename, surname Carpenter).\n\nIt's likely that Billy knew about Christina being pregnant, but however decided not to become involved as Sidney would find out, and his plan with Stu would've been over. Which would imply that Christina pretended that Sam was her current boyfriend's baby and went along with it until Sam found out the truth about her real father.\n\nIt's unclear if Christina is the only girl Billy cheated on when he was with Sidney, since there is a scene in the movie where he is flirting with a bunch of girls in the movie store.\n\nScream (film series) timeline\n\n1996\n\nSee Above: Pre-Scream (1996) information on Maureen's murder, Cotton's trial, birth dates, relationships, etc.\n\nThe following documents the timeline of events depicted in the Scream film franchise:\n\nCalendar Week: Sunday, 22 September—Saturday, 28 September (Corresponding with Scream 5).\n\n25—28th September 1996: The events of Scream (1996 film). The continuation of the Woodsboro Murders, three calendar days shy of one full year after its first murder in 1995.\n\nBegins on a late-Wednesday night after 10pm. (According to Tatum Riley, Casey and Steve didn't \"bite it till after 10\"). Possible opening sequence aftermath featuring Billy and Sidney is a prelude to the killing.\n\nNeil Prescott's flight leaves early Thursday morning. He intended to go on an international business expo until Sunday morning, stating it will last through the whole weekend, meaning he will miss the next\n\nEnds on a Saturday morning. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher are killed by Sidney one year after their first murder, killing her mother. She avenges her mother on the exact one-year anniversary of her murder. Billy confirms it has been exactly one year by midnight, and both men die one calendar day after Tatum Riley, Kenny Brown and Arthur Himbry.\n\nSeptember 1996—June 1998\n\nPost-Scream, pre-Scream 2\n\nSeptember 1996—September 1997:\n\nMr. Carpenter proposes to Christina Carpenter in their senior year of high school.\n\nAn oblivious new grandmother-to-be, Nancy, grieves the loss of her son, Billy and loses weight and gets plastic surgery. She conspires for a copycat killing spree, set for 1998.\n\nMay—July 1997 (approx. graduation month timeframes): Senior students at Woodsboro High, Judy, Randy and Sidney are approx. all 18 (or about to in summer 1997) and graduate from Woodsboro High. See more: Woodsboro High Class of 1997.\n\nMay 19, 1997: Samantha Carpenter, preferably known as Sam, is born to teenage mother, Christina.\n\nAugust—September 1997: Sidney and Randy decide to move to Ohio together and start over. Judy Hicks stays in California.\n\n1997: Gale Weathers publishes a best-selling novel, The Woodsboro Murders based on the six murders occurring between September 1995 and 1996 killings.\n\n1997: Sunrise Studios gives a horror film named Stab, based on the true events of the Woodsboro Murders (1995—1996) and its novelization the greenlight.\n\n1997: Stab begins principal photography. It's casting includes Tori Spelling, Jennifer Jolie among others.\n\n1997: Fake nude images of Gale Weathers leak on the internet. She later claims it was just her head, and Jennifer Aniston's body.\n\nSidney and Randy enroll and begin taking classes at Windsor College, Ohio in their freshman year. She studies Theatre and Randy studies Film.\n\nGrieving absent mother, Nancy Loomis begins using an alias, Debbie Salt, and contacts one of the 95 active serial killers in the country, Mickey Altieri. They plan their copycat killing spree now that the film based on her son's murderous rampage Stab is greenlit.\n\n1997\n\nScream 2 events\n\nThe Windsor College Murders occur, also referred as the Copycat Murders/Second Ghostface Murders.\n\nLate 1997: Events of Scream 2 (December 12, 1997, released film):\n\nCotton Weary states his exoneration to Sidney was \"over a year\" ago, in the library scene.\n\nSidney and Randy Meeks, 18, survivors in Scream, are now college freshmen at Windsor College.\n\nFollowing the first two murders, Sidney states it is opening weekend for the multiplex film, indicating it is a Friday morning after the title credits appear for Scream 2. She also states \"300 people\" watched Maureen die (likely an exaggeration).\n\nIt appears it was not the only sneak-preview screening earlier that Thursday night, as earlier attendees can be seen exiting an earlier screening of the film as Maureen goes to get popcorn, which occurs minutes into the film.\n\nSidney has a starring role as Cassandra in The Oresteia with no understudy, due to open on Sunday night. She tells Dewey, \"We open in two days\" on the Friday after the first two killings.\n\nStab (1997) starring Tori Spelling is given a wide-release in theatres on a Friday. A preview clip is viewed by Randy and Dewey in a coffee shop on Saturday, one day after Cici Cooper's Friday night murder at the co-sponsored Acid Rain mixer, observing an interview conducted by Nancy O'Dell speaking to actress Tori Spelling.\n\nMaureen Evans, a senior at Windsor College, hears someone say, \"those kids got killed in California a couple of years ago\".\n\nGale Weathers refers to Cotton and Sidney's tension with the revelation he is innocent in a time frame stating, \"given everything that's happened in the last few years\".\n\nSee More in Continuity Errors: Information about the infamous movie mistake \"April 12, 1997\" at \"09:50\" production filming date seen at the Stab midnight sneak preview opening screening, and its timeline inconsistency (also later referenced in the fifth film as an Easter egg), see the next section.\n\nMaureen Evans and Phil Stevens are 22-year-old Windsor seniors murdered 10-15 minutes after midnight on Friday during a sneak-preview screening. A new Sandra Bullock film is released concurrently with the release of Stab (1998 film).\n\nAccidentally Consistent Continuity — The Sandra Bullock movie referenced by Phil Stevens is likely to be Hope Floats, released on May 29, 1998, five months after the official release of Scream 2 (December 1997), and the only film she made that year.\n\nThis would also correspond to Sidney starring as Cassandra in The Oresteia, her first starring role in an end-of-year production.\n\n(Seen in Scream 3 (2000 film) only, first ever interquel-timeline scene, as it takes place between the beginning of Scream 2 and the beginning of Scream 3): Randy records \"Scary Movies 101\", while locking roommate Paul outside, explaining the Rules to survive the End of a Trilogy. It is indicated to be the same Friday before or after Film Class with Cici and Mickey due to him wearing the same outfit.\n\n1998—2000\n\nPost-Scream 2, pre-Scream 3 (June 1998—February 2000)\n\nApprox. mid-1998 (post-Scream 2):\n\nSidney, 19, is given an honorary diploma at Windsor College due to the murders.\n\nSidney and Cotton sit down with Diane Sawyer.\n\nCotton Weary parlays his fifteen minutes as a talk show host on his show, 100% Cotton (1998—2000). He develops a bad reputation as a conman with many enemies.\n\nGale writes College Terror / The Windsor College Murders (the latter is the name of book mentioned in Scream 3) as she waits for Dewey to recover from his near-death experience and lives in Woodsboro briefly. It is released by the end of the year.\n\nStab 2 (1999) based on the Windsor College murders is fast-track, green-lit and filmed within this timeframe. It is released sometime in 1999. (Likely encouraged by Cotton to elevate his public image).\n\nPossibly 1998: Roman Bridger is a 28-year-old music video director with a brief, failed television acting career stint as a guest star on Dawson's Creek. He portrays Cliff Elliott. (Radio Silence discussed the idea in their January 27 Q&A, though did not confirm it. They enjoyed the premise of it).\n\n1998—1999:\n\nSidney relocates to Monterey, California.\n\nSidney adopts a retriever named Cherokee.\n\nShe takes a job from home as a crisis counselor using a changed legal name, \"Laura\" to hide her identity. Her father comes to visit her at some points.\n\nFrankie is born to unnamed parents (is described as being in his mid-late 20s in the sixth film).\n\nJennifer Jolie dates Brad Pitt. It does not work out.\n\n1999:\n\nGale abandons Dewey in Woodsboro for further career opportunities in New York City and later, Los Angeles.\n\nShe is offered 60 Minutes II (1999—2005), for which she feels could have made her \"the next Diane Sawyer\". Jennifer later says she was sorry \"things didn't work out\" (either she was replaced, or the opportunity was given to someone else), leading her to then become an anchorwoman for Total Entertainment, a TMZ-like news, as well as pursue and become a celebrity motivational journalism speaker on the side, due to her fame.\n\nStab 2 (1999) based on the Windsor College murders is released over a year after Stab (1998)'s wide release.\n\nFans are upset over Randy (Christopher Speed)'s death in the Stab sequel. This is Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer's last known appearance as Sidney, not wanting to portray fictional events for the green-lit sequel.\n\nYet another sequel is green lit, but no real-life events encourage a fictional story. A lost cause, the job is given to an unknown music video director, Roman Bridger, who promises something special.\n\nApprox. June 1999: Vince Schneider is born to Leslie Macher, Stu Macher's older sister (being his nephew), and unnamed father (in fifth film, the script describes Vince as 22).\n\nContinuity Error: If Vince's birthday is in 1999, that would mean his age at death would be 23 in September 2022, not 22. In order to rectify this age discrepancy and glaring timeline conflict, it's noted that his birthday would be moved up a year so as to best correspond and fix said error, to June 2000 instead.\n\n2000s\n\nFebruary 2000\n\nThe events of Scream 3. Known as the Hollywood Murders, it's the Third Ghostface Murders and the first to not be a copycat killing spree, as well as the first one to take place in a real-world location, as well as the same state of the first murders, in Hollywood, California, paradoxical, which occurred during production of Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro. Sidney is now 21 turning 22.\n\nRoman Bridger is defeated by Sidney and finished by Dewey at Milton's mansion on his 30th birthday, February 4.\n\nMartha Meeks is 17.\n\nIt has been approximately four years since Roman tracked Maureen down in late 1995.\n\nGale and Dewey get engaged. Mark and Sidney watch a movie together with the engaged couple, an implied double-date.\n\nPost-Scream 3, pre-Scream 4\n\nApprox. 2000s decade [undetermined timeframe events]:\n\nSidney and Mark date then separate.\n\nCherokee presumably dies.\n\nSheriff Burke retires and/or passes away.\n\nJudy Hicks joins the Woodsboro police department.\n\nSidney begins martial arts classes.\n\n2000: An engaged Gale writes Hollywood Horror, her fourth Sidney/Maureen Prescott-related Ghostface book (following Wrongly Accused (1996), The Woodsboro Murders (1997) and College Terror (1998). It is based on the cancelled Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro murders at Sunrise Studios committed by Roman Bridger.\n\nApprox. 2000—2011: Dewey undergoes intense physical therapy.\n\n2001: Gale and Dewey get married after one year of engagement. Scream (2022 film) confirms the fourth film is set in 2011, when Gale says they have been married ten years. The Riley's live in Woodsboro together for at least a decade.\n\n2002—2005: Development for Stab 3: Hollywood Horror occurs after Gale has written the real-life book on it.\n\nApprox. 2000—2001: Gale writes her fourth Maureen Prescott-related Ghostface book, based on the murders at Sunrise Studios.\n\nMay 2002: Samantha Carpenter turns five. Her mother is pregnant with her second child during this period.\n\nDecember 14, 2002 (timeline conflict, but canonical): Tara Carpenter is born. She is Christina Carpenter's second child and Mr. Carpenter's first.\n\nTara was supposed to be born on December 14, 2003.\n\napprox. 2002-2003: Greg Bruckner is born to unknown affluent parents in Atlanta (in the sixth film).\n\napprox. August 2003: Jason Carvey is born to unknown parents in Atlanta, Georgia (in the sixth film).\n\napprox. November-December 2003: Quinn Bailey is born to Wayne Bailey and unnamed mother, second child, younger sister of Richie (in sixth film).\n\nSeptember 2003—August 2004 (timeline conflict, see next section): The teenagers featured in the fifth Scream (2022 film) are born. They would correspondingly be Woodsboro High School Class of 2022 (confirmed by reporter's dialogue; due to the sixth film's retcon, would be the Woodsboro High Class of 2023 instead, which would include September 2004-August 2005, noted).\n\napprox. September 30, 2003:\n\nMindy Meeks-Martin and Chad Meeks-Martin are born in Woodsboro, Martha Meeks's twin children. (Martha is 21 after giving birth).\n\nExplanation : Due to the Continuity Error of events of Scream (2022) taking place in September of 2022, on the 26th anniversary of the original Woodsboro Murders (1996), not the 25th like reported within dialogue (which would be September 2021), this places the ages of the Meeks-Martin twins to be 18, going on 19 instead of 17, going on 18 in 2022.\n\nSeeing as they'd have to have been born in 2004 for their age of 17 to be canonical, unless retconned, which brings a discrepancy in age (as they'd be 16 in 2021, despite being born in in 2003). Also, both their birthdays can only be the last day of September, as they'd have turned older before then and ages wouldn't align with their character wikis.\n\napprox. October 2003:\n\nLiv McKenzie is born to unnamed parents in Woodsboro (is perhaps the youngest child of the McKenzie family).\n\nContinuity Error: If Liv's birthday is in 2003, that would mean her age at death would be 18 in September 2022, not 17. In order to rectify this age discrepancy and glaring timeline conflict, it's noted that her birthday would be moved up a year so as to best correspond and fix said error, to October 2004 instead.\n\napprox. November 2003: Guy Throwing Cup is born to his unknown parents.\n\napprox. December 2003:\n\nAmber Freeman is born to her unnamed parents (unknown if she is the only child or has older/younger siblings and/or cousins).\n\nContinuity Error/Explanation: Due to the Continuity Error of events in Scream (2022) taking place in September 2022 on 26th anniversary of the Woodsboro Murders (1996), not the 25th anniversary as said & reported within in-dialogues (which would be September 2021), this is at timeline conflict and major age discrepancy for Amber.\n\nSeeing how if kept with her original birthday, would mean she'd have been and died at 18 when she had committed the Third Woodsboro Murders (2022), with her older fan boyfriend, Richie, that would mean she was the age of majority and not \"groomed\" by him by the time the 2022 murders took place. To rectify this, her birthday being moved a year forward would correspond and correlate to age of death of 17 as stated in her character wiki, to December 2004, instead.\n\napprox. August 2004:\n\nWes Hicks (17 in the fifth film) is born, Judy Hicks' first and only child. (Hicks was approx. 25 when she had her only child).\n\nContinuity Error: Due to the Third Woodsboro Murders occurring in September 2022 on the 26th anniversary of the original murders, instead of in September 2021, thus not on the 25th anniversary, that means if Wes kept with his original birthday, it would mean his age of death in 2022 would be 18, not 17, in September 2022. In order to rectify this age and timeline error, it's noted that his birthday be moved up a year, to best fix the discrepancy to align with his age at death, to August 2005 instead.\n\nAnika Kayoko is born in New York City to unknown parents (in the sixth film).\n\napprox. August 2004: Frances is born to her unknown parents.\n\nThe older seniors were somehow born on September 1, 2003, and the younger seniors were somehow born on early mid-August 31, 2004 (See Continuity Errors).\n\napprox. November-December 2004: Ethan Landry is born to Wayne Bailey and unknown mother, third/youngest child, younger brother to both older sister Quinn and brother Richie (in sixth film).\n\nApprox. 2006: Filmed in 2005, Stab 3: Hollywood Horror is eventually remade loosely re-telling a story of true events. It completes the Stab trilogy based on true events. It is possible Tori Spelling returned one final time.\n\nIn Stab 3, Dewey and Gale's characters are married for 10 years, just like they are in Scream 4 (set in 2011, married in 2001). Given Stab (1998 film-within-a-film) is set in 1996 and released in 1998, it is likely it was released in 2006, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the Woodsboro Murders (the earliest possible timeframe for Dewey and Gale to be a married couple, without a futuristic time jump, which Jenny notes does not occur until Stab 5).\n\nGiven Gale likely wrote about her romantic relationship with Dewey in The Windsor College Murders book, which included his near-death experience (published late-1998 or early-1999) and Stab 2 was released in 1999, it is possible Stab 2 streamlined their romantic story, and decided they got married right after the events of Stab in 1996. This would make sense, and Stab 3's delayed release would also be affected by the previous production murders six years prior.\n\nGiven Scream 4's mockery of Stab's 'endless sequels' is a reference to the Saw franchise's consecutively released sequels during this timeframe, it is likely this detail was intentional, as Saw 3 was also released in 2006.\n\nApprox. 2006—2007:\n\nSunrise Studios attempts and fails to license a real-life inspired Stab film (either a prequel on Maureen or a Stab remake) approaching the tenth anniversary of the original Stab, which would have fit the style of 2000s Hollywood horror remake trends.\n\nSidney blocks this and threatens to sue the studios if they attempt to use real-life events. She appears to have the publishing rights for the original events in media form. (The reason for her desire/threat to sue is implicated differently in the fourth and fifth films).\n\nApprox. 2007: Stab 4 is the first officially released fictional Stab sequel. It is a fresh story.\n\nAccording to Jenny Randall in Scream 4, it is not based on her true story anymore and is a purely fictional franchise onwards.\n\nIt appears likely her role shifted from true events-based protagonist to a secondary character in these fictional storylines.\n\nSidney's character continues to appear in this film and its three sequels (Scream 5), according to Richie Kirsch.\n\nNote: This differentiates from a deleted fountain scene at Woodsboro High in Scream 4; Kirby states Sidney's character has been gone since Stab 3. (Non-canon). (For more information, see: Next section).\n\nPotential new distributor, following Sidney's dispute with Sunrise Studios, unable to create their remake.\n\nThe role reprisal of Tori Spelling or a recast is unknown.\n\nJudy Hicks is a potential character in the film, according to Wes Hicks. (In the original script for Scream 5 dubbed Scream Forever).\n\nDespite it being a stretch, it is highly unlikely she was in the most recent two Stab films (7 or 8).\n\nIt is possible her character as a Woodsboro police officer was used as a general reference to create \"realism\", now with the franchise becoming fictional.\n\nCoincides with the release of Saw IV.\n\n2008: Stab 5 (filmed 2007) is the infamous time travel Stab film is released. Time travel's importance would be elevated by the fact that it is released on the decade anniversary of the original Stab. Coincides with the release of Saw V.\n\n2009: Stab 6 (filmed and takes place in 2008) is released.\n\nCoincides with the release of Saw VI (2008).\n\nThe character Trudie has a Sidekick 2 (model released in 2005) and saw, Saw IV, a Halloween 2007 release, in theatres. The pair deal with a \"Facebook serial killer\", confirming its pre-2009 timeframe (filmed in 2008).\n\nBy the time of its 2009 release, Twitter had become a more relevant platform to include a cyber stalker plot element, likely a plot point criticized by moviegoers after Stab received backlash. Rachel, from the opening of Stab 7 makes note of this.\n\nThe final Stab film to have a storyline in continuity with the previous 5 films, similar to the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.\n\nFirst annual Stab-a-thon occurred.\n\n2010s\n\n2010: Stab 7 (filmed 2009) is released. The final numbered Stab film, a popular DVD in 2011. In the seventh film, they respond to backlash from the release of Stab 6's dated \"Facebook killer\" story.\n\nStab 7 appears to be a reference to the seventh A Nightmare on Elm Street, a meta film named Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) that influenced the original Scream (1996). The seventh Nightmare film acknowledged the events of the previous six Nightmares as Hollywood films, and real-life Heather Langenkamp appears again, playing herself.\n\nIt is possible Tori Spelling appeared as herself here, which would count as \"Sidney\" appearing.\n\nMarnie Cooper (later in October 2011) mistakenly believed that the beginning of Stab 7 being Stab 6 meant the same for Stab 6 with Stab 5. Jenny corrects her, telling her that she is simply overthinking it.\n\nSecond annual Stab-a-thon occurred.\n\nFollowing this, the franchise was at a standstill, especially after Sidney released a more accurate account of her life with the self-help book, Out of Darkness. It is the final appearance in the franchise, though it was likely the actress who portrayed her playing Sidney in a movie-within-a-movie role (Spelling if she returned).\n\nBetween 15—24 December 2010: 13-year-old Sam Carpenter searches for Christmas presents and discovers her family origins and confronts her mother. Her legal father overhears this and abandons his family that night. Tara turned eight on December 14, and Samantha turned 13 in May 19th, 2010\n\n15—24 December 2010: Mr. Carpenter abandons his family.\n\napprox. 2010—2011 (off-screen):\n\nTrevor cheats on Jill with someone, possibly Jenny Randall (deleted scenes confirm this idea, though if canon, Jill would be more of an obvious suspect).\n\nJill then begins a secret relationship with Charlie Walker. When they learn, Sidney is returning to Woodsboro as a last stop for her upcoming book tour, they conspire for a 15th anniversary remake killing spree.\n\nOctober 2011\n\nOctober 2011 (on-screen):\n\nEvents of Scream 4, the Second Woodsboro Murders, also known as the Woodsboro Massacre remake.\n\nThird annual Stab-A-Thon. Olivia Morris indicates she is an attendee of a previous Stab-A-Thon.\n\nSidney releases Out of Darkness, a self-help novel about her life. Her publicist Rebecca Walters has not read her book, instead waiting for the movie.\n\nGale and Dewey have been married for 10 years, just like their characters in Stab 3. (According to Rebecca). Proposed in 2000, married in 2001.\n\nPost-Scream 4, pre-Scream 5\n\n2011 (off-screen):\n\nShortly after Christmas 2010, Mr. Carpenter leaves the family, including his approx. 8-year-old-that-year daughter, Tara. (Turned 9 in December 2011, almost 2-3 months after Second Woodsboro Murders occurred).\n\nMartha Meeks lives outside of Woodsboro, California with her twin children. (She returns later, however).\n\nPossible: Sam Carpenter, age 14, is babysitting Wes Hicks, age approx. 7/8, while Judy Hicks is on sheriff's deputy duty. If not, Wes is staying at his father's house.\n\nBetween October-2011—October 2021:\n\nKirby Reed, sole teen survivor, relocates from Woodsboro to Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nApprox. 2012—2015:\n\nSidney reconciles with and marries Mark Kincaid.\n\nSidney gives birth to 2 daughters (of her known 3 children in Scream 5) between 2013 and 2015. (Grade-school level schoolgirls, required age being 6, mentioned in the fifth film, set in late-2021).\n\nGiven the timeframe to recover from ICU complications and near-death, and her reconciliation with Mark, it is most likely her elder daughter, if not a twin or adopted, is born in 2013—2015.\n\nHer second-born daughter (if not a twin and adopted) is born no later than 2015.\n\nAn early script for the fifth film indicates the Kincaid daughters' ages as 6 and 8 (thus born 2013 and 2015).\n\nGale relocates back to New York. (It is implied Gale is from New York, she briefly mentions she should be covering the Sharon Stone stalker story there).\n\nDewey splits up from Gale after two months in New York City.\n\n2016 (Scream VI retcon makes this 2017): 18 (19)-year-old Sam Carpenter (turning 20) abandons Woodsboro and her 13-year-old sister. She will not return for another 5 years.\n\nError: Amber Freeman claims Sam left on her exact 18th birthday. (Possible exaggeration for others to generate suspicion against Sam).\n\nThough this would be inconsistent with the reference to the reporter and its near-25th anniversary 'to the day'. It is possible Tara refers to the events of her father's abandonment rounded to the year of her eighth birthday in 2011 (with the reference to Christmas gifts being leftover gifts in January), so she was actually much closer to age 7 than age 8.)\n\nApprox. 2016—2019: Judy Hicks is promoted and becomes Sheriff of Woodsboro. She is preceded by Dewey Riley (approx. 2000s—2016) and Sheriff Burke (until at least 2000). This follows Sam's departure (who knew her as Deputy).\n\n2018: Kirby Reed gives a public interview about her survival in her mid-20s.\n\n2019: Tara, Chad, Mindy, Frances, Liv and Wes start their freshman year of high school. If taking Tara's age in consideration, she'd be a grade above the twins, Wes and Liv as a sophomore instead.\n\n2019: Gale and Dewey stop speaking. However, it's revealed in the 5th movie that he still watches her Tv show from his couch in his trailer.\n\n2019—2021: Sidney Prescott-Kincaid welcomes an additional child, her most recent (likely her third). (Physically unseen, but her young child is inside a pram in 2021).\n\n2020s\n\n2021: Stab (2021) is released. Directed by \"Knives Out guy\", Rian Johnson.\n\nSummer 2021: Liv McKenzie works with Tara Carpenter while dating Vince Schneider the summer before senior year (retcon from sixth film makes this the summer before Liv's junior year, although it correctly applies to Tara heading to her senior year, only to repeat and graduate in 2023 instead).\n\nFall 2021: Liv breaks up with Vince Schneider.\n\nA video titled \"Every Stab (2021) Kill Ranked from Worst to Worst\" is shown as being released 10 months ago to 82,000 views.\n\n25th Anniversary Date Error: It is mentioned to have come out \"last year\" twice, by both Samantha and Mindy, despite being shown as a 2021 release date. This makes the film set in 2022, further backed up by the date of the murders being stated as 2022 in Scream VI. (See Continuity Error).\n\nIt is the simple, number-dropped title for Stab 8, a reboot to the franchise in developmental hell.\n\nGag/nod to the 2017 fandom backlash of his role as the eighth Star Wars film director and writer.\n\nIt is clear that post-production aesthetic goofs for the Easter eggs in the fifth film intended to update the film's year close to the release date, which disregards all previous age and time-related continuity established in the scenes shot in 2020, such as Sam/Tara's ages, Sam's age in relation to being Billy's daughter, and the referenced 25th anniversary, causing many timeline issues.\n\n2021: Liv begins dating Chad Meeks-Martin in their junior year of high school.\n\nMay 7, 2021: Dead Meat duo (James A. Janisse and his wife Chelsea) post a critical review of Stab 8 on FILM FAILS. It had 122,096 views (12/20/96 is the release date of the original Scream film). FILM FAILS has 821,939, which is Wes Craven's birthday, August (8), 2, 1939.\n\nMarch 2021 (sixth film retcon makes this March 2022 instead): Just six months before the events of the fifth film, Sam Carpenter meets Richie Kirsch.\n\nMay 2021: StabHead uploads \"Not My Stab! Join the StabHead Army and #RedoStab2021!!!\" to 12,000 views (Released 4 months ago; sixth film retcon would make this upload take place a year before, since Third Woodsboro Murders occur in September 2022)\n\n2022 Legacy Killings\n\n3 days in late-September: Events of the fifth film, simply titled Scream (2022):\n\nTara's landline reveals the date to be 09/23 at 9.27pm. As we know the film occurs 25 years after the original, this would make it a Thursday night, on September 23, 2021. However, the sixth film states it is 2022 (and contradicts its anniversary date).\n\nA reporter can be heard in Dewey's trailer stating the murder from the previous night (Vince) occurred one day before \"an unidentified woman\" was attacked (Sam). Sam herself also gives the same timeline when speaking to Dewey, and states her sister was stabbed seven times the night before that.\n\nSam Carpenter is 25 (In-universe dialogue implicates she is 23 turning 24).\n\nTara Carpenter's hospital wristband reveals she is 18 turning 19 in December 14, 2021, hence why she was a legal adult being left alone during Christina's international business trip. She is 5 years younger than Sam. Due to film and Legacy Murders being in 2022 now, she would be 19 turning 20 instead.\n\nFurther dialogue in the opening scene indicates Christina has been absent frequently. \"Charlie\" states an anecdote from \"the other day\", also inferring her business venture in Europe is extensive. This would also confirm her absence occurs over a two-week calendar period.\n\nSee more: Continuity Errors.\n\nPost-Scream (2022), Pre-Scream VI\n\nOctober 2022: The Bailey family catches wind of Richie's death and start planning a revenge plan to kill Sam and Tara, as well as any other survivors. Mrs. Bailey refuses and is killed off-screen, supposedly by her husband and youngest and last son (since most deleted scenes, like this one from Scream VI, which didn't show murder but rather Wayne in the reveal/Act 3 tells Sam and Tara, are considered non-canon in the franchise, it's unknown if this took place, although likely, if retconned)\n\nPossible: Unless stated, possible that then 19 year old Jason Carvey and his friend, Greg, also catch news of Richie's death due to being Redditors, and fans of his idea to reinvigorate the Stab franchise (following backlash from fans about Stab 8/reboot) by committing but failing to execute the Carpenter sisters, as well as legacy heroine Sidney Prescott, and now deuteragonist, Gale Weathers, in the Third Woodsboro Murders, who after, both most likely decide, whether they're in college or not, to move from where they're from in Atlanta, Georgia, and transfer (either sophomores/juniors) or enroll at Blackmore University after hearing of the Carpenters relocation to New York and Tara attending alongside Chad and Mindy, who also survived the 2022 murders.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Kirby Reed, now an FBI agent, and sole survivor of the Second Woodsboro Murders (2011), monitors their online activity due to their obsession with Ghostface, even after they move to New York City, albeit she states to Wayne she's been doing so \"for the last few months\".\n\nWhether on Reddit was where Richie set out the plans for his \"film\" (in 5th film, tells Sam it's to give Hollywood ideas when laying out his plans/motives), both Jason and Greg are committed to this plan for an uncomplete film to be finished by killing both Tara and Sam. Whether they posted their plans to finish this film of Richie online remains to be seen, although it remains highly likely they didn't, as Kirby was monitoring their online activity even from afar, seeing as she is an FBI agent from their city and any post with conspiracy to commit murder in-vein after the 2022 murders, almost immediately would've alerted Kirby and the agency beforehand.\n\nHowever, in the beginning of Scream VI, after Jason as Ghostface had killed their film professor Laura Crane, and who tells who he thinks Greg (actually Wayne as Ghostface) to not speak of their plans or Laura's death on the phone, before doing so anyway himself and how they're finishing Richie's film, in his words, but to which he deflects by asking him how he knows when Wayne tells him he's right in finishing Richie's film by killing the sisters begore he's then killed in a ploy as its revealed they're copycats to the actual killers, being Richie's family.\n\nApril 2023: Six months prior, Sam, Tara, Chad and Mindy move to New York City for the semester at Blackmore University. Tara, Chad, and Mindy presumably graduated early with honorary diplomas from Woodsboro High School, and assumingly didn't walk with their graduating class of 2023 who would graduate like most American high schools, a month or two later, in May-June.\n\nAround this time, Quinn Bailey, a college sophomore/junior, answers Sam and Tara's anonymous roommate and Ethan Landry, a college freshman (or if he graduated early in 2022, a sophomore) gets Chad as a roommate by tampering with the roommate lottery.\n\nAround this time, Wayne Bailey takes a job as a detective on the NYPD.\n\nSamantha would begin to attend therapy with Dr. Christopher Stone, which she refers to as the counselor insisting her sister attend as well.\n\napprox. late 2022-early 2023: Quinn Bailey begins to spread the rumor of Samantha being the actual mastermind in the Third Woodsboro Murders instead of Richie and Amber, which unless stated, started the sub-Reddit, \"The Woodsboro Truther\", turning Sam from the hero of Woodsboro to the villain, and to convince the worst in her rather than the best for people.\n\nAlso, Sam's bloodline to Billy Loomis is probably most likely also incidentally revealed as public knowledge after the murders and the reason for Sam's scrutiny in the aftermath of the 2022 murders and leading up to the 2023 murders.\n\nMay 19: Sam turns 26 years old. She takes two unknown \"shit\" jobs to cover for the rent of their apartment, according to Tara.\n\nJune-September 2023: Sometime before Halloween 2023, Sam would go and have a secret fling/love interest in Danny Brackett, a resident in her apartment.\n\nSeptember 30, 2022-2023: Chad and Mindy turn 19 in 2022, following surviving the 2022 murders and turn 20 before surviving the New York Murders.\n\nDecember 14, 2022-2023: Tara turns 20 in 2022 following, and then 21 years old, following surviving both the Legacy Murders and New York Murders.\n\n2023 New York Murders\n\nThe New York Murders occur, (Sixth Ghostface Murders), and the second to take place at a college, 25-26 years since the Windsor College Murders in Scream 2, it's the second Ghostface spree to be a \"copycat\", and following just a year after the Legacy Murders, in the Requel trend, of which are based on the Woodsboro Murders (1996), which were followed by Windsor, the second Ghostface spree to be set in another state and the first to be on Halloween.\n\n3 days during Halloween week, 2023: Events of the sixth film, October 29-October 31, simply titled Scream VI.\n\nSaturday, October 29\n\nNote: Despite starting date shown, that date actually takes place in October 2022; seeing as in 2023, October 29th falls on a Sunday instead, which would be the correct date (See Continuity Errors for more)\n\nSometime in the night, Greg Bruckner is murdered by Wayne Bailey as Ghostface in his and his roommate's apartment off-screen and dismembered, with his head and body being hidden in the apartment refrigerator.\n\nFilm studies teacher Laura Crane is at a restaurant bar called Hasta La Fuego, texting and talking to her date on Flirtr (parody app of Tinder; similar to Chipster being a parody of Twitter from the TV series). She exits the bar to help him find her, who's lured and tricked, much to her anger and fear, but is ambushed and murdered in an alley by her student Jason Carvey, donning the Ghostface costume and mask.\n\nDue to it being Halloween week and at night, inside the alleyway of Hudson, a busy street in Manhattan within New York City, Jason discards his robe and mask into his backpack, and walks away from the alleyway and to the crowd, of which he blends into. Before arriving home, Jason passes by the Blackmore University campus and talks to Tara, in her pirate costume, who's heading to a party along others, who's a classmate (and who Jason intended to make a victim) as Jason tells her if she's going to the frat party with Sam, to which Tara laughs and retorts she won't as a smiling Jason tries to convince her, which she denies as they depart.\n\nWhen Jason arrives home, he places his bloody Ghostface mask in a closet, which contains a mini shrine to the Stab franchise, and looks for Greg and Wayne calls him, using the Ghostface voice while pretending to be Greg, as they talk about finishing Richie's film, by killing the Carpenter sisters, much to Jason's growing suspicion on why Greg isn't home and not answering him, seeing as they're supposed to be talking subtly of their plans, despite Jason disregarding his own advice he gives to Greg and tells him about killing Laura, due to her giving him a failing grade. After a game of Hot and Cold, Wayne as Ghostface and the actual killers, not copycats, murdered Jason in front of his refrigerator.\n\nAcross the street, Sam is at her therapist Christopher Stone's house (of whom she's been visiting for the last 6 months). She opens up to him about the rumors online of her being the mastermind of the 2022 murders and admits to her father being Billy Loomis and how killing her ex, Richie Kirsch; explaining it in detail and how it felt good, to which he throws her out. She goes home and finds Tara to be at a frat party Sam had told her not to go to, from her and Tara's roommate, Quinn.\n\nAt said frat party, Frankie, a drunk frat, tries taking Tara up to his room, to which Mindy's girlfriend Anika Kayoko goes to notify Chad, who's partying with his roommate, Ethan, who attacks Frankie after getting rough with Tara. Sam appears and then tazes Frankie in the groin/penis, making Tara upset, as Halloween partygoers/students record the altercation on their phones, as well as somebody recognizing Sam as she's recorded as she makes her way out, with everybody recording Frankie on the floor (who also, before trying to take on Tara, knew her as the girl from California involved in Stab).\n\nSam follows after her sister outside walking across the campus, with Chad, Mindy, Ethan, and Anika behind in tow, as Tara asks why Sam can't let her live her life, as Sam retorts on her bad decision and how she knew he was bad, as Tara exclaims how it's her decision and her life, as the sisters argue, with Tara asking Sam why she's in New York, calling out her working 2 shit jobs to help with rent, while her and the twins attend university, and asks Sam what she's going to do with her life, as Tara plans to study and graduate and live her life, and suggests Sam let her go, following Sam's overprotectiveness of her since the 2022 murders.\n\nA redhead partygoer girl with her friends then arrives as she then proceeds to dump her soda (Cherry Coke, according to Sam and Danny) on Sam, and call her out loud \"Murderer!\", much to Sam's anger, as she proceeds to shove the girl, and ask her what her problem is, as Chad and Tara hold her back, with Mindy, Anika, and Ethan facing the partygoer's crowd as she states to ask Sam and how she knows what she did, who's referring to the rumors she mentioned to Stone of her being the killer of Richie and Amber in Woodsboro, as Sam loudly defends herself that she didn't do anything. Following the altercation dispersing, Ethan stays behind as the group begins to walk home and offers Sam his tissues.\n\nAfter arguing for a while and cooling down, Tara and her friends go upstairs to her and Sam's apartment. Tara heads into her bedroom and lays on her bed, as Quinn checks up on her and relates to Tara about overprotective family members, referring to her dad and after her brother's death in a car crash, as Chad enters and Quinn leaves, to check in on her before he leaves, as the two share a moment, with romance sparking between them, before they are interrupted from kissing by Quinn leaving her phone in her room on \"accident\".\n\nMeanwhile, Sam sits in the foyer of the apartment building. Danny appears and reveals his and Sam's secret relationship. After a while, Chad calls Sam upstairs and Danny follows.\n\nUpon arriving through the door, a news broadcast reveals that Jason and Greg were murdered and there was a shrine to Ghostface in the apartment. Sam, rationally, freaks out and tells her sister, Tara, to pack a bag and announces they're leaving the state, and Chad kicks Danny out, confused at Sam's statement. Sam asks the twins to back her up, as Tara argues she's being irrational on her former classmate's deaths, due to Jason being in their Film class, as Sam claims it can't be a coincidence, and to Tara's dismay, as the twins agree, with Mindy being it is close to home.\n\nTara makes Quinn call her dad, Wayne, who is a NYPD detective, before Sam makes an irrational decision and ruins her college education. Right as Quinn makes the call, Sam's phone rings at the kitchen table, due to everyone being in the living room. The whole room goes quiet as Sam goes to see who's calling, only to see it's Gale, who calls Sam's mobile phone, and it reveals the date to be Saturday, October 29th at 9:57pm. Ethan asks why everyone went quiet when her phone rang, as Anika tells Ethan how he's got to keep up (a meta reference and an homage to the Scream franchise, and the beginning of the films always having a phone call by Ghostface to survivors and/or soon-to-be victims). Wayne tells Sam that she needs to come to the station.\n\nReminder: As stated, the sixth film's events occur 1 year after the fifth's, this would make it a Sunday night, on October 29, 2023. However, the sixth film's October 2023 calendar lists it as a Saturday, corresponding to the October 2022 date in that year's calendar, which contradicts its date in the film as opposed to real-world dates in reality.\n\nSam and Tara leave the apartment, despite Sam's hesitance of bringing Tara, and Sam then gets a call from Richie's phone number. Tara tells Sam not to answer but she does. Ghostface taunts Sam on being the one to kill copycats Jason and Greg and threatening to come after her for her and her loved ones, due to her role as the murderer, with Sam telling the killer back to watch their back after Ghostface tells Sam this, and who then appears behind and almost gets Tara attacked by Ghostface. Tara fights back as Sam helps, pushing the killer to the ground, onto a bike rack before they run as Ghostface gives chase, which ensues through the neighborhood streets of New York, and into the city's nearby busy street.\n\nSam guides Tara into Abe's Snake, a bodega, around the corner. Tara and Sam enter, cutting in line, and pleading for the Bodega Clerk fearfully for help and to call the police, trying to warn him about the imminent danger, much to the dismay of a Burly Guy of them cutting in line. Just then, Ghostface enters, as Sam and Tara go back, as the man then faces Ghostface and asks if there's a problem, unafraid, where Ghostface then kills him by stabbing him a lot in the gut, as well as another guy by a throat stab. Many civilians in line and at the bodega begin to leave and run away in terror, as Ghostface turns his back on them exiting the front door to face the sisters.\n\nThe clerk then calls for Ghostface, as he now is armed with his shotgun, who turns around and narrowly misses the Clerk's shot, which takes Sam and Tara aback, due to the loud reverberation of the shot, which shoots a rack of products and leaves debris in its wake. The clerk reloads and gets out from behind the counter to find Ghostface has disappeared, and who looks up and tells the sisters to leave out the back and to hurry, to which Sam and Tara comply and thank, only to find the door locked, as the Clerk tries to be on lookout for the Ghostface, as a frantic Tara desperately cries pleading to him that they need his keys.\n\nDistracted, the Clerk heaves trying to get his keys attached on his belts to give the Carpenter sisters, who then try to warn him to look out, as he looks up to see in a round mirror Ghostface approach from behind him. Before the Clerk can react as he turns around, Ghostface stabs him on his chest and hits him with the knife and disarms him as the injured Clerk falls back down onto the beer refrigerators, as Sam and Tara then hide in an aisle and duck down to the ground, and witness as Ghostface grabs the Clerk's shotgun singlehandedly, with the Clerk pleading \"No!\" before Ghostface brutally shoots the Clerk dead in his face with a shot, killing him instantly, leaving now 3 victims. The sisters, horrified at what they've witnessed, crawl on the floor on their knees, as the store goes quiet, and try to hide an aisle as Ghostface reloads the shotgun, cocks it and turns around to find the sisters as he faces the aisles, not seeing them, as he holds the shotgun with both hands, and whose walk towards the aisle, with the debris of the destroyed products crunching under their boots.\n\nSilently, Sam motions for Tara to crawl towards the exit, both on their knees and hands, and just before they begin, Ghostface begins to shoot into the aisles, destroying products on the racks, causing for the sisters to cover their heads and look down on their knees, as debris flies on to the aisles, cluttering it. Trying again to attempt to move, Ghostface shoots in anticipation and breaks the refrigerators, where he had shot, and the sisters duck their heads down again. After the shot, Ghostface reloads and cocks the gun and tries to anticipate the sisters, as he heads into the start of the aisle to see nothing, but suspects they're hiding in the back, to which Sam and Tara sit silently behind a rack at the end of it, just out of the killer's eyesight, due to the mask.\n\nTensely, Ghostface begins to approach and walk down the aisle, shotgun in hand, much to a silently crying Tara's fear and quiet whimpers. As Sam sees this, she acts quickly, while the bodega music plays menacingly in the background, she quietly as possible grabs a Coors Beer can of which was destroyed when the fridges were shot, as Tara watches in fear, and as Ghostface nears toward, which drips quietly, despite it being empty, and who then swiftly throws it to the other side of the bodega, distracting Ghostface and throwing him off their path as Ghostface goes to the other side of the bodega to investigate. The sisters take this as their cue, who silently roll and still on their knees, to the adjacent aisle of which is nearer to the exit than the one they were in at the back and who start to crawl, as Ghostface suspects them to be near the aisle by the emergency exit where they attempted to escape prior. They crawl as Ghostface walks, only for the debris and broken glass to make a noise, to which Sam fearfully holds a finger to her mouth as Ghostface then stops before heading over to the exit and cocks his head sideways, as an almost shocked Sam looks through a peek in the rack of the aisle, where a hanging scale is near the killer, who suddenly looks to the side and would try to swing his shotgun to look at them, Anticipating this, the Carpenter sisters both push the entire aisle rack down, with its products, to disable Ghostface, who is held down by the shelf as he shoots the shotgun up to the ceiling, missing his shot. Scrambling and standing up, Samantha and Tara run and proceed to head outside as they exit through the front door, who they push and left open, just as the NYPD close in and arrive to surround the store, as a sweating Sam and Tara turn around, only to their terror, and suspense, find that Ghostface had got out and left through the backdoor, dropping the withered mask he'd been wearing, as both the sisters look at each other in shock and disbelief, having narrowly survived the attacks.\n\nAt the station, following the Bodega murders, Detective Bailey informs Sam and Tara that Richie's mask from the 2022 killings was left at Jason's apartment. He then asks them where they were and if they had any enemies alive. They tell him nobody that's still alive and then he's interrupted.\n\nSunday, October 30\n\nKirby introduces herself to Detective Bailey and then reunites with Sam. Just then, someone gives Bailey a mask, from the bodega which has Charlie Walker and Jill Roberts' DNA on it.\n\nOutside, now the morning or early mid-afternoon, Sam and Tara get interrogated by the press and then reunite with Gale, who's among the press, trying to interview them. The sisters are mad at her with Sam turns and tries to punch her, but she moves. She says she's done this dance before, but gets punched by Tara, who tells her to stay away from them because of the book she wrote after promising not to write it (a nod to Sid hitting Gale in the first two Scream films),with Gale reverting back to her old ways and writing Requel: Terror Returns to Woodsboro, and writing that Sam was \"born killer\" in a quote, which Gale tries to claim was taken out of context. Sam asks Gale what Dewey would have thought of this, referring to her promise to write a book about him. Tara insults as she tells Gale she heard how she couldn't sell the film rights, as Gale states how now it's about limited series. As the press is pushed back and the sisters are heading into a taxi to leave and head back to their apartment, Gale informs them that Sidney called, and that she, Mark, and her kids are going into hiding, but that she sends her love as they all agree Sidney deserves her happy ending. Tara states how maybe without Ghostface in her life, Gale would fade away into irrelevancy as the Carpenter sisters leave in the taxi as Gale watches on.\n\nThat day before night, Ghostface appears at Dr. Stone's house and murders him, appearing at the front door, breaking it and grabbing Stone and pushing his head repeatedly against the metal bars at his door, incapacitating him before delivering the fatal blow by stabbing him through his face and nose. Ghostface then breaks and enters, stealing Sam's files in the process.\n\nNow the next day, on Sunday, October 30 outside the campus at Blackmore University, the \"gang\": Quinn, Anika, Sam, Chad, Tara and Ethan listen to Mindy explain what \"movie\" they're in at the moment and to get the rules. She states how Ethan and Quinn are suspects due to them rooming with survivors and Anika is one just because she's a love interest (a callback to Dewey's statement in the fifth film). She also states how similar the predicaments they're in, with Sam stating how in the pattern of Stab following their events, the first one had taken place in Woodsboro, and how the sequel was in college, referring to the Windsor College Murders, although Mindy doesn't rule it out as a possibility of the killers following the pattern, claims it's not the case as they're not in a \"Stab\" movie or sequel, but rather in a franchise, as she explains to them how the Legacy characters are expendable, as well as new survivors, naming pop culture examples from Star Wars to Halloween as examples in the modern-current Requel trend; as well as how everything is bigger now, from shootouts to beheadings, as well as the kill count.\n\nAt the police station, Bailey tells Kirby about Stone's death, while showcasing Roman Bridger's mask, which was left at Stone's house. Kirby and Wayne talk over a board of all previous 9 Ghostface killers and their connections with the masks being left at murder scenes, as Kirby assures Wayne to not worry about the Stab movies being connected to this, a meta reference to the canon/in-universe lore. Kirby states how whoever the new Ghostface(s) are, they're counting down to the masks of Billy and Stu, as Mickey and Nancy's masks would be next to be used at the next attacks/murder scene. Bailey grows suspicions of Kirby's knowledge of Ghostface, so he asks someone to look into her background and reasonings of being there (did this to cover himself).\n\nAt Sam, Tara and Quinn's apartment, Tara tells Chad to leave town and he tells her that he's not going anywhere. Chad gives the four of them a nickname, and Anika turns the news up and they get informed that Sam is the man suspect of the recent killings. A recorded video from the soda incident the night prior is shown, from the partygoer's friend group, of Sam being hostile, although missing the context, due to them being the instigators and the redhead having thrown the soda at Sam just before the start of the video.\n\nSam sits down at the table and gets emotional saying everyone hates her. Her friends reassure her before they begin eating and conversing.\n\nAcross the alley, Danny sees Ghostface in Quinn's room, while her newest gentleman caller showers. He tries to call Sam at 7:21 pm. After she ignores the call, he shares an image of Quinn being murdered to the Core Four's phones, causing them to get up and stand in the living room.\n\nGhostface throws Quinn's body, which lands on Anika. Chad and Tara rush out the door, exiting the apartment as Ghostface attacks, slashing Mindy's arm, who're unaware of the killer holding Sam, Mindy, and Anika at bay. Anika tries to fight him off, but gets choked and thrown against the fireplace, being stabbed in the stomach. Ghostface twists the knife and raises it before Sam grabs the empty knife holder from the kitchen, after heading in to arm herself, only to find nothing, and smacks him in the head, temporarily disabling him, as Mindy and Sam aid Anika and go to hide in Quinn's room.\n\nAnticipating for Tara and Chad to try to return to distract him and aid, Ghostface closes the door, which locks, due to the various locks in place, as Tara hears Anika's scream as she's almost down the stairs and tells Chad from the stairwell, whose down in the foyer to listen to it and how they're still up there, referring to their sisters and Anika. Tara is unsuccessful as she tries to open the door, as she cries to Chad when asked about her keys, how she left them inside as they pound the door.\n\nSam and Mindy help Anika into Quinn's room as Ghostface almost quickly gets back up, before locking the door, bloody, as Ghostface pounds on the door and is kicking at it, to no success. They notice the conjoining bathroom door is open, which Sam whispers to Mindy to lock it and as she heads in just before Mindy finds a deceased and nude Paul 2.0's body, Quinn's lover, gutted and bloody in the bathtub, who alerts the killer due to her reaction being aloud, and is narrowly attacked once more, as Sam approaches from behind as Mindy tries to push and lock the other door but both Sam and Mindy are forced to retreat into Quinn's room as they lock the weak door and who barricade it by pushing a dresser and holding it, as Ghostface kicks the door with brute force trying to open it..\n\nDanny notifies Sam and reaches a ladder to the window from his adjacent floor apartment across them. Sam crosses first, despite her own hesitance, due to Mindy being injured and not her, as Mindy tells her frantically how one of them needs to hold it down and tells her to go with anger. Sam manages to and calls for Anika to come, but Mindy goes instead, due to Anika insisting, as the fearful and injured sapphic lovers share a final kiss, and she makes it over. When it was Anika's turn, she made it halfway across the ladder before Ghostface finally breaks down the door and the barricade and shows up behind her, much to everyone's terror as Anika falls quiet as she asks what as Mindy frantically pleads for Anika to move faster, as she turns and sobs, and tries to, as Ghostface faces them menacingly, stabbing his buck knife down and begins to lift and shake the ladder beneath her. As Sam reaches for Anika's hand, whose hanging for dear life and her body sliding slowly from the ladder, Ghostface tips it to the side and Anika loses her grip, falling off and hitting her head on the metal trash can before falling to the ground, dying instantaneously due to her head and skull being cracked open, as well as due to the blood loss from being stabbed in her stomach prior, much to Mindy's horror, who sobs in pain as Sam is shocked and stares at Ghostface who looks at them before walking into the apartment and away.\n\nMonday, October 31\n\nThe next morning, now the Core Four is shown to be shaken as they're behind ambulances, with Mindy sitting in one, as Chad stands aside his sister with Tara close to Sam, who's the most visibly distraught, apart from Mindy, smoking a cigarette as she looks at coroners having covered Anika in a body bag, as NYPD and emergency services surround the apartment, and close and tape off the building and street, much to the curiosity of New Yorkers and other civilian onlookers, about the events that occurred in the apartment and its victims the night prior.\n\nOn Halloween, the following morning, Sam and Danny have an interaction in which he tells Sam not to trust anyone, including him. Just then, Ethan arrives and gets bum rushed by Chad who thinks he attacked them last night. He claims he was in an E-Con study group, but Mindy says he's at the top of her suspect list. A tearful Wayne exits the building, as Samantha and Tara console him as Wayne agrees to aid to them, due to how Quinn died, he's been taken off the case by the NYPD.\n\nGale arrives to the scene to have a one-on-one with Sam and Tara, which they don't buy, as Gale states off the record, and informs them of finding something, as Wayne tells her to show him. Just then, Kirby arrives as Gale is surprised as they reunite, making note of the fact how Kirby's a child (a teenager when she knew her in Woodsboro in 2011), due to her youth, despite Kirby stating she's 30 and her occupation as an FBI agent. Gale then leads Kirby, the Core Four, Wayne, and Ethan to the Ghostface Shrine built at an abandoned theatre in New York City, under Jason and Greg's names, despite Kirby saying how she never found it, as the women playfully jab at each other's occupations, as Gale claims how she's just better at her job than she is and that she'll get there, being an investigative journalist.\n\nAt the shrine they find former evidence and artifacts pertaining to the first 7 Ghostface killers and massacres, as well as their victims, including props and weapons and sketches of the first 5 Ghostface murder sprees. Tara asks how it got there as Gale states how corrupt cops can sell it and evidence can get lost. At the center, is the Ghostface robes of all 9 killers, all missing their masks. Mindy is the most fascinated, as she and Chad find their Uncle Randy's work uniform. Gale's bibliography, whose books are the base of the Stab movies, are also featured, with Kirby also tearing up upon seeing Jill and Charlie's (Trevor's and Olivia's are also shown) outfits on mannequins and the knife she was stabbed with, which she tells Tara.\n\nSam hallucinates her father, Billy, as she looks at the glass case containing his robe in the center. Tara is overwhelmed and takes her inhaler, as Sam tries to converse, with Tara saying how she never wanted her life to revolve around this, referring to Sam's lineage to Billy and because of this, by association, Stab, who leaves as Kirby goes after her.\n\nKirby shares advice and talks with Tara about being a survivor and how she overcame it (homage to Sidney's Out of Darkness novel and its contents).\n\nGale shares a conversation with Sam about her past and Dewey, as each woman comforts in one another's pain endurance and survival, both from Ghostface, and family strife, laughing and sobbing.\n\nMindy and Kirby talk about horror movies and their knowledge.\n\nGale plans to bring the press here but is blocked by Kirby's authority, alongside Wayne as the NYPD\n\nWayne devises a plan to catch Ghostface with the Carpenter sisters, along with Kirby by tracking and monitoring, by making Sam and Tara both walk around Central Park and keep the killer talking if they called, with Wayne in disguise just behind them in case of an event. Kirby traces the call from a van nearby inside with Chad, Mindy, and Ethan, the latter whose eating Cheetos, as Mindy makes a reference of the plan being a bad and the irony of them being in a van, as their uncle and OG horror nerd expert Randy Meeks had died at Windsor exactly 26 years prior by being yanked into a van in broad daylight and killed.\n\nKirby manages to trace the caller as being in the Upper East Side, as Sam realizes Gale is next. Sam and Tara head off and drive away in Wayne's black logo less police car, much to his dismay and anger of how they can't do that, as the sisters head off to hurry and warn Gale.\n\nIn Gale's apartment, Ghostface calls Sam and tells her she's not near them, but one step ahead.\n\nBack at Gale's penthouse, now night, Gale is upset about being discredited and not allowed to bring press, despite discovering the shrine, as she is on her laptop, before her boyfriend, Brooks, gives her the home phone to reveal Ghostface calling, giving Gale her first official phone call with them, since Randy had intercepted the phone call by Nancy as Ghostface meant for her, thus avoiding her fate, nearly 25 years ago, of which the new Ghostface makes note of and how it's time for an interview. Gale asks the killer what their motive is, as Ghostface asks her the same, and notes her writing was made about the suffering and misery off others, profiting her via the Stab series, and how now it's her turn for someone to make a buck writing about and reporting on her death, to which Gale calls out on.\n\nOff-screen barely visible, Brooks is murdered by Ghostface in a stealthy manner, while Gale is kept on the phone, who tells the killer how they're now the tenth person to try this and how it never works, as Ghostface then taunts her about Dewey's death by Amber and Richie, much to Gale's sadness and anger. She is then shocked as she screams following Ghostface threatening her, and the killer throwing Brooks's body from where he had been killed as Ghostface approaches and gives Gale a chase and attack across her kitchen, where she hits them with a frying pan, avoiding the knife swings (nod to Scream 3 and Steven Stone), as she runs into the living room and balcony outside.\n\nGale manages to lock Ghostface out of her bedroom and grabs a gun from an electronic safe, as she shoots the door five times (reference to how many Ghostface murders had happened and films in Scream franchise), as she asks the killer aloud, how that was for nostalgia (reference to Gale having a gun and helping Sidney in killing Billy and Mickey in the first two films).\n\nGale is then called by the killer, taunting her about them getting away as Gale angrily states how that's why she's going to shoot them in the \"fucking head\", before opening the door, phone in one hand, gun drawn on the other, as she finds her penthouse seemingly empty. Ghostface makes meta commentary on the Legacy Trio, and how Gale would've made sense as the infamous killer, unlike Sidney or Dewey, and how she never got to be the leading lady, as Gale claims how she was always the brain and sex appeal. Distracted, Gale tells Ghostface if she could put them on hold, much to the killer's surprise, and before they can say anything, Gale hangs up and redials star and 69 (a reference to the second victim of Windsor, Maureen Evans, was telling Casey Becker during a sneak peek of Stab, about finding the killer by simply hanging up and just redialing, from Scream 2).\n\nGale holds her breath as she does this, which works as she hears the phone ring from her front door, who she shoots at, and hears the killer being hit and who approaches it before Ghostface then pops out and stabs Gale in her shoulder (like she was in Scream 4), surprise attacked as she's taken aback. Disarmed, Gale tries with her strength to unmask Ghostface, before failing as Ghostface then stabs her in the leg. She uses all her strength to push Ghostface and manages to stumble and get up, holding her shoulder and leg as she runs before Ghostface corners her into a wall, popping from left to right (reference to Mickey also holding Sidney near a wall while in their fight and chase scene at the theatre in 2) before Gale manages to get an upper hand. Gale also uses a copy of her first book to block hits from the knife, and just before the killer disabled her yet again, manages to flip Ghostface down and break her glass table, seemingly knocking the killer out, as Gale then proceeds to stumble on her knees on top and grab the Buck knife and who heads in to stab the killer, before they awake and stab Gale with a glass shard on the side of her abdomen, seriously injuring her.\n\nGale, now in dire condition, is rolled on her back as Ghostface gets back up, and with all remaining strength she can use, grabs the hand which Ghostface is holding and heading in to stab her with, as the knife is dangerously close to her face and eye, as she utters \"Fuck you!\", just then Sam and Tara enter, as Sam grabs Gale's gun from the floor as Sam shoots at Ghostface, who upon their entrance, got up and ran, missing Sam's shots and disappearing through the penthouse's emergency staircase exit. Sam and Tara then tend to Gale, as Sam pleads forgiveness from Gale, as Gale states how they didn't get her and to tell Sidney they never did.\n\nGale then passes out, much to Sam's sadness, even as Tara tries to console her, as medics arrive and make her move aside, who begins to sob. One of the medics detect a weak pulse, and to get her into a stretcher and into medical treatment, right away, as Sam and Tara watch helplessly, adding to the somber mood as Act 3 approaches, much to Sam's losing hope.\n\nThe Core Four, Danny, and Ethan meet up at the lobby of the downstairs lobby of Gale's penthouse, as the group suspects Danny, with a now saddened Sam agreeing to give up and how Ghostface wants her and the victims were just in the way, much to the shock of Chad, Mindy and Tara. Danny tries to comfort her, as Ethan then asks if there's anywhere, they could hide, as Tara says how no matter where they hole up, the killer will find them, which leads her to then come up with an idea of flipping the tables by luring Ghostface to them to a secure location and then executing them upon their arrival, which is the Ghostface Shrine, which she calls Wayne to help aid, alongside informing Kirby, as she would meet them at the Shrine.\n\nThe Core Four, Danny, and Ethan are then heading to the subway on Halloween night and talk about their plan and strategy, being separated by the large crowd of New Yorkers and civilians in costumes, as the Carpenter sisters, Chad, and Danny make it into one train, and while Chad tries to hold the door for his sister, isn't able due to the congestion of the crowd, as the subway train takes off, leaving Mindy behind with Ethan, of whom she still suspects, who she tells him to get away from her, gesturing her hands up in confusion when Ethan looks at her as they both wait for the next train.\n\nAt around 10:06pm, after being separated, Mindy texts Chad that she and Ethan would meet them at the theater. Due to there being various people in costumes, there's also plenty of civilians in Ghostface costumes, much to the wariness of Sam, Tara, and Chad, as one of the people in a Ghostface costume in their subway train stares menacingly at Sam the closer they approach their destination. As soon as they're onto the next stop, Ghostface approaches menacingly, to which Sam calls out, as Chad also looks up, with Ghostface shoving people, and to which Danny gets in front to protect Sam, before Ghostface leaves the subway and heads upstairs.\n\nOn the other train behind the divided Core Four, Mindy is distanced away from Ethan, whose standing on the other side with the crowd, as Mindy is driven paranoid by also various people in Ghostface costumes, and one in particular sits in silence, which freaks her out. As people hop off stops and New Yorkers enter, it forces Mindy to the back of the subway, much to her dismay. Like Sam on the train ahead of her, Mindy sees Ghostface stand and who as the tunnel heads in the dark and the light appears, sees them getting closer, and after passing a tunnel and it going dark, Ghostface doesn't appear until the next light as the subway goes on and off into the darkness of the tunnel, who covers Mindy's mouth as she's stabbed in the abdomen, much to her horror, who tries to scream, but are muffled by the killer, and whose stabbed twice, with civilians on the seats near her being asleep and others just minding their business or unaware. Mindy sobs and writhes in pain, and Ghostface lets her go as they approach the second to last stop and gets off and walks towards the crowd and disappears. Ethan notices Mindy injured and called for her, bringing attention whose sat her back against the subway door on the wall on the floor, who helps her as Mindy cries in pain as she gets up and Ethan walks her out and yells for help and for people to call 911, as NYPD medics and police officers' approach. Ethan reassures her, as Mindy claims she got it wrong and says, \"fuck this franchise\", and is taken to the hospital\n\nKirby meets Sam, Tara, Danny and Chad at the theatre, and who asks about Mindy, who Chad assures her will meet them as they got separated and is in the next train behind as Sam explained, all unaware of Mindy's attack that just took place.\n\nTuesday, November 1\n\nIt is likely after midnight when the killers are revealed. The killers Ethan, Wayne and Quinn reveal that they are Richie's family.\n\nWhen Wayne Bailey wakes up again after being knocked out and Sam calls him, the clock reads 4:27am."
