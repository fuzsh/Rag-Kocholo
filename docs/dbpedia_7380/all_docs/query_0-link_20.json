        "text": "The dog days of summer just got hotter at the Drexel as we devote Monday nights to one of the greatest action film directors of all time – “Tony Scott: Maestro of Mayhem!”\n\nThe program starts August 5 with Days of Thunder, starring Tom Cruise, Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Randy Quaid, Michael Rooker, John C. Reilly, and Cary Elwes. Cruise plays Cole Trickle, a young hotshot driver entering the ultra-competitive and dangerous world of NASCAR. Duvall is crew chief Harry Hogge, who comes out of retirement to train Trickle to be the best of the best. Unfairly dismissed as “Top Gun with race cars,” Days of Thunder features top-notch directing from Tony Scott, delivering some of the most exciting racing sequences ever put to film. Days of Thunder is also superior to Top Gun in that there is an actual romantic spark to the film: Cruise and Kidman met and fell in love on the set.\n\nScott heads down to Mexico on August 12 with Revenge, the 1990 thriller adapted from the novella by Jim Harrison. Kevin Costner stars as retired U.S. Navy aviator Jay Cochran, who travels south of the border to spend time with his crime lord friend, Tibey Mendez (played by the great Anthony Quinn). Jay falls for Tibey’s wife Miryea (Madeline Stowe) and the two carry on a covert affair. Nothing remains a secret, though, and Tibey kidnaps Miryea, leaving Jay for dead in the desert. The aviator won’t be kept down and soon begins taking out Tibey’s army in a desperate mission to find Miryea. Mega-fan Quentin Tarantino called Revenge, “ […] Tony Scott’s masterpiece. When Tony directed my first script True Romance, I’d tell everyone proudly, ‘The man who made Revenge is making my movie.’”\n\nWe jump to the twenty-first century on August 19 with Scott’s 2005 film, Domino, inspired by real-life bounty hunter Domino Harvey. Keira Knightley stars as the fashion model (and daughter of Manchurian Candidate actor Laurence Harvey) who pivots to bounty hunting to escape her dull life. Though Domino proves herself to be as tough as the macho men in the profession, her world goes haywire when $10 million disappears after a robbery. Starting with 1998’s Enemy of the State, Scott began to transition to a more frenetic, overwhelming directing style that employed extreme fast-cuts, deeply saturated colors, and overlapping dialogue. Domino is the pinnacle of this mode, resulting in a big-budget studio movie that looks and sounds like an experimental film. Mickey Rourke, Édgar Ramírez, Delroy Lindo, Christopher Walken, Jacqueline Bisset, Mo’Nique, Dabney Coleman, and Lucy Liu round out the cast."
