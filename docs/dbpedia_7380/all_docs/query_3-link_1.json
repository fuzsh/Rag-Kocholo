        "text": "Randy Quaid’s first movie role in more than half a decade is a project based in Central New York.\n\nProducers for “The Christmas Letter” shared photos of Quaid filming scenes in Vermont this week. The holiday film, which is primarily being shot in the Utica area, features Quaid as a delivery worker in a cast that includes his “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation” co-stars Chevy Chase and Brian Doyle-Murray.\n\nAccording to WKTV, Quaid couldn’t film his scenes in Utica due to a “scheduling conflict,” so the cast and crew filmed in-person scenes with Quaid in Vermont. Quaid still made a virtual appearance in Utica for a video call with Chase’s character that will appear in the movie.\n\nChase was on set Sunday at the Fort Schuyler Club in Utica, playing the general manager of a restaurant. Chase’s daughter, Caley Chase, also has a role as the maître d’.\n\nDoyle-Murray filmed his scenes earlier this month.\n\nThough none of them appeared on set at the same time, “The Christmas Letter” will be a reunion for Chase, Quaid and Doyle-Murray. All three starred in “National Lampoon’s Vacation” and the 1989 holiday sequel, “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation”; in the latter, Doyle-Murray played the boss of Chase’s Clark Griswold, kidnapped by Cousin Eddie (Quaid) after Clark complains about his Christmas bonus.\n\n“The Christmas Letter” will be Quaid’s first movie since 2018′s “All You Can Eat” and his second acting role in 15 years, according to his IMDb page. The Oscar-nominated actor also appeared in the “National Lampoon’s Vacation” franchise, “Independence Day,” “Kingpin,” “Freaked,” “Major League II,” “Brokeback Mountain” and the “Elvis” TV miniseries.\n\nQuaid fled to Canada in 2010 while facing criminal charges in California over vandalized property at a home he once owned. He was arrested in Vermont upon returning to the U.S. in 2015, but as of 2021 the case in California was reportedly still active; California tried to extradite him and his wife from Vermont, but the process was denied.\n\n“The Christmas Letter” stars Angus Benfield as an “everyday man who gets a Christmas letter every year from his (wealthier) friend” and decides to take his family on “wild, crazy adventures” for a whole year in an attempt to top his friend’s Christmas letter, according to director Tori Hunter. Benfield is also producing the project through his company LAMA Entertainment.\n\nChase is an Emmy-winning actor who was an original cast member on “Saturday Night Live” and starred in “National Lampoon’s Vacation,” “Caddyshack,” “Fletch,” “Three Amigos,” “Community,” and the Syracuse-set “Snow Day.” He previously visited Syracuse in 2019 and Utica in 2021 for screenings of “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation.”\n\nDoyle-Murray, the older brother of Bill Murray, has appeared in more than 160 movies and TV shows, including “Groundhog Day,” “Caddyshack,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Wayne’s World,” “JFK,” “Scrooged,” “Veep” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” Doyle-Murray also had a role in 1983′s “National Lampoon’s Vacation” alongside Chase and Quaid.\n\n“The Christmas Letter,” written by Michael Cunningham, an Ilion native who now lives in the Rochester area, has been shooting in the Mohawk Valley throughout the month of January. Scenes reportedly include Utica’s City Hall, the Valley View Golf Course, the Woods Valley ski area in Westernville, Thrive Athletic Center in New Hartford and The Stanley theater in Utica.\n\nA release date has not been announced for “The Christmas Letter,” but Cunningham told WKTV he hopes to do a movie premiere in Utica during the 2024 holiday season."
