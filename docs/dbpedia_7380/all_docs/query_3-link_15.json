        "text": "(CBS) - Randy Quaid said at a press conference Wednesday that he will be allowed to stay in Canada indefinitely after border authorities dropped inadmissibility proceedings against him, according to reports.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reports that Quaid's wife Evi now has Canadian citizenship and will sponsor the actor as an immigrant.\n\nEvi Quaid's father was born in Canada, and so she was granted Canadian citizenship on Feb. 10, according to the CBC.\n\n\"When Evi and I came to Canada last October we could never have envisioned how things would unfold and how our lives would change,\" Randy said at the press conference, according to the CBC. \"Today we're here to say thank you Canada. Thank you for your warm welcome. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to live in peace.\"\n\nThe Quaids claimed refugee status in Canada after failing to appear at a hearing in Santa Barbara, Calif. on felony burglary and misdemeanor charges. The charges stem from accusations they allegedly squatted in the guest house of a home they used to own.\n\nThe Quaids claim they were seeking asylum in Canada to escape from people they described as \"Hollywood star whackers\" who allegedly killed Heath Ledger, David Carradine and Chris Penn in the United States."
