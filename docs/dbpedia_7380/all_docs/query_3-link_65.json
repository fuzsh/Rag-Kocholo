        "meta_description": "Anderson County Presents the 25th Annual Celebrate Anderson Weekend Featuring Randy Houser Saturday, August 31   Gates open at 5:30pm Music starts at 6:30pm   Tickets are free and are required for entry.   LAWN TICKETS:  Bring your blankets and camp chairs to enjoy the concert from the general admission lawn *Note: to expedite security screenings, we request that you leave your chair bag at home or in your vehicle   STANDING ROOM ONLY TICKETS: Get close to the action with tickets for the standing room pit in front of the stage. No chairs or blankets will be allowed entry into the standing room pit.   About Randy Houser: With an inimitable voice The New York Times describes as “wholly different, thicker and more throbbing, a caldron bubbling over,” Randy Houser has racked up over half a dozen hits and 1 billion streams. His How Country Feels album topped the charts with the title track, “Runnin’ Outta Moonlight” and “Goodnight Kiss” (also his first No. 1 as a songwriter) and earned critical acclaim for his powerful delivery of the Top 5 smash and nominated CMA Song of the Year, “Like A Cowboy.”   With multiple sold-out shows in 2023, including an at-capacity stop at Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium, Houser wrapped 12 months of touring with Cody Johnson.   In late 2023, he landed on-screen roles in Martin Scorsese’s acclaimed film “Killers of the Flower Moon” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, as well as Dennis Quaid’s “The Hill”, an inspirational drama that hailed as the number one most streamed Netflix movie in February 2024. This April, Billboard-lauded “golden-voiced Mississippi native” Houser released his new single “Country Back”, a full throttle proclamation of all things country.   For more information, go to RandyHouser.com.",
