        "text": "The Randy and Evi Quaid saga just gets weirder and weirder. And the Oscar-nominated-actor-turned-fugitive-turned-conspiracy theorist isn’t exactly helping his case. In an interview with CBS’ Early Show this morning, Quaid, who has been on the run from authorities on felony trespassing and vandalism charges along with his wife Evi, said that he was being targeted by “star whackers.”\n\nThe Quaids say they are convinced that unnamed nefarious people are singling out celebrities to either steal their fortunes or kill them. They claim that David Carradine, who was found hanged in a Bangkok hotel room, and Heath Ledger, who died of an accidental drug overdose, were victims of the same conspiracy. Quaid has called this cabal: “star whackers.” The couple says they are currently seeking asylum and protection in Canada. Check out the entire interview below.\n\nQuaid denied the charges against him and his wife (basically that they were illegally squatting in a Santa Barbara home they’d previously sold) and provided CBS with a photo of their key in the front door as proof that they still own it. During the Early Show interview, Quaid told co-anchor Maggie Rodriguez from Vancouver that he had missed a recent court appearance because, technically, he did not have to appear.\n\nWhen Rodriguez asked the actor about his concerns for his safety, Quaid responded, “I have … I have a fear … that fear because there, for the last three years and really the last 20 years, there … I’ve been racketeered on. My finances have been decimated by a group of people, such as my ex-attorney, my ex-business manager, and an estate planner, specifically. And they have conspired together to … to co-opt my corporations, put in trustees without my knowledge.”\n\nRodriguez then asked if they were trying to kill him.\n\nQuaid replied, “Well, yes. I mean, they … not in a … not in a sense where, you know, they’re going to come out and shoot me with a gun or anything like that. But, the way they’ve manipulated the system, the court system to have us falsely arrested and to make it impossible for us to operate on a daily basis in the most basic way. I mean, banking, owning a house, renting a house, renting a car. I mean, we cannot function.” He added, “I feel if things keep going the way they are and we don’t do something to expose these people, my wife and I will be out on the street and we will have nothing to eat, okay? That’s how bad it is.”\n\nWhen asked why he thought that the people out to get him were connected to the deaths of Carradine and Ledger, Quaid said, “Well, they are star whackers.” He added, “I can’t believe that David would commit suicide. His wife recently has come out and said she doesn’t believe that … that she believes he was murdered. Heath was an athlete. He played Australian football. He was robust. I’ve had eight friends of mine who have either died mysteriously or had scandals surrounding them in recent years, and this is what I’m talking about when I [say] star whacking. I mean, it’s not killing somebody necessarily, it’s just creating a scandal or a mystery around a celebrity that discredits them.” He added, “And Heath, I think it was possible that he could have taken some tainted prescription drugs, yes.”\n\nRead more:\n\nRandy Quaid and wife arrested in Vancouver"
