        "text": "It's the public downfall of a Hollywood star, known for over 90 movies, including Brokeback Mountain and Independence Day.\n\nNow actor Randy Quaid and his wife Evi are in handcuffs as she rants about a bizarre plot to murder them, saying, \"Hollywood is murdering its movie stars.\"\n\nThey're asking for asylum in Canada, saying they fear for their lives. As if things weren't bizarre enough, their lawyer read a handwritten note to the press, saying:\n\n\"We are requesting asylum from Hollywood Star Whackers. Evi and Randy Quaid.\"\n\nSo who are the Star Whackers? The Quaids claim it's a shadowy group responsible for, what they say are the murders of actors David Carradine and Heath Ledger. The deaths of Caradine in a hotel in Thailand, and Ledger in his New York City apartment in 2008, were both ruled accidental. But the Quaids believe otherwise.\n\nAs the Quaids passed through a barrage of media, Evi Quaid said, \"Heath Ledger was murdered!\"\n\nThis is just their latest eccentric behavior that has the world wondering whether the Quaids have lost it.\n\nIn 2009 they were charged with skipping out on a $10,000 hotel bill in Santa Barbara. They're also accused of illegally squatting and then trashing a house in Montecito that they once owned.\n\nINSIDE EDITION spoke to private investigator Becky Altringer who once worked for them.\n\n\"I realized there's something just not right here, because there was just too much paranoia going on,\" said Altringer.\n\nRandy Quaid is the older brother of famed actor Dennis Quaid. He's best known for playing looney characters like cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies. But in recent years, Randy Quaid and his wife became increasingly isolated and troubled."
