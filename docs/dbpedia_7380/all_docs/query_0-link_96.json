        "text": "Lonesome Dove Theme\n\nhttps://myfavoritewesterns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lonesome-dove-1989-ost-01-theme-from-lonesome-dove.mp3\n\nLonesome Dove : Spinoffs and Wannabes\n\nThe immense success and popularity of the Lonesome Dove (1989) Mini Series starring Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones spawned a veritable industry surrounding Larry McMurtry’s iconic characters Augustus ‘Gus’ McCrae (Duvall) and Woodrow F. Call (Jones) that extends to this very day with obvious influences in several succeeding TV and Mini Series like Hell on Wheels – which seems to me to have ‘Dove‘ flavour written all over it – each attempting to recapture or exploit the magic of the original epic. Some succeed – to a degree. Others? … Not so well.\n\n3? Successive ‘Dove‘ Mini Series – plus a TV show – have attempted to take us back.\n\nAll that being said let’s look at those who have portrayed McMurtry’s two main characters over the last 25 years.\n\nI’ve debated over and over (with myself) whether I want to issue any commentary on Lonesome Dove itself – which has been covered extensively – and well – by other fans and Western critics – smarter than myself. But it seems some commentary is inevitable. So … I will get to that later.\n\nIn the meantime …\n\nThe four descendants of McMurtry’s saga:\n\nLonesome Dove (1989)\n\nReturn to Lonesome Dove (1993) – set a year after the events of Lonesome Dove, isn’t affiliated with McMurtry in any way. He does not condone the movie nor approve of it.\n\nStreets of Laredo (1995)\n\nDead Man’s Walk (1996)\n\nComanche Moon (2008)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Guns of Laredo … Part 3 … the Rifles\n\nIn Streets of Laredo we see mainly 3 standard rifles – plus a couple of oddities. There are others long guns, but their appearance is too brief to mention.\n\nFirstly we have the Winchester 73′ rifle – ‘the rifle that won the West’? Combined with the Colt 45 pistol, these are backbone of many a Western Film and probably a good chunk of Old West history as well.\n\nJames Garner (Captain F. Woodrow Call) carries two rifles (not sure why .. but Why Not?): a Winchester 73′ and a 1860 Henry Rifle Brass Frame .45 LC.\n\nNed Beatty (Judge Roy Bean) and his Winchester 73‘\n\nBetween drinking and hanging people the Judge shoots things.\n\nGeorge Carlin gets ready to demonstrate the ‘Yellow Boy‘.\n\nHang on to your ears.\n\nThe 2 Unusual Weapons\n\nCharles Martin Smith and Cannon? Sounds like a Law Firm. And he’s got the guns to back it up.\n\nThe first of the 2 unusual weapons that I spoke of, is the The Holland & Holland Paradox shotgun (well named).\n\nFrom the Internet Movie Firearms Database (http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Holland_%26_Holland_Paradox)\n\n“The Holland & Holland Paradox was an interesting design. It was a smoothbore until the end of the bores where there was rifling … The 8 and 10 gauge shotguns were considered to be the most effective against Elephant, Cape Buffalo ect, but lacked the accuracy and range of a rifle. The Paradox design was a compromise which offered improved performance from the smoothbore design … “\n\nIn other words, Charles Martin Smith is carrying an elephant gun. Sheesh.\n\nThis weapon eventually contributes to the demise of our main antagonist.\n\nThanks to my brother Richard for finding this information.\n\nDon’t ask me what the pistols are though … he never pulled ’em.\n\nCharles Martin Smith seems to have a fondness for shotguns:\n\nThat other weapon is claimed to be a Model 1889 Schmidt-Rubin rifle with Scope.\n\nApology: I lost my sources for this reference. I do recall the the individual who recognized this rifle said that this weapon did not exist in the era of Streets of Laredo. I would not be surprised as we find this quite often in Westerns (and other movies) where technology from the future is imported to the past. Most often nobody cares or notices, but some Gun and Western history fans/experts do take note.\n\nThe only thing I can say for sure it that if Joey Garza (Alexis Cruz) takes a liking to your gun, you better just give it to him. And run away. Fast.\n\nBut it might not do any good.\n\nThe Guns of Laredo … an interesting mix.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBob Dylan https://myfavoritewesterns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/warren-zevon-knocking-on-heavens-door.mp3\n\nStreets of Laredo contains most your standard Western gunfare: Yer Colt 45, Yer Winchester ’73, and Yer double barrel shotgun ….\n\nBut it also has 2 unique weapons – plus another that’s fairly uncommon.\n\nI was not able to locate any resources that specifically itemized the Guns in Streets of Laredo. It took considerable detective work to discover the identity of at least 2 of the firearms. A Thank You goes to my brother Richard who identified the mysterious and unusual shotgun carried by Charles Martin Smith.\n\nThe Handguns:\n\nMost of the main characters use handguns at some point Streets of Laredo – including Sissy Spacek and Sonja Baca.\n\nThe handgun of choice appears to be the famous Colt 45 – either long or short barrel.\n\nAlexis Cruz\n\nSonja Baca\n\nNed Beatty\n\nA Colt Refused\n\nNear the beginning Episode 1 (of 3) of Streets of Laredo, James Garner (Captain Woodrow Call) is offered a pearl handled Colt by his employer – which he refuses – upon advice there may ‘strings attached’.\n\nUncommon Gun Number One\n\nRandy Quaid, who plays the very surly John Wesley Hardin in Streets of Laredo, brandishes a nickel plated handgun that looks almost too grand to be a ‘shootin’ iron’ of the Old West.\n\nBut there it is. This gun was not easy to for me to identify and I’m still not certain I have it right, but I’m going with a:\n\nSmith & Wesson Schofield\n\nSubsequent editions of a successful weapon design often remain or appear almost identical to the original – even over years of production – with only minor refinements. Or can be copied by other Manufacturers.\n\nIn other words, they aren’t easy to identify. So this is just a guess on my part.\n\nRandy Quaid\n\nTop Breaking handguns.\n\nWhen you consider that the ‘top breaking’ feature (similar to double barrel shotgun) of this handgun appears to be make loading and unloading quicker and easier, you’d think they would have been more popular, but it seems the side loading style of the Colts was more common. I do not know who originally invented this design, but it was clearly used by other manufacturers as well – including Colt.\n\nNext:\n\nThe Guns of Laredo … Part 3 … the Rifles\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nknocking-on-heavens-door-roger-waters https://myfavoritewesterns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/knockin-on-heavens-door-mark-knopfler.mp3\n\nNO HUMANS OR HORSES WERE HARMED\n\nIN THE PRODUCTION OF THIS POST.\n\n– The Management\n\nWhen I initially started My Favorite Westerns, I had intended to include a page/section on the Guns that appear in each movie I profiled. Certain things have evolved however, to make me adjust or re-think this intention.\n\nThe first is the number of horrific and disturbing gun incidents over the last few years. Enough said… almost.\n\nThe second is less idealistic: many Westerns use the same guns – so identical gun profiles seemed redundant.\n\nBUT/YET … What the hell is a Western without a Gun? You can pretty well define Westerns by guns. There ARE a few Westerns that don’t have guns … very few. Even Little House on the Prairie had an occasional gun. Fact is, if a Old West period piece doesn’t have any guns, most of us wouldn’t even consider it a Western. Or even watch it.\n\nI’m not defending gun culture – or guns. It’s just a fact.\n\nFurther, this predilection for guns in our Entertainment is hardly unique. Take a look at the current list of films showing at your local theatre. Over half of them have guns – or violence – be it delivered via sword of Hobbit or gun by Willis.\n\nGuns? Swords? Monsters? Space ships … ? You name it … We shoot it.\n\nWe are blood soaked and blood fuelled.\n\nViolence you say? Nahhhh. They’re called ‘Action Movies’.\n\nTV is not exempt. Sports, for instance, is huge on TV … and full of violence. And it’s debatable that we would watch it if it wasn’t. A hockey, football, or baseball game with no hitting is boring. And when there’s no Action we flip the channel – searching for Action/Violence. And what about Cop Shows? Game of Thrones, etc. etc? There’s no end of examples. Even most Reality Shows have Conflicts built into their setup – to raise the Entertainment factor.\n\n“Lights! Camera! Action!” Every day, all day, year ’round, we fight – we kill.\n\nComic books? You might think you were in a porno shop … if it wasn’t for the killing. Rated G.\n\nVIdeo games? Over 90% have graphic violence and bloodshed. Killing.\n\n???\n\nBottom line: WE LOVE THIS STUFF!\n\nAnd we keep the pushing the envelope – more action, more violence, more graphic, more blood, more killing …\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAnother thing I truly wonder about is the Desensitization that seems to be occurring. Nobody bats an eye at most of this stuff any more.\n\n???\n\nThe real question though …. is WHY? do we Love this Stuff?\n\nI’m trying to come up with an answer.\n\nIn the meantime … let’s look at some guns.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nNext the … The Guns of Laredo … Part 2\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCasting Director, Lynn Kressel won Casting Awards for Streets of Laredo. Let’s see why …\n\nJames Garner\n\nNothing much needs to be said about James Garner as a Western Film Actor He’s an icon.\n\nGarner’s Westerns\n\nMaverick with Jack Kelly 1957-1962 TV\n\nShoot-Out at Medicine Bend with Randolph Scott / 1957 Movie\n\nAlias Jesse James with Bob Hope 1957 Cameo as Maverick Movie\n\nDuel at Diablo: with Sydney Poitier 1966 Movie\n\nHour of the Gun with Jason Robards 1967 Movie\n\nSupport Your Local Sheriff with Jack Elam and Walter Brennan 1966 Movie\n\nSledge with Dennis Weaver and Claude Akins 1970 Movie\n\nSupport Your Local Gunfighter with Suzanne Pleshette 1971 Movie\n\nSkin Game with Lou Gossett 1971 Movie\n\nNicols with Stuart Margolin 1971-1972 TV\n\nThe Castaway Cowboy 1974 Movie\n\nYoung Maverick with Charles Frank 1979 TV\n\nBret Maverick with Ed Bruce 1981-82 TV Movie\n\nMurphy’s Romance with Sally Field 1985 Movie\n\nSunset with Bruce Willis 1988 Movie\n\nMaverick with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, James Coburn and others 1994 Movie\n\nStreets of Laredo – 1995 TV Mini-Series\n\nSam Shepard\n\nSam Shepard seems to have Western written all over him – so we’re bit surprised that he hasn’t been in more. Yet I believe All the Pretty Horses is massively under-rated and may fare better in time. The Assassination of Jesse James … ??? the jury is still out. Thunderheart is well known – an entertaining enough movie … but a good Western? Blackthorn could have been Classic, but poor support acting let it down.\n\nVerdict? Streets of Laredo is probably the best Western Sam has ever done. And he’s damn good in it.\n\nShepards’s Westerns\n\n1978 Days of Heaven – with Richard Gere\n\n1992 Thunderheart – with Val Kilmer and Grahame Greene\n\n1995 Streets of Laredo with James Garner\n\n1999 Purgatory with Eric Roberts and Randy Quaid\n\n2000 All the Pretty Horses with Matt Damon\n\n2005 Bandidas with Penélope Cruz and Salma Hayek\n\n2007 The Assassination of Jesse James with Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck\n\n2011 Blackthorn\n\n1994 Silent Tongue / Writer / Director\n\n2014 Klondike with Richard Madden\n\nRandy Quaid\n\nRandy Quaid has been in at least 2 notable Western: The Missouri Breaks and The Long Riders – both pretty highly regarded by most Western Movie fans – some holding them as Minor Classic in quality. In Streets of Laredo he plays the famous gunslinger John Wesley Harding.\n\nQuaid Westerns\n\n1976 The Missouri Breaks with Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando\n\n1979 The Last Ride of the Dalton Gang\n\n1980 The Long Riders with Dennis Quaid, David Carradine, Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach …\n\n1999 Purgatory wtih Sam Shepard 2004 Home on the Range with Judi Dench, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rosanne Barr …\n\nSissy Spacek\n\nWe probably think Sissy Spacek has been in a few Westerns because she did Coal Minors Daughter (1980) and has done some Country Music singing and writing. But not so. Despite a ton of great work in her acting career, Sissy has done no real Westerns.\n\nShe’s in a great one this time though.\n\nDecent Western roles are tough to find for female actors- mainly because most Westerns are written by – and for – men. But McMurtry is different and Streets of Laredo includes 3 great roles for the ladies – one of which is also an excellent role for a child female actor. Good job Mr. McMurtry.\n\nWes Studi\n\nWes Studi is another actor that has well established himself as a Western Film Icon. His first 2 Westerns are undeniable Westerns Classics: Dances with Wolves and The Last of the Mohicans.\n\nMost everything else he’s done is quality work as well.\n\nWes Studi Westerns\n\n1990 Dances with Wolves with Kevin Costner\n\n1992 The Last of the Mohicans with Daniel Day Lewis\n\n1993 Geronimo: An American Legend with Gene Hackman\n\n1995 Streets of Laredo\n\n1997 Crazy Horse with Ned Beatty\n\n2005 Into the West with Russel Means\n\n2005 Miracle at Sage Creek with David Carradine\n\n2005 The New World with Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale\n\n2007 Seraphim Falls with Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Anjelica Huston\n\n2007 Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\n\n2008 Comanche Moon with Val Kilmer\n\n2009 Trail of Tears\n\n2011 Hell on Wheels with Colm Meaney\n\n2014 A Million Ways to Die in the West (post-production)\n\n2014 Palominas (pre-production)\n\nCharles Martin Smith\n\nWe wouldn’t normally think of Charles Martin Smith as being a Western Actor but, incredibly, Smith has appeared in at least one bona fide Western Classic: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and two other worthy Westerns:Culpepper Cattle Co. and The Spikes Gang. That’s 3 out 3 Chuck – Not bad for a green horn.\n\nIn Streets of Laredo, Smith plays the ‘everyday man’ – that’s you and me – the guy we’re supposed to relate with. His character can’t handle the rugged and vicious Western world he suddenly finds himself in – and makes us wonder if we could cut it either. Possibly not.\n\nCharles Martin Smith Westerns\n\n1972 The Culpepper Cattle Co.\n\n1973 Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid\n\n1974 The Spikes Gang\n\nSonia Braga\n\nBrazilian actress and International Film Star, Sonia Braga has 75 film credits to her name.\n\nAnd when you see here performance in Streets of Laredo, it’s hard to believe she too has no Westerns among them.\n\nShe was Nominated forNCLR Bravo Award 1996 for her performance in Streets of Laredo.\n\nNed Beaty\n\nIn Streets of Laredo, Ned Beaty is well recognized – even with his Santa Claus beard. Beaty is another actor we are surprised to find has made very few Westerns – in his long career where he has appeared in over 100 films – and has been nominated for an Academy Award, two Emmy Awards, an MTV Movie Award and a Golden Globe Award; he won a Drama Desk Award also.\n\nBut he’s done a couple.\n\n2011 Rango\n\n1996 Crazy Horse\n\n1994 Outlaws: The Legend of O.B. Taggart\n\n1975 Gunsmoke (TV)\n\n1972 The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean with Paul Newman\n\nGeorge Carlin\n\nYou might have to shake your head for a second when you see George Carlin in Streets of Laredo. The second surprise is that he does a hell of job. Completely believable and in command of his part. Makes you wish he’d done more.\n\nVanessa Martinez\n\nVanessa Martinez is that 3rd female role I was talking about – playing Sonia Braga’s blind daughter. She is superb – and we wonder why we haven’t seen more of her either ??\n\nAlexis Cruz\n\nAn unlikely badguy we may think – almost baby faced. But Cruz is ominous and lethal as the psychopathic killer tracked by Garner. Yet another actor we’ve seen little of since Laredo.\n\nThough still active in TV and Film, Cruz seems to have fallen from view.\n\nAlexis Cruz Westerns:\n\n1997 The Brave (A Western?) I note this here because it Stars Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nAn impressive cast. In an excellent production.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
