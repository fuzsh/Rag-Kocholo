        "text": "Randy Quaid and his wife are scheduled to appear in court Tuesday for an arraignment on felony vandalism charges, although it remains to be seen whether the couple will return from Canada for the hearing.\n\nThe couple have been staying in Vancouver in recent weeks and have sought asylum there from a mysterious group they have dubbed \"Hollywood star whackers.\" With a string of missed court appearances on a previous criminal case, the couple had to post $1 million bail to guarantee their appearance.\n\nThe previous case of defrauding an innkeeper was resolved earlier this year and the Quaids had remained out of trouble until September, when they were found living in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned. The current owners called authorities and accused Quaid and his wife, Evi, of causing serious damage to the property.\n\nIn mid-October they missed a hearing after felony vandalism and misdemeanor trespassing charges were filed and were arrested days later in a posh shopping area of Vancouver.\n\nThey immediately sought refugee status and through an attorney said they were fearful of \"star whackers\" who they say may have had a role in the deaths of stars such as David Carradine, who was found hanging in a Bangkok hotel room, and Heath Ledger, who died of accidental drug overdose in New York City.\n\nThey repeated their claims in an interview aired Monday on \"Good Morning America\" and indicated they hoped to remain in Canada.\n\nWhether their stated fears will keep them away from court remains to be seen. A prosecutor said Monday that their hearing remained scheduled. The Quaids' attorney, Robert Sanger, declined to comment.\n\nRandy Quaid, 60, is the older brother of Dennis Quaid. Best known for his quirky supporting roles in films such as \"Independence Day\" and \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" he has also been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nHe won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson in a 1988 TV movie, and even brought his award to a hearing in the previous criminal case."
