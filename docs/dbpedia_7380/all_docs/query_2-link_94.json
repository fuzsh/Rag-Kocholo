        "text": "By Lou Ann Anderson\n\nAs Texas native and actor Randy Quaid along with wife Evi face legal issues both in a Santa Barbara Superior Court and a Canadian immigration court, the couple’s “Hollywood star-whackers” claims continue to fuel questions of the couple being crazy, paranoid or on drugs. Answers remain unclear, but one thing is certain: the “crazy and outrageous” claims made by the Quaids about their own estate theft and networks of organized professionals seeking to loot estate assets parallel probate corruption cases that quietly happen every day.\n\nIt’s easy for the general public and legal industry insiders to summarily dismiss these claims as “they’re nuts,” “that can’t happen” or “they must have asked for it.” The reality, however, is that contrived scenarios enabling Involuntary Redistribution of Assets (IRA) actions – illicit confiscations or diversions of property via trusts, wills, guardianships/conservatorships or powers of attorney – are becoming more common and impacting a wide range of Americans.\n\nAn August 2010 Courthouse News article describes a lawsuit filed by Randy and Evi Quaid:\n\nRandy Quaid and wife, Evi"
