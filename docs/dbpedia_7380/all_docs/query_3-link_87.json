        "text": "The Beautiful Game calls to you.\n\nCoupeville students heading into grades 8-12 are invited to swing by the CHS commons Wednesday between 2:00-3:30 PM to get info on playing soccer for the Wolves.\n\nCoaches Kimberly Kisch and Robert Wood will be on hand to answer questions and hand out fliers with info on summer and fall schedules, and players can get in the loop early.\n\nWhether you’re a returning player or a first timer, this is a great opportunity to join a program on the rise.\n\nWith Coupeville being a 2B school, eighth graders are eligible to play for the high school while still attending middle school, giving younger players a chance to put together a five-year prep career on the pitch.\n\nThe Wolves hope to pick up enough female players to return to having two separate squads in the fall after playing as a co-ed team last season.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe tribes are merging.\n\nIn the wake of Coupeville High School cancelling its varsity girls’ soccer schedule due to a lack of players, those booters who did turn out will unite with their male counterparts to form a co-ed program.\n\nThe revamped Wolves will feature both varsity and JV teams, with player placement based on “game skill, determination, and leadership skills,” said girls’ coach Kimberly Kisch.\n\nThe set-up, which is only in place for the 2023 season at this point, will play against boys’ teams from the Northwest 2B/1B League.\n\nSeveral of Coupeville’s rivals, such as Lopez Island, have fielded co-ed teams in previous seasons.\n\nSchools at the 2B or 1B classification are allowed to use female players on male teams, if the school doesn’t have an active girls’ program in that sport.\n\nFor the Wolves, early practices drew 10 female players, while CHS Athletic Director Willie Smith stipulated the program needed 15 to be viable.\n\nWhen it became apparent Coupeville couldn’t get to that number, the painful decision was made to cancel the varsity season for a girls’ program which has played 19 consecutive seasons since launching in 2004.\n\nSmith and Kisch discussed other options, such as having the Wolves play a JV-only schedule, but that would likely require 7 v 7 games instead of the standard 11 v 11, with a very-limited set of opponents.\n\nAfter consultation with CHS boys’ coach Robert Wood, the decision was handed to the players.\n\n“After many discussions, team votes, and meetings, we decided we will merge our girls’ team with the boys,” Kisch said. “Ultimately we left the decision up to the team and they feel that this is the best option.”\n\nBoth coaches are intrigued by the possibilities of the new set-up, which will give Wolf girls a chance to keep their program alive, while adding a new wrinkle to the boys team.\n\n“I truly believe that this will be a fantastic learning experience for all involved,” Kisch said. “Our coaching team is prepared to coordinate and organize a large team.\n\n“We will have plenty of players for a first and second team, while also giving everyone plenty of field time.”\n\nWood, who has floated the idea of calling the unity team “CHS FC,” is raring to go with the Wolves set to open the season Sept. 12 at home against defending 2B/1B boys state champ Friday Harbor.\n\n“One academy, with a first and second team,” he said. “Dreams do come true!”\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n“It’s time to play to win!”\n\nClashing with teams in the Northwest 2B/1B League, home of the last two state champs, the Coupeville High School boys’ soccer squad has its work cut out for it.\n\nEven more this year, with District 1 seeing its tickets to the big dance cut from four to three.\n\nBut Coupeville coach Robert Wood is making no excuses.\n\nWhile he lost four seniors to graduation, including leading scorer Aidan Wilson, the Wolves have one of their most-solid rosters in years.\n\nBetter yet, it’s full of players with experience from playing under fire against state champs Friday Harbor and Orcas Island, as well as other top NWL programs.\n\n“We have a solid number of players — finally — a foundation of skill and drive and focus, and an injection of energy and talent,” Wood said.\n\nCoupeville returns 11 of a possible 12 players, while also picking up a strong group of newcomers.\n\n“Four freshmen already making an impact at practice, showing the seniors they want their spot!” Wood said. “Plus, two transfers from the football program showing the same intent.”\n\nWith the first week of practice unfolding, the Wolves are trying different looks and lineups to see what clicks.\n\n“Formation and positions are still being determined,” Wood said. “Strengths and weaknesses are still being determined, but our talent and camaraderie are both sure to help the team grow together and succeed.”\n\nCoupeville went 5-9 last year, falling to Summit Atlas in the district playoffs.\n\nEarly in the season, they shocked Friday Harbor 3-1 at Mickey Clark Field, handing the eventual state champs one of only two losses the Wolverines suffered during their golden season.\n\nKey to that victory was following Wood’s teachings about playing as one unit.\n\n“Teamwork and patience is always the focus of our work,” he said. “Soccer is a game of chess on a very large field.\n\n“The game itself is the ultimate teacher,” Wood added. “And if you’re not willing to learn then it is not only blatantly obvious, but the team suffers.”\n\nCoupeville has a 12-game slate this season, with all games against NWL foes, though the first four will be counted as non-league clashes.\n\nThe Wolves play five of their first seven at home, before wrapping things up with four of five on the road.\n\nOf those home games, four will be played on Friday night in prime time, with Coupeville’s football team making trips off of Whidbey Island those same evenings.\n\nCHS doesn’t charge admission for soccer, with Sept. 15 (Providence Classical Christian), Sept. 29 (Cedar Park Christian), Oct. 6 (Grace Academy) and Oct. 20 (La Conner) an ideal chance for Wolf fans to support their pitch program.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSoccer, forever trying to confuse me.\n\nIf it’s not the mind-melting offside rule or the love of an 80-minute game ending in a scoreless tie, it’s the scheduling.\n\nAs in, while all of the games played by the Coupeville High School boy soccer squad this season are against fellow Northwest 2B/1B League schools, not all of them will count in the standings that way.\n\nThe Wolves have scrapped with Mount Vernon Christian, Cedar Park Christian-Lynnwood, and La Conner, winning the middle of those tilts.\n\nAnd coming up next are home bouts with the top two NWL squads, Friday Harbor and defending state champion Orcas Island.\n\nBut, when that’s all said and done, while CHS will have five games in the win-loss column, none of them will have counted as league contests.\n\nInstead, the final eight games of the regular season between Oct. 4-27, with one clash against each of the other eight schools to play boys soccer in the NWL, will be the “official” league games.\n\nThat stretch, and only that stretch, determines playoff seeding.\n\nThe quirk is a product of the fact the NWL picks up four outside schools — Lopez Island, Grace Academy, CPC, and Providence Classical Christian — for boys soccer, and boys soccer alone.\n\nThose schools join Coupeville, MVC, Friday Harbor, Orcas Island, and La Conner, while NWL charter members Concrete and Darrington don’t field teams.\n\nHaving eight league rivals makes it nearly impossible to play each school twice.\n\nNWL girls soccer, by contrast, has just four schools active in the sport — Coupeville, La Conner, MVC, and Friday Harbor, so six home-and-away league clashes are easy-peasy to schedule.\n\nOrcas, Darrington, and Concrete don’t have female booters, and the league doesn’t import any outside girls squads to pad its numbers.\n\nTechnically, Lopez Island considers its soccer team co-ed, so Coupeville’s boys have faced an occasional girl during previous games.\n\nIn the end, Coupeville’s boys have a 13-game schedule, play the same team twice five times, but count only the last eight as league contests.\n\nIt also means when Friday Harbor KO’d Orcas earlier this week, handing the Viking boys their first home loss in five years, it didn’t have any impact on postseason seeding.\n\nTheir Oct. 11 rematch, however, could go a long way to deciding a league title.\n\nIn the end, Coupeville pitch guru Robert Wood looks at the whole affair with a bemused smile and a chuckle.\n\n“Not sure why … don’t care either … that’s an administrative thing and I HATE admin work.”\n\nAnd then he went back to describing the beauty of a scoreless tie.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nDon’t call it a comeback.\n\nWell, OK, actually you can call it just that, I guess.\n\nPlaying out a plot familiar to vampire film fans, the Coupeville High School boys soccer program had a stake driven through its heart, only to rise again in a new, stronger form.\n\nAfter the first week of practice, it became apparent the Wolves couldn’t field a full 11-man team.\n\nThat forced CHS Athletic Director Willie Smith to pull the plug, and he cancelled the boys pitch season April 2.\n\nBut then, plot twist.\n\nWith San Juan Island experiencing a spike in Covid cases, Friday Harbor High School went Smith one better, shutting down all of its fall sports programs.\n\nThat erased Coupeville’s only boys tennis foe, ending the Wolf hardcourt season before it began.\n\nIt also raised the possibility of CHS netters jumping to the pitch, and, with a revived push, new Wolf boys soccer head coach Robert Wood found enough bodies to field the necessary roster to play.\n\n“Great team, great attitudes, great (weather) forecast (for the first game),” Wood said. “All kinds of great.”\n\nNow on the comeback trail, Coupeville will open play at home this Friday, with a revamped six-game schedule during this pandemic-shortened campaign.\n\nThat equals the number of games the Wolf girls soccer squad is playing this season.\n\nThe new schedule:\n\nFri-April 16 — Cedar Park Christian (6:00)\n\nWed-April 21 — @ Grace Academy (3:30)\n\nTues-April 27 — @ Mount Vernon Christian (4:00)\n\nThur-April 29 — Providence Classical Christian (6:00)\n\nMon-May 3 — Orcas Island (4:00)\n\nWed-May 5 — @ La Conner (6:00)\n\nRead Full Post »"
