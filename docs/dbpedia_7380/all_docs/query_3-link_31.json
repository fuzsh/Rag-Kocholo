        "text": "ANTHONY McCARTNEY, AP Entertainment Writer\n\nSANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) — Randy Quaid and his wife remain fugitives from a California court after the couple failed to appear Tuesday for their arraignment on felony vandalism charges for the fourth time.\n\nSanta Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck refused to schedule a new court date for the couple, instead leaving their arrest warrants active. Randy and Evi Quaid have already forfeited more than $1 million in bail for their slew of missed appearances.\n\nRandy Quaid's attorney, Robert Sanger, told the judge that Canadian authorities had confiscated the actor's passport. The Quaids are seeking asylum there, claiming they fear a group they've dubbed the \"Hollywood star-whackers.\"\n\n\"Mr. Quaid has had multiple occasions to appear on this matter prior to his passport being taken,\" Geck said.\n\nThe Quaids are accused of causing more than $5,000 in damage to the guesthouse of a home they once owned and were allegedly squatting in when they were arrested in September. The current owners are seeking a lengthy restraining order against the Quaids, but a hearing scheduled for Tuesday was continued until Dec. 28 because the couple had not been served.\n\nSanger said he hoped the Quaids would eventually return to resolve the case without being re-arrested.\n\n\"This is something that has become much larger than life,\" Sanger said. \"I think Randy Quaid has been a very significant actor in the course of his career. I would like to see him get back and get this taken care of.\"\n\nRandy Quaid is due back in a Canadian immigration court Nov. 23.\n\nEvi Quaid remains on probation for a previous case in which she and her husband were accused of defrauding an innkeeper of more than $10,000. She pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor earlier this year, the inn was repaid, and a charge against Randy Quaid was dropped.\n\nA hearing to determine whether Evi Quaid violated her probation due to the current case is expected to be held once after she returns to Santa Barbara. Sanger said Tuesday he no longer had the authorization to represent her in that case.\n\nRandy Quaid is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. He is best-known for his roles in films such as \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" and \"Independence Day.\" He won a Golden Globe award — which he brought to court during one of his appearances in the innkeeper case — for his depiction of President Lyndon Johnson in a TV movie in the late 1980s. He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar in 1973 for his role in \"The Last Detail.\"\n\nThe Quaids claim the \"Hollywood star-whackers\" may be responsible for the deaths of actors such as Heath Ledger and David Carradine, and they believe the culprits are targeting them next. Carradine was found hanging in a Bangkok hotel room, and Ledger died of accidental drug overdose in New York City. Neither actor's death was ruled suspicious."
