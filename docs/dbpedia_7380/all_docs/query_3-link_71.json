In Los Angeles, after notable roles in film and television, Bruce endeared himself to fans everywhere in a four-year run on CBS-TV’s SCARECROW AND MRS. KING. Boxleitner is also internationally known for his science fiction roles in both the TRON franchise as well as his starring work in the hit series BABYLON 5. Bruce has serious western street cred. Early in his career he guest starred on the very last episode of GUNSMOKE (“The Sharecroppers” 1975). He later co-starred with James Arness in HOW THE WEST WAS WON, the 1988 remake of RED RIVER and GUNSMOKE: ONE MAN’S JUSTICE. Other westerns include two of Kenny Rogers’ GAMBLER films, WYATT EARP: RETURN TO TOMBSTONE and an adaptation of Louis L’Amour’s DOWN THE LONG HILLS.

In one of the most unusual casting arrangements in movie history, David, Keith, and Robert Carradine played the Younger brothers in THE LONG RIDERS with three other sets of acting brothers: Stacy and James Keach, Dennis and Randy Quaid, and Christopher and Nicholas Guest. .\n\nJim Clark – To label James (Jim) Clark a train buff would be an unforgivable understatement. After leaving Carson City in 1986, he became the go-to man in Southern California and the Southwest for movies and TV shows, building track and providing and running trains for Western, action and other productions. He also served as a stuntman. His film credits, now totaling about 250, include movies “Wild, Wild West,” “Under Siege II” and “Eraser,” and TV shows “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman” and “MacGyver.”\n\nIn 1999, the producers of the movie Wild, Wild West were looking for some trains. Not just any trains. One had to look like a post-Civil War locomotive hauling a special car for special agents Jim West and Artemus Gordon (hoo-rah!). The other engine—manipulated by the evil genius Dr. Arliss Loveless (hssssss!)—needed to somewhat resemble a huge combat tank. But producers are Hollywood types, and they generally don’t know anything about railroad equipment. So the movie makers called in the “Train Man.” Enter Jim Clark. He told them how to bring rough drawings to life. He found the locomotives and the train cars, he helped design the train stunts and oversaw all the railroad aspects of the flick. Okay, so the film derailed. At least the trains were great. Thanks to the Train Man.\n\nOver the next nearly 20 years, Jim Clark was hired to do the train work on more than 200 productions—including TV shows such as Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and MacGyver. Among his movie credits are Throw Momma from the Train, Eraser, Switchback, Under Siege 2, Lethal Weapon 4, Money Train and, of course, Wild, Wild West and Disney’s, 2012; The Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp. In 2005, his work was an important part of the Steven Spielberg mini-series “Into the West”.\n\nClark now lives in Virginia City, Nevada Still in touch with the Hollywood community, but now focused on his grandchildren, and at times, lecturing on Trains in movies.\n\nSee Full article – True West Magazine (Jim Clark – Trainman\n\nDiamond Farnsworth is an accomplished stuntman, serving as stunt coordinator on the show NCIS, and before that working on JAG and QUANTUM LEAP. Diamond is the son of Academy Award® Nominated actor/stuntman Richard Farnsworth. He began his stunt career in 1968 and has been serving as a stunt coordinator since 1980. He began with PAINT YOUR WAGON and served as a stunt double for Sylvester Stallone in FIRST BLOOD, RAMBO and RHINESTONE. He has also doubled Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid and Jeff Bridges.\n\nRory Flynn – Like many other children of world-famous movie stars, Rory Flynn grew up in Hollywood and attended Hollywood High. But her childhood revolved around her father and the films he was making. Errol Flynn built a beautiful house high up in the hills he called Mulholland Farm, an apt name as Rory remembers. “He brought home an animal from almost every movie set that he worked on. So we had sheep dogs, horses, chickens and that horrible monkey Chico that I think he brought home from Elizabeth and Essex. That monkey used to terrorize us if he ever got in the house. It was a nightmare. My father eventually gave him to the Los Angeles Zoo.“\n\nRory was six foot tall and thin in High School, “very much the opposite of what was cool.” But a lucky meeting with a New York photographer resulted in a photo session, which led to a career as an international fashion model all over Europe, even meeting Salvadore Dali, “who painted me into one of his enormous paintings.” In 1971 she began a long term relationship with rock drummer Alan White from Yes and they stayed together in London throughout the decade during the peak of the rock and roll world.\n\nIn 1980 Rory returned to Hollywood. “ I decided I needed to find a career; modeling is a very short-lived job.” She took photography classes at UCLA. “I basically hustled my way into my first job on a film called Return of the Living Dead. I barely knew what I was doing and I didn’t know anybody could work 15 hour days.” Rory eventually became a skilled Still Photographer and moved to ABC, shooting all the network’s sitcoms and Movies of the Week. In 1987, on a film in Sri Lanka, she met her future husband, producer Gideon Amir, and teamed up professionally and personally. Married 36 years, their son Rio is an actor like his legendary grandfather, working as Sean Flynn.\n\nAnd her life has come full circle; she has created her own Mulholland Farm. “I have a great love of animals just like my father and decided I wanted acres. We moved permanently to Georgia where most filming for television has been done for the last 10 years. We live on 5 acres. I rescue horses. I have two horses right now, two dogs, six cats, ten Koi fish in a pond, and a birdfeeder with video assist that records all the birds that come to eat so I can see them on my iPhone. As of now I’m checking off my bucket list. I am taking flying lessons in a 172 Cessna and I started taking piano lessons two years ago and life is good.”\n\nRory has written a well-received book about growing up with her father called THE BARON OF MULHOLLAND: A Daughter Remembers Errol Flynn. She travels extensively, hosting screenings of her father’s films all over the world. This is her first visit to Lone Pine, where her father made CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE and KIM.\n\nBurton Gilliam – Before acting, Burton Gilliam was a member of the Coast Guard’s boxing team where he won 201 out of 217 fights. He remained in the boxing world for decades, working as a referee when he moved to California.\n\nWhile working as a fireman for the city of Dallas, Burton appeared in the role of “Floyd”, the desk clerk, in the film PAPER MOON (1973). He then was convinced to quit his job as a fireman and join the cast of Mel Brooks’ BLAZING SADDLES. With his toothy grin and likeable screen presence, Burton was an in demand character actor appearing in such hit movies as BACK TO THE FUTURE Part III, HONEYMOON IN VEGAS, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT, FLETCH, GATOR and TELEFON. His television appearances include facing down Bruce Boxleitner in the series HOW THE WEST WAS WON and riding alongside James Arness and Boxleitner again in the remake of RED RIVER (1988).\n\nBurton’s other westerns include HEARTS OF THE WEST, THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF, ANOTHER MAN, ANOTHER CHANCE, YOUNG MAVERICK, GUN SHY, BEST OF THE WEST, the mini-series DREAM WEST, WILD BILL, MI AMIGO, THE JOURNEYMAN and WALKER: TEXAS RANGER.\n\nGilliam was born in Dallas, Texas, and lives near there with his wife. He graduated high school in 1956 and was inducted into the school’s Hall of Fame. He has two children and four grandchildren.\n\nDarby Hinton – Just before he turned 6, actor/producer/writer Darby Hinton accidentally stood in the wrong line at Twentieth Century Fox and landed the part of Israel Boone with Fess Park on Daniel Boone which ran from 1964-1970 – and still works today in many TV and film projects. Hinton considers some of his most important work to be with the SAG/AFTRA Young Performers Committee, geared to helping the creative youth of today.\n\nC.

College years and time in the Coast Guard gave me a more objective slant and I finally decided that I wanted a career in the entertainment business.”\n\nMany of the films Wayne has appeared in have become memorable examples of American motion picture making. His credits include The Long Grey Line, Mister Roberts, The Searchers, The Alamo, and McLintock!, to name but a few.
