        "text": "André René Roussimoff was born in a small farming community in Grenoble, France to Boris and Marian Rouismoff. His parents and four siblings were all of normal size, but André suffered from acromegaly, a hormonal disorder that results when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone. As the Giant grew up (very quickly, as he reached the height of 6' 3\" by the age of 12) he began to often disagree with his parents. He left home at 14 and obtained a job with a furniture-moving firm and began to play rugby. At 17 he was seen training at a gym by several professional wrestlers. Impressed by his size, they taught him some basic wrestling skills and built a friendship with him. Later, when one of the wrestlers was injured, André stepped in for him. He would wrestle for nearly thirty more years. By his early 20s André had wrestled in Algeria, South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, England, Scotland, and most of non-Communist Europe but had not found fame. In 1971 he came to North America under the name Jean Ferre and was mildly popular in Canada. Then he met a New York based booker by the name of Vincent J. McMahon (often incorrectly referred to as \"Vince McMahon Sr\") who renamed him \"Andre the Giant,\" and billed him as 7' 4\" (Andre was really closer to 7'). Soon Andre the Giant became a national sensation and was a much sought after wrestler. In addition he participated in television, movies, and commercials. With his wealth the Giant bought a ranch in Ellerbe, North Carolina where he would live during his rare time off and after he retired from wrestling in 1990. He died while in France after attending his father's funeral. André was cremated and his ashes were spread across his ranch. He is survived by his one daughter.\n\nGheorghe, a native of the Transylvania region of Romania, has become one of the top centers in the NBA. A dominant force in Europe, he began his NBA career feeling a little out of place. That quickly changed when he bumped the Bullets regular center and became the starter. He contributed almost immediately with his large powerful arms and towering presence. Gheorghe's height is not due to genetics, but to a pitituary gland condition. His late mother was 5'7\" and his father is 5'9\". Gheorghe, once regarded as an oddity by many, went on to win the 1995-1996 NBA Most Improved Player award. He has led the NBA in field-goal percentage in both the 95-96 season and the 96-97 season. His presence is sorely missed by the Wizards during the 97-98 season, as he has not played a single minute due to injury. When he returns however, his fans and teammates will certainly be relieved to know that \"Big Gheorghe\" is back patrolling the paint.\n\nPeter Mayhew was born on May 19, 1944 in Barnes, London, England, to Constance Elizabeth (Yeates) and Walter Henry Mayhew. Later resident in Texas, this former resident of Yorkshire, England, was working as a hospital attendant at the King's College Hospital in London when film producer Charles H. Schneer saw his photo, literally standing above the crowd around him. Schneer cast him in Sindbad und das Auge des Tigers (1977), Ray Harryhausen's special effects film.\n\nA year later, he was offered another role. Mayhew was told it was for a big hairy beast. It was the role of Chewbacca, the faithful 200 year-old Wookiee in Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) and his life was changed forever. Following the original Star Wars trilogy, he made several television commercials in the Wookiee costume.\n\nIn 1997, the 20th-anniversary celebrations of Star Wars were announced with the release of the \"Special Edition\" and all the conventions started. He was active on the \"Star Wars\" convention circuit where he signed autographs. He wrote two books, \"Growing Up Giant\" and \"My Favorite Giant\", and founded a non-profit 501(c)3 charity organization called \"The Peter Mayhew Foundation\".\n\nTowering 7' 2\" tall actor who cornered the market on playing giants, intimidating henchmen, bayou swamp monsters and steel toothed villains! Kiel worked in numerous jobs including as a night club bouncer and a cemetery plot salesman, before breaking into film & TV in several minor roles in the late 1950s / early 1960s. Noted among these was the alien \"Kanamit\" in the classic Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959) episode \"To Serve Man\", and terrorizing Arch Hall Jr. while clad in a loincloth in the prehistoric caveman meets virile teenage drama Eegah (1962).\n\nKiel turned up in two episodes of the classic horror TV series Der Nachtjäger (1974). On one occasion playing a Native American evil spirit with the ability to transform into various animals. On his second appearance, Kiel was unrecognizable as a Spanish moss covered, Louisiana swamp monster brought to life by a patient involved in deep sleep therapy.\n\nHowever, his biggest break came in 1977 when he was cast as the unstoppable, steel toothed henchman \"Jaws\" in the finest Roger Moore film of the Bond series Der Spion, der mich liebte (1977). Such was Kiel's popularity with movie audiences, that his character was brought back for the next Bond outing Moonraker - Streng geheim (1979). However, audiences were quite split on opinions when Kiel's \"Jaws\" character changes sides near the film's conclusion and assists 007, Roger Moore, in saving the Earth.\n\nOver the next few years, Kiel appeared in relatively non-demanding comedy or fantasy type films taking advantage of his physical stature and presence. Kiel then decided to try his hand behind the camera and co-wrote and produced, plus took the lead role, in the well received family movie Amy und der Riese aus den Donnerbergen (1990). Demand for Kiel's unique attributes dropped very sharply in the 1990's, leading to only a handful of roles including reprising his \"Jaws\" character in the Matthew Broderick film Inspektor Gadget (1999). In 2002, Kiel penned his informative autobiography entitled \"Making it BIG in the movies\". He passed away in 2014.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar is an American retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers. During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. A member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.\n\nIn 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career and won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the \"Showtime\" era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and got past the first round 14 times; his teams reached the NBA Finals on 10 occasions.\n\nAt the time of his retirement at age 42 in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in points scored (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes played (57,446), field goals made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), career wins (1,074), and personal fouls (4,657). In 2007, ESPN voted him the greatest center of all time, in 2008, they named him the \"greatest player in college basketball history\", and in 2016, they named him the second best player in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan). Abdul-Jabbar has also been an actor, a basketball coach, and a best-selling author.\n\nShaquille O'Neal is a retired professional American basketball player who is a sports analyst on the television program Inside the NBA on TNT. He is considered one of the greatest players in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. He was one of the tallest and heaviest players ever. O'Neal played for six teams over his 19-year career.\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999-2000 MVP award, the 1992-93 NBA Rookie of the Year award, 15 All-Star game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards, three Finals MVP awards, two scoring titles, 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. Largely due to his ability to dunk the basketball, O'Neal ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%). O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, Shaq Diesel, going platinum. O'Neal is an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as Diesel. He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows.\n\nCarel Struycken was born in the Hague, The Netherlands. When he was four years old his family moved to Curacao, an island in the Caribbean. At age sixteen, he returned to his home country, where he finished high school. He graduated from the directing program at the film school in Amsterdam, following which he did a year at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter school, he collaborated on a number of projects of writer/director Rene Daalder. He was \"discovered\" as an actor at the corner of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles by a lady who had abandoned her car in the middle of the street, calling after him, \"We need you for a movie!\". The movie was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978). The turning point in his acting career however was Kampf um Endor (1985), a George Lucas film. In addition to cinema, he has also appeared on television, notably as the recurring character, valet Mr. Homn, on Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987).\n\nCarel has also helped in hardware and software development of virtual reality systems.\n\nA class clown since his earliest years, Mark quickly learned that a wild sense of humor could take him places. While working at a drugstore after quitting college he honed and polished a comedy act that he regularly practiced on customers. It was these customers, as well as his family and friends, who finally encouraged Mark to try his stand-up routine at area comedy clubs. With legendary comedian Richard Pryor as his inspiration, Mark made his debut in Oakland and eventually became the city's most sought-after stand-up comic. His success there paved the way for comedy-club bookings all over the world\n\nNathan Jones's saga is a tapestry of raw power and entertainment, woven from the rugged landscapes of Australia to the glitz of global arenas. A towering figure at 6' 11\", he carved his niche as a colossus in strength athletics, power-lifting his way to stardom in the mid-90s. His moniker \"Megaman\" aptly captured his gargantuan presence, which saw him dominate strongman contests, including a notable victory in the Highland Games World Strongman Challenge at 26.\n\nBorn to a lineage of extraordinary individuals, Nathan inherited a legacy of strength and intellect. With roots stretching from the champion caber tosser grandfather in New Zealand to the nautical engineer great grandfather who miraculously survived the icy River Thames, his heritage is a chronicle of triumph over adversity. This lineage of achievers, including an Olympic cyclist grandfather with a penchant for physics and electrical engineering, set the stage for Nathan's own feats of strength and skill.\n\nNathan's transition to WWE in 2002 unveiled \"The Colossus of Boggo Road\" on the SmackDown! roster, a title that evoked his turbulent past and resilience. His stint in professional wrestling was highlighted by appearances with icons like The Undertaker and in marquee events such as WrestleMania XIX.\n\nThe turn of fate that launched his acting career was as serendipitous as it was spectacular, with martial arts superstar Jackie Chan propelling him onto the silver screen. Nathan's filmography is marked by formidable characters, from the imposing Boagrius in \"TROY\" to the menacing Rictus Erectus in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\". His roles span mythic warriors to modern-day villains, each embodying an intensity that is quintessentially Nathan Jones.\n\nOff-screen, Nathan's life is anchored in Queensland, Australia, where he resides with his wife Fawn Tran, his son Justice, and a narrative rich with the spoils of a life lived large. His journey from strongman to screen is not just a story of personal success but a testament to the indomitable human spirit.\n\nWritten by F. Tran\n\nRetired Canadian professional wrestler turned actor. Trained under Bret Hart, Leo Burke and Stephen Petitpas. Debuted in 1989 as the Acadian Giant for Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling. Competed for years in Canada, Japan and South Korea, using the name Goliath El Gigante. Arrived in the U.S. in 1997 as the Interrogator of the Truth Commission, a team with the gimmick of a South African white supremacist paramilitary group, with the name being a reference to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Truth Commission (The Interrogator and Recon (Barry Buchanan)) were 3x USWA (United States Wrestling Association in Memphis) World Tag Team Champions. The Truth Commission (Interrogator, Recon, Sniper [Luc Poirier] and manager the Commandant (Robin Smith) debuted in WWE as heels (Smith was replaced by the Jackyl (Don Callis) in September). After the Jackyl took over the group, they evolved into more of a commando cult. Maillet was reintroduced on the December 8, 1997 \"WWF Raw Is War\" as Kurrgan, a name taken from Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986). Kurrgan and the Jackyl broke away from the Truth Commission, effectively ending the group. Kurrgan was built up as a monster heel, crushing his opponents with his claw hold the Paralyzer. He entered the 1998 Royal Rumble at #12. He eliminated Headbanger Mosh and Steve Blackman, and it took five guys, 8-Ball, Bradshaw, Ken Shamrock, Phineas I. Godwinn and the Rock, to eliminate him. He disappeared for a few months until he returned as a member of the Jackyl's new stable the Oddities on the June 15th \"WWF Raw is War.\" After the Jackyl was replaced by Sable (Rena Lesnar) and the Insane Clown Posse joined the group, Kurrgan became a face (good guy) for the first time in his U.S. career. The Oddities by the end of 1998 were reduced to Kurrgan, Golga (John Tenta), the Giant Silva (Paulo Silva) and George 'The Animal' Steele and were jobbed out (lost all their matches) on the weekend B-shows \"WWF Jakked\" and \"WWF Sunday Night Heat\" and were all released in early 1999. Continued to compete in Canada and elsewhere before retiring and focusing on acting. He is also a former 2x ECCW (Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling in British Columbia, Canada) Heavyweight Champion.\n\nStanding 6 feet 9 inches tall, Garrett grew up in Woodland Hills outside of Los Angeles.

In 1984, he became the first $100,000 grand champion winner in the comedy category of Star Search (1983). This led to his first appearance, at age 23, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), making him one of the youngest comedians ever to perform on the show. In 1986, Garrett told a joke the talent booker warned him against and he hasn't been on the show since.
