        "text": "%photo13%Randy Quaid's depressing, yet undeniably comical, dissolve into madness continued yesterday, with he and his equally batty wife facing a warrant for their arrest for vandalizing a home that was once theirs (they claim it still is). The couple is in Canada, seeking asylum because they believe they are being hunted by murderers who have been killing actors who have been in movies with Quaid. They call them \"Star Whackers.\" The theoretical murderers, not the Quaids. (That would be a terrific name for a Hollywood gardening service, by the way.)\n\nThe couple talked to \"Good Morning America\" on Monday and did little to persuade the world of their sanity. To remind what this is all about, quoth Evi Quaid, to police last year (who arrested the couple for unpaid hotel bills):\n\nThis is a movie site, not a pathopsychology site, so we're not going to get into whether or not Quaid and his wife are insane. (Though they're obviously insane.) We just want to appreciate Quaid the actor. He has been in two good movies over the last 15 years: \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Kingpin.\" (If you want to count \"Independence Day,\" be our guest.) And considering how bizarre his actions have been of late, it's difficult to see anyone rushing to employ Dennis' older brother anytime soon. (Shame: He'd have been perfect to take over for Mel Gibson in \"Hangover 2.\")\n\nBut it's worth remembering just how good Quaid has been at times in his career; on the whole, we've found him more soulful and hangdog tragic than his brother. (Who is not exactly looking sane himself these days.) Perhaps his most famous role is in the \"Vacation\" movies -- and he's quite funny in them -- but we've always liked his cynical newspaper columnist in Ron Howard's \"The Paper.\" (He gives the film its one spark of soul when he convinces Glenn Close to run a damaging story she'd previously spiked.) He was wonderful in \"The Last Detail\" -- the film that gave him his lone Oscar nomination -- and he's had key roles in some rather fantastic movies, from \"Midnight Express\" to \"The Last Picture Show\" (his first film). He's also particularly likable in Bill Murray's \"Quick Change,\" a lovely movie no one remembers.\n\nWe know it's fun to laugh and point at the weirdo actor who went crazy, but Quaid, he deserves better. We just hope he ends up OK.\n\n%video1%"
