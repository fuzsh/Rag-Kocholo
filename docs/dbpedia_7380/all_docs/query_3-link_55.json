        "text": "Don Swayze was born on August 10, 1958 in Houston, Texas as Donald Carl Swayze. He is the son of Patsy Swayze (née Yvonne Helen Karnes; 1927-2013), a choreographer, dance instructor, and dancer, and Jesse Wayne Swayze (1925-1982), an engineering draftsman. He had two brothers, Patrick Swayze (1952-2009) and Sean Swayze (b. 1962), and two sisters, Vickie Lynn (1949-1994) and Bambi Swayze.\n\nHe began his acting career in the 1980s in TV shows and TV movies. Unlike his older brother, Don often played violent and unsavory characters. Early roles in Street Hawk (1985), Ein Colt für alle Fälle (1981), L.A. Law: Staranwälte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986), and in Matlock (1986) (as a mentally handicapped murder suspect) led to his first film role in Andrey Konchalovskiy's Shy People - Bedrohliches Schweigen (1987) as Mark. During the 1990s, he guest-starred for example in Columbo (1971), Renegade - Gnadenlose Jagd (1992), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993), Superman: Die Abenteuer von Lois & Clark (1993) as Jesse James, Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), and Profiler (1996). He also worked as a stunt man. In Letters from a Killer (1998), he was a stunt player. In Movie Stars (1999), he played a fictional version of himself. During the 2000s, he guest-starred in Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993), Lady Cops - Knallhart weiblich (2001), Navy CIS (2003), CSI: Miami (2002), and Without a Trace - Spurlos verschwunden (2002). He also had recurring roles in HBO's Carnivàle (2003) as Tattooed Man, in True Blood (2008) as Gus, a werewolf, and in The Bridge - America (2013) as Tampa Tim. He also played a serial killer, Charles Hankel in two episodes of Criminal Minds (2005).\n\nIn 2012, he starred in two westerns, Heathens and Thieves (2012) and Hateful Ambush at Dark Canyon (2012). He also appeared in horror movies, in Lizzie (2012) as Daniel Allen and in The Appearing (2014) as Sheriff Hendricks. He appeared on stage in 2001 as Pedro in \"Man of La Mancha\", and in 2005 as Roy in the comedy \"Lone Star\".\n\nHe was married to Marcia Swayze (1985-1993), with whom he has a daughter, Danielle. Since 2014, he has been married to Charlene Swayze.\n\nRandy Quaid is an Academy Award-nominated actor, for his performance in Das letzte Kommando (1973). Hal Ashby directed Quaid in the role of Meadows opposite Jack Nicholson and Otis Young. Quaid is a great and much-admired actor that has been recognized by Hollywood and the world's finest directors, Midnight Express, The Last Picture Show, Ice Harvest (2005), Real Time (2008), King Carlos in Goya's Ghosts (2006) for director Milos Forman. Forman cast Quaid as \"King Carlos IV of Spain\" after seeing his Golden Globe-nominated performance as The Colonel in Elvis. Quaid also starred in such mainstream favorites as Kingpin (1996), Vacation (1983), Christmas Vacation (1989) and Independence day (1996).\n\nQuaid earned a Golden Globe for portraying Lyndon Johnson, and received a Golden Globe Nomination for incarnating \"Colonel\" Tom Parker in Elvis (2005). The portrait of Colonel Parker, a former carnival barker with a murky past, is dark. The New York Times said \"Mr. Quaid is riveting as the bully of Graceland\" when he has Elvis firmly under his thumb, he is the L.B.J. of rock 'n' roll - a towering, wheedling, tirelessly self-promoting Southern fox in the rare instances when Elvis defies him, Colonel Parker shrinks into a hand-wringing phony, cajoling his only client in the overly ornate language of Professor Marvel in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nQuaid stars in and was nominated for The Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a cast for his work in Brokeback Mountain (2005), directed by Ang Lee from a script written by Larry McMurtry, who also wrote Die letzte Vorstellung (1971) in which Quaid had his first feature film role. Working with McMurtry and supporting his material has become a Randy Quaid career tradition. Quaid's performance in Brokeback Mountain (2005) was listed as one of the New York Observer's 2005 Noteworthy male performances. In 2009 Randy Quaid Won the Vancouver Critics Award for Best Male Performance in the Feature Film Real-Time for the Role of Rubin an Australian Hit Man.\n\nRandy Quaid was born in Houston, Texas, to Juanita Bonnie Dale (Jordan), a real estate agent, and William Rudy Quaid, an electrician. He grew up in the Houston suburban city of Bellaire, along with his brother, actor Dennis Quaid.\n\nQuaid is married to American Film Director Evi Quaid.\n\nGrammy and Golden Globe nominated artist Frank Stallone is one of the most versatile actors, singers and musicians in the business. His explosive voice and his range from comedy to drama and rock to blues to big band, leaves audiences entertained and captivated.\n\nFrank has garnered three Platinum Albums, ten Gold Albums and five Gold Singles and has acted in over 60 films and TV shows including Walker Texas Ranger, multiple sitcoms and variety shows, Hudson Hawk, Staying Alive, Fred Claus, and Tombstone, in which he made a big impact as \"Ed Bailey,\" a dangerous gunslinger. One of his most memorable film roles was as \"Eddie,\" the bartender in Barfly, which was touted by critic Roger Ebert: \"Barfly is a terrific film that features an outstanding performance by Frank Stallone...he's both captivating and terrifying at the same time.\"\n\nFrank has written and published over 200 songs and, with his newest single in The Expendables 2 (Don't Want to Fight With Me), has written and recorded compositions for nine films, including Rocky I, II and III, Rambo II, Paradise Alley and Over the Top. But, it was Frank's nine songs that he wrote and recorded for the Saturday Night Fever Sequel \"Staying Alive\" that earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Soundtrack and a Grammy nomination for Best Original Song with his single, Far From Over. That song became a massive number#1 hit around the world and stayed on the top charts for more than four months.\n\nAt a young age, the Maryland-born, Philadelphia-raised native pursued his musical ambitions, forming a series of bands, and finally turned professional at the tender age of 15 (\"I had to lie about my age,\" admits Frank). His group, Valentine, included lead guitarist John Oates (Hall and Oates) and was signed to RCA Records in 1975, when they recorded their first album. Frank made his on-screen singing debut, performing the self-penned a Capella song, Take You Back in the opening scene of the film Rocky. \"The only reason I got the part was that I was the only musician my brother, Sylvester, knew...and I worked cheap.\"\n\nFrank has recorded nine solo albums receiving praise from legends Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Sammy Cahn. His rock-influenced Full Circle, \"which I feel is my best\" was followed by his American songbook albums, In Love in Vain, with Sammy Nestico, Stallone on Stallone by Request, a compilation of Frank's film soundtrack tunes, and Songs from the Saddle, showing Frank's more acoustic side. He's a big fan favorite in Australia and he performs in concert halls, theaters and clubs all around the world, gaining critical acclaim wherever he goes \"he has the crowd enthralled.\" (New York Daily News)\n\nFrank is a guitar, music, mafia and art aficionado, is one of the best boxing historians and collectors in the world and is an avid collector of guitars, guns and memorabilia. When he's not writing songs or filming a project, he can be found on a shooting range or at the gym but he's happiest with a guitar, beautiful women and good glass of vino. If you ask why he's never been married, he'll tell you \"I guess I just forgot.\"\n\nKevin Farley (accomplished actor, writer, director) has truly established himself as a comedic presence both on the big screen and television.\n\nKevin was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Mary Anne (Crosby) and Thomas Farley, who owned an oil company. Among his siblings are actors John Farley and the late Chris Farley. He is of Irish heritage. He has two other brothers and sisters--Barb, a nursery school teacher, and Tom Jr., who works for a marketing firm. His cousin is James Duncan Farley Jr., CEO of Ford Motor Company.

However, Chris soon convinced him to try show business. Kevin first went on stage at the Chicago ImprovOlympic.\n\nFarley eventually moved to Chicago and studied at the famed Second City. The minute he relocated to Los Angeles he began landing roles in films such as Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Then Farley landed a starring role as \"Doug Linus\" on MTV's sitcom 2gether where he was met with rave reviews. After that Farley appeared in numerous TV series programs such as That '70s Show, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Joey, Just Shoot Me, Curb Your Enthusiasm and many more. When Farley moved more into feature films, his unsurprising emphasis was exclusively on comedy. He appeared in the Adam Sandler animated comedy Eight Crazy Nights, and soon after The Waterboy, Dirty Work, the Cedric the Entertainer laugh-fest Johnson Family Vacation to name a few.\n\nIn 2008, Farley starred in the lead role of An American Carol, playing a cynical, anti-American \"Hollywood\" filmmaker who sets out on a crusade to abolish the 4th of July holiday. He is visited by three spirits who take him on a hilarious journey in an attempt to show him the true meaning of America. This comedy film (directed by David Zucker) is a parody of liberal filmmaker Michael Moore that \"lampoons contemporary American culture, particularly Hollywood.\" It uses the framework of A Christmas Carol but moves the setting of the story from Christmas to Independence Day. The supporting cast included Kelsey Grammer, Jon Voight, Dennis Hopper, and Leslie Nielsen. Farley co-wrote, directed and starred in Hollywood Wine. The film also stars Chazz Palminteri, Chris Kattan, David Spade, Norm MacDonald and Jeremy London.\n\nMulti tasking is easy for Farley - he does it all with a fabulously contagious sense of humor, both on screen and off. Kevin resides in New York.\n\nChad Lowe is an American actor, director, and producer.\n\nHe was born Charles Davis Lowe II in Dayton, Ohio, to Barbara Lynn (Hepler), a school teacher, and Charles Davis Lowe, a trial lawyer.

Tod eines Teenagers (1984) is a dark drama about the problems teenagers often face and the subsequent danger of suicide relating to these problems. It was the first film to properly address the subject. The film also features then up-and-coming actors Sherilyn Fenn and Casey Siemaszko.\n\nSchatten des Ruhms (1986), a drama shot for TV, saw Chad starring alongside Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Wagner. He then co-starred with Donald Sutherland and Mia Sara in the occult horror film Die Nacht der Dämonen (1988). Chad saw the eighties out with the thriller True Blood (1989) with Jeff Fahey, James Tolkan, and Sherilyn Fenn.\n\nNext, he and Tommy Lee Jones headlined the long-running Hallmark Hall of Fame (1951) anthology, in the TV Movie segment 'April Morning' (1987). The movie is based upon the novel by the late Howard Fast and is set during the American Revolution or American War of Independence (1775-1783).\n\nHe worked steadily throughout the nineties, acting in both TV and film. In 1990 he starred with David Soul and Edward Herrmann in the TV drama Mörder Clan (1990). The witty drama Späte Leidenschaft (1991) followed the next year. Chad then played Charlie Sykes in the oddball fantasy-comedy-horror road movie Highway zur Hölle (1991).\n\nBut his role as AIDS victim Jesse McKenna in Alles Okay, Corky? (1989) (1991-1993) is perhaps his most well-known. He starred with Bill Smitrovich and Patti LuPone. His performance won him an Emmy Award.\n\nIn 2000 Chad played country and western legend John Denver in Take Me Home: The John Denver Story (2000), a movie based on the musician's life and book.\n\nChad then starred with Richard Gere and Diane Lane in the ambitious thriller, Untreu (2002).

At a young age, she and her brother River Phoenix were singing on the streets of South America for money for their growing family. As the years carried on, Rain became a big sister to brother, Joaquin, and sister, Liberty. When Arlyn was pregnant with Rain's youngest sister, Summer, the Bottom family were moving back to the United States and changed their name to 'Phoenix', to commemorate their new beginning. With a love of nature and animals, the Phoenixes decided to become vegans. A short while later, all five talented Phoenix children were signed to agent Iris Burton.\n\nOver the years, Rain has starred along celebrities like Julia Stiles, Josh Hartnett and Uma Thurman. Her love of music has lead her to appear in such bands as Aleka's Attic, whom her brother River was also in, The Causey Way with her sister Summer and her band, The Paper Cranes with her husband, Michael Tubbs. She also toured with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers as a backup singer during their 'One Hot Minute' tour in 1996. A good friend of Michael Stipe, they have collaborated together on many projects (including the soundtrack to Happiness, and several REM songs).\n\nCasey Affleck is a renowned American actor, filmmaker, and producer recognized for his captivating performances and commitment to independent cinema.

Throughout his career, he has consistently delivered performances of exceptional depth and nuance in a wide range of film genres.\n\nAffleck's breakout role came in Andrew Dominik's critically acclaimed character drama, \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007). His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\n\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007).

This experimental project demonstrated Affleck's willingness to challenge conventional storytelling formats.\n\nIn 2016, Affleck returned to the spotlight with his career-defining performance in Kenneth Lonergan's profoundly moving drama, \"Manchester by the Sea.\" His portrayal of Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken man coping with immense loss, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor.
