        "text": "US actor Randy Quaid is due to appear in court in Vermont on Monday over a California vandalism case.\n\nQuaid, 65, and his wife, Evi, were taken into custody on Friday night by Vermont police while trying to enter the US from Canada.\n\nThey fled to Canada in 2010 after facing charges of vandalism and squatting in a Santa Barbara property.\n\nBut his request for refugee status, in which he claimed his life was in danger from organised crime, had been denied.\n\nQuaid was recently informed he would be sent back to the US to face criminal charges.\n\nHis wife has dual US-Canadian citizenship.\n\nThe Quaids are alleged to have caused more than $5,000 (Â£3,253) in damage to a property in Santa Barbara, which they claim belongs to them.\n\nSanta Barbara officials have previously said they would arrest Quaid if he returned to the US.\n\nAt a hearing in 2010, he told a Canadian court he was being targeted by \"Hollywood star whackers\", and that eight of his fellow actors had been \"murdered in odd, strange manners\", including Heath Ledger and David Carradine.\n\nQuaid, the older brother of fellow actor Dennis, is best known for his roles in such films as Kingpin, National Lampoon's Vacation and The Last Detail.\n\nHe and his wife Evi have been posting bizarre expletive-ridden videos on their YouTube channel, denouncing the US authorities' attempts to force them back."
