        "text": "A low-budget breakout film that wowed critics and audiences on its initial release, Stranger than Paradise would prove to be a seminal film in the new American independent cinema movement and establish its director, Jim Jarmusch, as a hip, cult auteur. Taking inspiration from 1960s underground filmmaking, international art cinema, genre cinema, and punk culture, Jarmusch's film provides a bridge between midnight movie features and a new mode of quirky, offbeat independent filmmaking. This book probes the film's production history, initial reception, aesthetics, and legacy in order to understand its place within the cult film canon. In examining the film's cult pedigree, it explores a number of threads that fed into the film – including New York downtown culture of the early 1980s and Jarmusch's involvement in music – as well as reflecting on how the film's status has developed alongside Jarmusch's subsequent output and reputation.\n\n| The paper examines the social identity of individuals in the top tiers of Hollywood stardom alongside historical and cultural factors that have created a naturalized connection between whiteness and American movie stardom. The discussion considers the cultural implications of actors' physiognomies, stars' function as commercial assets, and Hollywood norms that ree ect the perspective of dominant social groups. It proposes that research on the cultural signii cance of performers who represent the heterogeneity of American society , together with work that foregrounds the conventional whiteness of movie stardom, will generate a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of lm performers' cultural appeal.\n\nEvelyn Preer was an African American stage and film performer who achieved popularity in late 1920s. Before her untimely death in 1932, at the age of 36, Preer starred in 16 films, most of which were directed and produced by a prolific Black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux. Although a potent symbol in Black domain, her status as a screen star remained largely unexamined by contemporary white critics. Instead, the popular press concentrated on stage performances, such as Preer’s titular role in Broadway adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s Salomé. This article examines the debates that surrounded Black female entertainers—especially Preer, but also Florence Mills—by drawing on Chicago Defender, New York Age and other African American newspapers of the era. It uses Preer as a primary case study to characterise the ways in which Black stardom was discursively similar to, but also necessarily different, from the constructions of dominant, Hollywood stardom. It situates African American within the gendered rhetoric of respectability, the New Negro discourse, and patriarchal ideas of the acting profession. Preer’s visibility in the white domain constituted an act of resistance, and a reminder of the Black struggle for equality.\n\nRace, class, and politics in film comedy have been debated in the field of African American culture and aesthetics, with scholars and filmmakers arguing the merits of narrative space without adequately addressing the issue of subversive agency of aesthetic expression by black film comedians. With special attention to the 1980-1989 work of comedian Eddie Murphy, this study will look at the film and television work found in this moment as an incisive cut in traditional Hollywood industry and narrative practices in order to show black comedic agency through aesthetic and cinematic narrative subversion. Through close examination of the film, Beverly Hills Cop (Brest, 1984), this project works to shed new light on the cinematic and standup trickster influences of comedy, and the little recognized existence of the 1980s as a decade that defines a base period for chronicling and inspecting the black aesthetic narrative subversion of American film comedy.
