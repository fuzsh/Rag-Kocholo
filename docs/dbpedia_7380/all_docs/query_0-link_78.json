        "text": "There aren't many siblings who can call themselves Oscar winners, but the Afflecks are members of that exclusive club. Casey earned a Best Actor nod in 2017 for \"Manchester by the Sea,\" while big brother Ben is a two-time winner for Best Original Screenplay (\"Good Will Hunting\" and Best Picture (\"Argo,\" which he directed). The brothers' work in \"Good Will Hunting\" remains quite dysfunctionally hilarious.\n\nThe five Arquette siblings have all made names for themselves on screen and off. David (\"Scream,\" \"Never Been Kissed\") might be best known for being married to Courteney Cox. Rosanna (\"Desperately Seeking Susan,\" \"The Execuitioner Song\") is believed to be the inspiration for the 1980s hit \"Rosanna\" by Toto. Patricia went from being chased by Freddy Krueger to winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for \"Boyhood.\" Richmond has been relegated mostly to bit parts in both film and TV, while Alexis, born Robert Arquette, worked as an actor (\"The Wedding Singer\") and activist before passing away in 2016 at age 47 due to complications from HIV.\n\nThese guys even had their own \"E! True Hollywood Story,\" which made sense because they've all had drama play out off screen. Alec, no doubt, has always been the most recognizable and successful of the four brothers and remains one of Hollywood's biggest stars today, most recently for portraying President Donald Trump on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Daniel and William are still active in film and TV, while Stephen will pop up on the air from time to time.\n\nJustine earned stardom in the '80s as ditzy Mallory Keaton in \"Family Ties\" and really should be lauded for actually singing in the 1988 bomb \"Satisfaction,\" which also featured Julia Roberts and Liam Neeson. However, it's Jason who has gone from snarky child actor on \"Silver Spoons\" and then \"Valerie\"/\"Valerie's Family\"/\"The Hogan Family\" to adult star of the wildly popular \"Arrested Development\" — in which his older sis made a hilarious Season 3 appearance — not to mention Jason's memorable supporting roles in \"DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story\" and \"Juno.\"\n\nTalk about Hollywood sibling royalty. Beatty was a recipient of the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Award and is the only one to receive Academy Award nominations for acting, directing, writing and producing on the same film — twice (\"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"Reds\"). However, he might be best known nowadays for his 2017 Academy Award flub. MacLaine is a six-time Oscar nominee and won Best Actress for \"Terms of Endearment.\" She's also won an Emmy — in this life, and perhaps her others as well.\n\nDuring his brief career, John Belushi gave us memorable characters from his time on \"Saturday Night Live\" and standout performances in two of the most memorable comedies ever: \"Animal House\" and \"The Blue Brothers.\" Younger brother Jim is not nearly as funny, but he has managed to churn out a lengthy career in film and TV. His one-two punch of \"About Last Night\" and \"The Principal\" remains his high point.\n\nThe sons of legendary actor Lloyd Bridges, these brothers have done pretty well for themselves and enjoy a special bond through their craft. Beau's a Golden Globe and Emmy winner, and he even has a Grammy for Spoken Word. Jeff is a seven-time Academy Award nominee and took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in 2009's \"Crazy Heart,\" though he might be forever known as \"The Dude\" (\"Big Lebowkski\"). They're also well-known for sharing the screen, along with Michelle Pfeiffer, in 1989's \"The Fabulous Baker Boys.\"\n\nFor some, the recent passing of Einstein (\"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Arrested Development\"), aka satirical stuntman Super Dave Osborne, was the first time it was known he's the older brother of Brooks (\"Broadcast News,\" \"Drive\"). They're known for their unique brand of comedy — Brooks is a little drier, while Einstein was more over the top at times.\n\nBig brother Kirk was one of the hottest teen stars of the 1980s and early '90s as Mike Seaver in \"Growing Pains.\" While Kirk's focus has since shifted to Christian evangelism, former \"Full House\" star Candace remains a prominent television personality. She's continued the Tanner legacy in Netflix's \"Fuller House\" and has become a staple on the Hallmark Channel movie circuit. Kirk did make an appearance on \"Full House\" back in the day, as D.J.'s cousin Steve.\n\nAs of spring 2018, the Cusack siblings appeared in 10 movies together, sometimes interacting and other times not. Their brother-sister dynamic was on full display in the 1989 hit \"Say Anything.\" As in that film, John has made a career from several memorable starring performances (\"Better Off Dead,\" \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" and \"Being John Malkovich\"). Joan, meanwhile, has shined in supporting roles in \"Working Girl\" and \"In & Out\" — for which she earned Oscar nominations.\n\nZooey can be a little quirky, while Emily is usually the more straight-laced of the duo. While the younger Zooey has enjoyed a more successful film career (\"Almost Famous,\" \"500 Days of Summer\"), each starred on successful, long-running TV series. Emily was the logic-consumed, socially awkward forensic anthropologist, Dr. Temperance Brennan, on \"Bones\" and Zooey, who made a cameo on her sister's show, was the good-hearted Jess in \"New Girl.\"\n\nWhile Matt (\"The Outsiders,\" \"The Flamingo Kid,\" \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" \"There's Something About Mary\") has been a legitimate Hollywood star since the days of \"My Bodyguard,\" Kevin has enjoyed a successful career in supporting roles (\"Platoon,\" \"The Doors\"). However, he finally broke out as Johnny \"Drama\" Chase on the HBO hit \"Entourage,\" which earned him three Emmy nominations.\n\nTheir relationship hasn't always been the healthiest, but the sons of Martin Sheen have certainly enjoyed success in film and TV — and made sure they enjoyed life off both. Charlie Sheen broke out with starring roles in \"Platoon\" and \"Wall Street,\" while Estevez flourished with fellow Brat Packers thanks to \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" Sheen became an even bigger star via \"Two and a Half Men\" and a Hollywood punchline as a result. Estevez also works often behind the camera. Their most recognizable work together came in \"Young Guns,\" \"Men at Work\" and as the adult film-directing Mitchell brothers in \"Rated X.\"\n\nRalph achieved his greatest acting success in the 1990s when he earned Academy Award nominations for \"Schindler's List\" (Best Supporting Actor) and \"The English Patient\" (Best Actor) but also shined in 2008's \"The Duchess,\" a year later in \"The Hurt Locker\" and 2014's \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" Younger brother Joseph broke through with his performance in \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998), and has enjoyed TV success courtesy of \"American Horror Story\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" Their sisters, Martha and Sophie, are both filmmakers.\n\nJane is known as a multi-Oscar nominee (taking home Best Actress wins for 1971's \"Klute\" and '78's \"Coming Home\"), box-office star and home workout queen. But while Peter was often considered to be living in the shadow of his older sister and legendary actor father, Henry, he has more than held his own in Hollywood. He earned Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay (\"Easy Rider,\" 1969) and Best Actor (\"Ulee's Gold,\" 1997), the latter for which he won a Golden Globe.\n\nThe Gyllenhaal's could be the current power brother-sister pair in Hollywood. The offspring of film directing and screenwriting parents, they gained acclaim in the 2001-cult classic \"Donnie Darko\" but have had no trouble thriving on their own. Jake reached superstar status with \"Brokeback Mountain,\" while Maggie received an Oscar nomination for her supporting role in 2009's \"Crazy Heart\" and the Best Actress Golden Globe for the TV series \"The Honourable Woman.\"\n\nLiam made his mark in the ridiculously successful \"Hunger Games\" films, while Chris has his place firmly entrenched in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Thor. Can you get much bigger than those two gigs? Then there is Luke, who hasn't done too shabby with roles in the TV series \"Neighbours\" and currently on HBO's sci-fi hit \"Westworld.\"\n\nIt's hard to find a sibling pair with a more extensive, collective film resume than the Chicago-born Madsens. Michael is well-known for memorable roles in such projects as \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Donnie Brasco\" and \"Strength and Honour.\" Virginia, meanwhile, has enjoyed consistent success and earned an Academy Award nomination for her supporting role as the educated wine-loving waitress, Maya, in 2004's \"Sideways.\"\n\nThese sisters are descendants of pro football royalty but have enjoyed championship-like success on the big screen and TV. Kate (\"We Are Marshall,\" \"Transcendence,\" \"American Horror Story,\" \"House of Cards\") got the ball rolling. Then younger sister Rooney followed with supporting but memorable roles in \"Tanner Hall\" and \"The Social Network. Her breakout, however, was her Oscar-nominated role in 2011's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"\n\nIt started with Mary-Kate and Ashley doubling as the lovable Michelle Tanner on TGIF juggernaut \"Full House,\" then joining forces to earn even more popularity and money though TV and video projects. Now in their 30s, fashion is their game, while younger sister Elizabeth has become a regular in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Scarlet Witch.\n\nMoviegoers were introduced to the Phoenix family through the late River's stellar performances in \"Stand By Me,\" \"Running on Empty\" and \"My Own Private Idaho.\" Brother Joaquin (\"Parenthood,\" \"Walk the Line\") has picked up the torch and achieved his own success as an actor. Sisters Rain, Liberty and Summer have also enjoyed careers in acting, music and modeling.\n\nIt's still hard for some to believe that the ruggedly handsome Dennis and burly Randy are brothers. Dennis has been going strong since the days of \"Breaking Away\" and also delivered in films such as \"The Right Stuff\" and \"The Big Easy.\" Randy, meanwhile, is best known for his recurring role as Cousin Eddie in the \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" movies despite having an extensive and genuinely successful film resume. The brothers, who starred together in 1980's \"The Long Riders,\" have also dealt with their fair share of drama off screen.\n\nThe sons of famed Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård (\"Good Will Hunting,\" \"Mamma Mia!\"), Alexander (\"Pretty Little Lies,\" \"True Blood\"), Gustaf (\"Vikings\"), Bill (\"It\") and Valter have built quite the collective resume. Their talent combined with their good looks make them the current \"it\" family — pun intended — of Hollywood.\n\nThere might not be a more versatile entertainment family than the Wayans. Their prominence began when Keenen Ivory Wayans, the oldest of the popular Wayans siblings, co-wrote \"Hollywood Shuffle\" in the late 1980s then created the Fox sketch comedy hit \"In Living Color,\" which introduced the world to Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx. Brothers Damon, Shawn, Marlon and sister Kim have also continued to flourish though acting, directing, stand-up and screenwriting.\n\nThough fellow brother Andrew (\"Whip It!\") Wilson should not be forgotten, Luke and Owen continue to make us laugh on a regular basis. Luke's gems include \"Bottle Rocket,\" \"Old School,\" \"Rushmore\" and \"Legally Blonde.\" Owen (\"Cars,\" \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Zoolander\") meanwhile, is the real star of the family, and earned writing acclaim while working with Wes Anderson on such projects as \"Bottle Rocket,\" \"Rushmore\" and \"The Royal Tenenbaums.\" The brothers have often appeared on screen together, including their portrayal of the Wright brothers in \"Around the World in 80 Days.\""
