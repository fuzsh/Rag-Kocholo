        "text": "LINCOLN, Vt. – When Randy and Evi Quaid announced they would be settling in Lincoln, customers of the general store at the center of town were shocked by how different the actor looks from his role as Cousin Eddie in National Lampoon’s Vacation series.\n\nHowever, the store's regulars agreed his bushy beard and long hair help him “fit right in,” Lincoln General Store owner Vaneasa Stearns said.\n\nStearns, who has owned the store for 24 years, said last Monday that some locals suggested Randy Quaid take on a new role — Santa Claus at the fire department’s Christmas fundraiser.\n\n“He has the acting skills too,” Stearns quipped.\n\nRandy Quaid, 65, and Evi Quaid, 52, both of California, were arrested in Vermont on Oct. 9 on charges that they were fugitives from justice after attempting to cross the border from Canada. They remain wanted in other states on 2010 charges of vandalism, unauthorized entry into a home and failure to appear in court. Evi Quaid also is charged with resisting and obstructing law enforcement officers.\n\nSince their arrests and subsequent release from prison, the couple has been staying with several of Evi Quaid’s friends in the Lincoln area, where she grew up, lawyer Peter Langrock said. All Vermont charges against them were dropped on Oct. 15.\n\nRandy Quaid has stated an interest in joining the town's 34-person volunteer fire company.\n\nThe pair initially moved to Lincoln to be with Evi Quaid’s father, George Motolanez, a longtime Russian instructor at Middlebury Union High School and Middlebury College. Motolanez has been ill and has not yet returned from New Jersey, Langrock said.\n\nIn the meantime, the Independence Day actor has been touring his wife's home state, posting pictures of their adventures to Twitter.\n\nLangrock, hired to represent the couple in Vermont, said his clients are declining to do interviews with members of the press as they prepare for their next steps in what has become an odd saga.\n\nFrom Santa Barbara to Lincoln\n\nLincoln is a far cry both in distance and in culture from Santa Barbara, California, where the couple lived until their legal trouble began. The two have been married for 26 years, according to Evi Quaid's Twitter account.\n\nThe pair fled to Canada to seek asylum in 2010, saying they were being chased by the Hollywood \"star whackers,\" who they believe killed other celebrities, USA TODAY has reported. They then attempted to gain Canadian citizenship, but Randy Quaid's request was denied in 2012 while Evi Quaid's was granted, the Associated Press reported in October. The two attempted to cross the border into West Berkshire, Vt., days after Canadian officials said he would be deported.\n\nWhile almost equal in square mileage, the Town of Lincoln is far less populous than the Quaid's former city of Santa Barbara, according to data from the locales' respective websites. Lincoln has just over 1,200 residents, and nearly 90,000 people live in Santa Barbara.\n\nLincoln General Store owner Stearns said the Quaids will find it easy to be anonymous since the town defies most “small-town” stereotypes. She said that residents give each other space.\n\nThere is far less privacy to be had in Santa Barbara. The city has gained a reputation as a tourist destination and a major employment center, resulting in a daytime population of at least 130,000 people, according to the city's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.\n\nThe sleepy Vermont town at the foot of Mount Abraham, where the Quaids have said they'll settle, boasts a number of long-established families. Lincoln's historical society web page states \"more than a handful of local families are represented by multiple generations on communal properties.\"\n\n“I think for the most part, people are excited that they’re here, and I think if they want privacy, Lincoln’s the best place for it,” Stearns said.\n\nStearns said Quaid sightings are still a topic of conversation among customers, but the novelty of the couple's presence has faded.\n\nThe couple visited Bristol Falls last weekend and shared pictures on Twitter of themselves standing by what Evi Quaid described as a “childhood swimming hole.”\n\n“Still amazing,” she added in her post.\n\nStearns said Evi Quaid has visited the store, but that the visit was “nondescript.” She said last Monday she hopes she will see Randy Quaid someday as well.\n\nCommunity service?\n\nThe chief of the Lincoln Volunteer Fire Company said he would welcome Randy Quaid into the company if the actor filed an application and passed a background check and training.\n\n“The opportunity for community service is super,” Chief Dan Ober said in a mid-October interview. “We are in need of people who want to be active and contribute, and being a volunteer on the fire company is a great way to do that.”\n\nOber said he is unsure if Randy Quaid’s criminal background would affect his eligibility, but he encouraged the actor to apply nonetheless.\n\n“I haven’t really thought it through more than just an initial reaction,” Ober said.\n\nA few days after their release, Evi Quaid posted a picture of her husband on Twitter standing in front of the Lincoln Volunteer Fire Company’s station. Randy Quaid crossed his arms in the photo, and he sported a flannel shirt and Middlebury-labeled sweatpants.\n\nOber said the actor’s post-prison actions were a topic of discussion among members of the fire company in the days following his release. Members were initially unsure if Randy Quaid would join the squad or if the actor was speaking off the cuff after hearing a story aired by WCAX-TV on the fire company’s need for new members, Ober said.\n\n“Our guess is he saw the WCAX story and said, ‘Oh, I’m going to move to Lincoln and maybe volunteer,’” Ober said.\n\nAs of Thursday, Randy Quaid had yet to submit an application, Ober said in a follow-up interview. However, the department has received a note that appeared to be signed by Randy Quaid, which expressed his interest in joining. Ober said he cannot be sure about the note's authenticity.\n\nThose joining the fire company must register as full-time residents of Lincoln, Ober added. It was unclear last week if the Quaids intended to be permanent residents.\n\nThose interested in joining the fire company would also be required to submit an application and then attend a meeting at the fire station held on the first Wednesday of each month.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWhile the Quaids have found a safe haven in Vermont, arrest warrants for the two remain active in all other states, the Office of the District Attorney for Santa Barbara County in California said in an Oct. 15 news release.\n\nFranklin County State's Attorney Jim Hughes has said it appears the couple could stay in Vermont and avoid another arrest unless California officials file proper paperwork.\n\nCalifornia prosecutors are in the process of filing a governor’s warrant, which would require Gov. Peter Shumlin to decide the Quaids' fate, Deputy District Attorney Lee Carter Sr. said. If the warrant is approved, the couple would be arrested in Vermont and sent back to Santa Barbara.\n\nThe California prosecutors’ office has said decisions on warrants have historically taken 60 to 90 days. The process had already begun by the time the Quaids were released from prison in Vermont.\n\nAs of Thursday, Shumlin had not received any paperwork from California, office spokesman Scott Coriell said. The governor’s office declined further comment on the Quaids’ decision to remain in the state.\n\nRandy Quaid and his Vermont-based lawyer, Langrock, said the actor wants to resolve the California charges. Langrock is in the process of locating appropriate counsel for the Quaids to use if they return, he said Tuesday.\n\nFollow Elizabeth Murray on Twitter @LizMurraySMC"
