        "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Actor Randy Quaid, who has been plagued by legal troubles in recent years, filmed himself pretending to have sexual intercourse with News Corp chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch to end a two-minute rant about what Quaid sees as a coordinated conspiracy against him.\n\n\"I helped media giants News Corp and Warner Entertainment earn well over [one] billion dollars for the films Independence Day and Christmas Vacation,\" Quaid begins as his wife sits silently in the background wearing only a bikini.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What did I get in return? A Warner Brothers exec Bruce Berman stole my house, and News Corps' The New York Post continues to smear me to high heaven with a pack of lies.\"\n\nQuaid then goes on to accuse gossip outlet TMZ of working with local authorities to have the actor and his wife arrested.\n\n\"For good measure Warner Brothers even had my wife and I falsely arrested six times by TMZ. No, for real, that's really how it works. Hashtag PMC -- 'police media corruption.'\"\n\nQuaid and his wife, Evi, were arrested twice between 2009 and 2010, first for allegedly walking out on a $10,000 hotel bill and then for staying in their former guest house without the current owners permission. The charges against Quaid in regard to the hotel charges were dropped, but Evi pleaded no contest to defrauding an inkeeper and was sentenced to three years probation. A year after the hotel incident, the couple was again arrested, this time for trespassing on their former property. They have been living in exile ever since, and are to be extradited to California to face trial if they ever reenter the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuaid goes on to describe the ordeal as \"a living hell of biblical proportion,\" before warning Murdoch, \"I still have a few tricks too.\" The actor then takes off his sport jacket to reveal what he claims is \"The very same shirt I wore in ID4 when I saved the world -- another act that Rupert Murdoch still hasn't thanked me for\" before Evi steps into the foreground and dons a Rupert Murdoch cutout mask. The Quaids then act out presumably simulated intercourse while Randy yells \"Yeah, Rupert, I'm back,\" extending the \"a\" sound in \"back,\" harkening back to his famous line in Independence Day."
