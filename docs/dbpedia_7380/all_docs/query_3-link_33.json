        "text": "Quaids don’t show\n\nRandy Quaid and his wife Evi didn’t show up again.\n\nThey remain fugitives from a California court after they failed to appear Tuesday for their arraignment on felony vandalism charges for the fourth time.\n\nSanta Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck refused to schedule a new court date for the couple, instead leaving their arrest warrants active. Randy and Evi Quaid have already forfeited more than $1 million in bail for their slew of missed appearances.\n\nRandy Quaid’s attorney, Robert Sanger, told the judge that Canadian authorities had confiscated the actor’s passport. The Quaids are seeking asylum there, claiming they fear a group they’ve dubbed the “Hollywood star-whackers.”\n\n“Mr. Quaid has had multiple occasions to appear on this matter prior to his passport being taken,” Geck said, making an unassailable point.\n\nThe Quaids are accused of causing more than $5,000 in damage to the guesthouse of a home they once owned and were allegedly squatting in when they were arrested in September.\n\nThe Quaids claim the “Hollywood star-whackers” may be responsible for the deaths of actors such as Heath Ledger and David Carradine, and they believe the culprits are targeting them next.\n\nYoung fire assessed\n\nA fire at a San Francisco Bay area warehouse where Neil Young stored memorabilia started in a vintage car the singer had converted into a hybrid vehicle in a much publicized project to promote fuel-efficiency, authorities said.\n\nBelmont-San Carlos Fire Marshal Jim Palisi told the San Mateo County Times on Monday the Nov. 9 fire began in Young’s 1959 Lincoln Continental convertible and spread to the warehouse.\n\nFire crews were able to save about 70 percent of the 10,000-square-foot building’s contents, including other vintage cars, guitars and framed photos belonging to Young. But the car dubbed the Lincvolt was damaged.\n\nYoung had converted the car to run on batteries and a biodiesel-powered generator as part of a project to create the world’s most efficient full-size vehicle.\n\nIn a statement, Young said workers hope the car’s computer will shed light on what caused it to catch fire.\n\nThe fire caused an estimated $850,000 in damage to Young’s possessions and another $250,000 in damage to the building, Palisi said.\n\nDouglas lawsuit dismissed\n\nMichael Douglas‘ ex-wife has lost a bid to cash in on his earnings from his recent “Wall Street” follow-up, with a judge saying her case is too much of a Hollywood divorce to set a sequel in a New York court.\n\nA Manhattan judge dismissed Diandra Douglas‘ lawsuit against the Academy Award-winning actor in a ruling made public Monday. The judge said the dispute doesn’t belong in a New York court because the former couple’s complex, multimillion-dollar divorce agreement was hashed out in Santa Barbara.\n\nMichael Douglas was “very happy” with the New York lawsuit ruling, his lawyer, Marilyn B. Chinitz, said Monday. Diandra Douglas’ lawyer said she plans to appeal. Both Douglases have homes in New York, and “the case should be decided here,” said the lawyer, Nancy Chemtob.\n\nDiandra Douglas’ camp has said she should get half the actor’s earnings from this year’s “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps” because their divorce deal gives her a share of proceeds from projects related to work he did when they were married, such as the original “Wall Street.”\n\nObama for kids\n\nHe’s the leader of the free world, and he’s won a Nobel Peace Prize. But only now, by one measure, is Barack Obama finally truly famous:\n\nHe’s written a children’s book.\n\nWith “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,” a picture book for readers 3 and up that hit bookstores Tuesday, the president joins a long list of politicians who’ve penned children’s books.\n\nObama’s current secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, wrote one – when she was first lady, a book of children’s letters to White House pets. The late Ted Kennedy wrote about Washington as viewed by his dog.\n\nObama, who is donating his proceeds to a scholarship fund for children of disabled and fallen soldiers, isn’t even the only president to pen a children’s book. Theodore Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter wrote books for young people, and John F. Kennedy had a young readers’ edition of his “Profiles in Courage.”\n\nObama actually wrote “Of Thee I Sing” in 2008, after he was elected but before taking office, publishers said in September. It is illustrated by Loren Long, whose many credits include writing and illustrating the children’s stories “Otis” and “Drummer Boy.”\n\nThe book was already selling well Tuesday – it was No. 3 on Amazon.com’s children’s best-seller list, and No. 15 on the site’s overall list."
