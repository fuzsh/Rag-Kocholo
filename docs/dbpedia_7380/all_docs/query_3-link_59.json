        "text": "Publish date: 2024-07-28\n\nIt is now certain that the recall election for California governor will take place this year. While earlier we knew of reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner throwing her hat in this ring, actor Randy Quaid has now said he is 'seriously considering' running for governor of California against Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nJenner made her declaration of candidacy on April 23 and Quaid made his on April 27, Tuesday, saying: \"Iâm seriously considering running for governor. The prosecutorial corruption in California (esp Santa Barbara & the Bell scandal) is rampant and I promise that if elected I will clean up the District Attorney Offices throughout the state.\"\n\nA cursory glance at Quaid's Twitter timeline will tell you that he is a MAGA Republican, but what about his personal life? Here's all you need to know about the actor's relationships.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nDennis Quaid finally reveals the truth behind his shocking breakup with America's sweetheart Meg Ryan\n\nDennis Quaid says Trump is doing a 'good job' tackling coronavirus crisis, praises his daily televised briefings\n\nRandy Quaid's movie career\n\nThe 70-year-old actor was nominated for an Oscar for The Last Detail (1973), won a Golden Globe for his performance as Lyndon Johnson in LBJ: The Early Years (1987), and has appeared in more than 70 other films, including Independence Day (1996) and Brokeback Mountain (2005). He has worked with countless legends of the film industry (Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, Milos Forman, Hal Ashby), meanwhile earning a reputation as a great actor.\n\nHe is probably best known, however, for his over-the-top role as âCousin Eddie,â Chevy Chaseâs schlemiel cousin-in-law in the Vacation comedies, starting with 1983's 'National Lampoon's Vacation'. In recent years, however, he has been known for arrests, lawsuits, deportations and even conspiracy theories which include his claims that he was being targeted by âstar whackers.â He and his second wife Evi are convinced that unnamed nefarious people are singling out celebrities to either steal their fortunes or kill them.\n\nElla Jolly\n\nQuaid was married to Ella Jolly on May 11, 1980. They have a daughter, Amanda Marie, born May 29, 1983. They were separated on September 9, 1986, and divorced on August 24, 1989. Jolly is a former American model. An established woman in her field, she has modeled for some top brands. She isn't very active on social media so there's very little information available about her online.\n\nAfter splitting from Randy, she has been away from social media, mostly. Of their split, Quaid had said in a People interview: \"I went through this delayed adolescent thing. I didn't want to be tied down to a family.\" Their relationship had started breaking down in 1985 following which Quaid set out on a three-year dating spree and eventually found love with Evi Quaid.\n\nEvi Quaid\n\nBorn Evi Motolanez, she is an American film director who left home indefinitely when she was 12 years old. Her Greek grandfather paid for her schooling at five separate boarding schools in New England, all of which she was summarily expelled from for violating school rules such as bedtime curfews, dress codes, and escaping campus boundaries after dark, her IMDb bio reads. In 1999, the Canadian-American film producer and actress wrote and directed her first feature-length film, 'The Debtors'.\n\nQuaid met Evi Motolanez, who became his second wife, in December 1987 on the set of the film 'Bloodhounds of Broadway', in which Madonna starred. After 'Broadway's Bloodhounds' release in October 1989, they wed on October 5, 1989, at the San Ysidro Ranch, a Montecito, California, resort. His brother Dennis, his future sister-in-law Meg Ryan, and his six-year-old daughter Amanda were in attendance.\n\nVanity Fair described Evi as a former Hollywood âIt girlâ who once modeled nude for Helmut Newton and reportedly put up a show in a gallery in LA consisting of giant photographs of her pierced vagina.\n\nFrequent run-ins with the law\n\nIn 2015, the two were arrested and spent time in a Vermont prison before being released after a judge found that there was no probable cause for their detention. Owing to their numerous arrests and court appearances on various charges, the couple has been constantly in the press. They were discovered in Canada in 2010 after missing a court appearance in California on charges of felony vandalism, according to a report by the Sun.\n\nThe Quaids are accused of causing more than $5,000 in damage to a Santa Barbara property they once owned. They also said they were in danger in the United States and applied for asylum under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Randy was denied residency in Canada and had been living there without official paperwork until his arrest in 2013. Canada began a deportation process for Randy. A week prior to his deportation date, they were detained by US Customs officials in Vermont in 2015 after they were spotted entering the state. Evi and Randy were released from jail on October 15, 2015, and were allowed to live in Vermont without facing charges.\n\nncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGjsbp50K6YopxdmK6ttcWoqaehkWK0tsKMsKCvnaNisre1jKqsmqGUYq6zvsSsq2aqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBiv7C5wKeanmWcpMOmedKtpquxXZm2t7vRnJxmnZyhrm62zqWjsg%3D%3D"
