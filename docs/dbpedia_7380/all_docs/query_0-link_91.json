        "text": "I mean, she was just angelic in this! Divine!!! Her face was so pretty, and her style worked well in this film.\n\nI love this movie, about small town Texan teens pretty much sinning with their sexual desires and appetites.\n\nYoung Jeff Bridges was so hot in this. I never knew that was him!!! Very cute.\n\nI love the pool scene when they make Cybill take off her clothes. I couldn’t find the scene in English but YouTube does have it in another language. The guy in that scene is so hot!!!\n\nAnd kudos to Cloris Leachman for getting that young, fresh Cock. She got what every DLer craves.\n\nR18 I have never seen it but I always heard it was stupid and a soap opera.\n\n“The summer of 1984: 32 years after Duane Jackson captained the high school football team and Jacy Farrow was homecoming queen, the small town of Anarene, Texas prepares for its centennial celebration. Oil prices are down, banks are failing, and Duane's $12 million in debt. His wife Karla drinks too much, his children are always in trouble, and he tom-cats around with the wives of friends. Jacy's back in town, after a mildly successful acting career, life in Italy, and the death of her son. People assume Duane and Jacy will resume their high school romance. And Sonny is \"tired in his mind,\" causing worries for his safety. Can these friends find equilibrium in middle age?“\n\nThanks r28!\n\n[quote] [R26], if you like TLPS and its follow-up novels, you may enjoy Larry McMurtry's earlier Texas trilogy, Moving On, All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers, and Terms of Endearment.\n\nThanks for the recommendation r30! I actually read that trilogy about 30 years ago. Strangers was a drag but I enjoyed Moving On (Patsy’s story) and especially Terms which is a great read and very different from the film (although I enjoyed that too).\n\nCybill was perfectly cast as Jacy in this.\n\nMcMurtry dedicated Texasville to her but rumor was he tried to retract the dedication after Cybill married Bruce Oppenheimer- I guess McMurtry still had the hots for her? Anyway, Cybill was awful in Texasville and didn’t have the dramatic skills the character now required (Jacy returns home after losing a child). I had high hopes because she had several dramatic scenes on Moonlighting which she handled quite well. I think she lost her acting ability (again) with the birth of the twins.\n\nA great film with terrific performances from almost everyone. Shepherd is the weakest but is a good fit with the role of flirtatious prettiest girl in town who gets in over her head with the various men/boys in her life. She's surrounded with better actors with more nuanced parts and I think that's why she doesn't bring down the picture. Burstyn, Brennan, and Leachman are all spot-on. Ditto Ben Johnson and the Bottoms brothers. It is a heartbreaking film and much better than the other big coming of age film of the time \"Summer of '42\".\n\nRe: the Brockette dong. It was visible in the full screen (unmatted) VHS version of the film, which is how I first saw it. It's out of frame on all the widescreen DVD versions I've seen, unfortunately.\n\nAgree that Timothy Bottoms was really cute in this.\n\n[quote]Did Cybill screw the Bottoms brothers?\n\nI seem to remember reading that there was a little flirtation going on between Cybill and Tim Bottoms. He gifted her a copy of the book \"Daisy Miller\" that she took to Peter Bogdanovich as a possible follow up movie for her (gee, thanks a LOT, Tim!). Ambitious Cybill of course dumped Tim for the more-powerful producer/director, and Bottoms has been bitter (to put it mildly) towards Peter ever since. He even gave an interview recently in which he claims to have fucked Dorothy Stratten before Peter did."
