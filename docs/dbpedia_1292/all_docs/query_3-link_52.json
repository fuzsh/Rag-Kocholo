        "text": "The following is a guide of things to think about while viewing the film and possible points for class discussion.

Why?\n\n• Did you agree with the main theme/purpose? Why or why not?\n\n• What specifically did you like/dislike? Why?\n\n• Did the director do a good job? Why or why not?\n\nGypsy\n\nGypsy premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Prague on July 5, 2011.\n\nGypsy won three jury prizes at the festival in a country with a long history of marginalizing its Romani population. The movie was filmed in Slovak Romani village and cast local residents in the majority of roles. The film is in Slovak and Romani with English subtitles.\n\nConsider the following for class discussion:\n\n1.\"We'll go to London where they'll think we're Pakistanis, and they'll like us!\"\n\nWhat does this statement tell you about the characters’ sense of life outside their town?\n\n2.Do you believe the ghost of Adam’s father is real? Why or why not?\n\n3.How do the Slovaks treat the Roma?\n\n4.Adam’s uncle tells him “if you want to be a Gypsy, be a Gypsy.” How does Adam respond and what does it mean?\n\n5.Some have called Gypsy a drama of social realism. How does Šulík’s use of nonprofessional local actors emphasize this description?\n\n6.How does the relationship between racism and the quest for land, labor, or resources apply to this film?\n\nGypsy Melody\n\nGypsy Melody was directed by Edmond T. Gréville and released in 1936. It is a little known film that, at one time, was believed to be lost for almost 75 years. It is still difficult to find and the copy that was found is five minutes short its original time. Lupe Vélez, a popular silent film actress, plays Mila. She was Spanish. Known as “The Hot Pepper,” Lupe led an interesting and tragic life and may be worth a Google. Danilo was played by Alfred Rode and all the scores were done by him and his Royal Gypsy Orchestra. However, he was not Roma.\n\n1.Why were the anti-Gypsy laws overturned?\n\n2.What special treatment do the Romani musicians and dancers receive?\n\n3.Why would this film be relevant in 1936?\n\n4.Do you think the orchestra would have been well received in the US?\n\n5.How does Mira react to the luxuries of London?\n\n6.Were Roma and whites treated fairly under the law for the same infractions?\n\nLatcho Drom\n\nLatcho Drom is a classic in the world of Romani films. In Romani, Latcho Drom means “safe journey.” Directed by Tony Gatlif, a Romani film director, the film made its appearance at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. The film takes place in India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Auschwitz, and Spain and tells the long story of Romani history. The majority of the cast are Roma and much of the music features the world famous Gypsy band Taraf de Haïdouks.\n\n1.It is said the music in Latcho Drom is so powerful that subtitles are not needed. Do you agree?\n\n2.Who is the blackbird in the old woman’s song?\n\n3.Who would you say is the central character of the film?\n\n4.At what point, geographically, does the mood of the film change? Why?\n\n5.Put a theme to each country the Romani caravan visits.\n\n6.In which genre would you place this film? Why?\n\nMy Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\n\nGypsy Wedding was first produced in the UK by Channel 4 and came under intense criticism from the Roma community. The US has now picked up a version entitled My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding that runs on The Learning Channel. The UK version was created by Jenny Popplewell, who claims to be “showing it as it is.” Popplewell is not Romani. My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding centers around Travelers in the UK. Consider the implications of applying the Gypsy ethnicity to a lifestyle.\n\n1.Why are these shows so popular in the UK and the US?\n\n2.Given what you have learned of Romani culture, what do you think about Gypsy Wedding’s sexualization of children?\n\n3.Why would Roma participate in these productions?\n\nKorkoro\n\nKorkoro is another Tony Gatlif film released in 2009. There are several Roma in the film. The lovable Taloche is played by James Thiérrée, Charlie Chaplin’s grandson. The film won several awards and was praised for its exposure of the Vichy government’s treatment of Roma.\n\n1.Korkoro means “freedom.” How is this a theme in the film?\n\n2.How does the family react to their new house?\n\n3.Gatlif makes a point of the characters’ feeling that the war is not their war. Why is this relevant and at what points in the film does that theme emerge?\n\n4.What is the significance of the watch Taloche finds on the railroad tracks?\n\n5.How would you compare the narrative of this film with that of Latcho Drom?\n\n6.How do you feel about the ending of the film? Does it give indications of what happened next?\n\nAnd the Violins Stopped Playing\n\nAnd the Violins Stopped Playing was based on the novel by Alexander Ramati, who also directed the film. It was produced in Poland and released in 1988. It is based on a true story.\n\n1.How would you compare And the Violins Stopped Playing with Korkoro, the only feature films of the Porrajmos? Think about the different cultures of the directors, how the films ended, the purpose of musical scores, etc.\n\n2.Are there points of social liminality in the film?\n\n3.How are the Nazis portrayed, especially Dr. Mengele?\n\n4.Why is Mirga responsible for keeping count of the caravans and people?\n\n5.What is the significance of the title of this film?\n\n6.What reason does the film give for the murder of Auschwitz’s Roma?\n\nBorat\n\nBorat was directed by Larry Charles and produced by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who also played Borat. Released in 2006 by 20th Century Fox, the film has been the subject of much controversy, not only regarding its “humorous” anti-Americanism and racism, but the deception used to solicit Romani participation. Borat won several awards and was a top grossing hit at the box office. The European Center for Antiziganism Research filed complaints and lawsuits in Germany. Though lawsuits are still pending the complaints did force Germany to remove all references to Roma in trailers.\n\n1.Consider the following quote. How do you think those who know only Romani stereotypes understand the quote.\n\nBorat: If this car drive into a group of gypsies, will there be any damage to the car?\n\nCar Dealership Owner: It depends on how hard you hit them and all that.\n\nBorat: Hard.\n\nCar Dealership Owner: You might ― if somebody rolls on the windshield, they could crack your windshield.\n\nBorat: How fast do I need to go to guarantee I kill them?\n\nCar Dealership Owner: Uh ― let me tell you something with this vehicle here probably doing 35-45 miles per hour will do it.\n\n2.Some say Borat was comic genius, others that it was offensive and obscene. For the Roma in Glod, Romania, the film was a “humiliation and affront.” Do you think it is possible for minorities to not relate to the comedic irony in Borat?\n\n3.Cohen explained that the purpose of the film was to let people expose their own prejudices. Do you think this is a positive thing? Why or why not?\n\n4.Does Borat send a message? What is its purpose? Did it succeed?\n\n5.Does the fact that Cohen is Jewish have any impact on how you view the anti-Semitism in the film?\n\n6.In order for Cohen to make his point, was it necessary to include the Roma?\n\nWhat Magdalena Said and I have Dreamt of Working as a Hairdresser\n\nWhat Magdalena Said is a documentary directed by Michael Stewart, a well known contributor to the field of Romani Studies. It was produced by BBC in 1994.\n\n1.How did the Czechs respond to Magdalena’s ambition statement?\n\n2.What were the consequences for Magdalena?\n\n3.What does Magdalena’s goal tell you about the power of public prosecutors?\n\n4.Why do you believe the Roma have such a strong communist nostalgia?\n\n5.What type of looks do the passersby give to the Roma on the streets in Hairdresser?\n\n6.Does it surprise you how openly racist the Europeans are? That they do not hesitate to express their contempt for the Roma in front of the cameras?\n\nThinner (entire), Drag Me to Hell (clips), and American Gypsy (clips)\n\nThinner is an American film based on the novel by Stephen King (who, incidentally plays the pharmacist in the beginning of the film) and directed by Tom Holland. The film was a complete failure both in critical reception and financially. Drag Me to Hell was directed by Sam Rami and released by Ghost House Pictures in 2009 at the Cannes Film Festival. It was a huge success at the box office and won three horror awards. National Geographic carries American Gypsies, which just began showing this year and is produced by Ralph Macchio.\n\n1.Think about the way gender and age are represented, especially among women.\n\n2.What are the stereotypes portrayed in the film and how would you dispel them?\n\n3.How is the comment about Gina lifting her skirt an affront to Romani custom?\n\n4.What type of roles do Roma typically have in horror films?\n\n5.Why do think negative reviews rarely mention the representation of Roma?\n\n6.How do Thinner and the clips sum up the American perception of Roma?\n\n7.Consider how television shows similar to these but with different ethnicities would be received.\n\n8.Dr. Hancock’s letter to National Geographic was written before the show aired. Now that you have seen it, do you think his letter is valid?\n\nI am Roma Woman Media Campaigns\n\nThe “I am Roma Woman” campaign launched in 2011 in response to rising ethnic tensions and anti-Roma violence across Europe. Produced by the Romedia Foundation in Budapest, the videos are on YouTube and French MSN.\n\n1.Did you learn anything new from the media campaigns?\n\n2.Who do you think the target audience for the campaigns is?\n\n3.Do the brief stories of these women shock you?\n\n4.These campaigns are not presented as PSA’s on mainstream television. Why do you think this is?\n\n5.What are some of the differences in presentation in the campaigns and the films we viewed?"
