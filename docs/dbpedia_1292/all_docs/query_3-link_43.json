For October, the Channel will feature films from Wayne Wang, Arthur Dong, Doris Wishman, and more!\n\nBelow you’ll find the programming schedule for the month, along with a complete list of titles that Criterion has in store for us.

Featuring pioneering special effects and makeup, atmospheric mise-en-scène influenced by German expressionism, and stars like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, these unforgettable nightmares—including the longer (and racier) Spanish-language version of the original 1931 Dracula and James Whale’s protocamp masterpiece Bride of Frankenstein—have left an enduring mark upon our collective cultural imagination.\n\nDracula (Spanish-Language Version), George Melford, 1931\n\nThe Mummy, Karl Freund, 1932\n\nThe Invisible Man, James Whale, 1933\n\nThe Black Cat, Edgar G. Ulmer, 1934\n\nBride of Frankenstein, James Whale, 1935\n\nThe Raven, Lew Landers, 1935\n\nThe Wolf Man, George Waggner, 1941\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon, Jack Arnold, 1954\n\nHome Invasion\n\nHome is where the terror is in these unsettling explorations of one of our most primal fears: an unwanted intrusion into the sanctity of one’s own home. It’s a disquieting premise that has inspired filmmakers for decades, as seen in these gripping noir classics (The Desperate Hours, In Cold Blood), paranoid explorations of surveillance and technology (The Anderson Tapes, Demon Seed), boundary-pushing art-house provocations (Violence at Noon, Funny Games), and shockingly visceral horror nightmares (Angst, Inside). Ranging from darkly comic to nerve-shreddingly intense, these films are profoundly disturbing because they suggest that nowhere, not even your own home, is truly safe.\n\nBlind Alley, Charles Vidor, 1939\n\nThe Desperate Hours, William Wyler, 1955\n\nPrivate Property, Leslie Stevens, 1960\n\nViridiana, Luis Buñuel, 1961\n\nCape Fear, J.

Embodying the cynical flip side of the postwar era, the vigorous, chin-dimpled actor rose to fame playing tightly wound, often defiantly unlikeable characters: a backstabbing boxer in the hard-hitting noir Champion, an unscrupulous reporter in Billy Wilder’s venomous media exposé Ace in the Hole, and a ruthless Hollywood producer in Vincente Minnelli’s Tinseltown melodrama The Bad and the Beautiful. Cementing his tough-guy image with the numerous westerns (including Lonely Are the Brave) he made throughout the 1960s and ’70s, Douglas harnessed a bold and expressive performance style to become one of American cinema’s most indelible stars.\n\nThe Strange Love of Martha Ivers, Lewis Milestone, 1946\n\nOut of the Past, Jacques Tourneur, 1947\n\nI Walk Alone, Byron Haskin, 1947\n\nChampion, Mark Robson, 1949\n\nA Letter to Three Wives, Joseph L.

Mankiewicz, 1970\n\nPosse, Kirk Douglas, 1975\n\nA Father … A Son … Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Lee Grant, 2005\n\n*Available November 1\n\nAdventures in Moviegoing with Edgar Wright\n\nBritish director Edgar Wright, the avid genre remixer behind Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Baby Driver, and Last Night in Soho, sits down with critic Alicia Malone to discuss his early moviegoing memories (including sneaking into Gremlins as a child), his abiding love for popular genres, and what he looks for in a good horror movie. The films he has chosen to present reflect his omnivorous embrace of art house and grindhouse alike, with the British teen exploitation shocker Beat Girl and Mario Bava’s hyperstylish giallo classic Blood and Black Lace rubbing shoulders with masterpieces by Max Ophuls, Ingmar Bergman, and Luis Buñuel.\n\nBlack Narcissus, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1947\n\nThe Earrings of Madame de … , Max Ophuls, 1953\n\nSapphire, Basil Dearden, 1959\n\nBeat Girl, Edmond T.

Real-life murderers, mobsters, and swindlers have provided models for popular horror, disquieting psychological realism, and avant-garde experiments alike. Inspired by some of the most infamous cases of all time—including the Papin sisters (Les abysses, La cérémonie), John Dillinger (Dillinger), Jack the Ripper (From Hell), and the Zodiac Killer (Zodiac)—these ripped-from-the-headlines tales of notorious killers and outlaws prove that truth is often stranger, and more shocking, than fiction.\n\nFeatures\n\nM, Fritz Lang, 1931\n\nArsenic and Old Lace, Frank Capra, 1944\n\nTry and Get Me!, Cy Endfield, 1950\n\nSalvatore Giuliano, Francesco Rosi, 1962\n\nLes abysses, Nikos Papatakis, 1963\n\nIn Cold Blood, Richard Brooks, 1967\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, George Roy Hill, 1969\n\nThe Honeymoon Killers, Leonard Kastle, 1970\n\n10 Rillington Place, Richard Fleischer, 1971\n\nThe Valachi Papers, Terence Young, 1972\n\nDillinger, John Milius, 1973\n\nThe Day of the Jackal, Fred Zinnemann, 1973\n\nMan on a Swing, Frank Perry, 1974\n\nIn the Realm of the Senses, Nagisa Oshima, 1976\n\nVengeance Is Mine, Shohei Imamura, 1979\n\nSmooth Talk, Joyce Chopra, 1985\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, John McNaughton, 1986\n\nLandscape Suicide, James Benning, 1987\n\nReversal of Fortune, Barbet Schroeder, 1990\n\nA Brighter Summer Day, Edward Yang, 1991\n\nLet Him Have It, Peter Medak, 1991\n\nSwoon, Tom Kalin, 1992\n\nTo Die For, Gus Van Sant, 1995\n\nLa cérémonie, Claude Chabrol, 1995\n\nDeep Crimson, Arturo Ripstein, 1996\n\nFrom Hell, Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, 2001\n\nZodiac, David Fincher, 2007\n\nGomorrah, Matteo Garrone, 2008\n\nPolytechnique, Denis Villeneuve, 2009\n\nShorts\n\nFry Day, Laura Moss, 2017\n\nBlood Kin, Ramin Bahrani, 2018\n\nStrangers in Paradise: 9 Films by Jim Jarmusch\n\nDryly deadpan, stylishly minimalist, and effortlessly cool, the films of American indie pioneer Jim Jarmusch are so idiosyncratic that they practically constitute a genre unto themselves. Forging his singular sensibility amid the creative ferment of New York’s downtown scene, Jarmusch emerged as one of the most original voices of the 1980s independent-film boom with his breakout road movie Stranger Than Paradise, which established his fascination with outsiders on enigmatic journeys to nowhere in particular. Drawing on cultural heroes from Howlin’ Wolf and Elvis Presley to William Blake and Jean-Pierre Melville, Jarmusch has transformed a variety of genres—revisionist western (Dead Man), modern samurai movie (Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai), vampire love story (Only Lovers Left Alive)—into fresh and surprising vehicles for his inimitable brand of haiku-like existential poetry.\n\nPermanent Vacation, 1980\n\nStranger Than Paradise, 1984\n\nDown by Law, 1986\n\nMystery Train, 1989\n\nNight on Earth, 1991\n\nDead Man, 1995\n\nGhost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, 1999\n\nCoffee and Cigarettes, 2003\n\nOnly Lovers Left Alive, 2013\n\nIndecent Desires: Six Films by Doris Wishman\n\n“When I die, I’ll make films in hell!” declared exploitation auteur Doris Wishman. Though she may have been the most prolific woman director in the history of American cinema, Wishman has long been overlooked because she worked in the critically disreputable realm of roughies, nudie cuties, and pornography. Nevertheless, her extensive and fascinating body of work is ripe for rediscovery for its singularity of vision (Wishman not only produced and directed but wrote, cast, and edited most of her films), subversive feminist themes, and unique place within the context of experimental and DIY cinema. Provocative, erotic, and often bordering on the surreal, these films from Wishman’s rich 1960s and ’70s period—including the twisted fantasy Indecent Desires and Let Me Die a Woman, an unclassifiable quasi-docmentary about transgender people—are an introduction an innovative director whose work seems to exist in its own wild and wondrously warped parallel universe.\n\nNude on the Moon, 1961\n\nBad Girls Go to Hell, 1965\n\nIndecent Desires, 1968\n\nDeadly Weapons, 1974\n\nDouble Agent 73, 1974\n\nLet Me Die a Woman, 1977\n\nEXCLUSIVE STREAMING PREMIERES\n\nWednesday, October 13\n\nFilm About a Father Who\n\nFeaturing seven short films and a new introduction by the filmmaker\n\nOver a period of thirty-five years between 1984 and 2019, filmmaker Lynne Sachs shot 8 and 16 mm film, videotape, and digital images of her father, Ira Sachs Sr., a bon vivant and pioneering businessman from Park City, Utah. Film About a Father Who is her attempt to understand the web that connects a child to her parent and a sister to her siblings. Like a cubist rendering of a face, Sachs’s cinematic exploration of her father offers multiple, sometimes contradictory, views of a seemingly unknowable man who is publicly the uninhibited center of the frame yet privately shrouded in mystery. With this meditation on fatherhood and masculinity, Sachs allows herself and her audience to see beneath the surface of the skin, beyond the projected reality. As the startling facts mount, she discovers more about her father than she had ever hoped to reveal.\n\nThis exclusive streaming premiere is accompanied by a selection of experimental short films by Sachs, many of which also reflect her probing exploration of family relationships.\n\nWhich Way Is East, 1994\n\nThe Last Happy Day, 2009\n\nWind in Our Hair, 2010\n\nThe Washing Society, 2018\n\nGirl Is Presence, 2020\n\nE•pis•to•lar•y: Letter to Jean Vigo, 2021\n\nMaya at 24, 2021\n\nCRITERION EDITIONS\n\nPremiering October 1\n\nIsland of Lost Souls: Criterion Collection Edition #586\n\nCharles Laughton and Bela Lugosi star in this mad-science shocker, a twisted treasure from Hollywood’s pre-Code horror heyday based on the novel by H. G. Wells.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Audio commentary featuring film historian Gregory Mank; a conversation between filmmaker John Landis, makeup artist Rick Baker, and genre expert Bob Burns; and more.\n\nAfter Life: Criterion Collection Edition #1089\n\nIf you could choose only one memory to hold on to for eternity, what would it be? Hirokazu Kore-eda’s revelatory international breakthrough is a quietly profound meditation on memory, mortality, and the power of cinema.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Audio commentary featuring film scholar Linda C. Ehrlich, interviews with Kore-eda and cinematographers Masayoshi Sukita and Yutaka Yamazaki, and more.\n\nKagemusha: Criterion Collection Edition #267\n\nIn his sumptuous late masterpiece, Akira Kurosawa returns to the samurai film and to a primary theme of his career—the play between illusion and reality.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Audio commentary by scholar Stephen Prince, appreciations by George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, and more.\n\nWhen We Were Kings: Criterion Collection Edition #998\n\nThis essential documentary portrait of Muhammad Ali captures the boxing legend’s charm, grace, and defiance as he trains in Kinshasa for one of his most consequential fights: the Rumble in the Jungle, which pitted him against the younger powerhouse George Foreman.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Interviews with director Leon Gast and producer David Sonenberg.\n\nA Raisin in the Sun: Criterion Collection Edition #945\n\nThe original stars of Lorraine Hansberry’s immortal play A Raisin in the Sun—including Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee—reprise their roles on-scren in this deeply resonant tale of dreams deferred.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Interviews with Hansberry, director Daniel Petrie, and scholars Imani Perry and Mia Mask; an excerpt from the documentary Black Theatre: The Making of a Movement; and more.\n\nCRITERION ORIGINALS\n\nFriday, October 22\n\nQueersighted: Class Acts\n\nIn this latest edition of Queersighted—an ongoing series that takes a look at film history through a distinctly queer lens—curator Michael Koresky and special guest Caden Mark Gardner present a selection of films that explore how queer identity intersects with social class. With their keen observations about how sexuality is expressed, hidden, and wielded on a terrain of social inequality, these stories—drawn from the outskirts of New York City, working-class South East London, the backstreets of Seattle and Memphis, the margins of Frankfurt and Brussels—foreground class identity and stratification as much as they engage in matters of queer identification.\n\nJe tu il elle, Chantal Akerman, 1974\n\nIn a Year of 13 Moons, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1978\n\nCome Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, Robert Altman, 1982\n\nStreetwise, Martin Bell, 1984\n\nThe Salt Mines, Susana Aikin, 1990\n\nThe Transformation, Carlos Aparicio and Susana Aikin, 1995\n\nBeautiful Thing, Hettie MacDonald, 1996\n\nThe Delta, Ira Sachs, 1996\n\nBrother to Brother, Rodney Evans, 2004\n\nThursday, October 28\n\nObservations on Film Art No. 44: Aspect Ratio in Vivre sa vie\n\nOne of the peaks of Jean-Luc Godard’s extraordinary 1960s creative run, Vivre sa vie finds the filmmaker combining brilliant visual design with a tragic character study of a young woman (Anna Karina) on a downward spiral. In this edition of Observations on Film Art, Professor David Bordwell examines Godard’s bold choice to shoot the film in the boxy, 4:3 aspect ratio that was then quickly becoming outmoded in favor of widescreen. Pushing aesthetic boundaries as always, Godard uses the format’s tight framing to maintain a rigorous, almost obsessive focus on his central character, resulting in a work of true cinematic portraiture.\n\nWOMEN FILMMAKERS\n\nWednesday, October 6\n\nJennifer’s Body\n\nThis sleeper cult classic from director Karyn Kusama and screenwriter Diablo Cody infuses the teen horror movie with a dark wit and a subversive feminist sting.\n\nWednesday, October 27\n\nOffice Killer\n\nCelebrated photographer Cindy Sherman toys knowingly with slasher-movie conventions in her fascinating, darkly comic sole foray into feature filmmaking.\n\nMore women filmmakers featured in this month’s programming:\n\nIndecent Desires: Six Films by Doris Wishman\n\nSmooth Talk, Joyce Chopra, 1985\n\nThe Salt Mines, Susana Aikin, 1990\n\nThe Transformation, Carlos Aparicio and Susana Aikin, 1995\n\nBeautiful Thing, Hettie MacDonald, 1996\n\nIn the Cut, Jane Campion, 2003\n\nA Father … A Son … Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Lee Grant, 2005\n\nFry Day, Laura Moss, 2017\n\nToo Late to Die Young, Dominga Sotomayor, 2018\n\nStuffed, Erin Derham, 2019\n\nWhite Echo, Chloë Sevigny, 2019\n\nBetween You and Milagros, Mariana Saffon, 2020\n\nFilm About a Father Who, Lynne Sachs, 2020\n\nTRUE STORIES\n\nMonday, October 4\n\nStories of Resistance: Documentaries by Arthur Dong\n\nOver the course of a career that spans five decades, Oscar-nominated activist documentarian Arthur Dong has established himself as one of American independent cinema’s most daring pioneers, bringing powerful untold stories that center queer and Asian American experiences to the screen. Whether exploring the devastating effects of antigay prejudice (Coming Out Under Fire, Licensed to Kill), the complexity and vitality of Asian American culture (Forbidden City, USA; Hollywood Chinese), or the extraordinary life of a survivor of the Cambodian genocide (The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor), Dong approaches each project with a rare rigor and a quietly forceful empathy, braiding personal, historical, and political strands into compelling narratives. Taken together, his body of work serves as a stirring testament to the power of individual resistance and resilience in the face of social oppression.\n\nSewing Woman, 1982\n\nForbidden City, USA, 1989\n\nComing Out Under Fire, 1994\n\nLicensed To Kill, 1997\n\nFamily Fundamentals, 2002\n\nHollywood Chinese, 2007\n\nThe Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S.

This tribute gathers three of her finest performances: her standout turn as a daughter defying her dying father’s wishes in the screen adaptation of Carson McCullers’s southern gothic classic The Heart is a Lonely Hunter; award-winning portrayal of a woman whose life spans the era of slavery and the civil rights movement in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman; and heartwarming collaboration with Richard Pryor in the sweetly irreverent comedy Bustin’ Loose.\n\nThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Robert Ellis Miller, 1968\n\nThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, John Korty, 1974\n\nBustin’ Loose, Oz Scott, 1981\n\nThursday, October 14\n\nChinatown Chronicles: Three Films by Wayne Wang\n\nFeaturing a new conversation between Wang and critic Dennis Lim\n\nWith his 1982 indie breakthrough Chan Is Missing—a noir-inflected comic mystery set in San Francisco’s Chinatown—Wayne Wang became the first Asian American director to achieve widespread critical recognition, paving the way for a pioneering and eclectic career that helped introduce Chinese American stories to mainstream cinema. Exploring issues of assimilation, identity, and generational conflict, this trio of playful, insightful films from Wang’s extraordinary 1980s output overflow with both tender humor and deep emotion, drawing on influences ranging from the French New Wave and Yasujiro Ozu to old-fashioned Hollywood musicals and romantic comedies in order to capture a wide variety of immigrant experiences.\n\nChan Is Missing, 1982\n\nDim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart, 1985\n\nEat a Bowl of Tea, 1989\n\nThursday, October 21\n\nThree Scored by Curtis Mayfield\n\nFeaturing a new introduction by critic Greg Tate\n\nA prolific singer-songwriter who fused an innovative soul sound with a social consciousness that spoke to Black American struggle and empowerment, Curtis Mayfield also left his unmistakable stamp on a small but memorable handful of films as a composer. In addition to the Blaxploitation classic Super Fly, which features some of the artist’s grooviest songs (including the hit “Freddie’s Dead”), this Mayfield sampler includes the beloved, Supremes-inspired backstage musical Sparkle and the gritty prison drama Short Eyes, based on the groundbreaking play by Nuyorican writer Miguel Piñero (and featuring Mayfield in a supporting role).\n\nSuper Fly, Gordon Parks Jr., 1972\n\nSparkle, Sam O’Steen, 1976\n\nShort Eyes, Robert M. Young, 1977\n\nCLASSIC HOLLYWOOD\n\nFriday, October 1\n\nLubitsch Musicals\n\nRenowned as a silent-film pioneer and the man who refined Hollywood comedy with such masterpieces as Trouble in Paradise, The Shop Around the Corner, and To Be or Not to Be, Ernst Lubitsch also had another claim to fame: he helped invent the modern movie musical. With the advent of sound and audiences clamoring for “talkies,” Lubitsch combined his love of European operettas and his mastery of film to create this entirely new genre. These elegant, bawdy films, made before strict enforcement of the Hays morality code, feature some of the greatest stars of early Hollywood (Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Claudette Colbert, Miriam Hopkins), as well as that elusive style of comedy that would thereafter be known as “the Lubitsch touch.”\n\nThe Love Parade, 1929\n\nMonte Carlo, 1930\n\nThe Smiling Lieutenant, 1931\n\nOne Hour with You, 1932\n\nSATURDAY MATINEES\n\nSaturday, October 2\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon\n\nThe amphibious terror known as the Gill-man was launched into pop-culture immortality by this 1950s creature-feature classic.\n\nSaturday, October 9\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nSpecial-effects wunderkind and genre master Byron Haskin won a place in the hearts of fantasy-film lovers everywhere with this gorgeously designed journey into the unknown.\n\nSaturday, October 16\n\nMiss Minoes\n\nThis charmingly original Dutch family favorite is catnip for all friends of felines.\n\nSaturday, October 23\n\nWombling Free\n\nThe furry, potbellied, litter-collecting creatures known as the Wombles made their big-screen debut in this lightly psychedelic cinematic spin-off.\n\nSaturday, October 30\n\nThe Time of Their Lives\n\nComedy greats Abbott and Costello plus prankster ghosts make for a rib-tickling fantasy farce.\n\nSHORT-FILM PROGRAMS\n\nTuesday, October 5\n\nLucid Dreams\n\nPlease Speak Continuously and Describe Your Experiences as They Come to You and Paprika\n\nTwo prodigiously inventive filmmakers imagine what happens when the barrier between dreams and reality breaks down in these sci-fi head trips.\n\nTuesday, October 12\n\nThe Present Past\n\nBlessed Land and The Naked Island\n\nHistory intertwines with the present day in these haunting and hypnotic evocations of worlds seemingly unstuck in time.\n\nTuesday, October 19\n\nEndings and Awakenings\n\nBetween You and Milagros and Too Late to Die Young\n\nThe age of innocence comes to an end for two young women in a pair of visually sublime, South American–set teenage reveries.\n\nTuesday, October 26\n\nPsychic Connection\n\nWhite Echo and Séance on a Wet Afternoon\n\nGrab a ouija board, light a candle, and settle in for two spine-tingling exercises in the occult arts.\n\nDOUBLE FEATURES\n\nFriday, October 1\n\nIn a New York Minute\n\nThe Clock and After Hours\n\nA pair of Manhattan meet-cutes set off all-night odysseys across the city that never sleeps in Vincente Minnelli’s magical romance and Martin Scorsese’s black-comic urban nightmare.\n\nFriday, October 8\n\nWomen on the Verge\n\nDiary of a Mad Housewife and A Woman Under the Influence\n\nCarrie Snodgress and Gena Rowlands deliver unforgettable, Oscar-nominated performances as frustrated 1970s housewives unraveling under the crushing pressures of domesticity.\n\nFriday, October 15\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa’s Existential Dread\n\nBright Future and Creepy\n\nA surreally apocalyptic tale of alienated youth and a shocking murder mystery show off the chilling vision of Japan’s master of the metaphysical thriller, Kiyoshi Kurosawa.\n\nFriday, October 22\n\nSleeping with Danger\n\nKlute and In the Cut\n\nJane Fonda and Meg Ryan deliver two of their finest performances as women drawn into the hunt for a killer in a paranoid classic and a fascinatingly subversive, unsung feminist thriller.\n\nFriday, October 29\n\nBlood Feasts\n\nVampyr and Only Lovers Left Alive\n\nDanish master Carl Theodor Dreyer’s experimental horror milestone inspires indie existentialist Jim Jarmusch’s equally idiosyncratic take on the vampire genre.\n\nComplete list of films premiering on the Criterion Channel this month:\n\n10 Rillington Place, Richard Fleischer, 1971\n\nAfter Life, Hirokazu Kore-eda, 1998\n\nAngst, Gerald Kargl, 1983\n\nArsenic and Old Lace, Frank Capra, 1944 *\n\nThe Bad and the Beautiful, Vincente Minnelli, 1952\n\nBad Influence, Curtis Hanson, 1990\n\nBeat Girl, Edmond T.
