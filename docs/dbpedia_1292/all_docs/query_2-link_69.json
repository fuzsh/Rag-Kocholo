In doing so, it exploits adolescent sexuality, rock ‘n’ roll, middle-class slumming, prostitutes, strippers and sly intimations of lesbianism and incest, gleefully presenting London’s Soho as an island of thrilling perversity in a repressed England.\n\nThe B-movie masterpiece stars the lovely Gillian Hills – also seen in Blow Up (1966) – as Jennifer, a rebellious teenager who is jealous of her gorgeous new French stepmother, Nichole (Noelle Adam), who is only eight years her senior.\n\nWhen Nichole shows up at the Off-Beat Cafe (Jennifer’s favourite beatnik hangout), the young girl is embarrassed by all the attention friends like musician Dave (Adam Faith) shower upon the stepmother.\n\nAs Nichole leaves, a stripper from the nearby Les Girls Club seems to recognise her, allowing Jennifer to expose Nichole’s past to her respected father, Paul Linden (David Farrar).\n\nJennifer is curious about the Les Girls strip joint, so one evening sneaks in to question Nichole’s former stripper friend, Greta.\n\nThe suavely sinister strip club owner, Kenny (Christopher Lee), tries to seduce Jennifer, but this vexes his jealous former lover.\n\nVeteran Frenchman Edmond T Greville directs this low-budget curio which has dated terribly but is fascinating today partly for the excruciating cool jive talk and the sheer lascivious of its content.\n\nAdam Faith (in his first film appearance) and the John Barry Seven sing five forgettable songs, including the title tune.\n\nThe film – rated “X” on its British release – was screened in the USA as Wild For Kicks.\n\nPaul Linden\n\nDavid Farrar\n\nNichole\n\nNoelle Adam\n\nKenny\n\nChristopher Lee\n\nJennifer\n\nGillian Hills\n\nDave\n\nAdam Faith\n\nDodo\n\nShirley Anne Field\n\nHoney\n\nClaire Gordon\n\nPlaid Shirt\n\nOliver Reed"
