        "text": "As of today, the most enchanting ''new'' film in town is ''Princess Tam Tam,'' at Film Forum 2.\n\nThis is the 1935 French comedy starring Josephine Baker, the St. Louis-born dancer who, in the mid-1920's, became one of France's greatest cabaret stars. When she died in 1975 after suffering a stroke, Miss Baker was just four days into the run of a new Paris revue celebrating her 50 years as an entertainer. Her funeral service was held in the Church of the Madeleine.\n\nMovies were only an occasional diversion for Miss Baker, who, as a black performer, was far more highly regarded abroad than she was at home, at least until near the end of her career. She was a stunning-looking woman who wasn't conventionally beautiful. Her face was too round and the chin too small for her to succeed simply as an exotic femme fatale.\n\nNevertheless, she managed to parlay her considerable assets as a dancer, singer and comedienne into a remarkable career. Her flamboyant personality was best expressed in her cabaret appearances in which, when she started out, she wore as little as the law allowed, mostly bananas or feathers.\n\nIt's the achievement of ''Princess Tam Tam'' to catch and preserve -within a conventional film - something of the star's singular grace, energy and frequently self-mocking humor. The film, which is being shown here in a fine new print, is double-billed with Miss Baker's 1934 vehicle, ''Zouzou.''\n\nIn ''Princess Tam Tam,'' Miss Baker, as Alwina, a saucy Bedouin beggar, catches the eye of Max, a blocked French novelist who has come to Tunis to live among ''the savages'' and find inspiration for a new book. The charmed Max decides to write a novel about Alwina, in which he acts as Pygmalion to her Galatea.\n\nHaving taught Alwina how to walk, speak and dress like a lady, Max accompanies her to Paris, where he introduces her as ''Princess Tam Tam from India.'' His principal purpose is to make his wife jealous, but Alwina, with her couture wardrobe and ingenuous manners, becomes the toast of Paris.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
