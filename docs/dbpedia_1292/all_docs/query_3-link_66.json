        "text": "23 – Trottie True (Brian Desmond Hurst, 1949) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nThis Jean Kent vehicle - her favourite of her own pictures - is a pretty charming romp through the music halls and high society of early 20th century London. Kent plays the stage star-turned-Duchess who has an on-off relationship with a balloonist, and she's excellent, playing her role with an infectious, saucy sense of fun. She's very entertaining when performing her songs too, although the musical aspect of the film feels a bit half-baked. The supporting cast features Bill Owen, Hattie Jacques, Lana Morris and James Donald, as well as brief appearances from a young Christopher Lee and Roger Moore. Kent aside, the main reason to see the film is Harry Waxman's lush Technicolor photography, and the vibrant production and costume design.\n\n22 – Beat Girl (Edmond T. Gréville, 1960) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nThis portrait of delinquent youth is a real time capsule, full of London teenagers spouting beatnik slang. \"You'll really flip your lid.\" \"That's straight from the fridge.\" \"Daddy-o! I'm over and out.\" Poor old David Farrar looks completely exasperated throughout, reacting with bafflement when he is called a \"square\": \"This language! These words! What do they MEAN!\" Gillian Hills is enjoyably cocky and contemptuous as the tearaway teen who wants to expose her stepmother's past and ends up almost being groomed by Christopher Lee. It was amusing to see Oliver Reed goofing about in the background as one of the youths. Beat Girl is rather stiff and unconvincing, and I wish it showed us more of 60s Soho rather than so many studio interiors, but it's an entertaining picture, and John Barry's first film score is really swinging, daddy-o.\n\n21 – Night Drum (Tadashi Imai, 1958) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nThis is a fascinating film about a samurai who returns home to face rumours about his wife's infidelity. The truth of what happened between Tane and the travelling drum teacher is gradually pieced together through flashbacks, but that truth is muddied by a series of unreliable narrators. Imai's direction is understated and his pacing is measured, and it took me a while to get involved in this film, which occasionally feels a little stiff despite the excellent, nuanced performances by Rentarō Mikuni and Ineko Arima. I was often more intrigued by the film's sense of period detail and the way it depicts the customs, class distinctions and economic realities of samurai life. But in the final third of the film things suddenly snap into focus, and Imai stages some remarkable scenes as he builds to a tragic, powerful ending.\n\n20 – Dead Ringer (Paul Henreid, 1964) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nAs I watched Dead Ringer, I had the nagging feeling that I’d seen it before – it was only afterwards that I realised it was a remake of the excellent 1946 Mexican film La Otra, starring Dolores del Río. I can't resist any film involving twins or doppelgängers, and the scenes with Bette Davis playing against herself as both the poor sister Edith and rich sister Margaret are seamlessly done and loads of fun to watch. We only really get two scenes of them interacting before Edith has killed Margaret and assumed her identity, and the rest of the film is about her attempts to get away with it. Davis' former co-star Paul Henreid does a neat job behind the camera, Karl Malden plays another empathetic cop, and Peter Lawford suffers a particularly satisfying gruesome death. Strangely, the print we saw bore the alternative title Dead Image, which is an absolutely terrible title in comparison.\n\n19 – You Were Like a Wild Chrysanthemum (Keisuke Kinoshita, 1955) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nThis poetic memory piece begins with an old man (played by the great Chishū Ryū) heading back to his home town, and reminiscing about a teenage love affair that was thwarted by local gossips and interfering family members. The first flashback scene has a blurry iris around the edge of the frame, as if we're viewing this through the haze of the old man's memory, and I thought that effect would diminish as we got into the main narrative, but to my surprise the whole film looks like that. It's an interesting choice and I'm not sure how much the effect really adds to the film, especially as the images captured by Hiroshi Kusuda's camera are so ravishing I didn't want any part of the frame to be obscured. This is an astonishingly beautiful film. Kinoshita's composition is exquisite, and the use of light is breathtaking - I feel blessed to have see this on a print. The story Kinoshita tells is a simple and sad one, played with great feeling and tenderness by his young leads Noriko Arita and Shinji Tanaka, and the inevitable tragic ending is very moving.\n\n18 – The Long Darkness (Kei Kumai, 1972) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nI spent so much of this film bracing myself for something tragic, but turns out that all of the tragedy is in the backstory. Waitress Shino is a child of the red light district, while student Tetsuro comes from a family marked by a history of mental illness and suicide. All of this is laid out by the characters as they get to know each other, and while I thought Kei Kumai was building to a dark revelation involving Tetsuro's visually impaired sister, the second half of the film is deliberately anti-climactic. It's just a story about two young people who fall in love, make peace with their pasts, and get married, and Kumai tells this story with great patience and attention to character details. The film trundles along pleasantly at an even pace, which makes it hard to know where exactly we are in the narrative (the abrupt ending took me by surprise), and it's gorgeously shot by Kiyomi Kuroda, with Kumai throwing in a few unexpected stylistic flourishes. The performances from Go Kato and Komaki Kurihara couldn't be better, with Kurihara being particularly captivating. I don't think I've seen this actress in anything else, she had my heart the very first time she smiled.\n\n17 – Flesh and Blood (Anthony Kimmins, 1951) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nBased on the title I had anticipated something in the vein of a Hammer horror, so I was completely taken by surprise by this unusual and ambitious picture, which spans decades as it follows the often tragic fortunes of a medical family. The film packs an awful lot into its 96 minutes and director Anthony Kimmins keeps it moving fluidly, with some clever transitions marking time gaps, while Otto Heller lights it superbly. The film was shown to mark Joan Greenwood's centenary, and while she doesn't have as much screen time as one might expect, she is marvellous as the naïve young woman who gets mixed up with the working class George Cole. It's a film of two halves, and the second is distinguished by a very charming Glynis Johns performance - as the straight-talking suffragette who falls for Richard Todd's fiery scientist - and by the fascinating depiction of a pandemic outbreak.\n\n16 – The Nanny (Seth Holt, 1965) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nYou go into this Hammer production expecting Davis to be the nanny from hell, but for much of the movie she is an innocent, matronly figure, and the real terror is her 10 year-old charge Joey. Surly, demanding, disobedient and constantly up to something, Joey is unquestionably one of the most slappable child characters in film history, and with William Dix's terrific performance, he's a formidable foe for Davis. The uniformly strong acting is the highlight of this picture - Pamela Franklin is also a standout as Joey's teenage neighbour - and the film is a smart and efficient piece of work, which does a good job of keeping us guessing who the real villain is between Joey and The Nanny. Things get a bit more clunky in the final third with some awkward plot developments and motivation shifts (I fear some lines of dialogue were lost in this choppy print too), but it's an incredibly entertaining film.\n\n15 – Two Gentlemen Sharing (Ted Kotcheff, 1969) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nA fascinating film about race, class and sexuality in 1960s London, exploring how two flatmates, one black and one white, see each other's worlds and their own identity. Jamaican lawyer Andrew carries himself as a perfect English gentleman but knows he will never be accepted as part of the establishment, while advertising executive Roddy is drawn to black culture but often seems to view it as a voyeuristic tourist. \"It's a joke: me trying to get into the English middle class, and you trying to get out,\" Andrew says. Roddy's repressed homosexuality, strongly suggested throughout, is also a key factor in his climactic identity crisis crack-up. Ted Kotcheff puts together some excellent sequences - notably an immersive Caribbean party at Shoreditch Town Hall and a strange, awkward trip to Roddy's crumbling family home - and he gets fine work from his actors. Norman Rossington steals scenes as Roddy's boorish pal, and the late reveal of how he lives is hilarious. Aside from the film's own knotty, compelling qualities, it's a wonderful snapshot of a whole cross-section of London life in this era, and on this knockout print the colours absolutely popped!\n\n14 – The Man Who Stole the Sun (Hasegawa Kazuhiko, 1979) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nA true one-off, The Man Who Stole the Sun is the story of a lazy high school science teacher (superbly played by Kenji Sawada) who decides to steal some plutonium and construct a nuclear bomb in his apartment, but then doesn't seem sure what to do with it. He begins making demands (uninterrupted baseball games on TV, a Rolling Stones concert in Tokyo) but mainly he gets involved in a cat-and-mouse game with a tough detective (Bunta Sugawara). That's about all there is for a plot, and this movie has no business being two and a half hours long, but every time I felt like the movie was starting to stall, something unexpected and ridiculous would happen. The film works as a media satire and a commentary on the absurdity of nuclear proliferation, but generally it works as a shaggy deadpan comedy. There are lots of terrific sequences dotted throughout The Man Who Stole the Sun (the plutonium heist sequence is inspired), but the escalating lunacy of the final 30-40 minutes is truly something to behold, with Bunta Sugawara's performance as the unstoppable cop coming into its own here.\n\n13 – Our Mother's House (Jack Clayton, 1967) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nAlthough he is top-billed, Dirk Bogarde only turns up around halfway through this strange, haunting and completely absorbing picture. Most of the film is carried by the seven children who react to their mother's death by burying her in the back garden and contentedly going on with their lives, while Bogarde delivers a sly turn as their dissolute and conniving father, who decides to exploit this situation. The film is very astute when it comes to the children's behaviour, with the deeply religious convictions their mother embedded in them leading to a couple of dark moments, notably the very upsetting scene when they punish young Gerty by chopping off her hair. Clayton skilfully navigates through a series of tricky scenes and tonal shifts while getting remarkably authentic performances from all of the kids. The sole disappointment is that this 35mm print (the only one available) had faded to a reddish brown hue that didn't do much to show off the work of cinematographer Larry Pizer; he creates some beautiful compositions here, and I'd love to see this undervalued film restored to its original look.\n\n12 – August 32nd on Earth (Denis Villeneuve, 1998) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the Denis Villeneuve film I saw in 2021 which consisted of people wandering about in the desert. No, not Dune (which I never got around to seeing, as I generally find Villeneuve to be a crushing bore), but his eccentric debut August 32nd on Earth. The film has a sense of humour and a brash, youthful energy and romanticism that I found very appealing, and the chemistry between Pascale Bussières and Alexis Martin kept me hooked. I also loved André Turpin's widescreen images and the way he framed the two lead characters against their surroundings. This is very much the attention-grabbing work of a first-time director, full of showy camera moves and jump-cuts. I don't know what it ultimately adds up to, and towards the end it feels like he has no idea how to finish the story, but it's pretty captivating in the moment, and it's probably the only Denis Villeneuve film I'd consider watching more than once.\n\n11 – Passport to Shame (Alvin Rakoff, 1958) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nOriginally, this film apparently opened with a solemn address by a police officer denouncing the trafficking of girls into the London sex trade. We didn't get that on this print, which begins with a clever credits sequence focusing on the legs of pedestrians, before revealing the stunning form of Diana Dors. She's one of the prostitutes working for a sinister pimp played by Herbert Lom, who operates two adjoining brothels; one \"classy\" establishment, and the low-rent rooms next door where uncooperative girls are sent. The story is lurid but compelling, and it's directed with a real sense of style by Rakoff, who uses the camera expressively (Nic Roeg was the operator) and throws in a surreal nightmare sequence. The cast is strong all the way down. Eddie Constantine and Odile Versois are surprisingly sweet in their scenes together, and Robert Brown is a welcome presence as Eddie's loyal pal. Jackie Collins and Joan Sims make an impression with their brief roles, and there's even a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance for Michael Caine and Anne Reid.\n\n10 – Nadja (Michael Almereyda, 1994) – ICA, 35mm.\n\nI'm pretty sure that's the first time I've seen Fisher Price named in a film's end credits as a supplier of camera equipment. Blending Jim Denault's atmospheric cinematography with the grainy, smeary 'pixelvision' of his toy camera is just one of the ways Almereyda experiments with vision and sound to create something really unusual and compelling. Nadja is a playful spin on the Dracula story, casting Elina Löwensohn and Jared Harris as the vampire's offspring, and exploring their entangled family dynamics. The film is a little clunky and uneven, but it boasts an unexpected and welcome streak of goofy humour (much of it provided by Peter Fonda's Van Helsing), and it's such a distinctive product of the mid-90s indie filmmaking scene, existing partway between Hal Hartley and Abel Ferrara, whose similarly styled The Addiction was made a year later. It was a real privilege to discover this film on what is the only 35mm print that still exists in Europe.\n\n9 – Silence Has No Wings (Kazuo Kuroki, 1966) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nSilence Has No Wings begins with a young boy catching a rare butterfly (a gorgeous sequence) but failing to convince anyone that he really caught it, and then the film follows a caterpillar as it travels across Japan - even taking a detour via Hong Kong - and gives us a bug's eye view of Japanese society. We meet characters involved in crime and vice, others engaged with a protest movement, and some haunted by their status as survivors of the atomic bomb. The film feels allegorical and political, and concerned with questions of freedom and transformation, but it's hard to discern what it's ultimately about. However, I was completely entranced by Kazuo Kuroki's filmmaking. The film is full of amazing close-ups (of both humans and insects), bold angles, freeze-frames and jarring cuts. It's one of the most visually striking films I've seen this year, and I found the experience of watching it incredibly stimulating and beguiling, even as it confounded me.\n\n8 – Quintet (Robert Altman, 1979) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nOne of the notorious flops that led to Robert Altman being exiled from Hollywood in the early 1980s, Quintet is a wintry post-apocalyptic film that moves at a glacial pace, is built around a game that remains completely impenetrable, and consists of a series of enigmatic conversations that do little to further our understanding of these characters and their motivations. I guess it’s not hard to see why this sci-fi epic failed to find an audience in a post-Star Wars world. This is a bewildering film on so many levels, but it's also a mesmerising one. Quintet is an extraordinarily atmospheric production, with some remarkable location work and production design creating a desolate, brutal world where humanity has lost all sense of hope. It’s the kind of film that nobody but Robert Altman would have made, and I'm glad I got to discover it on such an impeccable print. For better and for worse, there's nothing quite like it.\n\n7 – Children of the Beehive (Hiroshi Shimizu, 1948) - 35mm\n\nA gang of orphans and a repatriated soldier form a kind of makeshift family as they travel through postwar Japan in this remarkable film. Shimizu takes a neo-realist approach, casting non-professionals and shooting on location, and he has given us a fascinating perspective on a country devastated by war, and in particular the innocent victims forced to do anything to survive. In his introduction to this screening, co-programmer Alexander Jacoby mentioned Kore-eda as a successor to Shimizu, and there is certainly a kinship in their ability to bring out the personalities and emotions of children on screen. Children of the Beehive is initially charming and funny, but it saves some astonishingly powerful moments for its second half. There's a haunting scene set at Hiroshima, and another where one of the boys carries his friend up a steep mountain, which is a legitimately stunning and ultimately heartbreaking sequence.\n\n6 – Pale Flower (Masahiro Shinoda, 1964) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nIs there anything better than watching black-and-white widescreen Japanese films projected from 35mm? There's something irresistible about the look of so many films from this era of Japanese cinema, and Pale Flower is among the most ravishing, with its sensational high-contrast nocturnal cinematography and countless brilliantly crafted compositions. Shinoda's direction is so exhilarating, and perfectly suited to this story of bored characters chasing ever more dangerous thrills (\"I'll show you something even better than dope. I'm going to kill a man. Want to come?\"). I loved watching all the gambling scenes despite having no idea what was going on, I loved every close-up on the stunning and enigmatic Mariko Kaga, and I loved the melancholy ending. It's just an incredibly exciting and satisfying film to watch on the big screen.\n\n5 – Muddy River (Kōhei Oguri, 1981) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nShot in Academy ratio black-and-white, Oguri's debut feature is a self-conscious homage to the cinema of Japan's Golden Age, but this is no nostalgia piece. Seen from the perspective of nine-year-old Nobuo, who befriends the neglected children of a local prostitute, the film is a portrait of those left behind by Japan's postwar prosperity, and a critique of the nation that left its returning veterans to live and die in poverty. Oguri fills his film with beautifully observed moments, and the scene where Nobuo's family invite his new friends to dinner is a masterclass in acting and framing. Shōhei Andō's gorgeous lighting was well served by this excellent print, and the last few minutes of the film are heartbreaking. Muddy River should be regarded as yet another Japanese entry in the annals of the great films about childhood.\n\n4 – Tales From The Hood (Rusty Cundieff, 1995) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nI always worry with anthology films that one story is going to let the side down, but there's no chance of that here. Each of the short stories in Tales From The Hood is superbly crafted, and they add up to one hugely enjoyable and satisfying package. What's really remarkable about the film is that for all of its humour, invention and spectacular deaths (and this film has some REALLY spectacular deaths), it engages with social issues and black history in a fascinating way. Tales From The Hood explores police brutality, gang warfare, drugs, domestic abuse, right-wing politics and reparations, but the film's engagement with these subjects never feels heavy-handed or gets in the way of the comedy and horror. The film is full of bold, surprising and potent imagery, and at its centre it boasts a very memorable performance from Clarence Williams III, with his wild eyes and crazy grin and milking every bit of juice from the phrase \"The shit.\" It's an extraordinary film and it was a privilege to see it on an absolutely spotless 35mm print.\n\n3 – Ten Skies (James Benning, 2004) – ICA, 16mm\n\nA work of such simplicity and purity. Ten shots of the sky, each lasting for around ten minutes, although some felt much shorter than others to me. Cloud formations drift across the screen, some illuminated by a celestial light while others are dark and heavy. In the distance we hear the drone of an airplane, muffled and indistinct conversations, and even some gunshots, but whatever is happening outside the frame, Benning just keeps his camera pointed upwards. Ten Skies invites us to give our attention to something that is always in sight but often goes unnoticed; we are given the time and space to look at the sky, contemplate it, react to it, and let our thoughts drift along with it. Seeing this film projected from a 16mm print with an attentive audience was entirely entrancing, and more moving than I anticipated. A really special cinema experience.\n\n2 – The Man who Came to Dinner (William Keighley, 1942) - BFI Southbank, 35mm\n\nI'd somehow never heard of this movie before I sat down to watch it at the BFI, but it had me laughing for two solid hours. The Epsteins' screenplay (from a play by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman) is wall-to-wall acerbic dialogue, with the lion's share of it consisting of the venomous insults that Monty Woolley spits at anyone who comes near him. Sheridan Whiteside is a monstrous character and Woolley absolutely relishes every single line. Davis gives the film its understated emotional centre while the rest of the actors are allowed to go hilariously big, but this is a real ensemble piece, with everyone pulling their weight and displaying crack comic timing. Ann Sheridan, Reginald Gardiner, Mary Wickes and George Barbier are the standouts, while William Keighley handles the escalating chaos and multiple plot threads with impressive efficiency."
