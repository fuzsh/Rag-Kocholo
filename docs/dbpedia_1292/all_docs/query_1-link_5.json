Max intends to write a book about the exotic Alwina, as well as molding her into a sophisticated, alluring woman. He brings Alwina back to Paris, presenting her as an Indian princess, and immediately sets off fireworks with his wife -- who is not impressed with her husband's dalliance. The city, on the other hand, is delighted by Alwina.",
