French filmmaker Edmond Gréville’s work isimaginative, filled with jaw-dropping camera work, energetic editing, and a cinephile’s love of moviemaking, with a style that echoes the visual-centric work similar auteur maudits like Edgar G. Ulmer Ulmer or Joseph H. Lewis.

Gréville made over 35+ features from 1931 to 1965 in French and English, but today, he has mostly been forgotten. By the time he passed away in 1966, he was so poor, that a bunch of his young filmmaker friends had to raise money to keep him from being buried in a pauper’s grave.

In an attempt to help out the interested parties who want to explore Greville’s filmography I’ve made a list of the current availability of all of his films. When possible, I’ve linked to a site that sells/or sold a DVD copy. This list may be incomplete, so feel free to let me know if I missed something in the comment section below.

For the best rundown of Edmond Gréville’s work, I highly recommend reading the essay written by Bertrand Tavernier which you can read here.

WARNING: Some of the DVDs I mention do not include English subtitles, but fan subtitles have been created by a number of different online film groups, which I have listed if possible. I’ve come across some of his Gréville’s films on Youtube or sites like Dailymotion that been subsequently taken down, so if I know a copy of one of his films exists out there, I’ve marked it down as ‘Floating Around on The Internet’, as frustrating as that may be.
