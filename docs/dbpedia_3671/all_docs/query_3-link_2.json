        "text": "This debut album is a hidden treasure, a little known set of contemporary Christian pearls. Trevor is one of the best songsmiths—and most effective musical evangelists—out there, and it shows in these 12 original songs.\n\nSeveral songs utilize Caribbean rhythms and percussion, including \"The Path of Life,\" a rousing reggae setting of Psalm 16. Marked by passionate vocals and beautiful harmonies, the title track speaks of the power of fellowship and the presence of God where two or more are gathered: \"We are gathered as people who are living the Word. Our hearts and our spirits are nurtured by grace. It is Jesus who fills us; He is here in this place.\"\n\nOther highlights include \"In You, Lord,\" a delightful ballad based on Psalm 131. Tom Booth makes an appearance, supplying his usual magic touch on backup vocals, electric guitar and mandolin. The album closes with Trevor honoring Mary in a haunting, solo, a cappella rendition of Schubert's \"Ave Maria.\" These days, Trevor is making quite a name for himself. It all started with In This Place.\n\nBear witness to the Paschal Mystery\n\nRecently appearing on Tom Booth's Captured and Jackie François' Your Kingdom is Glorious, Trevor fully demonstrates his vocal and songwriting talents in his first full album in over six years. Triumphant and eclectic, Christ in Me Arise bears powerful witness to the passion, death and resurrection of our Lord.\n\nEvoke the soaring vocals of Coldplay's Chris Martin\n\nFeatured on The Commons (spiritandsong.com's streaming video series), the title track speaks of overcoming the trials of life with the hope that only Christ can offer—great for Preparation of Gifts. \"Immortal, Invisible\" gathers some of the biggest names in contemporary Catholic music, including Tom Booth, Matt Maher and Danielle Rose! On the poetic \"Firefly,\" Trevor's soaring vocals are reminiscent of Chris Martin's (Coldplay) work on \"Yellow\" and \"Fix You.\"\n\nCombine liturgical sensibility with rich layers of guitar\n\nThe driving guitar stylings of Taylor Johnson—who's recorded albums with The David Crowder Band and Robbie Seay—are showcased throughout the CD. Combined with Trevor's emotion and liturgical sensibility, these rich layers of flavor lift the songs to a whole new level.\n\nInspire young and old in worship\n\nTrevor Thomson has a proven track record of inspiring congregations of all ages. Parishes who use Breaking Bread or Music Issue know him from liturgical staples, such as \"We Belong To You\" and \"In This Place.\" With his latest album, this seasoned composer provides another collection of songs that call us to worship.\n\nTracks: I Will Restore You | Center | Firefly | Sarah's Song | Send your Glory Down | Sweet Glow of Mercy | Christ in Me Arise | You Are All I Need | Immortal, Invisible | So Much More | Beautiful One | Go Forth | Carry Me Away | More of You\n\nThis debut album is a hidden treasure, a little known set of contemporary Christian pearls.
