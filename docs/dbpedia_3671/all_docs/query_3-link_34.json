        "text": "Dr. Trevor Thompson joined the Neuroradiology section at OHSU as an Assistant Professor in 2023. Dr. Thompson received his medical degree from Ohio State University in 2012 after which he served as a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force Medical Corps for nearly a decade. During this time, Dr. Thompson completed residency training in diagnostic radiology at David Grant USAF Medical Center in California and worked as an active-duty general radiologist at Mike O’Callaghan Military Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada where he had the opportunity to lead various imaging sections and care for both active duty and retired military personal as well as their families.\n\nAfter concluding his military service, Dr. Thompson completed a fellowship in neuroradiology at University of Cincinnati Medical Center with specific interest in imaging of the head and neck as well as performance of image-guided diagnostic and therapeutic spine procedures. Following this, Dr. Thompson pursued a second subspecialty fellowship in pediatric neuroradiology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, which is consistently ranked as one of the top children’s hospitals in the United States. This training provided Dr. Thompson with additional expertise in all facets of pediatric and fetal neuroimaging, a skillset he looks forward to sharing with the patients and families receiving care at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.\n\nDr. Thompson spent much of his childhood in Oregon and looks forward to being back around family and friends as well as the incredible people, community, culture, and natural beauty unique to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nBefore scheduling your appointment, we recommend you contact your insurance company to verify that the OHSU Health location or provider you plan to visit is included in your network. Your insurance company will also be able to inform you of any copayments, co–insurance, or deductibles that will be your responsibility. If you proceed in scheduling an appointment and your health insurance benefits do not participate with OHSU providers, your out of pocket liability may be higher.
