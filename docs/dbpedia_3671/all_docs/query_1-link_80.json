        "text": "1974 studio album by Richard and Linda Thompson\n\nI Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight is the second album released by Richard Thompson, and his first to include his then wife, Linda Thompson, the pair being credited as Richard and Linda Thompson. It was issued by Island Records in the UK in 1974. Although the album did not sell and was critically ignored (and not released outside of the UK until by Hannibal Records in 1983), it has been descried as \"a timeless masterpiece\" and considered one of the finest releases by the two singers, whether working singly or together.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the marked lack of success achieved by his first album, Henry the Human Fly, British singer-songwriter/guitarist Richard Thompson started a personal and professional relationship with Linda Peters, a session singer. I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight was the first album by the duo of Richard and Linda Thompson.\n\nSessions for the album took place at the Sound Techniques studio in Chelsea, London, over a few weeks during spring 1973, with house engineer John Wood co-producing with Thompson. The album, provisionally titled Hokey Pokey, was recorded on a shoestring budget of £2,500; owing to vinyl shortages, it was not released until 1974.[2]\n\nWhere his first album was treated harshly by the critics, the second was eventually hailed as a masterpiece. It is now regarded as a classic of English folk rock and one of the Thompsons' finest achievements.\n\nIn the sleeve notes for the 2004 CD re-release, David Suff writes: \"Throughout the album Richard's sombre, dark songs are driven by his masterful understated guitar and Linda's haunting spiritual vocals. The songs detail a beautiful yet desolate world of life before the fall, the lives of the homeless, the thief and the inebriate. The songs are thoroughly English in their mood and responsibility, wry observations of the hopelessness of the human condition.\"[2] Considering the song \"End of the Rainbow\", Suff writes:\n\nRichard denies that the song is totally pessimistic, \"there's always hope in the third verse of my songs\" yet the overall effect is a magnificent evocation of disillusionment. Thompson's songs are despairing but not self-pitying, leaving the listener with an abiding sense of peace and, paradoxically hope.[2]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[3]Encyclopedia of Popular Music[4]Pitchfork8.5/10[5]Robert ChristgauA−[6]Q[7]Rolling Stone[8]The Rolling Stone Album Guide[9]Spin Alternative Record Guide10/10[10]\n\nInitially ignored by reviewers, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight later came to be highly regarded. Robert Christgau rated it highly when it was re-released as one-half of Live! (More or Less) noting that \"[they] don't sentimentalize about time gone—they simply encompass it in an endless present.\"[6] When it was re-released in 1984, along with other albums in the Thompsons' catalogue, Kurt Loder writing in Rolling Stone described it as a \"timeless masterpiece\" with \"not a single track that's less than luminous\".[8]\n\nMore recent reviews are equally complimentary. AllMusic notes that the album is \"nothing short of a masterpiece\" and calls it \"music of striking and unmistakable beauty\".[3] Q (May 2007, p. 135): \"After his 1971 departure from Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson found his ideal foil in recent bride Linda. A hugely inventive guitarist, he gives full vent to his talent on this dark, brooding album. Indeed, he never quite recaptured the murky demons inside the likes of 'Withered and Died' ever again.\" In the 2004 CD re-release, Chris Jones at the BBC noted that \"Bright Lights...performs the most perfect balancing act between hard-bitten cynicism and honest humanism.\"[11]\n\nIt was voted number 814 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).[12] In 2003 the album was placed at number 479 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was placed at number 485 in the 2020 edition.[13][14] The album also appeared in the Mojo \"100 Greatest Albums Ever Made\".[2]\n\nWriting for Something Else! in 2018, Preston Frazier said, \"'The Great Valerio' is just one gem among gems. Richard Thompson's writing is masterful, painting in broad, vivid strokes. Time indeed stands still as Linda Thompson tells the vivid tale, with a hint of detached anxiety... Featuring only Linda's voice and Richard Thompson's Kensington-style picked acoustic, 'The Great Valerio' is dark, yet vivid as it leads the listener to imagine the great fall. Linda Thompson never oversells the proposition, using her voice like the fine instrument it is.\"[15]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nBonus tracks were recorded at the Roundhouse, London, on 7 September 1975.\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nMusicians\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Thompson – guitar, vocals, Hammered dulcimer (10), mandolin (1,8), tin whistle (1,7), piano (2), electric piano (5), harmonium (7)\n\nLinda Thompson – vocals\n\nTimi Donald – drums\n\nPat Donaldson – bass guitar\n\nJohn Kirkpatrick – accordion, concertina (1,3,7,8)\n\nSimon Nicol – dulcimer (5)\n\nBrian Gulland – krummhorn (1,6)\n\nRichard Harvey – krummhorn (1,6)\n\nRoyston Wood – harmony bass vocals (6, possibly 2)\n\nTrevor Lucas – harmony vocals (5, possibly 2)\n\nThe CWS (Manchester) Silver Band (4,7)\n\nBonus tracks: Richard and Linda Thompson with John Kirkpatrick, Dave Pegg (bass guitar) and Dave Mattacks (drums).\n\nTechnical\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Wood – producer and engineer\n\nRichard Thompson – producer\n\nCover design – unknown\n\n2004 CD re-release:\n\nTim Chacksfield – research and project co-ordination\n\nJoe Black – project co-ordination for Universal\n\nDavid Suff – sleeve note and archive assistance\n\nPhil Smee – CD package design\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nOther sources\n\n[edit]\n\nHumphries, Patrick (1997).
