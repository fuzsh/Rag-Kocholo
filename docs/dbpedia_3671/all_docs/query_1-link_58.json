        "text": "Musical artist\n\nChristopher Hamlet Thompson (born 9 March 1948) is an English singer, songwriter and guitarist known both for his work with Manfred Mann's Earth Band, specifically for his lead vocal on the classic hit \"Blinded by the Light\" and for his solo accomplishments.[1]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nThompson was born in Ashford, Kent, England, but raised in New Zealand.[2] His early musical experiences were whilst still at school with the band The Paragons that played at weekly church youth club dances. Later, as his talent became clear, the band was reformed as Dynasty with other musicians and achieved much local success on the New Zealand music scene. Thompson's last band in New Zealand was Mandrake, formed with university friends who played the Friday and Saturday night dances in and around Hamilton City.\n\nHe went to Australia before returning to England in 1973 to pursue a musical career, eventually joining Manfred Mann's Earth Band in 1976.[3]\n\nIn 1978, he was featured in Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, providing lead vocals for the song \"Thunder Child\".\n\nAfter several years with Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Thompson left in 1979 and formed the Los Angeles–based outfit Night,[4] which enjoyed two hits during its lifetime. One of them, \"If You Remember Me,\" the unused theme song for Franco Zeffirelli's remake of The Champ,[5] was initially credited solely to Thompson; later pressings of the single were credited to \"Chris Thompson and Night.\" (But this source[6] gives lyric credit to Carole Bayer Sager for \"If You Remember Me,\" and the music credit to Marvin Hamlisch.) The song reached #17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #7 Adult Contemporary.[7] It was a very minor hit in Canada (#91).[8] After the band broke up in 1982, he rejoined the Earth Band.\n\nIn 1980, he co-wrote and sang backing vocals on the track \"No Stoppin' Us Now\" with Patrick Simmons and Michael McDonald, on the Doobie Brothers' album One Step Closer. In 1983 he contributed vocals to Simmons' solo album Arcade as well as co-writing several of the tracks.\n\nIn 1981, Thompson released his debut album, Out of the Night. This was followed by five more albums, most recently Won't Lie Down in 2001.\n\nIn 1984, while functional lead singer for the re-formed Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Thompson lent lead vocals to \"Runner,\" which slowly climbed to become a USA and UK top 30 hit, propelled by then-hot MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1986, Thompson was one of the four co-writers of the hit song \"You're the Voice\" – the others being Andy Qunta of Australian new wave outfit Icehouse, erstwhile Procol Harum lyricist Keith Reid and Maggie Ryder. He hoped to record the song in London but was turned down by record companies there who stated the song was \"not commercial\". He sent a demo to John Farnham, who had recently come off a five-year stint fronting the Little River Band. Farnham liked the song and agreed to record it for his forthcoming album, Whispering Jack. Farnham's release of \"You're the Voice\" was a worldwide hit, reaching top ten positions in many countries across the world.\n\nAlso in 1986, Thompson sang vocals on a solo album by ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. The album featured performances by artists such as Brian May (Queen), Pete Trewavas (Marillion), Ian Mosley (also from Marillion), and Bonnie Tyler. However, the album, entitled Feedback 86, was not released until 2002.\n\nIn spite of his already busy schedule in 1986, Thompson still found the time to return to Manfred Mann for their new album, Criminal Tango, in addition to putting out some solo material. He recorded the song \"It's Not Over\" for the soundtrack to the film Playing for Keeps, and this track was also featured (with a slightly longer fade-out) on his new solo album, High Cost of Living, released later the same year. The following year, \"It's Not Over\" would be re-recorded by Starship, becoming a top-ten hit for the group.\n\nIn 1989, Thompson recorded the single \"The Challenge (Face It)\" as the official theme song for the 1989 Wimbledon Tennis Championships. He co-wrote the song with Harold Faltermeyer. A year later, in 1990, Thompson worked again with Faltermeyer in writing the 1990 song for Wimbledon, Hold the Dream by Franzisca.\n\nAlso in 1990, Thompson recorded the single \"This Is The Moment\" as the official theme song for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland.[9]\n\nIn 1992, Thompson performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert as a backing musician, harmonising as the baritone with respected backing vocalists Maggie Ryder (contralto) and Miriam Stockley (mezzo-soprano). He also joined The Brian May Band for their South American tour the same year.\n\nIn 1995, Thompson performed \"You're The Voice\" in the Netherlands at the World Liberty Concert as the grand finale of the event. He also sang a studio version of it on the Alan Parsons The Very Best Live album (1995).\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, he joined Jeff Wayne for a second time to tour as The Voice of Humanity in the live version of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds.[10] According to the special features of the DVD Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – Live on Stage, Thompson designed some artwork for the show.\n\nThompson has been featured on several albums by artists such as Alan Parsons,[2] Jan Hammer, Steve Hackett, Bonnie Tyler, Mike Oldfield, and Sarah Brightman, as well as providing backing vocals for Brian May of Queen, during his first few solo concerts in South America in 1992.\n\nThompson has also been involved with the SAS Band (Spike's All Star Band) where he has performed numerous songs, especially from his repertoire with Manfred Mann's Earth Band.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Manfred Mann's Earth Band\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Roaring Silence (1976)\n\nWatch (1978)\n\nAngel Station (1979)\n\nChance (1980)\n\nSomewhere in Afrika (1982)\n\nBudapest Live (1983)\n\nCriminal Tango (1986)\n\nSoft Vengeance (1996)\n\nMann Alive (1998)\n\n2006 (2004)\n\nSolo\n\n[edit]\n\nIf You Remember Me (1979)\n\nOut of the Night (1983)\n\nRadio Voices (1985)\n\nHigh Cost of Living (1986)\n\nBeat of Love (1989)\n\nThe Challenge (Face It) (1989)\n\nBacktrack 1980-1994 (1999)\n\nWon't Lie Down (2001)\n\nRediscovery (2004)\n\nTimeline (2005)\n\nChris Thompson & Band – One Hot Night in the Cold (Live at the Private Music Club) (2006)\n\nDo Nothing Till You Hear from Me (2012)\n\nToys & Dishes (2014)\n\nJukebox-The Ultimate Collection 1975-2015 (2015)\n\nOther collaborations\n\n[edit]\n\nA Week at the Bridge E16 (1978)[11] With Filthy McNasty (before becoming Night)\n\nJeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds (1978)[10] With Jeff Wayne\n\nA Single Man (1978) with Elton John\n\nThe Garden of Love (1978) with Don Ray\n\nNight (1979) with Night\n\nLong Distance (1981) with Night\n\nOne Step Closer (1980) with The Doobie Brothers\n\nWolf (1981) with Trevor Rabin\n\nWaving Not Drowning (1982) with Rupert Hine\n\n\"All the Right Moves\" (1983) with Jennifer Warnes\n\nArcade (1983) with Patrick Simmons\n\nPush and Shove (1985) with Chris Thompson With Hazel O'Connor\n\nRunning the Endless Mile (1986) with John Parr\n\nSeeds of Life (1986) with Jan Hammer\n\nWhispering Jack (1986)[12] With John Farnham\n\nRobbie Nevil (1986) with Robbie Nevil\n\nA Place Like This (1988) with Robbie Nevil\n\nLove Among the Cannibals (1989) with Starship\n\nTabaluga and the Magic Jadestone (1988) with Peter Maffay\n\nTake What You Need (1989) with Robin Trower\n\nAfter the War (1989) with Gary Moore\n\nEarth Moving (1989) with Mike Oldfield\n\nTry Anything Once (1993) with Alan Parsons\n\nAlan Parsons Live/The Very Best Live (1994/95) with Alan Parsons\n\nExcalibur featuring Michael Ernst (2003) with Alan Parsons\n\nFree Spirit (1996) with Bonnie Tyler\n\nSAS Band (1997) with SAS Band\n\nThe Show (2001) with SAS Band\n\nMetallic Blue (1998) with Steelhouse Lane\n\nSlaves of New World (1999) with Steelhouse Lane\n\nFeedback 86 (2000) with Steve Hackett\n\nRedhanded (2001) with Mads Eriksen\n\nRediscovery (2004)[13] With Mads Eriksen\n\nBerlin Live & The Aschaffenburg Remains Live at the Colos-Saal (2012) with Mads Eriksen\n\nSoulmates (2002) with Mandoki Soulmates\n\nJazz Cuts (2003) with Mandoki Soulmates\n\nAllstars, \"Legends of Rock\" (2004) with Mandoki Soulmates\n\nBudaBest (2013) with Mandoki Soulmates\n\nPolarity (2003) with Lava\n\nExcalibur (2003) with Michael Ernst\n\nLive (2005) with Siggi Schwarz & The Rock Legends\n\nWoodstock (2005) with Siggi Schwarz & The Rock Legends\n\nSoul Classics (2007) with Siggi Schwarz & The Rock Legends\n\nOn My Side (2006) with Rudi Buttas\n\nHow Can Heaven Love Me (1995) with Sarah Brightman\n\nI Will Be with You (Where the Lost Ones Go) (Pokémon 10: The Rise of Darkrai) (2007) with Sarah Brightman\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera (Symphony: Live in Vienna) (2008) with Sarah Brightman\n\nMitten Ins Herz (2008) with Nicole\n\nMake Me an Offer (2009) with Lindy Bingham\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
