        "text": "I have learned a great deal from this class and the many modules we partook in over the summer term. I learned from the modules how to find and use reliable sources and also how to determine if a source is reliable or not or if you can use it and it be helpful to your work. I have also learned how to write blog posts and encrypt videos into my blog post. I learned that there are many online tools that are very beneficial to your success in school and in life. I learned how to use Google calendar and use it to keep track of my time and mange it and also worked a lot on my organizational skills.\n\nWhat have I learned about my self over the course of this summer session term. I have learned a lot I’ve learned I have to open my mouth and not keep quiet like I usually do when I don’t understand something and to just ask for help. I have also learned that I really really procrastinate with a a lot of stuff and its really bad because I can’t keep waiting last minute to turn in assignments and expecting to get a good grade. By learning how to communicate when I have a problem or when I don’t understand something with my teachers and tutors have helped me a lot and have helped me understand the information and get it down. I have also learned about my self that I cant do everything by myself and that there is nothing with asking for help. Its defiantly hard with the pressure and work load I have to deal with. Having to wake up at 6am for workouts then having to go to class right after then come to study then after go to practice is a lot and allowing people in my life to help me and listen to the advice and not think I can do it all by myself has really come to help me a lot and help me grow as a person.\n\nMy most meaningful experience in the course was when I met with you and you allowed me the opportunity to raise my grades up and turn in my missing work. Me being given that opportunity was very meaningful and great because I turned in all my work and I got all my grades back up and running. In life you rarely get second chances but with that second chance I made sure I would not mess it up.\n\nI will apply everything I learned from this class with the knowledge I have come to learn from this class. I will greatly use it in my future classes I will have. My ability now to find information to find good sources and good information and to pick between if the information is reliable or not will come into great use with my future at Ohio state that information I was taught in this class will not only help me with my future classes but will help me for the rest of my life.\n\nThis week I have learned how to use different note taking strategies and watching videos to explain difficult topics. The first note taking strategies I learned was the mind map. The mind map uses your thoughts and puts the main idea in a big bubble then the break off ideas into smaller bubbles that connect to the bigger bubble. The next thing I learned is the Cornell method. It is a method that breaks down the lecture into main topics, each with its own main points. Last I learned about the key words that you learn the technical terms to look up and define later.\n\nVideos are great ways to learn a topic. They visually give you a good learning experience on what you are learning. Some people are visual learners so videos are great for them. For example I watched a video about the phases of the moon. I found it very helpful because the speaker did a very good job of explaining the information. I personally like learning from a video because I am more a visual learner the listing. Overall I think this strategy is most helpful to a lot of people from learning from a video.\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab (OWL)\n\nhttp://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab is helpful because it helps you with writing papers.
