        "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) – Councilman Kenneth Stokes was joined by many in the community for a protest on Sunday against the Texaco gas station on Medgar Evers Boulevard after the recent homicides and crime in the area.\n\nHe says he will be bringing up a vote of no confidence against the city’s legal department and director for not declaring the gas station a nuisance and shutting it down before now.\n\n“Where people suffer harm or injury, it’s got to be considered a nuisance. How many people have to die here before they realize it’s harmful?” Councilman Stokes said.\n\nThe most recent homicide happened earlier this month when 23-year-old Jacobi Austin was shot and killed in front of the gas station.\n\nAnother deadly shooting happened at the beginning of the year, taking the life of 47-year-old Rodger Fulgham.\n\nThis is not the first time people have called for the closure of the business.\n\nThose in the community plan to keep speaking up until the safety issue in the area is handled.\n\n“We want to make sure that when we go in these stores, our kids go into stores or wives and children… Hey, we want to make sure that we safe when we go into these places,” Enoch Sanders said.\n\n“We’re gonna keep on coming and we’re gonna keep on fighting until we get something done until we save people from getting killed right here,” Byron Brunfield said.\n\n“The citizens stand up and speak out. We’re going to continue to do that. For the next generation, those next ones up, they’re going to be affected. We want to make sure we change the narrative,” Andrew Campbell said.\n\nCouncilman Stokes, who has been pushing for security guards at convenience stores, will have the item for the next city council meeting on July 30.\n\nStokes and residents feel like shutting down the business is the only way to handle the growing issue in the area.\n\n“If you are providing a business that you see is detrimental to the community that you’re serving and that your business is causing people to lose their lives. Then you should have the integrity of a human being for yourself to say, we need to shut this down,” Joseph Holiday said.\n\nWLBT 3 On Your Side will update you if any developments take place at the city council meeting.\n\n…And right now, my nerves is so bad and I’m quiverin’ on the inside and I can’t help it.\n\nI’m beggin’ y’all not to give them pardon because they done it.\n\nYour minds might be made up. I don’t know.\n\nIf you do [pardon them], y’all going to be just like them…\n\nAnd that’s all I got to say, ’cause I know I’m telling the truth.\n\nI went to court twice.…\n\nI can tell you right now — not the exact words — but could tell you today almost quote to what I said then. And if any of you got any questions, ask me, I’ll answer them the best I know how.\n\nLike I say…if something happens to any of my kids I hope it ponders y’all’s mind [because] I begged you not to do it and it’s liable to.\n\nLike I said, if there’s any question ya’ll want to ask me, I’ll try to answer it if I can."
