        "text": "I thought he was one of the weaker players in a team of top players. Akin to Paul Parker playing for England.\n\nHe scored at Fulham. God that was a frenetic final ten minutes. How we didnâ€™t score again fits me to this day.\n\nA very consistent player though and would have been a star player in later teams. Barely missed a game in his three years with us and released too early in my opinion\n\nAlso as you say go on to play at the top level ie premier league like that lot did.\n\nWill never happen in todays football unless you sign for a team which gets consecutive promotions over a 2/3 year period. Even then you'll probably be replaced by an unknown Macedonian before the Premier league starts\n\nThanks for posting that. 8,500 there if I remember rightly. Remember looking forward to MotD so much and being disappointed with the brief footage shown. Still good to see the bog rolls flying onto the pitch. 'Big' Dave Carr was a 7/10 Sam of his day. Another one who went too soon.\n\nIn an era when MOTD only showed three games ( if memory serves ) the coverage on the programme was mightily disappointing. Me and some mates had strategically placed ourselves by that corner flag Keeley swung his cross in from, leaning on the walls, in a vain attempt to be seen on the telly. Failed completely with the limited match time shown.\n\nYeah the current lot are good but that side of Murphy's side of 79-83 is the one I judge all Lincoln sides by, so this lot need to be top end of the third to be as good imho. Also as you say go on to play at the top level ie premier league like that lot did.\n\nSame for me . That Murphy side is the benchmark in my head. Taylor's side (before my time) smashed the 4th Division but he left before they could build on it. Murphy's team took it to the next level. This Cowley era is the first chance we have had since, to equal or maybe even surpass that level. They are doing it in a different way though - Murphy kept mostly the same players and improved them. The Cowleys are turning over the playing staff to increase the quality.\n\nSame for me . That Murphy side is the benchmark in my head.

The Cowleys are turning over the playing staff to increase the quality.\n\nI was fortunate to witness boths sides, I would say in my minds eye that the Murph's team unequivocally the better of the two, nearly all of that team went onto play at a higher level, most in the First Division. Taylor's side of '75/'76 was at its peak and afterwards Taylor knew he had to rebuild, but unfortunatley the board at the time had different ideas, hence he eventually left.\n\nIf memory serves the Imps v Millwall was the feature match on MotD that night and the Bristol Rover one was an ITV's Soccer Sunday match not a MotD one.\n\nSo did I. Jimmy Hill (or whoever replied) it was by far the least entertaining match they filmed that day.\n\nRevenge from the the club perhaps, when they sent in an anniversary brochure in '76 to Jimmy Hills football spot on Friday's Nationwide, but failed to put any stamps on the envolope. Which Hill made a great play of live on air.\n\nAnyone else recall this?"
