        "text": "Early Life\n\nGrowing up in Dresden, Ontario, Trevor wasn’t truly introduced into the lifestyle and hustle and bustle of the big leagues until he finished his University degree at Ryerson. After graduating Trevor took a job with Orca Bay Sports & Entertainment (now known as Canucks Sports & Entertainment) which gave him his first on-air opportunity as a reporter/host. Trevor worked with the Vancouver Grizzlies (now known as the Memphis Grizzlies) and was responsible for sideline reporting, in-house reporting, in-house programming, as well as on-air reports on local television.\n\nTrevor’s talents were quickly recognized and a few years later he was offered an editorial assistant position with TSN in Toronto, ON. He was responsible for editing highlights for scripts for the television hosts, something Trevor hoped to be one day. As if living in Canada’s largest city and working for one of the leading sports networks in the world wasn’t enough, Trevor also worked part-time at CBC News on the weekends to make ends meet and get his name out there even more than it already was.\n\nThe big leagues\n\nOnce again word of Trevor’s talents in the reporting and broadcasting industry had spread, but this time was different. This time it wasn’t a small side job that would see Trevor helping the host, or editing his scripts, or only getting small segments of air time. This was the real deal. Trevor was offered a position with Fox Sports Detroit, just over 100 km’s from where he was born and raised, to be a reporter, host, and anchor. He was thrilled.\n\nTrevor soon became a household face and name for sports fans in Detroit, Michigan. He was on the sidelines of games interviewing star players, he was behind the desk when it was time to analyze a teams performance, he was the host of television programs and specials. His dream had finally become reality. Now the chair was his.\n\nHe quickly took advantage of his position and started to solidify his place in the hearts of Detroit sports fans. Through his many special television segments and programs, Trevor showed the city of Detroit just how energetic, fun-loving, and charismatic he is. His positive vibes and radiantly happy smile brought a new found energy to the city, and to the broadcasting world. Shown below is a short clip from one of his specials called “Trev Takes On”.\n\nTrevor has been fortunate enough to conduct countless interviews with some of the biggest names in sport history from Michael Jordan to Jack Nicklaus, yet when asked about his favourite interview his response was “there’s too many to count”. He says how it’s not about the fame of the athlete, but more getting to know them on a personal level and relating with them. Realizing that these are just humans the same as you and I, born with extraordinary talents.\n\nAdvice for students\n\nHis advice to those wishing to follow a similar path is as such “Be persistent. We have a saying that you aren’t in this business until you get fired. Accept different roles that keep you close to the business and learning more. Keep adding to your toolbox of knowledge and skills and you will become more valuable.”\n\nAuthor: Trent Scaman\n\nContributor: Trevor Thompson"
