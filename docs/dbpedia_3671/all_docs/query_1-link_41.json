        "meta_description": "1981  MTV begins broadcasting in the United States and airs its first video, 'Video Killed the Radio Star' by The Buggles. MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable television channel. It was officially launched on August 1, 1981. Based in New York City, it serves as the flagship property of the MTV Entertainment Group, part of Paramount Media Networks, a division of Paramount Global. The channel originally aired music videos and related programming as guided by television personalities known as video jockeys, or VJs. MTV, as one of the American cable channels available in other countries, eventually gained a massive cult following, becoming one of the major factors in cable programming's rise to fame and American corporations dominating the television economy in the 1990s. In the years since its inception, the channel significantly toned down its focus on music in favor of original reality programming for teenagers and young adults. As of November 2023, MTV is available to approximately 67,000,000 pay television households in the United States, down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households.",
