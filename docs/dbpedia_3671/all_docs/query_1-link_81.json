[1] Dan Dickerson calls play-by-play.[2] Bobby Scales and Andy Dirks rotate as the primary color analysts as of the 2024 season.[3] The games are available online as well via Audacy. If a scheduling conflict occurs, WWJ is a substitute for its sister station.\n\nWJR was the Tigers' radio flagship from 1964 to 2000. Other former Tigers flagships include WXYT (currently known as \"The Bet Detroit\") and WKMH (currently known as WDTW).\n\nTy Tyson (1927–1942, 1951)\n\nHarry Heilmann (1934–1950)\n\nPaul Williams (1951)\n\nVan Patrick (1952–1959)\n\nDizzy Trout (1953–1955)\n\nMel Ott (1956–1958)\n\nGeorge Kell (1959–1963)\n\nErnie Harwell (1960–1991, 1993, 1999–2002)\n\nBob Scheffing (1964)\n\nGene Osborn (1965–1966)\n\nRay Lane (1967–1972)\n\nPaul Carey (1973–1991)\n\nRick Rizzs (1992–1994)\n\nBob Rathbun (1992–1994)\n\nFrank Beckmann (1995–1998)\n\nLary Sorensen (1995–1998)\n\nJim Price (1998–2023)\n\nAl Kaline (2009, substitute analyst for select road games)[4]\n\nJohn Keating (2009, substitute analyst for select road games)[5]\n\nDan Petry (2012, 2019, 2021–2022, substitute analyst for select games)[6]\n\nKen Kal (2013, 2016, 2018, substitute play-by-play for select games)\n\nDan Hasty (2021, substitute play-by-play for one road game)\n\nAustin Jackson (2021–2022, substitute analyst for select road games)\n\nCraig Monroe (2021–2023, substitute analyst for select road games)\n\nAlex Avila (2022, substitute analyst for select road games)\n\nDoug Fister (2022, substitute analyst for road doubleheader)\n\nGreg Gania (2022, substitute play-by-play for road doubleheader)\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary Color Commentary Color Commentary 2023 WXYT-FM Dan Dickerson Jim Price Bobby Scales Cameron Maybin 2022 2021 2020\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary 2019 WXYT-FM Dan Dickerson Jim Price 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary 2009 WXYT-FM Dan Dickerson Jim Price 2008 2007 WXYT 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Ernie Harwell\n\nDan Dickerson Jim Price 2001 2000 WJR\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary/Secondary Play-by-Play 1999 WJR Ernie Harwell Jim Price 1998 Frank Beckmann Lary Sorensen (April–June)\n\nJim Price (June–September) 1997 Lary Sorensen 1996 1995 1994 Rick Rizzs Bob Rathbun 1993 Rick Rizzs\n\nErnie Harwell 1992 Rick Rizzs 1991 Ernie Harwell Paul Carey 1990\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary/Secondary Play-by-Play 1989 WJR Ernie Harwell Paul Carey 1988 1987 1986 1985 1984 1983 1982 1981 1980\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary/Secondary Play-by-Play 1979 WJR Ernie Harwell Paul Carey 1978 1977 1976 1975 1974 1973 1972 Ray Lane 1971 1970\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary/Secondary Play-by-Play 1969 WJR Ernie Harwell Ray Lane 1968 1967 1966 Gene Osborn 1965 1964 Bob Scheffing 1963 WKMH George Kell Ernie Harwell 1962 1961 1960\n\nYear Flagship stations Play-by-Play Color Commentary/Secondary Play-by-Play 1959 WKMH Van Patrick George Kell 1958 Mel Ott 1957 1956 1955 Dizzy Trout 1954 1953 1952 1951 WXYZ Ty Tyson Paul Williams 1950 Harry Heilmann\n\nThe television rights are currently held by Bally Sports Detroit (formerly Fox Sports Detroit). Jason Benetti serves as the primary play-by-play announcer beginning in 2024,[7] while Craig Monroe is color commentator.\n\nPre-game and post-game show hosts and reporters include John Keating, Mickey York, Trevor Thompson, Justin White, Cameron Maybin, and Johnny Kane, while Dan Petry provides studio analysis.\n\nThe Tigers have spent most of their broadcast televised history across two of Detroit's heritage \"Big Three\" network stations, WJBK (Channel 2, Fox; formerly with CBS from 1948 to 1994) and WDIV (Channel 4, NBC; originally WWJ-TV from 1947 to 1978), as well as two of the market's former legacy independent stations, WMYD (Channel 20, formerly WXON-TV and WDWB) and WKBD (Channel 50). Channel 4 was the original Tiger television outlet, carrying games from 1947 to 1952, and again for a twenty-season run from 1975 to 1994. Channel 4, at least during a time when NBC's ratings were sagging during the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, was one of a handful of the network's affiliates that was either a primary outlet or an affiliate of the local/regional baseball team.\n\nSignificant in the Tiger broadcasting network were television stations owned by Tigers' owner John Fetzer, including WKZO-TV (now WWMT) in Kalamazoo, WLNS in Lansing, WJRT in Flint, WWTV and WWUP-TV in northern Michigan, and even some television stations in Nebraska, namely KOLN-TV in Lincoln and its satellite in Grand Island, Nebraska.\n\nWJBK took over the Tigers telecasts starting with the 1953 season, and carried games until the end of the 1974 season; since 2007, the station simulcasts the team's home opener each season from Fox Sports Detroit. WKBD, for many years known as Detroit's leading independent TV station, as well as the longtime over-the-air TV home of the Red Wings and Pistons, televised Tigers games starting in 1995 (when it was an UPN owned-and-operated station) until 2003. WMYD televised selected Tigers games only for the 2006 season, and as WXON-TV and the local affiliate of the ONTV subscription TV service, Channel 20 also showed the team's games from 1981 to 1983.\n\nPro-Am Sports System (PASS), originally started in 1982, became the regional cable outlet for the Tigers starting in 1984, after the network was purchased by then-Tigers team owner Tom Monaghan. Monaghan sold PASS to Post-Newsweek Stations (now Graham Media Group) in 1992, after he sold the Tigers to local pizza magnate and Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch. PASS, thereafter, re-located its operations to the WDIV studio/office facility in Downtown Detroit. PASS shut down operations in 1997, after the Red Wings, Tigers, and Pistons all elected to sign-with and helped launch Fox Sports Detroit.\n\nTy Tyson (1947–1952)\n\nHarry Heilmann (1947–1950)\n\nVan
