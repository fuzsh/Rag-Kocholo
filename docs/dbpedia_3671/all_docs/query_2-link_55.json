        "text": "Southland Conference Honorable Mention\n\n2014 (Junior): For the second straight season, Thompson made 10 starts at left tackle. He was considered the team's top offensive lineman for the year. The offense started to click late in the season when Jordan Scelfo was put in at quarterback. Thompson was a key part of a unit that had their top four yardage games in the final six of the season. The offensive line as a unit only allowed three sacks in the final four games of the season.\n\n2013 (Sophomore): Thompson started 10 of 11 games at left tackle. He was an important part of an offense that set school records for most rushing and passing yards. The team rushed for over 200 yards in five games, including a school-record 396 in a win at McMurry. The team eclipsed 500 yards of total offense against Texas College and at McMurry.\n\n2012 (Freshman): Thompson quickly worked his way into the offensive line rotation. He appeared in 10 games and made two starts at left tackle, including the season finale against Abilene Christian.\n\nHigh School: Thompson was on the basketball, football and track teams at MacArthur High School. He was an honorable mention All-State, first team all-area and first team all-district offensive lineman as a senior. He was a member of Young Life.\n\nPersonal: Thompson is the son of Mike and Kari Thompson and is studying kinesiology with a minor in business administration. He has a brother, Colton and a sister, Payton. He was born on January 11, 1994. His brother played basketball at UT-Permian Basin. He is involved with the UIW Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He was a member of the dean's list in 2015."
