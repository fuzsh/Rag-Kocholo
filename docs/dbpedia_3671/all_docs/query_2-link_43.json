        "text": "Nov. 22, 2004\n\nAnnapolis, Md. - Navy senior and baseball team captain Trevor Thompson (Kent, Wash.) was one of three midshipmen to receive a Rhodes Scholarship, it was announced Sunday by a regional committee of the Rhodes Trust.\n\nThe scholarship is a grant for American college students to attend the prestigious Oxford University in England. The 22-year-old Thompson intends to study economics and social history at Oxford.\n\n\"I am shocked,\" said Thompson, who is an honors history major and ranks first in his class. \"It is just such an amazing opportunity and I am so thankful for those around me who made this a possibility.\"\n\nClassmates Jason Shell and Joseph Preston joined Thompson in receiving the scholarship, marking the first time since 1929 three midshipmen earned the scholarship in the same year. A total of 32 scholars across the United States garnered the accolade.\n\n\"As a team, words can't describe how proud and happy we are for Trevor,\" Navy head coach Steve Whitmyer said. \"Trevor is a terrific young man and he deserves this scholarship.\"\n\nThompson, who also has plans of being a Navy SEAL following his graduate studies, went through several interviews and written essays to complete the process of just being a finalist for the award.\n\nFirst, Thompson had to be endorsed by the Academy and then provide the Washington (state) Rhodes Committee a 1,000-word personal statement, resume and eight letters of recommendation. Twelve finalists were picked from the initial group of approximately 40 applicants. After dinner and interviews with the committee, he was selected as one of three finalists from his home state to advance to the Western Regional. The 32 recipients were selected following another round of interviews.\n\n\"As far as the actual process for me, it consisted of a lot of essay drafts and practice interviews,\" Thompson said of the experience. \"I discussed several experiences that I have gone through at the Academy and explained to them how it helped to make me a leader.\"\n\nThompson was thankful for all the help he received from the Naval Academy in achieving his goal.\n\n\"I received so much help from Naval Academy instructors,\" said Thompson. \"In particular, Lt. Dave Bonfili (a former Rhodes winner) devoted so much time in helping me prepare for the interviews and essays. He was incredible in not only getting me ready for the interview, but also making me a more complete person because of what he taught me.\"\n\nIn three-plus years at the Academy, Thompson has distinguished himself as one of the brightest students in the Brigade. In addition to his duties as the baseball captain, he serves as the 1st Regimental Commander for 2,000 midshipmen (there are two regiments at the Academy). His duties include managing regimental staff in the development and execution of operational policies that further the mission of the Academy. He also serves as liaison between the Brigade and its commanding officers.\n\nThompson has also served as a Plebe Summer Company Commander (summer of 2004), a 2nd Battalion Sergeant Major (fall of 2003) and a Mini-BUDS Screener Boat Crew Commander (November of 2003).\n\nHe has also been a moderator at the Academy's foreign affairs conference and led a service program for students to travel to Nicaragua.\n\n\"My grandfather always says to me, 'one page at a time',\" Thompson said. \"I am convinced that this is the way to handle life; think big, but live one page at a time.\""
