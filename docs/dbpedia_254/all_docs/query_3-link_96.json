She attended McGill for her undergrad and Master's in Education and Educational Psychology, finishing in 2012. “While I enjoyed my academics, and sitting down to study and learn, I am also very active and need an outlet for my energy. From when I was a kid, between studying for tests and writing essays, I trained in martial arts. I achieved a black belt at a young age and continue to train whenever I can. Using martial arts and other athletics as an outlet helps me focus and stay mindful during my day-to-day life.”\n\nadrienneg@willowwoodschool.ca\n\nMellissa Grant\n\nMellissa started with WillowWood in September 1999 as an EA and since then has held many roles across the grades.

I do not remember why I chose WillowWood, but I ended up helping Sheila in Grade 5. Sheila and I really hit it off and I enjoyed teaching and helping with all subjects. On my last day of practicum, I was offered a job at WillowWood, and the rest is what we call history. There were very few ESL students when I arrived, only two in the lower school, so I was initially hired as a jack of all trades. I am very proud of how I helped grow the ESL department and of all the students I have helped over the years. Needless to say, I never made it to Japan.\n\ngusp@willowwoodschool.ca\n\nHilary Rahbar\n\nHilary was born and raised in Toronto and attended York University to obtain both her undergrad and teaching degrees.
