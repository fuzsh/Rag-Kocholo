        "text": "Dyer began his tenure with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra in the position of Second Trombone with the renowned Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra in 2001, and was selected as the WSO Principal Trombonist in 2011. Previously, Dyer held the positions of Principal Trombonist with the Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra, Instructor of Low Brass at Lakehead University and performed with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago. A recipient of the Boosey & Hawkes Ltd. Prize for excellence in brass playing, Steven has appeared as soloist with the symphony orchestras of Thunder Bay and Winnipeg, and has presented recitals, master-classes and workshops throughout Canada and the United States. He has also given sackbut performances for two of Canadaâ€™s early music presenters: Camerata Nova and Consortium Aurora Borealis.\n\nMr. Dyer is a dedicated and sought-after instructor whose students have shown success in both music education and performance. Many now occupy positions as music teachers throughout Manitoba, and others have demonstrated their performance skills through winning major solo competitions and earning positions with performing organizations of local, national and international prestige.\n\nSteven performs casually with many other ensembles that include the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. His studio work includes recordings with Winnipeg artists Dave Lawton and James Keelaghan, Band of the Ceremonial Guard (Ottawa), Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra, MCO and WSO.\n\nDuring the summer months, Steven spends time working as Assistant Director and Instructor of Low Brass for Young Musicians and Artists in Salem, Oregon - widely considered the premier residential arts program in the Pacific Northwest USA."
