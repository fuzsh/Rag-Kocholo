        "text": "Great faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nFriendly Campus\n\nMy experience at Lakehead University Georgian Barrie Campus was very positive. The people at Lakehead were very welcoming and friendly. The students and staff were all good to deal with. I liked the friendly and positive vibes around the campus and enjoyed the opportunities for many student activities and sports. The campus itself was also pretty and interesting and easy to navigate. The halls were very well lit throughout the day and the campus was always clean and taken care of. Lakehead University Georgian Barrie Campus is a great place for someone who is looking for a smaller school that students and staff all get along and that has lots of opportunities for growth and development.\n\nGreat faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nThe Accommodation is Really NIce\n\nThe accommodation and mess facilities are of extremely high quality and well-maintained. The Wi-Fi access points and the library are also both quite good. When it comes to education and academics, the student-to-faculty ratio is approximately 12:1, which is ideal. For sports like cricket, badminton, hockey and football, there's a dedicated field at the university. Classrooms and laboratories have all the required equipment. To assist rural children get an education, there are a number of social clubs that you may join and engage in. If you want to participate in any of these seminars, you'll have to pay an additional fee, but it's entirely up to the student. In each department, there is a professor who is responsible for coordinating internships. As a result, they offer us internships, although most of them are unpaid.\n\nGreat faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nPrestigious institution\n\nHaving spent my years in this prestigious institution, I have witnessed a tremendous change in my life may it be on the academic front or even on a personal level. The campus, surrounded by beautiful greenery provides an ideal platform for growth and improvement. The college's placement cell also works tirelessly to provide students with multiple chances in the business, allowing them to easily transition into the professional world. Apart from learning, I had an exposure to tremendous events that go on in and out of the college, that helped nurture my talents too. The college provides with facilities like free Wi-Fi , library, labs with all modern equipment and good teachers, who use the latest technology to teach the students in digital classrooms. The college also has hostel facilities along with a canteen.\n\nGreat faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nI evolved as a learner\n\nI spent a brilliant time studying at Lakehead University. The quality of education was amazing. I cherished learning here even if it got hectic at times. I felt the process has helped me evolve as a more hardworking, curious and ready to learn person. I met people from around the world, some of who are my good friends now. The campus and housing are so beautiful, I enjoyed every bit of living here. On completing the program, the college helped me in searching for a good work opportunity and was successful in doing so. I am happy with the work I do and hope to do even better."
