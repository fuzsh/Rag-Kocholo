        "text": "1. Do you own a mobile phone and use it daily?\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Yes, but not daily, (c) No\n\n2. Do you connect to the internet on your mobile phone, either using a mobile data plan or Wi-Fi?\n\n(a) Yes, (b) No\n\n3. Would you be willing to install and use a mobile phone app to help your doctor better diagnose mental health problems and/or provide treatment?\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n4. Would you be willing to have the app collect and share your location? This would use your mobile phone’s Global Positioning System and would pinpoint your location on a map from time to time throughout the day.\n\n(a) Yes (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first (c) No (d) Other—specify\n\n5. Would you be willing to have the app record the number of contacts you call or send SMS (text messages) to and the dates and times when you phone or text them? The identities of your contacts would not be shared.\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n6. Would you be willing to have the app read the contents of your text messages to look for keywords related to mental health? (For example, looking for the use of words like “tired,” “depressed,” or “happy.”) The whole text messages would not be shared, only detected keywords.\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n7. Would you be willing to have the app record every time you create a calendar entry in your calendar app? The specifics of the calendar entry or event would not be shared, only the date and time that you create or modify it.\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n8. Would you be willing to have the app record every time you turn your phone’s screen on or off (using the power or lock button)?\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n9. Would you be willing to have the app use its sensors to try and detect if and when you are walking, running, in a car, or standing still?\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n10. Would you be willing to have the app occasionally turn on and use the phone’s microphone to record the sounds of your surroundings? This audio would be used by the app to try and classify your surrounding as loud, quiet, or busy, but it would not attempt to recognize any words that you or people around you speak nor would it be listened to by humans. It would not record your phone calls, only ambient audio from time to time when you are not making a phone call.\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n11. Consider the same scenario as question 10, but in this case the app will also detect and recognize specific words being spoken aloud by you or anyone else present in the recording. The app would attempt to recognize specific keywords like “tired,” “depressed,” or “happy.” This speech recognition would be done in software by the app, and the audio will never be listened to by humans.\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n12. Consider the same scenario as question 11, but in this case the app is also able to perform any software-based processing to the recorded audio in order detect things that may be relevant to your mental health. This processing (in whatever form) would be done in software by the app, and the audio recordings will never be listened to by humans, nor will humans ever read a transcript of the recordings.\n\n(a) Yes, (b) Maybe, but I would need to know more information first, (c) No, (d) Other—specify\n\n13. What type of phone do you use daily? If you use multiple phones (work and personal), please select whichever corresponds to your personal phone.\n\n(a) iPhone, (b) Android, (c) Blackberry, (d) Windows Mobile phone, (e) Other—specify"
