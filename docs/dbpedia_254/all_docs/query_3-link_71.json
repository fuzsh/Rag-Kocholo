        "text": "August 9, 2024\n\nImportant UTFA Updates\n\nDear UTFA colleagues,\n\nWe hope you are enjoying the summer as much as possible. We are writing today with three important updates.\n\nBargaining Update\n\nThroughout the spring and summer, your UTFA Negotiating Team has continued bilateral (direct) salary, benefits, workload, and policy negotiations with the University Administration. While we have made some progress and talks continue, the forward movement has been very slow or even non-existent on important issues. We share your frustration with the delay in obtaining the improvements UTFA members deserve. Starting on October 24, 2024, UTFA and the Administration will participate in formal mediation of all unresolved matters related to salary, benefits, and workload within the constraints of Article 6 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with Arbitrator Eli Gedalof.\n\nTo represent members’ interests effectively, the UTFA Team is committed to advancing proposals at mediation that are based on accurate, complete information about pertinent topics such as PTR processes, unit workload assignments, healthcare benefits, and housing. To fulfill this commitment, we have sent the Administration numerous information disclosure requests that are consistent with the Administration’s obligations under the MoA. The Administration’s compliance with these requests has been less than satisfactory. As a result, UTFA is meeting with Arbitrator Gedalof today, August 9th, to advance UTFA’s position on these outstanding disclosure requests with the hope of resolving these matters well in advance of this fall’s mediation.\n\nPetition in Support of York University Faculty Association (YUFA)\n\nOur colleagues at YUFA have been in difficult negotiations with the York University Administration for some time now. As YUFA explains in this recent press release, the Administration has made multiple false claims that it is facing a financial crisis and is using these claims to demand major concessions. The Administration has adopted very aggressive bargaining tactics, but YUFA has successfully organized its members to stand united. To support its bargaining efforts, YUFA is asking colleagues to sign this petition in solidarity with the 1,650 faculty, academic librarians, archivists, and post-doctoral visitors it represents. For more information, please see YUFA’s bargaining updates here, as well as this statement from the Canadian Association of University Teachers.\n\nAppeal to Support the Palestinian Students and Scholars at Risk Program\n\nPalestinian Students and Scholars at Risk (PSSAR) was formally registered as a not-for-profit corporation in March 2024 and is run by a group of concerned academics in Canada, including several UTFA members, who wish to make a difference in the lives of Palestinian students and scholars who are at grave risk, with an initial emphasis on Gaza. As we shared at the June UTFA Council meeting, UTFA Executive is supporting PSSAR in its conversations with University Administration in establishing a scholarship to support Palestinian students (similar to the $1 million in matching funds the University provided to support Ukrainian students through the Scholars at Risk Program); setting tuition and ancillary fees for PSSAR-supported students to domestic rates; and expediting the admissions process. To that end, we are meeting with senior Administration members in the next few weeks. In the meantime, we invite you to review PSSAR’s website to consider whether you are able to sponsor a scholar or student.\n\nBest,\n\nJeff Bale\n\nUTFA Vice-President, University and External Affairs\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\nUTFA Statement in Response to Justice Koehnen’s Injunction Order\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nAs you likely know, on July 2, 2024, Justice Markus Koehnen granted the University Administration’s application for an injunction authorizing the forcible removal of the encampment on the Front Campus.\n\nOn July 3, 2024, in response to the Order, encampment participants removed all structures and vacated the Front Campus ahead of the Court’s 6 p.m. deadline.\n\nUTFA’s interest in the Court proceedings has been focused on protecting our members’ fundamental rights and freedoms. Notably, when the Administration issued a trespass notice and publicly threatened UTFA members with mass discipline [see May 24, 4:05 pm communication], including termination, UTFA condemned the Administration’s disproportionate and unprecedented position, and successfully pushed the Administration to reverse its position [see May 31, 7:14 pm communication] on termination of employment (but was not successful in having the Administration retract threats of other forms of disciplinary action against our members).\n\nIn the reasons for his decision, Justice Koehnen considered whether the University Administration had made a strong prima facie case that the encampment was violent or antisemitic, and whether Charter rights were engaged. Both questions were answered in the negative. Instead, the issue was decided based on legal principles applicable to private property disputes.\n\nAs we anticipated in our submissions to the Courts, Tuesday’s ruling impacts key terms and conditions of employment of faculty and librarians. UTFA members, other faculty associations, civil society groups, and national labour organizations are now raising concerns about those impacts, and we expect more issues to emerge in the coming days and weeks following a more careful study of Justice Koehnen’s reasons.\n\nA common and immediate concern of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), UTFA, and other faculty associations is the Court’s failure to recognize that a university is substantively more than a collection of privately owned physical spaces. This misconception undermines the rights of faculty and librarians to collegial governance, academic freedom, free expression, and freedom of association. Importantly, these rights and freedoms are foundational to the University of Toronto’s own Statement of Institutional Purpose, Statement on Freedom of Speech, and UTFA’s Memorandum of Agreement (“MoA”) with Governing Council; UTFA remains committed to safeguarding them.\n\nThe Memorandum of Agreement (“MoA”) in particular explicitly protects academic freedom. The Order does not restrict UTFA members from grieving violations of academic freedom, restrictions on freedom of expression more broadly, or concerns related to members exercising related rights in the workplace. Accordingly, UTFA reserves the right to grieve violations of the MoA and University policies as necessary. UTFA’s right to grieve was affirmed in the Court’s preliminary ruling on intervenor status [see para. 10.].\n\nUTFA also remains committed to safeguarding human rights, including our members’ rights to have allegations of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian racism taken seriously. We continue to encourage members who have been subject to harassment or discrimination to contact UTFA for representation and advice.\n\nSincerely,\n\nUTFA Executive\n\n---\n\nJune 13, 2024\n\nImportant Health Care Spending Account (HCSA) Information\n\nDear UTFA Colleagues,\n\nUnder our benefit plan, any remaining balance in your Health Care Spending Account (HCSA) expires after two years. Unused funds deposited in July 2022 will therefore expire on June 30, 2024.\n\nOne way to use a remaining HCSA balance is to seek reimbursement for your past extended health care premiums, which are detailed in each of your monthly pay statements. We are linking instructions on how to check your HCSA balance here, including a link to the HCSA Benefit Premium Remittance steps.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAriel Katz\n\nUTFA Vice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nJune 7, 2024\n\nTeaching Stream Rights – Update from UTFA\n\nExclusion of Teaching Stream Faculty from Academic Leadership Roles\n\nAs communicated to Council this spring and explained in more detail in UTFA’s communication directly to Teaching Stream colleagues on March 21, 2024, UTFA filed an Association Grievance challenging the Administration’s exclusion of Teaching Stream faculty from certain academic leadership roles (including Chairs of departments and Directors of centres and institutes).\n\nDespite UTFA’s arguments that the Administration was clearly misinterpreting the plain wording of policy when it excluded Teaching Stream faculty from consideration, the Administration held firm to its position and denied this Grievance outright on March 25, 2024. UTFA has since referred this to the Grievance Review Panel for a final determination, and expects the case to be heard sometime in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in its denial of a separate, individual grievance that raised the same issue, the Administration appeared to modify its position somewhat. This time, the Administration stated that, although Teaching Stream faculty members are unlikely to be appointed to some roles where a key portion of the role is focused on leadership in research, all applicants meeting the requirements of an academic administrative position will receive consideration, regardless of appointment type.\n\nIn light of the fluctuating positions the Administration has taken on this issue, and pending the final resolution of these grievances, UTFA encourages Teaching Stream faculty members who wish to apply for academic administrative positions—and believe that they meet the requirements of those positions—to apply for such positions and/or contact UTFA for further information and advice.\n\nUTFA will continue to pursue this important issue on behalf of our Teaching Stream colleagues until the matter is resolved.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSherri Helwig, Vice-President, Grievances\n\nTerezia Zorić, President\n\n---\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nUpdate on Administration Threats to UTFA Members\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nOn May 24, 2024, the Administration issued a trespass notice publicly threatening UTFA members with mass discipline, including termination. We are sending this update after conferring with legal representatives to ensure our members have the information they need to navigate this complex and unprecedented situation.\n\nOver the weekend, we called an emergency meeting of UTFA Council (our University-wide body representative of active and retired faculty and librarians) to deliberate on this situation. UTFA Council overwhelmingly approved a statement condemning the threatened discipline/termination of faculty and librarians and urging UTFA to “vigorously defend our members’ academic freedom, freedom of assembly, and human rights.”\n\nUTFA is guided by its core values and will continue to support and advocate for all its members. This includes challenging any unjust discipline or restrictions the Administration imposes on our members for exercising their rights and/or the Administration’s failure to properly investigate allegations of harassment, discrimination, and hate speech to ensure a discrimination-free workplace.\n\nAs the current situation evolves, UTFA members should be aware of the following:\n\nBased on the language in the trespass notice of May 24th, University of Toronto faculty and librarians face a genuine risk to their employment for non-compliance with the trespass notice and any engagement with the encampment at King’s College Circle. Faculty and librarians with precarious appointments (e.g. pre-tenure, pre-continuing status, pre-permanent status, part-time, or CLTA) are especially vulnerable.\n\nUTFA does not agree that the Administration can discipline our members for participating in peaceful protest and reserves the right to challenge unjust discipline and any use of force against our members.\n\nMembers who wish to mitigate their individual risk may comply with the direction issued by the Administration on May 24, 2024, and consult with UTFA regarding recourse for addressing any restraint on free expression and academic freedom.\n\nUTFA is committed to a University that is inclusive of all and free of antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism, and all forms of racism and discrimination. UTFA will continue to denounce all forms of discrimination, harassment, and hate speech and we, once again, strongly urge the Administration to properly investigate any allegations of discrimination, harassment, and hate speech. As we stated in our letter to President Gertler, “Hate is never acceptable and has no place on campus.”\n\nMembers whose allegations of discrimination, harassment, and hate speech have not been properly investigated by the Administration may consult UTFA for further advice.\n\nUTFA stands by its April 30, 2024 letter to President Gertler, to which the Administration never replied. UTFA recognizes the diversity of perspectives held by our members on the political demands of the encampment protesters. Nonetheless, our Association is united by our shared commitment to due process and our opposition to the Administration's threats to summarily terminate the employment of faculty and librarians.\n\nUTFA urges the Administration to respond to UTFA’s April 30, 2024, letter and affirm the Administration’s support for academic freedom, freedom of expression, human rights, due process, and the right to peaceful protest. Specifically, we ask the Administration to confirm that no UTFA member shall be threatened with discipline for exercising their fundamental rights.\n\nMembers requiring direct assistance from UTFA should contact faculty@utfa.org or advice@utfa.org.\n\nSincerely,\n\nUTFA Executive\n\n---\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nThreats to UTFA members contained in Administration’s Trespass Notice\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nAs many of you are likely aware, the U of T senior Administration has issued a “trespass notice”, which among other things, threatens faculty, librarians, and staff participating in the encampment with fines up to $10,000 and discipline up to and including termination. It expressly references the Memorandum of Agreement between the Administration and UTFA.\n\nTo our knowledge, in the relationship between UTFA and the Administration, there has never been a public threat of mass termination of our members for the peaceful and lawful exercise of their freedom of expression and academic freedom.\n\nThe Administration’s premise—outlined in a communication to the student body by Vice Provost, Students, Professor Sandy Welsh, on April 28, 2024—is that the University’s lands are private property and that all unauthorized encampments constitute an act of trespass.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, we sent a letter to President Meric Gertler in response, outlining our fundamental disagreement with this premise, which remains unanswered.\n\nSignificantly, UTFA became aware of the threats to our members through reports in the media. The Administration provided UTFA with no prior notice.\n\nThis is an evolving, and entirely unprecedented situation and we will continue to update you.\n\nWe are committed to protecting our members’ rights under the Memorandum of Agreement. We are currently seeking legal advice on the best way to do so and will provide an update to you shortly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe UTFA Executive\n\n---\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nUTFA Retiree Reception - Follow-up\n\nDear Retired Colleagues,\n\nWe were pleased to see so many of you attend UTFA’s Annual Retiree Reception on May 21st.

Accordingly, UTFA has a duty to dispassionately assess and respond to any position taken by the Administration that compromises either of these fundamental freedoms.\n\nUTFA’s letter highlights three main areas of concern with the Administration’s comments on freedom of expression.\n\nFirst, the Administration’s message is an unreasonable, disproportionate, and premature attempt to limit the lawful and peaceful exercise of free expression. Without supporting evidence or consultation with stakeholders, the Administration prohibits peaceful methods of protest and dissent by invoking property rights. The weaponizing of property rights to prohibit free speech on campus is unprecedented at the University and is of grave concern to the Association.\n\nSecond, the Administration’s message misrepresents University policies that are intended, in actuality, to protect freedom of expression. The Administration reads into these policies prohibitions on free speech and peaceful assembly that simply do not exist. UTFA must challenge these misrepresentations by the Administration in real time. If false claims by the Administration about its policies go unchallenged in the short term, such claims may seriously and irreversibly undermine the academic freedom of UTFA members in the long-term.\n\nThird, the Administration’s message pre-emptively characterizes certain modes of free expression, and those who participate in it, as disruptive and a safety risk. The chilling effects of such pronouncements cannot be overstated. All students who engage in free and peaceful expression, and by extension all members of the University community, belong on campus. Hate does not belong on campus. Combating hate includes challenging preconceptions about entire groups of people that inhibit legitimate and lawful expression.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe UTFA Executive Committee\n\n---\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nCome Join Us! 2023-24 UTFA AGM Agenda\n\nDear UTFA Colleague,\n\nUTFA’s Annual General Meeting is Thursday, April 25, 2024, from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m., via Zoom.

We extend sincere gratitude to all the members who invested time and energy into the two presidential election campaigns. Articulating different visions and possibilities for the future of our membership and institution sparked vital dialogue and helped open new paths and possibilities. You demonstrated what issues matter most to you and why, and you helped others articulate their values and priorities. Regardless of what team you stood with, now is the time that we resume our work together, unified, in the face of the significant challenges and exciting opportunities before us. Over 60% of our membership voted (that is a significantly higher voter turnout than the last federal election!) and this speaks to the vitality of our organization. As a democratic Association, UTFA gains its strength from having an informed, engaged, and active membership, so let’s continue building the momentum!\n\nAs the winter term begins to wrap up, our attention turns to the Annual General Meeting. We are delighted to formally invite you to UTFA’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Thursday, April 25, from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. Register here. As always, we encourage you to write to us with any questions you may have ahead of time, as part of the registration process.\n\nThis year’s AGM will highlight breaking news from UTFA’s Chief Negotiators on the advances made on faculty and librarian housing, retiree health benefits and access to software, PTR, and the wider current negotiations with the Administration. Perhaps most importantly, the AGM will feature a panel discussion on “The State of Play of Academic Labour” in Canada and the U.S. with a focus on certification and other responses to the current challenges by faculty associations in research-intensive universities. It will feature colleagues from McGill, Michigan State, and the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), who will inform our ongoing inquiry into how to strengthen our current Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). Join us as we explore how we can redefine a relationship with the Administration to enhance our rights within a collegial context and learn more about the different possibilities for institutional governance from the panel members. Also on the AGM agenda is the much-anticipated presentation of the Academic Citizenship Award.\n\nMore details, including the UTFA AGM Newsletter containing important reports from Executive members, will follow.

Members must vote before April 2 at noon.\n\nAll members eligible to vote will receive an email from Simply Voting, UTFA’s electronic ballot provider. The email will be identified as coming from UTFA. When you open it, you will see that it was sent from vote@simplyvoting.com.\n\nTo ensure that you receive your ballot, we advise you to add that email address to your safe senders list.\n\nAny member who has not received an electronic ballot by email by the end of today should contact me at CRO2024@utfa.org after checking their Junk and Spam folders.\n\nSincerely,\n\nProfessor Susan Bondy\n\nChief Returning Officer\n\n---\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\nUTFA Election Announcement and Candidate Forum Dates\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nThe period for nominating candidates for the position of the President of UTFA has now ended. There are two nominees: Renan Levine and Terezia Zorić. As a result, there will be an election.\n\nThe President of UTFA is directly elected by the members of the Association. We will be using an online voting system, as we have for past elections. You will be receiving an email early next week with detailed voting instructions. Please note that the voting period will begin on Wednesday, March 20, 2024 at noon. Note also that online ballots often roll out rather than appear in all members’ inboxes at the same moment. Reminders will be sent at intervals of three to five days to those who have not yet voted.\n\nThe candidates' statements appear on the Presidential Election web page, for which there is a link from the UTFA home page.\n\nTwo UTFA Presidential Candidates Forums will be held next week at which presidential candidates Terezia Zorić and Renan Levine will have an opportunity to outline their platforms. The Forums will be moderated by Hamish Russell, the speaker of UTFA Council.\n\nCandidates will make opening comments, respond to questions, and make closing comments. Questions should be sent in advance to CRO2024@utfa.org by noon on Tuesday, March 19. Time permitting, questions may be asked at each Forum. We encourage questions that are applicable to both candidates.\n\nWhen:\n\nTuesday, March 19, 5:00 to 6:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday, March 20, 10:00 to 11:00 a.m.\n\nForums will begin on the hour.\n\nWhere:\n\nVia Zoom webinar\n\nRSVP:\n\nPlease click on the appropriate date to register for the Forum you wish to attend:\n\nTuesday, March 19 https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_xCWBhmyLTkSe7OGqdMjocg\n\nWednesday, March 20\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_2p-9jAsjR4KPGvR-eGdUEA\n\nIf you have questions about the election or registration, please write to CRO2024@utfa.org.\n\nSincerely,\n\nProfessor Susan Bondy\n\nChief Returning Officer\n\n---\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\nUTFA President Nomination Submission\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nWe have received a nomination for UTFA President, for Renan Levine.

This means that, at least for now, and subject to member ratification of the deal, the strike has been averted.\n\nWe extend our sincere congratulations to CUPE members and their bargaining teams. Many thanks to the 120+ UTFA members who attended the special membership meeting last Friday afternoon to discuss the intertwined issues of academic continuity, academic integrity, academic freedom, and solidarity.\n\nWe also take this opportunity to note that this has been a learning opportunity for many of us regarding UTFA members' rights and responsibilities in the context of potential campus strikes, and perhaps especially concerning the Administration’s eagerness to pre-emptively roll out some of the most troubling aspects of the ‘Academic Continuity Policy’. We will follow up shortly with insights gleaned that may be of longer-term use for our membership.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Bale, UTFA Vice-President, University & External Affairs\n\nDeb Cowen, UTFA Chair, Membership Committee\n\nTerezia Zorić, UTFA President\n\n---\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nNominations for UTFA President Opens Today\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\n2024 is a Presidential election year for the University of Toronto Faculty Association (UTFA). I have been appointed by UTFA Council as the Chief Returning Officer (CRO) for this election. The nomination period for the 2024 UTFA Presidential election opens today, Friday, March 1, 2024, and closes on Friday, March 15, 2024, at 12:00 p.m. (noon).\n\nThe UTFA President serves for two years, from July 1 immediately following the date of election. A President may serve up to three two-year terms consecutively.\n\nThe duties and terms of reference for the President are set out in the UTFA Constitution and Bylaws. The President of UTFA is directly elected by the members of the Association.\n\nAny UTFA member in good standing may be nominated for the position of President. Candidates must be nominated by either two (2) members of UTFA Council or ten (10) members of the Association. Nomination forms are available on the UTFA Presidential Election page along with Guidelines for the Presidential election which includes important deadlines and requirements.\n\nIf there is more than one nominee, election forums will be announced and information about the balloting process will be provided. Balloting will take place between noon on Wednesday, March 20th and noon on Tuesday, April 2nd. If there is only one nominee, that candidate will be acclaimed.\n\nIf you have any questions about the nomination or election process, please write to me at CRO2024@utfa.org.\n\nSincerely,\n\nProfessor Susan Bondy\n\nChief Returning Officer\n\n---\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nTomorrow, 2:30 to 4 PM: UTFA Information Meeting on Potential CUPE Strike\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nThere may be a strike or lockout of CUPE workers as soon as this Monday, March 4 involving over 8,000 workers in five bargaining units represented by CUPE 3902 (TAs, CIs, Invigilators, etc., and Postdoctoral Fellows) and CUPE 3261 (Custodians, Maintenance Staff, Technicians, etc.). Key issues include fair wages, transit coverage, clearer work standards, and better health benefits. If you wish to support the efforts of these workers, you can add your voice to this e-action, or show your support by joining a picket line if there is a strike.\n\nWe invite you to a special UTFA all-member meeting tomorrow, Friday, March 1 from 2:30 to 4 PM, via Zoom. We will hear from the CUPE 3902 President and discuss the potential strike, and your rights concerning academic continuity, academic integrity, and academic freedom, including how to respond to pressures you may be facing to reconfigure courses and/or programs and how to address students’ concerns.\n\nFor additional background please see our earlier email on “Academic Continuity” and the Integrity of our Academic Mission in the event of a strike. UTFA has been pressing for significant changes to the Academic Continuity Policy since before the 2015 CUPE 3902 strike.\n\nWe warmly invite you to submit any questions you would like us to address tomorrow when you register here.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Bale\n\nUTFA Vice-President, University and External Affairs\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nRegister Now!

Over 50% of members in both Unit 1 (TAs, CIs, & invigilators) and Unit 5 (postdocs) participated in the voting process, with 94.4% and 95.1% voting in favour, respectively. As well, custodians, maintenance staff, technicians, and other service workers represented by CUPE 3261 completed their strike mandate vote last Thursday, with 91-98% support across the various units involved. Members of both locals will be in a legal strike position as of Monday, March 4th.\n\nThe University of Toronto would not function without the vital work performed by members of CUPE 3902, CUPE 3261, and library workers represented by CUPE 1230, who are also bargaining at this time. In our Winter 2024 update earlier this month, we described the Administration’s refusal to engage in collegial governance or enforceable good-faith negotiations. Similarly, the University Administration continues to disrespect workers represented by these CUPE locals by delaying negotiations and failing to provide proposals for fair wages, transit coverage, clearer work standards, and better health benefits.\n\nAs a reminder, the money is there: the University “continues to be in a strong financial position,” reporting an annual net revenue of $551 million in April 2023. What is missing is a commitment from the Administration to engage in good-faith bargaining. This approach to bargaining is premised in part on the idea that better working conditions for all campus workers – service workers, staff, instructors, postdocs, library workers, academic librarians, and faculty – means better learning conditions and improved well-being for UofT students, as well. Just as UTFA has demanded meaningful collegiality in our negotiations, we call on the Administration to stop stalling in their negotiations with CUPE members and offer serious proposals.\n\nUTFA is proud to stand with CUPE members in their fight for better working conditions. We encourage each of you to show your solidarity as well:\n\nAdd your voice to this e-action organized by CUPE 1230, 3261, and 3902;\n\nJoin CUPE 3902 and 3261 members in front of Sid Smith Hall on Wednesday, February 28th from 4-5 pm for a solidarity rally;\n\nStop by and support information pickets organized by CUPE 3902 on all three campuses on Thursday, February 29th;\n\nIn the event of a strike on Monday, March 4th, show your support by joining the picket lines.\n\nPlease also review the note we sent to UTFA members last week regarding “Academic Continuity” and the Integrity of our Academic Mission in the event of a strike. We will be holding a special UTFA Council meeting in the coming days (exact day and time TBD) to hear from the lead negotiators from CUPE 3902 and discuss issues surrounding academic continuity, academic integrity, and academic freedom. Stay tuned for more information.\n\nWith so many employee groups in the heat of negotiations at the same time, this is a vital moment for us to stand together.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJeff Bale\n\nUTFA Vice-President, University and External Affairs\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nPotential CUPE Strike: “Academic Continuity” and the Integrity of our Academic Mission\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nAs you likely know, there may be a strike or lockout involving CUPE 3902 Unit 1 (generally known as the TA unit) and Unit 4 (St. Michael’s College contract academic instructors) in early March at the University of Toronto. The senior Administration has already been holding meetings with some of our members, and indicating that “Academic Continuity” measures should be implemented by faculty and librarians should a labour disruption occur.\n\nFaculty and librarians have been reaching out to us with serious concerns about the communications coming from senior Administration. The UTFA Executive shares these concerns.\n\nIn the lead-up to or during a strike or lockout, our members (including program directors, coordinators, and chairs) may come under pressure or feel that they have little choice but to reconfigure courses and/or programs to ensure ‘academic continuity.’ UTFA will not accept pressure by or on behalf of the Administration on UTFA members to reconfigure or otherwise significantly alter their courses (or, in the case of librarians, professional practice) or those of striking instructors in ways that undermine the autonomy of faculty, librarians, and other course instructors or the academic integrity of courses and programs.\n\nUTFA values student learning and well-being. We believe that changing course structures, goals, and policies under external pressure is not fair to students, nor does it serve the integrity of academic programs or our educational mission. These principles are best served by maintaining the integrity of our course designs and teaching practices.\n\nSome of our members may have a well-intentioned desire to minimize the impact of a work stoppage on students. Others will feel that strikes are a necessary disruption to achieve sustained improvements to conditions of learning and work and that it is our responsibility as faculty and librarians to stand in solidarity with striking CUPE members. Whatever your perspective on the potential strike or lockout may be, it is important to understand that, for academic freedom to be upheld, the discretion to decide whether and what changes to courses may need to be made during a disruption must remain in the hands of faculty/librarians/other instructors.\n\nWe also note that UTFA and the Administration are currently in mediated negotiations seeking to update the Academic Continuity policy, via the weaker “second track” within our Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). (For an explanation of our unwieldy multi-track bargaining system, see here.) While we have been pressing for significant changes to the Policy since before the 2015 CUPE strike, the fact that UTFA is uncertified has historically hindered our ability to protect academic freedom and other rights whenever the Administration chooses to declare or even to merely anticipate a potential academic disruption.\n\nWe will be providing further updates soon and as events unfold. Please do not hesitate to write to us at faculty@utfa.org with any questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\nOn behalf of the UTFA Executive\n\n---\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nWinter 2024 Update to Members\n\nGreetings, colleagues,\n\nWe hope you are as well as can be expected and that the Winter term has established a good rhythm. It has been a very busy time at UTFA since we last wrote.

We are communicating these updates to you in the hope that you will join us in undertaking the important work ahead. We will also begin issuing more regular updates on bargaining via email and on the UTFA website. Your engagement and support for our efforts to advance our shared interests fuels all of our bargaining and advocacy work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTerezia Zorić and Ariel Katz\n\nCo-Chief Negotiators, on behalf of the UTFA Negotiating Team\n\n---\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nToday's Salary Increase - We Earned It!\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nAs you are likely aware, today - November 28th - is the day that most of you should receive your long-awaited across-the-board (ATB) 7% pay increase. (Note that the Administration first proposed 0%, and then 1.75% in bargaining.) We invite you to join us in marking the important work of your UTFA 2020-2023 Negotiating Team, who fought hard against the effects of the unconstitutional Bill 124 (and the Administration’s proposals) to get back on track toward catching up with inflation. This increase is in addition to the 3% ATB increases previously achieved in bargaining with the Administration, resulting in a cumulative total of 10% ATB (as compared to the Administration’s proposed 4.75% cumulative ATB) for the 2020-2023 Agreement.\n\nIn recent discussions with the Administration, UTFA insisted that the Administration provide you with transparent information about your salary calculations, including how your retroactive pay amount was determined. Despite our entreaties that they provide a clear means of accounting, the Administration insisted that your November pay statement would already be simple and intuitive to understand.\n\nWe advised the Administration that it is difficult for UTFA members to verify the accuracy of the calculations, including their gross retroactive payment amount. Neither the salary letter nor the pay statement includes the gross retroactive amount (only the net retroactive amount), and there are no details provided for members to confirm the retroactive amount. We have not yet seen how pension increases, due in February for retired faculty and librarians who were still employed in the 2022-2023 academic year, will be calculated.\n\nWhile we can assure you that we will continue to push for the clarity you deserve, the Administration has asked us to suggest that you bring your questions to your unit’s Business Officer for clarification; we would add that, if you are not able to resolve your concerns that way, to please write to UTFA.\n\nFinally, as mentioned above, we are currently bargaining with the Administration for our next agreement commencing July 1, 2023. Our Team opened this round of negotiations in September with proposals geared specifically toward cultivating more collaborative and collegial relations at the bargaining table. However, we (acutely!) feel the limits of the tools provided to us in our Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). In a separate communication to follow, we will provide you with further updates related to the current round of bargaining.\n\nAs ever, we welcome your thoughts, questions and feedback at faculty@utfa.org.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeb Cowen\n\nChair, Membership Committee\n\nAriel Katz\n\nVice-President, Salary, Pensions, Benefits, and Workload\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nPolicies for Librarians Ratification Information\n\nWe are pleased to share the Policies for Librarians (PFL) tentative agreements that will be presented for ratification to the UTFA Council in two weeks, on November 23, 2023. On December 18, 2023, these agreements will be presented to the Governing Council of the University of Toronto for ratification.

The Administration’s proposed changes to the Graduate Supervision Guidelines were initially provided to UTFA this past spring with a two-week window to provide our input ahead of a scheduled implementation date of July 1st. UTFA pushed back hard on two fronts: process and content, and the Administration agreed to temporarily pause the implementation to allow us to discuss our concerns with them.\n\nOur previous message to you did not include a link to the Administration’s proposed Graduate Supervision Guidelines. We were reluctant to disseminate a document that the Administration provided to us because we hoped it would have changed substantively before it was published and implemented. However, we understand that the senior Administration has been sharing the document widely with other academic administrators and they have not demonstrated that any wide, meaningful, and collegial consultation with faculty members as a whole would take place prior to any implementation. We are thus sharing it with you now, and encourage you to read the proposed Guidelines here, along with the notes we have provided below. After you have read these, please feel free to share any comments, concerns, or suggestions with us (at faculty@utfa.org), and also, if you wish, with your graduate unit or the School of Graduate Studies.\n\nUTFA underscores its commitment to ensuring graduate students receive faculty supervision that is effective, caring, equitable, and supportive. For many of us, our mentoring relationships with graduate students are a cornerstone of our work as scholars. However, we have serious concerns about the proposed Guidelines. As you read them, you may wish to consider some of the issues that several faculty colleagues have already raised with UTFA, some of which we describe below.\n\nUnlike the existing Guidelines, whose stated purpose is to “assist you in creating a rewarding graduate experience for both your students and yourself,” the proposed Guidelines appear to establish a binding University-wide set of minimum expectations and responsibilities for individual faculty members, and contemplate an additional layer of unit-specific requirements.\n\nThe proposed Guidelines also purport to “operationalize” an aspect of our responsibility for teaching under the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). Thus, instead of serving as a resource designed to help instructors, the proposed Guidelines apparently alter what is expected of graduate supervisors with potentially serious implications for those who, in the eyes of the Administration, fall short. As drafted, the proposed Guidelines could open the door to complaints, investigations, disciplinary action, or denial of promotion, tenure, or continuing status, on the basis of a failure to comply with broad and vaguely-defined standards that are lacking definition or common understanding, or are dependent on highly subjective feelings, views, or assessments. Even more worrisome is the fact that these proposed Guidelines are also lacking in guarantees of procedural fairness to ensure that complaints against faculty for allegedly falling short of their new obligations would be handled fairly. The senior Administration has provided UTFA with conflicting answers about whether the proposed Guidelines are intended to be used only as a resource to describe best practices for self-improvement or whether the Guidelines could be invoked and relied upon during tenure and promotion reviews, disciplinary action, and other high stakes purposes.\n\nIn addition to these concerns about the proposed Guidelines as a whole, some of their specific provisions are worrisome. For example, graduate supervisors are already prohibited by law and under existing policies from discriminating against or harassing their students, but Section 2.3 of the proposed Guidelines purports to create a much broader duty, requiring faculty “to cultivate a teaching, learning, and working environment that is free from discrimination and harassment, where everyone shares a sense of belonging, is treated with respect, and is able to fully participate” (italics added). The kind of environment described here is important, but is not solely within the graduate supervisor’s control; responsibility for this also rests with the Administration (its structures, systems, processes, and staff), and is dependent on the students and their responsibilities within that environment as well. Holding graduate supervisors solely responsible for creating something as amorphous as a “sense of belonging,” and potentially applying serious consequences to the failure to do so, is palpably unreasonable and unfair.\n\nSimilarly, Section 2.4 (“Promoting Wellness”) requires instructors “to promote a culture of caring.” Terms such as ‘wellness’ or ‘culture of caring’ and a desire to promote them may be positive aspirations, but in the absence of a shared meaning for these concepts among our (beautifully) diverse faculty complement and a shared understanding of how “success” in these areas may be measured, it is unclear how these requirements can be met–or how a professor might defend against the accusation of failing to meet this new, vague, overly-broad, requirement.\n\nLikewise, Section 3.14 outlines that faculty are to “encourage and facilitate professional success, networking opportunities, and relationship-building within and beyond academia.” But, what does that look like? Wouldn’t this expectation vary dramatically based on the field in question (e.g., urban planning vs. classics) and potentially by the advisors’ own work and biography? Could international faculty new to the local context be penalized for not having a broad, local, non-academic network, for example?\n\nMoreover, nowhere do the proposed Guidelines account for workload implications. It is important to note that there are significant differences in the way graduate supervision is treated in Unit Workload Policies across the University: some departments clearly account for graduate supervision within faculty members’ workload (for example, by treating each student supervision as a portion of a course) while other units treat supervision as something that is done over and above faculty members’ regular teaching load. While there may be unit- or discipline-specific reasons for these disparities, it would make sense for the Administration and UTFA to negotiate some minimum standards for this in advance of new requirements being implemented related to that work, or at the very least to ensure each Unit Workload Committee reconsiders its approach to graduate supervision-related workload in a fully informed way.\n\nLastly, when reading the proposed Guidelines, you might notice that the faculty graduate supervisor is responsible for 28 bullet points, departments are responsible for 19, and the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) is now responsible for only 6. Even if these proposed Guidelines had been properly negotiated with UTFA and the offloading of such a broad set of responsibilities to individual graduate supervisors could be justified, it would still be true that not all faculty members are equally endowed with the capacity (within their current workload, for example) or resources to comply with such requirements, nor are departments and other units comparably resourced across the University to support this work.\n\nAgain, we invite you to let us know what you think of the proposed Guidelines by writing to us at faculty@utfa.org.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSherri Helwig\n\nVice-President, Grievances\n\nAriel Katz\n\nVice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload (SBPW)\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nPresident\n\n---\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\nJoin us at the Retiree UTFA Town Hall on November 8 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nThis email contains three main items:\n\nAn invitation to our Retirees Bargaining Town Hall.

Questions may be sent in advance when you register, or be raised, time permitting, at the Town Hall.\n\nWednesday, November 8, 2:00 – 3:00 p.m. Via Zoom - Register here.\n\n2. UTFA’s Executive Summary of Arbitrator Gedalof’s arbitration award\n\nAs promised, please click here for an Executive Summary of Arbitrator Eli Gedalof’s arbitration award issued on September 6, 2023. The Executive Summary provides an overview of the arguments made by both UTFA and the Administration with respect to salary, workload, and the impact of our Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)—the agreement that delimits the interventions an arbitrator can make in areas like salary and workload. It also provides a focused look at Arbitrator Gedalof’s assessments of these arguments and reasons for the award.\n\n3. How you will be benefit from the award, and how and when it will be implemented\n\nUTFA continues to advocate that the Administration equitably implement the award, particularly with respect to the 7% salary increase. When UTFA met with the Administration in bargaining, we insisted that all our members receive equitable pay increases following the arbitration award. We are very pleased to confirm that our efforts proved successful insofar as the Administration has now agreed that all faculty and librarians appointed on and after July 1, 2022, including those appointed on July 1, 2023, will receive the additional 7% ATB adjustment retroactive to their start dates. Additionally, members who retired effective July 1, 2023, will receive retroactive compensation to July 1, 2022, as well as an increase to their pension.\n\nWe look forward to meeting with you soon!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTerezia Zorić, UTFA President & Negotiating Team Co-Chief Negotiator\n\nAriel Katz, UTFA Vice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions and Workload & Negotiating Team Co-Chief Negotiator\n\nDeborah Cowen, Chair, UTFA Membership Committee\n\n---\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nUofT Student & Labour Unions, Librarians & Faculty Stand Together for Academic Freedom\n\nUnited in our resolve to uphold the right of each and all of us to speak freely about world events, the undersigned member organizations of University of Toronto Employees’ Associations and Unions call on the senior Administration of the University of Toronto to affirm this right and retract statements made by the Vice-President and Principal Gillespie of UTM and Arts and Science Dean Woodin that put this right in question. Their statements asserted, without any basis, that student unions can only legitimately express positions that are supported by their “full membership”. These statements stand in direct contradiction to the individual and collective rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association, and academic freedom as clearly articulated in the University’s Statement of Institutional Purpose, Statement on Freedom of Speech, Statement on Prohibited Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment, Policy on Open, Accessible and Democratic Autonomous Student Organizations, and Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Toronto and the University of Toronto Faculty Association.\n\nWe further call on the senior Administration to demand that Minister Dunlop retract her statements in the Ontario Legislature on October 17 castigating UofT students and scholars for exercising their rights and mischaracterizing the content of their statements, and that she issue a personal apology to each of the individuals she named.\n\nAs President Gertler emphasized in his statement from October 18, 2023, universities are first and foremost places where contending and competing views engage with one another. It is our collective duty to ensure that such perspectives, so long as they are lawful, continue to be heard, even if they are uncomfortable or even upsetting. This collective duty is meaningless if it does not apply in times of war and if it applies less than fully to those who express solidarity with Palestine.\n\nUTMSU\n\nASSU\n\nUTFA\n\nSCSU\n\nCUPE 1230\n\nCUPE 1281\n\nCUPE 2484\n\nCUPE 3261\n\nCUPE 3902\n\nUSW 1998\n\n---\n\nOctober 18, 2023\n\nUTFA Statement in Defence of Academic Freedom\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nWe mourn the loss of life in Israel/Palestine over the past two weeks and over many decades, and we strongly condemn all attacks on civilians in contravention of international law. We also extend our heartfelt compassion and solidarity to all members of our community who are grieving. No statement can adequately convey our collective horror, nor can it capture the depth of our members’ feelings. We commend our colleagues who are supporting each other and demonstrating leadership amid all of the rage, sorrow, and heartbreak.\n\nWe are an academic community. As its Statement of Institutional Purpose powerfully affirms, our University is\n\ndedicated to fostering an academic community in which the learning and scholarship of every member may flourish, with vigilant protection for individual human rights, and a resolute commitment to the principles of equal opportunity, equity and justice.\n\nWithin the unique university context, the most crucial of all human rights are the rights of freedom of speech, academic freedom, and freedom of research. And we affirm that these rights are meaningless unless they entail the right to raise deeply disturbing questions and provocative challenges to the cherished beliefs of society at large and of the university itself.\n\nIt is this human right to radical, critical teaching and research with which the University has a duty above all to be concerned; for there is no one else, no other institution and no other office, in our modern liberal democracy, which is the custodian of this most precious and vulnerable right of the liberated human spirit.\n\nProtecting the ‘most crucial’ rights of freedom of speech, academic freedom, and freedom of research, and the right to raise disturbing questions and provocative challenges to cherished beliefs that they entail, is all the more important in times of crisis.\n\nIn this heated context, UTFA members holding diverse perspectives are reporting harassment. Indigenous faculty and faculty of colour have been singled out in the national press for their public comments in support of Palestinians, and as a result have endured death threats, demands to senior Administration that they be fired, and other forms of harassment. Some UTFA members have had to engage with Campus Safety for their protection. Jewish and other faculty are reporting increased antisemitic hate speech on social media. In every case, we recognize that the goal of this harassment is to intimidate and to silence, and thereby to restrict academic freedom.\n\nThe University of Toronto Faculty Association is unwavering in its support for all faculty, librarians, students, other members of our scholarly communities who speak up about the current war in Palestine/Israel, and all who offer their scholarly expertise. It is not only a right, but also a duty for scholars to bring their expertise and varied perspectives to the most contested conversations, including about human rights, terrorism, colonialism, genocide, and international law.\n\nWe encourage any UTFA member experiencing harassment or attempts to limit their academic freedom to contact advice@utfa.org. UTFA will vigorously defend and represent all members who face improper treatment regarding their employment, including violations of their academic freedom rights, by ensuring the Administration honour the commitments and procedures as outlined in the Statement on Prohibited Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment and the grievance procedures in the Memorandum of Agreement. If you are experiencing an immediate concern about your safety, you may contact Campus Safety at 416-978-2222.\n\nWe call on academic units, deans and principals, and other senior Administration (1) to immediately denounce all forms of public harassment and intimidation to which some UTFA members have been subject; (2) to ensure procedural fairness in dealing with all complaints against students, staff, UTFA members, and other individuals and groups in our community; and (3) to reaffirm the University’s commitment to academic freedom, as expressed in the Statement of Institutional Purpose cited above.\n\nWe are a community of educators and scholars. We have a special duty to help deepen understanding, to approach differences as an opportunity for learning, and to create spaces for this vital dialogue. Anti-Palestinian racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and any other form of racism or discrimination have no place on our campus. It is the duty of every member of our community to ensure that our campus is an affirming and inclusive place to learn and work, for there is “no other institution and no other office…which is the custodian of this most precious and vulnerable right of the liberated human spirit.”\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe UTFA Executive\n\n---\n\nOctober 5, 2023\n\nConcerning Changes to Graduate Student Supervision\n\nDear UTFA colleagues,\n\nAfter sharing this information with UTFA Council representatives last week, we are writing to alert the full membership about significant – and worrisome – changes the Administration is proposing with respect to graduate student supervision. Also worrisome is the fact that there has been virtually no collegial dialogue, or even meaningful consultation, with faculty members prior to this major re-write of our obligations as faculty members to our graduate students.\n\nMany of the specific changes in the proposed Graduate Supervision Guidelines are ill-defined and problematic and, overall, represent a significant downloading of responsibilities from the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) and departments/units onto individual faculty members. This is happening without any additional accounting of, or compensation for, the increased workload. UTFA is also concerned about the Guidelines being used within assessment processes for PTR (merit pay), promotion, tenure, continuing status, and continuing appointment, and the potential of our members being subjected to investigation and discipline when the guidelines are not followed to the Administration’s satisfaction – as, notably, there are no meaningful procedural fairness (due process) protections in the current or proposed Guidelines. Also concerning is the Administration’s unwillingness to negotiate these Guidelines with UTFA despite the fact that implementing them would have the effect of unilaterally modifying a section of our negotiated Memorandum of Agreement (MoA).\n\nUTFA underscores its commitment as a faculty association to ensuring graduate students receive faculty supervision that is effective, caring, equitable, and supportive. Indeed, we could support the co-creation (with faculty and their elected representatives) of best practices that could be used by graduate supervisors for formative purposes. Our objection is to the Administration’s unilateral process of imposing new Guidelines, particularly after the current Guidelines, which were adopted only five years ago and whose stated purpose is only “to assist you in creating a rewarding graduate experience for both your students and yourself,” already appear to be evolving into formal expectations and responsibilities of UTFA members with disciplinary consequences.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Administration has created a new document, called “Guidelines for Graduate Student Supervision and Mentoring” to replace the current “Supervision Guidelines for Faculty.” The intent of the new proposed Guidelines is stated this way in the introduction:\n\n[...] they operationalize the responsibility of faculty members to have ‘fair and ethical dealings with students,’ as set out in [Article 5] section 2(a) of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the University of Toronto and the University of Toronto Faculty Association.\n\nThis statement not only mischaracterizes what the MoA actually says, but it also demonstrates that these proposed Guidelines are intended to supplant negotiated MOA wording (that was intentionally broad, general, and non-operationalized) with a detailed set of newly assigned responsibilities.\n\nThe Administration also does not intend to negotiate these new responsibilities with UTFA: they sent the proposed Guidelines to UTFA for “review and feedback” as the last stage in their process, and gave UTFA a short, two-week window to review, discuss, consult, and respond before they intended to implement them. This is not the same as full, collegial governance. Indeed, UTFA will continue to challenge the senior Administration’s apparent belief that “collegial governance” means that they do the governance while we accept it collegially. Ultimately, UTFA was able to engage the Administration in discussion and to delay implementation, for now, as discussions continue. UTFA is committed to ensuring that whatever changes may be implemented best support graduate students and are properly negotiated between us and the Administration.\n\nThese proposed Guidelines are a serious, consequential matter for us as faculty members. Please feel free to write to faculty@utfa.org if you wish to share your feedback with us about the current Guidelines (or the imposition of new Guidelines), including any concerns you may wish to raise with UTFA about the reasonableness of expectations or of the workload implications.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSherri Helwig\n\nVice-President, Grievances\n\nAriel Katz\n\nVice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload (SBPW)\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nPresident\n\n---\n\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nMore info on our award, good news, and Town Hall invitation\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nThis email contains three main items:\n\nA link to UTFA’s Executive Summary of Arbitrator Eli Gedalof’s recent award.\n\nAn update on who will benefit from the award and how it will be implemented.\n\nAn invitation to our Bargaining Town Halls.

When UTFA met with the Administration early last week, we conveyed our firm expectation that all our members receive equitable pay increases following the arbitration award. We are very pleased to confirm that our efforts proved successful insofar as the Administration has now agreed that all faculty and librarians appointed on and after July 1, 2022, including those appointed on July 1, 2023, will receive the additional 7% ATB adjustment retroactive to their start dates. It has also been confirmed that members who resigned between July 1, 2022, and September 6, 2023, will receive retroactive compensation. Additionally, members who retired effective July 1, 2023, will receive retroactive compensation as well as an increase to their pension. We have yet to receive confirmation from the Administration of the salary increase for our members on approved leaves during the academic year 2022-2023 or on unpaid leaves now. We are pressing the Administration to provide timely answers to UTFA and to confirm the broadest possible application of the pay increase for our members. We hope to have more information for you very soon and will write with further updates as they become available.\n\nPlease RSVP below to attend one of our interactive Town Halls.

The payment will include the across-the-board (ATB) increase, retroactive to July 1, 2022, and additional merit pay (PTR) retroactive to July 1, 2023, following an increase to the PTR breakpoints and increments by 7%. (We will write under separate cover about the implementation of overload stipend increases.)\n\nWe will be sharing a more detailed analysis of the arbitration award in the coming days - stay tuned!

We are pleased to announce that Arbitrator Eli Gedalof has issued his arbitration award.\n\nUTFA was successful in achieving a 7% Across-The-Board (ATB) pay increase (the Administration proposed 1.75%). This increase is in addition to the 3% ATB increases already achieved during the three years of the 2020-2023 Agreement with the Administration, resulting in a cumulative total of 10% ATB. The 7% ATB increase is retroactive to July 1, 2022. We have already approached the Administration to advocate for the earliest possible implementation of the award. We will provide an update on this as soon as we hear back from the Administration.\n\nIn addition to the ATB pay increase, other elements of the award include:\n\nIncrease to the Per Course Stipend (overload course rate) by 7% in addition to the 1% already received, retroactive to July 1, 2022;\n\nWorkload:\n\nAmending Article 4.2 of the Workload Policy (WLPP), by recognizing the level and/or hours of technical and/or pedagogical support for teaching as a relevant factor in considering workload.\n\nRequiring all units to prepare an Annual Workload Document on an annual basis. The Document will provide greater transparency around assigned workloads within the unit with respect to teaching, service, mode of delivery, class size, TA support, and course release (subject to any confidential accommodation agreements). Annual Unit Workload Documents are to be shared with all members of the unit and with UTFA by June 30 of each year.\n\nThe award does not grant:\n\nAny of UTFA’s other proposals addressing untransparent, excessive, and inequitable workloads. Arbitrator Gedalof characterized our proposals as constituting a significant alteration to the status quo, which, within the framework of our MoA, is ill-suited to positive resolution via interest arbitration.\n\nPTR increment increases for work done in the July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, salary year. Arbitrator Gedalof sided with the University Administration in agreeing that he did not have jurisdiction to award the PTR increase. He explained that the structure of our MoA prevented him from awarding PTR increases beyond the third year of the Agreement.\n\nFreeze provisions to protect the terms and conditions of employment of our members between negotiated agreements (e.g., so that the Administration cannot unilaterally withhold salary or benefit entitlements from faculty and librarians, as it did with our July 1, 2020 PTR increases). Arbitrator Gedalof emphasized that although freeze provisions are “an integral part” of collective bargaining, they are not available to UTFA under our MoA, which does not provide our members with the protections of the Ontario Labour Relations Act.\n\nWe will provide you with a more detailed analysis next week. To continue the conversation, we will also announce dates for all-member Town Hall Meetings to discuss the terms of the award, answer any questions you may have, and hear from you about your priorities for the upcoming round of negotiations.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAriel Katz\n\nUTFA Vice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nAugust 28, 2023\n\nTroubling reports about an Amazon/U of T deal\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nLast week, The Logic published this article (if paywalled, you can also access it from here) which describes troubling conduct by University of Toronto senior administrators surrounding a corporate donation from Amazon.\n\nAccording to the article, the University accepted more than half a million dollars from Amazon last year to fund research and symposia on competition law at the Faculty of Law, and to pay a portion of the salary of a key staff member. The agreement came at a time when the sufficiency of existing competition laws to address the growing power of corporations like Amazon was becoming a live issue among experts, academics, and political leaders, and when the federal government had pledged to review Canada’s competition rules in ways that could affect Amazon.\n\nMost disturbingly, the article reveals that Amazon’s donation was not disclosed to the academic community or to the public, and further, that speakers who participated in a seminar funded by the donation were chosen from a list prepared by Amazon. It also notes that the University of Ottawa rejected a similar donation from Amazon out of concerns that the terms that Amazon insisted on violated that university’s academic freedom standards. (For a more detailed article on the University of Ottawa’s rejection of the Amazon deal, see University of Ottawa scrubs proposed partnership with ‘insistent’ and ‘controlling’ Amazon).\n\nThese are very concerning allegations about decisions at the University of Toronto, which, if true, threaten to undermine academic and public trust in our institution and in the integrity of its members. If true, the allegations would also appear to violate several University policies designed to ensure the fundamental principles of integrity, autonomy, and academic freedom, including the University of Toronto’s own Provostial Guidelines on Donations, updated in 2021 following earlier concerns about undue donor influence. They also raise serious questions about what collegial processes were followed, if any, before the decision to accept the donation was made and what steps were taken to ensure that the gift supports approved academic priorities.\n\nIt has been more than a week since the article was published and we have not heard anything from the Administration about these very serious claims. Accordingly, today we have contacted the Provost, requesting an urgent meeting to hear more about this situation.\n\nWe will update you as we learn more.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Bale\n\nUTFA Vice-President, University and External Affairs\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nAugust 21, 2023\n\nLate Summer Update from UTFA\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nWe hope you are well and enjoying at least some of summer’s pleasures as we also prepare for the busy fall term.\n\nThanks to all of you who responded to our June 29 communication survey. Nearly 1,000 of you responded and we learned a great deal from what you shared about our members’ preferred forms of engagement. We heard your clearly expressed desire to receive regular bargaining and other updates from us, and we look forward to hearing your input to shape the important work ahead.\n\nIn our latest bargaining/arbitration update (from June 19), we told you about the arbitration that took place on May 31 and wrote that we expected to receive Arbitrator Eli Gedalof’s decision (which will include issues related to salary increases and rulings on important policy items such as workload) within a few weeks. Unfortunately, we have not yet received the arbitrator’s decision. Once we receive the decision, we will, of course, send you another update.\n\nNearly four years have passed since UTFA commenced negotiations with the University Administration. That we do not yet have either a negotiated settlement or an arbitration award in hand serves as a stark reminder of why our current bargaining framework must be overhauled. As this exceptionally long and frustrating round of bargaining draws to a close, our need for more effective and efficient tools to bargain on your behalf has never been more evident.\n\nMeanwhile, we are already preparing for a new round of bargaining in the fall. This year, in addition to addressing routine salary, benefits, and workload issues, we are planning to begin discussions with the Administration about the need to make substantive changes to the bargaining and dispute resolution frameworks contained within our Memorandum of Agreement.\n\nTo better prepare for these negotiations, and in keeping with your responses to the communications survey, we will communicate with you in a variety ways (e.g. via town hall meetings, surveys, and so on). While the vast majority of you who responded appreciated the content of our email updates, many also wanted the frequency of our written communications to increase. Being mindful of your time, we intend to ensure our communications are efficient, organised, and more regular.\n\nTo begin, we will invite you to participate in a series of focused surveys, the first of which will be distributed in the coming days. Two other surveys, one about research and another about your experiences with ableism/disability-based discrimination in your workplace, will be distributed in the coming weeks.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeborah Cowen\n\nChair, Membership Committee, UTFA\n\nAriel Katz\n\nUTFA Vice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nUTFA Statement of Solidarity Against Gendered Violence at the University of Waterloo\n\nThe University of Toronto Faculty Association condemns the hate-motivated attack on Professor Katy Fulfer and two students at the University of Waterloo on June 28, 2023, and stands in solidarity with students, faculty, and the broader university community.\n\nAs details emerge, it is increasingly clear that this attack was motivated by misogynist and transphobic hate, and specifically targeted Prof. Fulfer’s philosophy of gender course.\n\nThe media narrative is already taking shape that the perpetrator “acted alone.” But we must place this attack and its motivations in a broader context of the terrifying rise in misogynist, transphobic, and white-supremacist hate in Canada and beyond. “Anti-woke” and “anti-feminist” discourses have become a rallying call for the far-right globally, specifically targeting professors and academic programs centred on feminist, queer, trans, anti-racist, decolonial, and other social-justice curricula. The US state of Florida stands out, with its ongoing efforts to remove Gender Studies and African American Studies from its higher-education institutions. But we cannot forget about similar efforts in 2017 on our own campus, noted in this UTFA statement, to establish a website “designed to place under surveillance certain kinds of academic content” by naming specific U of T professors, courses, and programs.\n\nThe attack at Waterloo last week reminds us that this right-wing politicization and fear-mongering is not only an assault on academic freedom, but it is also an attack on our physical safety and well-being – especially for women, queer, trans, Black, Indigenous, racially minoritized, and disabled members of the university community who face specific, intersectional, forms of violence.\n\nUTFA calls on its members to sign and circulate this Open Statement of Solidarity from Women’s and Gender Studies Recherches Féministes, which the UTFA Executive has also endorsed. We also call on the University Administration to specify how it will follow through on President Gertler’s commitment to “renew [the University’s] efforts to continue to build an inclusive and safe environment for all members of the U of T community” in the wake of this violence at the University of Waterloo.\n\nUniversities must be places where students can learn freely and safely, and where faculty, librarians, staff, and students can pursue their work and learning without fear and violence.\n\n---\n\nJune 29, 2023\n\nHow should your Negotiating Team communicate with you?\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nWe are facing a critical moment in our relationship with our employer. It’s time to negotiate both the regular bargaining issues as well as our bargaining framework itself–and we want to make sure we are getting you helpful information and hearing your thoughts clearly. Therefore, we write to solicit your feedback about how UTFA’s Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload (SBPW) Negotiating Team might best communicate with you. How do you prefer to be kept informed, and how would you like to express your needs and wants?\n\nTo begin, please read our June 19, 2023, Update on Bargaining/Arbitration, if you haven’t done so already. In that update, we describe how the UTFA Negotiating Team has been striving to achieve an agreement that recuperates three years of significant lost ground in our wages. Specifically, we are working to rectify the impacts of Bill 124, which has, unconstitutionally, capped our salary increases to 1% per year at a time when inflation, housing costs in the Greater Toronto Area, and faculty and librarian workloads have all been skyrocketing.\n\nAfter reading the Update, please complete our 3-minute survey on UTFA bargaining communications. UTFA’s bargaining and communications teams will use the survey results to shape our future outreach plans as we head into the upcoming round of SBPW bargaining with the University Administration.\n\nTAKE THE SURVEY NOW\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeborah Cowen\n\nIncoming Chair, Membership Committee\n\nAriel Katz\n\nIncoming Vice-President, Salary, Benefits, Pensions, and Workload\n\nTerezia Zorić\n\nUTFA President\n\n---\n\nJune 19, 2023\n\nUpdate on Bargaining/Arbitration\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nWe write with important bargaining updates. As we announced previously, when Bill 124 was struck down UTFA reengaged the Administration in bilateral negotiations for the current agreement expiring June 30, 2023.\n\nUTFA has been striving to achieve an agreement that rectifies the fact that Bill 124 has, unconstitutionally, capped our salary increases to 1% per year during a three-year period when inflation, housing costs in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and faculty and librarian workloads have all been skyrocketing.\n\nRegrettably, the Administration rejected our proposals and the parties proceeded to arbitration. In our arbitration hearing on May 31st, UTFA and the Administration were far apart on nearly everything important (as was the case throughout this marathon round of bargaining of 3+ years).\n\nOn the central issue of salary catch-up following the striking down of Bill 124, UTFA proposed a salary catch-up of increases between 8.5% and 12.75% to address our members’ losses in purchasing power (the two figures reflect different methods of assessing inflation within negotiations, and would be in addition to the 1% salary increases we received for each year in the July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2023 period). The Administration argued for a catch-up increase of only 1.7% (beyond the 1% per year already granted under Bill 124, i.e., a total of 4.7% for the three years of the Agreement). Not only does the Administration’s proposal seriously fail to account for lost wages and diminished buying power but it also proposes far less than others in our sector are receiving.\n\nIn our detailed arbitration submissions, UTFA emphasized our members’ need for financial catch-up within the context of an extraordinary constellation of factors, including inflation that was the highest it's been in forty years, the crisis in housing affordability, and ever-increasing and weakly regulated workloads, amidst three years of unconstitutional wage caps.\n\nThe Administration’s submissions were primarily procedural rather than substantive, and heavily reliant upon the advantages that our one-sided Memorandum of Agreement gives the Administration. In the main, the Administration sought to persuade the arbitrator to order minimal increases by:\n\napplying an unduly narrow and rigid interpretation of the arbitrator’s jurisdiction and of how relevant interest arbitration principles apply (unsupported by our 2022 Agreement or by normal collective bargaining practices);\n\nignoring the impact of inflation on our members and minimizing the need for inflationary salary increases;\n\ndownplaying the relevance of other recent settlements (such as the fully retroactive September 1, 2021, to August 31, 2024, 11% agreement the U of T Administration reached with CUPE 3902 UNIT 3 (which represents U of T sessional lecturers) or the July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2023, fully retroactive 8.25% agreement reached between Toronto Metropolitan University’s Administration and TMU’s Faculty Association); and\n\narguing that the Administration’s 1.7% proposed increase is justified because, even if UTFA had the ability to strike, our members would not go on strike to support our demand for significant inflationary adjustments.\n\nIf you would like to review the arbitration briefs, they can be found on our website, here.\n\nThis was an extraordinarily long and frustrating round. The whole of the UTFA Negotiating Team is to be commended for its skill and persistence over the last 3+ years. We expect to receive Arbitrator Eli Gedalof’s decision, w"
