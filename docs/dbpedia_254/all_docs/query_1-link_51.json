        "text": "In Memoriam\n\nObituaries tend to be published in local papers and may well not be seen by many of our members. Where possible, this page will post the obituaries of deceased members of RALU, and others, both for the information of members and for archival purposes. We apologize to families for the fact that sometimes we are not aware of obituaries until well after their publication, there being no standard system by which we are informed of such events.\n\nAlan Noel Hughes\n\nDecember 21, 1934 ~ February 20, 2023 (age 88)\n\nPassed away peacefully on February 20, 2023 following a long life well lived. Alan met and fell in love with Barbara Jean Kenward at university in Reading, England, at the age of 23 when they were both science students. They went on to create a lifelong happy marriage, being completely devoted to each other throughout their adventurous life together. Raised in the devastation and deprivation of World War II and post-wartime England, they married and built a life together in southeast Asia, first in Malaysia and then in Thailand, where they took teaching jobs and enjoyed life in the tropics with all of its colour and light and delicious cuisine. They immigrated to Canada with their two children, after Alan was offered a professorship, and became Canadian citizens in the 1970s. From that point on Canada was always “home”.\n\nAlan was a professor in the chemistry department, Faculty of Arts and Science, at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario for 30 years, also serving as Dean of Science. As well, he taught at Mahidol University (Bangkok, Thailand), Duke University in North Carolina, and the University of Massachusetts, and was a visiting lecturer at several other institutions. He published many papers, and cultivated professional connections, research partnerships and collegial relationships in the science world across the globe. He was a great admirer of the fine minds of science throughout the centuries, and particularly the considerable – and often less visible – contributions of female scientists. Nothing thrilled him more than to teach students or work alongside colleagues that he deemed more intellectually capable than himself.\n\nAlan loved travel and good food. He was truly a citizen of the world, having transcended limited education in his formative years to achieve extraordinary academic and intellectual milestones. He and Barbara made their home in several countries and experienced the joy of learning about different cultures and world views.\n\nHe retired to his beloved French Creek on Vancouver Island 24 years ago, from Thunder Bay, Ontario, being called, as so many are, by the natural beauty of the island and its gentle weather. He and Barbara created a happy retirement, and travelled frequently to Thailand and Hawaii, where they cultivated friendships. While Alan loved his work and treated research as a vocation, he always said that retirement was the best career decision he ever made.\n\nAlan served as Barbara’s devoted caregiver for many years, selflessly and without complaint, until she went into long-term care in 2020, after which he visited her faithfully, bringing treats and sitting beside her bed reminiscing about trips taken and adventures had.\n\nHe was a strong man, physically and mentally, with a formidable brain, an iron constitution, a skeptical eye and a dry British wit. He led a life of wide horizons, filled with exploration and accomplishment; a long waltz, danced through the decades, with his cherished partner.\n\nAlan is survived by his loving wife Barbara, son John (Julia), daughter Elizabeth, grandchildren Patrick, Alison, and Carys and nieces, nephews, cousins and their families in England, his birthplace.\n\nThank you for the gifts you bestowed upon us, teaching us resilience, independence, self-reliance, resourcefulness, loyalty, grit and determination. The echos of these lessons will ring inter-generationally.\n\nBe at rest now.\n\nIn accordance with Alan’s wishes, a private cremation will take place. Donations in his memory to a diabetes charity would be a fine way to honour his passing.\n\nJenny Phillips\n\nFebruary 21 1944 – May 22 2022\n\nJenny was a long time member of the RALU Executive Committee, and Chair of the Program Committee.\n\nJennifer Mary Phillips (née Spy)\n\nJenny Phillips transitioned from life to after life on Sunday May 22nd, and just as she had wished, at home with a view of the Sleeping Giant, her two dogs, her soulmate Brian and her son and daughter, Kevin and Jacqui and their spouses Katy and Lyndon, all from Alberta. She passed on knowing she was much loved, was safe, had nothing to fear and was free to leave when she chose. She chose her moment when briefly left alone, placed her hands across her chest and told her racing heart to stop. Wonderful! The family celebrated with a dram of her favourite Scotch, and cracked open the patio door for her spirit to leave unhindered, an old Celtic tradition.\n\nBorn in 1944, in post war Britain, she was a woman of many talents, a potter, a watercolour artist, a stained glass artist, an avid quilter, an actress, a gardener, a speaker, a singer, a photographer, a Rotarian, a Chaplain, a scuba diver, an adventurous world traveller, and a master at driving a big rig and persuading a 4WD vehicle into places others feared to drive. She was a firm but loving mother, a deeply committed but sometimes delightfully unpredictable and puzzling partner in life and a consistently conscientious family homemaker. She was the “Queen”, and her “loyal servant” tried to treat her as such, though not always obedient to her wishes.\n\nAs the first Chaplain at the Cancer Centre in the 90’s on the Port Arthur General Hospital campus, rigourously trained in Austin, Texas, in 1991, as a non denominational, all and no faith counsellor, it is an irony that she herself finally succumbed to cancer.\n\nInitially diagnosed, correctly, as increasingly bad arthritis, it was in October 2021 that it was realized that this masked the metastasizing of her 2014 breast cancer to her bones, a tale that no one who has ‘beaten’ breast cancer wishes to hear. She would be the first to urge you, both ladies and men, to remain vigilant and to firmly and quietly insist on regular follow ups. Cancer is both insidious and unforgiving.\n\nWe are indeed blessed with dedicated, experienced and caring specialist doctors and nurses in our Regional Hospital, and also within our community as family practitioners, for whom she and her family have the greatest respect and gratitude. They try to fulfill their mission of caring for their patients to the level that their practical and ethical training urges, despite the fact that they are overworked and hampered by many obstacles of hospital administrative ineptitude, including appallingly broken lines of internal communication.\n\nSeeking to become well enough to enjoy the coming summer and quite possibly some months and even years ahead, her cancer again metastasized, invading her meningeal fluid from which cancer cells are free to quickly take over every organ.\n\nIt is humbling to find the truly caring and professional home nursing and home care services of this community so readily available when needed – Bayshore Nursing, Partners in Rehab, Paramed and Medigas.\n\nShe was cremated through the services of Northwest Funeral Alternative Inc., who provide very helpful instructions for the survivor.\n\nThe family will host a joyous Celebration of Life at Our Saviour’s Lutheran Church, at 1.30 pm on Wednesday July 27th, under the direction of Pastor Matthew Diegal.\n\nShe and her soulmate met when 13 and 15 years old in a church youth group, were married in 1965 and enjoyed 56 years of marriage with all the highs and lows which a long marriage entails. They remain, in the Celtic tradition, Anam (soul) Cara (friend), and have no doubt that they will continue together as spirit in some form, rightfully beyond our full understanding.\n\nAdieu, bon voyage, au revoir, à bientôt. She will be sorely missed.\n\n* * *\n\n“Jenny’s Celebration of Life on July 27th could not, in the opinion of the family, have gone any better. People were asked to come in smart casual and even our pastor set aside his formal robe and was in casual form.\n\nThe family broke several traditions. Instead of the grieving family filing into the front row in sombre mood, our small family was wearing masks, name tags and boutonnieres, and acted as hosts. I greeted everyone as they came in the door and presented the eulogy\n\nThere was laughter and joy. A life well lived. A life worth celebrating.\n\nThe Celebration was recorded and is available on YouTube at the following link..\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tTzubKrt8Ww\n\nA heartfelt thank you from me and the family for the many comments, cards and notice of charitable donations that have been received.\n\nBrian\n\nDr. Min-sun Chen\n\nNovember 1921 – May 2021\n\nThe Lakehead University community was saddened to learn that Dr. Min-sun Chen, Professor Emeritus of History, passed away on May 18, six months short of his 100th birthday.\n\nMin-sun was born on November 19, 1921 in Changsha, Hunan, China. He joined the Department of History in 1966 and taught Chinese and Japanese history full-time until his mandatory retirement in 1986.\n\nA quiet, dedicated, and dignified individual with a deep sense of commitment to the Department of History and Lakehead University, he took great pride in his roles across the university as a faculty member and as Chair of the Department between 1978 and 1984.\n\nMin-sun received his PhD in History from the University of Chicago in 1971 and quickly established himself as a well-respected specialist in East Asian history, with many of his publications exploring Sino-Western relations.\n\nThroughout his career and life, he remained committed to expanding and disseminating knowledge about Asia in Canada with organizations such as the Canadian Asian Studies Association. In 2015, the American Historical Association recognized Min-sun with a lifetime membership for, at the time, over 50 years of continuous membership and engagement.\n\nLocally, Min-sun played a key role in working with local high school teachers (many of whom were alumni) in establishing the Thunder Bay Branch of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs (now the Canadian International Council).\n\nIts relationship with the Department of History has resulted in hundreds of speakers presenting to the university, including former Canadian prime ministers and ambassadors from around the world. Min-sun was also a long-time member of Trinity United Church.\n\nAfter retirement, Min-sun remained a vital member of the Department, teaching courses for the next 20 years on a sessional/contract lecturer basis.\n\nA life-long supporter of domestic and international students and access to education, he established an endowed research award in history in 1991 and, along with his wife, the late Dr. Anita Beltran Chen (Professor Emeritus Sociology), the Lakehead University 30th Anniversary International Graduate Award in the Social Science and Humanities.\n\nIn 2017, a generous donation from Min-sun and Anita resulted in the establishment of the International Student Lounge in the lower level of the Chancellor Paterson Library.\n\nUntil recently, there was never a public event at the university that Min-sun and Anita did not grace with their attendance. And he was always so cheerful and happy to greet everyone, almost as a long-lost friend. When visiting the department, he would always bring a printout of humorous sayings, little life lessons and advice to share with those around him.\n\nThe last of the first generation of historians recruited by the late Dr. Tom Miller in the first years of Lakehead University, Min-sun will be remembered with much affection by those who worked and studied with him. It must be said that some of us thought he would go on forever, so indestructible did he seem!\n\nDr. Balaji Venkatesagowda\n\nMay 14th, 2021\n\nDr. Balaji Venkatesagowda passed away on May 14 in India from complications arising from an infection caused by COVID-19. Balaji is survived by his loving wife, Uma, and two lovely children.\n\nHe worked at the Biorefining Research Institute (BRI) at Lakehead University from 2010 until 2015, first as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, then as a Research Associate.\n\nBalaji came to the BRI in 2010 from India; hired as a post-doctoral research fellow in my research team. He worked on a project to investigate the potential of making “biodiesel from industrial hemp seed oil” that was funded by an NSERC-Engage (5-month term) grant, in which he demonstrated that potential.\n\nWhen the project ended, Balaji expressed a desire to continue working in Canada. The value of the skills Balaji possessed were important in the early phase of screening >400 fungal isolates from the Boreal Forest for their ability to grow solely on lignin, and their ability to produce enzymes that released methanol as a by-product from Kraft lignin.\n\nBoth Balaji and Dr. Iryna Bashtan-Kandybovich (another post-doc on our team) soon discovered that 100 fungal isolates could grow on lignin (a rare feature of most ligninolytic fungi that require a co-substrate (cellulose, xylans) that is easily assimilable. Next, our group discovered that 30 of these fungal isolates produced methanol – evidence that these fungi possessed the biochemical machinery to strip-off methyl groups from Kraft lignin. Both Balaji and Iryna played pivotal roles in this discovery, and thereafter both developed independent pathways on the lignin project.\n\nDespite his research skills and experience, Balaji experienced great difficulty in finding employment in Canada, which is tragic considering his expertise could have profitably been employed in academia and the research community in Canada. Despite attempts at finding employment, Balaji was unsuccessful, and had to leave Canada, whereupon, sadly, he returned to India with his wife and two young children.\n\nBalaji was my most productive post-doc student at BRI, publishing some 10 papers with co-authors. He also independently published two further papers on the lignin project.\n\nHe was a kind, sociable person, very humble, and I never saw him display anger. He was respectful of others in the lab environment. He worked assiduously in the lab on his project. Balaji will be greatly missed by his friends and colleagues around the world; some of whom he met while at Lakehead University.\n\nJoseph David Stewart\n\nSeptember 7, 1942 – March 9, 2021\n\nOn March 9, Dr. Joe Stewart passed away at the age of 78 after a brief illness.\n\nHe was born on September 7, 1942 and raised in Texas. In 1965 he graduated with a BA in Anthropology from Texas Technological College. Joe then emigrated to Canada to attend the University of Calgary, completing his PhD in Archaeology in 1974.\n\nA year later, he joined the Department of Anthropology at Lakehead University shortly after its establishment where he remained until his retirement in 2003. As an emeritus professor Joe continued working on smaller research projects and travelling.\n\nJoe’s detailed, carefully written research provides a legacy of archaeological work from diverse areas. Throughout much of his career, he continued research collaboration with University of Calgary colleagues in northern Mexico and the American Southwest.\n\nHe also worked on research problems associated with his home state of Texas, Baja California, the central interior of British Columbia and the boreal forest of northern Ontario.\n\nHis research often focused on applying scientific methods to archaeological inference, and he had particular interest and expertise in archaeometry and radiocarbon dating. Joe was attracted to interdisciplinary research, resulting in collaboration and publication with physical geographers, archaeobotanists, geologists, physicists and chemists, among others. He was integral to the early 1990s development of BSc programming in Geoarchaeology and Anthropology at Lakehead University – something that remains rare in Canadian universities.\n\nJoe’s colleagues and friends remember with fondness his academic rigour, dry humour (often delivered with a Texas drawl), and willingness to discuss research over a pint. He is survived by his wife Debra Babcock (Thunder Bay), his brother Larry Stewart (Texas) and son Sean Stewart (California).\n\nThe flag at Lakehead Thunder Bay will be lowered to half-mast in honour of Joe on Monday, March 22.\n\nLinda Carolyn Phillips\n\nDecember 25, 1942 – March 10, 2021\n\nMrs. Linda Phillips, age 78 years, passed away peacefully at home, 278 Alder Avenue, on Wednesday, March 10, 2021. Linda chose medical assistance in dying (MAID) and was very grateful to the doctors and nurses associated with providing this service.\n\nDaughter of the late John (Jack) and Doris Mitchell, Linda was born in Port Arthur on Christmas Day, 1942. The family home was the Cape Cod house that her parents built on the corner of Peter and Dawson Streets. For thirty years, Linda’s mother and father were the owners of Mitchell’s Drug Store (now Janzen’s Pharmacy) on the comer of Bay and Algoma Streets. Linda’s first job at the age of 16 was picking up supplies and delivering prescriptions to her father’s customers.\n\nFollowing her early education at Prospect Avenue School and her graduation from the Port Arthur Collegiate Institute, Linda took a one-year special commercial program at Hillcrest High School from which she graduated in 1961. She was then offered the position of Secretary to the Principal of the Lakehead College of Arts, Science & Technology, Dr. Harold Braun. When the college became a university in 1965, Linda became Secretary to the first President, Dr. Bill Tamblyn. Her career at Lakehead University spanned almost 41 years and one Principal, Dr. Harold Braun, one Acting President, Dr. John Whitfield, and five Presidents, Dr. Bill Tamblyn, Dr. Andrew Booth, Dr. George Harrower, Dr. Bob Rosehart, and Dr. Fred Gilbert. It was a career that Linda loved, but she decided to take an early retirement in 2001 at the age of 59 in order to spend more time with her husband and family.\n\nLinda married John (Piper) Phillips on June 27th, 1964. They were married for 54 plus years before John passed away, also at home, on September 8, 2018 at the age of 93, following a 17 year journey with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. They celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 2014 with their final cruise (one of nine) to Madeira, the Canary Islands and Spain.\n\nLinda was an avid reader, enjoyed five-pin bowling after retirement and, when no longer caregiving to her parents for many years, she and John loved to travel. The year that John retired from Thunder Bay Hydro, they toured extensively throughout Europe with their son, Stephen, visiting England, Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Greece. They also spent many enjoyable land and sea holidays in various parts of the world including, Florida, the Caribbean, the Panama Canal, Mexico, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Alaska, and one of their most memorable trips, a Norwegian Fjords’ cruise up the coast of Norway to the North Cape in the Arctic Circle. When their granddaughter, April, turned 12, they took her on a cruise around the British Isles and France. They visited various parts of England, Ireland, Scotland and the Channel Islands of Guernsey and Sark where the only transportation consisted of horse-drawn carts. During that trip, they also visited Paris (Linda and John’s second trip to that beautiful city) where April was able to see and be photographed at the Eiffel Tower with the appropriate caption of “April in Paris”! Another highlight of that trip was being able to attend the spectacular Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo which is an annual series of military tattoos performed by British Armed Forces, Commonwealth and international military bands, and artistic performance teams on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle in the capital of Scotland. They also enjoyed a one-week cruise of the Caribbean with April and Stephen and a two-week land holiday with them at the Atlantis Resort in Nassau, Bahamas, a port they had to miss during their Caribbean cruise together because of a hurricane in the area.\n\nLinda was a long-time member of both St. Andrew’s Roman Catholic Church where she sang in the choir for many years and St. Anthony’s Church.\n\nLinda is survived by her son Stephen (Lori and her family), grandchildren April (Brandon and son Xander), and Mitchell. She is also survived by her sisters-in-law, Jean Mitchell of North Bay, Marlene (Willie) Adamson of Toronto, Dolores LaVallee of Winnipeg, and Virginia Phillips of Thunder Bay. Numerous nieces, nephews and cousins also survive.\n\nLinda was predeceased by her husband, John (Piper) on September 8, 2018, her parents, John (Jack) in 1993 and Doris in 2007, her brother Peter in 1991, and her mother and father-in-law Rosa and Vito DeFelippo. She was also predeceased by her brothers-in-law, Ron Parker, Bill Rennick, Joseph Pomanti, George Bird, Frank Phillips, Tony Phillips, Raymond Phillips, and sisters-in-law, Rose Phillips, Kay Rennick, Maria Pomanti, Chris Phillips, Anne Baverstock, Florrie Bird, Rita Parker, Rita Phillips, and Helen Pichor.\n\nLinda was also a foster parent with Plan Canada for 37 plus years and, during that time, she sponsored eight children, one from Ecuador and the remainder from Columbia.\n\nIn keeping with Linda’s wishes, cremation has taken place, and there will be no service. Burial of Linda’s and John’s ashes will be in the family plot in Sunset Memorial Gardens.\n\nSincere thanks and heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Tony Valente, Family Physician, Dr. M. Holmes, Surgeon, Dr. M. Anthes and Dr. M. Ibrahim, Oncologists, the staff of the Cancer Centre and, in particular, to Dr. Kevin Bezanson, Palliative Care Physician, his nurse, Sarah Yocum, and nurse Treena Bean from Paramed for their care, compassion and kindness during the last few months of Linda’s two-year journey with multiple cancers. A special thank you to granddaughter, April, for helping Linda around the house during the last two months of her illness. Thanks also to Linda’s friends and relatives, near and far, for keeping in touch with her by phone and then by email when she was no longer able to carry on a telephone conversation. Thank you to those friends and relatives who brought or sent food, flowers, plants and gifts including a book of spiritual readings, a beautiful ice candle and a solar, multi-coloured hummingbird light for the garden. Thank you to her old and new friends who kept in touch by sending her daily e-mails and kept her entertained with jokes and funny stories during her illness. A special thank you to one of Linda’s oldest friends, Sally (Tamblyn) Hagman. Sally is the Mayor of Blind River and the daughter of the late Dr. Bill Tamblyn who was the first President of Lakehead University that Linda worked for. Sally’s daily e-mails and long distance hugs always brought smiles to her face during some very lonely days at home by herself. A very special thank you as well to her longtime neighbours on Alder Avenue for always being there to help her with maintaining her house and yard, cutting grass in the summer and snow removal in the winter which enabled her to remain in her own home.\n\nIf friends so desire, donations to the Thunder Bay Regional Hospital Foundation or the charity of your choice would be appreciated.\n\nOnline condolences may be made through\n\nwww.nwfainc.com\n\nSabah Mansour\n\n1942-2021\n\nSabah Y. Mansour, resident of Thunder Bay/Shuniah, Ontario passed away of cancer on February 28th, 2021. Prior to his retirement, he served as a faculty member in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Lakehead University. Sabah attended the Universities of Liverpool, Memorial and Alberta where he earned his B. Eng., M. Eng., and Ph.D. Degrees in Electrical Engineering, respectively. Upon his wishes, cremation has taken place entrusted by the Funeral Home of Sargent & Son of Thunder Bay, Ontario. There will be no service. A private interment will be held at a later date. He will be remembered by his relatives, friends and colleagues. Online condolences may be made at www.sargentandson.com.\n\nTo plant a memorial tree in honor of Dr. Sabah Y Mansour, please visit our Heartfelt Sympathies Store.\n\nFrederick Gilbert\n\n1941-2020\n\nDr. Frederick Franklin Gilbert was born in Toronto, Ontario, on August 5, 1941, and died peacefully by assisted death at home in Midville Branch, Nova Scotia, on November 2, 2020. He had terminal metastatic pancreatic cancer together with lymphoma. Fred never did things by halves.\n\nFred was a fairly brilliant kid. He went to U of T two years earlier than normal, having skipped two grades in public school. From U of T he was “rusticated,” having spent his time playing chess, sports, and other non-academic but exciting pursuits. He completed his degree at Acadia University, which institution earned his life-long gratitude for having given him his second chance. He married Shirley and, with a young family (children Gaius and Cheryl), completed his Master’s and PhD degrees at Guelph, where he is credited with helping to name the “Guelph Gryphons.” He then became Big Game Leader for the state of Maine, with a joint appointment in Forest Resources at the University of Maine, Orono. And there, he was instrumental in starting the university’s hockey team.\n\nBack at Guelph, as an Assistant and subsequently Associate Professor, he became involved with Humane Trap Research, which is where he met Dan (Diana) who was later to become his second wife, and who brought along his stepsons, Nicholas and Tobyn. The research was part of a Canada-wide effort to identify and produce humane animal traps for furbearers. It culminated with the provision of Humane Trap standards, which standards incidentally allowed Canada to continue to trade in furs with the EU. Later, in the US, Dan and Fred worked on both US and International Humane Traps Standards-setting committees.\n\nIn 1981, Fred moved to Idaho with Gaius and Cheryl (who is still there!), where he was hired as full professor and head of the Wildlife Biology Program at Washington State University in Pullman, WA, just over the Idaho border. There, he also did two productive stints as Chair of the Faculty Senate, and served as Interim Chair of Natural Resources. While at WSU he co-authored a textbook, The Philosophy and Practice of Wildlife Management, which went to three editions. He has also written or co-authored over 60 refereed publications, articles, and book chapters.\n\nFrom WSU, in 1992, he, Dan, and daughter Alyssa left for British Columbia, where Fred joined the fledgling University of Northern BC to become its founding Dean of the Faculty of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies. Having provided a good groundwork for the Faculty, and done significant things like working with the Tl’azt’en Nation to set up a research forest, he returned to the US, to Colorado, to take up the position of Vice Provost Academic at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. He, Dan, and Alyssa arrived the day of the mammoth Fort Collins flash flood in 1997. Fred was immediately charged with the remediation of the university’s library, which had been inundated. They lived in Loveland, Colorado, at the top of a canyon. It was beautiful to Fred and Alyssa. Dan hated it, and so was happy to get back to Canada a year later, to Thunder Bay, where Fred had been hired for the position of President of Lakehead University. There, through many battles and vicissitudes, he and his staff and associates were able to accomplish much—for Fred always valued assists as much as he did personal goals.\n\nAmong the achievements under his and the administrative team’s aegis were:\n\n-careful budgeting, to allow for things like maintenance and beautification of the university’s footprint, and infrastructure and equipment renewal\n\n-a revived university hockey team, the Thunderwolves, based on a community support model unusual in Canada at the time\n\n-building the ATAC facility for additional classsroom and research space with state-of-the-art technology, and to set the stage for additional research\n\n-installation of a Cray computer to facilitate existing research and to encourage future research\n\n-supporting the student-led building of a sports facility, “The Hangar”\n\n-supporting a now internationally-known DNA lab\n\n-finalising the establishment of a medical school, the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, together with Laurentian University in Sudbury, which is now recognised as a model for others\n\n-establishment of the Orillia Campus of Lakehead University, on a beautiful piece of land with LEED-certified buildings\n\n-acquiring an historic Thunder Bay high school building and setting the stage for the establishment of a Law School for the university\n\n-increasing research by enough for the university to become #1 in Canada in its category.\n\nHe served on the Advisory Committee for the Nuclear Waste Management Organization, chaired the Northern Ontario School of Medicine’s board of directors, and throughout his career was involved with many other organizations, boards, and institutes.\n\nRetiring in 2010, he ran for Provincial Parliament as a Red Tory—the Conservatives being the party which always put money to funding Lakehead projects. He lost. Good thing, said Dan, full of admiration for the effort, but sorry for the province for not getting a politician with personal integrity.\n\nThen, he started a new career and fulfilled an old dream by establishing an organic farm in Nova Scotia, where he also joined the NS Liberal Party (we should perhaps note that he had been an NDP and Tommy Douglas supporter when he had last lived there as a student…). On the farm, he installed deer-fenced plots, built bridges over streams for the farm machinery, put in a vineyard, etc. After all, he was only 71 years old at the time. He sold the produce he grew at farmers’ markets in Lunenburg and Bridgewater. He became involved in the Alumni Association at Acadia, which has recently named a lecture series in his honour, and met up with long-lost friends and colleagues here.\n\nAn obituary of Fred would not be complete without reference to a life-long involvement in sports, hockey being his first love. He was playing until March of this year (aged 78). He also played basketball. At Colorado State (where there was no hockey), the other basketball players said he was the only person who should have been penalised for high-sticking. He pitched in a softball tournament in his last season in Thunder Bay, which the team won (of course).\n\nFred wanted to thank all those he knew and spent great times with during his life, and he appreciated all the wonderful correspondence and phone calls he received before his death. He is survived by his immediate family in Nova Scotia, Dan, wife of 39 years, daughter Alyssa, and yellow Lab Yogi; and, scattered across North America, his children, Cheryl and Gaius, and grandchildren Kinsey and Spencer; stepsons Nicholas and Tobyn and their families; and his siblings Virginia, Merilynn, and Ross. He was predeceased by his sister Nancy.\n\nThere will be no service at this time.

He will be truly missed. Born in 1943 in Mt. Kisco, NY, he came to Thunder Bay in 1973 and for 30 years taught American Literature and Creative Writing at Lakehead University. Poetry was his love, with three books published. Claude was a strong athlete, enjoying downhill and cross country skiing, biking, running and especially golf. Of all his accomplishments, he was most proud of sharing his love of golf with his son Jesse and winning the Strathcona Club Championship. He leaves behind his dear companion Wanda Drew, his children Sarah, Ben and Rebecca, brother and sister Sandy and Dusty and his friend, Ellen. He was predeceased in April by our son, Jesse.\n\nWe shall be warm by our fire,\n\nsee by light of pure beeswax.\n\nWe bow down, like the trees,\n\nwhen we cannot control.“September Blizzard”\n\nC. Liman\n\nOnline condolences\n\nmay be made through\n\nwww.nwfainc.comClement Fisher Kent\n\n1927 – 2020\n\nPradip Ranjan Sarbadhikari\n\nMay 4th, 1938 – June 7th, 2020\n\nNote: In place of a formal obituary, we were made aware of a Facebook entry by his son Probir Sarbadhikari, which is a memorial essay in celebration of his life. It is a wonderful tribute.\n\n“I’m sad to say that my father, Pradip Sarbadhikari, passed away last night from complications with Alzheimer’s. Although he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a dozen years ago, looking back at the big picture we realized that he had been suffering from it a dozen years before that. Alzheimer’s, it’s a hell of a disease.\n\nHe was born and raised in a prominent Bengali family in Calcutta, as it was at the time. His family had been very fortunate in that my dad was able to attend the best schools in Calcutta (St. Xavier’s, where I also went for a couple of years here and there), and Presidency College. When he was about 20 he moved to London, England, to attend and graduate from the London School of Economics, with a MA in Political Science and another in Economics. From there he went on to do his Ph.D. in Poli Sci at the University of the Utrecht, in the Netherlands.\n\nTrue story…and skip over it if we’ve run more than an hour together and you’ve heard the best, “How did they meet story” ever. My parents were both students in London in the mid 1950’s. Queen Elizabeth had just been coroneted a few years before. She regularly held garden parties at one of the palaces for different segments of the population. In this instance, the Queen had invited foreign students to Buckingham Palace. My parents were next to each other in the receiving line without knowing who each other were. When it was my dad’s turn to meet the Queen, she asked where he was from. “From Calcutta, India” he said. “Well, that’s the land of Rabindranath Tagore”, (one of the most famous of Indian poets, and proudly Bengali), she said without hesitation. She is a very well read person. They spoke for a few seconds then he moved on and the next person in line was up. “Where are you from my dear”, said Queen Elizabeth to my mom. “I’m from Madrid, Spain”. Without losing a beat Queen Elizabeth said, “…that’s the land of Cervantes. You and the gentleman in front of you both come from great literary traditions. You have a lot in common.” So Queen Elizabeth introduced these brown and white 23 year olds to each other. A few years later they were married, and the rest is history, as they say. They were married for 58 years.\n\nAfter completing their studies in London they moved to Calcutta in the early 1960. I can’t imagine the cultural shock my mom would have experienced. A 4’11 white blonde 28 year old woman moving to Calcutta. They lived there for a couple of years while my dad taught at Presidency College (where he had been a student before). In 1964 Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Canada, was going to open. The year before that the establishing professors scoured the globe looking for new professors for this new university. One thing led to another and my father was offered a position at Lakehead. He packed his bags and went to Thunder Bay in 1964, to begin teaching in the first term of Lakehead University. My mom, and sister Paloma, who was born in Calcutta, joined him a few months later.\n\nAs much as I marvel at my mom moving to Calcutta, I similarly marvel at this little interracial family moving to Thunder Bay. To put what they did in perspective, interracial marriages were illegal in most of the US. Schools were still segregated. In 1964 the National Guard had to escort black students to “white” schools in the US. Non white emigrants in Canada was almost non existent at the time. It was a completely different time than it is now. This academic Indian and lively Spaniard were trailblazers without knowing that they were.\n\nI was born in Port Arthur, on July 1st, 1967, which also happens to be Canada Day. My parents, and myself for as long as I can remember, have been very proud of this. My brother Prodpto (Pro) was born in Thunder Bay (as it was renamed) in 1970. My parents are the classic “Immigrant integrates and thrives” narrative. They love Canada and everything it has done for them with fierce pride. And in turn, Canada has become a better place because of them and people like them. Everyone won with my parents coming to Canada.\n\nMy dad taught at Lakehead University from the first day of school in 1964, until his retirement in 1999. My mom taught French for the Lakehead District School Board for about 30 years before retiring. He loved being a Professor, it was a role perfectly suited to him. He loved his subject matter, his colleagues, and most especially his students, or “other children” as he called them. In his 35 years of teaching, rarely did a week go by when that we didn’t have a student, professor, visitor, visiting academic, someone, anyone, having dinner with us. He truly loved all of them and nothing gave him greater pleasure than helping them find themselves and getting them on their way.\n\nOne of the most memorable events in my life was a driving trip from Thunder Bay to Disney in Florida in 1976. As we drove to Florida we stopped at various universities along the way, most notably Kent State, where the National Guard had shot and killed four students during a protest two years before that. At these universities we would check out the Poli Sci department, the Student Union building, the bookstore, and the library. I thought all families did this on vacation until my wife told me otherwise in the 1990’s. Two other notable stops along the way – Plains, Georgia, home of Jimmy Carter, who was President at the time. It was a softer and gentler world than it is now. Politics were not the ugly sport that we now play. In Plains we gassed up our huge 1976 Caprice Classic at Billy Carters gas station. Billy Carter was Jimmy’s somewhat drunkard hick brother. He actually pumped our gas. Where’s Jimmy we asked. Well, as it turns out, Jimmy Carter and his administration were playing a friendly game of baseball against the media. We went to their local diamond and there he was. We were in the very small handful of spectators so we shook hands with the POTUS, the Secretary of this, and Governor of that, the guys from 60 minutes, et al. One more stop in Atlanta to see Martin Luther King’s church. While we were standing outside it and my dad was explaining the significance of MLK, an old black gentleman in a white suit was eavesdropping. When my dad finished speaking old black dude introduced himself, he was Martin Luther King, Sr, father of Junior, and told us that my dad did a great job eulogizing MLK.\n\nAnother story that is probably true, and even if it isn’t I want to believe that it is. My parents were at a party in Thunder Bay. The wife of a local doctor was shit talking Lakehead Unviersity. She was sending her kids to an university in southern Ontario because what kind of education could you get at Lakehead, I mean, what kind of person would teach somewhere as backwoods as Thunder Bay. My mom heard her saying this, and smiled at her and said, “I know exactly how you feel. What kind of person would come to Thunder Bay to teach. Must be a second tier professor. You know, just like doctors are here. That’s why when we need to see a doctor we go to southern Ontario, what kind of second tier doctor would practice medicine in Thunder Bay”. I don’t know how that ended, but I like to think that there was pin drop silence, and somewhere far off you could hear a loon cry, before the other party goers clapped for my mom and the doctor’s wife’s face burned in shame. Do not shit talk Lakehead University or Thunder Bay.\n\nMy parents moved to Toronto when they retired and Prodypto and I were here. He enjoyed his grandchildren and his retired academic life here. He would go to lectures at the University of Toronto, and try to stay involved but his behavior became increasingly erratic.\n\nI’m going to stop here because I want to remember him at his best. He was a good father, good husband, good son, good professor, and a good friend to many.”\n\nRichard MacGillivray (Dick)\n\nJuly 1939 – June 2020\n\nIt is with sadness that the MacGillivray family announce the death of Sidney Richard MacGillivray, aged 80 years, in the early morning hours of Sunday June 7, 2020 at the Arnprior and District Memorial Hospital in Arnprior, Ontario. Born in July of 1939 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Richard was an only child raised in austerity following the great depression and the dawn of WWII. A graduate of Saint John High School in 1957, Richard pursued further education at the University of New Brunswick, where he was earned Bachelor of Arts and Master’s Degrees in English literature. In 1963 Richard accepted a position as a sessional lecturer at the Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology in Port Arthur, Ontario, becoming a founding member of the new Lakehead University faculty. These were heady days of starting a family and completing his doctorate through the University of Alberta. Richard was a devoted professor of English literature whose dry wit and ability to engage and relate literary texts to today’s world inspired countless students who passed through his lecture halls; he also proved an able administrator on various committees and governance bodies throughout his tenure. His scholarly works and papers, although not numerous, are noted for their clarity in purpose, original perspective and compelling theses covering extraordinarily varied areas of expertise. Richard was a stalwart professor of Lakehead University’s Department of English for over 39 years. Predeceased by his parents Sidney Lloyd MacGillivray and Eva Turcotte (nee McCutcheon), Richard will be missed by children Keith (Hilary), Lisa (Evan), Blair (Renee), and devoted friend and wife of 58 years, Nancy Gorham, and his companion of recent years, Betty Rumball. Dearly-loved “Grampie” to Olivia, Abigail, Maggie, Erin, Owen, Liam and Grace. Richard is also survived by his cherished uncle Everett MacGillivray, aged 95 years, of Toronto, Ontario. Final care and arrangements have been entrusted to the Pilon Family Funeral Home and Chapel Ltd., 50 John Street North, Arnprior. A service for Richard be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations in memory of Richard may be made to the Northern Cancer Fund Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Foundation.\n\n“And they belonged to that very small class of persons who still read, who have mind and leisure to find companionship in books.“\n\nGeorge Robert Gissing (1857-1903)\n\nStanley George Andrew Magwood (Stan)\n\nFebruary 12, 1934 – May 6, 2020\n\nIt is with deepest sorrow that we announce the passing of our beloved Stanley, at the age of 86 years, due to Covid-19 disease in a long term care facility in Ottawa.\n\nHe was the beloved husband of Kathleen for 60 years and a kind and loving father to his children James (Kristina), Jennifer (Kevin), and Michael. He greatly loved and enjoyed his grandchildren Anna, Zola, Patrick and Andrew and great grandchildren Lilyan and Samantha. He will be greatly missed by his family and his many relatives and friends.\n\nStanley was born in Scott, Saskatchewan February 12, 1934. He was the youngest of 8 children of Hilliard and Ethel Magwood. He had five sisters and two brothers, all of whom had passed away before Stanley died. His family moved to Ottawa in the 1950’s where Stanley attended the University of Ottawa (where he met Kathleen Kapros) and received a Ph.D. in physiology in 1963. He did post-doctoral research with the NRC in Ottawa from 1963-65.\n\nStanley was offered a professorship at Lakehead University in 1965 where he greatly enjoyed his teaching years until 1982. He served as Chairman of the Biology Department for three years starting in 1975. Stanley spent the 1974/75 academic year on sabbatical in Sydney Australia researching frog thyroid function at the CSIRO while he and his family adjusted to life down under.\n\nDuring our years in Thunder Bay, Stan, as he was known, was very active in the community, particularly with the local scouting organisation. He served in a variety of leadership roles in the district and in his local troop. He was active in camping and canoeing activities, including the yearly Voyageur’s Rendezvous which he helped organise. Stan’s other great passions were carpentry and gardening. He never failed to leave any home in better condition than he found it.\n\nStan retired from Lakehead University in 1983 after a three-year leave during which he worked on contract with the World Health Organization to prepare pesticide data sheets. He was hired by the Department of Health and Welfare and worked as a toxicologist on pesticides and later on drugs, particularly those for treating AIDS, until his retirement in 1998. He attended numerous conferences including one in Moscow which he found particularly memorable.\n\nDuring the years before and after his retirement, he volunteered with the British Isles and the Ontario genealogical societies and received a variety of awards for his contributions to their work. He also helped kindle a passion for family genealogy in Anna and Patrick.\n\nStanley enjoyed a long and full life. We have been comforted in his loss by the many reflections of those who knew him. So many of you have noted that, most of all, he is remembered as a kind and gentle man. A service of remembrance will be held at Cole Funeral Services when we can once again gather together.\n\nPublished on May 30, 2020\n\nAnita Beltran Chen\n\nDr. Anita Beltran Chen, age 89 years, resident of Thunder Bay, passed away on Thursday, January 2, 2010 in Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre.\n\nAnita was born on October 10, 1930 in Talisayan, Misamis Oriental, Phillipines.

On a beautiful misty morning, we said goodbye to an amazing woman in her 75th year after a short illness. Bonny was born in New Brunswick and came to Ontario as a toddler following WWII following her father’s service in the army. After a stay in Nipigon her family relocated to Port Arthur (Thunder Bay) where she resided her entire life. After graduation from Lakeview High School, Bonny married the love of her life David and together they welcomed the arrival of Jason and Gerry. Being a master multi-tasker, Bonny was able to participate in the boys activities, advance in her demanding career and always have time to entertain family and friends both at their home in town and at their family camp at Amethyst Harbour. Bonny loved spending summers at the lake and will be missed by the Amethyst community. Bonny retired from Lakehead University as Paymaster where she met many lifetime friends and also served on the board of governors. Even after retirement, Bonny stayed active in their retirees association serving as treasurer. Bonny continued to help countless friends and family with their tax and estate paperwork always staying on top of the latest income tax rules. Left to cherish Bonny’s memory are “her boys” Jason (Bonnie) and Gerry (Tammy) and her treasured grandchildren Bradley, A.J. and Mia. Bonny is also survived by brothers Blayne and Roy (Freda) Matchett, sisters Beverley Green and Cara Leigh Matchett, brother-in-law Fred Wigmore, numerous nephews and nieces, cousins and special god-daughter Karin Axent-Saipovski. Bonny was predeceased by her beloved husband David, parents Roy and Ida (Ted) Matchett, in-laws Robert and Helmi Wigmore, brother-in-law Robert Green and sister-in-law Laura Wigmore. We would like to thank Bonny’s “care-team”especially Penny, Karen, Melanie, Irene & Melissa, along with the countless friends and family members who have offered such support. A special thank you also to the staff of TBRHSC 1A and the wonderful, caring nurses and physicians of St. Joseph’s Hospice for her comfort and care. According to Bonny’s wishes there will be no formal service. In lieu of flowers, if so desired, donations to Hospice Northwest or St. Joseph’s Foundation of Thunder Bay would be greatly appreciated.\n\nDr. Ann Osborn Seyffert\n\nOn Monday, February 25, 2019, Dr. Flora Elizabeth Ann Osborn-Seyffert, passed away at the age of 80. She is survived by her husband Peter, her brother Rick (Saundra) and Linda (resident of Nassau). Her youngest sister Sylvia (Bruce Locke) died a short time ago. She is also survived by a niece (Beth Locke) and three nephews, (James and Matthew Osborn) and Rod (Locke), and seven grandnieces and grandnephews. Ann was born on October 17, 1938 in Timmins, Ontario to Rod and Flora (Carson) Osborn. She received a PhD in Music from Ohio State University in 1986, and pursued a musical career as an Associate Professor at both Western and Lakehead Universities, and privately as an organist at St. John’s Anglican Church in Thunder Bay. She had a passion for early traditional folk song which became the dissertation for her PhD. As a result, the famous Zoltan Kodaly, in 1970, invited her to attend the Liszt Academy in Budapest, Hungary to study his method for teaching children, which became her passion. In addition, Ann was a gifted athlete, a wonderful hostess, a great cook, and dedicated member of her church. For the past several months Ann has been a resident at Southbridge Roseview Manor.\n\nDr. George Kondor\n\nOn Monday, January 28th, 2019, Dr. George Andrew Kondor, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Lakehead University, passed peacefully surrounded by his loving family at the age of 85.\n\nGeorge was born on December 15, 1933 in Budapest, Hungary to Dr. János Kondor and Erzsébet Sándor. As a child of Jewish descent in Hungary, George survived the Holocaust with the aid of Raoul Wallenberg, who his father aided, and the protection of the Swedish government. George eventually found a love for applied mathematics and attained a Doctorate in (mathematical) Economics from Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary. He was a principle researcher for the Economics Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and taught at Corvinus University in Budapest. His co-authored book Economic Efficiency and Shadow Prices (1965) was mandatory reading at Corvinus University (the economics university) for 28 years, and George appeared several times in the Who’s Who in Hungary. In the early 1970s George went to teach in Nigeria with his first wife, Ágnes, where his son Andrew was born. It was from Africa that George immigrated to Canada in 1974, after receiving the opportunity to teach at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. In his new life in Canada, George later married Maria Seress (of Gyor, Hungary) on December 22, 1982, and their daughter Katherine was born soon after.\n\nGeorge’s passion for economics and math was obvious to all he met, as was his kind heart and willingness to help anyone, especially new Hungarian immigrants to Canada. He helped many people through charity, most especially children in need. He was known for his great storytelling of his fascinating life; his fantastic (although sometimes morbid) sense of humour; his love of children, dogs, and Hungarian salami; and his compassionate spirit. He was loved by all who knew him.\n\nGeorge was preceded in death by his father János, mother Bözsi, and several close friends. He is survived by his wife Maria; his children Andrew (Janina) and Kathy (András); his three grandchildren Evan, Ethan, and Eric; his sister Maria (known as Csöpi); nephews; several cousins; and close life-long friends.\n\nThe family would like to express their gratitude to the cancer clinic and palliative care unit at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre, most especially to Dr. Kathy Simpson. They would also like to thank the kindness and care of those at Bayshore, especially Linda Roussel and Paula. George expressed how he was overwhelmed by the love and support received from nurses and doctors in all areas of his care. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Lakehead University for a scholarship being set up in George’s name, to the Canadian Cancer Society, or, simply, help others in need.\n\nDr. Bruce Minore\n\nIt is with great sadness and a deep sense of loss that the family announces the sudden passing of James Bruce Minore in his 73rd year. Beloved uncle to Deborah (Scott) and Kimberley (Paul) and his great nieces Kelly (Tanner), Marisa and Makena and Brother-in-law to Sandy in Ottawa. Predeceased by his parents John and Mildred and his brother Robert. Dr. J. Bruce Minore, founding Director and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Lakehead University was a committed researcher, teacher, and mentor who made significant and lasting contributions to rural and remote health in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, and Internationally. His commitment to improving systems and services in the north through the Centre for Rural and Northern Health Research continues to be an inspiration to those who collaborated with him. Cremation has taken place and a private family internment will follow in his home town of Hamilton, Ontario. A Celebration of Life will be held on July 11th at 2:00pm at the Avila Centre, Lakehead University. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Centre for Rural and Northern Health Research or Lakehead University would be appreciated.\n\nDr. John Naysmith\n\nIt is with sad hearts that we announce the passing of Dr. John Naysmith.\n\nDr. Naysmith was a kind and gentle man who provided a few decades of service to Lakehead University, including as the Director of the School of Forestry and founding Dean of Lakehead’s Forestry department from 1988 to 1995. He taught for another 10 years after retiring and made many other contributions to the forestry industry. In 2011, Dr. Naysmith was named a Fellow of the University.\n\nDr. John Naysmith was recently honoured by the creation of the Naysmith Scholar on Friday, Sept. 30, 2016. A student who has completed their third-year of an Honours Bachelor of Science in Forestry or Honours Bachelor of Environmental Management will be named annually as the Naysmith Scholar. This student must demonstrate the values and principles that Dr. Naysmith embodied: including leadership, a willingness to listen, the ability to motivate and inspire others, and more.\n\nOur sincerest condolences to John’s wife, Toie, and the Naysmith family.\n\nWhile this is a sad loss for Lakehead University and the Naysmith family, his legacy will live on.\n\nDavid Tamblyn\n\nChair, Board of Governors\n\nLakehead University\n\nDr. Bill Graham. 1929-2017\n\nDr. William Muir Graham, born in Wainwright, Alberta, June 30th, 1929, died August 3, 2017 in Kelowna, British Columbia, aged 88. He was the son of Paul and Mildred (Maxwell) Graham and the youngest of four children; his three sisters predeceased him. Bill studied biology at the University of Alberta (Edmonton), the University of British Columbia (Vancouver), and the University of London (England), and was granted his Ph.D. in 1964 at St. Andrews University in Dundee, Scotland. Bill is survived by his beloved wife of 63 years, Margaret (née Barclay) Graham. They were married in Calgary Alberta in May 1955. They lived in Canada, Kenya, England, and Scotland and in their retirement travelled widely, covering most of the world. Bill is also survived by his three children, Janice, Douglas (France Marcoux) and Karen (Rick Durand) and five beloved grandchildren: Carl, Roslyn, Ruskin, Camille (José Barrios), and Stéphanie, as well many other extended family members and friends. He was a proud and devoted family man. Bill was a biologist, specializing in entomology. At the beginning of his career, he worked as a research scientist in Kenya on the behaviour and control of stored products pests, such as beetles and moths. He later taught biology at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He loved teaching – he taught us all, his children, his grandchildren, and his students. His teaching goal was to inspire questioning and individual thinking. He was committed to learning and science, worshipped knowledge and facts, and was a gifted poet, essayist, and original thinker on countless topics.\n\nBill wished to be remembered by a poem of his favorite poet, Robbie Burns “Epitaph on my own friend and my father’s friend, Wm. Muir in Tarbolton Mill”:\n\nAn honest man here lies at rest,\n\nAs e’er God with his image blest;\n\nThe friend of man, the friend of truth,\n\nThe friend of age, and guide of youth:\n\nFew hearts like his, with virtue warm’d,\n\nFew heads with knowledge so informed:\n\nIf there’s another world, he lives in bliss;\n\nIf there is none, he made the best of this.\n\nTom Hazenburg 1932-2017\n\nWe regret to inform you of the passing of our husband, father and grandfather Gerrit (Tom) Hazenberg, Professor Emeritus, (Department of Forestry), Lakehead University.

Matt is survived by his soulmate and loving wife, Beverley, by his much loved family Mark (Vicki Yaltema) of Coquitlam, BC, Nancy (Gerry Coppola) of St. Catharines, and Lesley (Rob Morano) of Sudbury, as well as his very special grandson Jacob of St. Catharines. He is also survived by sisters Mary McDonald (Frank), and Victoria Martin, brother Willis, sisters-in-law Caren Baert (Al) and Jeanette Stefureak, and numerous nieces and nephews. Matt was predeceased by his Mom and Dad, Annie and, Peter, brothers Edward and John, sister Elizabeth Preddie, and grandson Luka Stefureak-Coppola. Cremation has taken place entrusted to Le Clair Funeral Home, funeral mass was celebrated in Midland on July 5. Celebration of Life is planned in Thunder Bay for August.\n\nMatt was born in 1937 in Willingdon, Alberta and spent the formative years of his life on the prairies, first on the family farm and then in the small town of Hairy Hill. His love of Canadian prairie never waned and, on many road trips to Western Canada, one could sense his chest expanding to fill with good air as soon as we broke into Manitoba’s expansive plains. Matt left Alberta at 17 to seek adventure, and eventually ended up in Toronto, then in Ottawa dipping into the cloak and dagger in Canada’s Department of External Affairs. It was here that he crossed paths with Beverley — who recognized quality in a man when she met him and decided further work abroad could be postponed until Matt also recognized quality in a woman. Matt and Bev were married in Toronto on September 3, 1966, returning to Ottawa that autumn for Matt to continue part-time studies at Carleton. He graduated with his BA in Political Science and Diploma in Public Administration in 1968 the same year that he welcomed the birth of his son, Mark.\n\nMatt resumed working with Bell Canada for a year until presented with the opportunity for Department of Education Teacher Training in summer classes. This led to an interim contract to teach Business Education Studies at Hammarskjold High School in Port Arthur, Ontario. Matt, Bev and Mark moved to Port Arthur/Fort William in June 1969 and were soon warmly welcomed into the active social life of Hammarskjold teachers. This is where Matt made lifelong friends in the profession and from where he always had the very best memories of the “Hammarskjold gang”. Matt’s family continued to grow with the arrival of Nancy in ’69 and Lesley in ‘73. He moved to Churchill as Head of Business and later to Hillcrest in the same post. Matt continued studies during these years and was awarded Masters of Education by Lakehead in 1986.\n\nHis thirst for adventure, however, was never quite quenched. In 1986/87 Matt took his first of several “three over four” leaves to travel Europe with his family in a VW camper van and small tent for six months. For the wonderful family memories and the invaluable lessons learned about other countries and cultures, Bev and each of his children thanked him many times. In 1991/92, he accepted a six-month post at the Canadian Overseas College in Singapore, followed by a two week visit to Eastern Australia and a second six-month camping tour of Europe and North Africa. In 1994/95, he returned to Singapore as Principal of the Canadian International School, and in 1997/98 he was off to Guangzhou, China to head the first OAC Ontario Program in Huamei International School. Retiring in 1998 Matt enjoyed twenty years of active life, in Toronto, St. Catharines, Thunder Bay and finally in Midland. Matt and Bev continued to travel, visiting England, Norway, Ireland, France, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Western Australia & Tasmania, Ecuador, Bali, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, India, and wintering in southern Mexico for fourteen years. They were scheduled to depart June 21 for Panama City to transit the Panama Canal when Matt became ill. When he wasn’t abroad, Matt was busy on his acreage in Thunder Bay, enjoying a round with his golf buddies, a game with the Go-Slow curlers or following each second of Montreal Canadiens action. In 2015, Matt and Bev decided to move closer to family in Eastern Ontario and relocated to Midland, where he quickly developed a new group of golf buddies.\n\nThroughout their life together, Matt and Bev were mutually supportive of each other’s dreams and he will be greatly missed as a partner. The love and respect Matt has earned from his children and grandchild is a testament to the love and support that he unfailingly provided to his family and he will be greatly missed as a father and a Grandad. “You can always tell where a beautiful soul has been by the tears and the smiles left behind.” There are many, many tears and there will be many, many smiles as the wonderful memories crowd out the deep sadness. In lieu of flowers, should anyone wish, donations may be made to the Royal Victoria Hospital Foundation in Barrie, Ontario, directed to the Cancer Centre.\n\nDr. Bill Eames 1929-2017\n\nWilliam Preston Eames passed away peacefully in his sleep on March 7th, 2017, at the age of 87, surrounded by family. Bill was reunited after six years with his beloved wife Jane. Ever kind and gentle, Bill guided us, often without words, in the virtues of humility and humour. He rarely spoke of himself except in glimpses. So we will speak for him. Bill was born in Minnedosa, Manitoba, on September 21st, 1929, the only child who survived, to Ada Croley and George Eames. Ada was a piano teacher, organist for the local United Church and the President of the Manitoba Music Teachers Association. George was an employee of CP railway. Although Bill never played an instrument he was brought up in a house of music and had a lifelong love of classical music and opera. During the Depression, Bill’s parents took in and fed many hungry and unemployed men. This interaction with others instilled in Bill an understanding that people who struggle or face hardship do not do so out of choice and that everyone has a story to tell. The first in his family to go to university and funding himself completely on scholarships, Bill went to Brandon College for chemistry and mathematics. Here he made lifelong friendships, was the class valedictorian and was recognized with many gold medals. He found he loved the simplicity and creativity of mathematics and went on to University of Manitoba and subsequently to Queens, where he completed his PhD in calculus at the age of 24. He (and friends) also blew off the back wall of Grant Hall the week before graduation in a beer experiment that went wrong. As part of the first group of international NSERC scholars, Bill moved to London to complete his postdoctoral work at Kings College, University of London. Bill loved the city, the theatre, his Austin Healey, and his pottery teacher, Jane Coles. They married and lived in Blackheath, having two children, Gillian and Madeleine. In 1966 they moved back to Canada settling in Thunder Bay (Port Arthur), Ontario. Jane, having lived in England her whole life, loved the expanse of the land and the rocky shores of Lake Superior. It was here that Tamsin and David were born. Bill was Chair of the math department at Lakehead University for many years where he had good friends and colleagues. He inspired many young people with his love of mathematics and creative ways of teaching. In 1977 Bill and Jane opened Aardvark Pottery, their functional earthenware ceramics studio. It was a house filled with musicians, potters, art, books, photography and sculpture. The family spent many summers camping across Canada, east and west, in a canvas Woods tent, rain or shine, although Bill would have preferred the occasional hotel. After his retirement in 1993, Bill and Jane travelled extensively, doing pottery workshops and travelling to Mexico. Bill took a position teaching in Gifu, Japan, for six months where he is remembered for having donned a red curly wig and presented himself as Anne of Green Gables. After Jane’s death in 2010, Bill lost his enthusiasm for all their shared interests. He moved to Salmon Arm, BC where he lived out his last years. Bill will always be remembered for his humour, his unlimited generosity and kindness and his quiet determination. He loved his grandchildren and we are lucky they were able to know him and will cherish the memories forever. They will always have their own stories about their “Grumps” or “Dada”. He will be lovingly remembered by his children, his many grandchildren, extended family in England and friends both near and far.\n\nMr. Don MacLean\n\n1941–2017\n\nA wonderful man and friend of many “went into that good night” on March 5, 2017 at St Joe’s Hospice. Don was born in Cadillac, Quebec, on Dec 27, 1941. Predeceased by his parents Ray and Marguerite MacLean, father and mother-in-law Dunlop and Audrey Wilson, and nephew Darryl Wilson. He is survived by Margaret his wife, soul mate and best friend of 51 wonderful years. He will be lovingly remembered by his in-laws, nieces and nephews: Ron and Jean Wilson (Patricia Hargreaves, Mark and Monica), Murray and Lynne Wilson (Patrick and Tracey, Keri and Billy Willan, Jeff), Robert and Carolyn Wilson ( Laura, Erin), Darlene and Don Seaver (Apryl Krienke, Lee Krienke), Luann and Ron Sainsbury (Drew), Sheila and Brad Arding and many Sevigny relatives in Quebec. Don gathered friends wherever he went. He was a gentleman – a kind, humble and hardworking man of great integrity. He had a heart of gold; he was wrapped in abundant love by both family and friends.\n\nDon was Project Supervisor for the MTO building roads and bridges throughout Northwestern Ontario. He worked at the Toronto office in Downsview for two years while Margaret attended U of T and ended his career at the Thunder Bay office. After taking a Teaching Techniques course at George Brown College Don taught courses to MTO staff and was a Sessional Lecturer of computer science at Lakehead University for a number of years.\n\nDon had a love for music, especially Country Western music. He loved playing guitar and writing songs. He and Brian Merritt played the bars in Thunder Bay and Northwestern Ontario. While working in Kenora he wrote “Beckett’s Village Inn” – the words displayed over the bar for many years until the hotel passed ownership. While at Lakeview High, Don was privileged to work the lights for Johnny Cash who remained his idol for the rest of his life. Don was a master builder for Cambrian Players building sets for the productions that Margaret was directing or acting in. Over the years they attended many theatre and music productions; Vegas being their favourite venue to enjoy world-renowned entertainers.\n\nDon retired from the MTO in 1994 leaving time to travel throughout the world and adding many friends met during driving holidays, tours, and cruises. His bucket list was completed and he and Margaret returned to many of these favourite spots many times over.\n\nA celebration of Don’s life will take place at the Dragon’s Den from 3-5pm on March 18. Special thanks to Sherri and Nadine and Dr. Bezanson at St Joe’s Hospice for making his last journey comfortable. If so desired a contribution can be made to the charity of your choice.

Thomson (SBStJ, CD, PhD, MScREC, DPE, LT/CMDR (Ret.), Professor Emeritus) passed away peacefully at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre following a brief illness. Automobiles, Leisure, Leadership, and Community were the four corners that framed the picture of Dr. Thomson’s life adventures. His passion for the outdoors (dwelling under the stars) drove his professional achievements, from leading several fitness and recreation initiatives in his early years, to completing the world’s first PhD in Recreation Leadership, to founding Lakehead University’s Honours Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation Program (HBOR) in 1977, (another world’s first), and leaving the University as a Professor Emeritus in 1996. His call to service manifested in his twenties as he achieved the rank of Lieutenant in the Royal Australian Naval Reserves. Lt. Cdr. Thomson retired for the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve in 1991, having served as the Ontario Lieutenant Governor’s Aide de Comp during his time of service. Most recently, he split his time between his native Australia and Canada, spending his days Downunder with family and friends, and his days in The Great White North as a very active and entertaining member of the Thunder Bay Vintage Sports Car Club. Dad/Grandad is survived by his 3 children – Brennan (Lori) (Canada), Charmian (Jeff) (Australia), and James (Audrey) (Australia), and 7 grandchildren – Bennett & Sydney Thomson, Olivia & Julianne Crawford, and Liam, Briar & Andrew Thomson. Known and loved by all for his quick wit, clever puns, funny faces and sometimes ‘corny’ jokes, Lisle’s most impressive gift to the universe was his knowledge. If you were in his presence, it was likely you came away from the experience learning something about something, whether you wanted to or not. “Brilliant”, “Entertaining”, “Unique” – these are the words that best described Dr. Lisle A. Thomson. Now at his passing, we add “Deeply Missed”. A private internment will take place in Australia.\n\n– See more at: http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chroniclejournal/obituary.aspx?n=lisle-a-thomson&pid=179353540#sthash.R5EQGQIn.v4dzrIEJ.dpuf\n\nDavid Lewis, Department of Languages, 1968-1975.\n\nAnd many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.—Isaiah 2:3–4\n\nDavid Lewis, professor and diplomat, died May 15, 2015, aged 83.\n\n“Europe mirrors my life.”\n\nIf Europe’s identity is that of the old world looking to the future, then David Wilfrid Paul Lewis was definitely a dedicated European. His great passions were those of the continent’s high culture: oil painting, classical music and poetry. Yet Lewis was also a moral witness to Europe’s rebuilding. Experiencing World War II at a young age, Lewis knew that European integration was primarily a means to avoid another war in Europe. Thus, according to him, the European Union was one of the “greatest historical achievements of the 20th century”. This said, Lewis was no idealist. To some degree, he foresaw the reawakening of nationalism that currently threatens Europe. He also cared deeply about the preservation of national cultures, and the inherent dangers of total federalism.\n\nLewis participated in the European project directly and indirectly. After obtaining a B.A. Honours in French and German at The Queen’s College, University of Oxford, Lewis studied at the College of Europe, in Bruges – his class was named after Raoul Dautry, a French engineer and politician from the South of France. The College was a recent creation, founded in 1949 by the likes of Churchill and De Gasperi, along with pro-European Capuchin friars, to “promote a spirit of solidarity and mutual understanding between all the nations of Western Europe and to provide elite training to individuals who will uphold these values”. While at the College, Lewis was elected President of the Students and became friends with the Rector, Professor Hendrik Brugmans. It is here that Lewis converted from his father’s Methodism to the Roman Catholic faith and took the baptismal name of Paul.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1968, Lewis worked as a diplomat at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France. He became an expert on issues that affected all of Europe: adult education, study abroad programs, and environmental protection. In addition to creating and managing international cooperation programs, Lewis sought to educate and inform the European public about the Council’s work. He took on lecturing assignments, drafted publication materials, and helped create a European Information Centre for Nature Conservation.\n\nWhile Chair of the then Department of Modern and Foreign Languages at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, and Director of the Lehigh Center for International Studies, Lewis wrote a book entitled “The Road to Europe”. It covered the European Union’s history, institutions and prospects. A the monograph’s two main topics were the consequences of integration for Eastern Europe and the United States – Lewis would continue to think about these issues for the rest of his career. This book, along with Lewis’ social ties to the College of Europe, brought him an offer to become the Vice-Rector and head of the College’s new campus in Warsaw. Lewis accepted the offer, and postponed his retirement to the South of France.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1996, Lewis helped create and run this new institution, dedicated to forming a new generation of Europeans. At the end of the Cold War, many Eastern European states were eager to become members of the European Union, and the College was there to train those who aspired to work for the European Commission, Council and Parliament. After Lewis finally retired to Provence, to paint, travel and spend time with his wife and son, he published his final work. The 1999 co-edited conference proceedings entitled What Security for which Europe?: Case Studies from the Baltic to the Black Sea discussed the impact of European Union expansion on European security. Recent events in Ukraine have given this collaborative work renewed relevance.\n\nLewis’ conservative sartorial tastes were quite similar to his father’s and grandfather’s: suit, suspenders, cotton handkerchief. In a way, they provided a stark contrast to his cosmopolitan life-style. It could be said that Lewis enjoyed the benefits that globalization offers the higher social classes. At the end of his life, almost half of which he spent in France, Lewis held British, Canadian and American citizenships. In addition to his time in Strasbourg, Bethlehem, and Warsaw, he also worked in London, Montreal, and Thunder Bay. In his last position, as Vice-Rector of the College of Europe, Lewis’ responsibilities included travelling to Europe’s capitals to solicit grants from governments. Yet, he rarely let these responsibilities go to his head. For example, Lewis loved to tell the story of Queen Elisabeth II, who upon visiting the Warsaw campus showed more interest in the kilt-wearing gardener than in him, the normal suit-wearing head of campus.\n\nIn fact, Lewis’ early education had already led him to distant lands. He was born in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, on January 24th, 1932, the second of three children. While in grammar school, the young David studied French near Paris, where he became lifelong friends with his pen pal’s brother, Michel Roche, who would later work for Mack Trucks. As an Oxford undergraduate, Lewis practiced his language skills at universities in Poitiers and Munich. In addition to a B.A. (1953) and an M.A (1968) from Oxford, Lewis obtained a diploma (1950) and a doctorate (1973) from La Sorbonne, in Paris. His doctoral thesis on Paul Verlaine’s poetry received the jury’s highest honours.\n\nIt might be these experiences that led Lewis to be a lifelong advocate of education, especial study abroad. In addition to university teaching, Lewis loved to teach chess, both to his children and to other children – as a teenager, David was the school chess captain, and at Oxford he was on the university chess team. During retirement, he continued this practice by teaching young French children at the town hall. Similarly, no matter where Lewis went, be it Strasbourg, Thunder Bay, Bethlehem or Warsaw, he created overseas programs and encouraged students to take advantage of these opportunities. He sent Lakehead students to Mexico, Lehigh students to Paris and Poitiers, College of Europe students to the Balkans. Overall, Lewis had a rare ability to relate to the young, many of whom admired his intellect (at Lehigh, he was president of Phi Beta Kappa) and celebrated his accomplishments as an educator. Students from everywhere confided in him and kept in contact after graduation. Towards the end of his life, the French Ministry of Culture admitted him to the honorific order of the Palmes académiques.\n\nLewis also traveled for pleasure, mostly in Europe. In his youth, he would ski. In the second half of his life, he played tennis. But perhaps because of his life-long ailment of asthma and eczema, most vacations were dedicated to finding good places to eat, drink and paint. On at least one occasion, he mixed all these pleasures, and used sangria to paint a Spanish sky. Throughout his life, Lewis would travel with his family by plane, train, ferry, and car, touring Europe on a small budget. David’s children grew accustomed to this lifestyle of cheap hotels, expensive food and leisurely travel. To alleviate the boredom of long car rides, he regaled them with pithy rhymes and bilingual puns – an oft-repeated classic was ‘Some say no, some say yes, off we go to Cadaquès!’\n\nLewis also encouraged his children to travel – he once visited Uganda, where his daughter drove him 2000 kilometres to see the country’s beauty. When his youngest son asked to spend a semester in Cairo, Lewis’ passion for foreign studies outweighed his concerns, and he gave his blessing. Today, his children have continued this pastime. Within a recomposed family, David had 14 grandchildren — in Canada, the United States, England, France and New Zealand — who all loved to visit and play ‘boules’ with him. Lewis met his first wife, Felicity on a ferry in the English Channel, and they had four children. Nicholas, Rosamund and Lydia-Maria were born in France, while the cadet, Diana, was born in Canada. While in Canada, Lewis met his second wife, Avril, on a television set where the two were producing French-language programs. Avril also had four children, William, Jonathon, Emma (all born in the England) and Matthew (born in Canada), and later gave birth to David’s youngest child, Olivier (born in the United States).\n\nWhile working in Warsaw, Lewis returned regularly to the south of France to visit Avril and Olivier. During one of these visits, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, later thought more likely to be Lewy body dementia. For a man of such intellect, this was tragic news. By 2003, Lewis was losing his ability to paint. His shaking hands could no longer produce the talent that once allowed him to sell his watercolours, oils and acrylics. Still, with his customary sense of humour, he described this as his ‘pointillist’ period. Most of his paintings are no longer in his house – he has long since given them to friends and family. From Vancouver to Wellington, pictures of English gardens, French villages and Maine harbours hang on living-room walls, reminding loved ones not only that he cared about them, but why he thought life is worth living: for beauty, nature and culture.\n\nBy 2010, Lewis had gradually lost his ability to finish a sentence. As a once great linguist, conversationalist and speaker, not being able to communicate was especially distressing. At grammar school he received perfect marks in Latin and French and won a declamation trophy. At Oxford he was an officer in the university’s French club. Occasionally, Lewis would write poetry for family members. As a professor, he designed and gave French courses on 17th century literature and French for business and international careers. In social gatherings, be they weddings, cocktail parties or dinners, Lewis would enjoy being the centre of attention. From Bruges to Avignon, he could be found holding a glass of wine, telling stories and showing off his wit. When he met children, he would kneel down to share scary faces, funny sounds and bad jokes. Throughout his life, he partook in dramatic productions, often playing the role of a monster or a villain, and for the guests at his wife’s gîte, he had become a main attraction. Ever spiritual, David did not hesitate to be contrary. For his funeral, he instructed his family that there were to be “no speeches”, only private reflection and Haydn’s Cello Concerto in D by Jacqueline Dupré.\n\nDuring his last years, Lewis also lost his ability to listen to music attentively. This must have upset him, for he spent his entire life listening to classical music. In fact, he loved classical music so much, that he took on pro-bono responsibilities. From 1970 to 1975, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra Association; from 1971 to 1973, he was on the Board of the Ontario Federation of Symphony Orchestras; and from 1974 to 1976, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Association of Symphony Orchestras.\n\nFinally, by 2015, David could no longer walk. His remaining pleasures were enjoying good meals and the loving care of his wife, who took care of his every need as his condition slowly worsened. It could be said that nothing ever stopped him from enjoying the world’s best foods. Even in his handicapped state, Lewis could distinguish fine goods from the bad. When Avril handed him a plate of appetizers, he would eat the fois gras and salmon, and leave the rest. While in Strasbourg, Lewis would, in classic French style, take long lunch breaks with friends and eat white asparagus by the kilo, accompanied with Gewürztraminer. In fact, even a world war could not stop Lewis’ gastronomic pleasures. From 1940 to 1954, many foods were rationed in England. So while David’s elder brother, Brian, and sister, Audrey, ate their daily butter ration as soon as possible, David saved a week’s worth of butter, and waited for Sunday to enjoy it all in one glorious toast-and-butter feast."
