        "text": "Cindy Blackstock\n\nB.A.(UBC); M.M.(McG.); M.Jur.(Loyola); Ph.D.(Tor.); LL.D.(UNBC)(Sask.)(Western)(Wat.)(Wpg.)(Ryerson)(Osgoode Law School); ipkDoc(BQFNU); D.Litt.(Mt.St.Vin.); D.C.L.(St John’s College)\n\nDr. Cindy Blackstock grew up in northern British Columbia and is a member of the Gitksan First Nation. Inspired by the inequity she saw firsthand as a social worker, she made it her life mission to advocate for the reform of Canada’s child welfare system to meet the needs of all.\n\nShe is a passionate defender of the rights of Indigenous children and families across Canada, an author and researcher. Dr. Blackstock received her bachelor of arts majoring in psychology from the University of British Columbia, her master’s degree in management from McGill, her Master’s in Jurisprudence from Loyola University Chicago and her Ph.D. in social work from the University of Toronto.\n\nHer work has been shaped by more than 30 years of experience in child protection and Indigenous children’s rights, first as a senior social worker for the Province of British Columbia and then for the Squamish First Nation.\n\nAppalled at the shortage of resources for Indigenous families, she joined with colleagues from Manitoba to form a national non-profit organization to provide research, policy, professional development and networking support for First Nations child and family services agencies. After a meeting at Squamish First Nation in 1998, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada was created. As executive director, she is an advocate and strong voice against the discrimination Indigenous children face, particularly as it relates to government actions and policies.\n\nIn 2007, she became the central figure in a groundbreaking complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal by the Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations. In January 2016, after nine years of testimony and investigation, the Tribunal issued a landmark ruling. For the first time in Canadian history, the federal government was ordered to provide equitable services to First Nations children and their families.\n\nDr. Blackstock travels tirelessly to communities all over Canada, reaching out to children, parents, policymakers and service providers. She is often accompanied by Spirit Bear, a teddy bear that doubles as a reconciliation advisor, with a very active Twitter account. With a little help from Dr. Blackstock, Spirit Bear has written a best-selling children’s book and outlined a plan to address inequities in public services for First Nations children, youth and families.\n\nDr. Blackstock’s vast contributions have been recognized with numerous honours, including honorary degrees, the Order of the Buffalo Hunt, the National Aboriginal Achievement Award (Public Policy) and an honorary lifetime membership in the Indigenous Bar Association. She has also served as a Trudeau Foundation Mentor and an Expert Advisor for UNICEF on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Dr. Cindy Blackstock, a truth-teller, community builder and champion for the rights of all children.\n\nElder Mary Elizabeth Courchene\n\nB.T.(Bran.); B.A., B.Ed.(Man.)\n\nA distinguished Indigenous leader and inspirational role model in the field of public education, Elder Mary Courchene generously offers her guidance and courage on our shared journey toward truth and reconciliation.\n\nDrawing from her own painful experiences as a Residential School Survivor, she seeks to build understanding that brings Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities together to learn, heal and grow.\n\nShe was born in Sagkeeng First Nation, where she enjoyed a happy childhood until she was sent to the Fort Alexander Residential School at the age of five. Isolated from her family, she endured years of devastating loneliness. A bright light emerged in Grade 7 when a supportive teacher instilled within her a confidence in her academic abilities. She began to see her own potential, and gained a love of learning.\n\nYears later, following marriage and seven children, this love of education would be rekindled. Although she had not completed high school, she reached out to Brandon University to apply for a special program. Her dream of a university education was fulfilled when she received her acceptance letter. She would go on to become one of the first Indigenous students to pursue multiple degrees from both Brandon University and the University of Manitoba.\n\nShe was soon at the forefront of Indigenous programming in the public school system. During a career that spanned more than three decades, she was the first Indigenous administrator in Winnipeg School Division, the inaugural principal of Children of the Earth School (the first Indigenous-focused, urban high school in Canada), and the first female dean of Aboriginal education at Red River College. She also co-founded Aboriginal Circle of Educators in 1987 and the Manitoba First Nations Educational Centre in 1998.\n\nOver the years, she has earned numerous awards and honours, including the YM-YWCA Women of Distinction Award, Aboriginal Community Educator of the Year, Aboriginal Circle of Educators Innovator Trailblazer Award, and Aboriginal Educator of the Year (Canadian Teachers Federation). She is an honored grandmother of Keep the Fires Burning, and has been awarded a sacred shawl and community recognition.\n\nIn 2008, she was among the 100 survivors invited to the House of Commons to witness the Canadian government’s historic apology for its role in Residential Schools. Today, she continues to speak about the intergenerational impacts of residential schools, often with her daughter and granddaughter at her side.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Elder Mary Elizabeth Courchene, an innovator and role model who has left a positive imprint on the landscape of public education in Manitoba.\n\nArnold Frieman\n\nO.M.; B.A.(Man.)\n\nArnold Frieman arrived in Canada homeless and penniless, only to become an esteemed benefactor of his adopted community.\n\nHe was born in Sátoraljaújhely, Hungary, in 1928, one of six children in an Orthodox Jewish family whose happy life was destroyed by the Holocaust. When he was 16 and studying in Budapest, his parents, two brothers, three sisters and grandfather were shipped to the concentration camp in Auschwitz. Arnold spent the next several months in a forced-labour camp before making a miraculous escape.\n\nAfter the war, he was taken to Norway, where he studied electronics - a skill he put to use as an Air Force volunteer in the Israeli War of Independence. Although he discovered that two of his sisters had miraculously survived and were living in Israel, he returned to Norway. In 1951, he decided to start life anew in Canada. He was headed to an arranged job in Ontario, but on a whim headed for Winnipeg where he hoped to find the Wild West he had fallen in love with as a child through the movies. He found a job and new friends, one of whom, Minnie Heft, encouraged him to pursue a university education. He feared that poor English and a lack of money would stand in his way, but passed the entrance exam. With a $1,000 gift from Mrs. Heft, he started a business to finance his studies. He fixed and re-sold car radios purchased from wrecking yards.\n\nMr. Frieman considers his years at the University of Manitoba among the most impactful of his life. He graduated in 1960 with a bachelor of arts degree and a renewed belief in possibilities, as well as the love of Myra Thompson, whom he married that same year.\n\nIn 1962, he bought the small television repair shop that would become Advance Electronics. Within 12 years, Advance had grown into the largest independently owned electronics store in Western Canada.\n\nOne of the joys of his success is his ability to give back. The many organizations he has supported range from iconic arts groups to small, grassroots causes. His generosity made possible the premiere of I Believe, a Holocaust oratorio that helps people everywhere appreciate the importance of peace and justice. His inclusive style of philanthropy encourages creativity and kindness.\n\nHis many contributions to his alma mater include support for the University of Manitoba-University of Szeged Partnership, which funds exchanges between Hungarian and Manitoban scholars.\n\nOver the years, his achievements have been recognized with numerous honours, most notably his induction into the Order of Manitoba in 2006.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Arnold Frieman, an exceptional global citizen and builder of this community.\n\nGregory Hanson\n\nC.M.; B.Comm.(Hons.)(Man.); F.C.P.A.; F.C.A.; F.L.M.I.; F.C.I.P.\n\nMr. Gregory Hanson is a highly respected business leader with a well-deserved reputation for strengthening Manitoba communities.\n\nFrom a young age, his determined, independent spirit was encouraged. His father passed away when he was just 14 months old, but he was never made to feel disadvantaged. His mother, a woman as compassionate as she was strong, raised her son to be equally so.\n\nHe worked part-time to attend private school, eventually enrolled at the University of Manitoba and after graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) in 1976, went on to earn his chartered accountant designation. At university he also met his wife Mary, whom he says deserves three-quarters of the credit for his success. Together they raised a son, Adam, and a daughter, Janine.\n\nMr. Hanson joined Wawanesa Mutual Insurance in 1979. In 1992, at age 41, he became the youngest president and CEO in the company’s 100-year-old history. Under his leadership, Wawanesa transformed into Canada’s largest mutual insurance company and one of the country’s top-ranked property and casualty insurers.\n\nAs his influence in business grew, Mr. Hanson also became a major force in the community. He was chair of the Winnipeg Foundation and the 2010 United Way of Winnipeg campaign, and has played a leading role in many other organizations that improve the well-being of those who call Manitoba home.\n\nThe highlight of his volunteer service was with the 1999 Pan American Games, which he counts as the toughest but most rewarding of tasks. As chair of finance, he brought the event to a successful close with a surplus of $8 million - a legacy that continues to benefit sports programs in Manitoba.\n\nToday he is focused on the success of the next generation of Indigenous Peoples, most notably through the Winnipeg Boldness Project, which empowers families in the Point Douglas neighbourhood. He also champions the Bear Clan Patrol, encouraging more formalized governance practices and also volunteering on the patrol itself.\n\nSince retiring in 2007, he has remained active in the business community and currently sits on the board of James Richardson & Sons and chairs the board of Wynward Insurance Group. At the University of Manitoba, he is a member of the President’s Front and Centre campaign team.\n\nHis many honours include the Order of Canada, the University of Manitoba’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce Lieutenant Governor’s Award for outstanding service to the community.\n\nRichard G. Henriquez\n\nC.M.; B.Arch.(Man.); M.Arch.(MIT); LL.D.(SFU); F.R.A.I.C.; O.A.A.; R.C.A.; A.A.A.\n\nFew Canadian architects have influenced contemporary urban design more than Mr. Richard Henriquez. Over the past 50 years, his imaginative approaches have shaped the architectural character of Vancouver and drawn worldwide attention.\n\nBorn in Jamaica, Mr. Henriquez came to Canada as a young man to study architecture at the University of Manitoba. He quickly distinguished himself, winning the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada Student Medal and the University of Manitoba’s Faculty of Architecture thesis prize. After graduation in 1964, he then continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where, three years later, he received a master of architecture degree specializing in urban design.\n\nAfter moving to Vancouver, he launched the practice that is now Henriquez Partners Architects. He soon began a prolific evolution beyond the modernist style so prevalent in the 1960s. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment is his influence on the development of Vancouverism, a distinctive form of high-density urban design that combines slim towers, lowrise buildings, parks and view corridors to create intimate, livable neighbourhoods. Vancouverism is now widely regarded as one of the reasons the city is consistently rated as one of the best places to live in the world.\n\nVancouverism originated at a time of growing opposition to tall buildings. The turning point came in 1984 with the construction of The Sylvia, the first of four residential highrises designed by Mr. Henriquez for Vancouver’s West End. With its slim proportions and thoughtful relationship to the site, The Sylvia overcame public resistance to towers, enabling these structures to become one of the defining features of Vancouver’s urban landscape. In 1999, Canadian Architect magazine named this highrise one of the most influential Canadian buildings of the twentieth century.\n\nThe Sylvia was also an artistic breakthrough for Mr. Henriquez. He became a storyteller, combining functional forms with a more complex range of expression and meaning. An accomplished visual artist in his own right, he has continued to blur the lines between art and architecture, introducing elements of painting, sculpture, geometry and surrealism to his work. Planners and designers from all over the world now flock to Vancouver for inspiration.\n\nMr. Henriquez has also become one of Canada’s foremost crusaders for public architectural awareness. He has been the driving force behind the Vancouver Urbanarium Society, a platform for engaging citizens in conversations about urban development.\n\nHis achievements have been recognized with many honours, including the Gold Medal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, the most prestigious award for lifetime achievement in Canadian architecture.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, to Mr. Richard G. Henriquez for his outstanding contribution to the craft and culture of architecture in Canada and beyond.\n\nThe Honourable Janis Guðrún Johnson\n\nB.A.(Man.)\n\nFor nearly half a century, the Honourable Janis Johnson has had an important influence on public policy in Canada. She has also championed many vital organizations that enrich the quality and vibrancy of life in Manitoba.\n\nA proud Icelandic-Canadian from Gimli, she is the eldest daughter of Doris Blondal Johnson and the Honourable Dr. George Johnson, the province's 20th lieutenant governor.\n\nMs. Johnson first pursued political science at the University of Manitoba and was a leader in the student union. After completing her bachelor of arts degree in 1968, she moved to Ottawa, where she was a youth policy advisor to the Honourable Robert Stanfield, then Leader of the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party of Canada. Later, she became policy advisor to the president of the PC Party of Canada.\n\nReturning to Manitoba in 1979, Ms. Johnson became an advisor to Premier Sterling Lyon and created the first Women's Progressive Conservative Caucus in Winnipeg. She also worked with the University of Manitoba's continuing education division, where she designed a program enabling women to become better-equipped to return to the workforce.\n\nIn 1983 she served as Manitoba co-chair of Brian Mulroney's successful campaign for the leadership of the national PC Party, and soon after became the national director of the PC Party of Canada - the first woman to hold this position.\n\nMs. Johnson also founded a public policy and communications consulting company that did extensive work in the areas of women's health and equality, Indigenous affairs and cultural policy.\n\nShe was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1990, and upon retiring in 2016 was the longest-serving Conservative member. She served as chair or vice-chair of the committees on Human Rights, Aboriginal Peoples, Transport and Communications, and Fisheries and Oceans. She was also elected three times to lead the U.S.-Canada Parliamentary Group, and served on the steering committee for the Senate Foreign Affairs and Environment committees.\n\nVolunteerism has been a fundamental part of Ms. Johnson's life, through her extensive involvement with the Special Olympics and arts organizations in Winnipeg. She was the founding honorary president of Nature Canada for Women, and has been a long-time advocate and fundraiser for women's health research and services.\n\nMs. Johnson is one of the few Canadians to be awarded the prestigious Order of the Falcon by the Government of Iceland in recognition of her work on Canada-Iceland relations. She is currently chair of the Valuing Icelandic Presence board in the University of Manitoba's department of Icelandic studies. Ms. Johnson also founded the Gimli Film Festival, now one of the largest festivals of its kind in Canada.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to the Honourable Janis Guðrún Johnson, a visionary leader in public policy and community service.\n\nGlen Alan Jones\n\nB.A., B.Ed.(Man.); M.Ed., Ph.D.(Tor.)\n\nDr. Glen Jones is widely recognized as the foremost scholar writing about Canadian universities, as well as one of the world’s leading authorities on university governance.\n\nHe grew up on a farm near Killarney, Manitoba, the youngest of four children. He began his post-secondary education at the University of Manitoba, earning his bachelor of arts in 1983 and bachelor of education in 1985.\n\nDuring his studies, he developed a passion for universities, envisioning these post-secondary institutions not just as places to be educated, but as extraordinary spaces where ideas are born and diverse perspectives come together. He has since devoted a lifetime to the study of what makes the Canadian system unique, why it works and how we can maximize its capacity to be an incubator of new opportunities.\n\nDr. Jones pursued this dream at Canada’s largest all-graduate faculty of education, the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at the University of Toronto. After earning his master’s and doctorate in higher education, he joined the faculty as a teacher and researcher. He progressed through a number of roles, and was the first to hold the prestigious Ontario Research Chair in Postsecondary Education Policy and Measurement.\n\nIn 2016, he became dean of OISE, an appointment that allows all of his strengths to converge. With Dr. Jones at the helm, the organization has successfully undergone a comprehensive and rapid transformation involving a range of stakeholders, from students and staff to policymakers.\n\nWhile his leadership skills are revered, he is most proud of his contributions to higher education research. Collaborating with peers from around the world, he has greatly expanded our academic understanding of the factors impacting Canadian universities, from systems and governance to politics and policy.\n\nHis work has explored the unique aspects of the Canadian model, including the strong national partnerships that have flourished within the world’s most decentralized university system. Two decades ago, he explained these differences in the book Higher Education in Canada: Different Systems, Different Perspectives, and it remains a foundational work for understanding higher education across our country.\n\nDr. Jones has written or co-authored 14 books and more than a hundred articles on Canadian higher education, and has been called upon to share his expertise in more than 40 countries. The many awards and honours bestowed on his work have taken him to Barbados, Beijing, Oslo and Shanghai, to name a few.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, to Dr. Glen Alan Jones for his outstanding contribution to higher education.\n\nOvide William Mercredi\n\nO.M.; LL.B.(Man.); LL.D.(Bishop's)(St. Mary's)(Leth.); D.Litt.(Athab.)\n\nMr. Ovide Mercredi, former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, is a highly respected lawyer, negotiator, lecturer, activist, artist, author and poet. During his decades of advocacy for Indigenous rights, Mr. Mercredi has championed education and charted a path towards reconciliation.\n\nBorn into a traditional Cree family in 1946 in Grand Rapids, Manitoba, he learned early on about social injustice. When he was a teenager, his family lost their home and traditional way of life to massive hydro development in their community.\n\nThis experience ignited young Ovide’s political awareness and moved him to pursue higher education at the University of Manitoba in 1970. Without Grade 12, he was able to attend the University of Manitoba through the ACCESS program. He was a trailblazing student, helping to establish the first Indigenous Students’ Association in Canada, and as its president, successfully lobbied for a department of Native Studies. He graduated with a law degree.\n\nInspired by the teachings of notable world leaders who advocated non-violent protest, particularly Mohandas K. Gandhi, Mr. Mercredi formed a strong belief that constitutional law must be the basis for achieving real change for Indigenous Peoples in Canada.\n\nMr. Mercredi was elected Manitoba regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations in 1989, and soon became a leading advocate for the right to self-government. Not only was he a key strategist in helping defeat the Meech Lake Accord, he played an integral role in resolving the Oka Crisis in Quebec.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1997, he served two terms as national chief for the Assembly of First Nations, representing 1.5 million people from more than 600 bands. Involved in formulating the Charlottetown Accord, Mr. Mercredi addressed the United Nations in both Geneva and New York. And from 2005 to 2011, he brought many improvements to his home community as chief of the Misipawistik Cree Nation.\n\nToday, Mr. Mercredi is helping to transform health services for those living in the 49 communities of Nishnawbe Aski Nation in northern Ontario.\n\nMr. Mercredi has been actively involved with the University of Manitoba as an advisor on many issues, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2013.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Mr. Ovide Mercredi, a tireless advocate and mentor who guides us on the path to reconciliation.\n\nJanet Rossant\n\nC.C.; B.A., M.A.(Hons.)(Oxford); Ph.D.(Cambridge); LL.D.(Dal.)(Mt.All.)(Wind.); D.Sc.(UBC)(Cambridge)\n\nThrough her trailblazing stem-cell research, Dr. Janet Rossant has advanced the study of children’s illnesses and laid the groundwork for future advances in regenerative medicine.\n\nGrowing up in southeast England, she was inspired to study life sciences by her female biology teacher, during a time when girls were often discouraged from pursuing science. Undeterred, she received her bachelor of arts in zoology at Oxford University, followed by a Ph.D. in mammalian development at Cambridge University. In 1977, marriage brought her to Canada, where she joined Brock University and then the University of Toronto, as an associate professor.\n\nThe goal of her research is to understand the miracle of how a single cell develops into a complex organism like a human being. She demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cells can in fact form a healthy, living creature, if provided with supporting placental cells. This suggested that human embryonic stem cells could be a major source of cells to treat degenerative diseases.\n\nHer groundbreaking work led to the discovery of the trophoblast stem cell, which helped understand how congenital abnormalities in the heart, blood vessels and placenta can occur. Her current research focuses on genetic control of both normal and abnormal development of embryos. These findings have been applied to the study of regenerative medicine, birth defects and cancer.\n\nWith these advances come questions about the ethical use of stem cells. She has helped lead the discussion by chairing the working group developing stem cell guidelines set by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\nToday, she remains at the forefront of developmental biology and stem cell research. She is president and scientific director of The Gairdner Foundation, a senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the Hospital for Sick Children, and a deputy scientific director of the Canadian Stem Cell Network. She has also been the director of the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine and a member of the University of Manitoba’s Distinguished Professor Selection Committee.\n\nHer contributions have been recognized with many national and international awards, including the Gairdner Wightman Award (2015) and the Ross G. Harrison Medal from the International Society of Developmental Biologists (2013). In 2018, she was selected as the Laureate of North America for the L’Oréal-UNESCO for Women in Science Award. She is also a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Science, honoris causa, to Dr. Janet Rossant, a world leader in the field of developmental biology.\n\nEsther Suen Chi Lan\n\nB.Comm.(Hons.)(Man.); Honorary Fellow (Hong Kong)\n\nMs. Esther Suen transformed her family’s business into one of the world’s leading suppliers of high-end electrical appliances, while furthering its legacy of international philanthropy.\n\nRaised among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, Ms. Suen moved to the Canadian prairies at age 17, eager to study business at the University of Manitoba.\n\nAs a student here, she quickly realized that learning about a culture different from her own was as much of an education as her lessons in the classroom. This new global awareness would shape her way of thinking, in life and in business, from that point forward.\n\nShe returned to Hong Kong in 1985 with her Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) degree, and soon joined Simatelex Manufactory Company Ltd., founded by her father, Suen Chi Sun.\n\nSince taking over as vice-chair and managing director two decades ago, Ms. Suen has guided Simatelex through a period of tremendous growth. She has greatly expanded the company’s product lines, from kitchen appliances to floor care and robotic products for the global market.\n\nWhat began as a small factory in 1969 is now a top manufacturer with five plants in southern China and 20,000 employees. The company produces 20 million products a year for some of the world’s biggest brands such as Keurig, Cuisinart, Philips, Nespresso and Breville.\n\nWhile expanding, modernizing and reshaping operations, she remains true to her father’s core principles of quality, integrity and attention to detail. She also honors her family’s strong commitment to the community. Through the Simatelex Charitable Foundation, she supports a wide range of causes related to higher education, medical research, emergency relief and the arts.\n\nMs. Suen has never forgotten the value of her experience at the University of Manitoba. To give others this opportunity, she supports an exchange program for international students enrolled at her alma mater.\n\nMs. Suen also champions the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the University of Hong Kong through contributions toward endowed professorship, dormitory development and student scholarships. She has made donations to support schools for underprivileged students as well as those with accessibility requirements.\n\nIn recognition of her gifts to academia and the wider community, the University of Hong Kong named Ms. Suen an honorary fellow in 2008.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Ms. Esther Suen, a business leader and philanthropist who inspires the next generation.\n\nMartin Joel Yaffe\n\nC.M.; B.Sc.(Hons.), M.Sc.(Man); Ph.D.(Tor.); A.A.P.M.\n\nInternationally recognized scientist, Dr. Martin Yaffe, has devoted his career to finding ways to help women with breast cancer. The diagnostic techniques he continues to pioneer save thousands of lives around the world every year.\n\nDr. Yaffe grew up in the North End of Winnipeg, the eldest of three sons in a family with Eastern European roots. His parents taught their boys that education was the pathway to a successful life. Inspired by an uncle who was a nuclear chemist, young Martin pursued a career in science.\n\nHe began his studies at the University of Manitoba, completing a bachelor of science in 1971 and master of science two years later. Dr. Yaffe recalls listening intently to a visiting scientist from the University of Toronto, who spoke passionately about the great contributions physicists could make to medicine. He immediately shifted his focus to medical physics - a decision that eventually led to him becoming a Ph.D. student in the lab of that same inspiring scientist.\n\nDr. Yaffe earned his Ph.D. in medical biophysics in 1978, and in the 40 years since, the University of Toronto remained his homebase for groundbreaking research in breast cancer management. Today he is a professor in the department of medical biophysics and the Tory Family Chair in Cancer Research at Sunnybrook Institute.\n\nHe is driven to transform laboratory findings into practical advances in everyday care. Best known as a pioneer in the development of digital mammography, he has helped to substantially improve the accuracy of breast cancer imaging. He was one of the first scientists to recognize the potential of emerging technologies in digital electronics and computers, and then motivate industry leaders to bring his concepts to commercial fruition. Today, digital mammograms are widely accepted as the modern standard of care throughout the world.\n\nDr. Yaffe is now researching ways to improve and expand the use of the technologies he has developed. With his colleague Dr. Norman Boyd, he is exploring computer-generated mammographic signatures associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. A startup company he co-founded is developing software that will allow these findings to be used cost-effectively in the field.\n\nDr. Yaffe’s achievements have earned him many distinguished awards, among them the Sylvia Fedoruk Prize, the Greenfield Award and a fellowship from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. For his tireless advocacy of improved breast screening for younger women, he was recently honoured with the Cause Leadership Award of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. He was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2015.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Science, honoris causa, to Dr. Martin Joel Yaffe, an outstanding role model for the Canadian scientific community.\n\nThe Honourable Maria Emma Chaput\n\nP.C.\n\nBorn in 1942, Mme Maria Chaput was raised in a francophone family in Ste. Anne, Manitoba, rich with French culture and with an unwavering dedication to their mother tongue. She would devote herself to ensuring future generations experience the same opportunity and freedom she had: to live life in the official language of their choosing.\n\nMme Chaput’s passion for language and minority rights was ignited when she went to enroll her eldest daughter in school. She and fellow community parents realized their French children had no choice but to receive an education in English-speaking schools. Mme Chaput and her colleagues faced court battles for decades as they fought for their legal right to access schooling in their official language. Thanks in large part to the tenacity of the community, the Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine was established in 1994 and today, the francophone division educates more than 5,000 students in 24 schools province-wide.\n\nMme Chaput believes strongly in the power of post-secondary education and yet it was not always within reach. The eldest of 11 children, Mme Chaput initially had to forgo university to stay home to help her mother, but years later while raising three daughters of her own, she proudly enrolled in classes at the Université de Saint-Boniface.\n\nIn 1984, Mme Chaput expanded her advocacy to the arts in the role of executive director at the Centre Culturel Franco-Manitobain. She understands the need to create in one’s native language, and has said, “If I couldn’t speak French, part of my heart would be missing.”\n\nShe served as the first female president of the Caisse Financial Group in Manitoba, and also brought the integrity she is known for to her post as vice-chair of the Board of Governors at the Université de Saint-Boniface, deputy director of the Franco-Manitoban Society, and director of the charitable foundation Francofonds.\n\nHer historic appointment to the Senate in 2002 as the first Franco-Manitoban woman to sit in the chamber cast a national spotlight on her trailblazing spirit. During her 13 years as a Senator, Mme Chaput served on diverse committees, including agriculture and forestry, national finance, foreign affairs, and of course, official languages.\n\nShe put forth Bill S-209 four times to modernize the Official Languages Act, and pushed diligently for the language and cultural rights of francophones in settings as varied as airports, the Olympics and the Internet. Through it all, she has asserted that upholding French language rights is not simply an obligation or concession, but a central tenet and asset of the Canadian identity.\n\nShe has received numerous awards, including the Prix Riel of the Société Franco-Manitobaine, the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal, and the Légion d’honneur, the highest distinction awarded by the Government of France.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Mme Maria Chaput, a driving force for language and cultural rights.\n\nThomas Ralston Denton, LL.D., June 8, 2017\n\nO.M.; B.A.(Acadia); LL.B.(Dal.)\n\nMr. Tom Denton was born in 1934 in Amherst, Nova Scotia, and in the formative years that followed, developed a finely tuned sense of injustice.\n\nAs a child, he was horrified when his father’s colleague, an esteemed Baptist minister and black man, was refused service at restaurants. As an arts student at Acadia University years later, he spoke out in an opinion piece in the student newspaper effectively putting an end to offensive minstrel shows on campus. Once he became a corporate lawyer with a degree from Dalhousie University in 1958, he convinced senior management to raise the pensions of employees who had been acquired through corporate takeover. He was also concerned about the democracy of a city with only one newspaper, and therefore launched the Winnipeg Sun with three partners, in 1980.\n\nWhen Mr. Denton convinced his Rotary club to sponsor a Vietnamese refugee family in the late 1970s, his background in law and his unyielding moral conscience found the perfect fit, and so begun a journey of compassion and care that has endured.\n\nHe has been called “the godfather of the refugee settlement sector in Canada”. From 1984 to 2000, Mr. Denton was the executive director at the International Centre of Winnipeg supporting the needs of government-aided refugees. When he became frustrated by the number of people still turned away by the government, he created a platform through his church to bring in privately sponsored refugees.\n\nMr. Denton retired in 2000, but remained a highly sought-after speaker and policy consultant across the globe. He has served on the Council of the Sponsorship Agreement Holders of Canada; the Canadian Council for Refugees; the Premier’s Economic Advisory Council Immigration Task Force; and as chair of the Manitoba Immigration Council.\n\nIn 2006, he took on the executive director position at the Hospitality House Refugee Ministry. He remains at the helm more than a decade later, helping privately sponsored refugees navigate a complex process, and in turn, successfully sponsor their own relatives to reunite family.\n\nMr. Denton’s refugee rights and integration policy is considered protocol by countries around the world. He has called the fateful and systemic cruelties that refugees face “the fundamental moral issue of our time”, and is a fearless critic of government and regulatory bodies in his advocacy for updated policy and further assistance. Mr. Denton has been personally involved in the settlement of more than 40,000 refugees. For his remarkable efforts, he was inducted into the Order of Manitoba in 2014.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Mr. Thomas Ralston Denton, a seminal figure in human rights work and a hero to tens of thousands of refugees.\n\nThe Honourable Douglas D. Everett\n\nLL.B.(Osgoode); LL.B.(Man.)\n\nThe Honourable Douglas D. Everett served in the Canadian Senate for almost three decades and remains one of Manitoba’s most successful entrepreneurs.\n\nBorn in Vancouver in 1927, he grew up with the strong moral compass and work ethic displayed by his parents, and the competitive spirit of three siblings.\n\nIn 1943, he joined the Royal Canadian Navy as a 16-year-old cadet at Royal Rhodes Military College. He served for four years and retired as a sub-lieutenant. He graduated from Toronto’s Osgoode Hall Law School in 1950 and from the University of Manitoba’s Faculty of Law in 1951.\n\nHe charted a course in business at his father’s Winnipeg car dealership, Dominion Motors, which was Canada’s largest Ford dealership. In 1970, his entrepreneurial spirit pushed the company into an innovative foray to create a chain of gas kiosks at grocery stores.\n\nSenator Everett leased a small spot of land on three Safeway parking lots, installing two-pump kiosks. Such low overhead created savings he could pass along to the customer and he had effectively levelled the playing field against industry giants Shell and Imperial Oil. The iconic Domo brand is now among Canada’s largest independent gas retailers with more than 90 locations across Western Canada. The company is one of several that make up Royal Canadian Securities, of which Senator Everett remains chairman emeritus and strategic advisor.\n\nHumble by nature, he credits his business success to the individuals who made up his team. His visionary leadership earned their loyalty and many Domo employees enjoyed careers that stretched four decades.\n\nAs the company expanded and grew into a major industry player, the astute businessman caught the attention of Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who called him to the Senate in 1966. At the time, he was the youngest person to have joined our nation’s Upper Chamber, at just 39 years old.\n\nAs chairman of the Committee on National Finance, he sought out inefficiencies in government departments, and criticized policy on wage and price control, the inflation rate and our unemployment system. His convictions prompted him to sit as an Independent in the Senate and, in 1988, he made headlines around the world when he began to donate his Senate salary back to the Crown, which he did until his retirement in 1994.\n\nHe and his late wife, Patty, then turned their attention to philanthropy with transformational gifts in health care, the arts, and education that have bolstered neurodegenerative research, championed creative works, and enriched the experience of post-secondary students.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to the Honourable Douglas D. Everett, an entrepreneur and philanthropist who fulfilled his civic duty to the highest accord.\n\nHer Excellency Sharon J. Johnston\n\nC.C.; B.A.(Western); B.Sc.(Tor.); M.Sc., Ph.D.(McGill); LL.D.(Carleton)(VIU)\n\nHer Excellency Sharon Johnston has given her formidable knowledge, a sympathetic ear and a visible platform to those living with mental illness. She is a fervent advocate who has challenged Canadians to remove stigma and create positive change. Her desire to help others, coupled with her passion for health, wellness and the sciences, prompted her to pursue a career as a physical and occupational therapist. With determination and drive, Her Excellency completed her masters and doctorate degrees in rehabilitation sciences at McGill University while helping to raise five young daughters.\n\nWhen her husband, Governor General David Johnston, took on his distinguished new role in 2010 she stepped forward as vice-regal consort. In this capacity, Her Excellency has advocated for all Canadians, from our children to our nation’s civil service, and urges us to consider mental illness in the same way we would any other illness.\n\nShe has travelled to Indigenous communities throughout the country and witnessed the challenges they face. Her Excellency was so alarmed by what she found that in 2012, she initiated the country’s first roundtable on Indigenous health, in her home at Rideau Hall.\n\nShe has advocated for better support and updated policy for our military members and their families. With her background in art therapy, Her Excellency sought paintings and sculptures to install at CFB Petawawa to help soldiers on their path to wellness. In 2016, she was appointed Honorary Captain (Navy) for Military Personnel Command of the Canadian Armed Forces in appreciation of her dedication and support.\n\nHer latest turn is that of novelist. Matrons and Madams evolves around the theory that it takes four generations of a family to resolve the effects of war. It is loosely based on her insight into those that serve our country, and her grandmother, who served as a hospital superintendent after the Great War. Proceeds from the novel will support the Royal Ottawa Foundation for Mental Health.\n\nAltruism is an integral part of Her Excellency’s character. Beyond her mental health advocacy, she served on the Board of Governors for the Collège Marie de France and Bishop’s College School, and co-founded Friends of the Neuro at the Montreal Neurological Institute, which provides support for patients and their families.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Her Excellency Sharon Johnston, for her life-long commitment to the mental health of all Canadians.\n\nJennifer Judith Jones\n\nO.M.; B.A., LL.B.(Man.)\n\nBorn and raised in Winnipeg, Ms. Jennifer Jones grew up watching her parents curl at the local rink in their Windsor Park neighbourhood and by age 11, she started playing the popular winter sport in earnest.\n\nAt first, her participation was a means to overcome the shyness she felt as a child, but soon it became clear she possessed remarkable skills on the ice. By age 16, she had won her first of three Manitoba Junior Championships. She is a seven-time provincial champion with an inaugural win in 2002; a five-time Canadian champion with her first victory in 2005; and has achieved bronze, silver and gold medals at the world curling championships.\n\nIn 2014, Ms. Jones stepped atop the ultimate podium to receive her Olympic gold in Sochi, Russia. By then the face of women’s curling in Canada, Ms. Jones led her team to a continuous run of victories in the 11-game Olympic tournament, a feat that had never before been accomplished by a female skip.\n\nMs. Jones had first set the curling world on fire one decade earlier during the Scott Tournament of Hearts, when she made what has become known as “The Shot”. Under tremendous pressure, she completed a difficult in-out maneuver to secure four points, claiming not only a game victory but her first national title. It had teammates cheering and fans across Canada trying to re-enact the spectacular move characterized by one announcer as “the best shot I’ve ever seen to win a game”.\n\nShe brings the skills she acquired through elite sport to her role as a corporate lawyer. Ms. Jones completed her bachelors of arts in 1996 and a law degree three years later at the University of Manitoba. She is currently a senior advisor and community ambassador at National Bank Financial.\n\nMs. Jones offers mentorship to young athletes through the organization Fuelling Women Champions, which aims to keep teenaged girls engaged in organized sport given the many benefits to their physical health and emotional well-being. Ms. Jones also serves on the board of the Health Sciences Centre Foundation and initiated the popular Celebrity Human Race, which has raised more than $2.8 million to improve facilities and patient care.\n\nTeam Jones attempted an Olympic repeat in South Korea in 2018. Ms. Jones was inducted into the Order of Manitoba in 2014, and most recently in 2017 was declared a recipient of a Governor General’s Meritorious Service Medal.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Ms. Jennifer Jones for setting the bar not only in sport, but in mentorship and strengthening community.\n\nMicheal O'Siadhail\n\nB.A., M.Litt.(Trinity)\n\nMicheal O’Siadhail, one of Ireland’s finest and most prolific poets, grew up in middle-class Dublin in the 1950s.\n\nWhile attending a Jesuit boarding school as a teenager, he discovered his love of poetry. It was a fitting medium for the impassioned youth, who felt things deeply and was intrigued by language.\n\nHe pursued a Master of Letters from Trinity College Dublin and would continue on with this post-secondary institution from 1969 to 1973 in his career as a linguistics academic. In his role as a professor at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies that followed, Mr. O’Siadhail pioneered a textbook and audio collection titled Learning Irish that remains the standard introductory course on the topic around the world.\n\nThe pull of poetry was strong and Mr. O’Siadhail left academia in 1987. His intuitive grasp of the human experience has since made him a treasured poet with works translated in countries across the globe.\n\nMr. O’Siadhail has written 16 collections of poetry, alternating between public and private spheres, exploring themes as varied as friendship, history, trust, love, language, mortality and the Holocaust. This international scholar who speaks 10 languages feels equally at home in Norway, Iceland, England, the U.S. and Canada. His recent collection of poetry, titled Tongues, reflects his truly global perspective.\n\nHis poetry achieves a level of intensity while still being accessible, the latter of which Mr. O’Siadhail believes in wholeheartedly. He has served as editor of the Poetry Ireland Review, established and first chaired the Ireland Literature Exchange, and was a founding member of Aosdána, the Academy of Distinguished Irish Artists.\n\nBringing his keen intellect and artistic insight to students and fellow academics, he has served as a visiting professor, writer-in-residence and guest lecturer around the world, including at Harvard and Yale universities.\n\nHis work has been awarded the Irish-American Cultural Institute Prize for Poetry, the Marten Toonder Award, and the Poetry Book of the Year from the Sunday Tribune. In 2003, The Gossamer Wall: Poems in Witness to the Holocaust was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Literary Prize.\n\nHis inspiration finds its roots in theatre, classical music and jazz; he sees their intrinsic connection to poetry, through rhythm, alliteration and rhyme. Passionate about his art, Mr. O’Siadhail likens each of his poems to a child he sends off into the world to engage and explore.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, to Mr. Micheal O’Siadhail, who stands tall in the mighty pantheon of Irish poets.\n\nElder J. Louis Peninshish (Bird)\n\nJournalism Cert.(Confederation)\n\nBorn on Hudson Bay’s west coast in 1934, Elder Louis Peninshish gained an appreciation early on for the traditional stories of the Omushkego Cree peoples.\n\nHis childhood was spent by his mother’s side, as she performed the tasks that allowed their family of 10 to live off the land. She would share stories with him passed down over generations that celebrate the culture, spiritual practices, beliefs and history of the Omushkegowak.\n\nElder Peninshish’s love of their holistic way of life would survive the pain of four years at Ste. Anne Residential School in Fort Albany, beginning at age five. His life experiences, both the joys and the sorrows, shaped his journey and pushed him to continue his pursuit to preserve and celebrate the stories of his people.\n\nAs a young adult, he took on various jobs in neighbouring communities and encountered a growing number of Elders who enabled him to record even more stories. In 1955, he worked on the Winisk radar station, and later as a line cutter, surveyor’s assistant, winter tractor operator, carpenter’s helper, and section man for CN Rail. He has also served as band councillor and chief in Winisk, and in 1970 began work as a translator and consultant.\n\nAll the while, Elder Peninshish has remained a fierce protector of a culture steeped in oral tradition, dedicating more than five decades to the collection, narration and recording of more than 340 hours of Cree legends and traditional teachings. He has brought the history of his people to audiences across Canada, the United States and overseas, sharing these teachings in Cree and English at storytelling festivals and universities.\n\nWith a light heart and a quick wit, he brings to life the wisdom of his ancestors for the world to hear and learn from. A living archive, Elder Peninshish has published two books, The Spirit Lives in The Mind: Omushkego Stories, Lives, and Dreams and Telling our Stories: Omushkego Legends & Histories from Hudson Bay. He also narrates all stories recorded on the website, ourvoices.ca.\n\nHis expertise as a cultural historian is well-established and highly sought by government officials, curators, scholars and students across various disciplines. He has informed decisions on everything from educational funding to environmental legislation and economic development.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, to Mr. Louis Peninshish, a treasure to the Omushkego peoples and to all Canadians.\n\nSandra Pitblado\n\nB.A.(Tor.); LL.D.(Windsor)\n\nAs a young girl growing up during the Depression, Sandra Pitblado was introduced to the alchemy of the arts in Winnipeg by her mother and grandmother. She knew even then how fortunate she was to experience the magic of a show, and a lifetime later has become one of Canada’s greatest patrons of our dance and theatre communities.\n\nMs. Pitblado met her husband of more than five decades, business leader Mr. Jim Pitblado, when both were working at the Great West Life Assurance Company. His career took their family, complete with five children, from Winnipeg to Montreal and Toronto, where she began to make her mark as an enthusiastic fundraiser for arts and culture.\n\nHer support of The National Ballet of Canada has been particularly profound. She is a member of the organization’s Producers Circle, which provides funds for new productions, and she spearheaded the establishment of The Music Circle benefitting the Ballet’s orchestra.\n\nDuring her term as chair of the Stratford Festival from 1999 to 2001, she helped to facilitate the launch of the highly respected organization’s endowment foundation, as well as establish the Conservatory for Classical Theatre Training. The Avon Theatre was rebuilt and the Studio Theatre was constructed thanks to a significant leading gift from the Pitblados. An avid admirer of Shakespeare’s iconic works, Ms. Pitblado also helped to make it possible for the company to film its Shakespearean productions and distribute them to cinemas worldwide.\n\nThe Pitblados are loyal supporters of The Hospital for Sick Children and its SickKids Foundation, where they established a Chair in Cell Biology in memory of their son, David, who was passionate about science and lost his battle with cancer in 2004.\n\nThe University of Manitoba has been a proud recipient of the Pitblados’ generosity, most notably a transformational gift in 2001 that created the Pitblado Scholars program in Law. They have personally met every one of the more than 200 scholarship recipients.\n\nThe Pitblados were named the outstanding philanthropists of the year by the National Society of Fundraising Executives in 1999, and received the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts in 2003.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Ms. Sandra Pitblado for her passion, her inspiring leadership, and her steadfast advocacy, all in the name of the arts.\n\nGerry V. Price\n\nB.Sc., M.Sc.(Man.); Ph.D.(Lehigh)\n\nDr. Gerry Price’s father, the son of immigrants from Wales, earned an engineering degree from Carnegie Tech in 1932 and established a one-person sales company in air distribution products in Winnipeg in 1946. Dr. Price followed in his footsteps, earning a bachelor and master of science in mechanical engineering from the University of Manitoba.\n\nAfter completing his doctorate in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania in 1976, Dr. Price moved to rural Alberta to work as a defense scientific services officer with the Defense Research Board of Canada. One year later, he joined E.H. Price Limited and by 1986, he was appointed President.\n\nAs chairman and CEO of what is now the Price Group of Companies, the company has grown from 250 employees to more than 3,000, and sales from $30 million to over $550 million, with 19 sales offices and 13 manufacturing sites across North America. He immersed himself in every department of the company, even moving to Singapore at one point to oversee the development of its new manufacturing site. Price Industries is now a leader in air distribution equipment and technology.\n\nThe founding principles of the company have remained the same, and reflect a deep commitment not only to customer service but to research, development and innovation. Despite branching out to sites across the globe, Dr. Price has kept his headquarters in Winnipeg.\n\nBeyond his business acumen, he is renowned for his loyalty to his home community. At the University of Manitoba, he has established and contributed to scholarships for engineering and architecture students, supported facilities in the Faculty of Engineering, and recently established a bursary fund for Indigenous engineering students. In 2015, Dr. Price joined the President’s Campaign team for the Front and Centre campaign.\n\nHe has been instrumental in strengthening ties between the university and industry. Dr. Price was a founding member of Friends of Engineering, the Partners Program in the Faculty of Architecture, and the Associates of the I.H. Asper School of Business.\n\nDr. Price and his wife, Barb. are generous with their support, time and leadership, and highly committed to organizations throughout Manitoba. In 2011, they were named the Outstanding Philanthropists of the Year by the Manitoba Association of Fundraising Professionals.\n\nIn 2003, Dr. Price received the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters Excellence Award. He was inducted into the Manitoba Manufacturers’ Hall of Fame in 2006, and became a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineers in 2011. He received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal and a University of Manitoba Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012. Manitoba’s Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists gave Dr. Price the Leadership Award in 2013, and the University of Winnipeg awarded him the Duff Roblin Award in 2016.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Dr. Gerry Price for his exceptional business success and innovation, his generous spirit, and his commitment to our province and its people.\n\nMiriam Toews\n\nO.M.; B.A.(Man.); B.Journ.(King's College)\n\nMs. Miriam Toews was born in Steinbach, Manitoba, in 1964 and has become one of Manitoba’s most original and brave voices, authoring seven critically acclaimed books.\n\nHer novels explore topics society generally prefers to ignore, such as mental illness and suicide. Yet her deft use of humour disarms the reader and allows her to connect in profound ways as she relates her own experiences of growing up in a Mennonite family that suffered tragic losses.\n\nA direct descendent of one of the first Mennonites to settle in Steinbach, Ms. Toews embraced her Prairie roots and in her youth rode horses competitively, both dressage and barrel-racing. She left Steinbach at 18, moving to Montreal and London before returning to Winnipeg where she completed a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies at the University of Manitoba in 1989. In 1991, she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Journalism at the University of King’s College in Halifax.\n\nHer first novel grew from a radio documentary she was working on for the CBC about single mothers struggling within the Manitoba welfare system. She believed more had to be said beyond what journalism’s boundaries allowed for, leading to her first novel, Summer of My Amazing Luck. It shattered stereotypes and granted dignity to characters who so often have it stripped away. As a result, she won the John Hirsch Award for the Most Promising Manitoba Writer in 1996.\n\nHer third novel, the bestseller A Complicated Kindness, explores religious hypocrisy in a Manitoba Mennonite town and is revered for its brilliance and beauty. It won the Governor General’s Award for Fiction and was shortlisted for the Scotia Bank Giller Prize, an honour she has twice received.\n\nThe accolades continue as her latest work, her sixth novel, All My Puny Sorrows, won the Rogers Writers’ Trust Fiction Prize. This striking narrative explores the strength of sisters. In 2010, Ms. Toews lost her older sister to suicide, 12 years after her father took his own life. In his voice, she wrote a moving memoir Swing Low: A Life.\n\nMs. Toews has written for The New York Times Magazine, Geist, The Guardian, Saturday Night and Canadian Geographic. Her perceptions of life have been successfully adapted to other media: two of her novels have been performed on the stage, and in 2007, she played the lead role in the Mexican film Silent Light, which won the Cannes Jury Prize that year. In 2013, Ms. Toews was inducted into the Order of Manitoba.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, to Ms. Miriam Toews, a novelist who sheds lights on our inner struggles, bravely sharing her personal journey.\n\nSandra Buhai Barz\n\nB.A.(Skidmore)\n\nRaised in an eclectic Chicago suburb, Ms. Sandra Barz developed a deep appreciation for different cultures and ethnicities early in life. The daughter of a businessman and a social worker, she grew up with a love for storytelling and, in Grade 6, would make her own newspapers. Ms. Barz studied sociology in college but ultimately pursued a career in publishing, for years working at American magazines Redbook and McCall’s.\n\nWhat began as a personal interest in Inuit art as a collector would grow into a lifelong commitment to the people of the Far North. In 1976, Ms. Barz launched the first international newsletter on circumpolar art and affairs, Arts and Culture of the North, once realizing no such forum existed. She wanted to give a voice to Inuit artists, believing their rich culture should be shared with the world. The publication served as an important catalyst, bringing together artists, scholars, curators and collectors for the first time and capturing a time of enormous growth. Ms. Barz would go on to write and publish three books of documentation on Inuit printmaking, now recognized as the definitive works in the field. This labour of love is an unprecedented record of contemporary Inuit art that is widely cited by students and scholars in both the academic and museum worlds.\n\nMs. Barz championed the culture and creativity of a people. She made 35 trips to the Arctic over 40 years, painstakingly documenting the tiniest of details, from artists’ birthdates to their genealogy, all in an effort to preserve this history for future generations. She faced a formidable task: language barriers, remote communities, and collections hidden away in museums and in the homes of private collectors. Colleagues describe her accomplishment as an extraordinary feat, and her dedication as inspirational. She grew a database of nearly 8,000 Inuit prints from across the Arctic that date back almost six decades.\n\nShe also launched educational tours to the Far North, bringing people from around the world to meet artists face-to-face and expand their appreciation for Inuit culture and traditions. The study conference series Ms. Barz developed in Canadian cities and south of the border were groundbreaking and forged community connections that without her foresight might never have happened.\n\nMs. Barz’s legacy is to preserve the legacy of others. She has generously donated her collected materials to the National Gallery of Canada, the Smithsonian Institution, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the University of Manitoba archives.\n\nFor her outstanding example of altruism, the University of Manitoba is proud to bestow upon Ms. Sandra Barz a Doctor of Letters, honoris causa.\n\nBonita Lesley Buhler\n\nLL.D.(Wpg.)\n\nBorn in British Columbia, Ms. Bonnie Buhler moved to Winnipeg when she was 12 years old. Growing up, she never entertained the thought of attending university. In her early adult life, as a single mother raising two daughters, she struggled on a legal secretary’s salary to make ends meet.\n\nThings improved when she met her future husband and eternal best friend, John Buhler. He was also from a humble background, but over the years, they became a financial success story as they grew Buhler Industries, a leader in agricultural equipment.\n\nToday, Ms. Buhler is one of the most transformational philanthropists in Manitoba. She has made an immeasurable impact in our community through her support of health-care services, cultural institutes and education. She is the driving force behind her family's charitable foundation and her knowledge and influence have contributed to several successful campaigns.\n\nThe Buhlers have given a stunning $60 million to various charities, and recently revealed their aspiration to donate at least $100 million in their lifetime.\n\nMs. Buhler shapes our communities through her support of numerous organizations, including the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and the Manitoba Children's Museum, as well as Victoria General Hospital, Seven Oaks Hospital, St. Amant Centre, St. Boniface Hospital and Research Foundation, the Misericordia Hospital Eye Care Centre, and the Health Sciences Centre.\n\nMs. Buhler's first foray into philanthropy came as the result of a family health scare. After her daughter was diagnosed with endometriosis, she and her husband had to travel out of province for her treatment. Recognizing that most Manitobans do not have the means to travel to the Mayo Clinic in the United States, the Buhlers gifted the Health Sciences Centre with the equipment to treat endometriosis, initiating a legacy of philanthropy that continues today.\n\nMs. Buhler gives from the heart, and never seeks reward. Recalling her struggle to thrive as a single mother, Ms. Buhler established a scholarship at the University of Winnipeg to help single parents pursue higher education. Inspired by the joy of watching her grandchildren volunteer at the Children’s Museum, she financed significant renovations when it moved to its new location at The Forks. Honouring her mother and the health-care staff at St. Boniface Hospital, she established the unique Buhler Gallery, which presents rotating exhibitions by major Canadian artists to provide hospital visitors a refuge and solace. These are but a few examples of her philanthropy.\n\nThe University of Manitoba thanks Ms. Bonnie Buhler for her visionary and heartfelt support of our community and is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to someone who has impacted countless lives, now and for generations to come.\n\nAndrew Coyne\n\nB.A.(Hons.)(Tor.); M.Sc.(London School of Economics)\n\nMr. James Andrew Stobie Coyne was born in 1960 in Ottawa, Ontario, to Hope Meribeth Cameron Stobie and former governor of the Bank of Canada, James Elliott Coyne.\n\nMr. Coyne was raised in Winnipeg and while a student at the University of Manitoba was editor of The Manitoban. He went on to be a reporter at the Winnipeg Sun and eventually pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and history at the University of Toronto's University of Trinity College. At the London School of Economics, he received his Master's degree in economics and is also a Fellow of the School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Toronto.\n\nAfter working as a columnist and editorial writer for the Financial Post from 1985 to 1991, Mr. Coyne became a member of the editorial board of The Globe and Mail. Mr. Coyne earned back-to-back National Newspaper Awards for editorial writing in 1991 and 1992 (he later won the Hyman Solomon Award for Excellence in Public Policy Journalism).\n\nMr. Coyne became the national affairs columnist at the National Post in 1998. His publication credits include The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Saturday Night, and the Canadian edition of Time. For many years Mr. Coyne has also shared his insights with the popular At Issue panel on the CBC’s The National.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Coyne left his position with the National Post to become the national editor of Maclean's magazine. He returned to the National Post and its parent corporation, Postmedia, in 2012.\n\nMr. Coyne considers himself an optimist and believes that there is an opportunity for better politics, and that it is the role of the media to help bring it out. This passion and belief, combined with his acerbic wit, deft reasoning, sterling integrity and a deep well of knowledge, has propelled his career to the highest benchmark of excellence. He is one of our nation’s most trusted journalists, and his analyses of our government’s affairs and culture have helped Canadians see new truths.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to bestow upon Mr. Andrew Coyne a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, for promoting and protecting our democracy.\n\nBryce Douglas\n\nMr. Bryce Douglas was born and raised in Winnipeg. After graduating from high school in 1960, he worked as a junior clerk at the Bank of Montreal and as a miner in Thompson, Manitoba.\n\nHe found employment with Dominion Securities in 1963 and during his 42-year tenure with the organization, which is now RBC Capital Markets, Mr. Douglas helped to shape not only the largest but also the premier investment banking institution in Canada, and one of the oldest and most respected investment firms in all of North America. He retired from RBC Dominion Securities in 2006, holding the position of deputy chairman.\n\nBy dedicating himself to one firm over his lifetime, he has shown tremendous loyalty and has become an undeniable leader in finance. Mr. Douglas has also become a leader in philanthropy.\n\nAs he moved from city to city, taking on more senior responsibilities at RBC, Mr. Douglas would think of ways he could strengthen each community he called home. Not only does he champion causes he believes in, he achieves impressive results. It was Mr. Douglas’ business acumen, passion and dedication that helped to grow the Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation into one of the most successful fundraising organizations in the country.\n\nHe also chaired a campaign for the University Health Network in Toronto, raising more than $540 million for capital improvements and leading-edge programs to benefit all Canadians. He has funded a number of research programs there, most recently involving stem cell therapy for the treatment of arthritis.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Douglas see a need, they step forward. The couple supports a breakfast program in Kenora for kids who come to school hungry. They also provide funding, primarily through the YMCA, for children who do not have the resources to have a real outdoor camping experience.\n\nAlso close to their hearts is a Toronto-based program which offers supplemental education and leadership programs to financially disadvantaged children, many of whom come from new immigrant families. This program has grown from a handful of kids to 70 and counting.\n\nDuring his career, Mr. Douglas remained committed to enhancing the financial industry through ethical practices and education. He inspired the Bryce W. Douglas Professorship in Finance at the University of Manitoba in 2005. More recently, he and his family endowed a Chair in Finance at the Asper School of Business.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to Mr. Bryce Douglas, a visionary philanthropist who has strengthened our communities.\n\nPaul Henteleff\n\nM.D.(Man.)\n\nDr. Paul David Henteleff was born in 1931 in Winnipeg to Lillian Axelrode and Harry Henteleff. He earned his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1956 while also pursuing an interest in literature, philosophy and the arts.\n\nInspired by Dr. George Johnson, who later became Minister of Health, Dr. Henteleff completed additional training in rural Quebec and Saskatoon before setting up a small general practice in Winnipeg.\n\nDuring his 12 years as a family physician, Dr. Henteleff worked part-time with Dr. Jack MacDonnel, a pioneer in geriatrics, and served as medical director of St. Boniface Hospital’s Home Care program. He trained further in administrative medicine, earning certificates at home and in London, England.\n\nIn 1972, Dr. Henteleff took a leading role at the Manitoba Health Services Commission, where he helped design the personal care home program that today cares for approximately 10,000 people across 130 facilities. Three years later, he was appointed medical director of the palliative care unit at St. Boniface General Hospital, which was the first hospital in Canada to develop a program for patients nearing the end of their lives. From 1975 until his retirement in 1991, Dr. Henteleff presided over the palliative care system in Manitoba, helping more than 2,000 patients and their families understand their needs, wishes and fears.\n\nHis philosophy of looking at the spiritual aspects of death, rather than the biology, meant he focused on the patient instead of the disease, which was a humble approach that inspired a generation of medical students and caregivers. Apart from his clinical work, Dr. Henteleff collaborated on the first study of depression and suicidal thinking in terminal illness, and co-piloted studies that helped to create the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy in 1991.\n\nFollowing his retirement at 60 years old, he became founding president of the Canadian Palliative Care Association and head of what is now Palliative Manitoba. His steadfast leadership helped to make end-of-life care a core service in this province and influenced the direction of clinical and research programs across Canada. In recognition of his many accomplishments, he has earned several awards, including the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nUnafraid to tackle a controversial issue, Dr. Henteleff currently advises Dying with Dignity Canada, which promotes physician-assisted death as a compassionate response to those desperate for a release from suffering.\n\nHis courageous stance and his dedication to bringing light to patients in their darkest hours have helped Canadians explore the most challenging and intimate issues of life and death. He is a physician, administrator, and scientist of immense integrity.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to bestow upon Dr. Paul Henteleff a Doctor of Science, honoris causa, for creating a legacy of care in Manitoba and across our nation.\n\nSusan Lewis\n\nC.M.; O.M.; B.A.(Man.)\n\nBorn and raised in Winnipeg, Ms. Susan Lewis gained a deep appreciation of community when she began working for, and volunteering with, social service organizations. She learned the value of providing opportunities for others, and our communities are richer for it.\n\nWhile earning her arts degree at the University of Manitoba in the 1960s, she worked at Marymound, an agency in Winnipeg, helping girls close to her own age in need of a safe and caring environment. As her empathy for others grew, she realized she wanted to pursue a career that would enable her to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\nMs. Lewis joined United Way of Winnipeg in 1973 and a year later became the first female United Way campaign director in the country. In 1985, she became the organization’s president and Chief Executive Officer, again breaking ground as the first woman to do so in Canada. Along the way, she has been a highly respected leader and mentor within the United Way movement across Canada and in the United States. She stepped down in 2014 after a distinguished career with United Way of Winnipeg. Under her leadership, the organization transformed from primarily a fundraising organization to a change-maker that improves lives and builds a better community for all.\n\nMs. Lewis developed a model for community involvement known as Journey Forward, focused on engaging the public in identifying the most pressing issues and mobilizing leaders from all sectors in a collective effort towards finding solutions. Her ingenuity and vision have played a crucial role in enhancing much-needed social services to all parts of the city. She spearheaded the construction of the new United Way headquarters with the intention that it should contribute to the city’s core area community, as well as support the revitalization of Winnipeg’s downtown.\n\nMs. Lewis believes change is impossible without outstanding leaders and dedicated individuals working their “everyday magic” of voluntarism together. One of her proudest achievements is the creation of the Winnipeg Poverty Reduction Council in 2006, bringing together senior leaders from all sectors in a comprehensive and sustained effort to finally put an end to poverty in this city.\n\nIn 2011, Ms. Lewis received the Order of Manitoba and in 2015, was honoured with the Order of Canada. She views philanthropy as an opportunity, a chance to invest in one’s own community, and her commitment to bringing communities together reminds us that each one of us can make a difference.\n\nFor her tireless work helping those in need and as an outstanding example of leadership and altruism at the highest level, the University of Manitoba is proud to bestow upon Ms. Susan Lewis a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa.\n\nWilton Littlechild\n\nC.M.; Q.C.; I.P.C.; F.P.; B.A., M.A., LL.B.(Alta.); LL.D.(Alta.)(Leth.)\n\nAn advocate, a lawyer and a former Member of Parliament, Chief Wilton Littlechild has advanced the rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada and around the world.\n\nHe saw his role as a Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to contribute to building a better country, one that is inclusive for all. A Survivor of the Residential School System and father of three, Chief Littlechild believes in fostering forgiveness while educating Canadians of today and tomorrow.\n\nWith great heart and spirit, he travelled the country to hear the stories of other Survivors. As a young boy he lived with his grandparents, who helped instill within him a deep connection to his Cree culture, including its language and sacred ceremonies. His grandfather was Chief of the Ermineskin Cree Nation for more than three decades and taught his grandson about the importance of strengthening the community you call home.\n\nChief Littlechild knows first-hand the trauma of being forced into Residential School, along with the abuse, cultural disparagement, and longing for his family. He found solace in sports and says that was how he survived the devastating 14 year ordeal.\n\nHe would go on to compete internationally in hockey, baseball and swimming, winning more than 70 championships at various levels. An exceptional athlete, he pursued this passion in university, graduating with a Bachelor of Physical Education in 1967 from the University of Alberta and securing a master’s degree eight years later. Knowing the positive power of sport, he helped to found the North American Indigenous Games and the World Indigenous Nations Games and has been inducted into seven Sports Halls of Fame. Chief Littlechild earned a law degree in 1976 and became the first Indigenous lawyer in Alberta; he was also among the first Indigenous members of the Canadian Parliament.\n\nAs an MP for Wetakiwin-Rimby from 1988 to 1993, he served on several senior committees and was a parliamentary delegate to the United Nations. He was tireless in his efforts to ensure Indigenous peoples achieve the rights and recognition that is theirs on the international stage.\n\nIn 1999, he was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada. A true leader, he has been recognized with appointments as the Honorary Chief of the Maskwacis Cree and as the International Chief for the Treaty No. 6 Confederacy. He was also elected as the Regional Chief for the three Treaty territories in 2006 and more recently awarded the Alberta Order of Excellence and named a recipient of the Saskatchewan Distinguished Service Award.\n\nFrom his law firm in his home community of Ermineskin Reserve in Alberta, Chief Littlechild continues to advocate for the implementation of the Treaties and champion the rights of Indigenous peoples.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to bestow upon Chief Wilton Littlechild a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, for his advocacy and leadership.\n\nHeather M. Reisman\n\nC.M.; LL.D.(Ryerson), (W. Laur.), (Mt.All.), (St.FX.)\n\nMs. Heather M.

In 1979, she co-founded Paradigm Consulting, the world’s first strategic change consultancy. As managing director, Ms. Reisman pioneered strategies that remain the standard for organizations today.\n\nA voracious reader since childhood, Ms. Reisman eventually followed her passion by launching Indigo Books & Music with the goal of creating a book lovers’ cultural department store that would inspire, inform and indulge customers. Five years later, she bought out her biggest competitor, Chapters, Inc., to become the largest book, gift and specialty toy retailer in Canada.\n\nWith more than 200 stores across Canada and a large e-commerce platform, Ms. Reisman is arguably the most influential figure in the Canadian book industry and ranks among the world’s most powerful businesswomen. She also distinguished herself as a former policy adviser to the federal Liberals, and as a major philanthropist together with her husband, entrepreneur Gerald Schwartz.\n\nMs. Reisman dedicates herself to global challenges, working relentlessly to improve literacy, health and well-being in Canada and around the world. She has spoken out about and invested in a wide range of issues, including underfunded school libraries, violence against women and society’s overconsumption of sugar. Proud of her Jewish heritage, she commits millions of dollars to Canada’s Jewish communities and in various charitable causes aimed at strengthening the bond between Canada and Israel.\n\nMs. Reisman is the Canadian Steering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group, an annual meeting of the world’s business, political, military and financial leaders. In addition, she serves on the boards of many organizations, including Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Onex Corporation, and has previously served as a Governor of the Toronto Stock Exchange and McGill University.\n\nHer achievements and philanthropy have earned her many accolades, including four honorary doctorates and numerous business awards. In 2012, Ms. Reisman received this country’s most prestigious honour when she was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada.

Schwartz. He grew up in Winnipeg’s River Heights neighbourhood and studied business at the University of Manitoba. He earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1962 and a law degree in 1966. After articling with Israel Asper, he practiced corporate and tax law in Winnipeg before pursuing a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University in 1970.\n\nDuring his ten years away from home, he worked first at the New York brokerage firm, Estabrook & Company, and later at Bear Stearns & Co. In 1977, he returned to Canada and, with Mr. Asper, co-founded CanWest Capital, which later became CanWest Global Communications, one of the country’s largest media companies.\n\nMr. Schwartz was one of the first to introduce leveraged buyouts in Canada, and in 1983, he founded Onex Corporation, serving as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Over the years, Onex has acquired hundreds of undervalued companies, including Beatrice Foods, Celestica Inc. and Loews Cineplex, transforming them into successful operations. Through his prodigious skill and leadership, Onex has grown into one of the world’s most respected private equity firms with more than 146,000 employees worldwide and $24 billion in global revenue.\n\nA staunch ally of Israel, Mr. Schwartz has built a reputation as this country’s largest financial supporter of Jewish charities and advocacy groups in Canada and Israel. Together with his wife, entrepreneur Ms. Heather Reisman, he has also donated millions of dollars to health, education, literacy, politics and human rights, driven by a keen sense of public service and a feeling of responsibility to help those less fortunate.

Wouters\n\nP.C.; B.Comm.(Sask.); M.A.(Queen’s); LL.D.(Sask.)\n\nDuring a distinguished career in public service spanning nearly four decades, former Clerk of the Privy Council, The Honourable Wayne Wouters helped to shape a stronger Canada.\n\nHe did so with the utmost humility and respect for others, tenets he learned from his parents growing up on the family farm in small town Edam, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Honourable Wayne Wouters played an influential role in many of the important public policy decisions of the last decade, and informed major government-led initiatives as Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister, Secretary to the Cabinet, and Head of the Public Service. He directed complex institutional transformations, enhanced Canada’s international trade relations and, as Secretary of the Treasury Board, oversaw an annual budget exceeding $250 billion.\n\nHis career in public service began in 1977 with the Government of Saskatchewan. With a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Saskatchewan and a Master’s in Economics from Queen’s University, The Honourable Wayne Wouters held several positions at the provincial level before moving to Ottawa in 1982 to join the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources as Director of Industry Analysis.\n\nRecognized for his ability to achieve transformational change, The Honourable Wayne Wouters moved up through the ranks, accepting greater responsibilities and bringing his expertise to a diverse range of portfolios. As Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet, he led the expenditure reduction plan that in 1995 brought the federal budget back into a surplus for the first time in years.\n\nHe was not afraid to tread into unfamiliar waters. Despite coming from a landlocked province, his first appointment as a Deputy Minister was with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. He would also serve as Deputy Minister of Labour, of the Canada Employment Insurance Commission, and of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.\n\nIn 2009 he was appointed Clerk of the Privy Council, the country’s top post in public service. Throughout his career, The Honourable Wayne Wouters knew the importance of not only having a clear vision but also offering mentorship along the way.\n\nHe guided 450,000 employees into the digital era and inspired a new spirit of collaboration with the development of Blueprint 2020, a ground-breaking consultation process to create a more transparent public service. The Honourable Wayne Wouters championed a more open style of leadership and set his own example by communicating extensively to front-line workers and inviting feedback.\n\nHe reinforces the link between public service, the public good and personal giving. His contribution to building a stronger Canada extends to his volunteerism; he became the first public servant to chair the United Way Campaign in the nation’s capital.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 2014, The Honourable Wayne Wouters was sworn in as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council of Canada, a rare honour for an unelected government official that recognizes his outstanding service to Canadians.\n\nThe University of Manitoba is proud to award a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, to The Honourable Wayne Wouters, a visionary who has been tireless in his work for others.\n\nChantal St-Cyr Hébert\n\nO.C.; B.A.(York); LL.D.(Bishops, York, W.Ont., Concordia)\n\nOne of Canada’s most influential journalists, Ms. Chantal St-Cyr Hébert’s reportage and commentary have profoundly shaped the way Canadians understand their government, their country, and their place in global society. Guided by integrity, skepticism and a challenger’s mind, Ms. Hébert has promoted and protected our democracy through her insightful questioning of the status quo. The University of Manitoba is proud to recognize her with an Honorary Doctor of Science.\n\nMs. Hébert is a national affairs writer with the Toronto Star, a guest columnist for L’Actualité, and a regular voice on the At Issue political panel on CBC’s The National. She is also a panelist on Les Coulisses du Pouvoir and C’est pas trop tôt on Radio-Canada.\n\nMs. Hébert’s distinguished career began in 1975 when she reported for Radio-Canada in Toronto. Her understanding of politics and determination to promote public discourse quickly landed her on Parliament Hill where she also served as parliamentary bureau chief for Le Devoir and La Presse.\n\n“You could tell from the get-go that she was good—and that she was going to be really good,” Peter Mansbridge, CBC news anchor, told the Ryerson Review of Journalism about a young Ms. Hébert. Mansbridge later made Hébert a regular on the At Issue panel and now calls her the group’s lynchpin.\n\nA Senior Fellow of Massey College at the University of Toronto, she holds numerous honorary degrees from Canadian universities and is the recipient of two Asia-Pacific media fellowships. In 2005 she received the APEX Public Service Award, and in 2006 the Hy Solomon Award for excellence in journalism and public policy. In 2012 she became an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in 2014 her column Politique in L’Actualité won gold at the National Magazine Awards.\n\nHer 2007 political affairs book, French Kiss: Stephen Harper’s Blind Date with Quebec, explores the fall of the Liberal party and the rise of the Conservative party in that province. It was short listed for the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction in 2008.\n\nHer latest book, The Morning After, investigates the 1995 Quebec Referendum by asking a simple question: What would the different party leaders have done if the ‘Yes’ vote won? Published in September 2014, it is described as being a “sly, insightful and wonderfully original book…that cleverly expose[s] the fractures, tensions and fears that continue to shape Canada today.”\n\nBorn into a francophone family in Ottawa, raised in Hull and Toronto and educated at York University, she is a rare bilingual political columnist. She has acquired and nurtured the ability to assess and critique our cultural and political landscapes, reporting on them with passion and courage. As Allan Gregg, pollster and frequent panelist on CBC, told the Ryerson Review of Journalism: “She is the most influential journalist in the press gallery right now….When she says something, when she writes something—English and French—all her colleagues pay attention.”\n\nShe is undoubtedly one of the best-known and trusted political pundits in our country. In her three decades of commentary and investigative journalism, Ms. Hébert has explained, documented and argued the finer points of constitutional struggles, free trade, parliamentary politics, and First Nations concerns, among others.\n\nShe is bold. She is astute. She is a rebel. The University of Manitoba is proud to bestow Ms. Hébert with one of its highest honours, a Doctor of Science, honoris causa.\n\nHubert Kleysen\n\nInventor, entrepreneur, family man, philanthropist, leader. Hubert Kleysen has embodied all these roles and more throughout his life and successful career in the transportation industry. Mr. Kleysen built a small family-run business into one of the largest trucking companies in Manitoba. In 2006, he sold that company, Kleysen Transport, to the Mullen Income Fund and now serves as Chairman of Kleysen Inc.\n\nAs his company continued to grow, Mr. Kleysen always maintained a hands-on approach that often found him checking a truck, chatting with a mechanic or acting as a mentor to those who worked for him.\n\nA firm believer in education, Mr. Kleysen was an early supporter of logistics courses at the University of Manitoba in the 1990s. These small beginnings eventually led to the founding of the Department of Supply Chain Management at the I.H. Asper School of Business, the Logistics and Transport major in the Bachelor of Commerce (Hons.) and the Master of Science programs in Transport and Logistics. In 2008, he established the Kleysen Transport Award for the top graduate in the Certificate in Logistics program, and he continues to support undergraduates in the Logistics and Transport program through a bursary program he recently established.\n\nAs a business leader and innovator, Mr. Kleysen has provided a livelihood for thousands of Canadians and has contributed to Canada’s productivity and competitiveness. From new ways of loading freight, to finding a new market for what was previously a waste by-product of the potash mines, Mr. Kleysen is a visionary who has helped grow the Canadian economy. As a philanthropist, Mr. Kleysen’s generosity has contributed to the fabric of our society, and for more than 50 years he has supported or served on the boards of numerous organizations.\n\nWhether it’s organizing the Parade of Lights or chairing the Breakthrough Capital Campaign for the Health Sciences Centre Foundation, Mr. Kleysen has a proven track record as an involved and compassionate leader in his community.\n\nHis generosity and leadership has been recognized with numerous honours. In 2002, Mr. Kleysen was awarded the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal and in 2012 he received the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal for his contributions to his community. In 2008, he was the St. Ignatian Challenge Award recipient at St. Paul’s High School, where he chaired a major fundraising campaign.\n\nFew people have made such a positive impact on their industry and their community as Hubert Kleysen. He is still actively involved in his community, generously sharing his time and expertise for anyone who needs it. The University of Manitoba is proud to honour him with an Honorary Doctor of Laws.\n\nWayne R. Anderson\n\nB.S.A.(Man.); M.B.A.(York)\n\nA champion of the University of Manitoba’s vision and mission, Wayne Anderson has invested himself in the governing of the University of Manitoba community to such an extent that in 2008 he received the Peter D. Curry Chancellor's Award in recognition of his service. He is again recognized today with an Honorary Doctor of Laws.\n\nMr. Anderson was born in Winnipeg and graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1963 with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, a suiting degree: after he earned his MBA from York University in 1968 he became actively involved in his family’s cattle operation. He continued this farm work as he carved a path into Winnipeg’s business community. He has been a self-employed entrepreneur for most of the last forty years.\n\nIn 1973, Mr. Anderson was named President and General Manager of General Window Products of Canada Ltd. In 1981, he became President of Bonar Plastics Western Ltd. He remained there until 1993, when he became President at St. Boniface Pallet Co., a position he still holds today. He was Vice-President of Hillside Farms Manitoba Ltd. from 1963 until 2003, and from 1993 to 2003 he was Chairman of the Manitoba Horse Racing Commission. He also served as a Director on the Board of the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association for eighteen years, including three years as Chair. Multi-tasking has always been his strength: while a student here he was a hockey player for both Agriculture and the U of M Bisons, he was a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity and served on the Agriculture Student Council.\n\nIn 1998, Mr. Anderson was elected to the University of Manitoba’s Board of Governors as a Representative of the Graduates. He was re-elected in 2001 and 2004. He served as Vice-Chair from September 2000 to June 2002, and elected as Chair of the Board of Governors in June 2002, the same year he was awarded the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal. He served as Chair of the Board with great integrity for four years and then remained on the Board until May 2007.\n\nHe is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, an independent \"think tank\". He is also, since 2009, the Chair of the St. Boniface Hospital’s Board of Directors and continues to be an integral part of the University of Manitoba community: since 1999 he has been a member of the U of M’s Trust and Endowment Committee.\n\nMr. Anderson is an example of the visionary and caring leaders the University of Manitoba has been shaping since 1877. He has enhanced his community, enriching its people and their connections to one another. He has committed his life to preserving and growing these bonds and the University of Manitoba honours him today for defending and promoting the community’s good.\n\nElder Harry Bone\n\nB.A.(Brandon)\n\nElder Harry Bone has worked tirelessly and quietly throughout his life to bolster Indigenous rights. He serves as a source of inspiration to the Faculty of Medicine, which shares his goal of improving the lives of Indigenous peoples by respecting their individual and collective rights. He is awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Manitoba for working with respect and humility toward this honourable end.\n\nHe is a member of the Keeseekoowenin Ojibway Nation, where he served as a Chief and Director of Education. He also worked as a CEO at the West Region Tribal Council and as a Director of the Manitoba Indian Education Authority. While a graduate student in political studies at the University of Manitoba he was a Student Advisor and Lecturer. Elder Bone was also a Director of Native Programs for the Federal Government and he served as a Vice-President of Aboriginal Cultural Centres of Canada\n\nElder Bone is currently a member of the Elders Council, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and the Treaty Relations Commission. Through the Treaty Relations Commission, he has been active in working with the Manitoba and federal governments, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Manitoba First Nations Education Resource Centre on the Treaty Education Initiative. This initiative develops Treaty-education resources for K-12 teachers to help them introduce treaties and traditional laws and knowledge to their students.\n\nElder Bone’s expertise in First Nations governance at the community level is well regarded. He has led delegations that have met with all levels of government and has been instrumental in furthering many projects for the benefit all Manitobans, such as the Oral History Project and the Historical Atlas of First Nations in Manitoba.\n\nElder Bone and Elder Doris Pratt co-authored Untuwe Pi Kin He - Who We Are: Treaty Elders’ Teachings Volume, a book that documents the traditional laws and customs of Indigenous peoples in Manitoba in a way that is accessible to all interested readers; it is not a revision of history but rather a retelling of history from Indigenous historians, giving them an opportunity to reclaim words and inject new power into them. Like Elder Bone, the book aims to inspire people through compassion, reason, humility and human dignity.\n\nThe University of Manitoba honours Elder Bone for his tireless and trendsetting work that advances Aboriginal education in Canada.\n\nMargaret Conrad\n\nO.C.; B.A.(Hons.)(Acadia); M.A., Ph.D.(Tor.); D.HumL.(Acadia)(Mt.St.Vin.); F.R.S.C.\n\nHistorians possess a quiet and immeasurable power: they preserve our stories, stories that define a nation, a gender, a region and its peoples, or all. To re-evaluate facts, to reimagine history, takes a visionary rebel and Dr. Margaret Conrad is an example of one. Her work in two areas has been particularly valuable: history seen from the point of view of women's role and participation, and a re-conceptualization of Atlantic Canada's history, both as a region and an essential element of Canada. What is particularly inspiring about Dr. Conrad is that she fulfills the broadest possible spectrum of the humanities tradition – as a teacher, an advisor, a thinker, a writer and a citizen activist. In celebration of the contributions she has made to our understanding of history, the University of Manitoba is proud to bestow upon her an Honorary Doctor of Laws.\n\nBorn in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Dr. Conrad received a Bachelor of Arts from Acadia University in 1967, and then studied at the University of Toronto, earning her Ph.D. in 1979. Elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1995, Dr. Conrad received both the Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee Medals, and was appointed Officer of the Order of Canada in 2004.\n\nDr. Conrad taught at Acadia University for many years where she helped to found Atlantis: a Women’s Studies Journal as well as the Planter Studies Centre, which explored the history of eighteenth-century migrations to the Maritimes. In 2002, she was awarded a Canada Research Chair in Atlantic Canada Studies at the University of New Brunswick. In that capacity, she probed the potential of Humanities Computing through the highly innovative Atlantic Canada Portal. Of the nine scholarly books she has written, Atlantic Canada: A Region in the Making, which she co-authored with James K. "
