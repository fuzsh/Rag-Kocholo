        "text": "Great faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nLakehead University is amazing.\n\nThe campus is very well designed and it has a vibrant atmosphere. It's located in the middle of the city, so there is always something to do here. The professors are all very qualified. They are very passionate about their subjects, which is great. I think the students here are really open-minded and kind. The campus life is great. There are a lot of clubs and groups to join, so I've been able to sign up for a lot of interesting events. I have also been able to meet a lot of cool people. On the whole, I really like Lakehead University and I think it's a great place to get a higher education.\n\nGreat faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nVery engaging classroom environment\n\nI originally chose Lakehead University for the unique campus dynamic that exists on the Thunder Bay Campus. Lakehead seemed to just fit. The small campus proved to have a bright future ahead, and I was ready to be a part of it as it grew. What I like best about Lakehead is being a part of a smaller, more engaging classroom environment. Professors and instructors actually care about your academic success, which motivates you to work harder. As a result, I am able to participate more actively in class and contribute to meaningful discussions as a result of the atmosphere. What I enjoy most about being a student at Lakehead is the sense of belonging to such a welcoming community, which makes me glad to be a part of it. With so many diverse student-run clubs and activities that continue to grow, student life on campus is thriving right now. The natural aspect of the Lakehead University campus appeals to me. Among other things, I've worked with the Student Union, the Alumni Association, and Recruitment, as well as serving as an Orientation Leader. The on-campus accommodation is excellent, and it is well-maintained and modern. Take advantage of one of Canada's most generous university scholarship programs. This institute comes highly recommended by me.\n\nGreat faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nQuality education\n\nI have gained the knowledge and skills that helped me develop my future career. All the passionate teachers were kind and well prepared for sharing their knowledge and experience with us. They always provided us with amazing opportunities and challenges that kept us motivated. The placement department helped me bag the first job that I applied for. Getting a chance to get involved in cross-cultural interaction has been an amazing learning experience and helped me enhance my skills. Take advantage of one of Canada's most generous college scholarship programs to help you pay for your university degree and focus on your studies. The college is committed to providing a safe and secure learning and working environment for students and staff.\n\nGreat faculty\n\nAmazing Infrastructure\n\nInvolved even after we leave\n\nThe college is at a convenient location. The location was a highlight with its beautiful surroundings. Other than that, the college has great teachers and professors. They taught in amazing ways. We had access to the fitness centre and its activities. Thankful for an experience like that. I met people who belonged to different countries and made friends. Some of them are working with me. I am happy I chose the college. The alumni are rewarded and involved in events."
