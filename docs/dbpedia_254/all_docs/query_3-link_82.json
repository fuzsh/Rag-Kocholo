        "text": "Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont. – Ontario University Athletics (OUA) celebrated the 2023-24 Honour Awards Banquet on Wednesday, May 15th, with Brock’s Sara Rohr and Guelph’s Max Davies being named athletes of the year.\n\nAthlete of the Year – Sara Rohr, Brock Badgers\n\nRoaring into her senior season, Sara Rohr put on a show to lead her OUA champion women’s volleyball team to continued conference success, and in doing so, also becomes the third Brock Badger to earn athlete of the year honours (Kate Allgood, 2005-06; Aaron Pomery, 1995-96).\n\nA fifth-year setter from Milton, Ont., who is in grad school at Brock University, put the cherry on top of her varsity tenure by outdoing even her lofty career numbers.\n\nShe finished first in the province this season with 10.90 assists per set, good for a full two assists more than the next player on the list. That mark was also good for second in U SPORTS and helped bring her career per set average to 9.30. With an OUA-leading 643 total assists on the year, Rohr also surpassed former Badger Ally Fast to become the program’s all-time leader with 2,677 assists. She also finishes her time in the OUA with over 500 digs.\n\nThe OUA player of the year – just the second Brock standout to earn the honour – and first team all-star thrived in St. Catharines, and for a third consecutive season, helped lead her team to the Quigley Cup title, finishing with 42 assists and 15 digs in the championship game.\n\nAthlete of the Year – Max Davies, Guelph Gryphons\n\nAn endurance runner from Toronto, Ont., Max Davies was a force to be reckoned with any time he stepped up to the start line this season for the Guelph Gryphons.\n\nDavies did just about all that he could on the track this season as a member of the national champion Gryphons squad. The OUA track athlete of the year and of the meet for the 2024 Championships, was a standout therein, collecting three gold medals across the two day event. He paced the pack in the 1000m, the 1500m, and as part of the 4x800m relay.\n\nHis impressive efforts continued onto the national stage, with the podium-topping performances and accolades rolling along. He set a U SPORTS record while winning gold in the 1000m, before doing the same in the 1500m a day later to break a 34-year old mark. Like at the OUA finale, meanwhile, he would round out his championship outing running the anchor leg for the gold-medal winning 4x800m relay team. For his efforts, Davies was once again named track athlete of the meet and of the year at the national level, while helping to lead his Guelph team to their 10th national title in program history.\n\nBefore even hitting the track, however, Davies was also a key figure in the Gryphons’ cross country success. He was a first team OUA all-star following his second-place individual finish at the conference championships in October, which also helped score his side the 2023 title, and would add second team All-Canadian honours to his resume at the national race.\n\nThis marks the ninth time a Guelph student-athletes has earned OUA athlete of the year honours.\n\nTeam of the Year – Carleton Ravens, Women’s Basketball\n\nThe 2023-24 Carleton Ravens women’s basketball team will go down as one of the program’s best all-time after doubling down on what was already an astounding year prior.\n\nQuickly adding themselves to the lore of the of the great Ravens basketball programs, this year’s edition led the nation in scoring with 1,774 points, averaging 80 per contest. The black birds also held their opponents under 50 points on 12 occasions, while limiting their competitors to a league-low 30.8% shooting from the field. The top-seeded squad parlayed these potent numbers into a nearly unblemished record, dropping just one regular season game before reeling off a 12-game winning streak heading into the playoffs.\n\nAmazingly, the Carleton crew found yet another gear in their quest for the Critelli Cup, sweeping their OUA postseason contests by an average margin of victory of more than 16 points per game. This dominance was also featured in their Critelli Cup rematch with the Queen’s Gaels, who the Ravens once again overcame to secure their second straight OUA title.\n\nMuch like last year, the conference champs continued their momentum onto the national stage. Led by U SPORTS Final 8 MVP Kali Pocrnic, the Ravens reeled off a 17-point win over Fraser Valley, a 34-point victory over the Gaels, and a thrilling 70-67 triumph in the championship game over Saskatchewan to cap off their 2023-24 campaign as back-to-back U SPORTS champions.\n\nTeam of the Year – Queen’s Gaels, Men’s Basketball\n\nKingston local Cole Syllas dribbled up court in the dying seconds of the Wilson Cup. The Queen’s guard let it fly from beyond the arc. It banked in as the buzzer sounded, and the rest is history.\n\nAs part of their 2023-24 campaign, the Queen’s Gaels men’s basketball team produced iconic moments and results that will forever be linked to their most successful season in program history. Before even making it to the OUA finale, the team produced a program-best 19-3 mark in the regular season and earned the top seed in their quest for a Wilson Cup. They turned that No. 1 spot into a championship run, and despite not holding a lead until that final shot of the conference finale against the Brock Badgers, were able to turn that mesmerizing Syllas buzzer-beater into their first OUA championship since 1956-57.\n\nThe run of success didn’t stop there either, as they continued on to the U SPORTS Men’s Final 8 for a third straight season. They took down Winnipeg and Ottawa, respectively, to secure themselves a spot in the gold medal game, and while they ultimately left as runners up to host Laval, the Gaels once again set a new mark for the program as national silver medalists.\n\nThis is the first time that a group from Queen’s has been tabbed as the OUA team of the year.\n\nCoach of the Year – Dani Sinclair, Carleton Ravens\n\nThe Carleton Ravens women’s basketball team not only saw success on the court, but on the sidelines as well thanks to the team’s award-winning bench boss, Dani Sinclair.\n\nSince joining the Ravens program in 2020, Sinclair has continued to help the Ravens soar. Now in her third season behind the bench, the former varsity standout and long-time coach herself led the Ravens to an OUA-best 21-1 record in the regular season, sustaining a string of success right from the season’s opening tip.\n\nDespite entering the year as defending champions and anticipating the opposition’s best night in and night out, Sinclair’s squad were as consistently dominant as they came all year. They were the top-ranked team in the country for eight of the year’s 12 rankings, a run which was capped off by her second consecutive Critelli Cup and national championship.\n\nRecipient of the OUA women’s basketball coach of the year, Sinclair’s Ravens shone collectively and individually, with the decorated coach getting the best out of several of her players. Pocrnic, Carleton’s co-athlete of the year, produced a first team all-star season; Tatyanna Burke collected second team all-star honours and was the U SPORTS championship game MVP; and Kyana-Jade Poulin was named a Final 8 tournament all-star.\n\nSinclair’s OUA coach of the year nod marks the sixth such accolade for the Carleton Ravens overall.\n\nCoach of the Year – Steph Barrie, Queen’s Gaels\n\nAfter leading his Queen’s men’s basketball team to their best finish in program history, Steph Barrie joins a list of six other Gaels bench bosses to be named OUA coach of the year.\n\nComing into the 2023-24 season as the reigning OUA coach of the year, the ___ coach was able to outdo himself in helping the Gaels reach new heights on the hardwood. Barrie led the Gaels to an OUA-best 19 wins on the year, paced by a second-ranked offence and defence, scoring 86.9 points per game and surrendering just 71.4 points against per contest. The latest marks continued the team’s upward trajectory since the pandemic, and helped them reach the national championship tournament for the third straight season and win their first Wilson Cup in nearly 70 years.\n\nIn addition to the team’s collective success at both the provincial and national level, Barrie also saw tremendous individual efforts from his 2023-24 squad, which included a defensive player of the year nod and first team all-star selection for Luka Syllas and a second team selection for his brother Cole.\n\nBeyond their stats on the court, however, the now back-to-back OUA men’s basketball coach of the year stresses the importance of being high-character individuals before focusing on basketball, and challenges his student-athletes to put others first in everything that they do. One of the ways he helps them make such strides in their lives is through weekly group talks called ‘Personal Growth Mondays’.\n\nJ.P.
