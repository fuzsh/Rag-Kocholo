        "text": "Phase 2: Terminology, Taxonomy, and Ontology Development\n\nThree independent meetings of Sub-committee A and one joint meeting with Sub-committee B were held via an online meeting platform between April and May of 2020, during which five possible ontology models were developed based on the synthesized evidence from the scoping review. From June to August 2020, the five ontology models were merged into one holistic, over-arching ontology model. The initial draft of the model was circulated to the Sub-committees A and B in early September 2020 for their feedback and to ensure the model captured the key aspects from the five ontology models. This model was further circulated to the Steering Committee in mid-September 2020 for feedback and to fill any expertise gaps.\n\nThe goal for the ontology model was to capture all aspects of activities that occur in outdoor spaces, for all ages, and represent their relationship with one another. In addition, while highlighting the key aspects of PLaTO, other relevant and related concepts (e.g., work, commute, recreate) were incorporated into the model as a way of acknowledging the broad range of activities that occur outdoors and the way they are interrelated with PLaTO. We also sought to create a model that was as inclusive as possible for all ages, genders, cultures, and abilities. The initial model reflected the general concept of ecological modelling, where multiple factors in different domains are positioned in layers, emphasizing the importance of interrelatedness, but also introducing patterns of hierarchy.\n\nThe initial model (see Additional File 4: PLaTO-Net Global Harmonization Project – Membership Consultation Questionnaire page 3/12) was circular in shape with five concentric rings. In this model, the center ring denoted the context, “who, where, when, why, and how.” The second ring indicated the dynamicism of these contexts using the following action verbs: playing, learning, teaching, working, recreating, being/connecting, and socializing. The third ring indicated general/thematic activities that are performed outdoors using the following terms: education, work, spiritual pursuits, and leisure. The fourth ring indicated the main setting of interest “outdoors.” Lastly, the outermost ring indicated influences on, and consequences of, outdoor activities using the following terms: social, cultural, political, geographical, and climatic. The five rings were interpreted as circulating around each other to indicate the dynamicity and fluidity within and between rings. Edges between each ring were also purposefully blurred to highlight the interconnectivity of terms and acknowledge that there may be other terms/concepts not included in the model. However, given a lack of consensus on this initial model within the Round 1 consultation survey (see Phase 3: Global Membership Consultation), the project leaders opted to hire a graphic designer to develop a new model and logo that better captured all aspects of activities that occur in outdoor spaces and their relation to one other. For a full description of the final ontology model and logo, see Figs. and , respectively.\n\nFour independent meetings of Sub-committee B and one joint meeting with Sub-committees A and B were held in Phase 2 to refine the 428 terms found in the scoping review in Phase 1. Members consolidated congruent terms and developed agreed upon definitions for these. Through discussions on relevance, accuracy, and redundancy, 36 key terms and definitions were selected for further consideration. Of those, nine terms were considered relevant to outdoor play (i.e., outdoor play as its own separate term, free play, land-based play, nature play, risky play, free-flow play, outdoor recess/break time, active play, social play), eight terms were relevant to outdoor learning (i.e., outdoor learning as its own separate term, nature-based learning, land-based learning, place-based learning, environmental learning, informal learning, learning–or education– outside the classroom, service learning), six terms were related to outdoor teaching/education (i.e., outdoor teaching, outdoor education, nature-based education, place-based education, adventure-based education, environmental education), and 10 terms were related to the outdoors as a setting (i.e., home range, nature, natural environment, built environment, green schoolyards, outdoor play space, nature play spaces, playground, nature playground, garden). Additionally, three school-related terms (i.e., outdoor school, forest school, nature school) were also included during Phase 2.\n\nPhase 3: International Membership Consultation\n\nPhase 3 comprised of four rounds (Rounds 1–4) of PLaTO-Net membership consultation surveys using the Delphi approach [40]. All four surveys can be found in Additional File 4. The initial invitation to participate in the membership survey included 395 PLaTO-Net members. Based on the draft of the initial ontology model and key terms identified during Phases 1 and 2, the Round 1 consultation survey went out to the PLaTO-Net membership on October 16, 2020, and the follow-up consultation surveys (Rounds 2–4) went out on January 11, March 5, and May 26, 2021. A total of 132 members completed the first survey, and 85, 62, and 70 members participated in the follow-up surveys, respectively. Among those, 52 members participated in all four surveys (including the members of the Steering Committee), eight participated in three surveys, 23 participated in two surveys, and 48 members participated in one survey. Overall, survey participants represented 36 countries with varying cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds, working in relevant fields as researchers, educators, practitioners, and government employees, with the majority (68.2%) having ≥ 10 years of experience in the relevant areas. Of the 132 members who completed the first survey, 66.7% indicated their gender as female or woman while 33.3% indicated their gender as male or man. None of the participants self-identified as non-binary or other gender. Of the 84 who indicated their disability status, 9.7% identified as living with disability. Out of 52 members who participated in ≥ 3 surveys, 48 members have agreed to be listed as co-author and provided critical feedback on the manuscript (see Additional File 6 for information about survey participants).\n\nTable presents the results of each round of the surveys. Likability of the model with the ontology model and logo increased from Round 1 (model: 67.0%; logo: 26.5%) to Round 2 (model: 81.2%; logo: 83.5%) and levels of agreement with the final model and logo was the highest in Round 3 (i.e., 93.6% and 95.2% respectively, see Table ), indicating strong support with iterative modifications made during Rounds 1 and 2. This manuscript only presents the final versions of the ontology model (Fig. ) and logo (Fig. ). Level of agreement with the structure of the key terms was 80% in survey Round 2, achieving international consensus on the taxonomy.\n\nConsensus on terminology was achieved through three rounds of surveys (Rounds 1, 3, and 4). A total of 36 key terms included in Round 1 was based on the results of the scoping review (n = 33), as well as suggestions from the Steering Committee to include school-related terms (n = 3). Of these, eight terms were removed from Survey Round 3 due to low (< 75%) likability (indicated in red in Round 1, Table ) and six additional terms were removed despite achieving ≥ 75% of likability (indicated in green and “xx” in Round 1, Table ) as they were later identified as co-hyponyms (i.e., subordinate terms of the same superordinate term) of other terms. Five terms achieved < 75% likability but were included in Survey Round 3 based on a decision made by the members of the Steering Committee to further explore the suitability of those terms given their relevance to the project (indicated in yellow and “vv” in Round 1, Table ). In addition, 27 new terms were suggested for further consideration by survey participants (indicated as “v” in Round 1, Table ).\n\nSurvey Round 3 evaluated the suitability of 49 terms forwarded from Round 1. Of these, ≥ 75% of survey participants agreed with the inclusion of 32 terms (≥ 90% of agreement for 12 terms; 80–89% of agreement for 13 terms; 75–79% of agreement for 7 items). Additionally, four terms with < 75% agreement (i.e., loose parts, social play, outdoor time, nature-based recreation; indicated in blue in Round 4, Table ) were re-evaluated by the members of the Steering Committee based on qualitative feedback and the leadership group made the unanimous decision to include these terms in survey Round 4 for further consideration. Of the 13 terms removed during Round 3, 11 terms were originally not part of Round 1 but were suggested by survey participants while the other two terms—home range and free-flow play––received low likability during Round 1 but were forwarded to Round 3 based on expert suggestions. Qualitative feedback indicated the lack of agreement (< 75%) on 13 terms in Round 3 (indicated in red in Round 3, Table ) were mainly due to a lack of direct relevance to PLaTO (e.g., adventure therapy, wilderness therapy/treatment), overlap with other included terms or being co-hyponyms (e.g., nature-based preschool, outdoor school), or being too culturally specific (e.g., shirin yoku, friluftsliv).\n\nSurvey Round 4 aimed to achieve consensus on working definitions of 36 terms forwarded from Round 3 and four additional terms deemed to be root terms (i.e., play, teaching, learning, education). Of those, proposed definitions for 17 terms achieved a high level of agreement (≥ 90%), 12 terms achieved a moderate level of agreement (80–89%), and two terms achieved a borderline level of agreement (75–79%), while agreement with the proposed definition for three terms (i.e., nature, outdoor learning, outdoor education) was < 75% (indicated in red in Round 4, Table ). All terms and definitions were reconsidered based on both quantitative and qualitative feedback when finalizing the included terminology. For survey Round 4 alone, a total of 238 qualitative comments were provided. Among those, 82 comments were relevant to root terms, 53 to outdoor play sub-terms, 48 to outdoor education sub-terms, and seven additional terms were relevant to wording or the inclusion of other types/languages.\n\nSeveral modifications were made to the list of 40 terms and definitions by the project leaders to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative feedback from Survey Round 4 participants. Most edits were to improve clarity and inclusivity. For instance, outdoors was originally defined as: “any open-air, wild, natural, or human-made space which may have a temporary or fixed cover (e.g., awning or roof).” However, a few survey participants felt that reference to ‘a temporary or fixed cover’ confused the term while others indicated that in countries with many extreme heat days, many outdoor spaces have a fixed cover used by humans for protection. In response, the project leaders included reference to ‘a temporary or fixed cover’ as a nuance but not as part of the main definition (Table ). Also, based on several comments that there was lack of consistency among definitions of root terms and sub-terms for play, we revised the definition for root terms, so they were more encompassing of all play sub-terms. We also simplified the definitions of sub-terms to better reflect hyponymy. For instance, in the revised version, all play sub-terms started with the phrase “a form of play….” However, this change was not applied to learning, teaching, and education and their sub-terms, given the variability across the terms included in these categories. In addition, the project leaders decided to remove 13 sub-terms based on survey feedback that some terms were too broad (e.g., garden, nature) or too obvious (e.g., outdoor time, outdoor activity), and thus out of scope for this project.\n\nTable 2\n\nRoot termsaPlaTO-termsSub-termsProposed definitionSynonym/co-hyponymOutdoorsAny open-air, wild, natural, or human-made spaceNuances: The space may include a temporary or fixed cover (e.g., awning or roof) but maintain exposure to ambient environmental conditionsBuilt environmentHuman-constructed physical surroundings (e.g., structures, features, facilities) in which people live, learn, work, travel, and playGreen spaceAny vegetated land, an area of grass or trees that may also contain bodies of water (e.g., pond, creek), in an urban environmentNuances: The space may either set apart for recreational or aesthetic purposes or wasteland areas that have been colonized by nature in an otherwise urban environmentLoose partsNatural or manufactured materials with no specific set of directions that can be used alone or combined with other materials, moved, carried, combined, redesigned, lined up, and taken apart and put back together in multiple ways and used for playPlaygroundA piece of land usually equipped with facilities and/or equipment that is used for outdoor play and recreationSchool groundProprietary outdoor area on the land of educational institution buildingsSynonym: School yardNatural environmentNon-built surroundings and conditions in nature in which living and non-living things co-existSynonym: NatureGardenPlanted, developed, or cultivated land used to grow vegetables, fruit, herbs, flowers, and other living plants and organismsOutdoor play spaceAny outdoor area where people can playPlayVoluntary engagement in activity that is fun and/or rewarding and usually driven by intrinsic motivationNuances: Not all play is self-directed and intrinsically motivatedOutdoor playA form of playa that takes place outdoorsaCo-hyponym: Outdoor recreationActive playA form of playa that involves physical activity of any intensityFree playA form of playa that is unstructured and self-directedSynonym: Unstructured playNature playA form of playa that takes place in a natural environment and/or involves interaction with natural elements and features (e.g., water, mud, rocks, hills, forests, and natural loose parts, such as sticks, pinecones, leaves, and grass)Co-hyponym: Nature-based recreationRisky playA form of playa that is thrilling and exciting, which involves uncertainty, unpredictability, and varying degrees of risk-takingSocial playA form of play that involves interacting with othersLearningThe development of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habitsOutdoor learningLearninga that takes place outdoorsaTeachingThe process of facilitation of learningOutdoor teachingTeachinga that takes place outdoorsaEducationThe process of learninga and teachingaOutdoor educationEducationa that takes place outdoorsaEnvironmental educationA form of educationa aimed at increasing knowledge, awareness, and appreciation of the environmentForest schoolsAn educationala approach that includes regular and repeated access to natural space and participant-directed, emergent, and place-based learningCo-hyponym: Forest kindergartens, forest preschools, forest programsOutdoor classroomA shared space of learninga and teachinga in the school context that is entirely outdoorsNuances: Unlike outdoor education, an outdoor classroom takes regular pedagogy and curriculum outdoors in the school contextPlace-based learningLearninga that considers the importance of connecting learners with their community by anchoring pedagogy within the context of the locally natural, cultural, and social ecosystemsCo-hyponym: Place-based educationNuances: The learning focuses on a specific physical space which may or may not involve the natural environmentLand-based educationAn approach to educationa that recognizes a deep connection and relationship of reciprocity between people and the landCo-hyponym: Land-based learningNuances: This is specific to the North American context based on Indigenous epistemology of which the land is being understood beyond the physical sense and as with spiritual, emotional, and intellectual senseNature-based educationA form of teachinga and learninga situated in the context of outdoor natural settingsCo-hyponym: Nature-based learning, nature-based preschoolLearning for sustainabilityA cross-curricular approach to life and learninga which enables learners, educators, schools, and their wider communities to build a socially just, ecologically sustainable, and equitable societyOther terms related to PLaTOOutdoor activityLeisure, recreational, educational, occupational, and/or health-enhancing activity engaged in the outdoorsOutdoor timeTime spent outdoors\n\nThe revised list consisting of 27 terms and their definitions was then circulated to the Steering Committee for final feedback. Included in the document sent to the Steering Committee was a list of 13 terms originally included in Survey Round 4, but that the project leaders felt should be removed, with justification for their removal from the consensus project included. Three of these terms were removed and four terms were re-introduced as synonyms. The Steering Committee suggested the following remaining six terms be removed: garden, nature, outdoor recreation, nature-based recreation, outdoor activity, and learning for sustainability. Yet, among these, nature was removed but re-introduced as a synonym for natural environment. Outdoor recreation and nature-based recreation were re-introduced as synonyms for outdoor play and nature play, respectively. The other three terms remained in the consensus project. The project leaders decided to include garden as it is an intentional green space frequently used for play or educational purposes (e.g., school garden), and thus would be helpful to include. Outdoor activity was kept because it is often conflated with other terms (e.g., active outdoor play) included in the consensus project, and therefore should be included to provide further clarification. Learning for sustainability also remained in the consensus project because of its increasing importance for climate action.\n\nAs the last step in achieving consensus on PLaTO terminology, taxonomy, and ontology as well as the logo, the research manuscript with all relevant attachments were circulated to those who completed at least three rounds of the consultation surveys for final review and sign-off via email. Participants were also asked to respond to the questions:\n\nQuestion 1. “Do you feel your feedback has been acknowledged and considered during the consensus process?” with the following response options: “Yes”, “No”, “Unsure”, and “Other”.\n\nQuestion 2. “Has your level of agreement changed since the completion of the last survey round?” with the following response options: “Increased”, “Decreased”, “No change”, and “Other”.\n\nQuestion 3. “Will you use the outcome of this project in your future work?” with the following response options: “Yes”, “No”, “Unsure”, and “Other”.\n\nOf the 67 final co-authors, 97% answered “Yes” to Question 1, while 1.5% (n = 1) responded that they are “Unsure” and another 1.5% (n = 1) responded to “Other” with a note “I am not an expert”. For Question 2, 59.7% responded “Increased” and 40.3% responded “No change”, while no one responded “Decreased”. For Question 3, 95.5% responded that they will use the outcome of this project in their future work, while 4.5% responded “Unsure”. Non one responded to “No”. These survey results, combined with the level of agreement in consultation surveys, demonstrated that, overall, survey participants provided strong support for the final ontology, taxonomy, and terminology of PLaTO developed in this project.\n\nFinal terminology, taxonomy, and ontology\n\nThe final terminology and taxonomy of 31 terms are presented in Table . Among them, five terms (i.e., outdoors, play, learning, teaching, education) were root terms that serve as hypernyms (i.e., superordinate terms that have several subordinate terms that fall under them) for their respective sub-terms. Three PLaTO terms, namely, outdoor play, outdoor learning, and outdoor teaching as well as outdoor education, consisted of the main topics of this manuscript. The proposed definition of the hybrid term outdoor play was based on the definitions for outdoors and play (Table ). Similarly, the proposed definitions for outdoor learning, outdoor teaching, and outdoor education were determined based on the definitions of their root terms (i.e., a combination of definitions for outdoors and learning). There are also 20 sub-terms included in Table . These terms are co-hyponyms with PLaTO terms, which can also be combined with PLaTO terms to create a variety of hybrid terms. For instance, active play is defined as a form of play that involves physical activity of any intensity. Combined with outdoor play, active outdoor play can be defined as a form of play that takes place outdoors which involves physical activity of any intensity (not included in Table ). Though not part of the key aspects of this consensus project, outdoor activity and outdoor time and their definitions were also provided given these are used as overarching terms and key outcome variables in investigations relevant to PLaTO. In addition to definitions, we added nuances to better articulate subtle differences between PLaTO terms as well as synonyms and co-hyponyms identified in this project but not included as part of the defined PLaTO terms, to be as inclusive and useful as possible.\n\nThe PLaTO ontology model was developed to capture all aspects of activities, beyond PLaTO, that occur in the outdoors and their relation to one another. For the consensus project, our intention was to highlight the PLaTO terms, while incorporating other relevant concepts to recognize that all the aspects included in the model are interrelated and interconnected. It was also our intention that the model be applicable to all individuals with different identities (e.g., age, gender, culture, ability). The final ontology model is presented in Fig. .\n\nPhase 4: knowledge sharing and dissemination\n\nDuring the development stage, the PLaTO-Net online platform (https://www.outdoorplaycanada.ca/plato-net/) was launched in May 2018 and was actively promoted on social media (e.g., the Outdoor Play Canada Twitter account) as well as through Outdoor Play Canada presentations. Since its launch, there have been 2,336 visitors to the PLaTO-Net webpage from 60 different countries. The knowledge sharing of PLaTO with the public was done mainly via Twitter given its utility in sharing ideas and real time information. When the Twitter handle @PLaTO_Net was first created, five tweets were posted and attracted a total of 1.3 K impressions over the first 50-day period alone (between November 12 and December 31, 2019). Since then, four tweets and 5.6 K impressions were made between January and March 2020 and one tweet and 2.0 K impressions were made between April and June 2020. No tweets were posted between July and October 2020, but 887 impressions were earned. In November 2020, detailed timelines and contents for Twitter posts were developed (see Additional File 7). Main strategies for Twitter communications were to: 1) monitor conversations and engage with already existing communities related to PLaTO; 2) offer interactive tweets that encourage responding and retweeting; 3) promote relevant individuals, researchers, groups, and organizations to show support; and, 4) be a resource to existing and potential audiences, to ultimately help build a strong PLaTO community. A total of eight tweets were updated in November 2020 which earned 7.0 K impressions, 75 likes, 31 re-tweets without comments and 4.4% engagement rate (total engagement [the number of times people engaged with a tweet by commenting on it, liking it, retweeting it, or clicking on it for any reason] / total impressions [the total number of times a tweet was loaded in a Twitter feed] × 100). Since then, in every three-month period, the following impressions and engagement rates were recorded: 11.3 K impressions and 1.7% engagement rate (between December 2020 and February 2021), 24.5 K impressions and 1.9% engagement rate (between March and May 2021), 9.9 K impressions and 1.7% engagement rate (between June and August 12, 2021).\n\nTo reach academic audiences, the members of the Steering Committee (EL, LDL, MST, PB) delivered a symposium session at the 8th International Society for Physical Activity and Health Virtual Congress (ISPAH) in October 2021. The main goal of this symposium session was to present the overview, process, and outcome of this international, interdisciplinary collaboration project aimed at achieving international consensus on terminology, taxonomy, and ontology of PLaTO. The symposium was aired during the conference period (October 12 and 14, 2021). In addition to disseminating knowledge to a primarily academic audience, efforts to reach broader audiences are currently being planned, which include translating the PLaTO terminology, taxonomy, and ontology in different languages and making different versions available on the PLaTO-Net webpage, and delivering a series of free webinars for non-academic audiences (e.g., practitioners, educators, stakeholders, policymakers) as per requests following the publication of the results. It is important to acknowledge that even with our efforts to reach the global audience, the platforms we use may be more accessible to those who are in high-income countries. Further, knowledge sharing and dissemination plans specifically targeting audiences from low- and middle-income countries will be brainstormed during the ISPAH 2022 Congress where the launch of the Global Matrix 4.0 [41] and a general meeting for Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance (activehealthykids.org) is scheduled.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nA major strength of this consensus project was the use of a Delphi approach to develop the PLaTO terminology, taxonomy, and ontology. The systematic scoping review we conducted to summarize the evidence is another major strength; however, limitations are that the searches were restricted to children and youth aged 2–18 years and English articles only and each article was screened by one screener only. Also, the literature search for the scoping review was last done in September 2019; therefore, literature published after this time point is not reflected in this work. In addition to seeking continued input, the project also requires an update based on more recent literature in the future.\n\nAlthough it was our hope that this work represents all populations regardless of their identities (e.g., nationality, gender, age, ethnicity, ability), it is likely that, by generating universal knowledge, nuances that vary by cultures, languages, experiences, and historical perspectives may not be sufficiently represented. We also acknowledge that terminology, taxonomy, and ontology generated in this work may differ by context and will evolve over time; it is for this reason we added nuance where possible. Also, while consensus was achieved, there remained a view that using the tree analogy for the final ontology model could create more confusion due to different cultural meanings attached to the tree itself. Our work will benefit from ongoing input, and we encourage stakeholders, other academics, and the general public to join us and/or reach out through our webpage (www.outdoorplaycanada.ca/plato-net/) or Twitter (https://twitter.com/PLaTO_Net).\n\nThe selection of terms and elements included in our work was primarily based on a comprehensive review of existing literature (Phase 1 of this project) and, therefore, elements that could potentially be important and emerging may have been missed and require future consideration. For instance, blue space (e.g., lakes, rivers, oceans), wild or wilderness, and other natural elements such as desert or wind were noted by a few survey participants as important elements but not included in our work. We also acknowledge this is not the first work providing definitions for terms related to PLaTO; rather, this work builds on previous work [8, 18, 22, 29–32, 35] and comprehensively examined existing literature while actively seeking and incorporating expert opinions and feedback.\n\nDespite our efforts in seeking diverse representation for the composition of the Steering Committee, this Committee lacked perspectives from researchers or practitioners in African countries, minority cultural groups, and immigrants/refugees in high-income countries, persons living with disability, and people from gender-diverse communities. Our efforts in disseminating knowledge and seeking public feedback will intentionally target more diverse communities of people globally via multiple channels post-publication. Also, Twitter analytics provided in this work might suggest that the impact of our knowledge sharing and dissemination activities to date is trivial; however, knowledge sharing and dissemination will be done on an on-going basis post-publication. This includes enhanced curation of the PLaTO-Net webpage and moderation of the Twitter account; leveraging Steering Committee members’ networks, affiliated organizations, and social media channels; developing public relations and dissemination plans while further exploring partnerships and collaboration with different organizations related to PLaTO; translating the outcomes of this project in different languages and making it available online for free; and intentionally creating spaces where non-academic audiences can be engaged and involved. Furthermore, though the outcome of this paper is consensus-based among international experts, an alternative approach to standardizing PLaTO terminology that is scientifically sound (e.g., machine learning) and more contextually and culturally specific should also be considered and pursued. Therefore, potential knowledge users of the outcome of this work are encouraged to use our knowledge product where appropriate to the context and population under investigation.\n\nFuture research priorities\n\nDespite the robustness of our efforts, several gaps were identified that warrant future work. For example, substantial heterogeneity was observed in the qualitative feedback from survey participants for learning and teaching sub-terms. Specifically, contention existed in distinguishing outdoor classroom from outdoor education. One participant indicated that “…early adopters of the outdoor classroom may have referred to their work as outdoor education, but this pedagogical approach has evolved and is far more complex than outdoor education.” Another participant indicated that “I would not add outdoor classroom, but leave the outdoor setting open in the last term, outdoor education…outdoor classrooms tend to simply take indoor teaching/pedagogy outside.” There were also comments indicating the need for clearer contrast between outdoor learning and outdoor education. The most apparent difference is the context in which each activity occurs and who leads these activities; however, interpretations appear to differ by cultures. For instance, one survey participant from Canada suggested that outdoor learning can occur for anyone in any outdoor context whereas outdoor education is specific to the school context and is typically led by educators. Another survey participant suggested otherwise, indicating that, in the United Kingdom, outdoor education relates mainly to adventurous activities provided outside of school by specialized instructors, while outdoor learning is often school-based and led by mainstream teachers but includes independent learning in outdoor contexts. These examples demonstrate the difficulties in creating harmonized terms and definitions while accommodating different cultural nuances. Such distinctions were reflected in our definitions but need to be more clearly articulated in future work.\n\nThere still are terms that require further clarification. For example, school ground is often in a plural form, school grounds; however, we used school ground in our work for consistency with other terms that are similar in nature (e.g., playground). Loose parts were included as part of the outdoor settings in our ontology model, but the term is often used as a pedagogical approach to early childhood education that focuses on inspiring imagination and creativity [44]. There was also confusion on the relationship between play and learning. In outdoor spaces, play and learning are inextricably interrelated and intertwined, and play can serve as a vehicle for learning, particularly in the early childhood education and care context [45] wherein reference to “play-based learning” [46], “playful learning” [22] or “play-based approaches” (Nolan & Paatsch, 2017 [47]) is common. Our work was not to challenge the role of play in learning, but to assert that not all play explicitly promotes learning or has specific aims; rather, play can be non-purposeful and intrinsically motivated. Furthermore, engaging in play is not exclusive to children. People of any age can voluntarily engage in activity that is playful, fun, and/or rewarding. Our play-related terms and definitions reflect how these words can be operationalized in investigating play among adolescent and adult population groups, but the overall concept requires further development in the context of this field.\n\nDeveloping valid and reliable measurement tools for PLaTO activities is still required. For instance, accelerometers are often used to measure active outdoor play among children, however, accelerometers do not accurately detect the intensity of the range of movement that a child may engage in through play (e.g., climbing a tree). Valid and reliable measurement tools for PLaTO activities are also necessary to help clarify the links between the exposure to varying PLaTO activities and the synergistic linkages with healthy living, environmental stewardship, climate action, and planetary health. In addition to advancing measurement of PLaTO for quantitative research, more qualitative work that could complement quantitative evidence is warranted. In particular, research projects in collaboration with participants themselves as researchers would greatly benefit the field to move forward. Lastly, the terminology, taxonomy, and ontology of PLaTO should continue to evolve and transform with changing times and spaces. As a first step to address this need, PLaTO-Net will translate PLaTO terminology, taxonomy, and ontology into different languages to reflect varying contextual, cultural, and historical perspectives and practices around the outdoors.\n\nThe authors of this paper thank Libby-Lee Hammond, Shawn Marsolais, Claire Warden, Ylva Jannok Nutti, and Louise Zimanyi for serving on the Steering Committee and all survey participants, who were not able to contribute to the manuscript sufficient for authorship.
