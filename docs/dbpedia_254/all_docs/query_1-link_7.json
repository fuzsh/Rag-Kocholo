        "text": "August 2, 2024 – Orillia, Ont.\n\nDr. Linda Rodenburg has been appointed the new Principal, Orillia Campus at Lakehead University. Her position took effect August 1, 2024.\n\n“I would like to congratulate Dr. Linda Rodenburg on her appointment to this leadership position at Lakehead University,” says Dr. Gillian Siddall, President and Vice-Chancellor. “I look forward to working closely with her as we lead the Orillia campus, Lakehead University, and the community on an exciting path forward over the next five to 10 years.”\n\nUnder the guidance of the President, the Principal oversees the strategic direction and operation of the Orillia Campus. The role is responsible for championing the university’s mission, engaging in community outreach, promoting university programs, and advancing local partnerships. In this role, Rodenburg will work closely with students, faculty and staff on campus, and collaborate with government, industry and other stakeholders to foster economic development initiatives in Orillia and across the region.\n\nOne of the founding faculty members of the Orillia campus, Rodenburg is highly regarded as a teacher, mentor, and leader. In 2018, she founded the Office of Community Engagement Lifelong Learning, with the mandate to offer non-traditional learning opportunities for all ages as well as professional development opportunities. As a lecturer in the Department of English, she taught courses in English and Interdisciplinary Studies, and her research has focused on Indigenous and Māori stories in relation to Canada and New Zealand. Her academic work has focused on how stories construct a sense of culture within a place.\n\n“I have a long history with Lakehead in both Thunder Bay and Orillia, and I am very grateful for this opportunity to take this next step,” Rodenburg says. “The Orillia Campus is experiencing an incredible moment of growth, and I look forward to working with the President and executive team to move the vision for this university forward within this community that I love and call home.”\n\nRodenburg is passionate about building partnerships, both internally and externally, that advance Lakehead’s strategic priorities, enable excellence in research, support inclusive communities, and create opportunities for learning and student success.\n\n“We are an accessible institution that is embedded in the communities we serve through partnerships and relationships forged with business, industry, and municipal government. I look forward to leaning into those relationships as we expand our impact throughout the County of Simcoe.”\n\nRodenburg earned her Honours Bachelor of Arts in English concurrently with her Bachelor of Education degree at Lakehead in 1999. She completed her Masters in English at the University of Guelph before traveling to New Zealand to complete her PhD at the University of Otago on a Commonwealth Scholarship. She returned to Canada and joined the team that opened Lakehead’s Orillia campus in 2006.\n\n-30-\n\nMedia: For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact the Media Relations team at mediarelations@lakeheadu.ca.\n\nJune 21, 2024 – Thunder Bay, Ont.\n\nLakehead University in Canada and Northumbria University in the United Kingdom have launched a new international dual degree for students in their respective business programs.\n\nThe new collaboration between Lakehead’s Faculty of Business Administration and Northumbria’s Newcastle Business School will provide an opportunity for students to develop international connections and global skills through a year-long exchange while earning two degrees in four years.\n\nDr. David Richards, Dean of Lakehead’s Faculty of Business Administration said:\n\n“We are very excited about adding Northumbria as an international dual degree program partner. Our partnership is a testament to our institutions’ shared mission to provide students with opportunities that develop intercultural competencies and global skills that are desired by employers.”\n\nSocial mobility is a key part of Northumbria’s strategic ambition and the partnership with Lakehead will make study abroad accessible to even more students – regardless of background.\n\nDr. Liz Cunningham, from Northumbria’s Newcastle Business School, said:\n\n“BA (Hons) Business Management is one of the largest programs offered by Newcastle Business School. Students on the program come from a wide range of backgrounds, with a significant number having widening participation characteristics. The opportunity to study abroad is a transformational experience for such students and the dual degree partnership with Lakehead is a really exciting addition to the Study Abroad portfolio offered to them.\"\n\nAlejandra Vicencio, Head of International Mobility at Northumbria, added:\n\n“Canada is a highly sought after destination for our students on study abroad, and the dual degree with Lakehead University is a fantastic opportunity. At the same time, we are really looking forward to welcoming Lakehead students to Northumbria.\n\nStudents who successfully complete the program from Lakehead University will earn a Bachelor of Arts in Business and Management from Northumbria and an Honours Bachelor of Commerce from Lakehead.\n\nStudents from Northumbria will earn a Bachelor of Administration from Lakehead and Bachelor of Arts in Business and Management from Northumbria.\n\nAll students will be required to complete an international exchange in third-year.\n\n“We are thankful to the faculty, deans, and colleagues who have contributed to the success of this partnership,” said James Aldridge, Vice-Provost International at Lakehead. “On behalf of Lakehead, we look forward to welcoming students from Northumbria to Canada.”\n\nThe Faculty of Business Administration at Lakehead University is AACSB and CPA accredited. Newcastle Business School at Northumbria University is accredited by AACSB and AACSB Accounting, and is EPAS accredited through EFMD.\n\nMore information about the new dual degree program can be found at www.lakeheadu.ca/internationaldualdegree.\n\n-30-\n\nLakehead University is a fully comprehensive university with approximately 9,700 full-time equivalent students and over 2,000 faculty and staff at two campuses in Orillia and Thunder Bay, Ontario.

This funding will support four projects that will develop additional diploma-to-degree pathways for continued study and seek to ease the application process for college graduates as they pursue degree-level programs.\n\nThe announcement was made on June 17 by Dr. Adrienne Galway, Executive Director of ONCAT, alongside the Honourable Jill Dunlop, Minister of Colleges and Universities, and Dr. Ann Marie Vaughan, President and CEO of Humber College.\n\nOver the next year, ONCAT is flowing over $2.8 million to support 39 learner mobility projects at 35 colleges, universities, and Indigenous Institutes in Ontario. These projects aim to empower learners by recognizing previous education and professional experiences and facilitating smoother transitions between programs and institutions.\n\nThe four funded projects at Lakehead are:\n\nRPN Bridging to University Nursing Program Pathway to BScN - $100,000: Led by Dr. Kristen Jones-Bonofiglio, Director of the School of Nursing, this is a collaborative project with Centennial College to develop a formal pathway for graduates of Centennial's Registered Practical Nursing (RPN) bridging program to apply to Lakehead's Bachelor of Science in Nursing program.\n\n“ONCAT's support of this project allows for the School of Nursing to work closely with staff and faculty at Centennial College to more fully acknowledge future BScN program applicants' prior academic and professional knowledge and skills,” said Jones-Bonofiglio. “This will reduce the number of courses that they would be required to take to obtain their degree and make important contributions as RNs.”\n\nRevisiting Pathways to Water Resource Science - $37,500: Led by Dr. Amanda Diochon, Associate Professor of Geology and Program Coordinator of Water Resource Science, this project will enhance the transition of students who have completed an Environmental Technology or Technician diploma from one of eight Ontario colleges into Lakehead’s recently revised Honours Bachelor of Science (Water Resource Science) degree.\n\n“We recently have revised the curriculum so that our graduates meet the knowledge requirements to apply for the professional geoscientist designation,” said Diochon. “The work to be carried out in this project will position them well to secure and advance in careers in water science and contribute to Ontario's skilled workforce.”\n\nDiploma-Degree Pathways to Meet Regional Employer Demand - $30,000: Led by doctoral student Kaylin Kainulainen (Faculty of Education) will work with Seneca Polytechnic to develop an integrated pathway(s) where students obtain both the Law Clerk diploma from Seneca and a complementary degree at Lakehead while making valuable workforce connections and gaining industry experience at the same time.\n\nEstablishing Prerequisite and Transfer Credits for General Arts & Science Graduates - $45,000: Also led by Kainulainen, this project will focus on improving prerequisite credit, transfer credit, and transfer pathways from General Arts & Science certificate (GAP) and diploma (GAS) programs at Confederation College, Fanshawe College and Georgian College into Lakehead degree programs offered in Thunder Bay and Orillia.\n\n\"Empowering learners with accessible pathways to navigate their educational journey is key to helping them achieve their professional and academic goals,” said Galway. “The increased funding will promote improved transitions between institutions and programs, helping learners get where they want to go.\"\n\n“The Ontario government is proud to support ONCAT’s important work to make it easier for learners of all backgrounds to pursue their educational goals,” said Minister Jill Dunlop. “By facilitating smoother transitions and recognizing the wealth of knowledge gained through previous experience, we are fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment to advance student success in Ontario.”\n\n“ONCAT’s support for these projects advance our commitment to provide accessible learning opportunities for students,” said Dr. Michel S. Beaulieu, Lakehead’s Associate Vice-Provost (Academic). “Through these projects we will be able to break down barriers that prevent students from seeking a university-level education while also providing in-demand diploma-to-degree transfer pathways that meet the needs of our communities and prepare students for the future workforce.”\n\nThe LUSU Food Resource Centre (FRC) is a Lakehead University Student Union (LUSU) student centre that provides Lakehead students experiencing food insecurity with emergency food support, food-related education, and events. Student food insecurity rates continue to be high at Lakehead. On average the LUSU FRC assists 200 students each month.\n\nTo help support students and keep the shelves stocked, the LUSU FRC organizes the annual Departmental Food Drive Challenge. Throughout each school year, the LUSU FRC collects donations from Lakehead departments and keeps a score of the number of items donated. At the end of the school year (April), the department with the most points wins!\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the wonderful success of this year’s food drive challenge. We received over 4,900 food donations-- almost double the amount of donations from last year!\n\nWe are very happy to announce that Institutional Planning and Analysis has come in first place in the competition with over 1,200 food items donated! This was followed by Nursing (second place), and The Print Shop (third place).\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in the Departmental Food Drive Challenge. Thank you all for your generous support and passion in supporting students experiencing food insecurity!\n\nWant to donate but aren’t sure which food items are needed?*\n\nNon-perishables (e.g., canned beans, canned tuna, dried lentils, rice, canned vegetables, etc.)\n\nFresh fruits, vegetables, bread, eggs, and other produce\n\nFrozen vegetables, fruits, and meatsPlease note: We cannot accept items that are open, past expiration, or best before dates.\n\nThanks again to IPA and the Lakehead community for assisting our students!\n\nJuly 18, 2024 – Thunder Bay, Ont.\n\nA national initiative, the ACCESS Open Minds Indigenous Youth Mental Health and Wellness Network, to enhance Indigenous youth mental health services, co-led by researchers from Lakehead University and McGill University, has received $1.45 million from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).\n\nLakehead’s Dr. Christopher Mushquash, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Mental Health and Addiction, Professor in the Department of Psychology, Vice President Research at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre and Chief Scientist, Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute, and McGill’s Dr. Srividya Iyer, Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Youth, Mental Health, and Learning Health Systems and Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, are leading the five-year project. This initiative will strengthen capacity amongst Indigenous communities and integrated youth services (IYS) to provide culturally affirming, high quality and responsive mental health services for Indigenous youth.\n\nIt brings together youth, Elders, family members, researchers, communities and leading Indigenous organizations, including the Thunderbird Partnership Foundation under the leadership of Dr. Carol Hopkins and the First Peoples Wellness Circle under the leadership of Dr. Brenda Restoule. Dilico Anishinabek Family Care is also a partner on the project.\n\n\"By centering Indigenous knowledge and practices, we aim to create a sustainable and culturally relevant mental health support system for Indigenous youth. This project is a testament to the power of collaboration and the wisdom of Indigenous communities, and youth, in addressing mental health challenges,\" Mushquash says.\n\nIndigenous youth in Canada have experienced significant population growth, accompanied by growing concerns about their mental health and wellbeing. Adverse childhood experiences, influenced by historical and systemic factors such as intergenerational trauma, cultural disconnection, poverty and socioeconomic disadvantage, disproportionately affect Indigenous youth. Limited access to health services, culturally inappropriate care and geographical barriers further exacerbate these challenges.\n\n“We have an opportunity to listen to Indigenous youth and work with them to address mental health inequities by advancing practices that centre Indigenous knowledge, values and traditions in mental health and wellness services,” Iyer emphasizes.\n\nOver the next five years, the interdisciplinary research team will focus on relationship building and the development of service practices, tools, interventions and training programs to shape a learning health system that will inform mental health and wellness service delivery for Indigenous youth across Canada. It will also help build capacity for future leaders in Indigenous communities.\n\n“By enabling primary care providers, communities, families and youth with the tools and knowledge on how to navigate the health system, we will strengthen the capacity within Indigenous communities to ensure that youth-focused mental health resources are available to them,” Mushquash explains.\n\nThe Government of Canada recently invested $59 million in the Integrated Youth Services Network of Networks (IYS-Net) to strengthen and expand IYS across Canada. An innovative approach to youth-focused mental health, IYS provides youth with equitable access to a range of services and supports that contribute to health. This includes mental health and substance use services, alongside primary care, peer support, work and study supports, and more. Associate Professor Dr. Aislin Mushquash, Adjunct Professor Dr. Elaine Toombs, and postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carolyn Melro from Lakehead University are also members of this network.\n\nMushquash concludes, “Through the larger IYS-Net initiative, we have the opportunity to address mental health inequities, not just in Indigenous communities, but for youth across Canada.”\n\nIn 2023/24, Lakehead University received almost $2.5 million in assistance from the Research Support Fund to support the indirect costs of research, which includes costs for supporting the management of intellectual property, research and administration, ethics and regulatory compliance, research resources, research facilities, and research security."
