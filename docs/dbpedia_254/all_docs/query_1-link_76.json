His parents taught and instilled in him their own virtuous values of a hard work ethic while loving and taking care of your family and friends.\n\nHe became a realtor at the age of 27 and has enjoyed a successful 14-year career thus far. His career has allowed him the opportunity to support Lakehead University and give back to the community in any way he is able to.\n\nHis Lakehead University contributions include student bursaries to the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law and the Northern Ontario School of Medicine as well as donations to new capital building campaigns. In the community his generosity knows no bounds as he is involved with many charitable organizations such as the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Foundation and Camp Quality.\n\nIn October of 2019, the Lakehead University Alumni Association named Vince as an Honourary Alumni for his contributions to Lakehead University and its students.\n\nVince will tell you that his most important accomplishment so far has been the birth of his son Matteo in February of 2020 just after his 40th birthday in January.

This offering has been made possible by the Government of Canada’s new Global Skills Opportunity program.\n\nThe CALAREO IRME Project will be administered by Lakehead University and Carleton University on behalf of the consortium. Opportunities include 12-week research internships for Canadian undergraduates in collaboration with Mitacs, which is contributing up to $240,000 in additional funding.\n\nThe program will also offer short-term research internships and fund several faculty-led programs, with the contribution of $40,000 from CALAREO.\n\nPartners in Latin America include six universities in the state of Querétaro, México, and Colombia Challenge Your Knowledge (CCYK), a 31-university consortium in Colombia, which will work with CALAREO members in Canada to strengthen systems and supports for students and offer research placements.\n\n“The CALAREO International Research Mobility Experience will be a transformative project that will allow students from our member institutions to experience life-changing international research opportunities,” said Dr. Andrew P. Dean, Lakehead’s Vice-President, Research and Innovation, and Chair of the CALAREO Consortium.\n\n“We thank the Government of Canada and Mitacs for financial support for this program. International research collaborations are extremely important to tackling the large challenges for society today. Through this program we will be able to start those collaborations and opportunities for our undergraduate students,” he added.\n\nGlobal Skills Opportunity is a national outbound student mobility program that is expected to enable more than 16,000 Canadian college and undergraduate-level university students from across the country to acquire the global skills that employers want and the Canadian economy needs.\n\nA key component of the Government of Canada’s International Education Strategy, Global Skills Opportunity is funded by Employment and Social Development Canada and administered jointly by Colleges and Institutes Canada and Universities Canada.\n\nWhile open to all Canadian post-secondary students, the national program targets groups for whom international experiences have traditionally been less accessible — specifically Indigenous students, students from low-income backgrounds, and those with disabilities. It also aims to diversify destination countries where Canadian students pursue international learning.\n\nCompared to similar countries, fewer Canadian students – only about 11 per cent of university undergraduates and three per cent of college students – participate in work or study abroad experiences during their studies.\n\nThis new program just might change that. By empowering post-secondary institutions to implement innovative solutions to barriers to participation, Global Skills Opportunity will expand the horizons of Canadian students from coast to coast, and improve Canada’s competitiveness on the world stage.\n\n“Global Skills Opportunity is breaking down financial, social and logistical barriers that have prevented too many underrepresented students from participating in global study and work opportunities,” said Paul Davidson, President, Universities Canada.\n\nThrough this ambitious and groundbreaking program, thousands of young Canadians will have transformational experiences abroad. Their newfound global perspective and skills will inform the way they live and work for decades to come,” Davidson added.\n\n-30-\n\nFor more information:\n\nwww.GlobalSkillsOpportunity.ca\n\nwww.ExperienceCompetencesMondiales.ca\n\n#GlobalSkillsCA\n\n#CompétencesMondialesCA\n\nMedia: For more information or interviews, please contact Brandon Walker, Media, Communications and Marketing Associate, at (807) 343-8110 ext. 8372 or mediarelations@lakeheadu.ca.\n\nFor immediate release: November 25, 2021\n\n<<THUNDER BAY AND ORILLIA, ONTARIO>> —\n\nLakehead students will gain global skills through two new projects funded by the Government of Canada’s Global Skills Opportunity Program.\n\nGlobal Skills Opportunity (GSO) is a national outbound student mobility program that is expected to enable more than 16,000 Canadian college and undergraduate-level university students from across the country to acquire the global skills that employers want and the Canadian economy needs.\n\nA key component of the Government of Canada’s International Education Strategy, Global Skills Opportunity is funded by Employment and Social Development Canada and is administered jointly by Colleges and Institutes Canada and Universities Canada.\n\nThe New Horizons Project and the International Research Mobility Experience (IRME) Project will run through March 2025, providing new sources of funding to support international mobility experiences for Lakehead´s undergraduate students.\n\nWhile open to all Canadian post-secondary students, the national program targets groups for whom international experiences have traditionally been less accessible — specifically Indigenous students, students from low-income backgrounds, and those with disabilities. It also aims to diversify destination countries where Canadian students pursue international learning.\n\nNew Horizons: Global skills, Indigenous Knowledge, and Student Mobility Project\n\nLakehead International was successful in securing nearly $500,000 from the GSO program for its New Horizons Project.\n\nThe goal of New Horizons is to provide opportunities for Indigenous students and low-income students to develop international experience and cultural intelligence, expand their knowledge of issues relevant to Indigenous peoples globally, and to provide students access to innovative and culturally relevant supports, resources, training, and financial backing needed to participate in international mobility opportunities.\n\nThe program will send students on short-term and one-semester study abroad courses and programs to partner universities in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Finland, Mexico, and Norway. Some courses already exist, while others may be developed. All programs are coordinated with Lakehead’s partners and each will inspire students to see their world differently, learn intercultural skills, and build a brighter future.\n\nInternational Research Mobility Experience (IRME) Project\n\nThe CALAREO Consortium, whose members include Lakehead, Vancouver Island University, Carleton University, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), and Memorial University, was awarded a grant of $799,200 to launch the International Research Mobility Experience (IRME) project. The CALAREO Secretariat is based at Lakehead and will administer the IRME Project.\n\nCo-funded by Mitacs ($240,000) and CALAREO ($40,000), the IRME Project will sponsor an estimated 138 undergraduate students to participate in various research-focused mobility opportunities, including medium- and short-term research internships/co-ops, as well as faculty-led programs.\n\nGSO also offers targeted funding and services for underrepresented students, specifically Indigenous students, students with disabilities, and low-income students. CALAREO partners in Mexico and Colombia will collaborate to offer research internships and ensure inclusive opportunities and support services.\n\nWith its focus on non-traditional destinations in Latin America, the project will also develop a promotional strategy for the region, based on the results of the student survey funded by the 2020-21 GSO Outbound Mobility Pilot Project.\n\n“The GSO Program funds transformative projects for our students to experience life-changing international mobility opportunities,” said Dr. Andrew P.

In its first year the program will support two full-time students – one at the Thunder Bay campus and one at the Orillia campus – gradually increasing to a maximum of eight students annually. The program will accept applications from current and incoming high-school graduates and mature students who are currently or were formerly in the foster care system in Simcoe County or Northwestern Ontario for at least one year. The bursary will be renewable for up to four years.\n\n“Youth who have experienced the child welfare system are uniquely vulnerable and require specifically tailored support mechanisms to realize success within structures of higher learning,” said Child Welfare PAC Canada President Ingrid Palmer. “By adopting a relevant and responsive pathway to accessible postsecondary education, Lakehead University will also nurture upward social and economic mobility for those who have already endured undue hardship. Thank you, Lakehead, for opening up equitable access to postsecondary education in the North!”\n\n“All Ontarians deserve access to a postsecondary education experience and a higher education system that embraces accessibility and inclusivity and promotes success,” said Jill Dunlop, Minister of Colleges and Universities. “This is a key government priority because we know learners need the opportunity to get the training required for good jobs and because diverse representation in education and the workplace is integral to building a stronger and more innovative province and economy.”\n\nEnsuring that students have the opportunity to access education regardless of their circumstance is one of the reasons why the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario has referred to Lakehead University as an equity of access powerhouse, explained Dr. Moira McPherson, President and Vice-Chancellor of Lakehead University.\n\n“The launch of Lakehead’s Youth in Care Tuition Waiver is in keeping with our strategic priorities to provide access to a transformative university experience grounded in exceptional scholarship and student potential,” she said.\n\nIt also aligns with the University’s commitment to serving and removing barriers to education for underrepresented students in Simcoe County and Northwestern Ontario. In addition to the tuition waiver, Lakehead University also offers the Gateway Program and Indigenous Transition Year Program to help students from underrepresented groups and students who don’t meet traditional admission requirements access a university-level education.\n\n“We want our students to succeed and feel supported during their time at Lakehead,” explained Andrea Tarsitano, Vice-Provost (Students) and Registrar. “This tuition waiver is just an extension of the wraparound supports and individualized services that Lakehead already provides to our students to help them navigate the transition to university and support them throughout their education.”\n\nMore information on the Youth in Care Tuition Waiver can be found at www.lakeheadu.ca/studentcentral/financing-budgeting/yic_waiver.\n\n-30-\n\nMedia: Jaclyn Bucik, Media, Communications & Marketing Associate, at 705-330-4010 ext. 2014 or mediarelations@lakeheadu.ca\n\nLakehead University is a fully comprehensive university with approximately 9,700 full-time equivalent students and over 2,000 faculty and staff at two campuses in Orillia and Thunder Bay, Ontario.

This partnership will provide Lakehead students a clear, defined path to becoming a practicing MD and allow students the unique opportunity for global education.\n\nLakehead University students will gain a competitive advantage as a result of this agreement. Along with a waived application fee and scholarships exclusively available to Lakehead students, Trinity School of Medicine will provide a streamlined admissions process, granting conditional acceptance to applicants that meet TSOM's academic acceptance requirements specified. This benefit will drastically decrease the amount of time and effort it usually takes to complete and process medical school applications.\n\nIn addition to an easier pathway to acceptance, Trinity School of Medicine will allow selected Lakehead students in the undergraduate science program each year the opportunity to participate in a mini-clerkship session at their learning facilities and teaching hospital in Warner Robins, Georgia, USA. Students will attend lectures with Trinity Medical Sciences University students and rotate in select clinical rotations. Lakehead students will meet Trinity faculty and hospital leadership to see firsthand what it is like to attend medical school.\n\n“We are truly honored to enter into this partnership with Lakehead University and particularly excited to offer the opportunity to participate in mini-clerkships” said Warren Ison, Trinity’s Canadian Regional Director of Admissions.\n\n“What many people don’t realize is that most medical schools don’t allow students to even touch a patient until their third or fourth year. But Trinity recognizes the value in hands-on experience, which is why students begin working directly with patients beginning their very first term. Our partnership with Lakehead means we will be able to produce more experienced doctors who can practice in Canada and contribute to the correction of the ongoing physician shortage.”\n\n“Trinity and Lakehead University have the common goal of eliminating artificial barriers that prevent students from reaching their potential,” said Trinity School of Medicine President and CEO Steven Wilson. Since graduates from Trinity School of Medicine face no barriers to residency and licensure in either the U.S. or Canada, Mr. Wilson noted that this partnership “gives students the opportunity to gain global healthcare experience abroad and return to their hometown communities, where they can improve local healthcare access and contribute to the regional economy.”\n\n“Lakehead is delighted to launch this new partnership with Trinity Medical Sciences University, which represents a wonderful opportunity to further internationalize the Lakehead student body and provide our students with unconventional academic experiences,” said Dr. David Barnett, Lakehead University’s Provost and Vice-President (Academic).\n\nUnder the agreement, Lakehead will also provide TMSU students the possibility to transition into several of Lakehead's undergraduate degree programs. Dr. Todd Randall, Lakehead’s Dean of the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies, noted that “through this partnership, we are welcoming new students into our programs, while also providing both domestic and international students the opportunity to chase their dreams of becoming medical professionals.”\n\n- 30 -\n\nAbout Trinity School of Medicine: Trinity School of Medicine is a highly accredited, international medical school located on the beautiful island of St. Vincent.
