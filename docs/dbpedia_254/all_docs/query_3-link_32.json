Here are the highlights: &bull; A new exam, TOEFL Essentials, will be available to test takers by August 2021 &bull; The test is designed as a more affordable, more convenient alternative to the TOEFL iBT With testing and admissions cycles so badly disrupted this year, many universities and colleges have had to become a lot more flexible around English language testing. Some have adopted test-optional policies, others have begun to accept a wider range of proficiency tests. One effect of all that is that more affordable and convenient language tests &ndash; notably&nbsp;Duolingo&nbsp;but others as well &ndash; have gained much more acceptance in university admissions offices than ever before. Such tests &ldquo;existed before the pandemic but they hadn&rsquo;t been widely accepted,&rdquo; says Srikant Gopal, the executive director of the TOEFL Program at ETS. &ldquo;The pandemic disrupted the entire testing cycle and rhythm of testing, and so this past year has been a period of experimentation that has benefited some of those low-cost providers. But our view is that that is not sustainable going forward and that the market needs a higher-quality option.&rdquo; ETS aims to provide that option with a new TOEFL product that will launch later this year. The new test, is clearly intended as a counter to a growing field of more affordable competitors. As&nbsp;Inside Higher Ed&nbsp;recently reported, the Duolingo test, which costs US$49 and takes about an hour to complete, was accepted by &ldquo;only dozens&rdquo; of US colleges before COVID. The Duolingo website indicates the test is now accepted by nearly 1,600 institutions worldwide. In comparison, the TOEFL iBT costs up to US$225 in the US (with prices running higher or lower in markets around the world) and takes up to three hours to complete. While pricing is not yet final, ETS expects TOEFL Essentials to cost roughly half of the iBT price (so somewhere around US$100-US$120) and to take 90 minutes to complete. The TOEFL iBT is &ldquo;the gold standard for accessing someone&rsquo;s ability to succeed in a university environment,&rdquo; maintains Mr Gopal. &ldquo;It is universally accepted, and gives universities and colleges the assurance that [the applicants they accept] will meet their standards.&rdquo; But where the TOEFL iBT focuses on English communication in an academic context, TOEFL Essentials is designed to be a broader, more versatile test. About half of the content is academic; the other half is more general &ldquo;life skills&rdquo; English. As a more affordable, more convenient alternative to the iBT, ETS believes that TOEFL Essentials can help universities and colleges reach a larger applicant pool. Building on the lessons learned in home-based test administration over the past year, TOEFL Essentials will also be taken by students at home, supported with a combination of human and AI proctoring. &ldquo;The scores are as reliable, valid, and accurate as any test from ETS,&rdquo; adds Mr Gopal. &ldquo;But as universities around the world try to recruit high-quality students, they want to do whatever they can to reduce barriers for students, including with respect to English language testing. We want to help universities attract new and more diverse applicants but also maintain quality standards at the same time.&rdquo; Getting ready for launch In a survey of roughly 250 universities across major study destinations, 90% said they would be likely to accept TOEFL Essentials scores for admissions in 2022. Nearly all respondents (95%) saw the test as beneficial in attracting quality applicants. ETS is now conducting briefings for institutions through the first half of this year leading up to the official release of the new test in August 2021. Between now and then, ETS plans to release a concordance table mapping test scores on TOEFL Essentials to the iBT and other standardised tests, and test preparation materials and resources for teachers are also in development.

Here are the highlights: &middot; Canada&rsquo;s immigration ministry has established a new two-stage approval process for new study permit applications &middot; The process effectively provides for a conditional approval which allows students to begin their studies online while still abroad, and then to complete the application process as visa processing services are more fully restored worldwide Canadian Immigration Minister Marco Mendocino announced&nbsp;new visa policies and services&nbsp;this week that are designed to ease international students&rsquo; transition to study in Canada in the coming months. These new measures include: &middot; Providing priority study permit processing for applicants who have submitted a complete application online &middot; Allowing students to count time spent in online studies abroad toward their eligibility for a post-graduation work permit, so long as (i) they have submitted a study permit application and (ii) at least 50% of their programme of study is completed in Canada &middot; Implementing a new two-stage approval process for students who cannot submit all of the documentation needed for a complete study permit application (for example,&nbsp;any biometric requirements) Each of these is significant, but the last item is especially noteworthy as it effectively introduces a conditional approval process for new applicants to help reassure students that they are on track to pursue studies in Canada once visa processing services are fully restored, travel restrictions ease, and international flight services are re-established. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) explains this new two-stage approval process as follows: &middot; &ldquo;Applicants who pass the approval-in-principle stage &mdash; which includes showing that they have been accepted at a Canadian learning institution, have the available funds and are otherwise eligible for the study permit &mdash; will be notified of a first-step approval. &middot; Once the approval-in-principle is issued, applicants can begin studying online abroad and have that time count towards their post-graduation work permit, provided they meet other criteria and that they eventually receive full approval of their study permit. &middot; An applicant will receive final approval once they have met all eligibility and admissibility requirements, including submitting biometrics and necessary documents such as an immigration medical exam and a police certificate. Only once a final approval is received will an applicant be able to travel to Canada.&rdquo; The conditional approval process also sets up a new type of timeline for the students&rsquo; studies in Canada. It allows study permit applicants to count time spent studying online (while still outside Canada) towards post-graduate work permit eligibility once they have the conditional approval (&ldquo;approval-in-principle&rdquo;) from the first step of the approval process. The idea being that as more visa services reopen, applicants will then submit any remaining documentation required in order to secure their final, second-stage approval for the study permit and, subsequently, travel to Canada to continue their studies. The IRCC statement on this new policy adds, &ldquo;This process is available to students starting a program in the fall semester who submit a study permit application before 15 September 2020. This measure will reassure students that they can enroll and begin their studies this fall online, even when they are not able to submit all required documentation due to pandemic-related closures.&rdquo; &ldquo;The pandemic has had a significant impact on international students and the Canadian institutions and communities that host them,&rdquo; added Minister Mendocino. &ldquo;This is why we have implemented a series of measures to support them. We value the contribution of young people seeking a high-quality education in Canada, and we&rsquo;re making every effort to minimize how current challenges affect their plans and dreams for the future.&rdquo; This week&rsquo;s announcement follows another important IRCC bulletin from 30 June in which the ministry announced the&nbsp;resumption of some visa processing services. As of 1 July, IRCC began again to process online applications for visitor visas and electronic travel authorizations (eTAs). Processing has also resumed for online applications for study permits and work permits. While paper-based applications are not being accepted at this time, IRCC notes that some visa application centers (VACs) have begun to reopen. Applicants are advised to check the&nbsp;IRCC website&nbsp;for the current status of VACs in their local area. IRCC cautions as well that, &ldquo;Due to current travel restrictions, applicants should keep in mind that, even if they apply and get a visitor visa or eTA, most people will not be able to travel to Canada at this time&hellip;Those who are eligible to travel to Canada at this time must have a plan to quarantine for 14 days when they arrive in Canada. This is mandatory, even if they have no symptoms. Those who don&rsquo;t have a plan should not travel to Canada.&rdquo; To know more visit at mapmystudy.com\n\nThe UK&rsquo;s international education sector has welcomed the government&rsquo;s recent announcement that it will open applications for its new graduate scheme on July 1, 2021. Students on the Graduate route will be able to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years for doctoral students. &ldquo;As we rebuild from the global pandemic we want the world&rsquo;s brightest talent&rdquo; Both Universities UK International and UKCISA said that the government had listened to key recommendations from the sector. &ldquo;As we rebuild from the global pandemic we want the world&rsquo;s brightest talent, who aspire to a career at the highest levels of business, science, the arts and technology to see our United Kingdom as the natural place to fulfil their aspirations,&rdquo; said minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster. &ldquo;The changes announced today (March 5) will ensure once they have received a gold standard qualification from one of our world leading education institutions they can easily secure the status they need to continue living, working and fulfilling their dreams in the UK.&rdquo; In order to be eligible for the scheme, students must have completed an eligible course at a UK higher education provider, with a track record of compliance with the government&rsquo;s immigration requirements. The government said that the route will be unsponsored, meaning applicants will not need a job offer to apply. &ldquo;There will be no minimum salary requirements nor caps on numbers. Graduates on the route will be able to work flexibly, switch jobs and develop their career as required,&rdquo; the government said in a statement. It is hoped that the new route will help the government to achieve the ambition set out in the International Education Strategy to increase the number of international students in higher education in the UK to 600,000 by 2030. &ldquo;We look forward to working with member universities and the wider sector to welcome students to apply for the route&rdquo; Coronavirus concessions for students unable to travel to the UK due to the pandemic have also been extended, &ldquo;recognising the continuing disruption many face due to international travel restrictions&rdquo;. A UUKi spokesperson told The PIE News that after working closely with the Home Office and sector partners, they were pleased to see the change in date by which students who started a course of 12 months or less in 2020 must be in the UK to be eligible for the Graduate route. &nbsp; &ldquo;The new date of June 21 reflects the current international travel situation due to Covid-19, and allows international students to benefit from the post-study work opportunities offered by the route. &ldquo;We look forward to working with member universities and the wider sector to welcome students to apply for the route from July 1,&rdquo; the spokesperson said. The move was also welcomed by founder and chairperson of the National Indian Students &amp; Alumni Union UK whose organisation has been campaigning for the route for over six years.

According to AACC and Columbia University, roughly 42-45% of America&rsquo;s baccalaureate students start at a community college. They attend community colleges first because of convenience, cost savings, small classes, and having more time to think about their final choice of universities. Community colleges for the most part have given them just that plus something unique in America: freshman and sophomore credit transfer to a university of their choice and a customised application process specifically for transfer by eliminating requirements such as TOEFL/IELTS, SAT/ACT and, in many universities, high school transcripts. Some universities have worked out articulation agreements with community colleges where, provided that all of the transfer admission criteria have been met, students may get a guaranteed admission as a junior when they apply as a transferred student. &ldquo;For years we have focused on dispelling the myths regarding community colleges&rdquo; Take my three colleges for example, San Mateo Colleges of Silicon Valley have agreements with over 150 universities in our network called College University Partnership, which vastly increases the choices of guaranteed admission. This contributed to our high rankings by IIE three years in a row (#14 in 2020). Reasons for attending a community college as a freshman before transferring to a university as a junior should not be special or reserved for the US students only. But in reality, less than 5% of international bachelor degree students in the US who enroll in a community college use this opportunity, or are even aware of it, herein an issue of equal opportunity. Most only know and attempt the extremely competitive process of applying directly to their dream university. High admission selectivity means high failures, thus leaving many broken dreams, traumatised youngsters whose university denial will mar them for the rest of their lives. In fact, those international students desiring a bachelor&rsquo;s degree aren&rsquo;t all that different from American students. And they should leverage the opportunity. This is our argument that the overall numbers of international students in America may increase from 5% to as much as 40%. The challenges for accomplishing this increase are real: 1. The concept of community colleges is difficult to explain 2. Transfer officers of universities do not travel outside the USA to promote their work as freshmen admissions officers do 3. Attending a community college is not considered as baccalaureate study 4. There is no ranking for community colleges, therefore, to go through a community college to get to universities like UC Berkeley seems too good to be true 5. If you step on an international high school campus, you see and hear universities, particularly the famous ones to a fault 6. Parents equate low tuition of community colleges to low quality 7. Agents have to make efforts to overcome the above and they have to get volume 8. Agents think the lifecycle of a community college student is more complex than university referrals For years we have focused on dispelling the myths regarding community colleges and have conducted extensive outreach to address these misconceptions. For example, we would bring transfer officials from universities to travel with our colleges on the road. These co-presentations were much more convincing to students and parents as they were hearing directly from the university regarding university transfer admissions. We have also conducted on the ground and online webinars to distribute the data and testimonials of successful transfers. We include in our presentation that 30% of the junior class at UC Berkeley and roughly 60% at CSU campuses are transfer students. In the end, we realised that an effective way of increasing international community college enrolments lies in how we position ourselves and how we describe what we do. We decided to position ourselves as providing college courses for students to earn credits and to compare and contrast them with AP and IB. This reduced the concerns and baggage associated with attending a community college for two years in order to transfer. Due to articulation, the courses are the same as those offered by a university, except that tuition is much cheaper. Furthermore, our courses are taught by American professors. The students experience true American classroom learning prior to entering an American university. And in our case, if there is any doubt about the quality of courses, credit transfer, or even guaranteed University Transfer Admissions, they can consult with the 150 universities in our CUP network. This way, a student may choose to take some courses from us for many purposes other than transferring and if they accumulate enough credits, we can discuss university transfer admissions with them. Small, but firm steps before the giant leap. We also championed the term of UTA to describe what community colleges do and compare it to the only other way of getting a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, which is University Freshmen Admission. This way, it eliminates the confusion caused by a myriad of ways to describe the role of community colleges, such as pathway, 1+1+2, 2+2, bridge studies, etc. When UTA and UFA are presented side by side, it allows people to see community colleges as equal partners to universities with the same purpose and outcomes. UTA compliments UFA. Back in 2018, we had already started our &ldquo;credit learning&rdquo; approach because we believed that a large number of students abroad may not get the opportunity to come to the US but would still like to take our online classes to enrich their portfolio, to earn points on their domestic university applications, and to substitute their high school or college courses with ours. &ldquo;Countries are contemplating our online credit learning plus UTA programs as a way to reduce the expenses of their students&rdquo; Some countries are contemplating our online credit learning plus UTA programs as a way to reduce the expenses of their students obtaining a US bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Covid helped our colleges to expedite our online credit learning program referred to as Global Online Learning. We were ready when the world moved online. Our work has received the highest honour given to US exporters &ndash; the President&rsquo;s E-award that was started by president John F. Kennedy. By advocating fairly and enthusiastically the benefits of community colleges to foreign applicants, adopting the right combination of strategies, and being inclusive, community colleges indeed help universities to increase their student diversity and population. The eventual numbers will of course be in a range left and right of 40% but the future is bright and promising! To know more visit at mapmystudy.com\n\nShort on time? Here are the highlights:&nbsp; &nbsp; Ireland allows international students in the second semester of Irish higher education programs to continue to benefit from employment rights after their studies if they study remotely outside of Ireland. &nbsp; Temporary flexibility is comparable to that of Australia, Canada and the UK and more generous than the US and New Zealand rules &nbsp; Ireland temporarily changed a key immigration policy for international students in light of COVID, in an effort to both improve students&#39; ability to stay in Ireland to work after graduation and to discourage students from returning to Ireland during COVID. &nbsp; International students studying online and / or remotely in the second semester of an Irish higher education program will remain eligible for the Bachelor&#39;s Degree (1G) program for a short period of time. &nbsp; This program allows non-EU / EEA students who graduate with a degree from a recognized Irish awarding institution to stay in Ireland to seek employment at the university level for up to 24 months, depending on the level of education achieved. They can then apply for a Green Card (work permit) after 24 months. Before the pandemic and until now, students had to apply for the program while studying in Ireland in person. &nbsp; Students studying at a distance in Ireland&#39;s &#39;Tier 8&#39; or &#39;Tier 9&#39; programs (including Honors Bachelors, Masters and Postgraduates) have until 31 May 2021 to apply. &nbsp; Certain conditions must be met &nbsp; Students can apply for this program if they returned to their home country due to the pandemic or were unable to get an appointment due to COVID restrictions. They can send their applications electronically to the Registry Office, Burgh Quay, Dublin, with scans of the required documentation. They must register in Ireland if they can return to the country.&nbsp; &nbsp; To be eligible, students must:&nbsp; &nbsp; A letter from their higher education institution stating that they were students for the 2020/2021 academic year;&nbsp; &nbsp; A letter from their higher education institution stating that this course was taught 100% remotely and that they were not required to attend classes in person. &nbsp; A letter from the competent contracting body or institution informing them that they have obtained the award for which they were enrolled as students. &nbsp; In line with other destinations &nbsp; Ireland&#39;s announcement follows the example of some other major destinations that have introduced new COVID-specific &ndash; post-study work rights policies. These include Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. &nbsp; The United States has not announced any more flexibility with regards to its Optional Practical Training Program (OPT); students must be in the United States to study for their programs to count towards eligibility for the OPT and New Zealand has also not changed its post-study work rights policies. Students who are looking for more &nbsp; In a related development, a group of international students launched an online petition asking for further concessions in light of COVID. They are asking the Irish government to extend visas for all graduate students for another year to increase students&#39; chances of finding a job in Ireland, which students say is more difficult to obtain due to COVID. &nbsp; Importance of the third level Master&#39;s Degree Course &nbsp; In the years when the UK tightened visa and employment rights rules for non-EU / EEA students, the Irish Graduate Program of the 3rd degree was a key competitive advantage for Irish higher education institutions, which were able to attract a portion of students who might otherwise have gone to the UK. The number of new non-EU / EEA students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) pursuing higher education in Ireland increased by 45% between 2013 and 2017. &nbsp; The UK has now restored labor rights for two years, which will again make it more competitive in non-EU / EEA markets (but it also faces the potential loss of thousands of EU students due to Brexit). Some believe that Brexit offers Irish institutions new potential to attract EU/EEA students, particularly students seeking ELT courses.

Have you already registered for the&nbsp;IELTS?&nbsp;Do you want to score well and get into the University of your choice? But the jittery feeling surrounding the test pattern has made you restless? Then it is time to get away from those fears and focus on the test. Let us address five most common fears associated with&nbsp;IELTS exam&nbsp;and how you can overcome them. After all, confidence is the key! 1. What if I skip the listening audio and lose focus? You&rsquo;re not alone. Even a seasoned IELTS&nbsp; trainer can end up in a similar situation. More often than not, we tend to get lost on our thoughts and we lose focus. This can happen because of worrying too much or maybe losing your calm. They key here is to practice as much as you can. Lock yourselves up in a room, set the timer, and practice as much as you can. And yes, don&rsquo;t forget to leave your worries home on the test day! 2. Is it alright to take pauses while speaking during the Speaking Module? It certainly is. The examiner has been appointed to check how well you speak using clear and concise language and not to test your behavior pattern. If you think taking a brief pause while addressing a question gives you that little bit of tiny more time to think, that is completely okay. 3. I don&rsquo;t have good words in my vocabulary. Is it okay to repeat words in the Writing module? The exam is designed to test the level of a non-native English speaker not your vocabulary. Vocabulary however too is important but the examiner will not be expecting you to use &lsquo;high-end&rsquo; words in your essay. They key is to grasp few synonyms to common words. For example, instead of using &lsquo;Interesting&rsquo;, try using &lsquo;Compelling&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thought-Provoking&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Engrossing&rsquo;. 4. I don&rsquo;t have a good accent and there is a touch of my mother tongue in my pronunciation. It is the most common fear which bothers most students. It has been reiterated by most&nbsp;IELTS examiners&nbsp;that the accent or mother tongue influence does not affect your score. The&nbsp;IELTS exam&nbsp;is designed to test your language, not your accent. So drop those worries and focus on how well you speak! 5. What if I can&rsquo;t get the desired score in first attempt? There is no limit to the number of&nbsp;IELTS exams&nbsp;you can take however it is always advisable to practice as much as you can before the test date.&nbsp;IELTS&nbsp;not just tests your language but also how well you can manage your time. Still in case, you fail to achieve the desired score, you can fill another test. In case you are more comfortable using a computer, computer delivered&nbsp;IELTS&nbsp;is now available. There are no short-cuts to clearing the test. It is always good to speak to someone who has appeared for the test before in case you feel nervous. Happy prepping to you!
