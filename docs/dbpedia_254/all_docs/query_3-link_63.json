        "text": "Williams School of Business\n\nFaculty:\n\nMark Gandey\n\nInterim Dean of the Williams School of Business\n\nMark Gandey (B.U. finance, 1989) worked as an accountant for 17 years (Gillette, Air Montreal and Stikeman Elliott) while first earning a C.M.A (Concordia), a M.B.A. (U.Q.O.) followed by a graduate diploma in Instructional Technology (Concordia) prior to lecturing at the Williams School of Business in Managerial Accounting.\n\nDr. Robert Palmer\n\nFull Professor, Department Chairperson\n\nDr. Robert J. Palmer is a full professor in the area of Strategy and Management. After completing his B.S.Sc and Masters in Human Kinetics at the University of Ottawa, he completed his Ph.D in marketing at Michigan State University under Dr. Edward Mahoney. His research interests include relationship marketing, strategic change management, data analytics, consumer behaviour and social media.

Additionally, the impact of base domain knowledge on expectations/satisfaction in a new context has not been observed. The purpose of this study will be to fill these gaps, by focusing on whether experience with one alcohol category (ice wine) might influence adoption category for a brand new alcohol category (ice cider).\n\nDr. Hafid Agourram\n\nFull Professor, Business Technology and Analytics Area Group Coordinator\n\nDr. Agourram earned his DBA at Université de Sherbrooke. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Sciences and Mathematics from Rhode Island College (USA) in 1989, a Master’s degree in Software Engineering from National University (USA) in 1990, and a Master’s degree in Management Development from the EuroArab Management School (Spain) in 1995. Before joining Bishop’s University in July 2001, Dr. Agourram taught at McGill University, École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal, and Université du Québec à Montréal. Dr. Agourram has also worked in business organizations for nine years, including five years as the dean of a private business school, two years as human resources director, and two years as a software engineer. Dr. Agourram is a regular member of the Groupe de recherche en Geobusiness de l’Université de Sherbrooke.\n\nDr. Agourram’s Research\n\nDr. Agourram’s current research is concerned with information systems success in multicultural environments. His upcoming article will publish the findings of his dissertation, which searched for information systems success in four national cultures: France, Germany, Canada, and China. His research interests include information systems implementation success and long-term success in different national cultures, electronic commerce success models in different cultures, and the deployment of global information technology. Dr. Agourram is undertaking the design process of a research study that will complement his dissertation research. The purpose of the study is to develop information systems success models in Arab culture.\n\nHe has been involved in a joint research programme sponsored by the European Union and the Arab League. Twenty-five researchers from European and Arab countries developed a multicultural MBA programme which is now offered in about 20 European and Arab countries. The programme was based on the tutored-self study approach, with heavy use of internet technology and private networks.\n\nProfessor Agourram was also involved in the largest leadership research study to have been sponsored and conducted by the Wharton Business School. The research involves more than 170 researchers from all around the world. The purpose of the GLOBE (Global Leadership Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness) project is to uncover the “etic” and “emic” categories of leadership. Partial results have been published in different journals, including Leadership Quarterly Journal.\n\nOther research roles:\n\nResearch investigator.

He received his M.Sc (Economics) in 1987 from the Karl Marx Economics Institute in Bulgaria and Ph.D. (Economics) in 1996 from Stockholm University. He served as a Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence at the Albany State University from 2002 to 2004, after having worked as consultant, lecturer and university administrator in Tanzania, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Belgium. He teaches courses in international business and international marketing.\n\nDr. Rutihinda’s Research\n\nDr. Rutihinda’s research focuses on entrepreneurship and globalisation of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). He is currently working on two different projects looking respectively at the Eastern Townships and Tanzania.\n\nThe purpose of the study funded by the Eastern Townships Research Centre is to explore the challenges and costs involved in developing foreign markets for SMEs in the Eastern Townships, and to investigate what factors may explain any observed differences in their export performances. The specific location of the Eastern Townships with their proximity to the large US market provides them a better access and more interaction with the United States businesses. Their unique bilingual population also adds an advantage of overcoming cultural barriers associated with international business. It is expected that the unique geographic characteristics of the Eastern Townships will influence the export marketing behaviour of SMEs located in the Eastern Townships.\n\nDr. Rutihinda has been awarded funding by the Senate Research Committee for his project on the role of foreign direct investment on SMEs in the pre-emerging economy of Tanzania. The study assumes that the impact of foreign direct investment on SMEs will be influenced by four main factors: foreign firm characteristics, characteristics of host country’s SMEs, the institutional environment, and the economic environment. So far research has been done on the more affluent developing countries such as those in Eastern Europe, South Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Very little has been done on the countries at the lowest ranks in economic development. By providing empirical evidences on Tanzania, one of the least developed countries in the world, this study will provide avenues for radically different findings that may contributes towards filling up the current theoretical and empirical gap. By providing empirical evidence and constructs on the interaction processes between international firms and SMEs, this study will benefit policy makers in both developed and developing countries as well as business managers of transnational firms and SMEs.\n\nDr. Rutihinda’s Publications\n\nBOOKS\n\nRutihinda, C (1996) Resource-based Internationalization: Entry Strategies of Swedish Firms into the Emerging Markets of Eastern Europe.

He also studied the economics of art auctions, comparing auction results in Canada and the United States, and clarifying the relationship between pre-auction estimates and realized hammer prices.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Valsan researches corporate governance. More specifically, he is investigating the ownership of the publicly held Canadian corporation listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Sylvie Béquet leaves behind her two children, Amélie and Alex, as well as colleagues and friends within the Bishop’s community.\n\nSylvie Bequet’s Biography\n\nSylvie Béquet began her teaching career at Bishop’s in 1983 and was still a member of faculty in the Williams School of Business (WSB), at the time of her passing. Her area of expertise was finance, and over her career she was a teacher and mentor to innumerable students. She worked as a collaborator and consultant within the capital markets industry and had contributed to several scholarly publications over her career. She also held the position of Dean of the WSB from 2005-08.\n\nPerhaps her single most important contribution to the WSB was as the principal advisor for the SEED Portfolio. Established in 2000, this gives hands on investment experience to students as they manage a real money portfolio over their two years in the program.\n\nProfessor Bill Robson, also a former Dean of the WSB, commented, “Sylvie produced students with great strategic skill who could immediately see the big picture. Over my time coaching the teams participating in the NIBS (Network of International Business Schools) case competitions, every time we had a portfolio manager from the SEED program on our team, we invariably won the competition that year. She was a great teacher and her loss will be felt for years within the school.”\n\nThe WSB is setting up a special fund in Professor Béquet’s memory in order to assist high performing students in the SEED Portfolio.\n\nDonations can be made online.
