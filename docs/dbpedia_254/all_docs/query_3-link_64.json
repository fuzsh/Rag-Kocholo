        "text": "‚ú® Super excited to share what we've been working on this spring/summer at the University of Waterloo (and across Canada) ‚ú® In response to the call for applications to Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)'s $50M Lab to Market funding opportunity, we've assembled a network of over 60 organizations (and counting!) across Canada to create a wicked new type of experiential learning opportunity with a singular focus on reducing the barriers often faced by individuals interested in exploring entrepreneurship. We're calling individuals in these paid co-op/internship roles Impact Creators. The network (and training) we've co-developed to support them is called the Canadian THRIVE Network. üåç The focus is on reducing barriers to impact creation in Human, Planetary, and Animal Health through streamlining social venture creation, start-up development, and research commercialization. The Canadian THRIVE Network uses the power of community to scale the strength of individual organizational capabilities nationally. Here are the THRIVE Five ways we aim enable more impact creation: 1. Reduce barriers of geographic distance and lack of time through grants to pay for travel to people, places, and programs that help accelerate success and expenses that would be incurred to engage in such activities (e.g., childcare). 2. Provide immersive opportunities where trainees can visit new contexts to observe challenges and find unmet needs that should be addressed to create impact in human, animal, and/or planetary health. 3. Increase access to in-person and virtual social networks of those who do, those who guide, and those who support impact creation. 4. Double down on the stories of value being created for society and strengthen narratives of great work being done by under-recognized impact creators. 5. Enhance access to inclusive innovation training for founders, leaders, and funders so we can work together to address unhelpful stereotypes, biases, and systemic obstacles to full participation in entrepreneurship. Attached are pictures of the four Impact Creators who have been inspiring the development of this Network over the summer as well as highlights from our working session with collaborators in June. üòä Follow me for updates on what Ayra Ali, Serena Dosanjh, Sarah Kwok and Preet Grewal did this summer during the pilot program.

In addition to our Annual General Meeting (AGM), our evening discussion will focus on the important topic of physician recruitment. We hope you will join us for a panel discussion about what can and is being done to address the unprecedented shortage of physicians in the Ontario from recruitment, retention, strategy, policy, and practical perspectives. And perhaps most importantly.. mixing and mingling with an amazing group of health professionals from across Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, and other surrounding communities! :) Thank you so much to St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton for hosting us.

The University of Waterloo, McMaster University, and the University of Toronto are collaborating with an exciting network of organizations across Canada on a new type of immersive training opportunity for undergraduate and Masters level students.

Dick\n\nSince starting at Velocity a five months ago, I have been nothing short of impressed. The Velocity team has no limits to what they are able to accomplish. Best thing? Our founders and Alum are just as ambitious as we are. Looking forward to the Innovation Arena: the new home of Velocity, our amazing community, and partners supporting the increasingly thriving world-class innovation system we are building. Have an idea? Apply to join us. Want to get involved as a part-time advisor or partner? Email me at sarrah.lal@uwaterloo.ca and let's get the conversation going. What a time to be part of the region! üëèüèª Adrien C√¥t√© John A. G. Dick Akash Vaswani Brandon Van Dam, MBA Jeremy C. H.

We are growing Velocity's advisory network. As a top-performing venture building system that has supported the development of over 400 companies since 2008, we know it takes a community to unlock the potential of ambitious people, ideas, and technologies. In only 15 years, our companies have gone on to raise over $3.5B USD in venture capital and have a collective enterprise value of over $25B USD. We are looking for top-performing industry experts and entrepreneurs with the knowledge, skills, and stories they can share with our remarkable founders, as they progress from idea to Series A. This is a paid opportunity, with a time commitment of less than 8 hours per week. If you're interested, email me at sarrah.lal@uwaterloo.ca with your resume, a statement of what type of expertise you'd bring to the the table (which industry; specific knowledge, skills, and experiences you have that sets you apart), and a quick note about what you believe is most needed in the Canadian entrepreneurship ecosystem. Talk soon! #entrepreneurship #opportunity #founders #network\n\nHappy (belated) International Women's Day! With the theme of #embraceequity it was so inspiring to start the morning off with a breakfast alongside Velocity staff and our remarkable start-up teams. It was the first of many conversations we will be having about increasing equity in entrepreneurship. Here's the best part: actions that move the needle (and support amazing efforts that increase inclusivity of innovation like Femtech Canada) will follow. (As we know, all talk and no action can only do so much). Rebecca and I were reflecting on the issue of low representation in entrepreneurship yesterday during a class we teach on navigating complexity. The absence of equity, inclusive practices and diversity of identities in entrepreneurship requires us to take a step back and really re-think how we do things. And I was reminded of this again this morning when I read what KTH Royal Institute of Technology is doing (https://bit.ly/3ZSWV7d) to address lack of representation. The takeaway? We need to think harder about how entrepreneurship systems are set up to make sure they are inclusive for all individuals with entrepreneurial ambitions. It's not a one-solution-fixes-everything situation. If you want to follow us on this journey, 1. Join our Equity in Entrepreneurship Council https://bit.ly/3F7oYYQ 2. Stay up-to-date with our Towards Better Representation in Entrepreneurship series (below) 3. Reach out to chat Thank you to the Rachel Sydney Danielle Margaret Myra Avneet Stephanie and so many others for always pushing for more representation in entrepreneurship. Thank you to the Velocity team especially Michelle Tina Krysta Hillary Kristen Parisa Karen Naomi for what was possible yesterday in large part thanks to you. And thank you Adrien for your empowering leadership style - if we had more people like you in leadership roles, the world would be a much better and equitable place. Here's to always doing better! üôå #leadership #entrepreneurship #team #thankyou University of Waterloo Fran Amber Milica Moazam Ross Akash Patrycja Armen John Elliot Dale Abubaker Amir Faith Scott Scott Sean Hanna Paul"
