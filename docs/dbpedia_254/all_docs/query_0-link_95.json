        "text": "UNB Law is a prestigious law school based in Atlantic Canada, which offers courses to Canadian and international students. On this page, you will learn about special qualities, admission requirements, enrolment statistics, tuition fees, scholarships, and the curriculum of UNB Law JD programs.\n\nLaw School Summary\n\nThere are various factors that make New Brunswick Law School different compared to other schools in Canada.\n\nStrengths of UNB Law\n\nStatistics from 2016 confirmed that 90% of the Law School’s graduates secured articling clerkships in either private corporations or public bodies. This is owed to the learning and development opportunities presented to students, namely in developing a business understanding through the combined Law and Business (JD/MBA) program.\n\nYou can also develop your potential at the University of New Brunswick Legal Clinic with focus on employment law, tenant law and social benefits, plus the historical Law Journal. Finally, students are able to enjoy a broad variety of societies, such as the Business Law Society, Criminal Law Society, Environmental Law Society, International Law Society and the OUTlaw and Pro Bono Students Canada.\n\nFind out about Every Type of Law Degree in Canada.\n\nSpecial Qualities of UNB Law\n\nThe University of New Brunswick Law has established exchange programs with partnering institutions from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the West Indies, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWhen it comes to connections with law firms, the University of New Brunswick attracts a formidable bundle of law firms as its financial aid sponsors. They include: Border Ladner Gervais, Stewart McKelvey, Gowling WLG (Canada), McInnes Cooper and Blake, Cassels & Graydon. Aspiring lawyers. Watch out as your sponsors will be keeping an eye on your performance in academia and extracurricular activities!\n\nFirst-year classes are split into groups of approximately 45 students. There is no better way to use the more personalized teaching as an asset in getting ahead of the competition to enter the legal industry.\n\nUNB Law Admissions\n\nThe final application deadline by which all documents forming one’s application package must be received by the admissions office is March 1 of the intake year.\n\nCheck out possible alternatives with a 2-Year Accelerated LLB Degree in the UK.\n\nUndergraduate Degree\n\nTo be eligible to apply, one must have a degree from a recognized Canadian university or a degree from a non-Canadian university acceptable by UNB Law. The degree would typically equal 90-credit three-year programs or 120-credit four-year programs.\n\nGPA\n\nThe grade point average (GPA) one would likely need to secure a place at the UNB Law School is 3.7 out of 4.3, albeit the minimal GPA is 2.7. The New Brunswick Law School calculates its GPA as follows: A- to A+ (3.7 to 4.3); B+ to A+ (3.3 to 4.3); B- to B+ (2.7 to 3.3) and C+ (2.3) and above.\n\nLSAT\n\nGPAs are weighted at 40%, whereas one’s LSAT score would be taken at 60%. The University does not accept LSAT scores below 150, although in practice those with results of 158 and above tend to be the highest achievers. The LSAT is to be sat by February of the intake year at the latest.\n\nResume\n\nResumes detailing one’s education, work experience and community involvement must be forwarded to the Admissions Committee.\n\nPersonal Statement\n\nMoreover, personal statements also form part of UNB Law requirements. Most tend to be around one-two pages, but there are no minimal/maximum length frameworks.\n\nMinority candidates (e.g. Indigenous or applicants with impairments) can disclose any circumstances relevant to their UNB Law School application, e.g. Indigenous community engagement and disabilities.\n\nEnrolment Statistics\n\nThe UNB Law School is a smaller educational institution, therefore, enrolment rates are unsurprisingly lighter as well.\n\n92 students are principally accepted each year.\n\n715 applications were submitted in 2017 and under the above-mentioned volume of offers.\n\nOther than that, there are a total of 265 students across the New Brunswick Law School and a faculty staff of 21 (having previously been 16).\n\nThus, the UNB Law acceptance rate stands around 13%.\n\nInterestingly, the proportions between students and teachers come down to 14:1 – a ratio very few other North American universities can mirror. The University of New Brunswick Law receives many applications from local graduates from: St. Stephen’s University, McKenzie College, Crandall University, Lansbridge University, and Université de Moncton.\n\nStudent Finance Information\n\nTuition\n\nWe have presumed that the upper-year fees would be the same as those for the entry year because they are not officially listed. UNB Law tuition estimates are listed below:\n\nCanadian citizens International students International Differential fee (per year) N/A $10,046 CDN First-year fees $13,522 CDN $13,522 CDN Second- and Third-year fees (per year) $13,522 CDN $13,522 CDN Compulsory student fees $948.50 CDN $948.50 CDN Estimated textbooks’ costs (for the whole program) $2,000 CDN $2,000 CDN Law school application fee $125 CDN $125 CDN Reservation of seat application fee $300 CDN $300 CDN Additional living expenses per year $15,000 CDN to $19,200 CDN $15,000 CDN to $19,200 CDN Three-year total fees $103,436.5 CDN $133,574.5 CDN\n\nScholarships\n\nIn principle, first-year applicants are automatically entered in the draw for the next scholarship recipients, although some UNB Law scholarships may require individual applications. Only full-time University of New Brunswick upper-year students (i.e. excluding other categories, such as exchange students) can also apply for scholastic aid. The University of New Brunswick has more than 115 different scholarships, bursaries, prizes and medals to reward the academic and extracurricular accomplishments of its students.\n\nApplication-based scholarship incentives include:\n\nThe Lord Beaverbrook Scholarships in Law of $54,000 CDN per student awarded to three people;\n\nTwo $14,000 CDN scholarships each under the Honourable Charles J. A. Hughes and Edith B. Hughes Scholarships fund;\n\nThe $10,000 CDN Tore Grude Scholarship;\n\nThe $10,000 CDN Stephen Smith Scholarship;\n\nThe Cherrill Edwina Shea and Carl Robert Aron Law $7,500 CDN Scholarship; and\n\nOther scholarships with value as low as $500 CDN.\n\nThere are several non application-based scholarships, including:\n\nThe Wayne Carson Scholarship in Law ($5,000 CDN);\n\nThe Law Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador Centennial Entrance Scholarship ($3,000 CDN);\n\nThe Law Foundation of Nova Scotia Entrance Scholarship ($2,000 CDN); and\n\nThe Stewart McKelvey Diversity Scholarship ($1,000 CDN).\n\nUpper-year financial assistance is available in the form of these scholarships:\n\nThe Border Ladner Gervais Professional Excellence Award ($1,500 CDN);\n\nThe Blake, Cassels & Graydon Scholarship ($5,000 CDN);\n\nThe Canadian Bar Association (NB Branch) Award ($1,000 CDN);\n\nThe Cape Breton Barristers’ Society Scholarship ($1,000 CDN);\n\nThe Case Family Scholarship in Business Law ($2,500 CDN);\n\nThe David Covert Scholarship ($2,500 CDN);\n\nThe Frank Covert Scholarship ($5,000 CDN);\n\nThe Kelly A. Driscoll Prof. Cor. Scholarship ($2,500 CDN);\n\nThe France and Mario Giamberardino Scholarship ($1,750 CDN);\n\nThe D. Gordon Hunter and Lawson A. W. Hunter Excellence in Law Scholarship ($6,000 CDN);\n\nThe Frank McKenna Scholarship ($3,000 CDN);\n\nThe Zoe Odei Scholarship ($6,500 CDN);\n\nThe Pei Law Foundation Centennial Scholarship ($2,000 CDN);\n\nThe A. Frederick Richard Scholarship ($5,000 CDN);\n\nThe Honourable William F. Ryan Scholarship ($12,000 CDN);\n\nThe Stewart McKelvey Scholarship ($4,500 CDN); and\n\nThe Frederick D. Toole Memorial Scholarship ($4,500) amongst other smaller scholastic awards.\n\nBursaries are also available. For instance, the $2,000 CDN Blanche Fowler Bursary and the $1,000 CDN Charles Richards Bursary, but their value does not replicate the maximum of that of the scholarships.\n\nThe final category of awards includes:\n\nThe Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP Prize in Advocacy ($1,500 CDN);\n\nThe Law Faculty Prize ($1,000 CDN);\n\nThe Lawson A. W. Hunter, Q.C. Prize in Conflict of Laws ($1,200 CDN);\n\nThe McInnes Cooper Prize in Corporate Law & Taxation ($500 CDN); and\n\nThe McInnes Cooper Prize in Trial Practice ($500 CDN).\n\nThe Curriculum at UNB Faculty of Law\n\nMany UNB Law courses allow students to explore various areas of law, develop an interest in one, and potentially specialize in it. It offers programs for full-time/part-time studies.\n\nFirst-Year\n\nNo optional modules are incorporated in the first-year curriculum. Although the syllabus is designed to include all key elements to legal education, which are:\n\nFoundations of Law;\n\nConstitutional Law;\n\nCriminal Law;\n\nContracts;\n\nProperty;\n\nTorts; and\n\nLegal Research and Advocacy (featuring a mooting segment).\n\nUpper-Years\n\nThe following courses are to be mandatorily completed at the Law School of the University of New Brunswick during Years Two and Three:\n\nAdministrative Law;\n\nEvidence;\n\nCivil Procedure;\n\nCommercial Law;\n\nBusiness Organizations;\n\nConflict of Laws; and\n\nProfessional Conduct.\n\nA change of the syllabus affecting everyone commencing the Juris Doctor program in September 2021 meant that three courses from these compulsory study channels must now be taken:\n\nA single module from the Perspectives and Theories stream; accompanied by\n\nTwice the number of modules from the Core Competencies study field.\n\nStudents can select their electives from this next list of optional modules:\n\nCorporate Law; or\n\nCommercial Law; and\n\nLabour and Employment Law;\n\nTax Law;\n\nProperty Law; plus\n\nInternational Law.\n\nAlthough not officially listed as elective modules, performing well in the following modules may supplement your degree score and student experience:\n\nClinical opportunities;\n\nThe UNB Law Journal;\n\nCompetitive mooting; and\n\nThe Law Internship scheme.\n\nMore About UNB Law School\n\nNew Brunswick’s metropolitan capital Fredericton is home to just over 100,000 inhabitants, of which less than 300 are current law students at the School of Law. UNB Law Library is conveniently located on campus and is named after Gérard V. La Forest.\n\nInitial hopes to establish a credible legal education provider were placed in Saint John’s King’s College Law School. However, it was later substituted by Fredericton’s facilities, stemming from the generous sponsorship of the Canadian-British newspaper magnate and politician Lord Beaverbrook. He was also very closely affiliated with Winston Churchill.\n\nThe University is close to the Knowledge Park for research cybersecurity and technology. It is also a close contestant for the oldest Commonwealth’s university – it comes just second following its creation in 1892.\n\nThe University of New Brunswick School of Law has produced many capable public personnel with local contributions, namely, regional Premiers and Chief Justices, and some Federal Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Canada staff."
