        "text": "Editor's Notes\n\nReview each of the Principles Principle 1: Teaching and research must be consistently reaffirmed as the twin pillars of the University, and central to the core purpose, mandate, and Academic Plan of Lakehead University. Principle 2: Clear support and direction from senior administration, campus leaders charged with making financial decisions, and key figures in each faculty is necessary for innovation and excellence in teaching and learning, as well as the successful transition to new forms of teaching and learning. Principle 3: Lakehead University should support and celebrate innovation and excellence in teaching and learning. Principle 4: Lakehead University should take pride in and further welcome a diversity of learners. The University should take pride in its reputation as a university committed to equity and access. It should foster an institution-wide culture to match the diverse student body and make teaching accessible to all students. Principle 5: Wherever possible, the University must work to create synergies between teaching and research to ensure they inform each other.\n\nOne of the key recommendations of the Provost’s task force was to create a new “Teaching and Learning” committee, tasked with strategic and pedagogical matters related to the best methods of teaching at Lakehead University. The recommendation was embraced by many members of the Senate standing committees and was successfully approved last month.\n\nTo build upon our teaching successes we must foster a culture where teaching and learning matter—a culture built on the principles of collaboration and adequate support to create the conditions for innovation and excellence. Lakehead University has a long history of success in teaching and learning and a well-established reputation as a “value added” institution. We believe that investments in teaching and learning will be felt across the institution in terms of recruitment and retention, as well as in student, faculty, and staff engagement.\n\nThe PTF describes a new centre that is “a hub of teaching and learning activities” and “a key centre to facilitate a culture of collaboration” (p 10). The report recommends organizing based on a hub and spoke model.\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the PTF to establish a senior position responsible for T &amp; L, while being mindful of the need to have someone assume responsibility for bringing to life the Vison for a Commons, I appointed University Librarian Karen K to lead the development of the Teaching Common Many of you may be unaware that Karen brings along with her librarian knowledge and experience, a wealth of expertise in the T &amp; L area On the Saint John campus of the University of New Brunswick Karen was responsible for leading library, information technology and instructional technology programs, including technology in the classroom and the course management system Journey began at Red River College where I participated in the Certificate of Adult Education As Information Literacy Coordinator at University of Winnipeg worked closely with faculty on integrating information literacy learning outcomes into existing courses\n\nFormer location of Library Technical Services – Library technical services was relocated to 3rd floor of Paterson in November 2016\n\nKaren take it over\n\nWindow looks on to ATAC (North)\n\nKaren – Purpose to create a warm, welcoming space for faculty …. designed to be flexible and be able to integrate existing and emerging technology\n\nA space that will accommodate …..\n\nThe Classroom located in L150002 will be a Learning studio for the COmmons\n\nDonation was given to the CEDL to enhance techonology in this room Furniture that can easily be moved around to accommodate a variety of collaborative learning strategies\n\nFlexible furniture Everything on wheels to be moved around This is a photo from the newly renovated teaching and learning centre at Concordia University.\n\nMoira – take over\n\nSoTL invites professionals to examine their own classroom practice, record their successes and failures, and ultimately share their experiences so that others may reflect on their findings and build upon teaching and learning processes.\n\nThe proposed draft organization chart with mapping to the PTF recommendations"
