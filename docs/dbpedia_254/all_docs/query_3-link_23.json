The project, called “Scranton’s Story, Our Nation’s Story,” involves multiple community partners and relates Scranton’s industrial, religious and ethnically diverse heritage and aspirations to the history of the nation, responding to the NEH special initiative “A More Perfect Union” commemorating the upcoming 250th anniversary of the United States. The project also seeks to share underrepresented Scranton stories, including that of recent immigrants, Black Scrantonians and Indigenous history, in order to stitch together a full local and national narrative.\n\nThe University was among just 239 projects in the nation to receive NEH support and among 16 projects in Pennsylvania to receive funding. The grants awarded “demonstrate the resilience and breadth of our nation’s humanities institutions and practitioners,” said NEH’s Acting Chairman Adam Wolfson in a news release announcing $28.4 million in funding support for the 239 projects.\n\n“We are grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities for its support of this important project for the University, Scranton and the nation,” said Rev. Joseph Marina, S.J., president of The University of Scranton. “The humanities play an integral part of the transformational nature of the Jesuit education we provide to our students. This project will give our students and the greater community a more profound understanding of the human transformations that have occurred in the lives of Scrantonians and Americans.”\n\n“We have lots of stories to tell about how the Electric City has powered and shaped our great nation over the course of our history, and I can’t think of anyone better to lift them up than The University of Scranton,” said Rep. Matt Cartwright. “I am very much looking forward to seeing the results of this project, but I know it will offer all of us new reasons to be proud of our Northeastern Pennsylvania ties.”\n\n“Scranton’s Story, Our Nation’s Story” incorporates eight themes ranging from how Scranton has been portrayed in the popular imagination, to its industrial era growth, Indigenous history, religious tapestry, diverse immigrant populations – past and present – and the role it played in the Underground Railroad and Black history. Throughout, civic engagement, founding debates, and local and national identity will be explored by considering how the Scranton, and American, story may be understood anew 250 years later and the roles and responsibilities of local citizens.\n\nThe programs will involve lectures with question and answer interactive sessions, panel discussions with audience responses, public facilitated dialogues, and story exchanges, as well as walking and bus tours, youth writing workshops, and oral history story collection and community mapping projects that will provide new humanities material and content for discussion.\n\n“As a broad team of university faculty and community organization partners, we are proud and excited to be able to highlight Scranton’s multi-faceted story in the context of our nation’s story with the support of the NEH,” said Julie Schumacher Cohen, assistant vice president for Community and Government Affairs and Project Director. “All events will enable audience and community participation and engagement, drawing on humanities resources in history, literature, philosophy and religious studies and facilitate story-telling and dialogue to build civic engagement.”\n\nCohen noted the facilitated dialogues are based on public and student dialogues run by the University combining the reflective, structured dialogue methods of non-profit Essential Partners and the non-sectarian tradition of reflection and discernment of St. Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nEvents will begin in Oct. 2021 and end in fall 2023.\n\nCommunity organizations collaborating on the project include: Black Scranton Project, Center for the Living City, Lackawanna County Arts and Culture Department, The Lackawanna Historical Society, Lackawanna County Immigration Inclusion Committee, Narrative 4, the Scranton Area Ministerium, United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania and WVIA.\n\nThe project comprises a range of University offices. In addition to Cohen, project team members include, from The University of Scranton: Patrick Clark, PhD., associate professor of theology and religious studies; David J. Dzurec, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of History; Colleen Farry, assistant professor and digital services librarian; Teresa A. Grettano, Ph.D.; associate professor of English and theatre; Gregory W. Jordan, executive director of the Slattery Center for the Humanities; Aiala Levy, Ph.D., assistant professor of history, Latin American studies, and women’s and gender studies; Michelle Maldonado, Ph.D., dean of the College of Arts and Sciences; Matthew Meyer, Ph.D., associate professor of philosophy and faculty director of the Gail and Francis Slattery Center for the Humanities; Sondra Myers, senior fellow for international, civic and cultural projects and director of the Schemel Forum; Jessica A. Nolan, Ph.D., professor of psychology; Adam J. Pratt, Ph.D., associate professor of history; Sheli E. Pratt-McHugh, assistant dean of the Weinberg Memorial Library; Hank Willenbrink, Ph.D., Theatre Program director and associate professor of English and theatre; and Carolyn M. Bonacci, community and civic engagement coordinator. Community humanities partners include: Erika Funke, senior producer, classical producer and program host at WVIA Public Media; Maureen McGuigan, director of the Lackawanna County Arts and Culture Department; Glynis Johns, founder and CEO of the Black Scranton Project; Sarah Piccini, assistant director of the Lackawanna Historical Society; and Mary Ann Moran-Savakinus, director of the Lackawanna Historical Society.\n\n$content.getChild('content').textValue\n\nThe 20th Annual U.S. Conference on disAbility at The University of Scranton will be held in a virtual format on Oct. 14.

Since 2019, through a partnership with AllOne Foundation, the conference has focused on “Exploring Autism Across the Spectrum: Building Inclusive Communities.”\n\nPast Conference on disAbility keynote speakers include John Hockenberry, an Emmy Award-winning journalist; Richard Pimentel, disability rights activist and subject of the film “Music Within;” Most Reverend Joseph E. Kurtz, D.D., former president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Louisville, Kentucky; actor R.J.

Rick Curry, S.J, Dr. Edward Hallowell, Jonathan Mooney, Nelson Lauver, Kerry Magro, Ph.D., and Dr. Temple Grandin, world-renowned animal behaviorist and autism spokesperson. U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey Jr., also spoke at several conferences.\n\nAnother constant presence at the conferences has been Dr. Bruch, who has had a role in the conferences since they began in 2002.\n\n“The conference will offer participants a chance to explore best practices, increase their knowledge of resources, technology and legislation, and develop advocacy skills that can help school-age students with disabilities,” said Dr. Bruch in 2002. The U.S. Conference on disAbilities continues to provide world-class resources and information to empower individuals with disAbilities to meet their full potential as well as the families and professionals who help them.\n\nA look at the U.S. Conference on disAbility over the years.\n\nThe 11th Annual Downtown Scavenger Hunt is announced for Welcome Weekend 2021. This year’s event will run from 1 PM on Thursday, September 2nd through 9 PM Friday, September 3rd following the modified format introduced last year with students participating in the hunt asynchronously. New this year is an additional First Friday event on Sept. 3 from 5-9 p.m. outside of Brown Hall located at 600 Linden Street. The first 100 Hunt participants to stop by the First Friday event will receive a free Scavenger Hunt t-shirt featuring the Scavenger Hunt logo.\n\nThe annual Scavenger Hunt is offered in partnership with The Center for Student Engagement, The University of Scranton Small Business Development Center, and The Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce & Metro Action, and Scranton Tomorrow. This event offers students a unique opportunity to explore downtown Scranton area and to learn more about our small businesses, cultural venues, and unique features, such as landmarks and murals. This year’s Hunt features 31 participating downtown partners.\n\nThe 2021 Scavenger Hunt will not be timed and students can participate in it over a 2-day period. All students must follow the Royals Back Together plan along with business guidelines if they choose to enter a business. Hunt clues featuring our University’s “Iggy” mascot will be shared via QR codes and be displayed in business windows to keep the hunt entirely outdoors.\n\nHunt participants can compete in additional photo contests by visiting a list of downtown historical landmarks and murals, take photos, and submit these to community@scranton.edu to win a grand prize. There will also be a contest for the most creative photo overall. These photo contests offer students additional chances to win great prizes and new ways to engage with the downtown area.\n\nRegistration with waiver is required in Royal Sync (see event listing). Students can also register by scanning the QR codes on Scavenger Hunt posters located around campus. Registered students will receive an email on Thursday, September 2nd with a special downtown map and rules sheet that will detail how the scavenger hunt will proceed. A smartphone will be necessary to scan QR codes that will unlock clues at different locations.\n\nTo our new students, Class of 2025, welcome! To our returning students, welcome back! The scavenger hunt is a great way for students to learn about their new home while supporting local businesses! When the time comes, be sure to register and find as many locations as you can.\n\nFor more information about the annual Scavenger Hunt and the greater Scranton area, follow The Office of Community Relations on Facebook @uscrantoncommunityrelations and on Instagram and Twitter @uofscommunity or contact by email at community@scranton.edu.\n\nThe University of Scranton’s Schemel Forum returns this fall with three evening courses that will be delivered both in-person and remotely.\n\nCovering a range of stimulating and timely topics, the courses will be taught in six weekly sessions from 6 to 7:15 p.m. in room 305 of the University’s Weinberg Memorial Library, with Zoom links provided via email for those who would like to attend remotely.\n\nThe courses are free for University students, faculty, staff and Schemel Forum members. For non-members, the in-person fee is $75 per individual and $125 per couple, and $60 for remote-only.\n\nPaul Sampson, Ph.D., assistant professor of history at the University, will present “Trust the Science? A Political History of Science,” Thursday evenings Sept. 9, 16, 23 and 30 and Oct. 7 and 14.\n\nSampson will use the course to examine how conventional scientific views on subjects like climate change, vaccinations, the theory of evolution and even the shape of the earth have become controversial among some in contemporary American society by linking these ideas to the history of modern science, which emerged as an attempt to avoid political and religious disagreement by viewing nature with “objectivity.”\n\nAmong other things, the course will look at the creationist vs. geological conceptions of Earth’s origins, debates surrounding Darwin’s theory of evolution and the rise and fall of eugenics practices to get a sense of how political and religious concerns have always played a role in scientific work.\n\nThe goal, Sampson said, is to show how scientific ideas and practices have a history, and to better understand how that history and the place of scientists within the wider society continues to influence and inform scientific work.\n\n“This course is essentially a condensed version of the History of Science course I teach at the University,” Sampson said. “The standard version of the history of science that most people were taught begins in Europe around 1600 and focuses on ‘geniuses’ who made astounding discoveries and cleared away ‘superstitious’ ideas about the nature and the universe. What I try to do in my course is to show that the story is much more complicated than that. Science has never been exclusive to Europe; it has always involved large networks of people rather than lone ‘geniuses,’ and there has always been a lot of interaction between science, religion and politics.”\n\nSampson said he’s very excited to be participating in the Schemel Forum.\n\n“I am a strong believer in making history public and accessible, and I am glad that the University is helping to make that happen,” he said. “I am also looking forward to continuing some of the conversations that I started with my students and hearing the thoughts of the lifelong learners here in Scranton.”\n\nJoe Kraus, Ph.D., professor and chair of the University’s Department of English and Theatre and president of MELUS (Society for the Study of Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States), will present the course, “Invisible Men: Novels by Ralph Ellison and Viet Thanh Nguyen,” Monday evenings Sept. 13, 20 and 27 and Oct. 4, 18 and 25.\n\nDuring the sessions, Kraus and the class will explore W.E.B. DuBois’s concept of double-consciousness and its adaptation into Ralph Ellison’s concept of invisibility in his iconic novel, “Invisible Man.” From there, the class will read Viet Thanh Nguyen’s “The Sympathizer” to see how those concepts were reworked in an Asian-American context.\n\nKevin Nordberg, Ph.D., professor emeritus of philosophy and Latin American studies at the University, will present “Social and Moral Issues in Information Technology” Wednesday evenings Oct. 6, 13, 20 and 27 and Nov. 3 and 10.\n\nThroughout the course, Nordberg will cover a number of relevant technological issues, including intellectual property, software and music video piracy, liability for defective software, privacy, free speech, facial recognition and computer crime. Among the questions that will be posed -- Is the internet used as a distraction technology rather than an informative technology?\n\nTo register for the courses, contact Alicen Morrison, Schemel Forum assistant, at 570-941-6206 or alicen.morrison@scranton.edu.

The plan incorporates the University’s previously announced COVID-19 vaccine requirement for students and employees.\n\nThe plan also takes into account the latest health and safety recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Pennsylvania Department of Health (PA DOH), including flexibility to adjust the plans masking and other health requirements based on the virus spread within the local community.\n\nVaccinated individuals do not need to participate in COVID-19 surveillance testing. Following CDC guidelines, the University will adjust indoor masking requirements for vaccinated individuals based on community spread. A Mask Status tile on the Royals Back Together webpage will indicate if masks are required indoors for vaccinated individuals. (Currently, the University is following its summer plan, which requires all individuals to wear masks indoors.) Throughout the semester, masks can be worn by individuals if they prefer, and faculty and staff can require masks be worn in their offices, classroom or labs if desired.\n\nIn accordance with Pennsylvania law, students and employees may request a waiver to the vaccine requirement for religious or medical reasons. For students or employees who are granted a vaccine waiver, the Royals Back Together plan requires weekly COVID-19 surveillance testing, mask requirements when indoors or in crowded spaces outdoors where social distancing cannot be met, daily health screenings via a wellness app, as well as specific quarantine and isolation instructions and other health and safety guidelines.\n\nStudents who are required to quarantine or isolate must do so off-campus during the fall semester. The University will provide temporary areas for quarantine and isolation if needed while off-campus arrangements are being made.\n\nThe Royals Back Together plan reminds members of the University community of their individual responsibility to follow guidelines to protect the health and well-being of themselves and others.\n\nThe Royals Back Together plan also addresses cleaning protocols, health services, student life, athletics and a number of other critical areas, including contact tracing procedures. The plan also recognizes the need to continue to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nMove-in for the fall semester is Saturday and Sunday, Aug. 28 and 29. Classes resume on Monday, Aug. 30.\n\nMore information about the plan is available on the Royals Back Together webpage.\n\nJillian Haller '23 is interning as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Jong-Hyun Son’s neurodevelopment lab and working on a project she designed, \"Olfactory-Driven Anxiety-like Behavior in the Zebrafish Model.\"\n\nHere, she answers questions about her experience.\n\nDescribe a typical day at the lab.\n\nI arrive at the lab in the morning (anywhere from 8 a.m.-10 a.m.) and begin either writing out or reading my protocol for that day. I always make sure to check in with Dr. Son before I begin collecting the materials I need for whatever I am doing that day. Once I’m done with the tests or procedures I need to run, I wrap up for the day and head home.\n\nWhat is the duration of your research?\n\nI work on my research year-round, but for the summer I stayed in Scranton so I could work on my project. This enabled me to give it more focus and attention than I typically can during the academic year. The number of hours I put in each day varies anywhere from 4-9 depending upon what I have on my to-do list for that day.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about your research?\n\nThe independence I have gained while conducting my own research study has to be my favorite thing about my job. It has allowed me to develop critical thinking skills far beyond what I ever could have imagined. Being able to see my work and seedlings of ideas grow for the last two years has been incredibly rewarding and an experience that has inspired my future career path. I have been able to watch myself fail and get back up again more times than I can count throughout this project, but I have discovered that it is through these failures and shortcomings I learn the most.\n\nWhat are some of the skills you have learned?\n\nI imagine the most valuable skill I have learned is time management. I am admittedly a long-time procrastinator, and I knew I needed to improve upon this skill going into this job. Running my own research project has forced me to create schedules for myself and adhere to the four to-do lists I have running.\n\nIn the laboratory, however, I learn a new skill almost every day. From enhancing my ability to think on my toes to learn how to use equipment like the confocal microscope or Cryostat, Dr. Son is helping me build up quite the repertoire of lab techniques I will use for the rest of my life. Dr. Son has also recognized some of my weaknesses in the lab and has helped me improve upon those throughout my time working with him. One such weakness, my mental math skills, is one he is determined to help me improve through constantly asking me how to make certain solutions without the use of a calculator.\n\nWhat were your expectations of the job? Does it match the reality?\n\nI had expected this job to be rewarding, but not without challenge. So far, it has met my expectations. I had envisioned myself learning how to devise a scientific experiment and gaining more independence along with confidence each day. Since starting I have experienced just that, and it has been an experience that has altered my life and aspirations. One thing I did not accurately envision was the number of obstacles I would meet along the way. I had anticipated some missteps in my journey working in this lab, however, I underestimated the number of errors I would make. One thing I learned through Dr. Son is not to be discouraged by the things that may go wrong in the lab; that’s simply science. Coming back from your mistakes and adjusting without quitting is where the learning takes place. From this, I have discovered that mistakes are oftentimes more valuable than triumphs.\n\nPictured, clockwise from top left: Haller's workbench while immunostaining brain tissue, so that she can image under the confocal microscope; Haller working at the microscope; Haller's setup for filming the behavior of her Zebrafishan; and an image captured under the confocal microscope of a tissue section of one of the brains Haller sliced and stained using immunohistochemistry.\n\nHow do you feel this job has prepared you for the real world?\n\nMost importantly, I think this job has inspired a redirection in career paths for me. I had gone into this summer with the vision of pursuing an M.D. after my time at Scranton. However, after this experience, research has become something I cannot see my life without, therefore I am now considering pursuing an M.D./Ph.D. instead. This job has fed my hunger for knowledge and love for science more than I thought it could and has equipped me with the skills necessary to continue pursuing my career goal.\n\nLastly, understanding how to cope with failures and turn them into lessons learned has been a skill I will utilize in my future career. I also realize that this skill is easily translated into life outside of academia, as I find myself handling my personal setbacks with grace and an open mind.\n\nThe University of Scranton’s new Center for Ethics and Excellence in Public Service will offer its inaugural workshop “An Introduction to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for NEPA Government Official” on Tuesday, Aug. 31. The workshop, offered free of charge offered free of charge to county and city officials of Northeastern Pennsylvania via Zoom, will run from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and will be facilitated by DNG Consulting, an independent diversity, inclusion and equity consulting group (see attached flyer for facilitator bios).

Registration is required to participate in the event and can be completed online or by e-mailing ceeps@scranton.edu.\n\nThe University of Scranton Center for Ethics and Excellence and Public Service is focused on advocating for and promoting the common good of all through programs that support the development of ethical and competent public officials and of civically knowledgeable, responsible and engaged community members. Through education, collaboration and outreach, the Center seeks to support communities in Northeastern Pennsylvania in which local and state public officials and community members are dedicated to governance. The Center is housed in the University’s Political Science Department and is co-directed by Dr. Hopper and Jean Harris, Ph.D., professor of political science.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) named the University of Scranton’s student chapter as one of just five Outstanding Student Chapters in the nation for the 2020-2021 academic year. The IMA’s Award of Excellence is presented to the top student chapters that qualified for Gold Status.\n\nOfficers of the University’s IMA student chapter for 2020-2021 were: Grace Gallagher ’21 of Dalton, president; Ngoc Nguyen ’21 New Tripoli, vice president; Zeli-Anne Policarpio ’21 of South Plainfield, New Jersey, secretary; Sarin Baldante ’21 of Sayville, New York, treasurer; and Charles Csaszar of Hopewell Junction, New York, junior officer. Ashley Stampone, CPA, faculty specialist in the Accounting Department, serves as the faculty advisor for the University’s student chapter. Prof. Stampone received the IMA’s Ursel K. Albers IMA Campus Advocate of the Year Award for 2021. The award recognizes an IMA Campus Advocate/Student Chapter Advisor who has made significant contributions to the IMA overall and the IMA student members in particular.\n\nIn order to qualify for IMA’s student chapter Award of Excellence, the chapter had to facilitate/sponsor numerous student events and meetings including a new member orientation, a Certified Management Accountant (CMA) exam information session, ethics and other educational opportunities in addition to participating in the IMA’s national student case competition, its national student manuscript competition and the Student Leadership Conference.\n\nThe numerous events hosted by Scranton’s IMA student chapter during the academic year included a new member orientation, a remote internship panel discussion, a CMA exam information session, an accounting industry panel discussion and virtual office tours with BKD and PwC. In addition, the student officers coordinated an Easter Basket Drive within the Kania School of Management to support the Center for Service and Social Justice’s initiative to benefit Friends of the Poor. IMA student members also participated in the IMA’s Student Case Competition, the Clark Johnson Achievement Award Competition and the Student Manuscript Competition. The team consisting of Gallagher, Csaszar, Aidan Cagner of Rockville Centre, NY, and Annalisa Mechanick of Randolph, New Jersey, had their virtual presentation selected as a “Semi-Final 8” for the IMA Case Competition.\n\nGallagher also was awarded the IMA’s Memorial Education Fund Scholarship for 2020, The scholarship is presented annually to top accounting, finance, and IT students demonstrating exceptional commitment to the IMA and the management accounting profession, extraordinary leadership abilities, and the highest personal integrity.\n\n“I am so honored to have been awarded the IMA’s MEF scholarship,” said Gallager. “Being a part of the IMA student chapter is one of my proudest accomplishments, and it is an honor to be recognized for such involvement.

I am incredibly honored to be part of this team of student leaders.”\n\nThe University’s IMA student chapter formed in 2017.\n\nThe IMA’s Endorsement of Higher Education initiative recognizes programs that meet rigorous educational standards, enabling students to pursue and earn the CMA credential. The University’s undergraduate accounting program was endorsed by the IMA in 2017.\n\nNathaniel Frissell, Ph.D., assistant professor in The University of Scranton’s Physics and Engineering Department, was awarded a $481,260 grant through the NASA’s Space Weather Applications Operations 2 Research Program. He will serve as the principal investigator for the research project entitled, “Enabling Space Weather Research with Global Scale Amateur Radio Datasets,” with collaborators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory and The University of Alabama.\n\nAccording to Dr. Frissell, the grant will fund “the development of an empirical model for the prediction of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) in high frequency radio communications while investigating the geophysical drivers of these disturbances.” The grant funds will be disbursed over a two-year period.\n\n“This grant includes significant funding for participation of Scranton undergraduate students in this research, as well as support for new computation resources,” said Dr. Frissell.\n\nDr. Frissell explained that the predictive, empirical TID models the research project will develop will use data collected by automated, Global-scale radio communication observation networks that are voluntarily operated by the amateur radio community. Undergraduate students will help the faculty researchers create algorithms used for the model development. This new NASA award complements the five-year, $616,054 NSF CAREER grant Dr. Frissell received in 2020, which aims to understand the source of the TIDs observed in both the amateur radio data and other scientific datasets.\n\nIn 2019, Dr. Frissell received a $1.3 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to fund a three-year initiative to measure modulations produced in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The grant supports a collaborative team to develop a modular, multi-instrument, ground-based space science observation platform known as the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station that will be used to study variability in the coupled geospace system and better understand high frequency radio propagation.\n\nThis is the second research project for which Dr. Frissell has received funding from NASA. A space physicist, Dr. Frissell is among the researchers working on a NASA Living With a Star project entitled, “Wave-Driven Asymmetries in the Ionosphere-Thermosphere due to Asymmetries in the Northern and Southern Polar Vortices.” That project is being led by Richard Collins, Ph.D., principal investigator, of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute.\n\nDr. Frissell joined the faculty at Scranton in the fall of 2019. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Montclair State University and his master’s degree and Ph.D. from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He is the founder and lead organizer of the international citizen science space physics research collective known as the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI.org). Dr. Frissell also serves as advisor to the student W3USR University of Scranton Amateur Radio Club.\n\nThe University ran two summer camps for high school students: physics and cybercrime investigation. Read about them, here.\n\nUNIVERSITY HOLDS CYBERCRIME INVESTIGATION CAMP\n\nNineteen high school students received hands-on training in investigating and thwarting cybercrimes from experts in the much-in-demand field of cyber security at The University of Scranton’s first Cybercrime Investigation Summer Camp. Run by faculty of the Department of Sociology, Criminal Justice and Criminology, the camp took place July 13-15 in the University’s Center for the Analysis and Prevention of Crime on campus.\n\nThrough lectures, exercises, case discussions, the University’s data center tour, computer simulations and a capture-the-flag competition, the students learned about cyber threats, cybercriminal profiling, cyber law, cyber security and how to conduct a cyber forensics investigation. They also learned about the various roles and responsibilities assumed by professionals working in the growing field.\n\nThe job outlook for cybersecurity analysts is predicted to increase by 31 percent for the period between 2019 and 2029, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The annual median salary for cybersecurity analysts in 2020 was $103,900. The University offers a major in cybercrime and homeland security.\n\nThe camp was offered free of charge to participants through support from the University’s College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Office and the Department of Sociology, Criminal Justice and Criminology.\n\nRead on, here.\n\nUNIVERSITY HOLDS PHYSICS SUMMER CAMP\n\nHigh school students were introduced to the extraordinary world of physics at a summer camp hosted at The University of Scranton. The three-day camp for 9th and 10th grade high school students, taught by University physics faculty members, included mini-lectures and hands-on activities to introduce basic physics concepts of electricity and magnetism, as well as dramatic real-life examples of these principals in action.\n\nAt the camp, which took place July 19-21, 12 high school students learned about types of waves, oscilloscopes, magnetic coils, loudspeakers and software defined radio. They built a generator, a motor, and learned to use cutting edge Software Defined Radios (SDR). They installed and got to keep an actual SDR to use at home.\n\nThe students were also introduced to an array of much-in-demand careers available to physicists, or “supercharged engineers,” as the profession is described by Declan Mulhall, Ph.D., professor of physics and engineering at Scranton.\n\n“Physicists have a depth of knowledge and training to give them a broad understanding of a subject and are able to apply their training to find solutions to complex problems and issues,” said Dr. Mulhall, who was among the faculty members leading the camp. “People always have to learn new technology to enter the workforce because of technological advances. Physics – and to some extent engineers – are the source of those advances, and we are training future physicists.”\n\nRead on, here.\n\nTwo of the top student-athletes at The University of Scranton were honored once again for their accomplishments both in their respective fields of play and in the classroom on Wednesday, as graduates Lauren Byrne (Cranford, N.J./Cranford) of the women's swimming & diving team and Tarquin McGurrin (Clarks Summit, Pa./Scranton Prep) of the men's tennis team were named to the 2021 College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) Academic All-America® Division III At-Large Team.\n\nByrne, who was named to the Women's At-Large Academic All-America® Second Team, and McGurrin, who earned a spot on the Men's At-Large Academic All-America® Third Team, are the 43rd and 44th Academic All-American selections in University of Scranton history.\n\nByrne is the first women's swimmer to earn the honor since Sarah Gazdalski (2000, 2001) and is just the second student-athlete in the history of the program to earn the accolade. McGurrin, meanwhile, joins his older brother Tim McGurrin (2012, 2013) and Clay Yeager (1994, 1995, 1996) as the only Academic All-American selections in men's tennis program history at Scranton.\n\nFor Byrne, the selection to the Academic All-American team adds to a long list of accomplishments in her career at Scranton, which includes two CoSIDA Academic All-District First Team selections in 2019 and 2021.\n\nA 16-time Landmark Conference champion at four Landmark Championship meets, Byrne was named the Landmark Female Swimmer of the Year twice (2019 & 2021), while also earning the Landmark's Rookie of the Year accolades in 2018. In 2020, Byrne qualified for the NCAA Division III Championships in the 200-IM, going on to earn All-American accolades in the event to become just the third swimmer in program history to accomplish that feat. In all, she holds nine school records (five in individual events), three overall Landmark Conference records, and four Landmark Conference Championships records, as well.\n\nThe Department of Athletics' 2020-21 female Carlesimo Award winner honoring a senior student-athlete for outstanding academic and athletic achievement, Byrne was the Landmark Conference's Senior Scholar Athlete for women's swimming & diving in 2021. She earned her Bachelor's Degree in Exercise Science in 2020 and is a current Doctor of Physical Therapy graduate student, where she has notched a 3.9 GPA in her academic career.\n\nMcGurrin was a CoSIDA Academic All-District First Team selection in each of the last two years and academically posted a perfect 4.0 GPA both in his undergraduate and graduate career. He earned his Bachelor's Degree in Accounting in 2020 and recently earned his Masters in Business Administration (with an accounting specialization) from Scranton this past May.\n\nThe 2021 Landmark Conference's Senior Scholar Athlete for men's tennis, McGurrin was the 2021 Landmark Player of the Year and a three-time All-Landmark First Team selection in both singles and doubles play. The Clarks Summit native finished his career at Scranton ranked in the top-10 all-time in program history in both singles wins (38) and doubles wins (34).\n\nFor the full 2021 CoSIDA Academic All-America® Division III At-Large Teams, click here.\n\nDuring the uncertainty and physical distancing of the 2020-21 academic year, The University of Scranton’s Community-Based Learning (CBL) projects offered opportunities for students to connect with the city of Scranton and our community members in new ways.\n\nMarketing Students Memorialize Stories of Hospice Patients and Families\n\nIn fall 2020, students in associate professor of marketing Satya P. Chattopadhyay’s First Year Seminar courses engaged in a community-based learning project partnering with Compassionate Care Hospice to capture the life stories of patients to create biographies for their families and caregivers. For the project, Chattopadhyay’s students were trained as Hospice volunteers and met virtually via Zoom with Cassie Kobeski, volunteer coordinator for Compassionate Care Hospice, and then worked together in small groups with the caregivers and families of the Hospice patients to listen and learn about their patients to create biographies. These biographies captured the life stories of patients and provided a keepsake for families to memorialize the lives of their loved ones.\n\nDuring this project, Chattopadhyay’s students conducted virtual interviews with family members and caregivers over Zoom and on the phone. These interviews impacted both the families and caregivers, along with University students. Caregiver Jessica Homschek connected with marketing students Allison Buckman from Shrewsbury, New Jersey; Karina Roettger from Brick, New Jersey; and Aidan Bohn from Scranton to share the life and story of her father Salvatore Falvo.\n\n“It was a pleasure working with the students. I told them to cherish life and hold on to memories because [life] is short and can change in a moment with no warning and you never know what’s in store for you,” said Homschek.\n\nIn addition to providing perspective and important life lessons, this project also helped students, patients, and caregivers alike to find new connections with people that they may have otherwise never encountered.\n\n“In this challenging time when all of us must work harder to stay connected and present, this biography program has connected individuals whose paths may have never crossed. In addition, our hospice staff looks forward to each new patient’s story shared. When a patient begins our hospice services, we may not always get to know the full breadth of their life experience. The biography program has been a shining light, highlighting the personality and memories sometimes shrouded by the immediate concern of the illness at hand. I am very grateful to The University of Scranton for helping to give a voice to these stories,” said Cassie Kobeski.\n\nCommunications Course Shares Experiences of Pine Brook Neighborhood\n\nIn another CBL course, students in assistant professor of communications Kimberly Pavlick’s COMM 224: Media Writing course worked with United Neighborhood Centers of NEPA to help support their Pine Brook Neighborhood Revitalization project. This CBL project connected Pavlick’s students with business owners and long-time Pine Brook area residents to create feature stories highlighting the residents’ stories and experiences of Pine Brook. Students curated stories with photos of the Pine Brook residents to help tell the story of this area of Scranton. This project provided students with insights into this area of Scranton right next to downtown that they may have otherwise not encountered. Interviews included the stories of lifelong Pine Brook residents John and Cathy Giumento, Groove Brewing and UNC’s Director of Community Revitalization Christina Manuel.\n\nOccupational Therapy Students Explore Accessibilty in the City\n\nIn addition to these community-building projects, CBL projects from this past academic year included other projects that worked to connect University coursework with Scranton community needs and priorities. Occupational therapy faculty specialist Patricia Wisniewski, MS, OTR/L, CPRP worked with two sections of her OT121: Occupational Performance to identify ways to improve accessibility and walkability from an occupational therapy perspective, in collaboration with both the City of Scranton and the Scranton Public Library. These projects provided actionable insights for the community partners and also gave students a new perspective on what navigating spaces may be like for community members with diverse needs and the importance of resolving health and social disparities in the community.\n\nCommunity-Based Learning a Source of Connection, Learning, and Impact\n\nLooking ahead to what the 2021-22 academic year may bring, Julie Schumacher Cohen, assistant vice president for Community and Government Relations and the Community-Based Learning Board Chair, is hopeful about returning to some pre-pandemic community activities, but confident that regardless of mode, community-based learning will continue to offer special ways for University students to learn about and become a part of the Scranton community.\n\n“This past year truly demonstrated the need for University-community connections and partnerships,\" she said. \"These CBL experiences not only enhanced the coursework for students while helping to meet community-defined needs, but they are also a vehicle for students to truly become a part of our Scranton community.”\n\nTo learn more about Community-Based Learning at The University of Scranton click here.\n\nThe President’s Business Council (PBC) will present President’s Medals to John E.
