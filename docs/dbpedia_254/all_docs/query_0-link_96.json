        "text": "Article content\n\nA prominent Canadian philanthropist launches into a story about his days as an undergraduate at university way back when. He switched majors early on and, in advance of his final year, experienced a moment of acute realization that he was not having nearly enough fun. To beef up the good times, he registered for what he described as a slate of “Joe” courses, otherwise known as bird courses.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nFinance 101: How to fix Canada's broken universities Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nLo and behold, he had the time of his life. But equally memorable was that two of those courses, the history of business and psychology, would prove key to a career that saw the good-time-loving undergraduate become a good-time-loving tycoon who amassed a substantial fortune, millions of which he has donated to universities over the years.\n\nThe point of his story, added the philanthropist who asked not to be named, is that as much as university should be about producing graduates with the survival skills required to make it in the 21st century, there is also something to be said about producing human beings with some knowledge of business history and psychology, as well as an ability to have fun.\n\nHe wouldn’t name names, but he knows one whippersnapper MBA who knows nothing of the Great Depression, the event that scarred the philanthropist’s parents’ generation.\n\n“Can you imagine not knowing about the Great Depression?” he asked rhetorically.\n\nUniversity life often generates fond recollections for graduates, but universities have recently landed on the general public’s radar, put there by some frantic news out of Kingston, Ont., that Queen’s University is in imminent risk of going bust. It turns out, the university is not going anywhere any time soon, but many post-secondary institutions, Queen’s included, have been caught in higher education’s version of a depression.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNo one is going to write a blank cheque anymore\n\nLawyer Mitch Frazer\n\nBeset by tuition freezes, cuts in government funding, inflation, flatlining enrolment and infrastructure repair backlogs — not to mention the federal government’s recent capping on the number of international students, who pay through the nose to attend school here — universities are finding that money has never been tighter. The question, though, is how to fix things, assuming governments don’t do what they often do and start handing over more money.\n\n“I don’t think this is rocket science,” the philanthropist said.\n\nThe path to righting the financial ship is not through austerity measures, he said, but by applying the “simple” metrics of supply and demand on campus. If there are courses students are no longer interested in, cut them. If there are departments that aren’t big draws, say bye-bye and concentrate resources in areas of demand. And, for crying out loud, give the kids some history lessons.\n\nToronto lawyer Mitch Frazer sucked up every lesson he could as a student, including some words of wisdom by his mother Gitta that boiled down to staying out of trouble and working his tail off at school. His father Harold was an electrician and Gitta a homemaker. Neither went to university. Their son’s goal was to be the first male in his family to do so.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTo get there, Frazer delivered newspapers and worked at Canadian Tire, along with other part-time jobs, to sock money away to pay for his studies. He took out student loans. He earned a scholarship. Five university degrees later, one of which is honorary, the 54-year-old is a managing partner at Mintz LLP in Toronto, and among Canada’s foremost pension law experts.\n\nHe also helped spearhead the creation of a law school at Toronto Metropolitan University, and is currently the chancellor of Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, Ont., a bedroom community east of Toronto, whose education faculty has both his name and his wife’s name on it, courtesy of a $3-million gift from the family.\n\n“Everybody wants more money from government, and everybody needs more money from government,” he said. “But if that money isn’t there, then what do you do?”\n\nThe lawyer has some thoughts. Near the top of the list is encouraging universities to do a better job of attracting private donations from individuals and corporations. The key, he said, is to get people excited about donating, especially since there are plenty of other worthy causes.\n\n“No one is going to write a blank cheque anymore,” he said.\n\nWhat he means is: big-dollar gifts are attention grabbing, but there are always strings attached.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFor example, Stephen Smith, the billionaire co-founder of First National Financial LP, didn’t recently hand over $100 million to Queen’s, on top of another $50 million in years prior, and instruct the school to do as it pleased with his money. He respectively earmarked the gifts for the engineering faculty and the business school to foster transformational change. That is, to not be the same old Queen’s, but to be an even better version. (Smith politely declined to share his thoughts on university finances when asked for this article).\n\nFrazer views education as the best means to impact an individual’s financial circumstance within their lifetime. That core belief made the education faculty at Ontario Tech a natural fit for his family’s donation. But what sold him on the idea of handing over $3 million was the school’s intention to focus on digital technologies to address the challenges and opportunities of learning in a wired world.\n\n“People will give money, but they need to be fired up about what they are giving to,” he said.\n\nBetter wooing of the wealthy seems obvious, but some of Frazer’s other ideas cross into the realm of academic heresy, including that universities should quit trying to be all things to all people.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFor example, in helping get a new law school off the ground at TMU, it was evident from the get-go that there was already an old, prestigious law school at the University of Toronto a few blocks northeast of campus. TMU needed to be different, or else what was the point?\n\nThe school’s new program is tailored to access-to-justice issues and technology. It is not another U of T, but it is another option for aspiring lawyers who have a certain focus.\n\n“It would be nice to be all things to all people, but I don’t know if schools can afford to do that anymore,” Frazer said.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt is worth noting that as the largest university in Canada, the U of T can much better afford to be all things to all people than other schools. It has tremendous scale, a $3-billion-plus endowment, 100,000 or so students, a prime downtown location and deep-pocketed supporters, such as the Temerty Foundation, founded by energy entrepreneur Jim Temerty, which gave the medical school $250 million in 2020. Compare that to Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont., which has a $54.4-million endowment.\n\nThe size of the school and endowment, location, the age of the buildings, the expense of the programs offered and the number of alumni in circulation who fundraisers can conceivably hit up for cash all factor into a school’s overall picture of financial health — or vulnerability.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJoining Frazer on the frontlines of potential heresy is Jim Leech. He was in his car somewhere south of Barrie, Ont., and driving north for an afternoon date with his wife Deb. The couple planned to go snowshoeing, but the crisp, January sun folks in Ontario have been aching for was nowhere to be found, replaced instead by grey skies and pouring rain.\n\n“It is raining like a bugger,” observed Leech, the chancellor emeritus at Queen’s.\n\nHe was the chief executive of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan back in his full-blown working days, an outfit that upon his retirement in 2014 had $130 billion in assets, so he knows a thing or two about money and universities. As an army veteran, he also knows about public service.\n\nI am not saying you want schools to become a one-trick pony. But you don’t want to become a 100-trick pony\n\nJim Leech, former chief executive of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan\n\nLeech believes government should step up with more funding for schools, yet he also thinks universities should do some self-reflection, determine what it is they are good at and then perhaps better focus on the areas of strength.\n\nFor example, let’s say School X is renowned for its history department, but it also has an engineering faculty that no one has really heard of. Given finite resources, why not invest in the school’s strength so it becomes a magnet for history nerds and faculty, and don’t sweat the engineering part so much.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNow, imagine a scenario where School Y is a commerce juggernaut and the two institutions cooperate to maximize their respective areas of strength to the benefit of students.\n\n“I am not saying you want schools to become a one-trick pony,” Leech said. “But you don’t want to become a 100-trick pony.”\n\nThe former pension fund head sees our universities as a national strength, and he fondly recalls his days at Queen’s and meeting students there. During his post-secondary prime — and Leech has an MBA from the school — newly minted business school grads would most likely express a desire to conquer the world by getting a job at General Motors Co. or at a bank.\n\nKids these days are different, he said, and they possess an “unbridled enthusiasm mixed with a healthy degree of naiveté, which is combustible.” Some may still want to work at a bank, but many more would rather bang ideas off him and discuss how their close-knit group of buddies have a plan to create this or that, start a company and make it big.\n\n“The level of entrepreneurship coming out of the schools is incredible,” Leech said. “I am optimistic.”\n\nThere is hope, assuming the universities don’t go bust first. On that apocalyptic note, the unnamed philanthropist has a healthy skepticism for the universities’ tale of financial pain and suffering.\n\nYou do not need to have taken a course on the history of business to understand Queen’s endowment hit $1.5 billion in 2023 from about $400 million in 2003, including a 12.9 per cent return on investment over the final three months of the year.\n\n“That is money in the bank,” the philanthropist said. “They are not going broke.”\n\n• Email: joconnor@postmedia.com\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the business news you need to know — add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
