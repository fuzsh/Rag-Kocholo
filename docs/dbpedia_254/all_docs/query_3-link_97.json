To help create a resource for this work,his dissertation provides geographic and socioeconomic overviews of both regions and includes a discussion of key events in both regions that demonstrate that the histories of colonization in Éire and Mi'kma'ki are interwoven (while also exploring the role of the Irish in colonization).\n\nRead more on scholar's research:\n\nBuilding the capacity for accountable Irish-Mi'kmaq relationships through research\n\nMES 2015\n\nArtist and Executive Director of the Whippersnapper Gallery\n\nAnique Jordan’s vision and voice is making a remarkable impact in Toronto’s art community very early in her art career. Interested in alternative systems of survival, she started her MES with the intent of continuing her work in entrepreneurship and Community Economic Development with Black communities as an urban planner. Calling her time in FES transformative, she has emerged with her goal intact but with an unanticipated creative and cultural tool set to do the work. A first generation Canadian, Jordan is intensely aware of the multitude of sacrifices her Trinidadian mother made to build a life in Canada. As a result, her academic path was focused on having a traditional career.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nPhD 2023\n\nInclusive Disaster Risk Management Consultant, The World BankThe World Bank\n\nBalikisu Osman is a Vanier scholar and an international doctoral student in Environmental Studies at EUC.

This program encouraged Britt to combine her passion for the arts with her commitment to environmental and social change and inspired Britt to use her skills as an artist to help build more sustainable and connected communities. After graduating with a BFA in 2009, Britt decided to continue this learning by completing the Master in Environmental Studies. What excited her most about this program was the ability to create a self-directed plan of study that synthesized my interdisciplinary interests in the arts, environment, and education.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 1987\n\nPresident, Ivey Foundation\n\nAs a student in York Professor Peter Victor’s ecological economics class, Lourie learned that the economy isn’t just a thing on its own,. The economy is a construction of society, which in turn is bounded by our environment. That’s a concept that’s still not well understood and sustainability needs to be reframed in that way. In the years since he was a York student, Lourie has applied the cutting edge and provocative thinking he learned in Victor’s class to change the way Canadians view climate change. He is the co-author of the international bestseller Slow Death by Rubber Duck and its follow-up Toxin Toxout, which tackle head-on the wide array of harmful chemicals found in everyday products and offer solutions around what can be done about it.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 2000\n\nExecutive Director, TD Friends of the Environment Foundation\n\nThe MES program really gave me the flexibility to create a program of study that filled the gaps in my experience and built the foundation for my career. Coming out of a BSc in Biology, I had a strong background in conservation science, but knew that I needed to know a lot more about planning, economics and social psychology to be able to successfully work with on-the-ground projects. The program provided the space to do that and really set me up to get involved in community work. And of course, I graduated with a ready-made network having spent 2 years getting to know others aiming to work in similar fields.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nPhD 2015\n\nInstructor, Centennial College School of Media, Art, & Design\n\nSince completing her doctorate, Edie Steiner has presented her research and media at conferences including How Class Works at the Centre for Study of Working Class Life, SUNY Stony Brook, 2016, and at Rust/Recovery: Works of Resistance, the 2017 conference of the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment (ASLE), Wayne State University, Detroit. In 2016, she served as mentor on documentary film workshops, Docs North, supported by Lakehead University. Dr. Steiner had published book reviews and media in The Goose, the official publication of ALECC (Association for Literature, Environment, and Culture in Canada), and contributed a chapter, “Requiem for Landscape” in Working on Earth: Class and Environmental Justice (University of Nevada Press, 2015).\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nPhD 1995\n\nProfessor, University of Pennsylvania\n\nI am currently Professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Social Policy and Practice. I specialize in the economics of the Nonprofit Sector, which includes philanthropy and volunteering.

I have since leaving FES, published over 80 peer-reviewed papers and edited or written five books, including a children's book Sandy's Incredible Shrinking footprint about the ecological footprint, first learned about at EUC!\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 2017\n\nPrincipal Consultant, HY Mire Consulting\n\nMy experience in MES program prepared me to strategically and effectively navigate institutions. From learning how to secure funding and scholarships, to understanding labour movements and unions, working with professors and meeting course requirements—these were additional skills I learned outside that classroom while obtaining my degree. Now more than ever in the work I do I'm able to apply these skills in order to navigate institutions and organize effectively to make positive change. During my time in the program, I took advantage of the opportunity to take courses at other institutions, such as Ryerson and University of Toronto. This allowed me to work and study with visiting scholars in York and in Toronto, who were instrumental for my research and work in the program but also in the community.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 2021\n\nJc Elijah (Eli) M. Bawuah graduated with a MES degree and identifies as an Afro-Asian queer urban planner whose work explores the intersections of socio-spatial dynamics, policy, and equity.

As a Research Associate, she has been involved in a community-driven project, funded by CIHR, with Eabametoong First Nation in northern Ontario. The program aimed to contribute toward improving community health and well-being through initiatives prioritized by Chief and Council. Recently, Trent's School for Indigenous Studies asked her to join a new project with First Nations University of Canada, which is launching a National Centre for Collaboration in Indigenous Education (NCCIE). As Project Director, she is recruiting Regional Leads across the country who, in turn, hire student and youth researchers to gather stories in urban, rural and remote communities, profiling exemplars of excellence in Indigenous education. These profiles are digitally recorded and will be shared on a website for educators to learn about effective educational programs for all ages and all peoples on Indigenous topics, strengthening education to close the gap and for reconciliation. Most recently, she has been hired by the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy as a Senior Research Associate. She looks forward to continuing the work of the NCCIE as well as contributing to JSGS initiatives.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 1999\n\nFormer Chief Planner and Executive Director of the City of Toronto\n\nAs Chief Planner and Executive Director of the City of Toronto, Jennifer Keesmaat (MES ’99) has changed the local dialogue on planning and urban design from frustrations and complaints about planning into an energized conversation full of hope and optimism for North America’s fifth largest city. Her dedication, energy and visionary approach has put place-making on the map for many Torontonians and helped steer Toronto towards becoming a place where all can flourish. A vocal proponent of walkable, livable cities, she was in high demand as a speaker even before her City Hall days, chairing an annual summit on revitalizing downtowns and holding roundtables on planning practices with students.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nPhD 2008\n\nAssociate Professor, University of Manitoba\n\nJocelyn Thorpe is an associate professor in women's and gender studies and history at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. Her research draws from critical race, feminist, and environmental studies scholarship to examine the history and legacies of, as well as challenges to, colonialism in the Canadian context. She seeks to understand how past discourses and relationships of power lead to and naturalize present-day social and environmental inequities, and to open up possibilities for more just relationships among humans and between humans and the non-human world in which we live.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 2001\n\nDirector of the Environment, Chiefs of Ontario\n\nChiefs of Ontario’s Director of the Environment Kathleen Padulo (MES ‘01) is propelled by her passion for environmental issues and fueled by a sense of responsibility to fight the injustice of environmental racism against First Nations. As part of the first generation who wasn’t stolen from her family and forced into the residential school system, she feels her education was a great privilege that has helped her find a niche where her work can make a lasting impact. Communication is at the heart of her role with the Chiefs of Ontario. Padulo is tireless in her efforts to keep the Chiefs of Ontario’s 133 First Nations communities informed of the Government’s environmental policies that would impact their treaty rights, of funding opportunities, and of forums where their voices can be heard.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nPhD 2004\n\nDirector, Food and Agriculture Institute; Canada Research Chair, Food Security and Environment\n\nLenore Newman is the director of the Food and Agriculture Institute at the University of the Fraser Valley where she holds a research chair in food and agriculture innovation.

The MES program at EUC prepared me for my career by emphasizing the importance and effectiveness of cultivating creativity, embracing multi-disciplinary perspectives, and applying systems thinking to tackle complex challenges. In addition to the Masters in Environmental Studies, I simultaneously earned Graduate Diplomas in Business and the Environment and Environmental and Sustainability Education. I enjoyed transitioning between the distinct learning environments fostered by EUC, the Schulich School of Business and the Faculty of Education. I appreciate and remember fondly my peers and professors examining topical challenges from interdisciplinary perspectives.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 2008\n\nContract Faculty Professor, School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, George Brown College\n\nI grew up in the lakes and forests of the Simcoes and the Muskokas, and always felt a push to work in service of that which provided me so much adventure and refuge. I was drawn to study the environment at EUC because of the long history and strong reputation, the faculty and their work, and the openness and ability to conduct interdisciplinary work as a graduate student. I began and developed a deep love for teaching as a Teaching Assistant while being enrolled as student in the Master in Environmental Studies (MES) program at EUC. It was during my years working on Global Environmental Politics (ENVS 3340), Global Justice and International Humanitarianism (ENVS 4312) and Environmental Law (ENVS 3420) that my teaching practice was born. In support of that practice, it was also during this time that I volunteered with Planet in Focus (PIF), an environmental film festival which has its roots in EUC, and which has been instrumental to my work.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nPark Perceptions and Racialized Realities: A photovoice exploration of experiences in greenspaces\n\nThe Park Perceptions and Racialized Realities project explores the experiences of racialized residents in public urban greenspaces in two Toronto neighborhoods.

I had the opportunity to get involved in many different aspects of student life. I became involved with the student union, York Federation of Students, and was the Environmental Studies Director for 3 years. I volunteered my time as a Peer Mentor for incoming EUC students that may have wanted additional support adjusting to student life. I also got a part time job on campus working at The Underground, this experience allowed me to really get to know the university from a different perspective. From my experience, the MES program prepared me for my career journey in energy management. In the program, I had the freedom to develop my own path for my master’s journey. This may not be good for everyone, but for me it was helpful, as it allowed me to explore my own areas of interest. The MES program provides students the opportunity to take classes outside EUC and this allowed me the opportunity to complete the joint diploma program with the Schulich School of Business in Business and Sustainability This was a very valuable diploma and learning opportunity that provided skills to me that I was lacking.\n\nLearn more about our scholar\n\nMES 2022\n\nSince graduating from Glendon with a BA in Multidisciplinary Studies, Arsenault has pursued her environmental passion in creating a better world for future generations.
