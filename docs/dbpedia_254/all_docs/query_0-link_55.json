        "text": "(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 5/91)\n\nFifty years ago, William C. Friday, class president, stood at the podium and addressed his fellow graduates of North Carolina State College’s Class of 1941. He urged them to “keep State College constantly in your mind. . . You and I are going to be held responsible in a great measure for the growth and progress of the institution.”\n\nWilliam Friday went a step further, however, and for the following 50 years has been an outstanding advocate not only for his alma mater, but for The University of North Carolina, and for American higher education.\n\nWhile still a student, William Friday began turning heads. One journalist wrote prophetically in 1941, “This man Friday is a big operator. He hobnobs with North Carolina’s main-line politicians and gives every indication of being a coming member of that select coterie….He thinks nothing of running up to the Governor’s office for a chat….In recent weeks, with appropriations in mind, he has been buttonholing legislators to extoll State College and point to its needs. None close their minds to this friendly, frank-faced boy from Gaston.”\n\nIt surprised few that by his 15th class reunion, Friday had been named president of the Consolidated University of North Carolina. At 36 years old in 1956, he was one of the youngest university presidents, and certainly was one of few who had ascended to such academic heights without previous top administrative experience, or an advanced academic degree, or any classroom teaching experience.\n\nThirty years later, when he retired as president of The University of North Carolina system in 1986, he had left a legacy of national admiration for the state’s system of higher education. He had achieved that legacy not by heavy-handed autocracy, but by encouraging quiet cooperation and communication among his administrators.\n\nFriday spent his boyhood in Dallas, N. C., where he was a debater, played baseball and wrote sports news for the Gastonia Gazette. He was president of his class each year in high school.\n\nHe entered Wake Forest College for one year and then transferred to North Carolina State College. At State he earned numerous awards, was sports editor of the Technician and president of the senior class. He earned a bachelor’s degree in textile engineering with honors.\n\nAfter service as an ensign in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he entered law school at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he earned a degree in 1948. Shortly after, he married Ida Willa Howell of Lumberton.\n\nFriday served as an assistant to Gordon Gray, president of the University of North Carolina, from 1951 to 1955. In 1956 he began his career as president–a career marked by smooth administrative leadership despite inevitable conflicts and controversies brought on by the system’s growing pains.\n\nDuring his tenure, the system grew from three institutions to 16, its annual budget rose from $40.7 million to $1.5 billion, and enrollment climbed from 14,971 to 125,000 students.\n\nMeanwhile, Friday guided American higher education as well, serving as chairman of numerous national panels including the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, the American Council on Education, President Johnson’s Task Force on Education, President Carter’s Task Force on Education, the American Council on Education and the Knight Foundation National Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics.\n\nIn 1985 he received the American Council on Education’s National Distinguished Service Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the following year was rated the most effective public university president in the nation by the Council of Advancement and Support of Education.\n\nThrough the years, Friday maintained first-hand contact with the people of North Carolina and hosted the television program “North Carolina People” for 19 years.\n\nFriday continues his active role in academia as University Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 5/94)\n\nJohn Hope Franklin is a renowned educator, historian and author who is the James B. Duke Professor of History Emeritus at Duke University.\n\nDr. Franklin is a native of Oklahoma and a graduate of Fisk University.

Prior to that time he served as professor of history at several universities, including St. Augustine’s College, North Carolina College at Durham (now N. C. Central University), Howard University and Brooklyn College.\n\nHe was chairman of the History Department at the University of Chicago (1967-1970) and was named John Matthew Manly Distinguished Service Professor (1969-1982). Dr. Franklin also has served as professor at Cambridge University, England, and as visiting professor at Australian and New Zealand universities, Harvard University, the University of Wisconsin, Cornell University, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Hawaii.\n\nHe has written a number of books including “The Emancipation Proclamation,” “The Militant South,” “The Free Negro in North Carolina,” “Reconstruction After the Civil War,” and “A Southern Odyssey: Travelers in the Antebellum North.”\n\nPerhaps his best known books is “From Slavery to Freedom: A History of Negro Americans.”\n\nHis most recent book is a collection of essays covering a teaching and writing career of 50 years. “Race and History: Selected Essays, 1938-1988″ was published early in 1990.\n\nDr. Franklin has served on many national commissions and delegations, including the National Council on the Humanities, from which he resigned in 1979 when he was appointed to the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy. He also served on the President’s Advisory Commission on Ambassadorial Appointments.\n\nHe received the Council for the Jefferson Medal for 1984 presented by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education, and was the first recipient of the Cleanth Brooks Medal by the Fellowship of Southern Writers in 1989. In 1990 he received the Encyclopedia Brittannica Gold Medal for the Dissemination of Knowledge.\n\n(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 5/95)\n\nDr. William Brantley Aycock, chancellor emeritus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is a Johnston County native who earned a bachelor’s degree in education from North Carolina State University in 1936 and a master’s degree in history from UNC-Chapel Hill the following year.\n\nHis career was interrupted by World War II and service in the U.S. Army. Aycock received a Bronze Star, Silver Star and the Legion of Merit for action in the European Theater of Operations as battalion commander in the 87th Infantry Division. Later he served as a Reserve officer in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps.\n\nAfter the war, he resumed his education in law school at UNC-Chapel Hill, and joined the law faculty in 1948 a semester before graduating first in his class. He was named acting dean of the School of Law in 1956.\n\nAs chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill from 1957 to 1964, Aycock led the university through a period of rapid growth. Following his term as chancellor, he resumed teaching in the law school; was named Kenan Professor of Law in 1966; was a five-time winner of the McCall Teaching Award; and was the first faculty member to be named to the UNC-Chapel Hill General Alumni Association board of directors. He retired as a full-time faculty member in 1985, but continued to teach and publish.\n\nOver the years, Aycock earned a reputation for his personal and professional stand on issues such as disadvantaged youth and the rights of women. He co-authored “The Military Law Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice” with Seymour Wurfel in 1955.\n\nAycock also played a role in international affairs as personal assistant to Frank Porter Graham, the United Nations representative during critical peacemaking negotiations in 1951 between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.\n\nHis achievements have earned him numerous awards including the Thomas Jefferson Award; the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the UNC-Chapel Hill Law Alumni Association; the William Richardson Davie Award from the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees; the Liberty Bell Award from the N.C. Bar Association; the Distinguished Service Medal from the UNC-Chapel Hill General Alumni Association; and the University Award from The University of North Carolina Board of Governors.\n\n(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 5/95)\n\nRetired Army General Maxwell R. Thurman is a High Point native who earned a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from North Carolina State University in 1953.\n\nAfter a distinguished military career that spanned 38 years, Thurman retired from the Army in 1991. One of the few non-West Point graduates to reach the four-star rank, Thurman was a principal architect of the all-volunteer Army. He played a major role in reshaping the Army’s image and recruitment success with the advertising campaign, “Be All That You Can Be–In the Army.”\n\nHe probably will be best remembered, however, as commander of “Operation Just Cause,” the invasion of Panama in 1989. As head of the U.S. Southern Command, Thurman orchestrated what was at the time the largest U.S. Military maneuver since the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring his career, Thurman held a variety of command and staff positions both overseas and in the United States. He commanded light artillery and rocket units and served as an intelligence officer in Europe, served in the Middle East during the 1958 Lebanon crisis, and twice served in Vietnam.\n\nThurman commanded the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery, and from 1979 to 1981 was commander of the Army Recruiting Command. He was appointed vice chief of staff in 1983 and served as the Joint Chief of Staff in the absence of the chief of staff. In 1987 he assumed command of the Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Va. He is credited with molding the Army’s “Air-Land” battle doctrine to capitalize on the sophisticated weapon systems and highly trained soldiers.\n\nIn 1991, Thurman was named executive-in-residence in what was then the NCSU Division of Economics and Business, now the NCSU College of Management. In that position, he helped design and participate in outreach programs to the local business community.\n\n(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 12/95)\n\nRaymond H. Dawson has been an integral part of the University of North Carolina for nearly four decades.\n\nFor 20 of those years, Dawson served as vice president for academic affairs and senior vice president of the 16-campus system. Upon his retirement in 1992, he continued as a member of the political science faculty at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.\n\nA native of Arkansas, Dawson earned his bachelor’s degree at the College of the Ozarks and his master’s degree at Vanderbilt University. He completed his doctorate in political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and joined the faculty there in 1958. He was named dean of the university’s College of Arts and Sciences and General College in 1968.\n\nWhen the state’s public universities were restructured in 1972, Dawson left the Chapel Hill campus to become the top academic officer in the General Administration of the newly formed UNC system.\n\nThe author of two books and numerous scholarly articles, Dawson earned distinction for his achievements in teaching. He received UNC-Chapel Hill’s Tanner Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching and the Danforth Foundation’s E. Harris Harbison Prize for Distinguished Teaching.\n\nIn 1987, the UNC-Chapel Hill General Alumni Association honored him with its Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nDuring Dawson’s tenure with General Administration, he guided the university system’s academic programs, advised two presidents of UNC, and helped defend the UNC programs before the N.C. General Assembly. During his tenure, UNC’s enrollment rose from 88,000 to 147,000, system-wide minimum admissions requirements were adopted, and academic standards were raised on many campuses.\n\nHe also was the key negotiator in the system’s 10-year conflict over desegregation methods with the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and was the principal architect of the 1981 consent decree that led to a resolution of the crisis.\n\n(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 12/95)\n\nBurley B.

She was one of only five women nationwide to graduate with a degree in engineering that year.\n\nA barrier -breaker from an early age, Stinson always knew she wanted to fly airplanes. In 1932, at the age of 15, she met her idol, Amelia Earhart, who encouraged the lanky Wake County teenager to follow her dream but also warned her that just being a pilot wouldn’t be enough to make a decent living. Stinson’s best bet for success, Earhart said, was to go to college and major in aeronautical engineering. Adhering to that advice, Stinson applied for admission to NC State but was told the university did not accept women as freshmen. Undaunted, she enrolled at nearby Meredith College, completed 48 credit hours in one year, and successfully enrolled at NC State the following autumn.\n\nHer pioneering ways continued after graduation, when she became the first female engineer hired by the Civil Aeronautics Administration, now the Federal Aviation Administration. In 1953, she helped found the Society of Women Engineers. During her 32 years working for the FAA, she was responsible for many engineering firsts, including successfully converting light airplanes into gliders for pilot training during World War II and reconverting the trainers back to engined airplanes after the war.\n\nStinson has received numerous awards for her contributions to aerospace engineering, including the FAA Sustained Superior Performance Award; the Distinguished Women in the Aerospace Industry Award; and the Aviation Pioneer of the Year Award from the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. She was the first woman to serve on the board of directors of the NC State Alumni Association.

Luckily for the world of art, things worked out a little differently for the 17-year-old boy from Gastonia, North Carolina.\n\nToday, Biggers is one of our country’s most accomplished artists. His paintings and drawings hang in museums and private collections nationwide, and his murals — including two at Winston-Salem State University, and one in the North Carolina Legislative Building on which he advised his nephew, James Biggers — are widely considered to be the finest painted by any artist of his generation. Throughout his long and productive career, Biggers has created works that draw upon the experiences of African-Americans in the rural South to illustrate and celebrate the richness of diversity and the commonality of all human experience. He has said, “I’m not a big-city artist telling a big-city story; I’m a southern man telling a story about home.”\n\nBiggers was born in Gastonia on April 13, 1924, the seventh and youngest child of Paul and Cora Biggers. Overcoming poverty, racism and personal tragedy — his father died in 1937 when he was just 13 — Biggers persevered, and enrolled at Hampton Institute in 1941. There, despite his initial goal of becoming a plumber, he was drawn to art and began to develop his own personal style, a bold synthesis of African and African-American folk cultures with western modernism. One of his earliest and most famous murals, Dying Soldier, was exhibited in a show, “Young Negro Art,” in 1943 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nFollowing two years of service in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Biggers returned to college and earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in art education from Pennsylvania State University in 1948. Biggers spent the next 34 years of his life as a professor of art at Texas Southern University in Houston, where he directed a program that has produced many of America’s most prominent black artists, art historians and teachers.\n\nBiggers retired from his teaching post at Texas Southern in 1983, but continues to serve the university as Professor Emeritus, and to paint and inspire new generations of artists. He and his wife of nearly 51 years, Hazel Hales Biggers, live in Gastonia and in Houston, Texas.\n\n(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 5/00)\n\nDonna E.

He served as Fellow of Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge from 1992 to 2003. Badger previously taught at Newcastle University for 20 years. He was educated at Cambridge, North Carolina State and Hull universities.\n\nBadger has written extensively about the New Deal and the post-1945 American South. His first two books had a North Carolina focus: Prosperity Road: The New Deal, Tobacco, and North Carolina and North Carolina and the New Deal. He subsequently wrote The New Deal: The Depression Years and New Deal/New South: The Anthony J Badger Reader. In 1997, he gave the Harrelson Lecture at North Carolina State. He has served as an editor for several books on American political history and the civil rights movement.\n\nHis latest book, FDR: The First Hundred Days, was chosen as then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s book of the year in 2008.

At age 85, he has only recently retired from teaching as a professor of comparative literature at Stanford University. He is professor emeritus of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nIn works such as Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth Century Europe, White has argued that literary and historical writing share a reliance on storytelling form, meaning that no history can be considered completely objective or scientific. However, he also holds that this reliance on the narrative structure allows history to be meaningful. His latest volume, titled The Practical Past, will be released in 2014.\n\nBorn in Tennessee, White grew up in Detroit during the Depression. He earned an undergraduate degree in history from Wayne State University and completed his doctorate at the University of Michigan. He spent two years in Italy in the 1950s on a Fulbright Fellowship completing his dissertation research on medieval church history.\n\nWhite has also taught at Wayne State, the University of Rochester, UCLA and Wesleyan University. He has received grants, fellowships and awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim Foundation and many other prestigious organizations. He held residential fellowships at Cornell, Wesleyan, the Harvard Center for Renaissance Studies in Florence, Stanford, the American Academy in Berlin and the University of Bologna, Italy.\n\nPerhaps his proudest accomplishment is having served as plaintiff in a class-action civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department during the Vietnam era. In 1973 while a history professor at UCLA, White brought suit against the chief of police, alleging covert intelligence gathering tactics that included having officers register as students, take notes on anti-Vietnam class discussions and make police reports based on the discussions. The California Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in White’s favor in 1975. The case, White versus Davis, established limits on police surveillance of political activity in California, barring it in the absence of reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\nWhite’s teaching philosophy holds that the aim of education should be to help young people think their own thoughts and speak in their own voices, rather than fit themselves into pre- established patterns of behavior and belief prescribed by society, the business world or the legal establishment. He is married to Margaret Brose, professor emerita of literature at the University of California at Santa Cru\n\nHonorary Doctor of Humane Letters\n\nMr. David S.
