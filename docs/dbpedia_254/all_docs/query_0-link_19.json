Our reliance on digital technologies to support work and leisure has grown accordingly, thereby reshaping human endeavors as well as work practices and beyond.\n\nFor this track, we are interested in research examining how digital technologies can be used to help individuals, organizations, societies, and nations build resilience to enhance agility, continuity, and sustainability. Not only is there a need to increase pandemic readiness and response for the future, but many global issues such as climate change, disinformation, digital divide, food and water insecurity, poverty, and the need for global cooperation also warrant attention. Digital technologies, such as Internet of Things, digital twin, robotics, crowdsourcing, and green computing, can be deployed in various forms to help address these issues.\n\nWe are interested in research on the design, development, implementation, deployment, and impact of digital technologies to both help improve human well-being and overcome critical global issues and build digital resilience in many aspects of society. Research that examines critical global issues or emerging trends in IS across any level of analysis is of interest to this track. We are open to all kinds of research approaches and methodologies that address using digital technologies to improve or support human endeavors in the post-pandemic era.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nDigital transformation\n\nDigital resilience\n\nDigital supply chain\n\nHealth monitoring platform\n\nOrganizational adaptation\n\nOrganizational readiness\n\nThe new normal\n\nPost-pandemic recovery\n\nGlobal challenges\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nRadha Appan, Texas Tech University, USA\n\nJörg Becker, Uni Münster, Germany\n\nSiddhartha Bhattacharya, George Mason University, USA\n\nBurcu Bulgurcu, Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada\n\nArturo Castellanos, William & Mary, USA\n\nRobert Davison, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR\n\nJing Gong, University of Virginia, USA\n\nAlexander Maedeche, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany\n\nJiahui Mo, Clemson University, USA\n\nMartin Mocker, Reutlingen University , Germany\n\nRajiv Mukherjee, Texas A&M University, USA\n\nAnnamina Rieder, University of St. Gallen, Switzerland\n\nSharon Tan, National University of Singapore, Singapore\n\nJohn Tripp, Clemson University, USA\n\nChih-Ping Wei, National Taiwan University, Taiwan\n\nDongming Xu, University of Queensland, Australia\n\nJingjun (David) Xu, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR\n\nXingyue (Luna) Zhang, University of Washington, Tacoma, USA\n\nTrack Title: General IS Topics\n\nTrack Chairs\n\nRaghu SANTANAM\n\nArizona State University\n\nraghu.santanam@asu.edu\n\nBio: Raghu Santanam is Professor and McCord Chair of Business in the Information Systems Department at the W.

Traditional employment arrangements are increasingly becoming mobile, flexible and distributed. The accelerated digitalisation of organisations and the effects of the pandemic are rattling the established archetype of office work routines towards more contemporary work arrangements. Exemplars of contemporary approaches to work include remote and nomadic work, the 4-day workweek, globally distributed project work, and freelancing on-demand crowd work brokered through dedicated platforms such as TopCoder, Uber or TaskRabbit.\n\nThe automation and augmentation of work with artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and blockchain are transforming organisations and industries and potentially entire labour markets, with humans being replaced by, or working together with, ever more intelligent algorithms and robots. There is a concern among workers that whole classes of job roles and occupations are at risk of extinction while demand for other job roles in other occupations grows at an increasing rate. Workers will need to adapt their skill portfolios, and careers to remain employable, let alone thrive and prosper. At the same time, the meaning of work and employment is shifting as the new generation of digital natives reconfigure the future of work.\n\nWe welcome submissions that take a broad perspective addressing digital technologies and the future of work. We seek submissions on various theoretical and methodological approaches that examine the phenomenon across levels of analyses, e.g., task, individual, organisational, labour market or societal.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nAutomation and augmentation of work\n\nNew forms of technology-enabled work arrangements\n\nDesign theories for future work environments\n\nWork culture in digital milieus\n\nMobile and nomadic work\n\nVirtual work across boundaries and in the metaverse\n\nPeople analytics and algorithmic management\n\nEmerging and shifting portfolio of skills and professional development\n\nManaging professional obsolescence\n\nMeaning of work in digital workplaces\n\nManagement of work and workers in a digitised work environment\n\nEmerging new careers and patterns of careers\n\nDigitalisation and job mobility\n\nNew practices and forms of leadership in digital workplaces\n\nWork in the context of the fourth industrial revolution\n\nFreelancing and crowd work arrangements and practices\n\nLived experience in the digital workplace and remote working\n\nSelf-organised work in decentralised autonomous organisations\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nMargunn Aanestad, University of Agder, Norway\n\nKaveh Abhari, San Diego State University, USA\n\nJoão Baptista, Lancaster University, UK\n\nJean-Gregoire Bernard, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\n\nGee-Woo Bock, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea\n\nSabine Brunswicker, Purdue University, USA\n\nKathy Chudoba, Utah State University, USA\n\nWendy Currie, Audencia Nantes, France\n\nElizabeth Davidson, University of Hawaii, USA\n\nXuefei (Nancy) Deng, California State University, Dominguez Hills, USA\n\nMalshika Dias, RMIT University, Australia\n\nBrittany Green, University of Louisville, USA\n\nDirk Hovorka, University of Sydney, Australia\n\nKe-Wei Huang, National University of Singapore, Singapore\n\nGhiyoung Im, University of Louisville, USA\n\nTina Blegind Jensen, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark\n\nMatthew Jones, University of Cambridge, UK\n\nStefan Klein, University of Muenster, Germany\n\nDong-Gil Ko, University of Cincinnati, USA\n\nJungwoo Lee, Yonsei University, S.

However, the pervasiveness and emphasis on digitalization, if not approached with social consciousness, may have unintended negative consequences for its societal impact. On the one hand, digital transformation efforts can enable a more sustainable society, such as the rise of smart cities or circular economies. On the other hand, digitalization may be inaccessible to certain communities and may further exclude institutionally marginalized communities and individuals across the globe and also has unexpected influence on human dignity. Furthermore, decision-making systems that leverage aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to introduce biased outcomes. Given the complexity and velocity of digitalization, our understanding of its social impact often lags behind its introduction and widespread use.\n\nThe Information Systems community is in a unique position to uncover and shed light on the effects digitalization and various applications of information technologies have on our society. This track calls for papers that investigate both the intended and unintended societal impacts of information systems. Studies in this track go a long way to inform regulators, practitioners, users, and researchers from other disciplines. This track welcomes innovative, rigorous and relevant theoretical, empirical, and design studies on societal impacts from interactions with and influences of information systems. Empirical (qualitative and quantitative) studies as well as design-oriented research and conceptual/theoretical papers for theory development will be considered. Various dimensions, including social, economic, cultural and ethical aspects, can be involved in these relationships. We encourage submissions at different levels and cross-levels of analysis. The research questions may derive from a broad spectrum of disciplines.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nTheoretical perspectives and/or empirical insights on the intended and unintended social consequences of IS\n\nInnovative technological initiatives to address persistent societal problems\n\nSocietal consequences of digital workplaces, and emerging technologies\n\nSocietal consequences of digital governments including privacy concerns, discrimination and opaqueness of AI-decision making\n\nAlgorithmic biases in social media, search engines, and AI\n\nIS for a greener and more circular society, government, and/or industry\n\nUse of digital technologies to promote sustainable consumption behavior and sustainable solutions\n\nSocial inclusion challenges, issues of (in)equality and marginalized groups, fairness in the use, design, and development of systems/algorithms\n\nMultilayered demographic perspectives on the digital divide and the digitally disadvantaged\n\nSocietal implications of fake news, online disinformation and misinformation campaigns\n\nDark side of technology including addiction, victimization, surveillance, etc.\n\nPhilosophical perspectives on IS implications for society\n\nHuman dignity and information technology\n\nEthical and socially responsible research and innovation in IS\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nVictor Benjamin, Arizona State University, USA\n\nRajesh Chandwani, Indian Institute of Management, India\n\nDaniel Chen, Texas Christian University, USA\n\nVictor Chen, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan\n\nBingjie Deng, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China\n\nAndreas Eckhardt, University of Innsbruck, Austria\n\nDennis Fehrenbacher, University of St.Gallen, Switzerland\n\nZixiu Guo, University of New South Wales, Australia\n\nHsin-Yi Huang, Soochow University, Taiwan\n\nKevin Kuan, University of Sydney, Australia\n\nMayank Kumar, MICA, India\n\nKai R.

The attacks evolve with the development of technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and payment methods. Cloud security breaches caused by poor password security practices in cloud systems are a case in point. The defenders, in response, must secure their systems, which put them at the forefront of dealing with emerging issues presented by new technologies. These new emerging issues include responding to the changing regulatory landscape, advancing organizational best practices, and understanding the behavioral and privacy challenges.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the digital disruption that ensued has only heightened the cybersecurity concerns of organizations. This is because expanding digital infrastructures, such as those needed to facilitate remote work arrangements, create additional attack vectors for cybercriminals and other adversaries. More generally, modern digital innovation and transformation projects bring about increased cybersecurity and privacy risks for users and organizations. For example, companies increasingly face the non-trivial task of striking a balance between executing data analytics initiatives and ensuring sufficient security/privacy protection.\n\nFurther, as the modern economy is increasingly dependent on user-supplied data, privacy concerns remain an important topic on the research and policy agenda. Currently, scientific evidence on the impact of privacy concerns on users’ behavior remains mixed. It is still to be understood what value users attach to their privacy and what it depends on. Moreover, increasing calls for data donation put pressure on researchers to better understand individual decision-making in these highly complex scenarios.\n\nThis track aims to encourage cutting edge research that focuses on topics in cybersecurity and privacy (either jointly or separately). A goal is to facilitate timely debates on the application of theories and methods that broaden and deepen our understanding of the newly emerging phenomena and classical problems in these areas (cybersecurity and privacy).\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nAI for cybersecurity\n\nEconomic aspects of managing cybersecurity and privacy\n\nAdoption, use, and continuance of cybersecurity technologies and policies\n\nEmployee accountability, insider threats, computer abuse, and employee insecure behaviors\n\nCorporate strategies, governance, and compliance in cybersecurity and privacy\n\nCyberwarfare and cybersecurity\n\nIdentify theft and deception in online communication\n\nDesign and development of cybersecurity and privacy enhancing technologies\n\nDigital forensics and investigations of cybercrime and cybersecurity policy violations\n\nHacker culture, white hat and black hat research issues\n\nNeuroscience applications to cybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity risk analysis and management\n\nSocio-technical policies and mechanisms for countering cyber threats\n\nSecurity and privacy concerns with social media\n\nSecurity and privacy metrics\n\nSecurity and privacy of mobile devices\n\nPrivacy concerns and user behavior\n\nPrivacy paradox\n\nThe value of data\n\nUser behavior in the face of privacy threats\n\nOnline self-disclosure\n\nData donation\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nOlga Abramova, University of Potsdam, Germany\n\nLaura Amo, University of Buffalo, USA\n\nYoungsok Bang, Yonsei University, South Korea\n\nKatharina Baum, University of Potsdam, Germany\n\nBenedict Bender, University of Potsdam, Germany\n\nLaura Brandimarte, University of Arizona, USA\n\nJoseph Buckman, Georgia State University, USA\n\nAJ Burns, Lousiana State University, USA\n\nYan Chen, Florida International University, USA\n\nAlexandra Durcikova, University of Oklahoma, USA\n\nJin Gerlach, University of Passau, Germany\n\nJens Grossklags, Technical University of Munich, Germany\n\nTejaswini Herath, Brock University, Canada\n\nCarol Hsu, University of Sydney, Australia\n\nAllen Johnston, University of Alabama, USA\n\nKeehyung Kim, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\nByungwan Koh, Korea University, South Korea\n\nHannes-Vincent Krause, University of Potsdam, Germany\n\nJee-Hae Lim, University of Hawaii, USA\n\nHamid Reza Nikkhah, Bentley University, USA\n\nQian Tang, Singapore Management University, Singapore\n\nSimon Trang, University of Göttingen, Germany\n\nAndre Ullrich, Weizenbaum-Institute, Germany\n\nDawei (David) Wang, Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) , USA\n\nJingguo Wang, University of Texas – Arlington, USA\n\nMerrill Warkentin, Mississippi State University, USA\n\nThomas Widjaja, University of Passau, Germany\n\nLi Xiaofan, National University of Singapore, Singapore\n\nDanxia Xie, Tsinghua University, China\n\nCenying (Tracy) Yang, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\nNan (Andy) Zhang, Harbin Institute of Technology, China\n\nTrack Title: Blockchain, DLT, and Fintech\n\nTrack Chairs\n\nEric T.K.

Dr Sørensen has since 1991, consulted and conducted executive teaching with a range of large international firms and public organisations.\n\nTrack Description\n\nThis track covers topics from Blockchain and distributed ledgers, both in the financial area and in other domains. Furthermore, we invite Fintech papers that are based on other technologies.\n\nBlockchain technology has captured the imagination of businesses and individuals since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. Whereas basic distributed ledger technology (DLT) can enable easy sharing and replication of data, the addition of a consensus protocol facilitates distributed management of digital rights, be it in the form of cryptocurrencies or other kinds of cryptoassets. Network actors maintain update and validate network transactions of tokens, ensuring against double-spending of any given asset. Some blockchain projects represent digital infrastructures onto which digital platforms can support the management of services, smart contracts etc. By design, a blockchain is virtually immutable and resists data modification. Despite originating as the foundational architecture for transferring cryptocurrencies in the likes of Bitcoin, the application of blockchain technology has since progressed beyond its original purpose. Blockchain technology can support a wealth of use-cases, spanning pure cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, a variety of FinTech innovations, and the tokenization of inter-organizational exchanges in consortia to optimize supply chains, logistics, global trade, internet of things, healthcare, energy, etc.\n\nInnovations in technologies and governance arrangements have since the beginning introduced new innovations challenging existing arrangements, for example, algorithmic stablecoins, Central bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), and new architectures beyond blockchains optimizing operations through the application of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). The largely unregulated arrangements in blockchain have also, over the years, led to some negative consequences, as demonstrated by recent developments, and the maturing of the financial application of DLTs is expected to be followed by further regulation.\n\nWith its potential ability to serve as a critical rights-sensitive digital infrastructure for an economy based on web3 and a potential foundational technology for new socio-economic systems. This innovation could, therefore, usher in a new and decentralized paradigm of data governance that will support a decentralized peer-to-peer economy where value and creativity can flow freely without the expensive rent-seeking behavior of traditional intermediaries. This track is particularly interested in blockchain innovations that will manifest in the web3 environment, such as the metaverse, AI-enabled commerce, self-sovereignty-based governance, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nWhile a lot of recent Fintech research has focussed on DLT, we are also interested in research based on other technologies. Advances in AI have allowed gaining more insights into markets and customer behavior. Established and new financial institutions use those algorithms to change trading, manage risks, and develop new forms of client interactions, e.g. conversational agents for customer interaction. At the same time, banks are under pressure to comply with regulations and demonstrate their responsibility for a sustainable future.\n\nWhile we fully recognize the cross-disciplinary nature of DLT and Fintech research, the track will weigh papers contributing to an Information Systems debate on these issues highly over those that mainly contribute to fields beyond IS.\n\nWe welcome research using any established research appproach, e.g. theory development, case studies, experiments, surveys, simulation or design research. While we are open to literature reviews, we would like to see a clear contribution beyond the typical introduction to a research field typically presented in a PhD thesis. Case studies should move beyond description to some theoretical implication and design research should include an evaluation of the artifact.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nFintech innovation: For example, robo-advisory, social trading, social credit scoring, algorithmic trading, mobile payment technologies and business\n\nIssues and opportunities of the transformation from the platform to the token economy: For example, regulatory frameworks, new regulatory challenges with fintech, (de)centralization, commoditization of mining hardware, governance mechanisms, impacts of tokenized invoices\n\nMacroeconomic implications of fintech: disintermediation of established players, the impact of cryptocurrencies, structural changes in the economy\n\nOrganizational and business model transformation driven by fintech: For example, digital transformation of banks, adoption, and innovation with cryptocurrencies, DLT, and blockchain technologies\n\nLeveraging new types of data in the financial market: For example, ethical concerns, data-driven business models, fraud detection, regulation, practical feasibility, smart trading strategies such as artificial intelligence-driven trading practices, data management and governance issues related to blockchain\n\nDesign and architecture of blockchain and distributed ledger technology systems: For example, nature of the multi-layered architecture of blockchain and DLT systems, network effects in blockchain networks\n\nDesign of novel Fintech and DLT applications.\n\nManagement and organization of blockchain, DLT, and cryptocurrencies: For example, asset management with blockchain-based tokenization, distributed and decentralized organization, coordination, and governance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), self-sovereignty-based governance\n\nBlockchain innovations in the web3 environment, such as the metaverse, AI-enabled commerce\n\nBlockchain as a driver of social innovation and world benefit: For example, collective intelligence and collective action in DAOs, increasing financial inclusion, addressing collective action threats through smart contracts, collective value creation through blockchain governance\n\nDesign, implementation use and impact of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and novel token applications.\n\nDLT case studies in finance and outside finance, e.g. art, music, travel or gaming. Case studies should not be purely descriptive, but rather lead to novel theoretical and conceptual insights.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) platformsI\n\nThe darker sides of DLT systems: For example, the concentration of mining operations or blockchain governance.\n\nThe role of blockchain technology in inter-organizational coordination of business interdependencies, for example, in logistics and supply-chain management.\n\nTheoretical understanding of the DLT ecosystem of projects: for example, the current innovation of Layer-1, 3, and 3 projects with roll-ups, etc.\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nAleksi Aaltonen, Temple University, USA\n\nMichael Cahalane, UNSW Sydney, Australia\n\nZhao Cai, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, China\n\nJinwei Cao, University of Delaware, USA\n\nYue Cheng, Nanchang University, China\n\nRaffaele Ciriello , University of Sydney, Australia\n\nGilbert Fridgen, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg\n\nFangfang Hou, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China\n\nNa Jiang, Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International College, China\n\nErol Kazan, Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany\n\nDan Ma, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China\n\nSandeep Mysore, UNSW Sydney, Australia\n\nMairead O’ Connor, UNSW Sydney, Australia\n\nYunfei Shi, UNSW Sydney, Australia\n\nChee-Wee Tan, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark\n\nClaudio Tessone, University of Zurich, Switzerland\n\nNils Urbach, Fraunhofer FIT, Germany\n\nBingqing Xiong, Deakin University, Australia\n\nMarkos Zachariadis, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nLiudmila Zavolokina, University of Zurich, Switzerland\n\nHaiping Zhao, China University of Petroleum, China\n\nTrack Title: Sharing Economy, Platforms, and Crowds\n\nTrack Chairs\n\nAnandasivam Gopal\n\nNanyang Technological University\n\nAnandasivam.gopal@ntu.edu.sg\n\nBio: Anandasivam Gopal is the President’s Chair of Information Systems and Innovation at Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

This track invites cutting-edge research that addresses issues relating to these topics.\n\nThe sharing economy has disrupted conventional socio-economic activities by allowing individuals to exchange underutilized assets or resources for monetary gains at very low transactional costs. Under this broad umbrella, sharing can stem from user-owned assets, as exemplified on Airbnb, Didi, Grab, and Uber, or take place through the renting of company-owned resources, as epitomized on Bird, CitiBike, Lime, and Zipcar.\n\nFueling the explosion of the sharing economy are multi-sided platforms which, by connecting various actors throughout the world for little marginal cost, facilitate interactions and transactions in a seamless fashion across a variety of contexts: dating, entertainment, education, finance, hospitality, housing, product reviews, and transportation, to name a few. These multi-sided platforms have revolutionized industries, for better and for worse, with both promising and disappointing socio-economic impacts being documented.\n\nLikewise, many of these emerging business models would not have been possible without the growing societal transition into distributed modes of innovation and production, e.g., in the context of mobile apps, that leverage the capability of digital platforms and technological infrastructures to orchestrate the coordination of distributed and heterogeneous individuals and organizations toward achieving a wide range of socio-economic objectives.\n\nWe welcome papers that examine questions relating to the above topics from diverse perspectives, which include but are not limited to different theoretical orientations, methodological approaches, and levels of analyses. We encourage work that crosses disciplinary boundaries and provides us with fresh insights on the future of the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nNew theoretical perspectives for understanding the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nNovel methodological approaches for researching the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nExternal vs. internal enterprise deployment of multi-sided platforms for facilitating crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nPlatform-enabled business models underlying the sharing economy, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nDiversity, ethics, and inclusivity in the sharing economy\n\nReputation and trust in the sharing economy and digital platforms\n\nEntrepreneurship in platform-driven, crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nEconomic, ecological, legal, regulatory, geo-political, social, and technological implications of the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowds\n\nSharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production in highly regulated industries, such as health care or education\n\nDigital labor markets\n\nCrowdsourcing and crowdfunding\n\nDeployment of AI on multi-sided platforms for facilitating crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nMonetization of platform-based models\n\nIndividual decision-making in the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based models\n\nDecentralized digital ecosystems\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nCollis Avinash, University of Texas at Austin, USA\n\nSofia Bapna, University of Minnesota, USA\n\nPanos Constantinides, University of Manchester, UK\n\nDonato Cutolo, IE Business School, Spain\n\nMark de Reuver, TU Delft, Netherlands\n\nKevin Hong, University of Miami, USA\n\nThomas Huber, ESSEC Business School, France\n\nAsadi Someh Ida, UQ Business School, Australia\n\nWarut Khernamnui, McGill University, Canada\n\nTobias Kretschmer, LMU Munich, Germany\n\nHyeokkoo (Eric) Kwon, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n\nKyunghee Lee, Wayne State University, USA\n\nChen Liang, University of Connectitut, USA\n\nShi Ying Lim, National University of Singapore, Singapore\n\nAngela Lu, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\nMareike Möhlmann, Bentley University, USA\n\nJan Ondrus, ESSEC Singapore, Singapore\n\nGorkem Turgut (G.T.)

As a forum, it provides scholars an opportunity to grapple with the complexity of AI technologies and the range of social phenomena and consequences at stake. We hope to see authors attend to a variety of important “outcomes”, beyond the effectiveness of the AI-based system for the developer or adopting corporation, and consider wide-ranging impacts on consumers, employees, and other stakeholders. This would include studies that focus on improving individuals’ lives in fundamental ways such as managing pandemics and health outcomes, addressing income inequality, dampening systemic racial biases, and engaging with climate crises.\n\nDigital innovation using emerging technologies such as AI, machine learning, and analytics, depends on the ability to access, curate, and build models based on large data resources. This raises issues of data governance and stewardship and invites questions about facilitating access to and reuse of data for AI-enabled innovation. We welcome studies that address such emerging and thorny challenges by proposing innovative approaches to policy and organizational practices in designing, developing, and implementing AI systems.\n\nWe aim for a sociotechnical understanding of AI systems. Studies should engage both with technical aspects as well as people, organizational, and/or community structures and processes. We are also interested in different sociomaterial approaches for examining how the AI artefact and its underlying data and algorithms are entangled with designers, implementers, users, and institutional forces in the broader ecosystem and how this may influence outcomes, often with unintended consequences.\n\nWe invite research that is theoretical, empirical, technical, quantitative, and/or qualitative. We are keen to attract insightful and impactful studies that are novel and pivot from existing research, theory, and practice. Authors must demonstrate how their research builds on and problematizes current knowledge on the topic. Research can be at any level of analysis, and we welcome in-depth cases of AI in specific organizations and more widely across the business ecosystem. We also encourage authors to unpack the black boxes associated with the AI artifact, its design, development, and adoption in their studies. Studies should aim to delineate and distinguish AI from traditional IT.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nCollaborating with AI for the future of work and society\n\nUnintended consequences of AI and algorithmic decision making\n\nFairness and ethics of AI and algorithms\n\nData governance and rules of data guardianship in human-AI hybrids\n\nNew theorizations of data in the age of AI\n\nExplainable AI and Responsible AI\n\nSolving business and societal problems using new AI and ML algorithms\n\nTensions between AI-based augmenting vs automating tasks in implementing AI\n\nMechanisms and practices for building and sustaining stakeholders’ trust in AI\n\nSecurity, privacy, and risk management in AI\n\nSharing work, spaces, and tasks with robotics and AI\n\nAlgorithm aversion in AI-enabled innovation\n\nLeveraging crowdsourcing to design AI-based innovation\n\nNew frameworks for regulating and governing data and AI\n\nEmpowering individuals and managing AI-enabled digital transformation\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nShamel Addas, Queen’s University, Canada\n\nSpyros Angelopoulos, University of Durham, UK\n\nAnkur Arora, University of Memphis, USA\n\nRoberta Bernardi, University of Bristol, UK\n\nFrederic Boy, Swansea University, UK\n\nShasha Deng, Shanghai International Studies University, China\n\nRebekah Eden, University of Queensland, Australia\n\nMazen El-Masri, Qatar University, Qatar\n\nEila Erfani, University of New South Wales, Australia\n\nThomas Gegenhuber, University of Leuphana, Germany\n\nMaryam Ghasemaghaei, McMaster University, Canada\n\nRoya Gholami, University of Illinois Springfield, USA\n\nSamrat Gupta, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, India\n\nMohammad Hossein Jarrahi, University of North Carolina, USA\n\nSeamas Kelly, University College Dublin, Ireland\n\nGohar Khan, University of Waikato, New Zealand\n\nJohn Lalor, University of Notre Dame, USA\n\nJingjing Li, University of Virginia, USA\n\nSamuel Liyala, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, Kenya\n\nOlivera Marjanovic, Macquarie University, Australia\n\nAnne-Sophie Mayer, KIN Center for Digital Innovation / Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nAlemayehu Molla, RMIT University, Australia\n\nMorteza Namvar, University of Queensland, Australia\n\nArif Perdana, Monash University, Indonesia\n\nHamed Qahri-Saremi, Colorado State University, USA\n\nHatim Rahman, Northwestern University, USA\n\nAzadeh Savoli, IÉSEG School of Management, France\n\nThi Van Hau Trieu, Deakin University, Australia\n\nElmira Van de Broek, Stockholm School of Economics, Sweden\n\nLauri Wessel, European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder), Germany\n\nTrack Title: IS Design, Development and Project Management\n\nTrack Chairs\n\nAlanah Mitchell\n\nDrake University\n\nalanah.mitchell@drake.edu\n\nBio: Dr. Alanah Mitchell is the Aliber Distinguished Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Information Management and Business Analytics in the College of Business and Public Administration at Drake University.

For example, rapid automation of processes using machine learning and artificial intelligence have impacted virtually every facet of IS design, development, and project management. IS development processes increasingly integrate operations with cross-functional software teams (i.e., DevOps) to manage complexity and respond with agility to changing market conditions. On the implementation front, new software development approaches combined with diverse software platforms and application environments provide the opportunity to broaden the array of approaches to design and development available to IS project managers. This enhances the prospect of approaches that fit better with organizational settings, personnel skills, and task demands. But given the complex and dynamic nature of IS projects, many projects continue to run over budget, extend past schedule, and deliver less than or different products than anticipated, needed, or preferred. Additionally, in response to the need for the large-scale digital transformation objectives, IT program management has emerged as a distinct discipline. Given that IS development projects and programs play a pivotal role in shaping the strategic direction of organizations and enabling them to gain and sustain a competitive advantage, researchers have unique opportunities to investigate not only the social, organizational, and technical challenges and risks associated with IS project management as well as the theoretical underpinnings of the myriad practices that have emerged over time.\n\nThis track welcomes papers that improve our understanding of the dynamic and complex nature of IS design, development, and project/program management in the digital age. We are especially interested in papers that advance theory and practice of emerging technologies in the context of dispersed organizational settings where ISD and project/program management often occur.

IT manufacturers have profited enormously through widespread implementation of new technologies (e.g., robotics and artificial intelligence) or upgrades and extensions to existing technologies. These technologies helped support work-from-home arrangements, workflow automation, online schooling, advanced data capabilities for storage and analytics, and industry-wide collaboration arrangements. However, not every IT implementation and adoption project has been successful, and many projects require steep learning curves in their delivery. At the same, the new or improved digital technologies are drivers for the transformation of entire industries, such as health care, agriculture, finance, and overall supply chains. The individuals (IT professionals) who are charged with implementation, and those who were asked to adopt digital technologies (e.g., teachers, office staff, essential workers) experience a constant tension of excitement and stress about these new technologies. More knowledge is needed about the behavioral, organizational, and institutional factors shaping implementation and adoption phenomena.\n\nThe track welcomes papers that improve our understanding of the dynamic and complex nature of IT implementation and adoption. We are especially interested in papers that advance theory and practice for emerging technologies and dispersed organizational settings in which implementation and adoption of novel technologies often take place. We welcome all types of research, including empirical, conceptual, and simulation-based studies that address social and technical aspects of implementation and adoption on societal, organizational, group, or individual levels.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nTensions that arise between the benefits and negative impacts of digital technology implementation and adoption\n\nEthical considerations that arise with the implementation and adoption of digital technologies with surveillance capabilities\n\nEmployee voice considerations in digital technology implementations\n\nLeadership in IT implementation and adoption projects\n\nImplementation and adoption of low-code and no-code digital technologies\n\nNovel philosophical/theoretical/methodological perspectives to master challenges of the implementation and adoption of digital technologies\n\nNovel conceptual perspectives on what constitutes adoption in the light of interconnected, autonomous technologies\n\nContextualized factors influencing IT/IS adoption at micro and macro levels\n\nInterdependencies between individual, group, organizational, or societal IT/IS adoption decisions and multilevel perspectives on adoption\n\nFeature- or affordance-oriented IT/IS implementation and adoption – challenges and opportunities\n\nLongitudinal perspectives on IT implementation and adoption behaviors\n\nGlobal or cross-cultural studies of IT/IS implementation, adoption, and post-adoption\n\nImplementation and adoption of IS and digital technologies to tackle social and ecological problems, such as systemic discrimination, social justice, societal and human crises, and climate change\n\nUnderstanding IT implementation through an expanded conception of value beyond performance (e.g., well-being, environmental health, societal stability)\n\nIdentifying diffusion patterns in adoption of emerging technologies\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nRuba Aljafari, University of Pittsburgh, USA\n\nTony Ammeter, University of Mississippi, USA\n\nAlexander Benlian, TU Darmstadt, Germany\n\nSven Carlsson, Lund Univesrity, Sweden\n\nYi-Te Chiu, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\n\nJocelyn Cranefield, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\n\nSherae Daniel, University of Cincinnati, USA\n\nSophia Duan, RMIT University, Australia\n\nRob Gleasure, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark\n\nLouise Harder Fischer, IT-Universitetet i København, Denmark\n\nAymeric Hemon-Hildgen, ESSCA School of Management, France\n\nHelena Holmstrom-Olsson, Malmo University, Sweden\n\nBlooma John, University of Canberra , Australia\n\nBjorn Johnasson, Linkkoping University, Sweden\n\nJohann Kranz, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich, Germany\n\nJacob Nørbjerg, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark\n\nYasser Rahrovani, Western University – Ivey School of Business, Canada\n\nTapani Rinta-Kahila, The University of Queensland, Australia\n\nChristoph Rosenkranz, University of Cologne, Germany\n\nDaniel Russo, Aalborg University, Denmark\n\nTerence Saldanha, University of Georgia, USA\n\nMario Schaarschmidt, Northumbria University Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\nAbdul Sesay, University of Georgia, USA\n\nJeannette Stark, TU Dresden, Germany\n\nViktoria Stray, University of Oslo, Norway\n\nDavid Sudnaram, University of Auckland, New Zealand\n\nRui Sundrup, University of Louisville, USA\n\nPitso Tsibolane, University of Cape Town, South Africa\n\nChristine Van Toorn, University of New South Wales, Australia\n\nGregory Vial, HEC Montreal, Canada\n\nXiaofeng Wang, University of Bolzano, Italy\n\nXiaojun Zhang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR\n\nAljona Zorina, IESEG School of Management, France\n\nSander Zwanenburg, The University of Otago, New Zealand\n\nTrack Title: Data Analytics for Business and Societal Challenges\n\nTrack Chairs\n\nInduShobha Chengalur-Smith\n\nUniversity at Albany – SUNY\n\nshobha@albany.edu\n\nBio: InduShobha Chengalur-Smith is a Professor of Information Systems & Business Analytics at the School of Business in the University at Albany, SUNY.
