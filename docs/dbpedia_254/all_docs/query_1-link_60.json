[http://magazine.lakeheadu.ca/page.php?p=29&i=5]\n\nSon of animator and documentary film maker Colin Low, Stephen Low was born in Ottawa and raised in Montreal. He attended Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, graduating in 1974. He began his career with the National Film Board of Canada about 1979 after four years spent in Newfoundland as a cameraman and editor. A brief daliance with Hollywood filmmaking convinced him to stick with documentaries: \"Hollywood plays with toys,\" he said, \"they never get close to the real thing.\" [http://magazine.lakeheadu.ca/page.php?p=29&i=5]\n\nAmong his projects as director at the NFB were \"Challenger: An Industrial Romance\" (1980) and \"Next Generation\" (1982) (both films are about the Challenger aircraft), and \"The Defender\" (1988). He wrote a short film, \"Acting Classes\" (1980), directed by John N. Smith.\n\nHis company is called The Stephen Low Company, established in 1985.\n\nReferences"
