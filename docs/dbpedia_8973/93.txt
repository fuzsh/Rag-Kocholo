Novorossiya or New Russia (Russian: Новороссия, IPA: [nəvɐˈrosʲɪjə]; Ukrainian: Новоросія, romanized:Novorosiia, [novoroˈsijɐ]), also referred to as the Union of People's Republics (Russian: Союз народных республик, romanized: Soyuz narodnykh respublik, IPA: [sɐˈjuz nɐˈroːdnɨx rʲɪˈspublʲɪk]; Ukrainian: Союз народних республік, romanized:Soiuz narodnykh respublik, [soˈjuz nɐˈrodnɪx resˈpublik]), was a project[1][2] for a confederation between the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) in Eastern Ukraine, both of which were under the control of pro-Russian separatists.[3]

The concept of "Novorossiya" emerged in public discourse with the beginning of the Donbas war in eastern Ukraine. Referring to the historic Novorossiya, a former imperial Russian territory conquered from the Cossacks and the Ottomans in which Russian settlers were encouraged to settle,[4] Russia promoted the Novorossiya concept as a new identity for the Ukrainian breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.
