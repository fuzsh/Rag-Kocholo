This document provides an overview of the history of Jews in Russia before the 19th century, beginning with their presence in the Khazarian kingdom in the 8th century. It discusses the migration of Jews from Persia to the Khazarian capital of Atil and the conversion of the Khazar ruling class to Judaism in the 8th century. It also mentions the presence of Jewish settlements in Crimea and mentions the interaction between early Russian principalities like Kiev and Jewish communities, with some Jews migrating to Kiev in the 10th-11th centuries. The document provides historical context on Jewish commercial and cultural roles in Kiev before discussing anti-Jewish riots there in 1113.",
