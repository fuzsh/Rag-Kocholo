        "text": "Common challenges and threats are more important than the crisis in Ukraine\n\nThe great storyteller Andersen has a wise phrase: \"All gilding will be erased - the pigskin remains.\" So, if you erase the \"gilding\" and remove the veil of norms, principles, declarations - from the western side, and from our side - from nostalgic motives that Russians and Ukrainians are actually one people, and Kiev is the mother of Russian cities and a forerunner of the entire Russian statehood, then there will be “naked geopolitical reality”. And this reality consists in the fact that, as some of our political scientists like to say, “some in the West” would very much like to tear Ukraine away from Russia, not only isolating it from the Slavic world, but also tightly tying it to the Western world.\n\nThis vision and everything that follows from it is based on the sentiments of a significant part of the Russian and Western elites, who, despite centuries of attempts at rapprochement, still view Russia and Europe as two separate spaces.\n\nHere, even the talk should not be about the thin at first thread of \"association\" with the EU, but about the repeatedly declared plans to admit Ukraine and Georgia to NATO. And this, when it came down to it, turned out to be absolutely unacceptable for Russia. Moreover, at the level of feelings, which, unlike cold geopolitical calculations, are much more difficult to ignore. We simply could not imagine that \"NATO ships would end up in the city of Russian naval glory - in Sevastopol.\"\n\nBut it was precisely this prospect, when it came to the brink of reality, that forced Russia to make every effort at the end of last year so that Ukraine did not even set foot on the path leading to Brussels, but turned onto the projected road of the Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nThe steep tack of the lapel from the Brussels pier laid by Yanukovych for the Ukrainian political course turned out to be too sharp - the ship of the Ukrainian statehood cracked at the seams, and then began to disintegrate. The first signs of the transition of a political setting to drama were revealed when a part of the Ukrainian people made a “choice with the heart”, speaking not only against the corrupt Yanukovych regime, but also for Greater Europe, as for some kind of abstract distant dream, which was more desirable than a hopeless, half-beggarly existence on the background of the shamelessly richer elite.\n\nTo say that some Western foundations organized the Maidan means to close our eyes to reality, to deny the Ukrainian people the right to make their own choice. Unfortunately, this kind of simplistic view of historical processes became a fashionable \"trend\" for a part of Russian political scientists, striving, as once in Soviet times, to lacquer the picture of the world, to adjust it to their own (and the then close Soviet party bosses) primitive views. The inglorious end to this approach is well known.\n\nNow the situation in Ukraine has entered an even more dramatic phase. Petro Poroshenko turned out to be a tough politician, ready to resolutely defend the declared goals of preserving a unitary Ukraine. It is clear that even a politically not yet strong president will not agree to voluntarily give up part of the territory of his own country. There is no doubt that the methods used by the Kiev regime - shelling and bombing of cities and villages where civilians live - deserve the most harsh condemnation. At the same time, the militias, or \"separatists\" as they are called outside of Russia, are also very determined, but the degree of support for them today by the civilian population is not completely clear. As a result, getting out of the Ukrainian crisis (UK) appears to be a task with many unknowns.\n\nHowever, as for the compromise on the level of feelings, it seems that it has already taken place - Kiev has resigned itself to the idea that the rebellious regions will have to provide more freedom (it remains only to agree on the degree of such freedom). And the most far-sighted representatives of the “popularly elected” numerous structures of the DPR are beginning to understand that the likelihood of a “complete divorce” from Ukraine and the transformation of the DPR into a sovereign, but few recognized state is decreasing every day. Moreover, although a compromise on the \"eastern regions\" is seen as a real alternative, it is absolutely unclear whether this compromise will have contracting parties.\n\nIn Russia, calls, even from the most \"untethered\" politicians and political scientists, for the use of force by Russia, are heard less and less. In order to reduce the intensity of passions around the crisis, the President of the Russian Federation made a well-founded decision to apply to the Federation Council with a request to revoke the permission to send troops to Ukraine. At the same time, calls and signals from Moscow to international structures with an insistent recommendation to actively intervene and de-escalate the conflict have grown significantly.\n\nFrom the point of view of the geopolitical consequences for our bilateral relations, it must be admitted that, unfortunately, Russia is no longer perceived in Ukraine as a historically fraternal people and a friendly country. The topic of Crimea will constantly be raised in the Ukrainian political space and will be included in the programs of the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian politicians, presidents, and political parties. For its part, Moscow, in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible, would need to clarify and concretize its vision of future relations with Ukraine, which would include such important components as its desirable bloc-free and nuclear-free status. Promoting Moscow's interests in relation to Ukraine remains a task that needs to be addressed, and preferably in the most conflict-free manner.\n\n\"Near-European\" consequences\n\nToday, the future of European security depends on the effectiveness and level of resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. If this decision is implemented at the level of top officials of states, then it will be possible to reach a real strengthening of the foundations of European security, which, obviously, have begun to erode.\n\nMost Russian politicians and experts consider the process of NATO enlargement, as well as the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the independence of Kosovo, which seriously undermined the foundations of international law, among the most powerful factors that have dealt a blow to these foundations. In fact, among these and some other factors, one should look for an incentive for Russia's actions, first in Crimea, and then in the active support of “supporters of independence” in eastern Ukraine.\n\nFor two decades (!), Russia's objections and concerns regarding the process of the alliance's enlargement have not been raised at all, and in response to our remarks we have received the same worn-out record: “NATO expansion is an expansion of democracy and it does not threaten Russia's security at all. \". Back at a security conference in Munich in 2007, President Vladimir Putin was very critical, but quite in a partnership dialogue mode, he listed “non-partner elements” in relations between Russia and the West. He also mentioned disregard for the fundamental principles of international law, and the process of NATO enlargement, which has nothing to do with ... ensuring security in Europe, and plans to deploy elements of a missile defense system in Europe, which could mean another round of the inevitable arms race in this case, and some other important moments for Russia and, therefore, for international security. There was no practically significant reaction to this speech.\n\nMoreover, the absolutely selfish and short-sighted policy of expanding the alliance was taking over new countries - the former republics of the USSR. First, the Baltic states, to which Russia reacted rather calmly. But then at NATO summits and outside of them, Georgia and Ukraine began to be named as the next candidates. I think that in this context it is difficult to consider the two deepest crises (with a powerful force element) that happened in Russia's relations with these countries and with the West as a coincidence: with Georgia in 2008 and with Ukraine at the present time.\n\nThe widely advertised cooperation between Russia and NATO with excessively exaggerated areas of interaction (largely designed to bureaucratic fill the bilateral dialogue) turned out to be candy wrappers. The majority of the Russian political and expert community knew practically nothing about its real results. We must honestly admit that this cooperation, which has repeatedly changed in its form, which, as recorded in the joint documents, was intended to develop a strong, stable and long-term partnership on the basis of common interests, reciprocity and transparency, could not reduce the level of mistrust of the Russian elite by a degree. and the public to the North Atlantic Alliance.\n\nThe outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis breathed life-giving force into the old mechs of NATO, which, after the end of the Cold War and the confrontation with the USSR, tried in every possible way to find its new, including a very unusual mission for a military-political bloc. And now - after the start of the Criminal Code, NATO for many years gets the opportunity to noticeably approach its old \"good\" mission - military preparations based on the view of the heir to the USSR - Russia as a potential adversary. Finally, NATO received enough arguments to reaffirm its irreplaceable role in ensuring European security, and not somewhere outside, but within Europe itself.\n\nThere can be no doubt that NATO headquarters will try to take full advantage of this chance. There is no longer any doubt that a new Strategic Concept of the alliance will be adopted, where there will be no place for constructive formulations from previous documents, which believed that a strong and constructive partnership with Russia, based on mutual trust, transparency and predictability, is in the best interests of the alliance.\n\nStill, it should be noted that although Moscow is confident that for a long time the West continued to pursue a trivial policy of containment towards Russia, the NATO leadership, even in the new conditions, is not yet officially ready to confirm this course, hoping nevertheless to preserve the prospect of restoring relations with Moscow. The Alliance Secretary General gives assurances that \"NATO countries are not trying to surround Russia and are not hostile against it.\"\n\nHowever, some measures are already being taken and may be expected in the future. It can be assumed that the long-lasting reduction of the American presence in Europe will be put on hold. The \"Atlantic bond\" between Europe and the United States in the field of defense will be strengthened and confirmed in every possible way.\n\nIn the absence of obvious positive shifts in relations, Russia will be positioned as a state against which \"NATO Europe\" will still need to plan a policy of containment and be ready for forceful opposition. After a thirty-year break, the armed confrontation on the European continent will no longer be viewed by the NATO military as an unrealistic prospect. The prospect of further reductions in conventional arms in Europe will also disappear.\n\nIt is safe to assume that in the new situation, any calls for the withdrawal of the remnants of the American tactical nuclear weapons (TNW) from European territory will cease to be relevant. Any dialogue on TNW, in which Russia, however, is not very interested, is also postponed for a long time. The continuation of unilateral reductions in strategic offensive arms, carried out, for example, in Great Britain, which now will not arouse the support of either decision-making circles or the general public, is also in question.\n\nFor European countries, there are new compelling reasons for each country to bring the level of defense spending to two percent of GDP (so far only five countries make such allocations). The modernization of weapons is intensifying, and joint maneuvers (including of a significant scale) will become more frequent, especially with the participation of new NATO members on the territory of the new NATO members, primarily from among the countries bordering on Russia. In this context, it is absolutely realistic to increase efforts for joint defense, such as the already existing increase in the intensity of patrolling the airspace of the Baltic States.\n\nIf there is no further and even more serious deterioration of relations, then we can probably not expect the appearance in Europe of what our propagandists like to call \"NATO bases\" in Afghanistan). It is worth recalling that in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, which the alliance continues to abide by, NATO has committed itself to \"exercise its collective defense ... not through the additional permanent deployment of substantial combat forces.\"\n\nAnother important and extremely sensitive element of military-political relations between Russia and the West is the prospect of creating a European missile defense system. Regardless of the reasoning about the advisability of placing this system and its long-term effectiveness, the main thing should be stated - it has become a negative reality in relations between Russia and the US / NATO. In the new conditions, I think, there is practically no hope of getting, in the words of the President of the Russian Federation, at least \"some insignificant legal piece of paper, where it would be written that this is not against us.\" Few in the West, even at the expert level, share the widespread point of view in our country that the European missile defense poses a realistic threat to Russia's nuclear deterrent potential (especially since the fourth, most technically advanced phase of the European missile defense deployment has been canceled). However, under the new conditions, hardly anyone will make any steps towards Russia in additional evidence - \"guarantees\" of this fact.\n\nAmong the countries of Europe and the world, a division has already emerged: into those who are ready to re-establish relations with Russia to a certain extent, returning them to normal, or serve as an intermediary for such an establishment (like Austria and France, for example), and those who are not wants to \"compromise principles\" (and here the United States will be in the forefront). Particular concern for their future will be characteristic of the Baltic states and other states bordering on Russia.\n\nIn the CIS countries, where there is a large share of the Russian-speaking population and there are regions that were historically part of Russia, moods of concern have settled. The constant mention of the formation of Novorossiya in Russian political \"talk shows\" and the media as a kind of geopolitical goal cannot but serve as a reminder that the present-day Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia were once part of the Novorossiysk province within the Russian Empire, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan. As we remember, the CIS countries did not take a position of decisive and unequivocal support for Moscow's actions in Crimea, preferring to prudently keep silent or make very vague statements. Even such a close and trusted ally as President of Belarus Alexander Lukasheko throughout the conflict after the Maidan deliberately maintained close contacts with the leaders of the \"Kiev junta\" (as it was called in Moscow) and personally arrived at the inauguration of the newly elected President Poroshenko.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis has led to an aggravation of Russia's relations with the Council of Europe, which declares its main goals to be the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights and the strengthening of the rule of law in Europe. The result of the voting in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was a rather \"half-hearted decision\" - depriving the delegation of the Russian Federation of the right to vote while retaining its powers. However, in the whole situation around the Criminal Code, unexpectedly for many, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) played a special and very effective role.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis has given new breath to speculations about the existence of a certain value gap between Russia and the West, about the special path of a “separate” Russian “civilization”. Among other things, this kind of reasoning often stems from the desire to provide an \"ideological justification\" for the fact that we, the Russian (Russian) people, are doomed for some reason to live poorer and worse than others, but we are attracted by a certain higher idea (in the specific case, the recreation of Novorossia , no, so something else). Such an explanation completely ignores and shifts the focus away from our own mistakes and failures, and if we add to this the new \"facts\" of the existence of the centuries-old anti-Russian conspiracy led by Britain and the current subversive actions of the world behind the scenes led by the United States, which are constantly revealed by our television, then it is clearly not up to the analysis of the shortcomings of the domestic social and economic policy.\n\nIn any case, all this fashionable conspiracy theories, regardless of the number of its supporters, does not negate the urgent need for Russia to unite efforts with other members of the world community in countering common challenges and threats, in strengthening regional and international security, and, ultimately, its own security. Providing all these tasks alone, or even more so on the principle of \"Russia against all\" (which some home-grown \"thinkers\" are pushing to do) will be prohibitively costly and absolutely unjustified from the point of view of the continuing possibilities of cooperation in international affairs.\n\nRussia - America and the world\n\nThe domestic political elite can pretend as much as they like that relations with Washington do not matter to us, and some of its most remote representatives can continue to parasitize on inflating the topic of anti-Americanism. It should be noted, however, that from the very beginning of the Ukrainian crisis (UK), President Vladimir Putin emphasized the importance of maintaining bilateral cooperation with the United States in the widest range, saying that security is not only interested in Russia with its partners, but also our partners are interested in cooperation with us. It is very easy to destroy these instruments of cooperation and it will be very difficult to re-create them. ”\n\nAnd here it should be not just about cooperation, but about the special role of Russia and the United States in it as powers bearing \"a special responsibility for ensuring international stability and security.\" The two countries \"must cooperate in the interests not only of their own peoples, but of the whole world.\" This was announced by Putin in July of this year, when US President Barack Obama congratulated on the national holiday - US Independence Day.\n\nMoscow in every way and at all levels of the executive branch emphasizes its readiness to resume \"global\" interaction on the widest range of issues. From Washington, however, one can hear stubborn: a return \"to business, as always\" is impossible.\n\nYes, indeed, the Criminal Code has highlighted serious disagreements. These include fundamental differences in the interpretation of the fundamental provisions of international law. Accusations of violating it were constantly heard from Russia against the United States, and now from the United States against Russia. We absolutely disagreed in our assessments and admissibility of the forms of various interference in internal affairs and in what can be called “vital interests” of each other.\n\nFrom the point of view of Russian politicians and experts, the United States seeks to establish world domination and return a unipolar world, while the American political and academic community accuses Moscow of restoring the Soviet Union. Washington and other Western capitals will never call what happened, in their opinion, the \"annexation\" of Crimea \"voluntary annexation based on the free expression of the will of citizens.\" As well as never, the United States and the West will not agree with the existence of an absolutely \"independent\" movement of Eastern Ukraine for independence without significant interference from the Russian side, and especially its transfer to an active stage of the armed struggle.\n\nFormed fundamental and so far insurmountable differences will affect many areas that are sensitive for both sides. Thus, until now, the process of \"arms control\" has been largely initiated by the efforts of Moscow and Washington. By the way, more than once the decisive word (in favor of Russia) was sounded by the United States in resolving the problems of multilateral negotiations.\n\nNow, instead of implementing the next stages of reducing and limiting nuclear weapons, we will observe an increase in reliance on nuclear deterrence, which is gaining a second wind. Accordingly, after the Ukrainian events, countries that had plans to get closer to the goal of acquiring nuclear weapons received an additional incentive. In our two capitals, the ideas of striving for a safer, nuclear-free world, preached back in Soviet times, will be put aside for a long time.\n\nThe situation that has arisen after the Criminal Code will, on the whole, have a detrimental effect not only on the general state of affairs in the sphere of world security, where Moscow and Washington have traditionally played the first violin, but also in a number of critically important areas requiring constant attention, in which effective cooperation cannot be ensured without close interaction. primarily in the spheres of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism.\n\nIt should be expected that in American official documents in the field of defense, Russia will occupy a place that was empty after the collapse of the USSR for several decades, if not immediately as a potential enemy, then as a serious opponent on the world stage. As a result of the Criminal Code, the American military-industrial complex and the so-called hawks have gained weighty arguments in favor of the intensive development and modernization of weapons, primarily those systems that can directly or indirectly be aimed at countering Russia.\n\nWashington is stepping up the promotion on the world stage of organizational, economic and financial decisions that limit the interests of our country. For example, it was the American high-ranking representatives who exerted direct pressure on Bulgaria so that it would withdraw from the South Stream project, which is extremely important for Russia in modern conditions.\n\nThe resulting disagreements in principle doom Moscow and Washington to so-called electoral cooperation for a long time, when, from a wide palette, each of the parties will try to establish only unconditionally advantageous areas of interaction. Although this will lead to constant friction, it will require dialogue and compromise. However, in any case, Washington, if it so wishes, can complicate Moscow's life to a much greater extent than vice versa.\n\nAt one time, Russian representatives long sought membership of the Russian Federation in the main international institutions of the Western world. Moreover, both politicians and experts, it would seem, argued how important it is for Russia to get a \"worthy place\" among the most developed states. Now they are trying to convince us of the opposite - they say, all this is not very necessary and we do not particularly hold on to this membership. So who was right and when? There can be no two \"truths\" in such a fundamental issue, which means that either in the arguments of past years, or in the current ones, there is hidden a weighty propaganda element or at least a share of guile.\n\nIf we look at it in detail, it turns out that Russia, if it wished, received and can continue to derive significant benefits for itself from such membership. We easily parted with our participation in the G15, while many forgot that it was through this structure, within the framework of a specially created “global partnership” program, that it was possible to resolve the issue of allocating more than XNUMX billion dollars (!) For the elimination of Russian nuclear submarines that had served their life. and chemical weapons.\n\nAmong other world centers, the UK has sensitively affected relations with Japan, which began to acquire a new quality after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power.\n\nAfter the winding down of relations with the West, Moscow began hastily to enlist even more support from Beijing. At the end of May, a massive state visit to the PRC was urgently organized, during which the parties signed over forty agreements. Of course, his goal was, among other things, to demonstrate to the West the relations of \"comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction\" between Moscow and Beijing.\n\nHowever, certain elements of the cost of such interaction raise questions. Thus, the benefits for Russia of a gas agreement signed after ten years of negotiations (!) With China (at prices lower than European ones) is questioned by authoritative experts. It is clear that the funds that can be potentially bailed out under this contract are incomparable with the European direction, and any \"price maneuvers\" that the Russian side practiced with other partners will have to give up. In a broader context, it is absolutely obvious that the broadest interaction with China cannot replace the large-scale and multidisciplinary cooperation with Europe that has developed over decades. Moreover, falling into the \"geopolitical embrace\" of Beijing without having a \"counterweight\" in the form of partnerships with other world centers is rather short-sighted.\n\nThe realities of the “big world” after the Criminal Code are such that Russia's position on Crimea and Ukraine is practically not supported, and this is a new situation from which to proceed. The \"main\" world security mechanism - the UN Security Council, which cannot even make seemingly obvious decisions aimed at ending violence in Ukraine, has stalled tightly.\n\nThe global security system as a whole has begun to “unscrew”. The contradictions between Russia and the countries of the West, primarily the United States, which were growing even before the onset of the Criminal Code, did not allow timely and effective settlement of regional conflicts - like the Syrian one, for example. Decisive joint measures to eliminate Syrian chemical weapons were, unfortunately, more the exception than the rule. Negative tendencies in the world will only grow, as regional actors have begun to understand that in the near future, coordinated and decisive joint intervention of Russia and the United States in the settlement of conflict situations cannot be expected, and any vote in the UN Security Council will most likely be blocked by one of the parties.\n\nAnd there are more than enough regions that will require the closest attention in the near future. This is, first of all, the Middle East (with a separate problem of the Iranian nuclear program and its true direction), where peoples, following each other's example, began to awaken from the decades-old rule of authoritarian regimes, and South Asia, where the most dangerous conflict between two “new regional nuclear powers is smoldering. \"- India and Pakistan. This is the DPRK, which has significantly intensified its provocative policy, and a number of other countries located in various parts of the world.\n\nBy the way, to write off the powerful popular protests (and armed conflicts) that have manifested themselves in recent years, for example, the fall of North African regimes one after another, purely at the expense of \"Washington's intrigues\" means not wanting to see the real processes taking place in the world, turning a blind eye to historical doom in our days of totalitarian and \"inherited\" authoritarian regimes. As for the intrigues attributed to the \"insidious Washington backstage\" and the methods it promotes such as \"controlled chaos\", in fact, in the Arab East for some reason it turns out that as a result, regimes that are absolutely manipulated by the Americans are suddenly replaced by unstable, unpredictable and even forces hostile to Washington. Perhaps, after all, domestic propagandists of such theories should turn to their own \"ideological past\" - Marxism-Leninism, which prioritized the decisive role of social processes, the people in the change of power and formations?\n\nA consequence of the Criminal Code is the facilitation of conditions for the expansion of the influence of extreme (radical) Islamism, which puts on the agenda a possible further disintegration of states - a continuation of the reshaping of the geopolitical map of the world. And here the first candidate is Iraq. The question of the future fate of Afghanistan and the potential growing threat to the southern borders of the CIS and Russia is being raised very seriously. In both cases, a significant element of internal destabilization was brought about by the short-sighted actions of the United States and NATO.\n\nIf we do not stop the processes of delimiting Russia and the West, then we will find ourselves on the verge of another geopolitical division of the world, which, following the example of the Cold War times, will be divided into \"clients\" of the United States (Western countries) and Russia. And each side will in every possible way \"patronize\" its representatives and stimulate protest actions against the other. But if earlier this kind of \"alignment\" was conditioned by the considered irreconcilable ideologized confrontation between two \"antagonistic\" systems - socialism and capitalism, now there are no fundamental theoretical prerequisites for this. Unless, of course, we do not take into account the legacy of the Cold War itself and its mentality and the parables about the centuries-old world conspiracy against Russia that are regularly reproduced in the domestic media space.\n\nDoom for partnership\n\nNo matter how many homegrown Eurasians and others like them try to draw a special path for Russia - its kind of \"solo voyage\", world realities urgently dictate that the dreams of domestic would-be geopolitics can, and even then conditionally, come true only for some invented world and an absolutely self-sufficient state ... But there is no such world, just as there is no such state in modern life. Everyone, even the smallest countries, needs something (and, as a rule, a lot) from the surrounding world.\n\nAlso, Russia urgently needs close interaction with other participants in the world process, \"embedding\" in global production and other chains. Otherwise, we will be forced to produce all the necessary goods ourselves (the embodiment of an unfulfilled dream of Soviet times), and at an exorbitant price and far from the best quality (as it was in the USSR). The world has long adopted and operates the optimal way of division of labor and production, which allows you to seriously save your own resources, directing them to the priority goals of national development.\n\nToday, moreover, it is purely utilitarian for Russia, for its economy and for filling the budget, revenues from the export of energy resources are vital. And in this sense, the relatively coordinated actions of the West that have occurred as a result of the Criminal Code to obstruct the construction of the South Stream are very sensitive for Moscow.\n\nIt is also very likely that Western countries, the United States in the first place, after the events of the Criminal Code will seriously undertake a significant qualitative improvement of weapons for the \"guaranteed\" containment of Russia in the future and to ensure effective counteraction in any conflict scenarios. If Russia, with a huge gap in GDP with the United States and a \"near-crisis\" state of the economy, not the highest level of scientific, technical and technological development, suddenly decides to symmetrically respond to such a challenge, then it will do it differently than through a serious decrease in the standard of living, social and other meaningful programs will fail. Thus, the country may find itself in a serious socio-political crisis, akin to the one in which the Soviet Union plunged in the last years of its existence.\n\nThe consequences of the Criminal Code, the development and \"summation\" of which is still far from complete, for a long time blocked for Russia the prospect of modernization and innovative development of the economy on the basis of foreign partnership - the goals set in official documents (the decree of President Vladimir Putin \"On measures to implement the foreign policy of the Russian Federation \"2012, Foreign Policy Concept, etc.). The possibility of realizing such installations was quite rightly considered in the context of close international cooperation and partnership with the most developed countries. As Vladislav Surkov, who some time ago held the post of first deputy chairman of the presidential commission on modernization and technological development, stated, “the situation is ... very sad. Our own intellectual powers are small. Therefore, there can be no sovereign modernization. \"\n\nIt should be noted that China, for all its efforts and successes, is not among the leaders of modernization. But the United States and Japan, of course, are such leaders.\n\nThe arguments that we are supposedly modernizing the civilian sectors of the economy through trillions of injections into the military sphere, including the improvement and production of weapons, are poorly realizable. Firstly, because such a path is a priori much more costly in comparison with direct modernization of the \"civilian\". And, secondly, in our country, in which secrecy not only does not decrease, but also grows again due to the sublimation of the mood of the \"besieged fortress\", it will be extremely difficult to establish an effective system of transferring inventions from the military to the civilian industry, which is missing today. All this means only one thing: Russia needs to return to a normal channel relations with both the aforementioned and other highly developed countries.\n\nMoscow \"showed character\" by showing the West the danger of pursuing a selfish policy that does not take into account Russia's interests and concerns. It seems that all the participants in the difficult and in many ways tragic events have learned enough lessons from what happened.\n\nOf course, some Western countries and some politicians may insist on isolating Russia. But, firstly, it is physically impossible due to the scale of our country and the volume of its ties with the rest of the world. And, secondly, for such large and significant countries in situations of crisis in relations with the outside world, no other recipe has been invented except for their greater involvement in world affairs. Only the awareness of one's own involvement and significance for the surrounding world will contribute to the restoration and development of cooperative ties, adjusting the forms and methods of politics. The transition to world politics based on the tug of the geopolitical tightrope - geopolitical rivalry, is essentially futile and super-costly for all participants.\n\nThe Russian political elite must sharply curtail the anti-Western and anti-American rhetoric that has become common and fashionable in our country. Further dispersal of the propaganda machine along these rails is causing Russia not only a tangible reputational damage, but also economic damage, and increasingly complicates the return to vital cooperation with the West. A decrease in the level of anti-Russian rhetoric in the United States is no less desirable.\n\nTo return to \"normal life\", it is necessary, first of all, to stop and settle the conflict itself in eastern Ukraine, which is still in a very active phase. It is undoubtedly positive that, with persistent pressure from Russia, it has already managed to raise the dialogue to the level of foreign ministers, who offer practically significant ways out of the crisis. A positive shift also lies in the fact that an approaching \"direct\" dialogue between the opposing sides has begun. However, to establish a lasting and lasting peace, and not just muffle the conflict, an active presence in the peace process of all interested parties is necessary. And this means the participation of not only European partners, but also Washington, whose representatives, obviously, were involved in controversial actions at various stages of the Ukrainian events. It seems that de facto, for further conflict-free coexistence in Europe, the West should proceed from the existence of special vital interests of Russia in the near abroad.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that it is not just the internal Ukrainian conflict or the controversial situation between Kiev and Moscow that must be resolved, but the largest and deepest crisis that has arisen since the end of the Cold War. The participation of all parties at the highest level is essentially necessary in order to start a fundamental conversation about the ways and mechanisms of strengthening European and international security, the obligation to strictly adhere to the existing principles of ensuring it, and the possible introduction of the required adjustments to them. In fact, in the European context, we are talking about a return to the idea of ​​a European Security Treaty proposed in 2008 by Russia, which was then left without due attention. It is urgent to create such a mechanism when not only will each other's concerns be timely removed, but there will be no reasons for the very emergence (and even more prolonged existence) of any concerns in the field of security.\n\nIn this regard, the OSCE's actual renaissance, which for a long time has received a hail of criticism for its \"low efficiency\" and the presence of double standards, is encouraging, especially from Russian officials. Here you can return to the idea of ​​transforming this organization into a kind of UN for Europe.\n\nIn any case, without seriously raising the issue of new approaches to ensuring security, without gradually reaching wide-format agreements such as \"Helsinki-2\" for Greater Europe, at least, and better - and new bilateral political agreements on the principles of Russia-US relations, no lasting peace, nor effective cooperation in common interests.\n\nSergey Oznobishchev"
