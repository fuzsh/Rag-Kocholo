INTRODUCTION\n\nA. QUALIFICATIONS\n\n1. My name is Oleg Serzhevich Bondarenko. I am a colonel of the reserve of the Armed\n\nForces of the Russian Federation. I have been asked to act as an expert in practical issues\n\nrelated to the implementation of international humanitarian law.\n\n2. I describe my relevant experience below:\n\n(a) I graduated from the Kharkov Guards Tank Command College in 1988, with\n\nspecialisation in tactical command system of tank forces with the military rank of\n\nLieutenant. Subsequently, I studied at the Military Academy of Armoured Forces,\n\ngraduating in 1995 with specialisation in operational-tactical command and staff\n\nsystem of tank forces.\n\n(b) I served in the Armed Forces of the USSR and of the Russian Federation in\n\ncommand and staff positions. During my service, I was involved in planning and\n\nconducting combat training activities. From 1998 I served in one of the military\n\ndepartments of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, where I was\n\ninvolved in developing and coordinating the development of documents relating to\n\nthe preparation and conduct of combat operations (military doctrines).\n\n(c) In 2000, I completed a basic course in the law of armed conflict at the International\n\nInstitute of Humanitarian Law (San Remo, Italy).\n\n(d) From 1998 to 2006 I was a member and executive secretary of the Russian Ministry\n\nof Defence's freelance working group on the integration of international\n\nhumanitarian law. I am one of the authors of the Manual on International\n\nHumanitarian Law for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.1\n\n(e) From 2006 to 2020 I worked in the Moscow Regional Delegation of the\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross in the Russian Federation, Belarus and\n\nMoldova (the name of the structural unit is given as of July 2020). Last position:\n\n1 Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Manual on International Humanitarian Law for the Armed Forces\n\nof the Russian Federation, 8 August 2001, available at:\n\nhttps://docs.cntd ru/document/1300243501?ysclid=le9upv99rh909315846 (Exhibit A).\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 6 out of 29\n\nFAS Delegate – Head of FAS unit at the Moscow Regional Delegation of the\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross to the Russian Federation, Belarus and\n\nMoldova (FAS Delegate – Head of FAS unit). My duties included liaising with the\n\narmed forces of Russia, Belarus and Moldova and with the executive and\n\ncoordinating bodies of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Council\n\nof Defence Ministers of the Commonwealth of Independent States on matters\n\nrelating to the implementation and integration of international humanitarian law and\n\nprotection of victims of armed conflicts.\n\n(f) From 2004 to 2020 I was one of the lecturers of the Advanced Training Course for\n\nOfficers of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Law of Armed\n\nConflict, where not only representatives of the Russian Federation, but also foreign\n\nspecialists from Armenia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan,\n\nKyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and\n\nUzbekistan were trained.\n\n(g) From 2010 to 2019, I was a freelance lecturer at the International Institute of\n\nHumanitarian Law (San Remo, Italy) and my duties included training in\n\ninternational humanitarian law / law of armed conflict for officials, including\n\nRussian and Ukrainian representatives.\n\nB. QUESTIONS PUT TO THE EXPERT\n\n3. I have been asked to prepare an expert report for submission to the International Court of\n\nJustice in the case before ICJ, \"Application of the International Convention for the\n\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the International Convention on the\n\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\" (Ukraine v. Russian Federation). My\n\ntask is to assess, from the perspective of international humanitarian law (hereinafter,\n\nIHL), Ukraine's allegations concerning alleged shelling of Bugas roadblock on 13 January\n\n2015, of Kramatorsk on 10 February 2015, Mariupol on 24 January 2015 and Avdeyevka\n\nfrom January to March 2017 including the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces\n\n(hereinafter, UAF) in this context.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 7 out of 29\n\nII. SUMMARY\n\n4. As a result of the analysis of the available materials provided by Ukraine in support of its\n\nallegations as well as of publicly available sources I have come to the following\n\nconclusions.\n\n5. General conclusions:\n\n(a) Ukraine has argued that the armed conflict in Ukraine since 2014 is an international\n\narmed conflict. Based on this qualification, the Ukrainian side and its expert should\n\nhave conducted a legal assessment of the hostilities in terms of the Geneva\n\nConventions of 12 August 1949, and the Additional Protocol to the Geneva\n\nConventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of\n\nInternational Armed Conflicts (hereinafter, Protocol I).\n\n(b) Assuming that the conflict was not of an international character, the Martens\n\nClause, Article 3 common to all the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and\n\nthe Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating\n\nto the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (hereinafter,\n\nProtocol II) and customary international law applied to it.\n\n(c) International practice showcases that only intentional acts against persons or\n\nproperty can be classified as a serious violation of IHL rules.\n\n(d) The civilian casualties resulting from the shelling in question were caused by\n\nUkrainian’s failure to take, or the taking of ineffective precautions to protect\n\ncivilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects from the dangers\n\narising from military operations. All the objects attacked were under control of\n\nUkraine. It was the Ukrainian side that was responsible for the security of persons\n\nand objects it controlled.\n\n6. Conclusions regarding the shelling of the Bugas roadblock:\n\n(a) The Bugas roadblock was a military objective in its purpose and use. DPR forces\n\njustifiably considered it as such.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 8 out of 29\n\n(b) Attacks on military objectives located deep within the lines of deployment of the\n\nUAF in the area of Ukraine's so-called \"antiterrorist operation\" zone (hereinafter,\n\nATO), may have been carried out by DPR forces in order to gain an operational\n\nadvantage.\n\n(c) Allegations by Ukraine and Lieutenant General Christopher Brown (hereinafter,\n\nGeneral Brown) of a deliberate attack on the Bugas roadblock to terrorise civilians\n\nare not supported by the facts.\n\n(d) Considering that the Bugas roadblock was a purely civilian object (as the Ukrainian\n\nside claims), Ukraine has placed the civilian object within the lines of the UAF\n\ndeployment and within reach of enemy weapons, thus endangering the safety of\n\ncivilians passing through the roadblock. It follows, in particular, that Ukraine has\n\nfailed to take all possible precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects under\n\nits control from the consequences of attacks, which is the rule applicable in both\n\ninternational and internal armed conflict.2\n\n(e) Also, if the Bugas roadblock was a civilian object, in order to ensure the security of\n\ncivilians and in line with IHL principles, the UAF command could have informed\n\nthe enemy of the civilian status of the roadblock to prevent attacks that endangered\n\nthe security of civilians.\n\n7. Conclusions regarding the shelling of Mariupol:\n\n(a) Contrary to General Brown's assertion, the Soviet and/or Russian \"doctrine\"\n\nexplicitly requires the capture of settlements as objects ensuring the sustainability\n\nof defence by an attack from the march/after advance from depth or by assault,\n\nwhich requires the advancing troops to reliably hit all military objectives throughout\n\nthe depth of the enemy's forces deployment.\n\n(b) The UAF military command decided to equip defence positions and lines in close\n\nproximity to urban areas, which does not comply with Article 58 (b) of Protocol I\n\nor even general precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects under their\n\n2 See, e.g. J.M. Henckaerts, L. Doswald-Beck, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, VOLUME I\n\nRULES (ICRC and Cambridge University Press, Vol I, 2005, reprint 2009), Chapter 6, Rule 22, p. 87, available at:\n\nhttps://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 9 out of 29\n\ncontrol from the effects of attacks under customary law operating in an internal\n\narmed conflict.3\n\n(c) The UAF military command positioned military objectives in close proximity to\n\nurban areas and failed to take measures to evacuate civilians from the range of the\n\nenemy's primary means of destruction, as contemplated under Article 58 (a) of\n\nProtocol I or even mentioned common precautions under customary law operating\n\nin an internal armed conflict.4\n\n(d) There were defence positions on the outskirts of Mariupol, which were legitimate\n\nobjectives for attacks, so Ukraine's claims of a deliberate attack on civilian objects\n\nbased on intercepted radio traffic alone are questionable.\n\n8. Conclusions regarding the shelling of Kramatorsk:\n\n(a) The deployment of the ATO headquarters of the UAF on the Kramatorsk airfield\n\nmade it a particularly important military target, the destruction of which could affect\n\nthe success of all military operations by the DPR, as disabling elements of the\n\nenemy's control system is one of the main objectives of modern military operations.\n\n(b) Ukraine failed to take the precautionary measures in relation to consequences of\n\nattacks, as required by Article 58 of Protocol I, specifically (i) the requirement to\n\navoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas and (ii)\n\nthe requirement to evacuate civilians from a dangerous area that is within the range\n\nof impact of the enemy's weapons, or even similar measures prescribed by\n\ncustomary humanitarian law for internal armed conflict.5\n\n(c) General Brown claims a deliberate attack on civilian objects by the DPR. In doing\n\nso, he himself says that his conclusions are only the most plausible, not proven. I\n\nconsider these claims to be unsubstantiated. In view of General Samolenkov's\n\nconclusions, I believe that the damage to civilian objects was collateral damage\n\nfrom attacks targeting military objetives.\n\n3 See, e.g., J.M. Henckaerts, L. Doswald-Beck, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, VOLUME I\n\nRULES (ICRC and Cambridge University Press, Vol I, 2005, reprint 2009), Chapter 6, Rule 23, p. 91, available at:\n\nhttps://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf.\n\n4 Ibid.\n\n5 Ibid., Chapter 6, Rule 22, p. 87; Rule 23, p. 91.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 10 out of 29\n\n9. Conclusions regarding the shelling of Avdeyevka:\n\n(a) The entire Avdeyevka area was probably included in the UAF defence positions\n\nand lines system.\n\n(b) Confirmed and suspected UAF military facilities positioned in Avdeyevka were\n\nlegitimate objectives for attacks.\n\n(c) Civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects were consequences of attacks on\n\nlegitimate military objectives.\n\n(d) Ukraine failed to implement the requirements of the above-mentioned rules of IHL\n\nand did not take precautions against attacks (civilians were not evacuated from the\n\ndefence area and remained within the range of enemy firepower).\n\n(e) General Brown explicitly confirms Ukraine's failure to take precautions and\n\nacknowledges the UAF's use of civilian objects for military purposes.\n\n(f) The allegation of deliberate attacks on civilian population and objects in order to\n\ninduce fear among civilians is not supported by evidence.\n\n(g) The very presence of civilians not evacuated by the Ukrainian authorities from the\n\ndangerous area in compliance with Article 58 (a) of Protocol I or even similar rules\n\nof customary humanitarian law applicable in an internal armed conflict in\n\nAvdeyevka caused fear among the civilian population. Moreover, I concede that the\n\npopulation was deliberately not evacuated to be used as a \"shield\".\n\n10. I describe my findings in more detail below.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 11 out of 29\n\nIII. GENERAL REMARKS\n\nA. CLASSIFICATION OF THE SITUATION AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\n11. When considering the classification of the situation (including the determination of the\n\napplicable law), it should be noted that in 2015-2017, when the incidents (shelling) in\n\nquestion took place, there was an armed conflict in Ukraine between the government\n\narmed forces and the anti-government armed forces (armed forces and other armed\n\nformations of the DPR), who, being under responsible command, exercised control over\n\npart of Ukraine´s territory. The control allowed them to carry out sustained and concerted\n\nmilitary actions. This makes the DPR and LPR and Ukraine parties to an armed conflict\n\nthat should have complied with IHL.\n\n12. As a general analysis of the situation in 2015-2017 demonstrates, in order to promote the\n\nprotection of civilians from the effects of hostilities, the representatives of the DPR armed\n\nforces distinguished themselves from the civilian population by wearing uniforms with\n\nappropriate insignia. General Brown states in his Second Expert Report (hereinafter also\n\n\"General Brown´s Second Report\")6 that the DPR armed forces were following Russian\n\ndoctrine7 \"in the apparent absence of their own\".8 In such a case General Brown should\n\nacknowledge that the DPR armed forces were also guided by Russian military doctrines\n\nor USSR regarding the enforcement of IHL rules (e.g. Manual on IHL for the Armed\n\nForces of the Russian Federation).9\n\n13. Ukraine stated that the armed conflict in Ukraine since 2014 is an international armed\n\nconflict. For example, one of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's 2018 statements reads:\n\n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine urges its partners to use all\n\nappropriate means in order to prevent the escalation of the international armed\n\nconflict in the territory of Ukraine...\".10\n\n6 General Brown’s Second Report.\n\n7 By doctrine, Mr Brown means documents on the organisation and conduct of combat operations. In the Russian\n\nFederation, these are regulations, charters, guidelines and instructions.\n\n8 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶22.\n\n9 Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Manual on International Humanitarian Law for the Armed Forces\n\nof the Russian Federation, 8 August 2001, available at:\n\nhttps://docs.cntd ru/document/1300243501?ysclid=le9upv99rh909315846 (Exhibit A).\n\n10 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on the 4th\n\nAnniversary of the Launch of Armed Aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation, 20 February 2018,\n\navailable at: https://uk mfa.gov.ua/en/news/63090-zajava-mzs-ukrajini-do-4-kh-rokovin-pochatku-zbrojnojiAnnex\n\n7\n\nPage 12 out of 29\n\n14. Based on this qualification, the Ukrainian side and its expert should have made a legal\n\nassessment of the hostilities from the perspective of the Geneva Conventions of 12\n\nAugust 1949 and Protocol I.\n\n15. In my view, even assuming that the conflict was not of an international character, such\n\nprovisions of IHL as the Martens Clause, Article 3 common to all the Geneva\n\nConventions of 12 August 1949, and Protocol II applied to it. In addition, customary\n\ninternational law applied to the conflict in question.\n\n16. Under IHL all means of intimidation or of terrorism against the civilian population are\n\nprohibited, as stated, for example, in Article 33 of the Geneva Convention relative to the\n\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949 or in Article 13 of\n\nProtocol II. Importantly, this prohibition refers to acts of violence the primary (main,\n\ninitial) purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population,11 rather than\n\nthe death or injury of civilians in attacks on legitimate military targets. The phrase \"the\n\nprimary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population\" means that\n\nattacks on civilian population and civilian objects are to be carried out with the specific\n\nintent constituting the subjective (mental) element of guilt (mens rea). Even if the actual\n\nresult of the action was fear of the civilian population, this still does not imply the\n\nexistence of appropriate intent:\n\n\"Thus, the requisite mens rea for the crime of terror is the specific intent to\n\nspread terror among the civilian population; actual terrorization is not an\n\nelement of the crime. As said, spreading terror must be the primary purpose\n\nof the acts or threats of violence and should go beyond a mere side-effect of\n\nwar. ‘[T]error which was not intended by a belligerent and terror that is\n\nmerely an incidental effect of acts of warfare which have another primary\n\nobject and are in all other respects lawful’ is not to be seen as spreading\n\nterror'.\"12\n\n17. It should be taken into consideration that even for ordinary war crimes (which do not\n\nrequire a specific intent to intimidate the population, but only an intent to harm civilians)\n\nsignificant harm against civilians may be considered acceptable:\n\n\"Even extensive civilian casualties may be acceptable, if they are not\n\nexcessive in light of the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\n\nagresiji-rf-proti-ukrajini (Exhibit B).\n\n11 IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 12 August 1949, Article\n\n51 (2).\n\n12 G.J. A. Knoops, MENS REA AT THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (Leiden; Boston, 2017), p. 90.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 13 out of 29\n\nThe bombing of an important army or naval installation (like a naval\n\nshipyard) where there are hundreds or even thousands of civilian employees\n\nneed not be abandoned merely because of the risk to those civilians\".13\n\n18. In addition, an important factor is the enemy's use of civilians and civilian objects to\n\nshield its armed forces and military installations, in violation of its obligation to take\n\nprecautions to minimise danger to civilians. In such a case, the attacker's responsibility is\n\ncorrespondingly diminished:\n\n\"Moreover, the responsibility of the attacker for civilian losses can be\n\nmitigated by two factors: the failure of the defenders to clearly separate\n\nmilitary from civilian objects, and the use of civilian facilities for military\n\npurposes. According to IHL, the defending state has an obligation to protect\n\nits own populations from an attack by removing civilians from the vicinity of\n\nmilitary objectives and avoiding the placement of military facilities and\n\npersonnel near populated civilian.\"14\n\n19. This is supported by provisions in military manuals, such as the US Army Commander's\n\nHandbook:\n\n\"A party that is subject to attack might fail to take feasible precautions to\n\nminimize the harm to civilians, such as by separating the civilian population\n\nfrom military objectives. In some cases, a party to the conflict might attempt\n\nto use the presence or movement of the civilian population or individual\n\ncivilians in order to shield military objectives from seizure or attack.... This\n\nenemy conduct, however, will diminish the ability to discriminate [civilian\n\nand military targets] and to reduce the risk of harm to the civilian\n\npopulation.\"15\n\n13 Y.

ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE OBJECT (BUGAS ROADBLOCK)\n\n20. General Brown's Second Report confirmed General Samolenkov's conclusion that the\n\nUAF deployment in the area in question and at the time in question was focal in nature,16\n\nwhich is one of the features of deployment of troops in non-international armed conflicts.\n\nGeneral Brown also concludes that the location and equipment of the Bugas roadblock\n\ndiffered from the purpose, location and equipment of, for example, the combat position\n\nat Berezovoye. Based on this, General Brown concludes that the Bugas roadblock is not\n\na military objective. Apparently, General Brown does not take into account the tactics of\n\nmilitary operations in armed conflicts (as exemplified by actions of the US-led coalition\n\nforces in Iraq). Specifically, in his analysis he ignores purpose of such elements of troops\n\ndeployment: the purpose of such use of temporary armed forces units is, for example,\n\nprevention of unauthorized entry into or exit from an area of combat operations,\n\nprevention of invasion of reconnaissance and sabotage groups into an area of combat\n\noperations. In accordance with the stated purpose, such roadblocks perform, above all,\n\nmilitary functions.\n\n21. For example, U.S. military manuals provide for roadblocks to protect transport corridors,\n\nprotect strongpoints, control the area around the roadblock, interdict enemy movements,\n\ndestroy enemy forces, prohibit enemy forces from contacting the local population, and\n\nmore:\n\n\"Establishing checkpoints is a critical measure in a commander’s overall\n\nprotection efforts… They may be manned by military police or other unit\n\npersonnel. These Soldiers report to the appropriate area movement control\n\norganization when each convoy, march column, and march serial arrives at\n\nand completes passage of their location…\n\nA deliberate checkpoint is a fixed position constructed and employed to\n\nprotect an operating base camp, a well-established MSR, or a main road in a\n\nrural or built-up area. A deliberate checkpoint is typically a preplanned\n\nlocation linked to a larger tactical plan...\n\nDeliberate checkpoints are typically used to...\n\n- Prevent the movement of supplies to the enemy.\n\n- Deny the enemy contact with or prevent insurgents from hiding within the\n\nlocal inhabitants.\n\n16 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶6.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 15 out of 29\n\n- Dominate the area around the checkpoint.\n\nTo operate a checkpoint, task-organize the unit as follows: Assault element.\n\nThis element is responsible for...\n\n- Preparing and occupying fortified fighting positions.\n\n- Eliminating any hostile element that forces its way past the search team,\n\naccording to the ROE.\"17\n\nScheme of a permanent US Army roadblock with fortifications, firing positions\n\nand armoured vehicles18\n\n17 Department of the Army US, Security and Mobility Support.

Since the Ukrainian side did not provide any graphic combat documents or other\n\ndocuments confirming the performance of administrative functions only, the DPR armed\n\nforces reasonably regarded the Bugas roadblock as an element of the UAF deployment\n\nfor conducting the ATO designed to restriction entry into or exit from the area of combat\n\noperations. In view of the aforesaid and based on the provisions of customary\n\ninternational law, applicable in both internal and international armed conflict,19 and\n\nreflected in Article 52 of Protocol I, it is obvious that the Bugas roadblock was a military\n\nfacility in its purpose and use.\n\n23. I agree with General Samolenkov that there was a combat unit, the Kiev-2 battalion, at\n\nthe Bugas roadblock. General Brown's reference to Kiev-2 was a part of the Ukrainian\n\nMinistry of Internal Affairs does not negate the fact that it was a unit equipped with heavy\n\nweapons and carrying out combat tasks in the ATO zone. Since the ATO was led by the\n\nUAF and battalions such as Kiev-2 were placed under the operational military command,\n\nthe Kiev-2 battalion should be recognised as a military unit.\n\n24. I do not agree with General Brown that the personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\n\nand the Border Guard Service of Ukraine allegedly did not have any combat mission.\n\nThese units were, at a minimum, tasked with controlling and restricting the movement of\n\nthe enemy from the combat area (ATO zone). This is precisely a combat mission.\n\n25. General Brown very often refers to the fact that the attack on the Bugas roadblock did not\n\nprovide any military advantage, as \"there were numerous other targets in the area that\n\noffered a military advantage compared to the Bugas roadblock.\"20 However, this approach\n\nonly takes into account a tactical advantage, while attacks on military objectives located\n\ndeep within the lines of UAF deployment in the ATO zone could have been carried out\n\nwith the aim of gaining an operational advantage.\n\nB.

The arguments, put\n\nforward, do not imply an intention to harm or intimidate the civilian population per se.\n\n27. General Brown's conclusions that the attack was carried out with premeditation (with a\n\nspecific intent) are not based on facts and are intended not to reach the objective truth,\n\nbut to prove the Ukrainian side's claim that the attack was premeditated and that its sole\n\npurpose was to intimidate the civilian population. General Brown points out that had the\n\nattack occurred at a different time,\n\n\"if there had been a similar number of vehicles queuing … at the actual time\n\nof the attack, the centre of the barrage … would have been directly over the\n\nline of civilian vehicles.\"22\n\n28. This is what refutes the assumption of a deliberate attack on civilians and confirms the\n\nlack of intent in the attack. If the aim of the DPR was really to intimidate the civilian\n\npopulation, the strike would have taken place at the moment of maximum civilian\n\nconcentration at the roadblock.\n\n29. The intercept evidence23 indicates that DPR fighters tried to avoid civilian casualties,\n\nwhich indirectly confirms the implementation by the DPR armed forces of Russian\n\nmilitary doctrines regarding the enforcement of IHL.\n\n30. Taking into account the earlier findings, there arises an acute issue of precautions against\n\nconsequences of the attack, which the Ukrainian side could and should have taken in\n\naccordance with the provisions of IHL as reflected in Article 58 of Protocol I, and even\n\non general precautions under customary law applicable in an internal armed conflict,24\n\nbut failed to take. Specifically:\n\n(a) Ukraine and General Brown refer to the Bugas roadblock as a civilian roadblock.25\n\nIn such a case, the issue of concern is the location of the said roadblock within the\n\n21 IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 12 August 1949, Article\n\n51 (2).\n\n22 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶14.\n\n23 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶12.\n\n24 J.M.

ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE OBJECTS\n\n31. General Brown's position regarding the analysis of the situation and the likely tactics of\n\nthe opposing forces is surprising.29 In particular, General Brown argues that an attack on\n\nthe defence positions of the Ukrainian forces was inadvisable because according to Soviet\n\nand Russian doctrines30 the city (i.e. Mariupol) should be besieged. Unfortunately,\n\nGeneral Brown demonstrated insufficient knowledge of the guidelines governing the\n\npreparation and conduct of combat operations specifically by the Soviet and (or) Russian\n\narmed forces, which unequivocally require the capture of populated places by an attack\n\non the march (after advance from depth) or by assault, which requires the advancing\n\ntroops to reliably hit military facilities throughout the depth of the enemy's forces\n\ndeployment:\n\n\"279. The capture of a populated area is usually carried out from the march.\n\nThe battalion (company), operating in the direction of a populated area, while\n\nadvancing from the depth destroys the enemy defending on the approaches to\n\nit, breaks into the populated area, and relentlessly develops the attack in\n\ndepth. If it is not possible to capture a populated area on the march, the senior\n\ncommander arranges for it to be surrounded (blockaded) and taken by assault\n\nafter comprehensive preparation.\"\n\n\"288. Prior to assault of an object, it is engaged by all fire weapons of the\n\nassault squad. The assault squad (group) at this time takes up an initial\n\nposition as close to the object of attack as possible and, at the established time,\n\nproceeds to attack.\n\nFire weapons of the fire support group (subgroups) destroy the enemy in the\n\nattacked and adjacent objects, and the assault groups (capturing subgroups),\n\nusing breaches in walls, underground communications, passageways,\n\nentrances, building ledges, move to the object and at the preset time under the\n\ncover of fire of all means and aerosol screens burst into the object.\"31\n\n32. On the basis of Figures 12, 13 and 15 in General Brown’s Second Report, it can be\n\nconcluded that Mariupol had been prepared for defence. In any event, a system of lines\n\nof defence, defence positions and artificial obstacles had been established on the outskirts\n\n29 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶¶20-25.\n\n30 As I pointed out above, by doctrines General Brown means documents on the organisation and conduct of\n\ncombat operations. In the Russian Federation these are manuals, charters, guidelines and instructions.\n\n31 Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Combat Manual on Preparation and Conduct of Combined-Arms\n\nMilitary Combat.

In\n\nparticular, there were a number of equipped defence positions and facilities in close\n\nproximity to the city, such as roadblock 4014, and a line of defence along the eastern\n\nedge. From the IHL perspective, both of the above-mentioned object were military:\n\nroadblock No. 4014 in nature, purpose and use, and the defence positions (line of defence)\n\nalong the eastern edge in nature and purpose (the absence of manpower, weapons and\n\nmilitary equipment on the line is not a reason not to consider this object as non-military).\n\nSpeaking of the roadblock and the line of defence, it should be noted that General Brown's\n\nconclusions (e.g. regarding the roadblock) that \"any military advantage from neutralizing\n\nthe checkpoint would only accrue if followed up immediately by a ground assault\"32 are\n\nincorrect, especially with regard to the obligatory condition concerning a subsequent\n\nground assault. It is necessary to remind General Brown that during Operation Allied\n\nForce in Kosovo (March to June 1999) NATO did not plan to use ground forces at all\n\n(planned no offensive actions), but relied only on the use of long-range weapons. The\n\nsame can be said of the operations in Iraq, where the use of ground forces was preceded\n\nby long phases of hitting the entire depth of the enemy troops (forces) with all available\n\nmeans.\n\nB. ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE\n\n33. IHL does not contain mandatory rules prohibiting the use of settlements in military\n\noperations. However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (hereinafter, ICRC),\n\nfor example, identified a number of serious humanitarian problems arising in the conduct\n\nof military operations in such situation and prepared relevant recommendations,33 which\n\nare well known to the UAF leadership.\n\n34. Since it is clear that the Ukrainian military command decided to use Mariupol to ensure\n\nthe sustainability of the defence, which gave the Ukrainian side additional advantages,\n\nthe precautions against attacks when establishing defences must be taken into account\n\nwhile considering the attack. Based on the data presented, it can be concluded that:\n\n32 General Brown’s First Report, ¶49.\n\n33 ICRC, REDUCING CIVILIAN HARM IN URBAN WARFARE: A COMMANDER’S HANDBOOK (2021), available at:\n\nhttps://shop.icrc.org/reducing-civilian-harm-in-urban-warfare-a-commander-s-handbook.html.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 21 out of 29\n\n(a) The UAF military command decided to establish defensive positions and lines in\n\nthe immediate vicinity of urban areas, which does not comply with the provisions\n\nof Article 58 (b) of Protocol I or common precautions under customary law\n\noperating in an internal armed conflict;34\n\n(b) The UAF military command, having located military facilities in close proximity\n\nto urban areas, failed to take measures to evacuate civilians35 from the range of the\n\nenemy's primary weapons.\n\n35. It must be borne in mind that urban combat is an extremely intense type of combat, where\n\nit is particularly difficult to avoid damage to civilian objects, even when using high-tech,\n\nhigh-precision weapons. This is confirmed by manuals of the armed forces:\n\n\"The density of civilian populations in urban areas and the multidimensional\n\nnature of the environment make it more likely that even accurate attacks with\n\nprecision weapons will injure noncombatants.\"36\n\n36. It also seems difficult to agree with General Brown's view that the capture of a city must\n\nnecessarily imply the preservation of its infrastructure and industrial capacity.37 If the\n\nobjective is to crush fierce resistance and destroy the enemy's defending forces, an \"upper\n\nlimit\" on the applicable force is extremely difficult to establish:\n\n\"The desired end state for the urban area dictates the level of force used. For\n\nexample if the desired end state is to retain the city as a viable commercial\n\nentity (terrain control focus), the sufficient level of force used must be limited\n\nand collateral damage must not destroy the population, commercial\n\ninfrastructure, or essential processes of the city. Urban operations normally\n\nbenefit from a balance between extremes of force levels used in this example.\n\nConversely, and with respect to laws of armed conflict in necessity,\n\ndistinction, and proportionality, if the end state is to destroy all enemies who\n\n34 J.M.

Given that fortified areas and positions had been established on the approaches to\n\nMariupol which were part of a system of defence positions system, lines and areas in the\n\nMariupol direction and, therefore, legitimate objectives for attacks, the evidence of an\n\nintentional attack on civilian objects that is based on radio intercepts alone is\n\nquestionable. That said, it is necessary to take a closer look at the intercepts.39 In\n\nparticular, the Ukrainian side states the following: at 10:38 a.m. on the day of the shelling,\n\nKirsanov called Sergey Ponomarenko, a member of the DPR, to report on the damage,\n\nsaying that Vostochny has been seriously damaged.40\n\n38. Considering this intercepted dialogue, it is also possible to draw a conclusion different\n\nfrom that of Ukraine, for instance, that the attacking party regrets missing a military\n\nobjective. Moreover, the intercepted conversations between Valery Kirsanov and O.\n\nYevdoty (\"Pepel\"), provided by Ukraine and cited by the Russian side in the Counter-\n\nMemorial (ICSFT),41 create doubts regarding the Ukrainian position and confirm that the\n\nattack was not deliberately directed at the Vostochny neighbourhood.\n\n38 US Department of the Army, US Department of the Navy, Urban Operations.

ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE OBJECTS\n\n39. Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides42 agree that the Kramatorsk airfield was a military\n\nobjective (in the context of Article 52 of Protocol I). Furthermore, from a military point\n\nof view, the key aspect was that the UAF's ATO headquarters had been deployed at the\n\nairfield, which made it a particularly important military objective whose destruction could\n\naffect the success of all military operations conducted by the DPR armed forces (i.e. it\n\ncould create an undeniable military advantage, because disabling elements of the enemy's\n\ncontrol system is a primary (top priority) objective of modern-day military operations).\n\nThis has a significant impact on the assessment of collateral damage.\n\n40. The Russian and Ukrainian sides also agree that the BM-30 Smerch MLRS, armed with\n\ncluster munitions, is a suitable weapon to engage this military target. As General Brown\n\npoints out:\n\n\"…BM-30 is not just the only weapon available, it is also the ideal weapon\n\nfor neutralization of an airfield and its associated infrastructure,\n\naccompanying units, tented accommodation and soft-skinned vehicles. BM-\n\n30 firing 9M55K sub-munition missiles is optimized to defeat personnel,\n\narmoured and soft targets in concentration areas, artillery batteries, command\n\nposts and ammunition depots.\"43\n\nB. ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE\n\n41. It is an undisputed fact that the ATO command made a decision to place on the approaches\n\nto the city a military object the destruction or neutralization of which would give the DPR\n\narmed forces an undeniable military advantage.44\n\n42. From an IHL perspective, it is obvious that Ukraine failed to take precautionary measures\n\nagainst the effects of attacks, as described in IHL,45 including in Article 58 of Protocol I.\n\nIn particular, it failed to meet:\n\n42 General Brown’s First Report ¶66; Written Statement by Denis Goiko, Record of Interrogation of the Victim,\n\n20 August 2015, Memorial, Annex 239; Written Statement by Alexander Bondaruk, Record of Interrogation of\n\nthe Victim, 20 August 2015, Memorial, Annex 240.\n\n43 General Brown’s First Report, ¶68.\n\n44 General Brown’s Second Report, Figure 18; Memorial, ¶102, Map 5.\n\n45 J.M.

General Brown himself qualifies his conclusions about a premeditated attack on civilian\n\nobjects46 as most plausible only, not proven. The statement that it is not dissimilar to the\n\nevidence emerging from the current war in Ukraine of liberal Russian military use of\n\nrockets and cluster munitions is unsubstantiated and does not bring him any closer to\n\nachieving the goal of being objective in his expert assessment – all the more so in view\n\nof General Brown's view that cluster munitions are the \"ideal\" weapon to hit a military\n\ntarget such as a headquarters and an airfield.47 Moreover, by acknowledging the\n\ntechnological sophistication of the BM30 Smerch 9M55K munition, General Brown\n\nhimself indirectly admits that the use of such munition imposes stringent requirements on\n\nthe qualifications of BM30 crews, including during pre-launch checkouts and test firing.48\n\nTherefore, given General Samolenkov's conclusions concerning malfunction or failure of\n\nthe on-board range adjustment equipment49 and the assumption of insufficient\n\ncompetence of BM30 crew(s), it would also be plausible to assume, in the General’s\n\nBrown terminology, that the attack on civilians and civilian objects was unintentional.\n\navailable at: https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrceng.\n\npdf.\n\n46 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶48.\n\n47 General Brown’s First Report, ¶68.\n\n48 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶45.\n\n49 General Brown’s Second Report, ¶44.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 25 out of 29\n\nVII. SHELLINGS OF AVDEYEVKA FROM JANUARY TO MARCH 2017\n\nA. ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE OBJECTS\n\n44. The materials of Memorial50 and General Brown's first expert report (hereinafter, General\n\nBrown’s First Report)51 suggest that Avdeyevka was incorporated into the system of the\n\nUAF defence positions, lines and areas. In particular, General Brown points out with\n\nreference to the International Partnership for Human Rights' report that the main\n\ndefensive positions of the UAF were established on the southwestern outskirts of\n\nAvdeyevka to ensure \"protection against any attack by the DPR\". However, neither the\n\nUkrainian side nor General Brown take into account that the defence is not linear, i.e. any\n\ndefence area or position has not only front but also depth.\n\n45. So, for example, the defence area of a battalion tactical group can be from 2.5 to 5\n\nkilometres deep. The UAF could have established strongpoints, firing and cutting-off\n\npositions and other elements of the defence structure to this depth. This is evidenced by\n\nthe location of military objects on Map 6,52 such as a roadblock, locations of ammunition\n\nstockpiles and military vehicles, positions of personnel, firing positions and UAF quarters\n\nin the town. Further, the location of the UAF53 artillery firing position near the lake to the\n\nnorth of the town allows for a conclusion that the entire Avdeyevka was included in the\n\nsystem of defence positions and lines. The later extensive use of civilian infrastructure\n\nobjects (including industrial enterprises) by the UAF in the course of combat operations\n\nin 2022 and 2023 (e.g. in Mariupol) also may indicate that defence positions and defences\n\nnot shown on Map 6 could have been established directly within the populated area. Thus,\n\nthe existing UAF positions on the approaches to the town and within the town itself and\n\nlikely military objects were legitimate objectives for attack.\n\nB. ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE\n\n46. The inclusion of Avdeyevka in the system of defence areas, positions and lines and\n\npreparing Avdeyevka for defence may indicate that civilian deaths (injuries) and damage\n\n50 Memorial, p. 70, Map 6 \"Shelling Impacts in Avdeyevka\".\n\n51 General Brown’s First Report, ¶¶83-84.\n\n52 Memorial, p. 70, Map 6 \"Shelling Impacts in Avdeyevka\".\n\n53 General Brown’s First Report, ¶83.\n\nAnnex 7\n\nPage 26 out of 29\n\nto civilian objects could have been consequences of attacks on legitimate military\n\nobjectives and the consequence of ineffective precautions against attacks, including\n\nbecause civilians were not evacuated from the defence area and remained within the range\n\nof all enemy weapons (from heavy machine guns to BM21 MLRS54) as described in\n\nIHL,55 including in Article 58 of Protocol I.\n\n47. It cannot be established whether other precautions were taken to protect the civilian\n\npopulation, individual civilians and civilian objects under UAF control against the\n\ndangers resulting from military operations as prescribed by IHL rules, including Article\n\n58 (c) of Protocol I, e.g. whether civilians were able to take shelter from attacks.\n\n48. Given the absence of UAF combat control documents in the case file, it is impossible to\n\ndetermine the extent to which the Ukrainian side avoided locating military objectives\n\nwithin or near densely populated areas as prescribed by IHL rules,56 including Article\n\n58(b) of Protocol I. The lack of precautions and the version that the attacks were carried\n\nout on military objectives are also supported by General Brown's statement that\n\n\"delineation between UAF and civilian activity is more blurred\". He cites as evidence the\n\nwords of the commander of the UAF's 72nd Brigade, responsible for the defence of\n\nAvdeyevka, who confirms that the UAF used civilian objects for military purposes while\n\norganising the defence.57 This confirms my conclusion that Avdeyevka was included in\n\nthe system of UAF's defence positions. It is important to note that a military commander\n\nwas responsible for the defence of Avdeyevka (!), but not for the defence on its\n\napproaches, which supports the version that the entire Avdeyevka was included in the\n\nsystem of UAF's defence positions.\n\n49. Any allegations of deliberate attacks on the civilian population and civilian objects in\n\nAvdeyevka are not supported by evidence of intentional strikes.

This suggests that the DPR armed forces avoided attacking protected\n\npersons and objects (the Central Hospital, as a medical facility, was probably marked with\n\nthe protective emblem of the Red Cross). Moreover, there arises the following issue for\n\nwhat reason was the civilian population of Avdeyevka not evacuated? Perhaps the civilian\n\npopulation was used by the UAF as a \"human shield\", which is a serious violation of IHL.\n\n50. Moreover, the version that intentional attacks on civilian objects were carried out in order\n\nto cause fear among civilians58 is totally unsubstantiated. Furthermore, the very presence\n\nof civilians in Avdeyevka, who had not been evacuated by the Ukrainian authorities from\n\nthe dangerous area, as prescribed by IHL rules,59 including Article 58 (a) of Protocol I,\n\ncaused fear among the civilian population.\n\n58 See Memorial, ¶113.\n\n59 J.M.

They form the basis for the development of tactical modes\n\nand methods of operations in each particular case.\n\nWith the issuance of this manual, the Combat Manual of the Ground Forces, Part\n\n2 (Battalion, Company), enacted by Order No. 50 of 1989 of the Commander-in-Chief of\n\nthe Ground Forces, shall cease to have effect.\n\n[…]\n\nP. 247\n\n278. Battalion support and logistics units, as well as motor vehicles of\n\nmotorised infantry units, cross a stream using tactical stream-crossing equipment, ferries\n\nand bridges following artillery units.\n\nTransportation of the wounded and sick to their own shore is carried out using the\n\ntactical stream-crossing equipment returning after disembarkation of units, or if\n\nnecessary, by specially allocated means of crossing.\n\n6. CAPTURE OF A RESIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT\n\n279. The capture of a populated area is usually carried out from the march. The\n\nbattalion (company), operating in the direction of a populated area, while advancing from\n\nthe depth destroys the enemy defending on the approaches to it, breaks into the populated\n\narea, and relentlessly develops the attack in depth. If it is not possible to capture a\n\npopulated area on the march, the senior commander arranges for it to be surrounded\n\n(blockaded) and taken by assault after comprehensive preparation.\n\n280. Inside the residential settlement, the battalion usually advances as part of\n\na brigade (regiment) along one or two main streets and adjacent residential blocks with a\n\nfront line of up to 1 km. A company advances along one street or within a block.\n\nThe combat mission of a battalion (company) in an offensive in a residential\n\nsettlement may\n\nAnnex 7 Exhibit C\n\nP. 248\n\nbe smaller in depth than under normal conditions. When storming a settlement, the immediate\n\nobjective of a battalion is to capture a stronghold or two, or sometimes two or three blocks,\n\nwhile the longer-range goal is to capture important targets (blocks) deep in the enemy's\n\ndefences.\n\nThe company's immediate objective is to capture a building (part of a large building or\n\nseveral small buildings) in the enemy’s stronghold.\n\nWhen attacking in a residential settlement, the largest part of the grenade launcher and\n\nanti-tank platoons (company anti-tank squad), mortar battery, artillery battalion (battery), tanks\n\nand flamethrower units are assigned to companies (platoons).\n\nBattalion (company) combat formation in a residential settlement is usually formed in\n\ntwo echelons. In order to capture large structures or important facilities of the settlement, a\n\nspecial assault group composed of up to one reinforced motorized infantry company may be\n\nformed at the battalion's level of command, provided there are sufficient forces and equipment\n\navailable.\n\n281. The battalion commander examines the residential settlement and the peculiarities of\n\nthe enemy's defences in advance using a large-scale map (plan, photographs), and organises\n\nreconnaissance.\n\nWhen taking decisions for an offensive in a settlement, the battalion (company)\n\ncommander, apart from the usual issues, determines the most important areas and objects\n\n(buildings) which\n\nP. 249\n\nmust be taken in the first instance, the composition of the assault team, and the methods of\n\nstriking the enemy with firearms taking into account the particular construction of buildings,\n\nstructures, and other objects.\n\nWhen assigning combat tasks to the elements of the combat order (units), in addition to\n\nthe usual issues, the following shall be specified:\n\nfor the first echelon units - the objects to be taken first; the objects to be secured under\n\nthe threat of enemy counterattacks and actions of his forces remaining in the rear;\n\nfor the second echelon (general reserve) units - the procedure for clearing the enemy and\n\nsecuring captured buildings (objects) and covering the flanks, the elimination of the enemy\n\nremaining in the rear of the first echelon units, allocated forces;\n\nfor the artillery units (units) – allocation of guns to the assault team, tasks for the\n\ndestruction of buildings, stone fences and barricades.\n\nThe battalion commander, when assigning combat tasks to the assault team, indicates:\n\nreinforcement means and procedure for their reassignment; object of attack; directions for\n\nAnnex 7 Exhibit C\n\nconcentrating the main efforts by stage in the assault of the object; tasks to be carried out\n\nby the first and second echelon units and by senior commanders in the interests of the\n\nassault team; time of readiness. In addition, the following\n\nP. 250\n\nmay be specified: routes of advancement to the object of attack and starting position for the\n\nassault; procedure for the use of units, forces and equipment attached to the assault team.\n\nWhen organising interaction, the battalion commander most carefully coordinates\n\nthe actions of the first and second echelon units, artillery, and the assault group.\n\n282. As units approach a residential settlement, artillery suppresses and\n\ndestroys the enemy in strongholds simultaneously on the approaches to it and on its\n\noutskirts. As the units reach the outskirts of the residential settlement, artillery shifts fire\n\nonto buildings and other structures in the interior of the strongholds and prevents the\n\napproach of enemy reserves to the attacked objects.\n\nThe battalion (company), using gaps and weakly occupied areas in the enemy\n\ndefences, as well as the results of fire, advancing from deep into the settlement and\n\nmoving along the streets, systematically captures the buildings and blocks (important\n\nobjects).\n\nTanks and flamethrower operators usually operate in the battle formation of\n\nmotorised infantry units or behind them, and with their fire destroy the enemy first of all\n\nin basements, lower floors of buildings and other shelters. Armoured infantry fighting\n\nvehicles (armoured personnel carriers), following the tanks, move from cover to cover,\n\nP. 251\n\ndestroy the enemy obstructing the tanks and their units by firing guns and machine guns.\n\nThe battalion (company) commander may allocate observation posts to cover the\n\nflanks and repel enemy counterattacks, as well as to block certain fortified buildings,\n\nwhile the main forces continue to develop the offensive.\n\n283. Battalion support and logistics units are normally deployed outside the\n\nresidential settlement or on its outskirts. Means for the evacuation and repair of weapons\n\nand military equipment, vehicles with the necessary quantity of missiles, ammunition and\n\nfuel, as well as the battalion medical unit move into the settlement. A technical\n\nobservation post is deployed in the streets as close as possible to the advancing\n\ncompanies of the first echelon. To search and evacuate the wounded, stretcher-bearer\n\ngroups are formed besides the regular forces and equipment.\n\n284. When capturing a residential settlement by storm, a battalion (company) may\n\nbe assigned to act in an assault unit. The assault unit is reinforced with tanks, guns,\n\nmortars, anti-tank guided systems, grenade launchers, flamethrowers, as well as by\n\nengineering troops and radiation, chemical and biological defence troops, and is supplied\n\nAnnex 7 Exhibit C\n\nwith explosive charges and aerosol and flame-igniting agents.\n\nP. 252\n\nForward air controllers may be included in the command structure of assault troops.\n\nThe combat order of an assault unit usually includes two or three assault groups, a\n\nreserve group, a cover group, a fire support group, and a breaching group. A demolition group\n\nmay also be assigned to demolish particularly strong objects (buildings).\n\nThe purpose of an assault group is to capture an object of attack or a part of it. It is\n\nusually formed as part of a reinforced motorised rifle company (platoon).\n\nThe reserve is intended to reinforce the assault or covering groups, to develop success,\n\nand to carry out other tasks that may suddenly arise. An assault unit may have a reserve of up to\n\none platoon.\n\nA cover group is intended to consolidate a captured object and cover the flanks and rear\n\nof the assault unit. Up to a company may be assigned to it.\n\nThe purpose of the fire support group is to support the actions of assault groups with fire.\n\nIt may include artillery, tank, anti-aircraft units, grenade launchers, machine gunners, snipers and\n\nflamethrower operators.\n\nThe breaching group’s objective is to make passages through barriers in front of the\n\nenemy defence line, undermine the walls of the attacked object, demine it, and carry out other\n\ntasks.\n\nP. 253\n\nIt comprises attached engineering and sapper units.\n\nThe combat order of an assault group may include capture, control, and fire support\n\nsubgroups. The capture subgroup is formed on the basis of a motorised rifle platoon (squad) and\n\nis designed to destroy the enemy in the object of the attack and capture it. It may comprise\n\nflamethrower operators.\n\nThe control and fire support subgroup comprising infantry fighting vehicles (armoured\n\npersonnel carriers), tanks, guns, mortars, grenade launchers, anti-tank and flamethrower units is\n\ndesigned to control the actions of the capturing subgroups and to deliver fire against the enemy\n\nfirepower and manpower covering the attack object and those located inside it.\n\n285. The commander of an assault unit (group) carefully examines the nature of the\n\nenemy defence, especially the system of fire and the possibility of flanking the unit with fire\n\nfrom adjacent buildings, the most convenient approaches, the presence and nature of obstacles,\n\ndevelops a plan, makes a decision, assigns combat tasks and organises interaction.\n\nThe blueprint for the stages of the mission determines: areas of concentration of the main\n\nforces; forms and methods of the mission performance (the order and methods of closing in on\n\nAnnex 7 Exhibit C\n\nthe enemy, overcoming\n\nP. 254\n\nobstacles and fences, capturing and securing the attack object, with indication of the procedure\n\nfor disabling the enemy on the approaches to and inside the object, and preventing the enemy\n\nfrom breaking through to it from other directions, including by way of underground\n\ncommunication routes); the distribution of forces and means (formation of a fighting order); and\n\nthe ensuring of secrecy and stealth in preparation for and during combat.\n\n286. When assigning combat tasks, the commander of the assault unit (group)\n\ngives directions:\n\nto the assault group (capture subgroup) – on reinforcement means and order of\n\ntheir reassignment; object of attack; directions of concentration of main efforts by stages\n\nof action; tasks carried out by cover, fire support and breaching group by means of the\n\nsenior commander; time of readiness. In addition, the following may be specified: routes\n\nof advance to the object of attack and starting position for the assault;\n\nto reserve – on composition; starting position; possible tasks to be prepared for;\n\ntime of readiness;\n\nto cover group – on composition; tasks for securing the captured object and\n\npreventing enemy reserves from breaking through to it, including using underground\n\ncommunications; starting position; time of readiness;\n\nto the fire support group (subgroup) – on composition; tasks to support the actions\n\nof assault\n\nP. 255\n\ngroups (capturing subgroups), covering and breaching groups; initial position and locations of\n\nfiring positions (firing lines); time of readiness;\n\nto the breaching group – on composition; locations and time of ensuring passages\n\nthrough barriers in front of the attacked object; tasks to undermine its walls (structural\n\nelements) and demining; initial position; time of readiness.\n\n287. In organising interaction, the battalion (company) commander coordinates:\n\nthe procedure for units to reach the attacked object, including the use of concealed\n\napproaches and underground communications; the actions of the units upon assaulting\n\n(storming) the object and during combat inside of it; the procedure for interaction with\n\nneighbours and measures to prevent enemy reserves from approaching and\n\ncounterattacking; provisioning of flanking assault groups (capture subgroups); the\n\nprocedure for countering enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the rear of the\n\nunits; ways to identify one's own troops in the attack and signals to designate one’s\n\nposition inside the attacked object, and other issues.\n\nAnnex 7 Exhibit C\n\n288. Prior to assault of an object, it is engaged by all fire weapons of the assault squad.\n\nThe assault squad (group) at this time takes up an initial position as close to the object of attack\n\nas possible and, at the established time, proceeds to attack.\n\nFire weapons of the fire support group (subgroups) destroy the enemy in the attacked and\n\nadjacent objects, and the assault\n\nP. 256\n\ngroups (capturing subgroups), using breaches in walls, underground communications,\n\npassageways, entrances, building ledges, move to the object and at the preset time under the\n\ncover of fire of all means and aerosol screens burst into the object. The attack is carried out\n\nswiftly, using hand grenades on firing points, manpower and through windows inside the\n\nbuildings.\n\nOnce inside the building, the assault teams (capture subgroups) seize stairwells,\n\nplatforms, and get a foothold on them, clearing the adjoining rooms of the enemy, seeking to\n\ndisengage the enemy forces and deprive their units of the ability to communicate with each other\n\nand help each other.\n\nFire support is provided until the motorised infantry units penetrate the object of the\n\nattack, and then the fire is transferred to other objects in order to isolate the attacked object.\n\nCombat in a large building breaks up into separate disjointed battles on the floors.\n\nEngineering units that are part of the assault unit make passages in the walls and\n\ninterfloor ceilings, and, if necessary, demine captured buildings.\n\nOnce the battalion (company) has captured a building or neighbourhood, it continues to\n\nfight for other buildings and blocks and fulfils the assigned mission. Individual pockets of\n\nresistance and small groups of the enemy are destroyed by the\n\nP. 257\n\ncovering team and reserves. Particularly strong, long-term firing structures are blocked and\n\nblown up along with the garrisons defending them. Captured important buildings and crossroads\n\nare secured by a cover group. Exits from underground communications are guarded or destroyed.\n\nAnnex 8\n\nSecond Expert Report of Valery Alexeyevich Samolenkov, 10 March 2023\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 8\n\nINTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE\n\nAPPLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE\n\nSUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND\n\nOF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF\n\nALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION\n\n(UKRAINE V.

I, Valery Alexeyevich Samolenkov, previously prepared an expert report analysing the\n\ncircumstances of the following instances: (1) shelling of the Bugas roadblock on 13\n\nJanuary 2015; (2) shelling on the outskirts of Mariupol on 24 January 2015; (3) shelling\n\nin Kramatorsk on 10 February 2015; (4) several shellings in the frontline town of\n\nAvdeyevka from January 2017 to March 2017. I was also previously asked to assess the\n\nconclusions about the goals of the above shellings reached by Lieutenant General\n\nChristopher Brown (\"General Brown\") in his expert report dated 5 June 2018 (\"First\n\nBrown Report\").1\n\n2. My expert report of 8 August 2021 was submitted to the International Court of Justice in\n\nthe case before ICJ, \"Application of the International Convention for the Suppression of\n\nthe Financing of Terrorism and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All\n\nForms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)\" (hereinafter the \"First\n\nReport\").2\n\n3. My qualifications and experience are described in the First Report.\n\nQUESTIONS PUT TO THE EXPERT\n\n4. I have been asked to review General Brown's second expert report dated 21 April 2022\n\n(hereinafter also referred to as \"Second Brown Report\").3 In addition, I was asked to\n\nreview the expert report of Ms. Catherine Gwilliam and Air Vice-Marshal Anthony Sean\n\nCorbett dated 20 April 2022 (hereinafter also referred to as the “Gwilliam and Corbett\n\nReport”),4 so far as it relates to my First Report and the analysis of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the firings in question.\n\n5. I have been provided with a copy of the second expert report of Colonel A. A. Bobkov\n\ndated 10 March 2023 (hereinafter the \"Second Bobkov Report\"). I will also make\n\n1 Memorial, Annex 11.\n\n2 Counter-Memorial (ICSFT), Annex 2.\n\n3 Reply, Annex 1.\n\n4 Reply, Annex 2.\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 6 out of 141\n\nreferences to the first expert report of Colonel A. A. Bobkov dated 8 August 2021\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"First Bobkov Report\").5 Also I continue to base my\n\nresearch on the files, provided to the Court by the Ukraine itself or which are available\n\nthrough open sources.\n\n5 Counter-Memorial (ICSFT), Annex 1.\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 7 out of 141\n\nSUMMARY\n\n6. In the course of my analysis I came to the following conclusions.\n\n7. I do not support the infliction of harm to the civilian population and civilian objects by\n\nmilitary operations. However, I disagree with the claims that in the instances in question\n\nthe infliction of harm to civilian objects was a deliberate tactic of the DPR and that the\n\nattacks were indiscriminate.\n\n8. In this report I provide numerous examples of collateral damage caused by military\n\nactions of Ukraine and NATO member states and their allies. I condemn such actions.\n\nNevertheless, these examples show that:\n\n(a) Unfortunately, collateral damage is a very common (almost unavoidable)\n\nconsequence of warfare;\n\n(b) The mere existence of collateral damage is insufficient to establish that the strikes\n\nwere indiscriminate and/or intentional.\n\n9. Conclusions regarding the shelling of the Bugas roadblock:\n\n(a) The main cause of the collateral damage resulting from the shelling was that\n\nUkraine organised searches of civilians and vehicles on the territory of a military\n\nobject.\n\n(b) The choice of weaponry (BM-21 Grad) does not in itself imply the indiscriminate\n\nnature of the attack. Had any other type of artillery been used, the risk of collateral\n\ndamage would have remained due to Ukraine's failure to separate the functions of\n\na military facility from the functions of a civilian checkpoint. The bus that was on\n\nthe territory of the Bugas roadblock at the time of the shelling could have been hit\n\nby a shell fired at the roadblock from any type of artillery.\n\n(c) Ukraine submitted evidence that the missiles that hit the Bugas roadblock had\n\nspoiler rings, which General Brown fails to take into account. This refutes General\n\nBrown's theory that shelling took place from DPR-controlled positions.\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 8 out of 141\n\n(d) The correct calculation of the firing distance based on both the analysis of the\n\ncraters and the angle of descent of shell fragments proves that the shelling was\n\ncarried out from positions controlled by the UAF.\n\n(e) The data I have studied indicates that the Bugas roadblock was hit by UAF artillery\n\nfire.\n\n(f) The intercepts confirm that the DPR's tactics included the taking of measures to\n\navoid damage to civilian objects. This refutes allegations of a deliberate attack on\n\ncivilians. General Brown raises no objections against my analysis of the intercepts,\n\nbut merely points out that the intercepts do not, in his view, directly relate to the\n\nshelling of the Bugas roadblock.\n\n(g) If one was to assume that the roadblock was shelled by the DPR after all (which I\n\nbelieve to be wrong), such shelling could have been carried out in order to neutralize\n\nan enemy military facility located within the lines of the UAF troops deployment\n\nin Volnovakha – Dokuchayevsk direction.\n\n(h) The Bugas roadblock was regarded by Ukraine itself as a military object, which is\n\nconfirmed by SBU documents submitted by Ukraine in these proceedings and by\n\nUkrainian regulatory acts.\n\n(i) There were units of armed personnel and armoured vehicles at the Bugas roadblock.\n\nThe roadblock was equipped with firing positions and trenches for personnel and\n\nequipment and could hold all-round defence.\n\n(j) The roadblock performed military tasks on an important route, which played a\n\ncritical role in supplying Ukrainian positions in the vicinity of Dokuchayevsk.\n\n(k) Shelling in the middle of the day is not indicative of an intention to harm civilians,\n\nas queues of civilian vehicles were forming near the Bugas roadblock during the\n\nnight. If the shelling had been at night time rather than in the middle of the day, it\n\nwould have resulted in more casualties.\n\n(l) General Brown misjudged the firing range and the location of the firing position by\n\nusing incorrect and unverified data. He uncritically relies on the SBU's analysis of\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 9 out of 141\n\nthe craters. His own analysis is contradictory and does not support his conclusion\n\nthat the shelling was carried out from a distance of “19.4-19.8 km”.\n\n10. Conclusions regarding shelling on the outskirts of Mariupol on 24 January 2015:\n\n(a) The very location of UAF military positions in close proximity to residential areas,\n\ncombined with the fact that the population had not been evacuated from nearby\n\nareas, was the principal condition for the occurrence of collateral damage. When\n\ncombat activity takes place in close proximity to residential areas from which\n\ncivilians have not been evacuated, collateral damage is almost inevitable. The\n\nwarfare practice of NATO member states in modern history confirms this.\n\n(b) The available evidence suggests that the attack on the residential area of Mariupol\n\nwas the result of an honest and reasonable mistake and that the real purpose of the\n\nattack was to engage military facilities and achieve the overall military goal of\n\ncreating conditions for capturing the city.\n\n(c) The documents provided by Ukraine itself (testimonies obtained by SBU and\n\nintercepts) and other Ukrainian sources (Ukrainian court judgments, statements by\n\nthe Ukrainian prosecutor's office, reports of Ukrainian media) confirm that the DPR\n\nintended to engage the UAF's defensive positions on the outskirts of the city, and\n\nthe hitting of residential areas was the result of Kirsanov providing knowingly\n\nincorrect target coordinates.\n\n(d) The shelling of UAF's positions on the outskirts of the city was justified from a\n\nmilitary point of view, as it was carried out to support the announced offensive\n\noperation to capture Mariupol.\n\n(e) The purpose of the shelling could have been to strengthen DPR's positions or to\n\ngain a better position for subsequent actions around the city. The shelling of targets\n\nin this area made military sense not only in the principal lines of military operations,\n\nbut also in other lines of operations. The shelling could also have been part of\n\nexchange of fire.\n\n(f) I have no reason to believe that the DPR had cannon artillery available to shell\n\nUAF's positions on the outskirts of Mariupol. The Second Bobkov Report refutes\n\nthe conclusion of Ukrainian experts that D-30 howitzers can be seen on the satellite\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 10 out of 141\n\nimagery of DPR's positions in this area. In any case, the choice in favour of MLRS\n\ncould have been made based on military necessity and expediency, since MLRS\n\nhave advantages over cannon artillery and/or could have been the only available\n\nmeans of engagement at the relevant time.\n\n(g) The mere choice of MLRS as a means of attack does not in itself imply the\n\nindiscriminate nature of the shelling, as MLRSs are not inherently indiscriminate\n\nweapons.\n\n(h) As NATO’s warfare experience shows, even the use of highest precision weapons\n\ninevitably results in civilian casualties, especially when used in urban areas.\n\n11. Conclusions regarding the shelling of Avdeyevka in January-March 2017:\n\n(a) UAF members had taken up positions in the residential area of Avdeyevka and used\n\ncivilian buildings in Avdeyevka for military purposes, as confirmed by General\n\nBrown. There is ample evidence that the UAF pursued a tactic of placing tanks and\n\nother military objects in residential neighbourhoods of Avdeyevka (in particular,\n\nfor attacks on Donetsk). This was the principal condition for the occurrence of\n\ncollateral damage during the intensified hostilities in this area of combat operations.\n\n(b) The shellings were aimed exclusively at military targets and were justified by the\n\nneed to engage enemy firing positions, defensive positions and supply lines. The\n\nargument that civilian objects were intentionally targeted is not confirmed.\n\n(c) The DPR's units were faced with a choice: either to allow the UAF to shell their\n\npositions unhindered and to deliver supplies and reinforcements to their forward\n\npositions, or to hit enemy positions and military vehicles as they were on their way\n\nto those positions. Notably, the DPR hit mobile targets too for which known\n\nmethods for hitting mobile targets with artillery fire could be used.\n\n(d) The use of weapons that allow for wide area of engagement (such as BM-21 Grad)\n\nto shell UAF's positions and other military targets in Avdeyevka does not in itself\n\nindicate that the attackers intended to harm civilians. There are numerous examples\n\nof the use of such weapons in urban areas both by NATO forces and by the UAF\n\nthemselves.\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 11 out of 141\n\n(e) The rules of engagement applied by many countries allow for strikes resulting in\n\ncollateral damage if such strikes achieve a military advantage and/or other military\n\ngoals and objectives.\n\n12. Conclusions regarding the shelling in Kramatorsk on 10 February 2015:\n\n(a) The damage to civilian objects in the city was a consequence of the UAF's\n\ndeploying critical military facilities in the immediate vicinity of the city.\n\n(b) The shelling with the use of BM-30 Smerch system was targeted at facilities located\n\nat the Kramatorsk airfield (ATO command post, combat aircraft, tactical weapon\n\nsystems, ammunition depots, and personnel). Hitting these targets was, from a\n\nmilitary perspective, the most important task and number one priority for the DPR.\n\nGeneral Brown acknowledges this.\n\n(c) General Brown also confirms that BM-30 Smerch was the most appropriate weapon\n\nfor engaging targets at the Kramatorsk airfield.\n\n(d) The choice of BM-30 Smerch as the means of engagement does not mean that the\n\nattack was indiscriminate. The UAF themselves have repeatedly used BM-30\n\nSmerch and other systems with cluster munitions to shell downtown of Donetsk and\n\nother settlements. In contrast to the shelling of Kramatorsk, those attacks had no\n\nmilitary rationale consisting in shelling a large area with military targets (military\n\nheadquarters, combat aircraft, depots, etc.) spread over its territory.\n\n(e) The shelling of Kramatorsk residential areas was unintentional and\n\nmost likely related to failures of flight range adjustment systems of a small number\n\nof rockets. Unintentional nature of the shelling of residential areas and the desire to\n\navoid hitting those areas is confirmed by the DPR's use of a UAV for target\n\nreconnaissance in the airfield prior to the attack.\n\n(f) The fact that the shelling was directed against military targets is confirmed by the\n\nOSCE SMM's information on the area of the shelling and the casualties: the area of\n\nthe shelling, as assessed by the OSCE monitors, was \"near Kramatorsk airfield\" and\n\nthe victims were predominantly UAF servicemen (at least 33 dead and wounded\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 12 out of 141\n\nservicemen, 33 dead and wounded civilians – according to the information of the\n\nUkrainian side, provided by the OSCE SMM).6\n\n(g) Contrary to General Brown's assertion, the shelling of the Kramatorsk airfield by\n\nDPR forces could not have been carried out from south in the north direction,\n\nbecause in such case BM-30 Smerch launch site would have been deeply behind\n\nUAF's positions. In any case, debris from the carrier elements of the rockets are\n\nmuch less dangerous than their cluster munitions.\n\n(h) Technical faults and human error can cause even the highest-precision munitions to\n\ndeviate from targets. This has been proven by numerous examples from NATO\n\nmilitary campaigns. The mere presence of collateral damage caused by the use of\n\nguided munitions cannot in itself be evidence of deliberate targeting of civilian\n\nobjects.\n\n13. My conclusions are set out in more detail below.\n\n6 Memorial, Annex 331, See also Memorial, Annex 107.\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 13 out of 141\n\n13 JANUARY 2015 SHELLING OF THE BUGAS ROADBLOCK\n\nSUBSTANTIATION OF THE SHELLING OF THE BUGAS ROADBLOCK BY UAF ARTILLERY\n\ni. The presence of spoiler rings on MLRS missiles used to shell the Bugas roadblock\n\nindicates that the shelling was carried out by UAF's artillery\n\n14. General Brown claims that \"no evidence of spoiler rings was found by the investigators\".7\n\nThis is not the case. Annex 123 to Ukraine's Memorial includes expert report No. 16/8,\n\nprepared by the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute of Special Equipment and\n\nForensic Expert Examination dated 7 May 2015. It describes the fragments found in the\n\nterritory of the roadblock after the shelling. The descriptive part and one of the\n\nconclusions based on the chemical examination of the fragments (metal composition)\n\nnotes the following:\n\n\"object (No. 3) may be a fragment of a 'big ring' or 'small ring' of M-21OF\n\n(9M22U) shell.\" 8\n\n15. Spoiler rings are used to hit the target at close range. Spoiler rings are not intended to be\n\nused when firing at a maximum range as the rockets will not reach the target. Spoiler\n\nrings improve the accuracy and dispersion slightly, but the range is significantly reduced.\n\n16. General Brown claims that the shelling was carried out from a range of \"between 19.4\n\nand 19.8 kilometres\".9 General Brown obtained this range using data from firing tables,10\n\nand the angle of descent (between 52 and 55 degrees) determined by SBU.11 General\n\nBrown used the tables in relation to the firing without spoiler rings.\n\n17. As I pointed out above, however, the rockets that were fired at the Bugas roadblock had\n\nspoiler rings on them.\n\n18. For a projectile with a small spoiler ring the maximum range is 15,836 m and for a shell\n\nwith a large spoiler ring the maximum range is 11,840 m.12 Therefore, the use of spoiler\n\n7 Second Brown Report, para 15.\n\n8 Memorial, Annex 123, p. 15 and 16.\n\n9 Second Brown Report, para 15 (a) (i).\n\n10 Memorial, Annex 599, Firing Tables for High Explosive Fragmentation Projectiles M-21OF (1985).\n\n11 First Brown Report, para. 26.\n\n12 Memorial, Annex 599, Firing Tables for High Explosive Fragmentation Projectiles M-21OF (1985).\n\nAnnex 8\n\nPage 14 out of 141\n\nrings means that it is impossible to fire from a range of between 19.4 and 19.8 km. A\n\nprojectile with a spoiler ring would simply not be able to fly that distance.\n\n19. Given the evidence of the use of spoiler rings, it does not appear to make any tactical\n\nsense"
