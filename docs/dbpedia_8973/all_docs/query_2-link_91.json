        "text": "MEGAN THOMPSON:\n\nAs the accusations and warnings from both East and West mount…\n\nAs the pace of violence in Ukraine intensifies and the prospects of war grow…\n\nPeople living in what is now Ukraine find themselves in a familiar, uncomfortable position – seemingly at the mercy of a much more powerful neighbor.\n\nIn this case, the Russians.\n\nTheirs is a tangled relationship – sometimes close; other times strained, but rarely equal.\n\nIn fact, the connections between the two countries run deep. Through marriage. Religion. Culture. And language.\n\nALEXANDER MOTYL:\n\nSince around 1700, give or take a few years, the consensus view again is that Ukraine has been part of a Russian empire. To put a specific date on it, it was in 1709 with the battle of Poltava where Peter the Great defeated Charles the 12th of Sweden, who was then aligned to the Ukrainian leader of the so-called Cossacks. It's from that moment, approximately, that Ukrainians virtually total incorporation into Russian empire occurs. And it's at that moment as well that the consensus view is that Ukraine became the equivalent of a colony with all that that that means.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON:\n\nThen, in the late 1700s, an area in what is now in the southern and eastern portions of Ukraine, was taken by the Russians. It was called Novorossiya – the New Russia Putin referred to recently.\n\nAnd it basically stayed under Russian control until the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nThat was the first time parts of the geographic area that is now Ukraine tried to declare independence. Historians still argue over the details.\n\nBut in the early 1920s the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was formed as part of the new Soviet Union, where it remained, side-by-side with Russia, for the next seventy years. Even then, relations were often fraught.\n\nStalin's collectivization of Ukrainian farms in the 1930s led to a great famine and millions of deaths. This is an area which had long been known as the breadbasket of the region.\n\nAnd during World War II, many in Western Ukraine sided with the Nazis, not the kremlin.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON:\n\nIn 1954, the soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev ceded Crimea to Ukraine, at that point a transfer within the Soviet Union.\n\nAnd during much of the next nearly 40 years people from Ukraine were well represented in the soviet elite. Khrushchev rose to prominence as a Communist Party leader in Ukraine. And Leonid Brezhnev, who presided over the Soviet Union for nearly two decades, was actually born in Ukraine.\n\nKimberly Marten is a political science professor at Columbia University and Barnard College.\n\nKIMBERLY MARTEN:\n\nThere's also no question if you just sort of go through who the personnel were at various times at top ranking positions in both sort of the politics of the Communist Party, but also in terms of who were the industrial leaders, who were the military leaders, who were the leaders in the arts… people who came from Slavic backgrounds, so Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians certainly had a disproportionate level of being favored at the top.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON:\n\nMany Russians and Ukrainians share a faith in Orthodox Christianity. And because of their similar languages, many read each other's literature as well.\n\nIn fact, a 2001 census showed that Russian was native language for a majority of people in Crimea, Luhansk, and in Donetsk, where much of the recent violence is occurring.\n\nEven so, despite the language and ethnic differences throughout Ukraine since independence, there had been little strife between Ukrainians and Russians.\n\nTIMOTHY FRYE:\n\nWe have to bear in mind that for all the cleavages between east and west in Ukraine, for 23 years, Ukraine managed to govern itself not very well with lots of corruption and very poor economic performance. But without violence, without separatists movements. And it's only in this last three months that we've seen violence on scale that we are currently seeing.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON:\n\nFirst with huge pro-Western rallies in Kiev that sparked the pro-Russian government's violent crackdown, leading to the ouster of Moscow's ally, the elected president, Viktor Yanukovich.\n\nFollowed by Russia's seizing of Crimea.\n\nWeeks later those pro-Russian separatists occupied government buildings in cities in Eastern Ukraine, where they remain today. Some of the armed, masked men reportedly have close ties to the Russian military and special forces.\n\nIf Putin's behind all this, what's motivating him?\n\nMARIA SNEGOVAYA:\n\nThey say that Russia is a historically, very powerful civilization that has this very specific goal of preserving its traditional values and defining itself against the aggression of the West. And also Russia has to protect the neighboring countries, the cultures of Russia's traditional influence, such as Ukraine for example. And we can see that Putin is following that suggestion pretty closely. He's offering this new idea of the Russian world, where this kind of unifying feature would be the Russian language, and people with the Russian culture. And this Russian world is something that he's trying to recreate.\n\nKIMBERLY MARTEN:\n\nThat's just one small point in historical background that he's bringing up, but it seems to be a justification to the Russian people about taking further aggressive actions. When you start talking about Novorossiya on top of everything else that's just a completely new ball game and I think it's really sort of unclear what Putin's next plan is going to be."
