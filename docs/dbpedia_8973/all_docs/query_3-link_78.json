As there was originally just one seat of the Grand Prince (Velikiy knyaz') in Rus', first in Kiev, the title did not need any formal territorial reference. In the foreign relations of Kievan Rus' the title of Grand Prince of the Russians (Velikiy knyaz' Russkiy) was often used. After 1076 the occasional official (e.g. on seals) form of the title was Grand Prince of all Rus' (Velikiy knyaz' vseya Rusi), but in the period between 1169 and 1252 it was used by just two rulers.\n\nHetmanate\n\nHetman's Flag c.1706\n\nMap of Hetmanate Capital (after 1663, of Left-Bank Hetmanate): Chyhyryn (Chigirin) 1648-1663; Hadyach (Gadyach) 1663-1668; Baturyn (Baturin) 1668-1708, 1750-1764; Hlukhiv (Glukhov) 1708-1750, 1764-1773; Kozelets' (Kozelets) 1773-1775; Kiev 1775-1782\n\nPopulation: 1,027,928\n\n(1762, not including Zaporozhia Sich)\n\n-----------------------------\n\nMilitary: 30,000 (1764)\n\nConstitutionArticles of March (6 Apr 1654, amended several times until 1687); Articles of Resolution (8 Sep 1728)\n\nc.1489 Southern border areas of the province (voivodship) of Kiev\n\nconquered by Lithuania, organized as a military district called the 'Zaporozhian Sich (\"Transrapid Fortification\" (Zaporoz'ka\n\nSich) comprised of Cossacks.\n\n1572 Cossacks are divided into two entities- the Zaporozhian Host\n\n(Urban)(Viys'ko Zaporoz'ke Horodove) of Registered Cossacks, led\n\nby a Polish appointed Senior (Starshyy), and the largely\n\nindependent Zaporozhian Host (Lower) (Viys'ko Zaporoz'ke Nyzove),\n\nled by a self-elected Kish Ataman (Koshovyy Otaman), based at\n\nSich, the title Hetman is used occasionally by leaders of both\n\nHosts.\n\n2 May 1648 Rebellion against Poland-Lithuania begun (Kiev occupied by\n\nCossacks from Jan 1649).\n\n17 Aug 1649 In the Treaty of Zboriv, recognized by Poland as an autonomous\n\nHetmanate, retrospectively referred by historians as the\n\n\"Ukrainian Cossack Republic\" (covering Kiev, Bratslav [Bracław]\n\nand Chernihiv [Czernihów] voivodships), the Zaporozhian Host\n\n(Lower) at Sich included in the Hetmanate.\n\n28 Sep 1651 Bratslav and Chernihiv voivodships restored to Polish\n\nadministration.\n\n6 Apr 1654 Under Russian sovereignty by the Treaty of Pereyaslav (signed\n\n8/18 Jan 1654).\n\n6 Sep 1658 - Oct 1659 Under Polish sovereignty by the Treaty of Hadiach (Hadyach/\n\nGadyach), styled the Grand Principality of Ruthenia (the Kings\n\nof Poland being the Grand Princes), this move was not recognized\n\nby the Zaporozhian Host (Lower) (see below), which effectively\n\nseparated from Hetmanate.\n\n17 Jun 1663 Hetmanate of Zaporozhian Host is split between the pro-Russian\n\nHetmanate on the Left-Bank (east of the Dnieper River) and the\n\npro-Polish Hetmanate on the Right-Bank (west of the Dnieper\n\nRiver).\n\n31 Jan 1667 In the Treaty of Andrusovo provisionally partitioned between\n\nPoland and Russia.
