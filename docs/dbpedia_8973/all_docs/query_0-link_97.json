        "text": "In this pen­e­trat­ing inter­view, Jacques Baud delves into geopol­i­tics to help us bet­ter under­stand what is actu­al­ly tak­ing place in the Ukraine, in that it is ulti­mate­ly the larg­er strug­gle for glob­al dom­i­nance, led by the Unit­ed States, NATO and the polit­i­cal lead­ers of the West and against Rus­sia.\n\nAs always, Colonel Baud brings to bear his well-informed analy­sis, which is unique for its depth and grav­i­ty. We are sure that you will find this con­ser­va­tion infor­ma­tive, insight­ful and cru­cial in con­nect­ing the dots.\n\nThe Pos­til (TP): We are so very pleased to have you join us for this con­ver­sa­tion. Would you please tell us a lit­tle about your­self, about your back­ground?\n\nJacques Baud (JB): Thank you for invit­ing me! As to my edu­ca­tion, I have a master’s degree in Econo­met­rics and post­grad­u­ate diplo­mas in Inter­na­tion­al Rela­tions and in Inter­na­tion­al Secu­ri­ty from the Grad­u­ate Insti­tute for Inter­na­tion­al rela­tions in Gene­va (Switzer­land). I worked as strate­gic intel­li­gence offi­cer in the Swiss Depart­ment of Defense, and was in charge of the War­saw Pact armed forces, includ­ing those deployed abroad (such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Ango­la, etc.) I attend­ed intel­li­gence train­ing in the UK and in the US. Just after the end of the Cold War, I head­ed for a few years a unit in the Swiss Defense Research and Pro­cure­ment Agency. Dur­ing the Rwan­da War, because of my mil­i­tary and intel­li­gence back­ground, I was sent to the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Repub­lic of Con­go as secu­ri­ty advis­er to pre­vent eth­nic cleans­ing in the Rwan­dan refugee camps.\n\nDur­ing my time in the intel­li­gence ser­vice, I was in touch with the Afghan resis­tance move­ment of Ahmed Shah Masood, and I wrote a small hand­book to help Afghans in dem­i­ning and neu­tral­iz­ing Sovi­et bomblets. In the mid-1990, the strug­gle against antiper­son­nel mines became a for­eign pol­i­cy pri­or­i­ty of Switzer­land. I pro­posed to cre­ate a cen­ter that would col­lect infor­ma­tion about land­mines and dem­i­ning tech­nolo­gies for the UN. This led to the cre­ation of the Gene­va Inter­na­tion­al Cen­ter for Human­i­tar­i­an Dem­i­ning in Gene­va. I was lat­er offered to head the Pol­i­cy and Doc­trine Unit of the UN Depart­ment of Peace­keep­ing Oper­a­tions. After two years in New York, I went to Nairo­bi to per­form a sim­i­lar job for the African Union.\n\nThen I was assigned to NATO to counter the pro­lif­er­a­tion of small arms. Switzer­land is not a mem­ber of the Alliance, but this par­tic­u­lar posi­tion had been nego­ti­at­ed as a Swiss con­tri­bu­tion to the Part­ner­ship for Peace with NATO. In 2014, as the Ukraine cri­sis unfold­ed, I mon­i­tored the flow of small arms in the Don­bass. Lat­er, in the same year I was involved in a NATO pro­gram to assist the Ukrain­ian armed forces in restor­ing their capac­i­ties and improv­ing per­son­nel man­age­ment, with the aim of restor­ing trust in them.\n\nTP: You have writ­ten two insight­ful arti­cles about the cur­rent con­flict in the Ukraine, which we had the great priv­i­lege to trans­late and pub­lish (here and here). Was there a par­tic­u­lar event or an instance which led you to for­mu­late this much-need­ed per­spec­tive?\n\nJB: As a strate­gic intel­li­gence offi­cer, I always advo­cat­ed pro­vid­ing to the polit­i­cal or mil­i­tary deci­sion-mak­ers the most accu­rate and the most objec­tive intel­li­gence. This is the kind of job where you need to keep you prej­u­dice and your feel­ings to your­self, in order to come up with an intel­li­gence that reflects as much as pos­si­ble the real­i­ty on the ground rather than your own emo­tions or beliefs. I also assume that in a mod­ern demo­c­ra­t­ic State deci­sion must be fact-based. This is the dif­fer­ence with auto­crat­ic polit­i­cal sys­tems where deci­sion-mak­ing is ide­ol­o­gy-based (such as in the Marx­ist States) or reli­gion-based (such as in the French pre-rev­o­lu­tion­ary monar­chy).\n\nThanks to my var­i­ous assign­ments, I was able to have an insid­er view in most recent con­flicts (such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syr­ia and, of course, Ukraine). The main com­mon aspect between all these con­flicts is that we tend to have a total­ly dis­tort­ed under­stand­ing of them. We do not under­stand our ene­mies, their ratio­nale, their way of think­ing and their real objec­tives. Hence, we are not even able to artic­u­late sound strate­gies to fight them. This is espe­cial­ly true with Rus­sia. Most peo­ple, includ­ing the top brass, tend to con­fuse “Rus­sia” and “USSR.” As I was in NATO, I could hard­ly find some­one who could explain what Russia’s vision of the world is or even its polit­i­cal doc­trine. Lot of peo­ple think Vladimir Putin is a com­mu­nist. We like to call him a “dic­ta­tor,” but we have a hard time to explain what we mean by that. As exam­ples, peo­ple come up invari­ably with the assas­si­na­tion of such and such jour­nal­ist or for­mer FSB or GRU agents, although evi­dence is extreme­ly debat­able. In oth­er words, even if it is true, we are not able to artic­u­late exact­ly the nature of the prob­lem. As a result, we tend to por­tray the ene­my as we wished him to be, rather than as he actu­al­ly is. This is the ulti­mate recipe for fail­ure. This explains why, after five years spent with­in NATO, I am more con­cerned about West­ern strate­gic and mil­i­tary capa­bil­i­ties than before.\n\nIn 2014, dur­ing the Maid­an rev­o­lu­tion in Kiev, I was in NATO in Brus­sels. I noticed that peo­ple didn’t assess the sit­u­a­tion as it was, but as they wished it would be. This is exact­ly what Sun Tzu describes as the first step towards fail­ure. In fact, it appeared clear to me that nobody in NATO had the slight­est inter­est in Ukraine. The main goal was to desta­bi­lize Rus­sia.\n\nTP: How do you per­ceive Volodymyr Zelen­sky? Who is he, real­ly? What is his role in this con­flict? It seems he wants to have a “for­ev­er war,” since he must know he can­not win? Why does he want to pro­long this con­flict?\n\nJB: Volodymyr Zelen­sky was elect­ed on the promise he would make peace with Rus­sia, which I think is a noble objec­tive. The prob­lem is that no West­ern coun­try, nor the Euro­pean Union man­aged to help him real­ize this objec­tive. After the Maid­an rev­o­lu­tion, the emerg­ing force in the polit­i­cal land­scape was the far-right move­ment. I do not like to call it “neo-Nazi” because “Nazism” was a clear­ly defined polit­i­cal doc­trine, while in Ukraine, we are talk­ing about a vari­ety of move­ments that com­bine all the fea­tures of Nazism (such as anti­semitism, extreme nation­al­ism, vio­lence, etc.), with­out being uni­fied into a sin­gle doc­trine. They are more like a gath­er­ing of fanat­ics.\n\nAfter 2014, Ukrain­ian armed forces’ com­mand & con­trol was extreme­ly poor and was the cause of their inabil­i­ty to han­dle the rebel­lion in Don­bass. Sui­cide, alco­hol inci­dents, and mur­der surged, push­ing young sol­diers to defect. Even the British gov­ern­ment not­ed that young male indi­vid­u­als pre­ferred to emi­grate rather than to join the armed forces. As a result, Ukraine start­ed to recruit vol­un­teers to enforce Kiev’s author­i­ty in the Russ­ian speak­ing part of the coun­try. These vol­un­teers were (and still are) recruit­ed among Euro­pean far-right extrem­ists. Accord­ing to Reuters, their num­ber amounts to 102,000. They have become a size­able and influ­en­tial polit­i­cal force in the coun­try.\n\nThe prob­lem here is that these far-right fanat­ics threat­ened to kill Zelen­sky were he to try to make peace with Rus­sia. As a result, Zelen­sky found him­self sit­ting between his promis­es and the vio­lent oppo­si­tion of an increas­ing­ly pow­er­ful far-right move­ment. In May 2019, on the Ukrain­ian media Obozre­va­tel, Dmytro Yarosh, head of the “Pravy Sek­tor” mili­tia and advis­er to the Army Com­man­der in Chief, open­ly threat­ened Zelen­sky with death, if he came to an agree­ment with Rus­sia. In oth­er words, Zelen­sky appears to be black­mailed by forces he is prob­a­bly not in full con­trol of.\n\nIn Octo­ber 2021, the Jerusalem Post pub­lished a dis­turb­ing report on the train­ing of Ukrain­ian far-right mili­tias by Amer­i­can, British, French and Cana­di­an armed forces. The prob­lem is that the “col­lec­tive West” tends to turn a blind eye to these inces­tu­ous and per­verse rela­tion­ships in order to achieve its own geopo­lit­i­cal goals. It is sup­port­ed by unscrupu­lous far-right biased medias against Israel, which tend to approve the crim­i­nal behav­ior of these mili­tias. This sit­u­a­tion has repeat­ed­ly raised Israel’s con­cerns. This explains why Zelensky’s demands to the Israeli par­lia­ment in March 2022 were not well received and have not been suc­cess­ful.\n\nSo, despite his prob­a­ble will­ing­ness to achieve a polit­i­cal set­tle­ment for the cri­sis with Rus­sia, Zelen­sky is not allowed to do so. Just after he indi­cat­ed his readi­ness to talk with Rus­sia, on 25 Feb­ru­ary, the Euro­pean Union decid­ed two days lat­er to pro­vide €450M in arms to Ukraine. The same hap­pened in March. As soon as Zelen­sky indi­cat­ed he want­ed to have talks with Vladimir Putin on 21 March, the Euro­pean Union decid­ed to dou­ble its mil­i­tary aid to €1 bil­lion on 23 March. End of March, Zelen­sky made an inter­est­ing offer that was retract­ed short­ly after.\n\nAppar­ent­ly, Zelen­sky is try­ing to nav­i­gate between West­ern pres­sure and his far right on the one hand and his con­cern to find a solu­tion on the oth­er, and is forced into a “back-and-forth,” which dis­cour­ages the Russ­ian nego­tia­tors.\n\nIn fact, I think Zelen­sky is in an extreme uncom­fort­able posi­tion, which reminds me of Sovi­et Mar­shal Kon­stan­tin Rokossovsky’s dur­ing WWII. Rokossovsky had been impris­oned in 1937 for trea­son and sen­tenced to death by Stal­in. In 1941, he got out of prison on Stalin’s orders and was giv­en a com­mand. He was even­tu­al­ly pro­mot­ed to Mar­shall of the Sovi­et Union in 1944, but his death sen­tence was not lift­ed until 1956.\n\nToday, Zelen­sky must lead his coun­try under the sword of Damo­cles, with the bless­ing of West­ern politi­cians and uneth­i­cal media. His lack of polit­i­cal expe­ri­ence made him an easy prey for those who were try­ing to exploit Ukraine against Rus­sia, and in the hands of extreme right-wing move­ments. As he acknowl­edges in an inter­view with CNN, he was obvi­ous­ly lured into believ­ing that Ukraine would enter NATO more eas­i­ly after an open con­flict with Rus­sia, as Olek­sey Arestovich, his advis­er, con­firmed in 2019.\n\nTP: What do you think will be the fate of the Ukraine? Will it be like all the oth­er exper­i­ments in “spread­ing democ­ra­cy” (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, etc.)? Or is Ukraine a spe­cial case?\n\nJB: I have def­i­nite­ly no crys­tal ball… At this stage, we can only guess what Vladimir Putin wants. He prob­a­bly wants to achieve two main goals. The first one is to secure the sit­u­a­tion of the Russ­ian-speak­ing minor­i­ty in Ukraine. How, remains an open ques­tion. Does he want to re-cre­ate the “Novorossiya” that tried to emerge from the 2014 unrests? This “enti­ty” that nev­er real­ly exist­ed, and it con­sist­ed of the short-lived Republics of Odessa, Donet­sk, Dne­propetro­vsk, Kharkov and Lugan­sk, of which only the Republics of Donet­sk and Lugan­sk “sur­vived.” The auton­o­my ref­er­en­dum planned for ear­ly May in the city of Kher­son might be an indi­ca­tion for this option. Anoth­er option would be to nego­ti­ate an autonomous sta­tus for these areas, and to return them to Ukraine in exchange of its neu­tral­i­ty.\n\nThe sec­ond goal is to have a neu­tral Ukraine (some will say a “Fin­lan­dized Ukraine”). That is—without NATO. It could be some kind of Swiss “armed neu­tral­i­ty.” As you know, in the ear­ly 19th cen­tu­ry, Switzer­land had a neu­tral sta­tus imposed on it by the Euro­pean pow­ers, as well as the oblig­a­tion to pre­vent any mis­use of its ter­ri­to­ry against one of these pow­ers. This explains the strong mil­i­tary tra­di­tion we have in Switzer­land and the main ratio­nale for its armed forces today. Some­thing sim­i­lar could prob­a­bly be con­sid­ered for Ukraine.\n\nAn inter­na­tion­al­ly rec­og­nized neu­tral sta­tus would grant Ukraine a high degree of secu­ri­ty. This sta­tus pre­vent­ed Switzer­land from being attacked dur­ing the two world wars. The often-men­tioned exam­ple of Bel­gium is mis­lead­ing, because dur­ing both world wars, its neu­tral­i­ty was declared uni­lat­er­al­ly and was not rec­og­nized by the bel­liger­ents. In the case of Ukraine, it would have its own armed forces, but would be free from any for­eign mil­i­tary pres­ence: nei­ther NATO, nor Rus­sia. This is just my guess, and I have no clue about how this could be fea­si­ble and accept­ed in the cur­rent polar­ized inter­na­tion­al cli­mate.\n\nI am not sure about the so-called “col­or-rev­o­lu­tions” aim at spread­ing democ­ra­cy. My take is that it is just a way to weaponize human rights, the rule of law or democ­ra­cy in order to achieve geo-strate­gic objec­tives. In fact, this was clear­ly spelled out in a memo to Rex Tiller­son, Don­ald Trump’s Sec­re­tary of State, in 2017. Ukraine is a case in point. After 2014, despite West­ern influ­ence, it has nev­er been a democ­ra­cy: cor­rup­tion soared between 2014 and 2020; in 2021, it banned oppo­si­tion media and jailed the leader of the main par­lia­men­tary oppo­si­tion par­ty. As some inter­na­tion­al orga­ni­za­tions have report­ed, tor­ture is a com­mon prac­tice, and oppo­si­tion lead­ers as well as jour­nal­ists are chased by the Ukrain­ian Secu­ri­ty Ser­vice.\n\nTP: Why is the West only inter­est­ed in draw­ing a sim­plis­tic image of the Ukraine con­flict? That of “good guys” and the “bad guys?” Is the West­ern pub­lic real­ly now that dumb­ed down?\n\nJB: I think this is inher­ent to any con­flict. Each side tends to por­tray itself as the “good guy.” This is obvi­ous­ly the main rea­son.\n\nBesides this, oth­er fac­tors come into play. First, most peo­ple, includ­ing politi­cians and jour­nal­ists, still con­fuse Rus­sia and the USSR. For instance, they don’t under­stand why the com­mu­nist par­ty is the main oppo­si­tion par­ty in Rus­sia.\n\nSec­ond, since 2007, Putin was sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly demo­nized in the West. Whether or not he is a “dic­ta­tor” Is a mat­ter of dis­cus­sion; but it is worth not­ing that his approval rate in Rus­sia nev­er fell below 59 % in the last 20 years. I take my fig­ures from the Lev­a­da Cen­ter, which is labeled as “for­eign agent” in Rus­sia, and hence doesn’t reflect the Kremlin’s views. It is also inter­est­ing to see that in France, some of the most influ­en­tial so-called “experts” on Rus­sia are in fact work­ing for the British MI‑6’s “Integri­ty Ini­tia­tive.”\n\nThird, in the West, there is a sense that you can do what­ev­er you want if it is in the name of west­ern val­ues. This is why the Russ­ian offen­sive in Ukraine is pas­sion­ate­ly sanc­tioned, while FUKUS (France, UK, US) wars get strong polit­i­cal sup­port, even if they are noto­ri­ous­ly based on lies. “Do what I say, not what I do!” One could ask what makes the con­flict in Ukraine worse than oth­er wars. In fact, each new sanc­tion we apply to Rus­sia high­lights the sanc­tions we haven’t applied ear­li­er to the US, the UK or France.\n\nThe pur­pose of this incred­i­ble polar­iza­tion is to pre­vent any dia­logue or nego­ti­a­tion with Rus­sia. We are back to what hap­pened in 1914, just before the start of WWI…\n\nTP: What will Rus­sia gain or lose with this involve­ment in the Ukraine (which is like­ly to be long-term)? Rus­sia is fac­ing a con­flict on “two fronts,” it would seem: a mil­i­tary one and an eco­nom­ic one (with the end­less sanc­tions and “can­cel­ing” of Rus­sia).\n\nJB: With the end of the Cold War, Rus­sia expect­ed being able to devel­op clos­er rela­tions with its West­ern neigh­bors. It even con­sid­ered join­ing NATO. But the US resist­ed every attempt of rap­proche­ment. NATO struc­ture does not allow for the coex­is­tence of two nuclear super­pow­ers. The US want­ed to keep its suprema­cy.\n\nSince 2002, the qual­i­ty of the rela­tions with Rus­sia decayed slow­ly, but steadi­ly. It reached a first neg­a­tive “peak” in 2014 after the Maid­an coup. The sanc­tions have become US and EU pri­ma­ry for­eign pol­i­cy tool. The West­ern nar­ra­tive of a Russ­ian inter­ven­tion in Ukraine got trac­tion, although it was nev­er sub­stan­ti­at­ed. Since 2014, I haven’t met any intel­li­gence pro­fes­sion­al who could con­firm any Russ­ian mil­i­tary pres­ence in the Don­bass. In fact, Crimea became the main “evi­dence” of Russ­ian “inter­ven­tion.” Of course, West­ern his­to­ri­ans ignore superbly that Crimea was sep­a­rat­ed from Ukraine by ref­er­en­dum in Jan­u­ary 1990, six months before Ukrain­ian inde­pen­dence and under Sovi­et rule. In fact, it’s Ukraine that ille­gal­ly annexed Crimea in 1995. Yet, west­ern coun­tries sanc­tioned Rus­sia for that…\n\nSince 2014 sanc­tions severe­ly affect­ed east-west rela­tions. After the sig­na­ture of the Min­sk Agree­ments in Sep­tem­ber 2014 and Feb­ru­ary 2015, the West—namely France, Ger­many as guar­an­tors for Ukraine, and the US—made no effort what­so­ev­er to make Kiev com­ply, despite repeat­ed requests from Moscow.\n\nRussia’s per­cep­tion is that what­ev­er it will do, it will face an irra­tional response from the West. This is why, in Feb­ru­ary 2022, Vladimir Putin real­ized he would gain noth­ing in doing noth­ing. If you take into account his mount­ing approval rate in the coun­try, the resilience of the Russ­ian econ­o­my after the sanc­tions, the loss of trust in the US dol­lar, the threat­en­ing infla­tion in the West, the con­sol­i­da­tion of the Moscow-Bei­jing axis with the sup­port of India (which the US has failed to keep in the “Quad”), Putin’s cal­cu­la­tion was unfor­tu­nate­ly not wrong.\n\nRegard­less of what Rus­sia does, US and west­ern strat­e­gy is to weak­en it. From that point on, Rus­sia has no real stake in its rela­tions with us. Again, the US objec­tive is not to have a “bet­ter” Ukraine or a “bet­ter” Rus­sia, but a weak­er Rus­sia. But it also shows that the Unit­ed States is not able to rise high­er than Rus­sia and that the only way to over­come it is to weak­en it. This should ring an alarm bell in our coun­tries…\n\nTP: You have writ­ten a very inter­est­ing book on Putin. Please tell us a lit­tle about it.\n\nJB: In fact, I start­ed my book in Octo­ber 2021, after a show on French state TV about Vladimir Putin. I am def­i­nite­ly not an admir­er of Vladimir Putin, nor of any West­ern leader, by the way. But the so-called experts had so lit­tle under­stand­ing of Rus­sia, inter­na­tion­al secu­ri­ty and even of sim­ple plain facts, that I decid­ed to write a book. Lat­er, as the sit­u­a­tion around Ukraine devel­oped, I adjust­ed my approach to cov­er this mount­ing con­flict.\n\nThe idea was def­i­nite­ly not to relay Russ­ian pro­pa­gan­da. In fact, my book is based exclu­sive­ly on west­ern sources, offi­cial reports, declas­si­fied intel­li­gence reports, Ukrain­ian offi­cial medias, and reports pro­vid­ed by the Russ­ian oppo­si­tion. The approach was to demon­strate that we can have a sound and fac­tu­al alter­na­tive under­stand­ing of the sit­u­a­tion just with acces­si­ble infor­ma­tion and with­out rely­ing on what we call “Russ­ian pro­pa­gan­da.”\n\nThe under­ly­ing think­ing is that we can only achieve peace if we have a more bal­anced view of the sit­u­a­tion. To achieve this, we have to go back to the facts. Now, these facts exist and are abun­dant­ly avail­able and acces­si­ble. The prob­lem is that some indi­vid­u­als make every effort to pre­vent this and tend to hide the facts that dis­turb them. This is exem­pli­fied by some so-called jour­nal­ist who dubbed me “The spy who loved Putin!” This is the kind of “jour­nal­ists” who live from stir­ring ten­sions and extrem­ism. All fig­ures and data pro­vid­ed by our media about the con­flict come from Ukraine, and those com­ing from Rus­sia are auto­mat­i­cal­ly dis­missed as pro­pa­gan­da. My view is that both are pro­pa­gan­da. But as soon as you come up with west­ern data that do not fit into the main­stream nar­ra­tive, you have extrem­ists claim­ing you “love Putin.”\n\nOur media are so wor­ried about find­ing ratio­nal­i­ty in Putin’s actions that they turn a blind eye to the crimes com­mit­ted by Ukraine, thus gen­er­at­ing a feel­ing of impuni­ty for which Ukraini­ans are pay­ing the price. This is the case of the attack on civil­ians by a mis­sile in Kramatorsk—we no longer talk about it because the respon­si­bil­i­ty of Ukraine is very like­ly, but this means that the Ukraini­ans could do it again with impuni­ty.\n\nOn the con­trary, my book aims at reduc­ing the cur­rent hys­te­ria that pre­vent any polit­i­cal solu­tion. I do not want to deny the Ukraini­ans the right to resist the inva­sion with arms. If I were Ukrain­ian, I would prob­a­bly take the arms to defend my land. The issue here is that it must be their deci­sion. The role of the inter­na­tion­al com­mu­ni­ty should not be to add fuel to the fire by sup­ply­ing arms but to pro­mote a nego­ti­at­ed solu­tion.\n\nTo move in this direc­tion, we must make the con­flict dis­pas­sion­ate and bring it back into the realm of ratio­nal­i­ty. In any con­flict the prob­lems come from both sides; but here, strange­ly, our media show us that they all come from one side only. This is obvi­ous­ly not true; and, in the end, it is the Ukrain­ian peo­ple who pay the price of our pol­i­cy against Vladimir Putin.\n\nTP: Why is Putin hat­ed so much by the West­ern elite?\n\nJB: Putin became West­ern elite’s “bête noire” in 2007 with his famous speech in Munich. Until then, Rus­sia had only mod­er­ate­ly react­ed to NATO expan­sion. But as the US with­drew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 and start­ed nego­ti­a­tions with some East Euro­pean coun­tries to deploy anti-bal­lis­tic mis­siles, Rus­sia felt the heat and Putin vir­u­lent­ly crit­i­cized the US and NATO.\n\nThis was the start of a relent­less effort to demo­nize Vladimir Putin and to weak­en Rus­sia. The prob­lem was def­i­nite­ly not human rights or democ­ra­cy, but the fact that Putin dared to chal­lenge the west­ern approach. The Rus­sians have in com­mon with the Swiss the fact that they are very legal­is­tic. They try to strict­ly fol­low the rules of inter­na­tion­al law. They tend to fol­low “law-based Inter­na­tion­al order.” Of course, this is not the image we have, because we are used to hid­ing cer­tain facts. Crimea is a case in point.\n\nIn the West, since the ear­ly 2000s, the US has start­ed to impose a “rules-based inter­na­tion­al order.” As an exam­ple, although the US offi­cial­ly rec­og­nizes that there is only one Chi­na and that Tai­wan is only a part of it, it main­tains a mil­i­tary pres­ence on the island and sup­plies weapons. Imag­ine if Chi­na would sup­ply weapons to Hawaii (which was ille­gal­ly annexed in the 19th cen­tu­ry)!\n\nWhat the West is pro­mot­ing is an inter­na­tion­al order based on the “law of the strongest.” As long as the US was the sole super­pow­er, every­thing was fine. But as soon as Chi­na and Rus­sia start­ed to emerge as world pow­ers, the US tried to con­tain them. This is exact­ly what Joe Biden said in March 2021, short­ly after tak­ing office: “The rest of the world is clos­ing in and clos­ing in fast. We can’t allow this to con­tin­ue.”\n\nAs Hen­ry Kissinger said in the Wash­ing­ton Post: “For the West, the demo­niza­tion of Vladimir Putin is not a pol­i­cy; it is an ali­bi for the absence of one.” This is why I felt we need to have a more fac­tu­al approach to this con­flict.\n\nTP: Do you know who was involved and when it was decid­ed by the US and NATO that regime change in Rus­sia was a pri­ma­ry geopo­lit­i­cal objec­tive?\n\nJB: I think every­thing start­ed in the ear­ly 2000s. I am not sure the objec­tive was a regime change in Moscow, but it was cer­tain­ly to con­tain Rus­sia. This is what we have wit­nessed since then. The 2014 events in Kiev have boost­ed US efforts.\n\nThese were clear­ly defined in 2019, in two pub­li­ca­tions of the RAND Cor­po­ra­tion [James Dob­bins, Raphael S. Cohen, Nathan Chan­dler, Bryan Fred­er­ick, Edward Geist, Paul DeLu­ca, For­rest E. Mor­gan, Howard J. Shatz, Brent Williams, “Extend­ing Rus­sia : Com­pet­ing from Advan­ta­geous Ground,” RAND Cor­po­ra­tion, 2019; James Dob­bins & al., “Overex­tend­ing and Unbal­anc­ing Rus­sia,” RAND Cor­po­ra­tion, (Doc Nr. RB-10014‑A), 2019]. .This has noth­ing to do with the rule of law, democ­ra­cy or human rights, but only with main­tain­ing US suprema­cy in the world. In oth­er words, nobody cares about Ukraine. This is why the inter­na­tion­al com­mu­ni­ty (that is, West­ern coun­tries) make every effort to pro­long the con­flict.\n\nSince 2014, this is exact­ly what hap­pened. Every­thing the West did was to ful­fill US strate­gic objec­tives.\n\nTP: In this regard, you have also writ­ten anoth­er inter­est­ing book, on Alex­ei Naval­ny. Please tell us about what you have found out about Naval­ny.\n\nJB: What dis­turbed me about the Naval­ny case was the haste with which West­ern gov­ern­ments con­demned Rus­sia and applied sanc­tions, even before know­ing the results of an impar­tial inves­ti­ga­tion. So, my point in the book is not “to tell truth,” because we do not know exact­ly what the truth is, even if we have con­sis­tent indi­ca­tions that the offi­cial nar­ra­tive is wrong.\n\nThe inter­est­ing aspect is that the Ger­man doc­tors in the Char­ité Hos­pi­tal in Berlin, were not able to iden­ti­fy any nerve agent in Navalny’s body. Sur­pris­ing­ly, they pub­lished their find­ings in the respect­ed med­ical review The Lancet, show­ing that Naval­ny prob­a­bly expe­ri­enced a bad com­bi­na­tion of med­i­cine and oth­er sub­stances.\n\nThe Swedish mil­i­tary lab that ana­lyzed Navalny’s blood—redact­ed the name of the sub­stance they dis­cov­ered, which is odd since every­body expect­ed “Novi­chok” to be men­tioned.\n\nThe bot­tom line is that we don’t know exact­ly what hap­pened, but the nature of the symp­toms, the reports of the Ger­man doc­tors, the answers pro­vid­ed by the Ger­man gov­ern­ment to the Par­lia­ment, and the puz­zling Swedish doc­u­ment tend to exclude a crim­i­nal poi­son­ing, and there­fore, a for­tiori, poi­son­ing by the Russ­ian gov­ern­ment.\n\nThe main point of my book is that inter­na­tion­al rela­tions can­not be “Twit­ter-dri­ven.” We need to use appro­pri­ate­ly our intel­li­gence resources, not as a pro­pa­gan­da instru­ment, as we tend to do these days, but as an instru­ment for smart and fact-based deci­sion-mak­ing.\n\nTP: You have much expe­ri­ence with­in NATO. What do you think is the pri­ma­ry role of NATO now?\n\nJB: This is an essen­tial ques­tion. In fact, NATO hasn’t real­ly evolved since the end of the Cold War. This is inter­est­ing because in 1969, there was the “Harmel Report” that was ahead of its time and could be the fun­da­ment of a new def­i­n­i­tion of NATO’s role. Instead, NATO tried to find new mis­sions, such as in Afghanistan, for which the Alliance was not pre­pared, nei­ther intel­lec­tu­al­ly, nor doc­tri­nal­ly, nor from a strate­gic point of view.\n\nHav­ing a col­lec­tive defense sys­tem in Europe is nec­es­sary, but the nuclear dimen­sion of NATO tends to restrict its abil­i­ty to engage a con­ven­tion­al con­flict with a nuclear pow­er. This is the prob­lem we are wit­ness­ing in Ukraine. This is why Rus­sia strives hav­ing a “glacis” between NATO and its ter­ri­to­ry. This would prob­a­bly not pre­vent con­flicts but would help keep them as long as pos­si­ble in a con­ven­tion­al phase. This is why I think a non-nuclear Euro­pean defense orga­ni­za­tion would be a good solu­tion.\n\nTP: Do you think that NATO’s proxy war with Rus­sia serves to pla­cate inter­nal EU ten­sions, between con­ser­v­a­tive Central/Eastern Europe and the more pro­gres­sive West?\n\nJB: Some will cer­tain­ly see it that way, but I think this is only a by-prod­uct of the US strat­e­gy to iso­late Rus­sia.\n\nTP: Can you say some­thing about how Turkey has posi­tioned itself, between NATO and Rus­sia?\n\nJB: I have worked quite exten­sive­ly with Turkey as I was in NATO. I think Turkey is a very com­mit­ted mem­ber of the Alliance. What we tend to for­get is that Turkey is at the cross­roads between the “Chris­t­ian World” and the “Islam­ic World;” it sits between two civ­i­liza­tions and in a key region of the Mediter­ranean zone. It has its own region­al stakes.\n\nThe con­flicts waged by the West in the Mid­dle East sig­nif­i­cant­ly impact­ed Turkey, by pro­mot­ing Islamism and stim­u­lat­ing ten­sions, in par­tic­u­lar with the Kurds. Turkey has always tried to main­tain a bal­ance between its desire for West­ern-style mod­ern­iza­tion and the very strong tra­di­tion­al­ist ten­den­cies of its pop­u­la­tion. Turkey’s oppo­si­tion to the Iraq War due to domes­tic secu­ri­ty con­cerns was total­ly ignored and dis­missed by the US and its NATO Allies.\n\nInter­est­ing­ly, when Zelen­sky sought a coun­try to medi­ate the con­flict, he turned to Chi­na, Israel and Turkey, but didn’t address any EU coun­try.\n\nTP: If you were to pre­dict, what do you think the geopo­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion of Europe and the world will look like 25 years from now?\n\nJB: Who would have pre­dict­ed the fall of the Berlin Wall? The day it hap­pened, I was in the office of a Nation­al Secu­ri­ty Advis­er in Wash­ing­ton DC, but he had no clue about the impor­tance of the event!\n\nI think the decay of US hege­mo­ny will be the main fea­ture of the next decades. At the same time, we will see a fast-grow­ing impor­tance of Asia led by Chi­na and India. But I am not sure Asia will “replace” the US strict­ly speak­ing. While US world­wide hege­mo­ny was dri­ven by its mil­i­tary-indus­tri­al com­plex, Asia’s dom­i­nance will be in the research and tech­nol­o­gy area.\n\nThe loss of con­fi­dence in the US dol­lar may have sig­nif­i­cant impact on the US econ­o­my at large. I don’t want to spec­u­late on future devel­op­ments in the West, but a sig­nif­i­cant dete­ri­o­ra­tion could lead the Unit­ed States to engage in more con­flicts around the world. This is some­thing that we are see­ing today, but it could become more impor­tant.\n\nTP: What advice would you give peo­ple try­ing to get a clear­er pic­ture of what is real­ly dri­ving com­pet­ing regional/national and glob­al inter­ests?\n\nJB: I think the sit­u­a­tion is slight­ly dif­fer­ent in Europe than in North Amer­i­ca.\n\nIn Europe, the lack of qual­i­ty alter­na­tive media and real inves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ism makes it dif­fi­cult to find bal­anced infor­ma­tion. The sit­u­a­tion is dif­fer­ent in North Amer­i­ca where alter­na­tive jour­nal­ism is more devel­oped and con­sti­tutes an indis­pens­able ana­lyt­i­cal tool. In the Unit­ed States, the intel­li­gence com­mu­ni­ty is more present in the media than in Europe.\n\nI prob­a­bly could not have writ­ten my book based only on the Euro­pean media. At the end of the day, the advice I would give is a fun­da­men­tal one of intel­li­gence work:\n\nBe curi­ous!"
