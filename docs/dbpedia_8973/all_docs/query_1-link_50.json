In the present historical circumstances, an analysis of both territorial governance of the Crimea within the Russian Empire and the first gover-\n\nnors’ activities to manage Tauride Governorate seems quite topical. Based on the archival data, I have considered the creation of Taurida Gov-\n\nernorate, its administrative structure and features of government in the article. I have analyzed the process of region integrating in the all-\n\nRussian state structure, as well as the role of first governors in this process. I have shown the period when Taurida Governorate was created\n\n(October 8, 1802) was a difficult time for the region. First governors were required to not only contribute to the fullest extent possible to in-\n\nclude strategically important area of the Crimea into the Russian Empire, but also to learn to operate (since they did not have managerial expe-\n\nrience). State-building was occurred in the Crimea, and Governors played first violin in this process. Taurida governor obeyed the Ministry of\n\nInternal Affairs and Kherson military governor. The Governorate was divided into seven districts. Governors were required to develop cities\n\nand agriculture, to fight against crime. Financial position of the governor was difficult. The Crimea was integrated into the Russian Empire in\n\nthe first decades of the 19th century. The economy began to grow, increase in population and quality of life.\n\nHow to cope with the end of utopia? How to move from making history on a day-today basis to capitalizing on a legend?

How to move from making history on a day-today basis to capitalizing on a legend? That is the dilemma Russian veterans of the Donbas insurgency have faced since the exalting atmosphere of Novorossiya faded away. In this article, I trace the transformations of the Novorossiya utopia from the point at which Russian volunteer fighters began to return to Russia and found themselves compelled to reinvent themselves in a new context. I first look at the difficult reconversion from war to politics of Donbas heroes such as Igor Strelkov and Aleksandr Borodai and how their efforts to launch new structures based on their war legitimacy have succeeded or failed. I then turn to investigate the birth of new heroes, such as the writer Zakhar Prilepin, who wave the metaphorical flag of Donbas at a time when exaltation of the war has declined. After that, I explore how Novorossiya has become a literature genre that occupies the shelves of Russian bookstores, spanning from Novorossievedenie-the \"science of Novorossiya\"-to the rich subgenre of war memoirs and veteran diaries.\n\nВпервые на основе различных архивных данных и других источников воссоздана деятельность второго таврического гражданского губернатора Д.Б.

Мертваго. Рассмотрена его работа в качестве председателя Комиссии по разрешению земельных споров и Крымской соляной части.\n\nStudying experience in managing administrative and territorial units of centralized ethnically non-homogenous territorial and political systems (Empires) is of interest for the historians, political analysts and the administrators not only theoretically but also in practical terms. One of the most effective approaches to such investigations is prosopographic one, especially when it is used for studying early nineteenth-century administration elite in such frontier region recently joined the Russian Empire, as Crimea. This approach is important to understanding principles applied in imperial regional and public administration.\n\nMy article is a brief prosopographyc essay on the second civil Taurida governor Dmitry Mertvago’s public administration and social activity.\n\nThanks to his connections with eminent statesmen of Catherine's era and the reign of Paul I, Dmitry Mertvago became significant administrative figure in Crimea and one of the most prominent government officials in the history of this region. Using archive sources and narrative analysis, I have analyzed Mertvago’s work as both founder of Crimean Winemaking Training School of and Head of Commission for Settlement of Land Disputes and Crimean Salt Expedition.\n\nSo, I show that, on the one hand, the main purpose of the Dmitry Mertvago’ activities in all his various administrative capacities was the task of social-political unification of the region as part of the Russian Empire. In this regard, Taurida Governor was a true son of his epoch, and even outpaced it. Thus, Dmitry Mertvago became a kind of anti-crisis manager and a fighter against corruption in the affairs of Commission for Settlement of Land Disputes and Crimean Salt Expedition. Moreover, Taurida governor created his own project for colonization of Crimea with attraction both potential faithful subjects and perspective taxpayers, including ethnic groups such as Greeks and Armenians (with simultaneous eviction of unpromising economically, socially dangerous and declassed residents). In the years of threat of war with Napoleon, and the next Russian-Turkish war, he was able to organize Crimean Tatar cavalry divisions, devotees of Russia and its Emperor, and he tried to form genuinely functioning Taurida Spiritual Muslim Directorate. On the other hand, Dmitry Mertvago’s methods of governance and administrative practices belonged to the recent past of the 18th century and to a large extent were based on personal and estate-corporate relations.\n\nI conclude Mertvago’s work as a civil Taurida governor is an example of the work of the official-reformer of the early 19th century. He, who has obtain operating control over the province in ‘zero’ state, for a short period of time managed to lay the foundations for the future prosperity of the region. This speaks in favor of the effectiveness of such type of governance in Russia, perhaps, not only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, but also on each turn of epochs in the border areas.\n\nЗаписки путешественников по Крыму занимают одну из ключевых позиций среди других источников по истории полуострова конца XVIII–первой половины XIX вв.

Присоединение Крыма к Российской империи в 1783 г. резко подняло интерес к полуострову. Вслед за императрицей Екатериной II в Крым потянулась длинная вереница иностранных путешественников. Обычно на них производило сильное впечатление то, что для местных жителей было привычным, а потому неприметным. Иностранные путешественники замечали наиболее значимые, бросающиеся в глаза ситуации, процессы и проблемы, существовавшие на полуострове. Они\n\nобращали пристальное внимание на успехи и неудачи российской администрации, не боялись критиковать работу губернского аппарата управления, указывали на наличие в Крыму коррупции и злоупотреблений чиновников. Также они часто давали оценки высшим чиновникам Новороссийского края и Таврической губернии, поскольку обычно гостили в их\n\nдомах и лично общались с ними. В результате записки путешественников\n\nсохранили восприятие иностранцами высших чиновников Таврической губернии – как их личных качеств, так и управленческих навыков и методов. Подавляющее большинство иностранных путешественников первой половины XIX в. обычно хвалебно отзывались о высших чиновниках Таврической губернии, а о российском чиновничестве в целом – весьма критически. «Бюрократ-вредитель» предстает на страницах записок путешественников в обезличенном образе рядового государственного служащего. Высшие чиновники воспринимаются и изображаются иностранными путешественниками как творцы всех успехов российской власти в Крыму, как двигатель прогресса. Напротив, рядовой бюрократ-коррупционер изображается как главное препятствие движению России к прогрессу.\n\nTravelers notes about Crimea hold one of the key positions among other sources on the history of the peninsula in the late 18 th and the first half of the 19 th centuries. With Crimea becoming part of the Russian Empire in 1783, public interest toward the peninsular rose sharply. Following Empress Catherine II’s visit to Crimea a whole host of foreign travelers started to the same destination. As a rule, they were extremely impressed by what was common and, otherwise, unremarkable for the local population. The foreign travelers paid attention to the most significant, “eye-catching” situations, processes and problems of the peninsular, focusing on the achievements and failures of the Russian administration. They fearlessly criticized the work of\n\nprovince administration, citing various cases of corruption and power abuse by local officials. Senior officials of Novorossiysk Krai and Taurida Province were also described as the travelers were usually received as guests at their houses and had personal contacts with them. As a result, these travelogues reflect the foreigners’ perception of both personal traits and administrative methods and capacities of the top officials of the Taurida Province. The majority of the foreigners’ accounts dated by the first half of 19 th century were complimentary and laudatory as far as the top officials of the Taurida Province were concerned,\n\nand fairly critical in case of the Russian bureaucracy at large. Thus, the rank and-file government official is depicted in the travelogues as a trivial saboteur bureaucrat whereas the high ranking officials are viewed by the foreign travelers as the ones who are behind all that was achieved by the Russian authorities in\n\nCrimea and as the engine of progress, with the rank-and-file corrupt bureaucrat depicted as standing in the way of Russia’s advance to progress.\n\nWhy exactly did Moscow send an as sophisticated and high-flying missile as the Buk missile to Ukraine when such a weapon was not necessary to shoot down lower flying Ukrainian military planes?

What is so far missing in Western debates of the incident is proper consideration of the predominant explanation proposed by various more or less competent Russian and Ukrainian researchers of the incident. Many East European investigators of the circumstances of the shooting believe that the only full explanation for the arrival of the Russian BUK in the Donbas in July 2014 was that Moscow indeed wanted to shoot down a high-flying passenger plane. Yet, the Kremlin wanted to shoot not a Malaysian airliner, but a Russian one. The responsibility for the shooting of a Russian passenger plane over Eastern Ukraine would have been ascribed to the Ukrainian armed forces, with reference to Ukraine’s accidental shooting of a Russian passenger plane, Siberian Airlines 1812, in October 2001. The horrible incident and blaming of Kyiv in July 2014 would have provided Moscow with a casus belli to implement its \"Novorossiia” (New Russia) project – i.e. the annexation of Russophone Eastern and Southern mainland Ukraine via an invasion of regular Russian military forces.\n\nВосстановлена биография государственного деятеля первой половины XIX в.

That’s why biographies of Russian governors of the past are of great scientific interest. Political biographies of Taurida governors in the period when this governorate itself was very recently established are of particular interest to both historians and political scientists.\n\nThe subject matter of our article is biography of a statesman Dmitry Naryshkin, who was Taurida governor in the first half of the 19th c., his relationship with his cousin, patron and immediate superior in the administrative hierarchy of the Russian Empire Count Mikhail Vorontsov. So, in our article, using source analysis and prosopologic approach, we trace both early stages of Dmitry Naryskin’s career and the characteristic features of his activities as Taurida governor.\n\nDuring this period, Count Mikhail Vorontsov, who was Novorossiya Governor-General, played the main role in region governance. All Naryshkin’s administrative decisions were made only after consultation with Vorontsov. So, Taurida governor was only the administrant of Vorontsov’s projects and plans, and rarely showed his own initiative. Nevertheless, during Dmitry Naryshkin’s governorship, Simferopol became a true center of the province, and the challenging bit of road between Simferopol and Alushta was constructed.\n\nBased on archival documents and memoirs of contemporaries, we conclude that Dmitry Naryshkin was feckless administrator, but Mikhail Vorontsov’s attention to Taurida Governorate contributed to the stable development of the region.\n\nn the basis of various historical data and other sources, the biography of the statesman of the XIX century D.

Стварање државног идентитета Новорусије је процес који се и даље одвија, те је циљ овог истраживања анализа тог феномена. Данас Новорусија више није само савез двеју самопроглашених република у Доњецкој и Луганској области на истоку Украјине, већ идеја повратка \"општеруским начелима\" кроз обнову руског језика, културе, моралних вредности и савеза евроазијских народа. Овај процес је заснован на концепту неоевроазијства, као геополитички и историјски утемељеној идеји реинте-грације постсовјетског и руског империјалног простора. Културна подршка том пројекту јесте руски концепт мултикултурализма, тј. \"Руски свет\" (Русский мир) заснован на руском језику, ћириличном писму и суживоту различитих етничких група. Појмови Новорусија, Мала Русија, Велика Русија и Украјина су објашњени из историјске перспективе, док је Придњестровље (Транснистрија) анализирано као претеча друштвено-политичког модела Новору-сије. Коришћење новинских извора и литературе о геополитичкој ситуацији у свету, указује да се стварање државног идентитета Но-ворусије уклапа у начела мултиполарног и мултиетничког света. Као што је грађански рат у царској Русији избрисао са историјске сцене појам Новорусије, тако је и грађански рат у Украјини довео на сцену исти тај појам.\n\nThis paper deals with the case of revival and instrumentalization of the territory of Novorussiya, originally a historical region at the southwestern border of the former Russian Empire. The process of creating Novorussiya’s state identity is still carried out, hence the aim of this research is the analysis of that phenomenon. Nowadays Novorussiya is no longer just an alliance of two self-proclaimed republics at Donetsk and Lugansk regions in the eastern part of Ukraine, but the idea of returning to the \"general Russian principles\" through the renewal of the Russian language, culture, moral values and the alliance of the Eurasian people. This process is based upon the concept of the neo-Eurasianism as geopolitical and historically founded idea of the reintegration of the post-Soviet and Russian imperial space. Cultural background for this project is the Russian concept of multiculturalism, i.e. the \"Russian World\" (Russian: Русский мир). This concept is based upon the Russian language, the Cyrillic alphabet and the coexistence of different ethnic groups. The notions of Novorussiya, Little Russia, Great Russia, and Ukraine were also explained from a historical perspective, while Pridnestrovye (Transnistria) has been analyzed as a precursor to the socio-political model of Novorussiya. This model encompasses multi-ethnicity, separation from the previous nation-state, pro-Russian position as well as economic and cultural self-sufficiency. The usage of the news sources and literature about geopolitical situation in the world indicates that the creation of Novorossiya’s state identity fits the principles of multi-ethnic and multi-polar world. As the civil war in Imperial Russia erased the notion of Novorossiya from the historical stage, so the civil war in Ukraine brought the same notion back. Hence, this study may provide a new impetus for future research that will direct its attention to the current social and cultural processes in Eurasia.\n\nStella Ghervas, a Jaroslaw and Mihaychuk Postdoctoral Research Fellow at HURI, will present some of her recent research at the Seminar in Ukrainian Studies on Monday, April 24.

Her work challenges the idea that the Black Sea space naturally leads to conflict and nationalism, while assessing economic development, population increases, and growth of cities during a time of \"thawed\" relations.\n\nOn Monday, her talk, \"Calming the Waters? Toward a New History of the Black Sea,\" will examine the history and historiography of the Black Sea.

Gajewski found in the State Archives of the Odessa Region, shows the position one of the city government Tauridа province the first half of the XIX century. Feodosia in the first quarter of the XIX century are far from being the best of times. Sunset era Kafa with her slave markets. Port lost strategic importance, giving the palm Odessa. Despite all the attempts of the government to revive the trade in the city, Feodosius remained a small provincial town. To revive its former value was established here gradonachalstva, which existed from October 8, 1802 by September 1, 1837. The town governor had almost the same functions as the civil governor. The freedom of action of these officials often led to serious abuses. An example is Feodosia. P. V. Gajewski, making the review entrusted to him by administrative unit, pointed to numerous violations in the work of government. Pavel Gajewski was born April 15, 1775 in the province of Poltava. In 1792 he graduated from the cadet\n\ncorps and as an aide to Rear Admiral A. N. Senyavin served on the boat, «Peter», took part in the fighting against the French in the Mediterranean. Was a member of the storming of the island Vado in 1812 consisted commander of the ship «Galeta» and adjutant Admiral V. P. Dezen, led by the office of the Chief of the Moldavian army A. A. Prozorovskiy. On June 22, 1815 was the head of the third branch of the Department of\n\nState Property. From 1st May 1820 was appointed Managing Kyiv share customs, and from January 10, 1821\n\nhe was appointed manager of Feodosia share customs. Feodosia was appointed town governor from December\n\n18, 1821 on July 8, 1822. P. V. Gajewski involved improving quarantine established safety committees. Such measures have been caused by the need to prevent the introduction of plague in the city. After he resigned as town governor, again led the customs, where he continued to serve until his death April 8, 1853 He served as town governor in 1829, the name of Gajewski in Feodosia was named one of the streets (now 8 Marta Street) and an ancient fountain (crossing the streets March 8 and Chapaev). Buried P. V. Gajewski in the family vault\n\nin the old Russian cemetery in Feodosia.\n\nNewfound town governor met serious violations of the magistrate, the office of the mayor, according to\n\npolice units. Exterior view of the city is poor: the streets were not cleaned, there was a shortage of drinking\n\nwater, the city flooded tramps. Manufactured buildings did not meet the urban plan. These and many other\n\nproblems require urgent solutions. Despite all the efforts of P. V. Gajewski and receiver A. I. Kaznacheev.\n\nFeodosia remained a small port town.\n\nKeywords: V. P.

Using a large set of visual data from a popular social networking site, Vkontakte, the authors employ content analysis to examine how the conflict was represented and interpreted in pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian online communities during the peak of violence in summer 2014. The findings point to the existence of profound differences in framing the conflict among pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian online communities. The former tended to interpret the conflict as a limited military action against local insurgents, whereas the latter presented it as an all-out war against the Russian population of Eastern Ukraine. The article suggests that framing the conflict through social media facilitated the propagation of mutually exclusive views on the conflict and led to the formation of divergent expectations in Ukraine and Russia concerning the outcome of the war in Donbas.\n\nThe Glazyev Tapes illustrate that the allegedly social regional rationale for far-reaching new political rules in the Donbas envisaged in the Minsk Agreements, a considerable reduction of Ukraine’s sovereignty in the currently occupied... more\n\nThe Glazyev Tapes illustrate that the allegedly social regional rationale for far-reaching new political rules in the Donbas envisaged in the Minsk Agreements, a considerable reduction of Ukraine’s sovereignty in the currently occupied territories‚ is slim. In other words, the peculiarities of the population of the occupied territories that would justify a special arrangement for the Donets Basin are more putative than real. An underlying assumption of the western interpretation of the concessions to the separatists in these agreements had been that the mere fact of an, at least, initially grassroots insurgency in the Donbas should be somehow reflected in its future status. Yet, the Glazyev Tapes now illustrate that the entire east Ukrainian uprising was from its start not as popular a phenomenon as it earlier seemed. If one acknowledges the Russian involvement in, and imperial rather than local dimension of, the insurgency, then the apparent compromise in the Minsk Agreements assumes a different notion."
