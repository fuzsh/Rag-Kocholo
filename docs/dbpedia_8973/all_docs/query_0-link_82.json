        "text": "Dissemination of fake information on the armed forces of the Russian Federation (Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code)\n\nPart 1, Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code\n\nPublic dissemination of deliberately false information containing data on the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for the purposes of defending the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, supporting international peace and security, as well as data on the exercising by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers outside the territory of the Russian Federation for the indicated purposes, as well as data on the provision of assistance by volunteer formations, organisations or individuals in the performance of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. This article was introduced into the Criminal Code in March 2022, the provision on the activities of government agencies abroad was added in April, and the provision on volunteer formations and assistance to the Armed Forces was added in March 2023. Initially, the maximum penalty was three years' imprisonment; in March 2023, the penalty was increased.\n\nTomsk\n\nViktor Lavrentiev, a retired police lieutenant colonel, 61.\n\nAccording to investigators, he published false information about the Russian army’s actions in Ukraine on social media according to «witnesses on the ground», in particular about the destruction of a maternity hospital in Mariupol by the Russian army. A court has ordered a ban on certain actions as a precautionary measure. Lavrentiev signed a non-disclosure agreement. On May 31, 2023, he was sentenced to a fine of one million rubles.\n\nSeversk (Tomsk region)\n\nMarina Novikova, lawyer, 64.\n\nAccording to investigators, she published false information on social media about the Russian army’s actions in Ukraine based on the words of «witnesses on the ground.» A court has ordered a ban on certain actions as a precautionary measure. In early October, 2022, Novikova’s health condition deteriorated significantly: after contracting the coronavirus, cardiac complications arose; during her hospitalisation, she was prescribed heart surgery and constant medical supervision. She motioned for a stay of the proceedings pending surgery and for permission to testify and answer questions while sitting down, but the court denied the motions. According to the case information on the court’s website, hearings continue to be scheduled regularly, but the defendant does not attend them. According to Novikova’s husband, she is constantly gasping for air and suddenly losing consciousness or spatial orientation. At the same time, the doctors at the local hospital insist that her state of health is good enough to participate in the proceedings. Novikova’s husband believes that this is the result of pressure from the prosecutor’s office. On April 28, 2023, Novikova was sentenced to a fine of one million rubles.\n\nProkopievsk (Kemerovo region)\n\nAndrey Novashov, journalist.\n\nThe Net Freedoms project, which represents Novashov, reported that the reason for the charges against him was his repost of Victoria Ivleva’s article «Mariupol.Blockade». An investigator offered him the chance to apologize «to the face of the armed forces» but he refused. The precautionary measure chosen was a ban on certain actions: namely, Novashov has been banned from using a phone and the Internet. On April 12th, 2022, the journalist received an official charge: it involved reposting a translated story by the Mariupol mayoral advisor Petro Andryushchenko about the seige of the city, in addition to the presence of four posts by Novashov himself on vk.com. In one of them, according to investigators, the journalist «distorts the purposes and tasks of the Russian armed forces» pointing at «the violence in the actions of the Russian armed forces» instead of stating that the military «is defending the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens through demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.» On March 6, 2023, he was sentenced to eight months of corrective labour through wage docking.\n\nMagas\n\nIsabella Yevloeva, journalist, former editor-in-chief of Fortanga.\n\nAt first, the media outlet reported that the grounds for her first felony charge was a post made on Yevloeva’s Telegram channel on March 23rd, 2022, where she called the Z sign «synonymous with aggression, death, pain, and unconscionable manipulation.» However, the decision to initiate criminal proceedings (available to the editor) mentions two posts that were made between March 5th and 9th. In the given period, Yevloeva twice wrote about Ingushetia residents that were taken hostage by Ukrainian troops, twice posted reports on losses, as well as her own text about Ingush residents who died in the war. There was also a post about an open letter with reflections on the situation in Ukraine that may have been authored by an FSB officer. Yevloeva is not in Russia.\n\nIn April 28th, it was made known that Yevloyeva is to be subject to another charge according to the same article due to her comments on the murders of civilians in Bucha.\n\nOn July 27th it became known that a third case against Yevloeva has been opened under the same article. This time, the grounds were a June 26th publication in Fortanga’s Telegram channel about the losses of the Russian army and an explosion in a Kremenchuk shopping center. Yevloeva was put on the wanted list. To try to get her to stop writing, security services put significant pressure on her relatives who remained in Ingushetia–searches of their homes, calling them in for questioning and many other forms of pressure.\n\nIslam Belokiev, blogger, 30.\n\nAccording to investigators, on March 7th, 2022, under the guise of reliable information, he disseminated «fakes» about the actions of the Russian armed forces: the reason for the prosecution was a video in which Belokiyev spoke about an Ingush soldier who had been captured in Ukraine. In 2021, a case concerning the rehabilitation of Nazism was brought against him, and later in January 2022 a case was opened concerning the public justification of terrorism. The court ordered Belokiev’s detention and he was put on an international wanted list.\n\nIn addition, another case was opened against Belokiev for rehabilitation of Nazism (Part 4, Article 354.1 of the Criminal Code), public calls for terrorism (Part 2, Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code) and participation in a military conflict on the territory of a foreign state contrary to the interests of the Russian Federation (Part 3, Article 208 of the Criminal Code). In March 2023, a case was opened against Belokiev for organising financing of terrorism: according to investigators, he, being a member of an ‘unlawful armed formation’ that participates in the Russian war against Ukraine on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, organised fundraising for the needs of the said formation.\n\nPreviously it was reported that an unknown person was facing felony charges in Ingushetia. Most likely, this was Isabella Yevloeva.\n\nNovosibirsk\n\nIrina Tolmacheva, civil activist and ex-chair of the Alliance of Teachers, 32.\n\nThe case was initiated because of a comment posted on the page of Novosibirsk city council authority Sergey Boyko. The comment stated that the Russian Ministry of Defense does not acknowledge the facts concerning the number of Russian military deaths in Ukraine. Tolmacheva states that she posted this comment on March 3rd, 2022, one day before the introduction of Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code. The indictment said that she had made the post on March 4th. She signed an agreement not to leave and agreed to collaborate with the investigation. On September 22, the court returned the case to the prosecutor to clarify the exact time the post was made and the time zone difference between Moscow and Novosibirsk. In December, the case was brought back to court again. On June 7, 2023, during the hearing, the prosecutor requested that Tolmacheva be sentenced to two years' imprisonment, stating that she had committed a crime of moderate gravity. Tolmacheva replied that it was considered a minor offence at the time the case was opened. The prosecutor then asked for a sentence of ten months of correctional labour. On July 6, the court sentenced Tolmacheva to nine months of correctional labour.\n\nElena Tardasova-Yun, activist, adherent to the ideology of the «Citizens of the USSR» movement, 52.\n\nAccording to her passport, her surname is Yun. She was detained after a search. The reason for initiating the case was a repost of a WhatsApp message about a memorial service in the village of Mashkovo for a soldier who had died in Ukraine in a public group on Vkontakte. The author of the original message wrote that a thousand coffins had arrived in Novosibirsk. Tardasova-Yun was released after signing an agreement not to leave. However, she denied that any precautionary measure was enforced. On August 3rd, 2022, she was detained in Prokopyevsk (Kemerovo region) and transferred to Novosibirsk for interrogation. The following day contact with her was lost. On August 5th, information appeared that the court banned Tardasova-Yun from certain actions as a precautionary measure. On December 26, Tardasova-Yun was placed in pretrial detention because she had supposedly posted two videos on her social media page, thereby violating the pretrial restrictions banning her from engaging in certain activities. Her lawyer said that at the time of the posts her pretrial restrictions had already expired–they were imposed for the duration of the investigation, and the investigation had already concluded. On February 22nd, 2023, Tardasova-Yun was sentenced to 11 months of corrective labour through wage docking, and was released from custody in the courtroom\n\nShe is represented by OVD-Info attorney Elena Chirkina.\n\nEvgeny Fokin, 18. A minor at the moment the prosecution started and ended.\n\nAccording to investigators, an adolescent wrote a comment to a post in the «Novosibirsk Coalition 2020» Telegram chat. It subsequently became known that the case was in connection to a repost of a publication by Mikhail Podolyak, advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, about the killing of civilians by the Russian military during the seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Several linguistic examinations showed the «absence of statements of verifiable facts» in the repost. On November 7th, 2022, the court dismissed the case, ordering the teenager to be supervised by his mother for a month from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.\n\nHelga Pirogova, city council representative, 34.\n\nA case has been brought forward in connection with a tweet she posted on July 15th, 2022, which included an emotional comment on a Mediazona article about Russian army volunteers who died in Ukraine. Head of the regional legislative assembly Andrey Panferov wrote to the prosecutor’s office demanding the launch of the case. By that moment the tweet had already been deleted. On July 21st, Pirogova was detained after a charity auction and brought to the police, who administered a charge of discrediting the Russian army (Part 1, Article 20.3.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences). However, the following day, head of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin demanded a criminal case be launched, which was done immediately. Pirogova has left Russia and was placed on a wanted list. On August 15th, the administrative case concerning a tweet by Pirogova was halted. Later, another charge was added to the case–an interview she gave to the television channel «Dozhd» in which she talked about the criminal case against her. Two expert witnesses did not find any information about the Russian military’s activities or negative opinions about them in her statements. Earlier, cases of fraud were brought forward against Pirogova’s assistants (Part 1, Article 159 of the Criminal Code), see below. In June 2023, Pirogova was stripped of her parliamentary mandate.\n\nKopeysk (Chelyabinsk region)\n\nPyotr Borovinskikh, 46\n\nAccording to investigators, the grounds for launching this case were posts made about the shelling of Mariupol on Borovinskikh’s page «Kopeysk without Putin’s fascism» on «VKontakte.» Later, a case was brought against Borovinskikh concerning disrespect for the Days of Military Glory and commemorative dates related to the defense of the Fatherland (Part 4, Article 354.1 of the Criminal Code) and on discrediting the Russian armed forces (Part 1, Article 280.3 of the Criminal Code, see below).\n\nSterlitamak\n\nRaisa Boldova, 61, a Russian language tutor.\n\nAccording to investigators, «on a social media platform» she posted photos and videos that contained «the signs of public spreading of knowingly false information» about the «special operation» in Ukraine. In the videos and comments she talked about the airstrike on a Mariupol maternity hospital which led to the death of a pregnant woman and about the frequent shelling of Mariupol by the Russian army. In December 2022, Boldova was ordered to undergo an outpatient psychiatric evaluation. On February 22, 2023 she received a one-year suspended sentence of corrective labour through wage docking.\n\nBoldova is being represented by OVD-Info lawyer Aidar Khyzyrov.\n\nUssuriisk (Primorsky krai)\n\nFedor Erbes, taxi driver, previously served in the Guards Air Assault Brigade, 28.\n\nAccording to investigators, an unidentified man promoted a «video that discredited the Russian military forces» in a messenger app which showed destroyed cities in Donbas and destroyed Russian military equipment, and had audio of two conversations between soldiers. The conversations told of losses among servicemen and difficulties they face trying to retreat from the frontlines. He has been detained and it is claimed that he «admitted» that the video was indeed «a fake.» He was released after signing an agreement to appear at first notice. On August 2nd, 2022, Erbes was sentenced to six months of corrective labor through wage docking.\n\nNaberezhnie Chelny\n\nSergei Novokreshchennykh, 48.\n\nAccording to investigators, between February 24 and March 6, 2022, he posted «non-credible information about the special operation in Ukraine» on vk.com — these were comments on a video characterising the actions of the Russian military in Ukraine as criminal. Novokreshchennykh was also charged under an article on incitement to hatred (Part 2, Article 282 of the Criminal Code) — on the basis of the comments of June 26 and July 2, 2021, which contained certain signs of humiliation of human dignity. In court, Novokreshchennykh stated that he was drunk when he wrote all the comments. On the first episode, he partially pleaded guilty, but noted that he did not remember that he had «humiliated anyone’s dignity», on the second episode, concerning «fakes», the man did not plead guilty. On March 24, 2023, he was sentenced to three years and one month’s suspended imprisonment. On May 16, the court of appeal commuted the sentence to six months of corrective labour.\n\nRuslan Ganeev, web developer, 39.\n\nThe case was initiated for two comments on VKontakte made in March 2022. In the first, he stated that «according to NATO intelligence, the Russian army is beginning to retreat from Kyiv», and in the second expressed his opinion about the number of killed civilians and soldiers in Ukraine. The prosecution refers to several videos of Russian Ministry of Defence briefings which took place between February 24th and March 30th, 2022, as proof that Ganeev’s statements were false. The case went to court, but Ganeev did not appear at the first hearing. The case was then suspended because the defendant fled. Once Ganeev was taken into custody, the proceedings resumed. On March 6, 2023, he was sentenced to 10 months of corrective labour through wage docking.\n\nMarat Yagudin\n\nIn October 2022 he was fined under the article of the Code of Administrative Offences about discrediting the army (Article 20.3.3 part 1). A criminal case was opened over comments published on VKontakte on March 19 and May 18. Yagudin pleaded guilty, saying that at the time he posted the comments he disagreed with the deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine and decided to express his dissatisfaction in this way. He published a public apology in the form of advertisements in three issues of the city newspaper and also donated 5,000 rubles to a charity fund for children with leukaemia. During the proceedings, Yagudin was on personal recognisance. On July 13, 2023, he was sentenced to six months of corrective labour.\n\nOlovyannaya small town (Zabaikalsky krai)\n\nPyotr Mylnikov, civic activist.

Mylnikov told Meduza that the case concerns two documents: one of them says that the bodies of war casualties are to be burned, and the other «that the most ideologically motivated guys from Yunarmiya will be conscripted to the war as soon as they turn 18.» He has confessed. On May 30th, 2022, he was sentenced to a fine of one million rubles.\n\nVoronezh\n\nNina Belyaeva, an ex-member of People’s Deputies Council of Semiluki District of the Voronezh Region, 33.\n\nAccording to investigators, on March 22nd, 2022, at the meeting of the Semilukskiy District Council, she «spreaded knowingly false information about the progress of the special military operation in Ukraine under the guise of reliable information.» She was also claimed to have made «insults towards Russian military men, ” condemning their actions. She is currently located outside of Russia. She has been placed on a wanted list. In July 2022, Belyaeva announced that she steps down from the position of council representative.\n\nLater it became known that Belyaeva was also suspected of inciting terrorism (Part 2, Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code). The grounds were apparently her interview with Ukrainian blogger Rostislav Kalatsinsky, in which she allegedly «publicly expressed calls for a violent change of power» in Russia.\n\nOn June 27th, 2022, the Investigative Committee reported that the deputy was arrested in absentia. The report noted that she was accused of two crimes under this article.\n\nOrenburg\n\nIvan Moskalenko, 23.\n\nAccording to investigators, on March 25th, 2022, the young man made a video and social media posts «with knowingly false information under the guise of credible information» related to the war in Ukraine.

According to investigators, on April 11th, 2022, an unidentified man «made posts on the Internet with statements that consisted of knowingly false information about the actions of the Russian armed forces under the guise of reliable information.» In addition, a case was launched concerning the spread of information on the Internet about the military glory days and other commemorated dates in Russia related to defending the Fatherland, which expressed «a pronounced disrespect to society» (Part 4, Article 354.1 of the Criminal Code). According to investigators, a Tyumen resident uploaded an image of Hitler onto the «Immortal regiment» website that collects photos of Great Patriotic War heroes. The investigators claim that the man has admitted his guilt. He is being held in a pre-trial detention center. On July 21st, 2022, he was sentenced to 6 months in a colony. He was released on August 8th the same year. Eichendorf later recounted that, during his home detention in May, security forces kicked him and taped his mouth shut when he started calling for help.

Belova posted a video recording of a conversation with the head physician Olga Korennova and the head of the personnel department on her VKontakte page. In the video, they say that the Ministry of Health received instructions to dismiss the activist, so she had to choose between work and politics. The publication of the video became the formal reason for terminating the contract: the management of the dispensary accused Belova of disclosing personal data by showing what Korennova looked like. Later, the court refused to reinstate her at her job. On the night of November 2, 2022, Belova was taken to the Department of Counteracting Extremism, where she gave explanations about her regular anti-war publications. She was then released without a violation writeup.

Is it possible to build a strong state on lies and on the bones of other people’s children?», and also: «And the cluster bombs and calibres you are throwing at people, schools and theatres? Are they authorised? Or did the Ukrainian forces put the markings on them themselves? It is so disgusting to see these lies when you know the details of the truth.

The report reads that Klokov resisted and that physical force as well as means of restraint were used against him. He was placed in a pre-trial detention center on the 18th of March. According to lawyer Daniil Berman, the prosecution’s ruling of the case states that Klokov disseminated false information during a telephone conversation, not publicly. Later it became known that, according to case materials, Klokov told his colleagues and friends over the phone that Russia has evacuated wounded military men to Belarus and understates the numbers of casualties. He also is claimed to have stated that Russian military men killed civilians and that Ukraine is, in fact, not «run by Nazis.» Additionally, he was allegedly planning to organize a phone conversation between his Russian colleagues and an acquaintance from Kyiv. Security forces informed Berman that Klokov declined the lawyer’s services. However, later Klokov signed an agreement with Berman. It was only in June that it emerged that the wiretapping of Klokov’s telephone conversations, which had triggered the case, had been authorised by Denis Ignatyev, a judge of the Moscow Regional Court, on January 28, 2022. This was allegedly linked to the murder of police officers almost 20 years ago and the fact that Klokov’s father worked with their alleged killer, Vladislav Stepanov. The investigation considered the phone conversations to be public because there were several of them. On August 10, the court sent the case back to the prosecutor’s office, but later the case returned to the court.

According to investigators, According to investigators, «he conspired with persons that managed his actions from abroad to provide technical support and secretly install mobile devices in one of Moscow’s malls.» These devices facilitated «the remotely controlled mass mailing by unidentified persons of knowingly false information concerning the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, including the information about murders of civilians, to Russian mobile communications subscribers, » «as well as information about replenishing troop numbers with reservists, conscripts, foreign fighters and schoolchildren.» Giraldo Saray is being held in a pre-trial detention center.

According to investigators, on March 15th, 2022, «in a public speech in front of the members of Arizona House of Representatives, motivated by political hatred, Kara-Murza disseminated knowingly false information under the guise of credible information, which consisted information about the use of objects of social infrastructure by the Russian armed forces when bombing residential areas, including maternity hospitals, hospitals and schools, as well as the use of prohibited weapons and methods of warfare during the special military operation in Ukraine. Through this, he caused a significant damage to the interests of the Russian Federation.» He is in custody. On the same day, Kara Murza was placed on the «foreign agent» list. Previously, he had been given a 15 days arrest charged with disobedience to the lawful order of a police officer (Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences). On July 13th, 2022, another criminal case was opened against Kara-Murza for participating in activities of an «undesirable organization». This case was not connected with his anti-war position, instead it was in relation to a conference he had hosted in October 2021 in support of Russian political prisoners, allegedly funded by the Free Russia Foundation. However, the case was combined with his case on «fakes.»\n\nOn October 6, 2022, a criminal case was opened against Kara-Murza for treason (Article 275 of the Criminal Code). He was indicted the same day. It later emerged that the politician was charged for a speech he gave in Lisbon on October 8, 2021, about the illegitimacy of electoral campaigns in Russia, including the upcoming presidential election in 2024; a speech he gave in Oslo on October 29, the same year, at the Norwegian Helsinki Committee’s award ceremony for historian Yuri Dmitriev about state terror in Russia and politically motivated killings; and a speech he gave at a hearing of the U.S. Helsinki Commission on March 29, 2022, about the «information iron curtain» in Russia and the need for citizens to have access to the truth about the war in Ukraine. The case is awaiting trial. Judge Sergei Podoprigorov of the Second Western District Military Court, who is hearing the Kara-Murza case, was previously on the «Magnitsky List», which the politician worked on and lobbied for the adoption of the relevant law in the US. While in solitary confinement, the politician began to lose sensitivity in his limbs. On March 16, 2023, the medical staff of the pre-trial detention centre prevented Kara-Murza from attending the trial until the end of his treatment. On April 17, he was sentenced to 25 years in a strict regime penal colony. In June, it became known that Kara-Murza had stopped receiving some of the letters. On June 25, Alexei Melnikov, secretary of the Moscow Public Monitoring Commission, said that the letters had been handed over to Kara-Murza. Immediately after his transfer to the colony in September, the politician was placed in a pre-trial detention centre. The officers told him that he would not be released to the camp because he «would infect all prisoners with his views».\n\nElena Kotenochkina, the head of the Krasnoselsky municipal district, 45, and Alexey Gorinov, a deputy of Krasnoselsky municipal district, 61.\n\nThe case is filed under Paragraphs «A», «B», and «E», Part 2, Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code (pertaining to the use of one’s official position, of conspiracy and motivations of hatred). According to investigators, on a March 15th, 2022, meeting of the Deputy Council, Kotenochkina and Gorinov disseminated knowingly false information «about aggressive military actions conducted by the Russian Federation in the territory of an independent state, calling these actions „a war“ and not „a special military operation, ” about the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army „with the intentions to conquer its territory, destroy its independence, and change its political and social regimes, ” about the daily killing of children in the war with Ukraine, as well as calling the Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine, „as the element of the state power, the actions of a fascist state.“ In addition, prior to March 16th, Kotenochkina recorded a video „about a large number of Russian conscription officers sent to war zones in the territory of Ukraine.“ Gorinov has been detained and is being held in a pre-trial detention center. Kotenochkina had left Russia. She was put on an international wanted list and arrested in absentia. On May 5th, the court limited the time for Gorinov’s familiarization with the case until May 6th. It has to be considered that Gorinov was allowed to start familiarizing himself with the case only on May 4th and on May 5th he spent more than half a day in court. The Moscow Helsinki Group reported that at the pre-trial detention center he is kept in inhumane conditions. There are 7 more people in the same cell with Gorinov even though the cell is designed for four people. He has also had to sleep on the concrete floor. On July 8th, 2022, Gorinov was sentenced to 7 years in a penal colony. In September, it became known that the appeal hearing would be closed to the public. Later, the court’s presiding officer announced that the decision had been made in the interests of safety, since the judge who originally sentenced him in the Meshchansky court in Moscow had received threats. On September 19th, the appeals court reduced Gorinov’s sentence by one month, changing the charge from dissemination of information by conspiracy to dissemination by a group of persons. In December information emerged that Gorinov was being denied medical treatment in prison. After the story became public, Gorinov was transferred to the hospital of a neighboring prison facility. On June 29, 2023, Gorinov said in a letter that he was woken up every two hours at night in the pre-trial detention centre to check whether he had escaped.\n\nKotenochkina’s case is already in court.\n\nIn October, Gorinov was placed in a pre-trial detention centre: it emerged that a new case had been opened against him — for publicly justifying terrorism (Part 1, Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code).\n\nKotenochkina’s interests are represented by Tatiana Solomina, a lawyer from OVD-Info.\n\nRuslan Leviev (Karpuk), 36 and Michael Nacke, 29, journalists.\n\nSince February 24th, 2022, they have posted daily news reports about the ongoing war.

The case is filed under Paragraph «C», Part 2, Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code (the public dissemination of false information about the actions of the Russian armed forces under the guise of credible information with the artificial creation of accusatory evidence). According to investigators, in the video «The war. Results of day 90, » Leviev and Nacke skeptical addressed the Defence Ministry position that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was shelled by the Ukrainian forces. The video also included fragments that meant to show that the Russian army is destroying cities and killing civilians. Leviev and Nacke are currently outside Russia and have been placed on a wanted list. They are both arrested in absentia and their property has been seized. On September 9th, 2022, the Ministry of Justice placed Nacke on the «foreign agent» list. On November 18th, Leviev was placed on the same list.

The reason for the prosecution was a stream on March 9, 2022, on the YouTube channel «Popular Politics», in which Leviyev spoke about a Russian airstrike on a hospital in Mariupol. A second criminal case, also concerning «fakes» about the armed forces motivated by political hatred, was brought against Nacke in connection with the video «Special airing | Preparing to storm Kiev | Mariupol Drama Theatre» dated March 16, 2022. Later, all the cases were consolidated. In the final indictment, the Prosecutor’s Office also included paragraph «b» of Part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code (dissemination of «fakes» by a group of persons).

The court is processing the case. After a court hearing in January 2023, one of the escorting officers beat Ivanov. Letters from Ivanov from the pre-trial detention centre do not reach their addressees due to censorship. On March 7, Ivanov was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison.

It should be noted that these charges were brought against Velichko before Article 207.3 was added to the Criminal Code.\n\nOn April 26, Velichko was detained in Moscow.

However, it later emerged that Vyrypayev had been charged with spreading 'fakes' with a motive of political hatred (Paragraph «e», Part 2, Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code).

A case was initiated against Rodnyansky for spreading false information about the Russian army with a motive of political hatred (Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). The case was triggered by three Instagram posts and one Telegram post about the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, the killing of Ukrainian civilians by the Russian military, and attacks by the Russian army on civilian targets in Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.On April 27, 2023, Rodnyansky was arrested in absentia and is presumed to be on the wanted list.

According to the investigation, Sokolovskaya spread this information «in the period from March to May 2022 <…> in a Telegram channel, where it was openly accessible to an unlimited number of people, under the guise of reliable reports». Sokolovskaya’s Moscow flat was searched. According to the media group RBC, she and her family left Russia for Europe after the start of the war.\n\nYuri Sipko, pastor, former chairman of the Russian Union of Evangelical Christians-Baptists, 71.\n\nAccording to the investigation, in March 2022, Sipko «posted a video clip on a video hosting site, making it accessible to an unlimited number of people, which, according to a psychological and linguistic study, contains knowingly false information about the actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine». A case was initiated against him for dissemination of knowingly false information motivated by hatred (Paragraph «E», Part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code). Sipko has left Russia. His home was searched and his son was questioned as a witness. The Investigative Committee also reports that searches took place at the homes of some of Sipko’s «associates» in Moscow and Kaluga.\n\nAnna Bazhutova (YokoBovich), a Twitch streamer.\n\nThe reason for her prosecution was a Twitch stream aired in June 2023, in which, according to the official version, she read the stories of the residents of Bucha, wrote on a cardboard that 300 people in Bucha were killed by Russian soldiers, uttered the phrase «death to the Russian occupiers, ” and, in addition, called for the „killing“ of the „Russian people“ responsible for that.

Kurshin’s case is based on two posts published in his Telegram channel in autumn 2022: one was on the topic of a missile attack on a dam at a reservoir near Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, the other to the bombarding of a maternity hospital in the Zaporizhia region of Ukraine. The case was initiated under the article on the dissemination of «fake facts» with the motive of hatred (item «d» part 2, art. 207.3 of the Criminal Code). Kurshin pleaded guilty, but denied the hate motive. He has been placed under house arrest. On October 4, law enforcement officers in Volgograd searched the home of Elena Penchuk, the former administrator of the Moscow Calling channel. The reason was that Kurshin had allegedly been writing messages to her for a month, in violation of the ban on using the Internet.

The person who wrote to her from a new account introduced himself as Kurshin and offered to return to work, but she refused.\n\nKonstantin Seleznev, 62.\n\nThe case was initiated following two posts on VKontakte: in one of them he copied his own letter to the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation where he talked about the UN report «on the crimes of Russian soldiers in three regions of Ukraine». In the other post he criticised the Russian president for awarding an honorary title to the 53rd anti-aircraft brigade and mentioned that soldiers of another, the 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade, which Putin awarded the title of Guards Brigade, were accused of mass crimes in Bucha.

On February 25, 2022, he resigned from the Church and soon after left Russia with his family.\n\nThe case was initiated under Paragraph «E», Part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code (concerning motives of hate). The grounds for this charge were posts on VKontakte in which Bayev, according to investigators, wrote that the Ukrainian military «sent 17, 500 orcs to the afterlife» and «Putin’s entourage is afraid to tell him the truth.» As of March 11, Bayev has been banned from serving as a priest by decree of the diocesan bishop.

A charge was brought forward regarding the dissemination of false information about the actions of the Russian armed forces, motivated by political hatred towards the head of state (Paragraph «E», Part 2, Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code). According to investigators, on their personal pages at vk.com, they posted images and videos that contained «knowingly false information concerning the purposes, tasks and methods of the special military operation on the territory of Bucha in Kyiv region.» Richard Rose is under pressure to confess, receiving threats from security officers that Maria could be transferred to a pre-trial detention center, that their son would be taken to an orphanage, that Richard himself would be deemed «untouchable», and that in general his conditions would become unbearable. In addition, the investigator announced that lawyer Inna Kosheleva could no longer defend him. Rose refused to answer any questions about the case or perform procedural actions in the presence of a public attorney after that.

On her page, they also found photographs of murdered women in Hostomel, a video titled „Russofascists will pay with their lives for hunting Ukrainians“ and other posts about the war. Richard Rose was also investigated under this article. On October 12, the pre-trial restrictions on Maria Rose were removed. In December it became known that another case had been opened against Rose for public justification of terrorism (Part 2, Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code). The reason for the case was the publication on Rose’s Instagram of a video of Ukrainian musician Svyatoslav Vakarchuk calling to stop the war, with the comment: „There is only one way to stop Putler — physically kill him.“ In one of his court hearings, Rose said that during his arrest, officers beat him badly.
