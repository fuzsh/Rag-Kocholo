Since the presentation date was 2014-08-13, it can be considered the adoption date as well, until more information is available.\n\nTomislav Todorovic, 8 September 2014\n\nNovorossiya formally called (Federal State of Novorossiya) has its current flag called the Federal State Flag. It was adopted on August 13, 2014 (as mentioned by Tomislav Todorovic above). It was presented by the speaker of its parliament Oleg Tsarev. It resembles the Romanov flag, the national flag of the Russian Empire from 1858 to 1883.\n\nNovorossiya is an unrecognised confederation of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, claiming the territory of the respective Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.\n\nOn 15 May 2014 the Russian on-line newspaper Vzglyad (Russian: взгляд) (www.vz.ru) noted that the then Governor of the Donetsk People's Republic, Pavel Gubarev, had announced the start of voting for a flag of the proposed state of Novorossiya. As of 11 July 2014 the Novorossiya website invites its readers to vote for one of eleven proposed flag designs for New Russia – with Option 1 the red-blue Saint Andrew's saltire.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the white-yellow-black tricolour as the national flag, the saltire was then adopted as the War Flag of the Republic.\n\nThe former flag, the saltire, was adopted first on May 24, 2014 as national flag and later on August 13, 2014 as war flag (and also as flag for the United Armed Forces of Novorossiya). The flag bears a strong, striking resemblance to that of the Confederate States of America's navy jack and battle flag (again, something that Tomislav Todorovic pointed out above). However, Pavliv explains that he had simply stumbled upon the flag online somewhere, and that the leader of the New Russia Party, Pavel Gubarev, later picked it up. Gubarev has since stated that the inspiration for the flag came from \"banners used by Cossacks who reclaimed the New Russian territories from Tatars and Turks for Russia in the 18th century\"; however according to Alexey Eremenko of the Moscow Times, no Cossacks ever used a flag resembling the one chosen. (source)\n\nAntonio Martins mentioned as early as August 15, 1999 that \"Novorossiya\" (HOBOPOCCNR) means \"New Russia\". This New Russia name was actually picked and a political party was established as well, the New Russia Party (Russian: Партия Новороссия; Partiya Novorossiya), is a political party in Ukraine founded by Russian separatists, under the leadership of Pavel Gubarev on May 13, 2014 as the \"Social-Political Movement – Party of New Russia\" in Donetsk. The emblem of the party actually bears the name HOBOPOCCNR and the party flag is also the war flag of Novorossiya (the country). The New Russia Party plays an important role in the politics of unrecognized Federal State of Novorossiya. The prospective government structure and political programme of the new unrecognized state were outlined in the official programme of the New Russia Party, proclaimed at Donetsk and published online on 23 May 2014. (source)\n\nThe United Armed Forces of Novorossiya, formerly the Donbass People's Militia and the Army of the South-East, are both militias and armed volunteer groups affiliated with the Union of Novorossiya. It is regarded as a terrorist group by the Ukrainian government. When it was called \"Donbass People's Militia\", it was mostly active in the Donetsk Oblast.\n\nThe United Armed Forces of Novorossiya were formally established on March 3, 2014 and the armed wing of the Lugansk People's Republic, the Army of the South-East, was \"United Armed Forces of Novorossiya\".\n\nThe flag of the United Armed Forces of Novorossiya is thus the saltire (or St. Andrew's Cross), seen here (the flag is seen in this BBC news video at 2:50 toghether with the flag of the Donbass Militia flag).\n\nEsteban Rivera, 21 October 2014\n\nThe denomination is \"Newrussia\" (Ukrainian: Новоросія). A movement, first started as a political party (May 22, 2014) was quickly declared\n\na new government, when the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) signed a document (most likely a\n\nMOU, Memorandum of Understanding) on May 24 which is considered the foundation date. Furthermore, the announcement of the\n\nestablishment of a \"People's Front\" or \"Popular Front\" between Russian and Ukrainian activists, political movements and parties as well as\n\nunions, was to be set up to further support this cause (source, source).\n\nThe location was intended to be much larger than it currently is, according to its leader Pavel Gubarev (who is the leader of the\n\nPeople's Militia of Donbass, and who put it first on his Facebook profile, after which it was seen in printed media), also acknowledging the fact that both current breakaway Republics, DPR (April 7, 2014 – February 24, 2022)\n\nand LPR (April 27, 2014 – February 24, 2022) are considered de facto defunct due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine (2014/2022 – onwards) conflict.\n\nThis entity was in existence between May 24, 2014 until May 18, 2015 when the so called \"project Newrussia\" was halted indefinitely,\n\nattempted to be revived shortly on June 15, 2016 although completely discarded (source).\n\nThey first used the St. Andrews cross (blue) / Russian Naval Ensign, but then the Novorossiya (red and blue). There was a variant in use\n\nfeaturing the name (inscription on top in Ukrainian) (source).\n\nThe LPR was first displayed to the public on May 9, 2014 (source).\n\nThe now Novorossiya (Former Flag) was adopted on May 31, 2014 and was designed by Maxim Pavlin (source).\n\nPlease see also Lugansk People's Republic (Ukraine) Overview.\n\nEsteban Rivera, 3 July 2023\n\nNovorossiya (Former Flag)\n\nAnt�nio Martins-Tuv�lkin, 19 August 2017\n\nI'm attaching a picture of a rally in Ukraine. Please note the \"Red St Andrew's Flag\". I hadn't seen that flag before. There are many other flags, some already known, others not so. I'm enclosing also my rendition of the said flag and that of the Airborne Troops with a yellow parachute.\n\nHB, 1 June 2014\n\nThe \"Red St Andrew's Flag\" is of course the Novo Rossiya flag we have been seeing.\n\nRob Raeside, 1 June 2014\n\nNovorossiya (1992)\n\n1) image by António Martins, 19 October 2000\n\n2) image by Jarig Bakker, 6 July 2001\n\nThe Russian ethnic republic in Ukraine was named Novorossiya and was proclaimed c. 1992 but fall some days after. Flag of red with Ukrainian colors below could be used but is not confirmed (some reports from Ukraine say that the Russian hoisted also old Ukrainian SSR flag without hammer and sickle at a larger collection of flags with the Russian colors in several arrangements) No more details are known to me.\n\nJaume Ollé, 14 August 1999\n\n\"Novorossiya\" (something like HOBOPOCCNR) means \"New Russia\". Quite inappropriate, considering that deepest roots of Russian history are found precisely in the territory of nowadays Ukraine ...\n\nAnyway, was this \"republic\" supposed to be a part of newly independent Ukraine (like the current status of Crimea), a genuine independent state, or an escape to grab territory from Ukraine to Russia? And where was it territorially based, if anywhere in special? (I guess that in NE Ukraine).\n\nFlag of red with Ukrainian colors below can be used but I doubt it: The 2R-1B-1Y horizontal would have been preferred by moderated Ukrainian communists. The old Ukrainian SSR flag without hammer and sickle at a larger collection of flags with the Russian colors in several arrangements is more probable, like the flags used by the Russian population of Crimea – probably the same people waving the same flags, after all, this \"Novorossiya\" would include Crimea, where Ukrainians are minority.\n\nAntónio Martins, 15 August 1999\n\nThe name refers to the territory along the Black Sea coast – now partly in northeastern Ukraine – that was annexed from Turkey between 1774 and 1792 and actively colonized by ethnic Russians (and also Germans) in the late 18th – early 19th century. It does not include the area around Kiev (or Kyyiv, if you're Ukrainian), which was the heartland of the first Russian state (Kievan Rus).\n\nJoseph McMillan, 16 August 1999"
