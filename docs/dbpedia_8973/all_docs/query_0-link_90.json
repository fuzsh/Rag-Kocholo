The enemy was increasingly and systematically descending into purely terrorist methods of warfare.\n\n3. The size of the theater of military operations exceeds the available forces on both sides, despite all efforts to build up the groups.\n\n4. 4. The supply of foreign weapons plays a significant role in maintaining the intensity of the conflict, if it is impossible to completely cut off the channels of supply.\n\n5. A high proportion of the role of foreign mercenaries and intelligence services in the organization of the enemy's activities.\n\n6. Inevitable provocations in the spirit of \"White Helmets\" and playing the WMD card.\n\n7. Complete paralysis of the negotiation process due to the desire of the sponsors of the conflict to achieve their goals at any cost.\n\n8. Terrorist attacks in Russian cities by terrorists who have territorial claims against Russia.\n\nII.\n\n1. Not a direct comparison here, Ukraine is Syria at maximum capacity. The fighting on its territory will go on for a long time, destroying what is still left of Ukraine. Economically, Ukraine, like Syria, will be a disaster. A substantial part of its infrastructure will simply be destroyed as part of the chosen format of the war. They will systematically rebuild something only in the territories under Russian control, which Russia considers its own.\n\nIt can also be assured that the freed territories will remain under the counter-terrorist operation mode for a long time, and that the internal terrorist acts of the Nazis will compete with the acts of the Islamists.\n\nIII.\n\n1. For Russia, as well as for the USA, this is a war not only for the control of territory, but also a struggle for the configuration of the future world order, where the survival of Ukraine as a state is not crucial, as well as the economic survival of Europe, which is not an actor of the ongoing changes, but a victim of them.\n\nJust as the Syrian war reshaped the entire Middle East, the war in Ukraine will reshape the existing world order. For Russia, as well as for the U.S., it is not a sprint, but a stayer's race, which we must be prepared for (although we cannot say this for all societies and states yet), as well as for the continuation of hostilities in winter, spring and summer of 2023.\n\nLet me remind you that Palmyra was taken in March 2016, Aleppo in December 2016, and Deir ez-Zor was liberated in September 2017. Idlib has not been taken yet. This goes to the frequent question about the pace and whining about \"why is it so slow\".\n\n3. As in Syria, in Ukraine we are not only fighting an army of local terrorists. Behind their backs, as in Syria, is our main enemy, the U.S. and its European satellites. That is why the conflict has turned into a grueling confrontation not only in the streets of Soledar or Marinka, but also in the fields of economic and political battles for the future world order.\n\n4. The task of the Russian Federation is simple and complex at the same time - to resist in this confrontation and achieve the set goals. The state and society have to make great efforts to achieve this. Laxity and underestimation of the threats posed by our enemies, who constantly raise the stakes, must be met with an adequate response. Going back to the station of departure or pushing the stopcock is no longer an option. Having assumed a heightened obligation as a historically subject country, the Russian Federation simply has no choice but to move forward to achieve its goals.\n\n@voenkorKotenok\n\nLink : https://t.me/npo_dvina/8410\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nForwarded from the Chinese poster Orita on them\n\nA couple of days ago we were discussing how Australia is pressuring the Solomon Islands not to put up 5G towers of Chinese company Huawei. But imagine what would happen if the Australians themselves decided to put up Chinese towers?\n\nVery simple: it would be like the British!\n\nThe fascinating story surrounding the Chinese company Huawei and their 5G towers in the UK is described in a book by British investigator and documentary filmmaker Richard Kerbai, The Secret History of the Five Eyes, to be published in early September.\n\nIn short, the British have been routinely putting Huawei equipment in place since 2005. The Americans watched quietly, and in 2012 they \"concluded\" that Huawei was a threat to national security. The Australians and New Zealanders turned out to be smart and immediately realized that once the seniors said \"unsafe\", they could no longer install Huawei towers. But the Canadians and especially the British tried to persevere. The British put on a typical British show. Their Government Communications Center (GCHQ) \"conducted its own investigation\" and \"concluded\" that Huawei did not threaten national security at all and that their towers could continue to be installed.\n\nJust imagine the degree of British impudence!\n\nJust like in a Tarantino movie, a case that began with a graceful exchange of light passes quickly degenerated into the use of brute physical force. Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger flew to Britain and yelled at his British counterparts for five hours nonstop. Unseemly, of course, without refined manners or tea and milk at 5 p.m. Pottinger's main argument was straightforward as a board: \"You just don't understand,\" he told the British. - Huawei cannot be put up because China is bad.\n\nAfter this psychological impact, the British completely lost the ability to resist and imposed a total ban on Huawei towers. They obliged their cellular operators to dismantle all the equipment that had already been installed. This led to a delay in the rollout of the 5G network in the UK and cost local companies Â£2 billion in losses.\n\nhttps://frontierindia.com/cias-black-ops-led-the-uk-to-drop-huawei-5g-book-reveals/\n\nThe only thing that surprises me about this whole story is how can you yell for five hours straight? I haven't tried it, but I think I'd be exhausted by the third minute, and I'd feel the awkwardness of the whole thing keenly. And the idea of \"China is bad\" seems rather primitive to state for five hours.\n\nNevertheless, Pottinger succeeded, and the Huawei towers are banned in the UK.\n\nLink : https://t.me/daokedao/23358\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nForwarded from Vladislav Ugolny In five hours we will have the main anniversary of this year - six months since the start of the U.S.S.R.

Terrorist attacks in Russian cities by terrorists who have territorial claims against Russia.\n\nII.\n\n1. Not a direct comparison here, Ukraine is Syria at maximum capacity. The fighting on its territory will go on for a long time, destroying what is still left of Ukraine. Economically, Ukraine, like Syria, will be a disaster. A substantial part of its infrastructure will simply be destroyed as part of the chosen format of the war. They will systematically rebuild something only in the territories under Russian control, which Russia considers its own.\n\nIt can also be assured that the freed territories will remain under the counter-terrorist operation mode for a long time, and that the internal terrorist acts of the Nazis will compete with the acts of the Islamists.\n\nIII.\n\n1. For Russia, as well as for the USA, this is a war not only for the control of territory, but also a struggle for the configuration of the future world order, where the survival of Ukraine as a state is not crucial, as well as the economic survival of Europe, which is not an actor of the ongoing changes, but a victim of them.\n\nJust as the Syrian war reshaped the entire Middle East, the war in Ukraine will reshape the existing world order. For Russia, as well as for the U.S., it is not a sprint, but a stayer's race, which we must be prepared for (although we cannot say this for all societies and states yet), as well as for the continuation of hostilities in winter, spring and summer of 2023.\n\nLet me remind you that Palmyra was taken in March 2016, Aleppo in December 2016, and Deir ez-Zor was liberated in September 2017. Idlib has not been taken yet. This goes to the frequent question about the pace and whining about \"why is it so slow\".\n\n3. As in Syria, in Ukraine we are not only fighting an army of local terrorists. Behind their backs, as in Syria, is our main enemy, the U.S. and its European satellites. That is why the conflict has turned into a grueling confrontation not only in the streets of Soledar or Marinka, but also in the fields of economic and political battles for the future world order.\n\n4. The task of the Russian Federation is simple and complex at the same time - to resist in this confrontation and achieve the set goals. The state and society have to make great efforts to achieve this. The laxity and underestimation of the threats posed by our enemies, who are constantly raising the stakes, must be met with an adequate response. Going back to the station of departure or pushing the stopcock is no longer an option. Having assumed a heightened obligation as a historically subject country, the Russian Federation simply has no choice but to move forward to achieve its goals.\n\n@voenkorKotenok\n\nLink : https://t.me/npo_dvina/8410\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nForwarded from O.K.O.

Regional administrations will have a difficult task: on the one hand, as NEZIGAR points out, society does not want to return to the masked regime, and on the other hand, the pandemic still does not exhibit any healthy behavioral patterns. Vaccination is still not a legitimate step for many, raising all the same questions as a year and a half ago.\n\nAgainst this background, the level of collective immunity continues to fall. So in the fall, the authorities of the subjects of the Russian Federation will once again face the nontrivial task of convincing the population to be vaccinated for the umpteenth time. The problem will be solved massively after September 11. The current increase in the incidence of covid is a background problem for regional administrations, and the new wave of the pandemic is unlikely to come to the forefront of the public consciousness.\n\nThe current situation is characterized by an increase in the incidence of the disease in many regions of the country, and more than half of the federal subjects have already returned to the recommendations for a masked regime in administrative buildings, health care facilities, etc.\n\nPolls and focus groups show that the public does not want a return to the mask regime. According to data from various regions, about 20-30% of citizens support the necessity of such a regime, mostly residents of large cities and megalopolises, while in small towns and rural areas the proportion supporting such a regime is even lower. Sociologists say that Russian society views the current mask-free regime positively.\n\nOn the whole, experts note the gradual and recommendatory nature of regional authorities' actions.

Each rocket contains over 300 of the mines. Already by August 3, the DPRâs Ministry of Emergency Situations noted that Ukraine had fired several thousand of the prohibited mines on Donetsk.\n\nAs of August 15, 44 civilians, including two children, have suffered gruesome injuries. Another mine victim died in hospital.\n\nSome days ago, such mines grotesquely maimed a 15 year old boy in Donetsk.\n\nYounger children donât know that the mines arenât toys, and elderly often simply donât see them, or likewise donât understand the danger, as was the case with an elderly lady with dementia who, on August 8, lost a foot as a result of stepping on a mine while she was going to work in her garden plot.\n\nTiny but powerful, these insidious mines are designed not to kill but to tear off feet or hands. Their design allows them to float to the ground without exploding, where they easily blend in with most settings and generally lie dormant until stepped on or otherwise disturbed.\n\nAccording to Konstantin Zhukov, Chief Medical Officer of Donetsk Ambulance Service, a weight of just 2 kg is enough to activate one of the mines. Sometimes, however, they explode spontaneously. An unspoken tragedy on top of the already tragic targeting of civilians is that dogs, cats, birds and other animals are also victims of these dirty mines.\n\nIn the grass, or surprisingly even on sidewalks and streets, it is very easy to overlook them or mistake them for a leaf. Even when Iâve seen such mines marked with warning signs or circled, it still took me quite a bit to actually see them.\n\nIn its relentless deploying of these mines, Ukraine has targeted all over Donetsk, as well as Makeevka to the east and Yasinovataya to the north. Ukraine has fired them elsewhere, including the hard-hit northern DPR city of Gorlovka, as well as regions in the Lugansk Peopleâs Republic in previous months.\n\nIn fact, according to DPR authorities, Ukraine began using the mines in March, during battles for Mariupol, and in May was already firing them into DPR settlements. Also in early May, while in Rubiznhe in the Lugansk Peopleâs Republic, I was warned that Ukraine had been littering nearby areas with the mines, something confirmed by locals when I went to nearby Sievierodonetsk on August 12....\"\n\nhttps://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/23/in-just-under-three-weeks-ukrainian-fired-prohibited-petal-mines-maim-at-least-44-civilians-kill-2-in-donetsk-region/ CovertAction MagazineIn Just Under Three Weeks, Ukrainian-Fired Prohibited âPetalâ Mines Maim At Least 44 Civilians, Kill 2, in Donetsk Region - CovertAction Magazine Ukraine continues to fire internationally-banned anti-personnel mines on civilian areas of Donetsk and other cities in the Donetsk Peopleâs Republic (DPR), in violation of international law and of the mine ban convention Ukraine signed in 1999 and ratified in 2005.

Radio-electronic reconnaissance of different ranges is working, there is an agent network.\n\nThe problem is in the targeted allocation of quite limited forces and means. Unfortunately, it is now difficult to plan and arrange a massive fire attack as in the early days of a special military operation: it is necessary to concentrate efforts on a separate section of the front.\n\nIn addition, there is a problem with the Ukrainian agent network: all launches become instantly known. In the case of basing airfields, point strikes will be ineffective, because the aviation will simply be airborne.\n\nAnd the interaction problems are still there: as long as the ground forces continue to spit in the direction of the \"flyers\" and measure their combat merits, carefully ignoring requests for fire attacks from their colleagues, there will still be no effective destruction of the enemy's equipment.\n\n#Russia #Ukraine\n\n@rybar\n\n*Support us: 4377 7278 0407 7977 TelegramMilitary Intelligence And we have repeatedly written and shown in detail from which airfields the Ukrainian aircraft take off and which of them are undergoing repair work to expand their capabilities, but the Russian Defense Ministry continues to ignore this essential part of Ukraine's military infrastructure. Apparently, the Iskanders do not fly further than Kharkov.\n\nAfter the AFU received American anti-radar missiles, don't underestimate the Air Force, this is no longer a launch from the cajole \"somewhere there\", it is quite a dangerous precision-guided weapon capable of messing up our air defenses quite a bit.\n\nhttps://t.me/rybar/37639?single\n\nLink : https://t.me/rybar/37643\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nSubscriber:\n\n\"This is a civil war with outside interference, Strelkov compared it very accurately to the civil war in the United States.\"\n\nResponse:\n\nStrelkov is, of course, a commander I respect infinitely. But this is not enough to agree with him on anything and everything.\n\nWhat kind of war this is, it is enough to understand the main factors driving it. If there really were such acute contradictions for the Ukrainian-Russian conflict that it would be enough for an internal war without support from the outside - then it would be a civil war. Such contradictions never existed, and without intervention and influence from outside this conflict would simply not have been possible. Let's just remember how the Khokhlys came to power in 2013-2014 and on what initial narratives, and let's not make up something that didn't happen.\n\nWhat we are dealing with is the underlying factor for the conflict - external interference. This is a gradual shift of emphasis from the fight against the criminal power, to a fight already based on various kinds of differences with Russia, and with the only goal - the complete withdrawal of the territory of Ukraine from any influence of Russia on this territory.\n\nThis war is pure geopolitics. It is for influence, between the two subjects of the conflict, on the strategically important geopolitical space. And Ukraine, as well as Ukrainians, are not subjects in this war. Only objects.\n\nYes, by manipulative methods they are given the properties of some pseudo-subjectivity, but only in order to make them think that this is their own interest, their own conflict.\n\nIn other words, Ukrainians are victims of their manipulation. And this, by the way, is one of the main reasons why Ukrainians should be subject to elimination - a weak link. Too weak to independently recognize when they are being manipulated, and in whose interests. In the current conflict, there is no real Ukrainian interest - this, I think, is clear to everyone who is more or less sensible.\n\nLink : https://t.me/Za_Derjavy/20267\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nThe current growth on the stock market in Russia does not matter much, and the stock market recovery may take several years.\n\nThere are no preconditions for stock market recovery in the near future, only speculative fluctuations are possible. The current market conditions allow, in particular, energy suppliers to increase their revenues in case of a significant drop in volumes, but in the medium term their position in the global economy is not obvious due to sanctions and fear of secondary sanctions by counterparties. According to experts, oil production will decrease, including due to the inability to replace some Western oil service companies, such as Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton in terms of software, data access, high-tech work. Pipeline gas distribution system is mainly focused on Europe, and the construction of planned LNG plants is frozen or postponed, which in light of the rejection of Russian gas in a few years will lead to a decline in the industry. Iran has gas reserves comparable to Russia, but does not actually sell it on the world market. Over the next few years it is necessary to somehow obtain the necessary technology and create new sales channels, which will require the implementation of large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nClosure of information is a serious obstacle to the restoration of the market - it becomes impossible to analyze companies, their financial statements, which will not allow to make an informed decision on its purchase or sale. Moreover, the closure of information is not necessarily regulated by regulatory acts. For example, transactions on purchase and sale of assets of \"exiting\" Western companies are quite closed and raise questions even among influential players in the relevant markets.\n\nExperts believe that changes of the policy of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance even in the changed conditions are not expected. Only under the forthcoming new budget rule, additional revenues will be taken away in renminbi, the conversion of which in the long term looks very ambiguous. There are still no plans to invest in the development of the economy at the expense of the income received. As a result, the list of traded companies will remain virtually unchanged. A change in the approach of Russian actors is required to get out of stagnation.\n\nBesides external objective reasons, it should be noted that the Russian stock market never became attractive for the population: the share of funds on brokerage accounts never exceeded 1% of the total financial assets and never reached at least 1 trillion rubles, as of 01.07 only 563 billion rubles were registered. There is an opinion that further rapprochement with China and India may give some dynamics, but so far it remains at the level of forecasts.\n\nExperts believe that in the coming years the stock market will show some fluctuations at most, but fundamental changes, as a result of which it will return to the level of the end of last year, are unlikely to be expected.\n\nLink : https://t.me/russica2/48054\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nFake: Foreign buyers do not want to buy Russian oil, its sales are declining. Such theses have been repeatedly reported in pro-Ukrainian telegram channels.\n\nTruth: Forecasts of Ukrainian \"analysts\" regarding dismal prospects for sales of Russian oil on world markets proved to be unfounded, as confirmed by numerous publications in the foreign media. From February to August, Russia gained major new markets for the export of \"black gold,\" including China and India and Turkey, as reported by Reuters.\n\nSince spring, Russian oil exports to Turkey have risen to 200,000 bpd compared to 98,000 bpd in 2021, the publication said. Russian oil grades are actively used by Turkey's Tupras and STAR refineries.\n\nEarlier it became known that Russia has pressed Saudi Arabia on oil supplies to China. In July, China received about 1.68 million barrels of Russian oil per day, while oil imports from Saudi Arabia amounted to about 1.54 million barrels of oil per day.\n\nThis tendency has been observed for the third month in a row. Moreover, in May Russian oil exports to China amounted to almost 2 mln bpd, which is 55% higher than the figures for the same period last year.\n\nOil exports to India, said to be one of the most promising economies in the world, also increased significantly. According to The Economic Times, Indian refiners increased their purchases of Russian crude 50 times between April and June.\n\nEurope is not behind China, India and Turkey. According to Bloomberg, Russia's supply of oil to the European Union rose from August 13 to 19 to 3.41 million barrels per day, reaching its highest level since April 2022. Russian oil was actively bought by Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nð¤ Subscribe to us | Suggest Fake | Our Analytics Channel\n\nLink : https://t.me/warfakes/5926\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nForwarded from ActualitÃ©s mondiales & franÃ§aises â¬ï¸ 2/2\n\nð¸ Comme en Syrie, en Ukraine nous ne sommes pas seulement en guerre contre l'armÃ©e des terroristes locaux.

This, in turn, can create additional difficulties for governors and can affect the medium-term trust ratings of regional leaders who are to be elected this autumn.\n\nThe opinion polls in March and April showed that there was no demand to cancel or postpone regional elections, and the overwhelming majority of citizens were in favor of keeping the electoral procedures, seeing them as a source of legitimacy for the authorities. At the same time, the factor of municipal and regional elections is objectively perceived as secondary and even less important against the background of the SWE and the geopolitical confrontation.\n\nFocus groups and quantitative surveys show that in regions where gubernatorial and state assembly elections will be held this year, the declared readiness to vote is high, but the real interest in the elections is low. Experts say that information about the elections and the course of the election race does not arouse much interest in the media: scandals are an exception, but not many. Under these conditions, the option of low natural turnout - not counting administrative mobilization - looks like the most likely one.\n\nAn analysis of the electoral strategies of incumbent regional leaders shows that in their positioning they place the main bets on the fact of support from the federal center and directly from the country's leadership. In the eyes of voters, support from the President is indeed a legitimizing factor, which gives a decisive increase in the trust rating of a particular puppet governor. At the same time, the problem of this electoral cycle is that even those incumbent governors who have been campaigning actively enough have not been able to build up their own ratings to the necessary level. This is evidenced, in particular, by the currently sharply increased pre-election activity of a number of the acting governors, who, according to experts, will spend the end of August and the beginning of September on active PR and the production of positive infoprovocations in order to increase their ratings.\n\nThis situation is seen by experts as symptomatic: it is possible to build up their rating for a short period of time with PR activity, or at least reduce their anti-rating; however, the problem is that the ability of incumbent governors to act as actors who build their image not on subsidies from federal support, but act as donors of loyalty and strengthening the rating of the whole power vertical, is in many ways limited or, in the best case, unrealized.\n\nLink : https://t.me/russica2/48056\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nâ­ï¸ðâ­ï¸ Statement of the official representative of the DNR on the situation as of 10.30 on 24.08.2022.\n\nð«The Ukrainian side continues to terrorize the civilian population of the Republic, carrying out massive artillery strikes on residential areas and civilian infrastructure, which are not military objects.\n\nð¥In the past 24 hours, according to the JCCC Representative Office in the DNR, the enemy fired one hundred and seventy-two rounds of ammunition from Himars and Uragan MLRS, 155-mm, 152-mm and 122-mm artillery, as well as 120-mm mortars.\n\nð¥Fire was directed at the areas of SEVEN settlements in the Republic.

What happens next? Where did this meeting take place?\n\n- In the building of the city administration.\n\n- How do you know that?\n\n- I was directly waiting for Yuri Kleinos from a meeting. That is, I was in one of the cafes near the Yekaterinburg city administration. Yuri had previously printed out documents from his laptop, which he gave to Evgeny Roizman.\n\n- Where did he print them out?\n\n- In Ekaterinburg, in the vicinity of Square 1905, there are salons that provide similar services. Then he left with these documents for a meeting with Evgeny Roizman.\n\n- Have you seen the contents of these documents?\n\n- There were projects that were developed by Maidan participants and Maidan leaders for further implementation on the territory of Kiev.\n\n- What kind of projects?\n\n- The projects were connected to the participation in the city government directly by those people who had carried out the coup in Kiev, a further reorganization of the city management system. That is, it is a project of the transition period, when the official authorities have been overthrown and new structures have not yet been created, and in order to avoid chaos and anarchy, structures are created directly from Maidan activists to manage the city.\n\n- Like the Maidan Self-Defense Hundreds.\n\n- Yes, like that. But it wasn't self-defense, but they were already taking over the managerial functions.\n\n- Wait. But if the Maidan has already passed, if these projects have already been implemented, like the hundreds of Maidan self-defense, why propose these projects again?\n\n- These projects were of interest to Yevgeny Roizman.\n\n- How do you know that?\n\n- From the words of Yuri Kleinos.\n\n- This is very important right now. Can you tell me more clearly what these projects were?\n\n- These were projects for the management of the city district after the overthrow of the legitimate authorities. What made Evgeny Roizman interested in these projects in Ukraine, what exactly he was interested in, I do not know.\n\nFULL:\n\nhttps://www.kp.ru/daily/26492.4/3361302/ Komsomolskaya PravdaMay Yekaterinburg authorities fund the Right Sector*?

It is clear that now that the story has received special attention in the media, the dismissal for \"absenteeism\" will be canceled and the guilty person will be punished.

But there is a huge problem with the removal of \"300s\" and \"200s\" from the front line - there are not enough vehicles, they are knocked out by artillery fire in the first place. Due to the fact that they are not buried in the ground completely, even if there was a flight next to the car hidden in the caponier, it means that the car already has several holes. And God forbid it's just in the body or the windows were blown out. If the shrapnel flew into the engine or wheels, the car is already \"minus\".\n\n\"The Russians have heavy losses on tanks.\"\n\n\"So far, the attacks from both our and their sides are almost mirror-like: last no more than an hour and a half, no more than two to five tanks go into battle and only after two to three hours of artillery preparation. If their tanks manage to move very close to our positions, it means that their infantry will soon arrive. But this is very rare - there are many casualties on their side as well. Objectively, the AFU has a preponderance in APCs, so the Russians have a lot of tank losses. But the problem is that they have ten tanks for every one of our tanks. And they take them out to attack time after time. Sometimes it seems as if the Russians have millions of tanks. We also move out to attack, but we only take tanks out when there is at least a 70 percent chance that our artillery has scorched their positions completely.\n\n\"The offensive on Kherson is out of the question now.\"\n\n\"The offensive on Kherson is not being discussed at all. Right now the issue is irrelevant. Until the Russians are covered with artillery at least as much as they cover us, any offensive is out of the question. Now for one artillery shot we fire fifty from their side. By the way, there are breaks in shelling by the Russians when they have ammunition deliveries. They have already learned not to keep b/k storages close to artillery batteries - after a series of accurate arrivals from our side. There is a lot of mess in the troops on their side. But they are learning how to fight fast: if in the first months of the war they were rushing forward like on parade, now they learned how to maneuver, camouflage and avoid accumulation of troops by single figures (coordinates - Ed.). Also, the Russians have a new trick: they have started using their air defense batteries for ground targets, practicing ground-to-air missiles against ground targets.\n\n\"Ammunition for Soviet howitzers is disastrously scarce.\"\n\n\"Our M777s are on the move all the time - they are transported virtually nonstop along the entire front line for safety. Ammunition for the M777s and HIMARS has already been supplied by our Western allies quite decently for defense purposes. But with shells for Soviet howitzers, of which there are many still in service with the AFU, they are disastrously scarce, they are worth their weight in gold. The same applies to mortar rounds and mortars themselves. Mortars in positions are also expendable material, they do not live more than a week or two, they are calculated by drones and quickly knocked out. Therefore after firing a round or two the mortar crews immediately run dozens of meters to the side and hide in the trenches. There is neither the strength nor the ability to drag the mortars behind them. In a couple of minutes the retaliation will come.... That's how we fight.\n\nLink : https://t.me/ChDambiev/19041\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\n\"Ninety percent of the time passes at the bottom of the trenches. How the war goes on at the frontline. The story of servicemen of the AFU. Ukrainian soldiers who are currently fighting in the Kherson direction told \"Strana.ua\" about the situation at the front.\n\n\"Like in World War II.\"\n\n\"Those of us who fought until 2022 - in ATO-OSU - call those times silence. What is happening now on the front can apparently be compared to World War I or World War II. Shelling at Ground Zero goes on almost non-stop: sometimes it is impossible to lift one's head. Soldiers lie at the bottom of the trenches for hours, some cover themselves with armor and even the most frugal ones take pieces of iron to the trenches and make individual shelters for themselves. Up there, behind the parapet, we climb out one by one and only if absolutely necessary. Ninety percent of the time we spend at the bottom of the trenches. The main task is not to abandon our positions. Basically Russian artillery works on harassing fire: they shoot at areas where they think our positions are. It's worse when their drones start flying - it means they're looking for targets, which means they'll come at our position point by point.\n\n\"Skiers bare the front.\"\n\n\"Not all people endure - some, even those who volunteered to join the troops, after sitting under solid arrivals, are asked to go to the rear under any pretext. Unfortunately, sometimes there are real epidemics of panic - whole units are taken off the positions. We call them \"skiers\", from the expression \"fall on skis\"... And they denuded the whole kilometers long areas. The saddest thing is that Russians immediately become aware of such escapes through aerial reconnaissance by drones and they immediately try to cut into the empty sections of the front. To be fair, the \"skiers\" are most often units from TRO brigades that have just gotten to the front lines, the newcomers. Therefore, the command tries to dilute only those who have arrived at \"zero\" with people who have already been shelled. So that potential panic-mongers stay in their positions. The adaptation time to constant arrivals is different for all soldiers: some need a couple of hours, some will go into a stupor even after a week under shelling. It is even worse if the unit comes under targeted fire - i.e. there are exact coordinates of the positions, Russian drones flew\".\n\n\"The broken are put on the valves.\"\n\n\"TRO brigades are considered the most unreliable among those holding positions. They have a lot of random people who enlisted in the TRO after February 24, imagining that this war will be like the Maidan or the ATO. And Russian tanks can be hit with a Molotov cocktail. That's a different war. But even among the TRO brigades there are real reckless fighters who hold up perfectly under fire. Those who break down are taken to the rear and put in the valves (checkpoints - Ed.).\" Continued in the next post.\n\nLink : https://t.me/ChDambiev/19040\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nForwarded from Situation at Donbass checkpoints - News The only checkpoint across the line of contact near the city of Vasilievka in Zaporizhzhia region will soon be equipped with an online registration system.\n\nSuch a decision was made for two reasons. First of all, it will help reduce the kilometer-long queues that occur daily when people from Kiev-controlled regions of Ukraine enter the city. According to Natalya Romanichenko, head of the military-civil administration of Zaporizhzhya Vasilyevskiy district, citizens can stand in them for more than a day.\n\nDespite the special regime in the \"border\" area, local authorities are not going to put obstacles in the way of those who want to visit relatives or friends in Vasilievka and go there on their own business. Similar restrictions will not be imposed on the departure of its residents from the city.\n\nIn addition, pre-registration, as the civil-military administration believes, will help control internal migration flows in Zaporizhzhia. Online registration should help to detect and detain them in time.\n\n\"In the near future, a filtering post will be launched. We will have registration in advance, so that there are no columns at the entrance to Vasilievka. People will sign in line and come specifically on their day and time, so as not to create a collapse. On both sides there will be registration: both for exit and entry. Everyone will be checked in advance,\" Natalia Romanichenko explained to the TASS reporter.\n\nShe added that registration would be possible through the Internet. In the meantime, there are checkpoints in the Vasilevsky district.
