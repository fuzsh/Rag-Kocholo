Among them are acids, benzols and crude oil.\n\nAll this clearly indicates one thing: despite all the statements of the local authorities, the facility is still operating even after several Russian missile strikes.\n\nThe only major oil refinery in the country actually continues to supply fuel to the AFU. Against the background of the establishment of foreign supplies of fuel and lubricants, all this allows the Kiev government to significantly reduce the deficit of fuel in the country.\n\nTherefore, we would like to remind you once again that it is not necessary to bomb the entire territory in order to put the plant out of action.

Both the Russian Federation and the DPR have repeatedly warned against such steps. However, this does not stop the mercenaries who continue to arrive in Ukraine. In such a situation, their death or capture in the area of the SMO is an expected result.\n\nAt the moment, a number of foreign citizens are kept in the institutions of the penitentiary system of the Republic. They are charged with mercenarism. After carrying out investigative and operational actions, they will come before the court.\n\nAmong these persons was also British citizen Paul Johnson Anthony Dominic Ury. Professional military. He took part in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. He led military operations, and was also engaged in recruiting and training mercenaries for the armed formations of Ukraine. He was taken prisoner in April of this year while trying to break through a checkpoint controlled by the DPR servicemen.\n\nI would like to note that international organizations, as well as official representatives of the United Kingdom (including the Foreign Office, the Embassy in the Russian Federation, and members of the British Parliament), have been notified of the fact of Paul Uriy's capture. Also, at his request, the relevant information was transmitted to foreign media. However, there was no reaction from the UK.\n\nAt the same time, during the first medical examination, Paul Ury had already had a number of chronic diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes, damage to the respiratory system, kidneys, and a number of diseases of the cardiovascular system.\n\nIn addition, he was in a depressed psychological state due to indifference to his fate in his homeland. He understood that the representatives of Great Britain ignored even the possibility of negotiating his return as part of the prisoner exchange procedure. Moreover, they did not provide the necessary medicines through the ICRC.\n\nâï¸On our part, despite the severity of the alleged crime, Paul Ury was provided with appropriate medical assistance. However, given the diagnosis and stress, he died on July 10.\n\nLink : https://t.me/donbassinsider/16650\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nDnepropetrovsk was hit.\n\nLink : https://t.me/milinfolive/87062\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nThank you all so much for your help ð¤\n\nThere's not much left to do.\n\nLink : https://t.me/Soldieroffortune777/12750\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nð·ðºðºð¦â¡Rocket flight over Dnepropetrovsk\n\nLink : https://t.me/intelslava/33190\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nð·ðºðºð¦â¡More from Dniper\n\nLink : https://t.me/intelslava/33188\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nA ten-meter pit left behind by a Ukrainian munition in Makiivka\n\nSovetskiy district of the city of Makiivka, a ten-meter pit was formed as a result of the detonation of a Ukrainian missile that fell on a vacant lot near school No. 17.

Out of habit, people go to Wikipedia, check the data on the Ukrainian Air Force there, then look at the briefings of the Russian Defense Ministry and shout \"I don't believe it!\n\nThe @rybar team decided to do a little literacy and tell us where the legs are growing from.\n\nð» At the time of the start of the air defense system, the official number of aircraft in service ranged from 165 to 178 Su-24/25/27s and MiG-29s. There were also 23 trainers and another 67 \"mothballed\", i.e. withdrawn from combat service. In addition to tactical aviation, the AFU had slightly more than 200 Soviet-made helicopters.\n\nNevertheless, many of them (even those that were officially in service) were no longer in use due to exhaustion and poor maintenance by Ukrainian technicians - they were listed only in reports for write-offs for repairs and money laundering.\n\nHowever, with the start of a special military operation, it became necessary to restore the air force's combat effectiveness. Thanks to the efforts of Ukrainian military-industrial complex specialists and engineers from NATO countries (mostly from Eastern Europe), the process of returning decommissioned planes to service and repairing damaged ones was set up.\n\nBesides supplying the planes and helicopters themselves, Eastern European countries, such as Slovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania, provided aircraft parts and spare parts and units. Some of them covertly, some officially. The Polish leadership, for example, made no secret of the fact that it transferred all available spare parts for MiGs.\n\nThe aircraft repair process is carried out at some airfields in Western Ukraine (Lutsk, Ozernoye, and Uzhgorod). However, most of the repair work is done by the same Eastern European countries as Poland, Slovakia and Romania. Slovak transport helicopters fly to and from Uzhgorod almost daily.\n\nAnother country unofficially helping the Ukrainian side is Moldova. The territory of this country not only serves as a transit hub for cargoes of various purposes to Ukraine (from Romanian Suceava via Riscani to Mogilev-Podolsk), but is also used for repair of Ukrainian aircraft. In particular, the Moldovan authorities provided their Marculesti airfield for this purpose.\n\nDespite almost daily losses of aviation equipment, the AFU has already organized and implemented the process of repairing the planes and helicopters taken out of service. Adding to this the arms supplied from NATO countries, we get quite significant figures in the number of old, but still combat equipment.\n\nAfter restoration, aircraft are promptly delivered from the territory of neighboring states through \"neutral\" countries to airbases in Western Ukraine, where the training of flight crews takes place.\n\nThe Maia Sandu administration, despite its claimed neutrality in the matter of military and technical support for Ukraine, is increasingly dragging the country into indirect involvement in the conflict, following clear instructions from the Romanian government.\n\nLarge resolution infographics\n\nEnglish version\n\n#Moldova #Poland #Romania #Slovakia #Ukraine\n\n@rybar\n\n*Support us: 4377 7278 0407 7977\n\nLink : https://t.me/rybar/35623\n\nTRANSLATION :\n\nðºðºð¦ In the Glushkov district of Kursk region, the power line damaged by mortar shelling by Ukrainian gangs was restored, said the region's governor Roman Starovoit.\n\n#Russia #Kursk_region #Ukraine #terrorism #war_crimes\n\n@bditelnost Telegramðº Roman Starovoit In the Glushkovsky district the power transmission line, which was damaged as a result of today's mortar shelling from Ukraine, was restored.

General Konashenkov's daily briefs, videos of air strikes on Donetsk, corpses of civilians and retaliatory \"calibration\" are an integral part of media space that has become as familiar as mothballed talk shows on state TV channels.

There is a feeling in the air that life is about to return to the standards of February 23, and that the war is somewhere out there, far away, and will soon be over. In this permanent bliss, society no longer notices many important events and signals.\n\nFirst of all, some of the statements by the president of the Russian Federation, made at the meeting with the leaders of the factions on July 7, have not been noticed.
