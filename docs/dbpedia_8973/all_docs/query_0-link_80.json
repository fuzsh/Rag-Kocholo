Brief information on Russkiye (Russians) in Ukraine: • Backgrounds • Main features of contemporary situation: • number, settlement, socio-demographic situation, language, cultural activities\n\n4. General remarks to myths: Taking into account the etymology of the term (in Late Latin and Greek languages ​Mythos – a fairy tale, legend, story) and basing on the theories of Carl Gustav Jung on myth as an attempt to find a real connection with nature, we can find several meanings of the term «myth» that links us with the ancient history of mankind (on the example of figures and events), with the origin of different phenomena. «MYTH – a fable or a legend embodying the convictions of a people as to their gods or other divine personage, their own origin and early history and the heroes connected with it, or the origin of the world; in a looser sense, any invented story (I add, any idea, or concept); something or someone having no existence in fact».\n\n5. Two groups of the myths: First group: 1) the development trends in integrative processes in Ukraine crucially depend on the attitude of national minorities to the society consolidation processes and state building; 2) mythicized interpretations of «prorusskost’» (ideology and activities orientated towards Russkiye in Ukraine) and «prorossiyskost’» (ideology and activities orientated towards Russia); 3) the anti-Russian line is today the main in the official policy of Ukraine. Second group: 1) the myth «Russian-speaking population of Ukraine»; 2) Russkiye of “near abroad”, including Ukraine, are under the pressure of new states’ policy and efforts of national (in their interpretation nationalist) forces and movements and are «washed out» and even eliminated; 3) rapid deformation and extinction of Russiansness, such of its markers as language, spiritual culture, monuments of material culture.\n\n6. Sourses and spreaders (transmitters) of the myths: • The Ukrainian pro-Russian (please do not confuse with “prorusskiye”) oriented researchers of problems of Russkiye in Ukraine, in fact by those, who live in Ukraine. • Russian researchers who study the problems of Ryskiyesness on the state territories, that belonged to the former Soviet Union. • Publicists of both countries – Ukraine and Russia.\n\n7. What does mythicizing of myths mean?: I link this process with the attempts of myths’ legitimation, i.e. the efforts of their mobilizers to give them the official recognition as the factor of ethnonational development (through the advancement of the bills, the subject of which Russkiye in Ukraine is, as in the situation concerning languages – those are prepared more than ten; myths enrootment in the public opinion, using media for this, as well as imitative “public discussions”, scientific conferences, symposiums etc.). I propose to understand mythicizing as not simply a transformation of this or that statement in the myth, or the interpretation of this or that care speaking about the concrete (specific) procedures of mythicizing of the myths themselves, so firstly we mean the desire of politicians to use these myths as a basis for legislative design of their political activities – the consolidation of the benefits of Russkiye in legal acts and the creation of the favorable atmosphere for entrepreneurship (promotion) of the Russian ethnicity (Russianisness) in the ethnonational space of Ukraine to gain the dominant positions in the Ukrainian society.\n\n8. Who mythicizes the the myths: • Pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians (members of Parliament, members of Government) • Pro-Russian leaders of political parties • Pro-Russian leaders of NGOs\n\n9. Content of the main myths: The first myth focuses on important, extremely acute for an independent Ukraine moment – building and strengthening of independent state, the main structure creating component of which the Ukrainians (Ethno-Ukrainian nation) are: the development trends in integrative processes in Ukraine crucially depend on the attitude of national minorities to the society consolidation processes and state building. Bearing in mind that Russkiye form three quarters of national minorities, the consolidation processes can be set depending on the Russkiye attitude to them.\n\n10. The second myth (multidimensional myth) Is linked with the interpretation of \"pro- Russkiyesness’\" and \"pro-Rossiyskiyesness\". The matter is – the mythicizing of the mentioned two phenomena, that became the factors of the ethnonational development of Ukraine in connection with the presence in the Ukrainian society of the appreciable proportion of Russian origin population.\n\n11. The third myth: the anti-Russian line in the official policy of Ukraine Covers an interpretation of wide range of relations between Ukraine and Russia. This myth is aggregated by Russian-oriented researchers and politicians in Ukraine and frank Ukrainophobes in Russia.\n\n12. The fourth myth: “Russian-speaking population of Ukraine” The term \"Russian-speaking\" in its content is already a myth itself. It is heavily exploited by the supporters of ethnic Russkiye of Ukraine rights preservation in order to present them as, if not dominant force in the Ukrainian ethnic space, at least, as one that should determine its content and design. Mobilizers of this myth within the construction of new meta-communities go further, affirming, that \"most of the population of Ukraine – is not Ukrainians and not Russkiye – these are the Russian-speaking Slavs\".\n\n13. The fifth myth: Russians of \"near abroad\", including (especially) Ukraine, under the pressure of new states and efforts of national (in their interpretation nationalist) forces and movements are \"washed out\" and, even eliminated. Here there is a distorted (intentionally provocative) interpretation of Russkiye’s adaptation processes to the new conditions of existence, which led to some changes in quantitative and qualitative indicators, that fix their current situation and characterize the dynamics of their development.\n\n14. The sixth myth: rapid deformation and extinction of Russkiyesness, those of its markers as language, spiritual culture, monuments of material culture is connected with the assertion of reduction of Russian presence in Ukraine.\n\n15. The seventh myth: Russians and Ukrainians are educated on the common values, traditions and customs, music and literature, that is why we have the same mentality. Similar but not the same.\n\n16. Arguments breaking the myths:\n\n23. Prospects of acceptance of othering in Ukraine (in particular Russians) On the base of survey (March – April 2011): «Interethnic Tolerance in secondary school students of Ukraine»\n\n24.

Perception of different ethnicities in Ukraine: The high level of perception by Ukrainian citizens is typical for ethnic groups of Slavonic origin, among them the highest level for Ukainians and Russians- Russkiye (the difference between total acceptance and total) : • Ukrainians – 59.00 % (61.51% - 6.19 %) • Representatives of Ukrainian diaspora – 35.34 % (40.39 % - 5.05 %) • Russians (Russkiye) – 17.80 % (25.92% - 8.12%) • Byelorussians – 10.36 % (14.97 % - 4.67 %) • Poles – 8.32 % (14.51 % - 6.19 %) • Slovaks – 1.53 % (8.59 % - 7.06 %) • Czech - -1.34 % (7.22% - 8.56 %)\n\n26. Bogardus Social Distance Scale (concerning Russkiye) The scale asks people the extent to which they would be accepting of others. • As close relatives by marriage - 25.92 % • As my close personal friends – 16.63 % • As neighbors on the same street - 8.32 % • As co-workers in the same occupation – 20.12 % • As citizens in my country - 16.68 % • As only visitors in my country – 4.06 % • Would exclude from my country – 8.12 %\n\n27.
