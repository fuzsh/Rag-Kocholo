        "text": "Territory of the Russian Empire (1764–1917)\n\nFor other uses, see Novorossiya (disambiguation).\n\nNovorossiya[nb 1] is a historical name, used during the era of the Russian Empire for an administrative area that would later become the southern mainland of Ukraine: the region immediately north of the Black Sea and Crimea. The province fell largely within a slightly wider area known in Ukrainian as the Stepovyna and in Russian as the Stepp \"Steppe Land\", or Nyz \"Lower Land\".[1] The name Novorossiya, which means New Russia, entered official usage in 1764, after the Russian Empire conquered the Crimean Khanate, and annexed its territories,[2] when Novorossiya Governorate (or Province) was founded. Official usage of the name ceased after 1917, when the entire area (minus Crimea) was incorporated in the Ukrainian People's Republic, precursor of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nNovorossiya Governorate was formed in 1764 from military frontier regions and parts of the southern Hetmanate, in anticipation of a war with the Ottoman Empire.[3] It was further expanded by the annexation of the Zaporozhian Sich in 1775. At various times, Novorossiya encompassed the Moldavian region of Bessarabia, the modern Ukraine's regions of the Black Sea littoral (Prychornomoria), Zaporizhzhia, Tavria, the Azov Sea littoral (Pryazovia), the Tatar region of Crimea, the area around the Kuban River, and the Circassian lands.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore 18th century\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Wild Fields\n\nThe modern history of the region follows the fall of the Golden Horde. The eastern portion was claimed by the Crimean Khanate (one of its multiple successors), while its western regions were divided between Moldavia and Lithuania. With the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the whole Black Sea northern littoral region came under the control of the Crimean Khanate that in turn became a vassal of the Ottomans.[citation needed] Sometime in the 16th century the Crimean Khanate allowed the Nogai Horde which were displaced from its native Volga region by Muscovites and Kalmyks to settle in the Black Sea steppes.[citation needed]\n\nVast regions to the North of the Black Sea were sparsely populated and were known as the Wild Fields (as translated from Polish or Ukrainian), Dykra (in Lithuanian) or Loca deserta (\"desolated places\") in Latin on medieval maps. There were, however, many settlements along the Dnieper River. The Wild Fields had covered roughly the southern territories of modern Ukraine; some[who?] say they extended into the modern Southern Russia (Rostov Oblast).[citation needed]\n\nRussian empire (1764-1917)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Novorossiya Governorate\n\nThe Russian Empire gradually gained control over the area, signing peace treaties with the Cossack Hetmanate and with the Ottoman Empire at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1735–39, 1768–74, 1787–92 and 1806–12. In 1764 the Russian Empire established the Novorossiysk Governorate; it was originally to be named after the Empress Catherine, but she decreed that it should be called New Russia instead.[4] Imperial Russia’s view of New Russia was described in 2006 by the historian Willard Sunderland:\n\nThe old steppe was Asian and stateless; the current one was state-determined and claimed for European-Russian civilization. The world of comparison was now even more obviously that of the Western empires. Consequently it was all the more clear that the Russian empire merited its own New Russia to go along with everyone else's New Spain, New France, and New England. The adoption of the name of New Russia was in fact the most powerful statement imaginable of Russia's national coming of age.[5]\n\nThe administrative centre of the Novorossiysk Governorate was at the St. Elizabeth fortress (today in Kropyvnytskyi) in order to protect the southern borderlands from the Ottoman Empire, and in 1765 this passed to Kremenchuk.[4][6]\n\nAfter the annexation of the Ottoman territories to Novorossiya in 1774, the Russian authorities commenced a broad program of colonization, encouraging large migrations from a broader spectrum of ethnic groups. Catherine the Great invited European settlers to these newly conquered lands: Romanians (from Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania), Bulgarians, Serbs, Greeks, Albanians, Germans, Poles, Italians, and others.[citation needed] Catherine the Great granted Prince Grigori Potemkin (1739–1791) the powers of an absolute ruler over the area from 1774, after which he directed the Russian colonization of the land. The rulers of Novorossiya gave out land generously to the Russian nobility (dvoryanstvo) and the enserfed peasantry—mostly from Ukraine and fewer from Russia—to encourage immigration for the cultivation of the then sparsely populated steppe.[citation needed] According to the Historical Dictionary of Ukraine:\n\nThe population consisted of military colonists from hussar and lancer regiments, Ukrainian and Russian peasants, Cossacks, Serbs, Montenegrins, Hungarians, and other foreigners who received land subsidies for settling in the area.[7]\n\nIn 1775, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great forcefully liquidated the Zaporizhian Sich and annexed its territory to Novorossiya, thus eliminating the independent rule of the Ukrainian Cossacks.[citation needed] The governorate was dissolved in 1783.[citation needed] In 1792, the Russian government declared that the region between the Dniester and the Bug was to become a new principality named \"New Moldavia\", under Russian suzerainty.[8] According to the first Russian census of the Yedisan region conducted in 1793 (after the expulsion of the Nogai Tatars) 49 villages out of 67 between the Dniester and the Southern Bug were Romanian.[9] From 1796 to 1802 Novorossiya was the name of the reestablished Governorate with the capital Novorossiysk (previously and subsequently Ekaterinoslav, the present-day Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk not to be confused with present-day Novorossiysk, Russian Federation) In 1802 it was divided into three governorates, the Yekaterinoslav, Kherson, and the Taurida.[citation needed]\n\nFrom 1822 to 1874 the Novorossiysk-Bessarabia General Government was centred in Odesa. The region remained part of the Russian Empire until its collapse following the Russian February Revolution in early March 1917.\n\nSoviet era (1918-1990)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe territory became part of the short-lived Russian Republic for one year then in 1918, it was largely included in the Ukrainian State and in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic at the same time. In 1918–1920, it was, to varying extents, under the control of the anti-Bolshevik White movement governments of South Russia whose defeat signified the Soviet control over the territory, which became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, within the Soviet Union in 1922.\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Novorossiya (confederation)\n\nFollowing the Soviet Union's collapse on 26 December 1991 and concurrent with the lead-up to Ukrainian independence on 24 August 1991, a nascent movement began in Odesa for the restoration of Novorossiya region; it however failed within days and never defined its borders.[10][11][12] The initial conception had not developed exact borders, but focus centred on the Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Crimean oblasts, with eventually other oblasts joining as well.[12][13]\n\nThe name received renewed emphasis when Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in an interview on 17 April 2014 that the territories of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa were part of what was called Novorossiya.[14][15][nb 2] In May 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic proclaimed the confederation of Novorossiya and its desire to extend its control towards all of southeastern Ukraine.[18][19][20] The confederation had little practical unity and within a year the project was abandoned: on 1 January 2015 the founding leadership announced the project had been put on hold, and on 20 May the constituent members announced the freezing of the political project.[21][22][23]\n\nAnna Nemtsova forecast this disintegration in August 2014, and she predicted the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine then too.[24] Oksana Yanyshevskaya, a Ukrainian government official, in a July 2014 interview with her said that Novorossiya \"is some sort of artificial idea that lives only in the minds of people in the Kremlin.\"[24]\n\nIn 2016 Marlène Laruelle wrote that Alexander Prokhanov formed the Izborsky Club around the Novorossiya meme.[25][26]\n\nGerard Toal opines that \"In breaking apart a sovereign territorial state, it is helpful, if not always necessary, to have an alternative geopolitical imaginary at the ready and for this ersatz replacement to have some degree of local credibility and support.\" The Novorossiya idea is just this portmanteau.[27][28]\n\nThe idea of Novorossiya goes hand-in-hand with the erasure of Ukrainian statehood,[29] or as Vladislav Surkov said in his defenestration interview in February 2020, \"There is Ukrainian-ness. That is, a specific disorder of the mind. An astonishing enthusiasm for ethnography, driven to the extreme.\" Surkov claims that Ukraine is \"a muddle instead of a state. […] But there is no nation. There is only a brochure, ‘The Self-Styled Ukraine’, but there is no Ukraine.\"[30]\n\nDuring the Wagner Group mutiny in June 2023, President Putin used the phrase in a speech responding to the mutiny, praising those \"who fought and gave their lives to Novorossiya and for the unity of the Russky Mir\".[31]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nEthnicity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ethnic composition of Novorossiya changed during the beginning of the 19th century due to the intensive movement of colonists who rapidly created towns, villages, and agricultural colonies. During the Russo-Turkish Wars, the major Turkish fortresses of Ozu-Cale, Akkerman, Khadzhibey, Kinburn and many others were conquered and destroyed. New cities and settlements were established in their places. Over time the ethnic composition varied.[clarification needed]\n\nMultiple ethnicities[clarification needed] participated in the founding of the cities of Novorossiya (most of these cities were expansions of older settlements[32]). For example:\n\nZaporizhzhia as formerly the site of a Cossack fort\n\nOdesa, founded in 1794 on the site of a Tatar village (the first recorded mention of a settlement located in current Odesa was in 1415[32]) by a Spanish general in Russian service, José de Ribas, had a French mayor, Richelieu (in office 1803–1814)\n\nDonetsk, founded in 1869, was originally named Yuzovka (Yuzivka) in honor of John Hughes, the Welsh industrialist who developed the coal region of the Donbas\n\nAccording to the report of governor Aleksandr Shmidt (ru), the ethnic composition of Kherson Governorate (which included the city of Odesa) in 1851 was as follows:[33]\n\nNationality Number % Ukrainians (Malorussians) 703,699 69.14 Romanians (Moldavians and Vlachs) 75,000 7.37 Jews 55,000 5.40 Russian-Germans 40,000 3.93 Great Russians 30,000 2.95 Bulgarians 18,435 1.81 Belarusians 9,000 0.88 Greeks 3,500 0.34 Romani people 2,516 0.25 Poles 2,000 0.20 Armenians 1,990 0.20 Karaites 446 0.04 Serbs 436 0.04 Swedes 318 0.03 Tatars 76 0.01 Former Officials 48,378 4.75 Nobles 16,603 1.63 Foreigners 10,392 1.02 Total Population 1,017,789 100\n\nLanguage\n\n[edit]\n\nWith regard to language usage, Russian was commonly spoken in the cities and some outside areas, while Ukrainian generally predominated in rural areas, smaller towns, and villages.[clarification needed]\n\nThe 1897 All-Russian Empire Census statistics show that Ukrainian was the native language spoken by most of the population of Novorossiya, but with Russian and Yiddish languages dominating in most city areas.[34][35][36]\n\nLanguage Kherson Guberniya Yekaterinoslav Guberniya Tavrida Guberniya Ukrainian 53.4% 68.9% 42.2% Russian 21.0% 17.3% 27.9% Belarusian 0.8% 0.6% 6.7% Polish 2.1% 0.6% 0.6% Bulgarian 0.9% – 2.8% Romanian 5.3% 0.4% 0.2% German 4.5% 3.8% 5.4% Jewish (sic) 11.8% 4.6% 3.8% Greek 2.3% 2.3% 1.2% Tatar 8.2% 8.2% 13.5% Turkish 2.6% 2.6% 1.5% Total Population 2,733,612 2,311,674 1,447,790\n\nThe 1897 All-Russian Empire Census statistics:[37]\n\nLanguage Odesa Yekaterinoslav Mykolaiv Kherson Sevastopol Mariupol Donetsk district Russian 198,233 47,140 61,023 27,902 34,014 19,670 273,302 Jewish (sic) 124,511 39,979 17,949 17,162 3,679 4,710 7 Ukrainian 37,925 17,787 7,780 11,591 7,322 3,125 177,376 Polish 17,395 3,418 2,612 1,021 2,753 218 82 German 10,248 1,438 813 426 907 248 2,336 Greek 5,086 161 214 51 1,553 1,590 88 Total Population 403,815 112,839 92,012 59,076 53,595 31,116 455,819\n\nList of founded cities\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of the cities that were founded (most of these cities were expansions of older settlements[32]) during the imperial period are major cities today.\n\nImperial Russian regiments were used to build these cities, at the expense of hundreds of soldiers’ lives.[32]\n\nFirst wave\n\n[edit]\n\nYelisavetgrad (Kropyvnytskyi) (1754)\n\nAleksandrovsk (Zaporizhzhia) (1770)\n\nYekaterinoslav (Dnipro) (1776)\n\nKherson (1778)\n\nMariupol (1778)\n\nOlviopol (Pervomaisk) (1781)\n\nSevastopol (1783)\n\nSimferopol (1784)\n\nMelitopol (1784)\n\nPavlohrad (1784)\n\nSecond wave\n\n[edit]\n\nMykolaiv (1789)\n\nTiraspol (1792)\n\nOdesa (1794)\n\nYekaterinodar (Krasnodar) (1794)\n\nThird wave\n\n[edit]\n\nBerdiansk (1827)\n\nNovorossiysk (1838)\n\nMelitopol (1842)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBattle of Kherson 2022\n\nWhite Russia\n\nDonetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic\n\nGreat Russia\n\nLittle Russia\n\nNew Serbia\n\nNovorossiya (confederation)\n\nOld Great Bulgaria\n\nRussian irredentism\n\nRussian occupation of Kherson Oblast 2022\n\nSlavo-Serbia\n\nSouthern Ukraine\n\nTerritorial evolution of Russia\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
