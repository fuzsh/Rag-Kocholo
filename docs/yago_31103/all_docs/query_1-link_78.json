        "text": "'Their Royal Highnesses, The Duke and Duchess of Kendal' by George Clint, circa 1823.\n\nGifted to the Royal Academy of Music by the Duke and Duchess to celebrate the opening of the school.​\n\n1822 starts out the way many years have been starting out for the British Royal Family: with babies. In January, it is announced from Hanover that Charlotte’s aunt, the Duchess of Cambridge, is pregnant with her second child. On February 22nd, Charlotte’s brother and sister-in-law, Ferdinand and Maria Antonia of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha-Kohary, are delivered of a daughter, named Princess Maria Antonia Auguste Juliana Charlotte Franziska of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha Kohary, [1] whose godparents include the Duke and Duchess of Kendal, the Emperor and Empress of Austria, and the Duchess of Parma, formerly the Empress of France [2]. On February 23rd, the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen delivers a healthy baby boy, named Ernst Georg Alexander, and titled from birth as the Hereditary Duke of Saxe-Meiningen [3]. This enigmatic heir will make his mark on history as a defender of chivalry, an avid protector of women and children, a collector of rare books, and the namesake of a particular species of Cassowary, which a friend compared him to, remarking that “Ernst is also quick with unexpected claws”. In early April, it is announced that Adelheid, the Duchess of Clarence and St. Andrews, is pregnant again and expecting sometime in the autumn. “May it be a boy!” Charlotte exclaims when she is informed of the news, receiving death glares from Victoire, who has become quite settled in her position as mother to the future King of Hanover, thank you, and is not excited about the possibility of her son being usurped (through a totally legitimate male cousin who conveniently comes ahead of him in the line of succession as dictated by the laws of Hanover). On April 24th, the Lord and Lady Romney welcome a small but lovely daughter, named The Hon. Emma Augusta Charlotte d’Este [4]. Emma d’Este will make her own mark on history as a famous royal diarist and commentator, her records providing ample evidence on the later Carolean and Georgian eras, as well as some very private royal scandals. “Someone give Emma a sword,” her cousin George of Kendal was said to teasingly remark when he came across her writing in her diary, “it shall do far less harm then her pen!”. On July 19th, the Princess Augusta Caroline Charlotte Elizabeth Mary Sophia Louise of Cambridge is born in Hanover [5]. Charlotte happily stands as godmother to all of them, and adds to her ever-growing list of godchildren [6] (Augustus d’Este will later joke that one of his hardest tasks as Charlotte’s secretary was keeping track of her godchildren and their birthdays and confirmations, which she always celebrated with a letter and a beautiful gift).\n\nLeopold himself is busy as well at this time: on May 23rd, he takes George to the launching of HMS Comet at Deptford Dockyard, letting the eager George smash the bottle of champagne against the ship’s prow. This is, Leopold later claims, the start of George’s love affair with the navy. Later that same month, Leopold, Lord Burghersh [7], French harpist Nicolas Bochsa [8], and the Duke of Wellington [9] (an interesting pairing of personalities if there ever was one) join together to found the Royal Academy of Music. On each of the founders’ birthdays (February 2, May 1, August 9, and December 16) each year since the founding, a free concert is performed by the students. Leopold will remain the royal patron of the Royal Academy of Music until his death. This patronage will be taken up by his second son, William, an accomplished violinist, said by a contemporary to be “unfortunately royal, for were he not, he could live by his bow”.\n\nIn May, another announcement comes: Charlotte herself is pregnant again, expecting in late autumn.\n\n​\n\nOn August 8th, ahead of her father’s trip to Scotland and technically against the advice of her doctors and husband, Charlotte herself takes young Prince George on another defining royal visit. She and her son arrive in time for the groundbreaking of St. David's College in Lampeter, Wales. Charlotte having donated a majority of the money needed to fund the school, she has been named it’s patroness, and is thanked in the speech by the Bishop of St. David’s [10]. Charlotte responds with a hastily learned sentence in Welsh, which will later serve as the school’s motto: Gair Duw Goreu Dysg (The Word of God is the Best Learning). This is the first of Charlotte’s many stage plan in winning popularity in Wales, and it goes off brilliantly: having come in person to the groundbreaking of the first institution of higher education in Wales, which she helped fund, and spoken Welsh (a sentence, yes, but more than any of her predecessors have done since who knows when), and made an effort to speak to the Bishop and many of the parishioners, Charlotte has established herself in the minds of the people of Wales as their princess. (Ironically, Scotland and Ireland with both later have the same thoughts, and it will become a running joke between the governments as to whom she loves best). George of Kendal himself is fascinated by the ceremony and the strange language, and is seen begging his mama to repeat the ‘funny words’ she spoke to him so that he too can say them. It is at this ceremony that Charlotte is introduced to a man who will define her son’s future: Llewellyn Lewellin [11], newly graduated from Oxford and a native of Wales. While Llewellyn does not join the royal household for almost a year after this meeting, it is generally agreed upon that this is the meeting that convinced Charlotte to hire him to be her son’s Welsh tutor and, later, religious studies tutor and personal chaplain. Twenty five years after this meeting, Llewellyn will still be corresponding with his ‘dear charge’ in Welsh, asking after the Prince’s children - the same dear charge will sign all of his personal letters from childhood to his death as ‘Siôr’, the Welsh for ‘George’.\n\nGeorge cries upon leaving Lampeter, according to legend, as he and his mother make way to Edinburgh, to meet the King on his royal Scottish tour. Set up by Sir Walter Scott, the tour begins on the 12th of August and continues to the 29th of August [12]. Charlotte and George of Kendal arrive early on the 17th of August, in time to attend a levee at Holyrood Palace with the King and the rest of the Kendals. Clad in bright red Royal Tartan, Charlotte’s father having ‘embraced’ his Stuart heritage, the royal family makes quite a sight. Auburn haired Charlotte and George Kendal, particularly the latter with his dark slanting eyes, are declared to be ‘the image of the Stuarts. This image does wonders for the royal family’s popularity in Scotland, and George IV does his best to present himself as a loving grandfather and pater familias (it doesn’t quite sell, but he does love his grandchildren and this makes it a touch easier for him to show it). Charlotte and young George even manage to win over the irascible Alastair Ranaldson MacDonell, The Chief of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry [13]. Thoroughly charmed by Charlotte during a reel, MacDonell dramatically ends the dance by declaring himself to be “my lady’s liege servant of life and limb” at the Caledonian Hunt Ball. To the surprise of those who know him (and his dramatic statements), it is a declaration that MacDonell will hold to for all his life, and preach unto his descendants. To the young Prince George of Kendal, MacDonell gifts two West Highland terrier puppies, promptly named ‘Noble’ and ‘Glenna’ [14], and a bunch of wildly inappropriate stories of Highland derring do. To Leopold, MacDonell gifts a bottle of whiskey and a warning to ‘mind well my Princess’. (Leopold is not a fan, but George of Kendal will fondly remember ‘Mac’ to the end of his days). In 2018, a direct descendant of the Chief, a Lady Charlotte Alexandra Rebecca MacDonell, will deliver to the Royal Charlotte and Leopold Museum a letter from Charlotte to her ancestor, in which she praises his loyalty and thanks him for his aid in sending a tutor to her son.\n\nThe visit wraps up nicely and everyone goes home where there is, of course, yet another scandal awaiting them. Taking advantage of everyone being out of town, Victoire has decided that it really has been too long since she pissed off the people her lifestyle is dependant on. She has continued writing to Sir John... Ponsonby, a ‘friend’ who is ‘traveling’ through Australia, and sends him money in every letter, to help with his ‘travels’. She has sent a letter inviting Mr. Ponsonby to come to Hanover - under her personal protection as the mother of the future king. Mr. Ponsonby, who can at least count the number of people looking to kill him if eggs before they hatch, declines the offer, but promises to come and serve her ‘faithfully as my only Queen’ once her son takes the throne. Of course, Ponsonby is not Conroy, Victoire protests when the contents and recipient of her letter are revealed. Their last name is different. Obviously. And since Sir John Conroy has been deemed a traitor -insert death glares at Charlotte-, Victoire would never dream of communicating with him. Obviously. The feud between Charlotte and Victoire racks up another notch, Leopold steps up his effort to find literally anyone to take Victoire off his hands, and in Australia, John Ponsonby ‘borrows’ a ship filled with goods and money. He’s going to return it. Obviously.\n\nOn September 25th, Adelheid is delivered of twin boys at Bushy Park [15]. The first boy, named William for his father, is small and sickly and passes from the world as he enters into it. The second boy, named George for his grandfathers, is small as well, but heartier than his brother and after a few anxious hours, looks fit for survival. The new heir to Hanover has been born. He is hurriedly christened the same day as his birth, and named ‘George William Augustus Leopold’ - for his grandfathers, his father, his uncle and godfather, and his first cousin by marriage and godfather. The entire family is ecstatic for the Clarences - William and Adelheid are devoted and loving parents to little Elizabeth, and their joy in another child is such that one would have to be heartless to not be happy for them. Auguste, the Duchess of Cambridge, writes a letter of congratulations that is twenty pages long, and Charlotte is so happy for them that she weeps every time she sees her new godson.\n\nVictoire is, of course, spitting blood. Her son has been unjustly usurped - how this has happened, no one can quite explain, but Victoire is sure of it [16]. And she is going to get her son a crown, come hell or high water.\n\nThe Kendal household is at an all-new level of tension. Victoire is convinced that Charlotte and Leopold maliciously betrayed her and their nephew by standing as godparents to the throne-stealing Prince George of Clarence. Charlotte is convinced that Victoire has decided that the best way to get her son onto the throne is to drive everyone ahead of him in the succession insane, and thinks her “dearest sister” should go sit at the bottom of a lake. For a good long while. Leopold thinks he needs a drink. At the end of November, the fragile peace in the Kendal household is shattered with two almost simultaneous events. On November 22nd, after a short labor, Charlotte is delivered of a second daughter, whom she and Leopold decide to name Mary for Charlotte’s aunt, the Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh. Victoire, with her usual tact, is miffed that the baby is not named for her. On November 23rd, after being suddenly seized with an intro-susception of the bowels, Edward, the Duke of Kent and until recently heir to Hanover, dies [17].\n\nVictoire falls into a fit of grief so severe that later Charlotte will write to the Duchess of Cambridge that “we feared for her sanity - she had to have someone with her at all times, for in her grief, she was prone to such fits and flights that her person and very life was at risk”. Her only comfort was her daughter, Drina, whom she tries to keep by her side constantly. (Drina actively hates this and will later quite literally run from anyone showing any form of negative emotions, remarking to her husband that “having served as Mama’s comfort after the death of my brother, I no longer have any comfort to give anyone else”). At Charlotte’s request, Victoire and Leopold’s brother Ferdinand and his wife Maria Antonia come to England to care for Victoire, who has turned against the Kendals completely and has become convinced that Charlotte is responsible for the death of her son. She attacks Mary Gillray Stockmar in the nursery one evening, shrieking that she knows that Gilly poisoned her son on Charlotte’s command, and would make her confess if she had to kill her for the confession. Victoire begins screaming every time she sees George and William of Kendal, “long keening notes of grief that rend one’s heart with their sorrow and turn one’s blood cold with the note of madness in them”, as Auntie Fred writes to the Duchess of Cambridge. Adelheid’s name can no longer be mentioned in Claremont with Victoire shrieking. She goes so far as to threaten the new Princess Mary, remarking ominously to Ferdinand that Charlotte should “know her pain, and would soon enough have her own poison turned against her”. Christmas passes quietly and uncelebrated at Claremont.\n\nClearly, Victoire can no longer remain with the Kendals. It is Maria Antonia who offers up a solution. Victoire can come to Vienna with Ferdinand and Maria Antonia and stay in a private wing of their palace, or even travel to their palace in Lower Austria with a nurse should she wish more privacy. Once she is suitably recovered, she can go to Coburg and stay with her brother, Ernst. Victoire and Leopold’s brother, Ernst, and his wife Luise are having issues. As in, sleeping with everything that moves, barely speaking, not even tolerating each other issues. Separation is imminent. Maria Antonia proposes that Victoire if moved to Coburg to stay with Ernst and Luise, she can possibly serve as a quasi-mother to their two young sons, Ernst and Albrecht. Charlotte is wary of the idea of sending Victoire to a home with two young boys - despite their difficult relationship, Charlotte is not cruel [18]. When the idea is proposed to Victoire, however, she expresses interest in it. She does not want to be in England any longer and the idea of going to Hanover is physically repulsive. Vienna holds no memories, and she and Ferdinand have been close since childhood. The plan is set, when a final issue comes up: Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent. As a Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, which is not technically playing well with Austria, there are issues with Drina accompanying her mother to Vienna. In addition, the question of Drina’s guardianship has never been fully answered. As the head of the family, George IV believes he has custody of the princess. Victoire believes she does, as she possesses a document from her husband granting guardianship of Drina to her. The document was unwitnessed, however, and is very legally questionable. Not to mention, given Victoire’s state of mind, no one is exactly pushing for her to be in charge of her four year old daughter. A compromise is struck: George IV formally grants guardianship of Drina to Leopold and Charlotte, who promise to reunite Drina and Victoire when Victoire’s health is recovered.\n\nIn early January of 1823, Ferdinand and Maria Antonia return to Vienna with Victoire, seventy trunks of luggage, and a nurse hired from a respected sanitorium in tow. On January 22nd, Charlotte and Leopold’s newest daughter is quietly baptised as ‘Mary Adelaide Louisa’. Her godparents include the Duchess of St. Clarence and Andrews, the Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh, The Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg [19], the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (represented by Baron Christian Stockmar), the Duke of Cambridge, and Duke Alexander of Wurttemberg (represented by Augustus d’Este) [20]. Mary will later be considered the most beautiful of the Kendal girls, and the one most similar to her mother. Later in January, another lightning bolt hits the Kendal household. Augustus d’Este, attending the funeral of a friend, is struck with sudden blindness [21]. The blindness dissipates after a few hours, but everyone is concerned, particularly since the doctors have no explanation. Strange symptoms began to plague him intermittently throughout the year, including weakness of the legs and hands, numbness, dizziness, and even bladder disturbances. These symptoms will never again leave Augustus, and will recur more and more frequently and severely throughout the remaining years of his life. As his symptoms worsen, he tries to leave Charlotte’s service. She releases him from his duties but keeps him on her payroll as an ‘advisor’ - Mary Fitzclarence d’Este, Lady Romney, takes over the physical portion of her husband’s job and incidentally becomes the first female royal Secretary. Around this time, Llewelyn Lewellin joins the Kendal household and begins teaching Welsh to Charlotte and George.\n\nThe Kendals do not attend any events until March, out of mourning for the young Duke of Kent. In March, they attend the official opening of the Royal Academy of Music, where they are welcomed with enthusiastic applause. After the performance, the Duke of Wellington takes the Kendal children backstages and introduces them to Nicolas Bocsha, who teaches the wide-eyed George of Kendal how to strum a harp. The Duke himself hands the violin to young William, who will later recall the moment as “the beginning of his love of the violin”. Young Lolly is too small for instruments but is enchanted by the music and attempts to clap her hands in time. “It is such a dear memory, one that is unfortunately very unknown: the Beef himself, Old Wellington, patiently showing little Will how to finger the strings, Lolly on his lap.” The Duke of Wellington will thereafter consider himself an honorary godfather to the Kendal children, who will all fondly remember him as such, and despite political differences, he and Charlotte will always be united in their love of her children.\n\nIn July, Robert Peel ensures the passage of five Acts of Parliament, effectively abolishing the death penalty for over one hundred offences. Despite his Tory allegiance, Peel finds an ally for his acts in Charlotte, who remarks that “we mete out death far too quickly, for offenses that could be corrected, to men who we value less than horses” [22]. The Judgement of Death Act allows judges to commute sentences for capital offences other than murder or treason to imprisonment or transportation. This act earns a wry smile from Charlotte, who remarks that Sir John Conroy did not flee his punishment after all - he was simply ahead of the law in transporting himself to the colonies.\n\nOn the 23rd of September, the Burmese attack the British on Shalpuri, an island close to Chittagong, claimed by the East Indian Trading Company. This is the start of what will be the costliest and longest war of British involvement in India. One week later, the fifth pregnancy of Charlotte, the Duchess of Kendal, is announced. At this point, people are starting to bring up the question about Charlotte being named Princess of Wales again - Caroline, still in Italy with Pergami ‘attending’ her, is still clearly not going anywhere so for now, George is not having any more legitimate children. George again declines, remarking to Lord Liverpool that “if she is made Princess of Wales in her own right, what shall her husband be called?”. “The Duke of Kendal, sir” is the infamous reply [23].\n\nIn Vienna, Victoire begins to recuperate, and is able to spend time with her Kohary nephews, remarking sadly that her own Edward would have enjoyed them so. The news of Charlotte’s new pregnancy is not well received; Maria Antonia writes, in all sincere sweetness, to the Kendals that “I do not think you should ask Victoire to stand as godmother”.\n\n1823 ends rather quietly for the British royal family. George IV retreats further into his building and his beloved Lady Conyngham. Charlotte and Leopold spend a quiet Christmas with their children and Auntie Fred. The Clarences enjoy Christmas at Bushy House with their two children and give thanks for their blessings. The Cambridges celebrate in Hanover, along with the Cumberlands. Caroline and Bartolomeo Pergami ring in the new year in their usual fashion. In Vienna, Victoire celebrates Christmas with the Koharys, and sends gifts and letters to Drina at Claremont; she also sends a letter to Charlotte and Leopold regarding Drina’s guardianship that goes unanswered. She also sends letters and gifts to Australia, but that’s nobody’s business. John Ponsonby celebrates the holidays by burning a ship and robbing another. The Stockmars travel to the spa in Baden, officially to take the waters for a cure, and unofficially to give Gilly time to recover from a miscarriage in November. “One must pray for peace and serenity in this coming year”, Leopold writes to a friend in Russia, “for God knows we have had little of it these last two”.\n\nCredit where it's due, it's a very good prayer. It’s also not going to be answered.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n​\n\n[1] OTL she was named Viktoria for her aunt and cousin, but given their low stock at the moment, the Koharys decided to name her for her mother and maternal grandmother\n\n[2] Marie Louise, former wife of Napoleon, who was made the Duchess of Parma after the fall of the French Empire.\n\n[3] OTL Bernhard’s son was named Georg, but there’s just too many of them in this TL. ITL, Ernst is named for Ernst I, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and ancestor of the Dukes of Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg, Saxe-Romhild, Saxe-Eisenburg, Saxe-Hildburghausen, and Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.\n\n[4] OTL Augustus d’Este never married or had children. The name Emma comes from his sister, named Augusta Emma d’Este. Because similar to Georges, there’s too many Augustas running around.\n\n[5] This was her OTL name.\n\n[6] For those of you keeping track, Charlotte’s godchildren include George Fitzgerald (currently the Marquess of Kildare and later Duke of Leinster, son of Charlotte’s friend Augutus Fitzgerald), Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, Prince Albrecht of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha, Princess Louise d’Artois, The Comte de Chambord, Princess Sophie of Wurttemberg, Princess Elizabeth of Clarence, Princess Maria Antonia of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha-Kohary, The Hereditary Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, The Hon. Emma d’Este, Princess Augusta of Cambridge, and Prince George of Clarence.\n\n[7] John Fane, later the Earl of Westmorland\n\n[8] Robert Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, a French harpist and opera composer, famous for his scandalous romance with opera singer Anna Bishop.\n\n[9] Yes, that Duke of Wellington. He was a keen violinist, who was determined to make the Academy a success. Pay attention, he’s coming back.\n\n[10] Thomas Burgess. English author, philosopher, Bishop of St David's and Bishop of Salisbury. OTL he funded and endowed St. David’s College in Lampeter in order to educate Welsh clergy to be able to preach to their flocks, and do so in Welsh. Burgess opposed Catholic Emancipation, leading to several clashes with leading figures. The Duke of Wellington told him sharply that he would do far more to strengthen the Protestant faith by staying in his diocese and minding his flock than he could by bombarding the Government with political pamphlets. Burgess disagreed.\n\n[11] The Very Rev. Llewellyn Lewellin. Welsh cleric and academic, OTL the first principal of St David's College and the first Dean of St David's.\n\n[12] This was an OTL trip and I just couldn’t leave it out. George IV in a kilt, you guys. C’mon.\n\n[13] Colonel Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry. His haughty and flamboyant personality gave Walter Scott the basis for his wild Highland clan chieftain Fergus Mac-Ivor in the novel Waverly. During George IV’s visit to Scotland, MacDonell made several scenes regarding the fact that Lowlanders were allowed to be in the Celtic society welcoming the King.\n\n[14] OTL Queen Victoria owned a Collie named Noble - I loved the name and wanted to see it carry on. And yes, Glenna is for Glengarry. And yes, MacDonell is being petty by giving West Highland terriers and I love it.\n\n[15] OTL Adelheid’s stillborn twin boys were born at Bushy Park in May of 1825. Since it doesn’t say anywhere how far along the pregnancy was, I chose to give her a few more months in the pregnancy and one surviving son.\n\n[16] As previously stated, Hanover has a strict agnatic line of succession, meaning only males could inherit. As a son born of a legitimate marriage of a man further ahead in the line of succession, George of Clarence takes precedence over Edward, The Duke of Kent.\n\n[17] OTL it was Adelheid and William’s second daughter, Elizabeth of Clarence, who died of intussusception of the bowels. The symptoms look remarkably similar to poison - abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools.\n\n[18] Maria Antonia and Ferdinand have two sons at this point, Ferdiand and August, as do Ernst and Luise, Ernst and Albrecht.\n\n[19] Born Princess Lovise Auguste of Denmark, daughter of Christian VII of Denmark and Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, making her a first cousin once removed of Charlotte.\n\n[20] Husband of Leopold’s sister Antoinette, brother to Empress Mariya Feodorovna of Russia.\n\n[21] OTL this happened in December 1822, but there’s a lot going on then already, so I simply moved it forward a month. This is the start of Augustus’ multiple sclerosis symptoms.\n\n[22] This is a reference to the 1776 quote by the Marquess of Halifax: \"Men are not hanged for stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen\".\n\n[23] This is a reference to George VI’s refusal to title the-now Elizabeth II as the Princess of Wales in her own right.\n\nSchloss Rosenau, Coburg\n\n\"Oh, that this year would end - it seems every time one takes a step forward, be it politics or personal, there comes a nasty wind to knock us two steps back\" -\n\nLetter from The Duchess of Kendal to The Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nNovember 30, 1824​\n\nThe year of 1824 is ushered in grandly at Claremont, with a holiday ball and party that extends to Charlotte’s birthday six days later. From Mary and Augustus d’Este, she receives two gifts: a book of poetry and the news that they are expecting a second child. Despite his illness, Auntie Fred notes, Augustus seems determined to give it the old Hanover try at repopulating the world in his own image. “At least they make lovely children” she remarks in a letter to Auguste, Duchess of Cambridge, who will herself note that Emma d’Este is a “lovely, lively little girl, devoted to Missy [Princess Mary of Kendal] and Lolly [Princess Charlotte of Kendal]”. From France, her friend Maria Carolina sends some of Voltaire’s works in the original French, as well as a locket containing a new portrait of Louise and Henri. Among her gifts, Charlotte receives a book of Welsh lore from Llewelyn Lewellin, now firmly settled in as a member of the Kendal household as George’s Welsh tudor and a sometime-chaplain. Charlotte’s Welsh is improving, though slowly, and young George Kendal has taken to it like a duck to water. Leopold is not interested, William and Lolly learn a few sentences to please their mother, and Auntie Fred surprisingly becomes fluent in a short period of time. “The benefit of not retaining any foolishness is to leave one’s brain open to Welshness” she famously quips. Auntie Fred in particular is fond of the Welsh cleric and teases him mercilessly about a cleric giving a book of mythology as a gift.\n\nLeopold wins the birthday gift giving game, however - thanks to good money management, careful investments, and general Leopold shrewdness, he has convinced the King and government to sell him Falkland Palace in Scotland for a song [1]. It’ll cost a few more tunes - more like an opera or two - to fully fix up the palace, but that’s what Leopold’s pennies have been saved for. It will serve as another step in Charlotte’s plan to immerse herself and her heirs in the affections and understanding of the countries that make up the United Kingdom. In Scotland, upon hearing the news, dear old Mac - better known as The Chief of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry - sets to work finding a Gaelic tutor for the royal family, \"to set them up properly in Falkland\".\n\nFrom Victoire in Austria, Charlotte receives a letter containing absolutely no well wishes, and full of complaints and demands, including:\n\nMary Gillray Stockmar be removed immediately from Charlotte’s service, having contributed “most maliciously” to the death of Victoire’s son\n\nThat Emma d’Este be removed from the royal nursery and not allowed to play with Drina of Kent, being the daughter of ‘mere bastards brought up from Mr and Miss by sheer familial kindness’\n\nThat Drina’s status as a Princess of Great Britain and Hanover be maintained properly at all times (how this is to be done is not stated)\n\nThat Charlotte and Leopold immediately denounce the Clarences and stop all relations with them, as they “obviously” murdered Victoire’s son and displaced her daughter in the line of succession deliberately\n\nThat Drina of Kent, still under the guardianship of the Kendals, be sent to Austria immediately and returned to the care of her mother\n\nVictoire’s letter -and demands- go unanswered by the Kendals. In Austria, Ferdinand sends his own letter to his brother, officically to announce the birth of his third son, named Leopold for his uncle [2]; unofficially, it is to warn Leopold that “Victoire will not let this go lightly - she is insistent upon her rights and her daughter.”\n\nFor the rest of Britain, however, the year is not starting so well. 1824 begins with a crushing blow to British forces in the Gold Coast, fighting the Ashanti for control of the coast, and leading to the death of the British governor of the protectorate, Sir Charles MacCarthy. MacCarthy’s dishonor isn’t done however - his skulled is rimmed with gold and used as a drinking cup by Ashanti rulers [3]. The British were overrun, suffered losses, and ran out of ammunition. Almost all the British forces were killed immediately; only around 20 managed to escape. This is the start of the first Anglo-Ashanti war, and the story of MacCarthy’s golden rimmed drinking skull will be used to further British hatred for years to come. (Auntie Fred remarks privately that since MacCarthy’s skull was obviously empty, having attempted to take on the Ashanti with 500 soldiers, it was nice of the chiefs to fill his skull for him). Charlotte and Leopold themselves meet with Alexander Gordon Laing [3] when he arrives in London with the official dispatches of the situation, and Charlotte sets to work setting up a foundation to give financial aid to the widows and children of the men lost in the beginning of the war, while Leopold and Stockmar set about getting donations. Auntie Fred sponsors twenty girls from the families to go through training at Charlotte’s governess school every year for the rest of her life; for the next three generations, the young members of the British and Hanover royal families will be cared for by ‘Frederica girls’, as they are known.\n\nFebruary passes in a patriotic fervor that goes on into March, when the First Anglo-Burmese War begins, following border clashes in Arakan. This is a little more awkward for the Kendals - part of the British casus belli is a desire to deny the French access to the Burmese harbors and limit their already extensive influence. Given Charlotte’s friendship with the mother of the heir presumptive to the throne of France, she keeps a rather low profile regarding this war. There is an ugly moment when someone (rumored to be an agent of the still-wrathful Victoire) shouted at a bazaar opening that Charlotte was feeding British military secrets to the French through her friendship with Maria Carolina - the crowd becomes agitated to the point where Charlotte was more or less removed from the scene rather forcibly by her guards. Her popularity definitely takes a hit from the scene, and she is not a fan. Rather defiantly, Charlotte continues to be loyal to Maria Carolina, writing to her friend that “the politics of men cannot touch upon the love of women, and all my love, my dear friend, goes to you and yours”. Her loyalty to her friend is touching, but Leopold is thinking that there’s a smarter way to win points than by more or less sticking their tongues out at the people’s opinions. He takes advantage of the visit of Hendrik Fagel and Anton Reinhard Falck to have a few conversations with the good gentlemen of the Netherlands, sent to sign the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824. Nothing official, of course. Just some conversations. Maybe a few ideas are exchanged. Maybe some diplomatic policies that will eventually affect that entire future of Europe are tossed about. Nothing serious, mind you.\n\nThe royal family gets a boost in popularity on April 29th, when Charlotte -after a hellish labor of 13 hours- delivers her fifth child at Dutch House, a small son who enters the world with “two shrill cries, followed by a solemn stare that reminded one of his grandfather in it’s ferocity” as Christian Stockmar later records. Leopold, in a letter to his sister Juliana, is more candid: “The little one is all Hanover - he seems unimpressed with us so far”. A week later, on May 6th in the sitting room of Dutch House, Prince Frederick Ernest William George of Kendal is baptized. His godparents include the Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh [5], the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz [6] (represented by Lady Romney), Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland [7], the Crown Prince of Prussia [8] (represented by The Hon. Henry Fox [9]), the King of the Netherlands [10] (represented by the Duke of Leinster [11]), and the Queen of the Netherlands [12] (represented by Miss Augusta Fitzclarence [13]). The King and Queen of the Netherlands as godparents is Leopold’s idea, taken up enthusiastically by George IV and the government, as a way of sweetening the deal of the new treaty. Charlotte is okay with the godparents - Auntie Fred says nice things about Wilhelmine, and Charlotte is really a little too weak to be arguing diplomacy at this moment in time. The new baby is a “rather serious little fellow” charitably writes the Baroness Stockmar, now officially serving as the governess and direct supervisor of two nursemaids. Frederick - later known as “His Royal Coldness” and “The Stone Duke” - will later be considered a bad combination of both of his parents’ best traits: “having inherited the ferocity and ambition of the Coburgs, he also inherited the pride and stubbornness of the Hanovers, with a special chill all his own” as a later biographer will write. “I’d call him a cold bastard,” Frederick’s brother William would once apparently comment (the accuracy of the comment is debated by historians) “but to call him a bastard would be a slander on my gracious mother”.\n\nAfter the news of Charlotte and Leopold’s newest son reaches Austria, “a magnificent scene erupts in the apartments of the Dowager Duchess of Kent”, as a member of Maria Antonia’s household writes to Baron Stockmar. Victoire begins to “wail and scream about the cruelty and betrayal of her brother by having a son when her own had been murdered by his wife’s family - probably with her help, the Duchess insists.” Maria Antonia attempts to downplay the scene when she writes to Charlotte afterwards, writing that “Victoire, through no fault of yours or hers, found her natural joy quite dampened, as I am sure you can understand, by the memory of her own dear lost boy. She became quite moved by the idea. If you don’t mind a bit of advice, my dearest, from one who loves you both - please don’t write to her of the baby, or ask her to be godmother. She is also quite pleased at your care of dear Drina but cannot help but miss her darling girl, as I’m sure you can understand, and eagerly looks forward to her reunion with her child”. “Dear diplomatic Antonia - what a pity we cannot set her loose for our own sake and reap the benefits of her understanding ourselves!” Charlotte writes in the margins of the letter before showing it to Leopold. The question of Drina returning to her mother has again been forced onto the Kendals, which Leopold neatly dodges by writing to Maria Antonia that while he would be happy to reunite his niece and sister, with Charlotte recovering from Frederick’s birth and their upcoming obligations, he cannot commit to a meeting until at least July, possibly later. Recovering from childbirth, Charlotte misses the official entrance on May 18th of King Kamehameha II of Hawaii and his Queen Consort Kamāmalu, and the reception held on the 28th for the couple. She is impressed by King Kamehameha’s refusal to enter Westminster Abbey [14], and intrigued by the royal couple. On June 4th, she, Auntie Fred, and Leopold accompany the King and Queen to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, making quite a stir amongst the attendees. Charlotte will later write that she found the royal couple “most intriguing - terribly exotic. The dear king was so interested in everything in England, and his queen - one could not doubt her great love for her king”. Auntie Fred wrote her own memories of the evening, commenting on the tongue tattoo of the Queen and wondering where she could get one of her own [15].\n\nThree days later, on June 7th, Charlotte and Leopold attend a grand reception at Buckingham House, held by the King to commemorate the signing of the Anglo-Dutch treaty. At the reception, it is also privately whispered that as a cherry on top of the treaty, the Duke of Kendal has unofficially betrothed his eldest daughter to the eldest grandson and heir presumptive to the King of the Netherlands [16]. The Duchess of Kendal - having refused her own Dutch marriage to choose her own husband, the aforementioned Duke - is believed to be the reason that the betrothal is unofficial. A biographer of Princess Charlotte “Lolly” of Kendal will later write that “The Duchess of Kendal, having escaped her own forced noose, was unlikely to agree to stick her four year old daughther in one. Charlotte was too clever to not see the political advantage of keeping the Dutch close to British interest - despite her wishes, she knew that a marriage between the Comte de Chambord and Lolly would never be allowed. Charlotte was also too clever to put her eggs in one basket. In 1824, Charlotte and Leopold only had two daughters, ages four and two, in an era where child mortality was common. An unofficial betrothal bought time and promised much while giving nothing - a perfect type of engagement for a Coburg-Hanover daughter”. There is no mention of the female Coburg-Hanover bargaining chip, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, in this biography, nor at the time of the unofficial engagement.\n\nIn July, the visiting Queen Kamāmalu and King King Kamehameha II of Hawaii die six days apart from each other of measles. On July 18, the bodies were stored in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields church while awaiting transportation back to Hawaii [17] - Charlotte and Leopold represented the royal family at a brief service for the couple in the church. Two days after the service, the Kendals are traveling for the summer - not to Claremont, as Charlotte had been wanting, but to Coburg. It has been selected as a nice neutral meeting ground for the reunion of Victoire and Drina. God knows it’s not a nice neutral place for anything else, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha and his wife Luise having separated a few months before. Charlotte does not bring along the d’Estes, as Augustus is having another attack of his illness and they have retreated to Lamb House in Rye for the foreseeable future; Auntie Fred has elected to stay with them for the time being as well, refusing to even consider traveling to “little Coburg”. Instead, she brings along two new members of her household: Miss Augusta Fitzclarence and Miss Augusta d’Este, known better in the family as Aggie and Gusta, new maids in waiting for their cousin. The Koharys will be attending the reunion as well, along with Marie and Bernhard from Saxe-Meiningen and their children (their son Ernst having been joined in March by a daughter named Eleonore [18]). The general theory is the more people around, the better - not a bad theory by any means, but not a particularly wise one when it comes to this family.\n\nThe first meeting is as dramatic as everyone expects. Victoire falls to her knees, gathers her daughter in her arms and wails about her love for her only child (in front of her other two children, invited to Coburg for the reunion [19]) and how they shall never be separated again, with intense side glares at Charlotte during the entire encounter. Charlotte responds by ignoring Victoire and greeting Karl and Feodore, the latter of whom she has not seen since she returned to Leiningen after her mother had moved to Vienna (Karl and Feodore, for what it’s worth, have taken neutrality as their official party line in the Victoire-Charlotte debacle). Charlotte has a possible match in mind for her pretty niece, but she’s certainly not going to say a word where Victoire can hear her about the whole thing. Maria Antonia, trying desperately to keep the peace, invites everyone to retire to the garden for a picnic lunch while the children play. Victoire, refusing to give an inch now that she’s gotten her mile, insists on bringing Drina to the lunch and sitting the child next to her. Drina remembers this day bitterly later in her diaries, remarking that “all the other children scampered off to play with Baroness Stockmar and the Fitzclarence cousins, whilst I remained with Mama and the adults. I was pleased to see her, of course, but my childish heart was stung at being left out”. After lunch, the adults scatter to their own devices - Charlotte and Maria Antonia, long distance friends for years, take advantage of the informality to spend time with the children. Charlotte, in particular, devotes attention to her godson Albrecht - the “poor little motherless lamb” as she refers to him. (Unofficially, Charlotte is on Luise’s team in the separation, and later Albrecht will fondly remember his aunt and “the kindness always shown by her to my mother”).\n\nLuise is not invited.​\n\nIt is in these hacyclon days in Coburg that a friendship is sealed that will affect the entire face of Europe in generations to come: George of Kendal and Albrecht of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Two years apart, the two boys are, at first glance, as different as water and oil. Their mutual aunt, Maria Antonia, would describe them as thus: “Georgie, dear thing, is all Hanover charm and Coburg wit, with Lotte’s joie de vivre and Leo’s natural authority... Albrecht, quiet and sweet and so watchful, more likely to read than to run, unless Georgie leads him to it”. This friendship will survive familial disputes, marriages, miles of separation, losses, victories, and politics, and will later be the subject of several books, as well as feature heavily in every biography written about both members of the pair.\n\nBack in England, on August 24th, Mary d’Este has delivered at half past five in the afternoon of a “healthy, hearty, gurgling little boy”. He is named Augustus William Frederick, for his father, maternal grandfather, and great-aunt Frederica, who was at Mary’s side all through the labor and the first person after his father to hold him. Augustus d’Este the Younger (called Auwi by his loving family) will be known for his collection of Chinese artifacts, his vast and much loved collection of animals, his generous heart, and having his hair turn completely white by the age of twenty-two.\n\nThe summer speeds away in the warm Coburg sunshine, and when the first week of September rolls around, everyone is of agreement that the visit -while very good- is ready to end. Bernhard and Marie, four months pregnant with her third child, are the first to leave, promising to come visit Charlotte and Leopold in London after the baby is born. and sending love to Adelheid and William and their children. (Obviously not in Victoire’s earshot, because Marie really just does not feel like physically throwing down with her aunt at this moment in time). The Kendals prepare to leave themselves, packing up their belongings - as well as Drina’s. Charlotte has been hoping for a peaceful leave-taking but since that’s obviously not going to happen, they have come prepared. During the trip, George IV had been persuaded by a certain son-in-law to write a letter demanding the return of the Princess Alexandrine Victoria of Kent to England at the end of the trip, where she will maintain a permanent basis with her aunt and uncle, who are also her legal guardians, until the time comes for her to marry. Why, you may be asking, has Leopold taken such a blatant stance against his sister in this? Well, he does love Drina and is willing to admit that Victoire probably isn’t the best guardian at this moment or mental state. Also, he’s remembered how to count and decided that SIX Hanover-Coburg marital bargaining chips are infinitely better than five, and since God only knows what Victoire will cook up for Drina’s marital prospects, it really is better that Leopold with his vast understanding of politics and all-consuming desire to see a Coburg under every crown be allowed to make such decisions.\n\nBut of course, no one is actually saying that last bit out loud. Leopold is just all thinking it. Really loudly.\n\nAs expected, this sets off another of Victoire’s emotional scenes, but this time Leopold is not budging. He’s willing to compromise, mind you, provided the compromise suits him. Drina is returning to England. Victoire is welcome to return to England and rejoin their household. Victoire absolutely refuses to do so. It is Brother Ernst, surprisingly, who has absented himself from the drama during the visit, who offers up a solution. As his wife has maliciously abandoned him and their sons and given into her promiscuous ways - and yes, that is the official party line in Coburg - , he is in need of a grande dame of the realm. Victoire should move to Coburg to take over that role, and also provide maternal love and care to little Ernst and Albrecht. Coburg is not the hostile territory to Great Britain that Austria is (truthfully, George IV and the British government tend to forget Coburg exists a good majority of the time), so Drina can come and visit as often as she pleases, and of course, Victoire can and should go as often as she pleases, and even take the boys with her when she does. Ferdinand and Maria Antonia, a little worn out with all their ‘understanding’, are on board. Charlotte and Leopold are on board. Drina, for whom the bloom is off the rose in the whole maternal situation, is on board. Victoire accepts, acknowledging in a letter to a certain pirate that her situation “would be infinitely better and more respected and of real worth” in Coburg than in London. As the Kendals are preparing to depart Coburg, a letter arrives from Paris: the King of France, Louis XVIII, has died. His brother, the Comte de Artois, has succeeded to the throne as Charles X. His son, the Duc de Angoulême, has become the Dauphin. As the Dauphin and Dauphine have no children, the succession then falls to the Comte de Chambord, Charlotte’s godson.\n\nAfter some debating that delays their time in Coburg even longer, His Majesty’s Government states that, should she feel it appropriate, The Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Kendal, has their agreement in making a private, personal call in Paris on the royal family there to convey condolences, given the friendship between the royal families [20]. Emphasis on the words ‘private’ and ‘personal’. Charlotte and Leopold agree - not that Leopold really got a vote in this situation, as Charlotte was going hell or high water to see her friend after spending what feels like hell in Coburg -, and travel quietly to France. They are greeted as private citizens at Tuileries Palace, where their warm friendship with the French royal family is renewed. Madame Dauphine will write in her diary that “We saw today the Kendals, dear Lotte and Leopold, and their five (!) little ones, along with their poor little niece - such a pity for her, for I fear given her unusual circumstances, her future shall be rather unsettled. Perhaps a marriage to a cousin will be best” (Yes, she sees the irony in the statement, and no, Madame does not give a damn). Leopold, never one to miss an opportunity, sets to work with Maria Carolina, more ambitious than people give credit for, on planning the future dynasties of Europe. Any match between Charlotte of Kendal and the Comte de Chambord is shut down fairly quickly, as is the suggestion of Princess Louise and Prince George. (As Auntie Fred will note in her diary “The British-French marriages seem to always result in someone dying” [21]). However, Leopold has a few more aces to play. Drina of Kent, for example, could do nicely for the Comte de Chambord - she is a British princess but not the daughter of the future Queen, so the government would in theory be less picky about her conversion. Unfortunately for Leopold, after Victoire’s visit to Paris in 1821, that ship has sailed, wrecked, and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. But that’s okay - he’s got other options: the Princes and Princess of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha-Koháry, who are related to the future British Queen but not British, and already Catholic. Their mother’s noble birth makes them unacceptable to marry the last son of the French Bourbons - but Maria Carolina has got other relatives of her own: namely, the Princes and Princesses of Orléans [22]. Their family is next in line to the French throne should her son have no male issue, and Maria Carolina has already planned for that contingency by betrothing her daughter Louise to the Orléans’ heir, Ferdinand Philippe. Ferdinand Philippe has sisters, however, who could do nicely for Leopold’s nephew Ferdinand. Granted, it’s a tenuous marriage alliance and neither of the parents of the children being discussed have agreed (or even been brought into the loop), but it could work.\n\nAfter two weeks in Paris, Charlotte and Leopold return to England, going immediately to Claremont where they will remain for the rest of the year in quiet, familial seclusion. The d’Estes and Auntie Fred rejoin them in November from Romney. November is not a good month for the British: in the third week of November, 400 families are left homeless from the Great Fire of Edinburgh. Charlotte and Leopold not only send money and food, Charlotte personally sees to helping find shelter for the families, while Leopold sends a note to his architect on the scene that the families left homeless in the fire shall be offered employment either restoring or working at Falkland Palace, and shall be allowed to reside there for as long as needed, or there will be a severe royal dressing down coming his way. On the 23rd of November, literally two days after the fire has ended, there is a great storm in the English channel that devastates Sidmouth, Weymouth, and Lyme Regis, washing away the ferry from the Isle of Portland and destroying the quays at Weymouth.\n\nIt’s an unsurprising end to a year that’s had a very “one step forward, two steps back” feeling to it, as Charlotte describes it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------​\n\n[1] It was actually bought by John, 3rd Marquess of Bute in 1887, but when Leopold does real estate, Leopold does real estate.\n\n[2] Prince Leopold Franz Julius of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha-Koháry, born January 31, 1824. Famously offered as a possible spouse for Isabel II of Spain, he later made a morganatic marriage to concert pianist Constanze Greiger.\n\n[3] This is entirely OTL - even I couldn’t make this up.\n\n[4] Alexander Gordon Laing, British explorer and the first European to reach Timbuktu. He more or less got the hell out of Dodge when it came to the situation in Ghana, only to die five weeks after leaving Timbuktu.\n\n[5] William Frederick, the Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, brother to Princess Sophia Matilda. A nephew of George III, he was originally intended to marry Charlotte of Wales; after she refused him, he married his cousin Princess Mary of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and became Charlotte’s uncle through marriage. He was rather pompous and known to ‘keep more state than the king’. The general public opinion of him is shown by his nickname, \"Silly Billy”.\n\n[6] Born HH Princess Marie of Hesse-Kassel, she was the sister to Auguste, Duchess of Cambridge; she was also descended from the British royal family through her grandmother Mary, The Landgravine of Hesse, a daughter of George II.\n\n[7] The fifth daughter of George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the favorite paternal aunt of Charlotte, Duchess of Kendal. She never married officially but according to legend, she was a lover of and possibly married to General Thomas Garth, her father’s equerry and a guardian to Princess Charlotte of Wales before her marriage; she also supposedly was the mother of Thomas Garth the Younger, the son of General Thomas Garth. (There’s also a theory that she was having an incestous relationship with her brother, the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, but it’s icky and I don’t want to get into so I won’t).\n\n[8] Friedrich Wilhelm IV, the later King of Prussia. Known as “the romanticist”, he was famous for the buildings he built in Potsdam and Berlin. He’s also a nephew of Auntie Fred through her half-brother, Friedrich Wilhelm III.\n\n[9] Henry Edward Fox, the eldest legitimate son of Lord Holland and the future Lord Holland. Only six years younger than Charlotte, ITTL he’s a good friend of hers. He’s also coming back, so pay attention.\n\n[10] Willem I of the Netherlands. He started out as the Prince of Orange and declared the Netherlands a kingdom in 1815 after being urged to do so by the Congress of Vienna. He was distantly related to the British royal family through his grandmother, Anne, The Princess Royal, daughter of George II. His first wife, Wilhelmine of Prussia, was the half-sister of Auntie Fred.\n\n[11] Augustus Fitzgerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster. Previously mentioned. Born in 1819, married Lady Charlotte Augusta Stanhope, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Harrington, in 1818. His oldest son, Charles Fitzgerald, was born in March 1819 - eight months before Prince George of Kendal. Their friendship is entirely my own invention\n\n[12] Born HRH Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia, she was the fourth child of Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Friederike Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt. Unpopular for her retiring and reserved nature, she was interested in painting and was eventually inducted as an honorary member to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. She’s a half sister to Auntie Fred through their father, Friedrich Wilhelm II.\n\n[13] Sister of Mary Fitzclarence d’Este, illegitimate daughter of William, The Duke of Clarence and St. Andrews, and Dorothea Jordan. She’s coming back, just saying.\n\n[14] In the words of Bill Mai'oho, the curator of the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii, \"Liholiho, King Kamehameha II, refused to step in there, because he wasn't blood-connected. These were the kings, and he felt he had no right to walk around their caskets. He didn't even step foot [sic] in there, he didn't want to desecrate their burial places with his presence or his feet stepping in that area.\" (Nu'uanu, O'ahu -- A Native Place: Pohukaina)\n\n[15] The Queen had her tongue tattooed in 1823 as a sign of mourning after the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Keōpūolani.\n\n[16] Better known as Willem III. Yes, that Willem III. Leo’s getting a jump on his “Coburg under every crown” plot.\n\n[17] This is true - they were placed in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields church until August 1824 when their bodies were returned to Hawaii on HMS Blonde. There is no record of them having a service performed in the church, but I figured it would be nice to give them a moment of respect from Charlotte and Leopold.\n\n[18] HH Princess Eleonore Adelheid Marie Antoinette of Saxe-Meiningen, born March 15, 1824. Named for her paternal grandmother, paternal aunt, mother, and maternal grandmother.\n\n[19] Karl, The Prince of Leiningen and his sister Princess Feodore. ITTL since Karl turned 18 in 1822, Feodore has been alternating between living in Leiningen with him and her governess Luise Lezhen, and living in Austria with Ferdinand and Maria Antonia and her mother. For those of you wondering, she prefers Leiningen.\n\n[20] George IV was actually very kind to the exiled Bourbons while he was Prince Regent, and even granted them permanent right of asylum and extremely generous allowances. The original offer of asylum had come from his mother and Charlotte’s namesake, Queen Charlotte, who was very dear friends with Marie Antoinette.\n\n[21] Auntie Fred is not wrong here. The last two French-British marriages had been Henrietta Maria of France and Charles I of England (who was infamously beheaded by his government), and Princess Henrietta of England and Philippe, The Duke of Orléans (Henrietta was supposedly poisoned by Philippe’s lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine, but most likely died of gastroenteritis). Other English-French dumpster fire marriages include Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry I (he literally locked her up for sixteen years) and Isabella of France and Edward II (she may or may not have had him murdered).\n\n[22] The Duchess of Orléans is Maria Carolina’s paternal aunt, born Princess Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily."
