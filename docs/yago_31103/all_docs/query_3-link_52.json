        "text": "In the late 1830s,\n\nan English tourist named Elizabeth Rigby spent the night in a historic castle in present-day Estonia. Lohde Castle had a sinister history involving a mysterious royal death and rumors of a cover-up. Like every good fairy tale, it featured a young and beautiful princess imprisoned by a wicked queen. Unlike a fairy tale, it didn’t have a happy ending. The story gave her the creeps, and she included it in her travel memoir, A Residence on the Shores of the Baltic.\n\nAs soon as I read it,\n\nI couldn’t get the story out of my mind. The fractured fairy tale of a forgotten princess banished and possibly murdered by Catherine the Great wouldn’t let me go. I started Googling, and then I started swearing, because it didn’t seem like anyone in the English-language world knew much about Augusta at all. Every tidbit I discovered led to more questions. Every answer I found cast doubt on what I thought I already knew.\n\nBecause this story has more twists than a spiral staircase.\n\nMore lies than Baron Munchausen’s diary.\n\nMore misery than a Stephen King novel.\n\nIt’s also one of the strangest,\n\nstrongest examples of a woman helping another woman that I’ve seen for this time period. You can’t call this a story of female friendship, as you’ll see. But it is a story about two women working together to right a wrong, defying convention at the cost of their reputations, their relationships, and—in Augusta’s case—her life. If this doesn’t sound very exciting, keep in mind we’re in 18th century Russia, a place and a time when the nobility measured its wealth in the number of souls they owned.\n\nCome for the female empowerment, stay for the intrigue, treachery, and government cover-ups.\n\nFour languages and\n\na few hundred sources later, I’ve pieced together the beginnings of Augusta’s story. Here’s how our tourist, Elizabeth Rigby, described Lohde Castle:\n\n“It is a fine building with massive towers, enclosing a courtyard, with the inscription ‘Albertus de Buxhoveden Episcopus, renovavit 1435,’ and entered by a massive bridge and gateway over a moat. Altogether a most picturesque spot, with fine old trees and majestic expanse of water…”\n\nIt sounds like a harmless place to spend the night, right?\n\nThat’s what Princess Augusta of Brunswick thought.\n\nShe left in a coffin 21 months later.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of Augusta, you’re not alone. History has forgotten her.\n\nBut I haven’t.\n\nAugusta’s husband was loud, arrogant, and self-centered. He also went on to become the smartest king in Europe, according to Napoleon. When Friedrich died, almost no one remembered the first wife he’d loathed. That only made me determined to learn more. Augusta didn’t fit in and I don’t either.\n\nTidbits of Augusta’s story have appeared in other books, but no one has ever put the panorama of her life together: her crap family life, her nutty sister, her asshole husband, and the woman who envisioned herself as Augusta’s savior - Catherine the Great. Augusta’s story has so many modern themes, from slut shaming to domestic abuse. It needs to be told by a woman. Augusta deserves that much.\n\nWe think of history as isolated, something set apart from our daily lives.\n\nIt’s not.\n\nThat’s why this is a different kind of history book, built around the stories of Augusta and Catherine the Great. There are plenty of detours where their stories intersect with a fascinating person or incident.\n\nWhich famous Enlightenment writer likely had an affair with a grand duchess? And pissed off Augusta’s future lady-in-waiting as a result?\n\nWhat happened to the only female claimant to Catherine the Great’s throne? Here’s a hint: Catherine killed all the dudes who made the same claim.\n\nWhich friend of Catherine the Great helped set up her coup...and later befriended Ben Franklin?\n\nWhich Baltimore belle had the world’s most awkward run-in with Augusta’s daughter?\n\nWhat does Grand Duchess Louise of Baden’s meat loaf recipe have to do with any of this? Absolutely nothing, but the fact that it exists and that I have it is too good not to share. You can get it by joining my mailing list.\n\nIf I were writing a traditional history book, all these incidents and references would have been left out, dismissed as tangential or irrelevant.\n\nTo me, they’re what make history come alive.\n\nI can’t tell you how our story ends because there’s still more to discover. There were only two witnesses to that climactic scene in the Hermitage in December of 1786: Augusta and Catherine. Neither one of them talked about it. Like, ever. We may never know what secrets set Augusta’s final tragedy in motion.\n\nBut I can tell you how her story begins.\n\nIt begins when you open the book.\n\nOr, more accurately, when I finish writing it.
