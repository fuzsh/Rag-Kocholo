        "text": "Coat of Arms of HRH Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nHRH Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales was the only child from the marriage of the then Prince of Wales (who became, firstly, Prince Regent and then HM King George IV) and Caroline of Brunswick. Her parents so hated each other that it is highly possible that she was conceived on her parents' wedding night or the night after as they both admitted to never sleeping together again. As such, she was Heiress Apparent in all but name as her parents played cat-and-mouse with their own marriage. (Officially, though, she was Heiress Presumptive, like any female heir even up to the time of the present Queen, as it could always be 'presumed' that a later-born brother would supersede her.)\n\nShe was named after both her Grandmothers - HM Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III and Augusta, The Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg, sister of... King George III, which makes her parents first cousins. Despite her headstrong Hanoverian ways, the British people saw her as a beacon of hope after her male predecessors and her death in childbirth came as a great shock. As the only living legitimate grandchild of King George III, Charlotte Augusta's death left the Hanoverian dynasty with a problem. Her uncles, still of of father-able age, began a race to produce an heir and the winner was the Duke of Kent and his daughter who became HM Queen Victoria.\n\nIn 1816, around about the time of her marriage to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg Saalfeld, Charlotte was assigned a Label of three Points, with a central red Rose. This was halfway between the traditional, three-pointed Label for the first born (son) of a Prince of Wales which, at that time, carried a St George's Cross but which had been assigned to her Uncle Frederick, Duke of York and Albany and who was still alive, and a traditional Label for a Princess Royal of a red Rose between two St George's Crosses which had been assigned to her Aunt Charlotte, Princess Royal and Queen of Württemberg who outlived her namesake.\n\nThe above representation of Charlotte Augusta's Coat of Arms shows everything correctly, such as Coronets - Crosses, Fleurs-de-Lys and Strawberry Leaves. However, contemporary representations of the heraldry of female members of the Hanoverian Dynasty, due to the traditions of male-dominated German heraldry, are few and far between. Queen Victoria, who gained her majority before she came to the Throne, was never recorded as having been assigned a Label, but her reign saw the regularisation of Labels in the second generation especially which we will see did not exist in the Hanoverian Dynasty, even for male members of the Family.\n\nOn 2nd May 1816, Charlotte Augusta, after rejecting her father's suggestion of The Prince of Orange, married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg Saalfeld who would later become King Leopold I of the Belgians. (Because he was the heir to the Dutch Throne, later to become King William II, I have never understood why the Prince Regent favoured him. This would surely have meant a very close alliance between the two countries (the UK and The Netherlands) at best as Charlotte Augusta would, like Queen Victoria, be banned from ascending the Hanoverian Throne due to the Salic Law there or, at worst, the then ultimately one and only legitimate heir being barred from the British Throne. Those two points may be exaggerated, but I cannot see this marriage proposal being anything other than fraught and full of unanswerable questions.) Luckily, Leopold was seen as a hero of the Napoleonic Wars and was able to win his future father-in-law over."
