        "text": "Considering the size, history, influence, and interconnectivity of the British aristocracy, there are surprisingly few members of the UK nobility that, by virtue of being direct descendents of Sophia of Hanover, are in the line of succession to the crown of the United Kingdom. In fact, by my count, there are only fifteen peers or heirs to peerages able to inherit the throne at the moment.\n\nThe first few, of course are in the immediate royal family: the Duke of Sussex (Prince Harry), the Duke of York (Prince Andrew), the Earl of Wessex and Forfar (Prince Edward, whose title of Duke of Edinburgh is, for now, only a lifetime appointment). Then you have the Earl of Snowdon (Princess Margaret’s son David Armstrong-Jones), the Duke of Gloucester (Prince Richard) and the Duke of Kent (Prince Edward) (the eldest sons of George VI’s younger brothers), and David Lascelles, 8th Earl of Harewood (the grandson of George VI’s sister Mary).\n\nNext would be the Duke of Fife, a title which was granted to the husband of Edward VII’s eldest daughter, Princess Louise. After the couple had 2 daughters and a stillborn son, the rules of the dukedom were re-written so their daughters could inherit the title, which then passed to their eldest daughter, Alexandra. Alexandra outlived her children, so the dukedom then passed to James Carnegie, the son of her sister Maud, who had married the Earl of Southesk; David Carnegie, the 4th and current Duke of Fife, is James Carnegie’s son.\n\nNext is Lord Saltoun, a Lord of Parliament in the Scottish peerage created in 1445 and is inheritable by either men or women, as is common with the older Scottish titles. Going back to Queen Victoria’s third son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, his daughter Princess Patricia married a younger son of the Earl of Dalhousie; their son, Capt. Alexander Ramsay, married Flora Fraser, the current Lady Saltoun; their daughter, Katharine Fraser, is the Mistress of Saltoun and heir to the title.\n\nNext would be Arthur Gerald Wellesley, Marquess of Douro, who is the heir of the Duke of Wellington. His mother Antonia, the current Duchess of Wellington, was the daughter of Prince Frederick of Prussia, the fourth son of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, who was the eldest son of Wilhelm II, the last Kaiser of Germany, who was the grandson of Queen Victoria through his mother (also named Victoria).\n\nQueen Victoria’s second daughter, Princess Alice, married the Grand Duke of Hesse, and their daughter Victoria married her father’s first cousin Prince Louis of Battenburg. In World War I, Prince Louis sided with Britain and had to renounce his title as a German prince; the King, as a consolation prize, made Louis Mountbatten (an Anglicization of “Battenburg” that Louis adopted as his new surname) the Marquess of Milford Haven. Louis and Victoria had two sons; the elder, George, inherited the marquessate and is the grandfather of George Mountbatten, the current Marquess of Milford Haven. The younger son, Louis Mountbatten, had a long career in the Navy and served as the last Viceroy of the Indian Empire, and was made Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1947, inheritable by his daughters; his grandson Norton Knatchbull is the current Earl Mountbatten of Burma.\n\nThe last three peers are descended from Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales, who was the son of King George II and the father of King George III. Frederick’s daughter Princess Augusta married the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and their daughter, Princess Augusta, married King Frederick I of Württemberg. Their second son Prince Paul of Württemberg’s second daughter Princess Pauline of Württemberg married the Duke of Nassau and their only son, Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau, married Natalia Pushkina, the daughter of the great Russian poet and playwright Alexander Pushkin. Their eldest child, Countess Sophie von Merenberg, secretly married Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia, grandson of Czar Nicholas I, for which he was banished from Russia. Michael and Sophie moved to London and were good friends with King George V and Queen Mary. Sophie’s uncle, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, made her the Countess de Torby; her eldest daughter, Countess Anastasia “Zia” de Torby, became known as Lady Wernher after marrying Maj.-Gen. Sir Harold Wernher, Bt., the heir of a wealthy diamond financier. Harold and Zia had three children: George, who was killed in action in World War II; Georgina; and Myra. Georgina Wernher married Lt. Col. Harold “Bunny” Phillips and had 5 children. Their eldest daughter, Alexandra Phillips, married the Duke of Abercorn and had 3 children, including James Hamilton, Marquess of Hamilton, heir apparent to the Duke of Abercorn. Their youngest daughter, Natalia Phillips, married the Duke of Westminster and is the mother of Hugh Grosvenor, the 7th and current Duke of Westminster. Myra Wernher married Maj. David Butter and had 5 children. Their second daughter, Marilyn Butter, married James Ramsay, the 17th Earl of Dalhousie and Chief of Clan Ramsay. Their son Simon Ramsay, Lord Ramsay is heir to Earl of Dalhousie, and the final peer eligible to inherit the British crown.\n\nOn November 30, 1917, King George V signed a Royal Warrant defining and limiting the people who could claim to be a Prince or a Princess of the United Kingdom, so as to quarantine the British Royals from the tangled mess of Highnesses, Serene Highnesses and Royal Highnesses that ran through the now-hated German nobility. According to the Warrant, the privilege of being called “your Royal Highness” would be limited to the children of the monarch, the children of the monarch’s sons and the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The children of the sons of the monarch’s sons would thereafter be addressed in the same style as the child of a duke.\n\nWhen George V defined the Royal Family in 1917, the 22 princes and princesses of the United Kingdom compromised:\n\n• George V’s children: Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII, and later Duke of Windsor); Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI); Mary, Princess Royal (by marriage, the Countess of Harewood); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; Prince George, Duke of Kent; and Prince John\n\n• George V’s sisters, Princess Maud (Queen of Norway), Louise, Princess Royal (Duchess of Fife), and Princess Victoria (who never married)\n\n• The surviving children of Queen Victoria, siblings of Edward VII: Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (Governor-General of Canada, 1911-16); Princess Beatrice (Princess Heinrich of Battenburg); Princess Helena (Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein); and Princess Louise Alberta (Duchess of Argyll; her husband was Governor-General of Canada, 1878-83, as the Marquess of Lorne, and the province of Alberta is named for her)\n\n• The children of Victoria’s younger sons, George V’s cousins: Prince Arthur of Connaught; Princess Margaret of Connaught (King Gustaf VI of Sweden’s first wife, grandmother of the current King, Carl XVI); Princess Victoria Patricia of Connaught (’s Canadian Light Infantry); Princess Marie of Edinburgh (Queen of Romania); Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh (Grand Duchess Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia); Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh (Princess Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg); Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh (Princess Alfonso of Spain); Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany; and Princess Alice of Albany (Countess of Athlone; her husband was Governor-General of Canada, 1940-47)\n\nThe number of royals decreased by three in 1919: Prince John, George V’s youngest son, died of a seizure at the age of 14; Princess Patricia of Connaught renounced her titles to marry a commoner, Adm. Sir Alexander Ramsay, a younger son of the Earl of Dalhousie; and Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, was stripped of his titles for siding with the Germans in World War I.\n\nElizabeth II was the first new member of the Royal Family when she was born in 1926.\n\nInterestingly, of the 19 princes and princesses of the UK born since 1917, only two have died: Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, who died of a stroke in 2002, and Prince William of Gloucester, who died in an airplane crash in 1972.\n\nFor you people keeping track, the other 17 are:\n\nPrincess Elizabeth of York (now Elizabeth II)\n\nPrince Richard, Duke of Gloucester\n\nPrince Edward, Duke of Kent\n\nPrince Michael of Kent\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Kent (Lady Alexandra Ogilvy)\n\nCharles, Prince of Wales\n\nAnne, Princess Royal\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward, Earl of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge\n\nPrince George of Cambridge\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Cambridge\n\nPrince Henry (“Harry”) of Wales\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York\n\nPrincess Eugenie of York\n\nPrince James of Wessex (the Viscount Severn)\n\nPrincess Louise of Wessex (Lady Louise Windsor)\n\nThese last two have a bit of controversy surrounding their princedom and princessdom: although they count as a prince and a princess under the Royal Warrant of 1917, a Buckingham Palace press release issued after the Earl of Wessex’s wedding in 1999 declared that their children would be styled like those of an earl. Constitutional scholars debate whether the press release has the same force of law as the Royal Warrant, and if Lord Severn and Lady Louise are, in fact, de jure Prince James and Princess Louise."
