        "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, two of the Queen’s most cherished family members, will celebrate 50 years of marriage in July. Prince Richard and his Danish bride, Birgitte van Deurs, wed in 1972 at St Andrew’s Church, a short walk from Barnwell Manor, their Northamptonshire family seat.\n\nThe bride arrived a few minutes late – but that is where tradition ended. The rest of the wedding was unconventional and certainly did not display royal grandeur. Van Deurs held the train of her Norman Hartnell gown herself, having opted neither for bridesmaids nor flower girls. She wore no tiara, but instead wove stephanotis flowers through her blonde hair. The then Duke, the groom’s 72-year-old father, missed the ceremony on account of his failing health, but the small wedding party returned to the manor to celebrate with him afterwards.\n\nThe prince was never expected to adopt an important role in the Royal Family. Instead, he and van Deurs enjoyed life on the fringes of the Firm: he as an architect, she working at the Danish embassy. But within two years of their marriage, both the Duke and his heir, Prince William, had tragically died. In 1974, Prince Richard inherited his father’s title and became the Duke of Gloucester, and his wife of just two years, the new duchess. Royal history is not always defined by pomp and splendour. Whether or not the marriages lasted, humbler nuptials play their part too.\n\nHere Tatler charts the weddings that, for a variety of reasons, broke with royal convention.\n\nThe Wedding Guide is on sale with the May issue of Tatler now"
