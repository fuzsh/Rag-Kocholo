        "text": "Considering the size, history, influence, and interconnectivity of the British aristocracy, there are surprisingly few members of the UK nobility that, by virtue of being direct descendents of Sophia of Hanover, are in the line of succession to the crown of the United Kingdom. In fact, by my count, there are only fifteen peers or heirs to peerages able to inherit the throne at the moment.\n\nThe first few, of course are in the immediate royal family: the Duke of Sussex (Prince Harry), the Duke of York (Prince Andrew), the Earl of Wessex and Forfar (Prince Edward, whose title of Duke of Edinburgh is, for now, only a lifetime appointment). Then you have the Earl of Snowdon (Princess Margaret’s son David Armstrong-Jones), the Duke of Gloucester (Prince Richard) and the Duke of Kent (Prince Edward) (the eldest sons of George VI’s younger brothers), and David Lascelles, 8th Earl of Harewood (the grandson of George VI’s sister Mary).\n\nNext would be the Duke of Fife, a title which was granted to the husband of Edward VII’s eldest daughter, Princess Louise. After the couple had 2 daughters and a stillborn son, the rules of the dukedom were re-written so their daughters could inherit the title, which then passed to their eldest daughter, Alexandra. Alexandra outlived her children, so the dukedom then passed to James Carnegie, the son of her sister Maud, who had married the Earl of Southesk; David Carnegie, the 4th and current Duke of Fife, is James Carnegie’s son.\n\nNext is Lord Saltoun, a Lord of Parliament in the Scottish peerage created in 1445 and is inheritable by either men or women, as is common with the older Scottish titles. Going back to Queen Victoria’s third son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, his daughter Princess Patricia married a younger son of the Earl of Dalhousie; their son, Capt. Alexander Ramsay, married Flora Fraser, the current Lady Saltoun; their daughter, Katharine Fraser, is the Mistress of Saltoun and heir to the title.\n\nNext would be Arthur Gerald Wellesley, Marquess of Douro, who is the heir of the Duke of Wellington. His mother Antonia, the current Duchess of Wellington, was the daughter of Prince Frederick of Prussia, the fourth son of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, who was the eldest son of Wilhelm II, the last Kaiser of Germany, who was the grandson of Queen Victoria through his mother (also named Victoria).\n\nQueen Victoria’s second daughter, Princess Alice, married the Grand Duke of Hesse, and their daughter Victoria married her father’s first cousin Prince Louis of Battenburg. In World War I, Prince Louis sided with Britain and had to renounce his title as a German prince; the King, as a consolation prize, made Louis Mountbatten (an Anglicization of “Battenburg” that Louis adopted as his new surname) the Marquess of Milford Haven. Louis and Victoria had two sons; the elder, George, inherited the marquessate and is the grandfather of George Mountbatten, the current Marquess of Milford Haven. The younger son, Louis Mountbatten, had a long career in the Navy and served as the last Viceroy of the Indian Empire, and was made Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1947, inheritable by his daughters; his grandson Norton Knatchbull is the current Earl Mountbatten of Burma.\n\nThe last three peers are descended from Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales, who was the son of King George II and the father of King George III. Frederick’s daughter Princess Augusta married the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and their daughter, Princess Augusta, married King Frederick I of Württemberg. Their second son Prince Paul of Württemberg’s second daughter Princess Pauline of Württemberg married the Duke of Nassau and their only son, Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau, married Natalia Pushkina, the daughter of the great Russian poet and playwright Alexander Pushkin. Their eldest child, Countess Sophie von Merenberg, secretly married Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia, grandson of Czar Nicholas I, for which he was banished from Russia. Michael and Sophie moved to London and were good friends with King George V and Queen Mary. Sophie’s uncle, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, made her the Countess de Torby; her eldest daughter, Countess Anastasia “Zia” de Torby, became known as Lady Wernher after marrying Maj.-Gen. Sir Harold Wernher, Bt., the heir of a wealthy diamond financier. Harold and Zia had three children: George, who was killed in action in World War II; Georgina; and Myra. Georgina Wernher married Lt. Col. Harold “Bunny” Phillips and had 5 children. Their eldest daughter, Alexandra Phillips, married the Duke of Abercorn and had 3 children, including James Hamilton, Marquess of Hamilton, heir apparent to the Duke of Abercorn. Their youngest daughter, Natalia Phillips, married the Duke of Westminster and is the mother of Hugh Grosvenor, the 7th and current Duke of Westminster. Myra Wernher married Maj. David Butter and had 5 children. Their second daughter, Marilyn Butter, married James Ramsay, the 17th Earl of Dalhousie and Chief of Clan Ramsay. Their son Simon Ramsay, Lord Ramsay is heir to Earl of Dalhousie, and the final peer eligible to inherit the British crown.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII, Dei Gratia Magnae Britanniae, Hiberniae et terrarum transmarinarum quae in ditione sunt Britannica Rex, Fidei Defensor, Indiae Imperator, reigned for only 10 months and 20 days, from 20 January to 10 December of 1936. In his reign he created only nine peerages: six barons, two viscounts and a marquess.\n\nThe first two peerages were issued twelve days into his reign, on 1 February. One went to Sir Arthur Benn, Bt., who was a Tory MP on and off from 1910 to 1935 and a member of the London County Council from 1907 to 1911, was made Baron Glenravel, but the title went extinct when Lord Glenravel died without sons the following June. The other was given to Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Hugh Trenchard, Bt., 1st Baron Trenchard, the first commander of the Royal Air Force and Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police from 1931 to 1935, who was made Viscount Trenchard. His grandson, the 3rd Viscount Trenchard, is currently one of the 90 hereditary peers elected to sit in the House of Lords.\n\nTwo days later Sir Gomer Berry, Bt., publisher of the Sunday Times, was made Baron Kemsley. He was later made Viscount Kemsley in 1945. The title is now held by his grandson, the 3rd Viscount.\n\nOn the 24th of February Thomas Catto, chairman of the Indian industrial conglomerate Andrew Yule & Co., Calcutta, was made Baron Catto. Lord Catto was later Governor of the Bank of England from 1944 to 1949; his grandson is now the 3rd Baron Catto.\n\nOn the 26th of May the King awarded the title of Marquess of Willingdon to Major Sir Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Earl of Willingdon, Viscount Willingdon and Baron Willingdon, Governor-General of Canada (1926-31) and Viceroy of India (1931-36). All his titles went extinct upon the death of his son Inigo in 1979. This was the last time (so far) that a marquessate was given out in Britain.\n\nBetween July 14 and 17 Edward VIII approved baronies to 4 people on consecutive days. On the 14th, Sir Henry Cautley, Bt., a Conservative MP for 22 years and a judge in Sunderland, Durham, was made Baron Cautley; on the 15th, Sir Malcolm Hailey, a governor of the Indian Empire, was made Baron Hailey; on the 16th, Sir Herbert Austin, founder of Austin Motors, became Baron Austin; and on the 17th, Beaumont Pease, a prominent banker, was made Baron Wardington. Of these four, the first three went extinct with their recipients’ deaths, in 1946, 1969 and 1941; the fourth is held by the 3rd Baron Wardington, younger son of the 1st Baron, and has no heirs.\n\nThe last peerage Edward VIII ever approved was on 30 October 1936, 41 days before his abdication. It went to Sir Bertrand Dawson, 1st Baron Dawson of Penn, who was made Viscount Dawson of Penn. Lord Dawson was President of the Royal College of Physicians from 1931 to 1937 and was personal physician to King George V, King Edward VIII and King George VI. His diaries later revealed that he had euthanized a dying George V with an overdose of cocaine and morphine. Lord Dawson died childless in 1945 and his titles died with him."
