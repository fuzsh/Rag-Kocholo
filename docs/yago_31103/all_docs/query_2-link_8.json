The marriage was unhappy from the beginning, and Friedrich mostly ignored his wife who was far more intelligent than he was. Despite this, the couple had 12 children:\n\nPrince Joseph (born and died 1786) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Katharina Charlotte (1787 – 1847) – married Prince Paul of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Caroline (born and died 1788) – died at birth\n\nJoseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1789-1868) – married Duchess Amalie of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Friederike (born and died 1791) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Therese (1792-1854) – married King Ludwig I of Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1794-1825) – married Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, had issue\n\nPrince Franz Friedrich (1795-1800) – died in childhood\n\nGeorg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1796-1853) – married Duchess Marie Luise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had issue\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm (1801-1870) – unmarried\n\nPrince Maximilian Karl (born and died 1803) – died in infancy\n\nPrince Eduard Karl (1804-1852) – married (1) Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had issue; (2) Princess Luise Caroline Reuss of Greiz, had issue\n\nDespite her husband’s disinterest, Charlotte became much loved by the people of Saxe-Hildburghausen. She gave very generously to causes and charities that helped the poor and funded numerous programs that provided education and training to the less fortunate. Charlotte also supported the arts and brought many musicians and artists to court. She also became known as one of the best singers of her time. Having taken lessons as a girl in Hanover, the Duchess often sang in both court and church events.\n\nEight years before her husband became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, Charlotte died after a long illness in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany on May 14, 1818. Per her wishes, she was to be buried in the new city cemetery (Stadtfriedhof) in Hildburghausen. She was initially buried in the Hildburghausen Castle Church in the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany. Her remains were moved to the Hildburghausen Stadtfriedhof in 1819, the first burial in the new cemetery. Her tomb, a large bronzed pillar atop what is known as the Ducal Mound, was completed in 1824. The mound is now also the burial site of several of the previous Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen and their wives. Other members of the Saxe-Altenburg family are buried elsewhere in the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
