        "text": "Sophia Charlotte (1744-1818) was born on 19 May 1744 in the Duchy of Mecklenbeurg-Strelitz, Germany, the second daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Elizabeth Albertina of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Charlotte married George III (1738-1820) in 1761 and became Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Queen Consort of Hanover. The marriage was successful as they shared many interests and she quickly learned English. They had fifteen children and took a great interest in their upbringing, especially the princesses. Charlotte died in 1818.\n\nThe sub-subseries consists of letters and notes written by Queen Charlotte to Hamilton and includes a draft copy letter from Hamilton to the Queen resigning from her position at Court. The Queen writes to Hamilton with Court gossip and news of friends, discussing her reading and her wish that she was able to write in the natural style of some of Hamilton's friends. In HAM/1/1/2/1 Queen Charlotte asks Hamilton to consider her a 'sincere friend', and in HAM/1/1/2/2 she admonishes Hamilton, who is visiting Eastbourne, for not taking her advice about sea-bathing. The Queen writes that she and the King are to return to the country soon and that they find their time there more 'agreeable' and remain in town only to fulfil their duties which, Charlotte admits, is 'attended with a secret inward satisfaction' (HAM/1/1/2/2). In HAM/1/1/2/8 Hamilton writes to Queen Charlotte to offer her resignation on the grounds that her poor health makes her inadequate for the role and that she is 'persuaded' that the King and Queen will not disapprove of her resignation. The Queen replies to Hamilton's letter immediately, refusing to accept her resignation and putting it down to 'low spirits'(HAM/1/1/2/9). Also included in the sub-series is a cut-out silhouette, possibly of the King (HAM/1/1/2/7); according to an inscription on the back, it was cut by the Queen."
