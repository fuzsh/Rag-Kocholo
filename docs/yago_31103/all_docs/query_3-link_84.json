        "text": "(1777-1825), Russian Tsar 1801-1825\n\nAlexander I was born in St. Petersburg on 23 December, 1777 and died at Taganrog on 1 December, 1825. He was the son of Paul I and Sophie of Württemberg (Maria Feodorovna), and the grandson of Catherine II. He was handsome – he had the classic profile of his grandmother – and intelligent. From his childhood he was torn between two people who hated each other: his father whom he feared and his grandmother whom he admired, he also remained hidden and was secretive. “It was usual for him to have two ways of thinking about all things,” writes Schilder, and Chateaubriand further explained: “Alexander was sincere when it came to his own humanity, but he was a dissimulator […] in all things related to politics.” As for his upbringing, he inherited deep complications from his father's side, and his education was to be a challenge, to put it mildly, in that whilst he was destined to become an autocratic sovereign in the orthodox religion, in 1784 Catherine II gave him a protestant, free-thinking and profoundly republican tutor, in the form of Frederick-Caesar de La Harpe. Throughout his life, Alexander therefore declared himself to be a “good Republican” and a great liberal!"
