During a visit to London in 1814, Paul, along with many other princes, was taken to visit the Ascot races by the Prince Regent. He behaved badly, getting the Prince of Orange blind drunk. \"For thirteen years he has done nothing but offend his father with the improprieties of his conduct\", his stepmother wrote.\n\nOn 28 September 1805 in Ludwigsburg, Paul married Princess Katharina Charlotte of Saxe-Hildburghausen (17 June 1787 Hildburghausen – 12 December 1847 Bamberg), second daughter of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen. They had five children:\n\n* Friederike Charlotte Marie (9 January 1807 – 2 February 1873); married Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia\n\n* Frederick Karl August (21 February 1808 – 9 May 1870); married his cousin Princess Katherine of Württemberg and was the father of William II of Württemberg.\n\n* Paul Friedrich (7 March 1809 – 28 May 1810)\n\n* Pauline Friederike Marie (25 February 1810 – 7 July 1856); married William, Duke of Nassau; mother of Sophia of Nassau, wife of Oscar II of Sweden. Through Pauline, Paul is an ancestor of the present Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Luxembourg, Norwegian and Swedish Royal families.\n\n* August (24 January 1813 – 12 January 1885); married (morganatically) Marie Bethge, with issue.\n\nIn 1815 Paul moved from his home in Stuttgart to Paris, leaving his wife and two sons, but taking his daughters with him. There he led a relatively modest life, but was frequently in the company of intellectuals such as Georges Cuvier. Paul's family did not approve of this, and ordered him to return to Württemberg, but he refused. [cite book|last=Zeepvat |first=Charlotte |title=Romanov Autumn |publisher=Sutton |location=Stroud |year=2006|pages=pp.21-22|isbn=0750944188] While in Paris, he fathered two illegitimate daughters by mistresses; one of these natural daughters, Karolina von Rothenburg, was an ancestor of Boris Johnson, the current Mayor of London.
