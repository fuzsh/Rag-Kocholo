        "text": "Princess Irene was born in Cape Town, South Africa on 11 May 1942. Her parents, the then Crown Prince Paul of Greece and Princess Frederica, were living in exile after the Italian invasion and Nazi occupation of Greece during the Second World War. She was the youngest of three children, with her sister, Sofía, born in 1938 and her brother, Constantine, born in 1940. Having spent their early years in South Africa, the family returned to Greece in 1946, when Princess Irene was four years old. In 1947, her father became King Paul of Greece and her brother, Constantine, became Crown Prince of Greece at the age of six.\n\nGrowing up, Princess Irene was a brilliant musician. She was taught to play the piano by the concert pianist Gina Bachauer and, for a while, she was a professional concert pianist. In 1969, she made her British debut at the Royal Festival Hall, performing Bach’s Concerto No. 2. She received a three-minute ovation. Her brother was in the audience, as was the Prince of Wales (now King Charles III) and Princess Anne. Newspapers at the time said, ‘Princess or not, she’s more than adequate player.’\n\nIn 1964, Princess Irene’s father, King Paul, died aged 62 following a battle with stomach cancer. Her brother, Constantine, ascended the throne aged 23 and was given the title Constantine II. However, public support for King Constantine faded after he tried to influence Greek politics, machinations that led to the collapse of the newly elected centrist government of Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou. He was deposed in 1967 following a military coup and an unsuccessful counter-coup in Greece. Following this, he fled to Rome, where he spent the first five years of his exile. The Greek monarchy was abolished in 1973, and Princess Irene moved to India with her mother.\n\nRead More\n\nRevealed: Princess Tatiana of Greece is to keep her title after her divorce from Prince Nikolaos\n\nTatiana, who is originally from Venezuela, has split from the ‘Playboy Prince’ Nikolaos\n\nBoth Frederica and Princess Irene were interested in Hindu philosophy, and reports claim that Princess Irene has converted to Hinduism, though it is unknown exactly when this took place. She is reportedly an ‘ardent devotee of Shankaracharya’, an 8th-century Indian Vedic scholar and teacher and has praised sacred Hindu scriptures, known as the Vedas. She is reported as saying: ‘The Vedas and Indian philosophy alone could show a path of peace to the world… The Vedic life was above caste, region, religion and country. World peace can be achieved by following Vedic life’.\n\nRead More\n\n‘Friends warned Ivy about Tobias’: inside Ivy Getty’s doomed marriage as the heiress heads for divorce\n\nThe great-granddaughter of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty has split from her husband Tobias ‘Toby’ Engel\n\nPrincess Irene’s mother, Frederica, died in 1981, and following this, Princess Irene moved to Madrid to live with her sister, then Queen Sofía of Spain, in an apartment at the La Zarzuela Palace in Madrid, the royal residence of the King and Queen of Spain. She still lives there to this day, and is the aunt of the reigning King Felipe VI of Spain. Irene’s niece, Infanta Cristina of Spain (Felipe’s sister) named her daughter Irene after her.\n\nPrincess Irene never married, though she is believed to have had a long relationship with a married Greek man. It is widely believed that the late King Olav V of Norway had hoped that his son, now King Harald V, would marry Princess Irene and make her Queen of Norway – but Harald married Sonja Haraldsen in 1986. It is rumoured that Princess Irene learnt to speak fluent Norwegian in preparation for her role, though there has been no official confirmation of this.\n\nRead More\n\nInside King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands’ romantic royal wedding album\n\nTatler revisits the Dutch King's royal wedding to his Argentine bride, the future Queen Máxima, in 2002\n\nNowadays, Princess Irene still lives with her sister, Sofía of Spain. She is occasionally seen at royal events, including the wedding of Crown Prince Leka and Elia Zaharia in 2016 and at the funeral of her brother, King Constantine II in January of this year."
