Appears to be \"monkey-faced\" in many of her portraits.\n\nInterests and patronage\n\nStyles of\n\nQueen CharlotteReference styleHer MajestySpoken styleYour MajestyAlternative styleMa'am\n\nQueen Charlotte was keenly interested in the fine arts and supported Johann Christian Bach, who was her music teacher. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, then aged eight, dedicated his Opus 3 to her, at her request. The queen also founded orphanages and a hospital for expectant mothers.\n\nIn 2004, the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace staged an exhibition illustrating George and Charlotte's enthusiastic arts patronage, which was particularly enlightened in contrast to that of earlier Hanoverian monarchs; it compared favorably to the adventuresome tastes of the king's father, Frederick, Prince of Wales. Among the royal couple's favored craftsmen and artists were the cabinetmaker William Vile, silversmith Thomas Heming, the landscape designer Capability Brown, and the German painter Johann Zoffany, who frequently painted the king and queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children as she sat at her dressing table.\n\nThe queen also was a well-educated amateur botanist and helped establish what is today Kew Gardens.\n\nThe education of women was a great importance to the queen, and she saw to it that her daughters were better educated than was usual for young women of the day.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n\"History is a lie agreed upon\" Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nEnglish's first African-British Queen: Phillipa...\n\nMy favorite English Queen Sophia Charlotte is not really first African-British Queen and there was a lot of Kings and Queens of Africa descendants before Charlotte!!! Note: Like Queen Charlotte, Queen Phillipa was not consider attracting to most 14th Europeans, too! Roosevelt D. Odom, Jr.\n\nhttp://www.100greatblackbritons.com/bios/queen_phillipa.html\n\nQueen Phillipa\n\nEngland's first black queen, mother of the black prince\n\nPhilippa was the daughter of William of Hainault, a lord in part of what is now Belgium. When she was nine the King of England, Edward II, decided that he would marry his son, the future Edward III, to her, and sent one of his bishops, a Bishop Stapeldon, to look at her. He described her thus:\n\n\"The lady whom we saw has not uncomely hair, betwixt blue-black and brown. Her head is cleaned shaped; her forehead high and broad, and standing somewhat forward. Her face narrows between the eyes, and the lower part of her face is still more narrow and slender than the forehead. Her eyes are blackish brown and deep. Her nose is fairly smooth and even, save that is somewhat broad at the tip and flattened, yet it is no snub nose. Her nostrils are also broad, her mouth fairly wide. Her lips somewhat full and especially the lower lip…all her limbs are well set and unmaimed, and nought is amiss so far as a man may see. Moreover, she is brown of skin all over, and much like her father, and in all things she is pleasant enough, as it seems to us.\"\n\nFour years later Prince Edward went to visit his bride-to-be and her family, and fell in live with her. She was betrothed to him and in 1327, when she was only 14, she arrived in England. The next year, when she was 15, they married and were crowned King and Queen in 1330 when she was heavily pregnant with her first child and only 17.\n\nThis first child was called Edward, like his father, but is better known as the Black Prince. Many say that he was called this because of the colour of his armour, but there are records that show that he was called 'black' when he was very small. The French called him 'Le Noir'.\n\nPhilippa was a remarkable woman. She was very wise and was known and loved by the English for her kindliness and restraint. She would travel with her husband on his campaigns and take her children as well. When the King was abroad she ruled in his absence. Queen's College in Oxford University was founded under her direction by her chaplain, Robert de Eglesfield in 1341 when she was 28. She brought many artists and scholars from Hainault who contributed to English culture.\n\nWhen she died, Edward never really recovered, and she was much mourned by him and the country. King Edward had a beautiful sculpture made for her tomb which you can see today at Westminster Abbey.\n\nSourced from the Black Cultural Archives\n\nThe Black Queen\n\nThe are three pieces of evidence that lead me to believe Queen Charlotte Sophia, consort to George III was of African heritage.\n\nFirst, the Ramsey portrait made of her just before George III's cornation:\n\nThe Black Queen\n\nYou'll note the inset head image is definitely that of a woman of African heritage. I believe the inset image is the original. I have seen at least four other versions of the same head each rendered with distinct European features. In fact, so distinctly different are each of versions I've seen it is clear to me a concerted effort was made to render a version of the sitter's face completely different from what I believe was the Ramsey original.\n\nNote also in the second version the hair from the first was clearly copied, or I should say, the face from the first erased and a more European one painted in its place.\n\nAlso, I've included a cartoon made of George III and Queen Charlotte where although both face's are exaggerated hers is clearly rendered in a distinctly ethnic way, a way to my eye, seems to be based on the way person I marked \"original\" looks.\n\nThere are other things...\n\nIn his dairy, Baron von Stockmar surgeon to the Queen writes about her, \"She had the face of a true mulatto.\"\n\nCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nOn the link above please ignore Mario de Valdes y Cocom's nonsense about Queen Charlotte being nine times removed from a distant ancestor of African heritage, even if that were true, that wouldn't explain her \"true mulatto face.\"\n\nMany other comments are recorded about Queen Charlotte's looks and most have this in common: they speak of a woman who looked not like folks entirely expected, that she had a \"frog-like\" appearance, was \"not pretty\" etc.\n\nFinally, for the purposes of the novel I'm writing about her, I'm presuming her \"father\" was a full-blooded African named Abram Gannibal.\n\nGannibal was a noted Russian General who visited England several times during the 18th century.\n\nricland\n\nThere are two ladies today in the British aristocracy who claim such ancestry: the Duchess of Abercorn and her sister, the Duchess of Westminster. Not only are they descendants of Sophie, the Electress of Hannibal but they are also descendants of the Russian poet Pushkin and his African great-grandfather, Abram Petrovich Gannibal, the associate of Peter the Great.\n\nI was just looking at wikipedia about this queen, and it would seem that any \"African\" blood would have been at least 9 generations in the past. By my estimate that's about 2 centuries, maybe more -- so the total effect upon the queen's appearance must have been negligible. (As a comparison, I am only 5 generations away from my Native American roots and you wouldn't know that unless I told you.)\n\nLet's face it, some royals (even today) are less than photogenic, and it would seem to me that describing the queen as African was probably more of a scurrilous political attack on her than an accurate description of her appearance.\n\nto king george 3 and sophie charlotte from Mecklenburg/Strelitz!\n\nPrincess Charlotte was collected at Cuxhaven by a squadron of British yachts and warships under Admiral Anson (including the specially renamed HMY Royal Charlotte), but on its return the squadron was three times blown over to the Norwegian coast by westerly gales and took ten days to reach Harwich, which it did in early September 1761. Charlotte then travelled to London, where the couple were married at the Chapel Royal in St. James's Palace, London, on 8 September of that year. Her mother-in-law did not welcome her with open arms, and for some time there was a slight tension between the two. However, the king's mother had yet to accept any woman with whom he was alleged to have been involved, therefore it seems that the young king cared little for her approval by this time.\n\nDespite not having been her husband's first choice as a bride, and having been treated with a general lack of sympathy by her mother-in-law, the Dowager Princess of Wales, Charlotte's marriage was a happy one, and the king was apparently never unfaithful to her. In the course of their marriage, they had 15 children, all but two of whom (Octavius and Alfred) survived into adulthood. As time went on, she wielded considerable power within the realm, although she evidently never misused it.\n\n1 from her Kids was George 4 on the picture and still 14 other kids toward wikipedia!\n\nAttachments\n\n140px-George_IV_bust1.jpg\n\n180px-George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.jpg"
