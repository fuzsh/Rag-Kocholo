        "text": "Director: Simon Wincer\n\nCast involved: Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Danny Glover\n\nOh bury me not on the lone prairie\n\nBut, you cry, ‘Lonesome Dove’ is a TV mini-series, not a movie at all! Well, let’s look at the credentials. Adapted from a book widely considered the best ever written in the western genre, a book written by Larry McMurtry, author of ‘The Last Picture Show’ and ‘Terms of Endearment’, and starring not just Duvall in his prime, not just Jones and Glover on the verge of theirs, but a whole host of great movie character actors including Diane Lane, Frederic Forrest, Angelica Huston, Chris Cooper and William Sanderson, this is as cinematic as TV gets.\n\nSure, it was directed by a guy poised halfway between ‘DARYL’ and ‘Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man’, but we’ll let that slide: in its epic emotional sweep, in its breadth of landscape and action in its depth of character and awareness of history, ‘Lonesome Dove’ is every bit as artistically valid as half the movies on this list – and it’s a damn sight more entertaining than most of ’em. TH\n\nDirector: Kevin Costner\n\nCast involved: Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall, Annette Bening\n\nThe simple life\n\nIt’s the bullets you remember. Kevin Costner’s terse, unshowy follow up to (and apology for?) ‘Dances with Wolves’ has lovely, soft-spoken dialogue and near-perfect characterisation, gorgeous period recreation and a darkly compelling sense of mounting intensity.\n\nBut what really sticks in the mind are the sound effects he used for the final showdown: eschewing the usual polite Hollywood popguns, these weapons feel close, real, rusty and unpredictable.\n\nIt’s just one of the many fine, honest, unostentatious touches which pepper this unsung modern western, a film which, for all its apparent lack of ambition and easygoing charm, leaves an unexpectedly deep impression. TH\n\nRead more about 'Open Range'\n\nDirector: Jane Campion\n\nCast involved: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee.\n\nFor the love of Bronco Henry\n\nShould this slow-moseying psychological drama technically count as a ‘western’? Sure, it’s got the iconography: the wide-brimmed hats, the dusty landscapes, the one-horse town with more cattle than people living in it. But anyone expecting streetside shootouts or bodies getting tossed off saloon balconies – or simply a glimpse of a cute canine – is bound to be disappointed. Most of the violence here is emotional, and while some of it is administered verbally, the majority unfurls internally, wounding the soul before overcoming the body.\n\nAs a meditation on the corrosive nature of toxic masculinity, though, The Power of the Dog – Campion’s return to film after a ten-year hiatus – deserves a spot within cinema’s most masculine genre, as that’s precisely where it derives its own quiet power. It’s what makes pale, waifish Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kirsten Dunst, as his concerned, tortured mother, seem trapped in a world in which they don’t belong, which is the point. Benedict Cumberbatch, playing far against type, at first appears to be doing a parody of a rough-hewn, brutish man of the land – and that, it eventually turns out, is also entirely the point.\n\nOther films on this list have flipped gender roles and subverted other conventions of the genre. None, however, seize upon those tropes quite the way Campion does, and use them to tell such a raw, devastating story. MS\n\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom\n\nCast involved: Peter Mullan, Milla Jovovich, Wes Bentley\n\nThe life and death of a man of character\n\nLess a spaghetti western than a ploughman’s western (honk!), Michael Winterbottom’s wintry morality play relocates Thomas Hardy’s ‘The Mayor of Casterbridge’ from Wessex to the West Coast to startling effect. Wes Bentley – wooden but, for once, quite winning – plays a railroad surveyor newly arrived in Irish immigrant Peter Mullan’s northern Californian fiefdom of Kingdom Come (you can hear the fates conspiring already!) to assess whether the Central Pacific is fit to pass through.\n\nThe enormous boon this might generate for Mullan and the town inspires dirty politicking, gut-wrenching revelations, a swooning love story, thunderous shootouts and an impossibly moving climax. Modern sensibilities hold sway throughout, and it’s an undeniably European take, but this is still a fine western in the most classic sense. ALD\n\nRead more about 'The Claim'\n\nDirector: Frank Perry\n\nCast involved: Jeff Bridges, Sam Waterston, Slim Pickens\n\n’Til the end of the day\n\n‘Oh, give me a home with a low-interest loan, a cowgirl and two pick-up trucks. A colour TV, all the beer should be free. And that, man, is Rancho Deluxe!’ The ’70s produced a gold rush of moseyin’, mournful modern-day westerns such as Paul Newman and Lee Marvin’s broke-ass last cattle drive ‘Pocket Money’ and easy-going Steve McQueen rodeo lament ‘Junior Bonner’ – films in which the cowboy way continued to exist only as a dodge for forgotten men or as a fading carnival sideshow.\n\nThe feel was invariably elegiac, yet the film that edges them both off our list, the marvellous ‘Rancho Deluxe’, achieves a tone close to mockery. Scripted by Thomas McGuane – writer of ‘The Missouri Breaks’ and ‘Tom Horn’ – and starring Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston as a couple of smaller-than-small-time Montana rustlers, it’s a sweet, strange, sad little film that presents the west as a nine-to-five refuge for throwbacks, affected playboys and the outright deluded, all stung by the realisation that the chairs are on the tables.\n\nThe last waltz has played itself out and nobody even bothered to dance. ALD\n\nRead more about 'Rancho Deluxe'\n\nDirector: Kelly Reichardt\n\nCast involved: Michelle Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Shirley Henderson\n\nThey just keep wagon training…\n\nThe western ain’t traditionally woman’s work: if the number of oaters featuring women in a starring role can be counted in, at very most, double digits, the number with a female at the helm must be down to the fingers of one hand: in fact (and please correct us if we’re wrong), the only one we can name for sure is Maggie Greenwald’s ‘The Ballad of Little Jo’.\n\nSo for Kelly Reichardt to come out swinging with such a confident, uncompromising frontier story – albeit one which upends just about every tradition the genre holds dear – only proves her incredible strength as a filmmaker. True, the film’s implacable pace, ambiguous characterisation and wide-open ending will likely infuriate and horrify western purists – but that is no bad thing. TH\n\nRead more about 'Meek’s Cutoff'\n\nDirector: André de Toth\n\nCast involved: Robert Ryan, Burl Ives, Tina Louise\n\nFrom bad to terse\n\nThe dictionary defines ‘stark’ as ‘forbidding in its bareness and lack of any ornament, relieving feature or pleasant prospect.’ It’s a description that gets as close as possible to describing accurately André de Toth’s offbeat western set in the Oregon hills.\n\nWhether in regards to the crisp, harsh photography, the series of tense stand-offs that frame the narrative or the punishing final ride into the snowy wastes. Robert Ryan excels as the murderous cattleman come to town to hunt down the pesky varmint who has been fencing off the icy pastures on which his cattle used to chomp.\n\nInstead he finds himself desperately defending the town – with his wits as often as his Winchester – against magnificent bastard Burl Ives and his especially vicious gang of on-the-run desperadoes. Fierce, intelligent, exciting and just about as stark as they come. ALD\n\nRead more about 'Open Range'\n\nDirector: Arthur Penn\n\nCast involved: Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Harry Dean Stanton\n\nThe Penn is mightier\n\nIt’s in the deep cuts of the Missouri River as it snakes through Montana that we find the soggy-bottomed romance and pantomime sadism of Arthur Penn’s schizophrenic range western.\n\nRustling is the name of the game but the plot rides pillion to a series of darkly comic existential vignettes in which death and desperation play out an escalating series of uneasy two-handers.\n\nAs such, it’s a complex/clever-clever western that doesn’t work for everyone. Does Jack Nicholson’s inalienable urbanity distract from his performance as a raggedy-ass dirt farmer?\n\nDo the ludicrous acting choices afforded Marlon Brando by his star-power detract from the lethality of his character? Does Arthur Penn’s hands-off direction allow the plot eventually to settle into a roundelay of psychic showdowns and pornographic violence? The answers to all are ‘yes’.\n\nBut then, the frontier was replete with displaced Easterners, insane poet-warriors and purposeless brutality, so maybe it’s time a film that’s too often dismissed as a top-heavy, blow-dried vanity project is given its dues. ALD\n\nRead more about 'The Missouri Breaks'\n\nDirector: Robert Aldrich\n\nCast involved: Burt Lancaster, Bruce Davison, Joaquín Martínez\n\nBlood on the tracks\n\nIf Sam Peckinpah forced open the floodgates of balletic, consequence-free screen violence with ‘The Wild Bunch’, then it was Robert Aldrich’s gory cavalry western which presented the grim realities of range warfare. Not 20 minutes in, and we’re shown three Apaches playing a game of catch with a dead soldier’s innards. Not much later, an old yokel is punished for defending his patch o’ land by being scalped.\n\nAnd having his face pulverised. Burt Lancaster keeps the toothy grins in lockdown as MacIntosh, a grizzled tracker with an Apache sidekick who is drafted in to the US cavalry to help put an end to a string of savage attacks undertaken by irate Apache chief, Ulzana.\n\nIts central conceit – that it’s only natural to be driven to extreme violence when witnessing the suffering of friends and countrymen – may feel a little reactionary to contemporary eyes, but it remains a hard-hitting and rugged adventure movie that makes up in charisma and suspense what it lacks in political correctness. DJ\n\nRead more about 'Ulzana’s Raid'\n\nDirector: Mel Brooks\n\nCast involved: Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, Madeline Kahn\n\nMad Mel’s Pryor convictions\n\nBy 1974, the traditional western was sailing so close to self-parody that it would’ve been easy for Mel Brooks to take an old plot, stuff in a few bad puns and call it a day. That he instead turned to Richard Pryor, then on the very edge of superstardom, to help him craft a film which would be not just funny but edgily relevant says a lot about Brooks’s willingness to take risks – once upon a time.\n\nThe result may be imperfect. Pryor really should have been allowed to play the lead, and the entire subplot with Madeline Kahn as lisping Teutonic chanteuse Lili von Schtupp is bizarre and inexplicable. But ‘Blazing Saddles’ contains enough glorious one-liners (‘Mongo only pawn in game of life…’), iconic scenes (the campfire, the rogues’ lineup, the set-shattering finale) and sheer genre-busting bravado to carry it through the cactus patches.
