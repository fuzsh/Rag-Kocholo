        "text": "The avant-garde poetry of what may be Ford's greatest film - almost impervious to analysis, a film stripped down entirely to 'grace notes.' Quite the achievement for a film that depicts all life as a struggle! But in that struggle there is only one option - move forward. This film is a series of movements, a series of suites - the great tone poem of all symphonies. Like The Long Gray Line five years later, there are two ideas fully consistent in this film.

The lack of a singular name emphasises that the film isn’t so much about a lone rider, as it is about community.\n\n“Wagon” can be viewed as Ford’s treatise on his particular vision of an American utopia.\n\nThe movie depicts a pacifist group of Mormons out to create an Edenesque farmstead in the West. There’s little strife within the Mormon ranks; all threats and conflict are external - to be dealt with in the most pragmatic…"
