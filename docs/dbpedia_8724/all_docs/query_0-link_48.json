        "text": "Gilberto Perez, who died in 2015, at the age of seventy-one, was one of the great scholars and theorists of the cinema. His peers agreed: they cited his book “The Material Ghost,” from 1998, as the most influential work of cinema studies of that decade—tied with Jean-Luc Godard’s film “Histoire(s) du Cinéma.” He was also my teacher, and, later, my friend. I studied under him at Princeton in the late nineteen-seventies, where he was the one and only professor of cinema studies. After I graduated, in 1980, we met by chance at a MOMA screening a few years later, and remained in touch for the rest of his life. Perez was as devoted and generous a friend as he was an inspiring teacher and an original thinker.\n\nOne of the last times that we saw each other, a year or so before his sudden passing, he told me that he was working on another book. He said it was about “the rhetoric of film” and didn’t say anything more about it. Now it’s here: “The Eloquent Screen: A Rhetoric of Film” was published, posthumously, by the University of Minnesota Press, in 2019. This month, I took part in a tribute to Perez at the Museum of the Moving Image (organized by another of his former students, Malia Haines-Stewart), where we screened John Ford’s 1950 Western “Wagon Master,” a film that I’d first seen in his class on “The Political Cinema: Ford, Eisenstein, Mizoguchi,” three filmmakers whose work he discusses extensively in the book. The screening was followed by a discussion in which the critic James Harvey, the programmer Edo Choi, and I celebrated the book, which I consider to be a landmark in the history of cinema studies, or what I’d call the philosophy of cinema.\n\nIn “The Eloquent Screen,” Perez develops a grand theory of the cinema but doesn’t trumpet this theory in bold rhetorical declarations. Rather, his theory steals in on cats’ feet, in the course of his meticulous discussions of specific moments and themes from a wide range of films. The book is the act, or the performance, of a teacher: although written with graceful precision and sly wit, the book retains a tone of orality that, to me, is distinctly reminiscent of Perez’s voice—in particular, his classroom voice. It evokes his presence with a deeply moving immediacy; it also, like a screenplay, is a book that embodies the trace of performance. Teaching is, of course, a kind of performing, an expression that’s simultaneously personal and formal. The modesty with which Perez develops his powerful ideas has that duality built into it; the book’s arguments appear both sincere and ironic, and that combination of traits itself comes off not as a contradiction but as the very essence of the theory itself. His idea is, in effect, a theory of multiplicity, and it arrives through the book’s carefully dialectical motion.\n\n“The Eloquent Screen” is in three parts plus a coda, and its composition masks the book’s vast scope and import. The substantial introductory section is devoted solely to Ford—beginning with “Judge Priest,” continuing with “Young Mr. Lincoln,” ending with “Wagon Master”—and it’s something of a surprise in its modesty. Perez’s analysis of the films is largely focussed not on classical tropes of rhetoric featured in Ford’s directorial method but on the deployment of rhetorical figures, within the context of the film, by Ford’s characters. The analyses of the films are discerning—one of the signal virtues of “The Eloquent Screen” is the acuity of Perez’s insights regarding the psychology of the action, the relationships of characters, the social and historical perspective embodied by a movie—but their theoretical underpinning, at the outset, is gradual and is centered on the very role and status of rhetoric in the history of critical thought. Perez advances with the notion that rhetoric functions as something like the reality principle, the interface of speech and of art with real-world experience, and his consideration of Ford’s cinematic rhetoric, which he interweaves with the political history of when the films were made, sustains his view of Ford as the most important American political filmmaker.\n\nThe second section, “Cinematic Tropes,” extensively considers the use of rhetorical analysis in literary theory. There, offering a history and a study of classical tropes (principally metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony), Perez considers their ubiquity in the composition of dozens of classic and modern movies, such as “It Happened One Night,” “Shoah,” Sembène’s “Ceddo,” Renoir’s “Toni,” Eisenstein’s “Battleship Potemkin,” Errol Morris’s “Mr. Death,” Godard’s “Band of Outsiders,” and Kiarostami’s “Close-Up.” Again, Perez presents his ideas through careful considerations of the films’ crucial moments and themes, the filmmakers’ careers and real-world identities and contexts, and the rhetorical figures that he discerns in their work. (Perez pays sympathetic attention to the work of other critics and theorists, which he assesses insightfully on the way to formulating his own illuminating views.) That chapter tellingly concludes on a brief but bold discussion of two of the grandest of all ideas, truth and beauty, which he calls both “goals” and “means of persuasion.”\n\nOn the heels of that divided unity, the third section, “Melodrama and Film Technique,” comes in, and it’s the philosophical lightning and thunder unleashed by the first two parts’ gradually brewing storm. The chapter’s very theme is unity in division, an artistic dialectic in action, and it gives rise to his powerful overarching concept. First, Perez redeems the very notion of melodrama from its pejorative uses; then he adduces its mode of “exaggeration” to the historical underpinnings and enduring core of the cinema. In the process, he both relates the cinema to its roots in theatre and detaches the cinema from it. In thrillingly exacting discussions of a wide range of movies—including Griffith’s “A Corner in Wheat,” Murnau’s “Nosferatu,” Stroheim’s “Greed,” Vidor’s “Stella Dallas,” Hitchcock’s “Shadow of a Doubt,” Mizoguchi’s “The Life of Oharu,” Malick’s “To the Wonder,” Wong Kar-wai’s “In the Mood for Love,” the Hughes brothers’ “Menace II Society,” Mike Figgis’s “Timecode,” and Pedro Almodóvar’s “Volver” (among many, many others)—Perez shows that the exaggerations and artifices of melodrama are more than consistent with the evocation of emotional and social reality. In fact, they’re central to it. So, for that matter, is the full range of filmmaking and movie viewing, in particular, performance, to which Perez pays exacting attention—without losing sight of the centrality of direction to a viewer’s experience of acting.\n\nWhere the introduction and second section borrow concepts of rhetoric from the classical literary tradition (as revised by modern theorists), the third section, in effect, discovers new rhetorical tropes that arise strictly from within, and by way of, the cinema itself. The crucial idea is that of “identification,” the subject of the book’s brief coda, with reference to Buster Keaton’s “Sherlock Jr.” For Perez, there’s no contradiction between a viewer’s awareness of watching a movie and being emotionally engaged with the movie’s characters, between noting brazen directorial interventions and getting carried away with the drama, between being inside and outside the movie at the same time. Not only is it no contradiction—it’s a constitutive dialectic of the cinema. That’s why, if I had to sum up “The Eloquent Screen” in three words, they would be the three-word motto that a teacher writes on a blackboard in “Band of Outsiders”: “classic = modern.”\n\nIn “The Eloquent Screen,” Perez brings together films reflecting a wide range of industries, traditions, national cinemas, time periods, techniques, and experiences, in order to unite them, to find their coherences and similarities by means of probing analyses of their distinctively cinematic rhetoric. In the process, he virtually defines (indirectly and only by suggestion) a term that has long dominated the discussion of movies: “mise en scène,” or staging, which refers to the relationship between text and image, drama and cinematic composition. The book sets up the notion of a new classical tradition, a specifically cinematic tradition, one that’s based on the power of the twentieth century’s new art form to borrow from existing forms to create its own new realm of experiences. The films that he gathers and studies exemplify this tradition, which Perez considers in its unity. But the book ends with an open door: it looks ahead to the question of what makes these and other films good—of artists’ own response to that tradition, their modifications or even repudiations of it, and the very concept of artistic merit in relation to, and apart from, the cinema’s classical style. What its ending evokes is a third book in a trilogy, one that would have been a work of cinematic aesthetics. That the author isn’t here to write it is as much of a historical tragedy as his absence is a personal one."
