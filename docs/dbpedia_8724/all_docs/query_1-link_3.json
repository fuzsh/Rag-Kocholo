        "text": "At one point in the film Sandy wonders if they are going in circles, referring to a piece of a mesa resembling a cathedral. The two then halt the wagon train and then scout on ahead. Later, after the Marshall and his deputies stop the train, the same mesa can be seen in the background as the wagon train travels in the opposite direction. This shot was made from the same exact camera position in both scenes. Later, when getting the wagons over the wash-out and Travis throws the gun away, the exact same background is seen once again, and again from the same exact camera angle.\n\nAfter Denver throws the bucket of water on Travis and he falls in the dirt, his arms and back are covered in dirt, in the next shot there is hardly any dirt on him, and he did not have time to brush it off.\n\nIn the beginning of the film, when Travis on the horse talks to the marshal, he folds his right leg leaning it on the saddle horn. In the next shot he is with his right leg hanging unfolded.\n\nWhen the marshal mounts the horse and Sandy whistles, he is sitting on the fence, on the right side of Travis. Soon after, when the Mormons arrive, Sandy is sitting on the left side of Travis\n\nIn the middle of the film the pioneers have a dance on a dozen wooden planks laid down in the middle of the camp. Wagon trains would not have any need for milled lumber. Nor would they have tolerated carrying such useless extra weight.\n\nA Golden Retriever is shown in close-up during the credits sequence. Goldens were originally bred in Scotland beginning in the 1860s, and were not registered in America until 1894. It's \"possible' that a Golden could have been accompanying the wagon train, but very unlikely."
