Colonel Claude Runciman, Wagon-Master General, is described as an obese, indolent man, who because of his post as wagon-master general, attempts to get Richard Sharpe to refer to him as "General."

He appears in Sharpe's Battle where, as a colonel, he is appointed as nominally in charge of Sharpe who is to be the drill master for the Real Compañía Irlandesa while Runciman serves as the liaison between the Compañía and Wellington.

Sharpe persuades the former Wagon-master to divert arms and ammunition to the Compañía. Unable just to let them rot, he is compelled to attempt to convert them into real soldiers. After the disastrous assault on the Compañía and their Portuguese allies at San Isidro Fort by French forces under Brigadier Guy Loup, Hogan appears at San Isidoro and informs Sharpe that Runciman and the British forces under him, will be sacrificed to a court of inquiry to satisfy the Spanish and Portuguese damaged pride.

Still in disgrace, Sharpe, Runciman, and the Real Compañía Irlandese are then left guarding the ammunition wagons during the battle Fuentes de Onoro. French assaults push the British out of the village, while Wellington releases his reserves, the 74th, 45th and the 88th Connaught Rangers, who beat back the French. The British, however, are counter-attacked by the Loup Brigade.

With Sharpe's forceful encouragement, Runciman, in an effort to save them both from ignominy, offers to lead the Spanish Regiment to reinforce the Highlanders and Connaught Rangers. Wellington agrees.
