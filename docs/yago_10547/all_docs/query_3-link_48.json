        "text": "Actor Varun Dhawan's parents, David Dhawan and Lalli Dhawan, had no clue that their son wanted to be an actor until, after finishing his studies, he approached filmmaker Karan Johar and told him, \"I want to assist you.\" Once Karan realised Varun's potential, he told David, \"I want to launch him.\" Hence, Varun was cast in the 2012 film Student of the Year, along with Sidharth Malhotra and Alia Bhatt.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut there were days when Varun would return upset from the set of the film, presumably because of Sidharth Malhotra. David, while speaking to actor-producer Arbaaz Khan on his chat show The Invincibles, shared, \"I was with him, and some days he used to be very upset also. I told him, ‘These things happen in two-hero films. Listen, my son, you’re damn good. Your confidence is something else. Don’t be afraid, take the leap.’”\n\nVarun did his bit and earned praise for his debut performance. David remembered veteran stars Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan praising Varun as they told him, \"Varun is a ‘lambi race ka ghoda (destined for greatness)’.”\n\nAfter the success of Student of the Year, many industry people suggested that Varun work with his filmmaker-father David. But the actor had a different style of working. While David never gave his actors a bound script, Varun wanted to know his character graph and details about his character before beginning to shoot.\n\nArbaaz Khan then shared that Varun even cried on the set of Main Tera Hero, a film directed by David Dhawan. On this, the filmmaker recalled not giving special treatment to Varun just because he is his son.\n\nDavid said, “I didn’t want to give him special treatment just because he’s my son. There was one scene, I remember, he was supposed to ride in on a bike, and he fell. And I joked, ‘Kahan se aaya hai yeh Karan Johar ka hero (He is a typical Karan Johar hero).’ He would become upset and complain to his brother (Rohit Dhawan) that he was being humiliated in front of everyone.”\n\nAfter Main Tera Hero, David Dhawan and Varun Dhawan worked together on Coolie No. 1 and Judwaa 2. Both films resulted in box office failures."
