        "text": "Right from Taqatwar in 1989 to Do Knot Disturb in 2009, actor Govinda and director David Dhawan collaborated for 18 films together. But there came a time when they stopped working together after an apparent fallout. What went wrong between them?\n\nBack in 2018, when the actor was on the show Aap Ki Adalat, he revealed, âWhen I completed 17 films with him, I told him the subject of Chashme Baddoor and he started the film with Rishi Kapoor. And when he was shooting the film, I called him and he said, ‘Tu sun toh mein kaise film bana raha hoon.Then I said, ‘Tu mujhe kehta toh - subject bhi utha lia.â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added, âAfter I left politics, I told my secretary to keep the phone speaker on, so that I could listen to what he (David Dhawan ) was saying. I heard David saying, ‘Chi-Chi (Govinda’s nickname) is questioning a lot.’ He was telling my secretary, ‘I do not want to work with Govinda anymore. Tell him to do some small bit roles.’ This shocked me and I decided never to work with him. After 4-5 months, I again rang him up just to find out if he would give me a guest appearance in his film. He then never rang me back. I am revealing this in public after so many years. I think he is under somebody’s influence. I do not think he is that same David Dhawan who I used to know.â\n\nA possible reunion?\n\nSpeaking to the Bombay Times, Govinda said, “I am glad people still feel that we should work together. _Yeh unka pyaar ha_i. (This is there love) our patch-up had already happened. This was our second meeting. It was a Diwali bash where we ate good food and had a great time. We donât believe in raking up the past. Why mull over it? Thatâs not necessary. Let bygones be bygones. Filmy talk wasnât a priority, but when that happened, we only spoke about the happy memories and those were plenty.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey both met at Ramesh Tauraniâs Diwali party."
