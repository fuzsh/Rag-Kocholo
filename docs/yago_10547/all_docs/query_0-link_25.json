He is like my family and we have had a long standing association.\n\nWe have already finalised Ajay for the film and we are looking for one more lead star.\n\nDavid Dhawan\n\nI was also actively involved in as many as ten of Sanjay’s films as an editor before I made Taaqatwar. I am so happy to be directing Sanju’s first production.”\n\nDharam Oberoi, CEO, Sanjay Dutt Productions said, “The film will be made in association with Rupali Om Entertainment which is Bharat Shah’s company and will go on the floors in October this year.”"
