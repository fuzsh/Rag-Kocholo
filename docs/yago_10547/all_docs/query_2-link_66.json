        "text": "Rumours of Varun Dhawan collaborating with his father David Dhawan for a rom-com have been going on for a long time. Fresh updates have been coming in and the recent one mentions that the film is titled Hai Jawani Toh Ishq Hona Hai. It is all set to release in October 2025. Well, an official announcement is still awaited.\n\nPinkvilla has reported that Ramesh Taurani’s production had been titled Hai Jawani Toh Ishq Hona Hai. “It’s a quirky title in sync with the world that David Dhawan is looking to create with Varun Dhawan, Mrunal Thakur, and Sreelela. It’s a fun family entertainer with the love triangle of the trio at the centre. David Dhawan has cracked a concept that’s fresh and original, and is confident to recreate the magic of comedies on the big screen again,” revealed a source.\n\n“Varun is shooting today with Maniesh Paul and Kubbra Sait. The entire ensemble will be coming together as the journey progresses. Get ready for a typical David Dhawan comedy with colours, music and a big star-cast,” the source concluded. It is also mentioned in the report that the film is gearing for release on October 2, 2025.\n\nEarlier, Pinkvilla quoted a source saying, “Much like all David Dhawan comedies, this one is also a love triangle where the humour is a result of confusion in leading man’s life. The team has roped in Sreeleela to play Varun’s love interest in the film. It’s a pakka-commercial entertainer and Sreeleela also feels that this would be the perfect launch pad for her in Hindi markets.”\n\nReportedly, Mrunal Thakur is also part of the film. Pinkvilla reported that the Sita Ramam actress has already gone through two meetings with the director in lieu of the project, “This is the first time that Varun and Mrunal are collaborating for a film, and everyone attached to the project is extremely excited about this fresh pairing. Mrunal and David sir have had a couple of meetings as well, and the film is expected to roll in May or June of this year. The preparation is underway, and the second female lead will be signed very soon,” the source revealed.\n\nOn the work front, Varun Dhawan will also be seen in Citadel with Samantha Ruth Prabhu. Directed by Raj and DK, Citadel is the Indian adaptation of the International series of the same name which was created by the director duo, the Russo Brothers. According to strong reports, the actress is performing high-octane action sequences in the film along with Varun Dhawan."
