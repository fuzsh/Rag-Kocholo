        "text": "Rascals, the first film from Sanjay Dutt Productions Pvt Ltd, opens on October 2 and the star-producer admits that he has no regrets for having waited so long to turn producer. “I’m glad it happened now, with Ajay (actor Ajay Devgn) and David (director David Dhawan). My comic timing with Ajay is fantastic and my relationship with David goes beyond that of an actor-director. I acted in his first film Taaqatwar (1989) and since then, we’ve done six films together — Haseena Maan Jayegi (1999), Chal Mere Bhai (2000), Jodi No. 1 (2001), Hum Kissi Se Kum Nahin (2002), Ek Aur Ek Gyarah (2003) and Shaadi No. 1 (2004). Rascals is more their film than mine. We had such a blast making it,” smiles Sanjay.\n\nThe actor is all set to go on the floors with his second production in December. Soham Shah will direct the remake of Satte Pe Satta (1982). “Satte Pe Satta is an iconic film. It was a trendsetter in the 1980s. Sir (Amitabh Bachchan) played the dual roles of Ravi and Babu so well, if I can even manage five per cent of what he did, I’ll be a happy man,” says Sanjay. “I’m going to request sir to introduce the characters in my movie.”\n\nThere’s been plenty of speculation about who would be cast opposite Sanjay in the film. It was said that Kajol was Sanjay’s first choice, but since she’s just delivered a baby, he didn’t want to pressurise her to return to the studio. There was talk of Vidya Balan and Rani Mukerji being approached too. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan also admitted to having received an offer and Soham was quoted as saying that Madhuri Dixit Nene had been signed for the role played by Hema Malini in the original. “Yes, I believe my co-producer Ashtavinayak had gone to Madhuri. She is a fabulous artiste, but Lolo (Karisma Kapoor) is equally good and suits the role to the T,” says Sanjay, confirming that Karisma has been signed on for the role."
