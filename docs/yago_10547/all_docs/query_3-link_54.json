        "text": "Who can forget the duo of actor Govinda and director David Dhawan in the Hindi film industry. The actor-director duo produced around 17 films together, including Hero No. 1, Coolie No. 1, Raja Babu, Bade Mian Chhote Mian and Partner. Each film is a better comedy than the other. Despite many flaws, Govinda remained David Dhawan’s favorite actor for years. It has always been said about Govinda that he was often late on the sets. But David Dhawan doesn’t think so.\n\nRecently, David Dhawan arrived on Arbaaz Khan’s show The Invincible. Meanwhile, he discussed his film journey. He also spoke openly about his favorite actor Govinda. He clearly said that only I can handle it. Praising Govinda, he said, “He was the king of improvisation, who helped me a lot. We were doing this. The song was amazing. One after another kept coming.”\n\n‘Only I could handle it’\n\nDavid Dhawan said that when he was telling Govinda that the scene was rubber, it was long, it was painted, Govinda would say, ‘David, do one thing, I’ll give the whole scene in one shot.’ One shot was four pages long. But we used to shoot that scene. He said, “I did 17 films with Govinda, but I was the only person who could handle it. Very well behaved. He has always respected me a lot. ” When asked about Govind’s late arrival on the set, David Dhawan said that my work was getting done. That means Govinda always finishes his shooting.\n\nGovinda and Salman Khan were seen together in the film Partner. When the two were cast together, David Dhawan said, “Sohail approached me. I said Govinda and Salmanbhai can be taken? He said it would be great. Salman bhai was not very ready. I said dude, this is going to be a big film. He came and shot the entire film the way we did it. Awesome.”\n\nDavid wanted to make a sequel to Partner\n\nMeanwhile, David Dhawan revealed that he wants to make a sequel to his film partner. He said, “Wanted to make a partner. My family loved that movie.” Partner was released in the year 2007 and the movie was a huge hit. Apart from Salman-Govinda, the movie also starred Lara Dutta and Katrina Kaif. The movie was produced by Sohail Khan and Parag Sanghvi. The film did a business of Rs 99.66 crore worldwide.\n\nGovinda and David’s films\n\nGovinda and David Dhawan together in Shola Aur Shabnam, Aanke, Raja Babu, Coolie No. 1, Sajan Chale Sasural, Hero No. 1, Banarasu Babu, Diwana Mastana, Bade Mian Chhote Mian, Haseena Maan Jayegi, Kunwara, Jodi No. 1. , Kyun He has done films like… I am not lying, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah, Parton, Do Not Disturb."
