        "text": "Varun Dhawan has again teamed up with his father, David Dhawan after giving a blockbuster comedy, ‘Main Tera Hero.’ The duo followed the runaway with ‘Judwaa 2’ and then delivered another blockbuster collaboration titled, ‘Coolie No. 1.’ Now, the duo are set for a fourth collaboration and are coming together for another comic-masala film. The untitled project will mark David Dhawan’s 46th directorial, and will go on floors in 2023.\n\nAccording to a report in Pinkvilla, “All through the pandemic, David Dhawan has been speaking to his team of writers on several subjects and has finally locked something that has excited him to take the director’s chair for the 46th time. It’s a big-budget comedy entertainer and will go on floors in 2024. Varun is also very excited to get back to the comic space with the king of comedies.”\n\nAlso Read: Kannada Actor Dhruva Sarja Welcome Baby Boy With Wife Prerana Shankar Bringing Joy To The Sarja Family\n\nThe report further stated, “It’s a typical David Dhawan comedy, with the protagonist against the backdrop of romance. It’s an area of expertise of David Dhawan, and he has got young writers on board to keep up with today’s sensibilities while retaining his own flavor of comedy. The film will be a big festive release and an official announcement will be made shortly.”\n\nAlso Read: Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani Inspired By This Bollywood Couple; Filmmaker Karan Johar Says ‘Maybe Subconsciously I Got Inspired’\n\nVarun Dhawan is currently shooting for Atlee’s next, under Murad Khetani Production, which is tentatively addressed as ‘VD 18.’ The actor is also in talks with Dharma Productions starring in Shashank Khaitan’s next romantic-comedy.
