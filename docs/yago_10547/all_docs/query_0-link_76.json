        "text": "The cast of David Dhawan’s film Rascals has a reason to rejoice. The film has garnered the third highest opening for the year, after Salman Khan’s Ready and Bodyguard.\n\nThe comic flick, that stars Sanjay Dutt, Ajay Devgn, Kangna Ranaut, Lisa Haydon and Arjun Rampal, did good business on its opening day, October 6, and is still doing well at the box office.\n\nThe movie has garnered a collection of Rs 8.63 crore on the first day itself, making it the third highest for 2011.\n\nThis was despite a limited release and low ticket prices compared to the weekends. Trade pundits say that if the tickets were priced at the regular rates, then the movie could have grossed higher and maybe even crossed Rs 11 crore on the opening day.\n\nMeanwhile, Dhawan is all praise for his lead actor Sanjay Dutt. “Sanjay is like an open book. He doesn’t hide anything. He is the most simple guy I have ever seen. I started my career with him 20 years back as a director and he is still the same. There is no change in him,” says Dhawan, who first worked with him in Taaqatwar in 1989. About Ajay, he says, “He comes across as a very serious person which actually he is not. He is a very easy person.\n\nWith inputs from IANS"
