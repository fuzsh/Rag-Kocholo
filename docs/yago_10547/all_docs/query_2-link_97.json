        "text": "While watching Main Tera Hero, I had to think through Varun Dhawan’s performance as that of a hyperactive kid who’s having the time of his life jumping at a bouncy castle. If that analogy doesn’t fit, let me break this another way, we’ll get to see him trying exceptionally hard to fit in the shoes of Govinda but Varun’s upsetting portrayal takes the form of a parody, and even though he tries hard, his smugness evokes nothing but discomfort .\n\nOur hero Seenu (Varun Dhawan) has earned himself the tag of a troublemaker at his home town. His parents and the town-folks want to get rid of him, so when Seenu decides to leave for Bengaluru to complete his studies, the entire town triumphantly comes to bid him farewell at the train station.\n\nOnce he reaches his college, he is instantly smitten by Sunaina (Ileana D’Cruz). But a hero isn’t a hero until the villain arrives, and Sunaina has another admirer, a fiery cop (Arunoday Singh) who pounds on any guy approaching Sunaina. Seenu faces off with the hot headed cop to win Sunaina’s love, except there’s a new twist just before the second half. The daughter (Nargis Fakhri) of a criminal kingpin falls for Seenu and her dad’s ready to comply with his daughter’s whim and forces Seenu to marry his daughter.\n\nThe film is directed by David Dhawan, Varun’s father. Comedy is David Dhawan’s niche and we’ve seen him toy with the genre successfully. His style of comedy contains loudmouth protagonists, even louder supporting characters and plots that he lifts every now and then from his own previous movies. Having directed forty odd movies, senior Dhawan is consistent in terms of delivering mediocre comedies that fair well commercially, however it’s about time for him to emerge out of his traditional horseplay, simply because his method is overdone and we’ve outgrown his tedious humor since a decade.\n\nThe leads rarely leave any spots for us to admire, Varun’s busy with his monkey business hopping from one place to another and flexing his acrobatic muscles, while the camera’s busy focusing the frames on either Ileana’s legs or Nargis’s midriff. In this mess, we notice David Dhawan regulars like Shakti Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav and Anupam Kher, who try their level best to humiliate themselves a little less.\n\nHalfway through the movie, Varun’s character straightaway launches into a dance by parodying ‘Badtameez Dil’ into a bhajan dedicated to Lord Shiva, and after that point I realized the sole purpose of the movie is to cash in laughs from those random and spur of the moment ideas as if the audiences are bunch of witless people who will enjoy anything the makers cram in.\n\nComing back to the bouncy castle, Main Tera Hero is half inflated with randomness and half with a labored effort to make us laugh with outdated tactics."
