        "text": "David Dhawan, father of veteran filmmaker and actor Varun Dhawan, started his career in the film industry as a film editor. He took admission in FTII to pursue an acting course, but soon realized that he could not act, so he thought of something else and started editing. But how did David the editing David become the director David? This story is also very interesting. And Sanjay Dutt has the biggest role behind David becoming the director.\n\nDavid Dhawan got work in films even before finishing college. In an interview given to Arbaaz Khan, he said that Sawan Kumar offered him work in films even before graduation. He said, “Where my brother lived, Sawanji also lived. I kept coming and going. He would want to eat with me and make me sit next to him. I was in FTII, Sawan Kumar came. I was editing at the time. He asked me when are you passing out. I said it is being completed in three-four months. Said you come to me. You got the movie.”\n\nHe did a great job in his first film\n\nDavid Dhawan said he met him when he finished college. Sawan Kumar gave him editing work in the film Saajan Bina Suhagan. David said that he did the film in flashback. Later, when Sawan Kumar saw him, he asked what he had done. To this David replied that he didn’t enjoy it so he did it. Then Sawan Kumar liked David’s editing and said that it will be the same from now on.\n\nEdited and changed fortunes of the Naam film\n\nSanjay Dutt’s film title was edited by David Dhawan. He said, “Name is a very big thing in my life. I was editing the film Naam. Sanjay Dutt was an actor in this film. Sanjay was very friendly and forthcoming. One day he came and said, ‘David, why don’t you become a director.’ I said, who will make me a friend, I am an editor. He said ‘You have become’. I have signed a film two days ago, you will direct that film.\n\nDawood’s film was Taktar which came in the year 1989. Apart from Sanjay Dutt, the film also featured Govinda, Anita Raj, Neelam Kothari and Anupam Kher. Apart from directing, David also worked on the writing of the film with Anwar Khan and HM Mirza.\n\nDavid Dhawan said that he had not thought of becoming a director before this incident. He said though my wife always wanted me to become a director. David Dhawan said that he was editing Agneepath when Sanjay Dutt made him director. After this he left the film."
