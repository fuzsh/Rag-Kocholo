This time, it’s under the acclaimed director David Dhawan, who is known for his comedic ventures in Indian cinema. The first film the two actors starred in together was the 2023 action-drama film Bawaal. Now, with David at the helm, fans can expect their next movie to be a comedy.\n\nCheck out the trailer of Bawaal here:\n\nJahnvi Kapoor, Varun Dhawan’s next movie with David Dhawan\n\nFollowing the release of Bawaal, speculations have been rife about Jahnvi Kapoor and Varun Dhawan joining forces again. According to a report by India Today, David Dhawan is putting together a project that will bring these two stars together.\n\nThe director, famous for hits like Partner (2007) and Judwaa (1997), is in the process of crafting a cinematic experience that promises laughter, entertainment, and a generous dose of confusion in the love life of the protagonists.\n\nThe report further mentioned, “The director is putting together a project for the duo. However, it is not yet known whether it is a remake or an original script. But, it’s certainly an exciting development for fans to see the two actors reunite on screen.”\n\nAlthough the report regarding their collaboration has surfaced, it is to be noted that the actors or the director have not confirmed the collaboration.\n\nThis venture will mark the fourth collaboration between Varun and David Dhawan. The father-son duo has previously worked together on Main Tera Hero, Judwaa 2, and Coolie No. 1. Additionally, Pinkvilla has earlier reported the two are collaborating “for an out-and-out comic entertainer.”\n\nThe source revealed, “Much like David Dhawan’s world of comedies, this one too will see a Varun Dhawan alongside two leading ladies. The humor of this yet untitled comic caper is a result of confusion in the love life of the protagonist. Varun is very excited too to revisit the comic space after a while.”\n\nAs such, even if the trio’s upcoming project may or may not be with each other, David’s film surely promises to be a laughter riot."
