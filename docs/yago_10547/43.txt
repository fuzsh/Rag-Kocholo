Incidentally David’s first film as a director, Taaqatwar (1989), had Sanjay playing the lead and now Sanjay’s first film as a producer will be directed by David.

When contacted David confirmed, “Sanju gave me a break when I made Taaqatwar. He is like my family and we have had a long standing association.

We have already finalised Ajay for the film and we are looking for one more lead star.

I was also actively involved in as many as ten of Sanjay’s films as an editor before I made Taaqatwar. I am so happy to be directing Sanju’s first production.”
