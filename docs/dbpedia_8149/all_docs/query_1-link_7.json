        "text": "This is the biggest (and last üò±) news I‚Äôm sharing as CEO of Front. I‚Äôm thrilled to announce that I‚Äôve hired Dan O'Connell to become Front‚Äôs next CEO üôå https://lnkd.in/gSWXPd5j If I had to draw the shape of the perfect CEO for our next stage, I‚Äôd want (from most to least obvious): - A curious, caring, assertive, and ambitious individual - An outstanding operator with a proven track-record - Familiar with the customer service software market - With experience in efficient growth over $100M ARR - Who has built and sold AI products for many years - And been CEO of a startup before! - And taken over from a founder before!! Dan is all this, and so much more. He‚Äôs one of only 2 people I‚Äôve met in the past 10 years and thought: wow, I‚Äôd love to work for him. He is an incredibly thoughtful person, with highly contagious energy. His standards are high, he is all at once fiercely competitive and fun to be around (and an amazing singer-guitarist that you can see perform live in SF). I‚Äôm incredibly proud of what we‚Äôve built over the past 10 years. I‚Äôm also proud to pass the torch when Front‚Äôs momentum is in full swing: we‚Äôre hitting above our goals, we‚Äôre hiring across all teams, and we‚Äôre shipping the most innovative stuff in years. Better yet: there‚Äôs more to come. And, of course, that‚Äôs a very emotional moment for me. I‚Äôve poured ten years of my life into this company, trying to get the perfect blend of ambition and care, and I like to think I‚Äôve been mostly successful at that. I love this company more than words can tell. This is why I‚Äôm not going far either: I‚Äôll take on the role of Executive Chair, and continue working for our beloved customers. Dan, I give you my most intricate, powerful, precious LEGO set to date. Make of it something even better!\n\nWow, today was truly inspirational! You always get nervous when you let someone know that you're going down a different path. Like when I talked with JB Daguen√© ‚úäüá∫üá¶ today about the next venture I was taking on. For most people, you dread that chat and undergo this mix of feelings of fear, uncertainty, some excitement, and especially if your tenure was short, expectations that you'll cause a rift. But this is why Evergrowth is an amazing company. Even in my short tenure, we pivoted from professional services into a productized software solutions offering. Full SaaS, all gas, with everyone at the org taking no prisoners on executing large projects swiftly. The culture prioritizes results, the CEO is the best salesperson at the org, everyone agrees on customer centric alignment, engineering/prod obliterate priorities, operations keeps everything humming, no one lets ego get in the way and this is one of the lowest friction orgs I've seen when it comes to everyone wearing multiple hats. So speaking with some of the executive team today, Aivaras Rastenis and Apolinaras Sinkevicius, it was bittersweet. I'll genuinely miss my team here. The conversations weren't abrupt or disappointing. Instead, after explaining my new direction I was given amazing support, understanding, and a reminder of what I managed to achieve during my time here. * We condensed several other solutions and processes into a rapid deployment of a unifying toolset with the entire org. Full pivot/adoption in less than 30 days. * Built/launched a huge portion of the platform via viable MVP in a low code solution cutting down an estimated 80% of prior overlap. * Kicked off outbound into the US from a company with a single digit original founding team that started in Lithuania. It's been a crazy ride, and I look forward to Evergrowth changing the face of sales. Certainly expecting announcements of some incredibly large tier 1 major logos in the relatively close future (seriously at this size of company, this is insane). I'll be winding down the week, and will post a new update on what I'm doing next soon. Between those milestones, I'm looking forward to at least several days of some fun in the sun, drink in hand, laughing with people I love. It's never bye in this very small high growth, early stage pond. Until next time! ü§ô #sales #marketing #growth #saas #linkedin #revops\n\nIt was a typical office day when a sudden call for an urgent meeting from the CEO sent a ripple of speculation through the team. Theories of acquisitions and layoffs swirled around, making many nervous. Finally, the CEO entered the room and, in a firm tone, declared, \"Our product sales are down; we need new features.\" While there was a collective sigh of relief from those fearing worse news, a new wave of anxiety swept over a select group. üòì üòÖ üò∞ If you've ever been in this position, chances are you're a product manager (PM), and trust me, you are not alone. üòá ü§ì This is what David Bland aptly calls the ‚ÄúProduct Death Cycle.‚Äù In this post, I aim to delve into the age-old conflict of what we, as PMs, envision for our products versus what we end up building and how as a PM can understand Product Death Cycle and break free from it. https://lnkd.in/g2Am8SMf\n\nExactly 1 Year back, I was struggling to üëá - Figure out how I should sustain running a bootstrapped company. - Onboard more clients and sustain the existing ones - Launch SaaS - Increase ARR - Expand my team I knew this year would be very challenging for us at Team Codesign, but ek chiz to pakki thee ki ham haar nahi manenge. Fast-forward to today, when I was reflecting on what we achieved for this year, I could not even think of it, even in my wildest dreams last year. Here‚Äôs what we were able to do in 2023 üëá - Worked with Local USA Govt Identity - Onboarded 5+ enterprise clients - Expanded my team to 18 people - I kept working with one of the biggest players in the Telecom Industry - Bootstrapped to 8-figure ARR - Built and started scaling Speech To Note - Shifted to a new office But it didn‚Äôt happen overnight. It took tons of hours, failures, and setbacks to get here. Every time I stumbled, it taught me something important. There were moments when I thought I might not make it, but I kept going. I learned from my mistakes and never gave up. It was tough, but it got me here. To anyone feeling stuck: Keep moving. (Duniya ka naara jame raho) Even the hardest roads can lead to amazing places. Keep believing and learning. You might surprise yourself. Btw how did you start your journey? #yearendrelfections #yearinreview #manifestation\n\nThis one is a little personal for me. I never shared this with anyone. If you didn't know, I am obsessed with hypergrowth SaaS companies. And for the last 5 years, I've been tracking companies that are on the road to an IPO. \"What's the point of that?\" I want to work at the companies that are winning. You know the unicorn companies raising huge series rounds, breaking ARR milestones, and making headlines in TechCrunch every week? Those are the places I want to grow my career. And this specific list landed me life-changing roles at some of the fastest-growing startups in history. Not once. Not twice. But three times in a row. And guess what? I'm sharing it so you can win too. So before you start asking questions, I already did all the dirty work and heavy lifting. Here's what you get in this list of 50+ companies: ‚Ä¢ Careers Page Links ‚Ä¢ Glassdoor Reviews ‚Ä¢ Fundraising Amounts ‚Ä¢ Company Valuations ‚Ä¢ Series Rounds Just kick back, relax, and sign up! Not sure how long I'm going to keep it open to the public so make sure you get access today. Unlock the list here: https://lnkd.in/g_KAhEis PS. ‚ôªÔ∏è Repost this or send it to a friend who's looking for a new role.\n\nOur competitors were better on all fronts. They had it all: ‚Üí Large funding, while we were bootstrapped. ‚Üí Media spotlight, while we were quietly building. ‚Üí Prestigious accelerators, while we refused to join. ‚Üí Large teams, while we were a handful of founders. ‚Üí An array of features, while we focused on the core. ‚Üí Dedicated sales teams, while I was on double duty. ‚Üí Generous salaries, while we couldn‚Äôt pay ourselves. ‚Üí Top-tier execs, while we were multitasking endlessly. ‚Üí Lavish marketing, while we relied on word-of-mouth. On paper, we shouldn't have stood a chance. Yet, here we are, while most can‚Äôt tell their side of the story. They ran out of money, or they simply gave up. If you‚Äôre worried about competition, just stop. Focus that energy into building a business that lasts. And when you do, you‚Äôll be the one beating on all fronts. Do you agree or disagree? I‚Äôd love to hear your competitor stories. ‚Äî I'm Pierre Sabbagh, a tech founder. Follow me for weekly stories from my journey.\n\nScenario of the day‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve just started at a large tech company, on a new team that‚Äôs selling a small cutting-edge product that was recently acquired by the parent company that hired you. The product is a standalone offer, separate from the platform the company specializes in. After the first month, you still haven‚Äôt gotten your territory assignment. After the second month, the company still hasn‚Äôt built a process for placing orders. After the third month, the CEO holds a team-wide call saying that there was a mistake, and the product can‚Äôt be standalone, but has to be integrated into the larger platform. Development will take ‚Äú6 months‚Äù - which you know is a laughably low number. What do you do?\n\nHere are 10 things you should do right after catching your first VP role. Well, at very first: throw a smashing party üéâüéäüöÄ Also: You should join Pavilion! At least that's what Henry Mossop did and we couldn't be more proud to be welcoming him to the community. Born in England, he found his way to family roots in Belgium leading teams at Proxyclick, N-SIDE and AppTweak. Next to the excitement, VPs now want to nail a couple of things straight out of the gate. Not starting from scratch and having a peer group around who have done it before, ensures speed, limits errors and makes the journey way more enjoyable. Here is what's on your plate: 1. Managing up (founder) and down (your team) 2. Building a strong and complimentary team 3. Connecting market reality to growth ambitions 4. Contextualising good and bad news as they happen 5. Be part of a peer group to ask for help 6. Be \"P&L fluent\" and understand what it means to your business 7. Have a plan, make it and understand why 8. Be a sparring partner between teams to remove friction points 9. Building a personal brand for hiring 10. Pay it forward to other people coming through the ranks How did your first VP experience go? #saas #revenue #sales #personalgrowth\n\nInterview with an Engineer! Not just any engineer, the great Simon Blixenkrone, one of our founding engineers at Clicks and Mortar. It was a pleasure to chat to Simon about life, love and the pursuit of happiness. Here are a few of the highlights. Why did you join C&M? At the time, I was looking for my next endeavour as an engineering lead. I had some thoughts on how I wanted to further extend and explore my professional capabilities, and use my experience to build something great. I met up with Carey Benn and Aden Fraser in London, and we ended up talking for hours about the venture, product, culture and personal interests. I decided to join from day 0 - and what a ride the first year has been! Favourite moment so far? This is particularly hard to answer, since there's quite a few fantastic moments. I've had all sorts of great moments ranging from our quarterly get togethers, daily shenanigans and work/feature accomplishments. I did once win a wrestling match with our dear CTO? That one is definitely up there among the hackathons, casinos, late night activities and bar hopping we've done as a company. What is unique about working at C&M? Our daily ways of working are truly defining a new world era. Some of my core expectations for a great work place are elements you'll definitely find at C&M: Responsibility, growth and a strong culture. What is your dream for C&M? It's not just a dream but the direction we're heading: make our name known in the tech industry as a top tier company that provides really clever products and solutions, where reliability, performance and scalability is at the center of our engineering approach. #engineer #startup #culture"
