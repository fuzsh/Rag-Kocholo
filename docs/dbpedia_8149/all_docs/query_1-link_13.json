Lord of ghosts returns) is a 2014 Indian Hindi-language supernatural comedy film directed by Nitesh Tiwari and produced by Bhushan Kumar.[3] A sequel to the 2008 film Bhoothnath, the film revolves around Bhoothnath (Amitabh Bachchan) who is mocked in a Bhoothworld for his inability to scare children before being sent back to Earth to redeem himself. The film was released on 11 April 2014.[4][5][6]\n\nThe Election Commission of India demanded tax-free status for Bhoothnath Returns, stating, \"The state governments should support the strong social message that emanates from the film. Granting tax-free status to this film would make people aware of their rights as voters, like making voter ID cards or not treating polling day as a holiday\".[7] The Uttar Pradesh government has declared tax-free status to film on 30 April 2014.\n\nBhoothnath Returns: The Game, an election mobile video game developed by Vroovy (a joint venture of Hungama and Gameshastra) was also released as a tie-in item to the film.[8]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe story continues from the previous film.\n\nKailash Nath, also known as Bhoothnath, enters the Bhoothworld, where he is mocked and questioned about his abilities as a ghost as he was unsuccessful in scaring any children. To redeem himself, he returns to India, where he tries his best to scare children but is unsuccessful with his attempts as the children have become strong physically, mentally, and verbally. However, a boy named Akhrot can see him in his true form. Akhrot is not scared of Bhoothnath but helps him scare a few children; in return, he asks Bhoothnath to act scared of him and to run away from a haunted house while he chants mantras in front of the children, so that they can accept him on their cricket team.\n\nBhoothnath decides to help Akhrot further by helping him earn money by giving ghosts living in under-construction high rises peace by fulfilling the wishes they were still staying back on Earth as ghosts for; in the process, they come to know why the ghosts died and help their families get insurance money by scaring corrupt insurance officers, further learning in this process about Bhau, a former criminal who is now a corrupt politician. Seeing the amount of corruption in India, and encouraged by Akhrot, Bhoothnath decides to contest the upcoming elections. Soon, the rivalry between Bhoothnath and Bhau heats up, to the extent that Bhoothnath sacrifices his powers to win. One day before the elections, a rally is to be held by Bhoothnath to encourage a high turnout on election day. Bhau's men threaten to kill Akhrot unless he prevents the rally from happening, but Akhrot refuses and is ready to face the consequences.\n\nOn the day of the rally, Bhau's men injure Akhrot grievously for his non-compliance, which causes Bhoothnath to leave his rally to attend to Akhrot in the hospital. He goes to the Bhoothworld and begs for Akhrot's life. They tell him that if Bhoothnath wins the election, they will spare Akhrot's life. Meanwhile, Bhau uses Bhoothnath's absence at the rally to his advantage and tries to influence the audience to vote for him. However, on election day, the majority of the public votes for Bhoothnath. The next day, Bhootnath sees Akhrot's heartbeat rising and realizes that he won the election. The film ends with Akhrot regaining consciousness and everybody celebrating the success of Bhoothnath.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAmitabh Bachchan as Kailash Nath a.k.a.
