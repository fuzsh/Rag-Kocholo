        "text": "Share\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nEmail\n\nDid Subhash Ghai give you the pet name Mishti?\n\nIt is my pet name; it was not given by Mr. Ghai\n\nUsually in the case of Subhash Ghai and the people who work under him, all their names start with M.\n\nI’ll tell you the how it happened. When I came for Kaanchi I was not even aware that Mr Ghai has this M factor controversy. It was an all of a sudden, out of the blue offer for me.\n\nI was just modelling in my college days and my hoardings were out in the city. I then did this very good Bengali film with Prasanjit Chatterjee which was a father-doctor story with Prasanjit Chatterjee playing the father. The film was shot in London and after I came back, I suddenly got this call from Subhash Ghai. It just so happened that the director of the Bengali film I had just finished with was at Subhash Ghai’s house for an interview where he became aware of Subhash Ghai not being happy with whoever he was interviewing. He then showed him some of my photos and he fixed it up without even informing me; I had no idea! Then suddenly I get this call; I had no plans of joining this industry, I thought it was a prank call or something, it was just unbelievable. Subsequently I packed my bags and came down to Mumbai.\n\nI read that you’ve worked also an English teacher in Bengal.\n\nWikipedia has mostly bogus information about me, (laughs) most of the facts there are incorrect. I have been very independent since I was in Class 10. I had my own private coaching centre in West Bengal, kids get private teachers right from the time that they are very young. I mean how can I teach in a school?\n\nYou have worked in Bengali films and now you are working in Bollywood. What are the major differences between them?\n\nI have just done one major Bengali film and I started with a docu-feature film of Saanghamitra Chaudhuri which was on Rabindranath Tagore. It was not like a filmy film and shooting shooting; it was very basic. Porichoi which was with Prosenjit Chatterjee was a really big show with a good banner. I think film making varies from director to director. Every director has his own style, how they look at the subject, how they treat the actors.\n\nI didn’t find that much difference between the two industries, just that Bollywood is a much bigger platform. Otherwise all film industries are basically the same.\n\nSo you are open to regional cinema as well. Do you have any inhibitions?\n\nSee my focus is Bollywood. When it comes to regional, I think I would love to do Telugu, because Telugu and Tamil are also very big platforms.\n\nSo what challenges do you foresee in this industry?\n\nWell I don’t have any background, but at the same time I had no plans of joining the industry either. Suddenly out of the blue I had this Subhash Ghai offer. I think it was a big break for me and it has at least given me a foothold in the industry. So that way I consider myself lucky and of course challenges are there.\n\nBut as a star can you continue getting offers? Like maybe one film or two films….\n\nYou do but you know, people criticise your work and have high expectations from you. At the end of the day every kind of work that you do will have challenges.\n\nIs it true that you have an exclusive film contract with Mukta arts?\n\nNo I don’t have any exclusive film contract; I have signed 3 films with Mukta arts. The projects are not yet finalised so I’m open for all outside films of my choice.\n\nWho’s your favourite film star in this industry among the new generation of actors?\n\nI think everybody’s doing their fair share and a good job; I cannot exactly say which newcomer is my favourite because I think that everybody’s doing good work and is super talented; I don’t have a right to judge them. Amongst the actors I would say I like all the sweethearts, Shahrukh and Salman.\n\nWhat about your wish-list; who would you like to work with?\n\nI would like to work with everybody. I want to start with Shahrukh Khan, then Salman Khan, then Aamir Khan and then the newer generation of actors. Siddharth Malhotra is there, Varun Dhawan is there, Aditya Roy Kapur is there.\n\nSo what about directors wish list?\n\nIt’s very difficult to say now, because there are so many. I want to do more and more with every director. To start with, probably Saran Kumar, Imtiaz Ali andSanjay Leela Bhansali.\n\nSo what about your other interests and hobbies?\n\nNot muchwhen I get time, I write poems. The only thing I do in my pastime with the little free time that I get; I love dogs and animals so I spend time with them, sometimes stray dogs. That is the only hobby that I have. That is the love of my life and my first love; I’m crazy about animals.\n\nYour are the sixth heroine chosen by Subhash Ghai. I will say the names of the others, you just describe them to me.\n\nWhat would you say about Meenakshi?\n\nMeenakshi has that aura of serenity about her; that’s what I like about her.\n\nAnd Madhuri Dixit?\n\nMadhuri has amazing grace and is a superb dancer.\n\nAnd Manisha?\n\nWith Manisha there is a certain kind of vulnerability in her face; a very fragile beauty I would say.\n\nAnd Mahima Chaudhary?\n\nMahima Chaudhary is not good….\n\nAnd Isha Sherwani?\n\nIsha Shewwani is a good dancer and has a very flexible body.\n\nAnd last but not the least…Mishti?\n\nAh Mishti! (laughs). I think beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder and it will be better for the people who have watched me to describe me. Because for me,ever since my childhood I’ve had a major superiority complex. I can’t see anything beyond myself; I’m a total narcissist. I think every actor is. So that way I don’t have a right so say anything about myself\n\nAny quality which you like about yourself?\n\nI like everything about myself. Like I said I’m a narcissist; I’m totally in love and obsessed with myself.\n\nAnything that you don’t like about yourself?\n\nNothing (laughs). I don’t believe in perfection, so every day when I wake up I want to be better than yesterday.\n\nIs there any one thing that you would like to change about yourself?\n\nI don’t want to change anything about myself – I just want to be better.\n\nIf not a film actress, then what would you have been?\n\nWell my mom had high expectations that I would grow up to be a researcher. Maybe a professor, because I was very good in academics. So maybe I would have taken that up, but I think I always wanted to be in the glamour industry. I had plans to be an actress so I was always interested in modelling.\n\nWhy do they say, “If you won’t survive in the industry…”?\n\nWhat’s the big deal? You can’t let the fear take over you. I’m very calm from the inside; I am perfectly composed and calm at my core. Neither success nor failure affects me to that extent that I’ll be scared. I’m just into my work and I try to give it my best. After that it might be luck and it might or might not happen. At the end of the day, life is the most beautiful gift that you have. Just because of the fear of something, you can’t stop living.\n\nDo you believe in love at first sight?\n\nYes I do.\n\nWas it love or lust at first sight?\n\nMaybe, though I don’t know. I’ve not really experienced that.\n\nDid you ever break any hearts?\n\nYes. Many\n\nAnd did anybody ever break yours?\n\nNo no. (laughs)\n\nWhat is the definition of love according to you?\n\nThe definition of love changes with beliefs. When I was 13 or 14, it was obsession for me. Like the person belongs to me, he’s my property and he can’t look at anyone else. I would even be jealous of his relatives being close to him.\n\nWere you ever obsessed with anybody? Bollywood Actress\n\nYes I was obsessed at that age. As I grew up, I realised that love is more about friendship; the commitment does not need to be loud. You can’t say that I belong to you, but at the same time you know that the person belongs to you. I think now more than a lover, I would search for somebody who is my best friend.\n\nSo what all qualities would you look for in him?\n\nI can share everything with him. I think true love for me right now is all about friendship and being open with each other. He has to be my best friend. Inner beauty matters, not the exterior beauty. Yes of course he has to be presentable, but not that he has to be a handsome hunk. There should not be any secrets between us. He should be as good as one’s girlfriends. Girls actually have that girl bonding, so it should be as good as that. I should be able to pour my heart out to him.\n\nTell us about your upcoming ventures. Bollywood Actress\n\nI have a couple of offers in Bollywood and also a few down south as well. Frankly right now I have not decided or made any commitments on paper because I am still waiting for the best thing to come my way. So I don’t think that this is the right moment to talk about it, but when it happens I’ll let you know.\n\nFor regular updates, visit our social media pages by clicking the options below:"
