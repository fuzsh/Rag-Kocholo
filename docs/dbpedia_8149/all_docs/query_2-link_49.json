        "text": "Even as people across the Telugu states celebrate a new beginning this Ugadi, the one thing that keeps everyone together is movies. No matter what kind of an year you have, Telugu families love to get together for a film – and forget everything else for a while. This Ugadi, we give you a checklist of the films to watch out for in 2017.\n\nBaahubali: The Conclusion\n\nIndia’s most awaited film, the second part of SS Rajamouli’s magnum opus is finally slated to release this summer. Given the scale of Baahubali’s success, the film has turned into an event in itself with its pre-release launch getting national recognition. Baahubali: The Beginning was one of the country’s highest grossing films ever, and given its abrupt end, expectations from the second part have increased even further. Director SS Rajamouli has stated that Baahubali 2 will be even bigger and better than the first part, while Karan Johar, who’s producing the Hindi version, said that after 67 years, Baahubali has even surpassed the magic created by Mughal-E-Azam on screen.\n\nFeaturing Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty and Tamannaah, Baahubali: The Conclusion will hit screens on April 28.\n\nAmi Tumi\n\nWhy let big stars have all the fun? If recent memory serves, films where a group of talented actors came together, produced better films than star-driven ones. Now actors Srinivas Avasarala, Adivi Sesh and Vennela Kishore have come together for an upcoming multi-starrer directed by Indraganti Mohan Krishna. The producers have dubbed this film as a ‘hilarious entertainer’ and the first look suggests that it could have a lot of fun moments. Ami Tumi features Eesha Rebba and Aditi Myakal as female leads and is slated to release in the second half of the year.\n\nDuvvada Jagannadham\n\nThere’s always a buzz around an Allu Arjun film. The actor hasn’t put a foot wrong in recent times, with every film of his since 2014 turning out to be a blockbuster – from Race Gurram to Sarrainodu. Bunny, as he is fondly called, also managed to single-handedly lift Gunasekhar’s Rudhramadevi, despite playing an extended cameo in it. He played the iconic Gona Ganna Reddy and received widespread praise for his Telangana diction. Riding on the back a string of hits, Allu Arjun has now teamed up with Harish Shankar for a romantic-comedy flick Duvvada Jagannadham. Bunny plays the role of a devout Brahmin in the film. The film’s teaser released on February 23 and is the fastest teaser to cross 10 million views on YouTube. Featuring Pooja Hegde as the female lead, the film is slated to release on May 19.\n\nSambhavami\n\nAfter the disastrous Brahmotsavam, Mahesh Babu has a point to prove to his critics and is determined to bounce back. He couldn’t have chosen a better film to do it, as he’s teaming up with Ghajini helmer AR Murugadoss for his first bilingual project. There’s already a considerable buzz surrounding this spy thriller. There’s also a certain mystery involved with the film, and the filmmakers have kept everything related to the film under wraps. Sambhavami features Rakul Preet as the female lead and will release on June 23.\n\nBabu Baaga Busy\n\nIt’s not often that you get to see adult content in Telugu cinema, let alone sex comedies. Kumari 21F in 2015 had a tinge of boldness to it, but such films are far too few in mainstream Tollywood. Now, Bollywood sex-comedy Hunterrr is being remade in Telugu with Srinivas Avasarala in the lead. A story of a sex addict, Babu Baaga Busy’s trailer has already garnered interest among the viewers and piqued their curiosity. Directed by Naveen Medaram, Babu Baaga Busy also features Mishti Chakraborty, Sree Mukhi and Tejaswi Madivada in important roles. The film is slated to hit screens on April 7."
