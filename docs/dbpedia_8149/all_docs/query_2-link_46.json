        "text": "O Saathiya is a light-hearted romantic drama that was released on July 7, 2023. The film had Aryan Gowra and Mishti Chakraborty in the lead roles and was directed by Divya Bhavana on a very low budget. The film did not fare well at the box office and was out in no time from the theatres.\n\nThe film, with a story by Aryan and Deepu, is bankrolled by Chandana Katta under Thanvika Jashwika Creations. We at OTTplay had already reported that the digital rights of the film have been bagged by Prime Video for a fancy price. The makers struck a decent deal and ended in profits with this film.\n\nO Saathiya\n\nNow, the news is that the film has already started streaming on Prime Video from August 17, 2023 onwards. The film has a simple, straightforward story, revolving around the highs and the lows in the relationship between two college sweethearts. Mishti Chakraborty made a comeback to Telugu cinema after a long time and her performance was appreciated in the film.\n\nMovie Name O Saathiya Director Dviya Bhavana Star cast Aryan Gowra, Mishti Chakraborty OTT platform Amazon Prime OTT release date August 17, 2027\n\nThough director Divya Bhavana does a decent job of packaging all the commercial ingredients in the right measure, the film did not do much at the box office. Despite no significant conflict points in the story, O Saathiyaâ€™s strength lies in its first half which has been kept light-hearted and the second half focuses on emotions.\n\nThe supporting cast Devi Prasad, Pramodini Pammi, Kalpalatha, Annapurnamma, Appaji Ambarisha, and Sivannarayana play key roles in the film. EJ Venu is the cinematographer and his work was classy in the film. The romantic drama has some decent moments and if watched with patience it ends as a decent watch on OTT."
