Speaking about her South debut she said \"It's a romantic entertainer with a thriller element in it. When the script was narrated to me, I instantly gave my nod because I really liked it. Also, I have heard a lot about my co-star Nithiin. So, I'm pretty excited to work with him. We're set to start the shooting next month, Ask her if she would be learning Telugu for the film, and pat comes the reply, \"Definitely. Right now, I don't know if my voice would be dubbed by somebody else, but I would love to learn the language to get my dialogues and lip sync perfect.\" Speaking about her debut film she said \"Although Kaanchi is my debut film, I finished shooting for Rupali Guha's Bengali movie Porichoy first. The movie is yet to release. Later, the makers of Porichoy were in talks with Subhash sir and recommended my name. That's how I landed the film,\" reveals Mishti.\n\nFind out more:"
