        "text": "Ankita Lokhande Jain is a talented Indian actress who has made a significant mark in both the television and film industries. Hailing from a Marathi family, her parents, Shashikant Phadnis and Vandana Phadnis, have roots in the banking and teaching professions, respectively.\n\nAnkita's journey into the world of acting commenced in 2005 when she moved to Mumbai to pursue her passion. After completing her schooling and graduation in Indore, she enrolled in various dramatic activities during her college days, showcasing her early inclination towards acting. Alongside her acting endeavors, Ankita also displayed her skills as a badminton player.\n\nHer television career took off in 2006 when she participated in the talent hunt reality show Idea Zee Cinestar. However, it was her role as Archana in Ekta Kapoor's Pavitra Rishta that catapulted her to fame. Ankita's portrayal of two distinct characters in the show garnered immense popularity, earning her recognition as Archana, a name that resonated with viewers for nearly five years.\n\nIn 2011, Ankita showcased her versatility by participating in the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Season 4. The same year, she displayed her comedic side alongside Kapil Sharma in the reality show Comedy Circus. Further diversifying her portfolio, Ankita took on the role of Pragya in the mini-series 'Ek Thi Nayaka,' produced by Ekta Kapoor.\n\nIn 2018, Ankita transitioned from television to the big screen with her feature film debut as Jhalkaribai in \"Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi,\" released in January 2019. Her performance garnered praise, setting the stage for her subsequent appearance in Ahmed Khan's action film \"Baaghi 3,\" released in 2020.\n\nDespite facing challenges in securing movie roles initially, Ankita's perseverance paid off when she landed a significant role in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's big-budget film 'Padmavat.' While she declined the offer due to unpreparedness, she eventually found her breakthrough as Jhalkari Bai in \"Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi.\"\n\nAnkita's personal life drew public attention, especially her relationship with the late Sushant Singh Rajput. After their breakup in 2016, Ankita faced public scrutiny and lewd comments. However, her friend Vicky Jain provided unwavering support, and after the tragic death of Sushant Singh Rajput in 2020, Ankita continued to face criticism. Vicky stood by her side, responding to trolls and supporting her during challenging times.\n\nIn December 2021, Ankita Lokhande married Vicky Jain, a businessman, marking a new chapter in her life. As she continues to shine in the entertainment industry and embrace her journey in Bollywood, Ankita's fans eagerly anticipate her future projects, confident in her ability to leave an indelible mark on both the small and big screens."
