        "text": "Share\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nEmail\n\nAn exclusive chat with Karan Singh Grover\n\nYou were at the pinnacle of your TV career and extremely successful. Now you’ve entered Bollywood where you’ve had to start from scratch. How has that affected you psychologically?\n\nI really don’t know. With very project that I do, I put so much into it that I don’t really get time to think about things like this. Plus there are so many people who love me and support me relentlessly all the time. It does feel like a new beginning, but not like I was somewhere earlier and now I have to step back and do something else. I think the career path that I’ve taken is rising and with the decision that I’ve taken I think I’m doing a fairly good job.\n\nAre you scared of the competition?\n\nI feel that I only compete with myself. If I compare my current work with my previous work, I need to know that I’ve grown as an actor. I need to know that maybe there’s a part of me that the audience connects with more. So if that happens then I’m good. It’s not like I’m thinking that I’m competing with everyone else, I just need to be better than I was yesterday.\n\nDo you have any favourites in the industry?\n\nYes – Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan.\n\nWhat was working with Bipasha like?\n\nIt was excellent. She’s a very inspiring and encouraging person. I’m happy that I did my first film with her.\n\nDo you believe in ghosts?\n\nI do.\n\nHave you ever had any experiences so far that you would like to share?\n\nI don’t want to share. When I was a kid, I did. I told everyone but nobody believed me. I’ve decided not to speak about it ever again, it’s very disturbing.\n\nSo then what made you choose horror as the genre for your first film?\n\nYou know I’ve only started thinking about this when I’ve been asked. Earlier I wasn’t thinking of it as a horror film, I was thinking of it as a film that I’m doing, and the genre just happens to be horror. It’s such an intense love story that when you’re actually shooting for the film, the horror is only external. It’s about these people who love each other and there are paranormal things that are happening around for extremely dark reasons. So I never really thought of it like that. When I heard the script, I was thought this is a good film, I’ll do it.\n\nWhat do you think are the psychological effects of working in a horror movie?\n\nIt’s quite disturbing actually. I don’t know if it’s for everyone but as an actor when you’re doing a scene you need to get into the emotion of it. Normally in any other genre, what is happening in front of you is believable, because it’s really happening in front of you. In a genre like this when you are witnessing an exorcism, when the bed goes up and it’s flying and going round and round in front of your eyes – it’s actually happening because we use lots of stuff like ropes and special effects. So when you know that it’s fake, but it’s really happening in front of you, and you have to make a mental image of that particular thing happening, and you understand exactly what it is, once you’re done with the scene it stays in your mind – because you actually created it in your brain. That emotion and that whole thing happening will always stay with you. It’s very disturbing, I think Bipasha’s head must be filled with stuff like that (laughs).\n\nDo you have a wish list of directors you’d like to work with?\n\nI think I’m too early in my career to have any kind of wish list. I would want to work with anybody who’s making a good film. So it’s not like I would want to particularly work with one person. I’d like to work with anybody who has a good film whether they are successful yet or not.\n\nDo you have any dream role?\n\nI wish I could be Neo from The Matrix, And also Superman. Only if Christopher Nolan knew I existed… Maybe I’ll meet him. Superman’s supposed to be really tall, so that’s a problem. I can be Wolverine.\n\nYou’ve entered Bollywood at a time when it’s really changed. They’re making much better films now than they did earlier.\n\nYes. They understand that you’re watching a film not for one particular person or for the person who directed it – you’re watching it for the story. Now whoever puts it together, those people get appreciated more nowadays, which is a good thing because people are more in tune with the story.\n\nHow would you describe yourself?\n\nI’m free-spirited and a little crazy, perhaps even eccentric. I’m just somebody who likes to be happy and make people smile and laugh. Plus I go to the gym everyday but that’s not really me, that’s something I do.\n\nSo what’s next?\n\nHopefully doing another film or television mini-series if that comes up. I don’t know yet. I’ve signed a 3 film deal with Kumarji. They’re not three consecutive films but three films. So let’s see.\n\nDo you have any message for your fans?\n\nI would like to say thank you for all the love and support that you guys give me all the time; for my life, for my work, for everything. Also I don’t think that there’s any need for them to be so aggressive – we’re all growing. And I think that we all should grow up a little and not be aggressive towards anyone because that way if we spread negativity, only negativity will come back to us. If we spread positivity and fun stuff, then only those things will come in our lives.\n\nFor regular updates, visit our social media pages by clicking the options below:"
