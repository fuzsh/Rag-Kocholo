        "text": "Biography:\n\nMishti was born as Indrani Chakraborty in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, into a Bengali family On December 21. Her father is a construction company owner, while her mother, Beena Chakraborty, is a stay-at-home mom. She received her degree from the University of Calcutta in English literature. After 2014, she started using the name Mishti professionally.\n\nActress Indrani Chakraborty, often known by her stage name Mishti, is primarily seen in Telugu and Hindi motion pictures. Her acting credits include roles in movies like O Saathiya (2023), Burra Katha (2019), Brihaspathi (2018), Adam Joan (2017), Kaanchi: The Unbreakable (2014), and Chinnadana Nee Kosam (2014).\n\nShe debuted in Telugu cinema with Nithiin-A. Karunakaran’s Chinnadana Nee Kosam, in Bollywood with Subhash Ghai’s Kaanchi: The Unbreakable, and in Malayalam with Prithviraj Sukumaran and Jinu Abraham’s Adam Joan.\n\nColumbus, the upcoming Telugu film directed by Mishti and starring Sumanth Ashwin, is produced by MS Raju. The third movie in the Masti film series, Great Grand Masti, directed by Indra Kumar, marked her comeback to Bollywood.\n\nShe costarred with Naseeruddin Shah and Vidya Balan in the 2017 historical drama Begum Jaan, directed by Srijit Mukherji. She portrayed Shabnam in the movie, which had a brothel as its backdrop. The movie did mediocrely well at the Indian box office."
