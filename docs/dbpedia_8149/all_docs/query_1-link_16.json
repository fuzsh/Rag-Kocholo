If you design too much friction into the system, people find their own little workarounds.\" This week, our panel discusses the Developers Behaving Badly report from a data perspective. Our latest Test Case Scenario episode is available now on our channel. I hope you'll give it a watch! https://lnkd.in/eXpXCUMb\n\n🎃📊 Hey there, tech enthusiasts!

This session will provide users with the knowledge they need to start taking advantage of this platform today. We will explore how Anomaly Detection works, how to perform root cause analysis, and how to implement it in a practical way for any organization. https://lnkd.in/gVGpvasy\n\nI started a #30DaySQLChallenge with #Techavilly #Day1. THE QUESTION - Using The movie Data, Write a Query to show the Titles and Movies Released in 2017 whose Vote count is more than 15 and Run time is more than 100 THE QUERY - SELECT [title] FROM [sqlchallengeDATA].[dbo].[Movie Data] where [release_date] BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31' AND [vote_count] > 15 AND [runtime] > 100;\n\nThe answer to the riddle is... Corn! 🌽 Did you get it right? Whether you cracked the code or are just now having that 'aha' moment, we're curious to know your thoughts! Share your journey to the answer in the comments below. #fridayfun #brainteaser #feelgoodfriday\n\nHey LinkedIn fam! 👋 Just wrapped up another exhilarating project at the Doremon Den Data Analyst Camp, and excited to share it with you! 🎉 In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), an algorithm that acts like a matchmaking guru for data points, solving mysteries and making predictions. From classifying flowers in a garden to predicting house prices, KNN proved to be our trusty sidekick in unraveling data complexities. 🌸🏡 The presentation takes you on a fun-filled journey, explaining KNN in a relatable and detailed manner. Imagine it as finding your squad at a party – KNN helps data points find their closest companions in the dataset! 👥 What did I learn? KNN is like having a topper data buddy, guiding you through the chaos and making predictions one neighbor at a time. It's all about finding patterns, making connections! 🤓 Huge shoutout to the incredible mentors and fellow campers at Doremon Den, this project was a fantastic learning experience! 🙌 #40DaysOfData #DoremonDen #LearnInPublic #DataAnalysis\n\nLet’s face it. #DataAnalysis can be difficult and time consuming. To lessen the drain on resources and get to the benefits, Streamlit COO and Snowflake Product Director Amanda Kelly is cracking the code on the dynamics of #data teams inside organizations. She joins Sean Falconer and Software Engineering Daily to discuss all things data and how she has accelerated the iteration loop to go from question to data-driven answer. https://bit.ly/49c09Iy"
