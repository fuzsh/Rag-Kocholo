        "text": "Nanda Kishore’s upcoming film with Manoranjan gets a new title. It was earlier called VIP (Vrutti Illada Padavidara) now it will be S/o Ravichandran. Reason? The director says that the former title linked it to the Tamil version.\n\nManoranjan is the son of veteran actor Ravichandran, but what does that have to do with the movie? The senior actor is not a part of this project and Saikumar plays Manoranjan’s father in the movie. Nanda Kishore says, “Our film is not a remake, but is a retelling which incorporates local flavour. Our team, including technicians and artistes, have put in equal effort into its making… the audience will understand how the title is apt for the movie when they watch it.”\n\nThe director is headed to Mysuru today with his team, where the film’s patch work and montage song involving the hero and heroine will be shot over the next few days.\n\n“Audience will see a mass version of Manoranjan in S/o Ravichandran,” says the director, adding, “and from what I have seen at the edit desk, he has given his best for this role.”\n\nWhile S/o Ravichandran will be Manoranjan’s second film after Saheba, it marks Mishti Chakraborty’s debut in Kannada. She started her career in Bollywood with Kaanchi directed by Subhash Ghai. This film has Sitara playing Manoranjan’s mother, with Avinash, Sadhukokila, Prakash Belawadi and Thaarak Ponnappa playing important roles.\n\nS/o Ravichandran has music by V Harikrishna and cinematography by Sathya Hegde.\n\nMeanwhile, Nanda plans to have launch his next project Poguru with Dhruva Sarja on his birthday. “It will be a thorough entertainer and I will talk about it once I start the project,” he says.\n\nSong that explores mother-son bond is a highlight\n\nS/o Ravichandran, made under Rockline Productions hopes for a Deepavali release, and Nanda Kishore is planning for an audio release sometime in October. The song Appa I Love you from Chowka was Tarun Sudhir’s contribution to Kannada cinema. His brother Nanda Kishore has come up with a song that will explore the ‘mother and son sentiment’. The team says that it will be one of the album’s highlights. “There is also a song on Ravichandran himself, details of which will be revealed closer to the audio release date,” says Nanda."
