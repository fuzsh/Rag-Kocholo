        "text": "HYDERABAD: “I don’t want to be typecast and I don’t want to be a showpiece,” says new-comer Mishti Chakraborty. Debuting in Subhash Ghai’s Kaanchi where played the titular role of a woman fighting against oppression and power, Mishti had a good script to start with in the industry. The film though didn’t do well, with critics not sparing the actress as well. She’s now shifted focus to Tollywood and will be making an entry in actor Nithiin’s upcoming untitled film being directed by Karunakaran.\n\n“I’m a director’s artist. It is easier for me to follow what they say exactly. I want to do all kinds of roles and work with different directors and actors. However, every character that I do has to be substantial and should be important to the film,” shares Mishti. Although her screen debut was Kaanchi, she acted in the unreleased Bengali film Porichoy directed by Rupali Guha before taking up Ghai’s film. However, from Bengali cinema to Bollywood to down south here in Tollywood, Mishti doesn’t find any difference between the industries.\n\n“I won’t differentiate between industries as I feel every director has his own style and vision when he creates something, every director is different. Bollywood is a much bigger platform but otherwise filmmaking is the same everywhere.” Talking about her present film with Nithiin, she calls it a romantic thriller where her character is rather pivotal.\n\n“It’s a superb role in a feel good movie with elements of comedy and thrills in it. Nithiin is a very talented actor; although I hadn’t watched any of his films, I had heard a lot about him,” shares Mishti who is learning Telugu for the film.\n\n“Initially I was a bit scared (about learning the language), but then I found it very easy and fun to learn. People were actually surprised at how quickly I picked it up,” she comments.\n\nMishti got her break into the industry when she was spotted by a Bengali production house who saw her hoardings in Kolkata. “I was modelling for a while in college which is how they spotted me. It so happened that the assistant director of Porichoy, Arindam Ray, happened to be the chief assistant of Subhash Ghai and he showed some of my pictures to Subhash sir. They then called me to Mumbai and that’s how Kaanchi came to be,” recalls Mishti.\n\nEven though Kaanchi garnered mostly negative reactions, with critics panning the actress’s acting skills, she is undaunted. “For me I take every failure as a step towards success. I’m not a person who sulks and nothing in the world can make me sulk. Criticism in a way is good as it is given after some careful thought. I take it as motivation to improve myself,” she says positively.\n\nConsidering that her role in Kaanchi was that of a rustic beauty, Mishti didn’t particularly dress up like a glam girl. However, she says she is open to showing skin if the script demands it. “Why not? Everybody in my time is doing it. When I’m onscreen, I’m the character I play. So I don’t have a problem with it,” believes Mishti who will be shooting for the Telugu film for another month before leaving for Europe on her next shooting schedule.\n\n“I will be back next month again for shooting. But the time I have been here has made me realise that I feel very close to Hyderabad. In fact, I’m planning to get a property for myself here,” she tells us on a parting note."
