        "text": "Who is Mishti Mukherjee? All you need to know about the Indian actress who is believed to have died from The Keto Diet.\n\nMishti Mukherjee\\’s Death Controversy is all over the media right now. People are speculating over what has taken place and why.\n\nBollywood Actress Mishti Mukherjee, who worked in many films and music videos breathed her last on Friday night (October 2) in a hospital in Bengaluru. As per the media reports, the actress was suffering from kidney disease, which resulted in her untimely death.\n\nIndrani Chakraborty, known by her mononymous stage name Mishti, is Mishti\\’s next Telugu film, Columbus, stars Sumanth Ashwin, and is produced by MS Raju. She returned to Bollywood with Indra Kumar\\’s Great Grand Masti, the third film in the Masti film series.\n\nLearn More\n\nWhat\\’s The Media Saying About It\n\nThe Media reports and articles are constantly talking about Keto and it\\’s relation to the actress\\’s death. Calling Keto a High Protein diet and that being a reason for Kidney Failure and possible demise of Mishti, the articles have been aggressively focusing on bashing off the diet, instead of being sensitive towards an untimely death of a person.\n\nThe Beet mentions Keto being a \\”High Protein Diet\\” and it\\’s adverse effects on the dieters.\n\nhttps://thebeet.com/indian-actress-mishti-mukherjee-27-dies-of-kidney-failure-related-to-keto-diet/#:~:text=Indian%20actress%20Mishti%20Mukherjee%20died,a%20statement%20from%20her%20family.&text=Due%20to%20the%20keto%20diet,suffered%20a%20lot%20of%20pain.\n\nTimes Of India found quoting a Senior Dietician, Priya Sharma mentioning the diet being High on Protein Intake.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/actress-mishti-mukherjee-passes-away-due-to-kidney-failure-reports-cite-keto-diet-to-be-the-reason/articleshow/78474318.cms\n\nNews 18 was found mentioning about how the Keto Diet being high in proteins puts pressure on the kidneys and can lead to failure of the same.\n\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/buzz/keto-diet-is-suspected-to-be-the-reason-for-actress-mishti-mukherjees-death-how-safe-is-it-2934729.html\n\nNow, let us give you some clarity here. The Keto Diet isn\\’t a high protein diet. Shocked? If you have tried it or you know someone who has done it, you already know how the diet works. The foundation of these articles itself is a lie and a case of \\”Half Knowledge\\”.\n\nThe Standard version of Keto Diet is Moderate On Proteins, not high, so the basic allegations itself stand nowhere now. The protein consumption on a keto diet is 0.8 g to 1 g per kg of bodyweight of the dieter.\n\nThe ketogenic diet sources an average of 70-80% of energy from fats, 5-10% carbohydrate, and 10-20% protein.\n\nLearn More\n\nMost of us have heard about the Keto Diet. You may have either followed it or would have been recommended the same for weight loss or improved health. With immense popularity comes rumors and myths too, and Keto hasn\\’t faced any different scenario.\n\nFor instance, people are very quick to say, \\”Keto diet is not a healthy diet for a healthy individual, since it includes an extremely high percentage of fat and protein and a no amount of carbohydrates at all.\\” The problem? Keto isn\\’t a High Fat and High-Protein and No Carb Diet. It\\’s a High-Fat, Moderate-Protein, and a Low-Carb Diet.\n\nNow the best moral to take out from this instance would be, \\”The people who don\\’t even know the standard macro distribution of a diet, why should you believe their takes about that particular diet?\\”\n\nThe problem lies with \\”not knowing enough\\” or the famous saying, \\”Half Knowledge\\”. We come across different people from different cities every day and we can tell you one thing for sure, that 85% of the population don\\’t actually understand what the meaning of Keto Diet is.\n\nHere\\’s a video by Dr. Ken Berry, a family physician with over 20 years of clinical experience and one of the leading practitioners of the Keto Diet in the world. Dr. Berry is affiliated with Henry County Medical Center in Tennessee, US. He has an extremely popular youtube channel with over 1 Million Subscribers across the globe.\n\nDr. Berry is the author of the bestseller \\”Lies My Doctor Told Me\\” which exposes myths and misleading health advice from well-meaning doctors, such as avoiding fat. He himself embraces the Ketogenic diet and has come up with a video to detangle the Myths about Keto Diet\\’s effect on Kidney Function.\n\nCheck Out the Video Here:\n\nYou need to know the difference between Healthy and Fad Diets. And for that, you need to educate yourself with real facts. This is what we will be talking about here in this article, about the alleged risk of keto diet which is \\”Can Keto Lead To Kidney Failure?\\”.\n\nFirst, we’ll look at what our kidneys do and how they can get damaged.\n\nLearn More\n\nWhat Are Kidneys And What Is Their Function?\n\nYour kidneys are actually like a pair of bean-shaped organs on either side of your spine, below your ribs and behind your belly. Each of these kidneys is about 4 or 5 inches long, which is roughly the size of a large fist.\n\nThe kidneys act as very efficient filters for ridding the body of waste and toxic substances, and returning vitamins, amino acids, glucose, hormones, and other vital substances into the bloodstream. The kidneys receive high blood flow and this is filtered by very specialized blood vessels.\n\nAdding to this, consuming large quantities of salt: Diets high in sodium increase blood pressure levels. High blood pressure damages the kidneys over time and is a leading cause of kidney failure.\n\nKidneys can become damaged from a physical injury or because of other disorders too. And Kidney failure does not happen overnight. It is the end result of a gradual loss of kidney function.\n\nIn fact, some people do not even know they have kidney disease until their kidneys fail. Why not? Because people with early kidney disease may not have any symptoms. Symptoms usually show up late in the progression of the disease.\n\nHow To Know If You Have Kidney Issues?\n\nLook out for these signs and symptoms, and if you face any of them, consult with your doctor immediately.\n\nDecreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normal.\n\nFluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles, or feet.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nFatigue.\n\nConfusion.\n\nNausea.\n\nWeakness.\n\nIrregular heartbeat.\n\nOnce you begin treatment for kidney failure, your symptoms will improve and you will begin to feel much better.\n\nAnd because diabetes and high blood pressure cause more than two-thirds of all chronic kidney disease. Preventing, controlling, or reversing these two conditions with a low-carb diet may prevent the future development of kidney disease.\n\nResearches prove that the keto diet can improve diabetes and high blood pressure, which may prevent kidney damage caused by those diseases. But is there any concern that the diet itself might have its own impact on the functioning of healthy kidneys? Let\\’s talk about that!\n\nSince dietary fats have been unfairly demonized for the past few decades, some people are worried that keto may affect your internal organs, including your Kidneys. But how true is that? Let us closely look at it.\n\nLearn More\n\nSo Is The Keto Lifestyle Bad For Your Kidneys?\n\nMore than 40% of people are diagnosed with kidney failure in the world. This condition occurs when your kidneys can no longer properly eliminate waste. Developing kidney problems are a common concern for people who are just starting a low carb diet, thanks to two common myths:"
