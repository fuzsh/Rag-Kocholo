        "text": "The only thing constant about showbiz is change. In mainstream Bollywood, where glamour defines everything, the pretty face on the marquee has to be updated every few years. A fresh lot of heroines is all set to go over the next few months, backed by big banners and elaborate hype.\n\nComing soon on the big screen will be Pallavi Sharda, Vaani Kapoor, Sana Khan, Elli Avram and Mishti, to name a few. An industry that hardly reserves great roles for budding actresses to prove their acting skills will be rough terrain to negotiate.\n\nBut if these girls can mix the essential glam quotient with some screen presence, they will soon be gunning to challenge the queen bees.\n\nMainstream Bollywood over the past decade or so has been dominated by Katrina Kaif, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, with Deepika Padukone and Sonakshi Sinha making strong impact lately.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith the newbies demanding limelight space, the top girls will sooner or later have to redefine image if they want to survive.\n\n\"The new flock of actors look promising and very good,\" states trade expert Taran Adarsh. \" They could be here for a long innings but one should not compare them with top rung actresses right away. We must also remember that a successful first film does not make a debutant eligible to contest with those who have worked their way to the top over the years. Still, new talent definitely creates competition,\" adds Taran.\n\nIf you look at the emerging stock, you spot a pattern of repetition. Vaani Kapoor and Pallavi Sharda are in the oldschool mould, though contemporary in image, while Elli Avram is the latest foreign import in the wake of the Katrina Kaif effect. Sana Khan, like Priyanka Chopra or Bipasha Basu, comes from a modelling background.\n\nApart from the top heroines, the newcomers will also give tough competition to fairly new heroines such as Alia Bhatt, Esha Gupta, Sunny Leone, Huma Qureshi and Ileana D'Cruz, who made their debut last year.\n\nOut take\n\nIf these girls can mix the essential glam quotient with screen presence, they will be gunning to challenge the queen bees.\n\nVaani Kapoor will be seen in Shuddh Desi Romance\n\nWho's that girl:\n\nDelhi girl Vaani worked in the hospitality industry for a while. The leggy lass has also done some modelling. She has bagged a three- film deal with Yash Raj Films, producers of her debut film.\n\nUSP:\n\nVaani balances a Punjabi attitude with the free spirit of modernday youth, and director Maneesh Sharma wants to fully tap that interesting mix for his film.\n\nDebut film:\n\nShuddh Desi Romance will look at the sensitive subject of live- in relationships and commitment. Maneesh Sharma, director of Band Baaja Baaraat and Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl , has based his film in a smalltown set- up to trace a story of love and attraction featuring Sushant Singh Rajput and Parineeti Chopra along with Vaani. The film tries to understand the mindset of today's youth.\n\nElli Avram will be seen in Mickey Virus\n\nWho's that girl:\n\nElli hails from Greece and comes from a family of actors. Her mother Maria Granlund is notably a famous Swedish actress. For her Bollywood launch, Elli has taken formal training in dance form and Hindi pronunciation.\n\nUSP:\n\nElli is the latest addition to Bollywood's stock of foreign import beauties triggered by the success of Katrina Kaif. She should be a fresh option for directors looking at ultra- glam roles.\n\nDebut film:\n\nMickey Virus is a comedy thriller about hacking. The film marks the big screen debut of TV actor Manish Paul in the title role, and is directed by debutant filmmaker Saurabh Varma.\n\nMishti will be seen in Kaanchi\n\nWho's that girl:\n\nHailing from Kolkata, the light- eyed beauty made it as Subhash Ghai's new heroine auditioning among girls. Ghai, known to be quite the showman, has compared Mishti with Kajol.\n\nUSP:\n\nMishti plays the title role of Kaanchi, an innocent girl in a traditional love story. Her fresh face should add to the appeal.\n\nDebut film:\n\nKaanchi marks Subhash Ghai's return after a spate of flops and with a fresh star cast of Mishti opposite Karthik Tiwari. The love story set in picturesque locales also features Rishi Kapoor and Mithun Chakraborty.\n\nSana Khan will be seen in Salman Khan's next\n\nWho's that girl:\n\nSana started off modelling and has done roles and item numbers in Tamil and Telugu films. The Billo rani item dance in Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal brought her to notice, besides Bigg Boss 6 . Mentored by Salman Khan, she has had her share of controversies, including an undergarment ad- film that raised protests and recent allegations that she was involved in a kidnapping case.\n\nUSP:\n\nSana defines glamour. She obviously knows how to make news, going by her controversies in the past. Plus, being mentored by Salman draws industry interest.\n\nDebut film:\n\nSana's debut film opposite Salman has primarily made news for its title changes so far. The film, initially called Mental , was later named Jai Ho and the latest buzz suggests Salman is considering Azaad as the title. The hero- oriented action drama is a remake of Chiranjeevi's Telugu blockbuster Stalin .\n\nPallavi Sharda will be seen in Besharam\n\nWho's that girl:"
