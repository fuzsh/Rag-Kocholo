        "text": "Chinnadana Nee Kosam actress Mishti Chakravarty is returning to Telugu cinema with a film titled Anu. The film, a horror thriller, is bankrolled by Sundeep Gopisetty under Tejaswi Creative Works. Prashant Karthi and Karthik Raju play the male leads in the film that also features Aamani, Bheemineni Srinivasa Rap, Devi Prasad, Posani and others in important roles. Earlier this week, the makers have announced that the film's shoot has concluded. Commemorating Holi, a lyrical video from the film, Emaindi Emo, was launched as well.\n\nPrashant Karthi and Mishti\n\nAnu has music by Ghantasala Viswanath and veteran singer Udit Narayan had crooned for the song Emaindi Emo, shot amid picturesque locales featuring the leads Prashant Karthi and Mishti Chakravarty. The song, which has lyrics by composer Ghantasala Viswanath himself, elaborates on how the lead character's love interest has sweeped him off his feet and no words can do justice to what she's done to him. He's spellbound and his heart is no longer under his control, the lyrics suggest.\n\nThe other songs from Anu will be launched shortly. The makers plan to unveil the theatrical trailer in the coming days and say that the film will offer loads of entertainment and fun elements for elements within the horror space. Sundeep Gopisetty, besides production, is also the director of the film and has penned the story and the screenplay as well.\n\n\"Audiences have always accepted films with a strong story and screenplay and we're quite confident of the impact that Anu will leave behind. The film will resonate with viewers of all age groups. Bheemineni Srinivasa Rao, Devi Prasad play crucial roles in the film. Anu has shaped up very well and we'll also announce the release date in a while,\" the lead actor Prashant Karthi and team added. Mishti's last Telugu release was Burra Katha in 2019."
