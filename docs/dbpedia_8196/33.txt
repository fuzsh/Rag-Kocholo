BUCKFIELD â€” Irma E. Scheffel, 92, of Buckfield left this life to continue her journey with the love of her life, Ted ( Sonny ) Scheffel, who passed in 2002, on Saturday, June 9, peacefully at her home. She was born in Mannheim, Germany, and had traveled to America on a war bride plane in 1948, marrying Sonny in December of that same year.

Together, they lived in New York and raised three children, Christy, Deirdre and Jimmy. They moved to Buckfield in 1978. She loved working on the land side-by-side with Sonny, traveling and doing crafts. She loved having her grandchildren around her as well. She belonged to and loved the Buckfield Literary Club for many years. She will be deeply missed by many.
