Obituary for Richard Donald Olson

Richard D. "Dick" "Dixie" Olson, age 88, of Austin, passed away on Wednesday, April 13, 2016, just shy of his 89th birthday.

Richard was a lifelong resident of Austin and attended Austin High School (Class of 1945). He enlisted in the Navy during World War II where he served in the Pacific Theatre and participated in the first atomic bomb experiment. He married his wife of 67 years, Helen, in 1948 and returned to Austin to begin his family and his lifelong employment with the Milwaukee Railroad where he retired after 30 years of service.

Richard enjoyed hunting and fishing, as much for the chance to be with friends as for the sport itself. He was also an avid auction participant, as his collection of antique clocks and furniture will attest to.

Survivors include his loving wife, Helen; son, Rick (Lynda) Olson; daughters, Stasia (Tony) Nelson, Peggy (Rick) Pelzl; son, Eddie Olson; 13 grandchildren; four great grandchildren.

The family's heart felt gratitude goes out to Hospice and St. Mark's in Austin for their tender loving care at the end.
