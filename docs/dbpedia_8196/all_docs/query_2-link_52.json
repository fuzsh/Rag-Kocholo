Ringham, 69, of Garner passed away Tuesday, January 31, 2023, at Iowa Lutheran Hospital in Des Moines.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 10:00 a.m., Saturday, February 4, 2023, at the Britt Evangelical Free Church with Pastor Steve Couch officiating. Burial will be at Concord Township Cemetery in Garner.\n\nVisitation will be held from 5 to 7 p.m., Friday, February 3, 2023, at the Britt Evangelical Free Church and will continue one hour prior to services at the church.\n\nMichael John Ringham was born in Mason City on July 11, 1953, to Mame Ringham. He attended Mason City High School, graduating in 1972. He met the love of his life, Linda Cropley, working at Guardian Photo in Mason City where he delivered film. They married on June 5, 1982, and were blessed with two children, Patricia (1984) and later John (1992). Mike attended NIACC and received his AA degree in electronics. Over his life, he held many interesting jobs that he enjoyed, including working with Linda at Unisys, repairing electronics for others, working at Kraft Foods for over 17 years, the Garner Elementary School where he loved talking and interacting with children and most recently the Garner Kwik Star, where he loved greeting everyone with a smile and a friendly hello. Throughout his life, Mike was an avid sports fan. He enjoyed bowling and participated in several bowling leagues. He attended many Minnesota Twins games with his family and grandkids and collected bobbleheads with John. He was a faithful fan of the Minnesota Vikings. In addition, he was a big fan of WWE wrestling and both DC and Marvel comic book characters. Mike loved putting together puzzles and model cars. He recently donated his entire car collection, of over 50 years, to the Britt Car Show to be given out to children to enjoy. He loved to watch all things Star Trek, and “Live Long and Prosper” was a familiar statement at home. Mike was a huge sci-fi fan and loved going to movies with his kids. He volunteered at school for the RSVP mentorship program and was an AWANA listener at the Britt Evangelical Free Church. He also enjoyed playing cards and going out to eat with family and friends.\n\nMike is survived by his wife of 40 years, Linda of Garner; daughter, Patricia (Benjamin) Bentley of Mankato, MN; son, John Ringham of Garner; five grandchildren, Taryan Barrick-Wessels, Caleb Bentley, Mason Barrick, Addison Barrick and Rasul Bentley; sisters, Lori (Kent) Beatty of Mason City and Debra Ringham of Mason City; sister-in-law, Janice (Dean) Bertilson of Garner; brothers-in-law, Steve Cropley of Sheridan, WY, Stuart Cropley of Chatsworth, CA, Laurence Cropley (Amy Roberts) of Sylmar, CA and John Cropley of North Hollywood, CA; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his second mom and mother-in-law, LaVonne Cropley; his mother, Mame Ringham; his father, LaVerne Scheffel; and stepfather, Raymond RIngham."
