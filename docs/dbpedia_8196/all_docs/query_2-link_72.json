        "text": "BUCKFIELD — Irma E. Scheffel, 92, of Buckfield left this life to continue her journey with the love of her life, Ted ( Sonny ) Scheffel, who passed in 2002, on Saturday, June 9, peacefully at her home. She was born in Mannheim, Germany, and had traveled to America on a war bride plane in 1948, marrying Sonny in December of that same year.\n\nTogether, they lived in New York and raised three children, Christy, Deirdre and Jimmy. They moved to Buckfield in 1978. She loved working on the land side-by-side with Sonny, traveling and doing crafts. She loved having her grandchildren around her as well. She belonged to and loved the Buckfield Literary Club for many years. She will be deeply missed by many.\n\nIrma is survived by her three children, Christa Tuccillo and her husband, John, of New York, Deirdre Newton and her husband, Michael, of Buckfield and James Scheffel of Florida. She also leaves behind her grandchildren Lynne Tuccillo, Tom Zielinski, Jodi Theriault, Torri Kipula, Stephanie Rollando, Nick Zielinski, Sherwood Scheffel, Mike Tuccillo and John Mike Newton; as well as her 15 great-grandchildren.\n\nAlong with her beloved husband, she was predeceased by her brother, Karl Halter.\n\nCondolences may be shared with her family at www.thefortingroupauburn.com.\n\nIrma E.
