        "text": "Biography\n\nClaire Scheffel first joined the senior national program in 2021 and made her debut at the World Aquatics Championships in 2022, She had initially been listed as an alternate, but ended up competing after a teammate was injured just a few hours before the competition began. She went on to compete at the 2023 and 2024 World Aquatics Championships. At the latter, she competed in all three team routines as Canada qualified a full team for Paris 2024.\n\nScheffel helped Canada win team bronze at the Santiago 2023 Pan American Games. At the World Aquatics Artistic Swimming World Cup held in Markham, Ontario in June 2024, Priddell helped Canada win medals in all three team events (team technical silver, team free silver, team acrobatic bronze). That followed a silver medal in the team free at the World Cup in Paris in early May that served as the Olympic test event of the Aquatics Centre for Paris 2024. Scheffel previously helped Canada win team acrobatic silver and team free bronze at the 2023 World Cup Super Final.\n\nScheffel competed internationally for the first time at age 14 at the UANA Pan American Championships where she won the figures, duet, and team events.\n\nA Little More About Claire"
