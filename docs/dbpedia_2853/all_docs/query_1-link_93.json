He was also the only person to have worked with all six of the Stooges.\n\n[on working with Curly Howard in Half-Wits Holiday (1946), Howard's final film with The Three Stooges after suffering a major stroke that debilitated him] After [the stroke] occurred, Curly was just missing all of a sudden. It wasn't announced to the rest of the cast; nobody knew what happened. So, we're approaching the last scene in the picture, a big pie fight. They had a big set and they put a huge canvas all around; it was going to be like a battleground. They're getting all geared up and the script calls for all the Stooges. I see a dry run-through of the scene and there's no Curly. I thought it was just a change in the script. No one--including Moe [Moe Howard], Larry [Larry Fine] and Jules [producer Jules White]--ever told us how serious his condition was. It was only after the picture had been completed that I found out he took ill."
