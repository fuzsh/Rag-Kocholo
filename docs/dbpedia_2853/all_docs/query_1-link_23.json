Contact us for more details!\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nWe have new information for sweet Emil born June of 2017 and who is diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy and sever mental and physical delay. Our Bulgarian staff visited Emil and obtained the new information and photos November of 2023. They wrote the following:\n\nEmil reacts when spoken to in a flattering tone, not to the words, but to the tone. The staff thinks he does not understand the words. He coos. During the day, he plays with toys, mainly musical ones that make sounds. He likes to listen to nursery rhymes. Follows bright light â€“ such as Christmas lights. He does not pay attention and does not follow the TV. He has a sense of rhythm, he is tactful â€“ you can see it in the video. He loves all kinds of sounds â€“ listening to and making sounds.\n\nAlthough Emil can eat from a spoon, he doesnâ€™t like it. That is why the staff feed him with a pacifier. He is capricious when eating â€“ he eats common pureed food. He prefers juice over water. He likes sweets foods and soups. He doesnâ€™t like peas and cabbage. He often has constipation. When he doesnâ€™t like a food, he doesnâ€™t open his mouth, turns his head around.\n\nEmil works with a rehabilitator two to three times a week. At admission to the center from the baby home, he was only lying down, but now he can be in a sitting position and stays seated for a long time. The right hand is spastic and therefore he mainly uses the left one. When they leave him on the ground, he turns from his back to his stomach and vice versa. They try to leave him sitting up as much as possible instead of lying down.\n\nHe doesnâ€™t take any prescribed medications. He doesnâ€™t like to have his hair washed â€“ he grumbles. He doesnâ€™t get sick often and easily gets over colds.\n\nEmil has no specific regime. At night, he does not always sleep through the night â€“ sometimes he wakes up, coos and then falls asleep.\n\nIn general, he has a positive emotional tone and is in a good mood, but sometimes he gets angry â€“ he has a character ðŸ™‚ There is no aggression and auto-aggression. He accepts other children but does not interact with them. When he is in pain or when something is wrong with him, he signals by crying. He seeks attention. He recognizes staff voices.\n\nSince Emil came to the center, there has been progress, especially in the motor skills â€“ he is now sitting up on his own. He needs more work with a physical therapist. They think he can start standing up if he works harder with a physical therapist.\n\nPersonal impressions:\n\nEmil is an extremely sweet little boy who needs love and personal attention. He can for sure advance more if he works with different specialists. He is calm and most of the time entertains himself but also loves personal attention and looks for it. I pray that this boy finds his forever family soon.
