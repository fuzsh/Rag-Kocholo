        "text": "Emil Zatopek, who has died aged 78, was one of the outstanding athletes of the 20th century. In the years following the second world war, he lifted distance running to a new plane, dominating the discipline to a degree achieved only by Paavo Nurmi before him, while at the same time enjoying the awe, respect and affection of his opponents and a popular acclaim that has rarely been matched.\n\nFrom the week he won his first Olympic title in London in 1948 till his last major race in Melbourne in 1956, he was the most instantly recognisable figure in world sport, sending the back-page colour writers deep into their simile banks as they struggled to describe his tortured running style. He ran \"like a man who had been stabbed in the heart\", \"as if his next step would be his last\", \"like a man wrestling with an octopus on a conveyor belt\". Yet when the races were won and the head stopped rolling, a very different Zatopek emerged - a relaxed, gregarious figure with a captivating boyish smile, an aptitude for languages and an infectious enthusiasm for his sport.\n\nAnd he sealed his place in history over eight unforgettable days at the Helsinki Olympic Games of 1952, when he achieved the unprecedented (and since unequalled) feat of winning gold medals in all three classic tests of endurance running - the 5,000 metres, the 10,000 metres and the marathon.\n\nZatopek was born in Koprivnice, in Moravia, the son of a Czech carpenter who had little interest in the boy's passion for running. Away from home, too, the occupying Nazi authorities positively discouraged organised sport; but running tracks were not closed, and in the early 1940s in the town of Zlin, where he worked in the Bata shoe factory, the young Zatopek began to progress slowly in the 1,500 metres.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, by now drafted into the Czechoslovak army, he watched the great Swedish miler Arne Andersson compete in an invitation race in Prague. Andersson's physical condition, and an insight into the Swede's heavy background training, revolutionised Zatopek's own running. He had already trained long; now he trained hard.\n\nHe stretched his body and stamina to the limits: on sentry duty he might spend an hour running on the spot, knees high, shoulders straight; in winter, when saner athletes gratefully took time off from training, he would put on heavy baseball shoes, or even army boots, and run through the snow-covered forests, sometimes bounding in long, looping strides for two or three minutes at a stretch.\n\nIt was a self-taught and self-imposed regime, which took no account of the niceties of style. But the hours of relentless self-punishment gave him the capacity for sustained speed and the priceless bonus of a reserve tank of energy that would eventually allow him to run flat out for a lap, even at the end of a long, draining race.\n\nIn 1946 he was selected for the 5,000 metres in the European championships in Oslo, an unspectacular but promising debut on the big stage which saw him take fifth place behind another runner with a celebrated storming finish, Britain's Sydney Wooderson.\n\nTwo years later, in the build-up to the London Olympic Games of 1948, Zatopek's capacity for consistent, high-speed lapping had brought him noteworthy times in a number of invitation races, but the first track final of the Games, the 10,000 metres, was considered the bailiwick of the Finns (they had won five of the last six Olympic finals), and in particular of Viljo Heino, the current world record holder.\n\nNo one, certainly not Heino, had been prepared for Zatopek. He took over the lead from the Finn in the 10th of the 25 laps, and five circuits later unleashed a spurt that took him 10 metres clear. Heino simply ground to a halt. Zatopek ran on, unchallenged, as if the devil were at his heels, shoulders hunched, head rolling, face contorted in apparent agony, to the insistent chant of \"Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek\" from his compatriots in the crowd, and won by three-quarters of a lap. It was the first track-and-field gold medal ever won by Czechoslovakia.\n\nNext day he ran the 5,000 metres heats, and lined up for the final two days after that. For 10 laps of the race, through one of London's midsummer downpours, he shared the lead with the Belgian Gaston Reiff and the Dutchman Willem Slijkhuis. Then, either the fatigue finally hit him or he simply lost concentration; he fell hopelessly off the pace and Reiff accelerated for home. On the penultimate bend Reiff was leading by a good 20 metres from Slijkhuis, with Zatopek a further 25 metres back, splashing doggedly through the puddles in Wembley's red cinder track, apparently without a chance.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to wake up, and began a frantic last-ditch sprint. Within 150 metres he had gobbled up Slijkhuis, and in the final straight he closed on Reiff, who was alerted to the danger only when the crowd's roar became hysterical. Reiff lunged desperately for the tape and won by a couple of feet; if the race had been 10 metres longer, Zatopek would have beaten him.\n\nCzechoslovakia had found a national hero, and life could hardly have been better. A few weeks after the Games he married the national javelin champion Dana Ingrova (who, by the most bizarre of coincidences, had been born on the same day as he had) - a stable and happy partnership which visibly sustained both of them in the public years as sporting celebrities, and by all accounts made life a lot more tolerable when, in later life, they fell foul of the Czechoslovak political system. She survives him: they had no children.\n\nFor the next three years Zatopek was the undisputed master. From 1949 to 1951 he competed in 69 long-distance races (a schedule that would be simply unthinkable for any elite runner today) and won every one of them. From his first race at 10,000 metres in 1948 to his 38th in 1954 he was unbeaten at the distance. He won the European 10,000 metres championship in Brussels in 1950 by a full lap, and the 5,000 metres by 23 seconds. He broke 18 world records at distances from 5,000 metres to 30 kilometres, and in 1951 he became the first man to run 20 kilometres in under an hour. He was, in short, a phenomenon.\n\nExpectations for success at Helsinki in 1952 were naturally high, but the pressures on him mounted as the Games approached. He had run with a virus at a minor domestic meeting six weeks earlier, and became ill; he recovered, but the slow times in his build-up races were worrying. He also had his first serious brush with the communist authorities in Prague, when a young 1,500 metres runner, Stanislav Jungwirth, was dropped from the Czech Olympic team because his father had been jailed for political offences; Zatopek even threatened to pull out of the Games himself unless Jungwirth were reinstated, and the brinkmanship was successful, though hardly an aid to concentration.\n\nThen there were reports, which he refused to confirm, that he might be persuaded to run the marathon rather than - or, conceivably, as well as - the 5,000 metres.\n\nFurthermore, he was in Finland, the land of Kolehmainen and Nurmi, where for the last 40 years distance running had been meat, drink, mother's milk and a second religion; every step he took would be under the scrutiny of the most knowledgeable athletics audience in the world.\n\nOn the first Sunday he took the 10,000 metres gold medal more or less as he pleased, shaking off his opponents one by one with his unwavering pace to win by the length of the straight. On the Tuesday he was visibly relaxed, and came close to clowning his way through the 5,000 metres heats, dropping back down the field, cajoling and pacing lesser runners to qualification once the stragglers had been dropped. Two days later the Olympic stadium was full to bursting, with more than 66,000 spectators for the most eagerly awaited single event of the Games, the 5,000 metres final.\n\nThe pace was fast, and no one had the courage to make a decisive break until, well into the final lap, Zatopek accelerated into the lead. In any race during the previous four years, that would have been decisive: if Zatopek led in the final lap, Zatopek won the race. But after a few strides in front he experienced something that had never happened to him in his career before, and which would have devastated a lesser spirit: with 300 metres to go, three men charged past him - the red-headed Christopher Chataway of Great Britain; the bespectacled Herbert Schade of Germany, who had been widely tipped to win the race; and the French-Algerian Alain Mimoun, who had followed Zatopek home in the 10,000 metres. Zatopek was left floundering in fourth place, seemingly outpaced and out of the medals.\n\nOn the final bend, Chataway - who was to fall a few strides later - began to tire, Schade moved up to his shoulder, Mimoun pulled out to take them both on the outside... and Zatopek pounced. With 150 metres to go, there were four men abreast on the crown of the bend, and the one in the red vest way out in lane two, his head rolling in agony, was going fastest of all; from that moment there was no question as to who was going to win.\n\nDana clinched the day's second gold medal for the family by throwing an Olympic record in the first round of the javelin to beat a powerful Russian trio into second, third and fourth places, and Emil, joking that a 2-1 score in the family gold count was too close for comfort, confirmed that he would indeed run in the marathon - the first of his life - the following Sunday.\n\nThe story of the Helsinki marathon has entered legend: how Zatopek introduced himself to the favourite, Jim Peters of Great Britain, at the start, and ran with him for the first hour; how - in a genuine search for information rather than a masterly piece of gamesmanship - he asked Peters if the pace was quick enough and, somewhat to his surprise, received the answer \"No, too slow\"; and how he left Peters and all the other leaders behind him and drew steadily away. As he entered the stadium a full two-and-a-half minutes clear of the field, the expectant buzz exploded into a single welcoming roar, and wave upon wave of cheering rang out across the Helsinki rooftops as he completed the last 300 metres to win his third gold medal in eight momentous days.\n\nHis career did not end in Helsinki; two years later he regained his European 10,000 metres title in Berne, but in the 5,000 metres he was beaten into third place by an even more hard-bitten, more relentless and infinitely less appealing competitor, the Ukrainian Vladimir Kuts, who was to assume Zatopek's mantle and win both long-distance track events for the Soviet Union at the Melbourne Games in 1956.\n\nZatopek was at Melbourne to defend his marathon title, but he was hardly in the best shape to tackle it: one of his more outlandish training sessions, which involved running while carrying Dana on his shoulders, had resulted in a bad strain that had only just cleared up in time. He was never seriously in medal contention, but he trotted home in sixth place without seeming unduly bothered, only to break out in smiles and handshakes and hugs of congratulation when he realised that the winner was Alain Mimoun, the old adversary he had beaten in so many championships in the past.\n\nHe retired a national icon and a natural sporting ambassador for Czechoslovakia. He rose steadily to the rank of colonel in the Czech army, gave unstinting advice during coaching visits abroad, and unostentatiously enjoyed the resulting privileges at home. Until 1968 and the Prague Spring, when he publicly welcomed the shift towards democracy promised by the Dubcek regime, and roundly condemned the Soviet response as troops moved into Prague to re-establish communist control.\n\nHe was expelled from the Communist party and dismissed from the army. He was consigned to a series of manual jobs for various state departments until, after seven years of this ritual humiliation, he was given a desk at the Ministry of Sport, employing his language skills to monitor and translate sports periodicals from the west.\n\nOccasionally he was put on display at official receptions for visiting teams, when he would be seized upon by foreign journalists more eager just to shake his hand than to record the guarded answers he was obliged to give them. And towards the end of the 1980s, with the ice beginning to thaw and Zatopek long retired from the ministry, he would once in a while receive grudging permission to accept an invitation to an athletics event abroad. Invariably he would find himself at the centre of a crowd of foreigners who knew the face only from old newspapers or grainy archive film, but who had fallen under the spell of the legend; they would flock round him in unashamed awe, proffering scraps of paper for his autograph, hardly daring to offer a handshake in case it might be refused. It never was.\n\nZatopek's achievements in athletics are indelible, but bare statistics cannot reflect the genuine affection in which he was held by his fellow competitors, men with whom he chatted and joked as he ran them into the ground, men with whom he would willingly and honestly discuss race tactics even if he were due to run against them the next day, men whose insecurities and disappointments he could sympathise with and understand.\n\nLate in 1968 another high-achieving record-breaker, the Australian Ron Clarke, left the Mexico City Olympic Games in deepest gloom: he had been the fastest long-distance runner in the world for a decade, yet in two Olympic Games fate, ill-judgment, altitude, or sheer bad luck had conspired against him, and his career was slipping away without a single gold medal to show for it. On his way home he stopped off in Prague to chat things over with his boyhood idol and long-time friend.\n\nAs they parted Zatopek gave the Australian a small parcel, and not wishing to embarrass his host, Clarke did not unwrap it until he was on the plane. It was one of Zatopek's Olympic gold medals, a gift from an athlete who had gloriously won four of them to a fellow athlete he just felt deserved one."
