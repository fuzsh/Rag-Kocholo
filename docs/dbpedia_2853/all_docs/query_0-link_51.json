        "text": "Santa Rita Jail based in Dublin, Calif., has the highest number of in-custody deaths in the Bay Area, and has an even higher jail death rate than Los Angeles County, which has the largest jail system in the country.\n\nIn 2019, KTVU took an unprecedented look at who was dying and why at the jail by reviewing dozens of autopsies, police reports, lawsuits and conducting interviews. The analysis concluded that a disproportionally high number of people were put into isolation and then dying by suicide. The conclusion was that putting mentally fragile people into solitary confinement often led to deadly results. More recently, a large portion of the in-custody deaths are a result of medical inattention and drug overdose.\n\nA federal consent decree over the jail in February 2022 mandated many changes at the jail regarding how mental illness is treated and how much time a person is allowed out of their cell. The results of this consent decree remain to be seen.\n\nKTVU continues to track every death at Santa Rita and as of March 2023, 69 people have died there since 2014. (This list was last updated on Feb. 9, 2024)\n\nBelow are the stories behind many of these deaths.\n\nSanta Rita has a higher jail death rate than Los Angeles\n\nHere is a look at the people who died:\n\n2014: 10 DEATHS\n\nName: Lawrence Edward Baslee Jr.\n\nAge: 56\n\nArrested: 1/23/2014.

KTVU was not able to verify this claim.\n\nOn the day he died, she said her son was having a \"bipolar high. He was manic. He was yelling he didn’t do anything,\" she said. She is questioning why he would have methadone in his system, a medication used to treat drug addiction. She said her son did not use heroin, which is often what methadone is used for. \"They killed him,\" she said.\n\n\"He died all alone,\" Gonzales said. \"And that just breaks my heart. I want to believe Jesus was there with him.\"\n\nAccording to the autopsy report, on the day he died, deputies were passing out lunches and when he opened \"the cuffing port\" ‘on Cell 13, noticed that Laventure was not breathing. CPR did not work to revive him. One inmate said he never heard Laventure making noise from his cell and never caused any issues while out for recreational time. He was described by a deputy has having a calm demeanor. He told another deputy that he was back in jail because of a \"bogus warrant\" and he would get \"revenge\" for being arrested. He planned to \"rob everyone he could\" when he was released, a deputy wrote. On Oct. 30, Sgt. K. Gemmell requested a press hold on this case. Nearly four months later, on Feb. 13, the press hold was removed.\n\nEdwin Villalta was being \"punished\" for his mental health issues, and deputies thought he was \"hostile,\" when he really needed help, his sister Jennifer said.\n\nName: Edwin Alexander Villalta\n\nAge: 29\n\nArrested: 11/10/2017 for allegedly attacking police officers in Fremont. Police said Villalta tried to take a gun from one of the officers and steal a nearby car after he was involved in a car crash. He was facing charges of obstruction and resisting arrest.\n\nTotal time in jail: 18 days\n\nOccupation: Marine\n\nRace: Latino\n\nCause of death: Suicide by hanging\n\nInvestigative agency: Alameda County Sheriff/Shawn Sobrero\n\nIsolation: Yes. Administrative Segregation, housed alone in a two-man cell, Housing Unit 1, Cell D-9.\n\nHealth and/or mental issues: Yes, but redacted. Autopsy shows he had congested lung, liver, spleen and kidneys. He had a medical armband for some kind of issue.\n\nDrug issues: None in his system\n\nRestraints: The coroner’s report stated that Villalta resisted in arrest \"which resulted in force being used\" to take him into custody. He sustained facial injuries while being restrained.\n\nNarrative: About 2:30 a.m., a deputy saw Villalta sitting along on his bunk. At 2:56 a.m., the deputy found him hanging by his neck, secured to the upper bunk. It appears he had left some sort of suicide note, which was redacted. He had no physical contact with other inmates. An inmate said that Villalta was depressed because his court case was not going well and his family stopped contacting him.\n\nHis sister, Jennifer, told KTVU that last part is not true. Her father had just visited her brother in jail and her mother was poised to visit him on the day she died. Instead, her mother's visit was \"canceled,\" and she ended up finding out her son was dead.\n\nJennifer said her brother's phone card wasn't working and he wasn't getting the medication he needed. She said that he was being \"punished\" for his mental health issues, and deputies thought he was \"hostile,\" when he really needed help.\n\n\"He had just told us that he wanted to get his life together,\" she said.\n\nShe said his anxiety and PTSD started after he left his career as a Marine for five years, where he was a computer avionics technician. She showed KTVU his honors, which included the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons and other letters of appreciation.\n\nWhen he left that about 2013, she said he had been working for a private airline contractor.\n\nDeputies are supposed to perform a security check on every inmate in the unit at least once every 30 minutes. There was a press hold on his death, which was lifted on Dec. 24., nearly one month later.\n\nVillalta was not on intensive observation log, a jail protocol for people demonstrating behavioral problems or who could be suicidal, according to a federal lawsuit.\n\nHis cell window was obstructed by a piece of cardboard making it \"impossible\" for the deputy to see inside.\n\n2018: 5 DEATHS\n\n\"I know deep down inside that they did something to him,\" Paul Lee's sister said.\n\nName: Paul Wilbert Lee (*The sheriff disputes that Lee died in Santa Rita custody. However, an autopsy provided by the family shows he was having medical problems in a cell and suffered a heart attack on the sheriff's bus.

He was taken to ValleyCare Medical Center for three days and then to Stanford, and then to ValleyCare and then to Kindred Hospital in San Leandro, where he died about two months after his cardiac arrest. His sister, Tanasha Lee, said family didn’t even get a call about her brother’s hospitalization until three days after he was taken there.\n\nShe also sent KTVU pictures of her brother in the hospital. \"I know deep down inside that they did something to him,\" she said. \"My brother never had any seizures a day in his life and as you can see the photo show that he did have a big gash in the back of his head that led him to have those severe seizures.\"\n\nShe added: \"Ever since my brother passed away, my life has not been the same. I haven’t been getting any sleep. I break down and cry every day. I know we don’t never supposed to question the Lord, but I just keep putting my faith in praying that we get justice for my brother.\"\n\nThe sheriff wrote in his report that the Lee family initially flagged the death as suspicious \"due to family making a false report\" about the nature of his death.\n\nName: Gino Dalbianco\n\nAge: 58\n\nArrested: 2/1/2018\n\nDate of death: 3/28/2018\n\nTotal time in jail: 56 days in jail\n\nOccupation: Veteran\n\nRace: White\n\nCause of death: Natural.

Masterson repeatedly asked for mental health care while he was alone in the segregated cell, but his requests were ignored. Jail staff were supposed to check on him by visual observation once every half hour, but that did not happen, a federal lawsuit alleges. \"There is a significant problem with Santa Rita and the way that they’re providing for inmates,\" said Elise Sanguinetti, the family’s attorney, wrote in her suit, filed in March. \"When (Masterson) was put into custody they knew he was suicidal. And they took him off suicide watch anyway. Within a very short period of time he was found dead.\" Masterson had a wife and an ex-wife and family in San Joaquin County. He lived in Stockton.\n\nName: Jesus Dametrius Dickey\n\nAge: 45\n\nArrested: 4/23/2018 Arrested by Berkeley police in connection with a sexual battery report at student housing in the 2600 block of Durant Avenue, and an incident about two hours later in the 2500 block of Durant. Jail records list the second crime as false imprisonment with violence and burglary. He was arrested in People’s Park after authorities said he grabbed a student’s buttock, then later forced his way inside another woman’s apartment building and held her captive with sexual intent.

Death by asphyxiation along with cardiac hypertrophy and obesity. Dr. Michael Ferenc, who performed the autopsy, noted the restraints were so tight that it exacerbated conditions. \"The clinching straps of ‘The Wrap’ were tightened such that his torso was bent...compressing his obese abdomen...Finally, an opaque spit mask covered his face, including his nose and mouth. In my opinion, each (of) these factors increased this gentleman’s risk for asphyxia,\" Ferenc wrote. Armstrong was in the WRAP for eight minutes.\n\nInvestigative agency: Alameda County Sheriff/Shawn Sobrero\n\nIsolation: No. Cell SC-4 (sobering cell)\n\nHealth and/or mental issues: Armstrong answered \"no\" at intake. Dr. Michael Ferenc noted Armstrong weighed 266 pounds and had pulmonary congestion and cardiac hyperthrophy. He had cocaine metabolite in his system, but no cocaine or ethyl alcohol. He also had THC in his system.\n\nDrug issues: According to DA’s report, he self-reported using drugs over the phone to a woman, which was recorded. Later, he told a deputy he was high and believed he had gotten a \"bad dose of powder,\" which is common for cocaine. The coroner’s report said he tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and meth.\n\nRestraints: Yes, WRAP and spit mask. Also, deputies delivered \" a few knee strikes and foot kicks\" after they said Armstrong was kicking.\n\nNarrative: Armstrong had appeared for his second consecutive weekend in the jail inmate program. He had four months left to serve. The day after he arrived, he started to display \"unusual behavior,\" and he told deputies he was high on drugs. He was taken to the jail’s outpatient housing unit where he could get more medical care. Deputies said they cuffed Armstrong and he became combative. There was a struggle and he was placed in a WRAP. At first, a nurse said he was fine. Shortly after, he had no pulse. He died later than night. There are 66 body camera video files that exist as well as fixed video from the jail, which have not been released. Aftter his death, the jail no longer uses WRAPs, although sheriff's patrols still do.\n\nArmstrong was a father and lived with his mother in Oakland. There is still a press hold on the coroner’s report. This information comes from the Alameda County District Attorney, who found no criminal wrongdoing. There have been several community protests over his death, led by his mother. A documentary was also made about his death.\n\n2019: 10 DEATHS\n\nName: Cesar Augusto Pajuelo\n\nAge: 70\n\nArrested: 2/9/2019.

Stefano had been booked March 6 on suspicion of auto theft and possession of a stolen vehicle.\n\nMichael Hermon, 47, Gulf War veteran with a PhD in philosophy died after being punched at Santa Rita jail.\n\nName: Michael Hermon *The sheriff disputes that Hermon died in Santa Rita Jail custody, despite his name being released under a Public Records Act by the coroner's office as an in-custody death. The sheriff's office said he was released under the \"Compassionate Release program,\" but no details were provided.\n\nAge: 47\n\nArrested: Feb. 21. Arrested in Berkeley after he reportedly shot a gun into his van. No injuries were reported.\n\nDate of death: 3/24/2019\n\nTotal time in jail: One month\n\nOccupation: Army Gulf War veteran\n\nRace: White\n\nCause of death: His parents say he was punched and beaten and acknowledged he had cirrhosis of the liver due to alcoholism. They said they were told that because his liver was so damaged, he couldn't heal from his injuries. The sheriff provided the death report on May 6, 2020. They ruled his death a homcide. The causes were cerebral insufficiency and medical complications following blunt injuries to the head.\n\nInvestigative agency: Alameda County Sheriff Damon Wilson\n\nIsolation: No\n\nHealth and/or mental issues: PTSD\n\nDrug issues: Alcoholic\n\nRestraints: No\n\nNarrative: According to Hermon's father, Tom Hermon, his son had been taken to Santa Rita and was going to be released the next day to a veteran's diversion program. But the day before the release, his son was punched or beaten. His father said pictures showed severe facial injuries. He was taken to Stanford Health Care - ValleyCare in Livermore on March 13. Sgt. Ray Kelly told Berkelyside that he had been in a minor altercation, and that someone had punched Hermon in the nose. He was conscious and talking but his nose wouldn't stop bleeding. He was ultimately placed on life support at the hospital. Kelly said they do not consider this an in-custody death.\n\nAt the time, the autopsy wasn't available, and Tom Hermon doesn't believe this story. He doesn't know who punched his son and he said the injuries looked much more severe than a simple assault. \"Who killed him? A deputy or an inmate?\" Tom Hermon asked.\n\nHe learned of the injuries on March 17, four days after they occurred and was told that he would not be allowed to visit his son. Still, he flew to the hospital, where Michael Hermon was under sheriff's supervision the entire time, his father said. However, Tom Hermon said he learned that his son had been discharged from the jail.\n\nBefore he went to jail for allegedly shooting off a gun in his van, Michael Hermon was an Army veteran who served in Desert Storm and was an engineer and an elite jumper. He graduated UC Irvine with honors. He was accepted at Princeton University, but chose the PhD program at the University of Utah where he graduated with a doctorate in philosophy, his family said. He later taught ethics at the university.\n\nHe had been married and has two sons.\n\nThe autopsy did not identify who beat Hermon or if anyone had been arrested.\n\nName: Omar Luis Porcayo\n\nAge: 40\n\nArrested: 05/23/2019\n\nDate of death: 5/29/2019\n\nTotal time in jail: Six days\n\nOccupation: Construction worker\n\nRace: Latino\n\nCause of death: Natural, complications of heart disease\n\nInvestigative agency: Alameda County sheriff's investigator Jeff Hovda\n\nIsolation: Yes.

A deputy checked on his on June 5 at 3:05 p.m. when he had been sleeping. His next check was at 4:22 p.m., when he was found unresponsive in the fetal position. It is common practice for inmates on suicide watch to be check on every 15 or 30 minutes, civil rights lawyers say. Hernandez's father and stepmother were notified. A press hold was issued on the case on Aug. 28 for an unknown reason. 2 Investigates obtained the report on Jan. 20, 2020.\n\nChristian Madrigal was first taken to Fremont city jail where officers allegedly beat, choked and placed the disoriented and mentally ill young man in a WRAP device, civil rights attorney John Burris said. Madrigal was then transported him to Santa R\n\nName: Christian Madrigal *The sheriff disputes that Madrigal died in Santa Rita Jail custody, despite his name being released under a Public Records Act by the coroner's office as an in-custody death. The sheriff's office said he was released under the \"Compassionate Release program,\" but no details were provided. The coroner's full report has not been released. KTVU does not agree with this analysis and is including Madrigal's name in the count.\n\nAge: 20\n\nArrested: 6/10/2019 Madrigal’s parents called Fremont police that he had recently been released from a psychiatric hospital, the Santa Clara Valley Psychiatric Unit, for mental health issues and he needed to return. Since Madrigal wasn’t willing to go voluntarily, his family needed help in taking him back to the mental health facility, according to the claim. But instead, Fremont police arrested him for being criminally under the influence, instead of a psychiatric hold, Madrigal’s family said in a legal claim.\n\nDate of death: 6/15/2019\n\nTotal time in jail:\n\nOccupation:\n\nRace: Latino\n\nCause of death: Legal claim says suicide\n\nInvestigative agency:\n\nIsolation: Possibly.\n\nHealth and/or mental issues: Yes, his mother said.\n\nDrug issues:\n\nRestraints: Yes. He was placed in a WRAP in Fremont.\n\nNarrative: On June 10, Christian Madrigal’s family sought medical assistance for their 20-year-old son because he was suffering a mental health crisis, according to a claim filed by civil rights attorney John Burris. When Fremont police arrived, Madrigal’s parents informed the officers that their son had recently been released from the psychiatric hospital for mental health issues and needed to return. However, Fremont officers ignored his mental health needs and instead determined to arrest him for being criminally under the influence, Burris alleges. Madrigal was first taken to Fremont city jail where officers allegedly beat, choked and placed the disoriented and mentally ill young man in a WRAP device, Burris said. Madrigal was then transported him to Santa Rita Jail. There, Burris alleges that jail deputies ignored Madrigal’s parent’s pleas to have him examined by a mental health professional and/or transferred to a mental health facility. Instead, a lieutenant with the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department ordered his deputies to chain Madrigal to a cell door, in violation of the jail’s internal policies, Burris alleges. The deputies initially protested the lieutenant’s commands but ultimately relented to their superior officer’s authority, the claim states. Madrigal was left unattended for at least 10 minutes and was found trying to commit suicide by hanging himself using the very same chains the deputies restrained him to the door with, Burris said. Madrigal was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors refused to treat him, Burris said, because they noted his internal injuries were so severe they warranted emergent trauma care. Madrigal was then brought to Eden Medical Center where doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a lacerated spleen and liver along with bruising all over his body, including pulmonary contusions. He never recovered and died at Eden Medical Center in Hayward. The Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and the district attorney’s office are investigating the incident, per department protocol when an in-custody death occurs. The Fremont police said the \"suit wrongfully claims excessive force was used against Madrigal while in the custody of the Fremont Police Department for being under the influence of drugs.\" The coroner’s report has not been made public in this case.\n\nName: Christopher Dean Thomas **The sheriff disputes that Thomas died in Santa Rita Jail custody, despite his name being released under a Public Records Act by the coroner's office as an in-custody death. The sheriff's office said he was released under the \"Compassionate Release program,\" but no details were provided. 2 Investigates received the coroner's report on Oct. 31 from family.\n\nAge: 44\n\nArrested: A relative said he had been in and out of jail and prison for 15 years on drug and burglary charges mostly. Thomas may also have been in gangs, the relative said.\n\nDate of death: 7/6/2019\n\nTotal time in jail: Unclear\n\nOccupation: Technician\n\nRace: White\n\nCause of death: Suicide by anoxic encephalopathy and hanging. The coroner's report said he was found partially suspended with a noose fashioned from a bedsheet around his neck.\n\nInvestigative agency: Alameda County Sheriff/Anthony Gogna\n\nIsolation: No\n\nHealth and/or mental issues:\n\nDrug issues: A relative said Thomas had a history of drug problems. A forensic report showed he had methamphetamine and marijuana in his system on June 30.\n\nRestraints: No\n\nNarrative: The coroner's report states that Thomas was found partially suspended from a gate at the jail with a noose fashioned from a bedsheet around his neck on June 30. He was taken to a hospital where he was diagnosed with anoxic brain injury. He was on life support for several days and then gave away his organs. The report states he had \"suicidal ideations\" before being found.\n\nPage 10, line 97 of Christopher Thomas' autopsy report.\n\nA family member who asked to remain anonymous said he he skeptical of the report. He knows Thomas died, but he called out the fact that on page 10 of the report, it specifically states \"no conspicious ligature mark or ligature furrow is on the neck.\"\n\n\"You can't die by hanging without any marks around your neck,\" the relative said.\n\nRaymond Reyes was kept in isolation for 19 days.

He suffered from social anxiety disorder.\n\nDrug issues: Methamphatamene and naxalone found at \"therapeutic levels.\"\n\nRestraints: Unknown\n\nNarrative: Raymond Reyes Jr. was in and out of jail, his family said, and had many challenges in his life. He met his wife, Vanessa, through Instagram in 2017 and they married three months later. They have a baby, Ray, who is four months old. His mother, Yasmin, and sister, Reanna, described Reyes as very funny and loving. On the day he died, he spoke to Vanessa at 2:30 p.m. by phone. He seemed fine and was looking forward to her next visit. At 5:30 p.m., she got an email saying he had been released. At first, she was happy. She couldn’t get any information when she called. About 10:30 p.m. that night, a deputy called her to say he had committed suicide. She wants a timeline of what happened. The answer doesn’t seem right to her.\n\nAccording to the deputy's narrative provided on Jan. 20, 2020, nothing seemed wrong with Reyes at 3 p.m. after he had visited with his wife. At 4:20 p.m., a deputy passed by and saw that Reyes' cell door was covered with cardboard as the evening food trays were passed out. The deputy thought that Reyes had wanted some privacy while he used the toilet. The deputy said Reyes said he was all right through the cell door. At 4:57 p.m. , the deputy looked into the cell through the handcuf port and saw that he had wrapped bed sheets around his neck. He was pronounced dead at the jail. Deputies said he left \"letters of intent\" behind and that on March 28, he had been put in a \"safety cell\" because of \"suicidal ideations.\" One handwritten letter in the cell, dated July 24, outlined Reyes' love for his wife and their son but also his disgust that she was cheating on him. He also left a note for his mother and mentioned having regret about doing something to his sister.\n\nA fellow inmate, Jamario Harris, told KTVU that he heard Reyes begging the guards to be let out of his solitary room. \"He wasn't getting any yard time,\" Harris said, who acknowledged that in Ad Seg, he thought about committing suicide twice a day. \"He wasn't getting air.
