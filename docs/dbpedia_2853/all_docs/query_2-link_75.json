        "text": "Emil Zátopek - World Record Performances\n\n5,000 Meters\n\n13.57.2\n\nMay 30, 1954\n\nParis\n\n10,000 Meters\n\n28.54.2\n\nJune 1, 1954\n\nBrussels 29.01.6\n\nNovember 1, 1953\n\nStara Boleslav 29.02.6\n\nAugust 4, 1950\n\nTurku 29.21.2\n\nOctober 22, 1949\n\nOstrava 29:28.2\n\nJune 11, 1949\n\nOstrava\n\nQuotes by Emil Zatopek\n\n\"Men, today we die a little.\"\n\nEmil Zatopek at the start of the 1956 Olympic Marathon.\n\n-\n\n\"Why should I practice running slow? I already know how to run slow.\n\nI want to learn to run fast.\"\n\n-\n\n\"When a person trains once, nothing happens. When a person forces himself to do a thing a hundred or a thousand times, then he certainly has developed in more ways than physical.\n\nIs it raining? That doesn't matter. Am I tired? That doesn't matter, either.\n\nThen willpower will be no problem.\"\n\n-\n\n\"A runner must run with dreams in his heart, not money in his pocket.\"\n\n-\n\n\"To boast of a performance which I cannot beat is merely stupid vanity.\n\nAnd if I can beat it that means there is nothing special about it.\"\n\n-\n\n\"What has passed is already finished with.\n\nWhat I find more interesting is what is still to come.\"\n\n-\n\n\"We forget our bodies to the benefit of mechanical leisure. We act continuously with our brain, but we no longer use our bodies, our limbs. It is the Africans who possess this vitality, this muscular youth, this thirst for physical action which we are lacking. We have a magnificent motor at our disposal, but we no longer know how to use it.\"\n\n-\n\n\"There is a great advantage in training under unfavorable conditions. It is better to train under bad conditions, for the difference is then a tremendous relief in a race.\"\n\n-\n\n\"If you want to win something, run 100 meters.\n\nIf you want to experience something, run a marathon.\"\n\n-\n\n\"You can't climb up to the second floor without a ladder....When you set your aim too high and don't fulfill it, then your enthusiasm turns to bitterness.\n\nTry for a goal that's reasonable, and then gradually raise it.\"\n\n-\n\n\"After all those dark days of the war, the bombing, the killing, the starvation, the revival of the Olympics was as if the sun had come out....I went into the Olympic Village and suddenly there were no more frontiers, no more barriers. Just the people meeting together. It was wonderfully warm. Men and women who had just lost five years of life were back again.\"\n\nEmil Zatopek, about the 1948 London Olympics.\n\n-\n\nEmil Zatopek describes his marathon win at the Helsinki Olympics,\n\n\"I was unable to walk for a whole week after that, so much did the race take out of me.\n\nBut it was the most pleasant exhaustion I have ever known.\"\n\n-\n\n\"If you come to think of it, you never see deer, dogs and\n\nrabbits worrying about their menus and yet they run much faster than humans.\"\n\n-\n\nWhen asked about his tortured expression during races,\n\nEmil Zatopek said, \"It is not gymnastics or ice skating you know.\"\n\n-\n\n\"There are three things worth living for:\n\nAmerican luxury, Japanese women and Chinese food,\"\n\nEmil Zatopek said, joking.\n\n-\n\n\"When I was young, I was too slow. I thought I must learn to run fast by practicing to run fast, so I ran 100 meters fast 20 times. Then I came back, slow,slow,slow. People said, 'Emil, you are crazy. You are training like a sprinter.'\"\n\n-\n\nEmil Zatopek on Interval Training, \"Everyone said, 'Emil, you are a fool!'\n\nBut when I first won the European Championship, they said: 'Emil, you are a genius!'\"\n\n-\n\n\"It's at the borders of pain and suffering that the men are separated from the boys.\"\n\n-\n\n\"He does everything wrong but win.\"\n\nLarry Snyder, Ohio State track coach, about Emil Zatopek's contorted style of running.\n\n-\n\n\"Great is the victory, but the friendship is all the greater.\"\n\nOther Profiles\n\nHorace Ashenfelter\n\nAmby Burfoot\n\nJohnny Hayes\n\nFrank Hart\n\nJohnny A. Kelley (The Elder)\n\nJohnny J. Kelley (The Younger)Johnny running for BU\n\nGeorge Littlewood\n\nBilly Mills\n\nBill Rodgers\n\nEmil Zátopek"
