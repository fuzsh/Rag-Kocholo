        "text": "Emil Zatopek, perhaps the greatest distance runner ever and surely the most ungainly, died yesterday in Prague. He was 78 years old.\n\nZatopek died in Prague's military hospital, where he was being treated after a stroke in late October, the Czech news agency CTK reported.\n\nHe produced one of the most enduring performances in track and field in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics when Zatopek, a captain in the Czechoslovak Army, won the 5,000 meters, the 10,000 meters and the marathon. No one has achieved that remarkable triple before or since, and it led Roger Bannister, the Englishman who in 1954 ran the first sub-four-minute mile, to call Zatopek ''the greatest athlete of the postwar world.''\n\nZatopek (ZAT-oh-peck) looked so awful when he ran -- wobbling, and as if in constant pain -- that it seemed remarkable that he could finish one lap, let alone break 18 world records during a 17-year career. He was also the first to run a 10,000-meter race in less than 29 minutes. Sport magazine called him ''a formless madman.'' But he was part actor as well as part artist, and some of his agony was merely for effect.\n\nRed Smith, then of The New York Herald-Tribune, described Zatopek's running style: ''Bobbing, weaving, staggering, gyrating, clutching his torso, slinging supplicating glances toward the heavens, he ran like a man with a noose around his neck. He seemed on the verge of strangulation.''\n\nZatopek said: ''I was not talented enough to run and smile at the same time.''\n\nHe was a hero to the Czechoslovak people, if not always to the Communist government and its Soviet masters. When the regime turned on him for criticizing the Soviet-led military invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the people embraced him even more.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
