        "text": "After Prohibition the Sick family of Canada was intent on entering the U.S. market. They began in early 1933 by acquiring control of breweries in both Great Falls and Missoula, Montana. Next they established the Goetz Brewery in Spokane, later moving the business to the old Galland-Burke Brewery, but they were drawn to Seattle where more lucrative opportunities awaited.\n\nIn 1933, they took out a lease (with an option to buy) the old Bay View Brewery which had been operating as a feed mill since 1918. On June 7, 1933, the Century Brewing Association was incorporated and the plant renamed the Century Brewery. In 1934 the Sicks exercised the option and purchased the plant from the mill owners.\n\nTheApex Brewing Co. was located on Hemrich family property adjacent to the Century Brewery, and had been struggling since the February 1935 death of its founder, Alvin Hemrich. In May of 1938, Sick purchased the company, and for one year, until May '39, the old Apex brewery became home to Rheinlander Brewery, Inc. Later the facility was to become the company's quality control, and chemical lab.\n\nThe Pilsener Brewing Co. had closed in late 1934, which left the Horluck Brewing Company as the only other operating brewery in Seattle - and on May 1st, 1939, through a deal brokered by Lester R. McCash, that too was under the Sick's control. McCash joined the Sicks' team after a disappointing tenure with the Hemrich Brewing Co., which was about to go under.\n\nThe deal with McCash was facilitated by Horluck's vice-president and general manager, Bernard Hochstadter. The plant went through a $75,000 expansion and modernization program, and re-opened as Sick's Century Brewery - and home to Rheinlander Beer. Hochstadter stayed on as vice-president of this new organization.\n\nThe new brewmaster for Century was John A. Weiss, oldest son of Hans H. Weiss, brewmaster for the main plant which had been operating as Seattle Brewing & Malting since June of 1937.\n\nBelow is a 1939 photo of the Horluck plant - now the Century Brewery - with it's new signage: \"Century's Rheinlander.\" This sign had been moved from the main plant on Airport Way - as can be seen in the 1935 photo of the original Century Brewery.\n\nThe \"new\" Century Brewery - October 1939\n\nSick's Select beer was introduced in Seattle on August 10, 1939, seemingly as an alternative to their flagship brand, Rainier. However, it was merely a ploy that allowed the Sick organization to offer a premium Seattle beer to Portland and the San Francisco Bay area. Due to the deal struck with the Rainier Brewing Co. of S.F. in 1935, they could only sell Rainier Beer in Washington and Alaska, so this new brand provided them entry into these other lucrative markets. Sick's Select, as well as Rainier was produced in the main plant on Airport Way.\n\nfirst Sick's Select label, ca.1939\n\nIn April of 1940, brewmaster, John A. Weiss was still producing Rheinlander Beer, now with a new blue & gold label, hopefully to stimulate sales. Weiss also introduced an ale to the line-up in 1940 called Boss' Ale. Then in Sept. of '41, they transferred production of Sick's Select to the Century plant, and the floundering Rheinlander brand was discontinued - but Rheinlander was re-introduced 20 years later as it's budget brand. For more on the brand, go to: Rheinlander Breweries.\n\nWith the demise of Rheinlander, the Century plant now became \"The Home of Sick's Select\" and had the signage to prove it, as seen in this later 1944 drawing.\n\nSicks' Century plant drawing, ca.1944\n\nWhile promotional items touted the Sick's Century Brewery name, their product labels and cans carried the corporate name, Seattle Brewing & Malting Co.\n\nIn November, 1941 their short lived Boss' Ale was replaced by Sick's Select Ale, and both their beer & ale labels now carried an updated logo displaying a new style numeral 6. This was also done for their canned Sick's Select. The new labels carried the slogan: \"The Famous Ale/Beer From Seattle\" and in '47 the slogan was changed to \"The Best Beer/Ale In Town.\"\n\nBy 1942, co-managers L. R. McCash & F. W. Shepard had increased annual production at the Century plant to 80,000 barrels. With the purchase of the Salem Brewery Assn. in Oct. '43, Shepard transferred to the Salem plant and relieved the outgoing manager in hopes of increasing production there as well. John Weiss was replaced by his assistant, Al Bush, and Weiss moved to Los Angeles to take over as brewmaster of the Maier brewery.\n\nIn January 1944, Sicks' was added to all the company's breweries and the Century Brewery now became Sicks' Century Brewery, and Sick's Select was changed to Sicks' Select - but Sick's Select Ale had already been discontinued. Unfortunately, neither the ale or the beer had made the impact on the California market that had been anticipated, but now the remaining Sick's Select beer was holding its own in the greater Portland area. With its production now in Oregon the brand was doing even better there, and the slogan, \"The Famous Beer from Seattle\" was replaced with, \"A Sicks' Quality Product.\"\n\nIn 1949 Emil Sick decided to give the Sicks' Select label (left) a new look. He hired Walter Landor of San Francisco, who came up with the design shown on the label below (right). It was introduced in July of '49.\n\nThis was Landor's first work with a beer label and it earned him a design award in '49. In 1952 Landor re-designed the famous red \"R\" on the Rainier label which was then introduced in early '53.\n\nLandor went on to work on other brewer's labels, and in early '57 he updated Lucky Lager's distinctive red \"X\" logo with stylized hop leaves.\n\nAlso in 1949, Bob Weingaertner succeeded Al Bush as brewmaster. Weingaertner came to Seattle from NY City where he had been a brewer for Piel Bros. Late in 1950, Weingaertner was instrumental in the formulation of a new product which would become Brew 66. It was test marketed in the Seattle and Portland markets from March to June of '51. They called it the \"new taste of Sicks' Select,\" so rather than print new labels for the trial they just overprinted the Sicks' Select label with the new brand name (at right).\n\nIn July of '51, Brew 66 was launched, and production commenced at both the Century Brewery, and Sicks' Brewing Co. in Salem, OR - this time sporting its own new label (left) designed for the roll-out.\n\nA separate sales organization was formed for the new brand and it proved to be a marketing success, and by early '54 it had replaced the old Sicks' Select. The Sicks' Select banner was also removed from the Brew 66 labels and cans.\n\nTwo years later, in June '53, the Salem plant was closed, making the Century Brewery the sole \"Home of Brew 66.\"\n\nThe following month, in July of '53, the Century brewery introduced Brew 66 \"Special Draught\" for taverns, but continued canning and bottling Brew 66 for the carry-out trade. Three years later, in mid-1956, production of Brew 66 was shifted to the main plant on Airport Way, and canned Brew 66 was phased out.\n\nOn 15 April, 1957, the SeaBrew stockholders voted to change the corporate name to Sicks' Rainier Brewing Co. By now, production of Brew 66 at the Airport Way plant was meeting demands and it was decided to that the Century plant would cease functioning as a brewery. However, the building continued to house the executive offices for the Brew 66 Division. The famed Brew 66 Taproom also stayed open to the public, as well as serve as a taproom school for tavern owners.\n\nThen in July '58, the decision was made to offer Brew 66 only as a draft beer in taverns, and by late '58 the last of the bottled goods had been sold. The final Brew 66 label, with the phrase \"A Lighter Beer\"is shown below.\n\nFour years later, in March of '62, the Brew 66 taproom in the Century Brewery was closed, and all activities were transferred to the main plant on Airport Way.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 1965, the property at Westlake Ave. N. and Mercer Ave. was sold to an investment company who in turn leased the property to Union Oil of Calif. A couple of months later the Century Brewery was demolished to make way for a gas station.\n\nHowever, the Brew 66 brand remained in the Rainier Brewery's line-up, but as a budget draft beer. At only 3.2% it was a favorite for college keggers and pizza parlors, and the brand held on until the early '80s."
