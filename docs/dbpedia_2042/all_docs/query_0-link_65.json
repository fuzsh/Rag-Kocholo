So Why invest in Spain‚Äôs agri-food industry? üìä Agri-food is a key industry in the Spanish economy. It is strong and resilient and is the country's top-ranked industry. üëá Find out more and download our latest report 2023: https://lnkd.in/dk7z4bPa #ICEX #investinspain #entrepeneurship #foodtech #report #agrifood #industry\n\nReflecting on a Year of Israeli High-Tech üáÆüá± Noga Sela Shalev, CEO of Fresh Start foodtech incubator, shares insights from the foodtech sector: \"The Israeli agri-food industry had a rollercoaster year. Alongside some major achievements, many foodtech companies struggled to secure funding. While the lofty promises of revolutionizing the food and beverage industry still hold, the challenges of regulations and infrastructure showed us that mass production is a long road ahead. On the other hand, we're witnessing exciting technologies emerging, poised to enhance scalability, improve quality, nutrition, and affordability in future products. This keeps our optimism high for what's to come.\" For the full Israel Hayom ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊î◊ô◊ï◊ù article (in Hebrew), visit >> https://lnkd.in/d3P9SbmB #FoodTechExperts #StartupIncubator #InnovationNation #IsraeliHiTechStars #FoodTechIndustry #YearInReview #ExpertInsights Tammy Meiron, Ph.D., Daniel Gamsu, Hadas Sibony Benyamini, Ariella Artzi Henig, Sapir Hashmonai, Tom Kaverman, Tnuva, Tempo Beverages Ltd, OurCrowd, Finistere Ventures, Israel Innovation Authority ◊®◊©◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ó◊ì◊©◊†◊ï◊™\n\nThanks a lot to FoodHack Ville de Lausanne Team Camille Aouina√Øt, Jean-Marc Parveaux, Luc-Etienne D. for having organised last night event so well and for their invitation. ENDEAVOUR DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL would like to underline their key role in supporting dot connections amongst start-up entrepreneurs, scientists, investors, experts, job seekers and politicians over the agrofood ecosystem. As food is one of key pillars of mankind future, it's essential that each of us feel committed to do its share. Thanks also to Rapha√´l Lutz for providing us with welcoming facilities and La Sobrerie for its support to this event. I also wanted to thank Laurence Jeangros and Heiko Specking for the insightful and complementary interactions we had during the roundtable session, and the audience for their relevant questions and exchanges during the cocktail. As a conclusion of this session, let's keep in mind: - solutions to current nutrition and agricultural challenges are so many, there is not ONE way only. - actors of change are scientists, start-up entrepreneurs, small & medium-sized companies and citizens ; every one has to do its share. - changes will come with frugal innovation, ESR, vision, commitment and endurance (one good example is the #demain documentary by Cyril Dion and M√©lanie Laurent) - governments can't decide for everybody ; most important is to allow virtuous initiatives #innovation #food #growthacceleration #innovationgeneration #agroalimentaire #startup #agilite #agility #frontendinnovation #routetomarket # Some actors of change met in the audience : Christian Moreillon, Alfred Yoakim, Etienne Arnoux, .....\n\nHeading to #Paris next week to speak to agrifoodtech innovators! In this workshop held during ShakeUp Factory, EIT Food and Big Idea Ventures‚Äô Demo Day - The New Food Paradigm, YC Choy, Naomin Tan and I will be joined by: Fr√©d√©ric BOUVIER of Roquette; Marit Keemink of Meatable; and Isabelle DECITRE of ID Capital Pte. #Asia has become the largest region in the global food market. Asian consumers will spend an additional USD 4.4 trillion on food over the next ten years, as massive demographic changes and evolving consumer needs drive up demand for larger quantities and better quality food. To meet this demand sustainably, new technology, processes and mindsets must be introduced to the food industry, and that paradigm shift has taken place on every continent, but none more so than in #SoutheastAsia (SEA) where agriculture is a major economic and social activity. SEA has more than 270 agrifood tech startups which have attracted more than ‚Ç¨3.3 billion between 2013 to 2022. Furthermore, between 2019 to 2022, the SEA ecosystem grew 54% (CAGR), as opposed to 13% for the global ecosystem. We will deep dive into how #Singapore is going to achieve its ambitious vision to treble domestic food production with the help of innovative technology and forward-thinking regulations. Join us to learn key opportunities for #agrifood tech startups in Southeast Asia and how to capitalise on various support mechanisms offered by the Singapore ecosystem.

This surplus could be marketed to both Israel and global markets, simultaneously strengthening domestic food security, according to Segun Olusegun Olanipekun, president of the African Leadership Summit (ALS). Earlier this month, Olanipekun headed a delegation to Israel comprising over 50 African leaders, including politicians and business people. Their primary objective was to explore the potential of harnessing Israeli innovation. \"We want to seize the opportunity and build this highway,\" said Olanipekun, also the CEO and founder of the African Israel Chamber of Commerce (AICC). The delegation participated in a multi-day business summit as part of a collaboration with Mountain View Consulting Agency and the Heartland Initiative. The events were hosted at the Azrieli Towers in Tel Aviv and the Ramada Hotel Queen Sheba Conference Hall, along with several site visits. The participants came from various corners of Africa, including South Africa, Nigeria, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Ghana, Kenya, and Angola. Olanipekun launched the AICC 10 years ago, hosting its first summit in 2013 in Jerusalem. The goal is to \"build a highway\" between Africa and Israel so that Africa can better benefit from the Start-up Nation. \"We have observed the start-up culture, the way Israel uses entrepreneurs to unlock the Israeli economy, and we want to see that in different parts of Africa,\" Olanipekun explained. https://lnkd.in/guuZtKcq\n\nFirsts days are best because they are beginnings. Summer time is over and a new school year starts: I look forward (about time üòÖ) to take my children to the school bus stop. Other things to look forward to this autumn: New strategic alliances between Gastronomy Open Ecosystem and global partners to create new food and ingredients that are sustainable, healthy and, specially fun. Let‚Äôs call it #HedonisticSustainability. The future of food and gastronomy does not need to be neither dystopian nor boring. Being sustainable, healthy and affordable is not enough. Gastronomy puts the required ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù on those new products. I look forward to create and promote with our partners great ‚ÄúTesla moments‚Äù (Nadav Berger üòâ) on food and gastronomy. Speaking of sustainable hedonism: this autumn we will also set the first stone of the GOe center with our friends from BIG - Bjarke Ingels Group and BAT - Bilbao Architecture Team I also look forward to the new developments from Cardumen Capital FoodTech Fund and the new incubator along with a new edition of Culinary Action! Global Foodtech, already the largest international FoodTech accelerator event in the world: Tokyo (Japan stop will be quiet special this year), Buenos Aires, Copenhague, New York, Tel Aviv and San Sebasti√°n ‚Ä¶ connecting ecosystems from four continents üöÄ The European Commission chose after all Culinary Action! as the best initiative to foster entrepreneurship in Europe: Dreams should come, after all, a size too big, so that we can grow into them. The team at Basque Culinary Center we continue to grow to fit into them, with more things to come. But first, let‚Äôs start making it on time in the morning to the school bus.
