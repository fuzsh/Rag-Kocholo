        "text": "The challenges of absorbing immigrants in the city\n\nMK Oded Forer (Israel Beitenu), who serves as chairman of the Aliyah, Absorption and Diaspora Committee, conducted a special tour of Haifa last night (Sun. 2/7/23), during which he visited the 'Aba Khushi' studio for Hebrew studies and the 'Naot Carmeli' housing cluster He also had a working meeting with the mayor, Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem.\n\nAccording to the data of the Aliyah and Diaspora Absorption Committee, Haifa is the city that receives the most immigrants among all Israeli cities. According to the data of the Ministry of Aliyah and Absorption, in recent years Haifa has received about 20% of the total number of immigrants who came to Israel.\n\nAccording to the Absorption, Immigrant and Diaspora Committee under the authority of MK Porer, the visit comes against the background of reports from the Hebrew studios in the city about a shortage of teachers for the opening of the next year and the waiting list of students to study Hebrew that is getting longer and longer. , for receiving public housing, whose number now stands at 3,500 people, and is expected to grow by another 1,000 people in the near future, due to the great wave of immigration coming to Haifa.\n\nAccording to the data of the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, in 2022 8,885 immigrants arrived in Haifa, about 71% came from Russia, and another 20% came from Ukraine. In 2023 until the end of May, 3,515 immigrants arrived in Haifa, about 85% of them came from Russia, 4 % from Ukraine and another 4% from Belarus. Thus, according to the data, in recent years 19% of all immigrants who come to Israel settle in the city of Haifa.\n\n'Neglecting the immigrants and harming the immigrants'\n\nMK Oded Forer, chairman of the Aliyah, Absorption and Diaspora Committee, said during the tour:\n\n\"Haifa has been one of the most significant cities in receiving immigrants for many years and in particular in the wave of immigrants in the last two years. The State of Israel is throwing away the potential of immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. Since the establishment of the government, we have been in a difficult situation of neglecting the immigrants and harming the immigrants. Adaptation grants have been canceled, there are thousands waiting to study Hebrew in the studios, the emergency immigration points to Israel are on the verge of closing and thousands of families are waiting for immigration from Russia to Israel. The State of Israel is conducting itself as normal while the immigrants who come from Russia and Ukraine are in crisis. Currently in the wave of immigration there are over 70 thousand new immigrants per year, and if the State of Israel were to invest more resources, we would We reach 100 immigrants a year.\"\n\nBudgets are required\n\nDr. Einat Kalish-Rotem, Mayor of Haifa, said:\n\n\"Haifa is the city that receives the most immigrants in Israel. When the tensions on the border between Russia and Ukraine began, we gathered all the city's absorption experts to bring as many new immigrants as possible to Haifa. The municipality of Haifa needs financial help in order to be able to raise more budgets and assets for the large population of immigrants coming to the city. We We must take care of the status of the teachers in the studios. I want to open more classes for learning Hebrew in the studios and I don't have the money for it, even though this responsibility does not fall on the shoulders of the municipal sector but on the shoulders of the government ministries.\"\n\n'Waiting list is getting longer to study Hebrew'\n\nDorit Horesh, director of the Abba Khushi studio in Haifa:\n\n\"We are facing a major shortage of teachers for the start of the next school year. According to the current enrollment situation, I need to open a class to study Hebrew every two weeks, before the current wave of immigration I had to open a class to study Hebrew every month. The waiting list is currently 120 waiting and as long as we don't succeed Recruit more teachers, this list will only get longer.\"\n\n\"The studio teachers are leaving because of financial hardship\"\n\nKati Segev, pedagogical instructor at the Hebrew study studio:\n\n\"Every day I see teachers who choose to leave because of financial hardship. As long as we do not enter into the Histadrut's salary agreement, we feel like second-class teachers. The studio teachers feel good about their jobs, but we knew over the years that we were supposed to enter the path of a new horizon, just like the teachers In the schools. We are fighting for a proper salary that will reflect the investment of the Hebrew teaching community in the studios.\"\n\nChairman of the committee MK Oded Forer:\n\n\"The continuation of the Hebrew study studio crisis is an omission by the Israeli government. There are stages during negotiations when ministers need to get into the thick of things and turn the tables if necessary. If the negotiations are not closed this week, we may find ourselves in an even bigger crisis. If the government wanted to end this crisis, it would have long been behind us.\"\n\n'Waiting 15 years for public housing'\n\nErez Shani, CEO of Amigor Company:\n\n\"There is a line of about 3,5000 new immigrants waiting to receive public housing in the city of Haifa. We have built thousands of public housing units all over the country, but we cannot build a public housing cluster in Haifa because of bureaucratic difficulties. We are asking for a statement from the mayor on the removal of the barriers In favor of the establishment of the public housing cluster. There are elderly people who wait 15 years in line to receive public housing and it is critical to provide them with housing solutions in a quick period of time.\""
