        "text": "The Aliyah and Integration Ministry and the Jewish Agency for Israel has launched an ad campaign that offers a prize for anyone who provides information about the whereabouts of Haymanot Kasau, a 10-year-old girl from Safed who has been missing for five months.\n\nThe campaign began earlier this month. Next Monday, August 5, the Israel Police plans to conduct a massive search for the missing child. Mounted police units and police dogs will participate in the search, alongside IDF trackers and staff members of other entities, such as United Hatzalah, according to Avi Yalew, who works with the family.\n\nKasau, who immigrated with her family from Ethiopia to Israel and lived in the absorption center in Safed, was last seen in February, when security footage showed her at the entrance of the absorption center, wearing a pink sweatshirt, a black skirt, and white sneakers.\n\nCampaign announces reward\n\nThe ad campaign is meant to raise awareness and remind the public that she is still missing. It offers a NIS 350,000 prize for anyone who provides information that leads to finding her.\n\n“We cannot give up. Haymanot needs us!” reads the ad, which calls on the public to not stand by but to “join efforts to find her.”\n\n“Any information, and details, could lead to the breakthrough we want,” the ad says.\n\nA private investigation firm joined efforts to find the child last month, Yalew said.\n\nEli Ashkenazi contributed to this report."
