They await Netanyahu's final decision.\n\nLiberman resigned from his post as Defense Minister in the outgoing cabinet, criticizing what he called lax policies towards Hamas in light of repeated attacks from Gaza.\n\nAn unnamed source involved in the negotiation process, between the prime minister and Liberman, said new guidelines regarding Israeli's strategy towards the terror organiztion, have been agreed on.\n\nNegotiations between Netanyahu and Liberman had reached a dead-end last week, and Yisrael Beytenu declared it was ready to \"serve Israel from the opposition\" if their demands are not met.\n\nLiberman held meetings with the IDF Chief of Staff and Shin Bet officials, with Netanyahu's approval, according to reports on Channel 13 news, Wednesday, adding to speculations he will resume his role as defense minister.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to finalize coalition talks with all other parties, ahead of the May 28 deadline for presenting his new government;\n\nAn agreement with the Shas Party is likely to be signed very soon, sources say.\n\nSome progress has been made in talks with United Torah Judaism, the ultra-Orthodox party, but on Wednesday, Likud sources confirmed that the draft law, the core issue between the two sides, is still unresolved.\n\nThe Likud's negotiation team asked that the ultra-Orthodox parties approve the draft law as is, and that the government will change the quotas after the law is approved so that the actual number of Haredis drafted remains the same.\n\nbut, according to Likud sources, Deputy Health Minister MK Yaakov Litzman, head of United Torah Judaism, will not respond untill the Gerrer Rebbe, leader of the Ger Hassidic court, to which Litzman belongs, approves the final version of the bill.\n\n\"He (the Rebbe) has to send us a version of the draft law that he can live with,\" said sources\n\nNo progress can be made in negotiations before the Rebbe is heard."
