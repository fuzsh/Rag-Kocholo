        "text": "She’s gone Exhibition\n\nIlse was a talented and charismatic woman. She served as mayor of the municipality of Aalst and raised campaigns over the years for female empowerment. Her motto wשs always “because people are important”. A love story that began during Covid cost her her life and she was murdered in her sleep with brutal hammer blows. She left behind two beautiful sons and a heartbroken mother. This is her favorite shirt, transparent in body color and a delicate, soft matching skirt. This is how her life ended, and her clothes now hang silently in Brussels, alongside the other victims at the event initiated by the Israeli Embassy in Belgium.\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nOn International Women’s Day we witness a very bad year for women. On the battlefields around the world, women were abandoned to their fate, raped, kidnapped, beaten and murdered. From Ukraine to Gaza, sexual crimes have again become a weapon of war, in Iran the hijab protest was suppressed with great violence and there too, if you removed the hijab, your sentence is death. Very little has been achieved, and a lot of pain and sadness, but we must look ahead, create a front of solidarity of women and men all over the world whose purpose is to stop female oppression. And let’s start with this, to return the 17 abductees home.\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nThe exhibition opened in the building of the National Library of Bucharest. Outside the river flows, people fill the cafes, and on the hangers hang there are clothes of women who were and are no longer. 23 women - Jewish, Muslim, and Christian who share a common cruel fate and only their beautiful faces look at us from the photos in the exhibition.\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nAt the exhibition hall, dozens of people are gathering. The Ambassador of Ukraine, Luxembourg, and other representatives from across Europe are present. Journalists arriving are interested in the situation in Israel - I say: today we mark a month since the Hamas massacre of civilians, including children, women, Holocaust survivors, and the elderly. The attack was brutal and horrifying, and since then, there has been war…\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nThe festive and beautiful hall at the Centro de Arte u Cultura is slowly filling up with people. The hall with the victims' clothes is still locked, soon we will cut the strip and the guests will enter to experience the exhibition. The soundtrack of the installation is played quietly in the background, a light breeze moves the hanging clothes…\n\nConvention (Paris, France)\n\nWe were thrilled to be at the Women's Forum for the Economy & Society Global Meeting in Paris and speak on the session “When art calls for[a] social change\". We’re also very grateful for the opportunity to share the stage with Liza Ambrossio, Pauline Avenel Lam, Isabelle Simeoni, and Guila Clara Kessous.\n\nTogether we tried to answer what is the role and responsibility of art to expose gender inequalities and contribute to social change.\n\nIt’s time to act for gender equality and break the glass ceiling once and for all.\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nExactly seven years ago, the first national law in China's history against domestic violence was passed. According to studies, at least one woman out of four in China has fallen victim to violence over various issues within the family, at one point or another in her life. In rural areas the rate is higher and stands at two out of three women…\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nThe most silenced global epidemic raises its voice with a shout. No more. Thank you to the honorable Prime Minister, Mrs. Evelyna Wever Croes, to Cinthia Quant, Oscarly Garcia, Ximena Gomez and Eden Siskind, and Jose Werleman from the HIAS Aruba organization, to the UNHCR for the initiative and production of this event, for the warm, cordial and wonderful hospitality in Aruba.\n\nShe’s gone Exhibition\n\nWe are presenting She’s Gone at the U.N. in Geneva, where all nations assemble for dialogue for the sake of all mankind, while grimly demonstrating that violence against women knows no borders. We came here to call policy-makers around the world to abolish gender-based violence and its causes, which are deeply rooted in our society.\n\nProject Visit\n\nAfter two exciting and powerful days, all the clothes were silently neatly folded into a suitcase, just as if we were packing normal clothes from a trip to Vienna. In truth, none of the owners of these clothes will ever has the chance to see the city, glimmering with Christmas lights and covered in white snow.\n\nSunday morning. The events of the coming month were launched in the city of Haifa, at the Israeli Electric Company’s main office. The garments of the murdered women are hanging at the entrance to the dining room, a woman stops and asks if the dresses are for sale, others share their stories: ״my niece lived for many years with an abusive husband״, ״I used to volunteer at a shelter for battered women״, and more…\n\nSunday morning. The events of the coming month, evolving around the international day of abolishing violence again women, were launched in the city of Haifa, at the Israeli Electric Company’s main office. The garments of the murdered women are hanging at the entrance to the dining room, a woman stops and asks if the dresses are for sale, others share their stories: ״my niece lived for many years with an abusive husband״, ״I used to volunteer at a shelter for battered women״, and more…\n\nAnother event, at the Israel Police Training Center, and this time: the officers' course. Together with me, Keren, on stage, Adv. Sarit Carmel with a very moving and chilling personal story about growing up out of the violence she experienced during her childhood at home and then in her relationship. Also, we heard a testimony of a violent man, who shared his shocking story about the murder of his younger sister, a murder in which he was an accomplice...\n\nWe’re honored to expose the installation in front of police officers, female and male, together with the policewoman that left a violent husband and is now raising her two children as a single parent. Also the policeman who arrested the murderer of Dor Krescenti and her two young sons. Each and every one of them will cope with domestic violence during their service and therefore they truly have the option to change the end of these stories.\n\nOn the stage, Shira Isakov shared her story with me - a story of extraordinary courage, and her strong desire to live, a story about the transition from the position of a victim, to a determined and active position. The event was attended by the Mayor, Mrs. Miriam Feierberg.\n\nMore than fifty percent of the audience at the event at the Ministry of Agriculture were men. This is the result of an office headed by a minister with social sensitivity, and a proven work regarding violence against women. Thank you, Minister Oded Forer, for your remarks at this significant event, and also to the Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ms. Naama Kaufman Pess.\n\nThe installation in memory of the murdered women and girls, was hosted in the city of Modi'in. In the audience, Anat Elimelech's sister-in-law and best friend. This pink dress, she said to me, was hanging in my bedroom closet for years. Anat was my best friend, and I miss her so much…\n\nOne by one, a few brave women, telling the story of their lives under the heavy and horrified shadow of violence. They shared how they recreated themselves, determined to save other women's lives. In addition, the testimony of Behor Hay Keikov - a violent man who shares his story about the process he went through, regarding the decision to take responsibility and encourage more men to go his way…\n\nMore than 300 people arrived to the opening and supported the social money raising that keeps the life of the installation. Minister Stav Shaffir and Minister Aaida Toma Sliman has also attended and supported. Yesterday night was a call from Beit Liba, and it will continue to resonate.\n\nIn November we were hosted on a conference in Ra'anana municipality. We would like to thank the municipality for its warm hospitality. We are looking forward to future cooperation with you and to frequent meetings with enthusiastic inhabitants."
