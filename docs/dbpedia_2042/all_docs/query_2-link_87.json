        "text": "The Hebrew University of Jerusalem hosted a special delegation of senior officials from the Kingdom of Bahrain, from the King Hamad Global Centre for Peaceful Coexistence. The delegation was headed by Dr. Shaikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, chairman of the Center’s Board. The delegation toured the Mount Scopus campus and the parties signed an initial memorandum of understanding on joint activities, including developing joint educational programs for leadership development, innovation and technology programs, student exchange programs, and more.\n\nHebrew University President Prof. Asher Cohen presented to Dr. Shaikh Khalid the University’s different campuses and the activity upon them, the University’s ties to Jerusalem, the Hebrew University’s record of achievements and spin-off companies, the University’s involvement in the community, internationalization, innovation, and the University’s motto.\n\nRector Prof. Barak Medina presented the University’s commitment to providing all members of Israeli society the opportunity to pursue an education, along with the University’s mission for diversity. He addressed Dr. Shaikh Khalid and said, “We’re interested in establishing joint leadership training programs with institutions in Bahrain, possibly with other universities. I’d also be happy to involve a number of our departments, including Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies and Arabic Language and Literature. We offer dozens of scholarships and hundreds of students from Israel and abroad study in these departments, obtaining international success. We’re waiting to establish partnerships in these fields, as well as in Religious Studies. Other areas for potential cooperation are agriculture, environment, and food security. In terms of innovation and entrepreneurship, we’re interested in fostering collaboration with our innovation center and through the Jerusalem School of Business Administration.”\n\nDr. Shaikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Khalifa: “This is a historic moment for us. My generation has wasted time with hatred, wars, and violence – as everyone knows. I believe we have a chance at cooperating towards peace and reciprocity, improving the feelings in our region. Bahrainis and Israelis both have long histories, as does the Hebrew University. Your excellent reputation proceeds you worldwide, and most importantly – you want to encourage coexistence among the younger generation. We have a chance to work together and there will be many more opportunities to come.”\n\nHe added: “People in Bahrain have changed in recent years. If you mentioned Israelis twenty years ago, it would evoke war, violence, and hatred. Today it’s different. Now is the time to seize the opportunity we’ve been given and use it to create a better future for the younger generation. A few days ago, I told friends I was visiting Israel. They replied that they’d also like to visit. I told them we should thank g-d for giving me the opportunity to visit Israel before my time on this earth is up. I hope that we can help our younger generation become ambassadors of peace and coexistence.”\n\nRead More\n\nRead Less\n\nThe Chaim Herzog Prize for the year 2019/2020 for a unique contribution to the State of Israel, is awarded in the presence of the President of the State of Israel, Reuven (Rubi) Rivlin; the Chairman of the Jewish Agency, Itzhak (Buji) Herzog; the President of the Hebrew University, Prof. Asher Cohen, and the “Yad Chaim Herzog” Association to the businessman, technologies innovator and well-known Israeli investor Dr. Yossi Vardi, in appreciation for his great contribution in the area of coexistence and unity of the nation. The Prize is awarded by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem jointly with the Yad Chaim Herzog Association every two years, on the anniversary of the death of the sixth President of the State of Israel, Chaim Herzog, z”l. This year the Ceremony will be held in the President’s Home in a limited forum due to the outbreak of the corona virus in Israel.\n\nThe President of the State of Israel, Reuven (Rubi) Rivlin said in the Ceremony: the Israeli spirit is not tied only to commercial entrepreneurship, but also to responsibility for all, social involvement. So also Yossi Vardi, whose contribution to Israeli innovation, during his days of public service is invaluable. Congratulations on the receipt of the Herzog Prize.\n\nThe President of the Hebrew University, Prof. Asher Cohen, noted that Dr. Yossi Vardi worked for many years tirelessly for the promotion of technology and internet in Israel, to promote Israel from every possible global platform in these fields, and therefore he is deserving of every praise. His breakthrough innovation changed the face of Israeli hi-tech and in every one of his positions he combined a social and educational viewpoint. I was pleased to hear that he was chosen to receive the Herzog Prize for 2019/2020.\n\nThe Chairman of the Jewish Agency, Itzhak (Buji) Herzog: “The State of Israel was built and continues to be built thanks to people like Dr. Yossi Vardi. From among the founding fathers of the Israeli hi-tech which turned Israel into a global high-tech power, an entrepreneur and investor who contributed to the economic building of the State of Israel and a man of vision and deed who educated generations for innovation and daring. The tractate of my Father’s life, Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of the State of Israel, encompassed many fields of activity, including a significant chapter on the establishment of sophisticated industries who became the basis for the vision of Yossi Vardi and we are very proud of the decision of the Prize Committee and the Hebrew University to honor Yossi Vardi for his life’s work.”\n\nDr. Yossi Vardi, who is termed in the media as “the guru of the Israeli internet” and “the father of Israeli hi-tech exits”, invested and assisted in establishment and success of over 85 companies in the fields of software, energy, internet, mobile phones, electro-optics, and more. Among the companies that he was involved in their establishment one can find the most advanced technologies, Delek Alon, Granit Hacarmel, Internal Laser Technologies and Ormit. Furthermore, he was involved in many companies that sold to the technological giants including the answers.com company which was sold to ACVF, the Gteko Company that was sold to Microsoft, the Tivella company that was sold to Cisco, the Gifts Project Company that was sold to eBay, the FoxyTunes company that was sold to Yahoo. Yossi also advised the head of AOL and the Director General of Amazon.\n\nAt the beginning of his career Dr. Vardi held a series of senior positions in the government service and included is his appointment in 1993 by the then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, z”l, to serve as economic cooperation adviser with the Arab counties Jordan, Egypt and Syria. He even established the by-national fund for research and development with the United States, served as Israeli Chairman of the commercial dialogue with the European Common Market, he was a member of the global economic forum in Davos, and served as joint chair of conferences on matters of technology, entrepreneurship and creativity in Israel and abroad.

The Park will spread over thirty dunams and will include four buildings, an overall space of about 270 thousand sq.m. The Park will be constructed as an innovative and green park which meets the international standards of planning and environment, which include CLASS A buildings, with high LEED Standards, one of the most advanced among hi-tech parks in Israel. The existence of the Park within the Hebrew University’s grounds will enable inclusion of students of the Hebrew University and alumni in the work of hi-tech already in the course of their studies.\n\nThe President of the Hebrew University, Prof. Asher Cohen, said: “This is a breakthrough, for the first time in Israel there is a huge commercial complex for advanced and innovative industries on a university campus. I am proud that the Hebrew University led with this line of thinking and unique accomplishment with the encouragement of the Mayor of Jerusalem and the Jerusalem Development authority. This HUJI Hi-Tech Park will enable research and daily scientific ties between the University’s researchers and the forefront of advanced industry in Israel. Here students and alumni of the Hebrew University from the fields of engineering, exact sciences, computer sciences and data sciences as well as students from many additional fields will be able to study and work together. This step will lead and advance hi-tech industry in Jerusalem and provide many employment opportunities in Jerusalem. This Park has already stirred much interest among leading hi-tech companies as well as companies that are just starting out. We anticipate that in a few short years thousands of employees, researchers and students will come to the Hebrew University everyday to work in the HUJI Hi-Tech Park while based on breakthrough research generated on the Hebrew University’s campus”.\n\nAgainst the background of ground-breaking activity in the fight against the corona virus, this morning the President of the State, Mr. Reuven Rivlin, visited the research laboratories (in the Edmond and Lily Safra Brain Sciences Center). The tour took place on the Edmond J. Safra Campus, accompanied by the President of the Hebrew University, Prof. Asher Cohen, and the Vice President for Advancement and External Relations, Mr. Yossi Gal.\n\nRecently the Hebrew University’s researchers together with additional researchers made ground-breaking progress in the fight against the corona virus. They developed a new and more efficient method for corona screening, based on materials that for the most part are available in Israel and significantly cheaper, and screen at a higher speed. This achievement enabled the testing laboratory of the Hadassah Hospital and the Hebrew University to carry out over 100,000 tests thus far.\n\nRead More\n\nThe President told the researchers that he is aware of the fact that the research being competitive is a positive engine for success but he added: “Today I meet with you, our best brains in the Hebrew University, and recently I met with our best brains in the Biological Institute. I also held such meetings in Ichiilov, also in Soroka, and I must tell you friends, you are not in competition with each other, and this is not a race in which one must be first. We are in a marathon and if we don’t all reach the goal, we will find ourselves in great difficulty. Reach out for joint research. Only professionals can do that. We will overcome, but please – let us join together, that will certainly be faster.”\n\nThe President of the Hebrew University, Prof. Asher Cohen said: “ Today we presented to the President of the State of Israel, a graduate of the Hebrew University, a small part of the break-through research being carried out in the University. Research and science being carried out in Israel, and in Jerusalem in particular, are the pride of Israel and the factors that drive the Israeli economy to the forefront of innovation and world entrepreneurship. The corona crisis strongly emphasizes the importance of scientific research and its results in Israel and around the world and the need to invest in resources to advance it.”\n\nRead Less"
