        "text": "Mary Magdalene is a featured character in Jesus Christ Superstar. A former prostitute, Mary is now one of Jesus’ supporters, but is scared to admit that she has fallen in love with him.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nGentle, warm, and caring, Mary is the opposite of the archetypical “fallen woman”. She’s the peacemaker of the apostles. Her calm and steady demeanor conceals a passionate and intense personality, one that she only expresses when she is alone.\n\nAs with most of the cast, Mary is often defined by her relationship with Jesus. She clearly cares about him, trying to soothe him when things begin to get out of hand. She reveals that she has fallen in love with him and doesn’t know how to deal with the whirlwind of emotions that comes with it. She has a strained relationship with Judas; he is jealous of her relationship with Jesus, but she doesn’t understand why he hates her so much. Out of the apostles, Mary is shown to be closest to Peter.\n\nRole[]\n\nMary’s first speaking appearance is during “What’s The Buzz”, when she enters and asks Jesus if she can cool down his face with an ointment. When Jesus seems to reciprocate her affection, Judas, jealous of Mary, brings up her past as a prostitute. Jesus is unfazed and defends her (Strange Thing Mystifying). After witnessing the two come to blows, Mary attempts to calm down Jesus, telling him that everything will be fine in the long run. Judas again attacks Mary, this time lamenting how expensive the ointment she’s using is and saying she could’ve used that money to help the poor. Jesus once again defends her, telling Judas that they can’t help everyone and that Mary did nothing wrong. Mary continues, usually in vain, to try to calm Jesus (Everything’s Alright).\n\nMary’s next appearance is during “Hosanna”, joining Jesus, the apostles, and Jesus’ followers in a makeshift parade celebrating him as their leader. Mary often dances during the following song, “Simon Zealotes”. When Jesus tells his followers that they don’t understand what’s about to happen, Mary is confused and frightened (Poor Jerusalem).\n\nLater, after Jesus’ encounter with the lepers, Mary attempts to calm him as he falls asleep. She reflects on her love for Jesus and her fear that comes with it, as these are emotions that she doesn’t feel equipped to handle (I Don’t Know How To Love Him).\n\nIn some productions (such as the Regent’s Park version), Mary will be present at “The Last Supper” at Jesus’ side, deepening Judas’ jealousy of her closeness to him further. She doesn’t understand Jesus’ declarations of denial, betrayal, and death; instead, she’s only further scared of what will happen to Jesus. If she’s present at the Supper, she will eventually fall asleep with the other apostles and be awakened during Jesus’s capture by the Roman soldiers. She joins Peter in his exclamations that he and the apostles will protect Jesus from the soldiers, but Jesus tells them to stop and let the arrest take place (The Arrest). Her and Peter wind up separated from the other apostles and Peter is recognized by multiple people as one of Jesus’ followers. Peter, trying to protect himself, denies the claims, but Mary tells him that he should’ve admitted to it since he was saying earlier that he’d fight for Jesus (Peter’s Denial).\n\nIn some versions (like the 2000 TV Film), Mary is present at Jesus’ first appearance before Pilate, crying out when Pilate announces he’s going to send Jesus to King Herod (Pilate And Christ). After Jesus is mocked by Herod, Mary and Peter wish that they could start over and make sure that Jesus is safe (Could We Start Again, Please?).\n\nThe rest of Mary’s appearances vary by production. For example, in the 1973 Film and the Regent’s Park staging, Mary (alongside Peter) will witness Jesus’ trial and eventual sentencing before Pilate. The 1973 Film also has her weeping as Jesus is crucified.\n\nOther Names[]"
