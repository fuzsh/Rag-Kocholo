        "text": "My 8th great-grandmother Marie Madeleine Bourgery was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec on July 22, 1652.\n\nThe pages of the parish record book in the decade before her birth tell the story of the Roman Catholic Church’s mission in New France.\n\nIt contains page after page after page of baptisms of Indigenous children — the entries labelled the likes of “Bapteme de Marie Sauvagesse” and “Bapteme de Philippe Sauvage.”\n\nBy the 1650s, the priest is baptizing the children of the growing number of French settlers.\n\nMadeleine’s parents were Jean Baptiste Bourgery and Marie Legendre. They were from the western port city of La Rochelle and arrived in New France in 1652, the year of Madeleine’s birth, with their son Pierre.\n\nGiven the timing of the arrival of the ships from France, Marie must have been in the late stages of her pregnancy during the voyage.\n\nJean Baptiste died five years later on the 10th of November, leaving Marie with three small children. On January 24th, notary Severin Ameau drew up a marriage contract for Marie and Florent Leclerc. All of the high society of Trois-Rivieres witnessed the document including Pierre Boucher, the civil and criminal administrator for the King. The couple was married on the 4th of February. Marie’s short-lived marriage to Florent would be the second of her four marriages.\n\nSometime in 1660, Madeleine Bourgery was kidnapped by the Iroquois and adopted into their society. She lived with an Indigenous family for six years, until she was ransomed by the Marquis de Tracy of the Carignan-Salieries Regiment.\n\nHe paid the tuition so that Madeleine, and a girl named Anne or Jeanne Baillargeon who had been taken captive around the same time, could stay at an Ursuline convent and be re-educated in the Catholic faith and the French way of life. The girls’ story is included in a book on the Ursulines written by two nuns in 1863.\n\nThere’s another twist to this story. There is much discussion about the identity of Madeleine’s fellow captive. It appears this Anne Baillargeon is the older sister of another one of my eighth great-grandmothers, Jeanne Baillargeon. I descend from Madeleine through my mother’s birth father’s line but descend from the Baillargeon family through my Aubuchon/Bourgeau/Kelly line.\n\nThe girls entered the convent in May 1666. While Madeleine had been living with the Iroquois, her mother Marie’s husband Florent had died. Madeleine did not stay long with the nuns and it’s not clear if she ever lived with her mother again.\n\nOn the 24nd of July, 1667 she signed a marriage contract with Jean Baune dit Lafranchise, a soldier in the Varennes company of the Carignan-Salieres Regiment.\n\nSome of the most powerful men in New France witnessed the document including the Marquis de Tracy, who had won Madeleine’s release from the Iroquois and Daniel de Remy de Courcelle, Sieur de Montigny, who was the Governor General of New France from 1665 to 1672.\n\nJean and Madeleine were married at Notre-Dame in Quebec City about a month later, on the 22nd of August. He was about 34-years-old. She was 15.\n\nThere were many powerful men at the couple’s marriage ceremony as well, including Pierre Boucher, the governor of Trois-Rivieres.\n\nJean was from the town of Bellenaves, west of Lyon in central France. He left La Rochelle with the Varennes Company on the 24th of May, 1665 aboard the ship “La Justice” and arrived in Quebec on the 14th of September. Six days later, the website Migrations.fr notes he received the scapular of Mont-Carmel at Quebec. This was a sign of devotion to the Virgin Mary. On the 2nd of June the following year (1666), Jean is stationed at Fort Sorel, where he received the sacrament of Confirmation along with several other soldiers. The list includes Pierre Salvaye, another one of my 8th great-grandfathers, who was a captain in the Froment/Sorel Company.\n\nJean and Madeleine had nine children. I descend from their fourth child Jean on my mother’s birth father’s line.\n\nEight months after the birth of their son Antoine Francois, Jean died suddenly on the morning of the 24th of January, 1687. The priest from the parish of Ste-Anges-de-Lachine makes note of this in the burial record and says Jean had been paralysed on one side of his body for several years. He was about 54-years-old.\n\nMadeleine was left with five children under the age of 10.\n\nOn the 5th of August, 1689, about 15-hundred Mohawk warriors attacked the settlement in what is now known as the Lachine Massacre. They burned a substantial portion of the structures and killed or captured an unknown number of inhabitants, with the death toll ranging from 24 to 250.\n\nA letter written four days later by two Ursuline nuns from the Congregation of Notre-Dame describes how several women and girls from the upper part of the parish took shelter in the Fort — and one of them was Madeleine Bourgery, widow of Jean Baune dit Lafranchise. The nuns wrote that they noticed Madeleine had managed to salvage from the fire two old blankets, a medium size pig, and a piglet.\n\nLater that year, on the 2nd of December, 1689 Madeleine married Jacques Chasle, a soldier in the French Marines, which despite its name was a land-based unit.\n\nAs you can see a long list of his fellow soldiers witnessed the marriage, including the commander of the fort at Lachine. A name caught my eye as I read the record — Le Comte de Frontenac, gouveneur general du Canada. It appears the marriage was made with his permission and that of the vicar general of Montreal.\n\nJacques and Madeleine had three children. And in yet another twist to this story, I also descend from a child of this marriage — their youngest son Jean — again on my Mom’s birth father’s line.\n\nJacques died on the 6th of April, 1733 in Pointe-Claire at the age of 65.\n\nMadeleine died on the 18th of February, 1741.\n\nThe priest gave her age as about 100-years — advanced by even today’s standards — but amazing considering all she endured."
