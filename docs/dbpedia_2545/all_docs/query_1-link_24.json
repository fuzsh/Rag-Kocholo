Marie-Madeleine does not, however, care about these false judgments. She forgives unconditionally, from where emanates a beautiful and sweet energy. His significant role with Jesus, as described in the Gospels, shows him washing his feet, as the witness of his death, as well as one of the first people to whom he appears after his resurrection. Among the other roles which are the subject of controversy and which she could have held with Jesus, there is in particular that of the wife of Christ, that of a priestess of the Temple or else of a disciple.Invoke it to help you forgive and open your heart more to love.\n\nAromatic synergy created by Mikaël Zayat\n\nThis aromatic blend helps strengthen the chemistry between matter and spirit.
