        "text": "Mother Mary and Mary Magdalene are particularly close within the holy family that is the ‘communion of saints’ mentioned in the Creed. They were the two women Jesus was closest to in his life: his mother and possibly his closest disciple. Mary Magdalene’s special closeness to Jesus is expressed powerfully in the canonical gospels’ accounts of his resurrection. All four Gospels agree that she was among the first to witness the resurrection (and they don’t agree on very much). In John and Mark, Jesus appears first to her alone, in Matthew to her and one other woman, in Luke she is with a group of women and only hears about the resurrection from two angels, who show them the empty tomb. She is always named first when there are lists of women disciples.\n\nIn Matthew, Mark, and John she is sent to proclaim the good news to the other disciples. This is what makes her an “apóstolos”, the Greek term for \"one who is sent out\". At least as early as the 2nd century C.E., Mary Magdalene is therefore called ‘the apostle to the apostles’.\n\nHer special place in the heart of Jesus is also discussed in apocryphal gospels. In the Gospel of Mary, Levi, one of the disciples, says: “He loved her more than us” (p.18) and Peter says: “Sister, we know that the Savior loved you more than all other women.” (p.10)\n\nDid Jesus therefore want Mary Magdalene to be the sole or top leader of the Church after his ascension, to take his place as the head of the Church? It’s not impossible, but top leadership meant something completely different to him than what it means in our world. As he says in Mark 10:42-44: “…those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones make their authority over them felt. But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant; whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all.”\n\nSo it is conceivable that in Jesus’ mind Mary Magdalene was the head of his Church, but few noticed, because she truly lived his teachings, was “the least among them”, and “did not make her authority felt” in any other way than to love, serve, and uplift all. And that is precisely how she is portrayed in the Gospel of Mary: loving and uplifting all the disciples: “Then Mary arose, embraced them all, (or “tenderly kissed them” as an earlier Greek fragment says)¹ and began to speak … Thus Mary turned their hearts toward the Good.” p.9\n\nIndependent of where we fit the two Marys within the hierarchy of Jesus’ communion of saints and keeping in mind that we are called to throw our whole concept of hierarchy out if we want to follow Jesus, we can certainly affirm that both Marys were models of the Christian and the contemplative life. I think it is safe to say, they reached its pinnacle: divine union, or what Catholics call ‘divinization’. That amazing word listed in the subject index of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and explained in article 460 with this quote by Athanasius: “The Son of God became human so that we may become God.” Both Marys have become one with and part of God, an expression of its feminine face. And we are all called to do the same.\n\nEven if we can regard them as two equal expressions of the feminine face of God, our hearts may be drawn differently, at different times, or more strongly to one or the other. That’s okay, because there are different kinds of love. There is the passionate love of a devotee to his or her particular Gate to Heaven, his or her favorite saint or person of the Holy Trinity, and there is the love we are called to have for our entire holy family: our fellow travelers on the Way here below and all the saints in Heaven.\n\nThe first, the passionate love of a devotee, is a more exclusive one-on-one thing. The second, the love for our holy family, is a group thing where we are called to be a ‘communion of saints’ as the Creed says, and one mystical body of Christ, as the Bible says.²\n\nTo me it is essential to make time and space for both kinds of love. When we pray, it is often good to focus on one object of devotion. And sometimes it is also important to not be stingy with our love and appreciation, but to spread it around to other saints or even other persons of the trinity.\n\nAnd then yes, sometimes we may sit down to pray and wonder who to turn to. Then it’s time to slow down, listen to our hearts, noticing what our souls want. Check in with yourself: Do I need the warmth of my divine Mother right now, the cool breeze of the Father, or the support of a particular older brother or sister on the Way? Who wants to come to me right now? Do I feel oppressed by patriarchy (which happens to women and men!) and need someone like Mary Magdalene, who knows what that’s like and isn’t part of it?\n\nIt is not so much that we need to choose between the Marys, it’s that sometimes we need to choose between either listening to our minds, our mental habits, or to our hearts and souls, the promptings of the Spirit. Many people have had the experience that it wasn’t them choosing a Mary, but that a Mary (or another saint or archetype) came to them, chose them. Our choice then is between welcoming and consenting or turning away. That reminds me of a good friend of mine: the first time she had a vision of Jesus during a meditation with me, she told him: “Sorry, you got the wrong address; I’m Jewish!” She eventually learned to welcome him. Please let’s try to welcome the Spirit, even when it shows up as the deity or preferred saint of a group of people, we consider our adversaries.\n\nSometimes there are conflicting wants and needs in us. Rather than struggling to decide between them, it’s infinitely easier to take them to prayer. For example, maybe your heart needs a divine mother, but your mind says Mother Mary is a collaborator with a patriarchal Church you’d rather keep a safe distance from. Then just ask her: “What do you have to say for yourself Mary? How do I do this? Please show me the way.” And then listen for a response. Give her and yourself time.\n\n(My opinion on that problem is that yes, the Virgin Mary has been used by the Church to suppress women, just like Jesus has been used to oppress others, but that’s not their fault. They have done their best to challenge existing structures, but it is not their job to undo free will; they can’t force change, they can only call for it and hope someone will hear.)\n\nAnother example: maybe your heart needs your sexuality to be embraced and integrated into your spiritual path, but your mind says it’s disrespectful, dirty, historically and politically incorrect to look to Mary Magdalene (and maybe even Jesus) for help with this. Then ask Magdalene (and maybe Jesus): “What do I do? How do I do this? Can you help me?”\n\nWhen we start to open to a new saint, we may not be immediately ready to put them center stage during any particular prayer time. That’s okay. Maybe invite them to be at your side for now. You can pray to one saint with another one at your side.\n\nIt is important to know that there is no jealousy or competition among the saints or the persons of the trinity. By praying to one, we automatically receive the blessings and graces of all and all of them are happy. For, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church (article 947) says: “Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is communicated to the others.”\n\nTragically, most of Mary Magdalene’s relationship with Jesus is left out of Biblical accounts. Here is the little bit we are told.\n\nA couple of times the Bible lists women, who followed Jesus with his disciples and \"provided for them out of their resources\". (Matthew 27:56, Mark 15:40) Even the most conservative Catholic organizations like Sensus Fidelium, admit: “Mary Magdalene holds a place among the women similar to Simon Peter in that even as Simon Peter is always mentioned first in the list of the apostles, so Mary Magdalene is mentioned first in groups of women where she is present.”[viii]\n\nThis is where Luke mentions that Jesus freed her from seven demons (Luke 8:2). It has often been assumed that she had therefore been especially sinful or possessed, but don’t we all have at least seven hindrances between us and complete divine union? And couldn’t we therefore shift the emphasis from her being especially sinful to being especially liberated from anything that may have stood between her and God? Then we can see her not as someone still tainted by a shadowy past, but as a woman who was particularly blessed and freed.\n\nMary Magdalene’s honorary title \"the apostle to the apostles\" is based on the Gospels of Matthew and John, where Jesus picked her to be the first person to whom he revealed himself after his resurrection and whom he sent to tell the good news to the other disciples.\n\nAll four gospels agree (which is rare) that Mary Magdalene was the first person to receive the Good News that Jesus rose from the dead. In Matthew 27:55-28:18 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph are the only ones keeping watch at Jesus' tomb all night. Then they go home for one night, only to return early the next morning, before dawn. An angel greets them at the empty tomb, tells them that Jesus has risen and commands them to run to the disciples and tell them where to meet Jesus. The two Marys are \"fearful yet overjoyed\". As they are running to do what they were told, Jesus appears to them. The women \"approached, embraced his feet, and did him homage.\" (MT 28:9) He repeats the same message the angel had already given them: go and tell the others where to meet me. The other disciples meet Jesus in the designated place, worship him duly, but (unlike the women) they doubt.\n\nMark 15:40 - 16:13 tells the story similarly: first “a young man … clothed in a long white garment” told Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome that Jesus was risen and sent the three to tell his disciples where to meet him. Then Jesus himself appears to Mary Magdalene alone. Mark puts more emphasis on the male disciples' disbelief. They do not believe Mary Magdalene that Jesus rose from the dead, nor do they believe two other men who later report the same thing. For this they get a stern reprimand from the risen Christ: “Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen. … And he said: “…Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.” (MK 16:14-16)\n\nJohn mentions Mary Magdalene as standing under the cross with the other two Marys (See article: Mother Mary and the Bible) and gives the most beautiful account of her being the first disciple the risen Jesus appears (Jn 20:1-18). She comes alone to the tomb in the dark before dawn and finds it empty. She runs to Peter and the other apostles to report that “they have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.” The men run to the tomb, inspect it, and return home. But Mary Magdalene stays there and cries so hard that she doesn't recognize Jesus when he speaks to her until he calls her by her name: \"Mary!\" Then she immediately exclaims: \"Rabbouni!\" which means, my teacher, or my master. Apparently, she flings herself at him and wants to hold on to him, because he warns her saying: \"Stop holding on to me, (Others translate: \"Don't touch me!\") for I have not yet ascended to the Father.\"\n\nKayleen Asbo, a great expert in everything to do with Mary Magdalene, has pointed out that many Biblical scholars have long drawn parallels between the resurrection account in the Gospel of John and the Song of Songs in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). This erotic love song between a searching bride and her lost beloved has been cherished within the mystical tradition as a Christian allegory of the soul longing for divine union since the 4th century (see the writings of Origen, Bernard of Clairvaux , John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila on this subject).\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis elevated Mary Magdalene’s memorial to a feast day. On that occasion Archbishop Arthur Roche, secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, explained the meaning of the decree that will enable Mary Magdalene to be celebrated liturgically like the rest of the apostles.” The decree also instructs the Church that this passage from the Song of Songs be included in the liturgy, as it had been in the 8th century within the Celtic Christian church:\n\n“All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him. I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him. The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. “Have you seen the one my heart loves?” Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go” (3:1-4)\n\nLuke’s Gospel is problematic when it comes to Mary Magdalene, because, as Ann Graham Brock shows convincingly in her book Mary Magdalene, the First Apostle: the Struggle for Authority[ix], this evangelist does everything he can to bolster the authority of Peter and diminish hers. He leaves out the part where Jesus sends her to proclaim his resurrection, presumably because that would make her not just an Apostle, “one sent by Jesus to proclaim the Good News”, but the Apostle to the Apostles. Instead, he depicts Mary Magdalene receiving the news at the tomb together with a bunch of other women, from “two men in dazzling garments” (24:4). The women take it upon themselves to tell “the eleven and all the others” (24:9); they are not commissioned by Heaven. In Luke’s Gospel, the first mention of any disciples encountering the resurrected Christ is in the story of Jesus’ appearance to two of them on the road to Emmaus. At the end of that, he slips in a little sentence one almost misses: “The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!” (24:34) He has no story to back this claim up with, because, it seems, at this point in the sequence of events transmitted to Luke, there was none.\n\nApocryphal gospels are those that were not admitted into the Bible. Since they were suppressed, only fragments and damaged copies have been found so far. Words in [square brackets] mark holes in the manuscript that were filled in by scholars' best guesses. Empty brackets [ ] mean no guesses can be made; too much is missing.\n\nMary Magdalene figures prominently in \"the Gospel of Philip\", \"the Gospel of Mary\", and in the \"Dialogue of the Savior\". In all three she is presented as his favorite, most enlightened disciple. But that does not at all mean that she is unanimously revered by the disciples. On the contrary, every gospel speaks of conflict surrounding her. The apocryphal gospels are particularly clear that this is because of some of the male disciples’ (particularly Peter’s) jealousy and disrespect for women. Gender conflicts are talked about explicitly. They get patched up temporarily but not really resolved.\n\nSo much for Dan Brown and all those people who want to believe that the first Christians were free of such conflict and that the urge to suppress women in general and Mary Magdalene in particular only came later when the Roman Catholic church established itself as an institution of the Roman Empire. Certainly, the Emperor Constantine was no help for women's liberation, but even while Jesus was alive, most of his male disciples could not follow him in his egalitarian treatment of the other sex.\n\nThe canonical (biblical) gospels don't delve as deeply into the gender conflict, though they mention jealousy and competitiveness even among the male disciples. Concerning the apostles' feelings about Mary Magdalene, they only mention that the male disciples didn't believe her that Jesus had risen. But then they don't believe men either³, and not even Jesus himself. As the Gospel of Matthew says about their encounter with the risen Jesus on the mountain in Galilee, to which he had ordered them: “When they saw him, they worshipped, but they doubted.” (Mt 28:17)\n\nThe apocryphal gospels themselves are not unanimously or uniformly pro-feminine. E.g. the Gospel of Thomas ends like this:\n\n\"Simon Peter said to him, 'Mary should leave us, for women are not worthy of the Life.' Yeshua (Jesus) answered: This is how I will guide her so that she becomes Man. She too, will become a living breath like you Men. Any woman who will make herself a Man will enter into the Kingdom of God.\"⁴\n\nSome say that this passage contradicts earlier statements in the Gospel of Thomas and was therefore probably added by a later redactor. They are referring to verse 22: \"Yeshua answered them: When you make the two into One, when you make the inner like the outer and the high like the low; when you make male and female into a single One, so that the male is ot male and the female is not female; when you have eyes in your eyes, a hand in your hand, a foot in your foot, and an icon in your icon, then you will enter [the Kingdom].\"⁵\n\n\"The Dialogue of the Savior\", while granting Mary a place of special honor, also equates \"femaleness\" with inferiority, worldliness, and obstacles to the spiritual path. It says 144:15-21:\n\n\"When we pray, how should we pray? The Lord said, 'Pray in the place where there is [no] woman.' Matthew said, 'He says to us, 'Pray in the place where there is [no] woman,' ... 'Destroy [the] works of femaleness,' not because she is another [...], but so that they (the works) will cease [from you].\"⁶\n\nThe Gospels of Philip and of Mary both recount the jealousy of the male disciples because Jesus loved Mary more than them and revealed things to her that he didn't reveal to them.\n\nThe Gospel of Mary includes an account of what Jesus said to her in a vision. Peter had asked her for this account saying (in 10:1-5): \"Sister, we know that the Savior loved you more than the rest of women. Tell us the words of the Savior which you remember - which you know (but) we do not, nor have we heard them.\"\n\nBut when she finishes:\n\n\"Andrew answered and said to the brethren, 'Say what you (wish to) say about what she has said. I at least do not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are strange ideas.' Peter answered and spoke concerning these same things. He questioned them about the Savior: 'Did he really speak privately with a woman (and) not openly to us? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?' Then Mary wept and said to Peter, 'My brother Peter, what do you think? Do you think that I thought this up myself in my heart, or that I am lying about the Savior?' Levi answered and said to Peter, 'Peter, you have always been hot-tempered. Now I see you contending against the woman like the adversaries. But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her very well. That is why he loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect man, and separate, as he commanded us and preach the gospel, not laying down any other rule or other law beyond what the Savior said.' When [...] and they began to go forth [to] proclaim and to preach.\" (17:10-end of gospel)\n\nThe Gospel of Philip 63:31-10 states:\n\n\"And the companion of the S[avior is] Mary Magdalene ... her more than ... the disciples ... kiss her ... on her ... The rest of ... they said to him, 'Why do you love her more than all of us?' The Savior answered them, 'Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness.' \" -- Apparently Mary Magdalene was far more enlightened than the other disciples.\n\nPeople fill in the gaps in the text according to the context, which suggests that Jesus kissed her on the mouth. They read: \"The Savior loved her more than all the disciples and used to kiss her often on her mouth.\"\n\nBut even if Jesus often kissed her on the mouth, one still cannot assume that they also had sexual intercourse. Four chapters earlier Philip speaks about kissing on the mouth as a ritual act of being born or \"begotten\" spiritually of Jesus:\n\n\"[Those who] are begotten by him [cry out] from that place to the (perfect) man [because they are nourished] on the promise [concerning] the heavenly [place. ...] from the mouth, [because if] the word has gone out from that place it would be nourished from the mouth and it would become perfect. For it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give birth (to their spiritual selves). For this reason we also kiss one another. We receive conception from the grace which is in each other.\" 58:30-59:5\n\nSounds like they all kissed each other on the mouth. Were they all married to each other? Were they advocating same sex and group marriage?! Of course not. At least during the first five hundred years of Christianity kissing each other on the mouth was part of celebrating the ritual of the Eucharist (or \"last supper\") even within the main stream Church. It is refered to in the biography of Mary of Egypt (More on her below). The ancient text describes this extremely chaste and humble hermitess receiving the Eucharist the night before her death: \"After the prayer has been spoken, she kisses the priest, as is the custom, on the mouth, receives the holy mysteries and says...\" (Gertrude and Thomas Sartory: Maria von Aegypten - Allmacht der Busse, Herder Taschenbuch, 1982, p.55)\n\nIt is true that the Gospel of Philip continues for 13 pages to talk about the great mystery of marriage and the original unity of man and woman in the first human (before the female aspect was separated out). It says that: \"Christ came to repair the separation which was from the beginning and again unite the two\". (70:15) But it also speaks about the mystery of the \"bridal chamber\" in a very confusing, obscure, and esoteric way, suggesting that it far exceeds anything an ordinary person would associate with bridal chambers. E.g. in 74:19-20: \"He who has been anointed possesses everything. He possesses the resurrection, the light, the cross, the Holy Spirit. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber;\" And in verse 67 it says: \"It is from water and fire and light that the son of the bridal chamber (came into being). (...) The Lord [did] everything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal chamber.\" The Gospel of Thomas 50:15 refers to the \"bridal chamber\" as the place (this earth) where the bridegroom, Jesus, gets to be with his bride, the disciples.\n\nThe gospel of Philip does seem to suggest that Jesus found a deep spiritual union with Mary Magdalene which he deemed extremely important, but which might have been purely spiritual. For he says in 65:30 - 66:5:\n\n\"He who comes out of the world can no longer be detained because he was in the world. It is evident that he is above desire and fear. (...) Fear not the flesh, nor love it. If you fear it, it will gain mastery over you. If you love it, it will swallow and paralyze you.\" And (76:9): \"in the aeon the form of the union is different, although we refer to them by the same names.\" (78:30-79:2): \"So spirit mingles with spirit, and thought consorts with thought. (...) If you become light, it is the light which will share with you.\" (82:4-8) \"If there is a hidden quality to the marriage of defilement, how much more is the undefiled marriage a true mystery. It is not fleshly but pure. It belongs not to desire but to the will.\"\n\nSome people claim that 'companion', the title given to Mary Magdalene in the Gospel of Philip, was an equivalent to 'wife'. Yet \"The Book of Thomas the Contender\", also contained in the Nag Hammadi Library, bestows the same title on Thomas. In 138:6-10 Jesus says: \"Now since it has been said that you are my twin and true companion, examine yourself that you may understand who you are, in what way you exist, and how you will come to be.\"\n\nIt seems to me that if Mary and Jesus were married in the ordinary, \"defiled\" way (as the Gospel of Philip would call it), the disciples wouldn't have been so baffled why he would love her more than them and why he would say things to her that he didn't say to others. Wouldn't patriarchs love to explain her special status away by saying it grew out of her marriage to Jesus? Isn't it much more of a challenge to patriarchal thinking to have to acknowledge that she was that special in and of herself and that Jesus appreciated her fully without using her for himself in any way?\n\nI’m not sure we do her a favor by cleaning her up. Christian theology is quite used to its Biblical saints having a messy past. It celebrates that this makes them real and means all of us with our messy past and present still have a chance of becoming saints. The fact that the Gospels are full of embarrassing details about conflict even among the inner group and about Jesus’ frequent frustration with his disciples is taken as proof that they are real eyewitness accounts.[i] The cleaner Magdalene becomes, the less real she is to me.\n\nPope Gregory does not clean her up and yet he has nothing but praise for her who: “has completely consumed in her the rust of sin, because it is all burning with the fire of love. (…) It is therefore very well that this woman represents us [all converted pagans], so long as we return with all our heart to the Lord after having sinned and that we imitate the tears of her penance. As for perfume, what does it express, if not the smell of a good reputation? Hence the word of Paul: ‘We are in every place for God the good odor of Christ’ (2 Cor 2: 15). If, therefore, we do good works, which imbue the Church with a good odor by making it speak good, what are we doing but pouring perfume on the body of the Lord?”\n\nThe people he scorns are “certain bishops” who make him “groan” with exasperation. He compares them to the arrogant pharisee in the Bible story, who judges even Jesus for allowing the sinful woman to touch him. He talks at length about how hopelessly lost people like the pharisee are, who are blind to their own sinfulness.\n\nHe is also hard on “unbelieving Jews”, who like the pharisee don’t think they need Jesus. For Magdalene however, he has nothing but the highest praise and holds her up as the ideal Christian:\n\n“In what esteem must the Truth hold the works of this sinful but penitent woman, to enumerate them to her adversary with such a luxury of precision! The Lord was at the table of the Pharisee but reveled in the nourishment of the soul with the penitent woman. … The penitent woman, therefore, nourished the Lord within, with a more substantial nourishment than that provided by the Pharisee outside …. So bring back the eyes of your mind on you, dear brothers, yes, on you, and propose to imitate the example of this penitent sinner. Cry all the faults you remember to have committed both in your adolescence and in your youth; wash by your tears the stains of your manners and works. Let us now love the feet of our Redeemer, whom we have despised by sinning. Behold, as we have said, the bosom of heavenly mercy opens to receive us without contempt for our corrupt life. “\n\nIf not Pope Gregory the Great, who then is to blame for the side lining of Magdalene? In my opinion, first of all the evangelists, including Paul, who wrote her out of the story as much as they could. Secondly, those men who changed the earliest accounts, literally rewriting what was salvation history for all into a story primarily for men.\n\nThirdly, those early ‘Church Fathers’ who refused to include the Gospel of Mary into the canon or into Catholic tradition, even though nothing in it was declared heretical and it was widely read and respected. Let me explain a bit more about that.\n\nThe Gospel of Mary (discovered in Egypt in 1896) was written in the 2nd Century CE, probably by somebody in the ‘Johannine community’ that grew around John the evangelist. The Wikipedia article on the Gospel of Mary quotes three prominent scholars on the subject, who date the text to the early part of the 2nd Century (Karen King), the middle (Christopher Tuckett) or the second half (Anne Pasquier). Likely it was written or at least became widely known after the canon of the New Testament had already been settled upon by common usage. This happened in the early 2nd century, though the New Testament canon didn’t become more formally ratified until the 4th century by people like Athanasius in his 39th Festal Letter written in 367 CE.\n\nAnother formative text, 2nd century A.D. Protevangelium of James, simply missed the boat of making it into the canon.[ii] Could it be that the same was true for the Gospel of Mary? Some things speak for this:\n\n1. It was never directly condemned as heretical. In the early 3rd century, the church historian Eusebius of Caesarea compiled a list of texts which were deemed heretical. The Gospel of Mary is not included on this list. Again, in the 5th century, a similar list was compiled and her gospel was not on it, this time by Pope Gelasius (reigned 492-496) in the 5th chapter of his Gelasian Decree which records “distrusted and rejected works not encouraged by the Church”.\n\n2. It was widely read and respected between the 2nd and 5th centuries. Karen King makes this claim based on the fact that we have early fragments in two languages, Coptic and Greek, and that fragments were found in three separate finds, more than any other apocryphal gospel. The oldest fragment of the Gospel of Mary found so far is from the early 3rd century.\n\n3. It is very significant that no one dared to openly criticize the Gospel of Mary. Many works, including the Revelation of John/the Apocalypse were hotly debated and slandered in the early Church, but never the Gospel of Mary. Only by grouping it unnamed with ‘all other so-called gospels’ that weren’t the four in the canon, was it able to be suppressed.\n\nWhy then did the Protoevangelium of James become part of Catholic tradition and some of it even dogma sixteen centuries later,[iii] but not the Gospel of Mary? The answer lies in one word: patriarchy. It’s not hard to figure out. The gospel itself tells us that Peter questioned: “Did he [Jesus] really speak secretly with a woman and not openly so that we all might hear? Are we all going to turn around [“change our {patriarchal} customs” in Leloup’s translation] and listen to her?”[iv] Remember, these are the same men who marveled that Jesus would even talk to a woman who wasn’t his kin. (See Jn 4:27, the story of Samaritan woman at the well.)\n\nPatriarchy teaches fear of equality, fear of losing power and status, fear of being subjugated by the other sex, by one’s spouse. Any public honoring of women and especially any time a woman did something a man couldn’t, men felt “put to shame”. As St. Jerome (late 4th century) says in the preface to his commentary to the Book of Zephaniah: “the risen lord appeared first to women, and those women were apostles to the apostles [apostolorum . . . apostolas], so that the men were put to shame for not having sought out the lord, whom the weaker sex had already found.[v]\n\nAnd so it was only the courageous and humble men, those who were obedient to the Holy Spirit even to the point of death of their male egos, slain by love, in other words, the saints, who could praise Mary of Magdala without reservations. Here are some examples of the praises they sang.\n\nIn countless depictions of the crucifixion since the Middle Ages, Mary Magdalene is portrayed as the one closest to the cross of Christ, her whole body and soul draped around it, in closer union with Jesus than even his mother and St. John, who stand near (See 3 more examples below under the subheading Dan Brown’s “the Da Vinci Code”).\n\nSince Mary Magdalene was equated not only with the “sinful woman” but also with Mary of Bethany, who sat at the feet of Jesus while her sister Martha exhausted herself in the kitchen, she was able to become the patron saint of contemplatives. And so it is no surprise that the paramount medieval book on Christian contemplation, the 14th century “Cloud of Unknowing” (anonymous) has much so say about Mary Magdalene. “Mary is the [proto]type of contemplatives, that they should match their lives with hers.”[vii] The author argues that she shows that perfect humility and union with God cannot be reached by excessive focus on one’s sins, but only through a “secret and urgent love”.[viii] “Sweet indeed was that love between our Lord and Mary [Magdalene]. Much love had she for him. Much more had he for her. Whoever would really understand what passed between him and her (…) would find that her love for him was so heartfelt, that nothing less than himself could satisfy her.” And then the author points out that not even the angels of God could console her on Easter morning: “…she would not stop weeping for them, because she thought that whoever was seeking the King of angels would not stop for mere angels. (…) This is great love; indeed, surpassing love.”[ix]\n\nBridget of Sweden (c. 1303 – 23 July 1373) claimed that Jesus said to her: Three saints have been more pleasing to me than all others: Mary my mother, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdalene.” This same Bridget founded the order of the Bridgettines and insisted that an \"abbess, signifying the Virgin Mary, should preside over both nuns and monks (of the monastery she founded).\" [x]\n\nCatherine of Siena (1347 – 1380) called Mary Magdalene her spiritual mother.\n\nSt. Francis de Sales (1567 – 1622) preached: “We can therefore rightly appoint her [St. Mary Magdalene] as the queen of all Christians and children of the Church, … Saint Magdalene is queen of the righteous; for what could make her more righteous than this ‘dilection’ (French: pure, spiritual love), joined with her great humility and compunction that always made her be at the feet of the Savior?”[xi]\n\nAnd then finally in 2016, Pope Francis elevated Mary Magdalene’s memorial to a feast day and the Vatican’s press office explained: “the decree will enable Mary Magdalene to be celebrated liturgically like the rest of the apostles.”[xii]\n\nThe next step would be to acknowledge that she actually was an apostle like the other apostles and may have been among the 72 whom Jesus sent out after the first 12. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the 72 apostles were all men. On the contrary, in his letter to the Romans 16:7 Paul says: „Greet Andronicus and Junia ... who are of note among the Apostles and were in Christ before I was.” Later commentators and editors of the Bible turned the woman Junia into a man Junius, but the early Christians knew she was a woman. E.g. John Chrysostom, who died in 407 A.D. wrote: “And indeed to be apostles at all is a great thing. But to be even among these of note, just consider what a great encomium this is! But they were of note owing to their works, to their achievements. Oh! How great is the devotion (or wisdom?)(φιλοσοφία) of this woman, that she should be even counted worthy of the appellation of apostle! But even here he does not stop, but adds another encomium besides, and says, Who were also in Christ before me.”[xiii]\n\nThings move very slowly from the bottom up in the Catholic Church. E.g. the assumption of Mary was first celebrated in the 4th century and didn’t become an official dogma until 1950! Let’s pray that now that we are outgrowing patriarchy and are in the world of a super-fast world wide web, maybe Mary Magdalene can be elevated further to her rightful place among the apostles. And more than that: Maybe the unnamed woman in the Gospel of Mark, of whom Jesus says: “And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole word, what she has done will be told in memory of her” (14:9) can finally be honored the way Jesus envisioned. And why not suppose she too was Mary Magdalene?! And then maybe the remaining pages of Mary’s Gospel can still be found, and it will be included in the sacred canon after all. May it be so!\n\nJewish custom did indeed dictate that a Rabbi had to be married and Jesus was called Rabbi on several occasions. But Jewish custom also said that once a man was married, he was not to speak to any women besides his wife and immediate family. Jesus, on the other hand, made a point of talking to many women and of not worrying too much about laws and customs. We know for sure that the apostle Paul was not married and even so, contrary to Jewish custom, did teach in synagogues. We also know that both, being married and being celibate were completely acceptable options for leaders in the early church.\n\nHence, we may never know for sure if Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and if they had children, but I don't think it makes nearly as much of a difference as Dan Brown suggests. Jesus' message doesn't hinge on that. But there certainly is a lot more evidence that Jesus was celibate than that he was married. To give only one example: in Matthew 19:11-12 Jesus says that forsaking marriage for the sake of the kingdom of God is a mystery many practice, but many others with inferior capacities cannot grasp.\n\nEven if Jesus had children, they wouldn't necessarily have been important. As he says in Mat 13:50, and in the other gospels: those who do the will of his heavenly father are his family. Certainly his apostles must have had children, but they are never mentioned anywhere. Remember, we are talking about religion here, and about the kingdom of God, not about worldly royal bloodlines and kingdoms who usually ended up with imbeciles because of inbreeding.\n\nOther religious founders had children who played no important role in history. Buddha's son wasn't particularly special and died at an early age. In Islam only the Shiite minority took Mohammed's bloodline into account when determining its leadership. Judaism certainly venerates its bloodline of patriarchs, yet the prophets whom God established as the spiritual leaders were independent of any bloodline. Lord Krishna, the Hindu god of love, must have had thousands of children because he is said to have had 16,000 queens, plus consorts! Yet I've never heard his children mentioned anywhere. Historically, only the leadership of the Bahai was passed from father to son. So it seems that spiritual enlightenment does not normally transfer with the DNA.\n\nBut if you're looking for divinity in someone's DNA, that's an easy find, because we're all created by God and in God's image by receiving His breath, i.e. spirit. Hence, it seems to me that the whole human race is of God's bloodline.\n\nConcerning the supposed motivation (according to \"The Da Vinci Code\") for concealing Jesus' marriage: Dan Brown says that it was the Catholic Church's effort to portray Jesus as purely divine and not human. Actually, the Church insisted from the start that Jesus was both human and divine.\n\nIt argued against the Gnostics who would take away from Jesus' humanness by saying that he didn't really suffer on the cross, because God doesn't suffer. It also argued against those who would diminish his divinity by teaching that Jesus started out as an ordinary human and only later became the Son of God.\n\nOnly it wasn't until the council of Ephesus (431 C.E.) that the Church could agree precisely how divine and how human Jesus Christ was at any given point in time, and how those \"two natures\" co-exist.\n\nIn my opinion the \"two natures of Christ\" are the very core and gem of Christianity. It is rare to find another religion that gives us permission to be, like Jesus, truly human and truly divine. Mystical Christianity does.\n\nRather than hurting the veneration of the \"divine feminine\", insisting that Jesus was \"truly human and truly divine\" from the moment of his conception, actually gave it a great boost. For it justified the veneration of the Virgin Mary as Mother of God.\n\nWhat is certainly true is that at a certain point the Church started suppressing anything that supported women's full participation in the Church. But that sharing of ministry and power did not depend on the supposed descendants of Mary Magdalene and Jesus. Rather it would have been quite sufficient to faithfully emulate Jesus and Paul (on a good day!). But instead, Jesus' own relationship with the many women in his life was ignored and to Paul's true letters, fake, misogynistic ones were added. (see: my article on \"Women of Spirit and Power in the Bible\", especially the section \"the Woman who Anointed Jesus\")\n\nAnd the Holy Grail? In the movie it is described as \"the source of God's power on earth\". - If Jesus is God's power on earth then Mary, his mother, could be seen as his source. Indeed, to me much of what the movie says about Mary Magdalene is more true about the Virgin Mary. Loius Charpentier in his book \"Les Mysteres de la Cathedrale de Chartres\" explains that the Knights Templar went to Jerusalem, not to seek the Holy Grail, but the Ark of the Covenant, which they hoped to find in the ruins of the Temple of Solomon. Charpentier says, that they certainly did find an esoteric knowledge and a source of power and wealth that enabled them suddenly to create gothic cathedrals. Maybe so, but along with that knowledge they found Black Madonnas (see my article) and they venerated their Dark Mothers in those cathedrals.\n\nFrom of old Mother Mary was given the title \"Ark of the Covenant\", because she was the vessel of the New Covenant: Jesus Christ. To her the Templars dedicated their order, their cathedrals, and their hearts."
