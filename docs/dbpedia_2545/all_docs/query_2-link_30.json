        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History of Madeleine\n\nThe baby name Madeline is a French and English term that originates from the Greek word Magdalene, meaning ‘of Magdala German.’ Magdala was the name of a Jewish city by Galilee’s seashore. It could also mean ‘an elevated tower.’ In German, Madeleine also means little girls, taken from the word Mädelein.\n\nThis name is associated with Saint Mary Magdalene of Galilee, one of Jesus’s followers in the New Testament, a title meaning ‘of Magdala.’ She was named so because she hailed from the village of Magdala, which in turn meant ‘tower.’ Saint Mary Magdalene is the “apostle of apostles” and is believed to have been the closest disciple of Jesus, who deeply understood the Gnostic texts. She was an independent and empathetic disciple who supported His ministry with her wealth of knowledge and riches. In addition, she was known for her leadership qualities, such as determination and her passion for serving mankind.\n\nAccording to the canonical gospels, Saint Magdalene witnessed the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, thus gaining some of the most mentions in the four gospels. In addition, the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and Protestant churches consider her a saint and heroine of the faith.\n\nThe name has several spelling variations in different cultures and languages. Some of them are Magdalena in German, Magdalen, Madeleine, Magdalena, and Madeline in English, Magdalena and Magdalina in Bulgarian, Malene, Magdalena, Magda, Lena in Danish, and Madalena and Magda in Portuguese.

According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
