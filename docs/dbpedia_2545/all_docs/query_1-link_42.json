        "text": "Since my youngest age, I have a special devotion to Mary Magdalene.\n\nI was born in St Maximin la Sainte Baume, the place where she is buried, at the foot of the Saint Baume mountain, where the grotto is where she spent the last years of her life.\n\nDriven out from Palestine, Mary Magdalene landed on the coast of Provence in 42AD, accompanied by Jesus’ close friends. She received the precious teachings of Jesus Himself, she was her favorite disciple. In the course of her long journey, she left her mark on the beginning of Christianity.\n\nJoin me on a sacred journey in the footsteps of Mary Magdalene. I invite you to meet the so-called Apostle to the Apostles in her many faces while visiting the sacred places full of her presence, even nowadays."
