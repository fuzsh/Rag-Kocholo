That is not correct, and the false concept can be harmful to an understanding of sufferers of the mental illness. It is more respectful and kinder to avoid using the adjective in this way. See also Wiktionary, which says\n\nThe informal use of this word (confusing the condition with multiple personality disorder) is discouraged to avoid stigmatization and misunderstanding of the disorder."
