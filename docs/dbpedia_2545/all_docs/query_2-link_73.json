She is eight years old. Her father has 15 cattle, 15 sheep, 8 pigs, 32 arpents of improved land and 1 gun4965,4966.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1698 Madeleine Landry is still living in Port Royal with her parents, three sisters Marie Josephe, Marguerite and Anne and two brothers Claude and Jean.

Her father has 10 cattle, 13 sheep, 8 pigs, 22 arpents of improved land, 3 fruit trees and 2 guns4922,4965.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1700 Madeleine Landry is at Port Royal with her parents, our sisters Marie, Marguerite, Marie Marguerite and Anne and two brothers Claude and Charles. She is fifteen years old. Her father has 12 cattle, 14 sheep, 32 arpents of improved land and 1 gun4965,4926.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1701 Madeleine Landry is living with her parents and four sisters Marie, Marguerite, Anne and Jeanne at Port Royal. She is seventeen years old. Her father has 19 cattle, 14 sheep, 10 pigs, 6 arpents of cultivated land and one gun4965,4967.\n\n____________________\n\nIn 1703 Madeleine Landry is censused at Port Royal as the wife of Abraham Dugas (“Abraham Dugats, sa femme”) with their daughter. The transcription of the census also lists them has having two sons; however, the figure ‘2’ appears to have been written into the space by someone other than the transcriber. It is uncertain if this figure ‘2’ is correct. The census lists one person other than Abraham Dugas capable of carrying arms - apparently this is Madeleine Landry, his wife4944,4938.\n\n____________________\n\nIn 1707 Madeleine Landry is censused at Port Royal as the wife of Abraham Dugas (“Abraham Dugast, et sa femme”). At this time they have one son less than 14 years of age and 2 daughters under 12 years of age. They also have 4 arpents of improved land, 12 cattle, 20 sheep, 12 pigs and 2 guns4944,4937.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1710 Abraham Dugas was at Port Royal with his 2 sons and 2 daughters4944,4946.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1714 Abraham Dugas is censused with his wife (“Abraham Dugas et sa femme”), 4 sons and 2 daughters at Port Royal near the fort4944,4942.\n\n____________________\n\nIn 1717 Abraham Dugas was at Île Royale with his wife and 4 sons. He had the ration of the King for one year4944,4947.\n\nQuestions/Errors notes for Marie-Madeleine LANDRY\n\nIn his first two editions on the genealogy of the Acadians Arsenault4930,4931 mistakenly cites Abraham Dugas, the husband of Marie-Madeleine Landry, as being the son of Abraham Dugas and Marguerite Doucet rather than the son of Martin Dugas and Marguerite Petitpas. He refers to the marriage of Marie-Madeleine Landry as being the second marriage of Abraham Dugas - the first marriage being to Jeanne Guilbaut. In fact, there were were two men in Acadia in the 1660-1680 timeframe named Abraham Dugas: (1) Abraham Dugas (born 1662), the son of Abraham Dugas and Marguerite Doucet, who abut 1686 married Jeanne Guilbaut, the daughter of Pierre Guilbaut and Catherine Terriot and (2) Abraham Dugas (born about 1678), the son of Martin Dugas and Marguerite Petitpas, who about 1702 married Marie-Madeleine Landry, daughter of Claude Landry and Marguerite Terriot. In the third edition of his work Arsenault4964 corrects this error.\n\nNames notes for Marie-Madeleine LANDRY\n\nMarie-Madeleine Landry\n\nMarie Magdeleine Landry\n\nMadeleine Landry\n\nMadelaine Landry\n\nMagdelene Landry\n\nMagdeleine Landry\n\nMagdelaine Landry\n\nMarguerite Landry\n\nNotes for Abraham (Spouse 1)\n\n“ 10ème Famille. -- GUIDRY ou GUAIDERY. --\n\nNous sommes ici en présence d’une de ces familles, problématiques et vagabondes, dont on rencontre le nom très souvent dans les documents, et qui ne figurent même pas dans les recensements. On connaît leur existence, on pressent, par les détails de leur vie, que leur établissement doit être ancien en Acadie, mais on ne saurait en préciser l’époque, ni établir l’enchaînement méthodique des faits qui nous sont connus.\n\nLes registres de Belle-Isle ne fournissent point leur généalogie, mais cette famille y est mentionnée deux fois. Dans la 12ème déclaration de la paroisse de Sauzon, on lit: “que Marie Leblanc, née en 1735 à Pigiguit, se maria à l’île St-Jean, à Anselme Guedry fils de Pierre Guédry et de Marguerite Brosseau, demeurant actuellement (1767) aux îles St-Pierre et Miquelon.”\n\nPuis à la 13ème déclaration de Sauzon, il est fait mention d’une Marie Guédry qui était veuve d’un Benjamin Mius.\n\nDans les recensements que nous avons de L’Acadie, il n’est fait aucune mention des Guidry, sauf dans celui de 1698, et dans quelques petits recensements des côtes de l’Est.\n\nVoici ce que dit le recensement de 1698: Paroisse de Port-Royal, Claude Guaidry, âgé de 50 ans, marié à Marguerite Petitpas, âgée de 40 ans, 10 enfants: Abraham 20 ans; -- Claude 16; -- Jean-Baptiste 14; -- Charles 12; -- Alexis 10; -- Augustin 8; -- Marie-Joseph 6; -- Claude 4; -- Joseph 3; -- Pierre 6 mois. Abraham l’aîné a donc dû naître en 1678; Claude Guaidry, son père marié vers 1676 à Port-Royal, où il était né en 1648.\n\nLe recensement qui pécède celui-ci était de 1692, on n’y trouve aucune mention des Guaidry; et dans les recensements de 1699 et de 1701, il n’est déjà plus question d’eux. Claude Guaidry n’a donc été à Port-Royal qu’un oiseau de passage; il s’y montre cependant avec les apparences d’un homme civilisé, et d’un agriculteur, 10 vaches, des brebis, etc., etc.; mais il y a fagots et fagots, il y a aussi cultures et cultures, et s’il ramena ses vaches dans les roches de la Hève, il est probable qu’il n’en fit pas des vaches grasses.\n\nEn 1701 il résidait dans ce dernier pays de la Hève, car nous avons trouvé dans les registres de Port-Royal, que Claude Guidery et Marguerite Petitpas eurent en 1701 un nouvel enfant qui fut baptisé à Mirliguesh, sous le nom de Paul Guidery, son parrain était un Baptiste Guidery; cet enfant était le onzième garçon de la famille, et c’est celui de tous dont nous pouvons suivre le plus longtemps la trace, comme nous le verrons tout à l’heure.\n\nDans ces actes figurent de temps en temps des Guidery aux baptêmes et aux mariages, il en est de même dans les documents de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, sous l’administration anglaise; la famille Guidery avec plusieurs autres familles métisses, prirent alors des terres de la main du colonel Mascarene, sur la côte de l’Est. Dans les temps de la proscription, ces families métisses firent leur soumission, et prêtèrent serment aux Anglais.\n\nVers 1735 nous voyans entrer en scène ce Paul Guidery, le dernier enfant de Claude Guidery, dont nous avons ci-dessus relaté la naissance; c’était un garçon leste, adroit, paraît-il, et surtout fort gai, il est constamment désigné ainsi: Paul Guidery dit Grivois, ou quelquefois le Jovial; il épousa, un peu après 1730, Anne Mius d’Entremont, fille naturelle d’un Mius d’Entremont, et d’une squaw métisse de la côte de l’Est. Une fois marié il continua l’existence de son père, vivants de pêche et de cabotage; il pratiquait la pèche depuis la baie Ste-Marie jusqu’au Cap Nord de l’île du Cap-Breton.\n\nEn 1745 on le trouve toujours à Mirligouesh, où il passe pour un excellent pilote côtier (dépêche de M. de Beauharnois du 12 septembre 1745). Le 21 octobre 1747, il est mis hors la loi par Shirley avec 12 autres acadiens. A partir de ce moment, il cesse en quelque façon d’avoir une demeure fixe; les excursions de pêche et de cabotage deviennent son était normal autour de Louisbourg.\n\nAu milieu des dépenses énormes qu’entraîne la création de cette place, il ramasse les miettes de ces prodigalités, et il vit sur as barque avec sa famille. Il fréquentait fort souvent la baie Espagnole d’où il rapportait de la houille et divers matériaux. Ce fut en ce lieu qu’il fit la rencontre d’un officier français nommé Bogard de Lanoue, lequel devint si fortement épris de l’une de ses filles, que, malgré la défense expresse de M. d’Aillebout, commandant du Cap-Breton, il parvint à l’épouser le 17 février 1755. Ce mariage fut attaqué en nullité, au nom du roi, parce qu’il était défendu aux officiers d’épouser des filles de sang mêlé; il en résulta un débat assez scadaleux, que nous avon résumé dans les notes de la colonie féodale, 4ème série No. V.\n\nAprès la prise de Louisbourg, Guidry fit sa soumission, comme presque tous les Métis des côtes de l’Est; il rentra dans ses cantonnements et on n’entendit plus parler de lui. Il est probable qu’il existe un bon nombre de descendants de cette famille, parmi les trois ou quatre mille personnes, réputées d’origine française, et qui sont dispersées sur la côte entre Halifax et la cap Sable. Parlent-ils encore français? ont-ils même conservé leurs nome sans trop les défigurer? je l’ignore; mais il est certain qu’ils ont conservé une tradition solide de leur origine française, dont ils réclament l’enregistrement à tous les recensements.\n\nTous les Guidry néanmoins ne sont pas restés fixés sur cette côte. Un des frères de Guidery le Grivois se rendit, au temps de la proscription, dans l’île St-Jean. Il se nommait Pierre et était né en 1698; un de ses fils nommé Anselme épousa alors dans cette île une fille dite Marie Leblanc, originaire de Pigiguitk. Lorsque l’île fut à son tour occupée par les Anglais, Pierre Guidry et sa femme, Marguerite Brosseau, se réfugièrent à St-Pierre et Miquelon, où ils étaient en 1767, et où leurs descendants existent peut-être encore aujourd’hui.\n\nA quelle époque les Guidry sont-ils venus s’établir en Amérique? Nous n’avons sur ce point aucune donnée bien précise. D’après le recensement de 1698, Claude Guidry était né en 1648; c’est un homme qui avait toujours vécu en dehors du groupe agricole de Port-Royal; bien qu’il eût 23 ans en 1671, bien qu’il fût marié en 1676, et qu’il ait eu une nombreuse famille longtemps avant 1698, il ne figure dans aucun recensement antérieur, ni en 1671, ni en 1686, ni en 1693; on le rencontre fontuitement à Port-Royal en 1698, et depuis lors le nom de Guidry ne se retrouve plus sur aucune liste. Cette famille a donc toujours demeuré avec les sauvages et les Métis; Guidry est un homme de la Hève, il est né là, il y a vécu et il s’y plait; son père devait être une de ces rudes pratiques des côtes de l’Est, qui refusèrent de suivre D’Aulnay à Port-Royal; peut-être était-il venu avec Razilly, peut-être remontait-il au-delà, jusqu’aux compagnons de Latour et de Krainguille. Il est très possible qu’il ait épousé une squaw, comme Latour et plusieurs autres. Rien n’est certain, mais tout cela est possible!\n\nQuoi qu’il en soit, la famille Guidry nous offre les mêmes caractères et les mêmes péripéties que les Martin, les Petitpas, les Lejeune, etc., etc., et on a tout droit de présumer qu’elle est très ancienne dans la contrée. Ces études nous donnent une idée approximative de cette société d’aventuriers que Razilly retrouva à la Hève, et une idée assez nette et assez claire du mélange qui se forma par l’adjonction des familles que ce dernier amena avec lui. Mélange assez mal défini, où prévalurent promptement des allures grossières et vagabondes, dont les traces survécurent longtemps dans certaines familles.\n\nCet état de choses n’avait cependant pas duré plus de 5 à 6 ans, et cependant D’Aulnay eut beucoup de peine à réagir contre cette influence, lorsqu’il voulut concentrer la populations française à Port-Royal; il fallut exercer une sorte de pression pour déterminer certaines familles à suivre le mouvement, quelque-unes même ne cédèrent point comme nous le voyons; elles restèrent parmi les sauvages et les Métis, ou y retournèrent plus tard. Or il suffit de suivre leur histoire et leur destinée, pour bien apprécier avec quelle sagesse et quelle juste prévoyance D’Aulnay s’établit loin des entrainements de la sauvagerie, à Port-Royal. Dans ce centre exclusivement agricole et français, il lui fut plus facile de préparer l’avenir de la société qu’il allait créer, car c’est dans la pratique d’un travail bien réglé, et d’une patiente économie que se formèrent peu à peu les fortes moeurs du peuple acadien. “\n\nTranslation:\n\n“ 10th Family. -- GUIDRY or GUAIDERY. --\n\nWe are here in the presence of one of those families, questionables and vagabonds, of whom we encounter the name very often within the records, and which does not even appear in the censuses. We are aware of their existence, we ascertain, from the details of their life, that their establishment in Acadia must be old, but we cannot state precisely the time nor establish the systematic linking of facts that are known to us.\n\nThe registers of Belle-Isle do not provide their genealogy, but that family is mentioned there twice. In the 12th declaration from the parish of Sauzon, one reads: “that Marie Leblanc, born in 1735 at Pigiguit, married at Isle St-Jean, to Anselme Guedry, son of Pierre Guédry and of Marguerite Brosseau, now (1767) living at Isles St-Pierre and Miquelon.”\n\nThen in the 13th declaration of Sauzon, there is mentioned a Marie Guédry who was the widow of a Benjamin Mius.\n\nIn the censuses that we have of Acadia, there is not made any mention of Guidry except in that of 1698, and in a few small censuses of the East Coast.\n\nHere is what the census of 1698 says: Parish of Port-Royal, Claude Guaidry, 50 years old, married to Marguerite Petitpas, 40 years old, 10 children: Abraham 20 years; -- Claude 16; -- Jean-Baptiste 14; -- Charles 12; -- Alexis 10; -- Augustin 8; -- Marie-Joseph 6; -- Claude 4; -- Joseph 3; -- Pierre 6 months. Abraham, the eldest, must, therefore, have been born in 1678; Claude Guaidry, his father, was married about 1676 at Port-Royal, where he was born in 1648.\n\nThe census which preceds this one was of 1692, one does not find there any mention of the Guaidry; and in the censuses of 1699 and 1701, there is already no more question of them. Claude Guaidry has not, to be sure, been at Port-Royal as a bird of passage; he is seen, however, with the appearances of a civilized man, of a farmer, 10 cows, some sheeps, etc., etc.; but men are not all alike, he also has there cultivated land, and he has brought his cows out of the rocks of La Hève, it is likely that it did not suit the fat cows.\n\nIn 1701 he resided in this rugged region of La Hève, for we have found in the register of Port-Royal, that Claude Guidery and Marguerite Petitpas had in 1701 a new child who was baptized at Mirliguesh, with the name of Paul Guidery, his godfather was a Baptiste Guidery; this child was the eleventh boy of the family, and he is the main one by whom we can follow the trail the longest time as we will see in a moment.\n\nIn these records appear from time to time some baptisms and marriages of the Guidery, there is the same about them in the documents of Nova Scotia, under the English administration; the Guidery family with several other hald-bred families, got then some land from the hand of Colonel Mascarene, on the East Coast. During the time of the exile, these half-bred families made their submission and took the oath from the English.\n\nAbout 1735 se see entering on the scene this Paul Guidery, the last child of Claude Guidery, of whom we have related above the birth; he was an active, skillful young fellow, it appears, and especially quite merry, he is constantly called thus: Paul Guidery dit Grivois, or sometimes le Jovial; he married a little after 1730, Anne Mius d’Entremont, illegitimate daughter of a Mius d’Entremont and of a half-bred squaw of the East Coast. Once married he continued the life of his father, lifetime of fishing and of the coasting trade; he practiced the fishing from Baie St-Marie to Cap Nord of the Isle of Cap-Breton.\n\nIn 1745 we find him still at Mirligouesh, where he is considered an excellent coasting pilot (dispatch of M. de Beauharnois of 12 September 1745). The 21st of October 1747, he is made an outlaw by Shirley with 12 other Acadians. From this moment on, he ceases in any manner to have a fixed residence; the fishing and coasting trips become his normal circumstance around Louisbourg.\n\nIn the midst of the huge expenditures which the creation of that situation entails, he gathers the bits of these extravagance, and he lives on his boat with his family. He visited quite often the Baie Espagnole from where is brought back coal and miscellaneous materials. It was in this place that a French officer named Bogard de Lanoue, who became so strongly in love with one of his daughters, that, in spite of the formal pleas by M. d’Aillebout, commanding officer of Cap-Breton, he married her 17 February 1755. That marriage was contested with invalidity, in the name of the king, because it was forbidden for officers to marry girls of mixed blood; there resulted from it a rather scandalous debate, which we summarized in the Notes de la Colonie Féodale, 4th series No. V.\n\nAfter the capture of Louisbourg, Guidry submitted, as nearly all the Métis of the East Coast; he returned to his quarters and we no longer hear of him. It is probable that there are a considerable number of descendants of this family, among the three or four thousand persons, considered of French origin, and who are scattered on the coast between Halifax and Cap Sable. Do they still speak French? Have they also preserved their names without distorting them too much? I am unaware of it; but it is certain that they have preserved a strong tradition of their French origin, of which they demand recording of it in all the censuses.\n\nAll the Guidry nevertheless have not remained settled on that coast. One of the brothers of Guidery le Grivois surrendered, at the time of the exile, on the Isle St-Jean. He was called Pierre and was born in 1698; one of his sons named Anselme married then on that isle a girl called Marie Leblanc, originally of Pigiguitk. When the isle was occupied at his place by the English, Pierre Guidry and his wife Marguerite Brosseau, took refuge at St-Pierre and Miquelon, where they were in 1767, and where their descendants live perhaps even today.\n\nAt which time have the Guidry come to establish themselves in America? We do not have any very precise data on that point. According to the census of 1698, Claude Guidry was born in 1648; this is a man who had always lived outside of the agricultural group of Port-Royal; although he was 23 years old in 1671, although he has married in 1676, and that he has had a large family long before 1698, he does not appear in any earlier census, neither in 1671, nor in 1686, nor in 1693; we encounter him by chance at Port-Royal in 1698, and since then the name of Guidry is not met with again on any list. That family has, to be sure, always lived with the savages and the Métis; Guidry is a man of La Hève, he was born there, he has lived there and it pleases him; his father must have been one of those rugged characters of the East Coast, who refused to follow D’Aulnay to Port-Royal; perhaps he had come with Razilly, perhaps he went back further, even to the companions of Latour and of Krainguille. It is very possilbe that he married a squaw, as Latour and several others. Nothing is certain, but all this is possible!\n\nBe that as it may, the Guidry family offers us the same characters and the same vicissitudes as the Martin, the Petitpas, the Lejeune, etc., etc., and we have every right to presume that they are very old in the country. These studies give us an approximate idea of that company of adventurers that Razilly met again at La Hève, and a perception rather distinct and rather free of mingling that took shape by joining of families that this last brought with him. Intermixing defined rather badly, were readily prevailed some rough demeanours and vagabonds, of which the traces survived a long time in certain families.\n\nThis state of affairs, however, had not lasted more than 5 or 6 years, and yet D’Aulnay had a great deal of difficulty to react against that influence, when he wanted to concentrate the French population at Port-Royal; it was necessary to exert a sort of pressure in order to cause certain families to follow the movement, some even did not submit as we see; they remained among the savages and the Métis, or returned there later. But it suffices to follow their history and their fate, in order to properly appreciate with what wisdom and what accurate foresight D’Aulnay settled far from the allurements of the wild, at Port-Royal. Within this center exclusively agricultural and French, it was easier for him to prepare the future of the community that he proceeded to create, because it is in the practice of a very steady occupation, and of an enduring economy that fashion little by little the strong manners and customs of the Acadian people. “4505,4506\n\n____________________\n\nBona Arsenault states in the first edition of his excellent book on the genealogy of the Acadians that:\n\n“ GUIDRY DIT GRIVOIS (GUITRY)\n\n1698. - Claude Guidry dit Grivois, 50 ans, marié à Marguerite Petitpas, 40 ans.\n\nEnfants: Abraham, 20 ans; Claude, 16 ans; Jean-Baptiste, 14 ans; Charles, 12 ans; Alexis, 10 ans; Augustin, 8 ans; Marie-Joseph, 6 ans; Claude, 4 ans; Joseph, 3 ans; Pierre, âgé de six mois.\n\n1706. - Autres enfants: Paul, 5 ans; et une fille, Françoise, 1 an.\n\nClaude Guidry dit Grivois arriva en Acadie vers 1671. ”\n\nTranslation:\n\n“ GUIDRY DIT GRIVOIS (GUITRY)\n\n1698. - Claude Guidry dit Grivois, 50 years, married to Marguerite Petitpas, 40 years.\n\nChildren: Abraham, 20 years; Claude, 16 years; Jean-Baptiste, 14 years; Charles, 12 years; Alexis, 10 years; Augustin, 8 years; Marie-Joseph, 6 years; Claude, 4 years; Joseph, 3 years; Pierre, age of six months.\n\n1706. - Other children: Paul, 5 years; and a daughter, Françoise, 1 year.\n\nClaude Guidry dit Grivois arrived in Acadie about 1671. ”4484\n\n____________________\n\nIn the second edition of his pioneering book on the genealogy of the Acadians Mr. Bona Arsenault states:\n\n“ GUEDRY et GUIDRY\n\naussi: Guitry\n\nClaude Guédry dit Grivois, né en 1648, arrivé en Acadie vers 1671, marié vers 1677 à Marguerite Petitpas.

The Public Archives of Ottawa has acquired in 1968 a copy of this valuable document found in the Archives des Colonies at Paris among the papers of Michel Le Neuf de la Vallière. Thanks to this census it has been possible to positively identify Abraham Dugas, born in 1677, as being the son of Martin and of Marguerite Petitpas. In the preceding census of 1671 Martin Dugas was not yet married and in the subsequent census, that of 1686, he has already died. “4622\n\n____________________\n\n“L’ainé de ses fils, Claude, né en 1652, épousa Françoise Bourgeois en 1676; il demeura dans la poroisse de Port-Royal, sur le petit fief paternel, où se perpétua sa postérité. Le second, Martin Dugast, disparaît des recensements pendant plus de 20 ans. Abraham, le troisième, né en 1663, épousa à 22 ans Jeanne Guilbaut, fit une courte station à Pombkou en 1686, d’où il alla s’installer définitivement aux Mines; c’est de lui que sortirent les nombreuses familles Dugast de ce quartier, et c’est lui qui est visé dans la Déclaration de Belle-Isle ci-dessus énoncée. Le vieux Dugast l’armurier mourut vers 1698. En 1701 on trouvait son fils aîné Claude à Port-Royal avec 11 enfants, et son 3eme fils Abraham aux Mines avec 4 enfants. En 1707, nous trouvons toujours Claude à Port-Royal et Abraham aux Mines, mais il se trouve en utre à Port-Royal un Abraham Dugast avec 3 enfants, qui est évidemment un fils de Martin Dugast disparu aprés 1671; il ne peut en effet sortir que de lui, car les deux fréres de Martin Dugast n’ont eu ni l’un ni l’autre aucun enfant qui portât le nom d’Abraham.”\n\nTranslation:\n\n”The eldest of the sons, Claude, born in 1652, married Françoise Bourgeois en 1676; he lived in the parish of Port-Royal, on the small paternal fief, where he continued his posterity. The second, Martin Dugast, disappears from the censuses during more than 20 years. Abraham, the third, born in 1663, married at 22 years Jeanne Guilbaut, was a short time at Pombkou en 1686, from where he went to settle eventually at Mines; it is from him that emerge the numerous Dugast families of that district, and it is he who is alluded to in the Declaration of Belle-Isle stated above. The old Dugast the armourer died about 1698. In 1701 we find his eldest son Claude at Port-Royal with 11 children, and his third son Abraham at Mines with 4 children. In 1707, we find Claude still at Port-Royal and Abraham at Mines, but there is also at Port-Royal an Abraham Dugast with 3 children, who is evidently a son of Martin Dugast who disappears after 1671; in fact, he can only descend from him, because the two brothers of Martin Dugast did not have, either of them, a child with the name of Abraham.”4667\n\n____________________\n\nThe Census of Acadia at Port Royal in 1678 states:\n\n“Martin dugast & marguerite petitpas 1g/12 arpans 16 p~ 1 fusil”.\n\nTranslation:\n\n“ Martin dugast & marguerite petitpas 1 g/12 arpans 16 p~ 1 gun ”\n\nThe ‘1g’ means ‘1 garçon’ or ‘1 boy’. The ‘16 p~’ means ‘16 p’beste a corne’ or ‘16 cattle’. The son of Martin Dugas and Marguerite Petitpas in this census is Abraham Dugas.\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1678 Martin Dugas and Marguerite Petitpas are living at Port Royal with their son Abraham. At this time Martin Dugas has 12 arpents of improved land, 16 cattle and 1 gun. 4649,4650,4651,4564.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia at Merliguèche in 1686 Claude Guédry is listed as:\n\n“La Verdure 35; Sa femme 25 et un Enfant”\n\nTranslation:\n\n“La Verdure 35; his wife 25 and a child”\n\nThey are living at Merliguèche. In the Census of Acadia of 1686 Claude Guédry is listed as having no arms (guns), cultivated land, cattle nor sheep4535,4538,4539,4590.\n\nWho is the child censused with Claude Guédry and Marguerite Petitpas? No age is given for the child in the census. By 1686 Claude Guédry and/or Marguerite Petitpas had either four or five children between them: Abraham Dugas (born about 1678), Jeanne Guédry (born about 1681), Claude Guédry (born about 1682), Jean-Baptiste Guédry (born about 1684) and Charles Guédry (born about 1686). It is uncertain which of these children Monsieur de Meulles, the census-taker, listed in the Census of 1686 although it is probably not Jeanne Guédry as our only record of her is at her baptism in 1681. She is not recorded in any records as living with Claude Guédry.\n\n____________________\n\nMark Labine in his work on the Guidry dit Labine family states: “It appears that Claude Guidry spent most of his life at Mirligueche, with the security of his wife and family close by. We know from a census taken by a man named Gargas in 1687 that Claude lived in a house in Mirligueche with his wife, Marguerite. With them were at least three children under 15 years of age and five young men over 15 years old. We are not sure who these five young men are. We know that in 1687 Claude had five children, but it’s possible Jeanne (daughter of Keskia) had died in infancy. The census also states that in 1687 eleven Indians lived in wigwams at Mirligueche and that there was one half acre of cleared land as well as two guns.4637” Known children of Claude Guédry and/or Marguerite Petitpas were Abraham Dugas (born about 1678), Jeanne Guédry (born about 1681), Claude Guédry (born about 1682), Jean-Baptiste Guédry (born about 1684) and Charles Guédry (born about 1686). A son Alexis Guédry was born about 1688 and probably was not born by the time of this Census of 1687. It is likely that Jeanne Guédry is not living with Claude and Marguerite since she disappears from the records after her baptism in 1681; she may either have died or has lived with her mother Kesk8a. It is uncertain who the five young men over 15 years of age were.\n\n____________________\n\nThe Census of Acadia at Port Royal in 1698 states:\n\n“ Claude Guaidry 50 10 Bestes a cornes 2 Brebis 8 Cochons 8 Arpens de terre no Arbes fruités 1 fusil no Domestiques / Margtte Petitpas 40 / Enfans: / Abraham 20 / Claude 16 / Jean Baptiste 14 / Charles 12 / Alexis 10 / Augustin 8 / Marie Josephe 6 / Claude 4 / Joseph 3 / Pierre 1/2 “\n\nTranslation:\n\n“ Claude Guaidry 50 10 Cattle 2 Sheep 8 Pigs 8 Arpents of land, no Fruit trees, 1 gun no Servants / Margtte Petitpas 40 / Children: / Abraham 20 / Claude 16 / Jean Baptiste 14 / Charles 12 / Alexis 10 / Augustin 8 / Marie Josephe 6 / Claude 4 / Joseph 3 / Pierre 1/2 “4484,4513,4514.\n\nClaude Guidry, 50 years old, and Marguerite Petitpas, age 40 years, have nine children (Claude, Jean-Baptiste, Charles, Alexis, Augustin, Marie-Josephe, Claude, Joseph and Pierre) plus Abraham Dugas, the child of Marguerite Petitpas and her first husband Martin Dugas. At this time Claude Guidry and his family are at Port Royal and he has 10 cattle, 2 sheep, 8 pigs, 8 arpents of land under cultivation, no fruit trees, one gun and no domestic servants4515,4516.\n\n____________________\n\nIn the Census of Acadia in 1698 Abraham Dugas is 20 years old and living at Port Royal with his step-father Claude Guédry and his mother Marguerite Petitpas4943,4701.\n\n____________________\n\nIn 1703 Abraham Dugas and Madeleine Landry are censused at Port Royal (“Abraham Dugats, sa femme”) with their daughter. The transcription of the census also lists them has having two sons; however, the figure ‘2’ appears to have been written into the space by someone other than the transcriber. It is uncertain if this figure ‘2’ is correct. The census lists one person other than Abraham Dugas capable of carrying arms - apparently this is Madeleine Landry, his wife4944,4938.\n\n____________________\n\nIn 1707 Abraham Dugas and Madeleine Landry are censused at Port Royal (“Abraham Dugast, et sa femme”). At this time they have one son less than 14 years of age and 2 daughters under 12 years of age. They also have 4 arpents of improved land, 12 cattle, 20 sheep, 12 pigs and 2 guns4944,4937.\n\n____________________\n\n“ A map of 1707 mentions Abraham Grivois.

Without other proof, it is impossible to tell whether this was Marie-Madeleine Landry’s husband, or Jeanne Guilbeau’s. At the time of Joseph Dugas’s marriage (Rg PR 7 Jan 1728), the groom’s father Abraham was already dead. It was thus Marie-Madeleine Landry’s husband who died in 1720 after a long illness. The other Abraham Dugas appears in the censuses at Port-Toulouse until 1734. ”4949\n\n____________________\n\n“ C.-J. d’Entremont, ‘Census of Port-Royal, 1678’, SGCF,vol. XXII, 1971, p. 239:\n\nThis Martin dugast was the son of Abraham I Dugas, (the first of the name in Acadia), and of Marguerite Doucet. Before this census of 1678 came to light, his name was to be found solely in the census of 1671, being then 15 years of age, thus born around 1656. This information that the census of 1678 furnishes to the genealogists with regard to his being married to marguerite petitpas is most precious, because it was believed that he had died shortly after 1671, without getting married. (See Bulletin des Recherches Historiques, Vol. 18, [1912], p. 80). This marguerite petitpas must necessarily be the one that we find in the census of 1671, 10 years of age, daughter of Claude Petitpas, sieur de LaFluer, and of Catherine Bugaret.\n\nThe son given them in our census, without his age, who was probably their only child, must necessarily be Abraham, (whom we shall call here for clarity Abraham III), who married, probably in 1702, Madeleine Landry. Now, Abraham I had a son by the same name, whom we shall call Abraham II, born in 1661 according to the census of 1671. This Abraham II married Jeanne Guilbeault. Bona Arsenault identifies him with our Abraham III, stating that Jeanne Guilbeault being dead, Abraham II married around 1700 Madeleine Landry. (See Histoire et Généalogie des Acadiens, [Québec, 1965], Vol. I, p. 392). But that is impossible. Abraham III, (son of Martin dugast and of marguerite petit pas), and Madeleine Landry lived in Port Royal, where was born their first child Marie, January 21, 1703, and where the other children were baptized up to 1714, when Abraham II, his uncle (son of Abraham I), and Jeanne Guilbeault were at Minas, where we find them from 1701 up to at least 1714.\n\nThe error of Mr. Arsenault is easy to understand. It comes from the fact that not knowing that Martin had gotten married and had had a son named Abraham III, he had no other choice than to impute to Madeleine Landry, as husband, Abraham II, whom he thought had become the widower of Jeanne Guilbeault. As as (sic) matter of fact, he could not conceive that the husband of Madeleine Landry could be a grandchild of Abraham I, because, of the three sons of Abraham I, Claude and Abraham II did not have a son by the name of Abraham, and, with regard to Martin, he thought that he was dead.\n\nRameau de Saint-Père, on his part, surmised very correctly that Martin had gotten married, when he wrote: “In 1707, we find ... Abraham at Minas, but there is also in Port Royal an Abraham Dugast with 3 children, who is evidently a son of Martin Dugast who disappears after 1671; in fact, he can only descend from him, because the two brothers of Martin Dugast did not have, either of them, a child with the name of Abraham.” (Collection de Documents, Inédits, published in Le Canada-Français, [Québec, 1888-90), Vol. III, p. 161. ”4669,4563,4564\n\nOn 11 February 1703 Marie Dugast, born 20 January 1703 and daughter of Abraham Dugas and Magdeleine Landry, was baptized at Port Royal, Acadia (St-Jean-Baptiste de Port Royal Catholic Church).

Witnesses at the marriage were Denis Petito (uncle of the bride), Francois Robichaux (uncle of the bride), Claude Landry (uncle of the groom) and many others4950,4936,4939.\n\n____________________\n\nOn 29 May 1731 Claude Dugas, twenty-two year old son of Abraham Dugas and Madeleine Landry, married Marie Melanson, eighteen year old daughter of the deceased Pierre Melancon and Anne Granger, at Port Royal, Acadia. Witnesses at the marriage were Claude Landry, the father, and Claude Landry, the son4944,4940,4941.\n\nQuestions/Errors notes for Abraham (Spouse 1)\n\nOn 30 April 1705 Joseph Dugast, son of Abraham Dugast and Magdeleine Landry, was baptized at Port Royal, Acadia (St-Jean-Baptiste de Port Royal Catholic Church). Sponsors at the baptism were Sieur Consolin bombardier du fort qui a signé and Marie Landry4950,4953,4963. Note that Rieder and Rieder4953 give the baptismal date as “August 20 (?), 1705” rather than 30 April 1705. The order of baptisms in their book would indicate that the correct date of the baptism is 30 April 1705 rather than 20 August 1705 since the preceding baptism was 25 April 1705 and the baptism immediately after Joseph Dugas was 10 May 1705. The baptisms appear to be in chronological order in this volume. The original register4954 and White4950 both record the baptism as occurring on 30 April 1705.\n\nIn his first two editions on the genealogy of the Acadians Arsenault4930,4931 mistakenly cites Abraham Dugas, the husband of Marie-Madeleine Landry, as being the son of Abraham Dugas and Marguerite Doucet rather than the son of Martin Dugas and Marguerite Petitpas. He refers to the marriage of Marie-Madeleine Landry as being the second marriage of Abraham Dugas - the first marriage being to Jeanne Guilbaut. In fact, there were were two men in Acadia in the 1660-1680 timeframe named Abraham Dugas: (1) Abraham Dugas (born 1662), the son of Abraham Dugas and Marguerite Doucet, who abut 1686 married Jeanne Guilbaut, the daughter of Pierre Guilbaut and Catherine Terriot and (2) Abraham Dugas (born about 1678), the son of Martin Dugas and Marguerite Petitpas, who about 1702 married Marie-Madeleine Landry, daughter of Claude Landry and Marguerite Terriot. In the third edition of his work Arsenault4964 corrects this error.\n\nNames notes for Abraham (Spouse 1)"
