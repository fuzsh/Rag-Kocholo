        "text": "Corrected the first name back to Magdaleine in both French and English so they match the earliest original PRDH document scans attached here in Sources, her Catholic baptism in 1705 and marriage to Guillaume Lalonde. SDBS\n\nSarah was daughter of Mercy Mary Painter and Edward Allen of Deerfield, Franklin, Massachusetts, United States. Captured by Abenakis and Iroquois at the Battle of Deerfield on 29 Feb 1704 and marched to Quebec where she became a domestic servant for Jean Quenet. She converted to Catholicism and was renamed Marie Madeleine Sara Helene.\n\nOn 27 Apr 1710 she married Guillaume Lalonde dit L'Espérance, they had 13 children together, 9 boys and 4 girls. Sarah died at 82 years of age\n\nDe son vrai nom: Sarah Allen. Née en 1684 ou 1692, originaire de Deerfield, comté de Franklin au Massachusetts de l'union d'Edward Allen (1663-1740) et de Mercy Painter (1664-?). Ses parents s'étaient mariés à Deerfield. Le 11 août 1704, elle est faite prisonnière par les Indiens lors de l'attaque du village. Amenée à Kahnawake, Sarah Allen y séjourne quelque temps avant d'être rachetée par Jean Quenet, marchand de Montréal. Le 30 mai 1705, elle est baptisée sous le nom de Marie-Madeleine-Hélène Sire à Ste-Anne-du-Bout-de-l'Île(Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue) en présence de son parrain, Pierre Lamoureux, et de sa marraine Etiennette Hurtubise, épouse de Jean Quenet. Le 27 avril 1710, Sarah Allen épouse à Ste-Anne-du-Bout-de l'Île, Guillaume Lalonde dit Lespérance, agriculteur né en 1684, fils de Jean Lalonde et de Marie Barbant. En mai 1710, elle obtient sa nationalité française. Le couple Lalonde aura trois enfants entre 1712 et 1734 qui seront baptisés à Ste-Anne-du-Bout-de-l'Île et à l'Île-Perrot. Guillaume Lalonde décède à Saint-Joseph-de-Soulanges le 21 août 1752. Sarah décède dans la même paroisse le 25 décembre 1764.\n\nSource: De la Nouvelle-Angleterre à la Nouvelle-France. L'histoire des captifs anglo-américains au Canada entre 1675 et 1760.\n\nMarcel Fournier- Société généalogique canadienne-française, 1992.\n\nSarah Allen was born in 1692 at Deerfield, Mass. In 1704 there was a raid by the French on Deerfield and Sarah along with 111 residents of Deerfield were abducted and brought to Montreal. She was placed as a domestic with the family of Jean Quenet. At that time, May 30, 1705 she was baptized as Marie Madeleine. As her last name was English, Allen, it became Francicized in the church records and she became known as Marie Madeleine Helene\n\nProtestant New England.\n\nTaken hostage during the Indian Massacre at Deerfield, Massachsettes 11-03-1704 and 30-05-1705 baptized Catholic at the age of 13, under the name of Mary Magdalene Helene Sara said in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue.\n\nShe remained in John Quenet\n\nAnother interesting person in our French Canadian line is SARAH ALLEN. SARAH was a 12-year-girl living in the Puritan village of Deerfield Massachusetts, when it was raided by a group of French and Native forces just before dawn on February 29, 1704. In the attack, 44 villagers were killed and 109 were captured.\n\nThe captives were marched 300 miles north to Canada, during the middle of winter, arriving in Quebec by early April 1704. Only 89 captives survived the journey. Many of the captives were ransomed and returned to Deerfield, Sarah however, did not. She was baptized Catholic and her name changed to MARIE-MADELINE HELENE SIRE on May 30, 1705 at Ste-Anne de Bout de L'Ile near Montreal. At that time, she was living with, and working as a maid for Jean Quenet. 5 years later she married GUILLAUME LALONDE, the son of JEAN LALONDE, another Carignan soldier. GUILLAUME and SARAH went on to have 12 children.\n\n_____________________ For additional interesting background information on the politics and peoples of the Deerfield region watch Also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ksgHKVxCs&amp;t=16s is worth watching...\n\nhttp://web.uvic.ca/~lalonde/history/history/battle.html\n\nUpdated from MyHeritage Family Trees via brother Jonathan Allen by SmartCopy: Jun 28 2015, 18:34:46 UTC\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\n@R950665299@ Web: Netherlands, GenealogieOnline Trees Index, 1000-2015 Ancestry.com Ancestry.com Operations, Inc. 1,9289::0\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\n1,9289::25811164\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\n@R950665299@ Canada, Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current Ancestry.com Ancestry.com Operations, Inc. 1,60527::0\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\n1,60527::1770022\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\n@R950665299@ Family Data Collection - Births Edmund West, comp.

It is indeed quite acurate. Some exaggeration regarding that the entire village of Deerfield was completely burned - some homes survived - some people not captured did survive. The damages were extremely heavy. Regarding Pierre Gaultier Sieur de Varennes dit La Vérendrye did indeed attack Deerfield February 29, 1704 with French soldiers, militia, Abénakis (Algonquins), Hurons (Ancienne Lorette near Québec City), and Mohawks (both from Kahnawague (aka Caughnawaga - South Shore of Montréal) and Kahnasataké (Oka, Lake of Two Mountains). Description of the treks to and from Deerfield are acurate. What is interesting is that the video mentions my three ancestors and that of my childhood friends ancestor. I am a descendant of Sarah Allen - as well as Josiah Rising (Joseph Ignace Raizenne dit Shoentakouani) and Abigail Nims (Marie Élisabeth Abigail Nîmes dite Taoutogouach). They were raised in Oka - each in a Mohawk family. --- Thankful Stebbens (late Stebenne) - is a direct ancestor of childhood friends who visited Deerfield in 2014 and 2016. This past week on a Montréal specialty channel : Les Figures Marquantes animated by Historian Éric Bédard - he invited the anthropologist/author Serge Bouchard who talked about the famous Gaultier dit de La Vérendrye about their exploits, the terrible massacre in Deerfield - exploring West and SouthWest (Saskatchewan, Winnipeg - also Missouri Rivers). (Book : Ils ont couru l'Amérique about the forgotten coureurs des bois). Pierre Gaultier had 4 sons - he was interested in making $ having his sons trap furs - he was the trader - opened many posts - his sons spoke several aboriginal languages. When he lost his nephew and his eldest son - he called for his youngest : Louis-Josep Gaultier dit La Vérendrye - would you believe 2 of my ancestors explored with him (Missouri) Louis Lalonde & Amyot. (Still trying to figure the tree branch for the two). All this to say that the reportage - Sarah Allen dying at Les Cèdres (Guillaume as well) in Vaudreuil-Soulanges - is accurate to a tee. They had 14 children. Guillaume had been taught by his older brother Jean-Baptiste (Jean) 12 years his senior - how to trap and trade. One of the childhood friends (they are sisters) has her current house located where the Lalonde's had land in Baie d'Urfé. You can mention to Ruth Irene Allen - that the video is quite accurate - backed up by documents found in PRDH (Drouin)-Le LaFrance scanned original records. Hope this answer finds you and your family in excellent health! Take care! Suzanne _______________________ Suzanne L.
