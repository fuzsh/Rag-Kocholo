        "text": "I would like to introduce to you Elizabeth whom I first met in July 2013, as she was one of the pilgrims who flew from Virginia to the South of France for the first Novena Tour of PROVENCE to Saint Mary Magdalene which took place over the Feast of Saint Mary Magdalene (July 22nd).\n\nElizabeth of Sainte Marie-Madeleine\n\nElizabeth wrote to me in 2013 in advance of the Novena Tour about her fondness for Sainte Marie-Madeleine. She said her mother was born in Villefranche-sur-Mer, a commune in the Provence-Alpes-Côtes d’Azur region on the French Riviera, and was raised in Toulon. Elizabeth had visited her mother’s French family in Toulon many summers as a child and had heard of the tradition of Christianity’s arrival in France. She confessed she had been “absorbed by her story for some time.” Elizabeth is married and has two daughters.\n\nAt the time Elizabeth was studying to make temporary promises with a Third Order Carmelite community in Virginia. They are practicing members of the Catholic Church, under the protection of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and inspired by St. Theresa and St. John of the Cross, who make a commitment to the Carmel Order to seek the face of God for the sake of the Church and the World.\n\n2013 Novena Tour – Elizabeth is fourth from the left with the other pilgrims inside the Basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine in the town of St. Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume just after the Feast Day Mass. Behind the group in the center and just in front of the main altar is the skull of Sainte Marie-Madeleine in a gold reliquary.\n\nElizabeth in May 2014 just prior to making First Promises as a Secular Carmelite where she had requested to take the name “Elizabeth of Sainte Marie-Madeleine.”\n\nIn Elizabeth’s May 2014 letter to the Secular Order Of The Discalced Carmelites she explains:\n\n“I chose to take the name:\n\nElizabeth of Sainte Marie-Madeleine\n\nWhy have I chosen her? She is a recipient of His great mercy, adorer at the foot of Christ, steadfast disciple during the agony of the crucifixion, companion of the Blessed Mother, first chosen among all to witness the Resurrection, called Apostle to the Apostles, evangelizer to the Gentiles and patron saint of contemplative life, Provence, France, etc. What an amazing role model! I have had a relationship with her for some time now and would like to share her participation in the life of the early Church with you on an attached document. Her example at the end of her earthly life inspires me to seek the interior castle as Saint Teresa, our foundress, has described."
