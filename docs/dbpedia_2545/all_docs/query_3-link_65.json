        "text": "The Birth of Marie Magdelaine Monmellian dit Saint Germain and the David Family Timeline Anchor\n\nIt is with the birth of Marie Magdelaine Monmellian dit Saint Germain and with the primary source record of her baptism below, the oldest uncovered family record to date, that the commencement of this Jean Pierre David dit Saint Michel family timeline is established.\n\nBaptism Record of Marie Magdelaine Monmellian - 4 April 1698\n\n1698 to 1716\n\nThe Quebec 1716 Census\n\nVirtually nothing is yet known of Marie Magdelaine's infant, adolescent and young adult years in Quebec City. However, her marriage to Jean Pierre appears to have taken place sometimes after the Quebec 1716 Census which lists Marie Magdelaine as single at the age of 18 and living with her parents.\n\nQuebec 1716 Census\n\n1716 to 1718\n\nFrom all indications, Jean Pierreâs marriage to Marie Magdelaine occurred about 1717, sometimes shortly after the Quebec 1716 Census and the birth of Jean and Marie's 1st child about 1718.\n\nThe actual date and place of their marriage is unknown at this time, however, the location of the marriage would probably have been somewhere between QuÃ©bec City and the township of Louisbourg on the northern coast of Cape Brenton Island (Ãle Royale). As is a traditional Catholic marital custom often practiced at that time as well as current times, there exists the very likely possibility that Jean and Marie were married in the same church in which Marie was baptized in 1698, Notre-Dame de Quebec Basilica-Cathedral.\n\n1718 to 1722\n\nThe Births of Pierre, Michel and Magdeleine\n\nBetween 1718 and 1722, Marie Magdelaine gave birth to her 1st 3 children, Pierre about 1718, Michel about 1720 and Magdeleine about 1721.Â The exact date and place of their births is yet unknown, however, it is highly likely that they were born somewhere between Quebec City, Acadie or at the Fortress of Louisbourg.\n\nFortress of Louisbourg, Ãle Royale, Nouvelle France\n\n1722 to 1726\n\nMarie Magdelaine's 1st Document Presence in Louisbourg, the Birth of Marie Josephe\n\nThe 1st primary source record which documents Marie Magdelaine's presence at Louisbourg is the birth of her and Jean Pierre's 2nd daughter and 4th child, Marie Josephe, on 08 November 1722.\n\nBaptism Record of Marie Josephe David - 08 November 1722\n\nThe Births of Jean Jacques and Jean Baptiste\n\nBy 1722, Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine had now arrived and established their home at the Fortress of Louisbourg. There, the family continued to prosper and grow with the births of 2 additional children, Jean Jacques on 19 June 1724 and Jean Baptiste on 22 July 1725.\n\nThe Louisbourg 1724 Census\n\nMarie Magdelaine's presence in Louisbourg is indirectly recorded in the Louisbourg 1724 Census which lists her husband, Jean David dit Saint Michel of Nantes, a blacksmith, a wife (Marie Magdelaine), 3 sons under 15, (Pierre, Michel and Jean Jacques) and 2 daughters (Magdeleine and Marie Josephe).\n\nLouisbourg 1724 Census\n\nThe Louisbourg 1726 Census\n\nIn addition, the Louisbourg 1726 Census which also indirectly includes Marie Magdelaine continues to coincide with the Louisbourg 1724 Census with the family addition of Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine's son, Jean Baptiste David, in 1725.\n\nLouisbourg 1726 Census\n\n1726 to 1734\n\nThe Births of Francois, Francoise Charlotte, Etienne Thomas and Louis\n\nBetween the Louisbourg Census of 1726 and 1734, the births of 4 more children blessed the David dit Saint Michel household, Francois on 16 June 1727, , Francoise Charlotte on 10 April 1729 , Etienne Thomas on 21 December 1730 and Louis on 02 September 1732.Â\n\nUnfortunately, along with this joy came much sorrow.Â For during this period, Jean and Marie tragically buried 3 of their children wirh the deaths of Pierre on 30 January 1730 at the age of 11 years , Magdeleine on 09 February 1733 at the age of 12 and Etienne Thomas on 01 April 1733 at the infant age of 2 years .\n\n1734 to 1745\n\nThe Louisbourg 1734 Census\n\nThe Louisbourg 1734 Census seems to account for all surviving family members at that time. It also lists Jean David dit Saint Michel of Nantes, a blacksmith, his wife, Marie Magdelaine Monmellian, 4 sons under 15, who would have been Jean Jacque, Jean Baptiste, Francois and Louis, and 2 daughters, who would have been, Marie Josephe and Francoise Charlotte. In 1734, their 2nd son, Michel would have been at least 15 years of age or older and for that reason was possibly not included in this census.\n\nLouisbourg 1734 Census\n\nThe Births of Claude Thomas, Jacque Andre, Jeanne Olive, Marie Magdeleine and Jeanne Angelique\n\nThe last 5 of Marie and Jean's children to be born at Louisbourg were Claude Thomas born on 20 December 1735, Jacques Andre born on 30 November 1737, Jeanne Olive born on 10 July 1739, Marie Magdeleine born on 16 January 1741 and Jeanne Angelique born on 21 December 1743.\n\nThe David Family in 1744\n\nAccording to the Fortress of Louisbourg Historical Memoranda Series 1964 to Present H F 25 1989 titled Jean Pierre David dit Saint Michel: Blacksmith authored by Eric Krause of Krause House Info-Research Solutions, Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine were still living at Louisbourg in 1744 along with their surviving children of \"5 boys for certain, possibly 6 and 5 girls.\" These children would probably have included their sons Jean Jacques, Jean Baptiste, Francois, Louis, Claude Thomas and Jacques Andre and their daughters Marie Josephe, Francoise Charlotte, Jeanne Olive, Marie Magdeleine and Jeanne Angelique. The \"possibly 6\" son referred to was probably Michel who married Genevieve Hebert on 20 January 1744 in Grand-PrÃ©, Acadie and was probably living there with his wife.\n\nFrance\n\n1745 to 1748\n\nThe 1st Seige of the Fortress of Louisbourg in 1745\n\nAfter the 1st siege and capture of the Fortress of Louisbourg on 16 June 1745 by British forces commanded by Sir William Pepperell during the War of the Austrian Succession, it is believed that Jean Pierre, Marie Magdelaine and their children left Louisbourg but it is not known if they were deported to France by the British with most of the other Louisbourg French-Acadian inhabitants or escaped to Acadie or one of the Quebec, Nouvelle France communities along the St. Lawrence River.\n\nCapture of Louisbourg by British in 1745, Germain Engraving\n\nThe Whereabouts of Jean and Marie's Children\n\nSince it is recorded that there were 11 surviving children in 1744 at Louisbourg prior to their deportation or escape from the Fortress in 1745, it is not known for certain which children accompanied Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine from Louisbourg since only 7 are recorded in the Louisbourg 1749-1750 Census along with 3 new additions to the family, Joseph, Jacob and Anne Bernard.\n\nDuring this period between 1745 and 1748, it is unknown where 5 of Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine's children may have spent these years. It is highly likely that Michel, having just been married in 1744, may have been in Grand-PrÃ©, Acadie with his new wife, Genevieve Hebert. However, the whereabouts of Marie Josephe, Francois, Jacques Andre and Jeanne Angelique during this period are unknown. The Family Reconsturction File based on the Louisbourg 1749-1750 Census indicates that these 5 children did not return with Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine when they were repatriated to Louisbourg in 1748 from their exile.\n\nNo records of the David family's life between 1745 and 1748 has been yet uncovered after the 1st seige of the Fortress at Louisbourg by the British in 1745. The records of their lives pick up once again with the Louisbourg 1749-1750 Census and the marriage of Marie Josephe to Jean Paul Pouilly on 1 June 1751 at Louisbourg.\n\nDavid Children Born in Exile\n\nTheir exile from Louisbourg did not deter Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine from continuing to grow their family. For when they returned to the Fortress in 1749 they did so with 2 new boys, Joseph and Jacob, along with an adopted daughter, Anne Bernard.\n\nJoseph David was born between 1745 and 1749 during Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine exile from Louisbourg after the 1st siege of Fortress of Louisbourg in 1745. Virtually nothing is known at this time of Joseph's date or place of birth.\n\nJacob David was born between 1745 and 1749 during Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine exile from Louisbourg after the 1st siege of Fortress of Louisbourg in 1745. Virtually nothing is known at this time of Jacob's date or place of birth.\n\nAnne Bernard was adopted by Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine between 1745 and 1749 during their exile from Louisbourg after the 1st siege of Fortress of Louisbourg in 1745.\n\nFortress of Louisbourg, Ãle Royale, Nouvelle France\n\n1748 to 1755\n\nIn 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the War of the Austrian Succession, restored Louisbourg to France in return for the British trading post at Madras in India. The New England forces left Louisbourg, taking with them the famous Louisbourg Cross which had hung in the Fortress chapel. This cross was only rediscovered in the Harvard University archives in the latter half of the 20th century and is now on long-term loan to the Louisbourg historic site.\n\nThe Davids are Repatriated to Louisbourg\n\nWhen Jean Pierre and Marie Magdelaine returned to Louisbourg in 1749, they did so with 9 children and an orphan. These included 2 new sons, Joseph and Jacobs, who apparently were born during the 4 years of their exile, and an orphan by the name of Anne Bernard. According to the Louisbourg Census of 1749-1750, it appears that the other (7) children returning to Louisbourg from exile were Jean Jacques, Jean Baptiste, Louis, Claude Thomas, Francoise Charlotte, Jeanne Olive and Marie Magdeleine.\n\nThe Louisbourg 1749-1750 Census\n\nLouisbourg 1749-1750 Census\n\n1755\n\nThe Death of Marie Magdelaine Monmellian\n\nOn 1 February 1755, at the age of 57 years, Marie Magdelaine Monmellian, Jean Pierre's wife, who had shared his life for 38 years and who had born him 17 children, died and was buried in the Cemetery of Louisbourg. Fre Julien Moisson presided at her burial. The cause of her death is yet unknown. Her death record indicates she was \"age of about sixty years\" when she died, however, her actual age from her date of birth to her date of death was exactly 57 years and 27 days.\n\nBurial Record of Marie Magdelaine Monmellian - 1 February 1755\n\nAlthough Marie Magdelaine died at a relatively young age, she lead a very full life that was centered on her child bearing years spaning from about 1718 at the age of 20 years with the birth of her 1st child until the birth of her 16th and 17th child between 1745 to 1749 at the age of 46 to 50 years."
