        "text": "Mary (Hebrew Miryam) was one of the most common women’s names in New Testament times, and so it is not surprising that the crucifixion and resurrection narratives seem to speak of as many as five separate Marys. These women are usually identified in some way in order to distinguish them, but in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 27:61, Matthew 28:1) one is simply called “the other Mary.” Who was this “other Mary” and why was she called by that name – if it was, in fact, a name?\n\nIf we put the various accounts together that mention the women at the crucifixion and at the tomb of Jesus, we find:\n\nMary Magdalene (mentioned in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)\n\nMary, mother of James and Joseph or Joses (mentioned in Matthew, Mark, Luke)\n\nMary, the wife of Clopas (mentioned in John)\n\nMary, mother of Jesus (mentioned in John)\n\nMary, “the other Mary” (mentioned in Matthew)\n\n(One other woman, Salome, the wife of Zebedee and mother of James and John, is also mentioned in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.)\n\nWe know who several of these Marys are – Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene present no problem. Mary the wife of Clopas was also known as the wife of Alphaeus (Acts 1:13), the Hebrew form of which was Cleopas.\n\nNotice what Matthew tells us regarding the women present at the crucifixion: “Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph [Joses] and the mother of Zebedee’s sons” (Matthew 27:56). A few verses later Matthew continues: “Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb” (Matthew 27:61).\n\nOf these women, we know that the mother of Zebedee’s sons was Salome (Mark 15:40 and Matthew 27:56), so “the other Mary” Matthew mentions would seem to be the same as Mary the mother of James and Joses. James was one of the disciples and his father was Alphaeus – “James the son of Alphaeus” (Matthew 10:3 and Luke 6:15).\n\nPutting these facts together we see that it is likely that Mary the mother of James and Joses was the same person as Mary the wife of Alphaeus who was called Clopas or Cleopas. This would mean that “the other Mary” mentioned in Matthew 27:61 was not a separate Mary, but simply the Mary other than Mary Magdalene whom he had mentioned a few verses earlier. This would mean that Mary the wife of Clopas, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and “the other Mary” were in fact the same person.\n\nAccording to many biblical scholars, and in early Christian tradition from the time of Papias of Hierapolis (c. AD 70-163), this Mary was the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus and the wife of Alphaeus, as we apparently see in John 19:25: “Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.\" So the “other Mary” may well have been Jesus’ aunt (and her husband, Clopas, his uncle)."
