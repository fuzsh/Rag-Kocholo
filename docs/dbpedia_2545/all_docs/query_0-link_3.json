AD 1st century\n\nFeast Day july 22\n\nPatronage Pharmacists, Hairdressers & Women\n\nFun Fact\n\nMarie Madeleine, also known as Mary of Magdala, is the apostle of apostles. She was the first person that Jesus appeared to when he resurrected from the dead.\n\nShe is often identified with Mary of Bethany and the unnamed woman who washed Jesus' feet with her hair and perfume. In 1969, the Roman Catholic church set straight that she was not either of these women.\n\nPrayer"
