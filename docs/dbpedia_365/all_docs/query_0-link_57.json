        "text": "Why do some questions list the key elements or specialist areas and others don't?\n\nThe areas listed are suggested as key areas of focus for revision and final preparation, in relation to the Summer 2022 examinations. The areas listed are the focus areas relevant for that question.\n\nOur AS/A level Film Studies specification is designed to introduce learners to a wide variety of films in order to broaden their knowledge and understanding of film and the range of responses films can generate.\n\nThis specification offers opportunities to study mainstream American films from the past and the present as well as a range of recent and contemporary British films, American independent films and global films, both non-English language and English language.\n\nThe historical range of film represented in those films is extended by the study of silent film and significant film movements so that learners can gain a sense of the development of film from its early years to its still emerging digital future. Studies in documentary, experimental and short films add to the breadth of the learning experience.\n\nProduction work is a crucial part of this specification and is integral to learners' study of film. Studying a diverse range of films from several different contexts is designed to give learners the opportunity to apply their knowledge and understanding of how films are constructed to their own film making and screenwriting.\n\nThis is intended to enable learners to create high quality film and screenplay work as well as provide an informed filmmaker's perspective on their own study of film."
