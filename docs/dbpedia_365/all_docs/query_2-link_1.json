We update the Code List to conform to the most recent publications of CPT and HCPCS codes and to account for changes in Medicare coverage and payment policies. Code List updates for years 2022 and earlier were published in the Federal Register as an addendum to the annual Physician Fee Schedule final rule.\n\nBeginning with the Code List effective January 1, 2023, updates are published solely on this webpage. On or before December 2nd of each year, we will publish the annual update to the Code List and provide a 30-day public comment period using www.regulations.gov. To be considered, comments must be received within the stated 30-day timeframe. We anticipate that most comments will be addressed by April 1st; however, a longer timeframe may be necessary to address complex comments or those that require coordination with external parties. If no comments are received, in lieu of a comment response, we will publish a note below the applicable Code List year stating so.\n\n2024 Annual Update to the Code List\n\nBelow you will find the Calendar Year (CY) 2024 Code List published November 29, 2023 and a description of the revisions for CY 2024, our response to comments on that Code List, and the updated CY 2024 Code List, which is effective January 1, 2024 unless otherwise indicated on the Code List.\n\nUPDATED list of codes effective January 1, 2024, published March 1, 2024 (all codes effective January 1, 2024 unless otherwise indicated on the Code List) (ZIP)\n\nList of codes effective January 1, 2024, published November 29, 2023 (ZIP)\n\nAnnual Update to the List of CPT/HCPCS Codes Effective January 1, 2024 (PDF)\n\nWe received one comment related to the additions, deletions, and corrections to the codes on the Code List effective January 1, 2024. Our response to this comment is below. We also received one comment related to Medicare coverage for platelet-rich plasma treatments. We consider this comment to be outside the scope of the annual update. CMS does not respond to out of scope comments on the annual updates to the Code List.\n\nComment: One commenter noted that, although most Hepatitis B vaccine codes are identified on the Code List as CPT/HCPCS codes to which the exception for preventive screening tests and vaccines at § 411.355(h) applies, the Hepatitis B vaccine associated with CPT code 90739 was not listed. The commenter requested that CPT code 90739 be added to the list of vaccine codes to which the exception for preventive screening tests and vaccines at §411.355(h) applies, effective retroactively to January 1, 2024.\n\nResponse: We agree with the commenter that the exception for preventive screening tests and vaccines at § 411.355(h) should apply to CPT code 90739 and are revising the Code List accordingly. The applicability of the exception for preventive screening tests and vaccines to CPT code 90739 is prospective only and effective on the date indicated on the UPDATED list of codes.\n\nIn considering this comment, we also identified two CPT codes (90653 and 90658, both flu vaccines) that were inadvertently left off of the list of codes to which the exception for preventive screening tests and vaccines at § 411.355(h) should apply. Accordingly, we are adding these CPT codes to the list of codes to which the exception at § 411.355(h) applies, effective on the date indicated on the UPDATED list of codes.\n\n2023 Annual Update to the Code List\n\nBelow you will find the Code List that is effective January 1, 2023 and a description of the revisions effective for Calendar Year 2023.\n\nList of codes effective January 1, 2023, published December 1, 2022\n\nAnnual Update to the List of CPT/HCPCS Codes Effective January 1, 2023, published December 1, 2022 (PDF)\n\nThe comment period ended December 30, 2022. We did not receive any comments related to the additions, deletions, and corrections to the codes on the Code List effective January 1, 2023. We received one (1) comment related to the supervision level required for specific services. We consider this comment to be outside the scope of the annual update. CMS does not respond to out of scope comments on the annual updates to the Code List.\n\nDHS Categories\n\nThe DHS categories defined by the Code List are:\n\nclinical laboratory services;\n\nphysical therapy services, occupational therapy services, outpatient speech-language pathology services;\n\nradiology and certain other imaging services; and\n\nradiation therapy services and supplies.\n\nThe Code List also identifies those items and services that may qualify for either of the following two exceptions to the physician self-referral prohibitions:\n\nEPO and other dialysis-related drugs (42 CFR § 411.355(g)).\n\nPreventive screening tests and vaccines (42 CFR § 411.355(h)).\n\nNOTE: The following DHS categories are defined at 42 CFR §411.351 without reference to the Code List:"
