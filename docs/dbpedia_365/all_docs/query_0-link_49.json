Your Netflix homepage is based on what you’ve previously watched, so you’ll only see suggestions for titles in the same genres. To get past this, you can use Netflix secret codes. We’ll show you how in this article.\n\nWritten by Sandra Pattison (Writer, Editor)\n\nReviewed by Samuel Chapman (Writer, Editor)\n\nLast Updated: 2024-07-07T14:58:28+00:00\n\nAll our content is written fully by humans; we do not publish AI writing. Learn more here.\n\nKey Takeaways: Netflix Genre & Category Codes\n\nNetflix has a list of genre codes that can be used to show all the titles in a specific category.\n\nTo use a code, all you need to do is add it at the end of a special URL: www.netflix.com/browse/genre/\n\nDue to Netflix’s regional restrictions, some codes might not work in certain countries. However, you can get past geoblocks with a reliable Netflix VPN, like ExpressVPN.\n\nNetflix has enough movies and shows in its library to cause a popcorn shortage at your local store. However, when you’re scrolling through Netflix’s homepage, you might feel like you’re not seeing the full package. Well, that’s because you’re not. The only way to see everything Netflix has to offer is to use this Netflix secret codes list.\n\nNetflix uses an algorithm to customize each user’s experience. It collects data about a user’s interests and what they’ve watched. Netflix then uses that data to recommend similar shows and movies the user might like.\n\nThis means your front page is only showing a portion of Netflix’s library. Thankfully, you can sneak past its limited selection and access complete genre lists using specific codes. In this article, we’ll list all the available Netflix cheat codes and show you how to use them.\n\nNote that regional restrictions on Netflix means that some hidden codes might not work in your country. However, a good virtual private network (VPN) can get past those geoblocks — though you’ll need one of the best VPNs that can bypass the Netflix VPN ban.\n\nHow to Use Netflix Secret Codes\n\nBefore we start, note that the below method does not work on the Netflix app — you have to use the website. Thankfully, the process is even easier for app users: Simply copy and paste the code into the Netflix search bar and you’re done!\n\nAlternatively, once you’ve found something you like in the browser, you can add it to “my list” and watch it in the app.\n\nIf you prefer watching Netflix on your laptop, the steps are still super easy to follow. We’ll show you how it works with screenshots.\n\nNetflix Secret Codes List\n\nIn this section, we’ll list all available Netflix category codes. Each category has a general code, which we’ve popped in the heading, and subcategories listed below.\n\nWe have tested all of the codes and we’re positive that they all work, though with a small caveat. Netflix’s content differs by country, so whether the codes work and what content is included in the category will depend on where you’re located.\n\nIt’s easy to unblock content from different regions, though, and you could use a reliable streaming VPN to get past geoblocks like this. If you want a few quick suggestions, ExpressVPN is our top recommended VPN for Netflix, followed closely by NordVPN.\n\nAction & Adventure — Code 1365\n\nAnimation — Code 4698\n\nAnime — Code 7424\n\nChildren & Family Films — Code 783\n\nClassics — Code 31574\n\nComedy — Code 6548\n\nDocumentaries — Code 6839\n\nDrama — Code 5763\n\nHorror — Code 8711\n\nMusic — Code 1701\n\nRomance — Code 8883\n\nSci-Fi & Fantasy — Code 1492\n\nSports — Code 4370\n\nThrillers — Code 8933\n\nTV Shows — Code 83\n\nFaith & Spirituality — Code 26835\n\nForeign — Code 7462\n\nCult Movies — Code 7627\n\nGay & Lesbian Movies — Code 5977\n\nIndependent Movies — Code 7077\n\nOther Secret Netflix Movie Codes: Unlock More Categories\n\nBesides the genre codes, there are Netflix movie codes and personalized pages that can further tailor your Netflix experience. For instance, aside from Netflix’s “Trending Now” page or its top 10 list, there’s a “Hidden Gems for You” page, which features shows and movies you might have missed.\n\nThere are also a few Netflix search codes that can help you narrow your search without choosing a specific genre:\n\nNetflix Christmas Codes\n\nIf you want to browse through all of Netflix’s Christmas offerings, the following codes will help you.\n\nNetflix Halloween Codes\n\nHow to Find Similar Content on Netflix\n\nIf you just finished a movie or series you really liked, you can find similar content by using a special URL and adding the title ID at the end of it.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Using Netflix Codes\n\nYour Netflix account homepage will conjure up shows and movies based on what you’ve watched before, meaning you’re missing out on its full library. The secret Netflix codes in this article might just introduce you to content you haven’t seen before, so why not try them out and access some cool hidden content?\n\nIf you’re looking for more Netflix tricks, read our article on the best Netflix hacks, as well as our piece on how to watch Netflix for free.
