        "text": "Movies On the Move\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n4 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 9, 2022\n\n--\n\nIf you’re a huge fan of movies, especially American cinema, then you’re familiar with film noir movies. However, if you have no idea what is this about, this is a style of cinema that was popularized in the United States from the 1940s to the 1960s. It features morally grey characters, sleazy surroundings, dim lighting, and a tragic tone. This film style was popular in drive-in theatres and the experience helps people appreciate this film style. Because of its prominence and aesthetic nature in producing noir films, it developed iconic cinematic motifs and tropes that inspire the succeeding filmmakers and even up to this day, a lot of movies and TV shows follow the characteristics of film noir.\n\nFilm noir was inspired by European cinema during the post-World War II era, which deals with a theme relating to the challenges after the war, neurotic worries by people, secret espionage from various government units of the America and Soviet Union, and criminal organization. These films were controversial during their time because they were bold enough to speak up about current social and political issues at that time that not a lot of people express their opinions for fear of being sanctioned by authorities.\n\nCharacteristics of a Film Noir\n\nCharacters: In typical noir movies, the main character, usually a male, is a private investigator or detective with a murky past or moral uncertainty. The femme fatale character was popularized in film noir as well, she is usually a desirable, forceful lady with questionable or ambiguous loyalties. The supporting characters usually belong to the moral outskirts of society, such as criminals, gamblers, fighters, and nightclub performers, and are frequently featured in film noir. The protagonist is usually an anti-hero and has motives that are usually self-serving and morally ambiguous. They are usually alcoholics (you can usually find them in bars and jazz clubs in their downtime) and are prone to be entangled in violent activities. Even if they are not the usual clean-cut, moral-driven heroes, audiences still empathise with them and even cheer them on to win against their adversaries, even though the protagonist usually meet their downfall towards the end.\n\nLocation: The setting is usually set in New York or Los Angeles. This is because shooting on location in Los Angeles (at that time) is cheaper than going to other locations. The city is usually exhibited with a glossy façade and a dark underbelly.\n\nLighting: Film noir typically employs harsh lighting and effective shadows to compensate for low costs. Because of these, they have created iconic shots of characters half veiled in darkness by using low-key lighting is used to produce suspicious shadows.\n\nTone Of Narration: Noir films oftentimes have pessimistic or cynical tones that reflect the overall dilemma and mood during those times such as the Cold war-era beliefs and scares. Characters are usually placed in dire situations due to instances beyond their control. Flashbacks and voiceovers help tell the story.\n\nThemes: The usual themes for film noir are often pessimistic. Hopeful, bright-eyed, mellow, cheerful themes are absent in film noirs. Disillusionment, hopelessness, bitterness, moral breakdown of characters and doom are the usual themes in noir films.\n\nPoint-of-View Narration: The story is usually told from the point of view of the character. The first-person puts the viewer right in the protagonist’s head, which adds to the claustrophobia which is a thrilling element in a noir. It also allows you to play along with the unreliable narrator technique.\n\nThe Mystery: Classic noir films tell mystery stories that deal with the gritty nature of crime and find out who did those despicable actions and figure out their motives.\n\nNo Happy Ending: Now that you’re aware that noir films have despondent themes, then expect that there is no happy ending for all characters. Unlike other films where all characters resolve their issues and happily ride into the sunset at the end, the characters in film noirs suffer; either they die, they go to jail, they lose all their important possessions… something tragic and harrowing will happen to them that they are in an even more dire situation than they were towards the beginning of the film.\n\nFilm noir lessen its appeal during the late 1960s when another wave of cinematic style become more popular. However, it still has a big influence on filmmakers in the current times and a new film style was created called neo-noir.\n\nIf this inspired you to hold an outdoor movie cinema event with your family or your friends or within your community, then take the liberty to screen some iconic noir films of the ‘40s and ‘50s such as Sunset Boulevard, The Maltese Falcon, Mildred Pierce, The Big Sleep, Double Indemnity, The Third Man, and Notorious."
